00:00 - i will be talking about the current
00:01 - involvement for web development uh i
00:04 - will be talking about what text editor
00:06 - i'm using and what terminal and what
00:08 - shell i'm using
00:10 - um because i experienced in in many in
00:12 - many talks after the meet ups
00:15 - that people are constantly discussing
00:17 - what they are using and what would be
00:19 - good
00:20 - and the advantages and disadvantages of
00:22 - all the
00:23 - text editors
00:24 - so i just quickly going to show you my
00:27 - setup and afterwards we can have a
00:29 - collective discussion but what you are
00:32 - using and what's best
00:34 - so
00:35 - i'm using visual studio code and item
00:39 - you can see here is visual studio code
00:40 - and here is item
00:42 - how many of you are using visual studio
00:45 - code
00:46 - okay that's a lot um
00:48 - yeah so i i tried many
00:51 - many text editors i tried atom visual
00:53 - studio webstorm
00:56 - brackets and ultimately i ended up with
00:58 - visual studio code
01:00 - um
01:01 - yes i was really amazed when i was using
01:03 - visual studio that there is a thing like
01:06 - intellisense and for c-sharp development
01:09 - you have to use basically visual studio
01:12 - and so i tried visual studio code and
01:14 - i'm happy ever since
01:16 - and i'm also going to talk about item
01:18 - the terminal i use because the basic
01:20 - terminal is
01:21 - bash
01:23 - i think
01:24 - or it's called
01:25 - terminal
01:26 - something like this however
01:28 - um
01:29 - i will not spend much time here because
01:31 - i'm not using it that that often and
01:34 - also we just do the code comes with a
01:36 - terminal on its own
01:38 - um yes i think that's it another
01:42 - important information is that i'm using
01:44 - a mac macbook pro and
01:47 - yeah
01:49 - so the first thing i want to talk about
01:51 - is visual studio code
01:53 - and the features are displayed here
01:56 - if you click on the link here
01:59 - you should go to the home page
02:04 - which is not displayed doesn't matter
02:08 - we'll just copy it
02:11 - or we'll even
02:14 - i will even
02:17 - yeah
02:18 - we'll even just open it here
02:21 - and show you
02:28 - it should work right now yeah awesome
02:31 - so as i'm working on here
02:34 - i'm going for visual
02:37 - studio code
02:41 - no that's not so great here
02:44 - and here are the main features
02:47 - displayed first of all it has it has
02:50 - intellisense which is practically uh
02:52 - just syntax highlighting and also
02:55 - autocomplete i was very amazed when i
02:57 - encountered this uh
02:59 - feature it basically allows you to
03:02 - suggest you the methods of objects or
03:05 - functions whatever
03:07 - and i will afterwards show a short
03:10 - showcase on how to use it and then it
03:12 - will be
03:13 - clear and much easier to understand
03:16 - there's also debugging involved
03:18 - in visual studio code so you don't need
03:21 - to debug in chrome or whatever browser
03:24 - you're using
03:25 - you have also
03:27 - built in git comments and it's
03:30 - ultimately easy to extend
03:32 - extend
03:33 - but i think nowadays most of the editors
03:36 - are easy to extend
03:38 - i also
03:40 - created uh or even wrote an article
03:43 - about
03:44 - hmm about
03:47 - the visual studio code extensions i'm
03:49 - using
03:50 - and this is actually the article it
03:54 - has reached pretty much
03:56 - good success
03:58 - i've just
03:59 - listed all my extensions i'm using i'm
04:01 - using extensions for html like auto
04:03 - close tag
04:05 - rename tag html snippets markdown
04:08 - extensions of course javascript
04:11 - extensions
04:12 - this is very important debugger for
04:14 - chrome you can easily
04:16 - start debugging without a lot of
04:18 - configuration maybe i can show you that
04:20 - as well
04:22 - of course eslint linting checking your
04:24 - code
04:26 - yes
04:27 - in modules intellisense
04:29 - so if you're if you're interested just
04:31 - go to the article and
04:34 - check out the extensions they are pretty
04:36 - nice for developing
04:38 - yes
04:39 - that's the article about extensions
04:42 - and
04:44 - the next thing i want to show you is
04:45 - item
04:48 - is anyone using item
04:51 - okay one awesome
04:53 - then just a
04:54 - short and quick introduction to item
04:56 - just give you an overview
04:59 - just type in an item and it should be
05:01 - the first one it's a terminal especially
05:03 - for mac os and if i go to features you
05:06 - can see what what you can do with with
05:08 - item you can split panes
05:10 - you have hotkey windows
05:13 - you can search for stuff you can
05:15 - autocomplete
05:17 - and yeah so different features that
05:19 - makes the use of of a terminal very easy
05:23 - and efficient
05:26 - i never really
05:27 - used to use the integrated terminal of
05:30 - mac os
05:31 - i started using item right away because
05:33 - i was recommended to use it and i was
05:36 - always happy
05:38 - yes so that's the item part
05:40 - and if i go through the
05:44 - presentation i'm also using it with
05:48 - i think i will just put it in here
05:50 - because that's too complicated otherwise
05:53 - i also combine it with the chat shell is
05:55 - anyone else using the chat shell
05:58 - one nice
06:00 - i use it with the um or however it's
06:03 - called it has some nice uh teams and and
06:06 - features
06:08 - and also using the auto suggestions we
06:11 - just show you in in practice as well
06:14 - there's also a good article and i will
06:16 - show the slides afterwards so you can
06:18 - check that out as well
06:21 - since my setup here is a little bit
06:24 - weird
06:26 - i will go right away to the
06:28 - demonstration part
06:30 - created a nice
06:33 - a nice slide here
06:35 - yes so now i'm going to demonstrate how
06:38 - i'm using both visual studio code and
06:41 - the item
06:45 - just figuring out how to use it properly
06:48 - here
06:49 - i think the best thing is
06:51 - to just put it in there and
06:55 - looking on top
06:57 - so maybe another nice feature is to use
06:59 - spectacle is someone using that for mac
07:02 - os
07:03 - it's just that you can switch with your
07:06 - window
07:07 - it comes by default the most linux
07:09 - distribution probably yeah it comes on
07:11 - default but
07:13 - yeah but mac doesn't have has have
07:16 - something like this so spectacle on top
07:18 - the
07:20 - the glasses is a nice tool and that's
07:22 - for free and it's working great
07:24 - so as you can see here
07:26 - um
07:28 - i can't really stand on the side
07:31 - yeah
07:32 - as you can see here is that's the
07:34 - terminal i have used uh used a nice team
07:37 - with coloring and showing the git status
07:41 - and i'm currently at the developers
07:42 - rising repository
07:56 - you the allies
07:58 - allies
07:59 - yeah that comes
08:01 - out of the box
08:02 - and they are a lot especially a lot with
08:04 - git that's very useful this can be very
08:07 - useful
08:08 - you can see here
08:09 - and for example if i want to do
08:11 - something i can get status which is just
08:14 - just
08:15 - and it shows me
08:16 - my current status of git
08:19 - so what's also very nice and works well
08:21 - with which you study code is now when
08:24 - i'm typing or maybe let's have it like
08:26 - this if i'm typing
08:30 - yeah
08:31 - probably
08:35 - so so if i'm typing code dot there is
08:39 - i've installed it in the path i can just
08:41 - open visual studio code
08:43 - and now it opens of course in my
08:46 - other window but here it is
08:50 - and here i'm having the terminal on my
08:52 - side
08:53 - so i can always
08:55 - work with the terminal here on this side
08:57 - and can work with the editor on this
08:59 - side
09:00 - so
09:01 - what i wanted to demonstrate now is just
09:03 - to see how visual studio code works you
09:06 - have
09:07 - options here to
09:09 - show you the
09:11 - folders and files
09:14 - you have a search
09:15 - you have a known section for your git
09:18 - stuff
09:20 - you have a debugger mode and the
09:22 - extensions listed and it's also very
09:24 - easy to install uh install extensions
09:28 - you can just add them here
09:30 - and yeah activate them install them
09:33 - uninstall them
09:34 - etc uh what's interesting is also maybe
09:39 - it was a little bit bigger here
09:42 - no is it better no yeah
09:45 - you also have a console here
09:48 - you have a debug console you have a
09:50 - terminal
09:51 - and depending on what shell you have
09:53 - installed you can also use the comments
09:54 - here you see just
09:56 - work working fine
09:58 - and it's also if you have a linter or
10:00 - something else installed it displays all
10:03 - the problems and stuff that is not
10:05 - working
10:06 - so what i did here is as you know we
10:08 - have a home page where we uh
10:10 - for developers rising
10:12 - and i just added our
10:14 - new partner
10:16 - that is we accelerate um if a just and
10:20 - search everything is working easily we
10:22 - accelerate
10:25 - you can see i just put in a div here a
10:26 - diff class
10:29 - this section here and now
10:31 - one of the benefits with visual studio
10:33 - code is if you can you can simply
10:36 - click on the tab here
10:38 - just show me the working tree here and
10:40 - show me the difference and it's side by
10:42 - side showing you what you have added or
10:44 - changed
10:45 - and
10:46 - it's working perfectly on the side on
10:48 - the side here
10:50 - you even have a mark where the change in
10:52 - your file is so if you're if you're
10:55 - having a large file with thousand lines
10:59 - um then this really helps and in this
11:01 - case i quickly can see okay i have here
11:04 - added a div
11:06 - so now what i'm going to do is i use the
11:08 - terminal
11:09 - and
11:10 - i'm most of the time i'm using the
11:13 - terminal terminal to use git stuff
11:14 - because it's just faster so once again i
11:17 - use the check uh git status to check
11:19 - what i've
11:20 - what i've done
11:21 - now say okay i'm using also alias here
11:24 - and said okay
11:26 - are using a git commit
11:28 - with a message
11:30 - and i say just add new
11:33 - partner
11:35 - partner wii x blur rate
11:40 - accelerate is this type correctly yeah
11:42 - um
11:43 - or maybe with a double d
11:46 - you can also use it like oh holy
11:48 - what's that
11:54 - so now that it says uh still something
11:57 - missing okay i have a logo so just get
11:59 - at all
12:00 - very easy
12:02 - just
12:03 - and then i can ah what i also want to
12:05 - show you is the autocomplete
12:07 - i just go in with that and it shows me
12:10 - the last the last
12:12 - commit i did with with a type of message
12:15 - like that this so i use
12:18 - i just say add
12:20 - yeah a new partner's
12:22 - logo awesome
12:28 - i don't want to do that
12:30 - remove
12:34 - so this is not working what i'm doing
12:36 - now is just
12:37 - pressing ctrl c to get out of this
12:40 - whatever it that was
12:41 - i have no idea
12:44 - so i'm trying it again
12:46 - still just auto completing it
12:49 - what
12:50 - now it's working right no
12:52 - no
12:55 - you need to either oh true
12:57 - true true true awesome now it's working
13:00 - and now instead of get push i set the
13:02 - upstream already so just gp and now it
13:04 - pushes to the master branch and that's
13:07 - pretty easy what i also want to show you
13:11 - is
13:12 - now this one resolvers
13:14 - so it's it it's connected and
13:16 - knows that there is there are no changes
13:20 - and what i want to do or show you as
13:22 - well
13:23 - is to go to the help section
13:26 - and if you haven't worked with visual
13:27 - studio code you can easily just download
13:29 - it install it and then you can go to the
13:32 - hmm interactive playground that is what
13:36 - i wanted to show you
13:38 - and here actually i think this is
13:40 - amazing and i haven't seen this anywhere
13:41 - else
13:43 - it has an interactive playground where
13:45 - you can try to use the features so here
13:48 - is a interactive playground you can see
13:50 - the numbers here
13:52 - and you can simply do some
13:55 - as it is explained here you can combine
13:57 - different keys
13:59 - and for example add multiple cursors
14:04 - and write different stuff awesome
14:07 - but you can also
14:09 - maybe
14:11 - if i want to just switch lines or co or
14:15 - multiple
14:16 - multiply lines can also do that very
14:18 - easily i can switch them around
14:22 - that's very easy
14:24 - i also can do is i'm not quite sure if
14:25 - i've
14:26 - installed this
14:28 - yeah just on the line going down and
14:30 - adding i don't know what is this here
14:32 - oh no idea maybe i can add another
14:34 - comment
14:36 - hi
14:38 - that's it awesome i can also delete it
14:42 - cool
14:43 - so that's a great feature and it just
14:45 - goes through the stuff here
14:47 - what i want to show you is actually the
14:49 - intellisense which is amazing
14:52 - here is a basic express example
14:55 - and what intellisense allows you to do
14:58 - is if you type app now and then dot
15:02 - then it should
15:04 - suggest you
15:07 - things
15:08 - which it doesn't
15:12 - ah i'm not i
15:13 - it does but this is not optimized
15:16 - because that's the playground doesn't
15:17 - matter it it does what it should do um
15:20 - it just suggests you
15:23 - features
15:24 - and method
15:27 - that's not working really in the
15:28 - playground
15:30 - maybe i'm using it
15:32 - for more
15:34 - on top
15:39 - yeah
15:41 - yeah i don't think it's working
15:43 - like it should here
15:45 - doesn't matter
15:47 - you can try it on your own and it
15:49 - hopefully will
15:50 - uh work
15:52 - um yeah line action i'm talking about
15:54 - that
15:55 - refactoring so there is plenty of other
15:57 - stuff on how to
15:58 - speed up your coding
16:00 - and i think it's
16:02 - pretty good especially if you're
16:03 - starting with the free code cam
16:04 - curriculum you have the box where you
16:06 - write your code inside and at the
16:09 - beginning it is okay but when you later
16:11 - have to write longer code i think it's
16:14 - more and more important to have a good
16:16 - editor with
16:17 - syntax highlighting and also suggestions
16:20 - and what i've used in the curriculum
16:22 - when i was
16:23 - more advanced and working from the
16:25 - advanced algorithms i was always
16:27 - writing the stuff in inside the text
16:30 - editor like
16:32 - atom or visual studio code
16:34 - and
16:35 - i think it's just easier
16:37 - to work with it test it and
16:40 - see if you're working the algorithm the
16:42 - right way
16:43 - instead of using the
16:45 - field on the homepage
16:47 - yeah i think that's it um
16:50 - i think those are the most important
16:52 - things i just wanted to go through since
16:54 - the setup is really weird here for me
16:55 - i'm not going to demonstrate more
16:58 - um yes
17:00 - oh yeah i have an introduction or maybe
17:02 - i can close
17:05 - somewhere is the presentation yes here's
17:07 - the background credit
17:09 - for somewhere tella from unsplash
17:12 - yeah just about me a little bit um
17:15 - i'm co-organizing this meetup with rob
17:18 - with robert and
17:20 - i'm a business law student i'm working
17:23 - as a front-end developer currently and
17:25 - i'm focusing on machine learning and i
17:28 - also did
17:29 - if anyone is interested in machine
17:31 - learning i also did
17:33 - where is that
17:36 - or
17:37 - i even
17:38 - even wrote an article actually
17:40 - if i find that it would be nice
17:42 - yeah it's here
17:44 - so if you if you are
17:46 - whoa
17:47 - if you're trying to get into machine
17:48 - learning there's a great course online
17:50 - it's from kuzera cozero is also an
17:53 - online learning platform it has very it
17:55 - has a lot of different courses
17:59 - um
18:00 - i think also in css and javascript and
18:02 - stuff like that but i did the machine
18:04 - learning course and i also wrote tips
18:06 - and tricks on how to do it
18:08 - i think it takes three months or
18:09 - something and it's just amazing so i can
18:12 - also recommend to check
18:14 - especially this course because the
18:16 - teacher is amazing
18:18 - but also the platform called zera it's
18:20 - amazing
18:21 - yes this was my setup
18:23 - now we can discuss your setups or if you
18:25 - have any questions just feel free to ask
18:28 - thank you very much
