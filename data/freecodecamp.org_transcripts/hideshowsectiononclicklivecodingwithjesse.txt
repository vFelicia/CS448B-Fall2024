00:06 - Hey everybody, it's Jesse.
00:10 - Happy Monday. I hope everybody had a nice weekend.
00:15 - I've gotten a decent amount done on the site since the last time we had a stream.
00:23 - You could see in my
00:25 - Trello Board I've got some more things in the "Done" section
00:29 - and today, we're going to work on this one:
00:32 - Hiding and showing some content on the teams page.
00:37 - So let's go to the code, let me show you what the problem is.
00:41 - If you want to look at all the things that have been done since the last stream,
00:46 - check out the GitHub repo and look at the commit history. There will be dates on everything
00:53 - so you'll be able to see step by step what changed in the code. I also have a link to this demo site
01:01 - so you can check out the rest of the site
01:04 - You can see I've put in we had a little vote for the font on Friday if you remember.
01:11 - I really like the Cinzel. I tried both of them and this one just looked,
01:16 - looked really nice. You can see it even on the home page.
01:20 - So that turned out really nice, so thanks to everybody who added their opinion about that. You can see I even added it here,
01:27 - and this section,
01:30 - just super nice.
01:32 - So,
01:33 - I think we're going to go with that.
01:38 - Now let's check out the the team page.
01:41 - Hey guys, I'm just looking at the chat.
01:44 - I'm doing good. How's everybody doing?
01:47 - (laughs) Um
01:52 - So I think,
01:53 - The last time we looked at the team's page, we didn't really have much going here.
01:58 - So since then, I've actually added some some data for these cards and
02:04 - You can see I've added all the sections with just kind of some basic things for the cards.
02:09 - I still have you know these kind of test sections down here.
02:13 - I've also added
02:15 - this,
02:17 - like, tiny, hero-ish section here.
02:20 - So there were a lot of images on the homepage for the original site
02:26 - that every time you refresh the page the image would change and that was kind of acting as their hero images
02:34 - for the home page.
02:35 - So after, we had a meeting Friday morning
02:38 - and I found out that the people who were the head of this department that we're making the site for
02:46 - really liked those images and spent a lot of time picking them out. So I decided to add them in and each interior page.
02:56 - Do you have a tutorial about building it? Yeah, for the
03:03 - Axiomteck Computer Maintenance, Service, and Repair asked if we have a tutorial about building it. Uh.
03:11 - Building what specifically?
03:14 - There's kind of a delay here, so I'm not sure what I was talking about when you when you posted that.
03:19 - So let me know what you want to know the tutorial about. I might have gone over it in a previous video
03:25 - and if not, maybe I could make a
03:28 - recorded video about it.
03:31 - So I'm going to try to add these in. I think it's better anyway because the odds of someone
03:35 - coming to the site enough times and getting to see every image was really low. A website with the one you're showing. Oh okay.
03:43 - So someone asked about a tutorial.
 So I've been doing live streams pretty much every weekday,
03:50 - showing how I'm building this site.
03:53 - So I have some live streams on this channel, on FreeCodeCamp's channel,
03:57 - and I have some on my own channel that I had done previously. So between the two channels
04:04 - you'll see a lot of what went into this site. I didn't start from scratch for this one
04:09 - so
04:10 - You know you won't be able to start you know from very basics. At some point,
04:15 - I'd like to do one just totally from scratch, set everything up, but for now for this project
04:20 - there's a really tight deadline. In fact today is the day that I had said I would like to have it done
04:26 - to the point where we could really
04:29 - begin testing it in different browsers and things. So that means I want to have at least
04:34 - demo content in for every different page that we'll have and
04:39 - You know the different elements on the pages. So I still have some work to do today
04:43 - but I think it's it's still doable that I can have all that,
04:48 - all that done. I have some people working on
04:52 - doing some some image editing and getting me some images for the sections that I don't have yet
04:58 - And I have someone else working on the content. You see there's a whole lot of text here
05:03 - So we're probably not going to keep this much text.
05:05 - I have somebody who's setting up servers right now, so I'll have some help so I can just focus
05:11 - Just on developing this site.
05:16 - Do I speak Spanish? Somebody asked if I speak Spanish. Just a tiny bit of Spanish, I haven't uh
05:23 - I had some Spanish courses in high school and in college
05:27 - But it's been a long time since I spoke in Spanish
05:31 - So I haven't kept up with it.
05:37 - All right, so let me look, let me show you briefly the old site.
05:40 - I think we went over this section in a previous video, but
05:45 - I want to show you again kind of the issue that we had.
05:48 - so
05:49 - This is the team page on the old site. So you can see the similarities.
05:53 - We just we added this content here. So the stuff that was in this red box is now here. Like I said,
05:58 - it's probably going to get cut down a little bit
06:01 - because that's that's a whole lot of text to start out with. And then these sections where you have these cards
06:08 - Basically I'm going to take this info and have them in these sections.
06:12 - But there's a lot here. You see we have this accordion kind of thing and
06:17 - there's a lot. And we had some problems, like when the accordion opens it just puts you right in the middle of the list.
06:24 - So not really ideal.
06:25 - It's not what people expect when they open that. They would expect to be at the top of the list. You see there's, a lot.
06:31 - So I'm thinking I don't really want to have all that stuff on the page.
06:35 - It would be crazy to scroll through that, especially on mobile.
06:39 - so
06:40 - the plan is
06:42 - I'm going to have these sections. So it doesn't seem that bad right now, but after we get all the data in
06:48 - It's going to be a lot a lot of stuff
06:54 - Are you guys having trouble hearing me? Am I, somebody said, asking what I'm saying
06:59 - Let me know if you're having trouble hearing me. I'll, um,
07:03 - I'll try to adjust some, maybe talk louder and adjust some of my settings.
07:09 - I actually have a trick when I'm live-streaming to help me talk louder than normal. I play music in my headphones.
07:16 - Because we all know when when you listen to music and your headphones you tend to talk louder. Okay awesome.
07:24 - Awesome, so it seems like everybody's hearing me all right
07:28 - Hey, so
07:30 - so if you have a problem with talking low like I do sometimes
07:33 - or maybe mumbling a bit and you're going to do a YouTube video, try out that trick.
07:38 - As long as the music's not too distracting. At least it's been working for me.
07:44 - Alright, so
07:46 - these cards. I think we started these cards. Just really briefly to kind of go over what's going on here: The problem
07:54 - with the cards was that as we were kind of resizing things, these cards were growing and shrinking
08:00 - but the image wasn't, so we had this white space underneath.
08:04 - It didn't look good. So the solution to that ended up being so much easier than I thought it would be.
08:10 - All I did was I
08:12 - set a max height for this card.
08:15 - So the images are all going to be square, and they're all going to be a hundred pixels by 100 pixels square, okay?
08:23 - I have a lot of different size images, some of them are really small
08:26 - so the only way I'm going to be able to get these uniform is just to make them 100 by 100 square
08:31 - and that way even the smallest pictures should work
08:35 - and
08:37 - since I'm setting my max height to be a hundred pixels
08:42 - Then I should never have a problem with that white space coming in on the bottom.
08:47 - The only issue that I have right now is the space gets a little bit tight, so you can see when we shrink it
08:53 - There's a a tiny window right now where
08:57 - there's just not enough padding on the bottom if one of these rows goes onto two lines.
09:02 - I don't know how many people have a long enough title that that will happen for
09:06 - but if I can avoid it,
09:08 - I'd like to. I don't want to spend too much time messing with it since it's such a small screen. It's just a
09:16 - really a few pixels where that happens in terms of width. But if I can fix that, I thinking maybe I can just
09:25 - drop the padding down
09:27 - all the way around and that will just make just enough space to get that on the next line.
09:32 - But I'm not going to worry about it until I get more data in there because it could be that,
09:37 - you know, somebody else has an even longer title and it doesn't work even with the padding adjustment
09:42 - and so I have to think of something else. So I'm not going to duplicate all that work.
09:46 - But for now, it works. I've used this red. It's the same color red we're using in the background and
09:52 - the idea is when you click on one of these, a modal is going to pop up and it's going to have all that other
09:58 - information that we see in here.
10:02 - Because for some people it's a lot.
10:05 - Some people not so much
10:06 - But no matter what, even if it was a sentence,
10:09 - it's still not going to fit in these cards and work the way we want it to.
10:15 - So today
10:17 - we're just going to try to hide these sections.
10:19 - So what I would like to happen is that if you click on, let's say, this title it would show everything.
10:26 - So by default the only section that would show would be this first one and then you just see the titles for the other ones.
10:34 - I'd like to put in a small icon here
10:38 - to show, give some indication that this thing is clickable. So a lot of times on menus
10:44 - you see like you know the little arrow icon
10:48 - and
10:49 - then when you click it to be open, the icon is going down.
10:53 - It's pointing down. And when it's closed
10:55 - it's pointing
10:56 - to the right. So I'm going to try to put that in. So.
10:59 - Let me show you where I go usually for icons. I think I may have done this in a previous video, but
11:06 - it's been a while. So I'll show it again. I like to go to Google, material design icons.
11:16 - There we go.
11:19 - So this is the site where you can get material design icons.
11:24 - Let's see.
11:26 - See what we get for arrow.
11:29 - Chevron, there we go. Okay, so it's called a chevron.
11:32 - We have the chevron right but where's my chevron done? We may just have to manually rotate it then.
11:41 - I really thought that I had used a down chevron at some point, but oh well, so we'll click on this one, and you can see
11:49 - the
11:51 - little cross would be nice as an icon. Actually,
11:54 - that's a good idea. Okay, so, in the live stream, we had a good idea
12:00 - to use a little cross as an icon so it would be like a plus. You would click it
12:06 - just saying like, "hey, there's more here," and then I'm assuming we would - that plus would turn into a minus and
12:12 - then you click the minus and then that would - I actually like that better. I like that a lot better.
12:18 - Let's try that. So I've used this on previous sites, but I'm going to try that plus and minus.
12:24 - Plus if we can find it. No. Let's see.
12:35 - No
12:40 - How about this?
12:44 - What we can do -
12:46 - This will be tricky. We can use the close
12:49 - and then just spin it slightly with CSS.
12:53 - (Quietly: "Type cross.") All right.
12:56 - I tried to type cross, nothing came up, but maybe I just needed to scroll up. Maybe I was too far down.
13:04 - All right, no not seeing cross here.
13:08 - I'm sure
13:10 - they have it maybe in a different font icon set, but this should work,
13:15 - just to spin this. So let's grab this and I like to grab the the SVG version.
13:24 - So we'll load this - we'll download this.
13:29 - Let's see. We just throw this in downloads for now.
13:34 - I already have it. Okay.
13:38 - Since I already have it let's just replace it because I don't want to search for it.
13:44 - I want it right here so I can open it.
13:46 - So, you can see we have this tiny little cross. If we go into view source,
13:55 - it's just such a small amount of markup right here.
13:58 - We can just take that markup and copy it and put it right into our code
14:05 - and it will show up. So let's just throw it in there now
14:08 - and see how it looks. It'll definitely need some adjustment,
14:12 - but for now, we just want something in there. I'm not going to worry about adjusting it too much right now.
14:17 - I'd like to get to, you know, actually showing and hiding something.
14:22 - And - If you haven't joined me before I only livestream for half an hour.
14:27 - Add. OH! Okay. Somebody just told me it's "add" -
14:32 - is the is the keyword that we want to search for.
14:36 - All right, let me just make a note that it's actually add and I'll do that later.
14:45 - So, uh.
14:49 - Okay, we got greetings from Italy. All right awesome.
14:53 - I've got some great grandparents that came from Italy, so awesome.
15:01 - Which editor is that? I'm using Atom. And then, okay, "remove" is the keyword for minus.
15:11 - Okay, awesome. Thank you for that. I can't believe that I didn't think of that as a word to search for. Okay.
15:19 - So I'll add in that icon at some point. That wasn't the important thing.
15:23 - I just wanted to show you guys where I usually get my icons and
15:27 - you know, how to grab the code for the SVGs.
15:31 - I like to use SVGs because it doesn't make a network request, like, for an image or for a font icon.
15:39 - This, you know, you just put it in line right in your code.
15:42 - I think the support is pretty good among modern browsers for SVGs. I've never run into a problem from one of my users
15:52 - All right, we've got greetings from Vancouver and Nicaragua, so awesome.
15:57 - Thanks for watching. Is this NodeJS or React Native?
16:00 - We're going to get into Node and React later on, maybe later this week or in the next week. So right now
16:08 - we're just doing some - we're just kind of developing it out. We're kind of developing and designing
16:13 - kind of together on the fly. It's a little weird, a weird situation
16:17 - just because the timeline for when the site needs to launch, but the plan is to
16:24 - convert all this into React components and render everything server-side on a server
16:30 - that's running nginx and Node.
16:33 - We're going to run Express so nginx is going to be the reverse proxy and
16:38 - Express is going to act as the server. So we'll get into that hopefully later this week.
16:45 - But let's get into some of the - Let me move this to the side,
16:50 - so we can get into some of the
16:53 - Javascript that's going to show and hide these sections.
16:57 - First, we can have some CSS. So I wrote a little bit earlier, and I just commented it out to show you.
17:03 - Where's my team page? My - I'm using Sass here.
17:07 - It's getting a little bit, a little bit long, so I might have to clean this up before the next live stream
17:13 - just so I can tell where everything is.
17:15 - Okay, so -
17:18 - I'm gonna uncomment that and,
17:21 - when I save it,
17:23 - I'll show you what's going on here. So you can see now everything's hidden.
17:29 - I've got greetings from Canada, Serbia, Bulgaria,
17:33 - Mumbai,
17:34 - Venezuela. Wow, you guys are all over the place. I love that.
17:39 - That's really cool when everybody kind of shouts out where they're from.
17:41 - I think it's amazing. You guys are all watching me, all probably all different times of the day and in the different time zones.
17:50 - Anyway, that's cool. I'm just in a small city in Ohio.
17:56 - And, uh -
17:58 - So thanks, thanks for watching. Philippines, Brussels, all right. I'm going to try to keep an eye on the live stream, but
18:05 - it's easy for me to get sidetracked with the live stream and not show anything. All right,
18:10 - So step one is complete. We've hidden things successfully.
18:14 - Okay, but I've added a class. I'll show you the mark-up. I've added a class of
18:22 - Open, let me see.
18:25 - You see this is getting pretty long - I can't wait till we convert this to React components so we can just have one.
18:31 - component and not have to have this huge long page.
18:35 - All right, so we have - there we go. Here's the section we're looking at. So -
18:42 - All the sections that have these
18:46 - cards for each team member are in one container and that just gives them some padding on the sides.
18:52 - And keeps them centered. And -
18:54 - I have this open class and you can see that's what actually displays all the rows inside that class.
19:04 - You can also see I'm not hiding the title row.
19:08 - So the row that actually has the title for that section is not getting hidden.
19:12 - So you guys are probably seeing this but just in case, I've just added a colon not and then
19:18 - in parenthesis I add the name of the class that I don't want this to apply to. So I wanted to apply to all rows
19:26 - except not rows that have the class title row. So.
19:31 - It's cool. Like I said you probably already know that but just in case
19:35 - somebody's like new to Web development. That's what that does.
19:41 - So what we need to do, and all we need to do is pretty simple, is just
19:45 - move that open class to whatever section is being clicked on.
19:51 - So today,
19:53 - really just for speed,
19:55 - we're going to write this in jQuery since we have to load jQuery anyway for the framework that I'm using. The framework is Materialize.
20:01 - When we convert this React, I'll probably do something different with it, more of the React style way to do things like this.
20:09 - But for now
20:11 - the jQuery way will work. I'm just going to go down here to the bottom and
20:24 - I'm just going to give a little comment
20:26 - so I remember what this is and you guys can if you're going to check out the code in GitHub.
20:31 - You'll be able to see that section too.
20:34 - So -
20:35 - In jQuery, we start everything with that dollar sign shortcut.
20:40 - And, let's see, we want to grab that title row.
20:48 - That class title row.
20:51 - And -
20:52 - We want to look for the click
20:59 - function.
21:00 - Can everybody see that? Do I need to increase the font? Let me know. Why not search for it instead of scrolling?
21:05 - Yeah, somebody asked why not search for it instead of scrolling so much.
21:09 - That would have been a good idea.
21:11 - I'll try to remember that. It is getting to the point where I need to just search for things because it's getting too big.
21:18 - Okay, so, we're doing
21:21 - this click function and
21:28 - inside the click function, all we want to do is just add,
21:35 - let's see,
21:37 - let's go with this and
21:40 - we want to add the open class
21:43 - to the parent. Okay.
21:46 - So this section is the parent so we're actually just going to type "this"
21:49 - which will mean the thing that's clicked on which in this case is going to be that title row
21:55 - Be careful about "this" in Javascript. Sometimes it doesn't mean what you think it means.
22:00 - Especially, at least for me,
22:02 - I found in React when I first started using React, "this"
22:05 - did not ever mean what I thought it was going to mean. So that can be a little bit tricky.
22:11 - But in jQuery when you're doing click things it usually is pretty easy to figure it out, what "this" is going to be.
22:20 - So we're going to have parent and actually it is just going to be the parent.
22:23 - We don't need to put any - the parent for this row is always going to be that section. So now we have that parent,
22:30 - we're going to add the class of open
22:39 - and that will show.
22:42 - Now you may have already thought this,
22:45 - this is the reference to the current object. Yeah, you're right somebody put it in the live chat,
22:50 - "This is the reference to the current object."
22:52 - Yeah, it's pretty straightforward right now although, like I said, I have run into some cases where this didn't always mean what I thought it
22:58 - was going to mean
23:02 - So not only do we need to open that section -
23:06 - Actually let's think about this. There's no reason why we couldn't have multiple sections open.
23:13 - So.
23:16 - I don't know if I want to auto close all the other sections.
23:20 - If we do that, we might end up with the same problem
23:22 - we had on the
23:23 - old site in that people are going to get stuck in the middle of a list when they expected to be at the top.
23:29 - So here's what I think we're going to do.
23:31 - We definitely do want people to be able to close it,
23:33 - but I don't want it to auto close everything else when you click one thing.
23:37 - So we're going to put a little if statement and do a check.
23:41 - We're going to say if
23:44 - Um.
23:48 - How do I want to do this?
23:51 - I want to check - all right, let's write this out first.
23:56 - If
23:58 - the parent
24:02 - section
24:05 - is open
24:08 - then we're going to
24:12 - then close
24:15 - else
24:17 - open.
24:19 - Okay.
24:21 - Okay, so I don't always do this, but sometimes it helps to do kind of this -
 just think this out logically.
24:30 - Okay, somebody in the livestream recommends You Don't Know JS, This & Object Prototypes book.
24:37 - That's a great recommendation.
24:39 - That is available for free to read.
24:43 - Maybe I'm going to write that down. I'm going to put a link to that.
24:53 - Ok I just wrote that down.
24:55 - That's an awesome book, a great resource, so. You can just toggle class open.
25:00 - You're right. I can do toggle class.
25:07 - I always forget about toggle.
25:10 - Okay, let's just do toggle class.
25:13 - So
25:16 - In case you're watching this later, and you can't follow the live stream
25:20 - I just had a suggestion just to use jQuery's built-in toggle class
25:26 - method. So let's change this
25:30 - to
25:33 - toggle class - oops.
25:42 - Okay, that's great. This should work.
25:52 - Alright, let's bring in the - where did we leave that at?
25:59 - Alright, let's see if this has done anything. Alriiiight, it's working!
26:07 - I have the same thing written here. I'll have to change this. I didn't realize that I pasted the same title in for both of these.
26:15 - Awesome, okay, now. What could we do?
26:20 - We could probably add some sort of nicer looking effect to that.
26:25 - And I may do that. At this point, since I'm just trying to get everything done
26:29 - enough to test, that will probably be on the list of things to do if we have time.
26:36 - But, it would definitely look nicer if we had some sort of other effect that happened when we open that.
26:42 - But the basic functionality we were looking for is there.
26:46 - So people'll come to the page, they'll see this,
26:49 - scroll down,
26:51 - won't have to scroll too far,
26:53 - but then they can click this. Obviously we're going to want to add things like we want the cursor to turn into
26:59 - the pointer that looks like you're going to be able to click on it.
27:03 - I'm going to add our icon, our plus and minus icons, and change those out.
27:09 - But for now, we have the basic functionality and -
27:14 - fade 100?
27:16 - Okay, somebody is saying to use fade 100, so -
27:22 - Actually, this is a new one to me. You guys are
27:28 - more knowledgeable here about jQuery than I am, so this is awesome. So I'm just going to add fade onto the end.
27:39 - I do know about the cursor pointer.
27:43 - Let's see. Is this? I'm sure I'll know in a second whether or not this is what you guys meant and whether it works.
27:59 - Okay, I'm not seeing that much of a difference here. Maybe? Fade in, okay. It's fade in.
28:10 - Or slide up, slide down. Okay, it looks like we have a bunch of options. So maybe, I'll, um - Did I say that?
28:25 - Maybe I'll have to mess with this after the live stream and see which one I like the best. But thanks for the
28:33 - all the feedback.
28:35 - This is great. Where I work, there's not that many developers here, and we're usually working on separate projects, so
28:44 - I really enjoy whenever I have you guys,
28:46 - you know, kind of watching me and able to give me some feedback. That's that's awesome.
28:51 - If you can get together with,
28:54 - you know, fellow developers, you can definitely level up your skills so much faster. You know, with help from other people.
29:04 - Oh okay, you're right. In the live stream, they're saying try to add it,
29:08 - add to the milliseconds because 100 milliseconds is not really that much so it might, it might be doing something
29:14 - and it's just doing it too fast for us to - and remove the toggle class for the effect. Okay.
29:22 - Cool. I'm going to try this. I think I only have a minute left on the live stream, so I'm going to try out all those suggestions
29:29 - when -
29:31 - probably later on. And
29:33 - Can you show open the class for [indistinguishable]?
29:36 - Can you show the open class? Okay. Let me show this - I just had a request to show the open class that I did with CSS.
29:45 - It's super basic. So we can see -
29:48 - Well first, so, I'm using Sass instead of straight CSS
29:51 - so if you're not used to Sass, it might be a little bit different.
29:55 - But basically all I've done is, these are just nested inside.
29:59 - So we're only doing things on the team page, you know, the page with the ID "team"
30:05 - inside this team card container and
30:08 - within the section that says open.
30:12 - On every row in that section, we're just setting display to block.
30:19 - Because before that, on every row except the title rows for all sections, we've set display to none.
30:27 - So by default,
30:28 - everything's going to be
30:31 - set to display none unless it has this open class on the section.
30:38 - Does that make sense?
30:42 - Good jQuery show and hide is an option as well. Man. You guys are on top of jQuery. I, um,
30:50 - I've been purposely trying to do things in just vanilla Javascript
30:54 - because I'm trying to get better at using React and everybody that I've
31:01 - watched on YouTube or
31:03 - I've read articles that said don't use jQuery with React
31:07 - so
31:09 - unfortunately my jQuery skills
31:12 - have not been getting any better and probably been getting worse since I've been trying not to use it.
31:17 - So I do appreciate all the help.
31:22 - Alright, so -
31:24 - That's it for today.
31:26 - Thanks for all the
31:28 - suggestions, thanks for watching.
31:31 - Tomorrow
31:32 - Tomorrow, we'll have pretty much a completed site. All the content won't be added in yet
31:38 - but hopefully we can tomorrow maybe you start doing some testing,
31:44 - checking all our mobile breakpoints.
31:47 - Maybe even taking a look at the server, and how we're going to set that up. Everything you can do in jQuery, you can still do in vanilla JS.
31:53 - Yeah, that's true.
31:56 - Someone said, "everything you can do in jQuery, you can still do in vanilla JS."
32:00 - That that is true.
32:02 - And that's the key. I found jQuery, when you're talking especially about DOM interactions or
32:09 - making, like
32:11 - XHR,
32:13 - like AJAX requests, then jQuery
32:17 - seems like it's easier.
32:19 - But it is true you can do,
32:22 - you can do everything in
32:26 - in vanilla Javascript. I use jQuery right now because I'm already loading it for the -
32:33 - for the framework that I'm using.
32:36 - All right, cool. You're welcome guys. I have some people saying thanks. So I'm going to end it now.
32:41 - I'll see you guys tomorrow. If you have any questions, throw them in the comments.
32:45 - I read all the comments, and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can. And
32:49 - you know check out - You guys have a lot of suggestions today. That's awesome. So if you want to, go ahead check out the repo and
32:56 - let me know what you think if you have any suggestions. I'll tell you right now it's a little messy
33:01 - just because of the speed that I've had to develop this site with.
33:07 - So I apologize for the mess.
33:10 - But pull requests are definitely welcome or just advice in general. Background image is a variable in Sass?
33:21 - Yes, somebody's talking about variables in Sass. Yeah, you can definitely -
33:27 - There's definitely some nicer ways I could write this
33:30 - for Sass. I'm not too worried about it now since
33:34 - all these styles are going to get broken up and added into the React components at some point
33:39 - and they're not going to be Sass at that point. So I'm not super worried about optimizing the Sass or organizing it that much.
33:48 - Oh yeah, my channel - I think it's just Jesse Weigel, the Youtube channel. The link's in the description.
33:54 - Ok, goodbye for real this time.
33:57 - If you have anything else just send me a message on Twitter, put it in the comments.
34:02 - Have a great day. I'll see you tomorrow.
