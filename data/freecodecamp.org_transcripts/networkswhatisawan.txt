00:00 - In the previous video, we saw what a LAN is. You know, a network which can span
00:05 - across a small region. Now imagine you
want to connect devices across multiple
00:09 - cities or multiple continents.
00:12 - Now, that's a huge network and that kind
of network is called WAN. In this, to
00:17 - explain this,
00:18 - let's take an example of an office
campus: you can have multiple buildings,
00:21 - you know, multiple floors, you have
multiple computers in this different
00:26 - floors. So, how do you connect them? You
take a router and put it in each floor
00:30 - connect all the computers in in that
flow to the particular router and you
00:35 - take a bigger router and you can all of
your router's to that and that's how you
00:39 - can create a small WAN.
