00:09 - hey everybody it's
00:11 - Jesse and uh coming to you a little bit
00:14 - later than normal today so I had a
00:16 - meeting scheduled for 2: p.m. which is
00:18 - my normal time and then that meeting
00:20 - ended up getting cancelled right
00:22 - before
00:24 - so ended up not really uh needing to uh
00:29 - postpone it but at that point I had
00:32 - already had it on on Twitter for hours
00:35 - and on YouTube that I was going to do
00:37 - this at 300 p.m. Eastern instead uh so I
00:41 - decided to just stay with
00:43 - that so
00:45 - um I'm going to catch you up from what
00:48 - we did yesterday and then uh we'll
00:50 - decide what to do today I'm going to
00:51 - leave it up to you all uh what we work
00:54 - on CU
00:55 - there's a few different there's probably
00:57 - at least three different paths that I'm
00:58 - thinking we could we could go down
01:01 - today and
01:06 - um actually let me know if the stream is
01:09 - all right I'm getting a message that the
01:11 - stream was not so good uh in terms of
01:13 - quality so it did say it's good
01:17 - now
01:19 - um oh no now it's it's not so good so
01:22 - just let me know uh it it looks like I'm
01:25 - uploading
01:27 - at I'm like over 5,000 kilobits for
01:30 - second right now which should be fine uh
01:34 - but let me know not sure if there's much
01:36 - I could do to fix it since we already
01:39 - started
01:42 - um okay now it's getting a little faster
01:44 - it should be
01:47 - good all right awesome uh it looks like
01:50 - in the live chat all right we have
01:52 - 1080p
01:55 - okay
01:58 - um so basically Ally since yesterday uh
02:02 - we had some pool
02:04 - requests uh so I had some pool requests
02:07 - from Kevin and from Gavin so there's now
02:11 - a GitHub uh
02:13 - Pages uh page for this so I'm
02:18 - not I'm not 100% sure about this but I'm
02:20 - pretty sure that the form will not work
02:23 - on GitHub pages but the rest of the site
02:25 - should work so it'll be a good way to
02:29 - check things out even when I don't have
02:30 - enro
02:33 - running uh so if you go
02:38 - to I I'll just I need to put a link to
02:41 - it now in the uh read me file I think
02:45 - that would probably be the best way to
02:52 - go uh but I think it's like it's
02:55 - normally what is it GitHub
02:58 - uh
03:00 - and I can't even remember how the URLs
03:02 - are formatted I haven't had anything on
03:03 - GitHub Pages for a couple of months so
03:10 - um off have to find
03:13 - it let me go into settings and uh show
03:17 - you okay here we
03:22 - go all right so here's what it looks
03:24 - like when you first go there so it's
03:27 - fusen marc. github.io okay that's what I
03:30 - thought and then slash Resource Center
03:33 - so resource hyphen Center uh when you go
03:36 - there it says page not found obviously
03:38 - because that's we haven't set that up uh
03:41 - in react router as a route so if you
03:43 - just click uh on the side have there you
03:47 - can go to the different pages so they
03:50 - work like I said I'm pretty sure the
03:51 - form won't work uh
03:56 - but that's that's not really a big deal
03:59 - you'll be able to see the rest of the
04:01 - site
04:03 - and let's see I'm going to paste that uh
04:07 - in the live chat and I guess I'll
04:09 - probably end up putting a
04:12 - link if there's not
04:14 - already a link to it because potentially
04:17 - I
04:19 - might I'm G to have to check usually
04:22 - repos will have it like right up at the
04:24 - top they can get a link to it so um I'll
04:27 - try to do
04:28 - that uh you know you know what I'm
04:31 - talking about like right up here I'm try
04:34 - to get a link to it right up here so
04:35 - it's really
04:37 - obvious uh so I'll do that later on
04:39 - that's not really important for uh for
04:42 - right
04:43 - now
04:45 - um let's see okay so
04:48 - basically uh so that was thanks to
04:52 - Gavin's full request so thank you Gavin
04:54 - uh that was that was all him in terms of
04:57 - uh getting that working uh forget Hub
04:59 - pages
05:00 - which was for this project a little bit
05:02 - more involved than you would normally
05:04 - need uh normally do to get your project
05:07 - on so check out that pool request uh if
05:10 - you want to see the details he included
05:11 - some links to uh some more in-depth
05:13 - instructions for doing uh GitHub Pages
05:18 - page with create react
05:20 - app also had a pull request I think we
05:23 - had two from um from Kevin uh one was
05:27 - refactoring so the the major one was re
05:29 - factoring what we did
05:31 - yesterday uh so if if you take a look at
05:35 - this I mean it's going to be hard to see
05:37 - it as I'm scrolling around but if you
05:38 - check out the repo uh everything should
05:41 - be up to date on the master Branch now
05:43 - so that's if you want to check that out
05:45 - that that would be the best uh to look
05:47 - at but if you check out the server.js
05:50 - things are looking a little bit better
05:52 - uh more
05:53 - organized and uh Sebastian also
05:56 - explained his his reasoning for
05:58 - refactoring in the way that he did on
06:00 - that pull request so that's like maybe
06:04 - pull request
06:05 - 34 something like that 35 somewhere
06:08 - around there uh also um we had an update
06:12 - to our example file for the environment
06:15 - variables to take into account the new
06:17 - variables that we were
06:19 - using all right so now now you're all
06:22 - caught up actually no there's still one
06:24 - more thing so I now have the actual uh
06:27 - content of the form
06:30 - going in the emails and going to the
06:32 - right projects so before we just had in
06:35 - the emails just some some string some
06:38 - demo string that came with the uh
06:40 - example from uh the srid uh API for
06:46 - node uh so we got rid of that so we're
06:49 - actually sending basically just
06:53 - um I'll show you how I did it because
06:55 - it's right here on the screen so all I
06:57 - did was uh here where we're already
07:00 - making uh an object with all the um all
07:05 - the
07:06 - fields uh so key value pairs with the
07:09 - field uh names and then the uh value
07:12 - that we put in so I decided since we're
07:14 - already looping over all that here why
07:18 - not make a string that basically has the
07:21 - same the same thing so I'm just grabbing
07:25 - the name of that input and then whatever
07:28 - the value is and then
07:30 - for now I've just included a break and
07:33 - uh I needed to change the
07:38 - type let me find out where this
07:47 - is at some point there was a
07:50 - type uh that I needed to send in with
07:53 - the um through the send grid API and now
07:56 - I can't find where it
07:58 - is it should have
08:05 - below least I thought it
08:10 - was oh okay uh so
08:14 - text/html
08:15 - is the the type so before we had text
08:20 - slpl all right so since we're including
08:22 - HTML now we had to change it to be HTML
08:26 - all right otherwise it will just it will
08:28 - actually show uh uh the the BR um
08:32 - tags uh so that's all we had to do to
08:35 - get it working uh for the email and then
08:37 - we just take that same uh Fields
08:40 - string and we use it we pass it here as
08:44 - well when we make the
08:46 - folder so now I'm this is an an
08:50 - additional uh so we weren't passing this
08:54 - before and we also now we're we're
08:58 - actually passing
09:00 - uh the the email address that gets
09:01 - entered into the form uh and that's
09:04 - going to be the title instead before we
09:07 - just had test that we were passing in uh
09:10 - so now if we go up to
09:13 - our make uh our Reich make folder
09:17 - function so you can see we have the name
09:19 - and then the
09:20 - content
09:22 - um so for title we have name and now for
09:25 - description we have content okay so
09:28 - that's all the fold that I've gotten
09:29 - right now I probably want to clean it up
09:31 - a little bit uh so I want to send two
09:34 - emails right now I'm only sending one
09:36 - email uh so I'll have to see what the
09:39 - best way to send those emails are
09:45 - um I don't know if there's some built-in
09:48 - way I'll have to read through the
09:49 - documentation to see like is there some
09:51 - built-in way that I can
09:54 - just uh you know put in pass in
09:57 - something else uh a say like all right
10:00 - we want to send the same
10:01 - email uh but I'm not sure we might do
10:04 - like an entire entirely new email new
10:07 - template send a different one I may want
10:10 - the user to see something different than
10:11 - the project manager
10:14 - sees uh not sure it I mean probably
10:17 - could just simplify it and make the
10:18 - email for the
10:20 - user it's enough that the project
10:23 - manager will just see that something
10:24 - came in and then that way uh they'll get
10:28 - an extra notification
10:30 - uh so that things don't don't slip
10:34 - through
10:36 - and yeah and that's so so basically for
10:39 - the
10:40 - server uh part of this we're we're
10:44 - nearly finished you know it's just a
10:46 - little bit of kind of cleaning up the
10:48 - way the email looks okay which is not
10:52 - really it's it's a bit tedious because
10:55 - you have to change things and then send
10:57 - an email and then check to see how it
10:58 - looks uh probably not a bad idea to
11:00 - check it in different email clients but
11:03 - it's going to be a really basic email
11:04 - this is uh it it doesn't need to you
11:07 - know it's an internal email and just
11:09 - kind of a courtesy thing to say hey we
11:11 - got we got your
11:13 - data um we got your
11:17 - submission uh and it also gives the user
11:19 - a chance to review what we got because
11:23 - they may have accidentally uh you know
11:25 - typed something in wrong or forgot to
11:27 - put something in and they get one last
11:28 - chance to review even after they've
11:30 - submitted and correct
11:32 - anything uh so we could do that we could
11:35 - work on this uh we could even try to
11:37 - look up some security things to do for
11:40 - our uploads or we could move on and
11:43 - start working on some of like the UI
11:45 - things like just some CSS with the
11:47 - layout which we have SAS set up now uh
11:50 - thanks to Patrick uh we haven't really
11:52 - done anything with SAS yet so maybe we
11:55 - could work on that uh the other thing
11:57 - that we could work on that would be
12:00 - be a little bit more involved we haven't
12:02 - done yet is doing the um
12:07 - resource uh section for
12:11 - Logos so I'm going to show it to you all
12:13 - I I know I've showed this before but uh
12:16 - most likely have some people watching
12:17 - that did not see it uh
12:20 - previously so I'm going to pull
12:24 - this onto the
12:28 - screen
12:35 - logos okay so here's how the logos look
12:39 - now uh so you can see it's you know they
12:42 - just
12:44 - automatically uh rearrange themselves
12:47 - and then we also
12:48 - [Music]
12:50 - have you know some filtering going
12:54 - on so this is actually not it's not
12:57 - going to be too difficult because is uh
12:59 - if you remember from our last project uh
13:03 - you you all remember
13:05 - Fabian uh from uh from Paris who did a
13:09 - bunch of pool requests for the last
13:11 - project I haven't seen him for a while
13:12 - in the uh in the live chat so maybe uh
13:15 - he's busy with work or something uh but
13:19 - he had some uh pool requests for our
13:23 - resource section the original version of
13:25 - it before we had to change it and we had
13:28 - a masonry out similar to what we had for
13:31 - the logos but it worked with react okay
13:35 - so this is all you know jQuery it's
13:37 - using isotope uh so we can't just copy
13:42 - this over and and have it work uh
13:45 - so we could probably look back at that
13:48 - pool request of fabians see what he did
13:52 - and then apply it here so we won't have
13:53 - to start from scratch but I think
13:56 - that'll probably be the best way uh to
13:58 - do things
14:00 - and instead of you know the
14:03 - isotope filtering we probably could just
14:07 - do our own filtering with do
14:10 - filter um and that should
14:15 - work that should work well it should
14:17 - accomplish the same thing the only thing
14:18 - that'll be different is there's you know
14:20 - you see there's like a slight
14:22 - animation we won't have that animation
14:26 - I'm sure it's possible with react but
14:27 - I've not really worked with uh you know
14:30 - animations in react like on on a state
14:34 - change so we'll see if you know when we
14:38 - get there so anyway those are the three
14:41 - options I'm going to repeat them really
14:43 - quick because I there was a lot of
14:45 - explanation between them so the first
14:47 - option is try to you know really polish
14:50 - that uh server.js
14:53 - file um with possibly some security and
14:57 - um proper uh email templat temp
15:00 - plates second option is do some UI work
15:04 - uh using some SAS uh and just clean
15:08 - things up a bit make it look nice third
15:10 - option is try to do a masonry layout in
15:14 - react for all these uh images for all
15:19 - these
15:20 - logos I'm going to give
15:23 - everybody just a minute uh I guess uh to
15:29 - to vote in the live chat and while
15:31 - that's going on I'm actually going to
15:32 - check out the live chat here uh cuz I
15:34 - haven't checked it at all yet and I'll
15:37 - say hi to
15:40 - everyone also I have had a few people
15:42 - join in on Instagram already but if
15:45 - you're not aware if you'd like to see
15:47 - what my office looks like and what I
15:49 - look like while I'm coding you can check
15:50 - me out on Instagram the Link's in the
15:52 - description if you're joining on
15:53 - Instagram and you don't know what's
15:55 - going on I am coding and if you want to
15:58 - see the code check out free codee Camp's
16:01 - uh YouTube channel for a live stream of
16:03 - my
16:08 - screens all right cool so uh Victor says
16:11 - hi great to be part of this project I'm
16:13 - beginning to like coding more with each
16:15 - step thanks free code Camp awesome
16:17 - you're welcome thanks for
16:19 - watching uh Hey everybody I see a lot of
16:22 - people are saying hello I'm not going to
16:24 - go through one by one I'm just going to
16:25 - say say
16:27 - hi
16:31 - Google user RVA asks is is this just
16:34 - Java um it's it's JavaScript
16:37 - so uh little bit different different
16:40 - programming language than Java but yeah
16:43 - it's it's basically I don't want to say
16:45 - it like this because there's this huge
16:47 - thing on Twitter a couple weeks ago
16:48 - about this but it's just
16:51 - JavaScript in regard to react I don't
16:54 - know if any of you saw that but there
16:55 - were like some people were freaking out
16:57 - about how everyone always says react is
16:59 - just JavaScript and they were saying
17:01 - like everything's just JavaScript like
17:03 - what do you I don't know I don't know
17:05 - what the big deal is I mean I think it's
17:08 - at least I've always understood that
17:10 - it's more nuanced than like obviously
17:12 - it's not exactly JavaScript right but
17:15 - anyway
17:18 - um don't want to go off on that
17:23 - tangent um let's see ish Isme uh says
17:29 - can someone tell me what this project is
17:31 - all about uh not sure if someone
17:34 - answered doesn't look like it so um
17:37 - brief description we're using react
17:40 - specifically we bootstrap the project
17:42 - with create react app which is just the
17:44 - way to get started building react uh
17:47 - really quickly without having to worry
17:49 - about configuring webpack or anything
17:51 - like that uh so we built it with that
17:54 - we're using uh material design for uh
17:58 - for our UI so specifically we're using a
18:01 - framework called material UI and we're
18:04 - blending that with another material
18:06 - design framework called materialize uh
18:08 - but the project itself the whole purpose
18:11 - of it is just to provide some resources
18:14 - like logos uh to people where I work at
18:17 - the University that I work at and then
18:19 - also allow them to
18:21 - request uh services from my department I
18:24 - work in
18:25 - marketing through an online form and so
18:28 - that online form sends emails after you
18:30 - submitted and it also sends data into a
18:34 - project management system uh through the
18:36 - through the API uh it's Reich is the
18:38 - project management system so that's
18:40 - basically what it
18:43 - does and so we're just working our way
18:46 - through that that
18:53 - project uh limle says hey it's a shame I
18:56 - started watching these streams only now
18:58 - now I'm watching only day two and trying
19:00 - to catch up with
19:02 - these well yeah it's good that you're
19:05 - watching now at least sorry sorry you
19:07 - didn't get in uh sooner but um some
19:10 - people have said that they're able to
19:11 - watch the streams on four times speed
19:14 - and it still makes
19:16 - sense so maybe you can try that I
19:18 - haven't tried it yet myself but uh who
19:21 - is I think Bill watches it yeah Bill's
19:23 - in here uh hey Bill I think bill has
19:26 - said he's been able to watch it at four
19:27 - times speed so so uh might help you to
19:30 - catch up a little bit more
19:36 - quickly okay Gavin good I'm glad you uh
19:40 - you sent a message about this so uh
19:42 - right before I started the stream like
19:44 - literally two minutes until I was going
19:46 - to start the stream I noticed that Gavin
19:48 - had sent me a message on Instagram I
19:50 - read it quickly and then realized I'm
19:53 - not even I don't even have time to
19:54 - respond to this right now uh so anyway
19:57 - the messages
19:59 - that he sent was about starting a slack
20:01 - channel so that we can keep the
20:03 - discussion going even outside of the
20:06 - live stream so that's a good idea there
20:08 - have actually been some attempts to do
20:09 - this before so we we had an and I I
20:12 - think we still have an IRC Channel which
20:14 - I haven't checked into in a while and
20:17 - I'm sorry about that if you've been in
20:18 - the IRC Channel but I just I just
20:21 - completely forgot about it um
20:26 - so we have the RC Channel uh although I
20:30 - admittedly IRC is a little bit harder uh
20:33 - to figure out if you haven't used it
20:35 - before than something like slack
20:37 - somebody did try to make a slack Channel
20:39 - but then nobody we couldn't get in it we
20:41 - needed like usernames and passwords for
20:43 - it and so that didn't work out
20:46 - so I'm definitely open to a slack
20:48 - Channel I think that would be nice
20:52 - um I if if anyone would like to set that
20:55 - up I'm cool with that uh and just let us
20:57 - know how we can
21:00 - join uh I think that would be cool if we
21:02 - do a slack Channel though I mean let's
21:04 - try to keep it the same as it is in here
21:07 - uh definitely very friendly for new
21:09 - people uh any questions are are welcome
21:12 - uh about code try to get along and not
21:16 - uh not get angry and argue with each
21:18 - other uh so just basically I like to
21:22 - have a really kind of nice laidback
21:24 - environment where anybody can feel free
21:26 - to ask questions without getting
21:27 - ridiculed for being a noob or anything
21:29 - like that uh if you want to have battles
21:32 - about which editor is the best I'm fine
21:34 - with that but no battles about like
21:37 - really really serious things because I
21:39 - don't want people to get there are other
21:42 - places where that kind of discussion is
21:43 - appropriate but not not on the free code
21:46 - Camp YouTube channel or slack
21:49 - Channel um Okay cool so anyway Gavin
21:53 - that's a thank you for that that's a
21:55 - really good thought so uh definitely
21:57 - think that would be cool
21:59 - um if if someone could get it
22:05 - going all right so chish uh says LOL LOL
22:10 - what's going on who's this learn get
22:13 - first
22:16 - yo uh yeah I I agree um gets gets
22:21 - awesome so this is Jesse and I'm
22:23 - building a react app Live on
22:26 - YouTube and uh yeah so I'm not going to
22:30 - teach you uh teach git but uh we will
22:33 - learn some Git along the way because
22:35 - I'll explain what I'm doing with it okay
22:38 - so I assume everyone's had a chance
22:41 - to let me know what you'd like to
22:44 - see uh all right so I see we have a vote
22:49 - for doing things with
22:54 - SAS logos animations
22:59 - ah Gavin reminded me about the Pomodoro
23:02 - clock I just always forget thanks all
23:05 - right I'm starting the pomor clock now
23:07 - which means I'm about to start
23:10 - coding um R masonry
23:16 - component how do I see the inst stream
23:18 - Dylan asked how to see the inst stream
23:20 - um my Instagram name is in the
23:23 - description uh for this video so check
23:26 - you can get the name there and then
23:29 - go into Instagram
23:31 - and um I guess you can search actually
23:34 - I've never really tried to see obviously
23:37 - to see my own stream uh so I guess
23:40 - you'll be able to search for me uh do
23:41 - like a people search and then it'll
23:43 - it'll show that I'm I'm streaming
23:50 - live okay it looks
23:57 - like
23:59 - it looks like I had a few people that
24:01 - are talking about the um the masonry
24:05 - layout and maybe one vote for doing
24:09 - things with uh with
24:11 - SAS so I think we're going to do the
24:13 - masonry layout today and we may end up
24:17 - actually doing some things with SAS to
24:18 - make that layout look nice so we'll
24:20 - probably get a little bit of both so if
24:21 - you if you voted for SAS uh you're not
24:24 - going to be uh disappointed
24:27 - completely uh so that's good I I figured
24:30 - you may have been getting tired of
24:31 - working in server.js anyway because
24:34 - we've been doing that for at least like
24:36 - three days maybe four
24:45 - days okay uh one
24:52 - more all right one more comment and then
24:54 - we'll start
24:56 - uh Damien says I'm heading back to day
24:58 - nine may I make a suggestion when a new
25:01 - module is used can you show how it's
25:03 - done on day four I was struggling and
25:06 - was able to add uh Babel
25:09 - to uh Dev
25:12 - dependencies uh then Googling
25:15 - worked
25:17 - okay yeah I'll
25:19 - um I'll have to do a better job of uh of
25:22 - updating on that
25:25 - so uh I'll try to remember to let you
25:27 - all know when things are added into
25:29 - package Json uh you know just to make
25:32 - sure that you know when that happens you
25:34 - got to run npm or yarn and install the
25:38 - packages otherwise stuff probably won't
25:40 - work right uh okay
25:45 - cool uh Gavin has created a
25:48 - channel
25:55 - so uh Gavin if you replace the uh
25:58 - periods in the link with an
26:02 - asterisk then uh you should be able to
26:05 - paste it in there and then if anybody
26:07 - copies it they can just replace the
26:09 - asterisk with periods so some i' some
26:12 - people have been able to get links in
26:13 - there like
26:19 - that all right so let's go let's first
26:21 - things first let's look up uh the code
26:25 - that we're going to use
26:29 - um so it should
26:36 - be should be in this
26:40 - repo let's see if we have we may have a
26:43 - branch for
26:57 - it
27:16 - all right so don't have a branch I was
27:17 - hoping there'd be a branch and it'd be
27:18 - easy I'll have to look back
27:20 - [Music]
27:23 - through let's go to that
27:26 - page if you're not familiar with Git
27:28 - this is one of the great things about
27:30 - git and Version Control in general uh so
27:33 - the final version of this project which
27:35 - is now finished and launched does not
27:38 - have the code that I want uh to use but
27:41 - a previous version of it that we moved
27:44 - on from does have that code so if I
27:48 - hadn't been using git or some type of
27:51 - Version Control that code would be lost
27:52 - to me uh unless maybe like I manually
27:55 - copied the file and saved it somewhere
27:57 - but now I can go back so I can go to the
28:00 - file which should should be resources
28:02 - and I can look at all the
28:05 - previous versions of that file so I can
28:09 - go down here and I can see everything
28:12 - that's changed and even who changed it
28:15 - so let's
28:27 - scroll okay so that's where I did the
28:29 - new
28:32 - UI so anything before that should be
28:35 - what we
28:37 - want so I can go in here and I can see
28:40 - exactly what changed on that particular
28:43 - commit on that that version of the code
28:46 - or I can just view it view the whole
28:49 - file and that's what I want to do uh so
28:52 - it looks like we we are using react uh
28:55 - masonry component which I think had put
28:58 - in the uh in the live chat so that's
29:00 - what we will be
29:02 - using
29:07 - um let's see if we had anything
29:11 - else yeah this we this is really all we
29:14 - need uh to
29:16 - import so we will be pulling in that
29:23 - package okay we're going to be using
29:25 - some of this so in state uh we'll have
29:29 - basically the an active tab right so
29:32 - we're not it's not really going to look
29:34 - like a tab layout so if you see like
29:37 - what we have here I wouldn't necessarily
29:39 - call this tabs it doesn't it at least it
29:42 - just doesn't feel like a normal tab
29:45 - layout uh in terms of like the way it
29:49 - animates and everything but that's
29:51 - essentially what's what it's going to be
29:55 - um so we're going to
30:00 - keep let me make this a bit
30:04 - bigger so we're going to keep uh
30:11 - this I'm I haven't decided yet exactly
30:14 - how I'm going to pull in all these
30:15 - images uh and what what I'm going to use
30:18 - uh to manage those images
30:21 - so uh not sure if we're going to have to
30:24 - make any calls to get
30:26 - that
30:32 - okay uh now this code is going to have
30:35 - some extra things that we definitely
30:36 - won't
30:40 - need we're not going to do this AIT tab
30:43 - stuff so this this was to make some
30:46 - things work that we're using uh jQuery
30:48 - and we're definitely not going to use
30:53 - that uh the
30:55 - actual let's go to the actual markup
31:02 - up all right so we have this masonry
31:06 - component right so
31:09 - we're wrapping everything in the masonry
31:12 - component and then each one of the
31:15 - images will basically be here where
31:18 - where we have our div that's that's a
31:23 - column and then a card inside of that we
31:27 - we'll have the same thing so we'll have
31:28 - our div that's a column and then inside
31:30 - of that we're not going to have a card
31:33 - we're going to have an
31:37 - image and then that in this case that
31:42 - connects
31:48 - in down
31:56 - here and we add actually are are putting
32:00 - in we won't need to do uh so much of
32:06 - of like the categories and things uh in
32:09 - our drop down we're not going to do that
32:11 - we're just going to have
32:14 - essentially tab I was I was thinking for
32:16 - a second I would show you how this looks
32:18 - if you don't remember this project but
32:19 - we can't because we we changed it so uh
32:23 - I can't really show you how it worked
32:25 - out but anyway it might be a little bit
32:27 - hard just to see um with the code I mean
32:31 - if if you had seen some of the shows
32:33 - when we did this uh maybe it's a little
32:36 - easier so let's just get to it and put
32:38 - something on the screen just to get it
32:40 - start to see what this is actually going
32:43 - to look
32:44 - like so the first thing we're going to
32:46 - do is get this package uh so if you're
32:50 - not familiar with how npm works then
32:54 - this will be a nice
32:56 - introduction
33:01 - so in our package Json file you'll see
33:05 - we have this section for
33:07 - dependencies okay now this this file has
33:09 - gotten uh somewhat large um so don't
33:16 - worry if this looks like a lot of stuff
33:18 - uh if you're just starting out on your
33:20 - project it'll be a lot smaller more
33:23 - simple uh and that's as it should be for
33:26 - for a project starting out uh so this
33:29 - project we've been working on this
33:31 - for uh this is day 15 and there's what
33:35 - at least a dozen people working on it
33:37 - right now uh between you know me and and
33:41 - all of you that have submitted pool
33:42 - requests
33:43 - so it's starting to get a bit
33:46 - complicated
33:47 - um but basically what we're going to do
33:50 - is we're going to pull in that uh that
33:52 - package um react Mason Rec component all
33:56 - right and that's going to help us get
33:57 - masonry layout and have basically do a
34:00 - lot of things that we don't really need
34:01 - to do by hand from scratch right because
34:04 - that would be kind of tedious we may as
34:06 - well use that package uh when we do load
34:10 - that package it's going to show up here
34:11 - in our package Json under our
34:13 - dependencies this is going to get synced
34:15 - up to GitHub so that anybody who wants
34:18 - to copy that you know they're going to
34:20 - clone that
34:22 - repository they can then run
34:24 - npm and it'll check this and it'll load
34:28 - all the things all these things that
34:30 - you'll need for the project to run so I
34:33 - know a lot of you probably know that you
34:35 - know but uh for people who are just
34:38 - beginners starting out um that's kind of
34:41 - how how it works
34:44 - um at least for people that are using
34:46 - like npm based uh based things I know
34:49 - other programming languages have similar
34:52 - things I can't remember I can't remember
34:54 - what they're called in in other
34:55 - languages right now but uh so you know
34:58 - if you're familiar with like package
35:00 - managers in other languages then it's
35:03 - similar thing that's going on here uh
35:06 - but it is nice uh that we can all have
35:08 - the same things and the same versions of
35:11 - these packages all running uh so we
35:13 - should in in most cases uh all be able
35:17 - to run it uh and it should
35:21 - work all right so let me pull over my
35:24 - command line on my other screen right
35:27 - now
35:33 - uh I will make this bigger I know it's
35:35 - really small right
35:36 - now so this is my my terminal or command
35:41 - line to tell you the truth I don't
35:42 - really know if there's a difference
35:43 - between saying command line or terminal
35:46 - if they're interchangeable maybe there's
35:47 - a difference I don't really know if if
35:50 - one of you knows uh let me know so uh
35:53 - it's possible that I don't sound very
35:55 - smart because maybe I'm using them wrong
35:59 - um
36:00 - but if you're not familiar with it I
36:03 - mean this is where we can type in
36:04 - commands mine looks a little different
36:06 - than the default because I'm using
36:08 - something called iterm 2 uh this is for
36:10 - a Mac uh if you're on Windows you can
36:13 - there are different things um that you
36:15 - can use as well I can't remember for
36:17 - sure Commander or something I I can't
36:21 - remember what I have on my PC uh but
36:23 - you'll probably want to download
36:24 - something other than your basic uh
36:26 - terminal just to add you know some extra
36:29 - features that'll help speed up your
36:33 - development so in in
36:37 - this let's
36:39 - see looks like my um commit didn't work
36:42 - I didn't even realize
36:44 - it
36:47 - uh W
36:50 - okay cre F let's check this out for a
36:54 - second so we
36:56 - have wow how did I fail this many
37:04 - tests all right so let's check this out
37:08 - this will be a great learning
37:09 - opportunity what to do when things go
37:14 - wrong so I right now we're set up to run
37:19 - some tests every time we commit uh code
37:22 - so we're actually doing several
37:24 - different things so it's checking all
37:26 - the code for error
37:28 - it's formatting all the code in a
37:30 - standard
37:31 - format uh and then it's running some
37:35 - tests to make sure everything's working
37:39 - so we
37:42 - failed some of these
37:52 - tests and it looks like we're failing
37:54 - for navigation
37:56 - error
38:09 - I'm I'm going to try it again just
38:12 - to see what
38:15 - happens I don't know about you but
38:17 - sometimes I'll just try to do the exact
38:19 - same thing again and occasionally I'll
38:21 - get a
38:22 - different get a different result all
38:24 - right so we are getting the same result
38:27 - uh not exactly sure what's
38:30 - happening uh for the sake
38:35 - of just kind of moving on
38:38 - um
38:40 - let's let's skip the test I really hate
38:42 - to do this because I I think it would be
38:44 - good in case you are having these
38:46 - problems but um this is kind of like a
38:50 - big detour from what we were trying to
38:52 - do uh
38:54 - so for now at least
38:59 - I'm going to
39:04 - add no verify actually that's for Husky
39:09 - I don't think this is going to work
39:11 - we'll try I'll try it
39:17 - anyway oh yeah it did work awesome
39:25 - okay all right so I had thought that I
39:29 - um had pushed this up to master and I
39:31 - told you all that at the beginning uh of
39:33 - the stream so obviously that hadn't
39:36 - happened I just didn't look back at my
39:39 - uh my
39:40 - terminal
39:43 - so now we're going to pull down the
39:46 - correct package so I happen to be using
39:49 - yarn uh which instead of normal npm
39:52 - which uh you can you can use that I'm
39:55 - using yarn
39:58 - um we can do YN add and
40:03 - then
40:07 - react rry component and I'm going to
40:09 - double check let's
40:14 - see okay now double check the spelling
40:17 - so I don't know if you all heard but
40:18 - there were some uh some people were
40:22 - taking like common packages and then
40:24 - publishing their own packages that had
40:26 - the same name just misspelled slightly
40:29 - and then those package was were stealing
40:31 - environment variables that's just
40:33 - supposed to be private uh so which is
40:37 - actually crazy because I don't know if
40:39 - anybody was watching the stream so one
40:41 - of the early streams I started to type
40:45 - um a package name and it occurred to me
40:48 - that someone could do a lot of damage if
40:50 - they misspelled it and
40:53 - um I don't know if anybody remembers
40:56 - that but there's video evidence of this
41:00 - uh and um which may not be good for me
41:04 - because someone might say it was my
41:07 - fault but I I doubt that anybody watched
41:11 - my uh my stream and got the idea for
41:13 - that but it actually did happen so at
41:15 - the time when I said it it was just
41:17 - hypothetical like that would be bad if
41:19 - somebody did that uh but people were
41:21 - actually doing that evidently and uh
41:25 - so basically just double check when you
41:28 - put this in that you're actually
41:30 - spelling everything
41:31 - correctly uh
41:33 - otherwise I I don't think it was really
41:35 - widespread there didn't seem to be that
41:37 - many people affected and I think uh npm
41:40 - is they're taking steps to prevent that
41:43 - from
41:44 - happening but just in case uh you may
41:48 - want to you know double check
41:50 - that okay so we have uh react masonry
41:56 - component
41:58 - and you can see now it shows up here
42:01 - right so it says here's the name of the
42:03 - package and then here is the
42:06 - version so uh by default if you don't
42:09 - specify a version uh it should give you
42:12 - the latest stable
42:15 - release which you could certainly
42:17 - specify any version number that that you
42:20 - wanted that's available uh on
42:24 - npm uh let's see
42:29 - okay at this point we can go into
42:32 - our our component for the logo view so
42:38 - logos. JS so you see we we already have
42:41 - some things in here and I actually using
42:43 - this I was using this to test out the um
42:46 - generic card uh that Rohit had made and
42:49 - committed which is going to be really
42:51 - useful uh as we start to build out some
42:53 - of the other pages but for now uh I'm
42:56 - going to remove this because we're we're
42:59 - actually uh going to put the logos in
43:02 - here now so we we don't want this in
43:04 - here right
43:09 - now
43:13 - and we want a
43:17 - row yeah we'll probably want to leave
43:19 - the
43:21 - row
43:25 - and yeah let's pull in
43:32 - our we'll pull in masonry so we're going
43:34 - to import masonry from react masonry
43:36 - component and then that will allow us to
43:38 - use masonry uh in our
43:43 - component and then I'm just going to
43:45 - bring in right now I'm I'm copying a I'm
43:47 - going to be copying a lot of things over
43:49 - from that file that I showed you from
43:51 - our previous
43:54 - project um so we're not going to need
43:58 - all of this we don't need
44:01 - price uh me
44:08 - data we may end up using data later on
44:11 - but we're not right now
44:18 - cator
44:19 - type actually so in comparing the two
44:23 - projects I think
44:26 - type
44:31 - type will be the equivalent to our
44:34 - categories that ran along the
44:37 - top so we're going to keep that uh we
44:40 - all we don't need these categories so uh
44:43 - once we get going we may decide we can
44:45 - change this up but I think this should
44:48 - be all
44:50 - right at least to start
44:56 - with
45:04 - and okay so I don't think we need to do
45:07 - anything like with life cycle methods
45:10 - right
45:12 - now uh so I am going to copy
45:17 - over um that
45:20 - masonry uh constant that we had
45:25 - so we we going
45:28 - to keep
45:31 - filter all right we can get rid of this
45:33 - filter because we don't have price we
45:35 - can get rid of the category
45:41 - filter we
45:45 - can we're going to get rid of the
45:49 - card the resource
45:51 - [Music]
45:55 - card
46:00 - yeah we'll get rid of the
46:03 - card and instead we are we're going to
46:06 - end up having an
46:12 - image trying to think if there's a a
46:14 - wrapper so
46:16 - um for now I'm just going to put in an
46:19 - image we're going to use a placeholder
46:21 - image uh I'll have to check in material
46:25 - UI to see if there's some component like
46:27 - wrapper for responsive images or
46:29 - something like that uh we we'll see how
46:33 - it uh how it looks for right now I I
46:36 - think it'll be all right just to use the
46:39 - image uh
46:43 - element
46:45 - and let's see what have we been using
46:47 - for images that
46:49 - was uh for stock
46:55 - images actually I probably could I could
46:58 - use a real image I think uh we
47:04 - have where did I have oh I must have
47:07 - moved to my other screen let's we could
47:09 - maybe use a real
47:17 - logo and uh we'll probably need to add
47:20 - some extra logos as well we've gotten
47:22 - some new logos since uh since I first
47:25 - made this
47:29 - so let's see what
47:32 - the here we
47:40 - go yeah that that should be I was just
47:43 - double checking to see what where that
47:45 - was at uh in the folder structure I
47:47 - think that should be publicly
47:55 - accessible
48:16 - I would normally obviously just just do
48:21 - um uh get the image uh you know URL but
48:25 - since it's wrapped in all these divs I
48:27 - can't actually get to the image the real
48:29 - image
48:30 - itself uh so that's why I'm getting the
48:33 - uh Euro like
48:36 - this so let me put this in and I'll need
48:39 - to
48:44 - Dos I need to put the beginning of that
48:53 - in
48:55 - who
49:04 - okay um my pomodora timer is up so I'm
49:08 - going to do a five minute break from
49:10 - coding uh to check out the live
49:13 - chat and then we'll go back and do
49:15 - another uh Pomodoro
49:18 - session uh so I'm going to scroll up a
49:21 - bit and see what I've
49:25 - missed
49:29 - okay I see Kevin said maybe it's time to
49:31 - split the server into various files I
49:34 - agree I figured we'd have to at some
49:36 - point uh cuz I mean I knew it was going
49:38 - to start to get big with all the and
49:40 - we're still not even doing everything
49:41 - that we need to do uh so it's going to
49:44 - get even
49:46 - bigger uh so we probably should split it
49:55 - up
50:15 - uh yonas uh asks can you show me a
50:18 - lesson use a CSS class to style and
50:21 - element please um we'll probably end up
50:26 - using classes to style and element
50:28 - possibly uh in this this stream so uh if
50:32 - you can stick around and watch uh we'll
50:36 - get to that once we start getting some
50:37 - things on the screen I'm sure we'll have
50:38 - to
50:39 - adjust uh probably I'm thinking at the
50:43 - very least um that top uh row of
50:48 - categories uh that we're going to put on
50:50 - there we'll definitely need some
50:53 - adjustment again unless I could find a
50:55 - material UI component that does exactly
50:57 - what I want uh we'll probably need to
51:00 - adjust it and we will most likely have a
51:03 - class that will
51:05 - uh we'll
51:08 - use let's
51:19 - see uh Jong wo says hello everyone
51:22 - what's your go-to editor and terminal
51:25 - well I think I've already said the my
51:26 - terminal I use is iterm too on Mac on
51:31 - Windows um I think it's Commander but
51:34 - it's it's spelled like cmdr or something
51:37 - like
51:40 - that and I guess that's how you
51:42 - pronounce it I've always just assumed
51:43 - that's how you pronounce it but now that
51:45 - I think about it I'm not even
51:47 - sure uh and then my editor is uh Adam
51:51 - but I like Visual Studio code as
51:55 - well Unice asked when did you start
51:58 - coding um like if the very first time I
52:02 - ever started coding uh was when I was in
52:04 - high school so probably I was 16 or 17
52:08 - years
52:08 - old uh and that's if you really want to
52:11 - consider like HTML and CSS coding uh
52:15 - which I I'm not going to get into that
52:17 - um I've some people do or don't think
52:21 - it's coding
52:23 - so
52:24 - uh after that though like really like
52:27 - starting to code and get paid for coding
52:30 - um it's only been I don't know like four
52:34 - years
52:35 - ago
52:37 - um yeah it's three or four years let's
52:40 - see so I've been a full-time uh Bas
52:44 - full-time front and developer for almost
52:46 - two years now uh at this University
52:50 - before that I was freelance uh for about
52:53 - two two three years uh
52:57 - and for most of that time I was doing
53:00 - coding work um when I first started out
53:03 - it was not not so much coding uh just
53:06 - maybe like some CSS stuff here and
53:25 - there
53:27 - uh okaba says please is the entire
53:30 - project going to be made available for
53:31 - download after it's been completed yeah
53:34 - the project is um it's it's already
53:37 - available on GitHub so um you know you
53:41 - can certainly clone it download it
53:42 - whenever you want um and it'll still
53:45 - it'll be left up there whenever it's
53:47 - completed too uh and then of course the
53:49 - videos will all still be available um
53:52 - for as long as free code Camp wants to
53:54 - keep them up uh which I I assume they
53:57 - want to keep them up
54:00 - uh
54:01 - unless I don't know maybe if I I really
54:05 - mess up they'll take them down uh but I
54:09 - think they're happy with what I've been
54:11 - doing so far and it looks like so Gavin
54:14 - has made a slack Channel and uh he
54:17 - shared the link but let's see I'm going
54:22 - to clean up the link and paste it in
54:24 - since uh no one else but me is allowed
54:28 - to put actual links
54:34 - in so my timer is run out I'm going to
54:36 - get back to coding in a second but I I
54:38 - do want
54:40 - to uh join this SL team for free Cod
54:43 - Camp live
54:45 - awesome so this link I just tried the
54:47 - link it should
54:49 - work and I've put that in the live chat
54:52 - uh I'll probably end up putting this
54:54 - link in the video video description as
54:58 - well uh so that everybody can see it we
55:00 - won't have to keep putting it into the
55:02 - live
55:09 - chat all right
55:11 - so 330 I'm making a mental note of where
55:14 - I'm leaving off at in the in the live
55:17 - chat uh and then I'll I'll come come
55:19 - back to it
55:24 - soon wow looks look like cool I do have
55:28 - a couple of viewers on the uh on the
55:30 - live stream on Instagram which is cool
55:35 - um if if you are viewing I'm sure you
55:37 - probably didn't hear the announcement at
55:38 - the beginning of the stream if you want
55:40 - to see the code check out the free code
55:42 - Camp Channel on YouTube and you'll be
55:44 - able to see what's on my screen I know
55:45 - you can you can see the code a little
55:47 - bit uh in the corner of the feed but uh
55:51 - not enough to really know what's going
55:52 - on all right so let's restart our
55:54 - Pomodoro Timer we'll do another 25
55:56 - minutes of
55:58 - coding so what we left off basically is
56:02 - we've imported uh the masonry uh We've
56:05 - imported masonry from the react masonry
56:08 - component uh npm
56:11 - package
56:13 - and right now we
56:16 - have set up our state uh just our
56:20 - defaults and then we have a constant
56:22 - that's going to be masonry component and
56:25 - uh we're going to put that we're going
56:27 - to insert that down here right now we
56:32 - don't really have a lot we'll probably
56:35 - just have to fill
56:37 - out let's see map post
56:42 - ey we'll just put in some data here just
56:45 - to give it something to Loop over uh but
56:48 - at some point we'll have to decide how
56:50 - we're going to import the data which
56:51 - will basically just be um the image
56:55 - urls Pro probably the name too so we can
56:58 - give it a nice title um attribute uh
57:00 - maybe alt attribute as
57:03 - well okay so sorry for the weirdness
57:06 - going on here my um I have some package
57:09 - for my editor that's autof formatting
57:11 - things as I go along and occasionally it
57:14 - it gets weird uh right now it's getting
57:16 - weird because I never closed out this
57:18 - element there we go now it's yeah there
57:21 - we go that's
57:24 - better okay
57:27 - yeah so let's try to see if we can get
57:28 - something on the
57:30 - screen uh so I'm going to bring over
57:34 - from uh the code that is on my other
57:37 - screen now that I showed you earlier uh
57:39 - from our previous
57:42 - project uh I'll bring
57:44 - over some of the stuff let's
57:51 - see I need to find it it's it's quite a
57:54 - large component
57:57 - all right there are
58:24 - tabs sorry I'm
58:26 - scrolling through this file and I cannot
58:28 - find where it there it is
58:37 - finally actually I'm going
58:40 - to yeah let me
58:44 - umate
58:48 - data all right I'll pull this in this is
58:51 - going to be a bit more than I wanted to
58:52 - start out with uh in terms of complexity
58:55 - but
58:57 - why not we we'll pull it in and get it
58:59 - get everything working here uh
59:04 - so I have I'm going to pull in every so
59:08 - we have a
59:14 - row we're going to have a row
59:18 - for our
59:24 - tabs and we're going to put that
59:29 - above so we're going to have to make a
59:31 - container right so if if you've never
59:33 - worked with react before you can't have
59:35 - two components two sibling components
59:38 - side by side uh within this return um it
59:42 - it has to be wrapped in one so that's
59:44 - why we're wrapping
59:45 - it uh for right now I'm
59:49 - just I'm not going to name it or
59:53 - anything this is going to be where our
59:56 - Tabs
59:58 - go and
60:01 - then let's make another
60:04 - row and that's where we're going to
60:07 - insert all our masonry
60:13 - stuff all right cool and the um
60:16 - Instagram live stream has ended that'll
60:20 - be available for the next 24 hours if
60:22 - anyone wants to watch the recording of
60:24 - it
60:26 - uh so thanks thanks for joining uh if
60:29 - you if you joined in um okay so let me
60:34 - let just briefly let you know what's
60:36 - going on here I think there's one more
60:38 - thing that I'll have to bring over to
60:39 - make this work uh but what we're doing
60:42 - is uh
60:45 - pulling basically adding in all the tabs
60:48 - that we're going to need uh so we are
60:51 - going to have
60:52 - to put something in state uh for this to
60:57 - go uh to go through and uh put each one
61:00 - of these
61:01 - in we're this is using the materialized
61:04 - version of tabs so we we probably are
61:06 - going to have to redo this a bit because
61:08 - I would rather use the material UI
61:11 - version uh if if I can if it works uh
61:15 - for this uh for this use
61:18 - case but for now this is just going to
61:22 - make the
61:24 - tabs this then is going to make rows
61:29 - actually yeah I can't do
61:36 - that so I'm glad I saw this so basically
61:39 - this is going to generate rows so we
61:40 - don't want to put this in its own row uh
61:43 - it's going to generate rows for each tab
61:46 - so every tab will have its own
61:49 - corresponding row so that when you click
61:52 - on a tab that row will will show up will
61:56 - become visible each one of these
61:58 - components these masonry each one of
62:01 - these rows will be populated with the
62:05 - the images the masonry
62:07 - components uh that belong to that
62:11 - particular
62:13 - category okay so hopefully that that
62:16 - made a little bit of sense to you uh but
62:19 - we do need so you can see here like we
62:22 - we have nothing uh in terms of rows do
62:26 - we have
62:31 - type yeah we'll need uh we need to add
62:33 - some things in for this to
62:45 - work let's
62:54 - see
63:05 - okay so we need
63:07 - [Music]
63:11 - our actually I I put this in the wrong
63:14 - place
63:17 - so we had originally uh we had these
63:20 - things inside our
63:22 - render so let me get rid of this
63:28 - there we go okay that looks better makes
63:32 - more sense did I leave off yeah I left
63:34 - this
63:43 - off okay so
63:45 - now wow
63:47 - this this formatting will be fixed when
63:50 - we go to commit so it's it's a little
63:53 - bit terrible right now um
63:56 - so here's where we're going to where we
63:58 - have our tabs so right now uh these are
64:00 - the tab names for our other project so
64:03 - we will change
64:05 - those but you can see we're getting the
64:09 - active tab name from this state okay so
64:14 - right now it's
64:15 - all and that's that's what we want to
64:17 - keep it so that's that doesn't need to
64:19 - change uh and then where we have the
64:23 - tabs so just key value pairs uh for all
64:26 - of our tabs so we'll leave it like this
64:28 - for now uh we'll put in the proper
64:31 - names uh in a little
64:35 - bit all right
64:37 - so our masonry
64:40 - component is filtering based on the
64:44 - active
64:46 - tab uh
64:54 - value
65:07 - and okay then once it's filtered then it
65:10 - goes over everything uh we're getting
65:13 - that right now from data so what we need
65:16 - to do
65:19 - then let's provide some
65:21 - [Music]
65:24 - data
65:26 - yeah let's provide some data just to to
65:29 - get this working so all we're going to
65:31 - need right now at least uh let's see
65:35 - some OB objects um
65:39 - with with the type ACF type let's remove
65:44 - this ACF because that was unique to um
65:46 - the WordPress
65:48 - API uh with the the particular way we
65:51 - had it set up so let's do Post
65:54 - type
66:01 - okay so we'll just have
66:09 - type
66:14 - and we're going to have this
66:20 - objects Shing think how the data came
66:22 - through in WordPress that we had it set
66:24 - up um
66:26 - it would have just been an array of
66:27 - objects okay uh
66:30 - so let's do
66:34 - typ
66:40 - and
66:52 - audio didn't copy at all
67:08 - okay okay so this should at least give
67:10 - us one at least one in each
67:12 - category uh so something for it to Loop
67:16 - over um do we need type we may not even
67:19 - need this I'm not going to take it out
67:22 - right now uh but I don't think we need
67:24 - it
67:27 - okay so this
67:29 - image I'm just going to double check
67:31 - that this image is actually going to
67:33 - work on my other screen yes it will okay
67:45 - greats okay so we have tabs
67:49 - great Tab
67:54 - Key
67:56 - okay so one thing that's not going to
67:58 - work uh for now is uh obviously we're
68:02 - not initiating this um and we haven't
68:06 - pulled in any of the Styles or
68:08 - JavaScript to make this work so let's
68:10 - see how it looks I don't really expect
68:11 - it to look great but something should
68:14 - come on uh to the
68:16 - screen and we are going to have a
68:18 - default by default it should show
68:24 - everything okay yeah let's save it we'll
68:26 - see what
68:30 - happens let's
68:34 - see now where did I put
68:41 - it I guess
68:49 - I I can't find where I moved everything
68:52 - to sorry about that give me a
69:00 - minute oh well I'll just go to Local
69:07 - Host and let's use that
69:12 - 9,000 all right now let's check out
69:14 - logos and
69:15 - see not 100% sure we're it's going to
69:18 - look good
69:20 - here actually
69:24 - out Loos what did we
69:35 - do actually not seeing anything at all
69:38 - that's not good uh probably just syntax
69:42 - error yeah it's a
69:45 - syntax unexpected
69:47 - token it's a syntax error but it does
69:49 - it's not actually telling me very
69:54 - much
70:24 - h
70:27 - it's
70:32 - OD yeah for some
70:41 - reason that's really odd um for some
70:45 - reason my server is just
70:48 - not
70:54 - responding
70:55 - and it doesn't really say that anything
70:57 - happened so let's let's try to start the
71:00 - server
71:15 - again what did I
71:23 - do all right so
71:25 - Patrick says I should run yarn run
71:40 - lint all right well now at least we'll
71:47 - get we'll get
71:49 - some
71:50 - messages uh about what could be the
71:53 - problem card title was used CL on is use
71:56 - logos
72:00 - oh I'm not using
72:02 - these so that's
72:05 - something and what else did we
72:09 - have the react jsx space before closing
72:13 - Ru is
72:16 - depreciated all right I'm not really
72:19 - sure what this is all
72:23 - about but at least I can verify that I
72:26 - fixed the other problems which I mean I
72:28 - know I did
72:32 - but okay so I'm getting this
72:40 - thing uh I'm going to paste this uh in
72:43 - on my other screen just do a
72:54 - search
73:09 - all right so the first two links are not
73:11 - giving me great uh information or
73:14 - solution to that
73:17 - um let's
73:21 - see at least we have some nice
73:23 - formatting now so as you can see we the
73:26 - auto formatting worked uh like it was
73:29 - supposed
73:32 - to all right well let's at
73:35 - least uh give this a
73:54 - shot
74:10 - okay let's see all right I'm going to go
74:13 - to the live chat and see what you all
74:15 - [Music]
74:23 - think all right I'll try Port 3000 as
74:27 - well yeah nothing uh Port 3000 is not
74:31 - giving me anything
74:33 - either Dion says um I thought I saw a
74:37 - masonry spelled with two s's in your
74:40 - file yeah it is filled with two s's
74:45 - um so that was yeah that was from the
74:48 - the original pool request and I just
74:49 - never changed
74:53 - it yeah
74:58 - so it doesn't it doesn't really bother
75:01 - me I know what it's I know what's going
75:02 - on
75:04 - um if it bothers anybody that that's uh
75:07 - misspelled I will accept your pull
75:09 - request if you really want to change
75:12 - it
75:14 - um otherwise it works I'm fine with it
75:17 - well it did work it's not working right
75:23 - now
75:48 - H this is
75:49 - [Music]
75:53 - odd
76:23 - for
76:33 - Okay cool so uh I got it started
76:37 - here so not sure what the issue was I
76:40 - supposed to have an ALT prop okay so
76:42 - we're getting a warning here about
76:43 - having an ALT prop which we were going
76:45 - to put in an ALT prop anyway uh on that
76:48 - image element so uh not a big deal I'm
76:51 - not exactly sure what so in in case Cas
76:55 - you haven't been watching the last uh
76:56 - few days uh we actually had like two
77:00 - different servers running uh and to test
77:03 - out our form and the uploads we're
77:06 - running things on Local Host
77:09 - 9,000 uh but then originally with create
77:12 - react app uh we had things running on
77:15 - 3,000 so we basically the 3,000 seems to
77:19 - be working uh the 9,000 wasn't can
77:23 - double check yeah for some reason it's
77:25 - not uh
77:27 - but we can try to figure that out later
77:31 - for now hey look at this we got
77:35 - logos Okay cool
77:38 - so the images aren't
77:41 - working I wonder what they're giving us
77:43 - is it a
77:45 - um fail to load
77:53 - resource the it's really odd not exactly
77:56 - sure why that resource failed to load
77:59 - but uh so you can see
78:02 - um we have so our Tabs are
78:06 - populating and then we had four elements
78:09 - like four objects in our array for our
78:12 - data and we see four here uh now I don't
78:16 - expect these actually did it work cool
78:19 - okay so this actually does work uh
78:22 - basically because we were doing this
78:24 - kind of thing right with uh with State
78:27 - uh in our component uh but you can see
78:30 - the
78:31 - Styles don't work uh which was expected
78:35 - uh but we should have like audio should
78:37 - have two text and video should have one
78:40 - element okay great so all that's
78:43 - working uh so let's see if we can make
78:46 - it look a little bit nicer first thing I
78:49 - want to do is check out material UI and
78:51 - see what they have in terms of
78:53 - tabs
78:55 - uh if they have something that's awesome
78:57 - then I'm willing to switch otherwise uh
79:00 - it might not be that big of a deal to
79:02 - just take what we have now add a few
79:05 - styles to it uh and I think it could
79:08 - work the only thing I'm worried about is
79:11 - uh we have quite a few
79:14 - options so I'd
79:18 - like I'm considering changing how this
79:22 - this works uh because that's it's a lot
79:25 - of options to just have right across the
79:27 - top of the screen so let me try to find
79:30 - where I
79:32 - had the example of the live site
79:35 - now uh just to show
79:38 - you in case
79:43 - um in case you don't remember whoops it
79:45 - looks like it logged me out so I'm going
79:47 - log back
79:49 - in uh hey good news about this so I'm
79:53 - you know a lot of you expressed your
79:55 - opinions as to um how terrible this
79:58 - currently
79:59 - looks I I hope that soon we'll be hiring
80:03 - a new web developer uh in the IT
80:05 - department and they handle this site uh
80:09 - so basically the first task of this
80:13 - person will be to uh start redesigning
80:16 - this according to basically the styles
80:20 - that that I tell them to try to match up
80:23 - with what else we're doing so hopefully
80:25 - that'll be looking
80:26 - better sometime within the next few
80:28 - months so haven't hired anybody yet but
80:31 - I did uh we had a phone interview with
80:32 - another candidate earlier
80:34 - today so hopefully we get
80:37 - it logos okay yeah so one two three four
80:42 - five
80:45 - six so like 12 plus we'll probably want
80:48 - to add an all so I have like 12 or 13
80:52 - across the top which is we use used a
80:55 - really small font to basically to make
80:57 - it work I don't like doing that CU it's
81:00 - hard to read okay I couldn't remember
81:02 - how I got did this before so we do
81:04 - actually
81:06 - use a drop down at some
81:13 - point all right that's not
81:16 - bad actually let me know what you think
81:18 - uh my pomodora timer just went off so
81:20 - I'm going to go to the live chat in a
81:22 - second uh but let me know what you think
81:25 - do you like that it's it's spread out
81:28 - across the
81:29 - top like that in a row and then it goes
81:33 - you know to
81:35 - this or do you think it should stay as a
81:39 - drop down all the
81:42 - time uh you know is this just too much
81:45 - and is the font too
81:47 - small so I'm not
81:51 - sure um it's nice to be able to see all
81:54 - the categories I guess all at
81:59 - once so anyway I'm undecided uh let me
82:03 - know what you all think let me turn
82:06 - on turn on the timer for five minutes
82:10 - and check the time
82:13 - 422 what time do we start
82:18 - this yeah we'll probably do I probably
82:21 - won't do a complete Pomodoro cycle I
82:23 - think what'll went up doing is just do a
82:25 - little bit of styling uh to make it look
82:28 - a bit better um and I I kind of just
82:31 - really want to uh use a little bit of
82:34 - the um use some sass because it's been a
82:38 - long time since I used it so uh but
82:40 - otherwise it's starting to get um about
82:43 - time for me to leave work
82:45 - so uh probably maybe
82:48 - do 10 more minutes of coating after this
82:51 - I would say maybe give or take a few
82:59 - minutes all right so David asks uh how
83:02 - do you get night mode on
83:04 - GitHub um what's the
83:07 - package H why do I always forget
83:17 - this it is called GitHub dark so uh just
83:23 - search for GitHub dark and then check
83:25 - out the uh options for um installing it
83:28 - I am using it with tamper monkey uh so
83:31 - I'm running the scripts uh as soon as
83:34 - the site loads with tamper monkey to set
83:37 - all this
83:46 - up uh Gavin says why I have nodon as a
83:49 - dependency I'm thinking it should be
83:51 - more of a Dev dependency uh if it needs
83:54 - to be in
83:55 - there
83:59 - um yeah
84:05 - actually I think you might I think you
84:08 - might be right
84:12 - Gavin
84:15 - and yeah now that I think about it am am
84:17 - I missing something is there some uh is
84:20 - there some reason why node Manon should
84:22 - be a dependency in not a Dev
84:25 - dependency uh maybe I'm missing
84:28 - something here but it I'm thinking it
84:30 - could be a a Dev
84:48 - dependency all right so David's asking
84:50 - about electron so if you notice uh
84:52 - electron is is here under depend
84:56 - encies and
85:00 - um let's
85:08 - see
85:09 - [Music]
85:13 - electron is for sorry I'm looking
85:15 - through because I think this question
85:17 - just got answered uh are we using
85:19 - electron for
85:23 - test
85:25 - I'm G to see when did we add
85:29 - that I have to go back through because
85:31 - we've had quite a few pull request so
85:34 - um I'll have to check and see where we
85:37 - we actually added that
85:53 - in
86:12 - so it looks like electron didn't get
86:14 - added
86:18 - until actually that was Gavin's pool
86:22 - request anyways so uh I'm not sure if
86:25 - Gavin's still watching or if he's back
86:29 - but it looks like that last pull request
86:32 - that that you added was uh electron so
86:35 - maybe you would be uh better equipped
86:38 - to uh to answer
86:53 - that
87:15 - okay it looks like
87:17 - uh show the categories we can so it
87:20 - looks like the way we're doing it
87:22 - currently live with the uh categories
87:24 - across the top and then when we get to a
87:26 - smaller screen it shifts to uh um a drop
87:30 - down uh it looks like that's what we're
87:33 - going to go with uh that's what seems
87:36 - like everybody has agreed on
87:53 - that
87:58 - oh okay all right thanks Gavin uh for
88:01 - answering so uh basically uh so Gavin
88:05 - added in
88:06 - electron
88:08 - um in the pool request because there are
88:12 - errors on the test saying that uh
88:16 - electron needed to be installed
88:19 - so we
88:23 - um that's actually that's
88:26 - interesting we are going to have to sort
88:28 - out there have been some some errors
88:31 - happening um with some different people
88:34 - so we're going to have to sort out
88:35 - what's going on with that I haven't well
88:38 - with the exception of today I've never
88:40 - really had any errors with the test uh
88:42 - so I haven't really been able to uh
88:44 - replicate anything
88:47 - but might have to sort that
88:52 - out okay so my 5 minutes are up let's do
88:58 - I'm not going to do a full actually I'm
89:01 - going to set this for 10 minutes uh and
89:04 - just we'll do a bit of
89:09 - styling uh let's check
89:14 - out material UI uh I always type
89:23 - in
89:25 - I can't
89:30 - spell there we go all right this is what
89:33 - I wanted let's
89:37 - see
89:39 - TS see what the tabs look
89:51 - like all right not really sure
89:56 - I'm not really sure if these Tabs are
89:58 - really are what we
90:07 - want uh just usually you don't we have a
90:10 - lot of items uh I've don't think I've
90:14 - ever seen that many items uh in tabs for
90:18 - material
90:19 - design so I don't I just don't think
90:22 - that's going to look great
90:28 - so maybe we should try to just style
90:30 - these a bit uh on our own and see uh see
90:34 - how it
90:36 - looks
90:38 - so let's take
90:46 - our let's make a um a SAS file for
90:52 - this
91:01 - Styles
91:02 - let
91:04 - Styles
91:09 - um Okay so we've made through the
91:12 - command line we've made this file so we
91:14 - did the touch command and then specified
91:17 - the directory and then the file name uh
91:20 - so now we can see our file
91:24 - here logos okay so within this now we
91:28 - can uh edit this let me see what our
91:33 - class names we're using so for right now
91:37 - the tabs are what I want to focus
91:42 - on
91:52 - um okay so we have
91:56 - and just allies in
92:03 - there
92:07 - okay so let's check out Dev tools
92:12 - um this is probably common but uh I I
92:17 - find it helpful to when I'm not exactly
92:20 - sure what I want to do uh to use Dev
92:24 - tools to change some of the Styles just
92:26 - so I can immediately see what's
92:30 - happening uh and then once I figure out
92:34 - about what I want to do then I go back
92:35 - to the actual file uh and start making
92:38 - some changes uh but for now I mean we're
92:41 - already getting some of the behavior we
92:42 - want so uh it's it's already displaying
92:46 - in a
92:46 - row uh which is
92:52 - good
92:58 - we do want
93:00 - to let's
93:04 - see list
93:06 - [Music]
93:12 - style actually what is
93:18 - this type that's what we
93:21 - want none okay Okay so we've done list
93:24 - style type none that got rid of our
93:27 - little uh our little dots there our
93:30 - little
93:33 - discs so we definitely want to do
93:39 - that where's this UL
93:42 - tabs uh so we can go back here and let's
93:45 - just say um tabs so I did have somebody
93:49 - earlier say how do we uh style an
93:51 - element with a class not sure if you're
93:54 - still around but uh this is how you do
93:57 - it so we have the class name of tabs on
94:01 - this UL so now we're going to say
94:05 - tabs and list style
94:09 - type
94:12 - none right and
94:14 - now we have
94:17 - just uh styled that and you can see um
94:21 - we actually it's automatically created
94:24 - the CSS file so that SAS is compiling
94:27 - now so if we go here we can see now it's
94:31 - CSS we haven't really done anything
94:33 - that's SAS specific so it's pretty much
94:35 - exactly the same
94:38 - um just have this s on line uh but if we
94:41 - had done something that was kind of a
94:43 - SAS only thing it would have compiled a
94:46 - valid CSS uh
94:50 - immediately okay so we have our tabs
94:56 - unstyled uh let's see I do want these to
95:01 - be so let's check out our Lis uh so
95:04 - right now we have some
95:09 - column some column classes being applied
95:12 - to the
95:14 - Allies so let's remove
95:18 - those and see what we're left
95:20 - with I don't want to have to fight the
95:23 - column classes uh I'd rather start with
95:25 - less and then build
95:29 - up okay that's so that's what was
95:33 - happening oops I didn't import the uh uh
95:37 - CSS file so we need to do that uh let me
95:41 - go to another page just so I can copy it
95:44 - uh where we
95:52 - have
95:55 - no I don't want it from index I want it
96:01 - from there we
96:10 - go okay so we do need to import that
96:13 - file that CSS
96:18 - file okay and doing it like this uh what
96:21 - it it helps keep every
96:24 - uh kind of you have really small easy to
96:26 - read files uh if you name them uh in a
96:30 - decent way then you should be able to
96:32 - immediately know what they're for so in
96:34 - this case uh our files are
96:37 - named um for the most part uh after what
96:42 - they're what they're doing like either
96:44 - what um element or component or even
96:47 - view that they go with so it's pretty
96:52 - straightforward um
96:54 - it looks a little bit nicer than having
96:55 - one giant uh CSS file uh it's easier to
97:00 - find things
97:03 - in okay so you see now it's applied that
97:06 - we don't have those little um little
97:10 - discs and we've also gotten rid of those
97:15 - styles for the
97:19 - column
97:22 - and
97:26 - so we have our list and it's now in a
97:29 - row we don't want it in a
97:33 - row let's
97:36 - see display
97:38 - block this is such a common thing that I
97:41 - I have to do and I can never
97:47 - remember there we go I always can never
97:50 - remember how to get it to work um
97:55 - um class
97:59 - tab let's do something SAS specific So
98:02 - within tabs we're going to put
98:05 - Tab and put float
98:09 - left okay so obviously you can't do this
98:13 - in regular
98:15 - CSS so it compiles to this which is
98:19 - proper
98:22 - CSS
98:25 - I shouldn't say compiles that's not
98:27 - really the right term
98:36 - right okay so now you can see we have
98:38 - the Styles
98:40 - here uh let's give a bit of
98:50 - padding so let's give it eight pixels
98:52 - all around
98:55 - and actually what do I want
99:02 - tab I'm going to give it eight pixels
99:04 - all
99:06 - around
99:08 - and I do I do want a margin as well so
99:11 - the the reason being so the padding will
99:14 - actually uh be like clickable area uh
99:18 - but the space that's margin will
99:21 - not um well
99:25 - we should probably put it on
99:28 - here yeah let's get rid of that um let's
99:33 - put our
99:34 - padding
99:39 - here because that's really what we
99:40 - wanted I want to maintain that that
99:43 - clickability here so you see that the
99:46 - target will be larger so if somebody
99:49 - doesn't exactly get on there it'll still
99:51 - work okay
99:55 - uh and then on the
99:58 - LI we'll add a
100:03 - margin uh and I don't want any top or
100:05 - bottom margin so I'm going to give it
100:07 - zero there and then let's go another
100:09 - eight pixels on the
100:13 - sides so you see it it looks now
100:18 - uh let me zoom in it's easier to see
100:25 - all right so you can see we have on each
100:27 - one eight pixels of padding all around
100:31 - and then uh eight pixels of margin on
100:33 - the left and the right so that should
100:37 - give enough of a Target so that remember
100:39 - this is only going to be desktop now so
100:41 - we don't have to worry about a tap
100:42 - Target otherwise we would want to be
100:44 - bigger like more like 40 48
100:48 - pixels um but since this is going to be
100:51 - for a mouse we can get away with smaller
100:54 - uh but that should be enough it should
100:56 - be very uh easy to click uh and then
100:59 - also because we have that padding in
101:00 - between so there'll be a 16 pixel Gap in
101:03 - between each one uh
101:06 - where uh so that people won't
101:09 - accidentally click or at least it'll be
101:11 - a little bit more difficult to
101:12 - accidentally click uh one that you
101:16 - didn't mean to
101:17 - click all right
101:21 - um the last thing
101:27 - call all right let's let's just uh put
101:30 - this in so under the tab we want a
101:34 - margin
101:35 - 0
101:38 - 8 and then within the tab we're going to
101:41 - have that a tag and we want that to have
101:45 - padding of eight
101:47 - pixels we going to save that I also want
101:50 - to see what will happen if I I
101:55 - put what do I want to
101:58 - Center I want to see what happens if I
102:00 - try to
102:03 - Center I don't know if I brought I'm not
102:06 - sure I brought this class over from
102:07 - materialized we'll see in a second um
102:14 - Center I didn't so let's go with
102:21 - um so here's another way to style react
102:24 - components you can actually just put a
102:26 - style tag and then drop down into
102:28 - JavaScript by putting the brackets in
102:29 - there and then make an object uh and
102:33 - then that object will then be your
102:36 - CSS uh so in this case I want to do text
102:42 - align and that needs to be camel
102:45 - cased
102:47 - and
102:52 - Center
102:56 - and let's
102:58 - see okay and that has that done anything
103:01 - no it
103:04 - hasn't so what I'll need to do what I
103:06 - want to accomplish is to have this stuff
103:09 - centered uh
103:15 - so I need to do something with
103:22 - this
103:36 - trying to think I did this uh somewhat
103:39 - recently I had the same issue I'm trying
103:41 - to remember what I ended up
103:48 - doing all right my time's probably about
103:50 - up let me double check before I oh yeah
103:52 - it is a
103:53 - I must not have heard the uh the beeping
103:56 - so anyway just to let you know what the
103:59 - next step uh that I wanted to do is uh
104:02 - have this be centered uh
104:06 - so probably going to do some type
104:10 - of
104:12 - um some type of centering
104:20 - like Z Auto
104:24 - maybe uh but then I'll need to give it a
104:26 - w so I need to do like
104:28 - with
104:30 - um I don't know
104:33 - 15% so I could do something like that I
104:35 - don't really want to do that
104:43 - though yeah it's not now I remember the
104:47 - issue that I had before was that if you
104:48 - try to do the
104:50 - float uh then you can't get s so like
104:53 - right now it's obviously centered but I
104:55 - was doing the
104:57 - float um to get it to to all line up
105:03 - so what I can't remember how I how I fix
105:07 - that anyway uh use display Flex in the
105:11 - line Center oh okay so drron says use
105:14 - display
105:16 - flex and then align Center or Center
105:19 - content
105:21 - items okay cool off to try that display
105:24 - in line oh yeah excuse display in
105:30 - line there we
105:32 - go Sebastian awesome that's what it is
105:36 - okay so
105:37 - that's that's what I was looking for
105:40 - that's how I um I'm pretty sure that's
105:42 - how I solved it previously okay so um
105:45 - display in line probably the flex thing
105:48 - would have worked as well
105:51 - um but but if we add display inline and
105:55 - I don't think we need to
105:57 - do do we need to keep that we don't need
106:01 - that do we need this yep okay so we need
106:04 - textaline Center uh on this
106:08 - div uh or can we put it on the
106:12 - UL okay we can get away with putting it
106:15 - on the UL so let's do that
106:19 - um and that's nicer uh to put it lower
106:22 - down anyway and then we don't have to
106:24 - add another element uh and then on the
106:26 - tabs itself we'll go uh display
106:34 - inline we'll save that and let's get rid
106:37 - of this this Center uh we don't need
106:41 - that and then also this which I mean
106:43 - that was good for demonstration to put
106:45 - that in if you need to uh but since we
106:47 - have that separate CSS file I'd rather
106:49 - have everything in
106:51 - there um so here we go what did I miss
106:56 - text line
106:58 - Center the float we got to get rid of
107:00 - the
107:03 - float there we go okay so we have
107:05 - everything centered lined up I like the
107:07 - amount of spacing uh and padding uh the
107:11 - tech size I kind of really would like to
107:14 - go bigger on the tech size uh so we'll
107:17 - see about that um possibly also
107:21 - different on
107:23 - we we'll have to see uh some more
107:26 - styling about how we want to do that but
107:29 - not bad definitely looks better than it
107:31 - was uh so that's a good
107:34 - start yeah good
107:37 - start
107:39 - um probably not going to commit this
107:42 - right now because I was getting all
107:43 - those errors before so well why not
107:46 - let's let's see if we can commit and um
107:49 - not get the errors we didn't really do
107:50 - anything to fix them so uh probably
107:53 - will'll get him again but we'll see so
107:54 - let's do a get
107:57 - status and when we do get status it'll
108:00 - show us everything that we've changed uh
108:02 - and everything we've we've added so test
108:05 - upload
108:08 - txt how did I do a text test upload
108:21 - txt
108:40 - H I'm not sure how the test upload got
108:43 - in
108:49 - there all right so definitely don't want
108:51 - to commit that
108:58 - okay um so we definitely did change
109:01 - these so that's what um it's good idea
109:04 - um I always do it and usually it's not I
109:07 - really necessary but I do like to do a
109:10 - get status before I commit uh especially
109:13 - if I've been working for a while um in
109:15 - case I've forgotten that I changed
109:18 - something or if I inadvertently changed
109:21 - something and didn't realize it so now
109:23 - all these files look good I um I have
109:26 - actually worked on each one of these
109:29 - actually service
109:33 - request actually I'm not really sure
109:35 - what I did in service
109:39 - requests uh where's it
109:44 - at so let's check it
109:50 - out huh that's OD usually usually it
109:53 - will show me on the side a different
109:55 - color for the lines that have changed
109:57 - and it looks like nothing's
110:05 - changed uh so you can do a get diff to
110:07 - see what's changed
110:09 - so uh this is logos which it's fine we
110:12 - know a lot of stuff Chang in
110:20 - logos service request
110:40 - it looks like just formatting so
110:45 - probably probably when we ran that uh
110:48 - that command just to do some formatting
110:50 - it probably just reformatted something
110:52 - in there
111:00 - so yeah so nothing actually changed it
111:03 - just got rearranged a
111:06 - bit okay that's cool I'm fine with
111:09 - that all right so I'm going to do a get
111:12 - add and then I'm going to put a period
111:14 - there and that's going to add everything
111:16 - so if we do our status again
111:17 - everything's green that means it's ready
111:19 - to go ready to be committed so we'll do
111:21 - a get commit
111:23 - uh M so we can put a message in line and
111:26 - we'll just
111:27 - say
111:31 - um
111:35 - add did
111:40 - we
111:50 - masonry two of those
111:53 - that's that's pretty much sums up what
111:55 - we've
111:57 - done so currently I have no standards on
112:00 - Commit messages for this project uh I'm
112:02 - thinking about making some sort of
112:04 - standard or or adopting some standard
112:07 - for commit messages from uh from
112:10 - somewhere else
112:13 - so uh might end up having some better
112:16 - messages here at some point uh but for
112:18 - now I just haven't decided on it uh
112:21 - currently in my course all right see we
112:24 - passed all the tests not really sure
112:26 - what was going on with that before um
112:29 - maybe it had something to do with the
112:30 - server so if you remember uh I had to
112:33 - restart the server
112:36 - so if I had to guess I'd say maybe it
112:38 - was something with that but we can see
112:40 - we passed all the
112:43 - tests uh let's push this
112:50 - up so now all that code is available in
112:53 - the repo on GitHub I'm going to go over
112:56 - to the live chat
112:59 - and uh answer any questions that you'll
113:02 - have in
113:07 - there uh so if you do have any questions
113:10 - please put them in the live chat now um
113:13 - I also take questions on any other uh
113:17 - social media platforms or even email uh
113:21 - if you have some question questions for
113:22 - me uh later on uh if you aren't
113:26 - interested in the question answer
113:27 - session you're just interested in the
113:28 - code the code portion is over so thank
113:30 - you so much for watching uh you can you
113:33 - can safely leave now uh most likely
113:36 - won't be doing any more
113:39 - coding um otherwise uh let's get to some
113:51 - questions
113:56 - all right so it looks like I've covered
113:58 - a decent amount of the chat already I've
114:00 - done a done a good job of sticking to
114:03 - the schedule of the Pomodoro sessions
114:21 - today
114:48 - okay it looks like there was some
114:48 - discussion about using uh the grid uh
114:51 - CSS grid
114:53 - layout so uh I'm probably not going to
114:57 - do that for this project since you know
114:59 - I've already have the uh masonry stuff
115:01 - set up uh so I know that works I like
115:04 - how that works so I'm open to using the
115:06 - grid uh elswhere if NE if we need it uh
115:11 - Patrick says that it's it's only at
115:13 - about 70% browser adoption right now so
115:18 - um maybe not uh at least for this unfort
115:22 - unfortunately there are a lot of
115:24 - computers on campus where people are
115:26 - using some really outdated browsers so I
115:28 - don't attempt to support the really
115:31 - outdated browsers uh and in fact I I
115:33 - think there's value in not supporting
115:35 - them to try to force up you to force
115:38 - them to update
115:40 - um uh especially for security issues of
115:42 - using browsers that old
115:46 - but uh I think I still would like to
115:49 - have uh have things look decent even on
115:53 - slightly older
115:57 - browsers uh but John Hansen does say if
116:00 - you use CSS fallbacks within the grid
116:02 - layout you can still use it in
116:04 - production
116:08 - so okay cool I mentioned earlier that I
116:11 - I was saying compile when I was talking
116:13 - about SAS and I mentioned I'm I'm pretty
116:15 - sure that's not the correct term so
116:17 - Sebastian says maybe transpile Alberto
116:19 - says transpile yeah I I think transpile
116:23 - is probably I mean I I use transpile
116:25 - when I'm talking about what Babel does
116:27 - with
116:28 - JavaScript um I mean SAS is a CSS
116:33 - pre-processor
116:36 - um
116:38 - yeah I don't know it doesn't really
116:40 - matter you all know what I'm talking
116:41 - about it takes the SAS and it turns it
116:44 - into CSS whatever you want to call that
116:46 - process uh that's what it
116:51 - does
116:55 - Kevin Uh Kevin had to leave the stream
116:58 - and watch it two times to catch up so
117:00 - awesome glad you caught
117:12 - up oh okay so that file that I wasn't
117:15 - sure about um was from a
117:19 - test uh and then Kevin says it gets
117:21 - deleted did when the test
117:30 - pass okay so probably what had happened
117:33 - since before I ran the test and I didn't
117:35 - pass them it was probably just left over
117:37 - from then so okay and I saw I
117:41 - think someone said Sebastian said add
117:45 - that to uh get ignore so yeah I should
117:47 - definitely do that and that'll just that
117:50 - way if it happens again I don't have to
117:51 - worry about
118:10 - it oh okay uh so max says the noise of
118:14 - my fan is annoying so sorry about that
118:17 - uh I didn't realize
118:20 - um is it can you you hear the fan a lot
118:23 - I had it on low I know I've done that
118:24 - before and it seemed to be okay so let
118:27 - me know if it was
118:29 - um uh if the fan was too much and uh
118:33 - I'll turn it off next
118:46 - time so it seems like Max Max said bye
118:49 - so I think Max isn't around anymore to
118:51 - let me know about the the fan noise but
118:56 - uh I'm actually okay with Max leaving
118:59 - because the fan noise is annoying it
119:00 - would have
119:01 - been uh it would have been much worse if
119:04 - they said like your voice is annoying or
119:06 - something because I can't really change
119:08 - that but I could definitely turn the fan
119:16 - off all right so I think I've got yeah
119:20 - I've gotten all the questions uh in the
119:22 - live chat hopefully I didn't miss any uh
119:25 - up near the top if I did I'm
119:27 - sorry um let's see Sebastian still
119:31 - having trouble passing the test all
119:33 - right we're going to have to try to get
119:34 - to the bottom of this and I know it's at
119:37 - least it's hard for me cuz I I can't I
119:40 - can't recreate the issues so it's really
119:42 - hard to try to work on them
119:44 - so
119:47 - um all right well we'll try to we try to
119:49 - figure that out but if anybody else else
119:52 - is having trouble if you clone the repo
119:55 - and try to pass the test if you're
119:56 - having trouble please um go to the issue
120:00 - uh in it's the only issue open right now
120:04 - uh in the repo
120:05 - so check out go to that issue and
120:08 - comment with any uh details you have
120:11 - like screenshots of what what's
120:12 - happening uh what system you're running
