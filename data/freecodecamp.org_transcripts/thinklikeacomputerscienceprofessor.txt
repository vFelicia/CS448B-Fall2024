00:00 - in this course radu will teach you how
00:01 - to think like a computer science
00:03 - professor radu has a phd in computer
00:06 - science he teaches computer science at a
00:08 - university as well as on his youtube
00:11 - channel in this course you will see
00:13 - radu's thought process as he codes a
00:16 - project for the very first time many
00:18 - tutorials show you how to build a
00:20 - project that the instructor has already
00:23 - fully thought out beforehand but in this
00:25 - video you will learn what really goes
00:27 - into building a project from scratch and
00:30 - he does it all without even referencing
00:32 - the internet leave a comment with any
00:34 - insights you learn from watching his
00:35 - thought process
00:38 - hi in this video you'll see how i made
00:41 - this avatar using just vanilla
00:43 - javascript and html canvas
00:46 - i made this while competing with samwell
00:48 - so
00:49 - it wasn't scripted and we didn't even
00:51 - know what project we're gonna do when we
00:53 - began
00:55 - so don't look at this as a tutorial
00:57 - because i do a lot of mistakes in it
01:00 - but i really think you should watch the
01:02 - video
01:03 - because it shows the thought process of
01:06 - how to
01:08 - solve a problem like this in the real
01:10 - world and tutorials are not like that
01:13 - tutorials just show
01:15 - step-by-step instructions
01:17 - of
01:18 - solving a problem and those were usually
01:21 - polished well before recording the
01:23 - tutorial so if you really want to be a
01:26 - better problem solver you should check
01:28 - it out
01:33 - so the project we're gonna do
01:36 - is going to be
01:39 - an avatar
01:40 - i'm going to make something that kind of
01:42 - looks like me and
01:45 - maybe is able to talk or or something
01:48 - let's see about that
01:50 - and
01:51 - i'm going to do this project in
01:56 - html and javascript so it's going to be
02:00 - like a web page
02:02 - and i'm also going to do this without
02:05 - using
02:08 - any kind of
02:10 - libraries
02:11 - or
02:13 - external code
02:15 - so the reason i want to do this now
02:18 - particularly
02:20 - is because i'm going up against
02:22 - somewhere and um
02:24 - let's just say that i am about twice as
02:27 - old as he is and even though i said i'm
02:30 - not gonna be
02:31 - pulling my punches
02:33 - um
02:34 - i think i need to set some additional
02:37 - rules for myself
02:39 - and these rules are going to be
02:42 - [Music]
02:44 - not to use other code this is something
02:47 - i normally do when i make my tutorials
02:49 - but in this case i'm going to definitely
02:52 - try not to look at other code and
02:54 - actually i'm not going to use
02:57 - the internet i'm just going to try to
02:59 - code this
03:01 - using what i remember about coding in
03:03 - javascript and
03:06 - let's see how this goes so
03:09 - i really think something like that is
03:11 - needed but
03:13 - having said that i won't
03:15 - hold anything back so let's see how this
03:19 - goes
03:20 - i begin with
03:21 - a simple html and
03:24 - in the body part
03:26 - i'm going to add the canvas
03:30 - element
03:31 - let's call it
03:34 - my canvas
03:36 - like this
03:38 - and let me close the body
03:40 - and
03:41 - if you are watching this it means that
03:44 - this video recording is pretty good
03:47 - even though
03:49 - this is unscripted and we just selected
03:51 - this project a moment ago
03:53 - so
03:55 - i think it's good for you to watch a
03:57 - video like this from time to time
03:59 - because even though it's very long it
04:01 - has something that normal tutorials
04:03 - don't have and that's
04:06 - showing how the thought process goes
04:09 - when building something like this so
04:11 - normally when you watch tutorials you
04:13 - see people
04:14 - doing something that they have done
04:16 - before and they have made made it
04:18 - previously and they just show you the
04:20 - final steps most of the time
04:23 - but you don't realize all the thought
04:26 - that went into it and all the
04:28 - experimentation and things like that
04:30 - so
04:31 - if you watch this now it means i decided
04:34 - to post this video because i think it
04:36 - has a lot of educational value in it
04:41 - even though it's
04:43 - far slower paced than my other
04:46 - tutorials
04:47 - so
04:48 - hope you'll like it
04:50 - now
04:52 - i'm gonna also talk when i do these
04:54 - things most of the time and
04:57 - it's going to slow me down a bit but
04:59 - i'm not going to talk normally like in
05:01 - other tutorials
05:03 - so
05:05 - if it's something important that i'm
05:07 - doing i will
05:09 - explain more more carefully what that is
05:14 - now
05:16 - i refreshed the page here in the browser
05:19 - on the right and i've actually opened
05:22 - the index.html file that i started
05:24 - defining here and you can see the
05:29 - tab has changed its name there to the
05:31 - title that i declared and the the canvas
05:34 - is added here inside this page it's just
05:39 - transparent and in the stop top region
05:43 - so
05:44 - let me start to
05:46 - define some javascript next and
05:49 - i'm going to do that here in a script
05:52 - tag
05:56 - i will use many external files at some
05:58 - point but in the beginning i just want
06:01 - to set up this html page somehow so i'm
06:05 - going to get access to this
06:10 - my canvas
06:14 - let's just call it canvas
06:24 - like this
06:25 - and
06:26 - i will set its width and height
06:31 - let's say 300 pixels
06:39 - many people also ask me
06:44 - why do i disable the helper tools
06:47 - from visual studio code
06:50 - like it's not doing any autocompleting
06:53 - for me or telling me if i have typos or
06:57 - things like that and that's mostly
06:58 - because when i do tutorials i want them
07:01 - to not interfere with what i'm coding at
07:04 - the moment so
07:05 - often those windows just block parts of
07:08 - the code that i might be explaining and
07:11 - it's not very good from a pedagogical
07:15 - standpoint
07:17 - so let me give also a style here to the
07:20 - canvas otherwise it's still transparent
07:23 - and we can't see it there
07:27 - so
07:28 - i'm gonna say that the canvas is going
07:30 - to have a
07:33 - border of one pixel
07:35 - solid and black
07:38 - like this and if i refresh
07:41 - now i see the canvas element
07:43 - here
07:46 - so
07:47 - let me also align this to
07:56 - center actually i'm going to keep it in
07:59 - the top left corner i i prefer it like
08:02 - that and i will remove this extra margin
08:05 - from here it's going to make some things
08:07 - easier
08:08 - as we go
08:10 - so let's say here margin zero
08:18 - and now you can see this canvas over
08:21 - there
08:22 - okay
08:23 - now
08:24 - on this canvas i'm going to draw a
08:26 - character and i'm going to make this
08:28 - character a procedural object so it's
08:31 - going to be drawn using mathematics and
08:33 - lines and curves and different kind of
08:35 - shapes and colors and things like that
08:38 - but i'm going to
08:39 - um a drawing i made of myself a long
08:42 - time ago which i'm using to
08:45 - brand my my channel as a as a reference
08:49 - so i add it now here
08:51 - inside of this
08:53 - visual studio code
08:55 - project
08:56 - and i'm going to actually draw this
09:00 - image this jpeg
09:03 - on the canvas for reference to begin
09:05 - with and then the lines that i'm going
09:06 - to draw are going to be things that
09:08 - define this
09:10 - this character here
09:13 - so let me
09:14 - go back here and get a reference to the
09:18 - context for drawing on the canvas and
09:21 - that will be
09:23 - get context and i'm going to be using
09:25 - this 2d context
09:29 - let's see if i have enough time and
09:31 - energy to make this avatar even 3d a
09:33 - little bit
09:34 - but
09:36 - at the moment
09:37 - ideas are plenty and
09:40 - i should stick to simple things and have
09:42 - something that works first and then
09:44 - expand somehow it's not not easy
09:48 - so with the context i'm going to draw
09:50 - the image
09:51 - uh
09:52 - draw image
09:54 - method
09:56 - uh
09:58 - i need to get the image first so let me
10:04 - get the image by saying
10:06 - [Music]
10:10 - new image and the source of this
10:14 - image is going to be me dot jpg it's
10:18 - here in the same directory
10:20 - and i'm going to draw this
10:22 - image
10:23 - at
10:25 - 0 0
10:27 - coordinates
10:28 - on the canvas so if i refresh now
10:38 - nothing happens
10:40 - let me try to give this a width and a
10:42 - height of
10:44 - canvas width and canvas height
10:52 - now
11:03 - so for some reason this doesn't work
11:05 - let's see
11:06 - is the image existing in memory
11:15 - yeah that should be there
11:18 - so here i'm getting the context and i
11:21 - have the image and i'm
11:25 - drawing the image
11:32 - maybe
11:33 - actually you don't have to specify the
11:36 - location there let's see
11:40 - now
11:57 - oh what is wrong
11:59 - so the image is there
12:02 - but if i try to draw it
12:09 - it doesn't appear on the canvas
12:12 - what if i just want to put it in the
12:15 - background of the canvas canvas um style
12:20 - no i can't do that
12:36 - okay
12:37 - so
12:38 - it actually exists and it's there but
12:41 - for some reason drawing it on the canvas
12:44 - doesn't work
12:50 - why
13:23 - okay so three arguments required
13:34 - i don't remember exactly
13:36 - all the
13:45 - all the parameters for this method
13:59 - can i draw anything else on this canvas
14:02 - let's see
14:03 - ctx
14:05 - move to
14:07 - begin path
14:10 - ctx move to
14:13 - zero zero ctx
14:15 - line to
14:17 - 300 300
14:20 - and ctx stroke
14:24 - okay so the line is just fine but then
14:28 - ctx draw image
14:33 - img
14:37 - i think this should draw it
14:41 - starting at the zero zero coordinate
14:43 - there so something is strange
15:09 - a tough start apparently i don't
15:12 - remember simple things like this even
15:16 - so
15:20 - canvas works and it's initialized
15:22 - properly but when i want to draw it
15:24 - it doesn't appear there so what are the
15:27 - arguments here
15:28 - if i just put a draw image it says that
15:31 - it needs
15:32 - two more arguments
15:40 - so
15:45 - can i get the hint of what is this
15:55 - of what methods are available draw image
16:33 - not very useful
17:09 - oh boy
17:15 - how can i have problems with things like
17:17 - this now i'm getting worried
17:21 - so
17:22 - there's no internet thing
17:25 - it's scaring me right now
17:28 - but
17:29 - something here needs to work so what is
17:32 - the problem
17:39 - it is the correct name of the function i
17:42 - saw it here when i looked at the
17:45 - functions available here
17:51 - so if i type here for example
17:55 - ctx draw image without calling it
18:02 - it shows his native code so it i can't
18:05 - inspect it
18:11 - at least i don't know how
18:19 - oh here i get some information so x y
18:24 - width and height
18:29 - oh okay
18:35 - there are multiple versions of this so
18:38 - one it's with the x and y and you
18:40 - specify also width and height so it
18:42 - should work
18:44 - with zero zero and
18:47 - for example 100 100
18:52 - what
18:53 - why does this
18:54 - ah
18:57 - the image is not loaded
19:04 - the image is not loaded i tried to draw
19:07 - it
19:08 - before the image had the time to load
19:13 - horrible start so
19:16 - uh
19:17 - now it works it's a small image there
19:20 - let's just put it here to be
19:22 - [Music]
19:24 - canvas
19:25 - width and
19:26 - canvas
19:28 - height
19:29 - like so
19:30 - and i don't need this line
19:34 - line 2 anymore this code right here
19:38 - phew i really started to be worried
19:40 - there for a moment now before i draw
19:43 - this i actually want to draw it
19:45 - transparent so global alpha set to 0.1
19:51 - and
19:53 - then i'm gonna reset global alpha to one
19:56 - afterwards
19:58 - uh two transparent maybe
20:01 - four
20:02 - okay and now i'm going to try to draw
20:05 - this shape
20:06 - using
20:10 - using lines and curves and things like
20:12 - that and i will start with the head
20:15 - but before i start guessing these
20:17 - coordinates is going to be horrible
20:21 - really
20:22 - so let's me
20:24 - i'm going to write some code that helps
20:27 - me take coordinates by clicking with the
20:29 - mouse first so i'm going to say
20:33 - canvas
20:35 - uh
20:37 - add event listener
20:41 - mouse
20:42 - down
20:44 - actually
20:46 - click i think it's better
20:49 - let's see if it works and um
20:54 - get
20:56 - chord minutes
20:58 - like this so a function for get chords
21:02 - uh with the event
21:05 - like this and let's just uh
21:08 - log here
21:11 - edt.x and evt
21:15 - dot y to see if the coordinates are
21:17 - correct
21:19 - and uh refresh this and now when i click
21:22 - this
21:24 - i'm getting
21:26 - 0 close to 0 0 in this corner
21:29 - close to 300 300 in that corner so
21:33 - clicking gives me the coordinates from a
21:36 - point that i
21:37 - clicked on there so this is going to be
21:39 - very useful
21:42 - and let me just prepare here a function
21:45 - called
21:46 - draw
21:47 - me
21:48 - for now
21:50 - code will become much better later when
21:52 - i
21:52 - figure out all the things i want to do
21:54 - with this so i'm going to figure out the
21:56 - end result of this
21:59 - avatar as i'm making it
22:03 - it's
22:04 - gonna depend on
22:05 - the things that i know how to do and
22:08 - also
22:10 - um the time that i have and things like
22:13 - that i have a meeting in about
22:15 - two hours a little after two hours over
22:18 - two hours so
22:21 - let's see if i continue after that so
22:23 - draw me
22:24 - here is going to be
22:29 - called after the image is loading and
22:31 - after i'm drawing it here on the canvas
22:33 - so here for example i could draw the
22:36 - head
22:38 - let's draw just a line first from this
22:41 - point right here to this point right
22:43 - here so these are the coordinates that
22:46 - i'm going to use
22:48 - i'm going to say ctx
22:51 - begin path
22:53 - um
22:55 - like that ctx move to
22:58 - 149
23:00 - 34
23:01 - and ctx line
23:04 - to
23:06 - 151
23:08 - two two zero
23:10 - like this
23:13 - ctx stroke
23:17 - like this
23:18 - and now if i refresh i'm gonna get a
23:21 - vertical line here like that so
23:24 - um you can see that this code is helping
23:28 - me so that when i click on the screen
23:31 - i get the coordinates and i don't have
23:33 - to guess these points
23:36 - by
23:38 - trial and error
23:39 - and of course i can
23:41 - fine tune these points for example i
23:43 - probably know that this should be
23:46 - actually 150 150 which is the middle of
23:50 - this
23:52 - canvas there so now the line is
23:54 - perfectly straight before it was a
23:56 - little bit off center because i made
23:58 - mistakes in my licking
24:00 - normally you want mistakes when you draw
24:02 - things like that because something with
24:05 - not perfect symmetry and
24:08 - if it looks a little bit different on
24:10 - one side than the other then the end
24:12 - result is better
24:14 - but
24:14 - for this first part i'm gonna stick to
24:18 - it like this
24:20 - and at the end we'll see about
24:21 - normalizing these coordinates somehow so
24:25 - we'll get to that hopefully
24:28 - okay so this kind of works let me reduce
24:32 - this transparency
24:34 - i mean make it even more transparent
24:38 - maybe
24:39 - like this
24:40 - okay i kind of like that
24:44 - thing right here
24:46 - uh
24:48 - okay
24:50 - so i have just one line let's add a new
24:53 - line to see also the width of the head
24:56 - here
24:57 - so
24:59 - something like this
25:22 - yeah i used 130 because i want it to be
25:26 - perfectly horizontal here like so
25:29 - and 75
25:31 - to 15 i think that these are
25:35 - proper pretty much
25:40 - so here i just want them to be on the
25:42 - other side of this 150 if
25:46 - this is going to be symmetric
25:48 - and i think it's actually not so 150
25:52 - minus
25:54 - 75 it's
25:55 - 75 150
25:58 - plus 75 is
26:00 - 225
26:01 - so
26:03 - let's
26:04 - make this
26:05 - fix it a little bit already
26:08 - so now you can see already that the
26:10 - initial drawing that i made of this
26:12 - avatar was not perfectly symmetrical and
26:16 - maybe i want it to be symmetrical at
26:18 - least for now
26:21 - okay
26:22 - but
26:23 - this is now somehow centering the head
26:25 - right there
26:27 - uh let's draw the shape of the head
26:30 - somehow
26:32 - so i'm gonna begin a new path
26:36 - and i'm going to draw a line
26:39 - from
26:40 - this point right here to this point
26:43 - right here next
26:47 - move to
26:49 - 150
26:50 - 34.
26:55 - and
26:57 - 75
27:00 - 1 3 0.
27:08 - okay but this line is going to be curved
27:11 - somehow so actually i'm not gonna use
27:13 - line two here
27:14 - i'm gonna use um
27:19 - quadratic
27:21 - curve
27:22 - to
27:23 - that point but for the quadratic curve i
27:25 - need to give a control point
27:28 - somewhere
27:32 - maybe somewhere here 80 46 let's try
27:36 - that
27:41 - okay this is pretty much
27:44 - what i would expect the
27:46 - head to look like there
27:51 - but i have a feeling that this quadratic
27:53 - curve is not good because it's going to
27:55 - give me pointy
27:57 - pointy things there
28:00 - um when i'm gonna
28:02 - mirror this on the other sides
28:05 - but actually
28:07 - even if it's well let's just try
28:09 - so i'm gonna do another quadratic curve
28:12 - too and let's add the control point
28:16 - here
28:17 - like
28:19 - 94
28:20 - and
28:22 - 196
28:24 - and then the end point is going to be
28:26 - this bottom one so 150 to 20.
28:30 - i should actually label these points as
28:33 - well so here if you can look it's a
28:35 - little bit pointy but eventually this is
28:38 - going to get covered by all this hair so
28:40 - i don't need to worry if it's not so
28:42 - perfect there so having this now i'm
28:45 - going to actually
28:47 - copy this
28:48 - on
28:50 - the right side
28:56 - and i don't really like these numbers
28:59 - they are becoming way too difficult to
29:02 - somehow
29:05 - calculate all the things so
29:07 - i'm not going to do anything anymore at
29:09 - this stage i'm actually going to scale
29:12 - this
29:13 - canvas so that
29:17 - the center point is going to be here so
29:20 - this is going to become the new 0 0
29:22 - coordinate and everything else is going
29:24 - to be
29:25 - symmetric like this point is symmetric
29:28 - to that but with minus and plus and the
29:31 - minus and plus here also
29:35 - um yeah let me do that so i'm going to
29:38 - say here
29:40 - [Music]
29:42 - not there but here
29:45 - ctx
29:46 - scale
29:48 - [Music]
30:02 - um
30:04 - okay
30:08 - and um
30:09 - ctx
30:11 - translate
30:12 - actually maybe i think this should be
30:14 - first and i'm gonna translate to
30:17 - canvas with divided by two
30:20 - canvas height divided by 2.
30:23 - so
30:25 - now things stopped working at the moment
30:31 - but it's ok
30:34 - let's see if this can
30:39 - be fixed somehow
30:41 - so we translate it to the middle of the
30:43 - canvas and we also scaled let's um
30:46 - not scale for the moment so yeah we
30:49 - translate it there but now this has to
30:52 - start at
30:53 - minus canvas with divided by two
31:05 - and minus canvas height divided by two
31:11 - okay
31:14 - if we scale
31:16 - like that
31:17 - then i think this now needs to be just
31:20 - one divided by two one divided by two
31:24 - one
31:25 - and one
31:27 - um actually
31:31 - yeah
31:32 - i think it's something like this
31:54 - yeah i did some mistake here i want to
31:56 - scale it up so that
31:58 - these values mean what i want them to
32:01 - mean but actually um
32:04 - i think i want to scale it like this
32:07 - sorry by
32:10 - half
32:12 - by half because i don't want to work
32:15 - with these half values here i actually
32:18 - prefer
32:20 - i think to work in the space from
32:23 - minus one to plus one so
32:26 - now when i'm drawing this this corner up
32:30 - here means
32:31 - uh
32:32 - minus one
32:35 - yeah it means minus one minus one and
32:37 - this one on the right is going to mean
32:40 - plus one plus one i have to fix also
32:42 - this get coordinates there
32:45 - but uh also these ones so
32:49 - this now means
32:51 - zero
32:55 - yeah
32:56 - so all these coordinates i actually want
32:59 - to
33:01 - subtract
33:03 - 150
33:04 - and
33:06 - divide by
33:10 - 150
33:12 - so a little bit work to do here but it's
33:15 - going to make the numbers easier to work
33:17 - with afterwards you'll see
33:20 - so
33:23 - the 150s become zero
33:26 - zero zero
33:28 - zero
33:29 - and then
33:31 - three four minus one fifty
33:40 - 077 with the minus
33:44 - then
33:47 - 220 minus 150
34:05 - 46
34:09 - like that
34:11 - then
34:11 - [Music]
34:12 - 75
34:28 - and i actually know that this one is
34:30 - going to be plus 0.5
34:33 - because it was symmetric to begin with
34:36 - and this 130
34:54 - minus
34:56 - 0.13
35:04 - okay
35:05 - so
35:06 - i think this is correct
35:10 - and i can replace also these ones
35:13 - and
35:14 - this 75 was actually
35:20 - this one i think
35:26 - i'm gonna need new
35:29 - new coordinates for that let me just
35:31 - comment out these
35:35 - oh
35:36 - interesting something happened
35:44 - happened
35:58 - i'm not drawing any fill i think what
36:00 - happens is that the
36:04 - line with
36:09 - yeah the line with is very very
36:12 - thick now because of that scaling i did
36:14 - previously so actually i would like to
36:17 - do the stroke
36:20 - or let me just ctx line with
36:26 - something very small and work with that
36:29 - okay i think this is
36:32 - just fine now
36:34 - and for these i'm gonna need new
36:36 - coordinates and i rewrite that but after
36:39 - i fix this part right here so i want
36:42 - this to log
36:45 - the x
36:46 - minus
36:48 - canvas
36:52 - width divided by two
36:59 - and then
37:01 - divided by canvas
37:04 - width
37:07 - divided by two so something like that
37:10 - this is going to now give me
37:20 - the coordinates when i click on the
37:21 - canvas
37:23 - so that
37:26 - it's already scaled in this new space
37:29 - that i'm dealing with so this one here
37:31 - should be close to minus 1 1
37:34 - this one here
37:35 - one one
37:36 - and this
37:38 - thing in the middle should be
37:40 - pretty much zero zero
37:42 - like this and um
37:45 - i don't want this log to be so ugly
37:48 - so
37:50 - uh let's just calculate here
37:53 - x is equal to this
37:56 - and um
37:58 - around this so
38:06 - maybe this works
38:09 - if i remember right
38:11 - so the number formatting
38:16 - method here if i put two
38:20 - at the second argument it's going to
38:22 - give me
38:24 - just two decimal place
38:27 - i think it's probably gonna be enough
38:29 - and this is gonna be x and y here
38:36 - so
38:37 - why
38:41 - oh number format is not a function how
38:44 - was this
38:46 - not format too fixed
38:48 - i think so
38:50 - too fixed
39:10 - i don't remember where the two fixed
39:13 - ease
39:30 - yeah i don't remember how this works
39:33 - anymore
39:41 - i don't think there is a thing called
39:42 - format so no
39:49 - number
39:55 - oh no uh i think this is the number
40:01 - yeah let's just leave here
40:04 - um
40:06 - something like that
40:08 - and um i just copied this one for the y
40:12 - as well
40:17 - and here x two fixed yeah just two
40:22 - decimals
40:24 - so it is a number already and it's a
40:26 - method from the number
40:28 - yeah now it works and it looks
40:31 - it looks quite good
40:34 - okay so what were these control points
40:37 - here the one
40:39 - on the top
40:40 - minus
40:44 - minus
40:50 - 0.44 minus seven one and the bottom one
41:00 - that
41:02 - but these coordinates here need to also
41:04 - be
41:05 - 0 and 0.46
41:09 - so
41:10 - ok what did i do wrong
41:20 - this one
41:21 - needs to be this one
41:24 - great so we have the same thing as
41:26 - before but uh
41:29 - different so why did i do all this crazy
41:32 - stuff it's just that now and i want to
41:34 - make this symmetric on the other side as
41:36 - well i'm going to
41:38 - copy this for example
41:41 - and
41:43 - this one is going to go to
41:48 - this point
41:50 - right here but the control point is
41:52 - going to be the same as this one but
41:54 - with the plus here because now this
41:57 - control point is somewhere here and plus
42:00 - will make it go somewhere there so i
42:02 - don't need to do so much mental
42:04 - calculations if everything is symmetric
42:07 - like that
42:08 - and uh let's just do the final one here
42:10 - as well so we're gonna go back to the
42:12 - beginning to this
42:14 - coordinate there and this control point
42:17 - will have a plus right here so
42:22 - it's it took some extra time i didn't
42:24 - prepare for this kind of thing but
42:28 - it works so great
42:30 - okay
42:32 - now uh this is the shape of the head
42:35 - a little bit
42:37 - and
42:39 - i am soon going to have to specify names
42:42 - for these points i think let's
42:45 - let's see i might define some points for
42:47 - these so that i can animate them if i'm
42:50 - going to move the head in some way that
42:52 - would be nice
42:54 - but
42:55 - let's see
42:57 - so now that we have this
42:59 - i can also draw the body a little bit so
43:02 - let's draw the neck here
43:05 - so these two chords in its
43:09 - begin
43:10 - path
43:12 - and
43:14 - let's just say move to
43:17 - this location
43:19 - and
43:20 - align to
43:23 - this
43:24 - location i think i want this console log
43:29 - here to output the comma between the
43:31 - points as well
43:33 - so
43:34 - let me concatenate here a comma
43:37 - like this
43:39 - for the future
43:52 - oh i have this horrible thing here
43:59 - all right
44:04 - so we have the neck there
44:07 - good but the neck is a little bit curved
44:10 - it's supposed to be a little bit curved
44:13 - if you look
44:14 - closely
44:16 - and i'm gonna do that as well so i'm
44:18 - going to say here
44:20 - quadratic curve to the same destination
44:23 - but i will add the control point maybe
44:28 - somewhere here
44:30 - so this is going to be like that and now
44:33 - the comma is also here so i
44:35 - quicker at debugging and now the neck is
44:37 - curved like this it's great
44:40 - [Music]
44:44 - so it's going like that
44:47 - and
44:48 - let's continue this path to make the
44:50 - body somehow
44:52 - so
44:52 - add another point right here
44:58 - and i think i'm just going to
45:00 - line to
45:02 - this one
45:04 - so let me
45:06 - copy this
45:09 - like so
45:13 - now it's just fine i'm not going to
45:14 - focus on that part of the body very much
45:17 - and clothes are gonna cover that
45:18 - eventually
45:20 - so
45:21 - it's perfect
45:22 - and uh
45:23 - let's now
45:25 - make it go off the screen a little bit
45:28 - so downwards like the shoulder from here
45:32 - same x but a y that is going to be
45:36 - one or more let's put it 1.1 so this is
45:40 - going to go now
45:42 - down off screen a little bit and i'm
45:44 - going to do the same to the right so
45:47 - the next line two is gonna be
45:49 - a plus here
45:52 - uh we don't see it but now it's
45:54 - somewhere there
45:55 - and uh this one is gonna be
45:58 - with a plus there
46:01 - like that
46:03 - and
46:04 - now we are going to go
46:08 - to
46:09 - this location but with the plus
46:14 - so let me
46:19 - do that
46:21 - and finally
46:23 - a quadratic curve to for the other side
46:25 - of the neck we are going to this
46:28 - location but with the plus right here
46:31 - because it's on the other side of the
46:33 - center
46:34 - and the the control point it's going to
46:37 - be also symmetric so it has also a plus
46:40 - there
46:41 - great
46:42 - so
46:43 - let me actually extract this draw me
46:50 - function for from here and say that this
46:52 - is going to be the body
47:01 - i think eventually i'm going to use
47:03 - object-oriented
47:06 - programming
47:08 - but um
47:11 - i just want to see if it's needed and
47:15 - get something done and then i will
47:16 - refactor at some point so now i'm
47:18 - drawing the body and then the head
47:21 - so let me
47:23 - refactor this one as well
47:26 - draw
47:28 - head
47:34 - okay and i'm gonna put the body before
47:37 - drawing the head because
47:39 - i want these lines here to be covered
47:42 - with whatever the head will look like
47:45 - okay i'm missing a begin path somewhere
47:48 - or no
47:52 - uh no this line width has to happen
47:56 - early on i'm gonna just set the line
47:59 - width somewhere at the top for now
48:02 - so all the lines will be like this
48:05 - this shape
48:07 - this size
48:09 - all right
48:10 - now
48:15 - i would like the head to
48:20 - let's
48:20 - still practice a little bit with these
48:25 - lines or
48:27 - no
48:29 - no i would like the head to actually
48:31 - rotate a little bit so let's think how
48:35 - we can do that so i want
48:36 - him to be able to
48:38 - turn his head like saying no for example
48:41 - left or right i think that without doing
48:44 - some fancy feature like this uh i'm not
48:47 - gonna win this challenge so just drawing
48:49 - this
48:51 - you could just replace this with the
48:53 - sprite so
48:54 - i want this to have more personality
48:57 - than that
49:02 - so
49:03 - if we consider a point here
49:06 - in the center
49:09 - maybe the nose
49:10 - could be considered the center
49:13 - of the
49:15 - somehow let's see
49:17 - so
49:18 - um
49:19 - let's just consider this center point
49:21 - for now and give it a name
49:24 - let me
49:25 - actually
49:27 - draw this point somehow so i'm going to
49:29 - make a function
49:32 - draw a point
49:34 - let's give it the label
49:38 - and
49:40 - this is going to be
49:42 - ctx begin path
49:46 - ctx
49:48 - arc
49:50 - uh we need the location for this one as
49:53 - well not just the label
49:55 - so
49:56 - location.x location.y
50:00 - and
50:03 - a radius
50:06 - let's set here a radius with the value
50:09 - of 0.01
50:11 - or something like that
50:13 - and
50:15 - pass this radius
50:17 - and the arc method needs 0 and math dot
50:21 - pi times 2 so
50:23 - 2 pi means
50:25 - 360 degrees a full circle
50:28 - and now i'm going to do this
50:30 - and that point here is actually a point
50:38 - let's see draw
50:41 - point
50:42 - it's point um
50:47 - zero on the
50:48 - x
50:49 - but vertically it's uh minus zero 0.13
50:54 - this is where i drew this line because
50:56 - it's where the head is the widest i
50:58 - somehow want to have that value for
51:01 - i feel i want to have that value
51:04 - so
51:05 - we might change many of these things
51:07 - later but let's see how this draw point
51:10 - method looks like
51:12 - so
51:13 - refresh nothing happens
51:15 - because
51:18 - i'm not giving
51:20 - the point in the proper way
51:23 - maybe
51:26 - yeah let's give it in the proper way
51:29 - like this
51:30 - x and y i think it's fine
51:33 - okay and it's actually here but very
51:36 - small let's make this radius
51:40 - bigger
51:42 - yeah i think that's fine and the ctx
51:45 - feel
51:47 - but
51:48 - let's give it the white fill color
51:51 - so
51:52 - ctx
51:54 - fill style
51:56 - is white
51:58 - and
51:59 - after i fill it i want to draw there a
52:01 - label so this
52:03 - let's call this point
52:06 - a
52:10 - so the label a
52:12 - and i'm going to say here ctx
52:16 - fill text
52:19 - label
52:20 - at
52:21 - location.x and location.y
52:25 - like this but before that i will change
52:27 - this to black so that we can see black
52:30 - and white
52:32 - oh boy it's a horribly big
52:36 - font
52:39 - let's give it a radius
52:42 - number of
52:45 - pixels
52:46 - and make it aerial
52:49 - i somehow like this font for some reason
52:52 - and uh
53:01 - i wonder if text works well in this
53:04 - scaling conditions
53:07 - but um okay what what happens here
53:10 - let's put 0.1 pixels
53:28 - i think that it might not
53:35 - work for some reason this feels
53:39 - filled text
53:54 - the scaling method that i have
53:58 - used here might affect somehow the
54:03 - the text properties and i don't know if
54:05 - it supports these
54:07 - number of pixels
54:11 - or does it but
54:13 - i i didn't concatenate this pixel value
54:17 - here
54:18 - let me
54:21 - yes okay phew
54:23 - i
54:24 - i don't need to use a space there
54:26 - it's uh
54:28 - linked to that value okay a radius of
54:32 - a size of maybe radius times two
54:36 - now it's too small
54:42 - i think that is something fine
54:46 - maybe
54:50 - okay but
54:52 - i need to do
54:54 - text align
54:57 - center
55:05 - like this
55:07 - okay and now point a is in the center
55:09 - there so this point a i want to be able
55:12 - to control somehow
55:18 - let me
55:23 - make the background here actually
55:27 - light green
55:29 - and remove the stroke from here i think
55:32 - it's somehow too many strokes and i
55:34 - don't want it to be so distracting
55:37 - i think that's fine
55:38 - or let's make this green
55:42 - and the field style is going to be
55:47 - white
55:50 - i think this is much much more readable
55:53 - and this radius can be a little bit
55:55 - smaller maybe 1.9
55:59 - i just want to have things here that
56:00 - look somehow nice
56:05 - since i'm gonna reuse this component
56:08 - multiple times i might as well
56:12 - have some nice components to work with
56:14 - that is not distracting in some way
56:20 - okay for some reason this
56:23 - would need a little bit of adjustment
56:25 - here as well and i want to use part of
56:27 - the radius
56:29 - for that so that this is
56:31 - relatively
56:33 - well
56:36 - implemented so that if i change some of
56:38 - these
56:39 - scaling properties it looks good okay
56:43 - so
56:44 - this point a is something that i want to
56:46 - control somehow
56:48 - and i'm going to define for this some
56:51 - slider
56:52 - let me try to do that input type
56:57 - range
57:00 - id
57:04 - a
57:09 - the x of that point will be controlled
57:13 - by this ax
57:15 - slider
57:18 - okay
57:20 - so we have the slider now here
57:23 - uh
57:24 - i would like it to be up here actually
57:28 - so um
57:40 - no i don't want that because it's gonna
57:43 - mess up with my
57:46 - cord and it's when i click on the screen
57:49 - i don't want to bother with that i'm
57:51 - actually gonna
57:52 - put this
57:55 - slider i want it up because i will have
57:58 - more of them
58:00 - so let's put here
58:06 - sliders eventually i i want to move that
58:10 - point maybe also upwards let's see so
58:12 - another slider for that
58:15 - and um
58:16 - i want this sliders element to be
58:22 - uh
58:24 - positioned at the top somehow so
58:30 - not the best way to do this i might
58:32 - redesign the things later but let's see
58:39 - zero
58:41 - okay now it's here but i want it to be
58:44 - left
58:46 - 300
58:48 - pixels okay
58:51 - so this slider is going to control
58:54 - our position and
58:58 - for this ax element and let's just say
59:01 - that
59:02 - we will give here a minimum value of
59:06 - minus one
59:08 - max
59:10 - plus one
59:14 - okay and initially it's it's zero by
59:17 - default
59:20 - okay so
59:22 - now
59:26 - on change
59:30 - uh
59:32 - unchanged i'm going to
59:34 - set here a value
59:36 - a function for
59:38 - update
59:40 - point probably we'll rename this
59:43 - soon
59:44 - let's see but the update point
59:54 - let's put here info and log this
59:58 - info in the console because i don't
60:00 - remember what it contains so now when i
60:03 - change this
60:04 - okay it only works when i
60:08 - release so i don't really want that
60:11 - uh i think there exists also on
60:14 - update
60:19 - no
60:24 - on drag
60:28 - no
60:31 - one change
60:33 - but really i
60:35 - am pretty sure that
60:54 - it's on update
60:57 - with
60:58 - small u or
61:01 - no i don't think it matters
61:04 - on
61:06 - change
61:16 - yeah i really want it to go while i'm
61:19 - dragging this so this on change
61:22 - is not enough
61:42 - on move
61:46 - no
61:48 - update
62:03 - these are so different in different
62:05 - programs and different languages i don't
62:08 - remember
62:11 - ah
62:13 - on
62:48 - no i don't remember
62:52 - let's just leave it like this for now
62:54 - so
62:55 - what i want to print in the console is
62:57 - not the whole info but
63:00 - i think it's value
63:10 - oh
63:17 - but why is it like that because i
63:20 - specified here one as the maximum
63:25 - okay now it works but
63:27 - i can only put one zero or minus one it
63:31 - snaps somehow i think there is a step
63:33 - also
63:35 - that can be used to fine tune this
63:40 - yeah okay
63:43 - i guess i can work with this
63:46 - oh and i can use the keyboard
63:48 - to
63:49 - to move this as well
63:51 - okay so now the thing is
63:53 - i want this slider to control how the
63:56 - head is going to rotate
63:58 - by first controlling where this point is
64:01 - going to be
64:02 - relative to that and
64:06 - this is between -1 and 1 so it's going
64:09 - to be a
64:11 - maximum
64:12 - 100 percent or negative 100 percent
64:16 - movement that we will allow in the
64:18 - interface
64:19 - so
64:21 - let's just define this a point somewhere
64:25 - i'm going to define
64:28 - it at the top somewhere maybe
64:31 - maybe here
64:35 - a is equal to
64:37 - something
64:38 - so this in the beginning
64:42 - and then i'm just gonna write there a
64:45 - for now
64:46 - so
64:47 - this point is here
64:50 - and
64:52 - when we move this slider i want a
64:56 - according to this to go
64:59 - left on the x
65:01 - or right on the x so this would be left
65:04 - on the x from this original location
65:08 - uh like mid location to the far left and
65:13 - far right extremities that we will give
65:16 - so
65:17 - this x and y is like the initial
65:21 - like center
65:22 - point
65:29 - the only thing i'm changing is the x
65:32 - right
65:35 - so it's like the initial initial
65:37 - location but then um
65:40 - let's call another
65:42 - property here x
65:43 - range
65:45 - between
65:46 - let's say minus zero point
65:50 - [Music]
65:52 - seven
65:55 - now zero point two something small and
65:59 - plus zero point two so this is gonna be
66:06 - an array
66:08 - of two elements for this x range
66:11 - so now what we are doing
66:14 - [Music]
66:15 - updating the point i'm going to say
66:18 - a dot
66:20 - x is going to be
66:23 - within that x range give me the value
66:26 - according to this
66:28 - percentage here so this is between minus
66:30 - 100 percent plus hundred percent
66:46 - and maybe center
66:48 - could be somewhere
66:50 - in the middle
66:55 - i really want these things to be
66:57 - symmetric so putting here things like
67:00 - that is kind of too much
67:06 - let's just try to put center point and
67:09 - there and if the value is negative it's
67:12 - gonna mirror itself to the left if that
67:15 - makes sense so i'm only putting things
67:18 - on the right of this center part and
67:20 - everything else becomes symmetric to the
67:22 - left with the minus minus values
67:25 - so ax is going to be
67:31 - i'm going to do linear interpolation so
67:34 - linear interpolation between
67:42 - a dot x
67:44 - range
67:46 - of 0
67:49 - and a dot x range of
67:54 - 1.
67:56 - using this value as the percentage
68:02 - so
68:05 - function
68:08 - linear interpolation is very simple you
68:10 - have just two values let's call them a
68:13 - and b
68:14 - or start and end
68:17 - and a percentage we can call that
68:21 - t because p usually stands for point so
68:26 - the function is really easy it's
68:29 - you take the first value and you add the
68:32 - difference between
68:34 - the end and the start multiplied by this
68:36 - t value so
68:38 - if t is zero
68:40 - then this whole thing is zero and you're
68:42 - just at the starting point
68:44 - if t is one
68:46 - then this difference is going to the
68:49 - minus s from here
68:54 - i mean if t is one this disappears and
68:57 - the minus s from here cancels this one
68:59 - so you're just left with the end point
69:01 - if this is somewhere in the middle then
69:05 - this difference is not going to amount
69:06 - as much so it's basically evenly spacing
69:10 - you
69:10 - values according to this percent here
69:13 - and if this t is
69:15 - negative
69:16 - this difference from here actually goes
69:19 - uh on the up other side so i expect that
69:23 - this will work with the negative values
69:25 - as well so let me just
69:27 - try this
69:30 - like that but
69:31 - [Music]
69:33 - i
69:34 - won't see any changes here if i'm
69:37 - dragging this because
69:38 - i'm not redrawing this on every frame i
69:42 - need to animate this
69:44 - so
69:46 - i'm going to put this draw me function
69:51 - inside the function called animate
69:54 - that
69:55 - i'm going to call draw me
69:59 - on every frame
70:01 - and the
70:02 - request
70:03 - animation frame is the method that
70:07 - does this calling of the animate
70:10 - function again and again and again as
70:13 - fast as it can
70:15 - so now
70:22 - it still doesn't work
70:25 - oh because i'm not calling the animate
70:28 - function anywhere but where am i calling
70:30 - draw draw me okay
70:32 - so
70:34 - animate here once the image is loaded
70:40 - okay
70:43 - something bad happens because
70:46 - yeah
70:48 - um
70:52 - it just draws again and again and again
70:55 - thinks on the canvas so i think i'm
70:57 - going to copy this drawing of the image
71:03 - every time we draw us i also draw the
71:06 - reference image this image by the way
71:08 - will disappear
71:10 - by the end so that's no
71:14 - not something that will stay here and
71:16 - now it's drawing it on top of each other
71:18 - with these kind of uh
71:21 - small alphas there
71:23 - it looks horrible i will just
71:26 - clear
71:29 - clear the canvas
71:39 - i hope this works
71:42 - uh no it doesn't because
71:44 - we are in this new space right now so i
71:47 - need to use
71:49 - this
71:51 - okay so it looks as before but now every
71:54 - time i release here that a point is
71:58 - actually going to
72:00 - change according to my slider
72:03 - um
72:04 - within this
72:06 - um
72:11 - range that i allow it so i told it
72:14 - basically that it can go from
72:18 - zero which is somewhere here
72:20 - to
72:22 - 0.2 which is somewhere there
72:26 - but
72:30 - because linear interpolation works also
72:32 - with the negative
72:34 - value for t that we can give with this
72:38 - slider i can also have symmetrical
72:41 - symmetric behavior there as well
72:46 - which is good
72:48 - i think
72:50 - i'm not entirely sure
72:52 - i don't want everything to be symmetric
72:54 - but some things i i want them to be
72:56 - symmetric so
72:58 - yeah so now that i have this a point
73:02 - there
73:09 - i'm going to
73:14 - try to draw
73:16 - this straight line that we had
73:17 - previously to be controlled by a
73:21 - in some way like using a as a control
73:24 - point
73:25 - so that the head tends to rotate
73:29 - rotate a little bit like that
73:32 - so let's see if we can get that to work
73:36 - a is now here
73:38 - and
73:40 - when we draw the head this is the
73:42 - vertical line here
73:45 - and uh i don't want it to be
73:48 - uh line two anymore i want it to be a
73:51 - quadratic curve to
73:53 - where
73:55 - the end point is the same it's this one
73:57 - at the bottom right there
74:01 - but the first point here is going to be
74:04 - a dot x a dot y
74:07 - so
74:08 - instead of the line two we have a
74:09 - quadratic curve
74:11 - that goes through a
74:13 - when a is there it looks like a straight
74:16 - line but if i'm gonna do this
74:19 - you can see the head tends to
74:23 - rotate
74:26 - at least a little bit
74:28 - influenced by that control point so this
74:31 - quadratic curve two function it's
74:33 - actually poorly named because there's
74:35 - also another function called
74:38 - bezier curve two that has two control
74:40 - points and it's poorly called i think
74:44 - because both of them are bezier curves
74:47 - bezier curves are very general curves
74:49 - and they can have
74:51 - infinitely many control points so you
74:53 - can have one two three
74:55 - there is no
74:57 - function in the canvas with three points
75:00 - but you could implement it yourself
75:01 - using
75:03 - bernstein polynomials or something like
75:05 - that
75:06 - but um
75:10 - yeah so both of them are
75:13 - um
75:14 - bezier curves so the fact that there is
75:16 - another one called bezier curve 2 means
75:18 - that this one
75:20 - would not be
75:21 - which is kind of
75:24 - i don't know bad naming but
75:27 - when dealing with bezier curves it
75:28 - doesn't mean that the curve is going to
75:30 - pass through that point so this is one
75:34 - thing that people are usually confused
75:36 - about what it means is that when you
75:38 - start the curve here in the beginning
75:41 - you start exactly in the direction of
75:44 - this point so if you draw a tangent from
75:47 - this point it would go through a
75:50 - but it's just influenced and as you're
75:52 - going the end point starts to influence
75:56 - as well so you don't actually pass
75:59 - through a over there
76:03 - uh if my math is right i think that if
76:06 - you put here instead of ax
76:09 - ax times 2
76:14 - then it goes through a because when you
76:16 - have these quadratic curves
76:19 - essentially what i'm doing now is
76:21 - my control point here it's a x times 2
76:25 - so it's somewhere here where my mouse is
76:27 - now
76:30 - and then the curve goes exactly through
76:33 - that value so
76:35 - the
76:36 - point where
76:38 - let me just undo this
76:41 - the point
76:42 - where
76:44 - the curve will pass through closest to
76:47 - this a is actually gonna be halfway
76:50 - between where a is and
76:52 - the
76:53 - straight line
76:55 - goes
76:56 - there so a little bit of math this might
76:59 - be helpful later when i'm gonna do some
77:01 - of these
77:03 - things more carefully but okay this is
77:06 - the a x somehow
77:09 - how about one for the a y as well
77:12 - so
77:16 - i want to make this line here the
77:19 - straight line there also modified by a
77:21 - slider like that so let me go here in
77:24 - our sliders and define a y in exactly
77:28 - the same way as previously
77:34 - and here it's something that i really
77:36 - want to change
77:38 - something
77:39 - so this update point
77:42 - um
77:44 - i really want to say that this is uh
77:47 - just the x element
77:49 - x attribute needs to change and this one
77:52 - has to change its y attribute i don't
77:55 - really like this function here let's see
77:57 - later if it becomes better but
78:00 - now update point
78:04 - attribute so the attribute
78:09 - a of x so this here
78:12 - i can also write it like this and it
78:14 - should work
78:16 - but now instead of that hard coded
78:18 - string i'm going to put here the
78:20 - attribute is going to be
78:23 - um
78:32 - not very good
78:36 - uh i think what we will do is um
78:48 - so i want the y range as well
78:52 - let's say
78:55 - 0 and
78:57 - 0.4
78:58 - just to test and to see that they are
79:00 - different but i need to be able to
79:02 - specify
79:04 - where i want these
79:07 - this interpolation to happen so now this
79:09 - attribute
79:12 - yeah let's just
79:15 - say here for now switch based on the
79:18 - attribute
79:19 - and the
79:20 - case x then
79:24 - a of x
79:32 - is equal to
79:34 - that
79:38 - break
79:40 - and
79:42 - a of
79:43 - y
79:44 - is gonna be with y range here so i
79:47 - wanted to do this with a single line but
79:50 - i think this is also
79:52 - clear at least for now let's see later
79:55 - what what happens
79:57 - if this kind of code structure is good
80:01 - so what happens now we have two sliders
80:05 - and this other one controls the movement
80:08 - vertically somehow
80:12 - but
80:14 - there is a problem here because
80:16 - zero point is not where this
80:20 - thing is
80:21 - from previously
80:23 - and uh maybe this is actually a good
80:25 - thing
80:28 - um
80:30 - let me think about that
80:33 - but uh of course i could change this so
80:36 - this
80:37 - line this horizontal line here it's um
80:43 - at this location
80:45 - so if i'm going to
80:47 - put
80:50 - the y range
80:58 - like that
81:02 - then 0 is is fine there but
81:16 - let me
81:18 - try to have these steps more fine for
81:21 - this one
81:23 - i have a feeling there is something
81:25 - wrong with the math here so let me just
81:27 - move this with my
81:29 - keyboard
81:31 - no it looks pretty good so with my
81:34 - keyboard a is moving
81:39 - yeah it's it's moving quite well
81:43 - i don't know why i expect it to be a
81:45 - jump there somewhere let me try to make
81:47 - this even smaller
81:54 - it looks quite smooth there
81:58 - yeah okay everything seems to be just
82:01 - fine yeah it's uh it's good the math is
82:04 - good
82:04 - i
82:05 - don't know why i thought different
82:08 - so
82:14 - so
82:17 - with a there
82:20 - this looks good now but the horizontal
82:22 - line should be now controlled by a
82:25 - and
82:26 - let's do it so that
82:29 - i do the same kind of quadratic curve to
82:32 - here
82:33 - going
82:36 - to the bottom so from the top to the
82:39 - bottom
82:40 - and um
82:41 - [Music]
82:43 - the same control point as uh
82:46 - previously a a controls both of those
82:50 - curves
82:51 - so now
82:53 - you can see somehow the head
82:56 - seemingly
82:59 - 3d ish
83:01 - but
83:03 - some things here i just don't like for
83:05 - example
83:08 - i actually want those curves to go
83:10 - through a
83:15 - but that's not gonna be so easy to do i
83:18 - think
83:21 - let me see
83:23 - i don't want
83:24 - necessarily this to happen and i don't
83:27 - think that it will happen exactly
83:31 - yeah
83:32 - i don't want
83:33 - actually to complicate it like that but
83:37 - horizontally i think the movement is
83:39 - good but vertically
83:41 - it's way too much so when i wrote here
83:44 - at the top
83:46 - um
83:49 - the y range going
83:52 - from
83:53 - this to that this this value is just too
83:56 - much way too much so i'm gonna put here
84:01 - maybe also 0.2 as the other one let's
84:04 - see now how it looks like
84:06 - so
84:07 - left
84:08 - right
84:09 - and
84:15 - like that
84:16 - and this one here
84:20 - still too much i don't want to
84:22 - have so exaggerated movement i just want
84:25 - to give a little idea of 3d this is not
84:28 - going to be a
84:30 - 3d space with x y and z it's just going
84:33 - to be some locations
84:36 - like some keyframes when the character
84:38 - is looking left when the character is
84:40 - looking right and then interpolating
84:43 - between those
84:45 - somehow so
84:47 - it's one technique that
84:49 - is used in animation quite quite often
84:52 - but here i'm coding it instead which is
84:54 - actually not very often
84:56 - in practice
84:58 - so
84:59 - up and down it's actually way too much
85:01 - i'm gonna put here maybe point one
85:08 - i think this is just
85:10 - great so good enough movement there and
85:14 - the left and right
85:23 - yeah something like that
85:27 - so question is
85:42 - yeah okay
85:57 - and then the things that will somehow uh
86:01 - color the face and give it hair and
86:04 - things like that will
86:06 - also be influenced in the same way as
86:08 - this a point
86:10 - somehow so that would be
86:12 - overall the
86:14 - idea
86:17 - there are a few things that i don't like
86:20 - yet for example moving your head up
86:24 - doesn't just
86:25 - rotate it
86:27 - like this
86:29 - if i can try to mimic this
86:32 - your head actually moves a little bit
86:35 - upwards so
86:36 - these points here
86:40 - and this point here should also be
86:42 - affected by these sliders
86:46 - otherwise it just looks very
86:49 - robotic
86:50 - and
86:51 - not very
86:55 - realistic and same goes for left and
86:57 - right
86:59 - when i especially left and right because
87:01 - you can see the chin is
87:04 - really going off from the the center of
87:07 - the of the body when you do that
87:09 - so
87:10 - these points need to have
87:13 - ranges
87:15 - as well as this uh a point that we are
87:19 - somehow now i'm considering this a point
87:22 - as a point that the character is looking
87:25 - at
87:26 - if it's
87:27 - quite in in front of
87:29 - in front of the character so
87:31 - it has some sliders there
87:34 - uh to control that but the whole head
87:36 - shape is going to be affected
87:39 - uh as well not just this center point of
87:43 - the face it's uh
87:45 - yeah so that's what we are going to try
87:48 - to do next and i'm going to define these
87:50 - points
87:52 - give them labels as well as a is here so
87:57 - let's see uh i'm going to name this
87:59 - point
88:01 - maybe b
88:03 - b c d e or something like that
88:08 - so let's define these points as well
88:12 - and
88:12 - um
88:14 - i'm just going to start with one of the
88:16 - points
88:18 - maybe
88:20 - b
88:22 - and this one is going to be
88:25 - this location from here the first move
88:28 - to that we do there so i'm going to cut
88:30 - this say here b dot x b dot y
88:34 - and
88:39 - put the values here so 0 and minus 0.77
88:46 - and there is going to be also
88:49 - a range for x
88:52 - we will figure what the out what
88:55 - what those are
88:59 - what that is
89:03 - and also a y for that
89:11 - but let's just put these values to be
89:14 - minus
89:15 - 0.77
89:19 - minus 0.77 so essentially the range is
89:23 - null
89:24 - and 0 0 so now x is between 0 and 0 and
89:28 - y is between minus 77
89:31 - minus 77 so there's no range there i
89:34 - just put it as a default value
89:37 - so just to get it to appear somewhere
89:40 - first
89:41 - and uh let's put also b
89:46 - b
89:47 - like that
89:49 - so b is there
89:51 - the sliders don't affect b
89:54 - at the moment at all
89:59 - because also
90:01 - this draw point is something
90:05 - i mean update point is something that
90:06 - only updates point a
90:11 - so
90:12 - not
90:13 - good code here i really need to think
90:15 - about this just in a second
90:20 - but uh before that this b is
90:24 - 0 and minus 0.77
90:27 - let's see if these points
90:29 - are
90:31 - still somewhere
90:39 - so this is b right here definitely
90:48 - i think those are the only ones this one
90:51 - here and this one here so let's just put
90:53 - there bx by
90:58 - and uh now in this update point function
91:01 - i need to be able to specify somehow
91:03 - which is the point so
91:05 - let's
91:06 - put here b that that's the point i want
91:09 - to modify i send it as a parameter like
91:12 - that
91:14 - sorry first one is is a actually
91:18 - okay
91:19 - and here in the update point i could say
91:23 - um
91:33 - point so which one is going to be
91:36 - but now i need the way to access this so
91:39 - we could put actually all of these
91:42 - inside of um an object
91:45 - called
91:47 - points
91:48 - maybe live points they are points that
91:51 - move
91:52 - and
91:53 - this object is going to have an
91:55 - attribute
91:57 - called a
92:00 - and an attribute called b i don't know
92:02 - if this is better yet but
92:05 - i need to
92:06 - update the code depending on what i am
92:09 - looking and feeling when i'm designing
92:11 - this so this is not the typical
92:13 - waterfall way of developing things it's
92:17 - quite agile and you think
92:19 - what you need to change according to
92:21 - what you want to achieve there
92:24 - so
92:25 - now life points actually
92:28 - and the every time
92:36 - i'm using
92:37 - a or b
92:40 - like this
92:46 - or um i could actually destructure this
92:48 - i think and have uh references for a and
92:51 - b
92:52 - let's see const
92:55 - a b is equal to
93:00 - live
93:01 - points
93:04 - maybe does this fix my problem
93:10 - life points is not iterable
93:17 - no not not that so
93:21 - huh
93:30 - this is not an array
93:37 - okay a is still moving even though i did
93:40 - this change right here
93:42 - but then i want in the update point
93:45 - to take
93:46 - not a here
93:50 - but
93:52 - the
93:53 - live points
93:57 - let's call this
93:59 - point p is
94:01 - live points
94:02 - of point which is a string so this point
94:06 - here is a string and
94:09 - it's specified here which point are we
94:11 - changing by the slider
94:14 - let's actually also have
94:16 - here a and b like labels so that we
94:22 - oh no no no no no no it's not a and b
94:26 - it's a x oh boy
94:30 - a x a y
94:34 - no what am i doing this is not not even
94:37 - a anymore
94:42 - let's just keep team these a
94:46 - x and y so this id here it's actually
94:50 - not used anywhere
94:53 - um
94:55 - but this is not update point it's it's
94:57 - update points now
95:00 - yes it's update points now all the
95:04 - points need to update according to
95:09 - the value of these sliders and this
95:10 - slider controls the x and the other one
95:12 - controls the y
95:14 - so
95:18 - let me
95:19 - even remove this id from here because
95:21 - it's confusing now and we don't seem to
95:23 - need it
95:25 - so what we do now is go through all the
95:29 - live points so
95:35 - and
95:40 - and each of them have their own ranges
95:42 - right
95:44 - so
95:45 - this is now update points
95:48 - and
95:53 - um
95:59 - for each point
96:02 - in there i'm going to switch depending
96:05 - on the attribute
96:06 - and um
96:12 - p dot x
96:14 - so at first it's going to be a and then
96:16 - it's going to be
96:19 - b
96:20 - and both of them have a range on x and
96:22 - the range and y
96:24 - and
96:25 - the the ranges will eventually be
96:27 - different so let's see if this code
96:29 - works
96:31 - okay some problem there
96:35 - haha
96:36 - um
96:51 - for for each
96:53 - [Music]
96:55 - this would need to be an array i think
96:59 - let's see how the four in
97:02 - loop
97:04 - for
97:05 - let be
97:07 - in
97:10 - live points
97:14 - i really don't remember all of the ways
97:16 - that these
97:17 - for loops work but
97:38 - okay
97:39 - so
97:46 - um this is
97:49 - point id like a in that case and here
97:53 - i'm gonna say
97:54 - the point
97:58 - p is gonna be
98:00 - live points of
98:03 - p id so i don't use array but
98:08 - yeah okay so x is okay
98:11 - y is okay let me just add the line break
98:15 - there at the top
98:22 - okay and uh i think they can be a little
98:26 - bit to the right so
98:29 - something like that
98:30 - too much
98:35 - okay
98:41 - great
98:41 - so
98:51 - so let's try now to modify this b as
98:53 - well so
98:54 - it code should work we just have to
98:56 - change these ranges here like if i'm
98:59 - going to put a 0.02 range for b
99:04 - you can see b is moving now
99:06 - in that same kind of
99:09 - as much as a is moving actually and all
99:12 - the lines connected to b
99:15 - are also adapting
99:17 - according to the control points the same
99:20 - control points that we had earlier and
99:24 - you can see the shape here is not great
99:27 - it's not like a real head would look
99:29 - like but i have some other ideas for
99:31 - drawing the head on top of that and i
99:33 - think it's going to be fine
99:36 - but one thing is i do want b to somehow
99:39 - move like that but not as much so maybe
99:42 - i'm going to put here 0.1
99:45 - and now when a is going in that way b is
99:49 - moving
99:51 - b is moving
99:52 - less so
99:56 - i don't really know if b needs to move
99:58 - like that
100:00 - honestly
100:02 - because the top of the head does stay in
100:05 - the same place
100:06 - but uh
100:07 - i think i i do want it to move
100:10 - vertically with the y
100:12 - so it could be that i'm gonna just put
100:14 - here range zero zero
100:18 - like that or something very very small
100:21 - sometimes
100:23 - small values
100:24 - uh make a big difference in how
100:26 - everything feels so it may not seem like
100:29 - something but it does so now i'm not
100:32 - really doing any 3d stuff or
100:36 - realistic movement is more like using
100:38 - animation principles and
100:40 - things like that to make the
100:43 - movement more
100:45 - appear organic to somebody who knows
100:49 - some kind of things about about
100:52 - drawing
100:54 - drawing objects there and i'm not i
100:56 - don't want anything to be perfect but
100:59 - to look good so
101:02 - many things are like that especially in
101:03 - animation
101:05 - um
101:06 - you exaggerate and you emphasize some
101:08 - things that don't normally happen in the
101:10 - real real world
101:14 - okay so let's try the vertical one as
101:17 - well so from this
101:19 - value here
101:21 - let's give it
101:23 - a value of
101:26 - minus 8
101:29 - 0.8 and just see what happens
101:34 - uh
101:35 - okay it's it's opposite this
101:43 - it's opposite
101:52 - yeah it's opposite so
101:56 - i want
101:59 - 0.7 there
102:04 - so now that b point is also updating but
102:07 - it's too much maybe
102:09 - 0.772 i just want a little bit of head
102:13 - lowering
102:14 - when
102:15 - the character is looking downwards so
102:18 - again a little bit goes a long way
102:22 - and uh
102:24 - same for the
102:25 - upwards position
102:33 - maybe
102:34 - 7.3
102:36 - is actually even better
102:43 - yeah i'm i'm happy with that
102:46 - okay and
102:48 - it's also supporting this a little bit
102:52 - okay
102:53 - now this chin this is
102:56 - something that moves much more because
102:58 - it's pointing out like like like
103:01 - what
103:03 - chins do
103:04 - so let's try to do that point next and
103:07 - uh
103:09 - it's
103:13 - this one right here so let's extract
103:19 - point
103:20 - c dot x
103:22 - c dot y
103:26 - and
103:29 - i'm just going to
103:30 - duplicate this line here
103:38 - with
103:40 - c
103:41 - and
103:45 - there is a plus value here 0 46
103:48 - and the ranges
103:50 - um again i'm going to start
103:54 - or let's give this a value let's
103:56 - actually make it two because
103:58 - center of the face and the chin kinda
104:01 - are on the same
104:02 - plane i think
104:04 - uh and the y range
104:08 - yeah
104:09 - um
104:11 - zero point
104:18 - 46
104:20 - and let's just give this
104:24 - let's keep it like this for now and
104:26 - modify it later so the c point
104:31 - see
104:33 - appears there
104:35 - with 0 and 046
104:39 - but it also appears
104:41 - here
104:48 - is this the only place where the chin
104:50 - appears
104:52 - how is it possible because
104:54 - um okay we're drawing this way so
104:57 - then we don't have to move to yes okay
105:00 - so it's only one time here c dot x c dot
105:04 - y
105:07 - and an error
105:09 - c is not defined because here where we
105:12 - where i'm doing this destructuring
105:14 - so that i do have
105:17 - easy access for this a b and c points
105:19 - and i don't have to always write
105:22 - live points dot
105:25 - a b c so
105:28 - this destructuring is something i'm
105:29 - probably going to forget very often but
105:32 - now we have a b
105:34 - b
105:37 - c
105:39 - abc
105:42 - and yeah
105:47 - you can see that a and c are somehow c
105:50 - is definitely looking more like a like a
105:53 - chin now when you're rotating and i'm
105:56 - really happy with this i think
106:01 - i like this shape of the head that we
106:03 - have now
106:07 - okay
106:08 - and vertically
106:10 - c is not moving and this is something
106:13 - that needs to change
106:16 - i think it should move similar to a
106:20 - the place that you are looking in in
106:21 - your
106:23 - face yeah i think it should move
106:26 - as much as a
106:29 - pretty much let's see so a is moving
106:34 - okay quite much
106:36 - let's try to put here
106:38 - 60
106:40 - six
106:46 - it's
106:47 - too much i think it's
106:51 - not horrible
106:53 - but
106:54 - let's just put 62.
107:01 - so the thing is
107:03 - because these are on a plane
107:05 - the bottom part
107:10 - shouldn't move as much
107:16 - as the top part
107:18 - so this is a bit of a problem we are
107:20 - having now
107:25 - i like how it looks like when the face
107:28 - is looking upwards because the chin
107:30 - tends to let the neck visible and this
107:33 - part from here
107:34 - but um when it's i mean this position
107:38 - but when it's going downwards
107:41 - this becomes way too pointy like the
107:43 - chin actually disappears between under
107:46 - the nose and doesn't
107:48 - expand doesn't expand that much
107:52 - so i have a problem here this whole way
107:55 - of doing things just doesn't seem to
107:59 - work properly
108:01 - in this case
108:10 - i could do something of a
108:14 - two ranges
108:16 - a negative y range
108:20 - and a positive
108:21 - range
108:29 - maybe we try to do that it won't be very
108:31 - realistic but
108:36 - we see if there are consequences
108:41 - why negative range so this is going to
108:44 - be
108:57 - to zero point let's say
109:00 - 40.
109:03 - and
109:05 - here where we are doing these updates we
109:08 - check to see
109:11 - if the value is less than zero
109:15 - very complicated stuff
109:18 - so
109:21 - let's say
109:22 - const
109:24 - value
109:25 - is
109:26 - if the info value is less than zero
109:32 - no no no no
109:33 - no
109:35 - i want the x range i want the y range so
109:40 - y range to use if the value is less than
109:44 - zero then use
109:48 - then use
109:52 - negative range
109:55 - otherwise
109:57 - range
109:58 - um
110:00 - y
110:03 - range i don't like what i'm doing now
110:05 - but
110:06 - at least to get something that works and
110:08 - then we'll think about restructuring a
110:10 - bit later
110:12 - so
110:15 - here i just take that value
110:18 - and um
110:27 - and
110:31 - this only in the case that negative
110:33 - range exists
110:38 - so if
110:39 - b dot y negative range
110:42 - because all the other points are working
110:44 - just perfectly now
110:46 - so the only issue i have now is because
110:48 - of the phase and the 3d
110:50 - way that faces look like i can't model
110:53 - this mathematically with such simple
110:56 - linear interpolation techniques it needs
110:58 - to behave differently when
111:01 - when going up then when going down
111:05 - um
111:06 - so let's say here let y range
111:10 - and the
111:12 - value
111:13 - and now this y range is going to be
111:20 - that
111:23 - so
111:24 - actually y range equals to
111:28 - that
111:30 - but if the negative range exists then
111:33 - it's going to change and value is going
111:36 - to be info dot value
111:39 - but here if the negative range exists
111:42 - we actually want the value to be
111:44 - the
111:46 - absolute value
111:49 - of the value i think i will
111:53 - see if this works
112:04 - okay what happened
112:07 - did anything happen so let me put the
112:10 - negative range that just doesn't change
112:12 - so
112:14 - something like this
112:21 - okay
112:25 - everything is opposite
112:33 - oh
112:35 - yes because y goes downwards so
112:41 - uh
112:45 - the range let's just keep it
112:48 - 46 and this one
112:51 - 62.
112:59 - actually
113:02 - 62-46
113:04 - so
113:15 - and then
113:17 - 46 minus 16 30. so this is actually 0.3
113:23 - here
113:28 - okay so upwards movement is fine
113:30 - but then downwards movement
113:33 - at some point c becomes
113:41 - i really want to use some kind of a
113:43 - mathematical function like
113:45 - the sign here
113:48 - i don't know how to code this so nicely
113:50 - and i don't know if
113:52 - so much work is needed
113:54 - but um okay so at least now c is
113:58 - stationary there for the positive values
114:01 - so what i'm gonna do next is um
114:04 - modify this to say
114:06 - maybe
114:08 - 50.
114:14 - so
114:16 - okay
114:22 - so somehow now c doesn't move as much
114:25 - when going
114:27 - downwards but actually maybe i want it
114:29 - to move
114:31 - even opposite direction let's just play
114:34 - around with this a little bit so
114:46 - i think that this is actually a more
114:48 - natural movement when characters are
114:51 - looking downwards because the chin just
114:53 - disappears somehow
114:56 - so i'm over complicating this i think
115:10 - but
115:12 - yeah let's leave it like this now
115:14 - and let's try the other one
115:20 - okay i think this looks good
115:34 - good this is fine
115:50 - maybe
115:51 - four two there looks a little nicer
116:05 - yeah
116:06 - okay so a lot of time went to
116:09 - fine-tuning these things but i think
116:10 - that we are on to something
116:13 - and i kind of like this structure that
116:16 - we are having now and the fact that i
116:18 - can move the character
116:20 - in these different
116:21 - directions
116:23 - [Music]
116:28 - no i i don't
116:30 - think this is great i think
116:33 - let's try again with the positive
116:35 - bigger value there
116:55 - yeah from the side you actually would
116:56 - like to see
116:58 - the chin continuing to move downwards
117:01 - it's really tricky
117:03 - it's not going to be fantastic and i
117:05 - think that
117:06 - i'm going to
117:08 - limit this
117:11 - movement a bit more eventually
117:14 - like maybe not allow the sliders to go
117:16 - all the way
117:18 - i really think that you don't need
117:21 - the most extreme values for the slider
117:26 - to get a nice looking animation there
117:30 - and
117:30 - even values here in between are going to
117:33 - be
117:34 - good enough
117:35 - and we may not even need this crazy
117:38 - stuff here with the y negative range
117:41 - there
117:42 - it's just
117:44 - way too much
117:46 - work and too many things to worry about
117:48 - code will become also difficult
117:59 - yes
118:07 - but
118:10 - or
118:11 - let's leave it for now and worry about
118:14 - it a bit later
118:20 - and i will have also a meeting
118:24 - in about half an hour so let's see what
118:27 - is the next step going to be
118:31 - uh how about i try to draw
118:36 - the
118:37 - face
118:39 - like the eyes for example
118:42 - maybe that's one challenging thing that
118:45 - really needs to get done so maybe if i
118:48 - focus on that one for half an hour i
118:50 - have enough time i hope
118:53 - so all of these things that we did now
118:55 - are probably going to be things that
118:57 - will
119:00 - be deleted at some point they are just
119:02 - reference points
119:04 - but then at some point
119:06 - they will be replaced by actual skins
119:08 - and
119:12 - make the character look like that
119:14 - reference drawing
119:17 - and then we remove that reference
119:18 - drawing
119:20 - of course
119:22 - okay
119:25 - so
119:27 - let's
119:29 - have here the head and
119:32 - inside of the head i'm going to make a
119:34 - function
119:35 - draw
119:36 - eyes
119:39 - okay
119:40 - and
119:40 - i want these eyes to be
119:44 - somehow very much influenced by where
119:47 - a is
119:49 - right
119:55 - yes
119:57 - so let's put here a
120:00 - as a point that we will be doing this
120:03 - eyes relative to
120:05 - and i'm going to do here function
120:08 - draw eyes
120:10 - a reference point
120:13 - and
120:14 - let me just make the eye that is going
120:16 - to be
120:18 - on the right side here
120:20 - so
120:21 - i'm going to
120:22 - begin a path
120:27 - and move to some location there
120:30 - draw some curve for the top part
120:34 - i is very complicated actually
120:37 - oh boy
120:41 - oh boy
120:47 - what did i get myself into
120:52 - let's just draw the white part of the
120:54 - eye first
120:57 - so
121:00 - yeah
121:02 - we're gonna start at
121:07 - this point
121:09 - but these will be relative to a somehow
121:13 - so now i want to
121:15 - click on the points
121:17 - i mean measure here
121:19 - coordinates relative to this a location
121:24 - so
121:24 - just temporarily i'm going to
121:31 - modify my function for
121:34 - printing the coordinates here
121:40 - so that we have
121:44 - offset
121:50 - x is going to be x minus a dot x
121:55 - and y is going to be y minus a dot y
122:00 - so
122:01 - now we get here offset.x and offset.y
122:07 - and that means that
122:11 - clicking on a here is going to be pretty
122:13 - much zero
122:19 - very good
122:21 - okay so relative to a
122:25 - i'm going to
122:30 - start clicking on some locations now so
122:32 - this point right here
122:36 - okay
122:38 - and then i'm gonna do a
122:41 - quadratic curve
122:46 - to
122:47 - with this control point
122:50 - and to here
122:52 - and then another quadratic curve
122:57 - to here
123:00 - and another
123:02 - quadratic curve
123:05 - here
123:06 - and another
123:08 - quadratic curve to here so quite many
123:12 - points here that i'm listing in the
123:15 - console
123:26 - so let me clear this
123:30 - text
123:34 - somehow i'm going to align this and
123:44 - oh
123:44 - i didn't select all of them
123:50 - so these are the points
123:52 - and first i actually want to translate
123:54 - so
123:56 - the canvas
123:58 - before that i want to also save
124:00 - the context so save
124:05 - my language changed the keyboard
124:09 - translate
124:11 - to the reference x and the reference y
124:14 - so this is going to be a
124:16 - and just to remember at the end we also
124:19 - need to restore
124:21 - to the last state the canvas and here we
124:24 - begin a path and we say move to
124:30 - this location
124:36 - yes
124:39 - and then quadratic curve to
124:42 - i just copied this
124:44 - using this control point
124:50 - to
124:51 - this
124:52 - location
124:54 - let me actually cut these that i'm using
124:57 - already so that my
124:59 - i don't make mistakes
125:01 - and then
125:02 - another control point
125:07 - to this location
125:15 - and then another control point
125:20 - to this location
125:30 - what did i do wrong
125:35 - let's undo everything
125:43 - okay so this was the first i remove it
125:46 - so then you have control point
125:50 - to this location
125:57 - control point
126:01 - to this location
126:12 - control point
126:15 - to this location
126:23 - and control point to
126:26 - this location
126:32 - okay
126:35 - and uh maybe we want a stroke
126:38 - or
126:38 - actually a white fill but
126:41 - okay
126:42 - something is there it's not perfect i
126:45 - think the last click that i did
126:48 - needs to be
126:49 - actually perfect to the one in the
126:52 - beginning
126:54 - and i don't like this control point
126:58 - from here
127:00 - it should be
127:01 - higher up so
127:06 - i just moved it a bit okay and a little
127:09 - bit to the left i think
127:11 - i want it to be
127:13 - so
127:14 - five
127:17 - okay it's not that bad
127:20 - and of course this is now
127:23 - going to move with a but you can see
127:26 - it's not really
127:28 - great
127:30 - the way it's going to move with a
127:34 - needs to depend also on this slider in a
127:37 - way
127:38 - but it's something
127:40 - it's kind of like how uh
127:42 - yeah
127:44 - it's kind of like how glasses would look
127:46 - like on a person
127:48 - i think you could easily make glasses in
127:51 - this way
127:53 - let's actually try to consider
127:56 - glasses
127:58 - maybe i don't know i don't want glasses
128:01 - on this character i think
128:04 - but um
128:06 - so this is just one eye
128:13 - let's add another function here draw i
128:17 - like this
128:19 - and
128:20 - move the code
128:22 - from here
128:25 - to here
128:27 - and
128:28 - say now
128:33 - draw i
128:35 - so everything should be as before
128:38 - but
128:45 - if i'm gonna copy this
128:50 - now let's say
128:52 - scale
128:53 - minus 1 1 so i'm scaling on the
128:57 - horizontal axis
129:00 - basically flipping
129:03 - according to a
129:06 - to the a point
129:09 - then i'm getting
129:10 - here
129:12 - uh
129:14 - reverse
129:18 - okay begin path needs to go here
129:22 - there was some strange artifact there
129:24 - and now this kind of looks like the
129:27 - character
129:29 - has glasses
129:30 - um
129:32 - not eyes because the eye is somehow
129:35 - getting
129:36 - away from the
129:44 - out of the face
129:49 - i really like what what we are doing
129:51 - here
129:54 - i just hope this is possible to follow
129:56 - along i i think i'm definitely gonna
129:58 - publish this video it's gonna be long
130:01 - and some of the things may not be clear
130:03 - but comment below if you
130:06 - if you
130:07 - need some explanation about what i'm
130:09 - doing
130:10 - um
130:12 - yeah
130:16 - so
130:18 - let's actually have a function here
130:20 - called draw
130:23 - glass
130:26 - i
130:28 - draw a glass eye i will comment that is
130:31 - not used
130:33 - and uh
130:34 - now what i want to do is when we are
130:36 - drawing the eyes actually make these a
130:39 - little better so that the eye doesn't go
130:43 - out of the
130:45 - of the screen like that
130:48 - so
130:49 - [Music]
130:53 - what i want to do is on the positive
130:57 - value
130:58 - of this x i want to squish this i
131:04 - like that somehow
131:06 - so
131:11 - when i'm drawing the eyes i don't need
131:13 - just a reference point
131:15 - but i need also
131:22 - the x value there so
131:30 - how can i get it reasonably well
131:39 - i could store it inside of a
131:43 - as the value
131:49 - let's just do that so
131:52 - p dot
131:54 - x
131:56 - offset is equal to
132:01 - value
132:02 - so this is what
132:04 - is going to happen here
132:07 - and all of them will start having
132:10 - x offsets and y offsets
132:13 - equal to the value so it's just one way
132:17 - that i can do to
132:19 - pass
132:20 - this
132:21 - 0.6 value of my
132:25 - slider there
132:26 - from here
132:29 - to the point
132:31 - and now this reference point that i have
132:38 - here
132:39 - has this x offset as well
132:41 - so
132:42 - draw an eye
132:44 - with the reference x offset and this x
132:48 - offset is actually going to
132:56 - translate into the
133:00 - scale of the eye
133:07 - let's just do one eye first
133:10 - and
133:12 - let's call this value scale this
133:15 - parameter scale x
133:17 - and
133:21 - let's say here ctx
133:25 - scale
133:34 - one minus scale x
133:40 - and this is going to be something like
133:43 - a value there let's multiply it by
133:45 - something let's just see what happens
133:50 - oh
133:54 - okay this horizontally but vertically i
133:56 - don't want anything at least not yet so
133:58 - i just put hundred percent scaling
134:00 - vertically
134:02 - and now
134:04 - okay
134:09 - not what i want
134:11 - so the scaling
134:17 - the scaling that i'm doing here also
134:19 - needs to be restored afterwards
134:22 - after we draw that otherwise it affects
134:24 - the other eye as well and we don't want
134:27 - that
134:28 - so i'm gonna do this
134:31 - and now it affects only that eye
134:34 - but it's affecting way too much so
134:39 - i want it to affect less so this is why
134:42 - i mean here maybe multiply this by
134:49 - 0.3
134:51 - like that
134:53 - and now the i
134:56 - scales well but um
134:58 - here
135:00 - in the negative
135:02 - value it's still scaling
135:06 - it's stretching it
135:08 - more than the other eye and we don't
135:10 - want that i think that i only want this
135:13 - to happen
135:14 - for
135:15 - positive offsets
135:22 - so let's just put here math
135:25 - [Music]
135:33 - math
135:40 - max the maximum value of 0 and the x
135:44 - offset
135:45 - and
135:45 - let's see what happens
135:50 - yeah so now the eye doesn't stretch
135:53 - anymore i think it's kind of like what
135:55 - happens it does maybe get a little bit
135:58 - smaller when you do this but
136:01 - uh
136:02 - not very much the other one really
136:05 - becomes uh much smaller because of how
136:09 - um
136:10 - how the geometry of the of the face is
136:13 - it it starts to go behind the eye and
136:16 - also the nose goes in front of it so
136:19 - that's something that we will need to
136:21 - to think about
136:23 - um so
136:25 - when the eye shrinks horizontally like
136:28 - this
136:29 - it's it's good i think and we can put
136:32 - here a bigger value i think maybe 0.4
136:36 - yeah i think this looks great
136:38 - so the other one
136:45 - we'll see at the end some fine tunings
136:48 - if we're gonna change this in some way
136:50 - but um
136:52 - okay
136:52 - so
136:54 - how about the value here
136:57 - it's
136:59 - also needed so for the other eye when
137:01 - the head turns like this this one should
137:04 - also squish
137:06 - so now we have
137:13 - negative values there
137:16 - let's just put minus here i think
137:21 - yeah so that one squishes like that
137:25 - and the other one squishes like that and
137:28 - we see if we need to do anything
137:31 - for those cases when this is a negative
137:33 - and this is a
137:35 - positive there
137:36 - at the end but for now i like the way
137:39 - that this looks like and
137:45 - yeah i i think that this is pretty good
137:50 - so let me try to shape these eyes
137:54 - a bit more i'm going to draw
137:58 - actually i'm curious how it looks like
138:00 - with the glass eye
138:03 - as well so this one doesn't need the
138:05 - scaling
138:06 - i'm just going to put here
138:08 - draw glass eye on top of one eye and
138:12 - draw the other glass eye
138:20 - what happened
138:22 - why it doesn't work
138:27 - oh in the beginning everything is
138:29 - perfect there
138:31 - now it doesn't look that great
138:33 - i thought it would look somehow nice
138:35 - they would need some more adjustments i
138:38 - think so
138:40 - but okay a couple of things
138:44 - let's just remove and leave it as unused
138:46 - and maybe we adjust them later if we
138:49 - want glasses but i don't really like the
138:51 - idea
138:52 - the stroke here seems to be affected
138:55 - horizontally somehow
138:57 - the line thickness here at the bottom
139:03 - seems to be thicker than
139:05 - here
139:07 - i think that if i do the stroke after
139:10 - the restore
139:17 - yeah i don't get that effect anymore
139:19 - which is great
139:22 - i think it's great
139:24 - okay
139:25 - now vertically the eyes
139:28 - could also do something
139:51 - i think they should squish
139:53 - slightly
139:55 - so let's just put here
139:58 - uh
139:59 - ref.y offset
140:03 - and here as well
140:05 - and this is going to be scale y
140:10 - um
140:24 - okay and here
140:28 - one means nothing is going to happen
140:31 - but i want to
140:33 - if the scale y is something i want to
140:36 - make it smaller so it's going to be
140:38 - minus
140:39 - a fraction of this so scale y times
140:42 - 0.4 and because this is going to be
140:48 - negative and positive values but i want
140:51 - only positive here i'm going to take the
140:53 - absolute value of that
140:57 - so
141:04 - nothing seems to happen
141:06 - let me
141:09 - take the value from here and log it
141:31 - i don't think anything is happening
141:35 - but the values are good
141:38 - so let me call this
141:42 - vertical squish
141:44 - is equal to
141:46 - this which should work but it doesn't
141:51 - and um
141:55 - horizontal
141:56 - squish
141:58 - this one works
142:01 - already
142:13 - wow something bad happens there
142:16 - or
142:32 - oh
142:39 - this
142:45 - no now i lost the x behavior
142:55 - but the white behavior works what the
142:58 - what is happening
143:04 - oh
143:19 - no
143:20 - something is very weird
143:34 - it seems to squish the eyes but
143:36 - not the first time i'm
143:40 - uh
143:41 - i'm moving
143:43 - what is happening
143:51 - so the x offset
143:58 - should be good
144:01 - let's print a here
144:04 - x offset
144:07 - it's nothing but then i move y a little
144:10 - bit
144:14 - aha
144:15 - um
144:16 - i think i know
144:18 - so these offset values they should be
144:21 - something in the beginning um
144:24 - otherwise there is not a number there or
144:26 - undefined or something and it's causing
144:29 - some problems so let me put
144:34 - x offset is zero
144:37 - and
144:38 - y offset
144:41 - is zero in the beginning and we just use
144:44 - the ones from a at the moment but uh
144:47 - maybe we need the others at some point i
144:49 - i don't know
144:52 - so now
144:54 - yeah a y works
144:57 - just
144:58 - fine as i expect it to
145:01 - and here yeah this eye gets squished in
145:04 - the other way
145:10 - and that one like that
145:12 - uh
145:14 - some things i don't like in these
145:16 - extreme pose but i will probably not let
145:19 - it go
145:20 - all the way there so something like this
145:23 - is just fine
145:24 - and
145:25 - some rotation may be needed also to
145:28 - adjust these but this i'm gonna do later
145:31 - again it's just something for what looks
145:34 - good eventually so
145:38 - seems like i guessed the values quite
145:40 - well for the vertical movement i really
145:43 - like how that one
145:45 - happens
145:50 - here not sure if this would look better
145:54 - if everything here would be rotating a
145:56 - bit but
145:58 - when we have everything in the drawing
146:00 - then we will decide these
146:03 - things now it's just the shape of the
146:05 - eyes really
146:07 - so
146:08 - what i'm gonna do now is um
146:17 - yeah what i'm gonna do now
146:39 - it's good i like it
146:54 - okay so let's make the eye look like the
146:57 - actual eye in the drawing i still have
146:59 - about 15 minutes before i need to take a
147:02 - break
147:05 - and for that to happen
147:07 - i'm going to first
147:10 - instead of doing a stroke here i'm gonna
147:12 - do a fill
147:17 - like this so these are now white
147:19 - but
147:23 - let me make it
147:26 - fill style is equal to
147:29 - rgb a
147:31 - zero for red
147:34 - green
147:38 - maximum green but i'm gonna make it
147:41 - transparent so that i still see the
147:43 - shape behind
147:46 - all right this is
147:48 - good i think
147:50 - and i'm going to focus on this right eye
147:52 - again
147:52 - so
147:53 - there is one line here one curve
147:57 - going around the eye and this actually
148:07 - i think we already have the points for
148:09 - that one
148:10 - so here we started
148:13 - somewhere there and we had the quadratic
148:15 - curve like this
148:16 - the second quadratic curve
148:21 - might give us
148:23 - what we want here so i want to draw this
148:25 - black line
148:26 - here
148:27 - so
148:30 - i'm gonna move to
148:33 - this point which was the end of the
148:35 - first quadratic curve
148:45 - so begin path
148:51 - this restore i think can go here now
148:56 - and
148:57 - stroke
149:01 - okay
149:02 - that was fairly easy
149:05 - i think it's good and it doesn't align
149:08 - great with the other one i'll see later
149:10 - if i add some kind of
149:12 - randomness to somehow make it look more
149:14 - organic
149:15 - i just hope i have enough time
149:18 - and uh maybe this control point could be
149:22 - a little bit
149:27 - lower
149:30 - i don't know i think it's just good
149:33 - so last i want this
149:36 - not last but second last i want these
149:39 - eyebrows
149:41 - so
149:42 - let's do the eyebrows next
149:45 - and
149:46 - this is not going to be very easy
149:50 - i'm gonna start
149:52 - somewhere
149:54 - here
149:59 - and then
150:00 - a control point somewhere here
150:03 - another control point
150:05 - i mean end point of the first curve here
150:08 - and then a control point maybe here
150:12 - and another endpoint here
150:14 - another control point
150:17 - here another endpoint here
150:20 - and another control point here and
150:22 - another endpoint here with a little bit
150:24 - of adjustments we'll see
150:27 - so
150:28 - these are going to be the shapes of the
150:30 - eyebrows and i'm going to use
150:33 - fills for them
150:35 - but black a black fill
150:38 - because i really think that having an
150:40 - organic
150:42 - shape for this is important i'm not just
150:44 - going to draw a very thick line which is
150:46 - one way you could do this very quickly
150:50 - so
150:50 - i'm gonna
150:52 - i'm gonna
150:53 - go now
150:54 - move this restore to the bottom
150:57 - and begin a new path
151:05 - yeah i think this restore will have to
151:07 - need some thinking
151:09 - otherwise squished lines from previously
151:12 - might be but let's see but i'm gonna
151:15 - move to
151:17 - the first point from here
151:21 - and then quadratic curve to
151:30 - here
151:33 - and then quadratic curve
151:37 - to
151:40 - here
151:43 - and then
151:49 - quadratic curve
151:54 - to here
151:56 - and last but not least
152:00 - quadratic curve to actually the same
152:02 - point we start that
152:06 - my last click here was not that accurate
152:09 - so now with that
152:11 - let's stroke this one too
152:13 - no
152:15 - fill
152:19 - and it's actually green
152:23 - uh let me
152:25 - change it to black fill style
152:37 - okay not great yet but
152:41 - it's something
152:43 - and i don't really see everything
152:46 - because of this a point so let me just
152:48 - hide the point a for now
152:54 - eyebrows connecting there i don't think
152:56 - that's great
152:59 - so the start point could be
153:02 - more to the right i think maybe
153:07 - eight
153:10 - oh no this is this point
153:12 - i think that one was fine
153:14 - but uh
153:16 - actually the last control point this one
153:18 - yeah this could be
153:23 - maybe like that
153:27 - or even less
153:30 - yeah this is good
153:32 - i think
153:34 - let me comment out the eyes a little bit
153:40 - no too close it will look funny
153:43 - so
153:45 - these points are not very good there
153:47 - my clicking was not very accurate so let
153:50 - me
153:59 - put
154:00 - here how about the value of 0
154:05 - it's better maybe 0.01
154:12 - or even 0.2
154:15 - okay this is quite good and the this
154:18 - control point here
154:20 - from
154:21 - this one
154:24 - i think this needs to be more
154:27 - i mean
154:28 - less minus zero point zero
154:32 - four
154:34 - yeah i think this is good
154:37 - why not
154:40 - it looks quite okay
154:42 - some sharp corners around the edges here
154:45 - but
154:48 - let's try a bit bigger maybe six
154:52 - okay
154:53 - it's not bad i could fine tune these
154:56 - much more and i could use that bezier
154:58 - curve
155:00 - to which has two control points to get
155:03 - rounded corners
155:05 - to be more round or there's also the arc
155:08 - 2 method
155:09 - but
155:10 - i don't want to over complicate the code
155:12 - i prefer to use less methods more times
155:16 - because then it's
155:17 - more obvious what is happening
155:22 - and it looks it would look
155:24 - indistinguishable i think so
155:27 - okay
155:35 - it's not bad so this stroke thing is
155:38 - something that i complained about
155:41 - that
155:46 - yeah something will have to be done with
155:48 - this rotation if i consider these
155:50 - extreme
155:51 - sides but i said that i'm probably happy
155:54 - enough if this
155:56 - will be like the maximum
155:58 - movement range
156:01 - so it's fine it's no problem
156:04 - okay
156:06 - uh
156:08 - i want to get it done and not somehow um
156:14 - how to say
156:16 - not have
156:17 - nothing to show at the end or an
156:19 - incomplete thing so i prefer to have it
156:21 - not perfectly polished
156:23 - but somehow
156:25 - working
156:26 - and
156:32 - this is quite good i think so
156:34 - let me make these eyes now
156:38 - or let's draw also the arc for the
156:40 - circle so for the
156:43 - i
156:44 - um
156:47 - the dark part of the eye whatever it is
156:49 - the iris and the pupil somehow combined
156:52 - here so this is going to be just a
156:54 - single
156:55 - a simple circle let me put it
157:04 - here
157:06 - like this
157:08 - so
157:11 - yeah and if this stroke is somehow
157:13 - bothering that it squishes
157:17 - here like i said previously we can also
157:20 - move this here and do the restore before
157:23 - we do the final stroke there and i think
157:25 - that this is
157:26 - going to look exactly the same because
157:28 - the line and this part here are both
157:31 - black so
157:33 - oh
157:34 - how is this not giving me an error did i
157:40 - yeah anyway
157:42 - let's see but uh
157:48 - an arc so ctx begin path
157:53 - ctx
157:55 - arc
157:56 - at
157:57 - 0.17 and 0.09
158:01 - with the radius of
158:04 - i don't know i think i'm just gonna try
158:06 - to guess it
158:09 - zero and zero dot
158:12 - math dot pi times two
158:17 - and fill here
158:21 - oh i sure guessed it
158:23 - very small
158:28 - very big
158:29 - wow
158:34 - what
158:35 - oh
158:44 - okay
158:45 - maybe 0.6
158:50 - yeah
158:51 - it's actually not a great idea to use
158:53 - perfect circles like this i think that
158:56 - having slight ellipses would be better
159:00 - again something that i might polish in
159:02 - the end result
159:03 - but let me change now this
159:07 - green transparent fill style to white
159:11 - and
159:13 - now the eyes look kind of like the
159:15 - original eyes but they are
159:18 - animated
159:19 - in in a sense that
159:22 - they are controlled
159:25 - by this movement
159:27 - [Music]
159:34 - the pupils will need to move a little
159:36 - bit different than now otherwise it
159:39 - looks too much like these are not eyes
159:43 - but
159:46 - stickers that look like eyes
159:49 - and glued on top of the
159:51 - of the face
159:52 - so when looking up it's natural that
159:54 - these circles move a little bit
159:57 - upwards
159:59 - and so on
160:01 - so i will have to think about
160:04 - how that could be done
160:07 - again as a final fine tuning there
160:11 - but
160:12 - now this is
160:14 - good for now and
160:17 - i'm gonna have to go so i will come back
160:21 - a bit later today and try to do more of
160:24 - these graphical things
160:27 - i think i want to get it done today this
160:30 - kind of
160:33 - to get it to look like the original
160:35 - image and also move somehow
160:37 - and tomorrow i will try to make it maybe
160:41 - talk or
160:43 - something i i don't know yet and it
160:45 - depends on my speed so far it's been
160:47 - quite slow but i think that now i have
160:49 - enough tools with this kind of clicking
160:52 - to get coordinates and and whatever
160:57 - these are quite useful things that i
160:59 - have made
161:00 - and
161:01 - the eyes now were quite fast to do
161:04 - compared to when we started so
161:07 - i think things will speed up
161:11 - only speed up from now i hope
161:14 - depends what i will try to do later so
161:17 - i'm gonna stop the recording now and
161:19 - get back
161:21 - in a while
161:24 - okay i'm back now for three hours or so
161:29 - and i think that's all i can do today
161:31 - i'm getting pretty tired already
161:34 - so next what i want to do is um
161:39 - focus on the beard
161:41 - so i'm going to try to draw the beard
161:45 - and also
161:47 - have it go around the face like when the
161:49 - when the face is moving
161:51 - like like that
161:53 - it should wrap around nicely somehow
161:56 - so the way i'm gonna do it i'm gonna use
161:58 - the point a from previously
162:04 - the one here that i uh commented out
162:07 - previously so the beard is gonna be
162:12 - drawn
162:15 - relative to this point as well so
162:17 - similar as what we do with the eyes
162:20 - i think that that makes
162:22 - the most sense
162:24 - somehow let's see
162:30 - so
162:36 - i have draw eyes here
162:39 - let's have also
162:41 - draw
162:43 - beard
162:44 - according to the a reference point
162:47 - so we have a function
162:49 - um
162:51 - draw beard and let's have this point
162:54 - called
162:55 - the reference
162:57 - there
162:58 - and i'm gonna copy part of this code
163:01 - from here for the saving and translating
163:05 - but this part
163:08 - is not needed so
163:11 - now uh i still have activated here
163:16 - yeah
163:17 - these are coordinates relative to a
163:20 - now good
163:23 - so let me click here
163:26 - where this beard starts and
163:29 - actually
163:31 - i think i'm going to click here for the
163:33 - starting point
163:36 - so this is
163:37 - let me clear the
163:40 - console here
163:42 - and say
163:48 - click here
163:50 - and a control point should also
163:57 - be somewhere there
164:00 - maybe
164:02 - here and the end point will be this one
164:08 - now from here this changes curvature
164:12 - here so let me put
164:14 - another control point a bit
164:17 - higher here
164:19 - and then
164:21 - the final point here is going to be
164:24 - right in the middle so
164:26 - this is actually supposed to be zero but
164:29 - my clicking wasn't perfect
164:31 - so let me copy all of these things
164:34 - right here
164:36 - and
164:43 - remove those
164:44 - things from there
164:46 - and say
164:52 - begin path
164:56 - move to
164:58 - this point
165:03 - and then quadratic curve to
165:08 - using this control point
165:11 - to this location
165:16 - and the final one
165:20 - using this control point
165:24 - to this location
165:26 - like so and let's
165:30 - stroke this for now
165:33 - um
165:36 - and refresh
165:39 - yeah looks pretty nice like what i
165:41 - expected
165:43 - but when we rotate here
165:48 - it's not that bad
165:50 - there is a problem i think when we
165:51 - rotate other
165:53 - place here so
165:54 - similar kind of trick needs to happen
165:57 - as what we are doing with the
166:00 - squishing of this eye we are also going
166:02 - to have to squish this beard i think
166:06 - if that makes sense
166:10 - uh and we said that this is actually
166:12 - zero
166:13 - here the last point
166:18 - now it touches here perfectly
166:21 - okay
166:23 - so
166:25 - how do we do that
166:27 - squishing
166:30 - let's do it a bit later so
166:34 - now this is fine
166:38 - uh
166:50 - and i somehow like how this looks
166:53 - already when turning to one side
166:56 - this other side that's where the problem
166:58 - is
167:04 - maybe we do it now let me see how i did
167:06 - that before i i forgot
167:09 - okay we are calculating somehow
167:16 - a value for the
167:21 - we are using the offset
167:23 - as a scalar
167:25 - only on one side so um
167:35 - maybe we make
167:37 - the beard to be something like uh
167:40 - draw left beard or something
167:44 - but
167:44 - anyway
167:45 - let's see so
167:51 - scale x
167:55 - is gonna be
167:57 - that one
167:59 - and
168:05 - i'm just gonna copy this horizontal
168:08 - scaling for here from here
168:23 - like so and vertical just hundred
168:25 - percent for now so i'm not going to
168:27 - squish it in any way
168:29 - refresh
168:34 - something is wrong
168:36 - i'm squishing it now but i shouldn't
168:39 - this should happen on the other side
168:42 - this is happening because uh
168:45 - now i'm drawing this left side here but
168:48 - uh
168:49 - we were working with this eye primarily
168:52 - and this was just a mirrored part so i
168:55 - should actually work with the beard on
168:57 - the right side i i forgot what i'm doing
169:00 - so i'm just gonna mirror these
169:02 - coordinates by putting here
169:04 - plus plus
169:06 - plus plus
169:12 - and now the beard is there
169:15 - and when we rotate like this nothing
169:17 - happens to it it still looks pretty much
169:19 - the same
169:20 - on the other side
169:23 - it does get
169:24 - squished a bit
169:26 - but not enough i think it needs to be
169:28 - squished even more or
169:33 - or something needs to happen to this
169:35 - control point here i think
169:39 - this control point is somehow too
169:45 - too much going outside
169:49 - there
169:51 - so that the control point there is
169:57 - the one here
170:00 - and
170:01 - let me see if i can make this
170:05 - like that
170:25 - it doesn't seem to affect much
170:27 - okay now it affects way too much
170:35 - okay i think this looks pretty good
170:39 - okay
170:40 - and uh
170:42 - yeah
170:44 - let's
170:45 - check actually also vertically what
170:47 - happens
170:48 - so some squishing needs to happen there
170:51 - as well
170:52 - definitely
171:02 - okay and the other way
171:06 - this is quite good i think already
171:09 - so the vertical squishing
171:13 - let's actually start and do it in the
171:15 - same way as here
171:17 - for now
171:19 - and adjust it somehow so the vertical
171:22 - squishing something to do with this
171:24 - scale y
171:26 - so scale y is just the offset we don't
171:30 - do that
171:31 - only on one side at least not just yet
171:35 - so vertical squishing
171:40 - i mean
171:42 - scale y is equal to just that offset and
171:46 - let's put this value here
171:50 - and now
171:52 - yeah the beard gets squished somehow but
171:55 - it's not great
171:57 - i think
172:02 - and this is somehow too much so
172:06 - we don't want it to be like that i think
172:08 - so
172:18 - and the other scalar the horizontal i
172:21 - think needs to be bigger maybe
172:25 - 0.5
172:27 - so now what happens
172:29 - okay it's not good the line goes inside
172:31 - the eye i think point
172:34 - 45 is is nice
172:39 - yeah that's good and when going
172:41 - downwards like this
172:48 - the
172:49 - slider just goes way too much so i think
172:52 - that i'm gonna limit these sliders to go
172:56 - from
172:58 - minus
172:59 - 0.5
173:02 - to
173:03 - minus 0.5 there
173:09 - and the same for the positive
173:14 - so that the movement is not so extreme
173:17 - and that the 3d
173:19 - characteristics of the face don't
173:23 - interfere so much
173:30 - yeah
173:31 - and
173:32 - this one
173:37 - yeah i think that's just fine
173:41 - not perfect but
173:48 - somehow i liked
173:50 - the feeling of it i don't think they
173:52 - should be linear interpolations but
173:54 - something else but
173:57 - i'm quite happy with this at the moment
174:07 - yeah
174:08 - and um
174:13 - so we started up here
174:15 - now we got
174:16 - here
174:19 - and i'm going to actually connect this
174:22 - right part
174:24 - of the
174:25 - face so i'm going to go around it and
174:27 - connect it back here so let me add
174:31 - another line to
174:33 - here
174:34 - and then
174:39 - a line two so i'm gonna keep these as
174:42 - straight lines here they are maybe small
174:45 - curves but
174:48 - i just gonna
174:49 - i'm just gonna have a lot of line twos
174:52 - here
174:55 - and the last one is gonna be
174:58 - a curve to this point
175:02 - should use the same height for this one
175:06 - and then connect back to the starting
175:08 - point so all of these
175:11 - line two but the last one is going to be
175:13 - a quadratic
175:16 - quadratic curve
175:19 - too
175:20 - so going back to the beard
175:33 - and i'm gonna say here ctx line to
175:38 - this one
175:42 - and
175:43 - many other line twos
175:49 - okay
175:50 - let's close these like so
175:53 - and finally
175:54 - one quadratic curve two
175:58 - using this control point
176:02 - to this location the last one but here i
176:06 - want the same y value as we started
176:09 - which is the same it's great i clicked
176:11 - perfectly this time
176:12 - and i do want another line to the
176:15 - beginning
176:17 - or i can also call
176:20 - close path i think
176:22 - and it should do the connection probably
176:26 - let's see
176:28 - what did what is that
176:40 - what what is happening
176:42 - uh i'm missing a point
176:51 - here
177:07 - oh no the control point did i click here
177:10 - before i think i didn't
177:13 - this was the control point that i need
177:15 - to do
177:16 - um
177:18 - so
177:21 - this control point was here
177:24 - and another line to
177:26 - this one other point that i clicked
177:28 - earlier i think
177:30 - and this is just zero here let's
177:33 - keep it as such
177:36 - okay now this looks a bit better
177:44 - okay good
177:47 - and
177:48 - how does it look like so
177:50 - rotating like this
177:52 - looks quite nice
177:54 - like that
177:56 - doesn't look nice so here i want this
177:59 - point to actually extend
178:02 - all around the face now
178:07 - so that the beard covers everything
178:09 - so i'm gonna do that by
178:23 - working with this x offset so if the x
178:25 - offset is negative
178:32 - then these two points
178:35 - basically
178:37 - the control point and this other uh
178:41 - this point and the control point there
178:43 - need to be different need to move
178:45 - further away to keep the shape of the
178:47 - beard
178:48 - proper
178:49 - so
178:50 - i'm going to define those points as
178:54 - something so um
179:07 - do i want to use the linear
179:08 - interpolation and the range here
179:13 - probably
179:15 - so these would be initial starting
179:17 - points
179:18 - and then
179:20 - where did i use this lerp previously
179:25 - okay
179:27 - so
179:29 - we will define a new point we have a b c
179:33 - let's make d here
179:39 - so um
179:42 - d is going to be
179:48 - this value
179:49 - here
180:02 - hmm
180:10 - now i think i just
180:14 - call it here constant outermost
180:18 - point
180:21 - for the sides so let's have that one be
180:24 - equal to
180:26 - an x value
180:27 - and the y value
180:30 - and the x here is going to be
180:35 - this
180:37 - and the y is going to be this so our
180:40 - last point here will be
180:42 - outermost point x and outermost point y
180:48 - but
180:49 - when we
180:50 - if i refresh this it should look the
180:52 - same
180:53 - but
180:54 - now when we
180:56 - move like this our outermost point is
180:59 - going to be
181:02 - depending on
181:08 - the opposite
181:10 - of this offset
181:12 - but um
181:15 - scaled somehow
181:17 - and also not affecting here like that so
181:20 - only when
181:23 - that thing
181:25 - moves
181:26 - let's um
181:27 - move to the left so only when it's
181:29 - negative that means that
181:33 - minus
181:36 - math minimum of this offset
181:40 - and zero
181:42 - let's put zero in the beginning
181:44 - so i only keep the negative value and i
181:46 - multiply that by
181:50 - 0.4
181:56 - a bit too much i think
182:01 - 0.3 maybe
182:13 - i think i want to keep it
182:15 - seemingly in the same position so let's
182:18 - try 0.2
182:22 - i think i'm happy with that how it looks
182:25 - like
182:26 - and the control point
182:34 - i think control point is not bad let's
182:36 - see what happens when we move this one
182:38 - also
182:42 - okay
182:47 - okay
182:48 - so now when moving upwards like this
182:51 - we want our
182:53 - bottom point here to actually go
182:56 - down
182:58 - quite much so all the bottom part here
183:01 - should be
183:03 - should be black now
183:06 - so
183:07 - when the
183:08 - y offset
183:10 - is
183:12 - negative
183:17 - yeah something similar to this minus
183:20 - minimum of
183:21 - the y offset
183:24 - times probably something more here like
183:27 - three or so
183:34 - oh i'm moving this point so
183:38 - it's not good um
183:41 - okay
183:43 - outermost point just stays the same and
183:45 - let's call this right most point
183:48 - right most point
183:54 - and
183:58 - bottom most point
184:01 - so bottom most point is the one that is
184:05 - um
184:11 - this one
184:15 - and
184:16 - 0 for x
184:22 - like this
184:25 - and here we don't need to change that
184:27 - one so the bottom most point needs to be
184:30 - before this one
184:37 - and i just put here bought the most
184:40 - point x and bought the most point y
184:42 - so
184:51 - yeah
184:52 - now the beard is definitely continuing
184:56 - more than before it's a big space here
184:58 - now
185:00 - um i think i can get this scaler to go
185:03 - more maybe four
185:09 - good
185:10 - but
185:11 - i think i also want this control point
185:14 - to be affected somehow
185:16 - so i will call it
185:18 - control point
185:25 - and it will be
185:26 - this thing right here so
185:29 - let's
185:30 - let me copy this
185:32 - and
185:33 - say
185:41 - control point x control point y
185:46 - like this
185:48 - and
185:53 - now for
185:55 - this one it it also needs
185:57 - to go low like this but maybe not as
186:00 - much let's see
186:01 - so it will depend on on the y as well
186:07 - yes
186:08 - i think this shape here is much nicer
186:11 - now
186:12 - um it's good
186:26 - and when turning like this i actually
186:29 - think
186:30 - i want to
186:32 - yeah it should cover the neck here so
186:36 - for the control point we move it also
186:38 - like this
186:42 - so
186:46 - let's see what happens
186:51 - yeah now this covers the neck as well
186:54 - quite nicely
187:07 - it's
187:08 - fine
187:10 - i like it i think it's good
187:12 - so
187:14 - now that we have this beard on one side
187:16 - done i'm gonna do it on the other side
187:19 - in the same way
187:21 - let's try also with the other
187:26 - yeah
187:27 - something weird happens with the eyes
187:29 - there when moving really fast but
187:35 - i don't actually know if they should
187:37 - squish so much
187:39 - maybe not even at all
187:41 - let me remove
187:43 - make the eyes squish a bit less
187:45 - vertically so
187:47 - here when drawing the eyes vertically
187:50 - vertical squish
187:52 - let's put this
187:55 - 0.3 there
188:03 - even 0.2 i think it doesn't need to be
188:06 - so noticeable
188:22 - and uh
188:24 - this might apply also to the beard as
188:27 - well i think now they're somehow out of
188:29 - sync
189:09 - i need to adjust these values a little
189:11 - bit so this bottom most point
189:15 - too much going now
189:17 - and i think the control points
189:19 - as well
189:33 - yeah i think it's fine
189:35 - so let me
189:36 - now
189:37 - extract all of these things that we did
189:40 - here
189:44 - in the same way that we did for the eye
189:46 - so
189:47 - we are passing here
189:51 - some values for these offsets
189:59 - for scale x and scale y so let's say
190:02 - function
190:04 - draw
190:08 - beard
190:09 - draw half
190:11 - beard
190:13 - and scale x scale y so very similar to
190:16 - the other function for draw
190:19 - i
190:20 - or half eyes
190:22 - if that makes any sense
190:24 - so what we are going to do is
190:27 - say here draw half beard
190:31 - with
190:32 - this for scale x
190:36 - and
190:38 - this for scale
190:40 - y
190:51 - and we also need some other stuff here
191:05 - the minimum of zero and fx offset this
191:08 - is actually the same as our scale x so
191:13 - here
191:14 - i can actually
191:18 - replace with that
191:23 - and the minimum of zero and y offset
191:26 - this is something we don't have
191:28 - so
191:29 - um
191:31 - the bottom most
191:32 - point
191:33 - scaler
191:38 - i might call this some something like
191:42 - an anchor or something i'm not sure
191:46 - what would be the proper term
191:49 - but um
191:52 - let's say beard scaler
191:55 - or no
192:02 - it's something there so draw half beard
192:07 - bottom
192:10 - the bottom scaler will be the first the
192:12 - last thing here so
192:14 - minimum between
192:16 - 0 and y offset
192:18 - so bottom
192:20 - scaler
192:24 - bottom
192:26 - scaler and i'm just going to put
192:31 - one these
192:31 - the other for better readability
192:36 - and
192:38 - yeah let me just copy everything here
192:43 - like so
192:45 - put them in the new function
192:47 - and scale x doesn't need to be defined
192:50 - here anymore
192:52 - the squish is still good scale y is
192:56 - here now
192:57 - and this bottom scaler is going to be
193:01 - a third parameter
193:04 - for stretching the beard down to cover
193:08 - the neck
193:09 - let's refresh
193:11 - and
193:13 - everything still seems to work
193:30 - okay
193:35 - oh something is wrong there
193:45 - it's completely opposite here so
193:51 - i messed up something
193:54 - scale x
194:00 - um
194:23 - okay
194:24 - i'm missing something there i think it
194:26 - was a minimum
194:28 - of
194:32 - i think it was a minimum of
194:36 - minus this and let's rename these
194:40 - uh this will be
194:41 - [Music]
194:42 - vertical
194:44 - scalar
194:45 - and the last one will be horizontal
194:48 - scalar
194:49 - so this horizontal scaler is actually
194:52 - going to be
194:52 - [Music]
194:54 - here i shouldn't have renamed
194:57 - to scale x i think it was a different
195:00 - value there
195:01 - i hope
195:04 - no
195:08 - or maybe
195:21 - was it plus
195:24 - i think some minus plus thing here is
195:27 - going to fix it
195:29 - somehow
195:43 - no i think it was minus but uh
195:49 - without the minus
195:51 - yeah okay now now it's good this
195:54 - stretches out like that
195:58 - okay great
196:00 - so
196:01 - we have draw half beard uh how was the
196:03 - code doing the eyes it was scaling
196:06 - something and then
196:07 - drawing the other eye
196:09 - with the minus
196:12 - here
196:14 - so
196:15 - let's do the scaling
196:17 - here
196:19 - and the other
196:21 - half of the beard
196:26 - really horizontally is what everything
196:29 - matters i think vertically they behave
196:31 - the same
196:33 - so maybe putting it in both places is
196:36 - correct
196:39 - okay
196:58 - i don't know what happens there
197:14 - something strange happens there
197:23 - maybe the last one doesn't need the
197:25 - minus somehow i'm tired now and i
197:28 - don't
197:32 - no not there
197:40 - okay
197:44 - i just hope that i don't need to do the
197:46 - math and it
197:47 - it magically works
197:52 - but something is wrong so
197:59 - um
198:01 - am i restoring properly
198:05 - so draw half beard we have a scale
198:10 - we don't have a restore so here we have
198:13 - draw the eye
198:15 - starting with the save
198:17 - restore and stroke
198:19 - so
198:20 - draw half beard
198:23 - let's save this
198:25 - and
198:27 - i hope this is correct
198:31 - restore and stroke
198:39 - okay
198:40 - this looks good
198:41 - and vertically
198:45 - oh yeah
198:48 - i'm quite happy with this i think some
198:50 - things could be much better but um
198:54 - this is nice i really like it
199:00 - and notice that the lines i drew in the
199:02 - beginning those are just some kind of
199:04 - reference and i'm really looking at
199:06 - these um
199:08 - new lines that i'm drawing now and at
199:10 - the animation
199:12 - so maybe i draw the
199:15 - beginning lines
199:18 - gray somehow
199:24 - so the draw body and the draw head
199:27 - um
199:29 - line
199:31 - stroke
199:32 - color
199:35 - is it stroke color no stroke style
199:40 - i think
199:41 - gray
199:46 - yeah but after i do that i make it black
199:50 - again
199:51 - so
199:52 - this is now for this head
199:55 - lines
199:56 - here they are gray
199:58 - um
200:02 - light gray
200:05 - too too light gray is just fine so they
200:08 - are not as striking and the other as the
200:10 - other ones and i'm gonna do the same
200:12 - for the body so draw the body
200:17 - like that and the
200:19 - black
200:20 - there
200:21 - after we
200:22 - oh what happened no
200:27 - before
200:31 - i'm not in the right function am i
200:33 - it's draw beard
200:36 - i want drop body
200:38 - so for the draw body um
200:45 - so that it's not so
200:46 - in our face here and we look at the just
200:50 - the
200:50 - uh emphasized lines so now when we are
200:53 - looking at the
200:55 - dark lines we see the character moving
200:58 - as he should be moving
201:01 - now the nose is something
201:03 - that i want to do next
201:05 - and it's kind of
201:11 - silly because in the original
201:13 - nose like
201:15 - let me
201:17 - actually comment out everything for now
201:23 - so here the nose is somehow like it's
201:25 - broken to the side when the character is
201:28 - looking forwards but it looks kind of
201:30 - okay
201:31 - i don't think we can do something like
201:33 - this now the nose
201:36 - will
201:37 - look somehow different
201:46 - needs to look somehow different
201:51 - and it could be weird when you see the
201:54 - character from the front but
201:57 - let's see i'm gonna draw the nose as a
202:00 - straight line
202:01 - actually
202:04 - so i need two points
202:06 - and this control point
202:09 - let's see
202:13 - not the straight line i'm gonna draw it
202:15 - with the curve so let's say here
202:18 - uh
202:24 - something like that
202:27 - and
202:28 - i'm going to say
202:31 - ctx
202:34 - this should also be yeah it's relative
202:36 - to a i didn't change that clicking
202:39 - function yet let's make it draw nose
202:44 - um sorry
202:46 - we're still in the head
202:47 - so in the head
202:50 - draw nose relative to a
202:53 - again
202:54 - so function
202:56 - draw nose
202:58 - reference point
203:00 - and the
203:01 - ctx
203:03 - begin path
203:06 - ctx
203:08 - move to
203:09 - 0 0.2
203:12 - ctx
203:13 - quadratic curve
203:16 - 2
203:18 - using minus 0.05
203:21 - 0.27
203:25 - to go to zero point
203:28 - actually zero i just clicked wrong it
203:31 - should be the same vertical in the
203:33 - middle and uh
203:35 - 0.34
203:39 - yeah and the ctx stroke
203:43 - like that
203:46 - i don't know what happened
203:50 - um
203:51 - i need the translating also so i forgot
203:55 - this code right here we need to
203:57 - translate to the reference point before
203:59 - we do that and restore when we are done
204:02 - with with that
204:04 - okay now this is the
204:07 - nose here
204:08 - a little bit different shape than before
204:12 - and
204:14 - i don't like it
204:15 - so
204:18 - this bottom most point needs to be a bit
204:20 - higher let's say three
204:22 - and this control point
204:25 - more to the side i
204:27 - clicked on it i should have clicked
204:28 - outside of it if you remember how bezier
204:32 - curves work
204:33 - and it looks kind of too roundish i
204:36 - don't like it i think it needs to be
204:38 - also lower
204:43 - a bit better and maybe just
204:46 - 0 9 here
204:49 - i think this is ok
204:52 - maybe i use the bezier
204:55 - also but
204:57 - later in the fine tuning if i still have
204:59 - energy for it
205:00 - so
205:01 - it looks okayish maybe not not really
205:04 - great
205:05 - in that side and then in the other side
205:08 - it's it's pretty much horrible so this
205:10 - is why we need to modify this control
205:14 - point so this is the tip of the nose
205:17 - tip of the nose is going to be
205:20 - having an x and a y
205:24 - and
205:26 - the
205:27 - x
205:27 - is going to depend on this
205:33 - x offset
205:37 - so
205:41 - let's just say here ref.x offset
205:45 - and
205:46 - probably we have to scale it down a lot
205:48 - but anyway and the y is going to be
205:53 - same as here
205:55 - i think
205:57 - like that so here we just put tip dot x
206:00 - and tip dot
206:02 - y
206:03 - like this and what's wrong here
206:10 - is equal to a new object like that
206:14 - so now the nose is a line which is not
206:16 - really great uh but
206:19 - at least it's
206:21 - okay
206:24 - yeah so this needs to be less
206:27 - emphasized now
206:29 - so a fraction of this x offset
206:52 - i'm going to leave it as a line for now
206:54 - even though i want to do something about
206:57 - it later
206:58 - i want to think about some better better
207:01 - style for the nose maybe
207:04 - but
207:05 - at least
207:06 - a line is is something that we can deal
207:09 - with and
207:13 - it's not bad
207:15 - i think a bezier curve here would be
207:18 - better like that one that has two
207:19 - control points
207:22 - points
207:23 - and uh do something about the line
207:28 - to do
207:32 - okay
207:33 - great now
207:36 - let's do the top part and i'm gonna
207:39 - i got this idea while i was on the break
207:42 - previously that i want to have the hair
207:46 - quite dynamic
207:48 - like
207:48 - when the character moves his head the
207:51 - hair moves
207:54 - realistically somehow
207:57 - so
207:58 - i'm now just gonna make a black
208:01 - shape around here and i'm gonna draw
208:04 - these spikes
208:06 - only
208:07 - only later
208:10 - if that makes sense i'm gonna draw them
208:12 - using some physics
208:14 - so when the character for example moves
208:16 - his head like this the hair is going to
208:20 - be
208:20 - affected
208:22 - by
208:22 - these uh
208:25 - by those physics there and i notice now
208:27 - a problem here at the beard these
208:31 - lines there the last
208:34 - previous
208:35 - second to last line two has to have an x
208:38 - of zero
208:39 - what happens there
208:42 - draw a beard
208:49 - this one
208:54 - oh no what happened
208:59 - no after that this one this has to be
209:01 - zero
209:04 - yeah and the the the beards don't need
209:07 - to be stroked
209:08 - they need the fill
209:10 - so
209:12 - and not white phil it looks like santa
209:14 - claus
209:16 - i need to put um ctx fill style to black
209:21 - so i forgot those parts
209:23 - okay much much better now
209:28 - nice
209:30 - and
209:32 - yeah let's do the
209:36 - top part
209:38 - of the head next
209:43 - top part of the
209:45 - hair this black part and then do the
209:47 - physics somehow let's see
209:52 - so
209:53 - i really think i'm over complicating
209:55 - myself but it doesn't look so realistic
209:58 - and i think it needs more personality
210:00 - somehow so that physics is gonna make
210:02 - things much more much nicer i i i hope
210:10 - let's see
210:13 - so um
210:18 - uh
210:21 - half
210:22 - hair is going to be the the thing that
210:25 - is going to be drawn here somehow
210:28 - to do the top shape of the head
210:31 - of the
210:32 - some black lines here basically
210:35 - uh
210:38 - yeah and it should continue with the
210:40 - beard
210:42 - at least on this side and then
210:45 - maybe i'm gonna
210:48 - make these
210:49 - crazy things there these shapes as well
210:53 - i wonder if it's a good idea or not
211:00 - i think it's a
211:07 - not the great idea
211:10 - let's just pretend i have a very
211:13 - small
211:14 - haircut like very short hair
211:17 - just coloring the head for now and think
211:20 - what to do with those later
211:24 - so draw beard
211:28 - draw
211:30 - hair
211:32 - also with a as the reference point i
211:35 - think
211:41 - yeah we didn't really need b and c
211:43 - we would need them if we want to rotate
211:45 - the head like this but i don't want to
211:48 - do that it's just too much work
211:51 - too much trouble now so this is just
211:55 - really fine by me
212:03 - i kind of like we forgot about the nose
212:06 - when it's connected to
212:09 - scaling the nose vertically we forgot
212:11 - that but i kind of like it that it
212:13 - connects to the beard only when pointing
212:16 - down or when pointing up like this it
212:18 - somehow gives more
212:20 - personality i i think it's a mistake
212:23 - that i want to keep
212:25 - some okay let's do the head part
212:29 - what oh draw hair not defined yes
212:32 - so
212:33 - i'm going to copy draw beard
212:38 - pretty much like this
212:40 - and
212:42 - call it draw hair
212:45 - and it's going to be draw half here
212:50 - and draw half here
212:53 - and now i'm going to copy draw half
212:55 - beard
212:56 - and make it like that but change the
212:59 - coordinates somehow
213:00 - so
213:02 - let's see if we can do both at once even
213:04 - though i have a bad feeling about this
213:07 - so draw half beard
213:09 - uh
213:10 - now becomes
213:12 - draw half hair
213:14 - and
213:16 - move to
213:18 - so this point
213:25 - yeah
213:26 - air conditioner makes some strange noise
213:28 - here so
213:30 - this case
213:32 - is uh
213:36 - so draw half here
213:41 - uh this point is
213:44 - this point here so i definitely want to
213:45 - keep it
213:46 - the next one
213:49 - i would like to draw a line
213:51 - to somewhere here but with a very big
213:54 - curve like that so
213:56 - let's
213:57 - have here a control point maybe
214:01 - here
214:02 - and
214:04 - here the center point
214:06 - so
214:07 - quadratic curve to
214:10 - and
214:12 - i should draw the right side always so
214:14 - the right side is the base and the other
214:17 - one is reflected so
214:20 - this is plus
214:26 - 0.47 47
214:29 - and
214:31 - minus 0.
214:35 - 44.
214:36 - and here we have a 0
214:39 - and a
214:41 - minus zero point
214:44 - 44 really i clicked on the same y
214:48 - okay so this is now
214:50 - going like that
214:52 - and i want to go also upwards up to this
214:55 - point right here which is
214:59 - point b
215:01 - so
215:02 - the next
215:05 - it's actually going to be a line
215:07 - to a vertical line
215:09 - to
215:14 - b i think so b dot x and b dot
215:18 - y
215:23 - no need for this part
215:25 - and then uh going back down from b to
215:29 - this outer connecting part at least
215:33 - so um
215:35 - a quadratic curve to
215:38 - and
215:39 - a control point maybe here
215:42 - and
215:43 - that point i'm going to have to copy
215:45 - from somewhere but let's just click
215:47 - click it for now so this is going to be
215:51 - the control point and the last one
215:53 - is going to be
216:03 - the right most point so it's complicated
216:05 - with some scalar and things like that so
216:08 - let's just do this
216:10 - and
216:14 - put here right most point x
216:18 - and uh
216:20 - right most point
216:22 - y
216:24 - no need for
216:26 - maybe no need for control points
216:29 - we see later
216:30 - we might have to adjust this when the
216:32 - rotations happen
216:35 - and the close path so that
216:40 - the small line here gets drawn also
216:43 - and let's have this
216:45 - let's have it the field
216:47 - as before
216:48 - and refresh the page
216:55 - oh my
217:05 - oh
217:28 - oh boy
217:31 - the b is not good anymore because i'm
217:34 - remember i'm giving here relative to a
217:36 - so i need the new new point i'm just
217:38 - going to put the dot here
217:41 - minus 0.57
217:43 - so
217:46 - 0 and
217:48 - minus 0.57 so that's why the pointy head
217:52 - is there like that
217:55 - i think it can be even higher up so
217:59 - minus 0.6
218:01 - 65
218:05 - okay let's disable a b and c so that i
218:08 - see
218:09 - something there i don't think we're
218:11 - gonna need b and c
218:13 - for
218:14 - much let's say
218:16 - maybe later
218:18 - but i'm gonna disable
218:21 - code printing them there now so that i
218:23 - see what is happening here a little bit
218:26 - of a pointy tip here but i don't mind
218:34 - the inside part is great the outside
218:38 - part is not good
218:41 - and
218:49 - and something weird happens here so
218:57 - not much weird happens there but
219:00 - i do need this control point to be
219:04 - further away
219:05 - so
219:12 - something like that and i have a feeling
219:15 - this one needs to be somehow
219:17 - um
219:33 - this control point and it may need to be
219:38 - tailored in the same way for this right
219:39 - most point
219:42 - yeah maybe a bit too much let's say
219:47 - 60.
219:49 - i think that's good and let's make it
219:52 - higher up like also 0.6 both of these i
219:55 - think
219:56 - it's um
219:58 - this is fine
220:02 - mm-hmm
220:11 - okay
220:12 - and the y value
220:24 - yeah
220:25 - i'm quite happy with this
220:28 - i think
220:35 - i somehow don't like that it's getting
220:42 - so squished there but um
220:46 - like here it's squishing the forehead
220:50 - um yeah
220:52 - anyway it's
220:54 - it's fine
221:03 - hmm
221:19 - i think we will need to use b and c
221:21 - eventually
221:28 - maybe we see
221:31 - okay
221:34 - uh
221:36 - but something is really wrong like this
221:38 - like if if somebody is moving their head
221:42 - down like that
221:44 - you expect
221:46 - this part to stay up to somehow
221:49 - a lot of black hair needs to be needs to
221:52 - be there
221:54 - so
221:55 - moving head down like this
221:58 - should have that effect that
222:03 - that part doesn't
222:06 - go down
222:07 - so
222:08 - when we draw this we have the rightmost
222:10 - point
222:15 - for this connection
222:18 - and we also have
222:26 - this is the starting then we have the
222:28 - curve here
222:30 - let's say this is good
222:33 - and then the line two here this point
222:36 - this is something that is not great at
222:38 - the moment
222:39 - so this needs to be
222:42 - somehow with this vertical
222:47 - squish maybe
223:12 - no
223:23 - so there is some squishing here
223:24 - happening let's disable it because i
223:26 - forgot exactly what it's doing
223:33 - okay this actually looks much
223:35 - much better now
223:38 - but we do
223:39 - need something
223:45 - yeah this looks much much better now
223:48 - but we do need something for
223:54 - keeping this point up there
224:00 - and probably also controlling this
224:02 - control point of it
224:06 - so i think
224:08 - we need something similar to
224:12 - yeah
224:12 - let's just go and look at the beard
224:15 - again
224:16 - and the bottom most point we will need
224:19 - something like a topmost point
224:23 - so
224:28 - top most point
224:31 - and this is going to be this value here
224:34 - so
224:37 - maybe that
224:38 - and
224:40 - let's move this
224:43 - like so
224:45 - this one here where it's needed
224:48 - and um
224:50 - topmost point x
224:54 - and topmost point
224:56 - y like this
224:58 - so
224:59 - now
225:12 - this is good i like it
225:14 - apart from these control points that
225:16 - need to be done but it also needs to
225:19 - continue to happen so
225:23 - this vertical scaler
225:27 - from there
225:30 - i think should happen all the time
225:33 - so we have here
225:37 - this one and i'm using a minimum value
225:40 - there what happens if i just put the
225:43 - offset
225:45 - i'm doing it just on the right side but
225:50 - yeah
225:51 - this is better now
225:54 - so a different way for calculating this
225:57 - vertical scaler here
225:59 - and i'm going to do the same thing also
226:01 - on the left side
226:03 - and
226:04 - i'm going to need to
226:06 - do that also with the control points
226:10 - so
226:11 - the control point
226:14 - let's see how i did it for the beard
226:16 - previously
226:18 - so
226:25 - i think
226:29 - i just figure it out somehow
226:31 - here so draw
226:35 - uh
226:36 - this was the control point so
226:40 - control point
226:45 - 0.6
226:47 - 0.6
226:50 - minus
226:52 - vertically it's what needs to happen so
226:59 - minus this same thing i think might be
227:02 - good
227:08 - not really
227:09 - oh i'm not using it
227:11 - control point
227:14 - x
227:16 - and then control point
227:19 - y
227:22 - e
227:24 - what happened
227:31 - oh it was minus
227:38 - yeah okay
227:44 - okay i kind of like this
227:47 - way that these things are looking i like
227:49 - that the forehead now stays larger
227:53 - and
227:56 - head seems to be moving fine
228:13 - yeah there should definitely be some
228:14 - kind of rotation happening
228:17 - but
228:18 - it's way too much i don't think i will
228:20 - have time for that
228:33 - and this one
228:44 - yeah okay it's it's fine
228:54 - okay
229:19 - somehow the shape of the head is not
229:21 - great
229:26 - i think the
229:27 - horizontal scaler is also something that
229:32 - needs to be used here maybe
229:37 - in the control point
229:43 - maybe in the other way minus horizontal
229:45 - scaler
229:47 - i'm a bit tired now and i just can't
229:50 - concentrate on the math i'm just playing
229:52 - around with the numbers i know that one
229:54 - of them is supposed to work
229:58 - um
229:59 - but
230:01 - let's try 0.3 for the head
230:05 - i'm just playing with the values so that
230:07 - this
230:08 - looks more
230:13 - no not there
230:19 - so that it looks good to me
230:28 - yeah okay
230:37 - i think we are fine for now
230:56 - okay
231:01 - let's draw something easy like the body
231:03 - next
231:04 - so i do have the neck
231:07 - here and the kind of shape for for this
231:10 - body
231:12 - but um
231:30 - and actually
231:32 - let's also add colors so that's let's
231:35 - add the color for the skin
231:37 - i'm gonna
231:46 - i'm gonna get the color from here using
231:49 - some color picker tool
231:51 - i will
231:53 - do a print screen and i open paint you
231:56 - won't be able to see this but
231:59 - i get the color picker in paint and then
232:02 - i look at the color values
232:06 - so
232:08 - they are
232:10 - exactly
232:14 - red
232:19 - green
232:22 - and
232:27 - blue
232:31 - like so
232:32 - so what i'm gonna do
232:34 - with that is where we are drawing the
232:36 - head here i'm going to put um
232:52 - a fill here
232:58 - and the fill style
233:04 - let's say skin tone
233:08 - and i'm gonna define this skin tone
233:10 - somewhere at the top for now
233:17 - rgb
233:20 - with these things
233:23 - and the refreshing now
233:26 - doesn't do anything
233:29 - weird
233:30 - so i'm drawing the head
233:37 - why isn't it coloring
233:48 - oh
233:49 - these are the
233:50 - mid lines um i think the these ones are
233:53 - the outside yes something like that
233:56 - but now these points on the sides
234:00 - are way too too much i want these to be
234:02 - inside of the hair region
234:10 - yeah so
234:11 - minus
234:13 - 0.4 i think
234:21 - too much
234:22 - 0.45
234:27 - okay this is good
234:29 - maybe
234:32 - yeah starts to look like some real
234:37 - real character there now with the skin
234:40 - colored in
234:42 - okay something here is not quite right
234:51 - and
234:53 - also here something is not quite right
235:26 - yeah let's
235:30 - starts to be tiring already
235:37 - here it's not perfectly filling this
235:40 - shape
235:58 - let's just leave this for
236:00 - for a moment and worry about that a bit
236:03 - later
236:06 - i would like to use somehow the previous
236:08 - coordinates that we are calculating
236:10 - there but i have a feeling it's not so
236:12 - easy
236:14 - because of the symmetries and what we
236:17 - are trying to do
236:30 - we leave it for now
236:33 - uh let's just get other stuff that is
236:36 - more easy to do because my head doesn't
236:38 - work very much now
236:40 - so
236:42 - i'm gonna do this
236:44 - neck and the body there
236:47 - so when we are moving the head to the
236:50 - right like this
236:54 - i would also like to
236:57 - maybe move also
237:00 - part of the
237:01 - neck a little bit
237:03 - some kind of movement
237:06 - should happen otherwise it just looks
237:08 - like you're some
237:10 - rotating head on the
237:12 - on a screw there on some
237:14 - metal
237:16 - structure
237:18 - also when we are drawing the body
237:29 - i want to
237:35 - feel it some ctx
237:38 - fill and
237:42 - ctx fill style equals to skin tone
237:49 - yeah that's good
238:14 - okay but the lines here are not very
238:18 - thick i think
238:23 - what happens there
238:26 - should the stroke be after the fill or
238:33 - yeah i guess that was it
238:35 - okay
238:36 - now
238:38 - yeah what i was saying that
238:41 - for example
238:42 - one of the points here i think it's
238:45 - probably the first one
238:47 - and the last one where we are
238:52 - going here
238:55 - so these points i would like to somehow
238:57 - connect to
239:00 - a the a offset in some way
239:04 - so
239:05 - plus
239:06 - a dot offset
239:11 - x offset
239:13 - i think that's enough but
239:17 - [Music]
239:19 - scaled somehow
239:33 - i don't know what happened
239:34 - let's remove it from here have it just
239:36 - in one place
239:49 - very strange
240:16 - oh
240:18 - okay these values are just so small
240:21 - uh
240:30 - something like this maybe
240:34 - yeah now the neck somehow
240:39 - rotates in that way moves in that way
240:42 - somehow and i i like that movement and
240:45 - i'm gonna do a similar thing for this
240:48 - other one so
240:52 - like that
240:56 - it somehow looks a bit better
241:00 - yeah
241:02 - okay good
241:06 - also this one would be nice i think
241:10 - so
241:11 - we have
241:23 - the y offset effecting there
241:27 - and
241:27 - i think i'm gonna do the same
241:32 - here as well
241:34 - i don't know if this is going to be a
241:36 - great tutorial i don't think it is a
241:38 - great tutorial but um
241:42 - many of these things would need to have
241:44 - proper names
241:46 - for the variables
241:48 - but it will end up into something
241:52 - that
241:53 - i'm gonna find a use for
241:56 - okay it
241:58 - doesn't seem to
242:01 - to behave
242:04 - and then i don't think i'm gonna work
242:06 - with this code very much anymore after
242:08 - it's done and
242:10 - something useful
242:13 - but uh let's see so
242:17 - at least somehow the
242:20 - ideas of having different keyframes and
242:22 - interpolating between the frames somehow
242:25 - should
242:26 - be should be
242:30 - clear to some extent
243:00 - okay what is happening there i want to
243:02 - disable the head
243:09 - just to focus on the body
243:14 - it's doing something but not
243:17 - not very
243:18 - visible it's just behind
243:22 - everything there
243:26 - so
243:31 - yeah
243:33 - okay
243:44 - let's put
243:46 - what
243:54 - a smaller value there
244:26 - um
244:34 - doesn't seem to
244:36 - affect very much
244:43 - and i think this is flipped yeah this
244:45 - should be
244:47 - minus
244:49 - that offset
244:53 - yeah let's see so now if i go back here
244:56 - and
244:58 - reactivate this
245:03 - no
245:12 - no no
245:37 - uh
245:44 - so this
245:46 - at the
245:47 - negative side should be up
245:54 - oh no it wasn't flipped damn i
246:00 - i don't like this i'm getting tired
246:03 - i had a long day already
246:23 - uh
246:26 - maybe this is fine
246:28 - i think the control point is the issue
246:31 - we don't really see the change bit
246:33 - because the control point stays the same
246:36 - and then the changes when this head is
246:39 - moving so
246:42 - it's not that
246:48 - yeah it's not that significant it is
246:50 - moving a little bit
246:52 - but not not very much
246:57 - and this is a bit too much i think so
247:00 - when we draw the body
247:08 - maybe half of this is
247:13 - enough
247:16 - yeah it doesn't need to be exaggerated
247:25 - mm-hmm
247:36 - okay
247:40 - now the clothes so
247:43 - let me
247:45 - comment out this body part
247:50 - for now
247:51 - and
247:53 - draw these clothes somehow
247:55 - so i'm gonna do this
248:01 - trying to copy these shapes here
248:05 - so
248:07 - yeah
248:20 - i don't need to
248:23 - uh
248:33 - this get chords uh i don't want this to
248:36 - be an offset relative to
248:40 - a anymore i want the original code
248:43 - so that
248:44 - i just get the coordinates inside the
248:48 - screen where i'm clicking
248:51 - like this
248:52 - so now
248:54 - i'm gonna click here and i'm gonna say
248:57 - add the control point somewhere outside
249:00 - here
249:02 - and then
249:04 - another point here
249:06 - another control point here
249:10 - another point here
249:20 - control point here
249:24 - a point here
249:27 - control point here
249:29 - and point here so that's going to be
249:32 - that side on the left
249:35 - and
249:43 - now in the body
249:54 - okay
249:56 - so
249:57 - doing now um
250:00 - begin path
250:02 - and then move to
250:09 - move to
250:10 - this one
250:12 - in the beginning
250:14 - and then this quadratic curve 2
250:18 - where we use this as a control point
250:23 - and go here
250:27 - and then use this as a control point
250:31 - to go
250:33 - here
250:37 - and another one
250:38 - where we use this is the control point
250:43 - to go
250:44 - here
250:50 - and the last one where we use
250:52 - this as the control point
250:57 - to go here
251:04 - okay ctx
251:07 - stroke
251:12 - yeah this is fine maybe here
251:18 - i don't like this control point very
251:21 - much
251:22 - i mean this end point
251:27 - now this control point here this needs
251:30 - to be more to the right
251:32 - i think
251:41 - negative value so it grows like that
251:45 - okay
252:06 - okay maybe that's not the problem the
252:07 - next control point here maybe should be
252:10 - a bit more upwards
252:16 - yeah i like this shape now much better
252:18 - here
252:20 - okay
252:21 - so that's
252:23 - one side there
252:25 - and we can fill it with that kind of
252:27 - green color i'm just going back into
252:30 - paint to
252:31 - get the color code of that color
252:36 - 154
252:40 - 153
252:42 - and one
252:43 - blue is one
252:45 - okay
252:46 - so
252:54 - shirt color
253:08 - like this
253:10 - um
253:15 - so back in draw body we have here
253:20 - ctx
253:21 - fill style
253:24 - is shirt color and we also give this ctx
253:28 - fill
253:29 - like this
253:42 - what did i press on my computer
253:54 - okay
254:02 - not okay
254:04 - i pressed something
254:11 - okay uh this fn key somehow
254:16 - right
254:17 - so this is one part here done
254:20 - i'm just going to comment it out a bit
254:23 - and
254:24 - do the same thing on the other side i
254:27 - want these to be somehow
254:31 - separate
254:33 - lines so it looks more organic i'm gonna
254:36 - do
254:37 - a click here
254:40 - this is where i'm gonna begin
254:42 - so
254:46 - and a curve that goes
254:48 - like this okay
254:51 - undo
254:52 - start here a control point here
254:57 - going here
255:01 - then a control point here
255:04 - going here
255:07 - control point here
255:10 - going here
255:15 - control point here
255:20 - going here
255:22 - and the control point here
255:25 - going here or so
255:28 - so let's copy that
255:31 - and um
255:48 - keep these coordinates there
255:52 - and
255:53 - let's do
255:55 - a begin path with the move to
255:59 - starting point
256:00 - and then
256:03 - control point here
256:08 - going there
256:14 - control point
256:17 - and point
256:23 - control point
256:28 - end point
256:33 - control point
256:37 - and point
256:40 - and control point end point
256:49 - okay this is good
256:51 - but now it's using the
256:54 - skin tone
256:56 - which is the last fill style so now we
256:59 - have
257:01 - these things here
257:06 - they look really good i think
257:08 - but um
257:18 - so here we started like that ended like
257:21 - this
257:22 - i think this end should be lower so that
257:24 - it covers this
257:27 - stroke there
257:29 - yeah let's
257:32 - try
257:36 - eight
257:44 - oh no it grows the other way around so
257:47 - point line
257:50 - yeah
257:51 - doesn't seem to work
258:06 - i think this is
258:07 - okayish
258:18 - not okay
258:19 - let's leave it with nine zero and
258:22 - do another bit of a curve there as well
258:25 - so
258:29 - this control point
258:37 - i'm going to put it here and take us
258:40 - back to the starting point
258:44 - like this
258:47 - but i don't want that stroke to be there
258:50 - i think so let's see if i do this
258:53 - i think this is just perfect
258:56 - okay
258:57 - let's put also the body back on
259:01 - for reference
259:04 - okay
259:06 - and now i'm gonna
259:09 - draw the shoulders and that part
259:12 - pretty much
259:16 - copying
259:17 - going over this skin part right there
259:21 - so
259:23 - yeah
259:33 - hmm
259:44 - and i'm gonna also
259:47 - add a few
259:49 - scalings
259:50 - i mean a few
259:52 - translations based on these sliders for
259:56 - the whole body i think that will amplify
259:58 - the
260:00 - the feeling of movement make it look
260:03 - even better let's see
260:05 - but before that let me
260:10 - uh
260:11 - so this is now the
260:13 - this point right here
260:16 - is this one
260:17 - i'm gonna need the new one somewhere
260:20 - maybe here let's just draw this
260:25 - i'm gonna make new points there i'm
260:27 - gonna start with the point here
260:30 - actually this one will be zero
260:33 - and then it will go
260:35 - here
260:38 - and then
260:40 - line to
260:44 - here
260:46 - and
260:48 - control point here
260:53 - line to somewhere there and then
260:57 - i mean curve 2 somewhere there but this
260:59 - will be outside the screen
261:01 - so
261:02 - before we do these with the shirt collar
261:05 - we are going to do something else with
261:08 - the shirt caller
261:11 - so
261:12 - i'm gonna
261:13 - this was a zero actually and this was
261:17 - 1.1
261:18 - or something
261:20 - and
261:21 - we do a move to
261:24 - this center location
261:28 - and um
261:29 - now we do
261:31 - a line
261:32 - to
261:33 - this place
261:37 - and
261:39 - then align to this place
261:42 - and the last one is going to be this
261:44 - quadratic curve
261:46 - too
261:48 - with this control point
261:51 - and
261:53 - the last point there
261:55 - so this should be fine
261:57 - but now we need a line to
262:00 - [Music]
262:02 - the other side so basically this one
262:05 - with the plus
262:11 - and
262:13 - a quadratic curve to
262:17 - this will be same with the plus and
262:19 - going to this coordinate actually
262:24 - also with the plus on the other side
262:27 - and then
262:29 - this one
262:31 - with the plus
262:32 - and back to here or just doing
262:36 - close path
262:38 - and we need a
262:41 - fill and a stroke as well
262:45 - so this is fine i think
262:52 - i'm missing a begin path
262:57 - okay
262:58 - and here i'm just going to
263:00 - tuck these
263:07 - points a little bit
263:20 - i can see a little bit these corners
263:22 - there
263:29 - i think this was fine and such but this
263:31 - one was like that
263:34 - okay
263:35 - so
263:37 - better
263:37 - [Music]
263:40 - this is not great i see a small line
263:42 - there from
263:45 - this last connection
263:48 - uh with the closed path so this needs to
263:50 - be a bit
263:51 - lower i think let's try
263:54 - 86.
263:58 - let's try 87.
264:04 - can we go 88
264:08 - okay
264:09 - good
264:10 - good good
264:12 - but this looks a little bit weird so
264:15 - head moving neck is moving a little bit
264:18 - it's okay
264:19 - but the rest of the body just completely
264:22 - still
264:23 - so i'm gonna
264:25 - do something about that as well
264:28 - um based on that a point
264:31 - so when i'm drawing everything here like
264:35 - the body and the head i'm actually going
264:37 - to do a ctx
264:40 - translate
264:46 - first to save
264:48 - ctx translate
264:53 - a dot offset
264:56 - x
264:57 - or was it x offset
265:01 - and
265:02 - multiplied by
265:04 - 0.04 or something small
265:07 - and
265:08 - y offset
265:10 - also multiplied by that um
265:13 - i don't think i need the y offset let's
265:16 - just put it zero
265:20 - it would look a bit strange
265:23 - so i restored this now
265:28 - so everything moves now a little bit
265:31 - while the person is moving i don't
265:33 - really like it
265:39 - it's not fantastic
265:42 - maybe this value should be very low
265:46 - like that
265:56 - it's not not very great
266:03 - let's uh
266:05 - restore this somehow after the body
266:19 - this looks a bit better
266:21 - and
266:21 - let's actually
266:23 - scale
266:24 - also
266:26 - so that it goes
266:28 - um
266:31 - one minus a dot x offset multiplied by
266:35 - zero point
266:37 - zero five
266:39 - and one
266:45 - so
266:46 - not good
266:48 - it's good in this direction but not good
266:50 - in this direction
266:58 - absolute value might fix it
267:08 - yeah this is okay
267:10 - and maybe even a smaller value here like
267:14 - like that
267:17 - it gives some kind of movement it of
267:20 - course this should be
267:21 - skewed and it should give you a 3d
267:23 - perspective and
267:25 - all these points should be actually
267:27 - somehow
267:30 - computed with a 3d perspective in mind
267:34 - but
267:35 - i don't know how to use
267:38 - the webgl canvas for example and i said
267:43 - i don't use the internet
267:45 - and also
267:47 - i think it's too much trouble and when
267:49 - you try to do things in a 3d environment
267:52 - that are
267:53 - supposed to be 2d
267:59 - they don't look the way i i like them to
268:02 - look
268:03 - if that makes sense
268:08 - so this is just fine i think for for
268:11 - what i'm doing here
268:13 - and um
268:15 - hmm
268:25 - yeah good okay what happens when we move
268:27 - vertically
268:31 - okay let's see if now i have to
268:35 - energy to feel this
268:40 - shape
268:52 - when drawing the head something is
268:55 - off there
269:24 - yeah so i'm drawing the head
269:26 - [Music]
269:30 - i really feel like i want to disable all
269:33 - of these for a while and see what
269:35 - happens with this shape
269:48 - okay yeah we were using those
269:51 - b and c points
269:53 - let's add the
269:55 - a b and c points back in
270:07 - that was a kind of a good idea but
270:10 - somehow i ended up using just a as the
270:14 - point
270:19 - it would have been a better 3d
270:21 - perspective there
270:34 - let's put here
270:36 - ctx global alpha
270:40 - 0.4 and
270:43 - reset it to 1 at the end
270:45 - so what i'm gonna do is i want to see
270:48 - through the head
270:50 - the other shape and see what is the
270:53 - where is the problem coming
270:55 - from
270:56 - so here for example
271:19 - i think the bottom of the beard
271:22 - should go more down
271:26 - and then maybe
271:28 - we do something right here
271:32 - as well
271:33 - so
271:36 - let's go to the beard
271:40 - draw half beard
271:42 - so the bottom most point
271:47 - let's try this one
271:50 - with the three and also vertically here
271:54 - with the 0.3
272:10 - i think that's fine
272:16 - now this right most point
272:27 - so this is something that i want here to
272:29 - have a bit bigger maybe
272:33 - 47
272:36 - like that
272:52 - not really
272:54 - it was fine before
273:12 - so not the right most point but the one
273:17 - so this control point is
273:21 - i think the outside one
273:26 - this quadratic curve to
273:38 - what were these two things
273:46 - so these
273:47 - and that that means this point right
273:49 - here
273:51 - this one
273:52 - end point here
274:00 - no that that this is the start point i
274:03 - forgot it starts right here so
274:06 - it should be
274:09 - 39 or something so i want to move it a
274:11 - bit closer to the eye here
274:14 - like that
274:16 - and now if i do this
274:18 - and that
274:20 - almost good
274:22 - so also this control point right here i
274:25 - think also
274:27 - a lower value maybe
274:30 - 33 there
274:34 - yeah now this looks good
274:38 - [Music]
274:42 - and here
274:44 - this outside part
274:46 - so
274:47 - the
274:48 - control point here
274:50 - the x should be
274:53 - bigger maybe thirty
274:56 - eight or something
275:03 - yeah and the right most point
275:07 - maybe
275:08 - 46.
275:14 - i think this is good
275:16 - and the the hair needs to still connect
275:19 - so we have changed now this point here
275:22 - and also the right most point i'm
275:24 - copying them just for
275:27 - reference and i'm gonna draw go now to
275:30 - draw half
275:34 - hit
275:44 - no hair
275:46 - draw half hair
275:48 - and this one was also starting at
275:53 - it needs to start here
275:55 - and
275:58 - the right most point
276:02 - now this is a 46
276:05 - here
276:06 - so let's see now
276:08 - uh
276:09 - global alpha i want to
276:11 - remove this trick for making things
276:14 - transparent just so i see through
276:16 - them and
276:19 - okay
276:25 - almost there
276:30 - yeah this is fine
276:34 - it's kind of funny
276:37 - okay
276:40 - okay
276:41 - a little bit
276:44 - inwards so um
276:46 - the one control point from draw
276:50 - half
276:52 - beard
276:57 - uh
277:01 - the first one from here
277:03 - should be inwards a bit more so
277:07 - maybe like that
277:13 - maybe even more
277:21 - okay
277:22 - i think this is just good
277:24 - so
277:25 - we have done
277:27 - quite many things
277:28 - still many things to do
277:36 - but i need a brick
277:38 - so
277:39 - i'm gonna take few minutes break and
277:42 - then i come back for another
277:45 - hour or so
277:47 - and then tomorrow
277:49 - more interesting stuff
277:51 - i'm gonna think about this also when i
277:53 - walk to work
277:55 - and
277:57 - usually that's when i do most of the
277:59 - great idea
278:01 - thinking
278:03 - moments
278:06 - yeah
278:09 - okay so the years are still missing
278:12 - actually
278:13 - and i really want to do the hair
278:16 - um
278:17 - so that it's
278:19 - dynamic so when the character moves like
278:23 - moving his his head like this i want the
278:26 - hair to be shaking there i think it
278:29 - would look very nice
278:31 - and
278:34 - and i want the character to talk so this
278:37 - is something that i really want to do
278:40 - tomorrow and i'm not entirely sure how i
278:42 - want to do that
278:45 - i have some videos about this
278:50 - talking pumpkin that i did at some point
278:52 - where i used the microphone
278:55 - to
278:58 - get a different
279:02 - to get the volume and depending on the
279:04 - volume open the mouth more or less
279:07 - i could do that but i think it wouldn't
279:09 - be very
279:12 - organic
279:14 - people open their mouths in so many
279:16 - different ways and the
279:18 - volume is just one number
279:21 - so
279:23 - i i'm thinking about using webcam and my
279:26 - face and doing some kind of detection on
279:28 - the face
279:31 - i really want to do these two features
279:33 - otherwise i think i'm gonna lose this
279:35 - competition because i've spent so much
279:37 - time and i just have a
279:40 - nodding character and
279:42 - he seems to agree with me
279:45 - okay
279:47 - but um
279:48 - i will take a break and uh in a few
279:50 - minutes i continue and try to draw the
279:53 - ears
279:55 - and maybe i begin with the hair in some
279:58 - way
280:00 - something
280:02 - i might i think i should also clean up
280:05 - the code before i end today so that i
280:08 - have it easier tomorrow it's a bit
280:13 - it's not great
280:14 - i i should use some
280:17 - objects maybe or
280:19 - at least separate the code into files so
280:22 - that it's easier to
280:25 - to find the things this already starts
280:27 - to have quite many
280:29 - lines of code
280:34 - yeah
280:35 - okay be back in five minutes
280:40 - okay i'm back
280:42 - so i think one of the things i want to
280:44 - do is the years
280:47 - now
280:48 - and um i'm going to go back
280:51 - to the click event listener here and
280:55 - re-get
280:57 - um
280:59 - coordinates with respect to
281:02 - a
281:03 - so the same way we did for the eyes
281:06 - i'm going to refresh this
281:09 - and
281:11 - yeah so where are the years now they
281:14 - don't align very well here
281:18 - i'm going to try to
281:22 - map the locations where they should be
281:25 - somewhere here
281:27 - so i'm going to say
281:31 - i'm going to click where i think the
281:32 - location should be
281:34 - so one is here
281:37 - with um
281:40 - control point
281:41 - here
281:44 - and
281:45 - another point here
281:48 - and then
281:51 - control point here
281:55 - here
281:57 - another control point here
282:03 - here
282:04 - another control point here
282:07 - here
282:08 - i might need to
282:14 - adjust these a little bit
282:17 - yeah i think it's too complicated shape
282:20 - let's let's make a simpler one
282:22 - so starting here
282:25 - control point here
282:28 - and here
282:30 - and
282:31 - another control point here
282:45 - here
282:50 - let's see how this looks like
282:53 - so
282:54 - we have the draw ahead and
282:59 - draw
283:00 - years with respect to a
283:03 - so function
283:05 - draw
283:06 - years
283:08 - oh and i did everything on the left side
283:11 - again
283:12 - let me do it
283:13 - one more time and on the right
283:34 - okay
283:36 - i think this ended up even better
283:39 - so
283:41 - let's do that
283:43 - and um
283:49 - now we have
283:53 - a save and a translate
283:55 - and it ending with this restore
283:59 - and
284:02 - reference point passed here like that
284:05 - and what we do now is
284:07 - move to
284:09 - this first location
284:13 - and all of them are quadratic curves
284:17 - so i'm going to say
284:21 - quadratic curve to
284:23 - this
284:26 - with this
284:29 - and
284:31 - this
284:35 - to this
284:40 - and finally
284:45 - this
284:47 - to this
284:54 - and ctx
284:57 - fill style
284:59 - equals to skin tone
285:01 - ctx fill
285:04 - ctx stroke
285:09 - um
285:12 - it's something
285:14 - maybe i want this first control point to
285:16 - be more to the right
285:23 - no i i don't maybe i want this end point
285:34 - yeah maybe something like that and then
285:37 - the this control point maybe
285:42 - that looks good
285:45 - i think
285:46 - and
285:51 - close
285:52 - path as well
285:56 - now there is a line here that is thicker
285:59 - i think the starting point can be a
286:01 - little bit to the right
286:04 - so like that
286:11 - maybe also a little bit lower
286:16 - more low
286:19 - yeah why not
286:21 - and um
286:24 - i think now this can be
286:27 - left a little bit
286:29 - i think this looks okay
286:31 - uh the last
286:35 - thing here i think could be
286:37 - lower maybe
286:44 - not that one
287:00 - mm-hmm
287:27 - okay
287:28 - something like that this is just fine
287:32 - so i'm actually gonna
287:36 - copy
287:39 - this draw
287:42 - make it into a
287:51 - yeah some
287:52 - smart things need to happen here because
287:55 - this here on the right
287:58 - should actually disappear
288:04 - at some point
288:06 - yeah this is not very easy
288:09 - it's the first thing that we need to
288:11 - make disappear
288:13 - to make it vanish when the character
288:16 - rotates like that
288:30 - so if we go to the draw
288:33 - eyes for example
288:35 - let's take this as a reference
288:39 - draw
288:40 - years
288:42 - and
288:48 - draw a year
288:51 - like this
288:53 - i think it's pretty much the same as
288:54 - what the eyes are doing maybe a little
288:56 - bit different
288:58 - so i'm gonna
288:59 - make a new function here
289:03 - draw
289:04 - here
289:08 - uh
289:08 - x
289:10 - scale
289:11 - or
289:12 - scale x
289:20 - like this and the draw
289:24 - i
289:25 - is having here these two things
289:34 - i think we will need
289:36 - something similar as well
289:40 - and
289:40 - ctx restore because we are scaling them
289:46 - okay two years there
289:51 - uh this one is quite
289:54 - yeah it is scaling itself now it's
289:56 - better
289:57 - but
289:58 - it should also
290:00 - it should also scale
290:06 - uh
290:08 - i think
290:09 - not just in this case
290:11 - not not just with the maximum
290:14 - i think we just put here
290:19 - x offset let's see
291:06 - yeah it really needs to be
291:12 - more here somehow and i would like it to
291:16 - squish more
291:47 - yeah this is good
291:49 - but um
292:34 - these locations also need to be
292:36 - translated somehow let's do ctx
292:41 - translate
292:46 - scalex
292:51 - no
292:53 - nothing vertically just horizontally
292:56 - and
292:58 - it's way too much so let's do it
293:02 - by a small factor
293:06 - yeah i think this is fine
293:09 - now i'm worried what happens here
293:15 - it's not horrible
293:18 - some squishiness is happening which i
293:20 - don't
293:21 - necessarily like but i think it adds to
293:24 - some personality to the character so
293:28 - it's fine
293:31 - okay
293:32 - and uh drawing the head
293:34 - i think it's just too high up
293:38 - so when it's normal like this i would
293:40 - like it to be a bit lower
293:42 - it's just too
293:44 - too high up i i think
293:46 - so or maybe the body needs to be
293:50 - higher
293:52 - let me do a quick translation for the
293:55 - body
293:56 - to be higher
293:59 - and i think that will fix the problem so
294:12 - here
294:21 - okay maybe a bit too much point
294:26 - six
294:29 - okay
294:35 - yeah a little funny shape here but i
294:37 - really think that when i'm gonna do the
294:40 - um
294:41 - here with the physics hopefully i'm
294:43 - gonna do the hair with the physics then
294:45 - it's gonna be good and
294:47 - the year here
294:53 - i don't know if it really needs to be
294:56 - covered
294:59 - i would definitely cover it but it's not
295:02 - so easy to do that
295:33 - i think also
295:37 - we might do some tricks with the with
295:40 - the hair later
295:41 - to cover it
295:45 - but uh
295:46 - don't have a clear vision there yet my
295:48 - hair now is also a little bit different
295:50 - than in that
295:52 - initial drawing that we are
295:55 - getting inspiration from
295:57 - and it's shaking also to the sides so it
296:00 - goes also here
296:02 - i might need to redesign also the
296:04 - character a little bit
296:06 - maybe these top parts don't need so much
296:08 - attention
296:10 - well let's see
296:13 - yeah i think i'm gonna actually i don't
296:16 - even see my ears anymore
296:19 - because there is hair is covering them
296:21 - so
296:22 - i think that i don't need to worry much
296:24 - about the ears there
296:26 - even if you will see a little bit here
296:28 - because the hair will be covering it
296:33 - it won't
296:34 - be a big deal i think we're fine
296:39 - but now uh i think we are done with this
296:41 - kind of
296:43 - basic
296:45 - character
296:46 - movement
296:48 - and
296:49 - i'm not gonna polish this much more
296:51 - maybe something with the nose if i get
296:53 - some better idea
296:54 - uh to make it look nicer when it's
296:57 - straight
296:58 - watching straight at us like this
297:02 - uh
297:04 - but i'm quite happy with what we have at
297:06 - the moment
297:09 - here these
297:10 - lines look too thin i think that we need
297:13 - to
297:15 - stroke
297:16 - the
297:18 - that part
297:37 - okay
297:50 - this gray here is not
297:52 - needed anymore
297:55 - uh huh
298:02 - so let's put here
298:09 - skin part of the body
298:14 - and this is gonna be
298:20 - um
298:21 - shirt
298:27 - part of the body
298:30 - and now here we have those that color
298:36 - or the neck
298:38 - neck
298:39 - region
298:45 - and the shirt
298:52 - second
298:56 - part like that
298:58 - and
299:02 - so this draw body
299:11 - hmm
299:35 - um yeah the problem is stroke should be
299:38 - after the fill
299:44 - there
299:46 - this one is fixed but this one
299:53 - i don't want that connection there
299:56 - so
300:01 - i think i'm gonna do
300:03 - fill and stroke
300:08 - now this last fill is not good
300:10 - it
300:12 - destroys part of the stroke
300:21 - so
300:22 - this part here is something i don't like
300:25 - now
300:28 - i think i just do
300:31 - begin path
300:46 - yeah begin path
300:50 - that and fill
300:58 - i need the move to before so
301:06 - move to there
301:10 - okay almost i think this control point
301:13 - needs to be
301:14 - lower so
301:18 - like that
301:22 - no
301:48 - oh
301:51 - this is so horrible
301:54 - yeah this shape now is just this part
301:57 - right here
302:02 - i should use a move to a bit higher up
302:06 - so
302:11 - let's leave this as such
302:14 - and this move 2 goes to
302:17 - 89 here
302:21 - that looks good
302:23 - okay
302:24 - finally great uh i will also remove now
302:28 - a b and c again from there
302:31 - and um
302:44 - let's move the draw body function
302:49 - in
302:50 - a new file let's call it body dot js
302:55 - it's not a class but
302:58 - i don't know
303:00 - it will be very useful to keep
303:02 - everything inside the class eventually
303:05 - but now i just want to separate the
303:07 - functions
303:13 - so
303:14 - that one goes in the body
303:17 - and now
303:18 - let's put in the head
303:24 - draw head
303:25 - and all these other things draw ears
303:29 - draw ear draw nose draw hair
303:32 - half hair
303:34 - beard half beard eyes high
303:39 - this one we don't need anymore i'm not
303:41 - gonna worry about this glass i
303:45 - think so let's put this
303:47 - head js
303:51 - okay
303:52 - and let's clean up a bit what we have
303:54 - here
303:55 - so
304:00 - um
304:01 - high speared hair nose ears
304:05 - it's fine
304:07 - and
304:08 - i'm just gonna group these
304:12 - a bit like that
304:14 - i think they're a bit clearer and i like
304:16 - to separate save and restore so that
304:20 - i notice them easily whenever
304:24 - these
304:25 - modifications to the context are are
304:28 - done
304:32 - yeah the to-do for the nose is still
304:34 - here
304:35 - draw hair
304:50 - yeah
304:51 - to me the code is clear
304:55 - but there are many many of these
304:58 - values that are used to define the shape
305:01 - and it's actually not easy and
305:04 - not really needed to come up with names
305:06 - for these things
305:10 - i think it would be possible to export
305:12 - all these values in some kind of json
305:14 - format or something
305:18 - and then load them in
305:21 - but
305:24 - i'm not going to spend time on on that
305:33 - this feel can happen before the restore
305:35 - here i think what was this
305:38 - half beard
305:40 - only the
305:48 - stroke is affected in in width when you
305:51 - do that
305:53 - so we have eyes also
305:59 - so here we have the eyes
306:03 - the main the white part
306:11 - and then
306:13 - the
306:15 - eye brows
306:18 - just one
306:20 - and uh what is this thing oh yeah the
306:23 - let's call it
306:24 - pupil
306:26 - i'm not sure how you write it but
306:28 - it's gonna be like that now i don't have
306:30 - internet
306:33 - and what is this
306:37 - oh yeah that one line
306:39 - this one line here
306:45 - half
306:46 - contour line
306:49 - something like
306:50 - that and
306:53 - let's separate that as well so i is more
306:55 - complicated it needs special comments
306:58 - there
307:01 - the beard
307:02 - doesn't really need special comments
307:05 - because it has some variable names that
307:08 - are
307:10 - self-explanatory
307:11 - and of course you may need to play
307:13 - around with these a little bit to
307:16 - change but i did all the drawing that i
307:19 - want to do and i'm happy with it i don't
307:21 - want to update this anymore
307:24 - so that is the definition of this
307:26 - character pretty much
307:29 - and
307:30 - same goes for the hair i think it's well
307:33 - commented here
307:46 - this scale y is actually not used for
307:50 - the hair apparently
307:53 - so let's remove this
308:01 - so the vertical squish thing is not used
308:04 - anywhere this is just the one here
308:08 - good
308:09 - simpler
308:10 - code this simpler now
308:21 - okay draw body is not defined
308:23 - we need to go to index.html
308:26 - and
308:27 - include these scripts
308:31 - before we write this script right here
308:34 - so let's say
308:37 - script
308:39 - source is equal to body js
308:47 - i think like that
308:50 - and
308:52 - hit
308:53 - js
308:55 - okay things seem to work again
309:00 - this is so funny it looks kind of
309:03 - unnatural
309:06 - it's a very unnatural
309:09 - i stopped liking it now
309:16 - i really think that the hair is going to
309:20 - change a lot of
309:21 - things here
309:23 - i hope
309:26 - i hope it can give a 3d
309:28 - look to it and also the fact that it's
309:31 - going to move it's going to make things
309:39 - better yeah some polishing will be
309:42 - needed
309:43 - we are not done
309:44 - i still have maybe
309:47 - 20 30 minutes
309:50 - maybe even a bit more
309:52 - and um
309:54 - i wanted to do something completely
309:56 - different but let me clean up this a
309:59 - little bit
310:00 - so
310:01 - a little bit more
310:05 - still quite much cold here what do we
310:07 - have this lerp
310:09 - i usually have a utils file
310:15 - let's call it math this time
310:22 - i'm gonna put there the linear
310:25 - interpolation for example
310:28 - and these update points something quite
310:30 - general
310:33 - draw
310:34 - point i think i rename it back to
310:38 - utils
310:40 - and put also these
310:43 - this draw point there so it's not just
310:45 - math but now also some visualizing thing
310:48 - that we use in different places
310:52 - and this is just the helper thing this
310:54 - function will be
310:57 - removed
311:06 - like that
311:53 - like so
312:08 - now live points so these are
312:12 - those things that we have been using but
312:16 - this bees
312:22 - i guess it's
312:23 - used somewhere
312:30 - at least to define that head
312:33 - the colored part the skin colored part
312:36 - of the head
312:58 - okay we'll see tomorrow
313:07 - okay so now this utils let's include
313:11 - utils as well i'm gonna put it first
313:13 - here
313:16 - utils js
313:21 - we keep these points
313:26 - then the animation so
313:28 - this click and the get coordinates
313:31 - actually also the
313:33 - this event listener
313:37 - will need to be removed afterwards
313:41 - so
313:41 - [Music]
313:49 - i mean doesn't need to be removed but it
313:52 - won't
313:53 - do anything it's just printing stuff in
313:55 - the console
313:57 - so
314:07 - yeah
314:08 - animate function will stay and it has
314:10 - draw me
314:11 - and this part will also be removed
314:17 - it's just that background
314:23 - character i think we can actually remove
314:26 - it even now
314:27 - but
314:28 - let's just keep it a bit longer for
314:31 - reference here
314:38 - okay
314:40 - and the draw me function
314:43 - does a little bit of scaling so that the
314:46 - character
314:49 - appears a little bit more
314:54 - to move
314:56 - sideways
314:58 - not really 3d but at least
315:01 - if you're not paying close attention it
315:03 - feels like that
315:05 - and this is not fantastic really but
315:09 - not horrible i think the hair will make
315:11 - a very big difference and the beer beard
315:14 - might be adjusted a little bit after
315:16 - that let's
315:18 - let's see
315:20 - maybe the head could be
315:23 - the body could actually be a little bit
315:27 - higher up
315:33 - also
315:36 - yeah
315:37 - okay
315:49 - this one is
315:50 - the slider so this is called when
316:07 - hmm
316:15 - yeah i had some more some other ideas
316:18 - originally to make it look even a bit
316:20 - more 3d with these
316:23 - other things there
316:24 - but
316:26 - and the abc points
316:30 - they were
316:31 - supposed to
316:34 - do something a little bit more somehow
316:36 - shape the head
316:38 - but
316:39 - it's not horrible okay i still want to
316:42 - do a few more things
316:44 - so let me
316:46 - remove these points again they are
316:48 - disturbing a bit now
316:52 - and i'm actually gonna
316:54 - hide that
316:57 - character on the background this circle
316:59 - here and
317:02 - i might need that code again to compare
317:04 - in the end but for now this is what we
317:07 - are having
317:09 - and uh oh looks like some space here at
317:11 - the bottom let me just make
317:14 - the body
317:15 - be
317:16 - a little bit longer
317:19 - at the bottom
317:20 - here so
317:23 - outside the screen those two points
317:28 - i think it was a bit
317:30 - far enough anyway
317:32 - but this is some
317:34 - side of the canvas that just looks like
317:36 - that
317:38 - okay so what i still want to do now is
317:41 - um
317:42 - add a completely new thing i want to add
317:46 - our my camera my webcam
317:49 - and
317:51 - somehow do basic image processing there
317:54 - and see if i can move this head with
317:58 - the camera instead
318:00 - i think it's a bit too much now it's
318:02 - late but at least i want to start
318:06 - something
318:07 - so
318:10 - let me see
318:12 - i want to do this
318:18 - here
318:24 - let's just make a new file called this
318:26 - camera js
318:29 - and include it here
318:33 - camera js and here i'm gonna write
318:37 - navigator
318:39 - media device is
318:42 - get
318:43 - user media
318:47 - and i'm going to get
318:51 - the video but i think that i'm going to
318:53 - also use the audio later
319:02 - i think in the end i will want to
319:03 - support uploading a video and then it
319:05 - just the character is going to move
319:08 - according to that video somehow let's
319:10 - see
319:11 - so
319:12 - but for now just the video here i think
319:15 - is just fine so we get the user media
319:18 - and this returns a promise so
319:20 - we do then
319:22 - uh we use the data so we have the
319:27 - data coming
319:29 - from the promise when the promise
319:31 - succeeds
319:33 - and uh
319:34 - i'm gonna define
319:36 - a video
319:38 - object um
319:40 - i don't add it to the
319:42 - dom but
319:46 - element a video
319:48 - element
319:49 - and
319:50 - then i'm going to set this to the data
319:52 - that comes from the device so
319:56 - source
319:59 - i think it's source
320:01 - object
320:03 - is the data
320:05 - and we are going to play this video so
320:09 - if i'm going to change this from the
320:11 - camera to the
320:13 - to some video
320:15 - this is where i want sound to also
320:19 - display later
320:24 - i will remember i don't need to do that
320:26 - so then when this is loaded it's like
320:30 - on loaded
320:31 - data
320:32 - we get a new function new callback
320:35 - function
320:36 - and
320:37 - here
320:39 - i
320:40 - can start to
320:43 - do something
320:44 - with this video like start the
320:46 - processing and so on
320:48 - so
320:51 - we might also have an error
320:54 - if
320:56 - when you do this
320:58 - it's going to ask you on the screen if
321:00 - you allow or not
321:02 - to
321:07 - to give the camera so this might give an
321:09 - error and we can catch that error like
321:12 - that
321:14 - uh
321:15 - i just make an alert here and say
321:18 - no
321:23 - camera
321:26 - failed
321:27 - something like that
321:29 - okay
321:33 - why is this highlighted like that so we
321:36 - have this
321:42 - i'm not using the error anywhere
321:49 - was it so that in javascript catch is
321:51 - not like this but it's a callback
321:53 - function
322:12 - okay
322:15 - and now i have to close this one
322:45 - i need to close this
322:48 - catch somewhere
322:51 - this is a function i have the alert
322:56 - closing the function and then i have to
322:58 - close this catch
323:25 - you
324:12 - i just don't know what the problem is
324:14 - let's um
324:16 - run this
324:18 - and
324:21 - look in the console
325:00 - what is that
325:04 - oh
325:04 - this then
325:07 - no no no no
325:10 - no this is then
325:12 - this then has to be closed
325:17 - before
325:18 - before the catch
325:20 - it's then and then it's a catch yes
325:28 - okay it
325:29 - allows the camera and then
325:40 - could not start video
325:42 - source i think this is the error message
325:45 - from here
325:46 - it could be that i'm using the webcam
325:48 - here and
325:52 - that webcam
325:55 - doesn't let me use
326:01 - yeah
326:02 - uh
326:04 - let's see if i can make the web
326:06 - the browser
326:11 - have a different webcam
326:13 - i have a webcam in my
326:16 - laptop
326:17 - here as well in the front
326:24 - okay
326:29 - so
326:30 - i did something
326:37 - maybe
326:46 - refresh
326:52 - okay
326:53 - something worked i think it's using my
326:55 - front camera
326:59 - let's try to display this
327:03 - camera on some other kind of canvas
327:07 - i'm going to put another small canvas
327:10 - under these sliders there so i'm going
327:12 - to say
327:15 - canvas
327:16 - id
327:18 - cam canvas
327:22 - and i'm going to
327:27 - get the reference to this one as well
327:31 - somewhere here in the camera code
327:36 - and i will say
327:40 - camera canvas
327:44 - um
327:48 - i think i make this one as big as the
327:50 - video is going to be it's going to
327:52 - simplify things a bit and let's put here
327:57 - it
328:06 - i can scale it with css later
328:09 - and
328:16 - let's try drawing the image so
328:20 - i need
328:21 - i need a context for this one as well
328:35 - okay
328:37 - and i'm gonna draw the image
328:40 - of the video
328:50 - at zero zero
328:52 - so
328:53 - i don't need the width and height
328:55 - because the canvas has the same height
328:56 - as the
328:58 - video
328:59 - so let's remove this log
329:02 - and
329:05 - try
329:06 - to refresh
329:12 - okay
329:13 - but this is very large now
329:16 - so
329:17 - with css i'm going to say
329:30 - um
329:34 - max with
329:38 - okay
329:42 - i think this is just fine for debugging
329:45 - and fits in my screen
329:48 - quite
329:49 - nicely
329:50 - i think
329:51 - so
329:53 - this is the other camera from the front
329:55 - and that's just one snapshot because we
329:57 - are not animating these
329:59 - cameras in any way so i'm going to copy
330:02 - this style from here
330:04 - and i'm going to add it for
330:08 - cam
330:08 - canvas
330:11 - like this
330:12 - so when i refresh now
330:21 - okay
330:23 - now the room here is not fantastic with
330:26 - the lighting and everything
330:29 - i might change the room tomorrow
330:32 - i think i'm going to use a better
330:34 - room
330:36 - and um
330:48 - let's try to begin to do something with
330:50 - the camera here so i just hope i
330:55 - i
330:56 - at least get it to animate
330:58 - so
331:00 - here i'm going to call
331:04 - wait i already have an animate function
331:07 - here
331:10 - okay
331:13 - so what i need to do here is
331:20 - take this video out
331:24 - with let
331:29 - like this
331:31 - and
331:32 - i'm going to
331:47 - go back here and say
331:50 - okay this cam canvas also needs to be
331:55 - up here
331:57 - and
331:58 - camera
332:00 - context
332:04 - okay so camera context
332:13 - camera context draw image to video
332:19 - and then draw me on the other canvas
332:22 - so now the video should animate
332:25 - if i
332:26 - save this and refresh
332:33 - what is happening
333:23 - okay it works it was
333:26 - it did an error here because the video
333:29 - was null
333:30 - and it never got to request animation
333:32 - frames so animation didn't start and
333:36 - yeah
333:37 - even after i pressed that allow button
333:40 - for the webcam okay
333:42 - now
333:43 - if we have the video then do that
333:46 - and
333:53 - i really want to get somehow the
333:58 - locations
334:02 - of the
334:04 - of some pixels there so i always use
334:06 - these kind of markers i don't have a
334:08 - blue marker here
334:15 - tomorrow i need something blue
334:18 - and
334:21 - yeah
334:26 - spider-man is blue
334:30 - let's try with spider-man
334:33 - so
334:34 - let's write the function
334:36 - for
334:38 - a utility function for
334:42 - get
334:43 - marked locations so we're gonna look for
334:46 - the color blue
334:48 - so a color of zero red
334:51 - zero green
334:53 - maximum blue and we're gonna use a
334:55 - threshold
334:56 - like this
334:58 - and i'm going to get the
335:01 - data
335:04 - from the context i need here
335:08 - um
335:09 - the image data as well
335:12 - so
335:14 - here
335:16 - i'm drawing it on the context so then i
335:19 - want the image data
335:26 - camera context
335:28 - get image
335:29 - data
335:32 - from zero zero to
335:37 - cam
335:38 - canvas
335:40 - width
335:41 - cam canvas
335:43 - height
335:45 - like this
335:48 - and then
335:53 - this image data has a data attribute
336:02 - i just pass it completely to that utils
336:05 - function so
336:09 - the marked locations are going to come
336:11 - from get marked locations
336:14 - using the image data
336:18 - and the color and the threshold but i'm
336:20 - gonna keep those values
336:23 - inside of here
336:24 - i might put the color picker or
336:27 - something let's
336:29 - let's see later what happens
336:33 - but
336:37 - yeah get marked locations from the image
336:39 - data and let's console
336:43 - log
336:45 - logs length like this so the number of
336:48 - items in this array
336:50 - so now in the utils
336:53 - i need image data here also
336:57 - and
336:58 - let's just
337:03 - console log image data
337:06 - data
337:08 - length
337:09 - see how big this array is
337:12 - i remember
337:13 - this kind of thing quite well
337:18 - an error
337:23 - okay this is not returning anything
337:33 - yeah so here we have
337:43 - 0 is
337:44 - this empty array and this is the size of
337:47 - image data
337:49 - so
337:50 - these are values
337:52 - are this image data data
338:02 - is having
338:04 - i mean this data now is having this many
338:06 - numbers and it's the width times the
338:08 - height
338:14 - times 4 because each value for each
338:16 - pixel is the red green blue and alpha
338:19 - components
338:20 - so i'm going to loop
338:29 - through every four
338:32 - groups of four and i'm gonna say
338:35 - red is going to be data of i
338:40 - green is data of i plus one
338:46 - blue is data of i plus two and alpha
338:49 - would be data of i plus 3 but we don't
338:52 - need that so now i have a rgb value
338:57 - for this pixel
339:00 - now if this rgb value is
339:03 - a match
339:06 - our gb is a match to our
339:10 - caller that we are given this blue color
339:13 - there
339:14 - so
339:16 - match
339:18 - between these
339:20 - colors and
339:23 - under the threshold
339:25 - let's say the threshold is going to be
339:27 - something like
339:29 - 50.
339:30 - then this is gonna
339:34 - add something to this locations array so
339:38 - i'm gonna say here
339:40 - an empty array to begin with
339:44 - and uh
339:47 - the locations is gonna push
339:51 - an x
339:53 - um
339:55 - an x and a y
339:57 - so the x and the y we need to calculate
339:59 - them x is going to be
340:02 - i think the floor
340:04 - of
340:07 - the index of the pixel
340:10 - so the index of the pixel is i divided
340:13 - by four
340:14 - because we're going in groups of four
340:16 - and then the x is going to be
340:32 - p
340:34 - index
340:35 - divided by
340:37 - image data
340:39 - width
340:41 - and y is going to be
340:45 - the modulo i teach this all the time in
340:48 - my videos like all the marker effects
340:51 - have this this thing there i'm just
340:54 - trying to do it mentally and i hope that
340:56 - i don't mess up
340:59 - index modulo
341:02 - data
341:03 - with
341:04 - and these values are going to go now to
341:07 - our locations array
341:10 - and which we return here
341:12 - so we need two more things we need this
341:15 - match function
341:18 - match color one color two
341:21 - and this is just going to end the
341:23 - threshold
341:24 - and this is just going to say
341:27 - if the distance between color 1 and 2 in
341:29 - the 3d space
341:31 - is less than the threshold then it's a
341:33 - match so
341:34 - return
341:36 - distance c1 c2
341:39 - less or equal to this threshold
341:42 - and here we say function
341:46 - distance
341:48 - and this is going to be
341:52 - distance between two points p1 and p2 in
341:55 - 3d space
341:57 - um
342:01 - euclidean distance
342:34 - like that
342:39 - no
342:41 - like that
342:43 - okay and now return
342:47 - square root
342:49 - of this distance
342:51 - so
342:52 - this should be the distance
342:54 - in 3d space
342:56 - any space really because we have here a
342:59 - for loop
343:00 - like that
343:01 - so now what we are going to do
343:05 - is
343:14 - test
343:17 - i think
343:19 - i don't know i'm getting tired
343:22 - let's refresh
343:28 - so it's a zero there but if i bring this
343:31 - cup here
343:33 - it's still zero
343:36 - i think that these uh
343:38 - blues
343:41 - i need to go
343:43 - soon
343:44 - maybe five more minutes i tried to
343:46 - detect some blue color here
343:49 - um
343:52 - i think the
343:54 - value
343:55 - of the threshold could be bigger
344:12 - i think something doesn't work so
344:24 - let me put a
344:30 - break point here
344:32 - and go inside of this
344:38 - function
345:04 - okay
345:19 - things look good so i don't know why it
345:21 - doesn't work
345:23 - a bigger threshold is not a great idea
345:25 - because we are approaching too much
345:28 - the values of
345:31 - other colors
345:33 - oh okay
345:37 - well something blue there but i'm gonna
345:40 - go tomorrow in another room oh i have a
345:42 - pen here
345:45 - okay
345:50 - so something works i think
345:55 - these colors are detected
345:57 - let's see
346:01 - 10 more minutes i want to do something
346:03 - with all these let's average the
346:06 - locations
346:15 - so
346:16 - these are going to be x y locations
346:19 - the values from here
346:22 - so i'm going to say
346:28 - average is equal to x of 0 y of 0
346:33 - and
346:34 - for
346:44 - average x
346:49 - like this
346:57 - and i need to divide this by the number
346:59 - of locations
347:08 - both x and y
347:10 - so when i do this now and i return
347:18 - this
347:22 - oh i'm not calling this anywhere
347:25 - so back in index.js where we have here
347:29 - the locations i'm also going to get
347:33 - the
347:35 - average
347:37 - location like this
347:39 - and that's going to be
347:42 - what i'm going to log next
347:46 - so we have not a number there
347:49 - because
347:50 - the locations is empty
348:05 - oh yeah and then it's dividing this
348:08 - i don't want not a number there
348:13 - so here if we do have locations
348:23 - if we have locations then i'm going to
348:26 - do that
348:28 - otherwise
348:31 - i just don't
348:33 - so now what i want to do
348:35 - is use this location of this marker here
348:39 - to connect it to these sliders there
348:56 - so this info value of the slider and
349:00 - this attribute was x and y right so if i
349:04 - just
349:04 - send update points
349:15 - if i just send update points with
349:18 - something that has a value
349:23 - between
349:26 - minus 0.5 and plus 0.5
349:32 - so
349:32 - if i go here and say
349:36 - value is going to be
349:38 - average dot x minus
349:48 - image data width
349:52 - divided by 2
349:56 - and
349:58 - divided by
350:05 - image data width so this is going to
350:07 - give me a value
350:13 - for x
350:18 - so now what this will mean is
350:24 - how far is the marker from the center
350:26 - screen
350:28 - you will see
350:29 - and i did the same thing for the y as
350:32 - well
350:34 - so let's put here
350:37 - y like this
350:39 - and
350:41 - average y
350:43 - image data height
350:47 - like this
350:49 - and let's now instead of that value
350:52 - log
350:54 - x and y from here
351:02 - so
351:03 - now this is close to zero
351:06 - and this one there
351:11 - still zero on x but the y is big and now
351:15 - the y is
351:18 - negative
351:22 - okay i think i'm
351:24 - making some mistakes here
351:48 - is this average calculated correctly
352:03 - let's go back here and
352:05 - print what we had previously
352:16 - i didn't really look at those numbers
352:18 - before
352:19 - so
352:43 - they are flipped
352:46 - x and y are flipped
352:49 - yes
352:50 - this is why this is x
352:53 - okay and here
352:56 - now
352:58 - the new x and y values after scaling
353:01 - them
353:08 - yes so here x is close to minus 0.5
353:13 - x is
353:14 - plus 0.5
353:16 - y is plus 0.5
353:20 - y is minus 0.5
353:22 - and
353:24 - now that we have this x and y value here
353:27 - i'm just going to call
353:29 - update
353:30 - points
353:32 - with something that has a value
353:37 - of x
353:39 - and
353:40 - x so
353:42 - here update points was waiting for this
353:44 - attribute of x and y
353:47 - and the same thing with
353:49 - y
353:51 - and y there
354:00 - okay
354:07 - i like it
354:09 - uh this recognizing this blue color
354:13 - needs a bigger threshold maybe or
354:25 - not great but uh
354:29 - testing like this is sure is easier now
354:33 - and uh
354:34 - if i'm gonna put this on my
354:36 - in my head or something tomorrow then
354:41 - yeah
354:43 - i think i can make this
354:47 - somehow
354:48 - uh move with my head if i put some kind
354:51 - of markers on the face
354:53 - so i'm gonna
354:55 - do something like that tomorrow
354:57 - and i'm gonna think about it while i'm
355:01 - walking home
355:02 - i'm back
355:04 - and
355:06 - i would really want to get this
355:08 - character talking as well somehow
355:10 - depending on what i do with with my
355:13 - mouth
355:14 - so
355:15 - maybe i will have many markers on the
355:18 - face or something let's see
355:20 - but
355:22 - this is somehow quite nice already
355:26 - i'm happy with this
355:28 - um
355:31 - not perfect
355:32 - and some things feel a little bit
355:35 - strange
355:36 - but
355:44 - let's see how the hair will adjust and
355:49 - how the hair will fix some of the things
355:51 - and so on
355:54 - yeah
355:55 - okay
355:56 - see you tomorrow
355:59 - it's the next day now and i'm walking to
356:01 - work and
356:03 - i've been thinking what will happen
356:05 - today and
356:07 - it's going to be a very different day
356:09 - because yesterday i had no idea what's
356:12 - going to happen we didn't even know what
356:13 - project we're going to start
356:15 - but now
356:17 - i'm going to begin with
356:19 - some more code refactoring i'm going to
356:21 - change everything to be
356:24 - as object-oriented as possible because
356:26 - now functions are floating everywhere
356:28 - and if you want to import this in your
356:30 - own project it's
356:31 - it's a chance that something is gonna
356:34 - conflict with something else so
356:37 - not good
356:39 - and
356:40 - doing this refactoring stage in the
356:42 - beginning is also great because i'm not
356:44 - going to remember all the things that
356:46 - i've been doing yesterday
356:49 - then next thing what i'm going to do is
356:51 - implement some physics i'm going to use
356:54 - this verlai integration technique
356:56 - because i've used it so many times and i
356:59 - think i remember it
357:01 - and what i'm gonna do with that is
357:04 - eventually do the hair
357:06 - but uh
357:08 - that
357:09 - image of myself that i drew a long time
357:11 - ago initially had things like this
357:14 - around the around the neck and that's
357:17 - what i'm gonna apply the physics on
357:19 - first uh kind of like a simple pendulum
357:22 - and then i'm gonna move to the hair
357:23 - which is gonna be a bit more
357:26 - a bit more difficult
357:28 - but anyway uh physics for that so i will
357:31 - start with some kind of
357:34 - utility functions for
357:36 - doing linear algebra i'm gonna need some
357:38 - help for that and
357:40 - then
357:41 - a little bit of physics
357:44 - and
357:45 - last i'm gonna
357:47 - do
357:48 - some basic
357:50 - image processing and this is going to
357:52 - happen so that
357:55 - i'm going to have markers on my face
357:59 - so there will be
358:01 - markers
358:02 - on the face area they're going to be
358:05 - around the mouth somehow so that it can
358:09 - change the drawing based on how i'm
358:11 - opening my mouth i hope that's going to
358:13 - work i'm going to also use some
358:15 - reference point here so that the head
358:17 - movement like this is going to be picked
358:19 - up
358:22 - i didn't have any
358:25 - great markers at home so i took with me
358:28 - a double-sided tape
358:31 - which should hold on to things i hope
358:34 - it's gonna hold on to
358:36 - my face especially because i have the
358:38 - beard
358:40 - and um
358:41 - [Music]
358:44 - it's white so i also took one of the
358:46 - blue markers that i've used in many of
358:48 - the videos
358:50 - to color
358:51 - color them i really hope the detection
358:53 - is gonna be good i'm going now to a
358:55 - different room so the lighting there is
358:57 - better
358:58 - and i don't think i'm gonna have a big
359:01 - problem with that but detecting the
359:03 - all those points and figuring out what
359:05 - the face should do it's probably gonna
359:07 - be a challenge let's see
359:09 - [Applause]
359:11 - so
359:12 - the physics is something that i'm gonna
359:14 - start with and then this face detection
359:17 - thing i also have scissors because i'm
359:19 - gonna need to cut that tape somehow
359:22 - good that i don't forget things like
359:23 - that
359:27 - yeah so physics and then that
359:29 - uh
359:30 - face detection thing
359:33 - according to the markers
359:40 - and i'm gonna do those immediately when
359:42 - i arrive because i want to be as fresh
359:45 - as possible for the heavy stuff
359:47 - and then whatever fine tuning i can
359:49 - still
359:50 - manage
359:52 - will happen afterwards
359:55 - so maybe something like that knows that
359:57 - i don't like how it looks like i have
360:00 - some ideas
360:01 - about it maybe using transparency on
360:05 - that line and making some new lines
360:06 - appear as the face is moving we'll
360:09 - we'll see
360:10 - but yeah so
360:12 - uh
360:12 - heavy things at first
360:14 - and uh at some point i'm gonna need a
360:16 - way to toggle between
360:21 - between using
360:23 - the sliders as the input because i want
360:26 - to have users able to somehow play
360:28 - around with the avatar
360:31 - even if they don't have a webcam
360:34 - and the webcam and then the third thing
360:37 - that i want to do is
360:39 - record uh a small video of me saying
360:42 - something like hi i am produce avatar
360:45 - and maybe test a few movements uh
360:48 - talking and moving the head
360:51 - so that one will be the default when you
360:53 - enter the page um a video playing
360:56 - of myself with the markers
360:59 - and um
361:01 - the
361:02 - avatar is going to hopefully do the
361:05 - things that i'm doing at the same time
361:07 - and from that you can change to the
361:09 - webcam but you need some kind of way to
361:11 - mark the face
361:13 - like that
361:14 - and um
361:17 - if not then you can change to some
361:20 - um
361:22 - to just use the sliders there so maybe
361:24 - i'm gonna use a drop down simple drop
361:27 - down for that or um
361:30 - radio box
361:31 - is
361:33 - or something
361:34 - anyway
361:35 - that's the plan so
361:38 - refactoring oop
361:41 - um
361:42 - physics
361:43 - [Applause]
361:45 - face detection
361:48 - i mean face pose detection using the
361:50 - markers
361:52 - and
361:55 - uh a better interface and the video for
361:58 - that
361:59 - so hopefully the first two happen before
362:01 - my
362:03 - lunch break
362:04 - i also have another meeting
362:07 - and then the other two happen afterwards
362:10 - and uh
362:12 - yeah
362:12 - i'm gonna have about
362:19 - six more hours to put into this i think
362:22 - so let's see
362:30 - okay i'm in a new room now and the
362:34 - lighting is much better here
362:36 - so now when i use the marker which i
362:40 - took from home
362:42 - it's going to be
362:44 - detected much better than
362:46 - yesterday when i tried to do this so now
362:49 - i can move the character
362:51 - with this blue
362:53 - blue marker here in the screen so i will
362:56 - probably have something like this on my
362:58 - on my head and adjust this
363:01 - somehow and i really want to do
363:03 - something with the mouth as well so
363:06 - let's see later but first
363:11 - a little bit of refactoring and i'm
363:13 - going to make this character here
363:17 - using object-oriented programming
363:20 - so
363:21 - let me go
363:22 - to
363:23 - index html
363:26 - and
363:27 - what i want to do here
363:31 - instead of draw me i'm going to say
363:33 - something like
363:35 - uh
363:37 - avatar
363:40 - draw
363:41 - on
363:43 - on the context
363:44 - so i'm going to give the context here as
363:47 - a as an argument
363:49 - and this avatar is going to be an avatar
363:52 - object so i'm going to define this in an
363:54 - avatar
363:56 - js
363:57 - file
363:59 - class
364:00 - avatar
364:01 - like this
364:03 - and
364:05 - i will give it the constructor
364:08 - and the draw method
364:13 - so now um
364:15 - the code in this draw me is going to
364:18 - move
364:21 - inside of the avatar's draw method
364:26 - and
364:33 - context goes here
364:36 - in case you want to use multiple avatars
364:38 - multiple canvases something like that
364:42 - right and this draw me is not
364:45 - needed anymore but we need to define
364:47 - this avatar so we are going to say
364:58 - avatar
365:00 - new avatar
365:02 - here
365:04 - as a global
365:06 - variable
365:14 - good
365:14 - and
365:18 - draw body and draw head these are going
365:21 - to change to be
365:23 - methods inside of the avatar and they
365:25 - will be private methods so i'm going to
365:28 - say this dot
365:31 - hashtag draw body and same for this draw
365:34 - head
365:35 - so let's do the body first it's going to
365:37 - be
365:38 - this function from here i remove it
365:43 - and
365:47 - i put it here
365:49 - as a method the drawbody method and the
365:53 - ctx should be passed here as well so
365:56 - that the body knows where to draw itself
365:58 - so it begins the path
366:01 - um this a point is a global
366:04 - variable and that's something i don't
366:06 - like
366:08 - we are going to need to pass this
366:12 - down to
366:14 - the avatar so it knows where it should
366:17 - be looking at
366:18 - so a actually stands for that point that
366:22 - avatar was was directing its
366:25 - head at
366:30 - let's see the other code for the draw
366:32 - head and i'm going to
366:39 - have to copy everything from here
366:42 - this whole file
366:43 - goes also in the avatar class
366:46 - and
366:47 - it needs to become
366:49 - methods
366:50 - as well
366:53 - so these functions will also be
366:56 - converted into methods into private
366:58 - methods actually and they will need
367:00 - access to this context so i need to pass
367:02 - it down so
367:06 - private methods because it's its own
367:09 - responsibility the avatar knows how to
367:12 - draw itself
367:13 - and these points are going to somehow
367:17 - be important because they are coming
367:19 - from outside they are coming from
367:22 - the code that processes the camera here
367:25 - or they are coming from sliders here
367:27 - which currently i don't think work
367:30 - or
367:30 - oh they do work
367:32 - uh if there is no blue in the screen
367:35 - uh
367:36 - then
367:37 - they seem to work which is quite nice
367:40 - so i'm gonna have also some kind of
367:42 - toggling between how to move this
367:45 - character around
367:47 - so um
367:49 - b and c are really not much used i think
368:25 - yeah they are just used for the colored
368:28 - shape
368:30 - of the head
368:31 - colored with the skin color
368:33 - i wanted to have different ideas for
368:36 - that i wanted to
368:38 - somehow
368:40 - use more this interpolation
368:44 - and
368:44 - these ranges here but when i saw that
368:47 - it's becoming somehow tricky to do and i
368:50 - added there some negative range
368:53 - to make something work with c i realized
368:56 - that it's somehow
368:57 - uh
368:58 - becoming too confusing so i did
369:00 - everything relative to point a and the
369:02 - other ones i think we may not even need
369:05 - them let's let's see
369:07 - but let me finish this code now so
369:12 - uh
369:13 - draw years
369:15 - all of these things here they need to
369:17 - become
369:18 - method calls
369:20 - and private methods there's no real
369:23 - reason for the outside
369:27 - coders from the outside this class to be
369:29 - able to call this
369:32 - method
369:34 - and
369:36 - same here with the draw year
369:39 - now and
369:42 - all of these that are
369:45 - taking a here they need also the context
369:48 - now so let's
369:50 - pass already the context there
369:53 - in addition to this reference point
369:59 - to all of these things
370:02 - so context will be will be needed there
370:28 - right
370:30 - and um
370:34 - method
370:35 - here
370:41 - looks good
370:43 - so
370:44 - let's go down to this
370:49 - drawn nose
370:51 - and make this one as a method as well
370:56 - our to do is there
371:00 - if time at the end i will do those fine
371:03 - tunings
371:04 - the draw here it's going to be draw half
371:07 - here
371:08 - like that and
371:10 - these
371:11 - need the ctx as well
371:15 - now
371:26 - and here
371:34 - yeah looks good
371:36 - drawbeard
371:38 - also private method this time
371:41 - so doing the code like this means that
371:43 - we are
371:46 - we can include this avatar class and we
371:49 - don't have to worry if somebody else has
371:50 - a function called draw half beard
371:52 - somewhere
371:54 - so very useful
371:56 - um
371:59 - in separating the code and making it
372:02 - um
372:06 - not interfere with with other things
372:10 - draw half beard
372:17 - and i'm also relearning what i did
372:19 - yesterday so that i don't
372:24 - so that i know where i'm at pretty much
372:41 - okay
372:42 - so only problem now i think
372:47 - i don't need anymore this body js and
372:50 - this
372:52 - head js let me delete these
373:02 - like so
373:08 - and
373:08 - in index html i'm going to have to
373:13 - include avatar js instead
373:17 - and i think it should still be able to
373:19 - access the global points from here but
373:21 - i'm gonna do something about that let's
373:23 - refresh
373:25 - errors
374:30 - for some reason it complains about this
374:32 - context there
374:38 - let's put the breakpoint and
374:46 - undefined
374:49 - inside of this
374:52 - draw year
375:03 - oh i forgot here to pass
375:06 - ctx
375:24 - okay good
375:34 - yeah so
375:35 - much better
375:38 - i think
375:42 - but these points are something i don't
375:44 - really like very much so
375:49 - first of all i'm really curious can we
375:51 - do without them
375:56 - somehow let's activate these points
375:59 - again to be able to
376:03 - to see them
376:05 - where they are
376:07 - and do they really move that much or
376:09 - could we do them relative to a in some
376:12 - way
376:14 - so c is actually
376:34 - i think b doesn't move
376:36 - almost at all
376:38 - so maybe i could replace b
376:41 - i could maybe remove b in the beginning
376:44 - and just try replacing it with these
376:46 - values this value here
376:50 - let's see
376:51 - i just delete it from there
376:55 - and
376:56 - from here
376:58 - and inside of this avatar
377:00 - uh we use be
377:04 - here
377:06 - so how about we just put
377:09 - 0 and minus 0.77
377:12 - does this still look good
377:30 - b is not
377:32 - defined oh draw point b i don't want to
377:36 - draw that point
377:49 - okay here there is a problem
377:54 - here there is no problem
377:56 - so how about we just make it a little
377:58 - bit lower
378:00 - like um
378:16 - like this
378:35 - we don't need b anymore great
378:37 - and c is
378:40 - looks very much like that the bottom
378:42 - point of the
378:44 - beard
378:46 - it was relative to a
378:49 - let's see so when we draw the head and
378:52 - we draw the beard here
378:56 - we have the draw half beard
378:59 - and
379:02 - bottom most point so this point
379:07 - quite complicated it comes also from
379:09 - this vertical scaler i think
379:11 - but not impossible to figure out so
379:15 - let me copy this here
379:17 - and
379:18 - when we have the vertical scaler so this
379:21 - means
379:22 - um
379:26 - this one right here
379:28 - so the bottom most point is actually
379:32 - this
379:37 - something like that
379:39 - and this is
379:41 - c pretty pretty much so let me just have
379:44 - here
379:45 - uh
379:47 - b
379:49 - and c
379:50 - like that so they are not global anymore
379:52 - they are going to be just these local
379:55 - ones and i
379:57 - put here
379:59 - be like that
380:01 - so
380:03 - i remember what they are but
380:06 - they are not so important that they
380:08 - deserve drawing in the first place and
380:10 - definitely they don't deserve to be
380:12 - global variables a is an exception
380:15 - because it's going to be controlled by
380:16 - the sliders and this marker
380:19 - so c here is going to be
380:22 - okay
380:24 - b dot x
380:25 - b dot
380:27 - y so i'm going to use this everywhere so
380:30 - that i don't have the same
380:32 - hard coded values repeating themselves
380:34 - the others are important to be like that
380:36 - because they define the shapes
380:40 - and here c is going to be
380:45 - no comma there
380:48 - i think like that and
380:54 - i believe this is correct
381:00 - i'm going to
381:05 - stop drawing c
381:08 - and
381:09 - in the beginning
381:11 - i just have a there now
381:19 - whoa something happened
381:31 - oh
381:50 - oh
381:52 - ref is
381:53 - actually a
381:55 - in that case so
381:57 - c is defined according to the a
382:01 - y offset
382:04 - okay something bad is happening there
382:56 - haha it was first translating to ref
383:01 - yes so um
383:03 - we without translation i just first i
383:06 - just have to add the
383:08 - a coordinates there
383:11 - so
383:15 - a dot x
383:18 - a dot y
383:19 - plus this one
383:33 - okay not exactly sure why it's happening
383:37 - like that but it's almost correctly it's
383:39 - almost correct so it needs to be
383:48 - hmm
384:07 - so in the draw beard
384:21 - we translate today and then we draw half
384:24 - beard
384:28 - oh it's doing some scaling there oh so
384:32 - complicated
384:37 - yeah this scaling is also there
384:41 - complicated complicated stuff
385:08 - and
385:09 - [Music]
385:14 - scale y is just the y offset
385:21 - so
385:22 - a dot y offset
385:33 - like that
385:36 - one minus that
385:40 - okay
385:42 - i think that
385:48 - this needs to be multiplied by
385:55 - this
386:04 - no
386:06 - maybe
386:07 - divided by that
386:16 - no
386:17 - um
386:18 - [Music]
386:20 - i think everything here needs to be
386:24 - multiplied by that
386:30 - yes
386:32 - okay so now we don't need those things
386:34 - anymore and just that a point is
386:36 - controlling the head
386:38 - and
386:39 - i would also like to clean up
386:43 - even this a bit more
386:45 - um
386:52 - i mean
386:53 - this avatar class here is quite
386:59 - big now
387:02 - so maybe i would like to
387:04 - extract these
387:15 - methods somehow
387:20 - let's try to export extract the eyes
387:29 - draw eyes
387:33 - let's see if we can say
387:39 - this
387:49 - right eye
387:53 - draw
387:54 - and then
387:56 - give these
387:58 - things there
388:00 - like so
388:10 - and
388:12 - same for the left eye so i'm gonna
388:14 - define an eye object
388:27 - i don't think i need two of them
388:38 - and
388:39 - it can be a private
388:43 - attribute here
388:45 - okay so let's now here in the top say
388:54 - this i is new i
389:04 - class
389:05 - i
389:08 - and draw the draw method
389:14 - it's gonna be
389:15 - [Music]
389:16 - this one from here
389:23 - so it's gonna have a scale and the
389:26 - context on which to draw it
389:30 - and
389:37 - i think that's pretty much it
389:42 - empty constructor here
389:45 - so
389:48 - if i refresh now
389:54 - i get some errors
390:59 - is there something wrong with the
391:00 - private attribute
391:17 - okay i'm not sure what's wrong with that
391:20 - but
391:21 - let's just leave it public it's not the
391:23 - big deal there
391:26 - okay so
391:28 - the eyes
391:34 - don't work properly
391:49 - what happened here did i do some
391:52 - bad thing
391:58 - oh there was a minus
392:01 - did i
392:02 - lose this minus at some point
392:15 - yes now it looks good
392:17 - so with the i like that i'm going to
392:23 - take it out i'm going to put it in i.js
392:34 - like this
392:40 - and
392:53 - i could do the same for others but i
392:55 - think i'm spending too much time for
392:59 - refactoring
393:02 - let's go to index.js and
393:06 - import
393:08 - i js as well
393:11 - so
393:12 - now everything works
393:14 - as before but the code is better it has
393:17 - the eye here in its own class
393:20 - so
393:22 - next there would be this
393:24 - beard
393:26 - with the draw half beard
393:34 - so i think i'm gonna try to do it
393:37 - let's
393:38 - go where the draw beard is and say
393:42 - this
393:43 - beard
393:44 - draw
393:47 - using a and the context
393:52 - so
393:53 - at the top here
393:56 - this beard
393:58 - is new beard
394:04 - beard js
394:07 - i'm just going to copy i
394:10 - class and say here beard
394:13 - and
394:19 - i don't need this draw beard anymore
394:24 - draw beard is going to go inside of the
394:32 - beard
394:34 - object
394:36 - and
394:37 - it's going to become the draw method
394:41 - like this
394:44 - and draw half beard is still going to be
394:46 - a private method here inside i think
394:49 - there's no way around that
394:53 - we need it here
394:56 - so that's good
394:57 - and here in the alpha tar
395:00 - nothing else needed i just need to
395:02 - import
395:04 - beard
395:06 - like this
395:08 - so code is better
395:10 - much better
395:15 - now
395:16 - next thing uh
395:19 - i think nose doesn't necessarily need
395:21 - its own class it's small enough
395:24 - year is small enough i think
395:28 - here
395:29 - this will be needed
395:33 - because
395:37 - because i'm going to make it very
395:38 - complicated soon
395:42 - so here js and here i'm going to take
395:46 - out draw hair and draw half hair
395:49 - and it's already kind of complicated it
395:52 - says
395:57 - it's as complicated as the beard so i'm
396:00 - gonna take these
396:01 - methods out from here
396:03 - and put them here
396:06 - let's copy the beard
396:09 - code
396:11 - and
396:12 - just replace with this one
396:15 - probably
396:16 - i wasted more time copying that but
396:20 - somehow
396:22 - and the draw here in the same way
396:28 - yes no problems with that
396:31 - so the beard also will need to be
396:34 - defined somewhere
396:57 - i mean
396:59 - hair did i say beard
397:15 - okay
397:32 - right
397:33 - so
397:35 - avatar js has
397:39 - not so many lines anymore
397:43 - has the body drawing and then this is a
397:46 - debug thing
397:48 - that um
397:52 - maybe i'm going to actually make it like
397:53 - that
397:54 - if i want to debug then i'm going to
397:56 - show these points
397:59 - i may have multiple ones
398:01 - later and in index here i can have a
398:06 - debug
398:08 - true
398:09 - so now if this is true then the points
398:12 - are showing if this is false then the
398:15 - points are not showing
398:17 - so i don't need to comment out things
398:19 - all the time
398:20 - and here
398:22 - [Music]
398:24 - this a point is something that i need to
398:32 - fix
398:33 - it doesn't mean anything i'm
398:43 - i don't think i'm gonna need anything
398:45 - else just a point where it's looking at
398:49 - so let's just call it
398:54 - look at and i will make a comment here
398:58 - point a
399:00 - when we debug so this look at is
399:05 - a point
399:16 - like this
399:17 - and
399:20 - this a here
399:24 - won't be needed anymore so i'm gonna
399:26 - remove it and we will just
399:31 - use
399:32 - look at
399:33 - everywhere
399:35 - and when we define the avatar
399:40 - i'm going to give it this
399:42 - look at
399:44 - point as a reference
399:48 - so
399:49 - now
399:59 - here
400:08 - this is going to be a so where is it
400:11 - looking at
400:13 - every time we have a capital a so i'm
400:15 - gonna look for it matching the case and
400:18 - there's a full word
400:20 - every time we have this kind of capital
400:23 - a i'm gonna replace it with this dot
400:27 - look at
400:34 - that one can stay like that
400:37 - it's the label and drawing the point
400:40 - with our
400:41 - utility function
400:52 - okay
400:53 - saving
400:55 - and here
400:56 - we have that update
400:58 - points function
401:00 - so this was the thing that
401:03 - moves with the slider so
401:06 - update
401:07 - look at
401:15 - update look at
401:19 - update look at
401:21 - and
401:22 - i don't need the for loop here anymore i
401:24 - just have
401:26 - p equals to
401:28 - look at
401:30 - so
401:33 - right
401:39 - refresh
401:40 - allow
401:54 - no
401:55 - error when the
401:57 - camera because i still have update
401:59 - points here so update look at the value
402:02 - of x and the value of y
402:11 - yes okay finally
402:13 - finally code is now
402:16 - as clean as i'm going to get it in this
402:18 - project it's
402:21 - not all about the code quality i think
402:24 - code quality is very important and i
402:26 - don't want to give some bad
402:29 - bad
402:30 - example to anybody
402:36 - everything can always be improved but
402:39 - you need to stop somewhere also in real
402:42 - work
402:46 - okay
402:47 - done
402:48 - it's
402:49 - much better now at least
402:57 - yes
402:58 - so uh next what we are gonna do is
403:03 - physics
403:05 - so let's let's do the physics next and
403:08 - i'm going to
403:10 - go quite quickly
403:13 - through these things i've i've done them
403:16 - multiple times and i have an idea how
403:18 - they're gonna go
403:22 - yeah
403:24 - so let's have a
403:26 - file
403:28 - physics js and in index.js
403:32 - include this one as well
403:38 - okay
403:40 - and
403:41 - i'm actually going to start with adding
403:43 - some more utility functions so
403:46 - there will be some math functions
403:53 - that work with the
403:54 - vectors because i make mistakes if i
403:57 - don't use vectors when i'm doing the
404:00 - physics it's just so much easier when
404:02 - you work with
404:04 - x and y combined or i usually like
404:07 - vectors to be
404:08 - using arrays so i have the array of 0
404:11 - and array of 1. it's very useful because
404:14 - then i can use for example
404:16 - this function here that works with
404:20 - arrays
404:21 - this could have also been with that so
404:23 - now i have a mess of
404:25 - points and also these kind of 3d points
404:28 - are different they don't have xyz but
404:33 - yeah it's a little
404:36 - bit i should refactor this so here the
404:40 - location
404:41 - i prefer to use arrays everywhere so
404:43 - instead of an object with x and y it's
404:46 - going to be
404:47 - a vector with
404:51 - zero zero here
405:19 - yes
405:25 - it's just much better when the code is
405:27 - more
405:28 - is consistent everywhere and because we
405:30 - are using 3d here also for the color
405:32 - space
405:33 - it makes sense to
405:35 - have it like this these functions become
405:38 - more general
405:43 - yeah
405:45 - so we have the average and we are using
405:47 - this average somewhere in
405:50 - index
405:53 - i think
405:54 - no in camera
405:59 - no not in camera where is the average
406:01 - being used
406:02 - it it is an index
406:04 - some oh i have these things on
406:08 - um
406:10 - yes so here
406:13 - average of zero and average of
406:16 - one
406:19 - and um
406:23 - i don't
406:24 - think i need this logging anymore and
406:26 - this
406:27 - comment from here
406:30 - let's
406:31 - try again
406:38 - yeah good everything still works
406:41 - so where was i
406:44 - utility functions for more more vector
406:49 - operations
406:50 - so i just they are simple they are just
406:54 - for
406:55 - vector addition so for example you have
406:58 - two vectors here like that and
407:01 - you can implement this by just
407:04 - considering 2d vectors but i really like
407:06 - to go and
407:09 - say
407:10 - um
407:13 - the new vector like the result
407:15 - is like that and
407:18 - go through all the elements so it would
407:20 - work in any dimensions
407:22 - like this
407:36 - like so and return this new vector
407:41 - like this so this is for adding vectors
407:44 - now
407:45 - subtracting vectors
407:50 - we also need things like
407:52 - magnitude of a vector so
407:55 - essentially the
407:58 - length of a vector
408:02 - or just one vector here so i'm going to
408:05 - say
408:06 - this magnitude
408:13 - this is the same thing as the distance
408:17 - from zero
408:23 - so i think that i can actually reuse
408:25 - that function here and say
408:27 - return
408:32 - distance
408:34 - of
408:36 - v
408:37 - and an array of zeros
408:40 - so
408:43 - new array of the size of
408:47 - the
408:47 - [Music]
408:49 - filled with zeros i think is the syntax
408:52 - i hope
408:53 - this will work so the magnitude is
408:57 - how far from zero this is pretty much
409:00 - and
409:01 - we can reuse that function there
409:04 - and also very important function
409:07 - is to be able to normalize
409:10 - so you just get
409:11 - essentially a vector with a length of
409:13 - one
409:14 - any kind of input vector you just get
409:17 - output something with the length of one
409:19 - but it keeps the orientation
409:25 - or scaling
409:26 - to
409:28 - scale is also important so scale let's
409:32 - let's actually do this
409:37 - scaling first and then we do the
409:39 - normalization so when you scale
409:42 - something you need the vector but the
409:44 - other one is going to be a scalar of
409:46 - a simple number
409:48 - and i'm going to do this by going
409:54 - through
409:55 - these elements and each element
410:02 - multiplied by the scalar like this
410:05 - and now normalizing
410:10 - is just
410:11 - a return
410:14 - scale of the v with 1 divided by the
410:17 - magnitude of v so you divide it by its
410:21 - length and you end up with the value of
410:23 - 1 for the new magnitude
410:26 - so simple relatively simple things i i
410:29 - think and they are now
410:32 - more
410:33 - vector utility
410:37 - functions
410:39 - i can separate these a little bit
410:46 - so this is now general drawing here
410:51 - let's call these
410:56 - vector map
410:59 - and
411:00 - this is something to do
411:08 - with and that
411:11 - let's move linear interpolation here as
411:14 - well it's
411:15 - quite related i think
411:18 - and
411:19 - the last one was
411:25 - just drawing things general very general
411:27 - things so now our utility functions are
411:31 - more of them we have more utility
411:33 - functions now and the the physics that i
411:36 - want to implement are going to be
411:40 - do i have some error
411:44 - here
411:48 - i don't think so
411:50 - okay
411:51 - oh there is some error somewhere
411:56 - here
412:08 - i copied that
412:10 - so it's everywhere
412:15 - okay nothing broke
412:17 - i just added new code so in the physics
412:21 - everything will be based on
412:24 - it will be based on particles so this
412:26 - verla integration method i want to
412:29 - implement
412:30 - works well with particles and then with
412:33 - some constraints like
412:35 - sticks between the particles
412:37 - so
412:39 - class particle
412:43 - then
412:44 - here i'm going to put it at some
412:46 - location so
412:49 - each particle will be initialized
412:51 - somewhere let's say
412:53 - location like this
412:58 - and
413:01 - store it
413:06 - and when particles move it's useful to
413:08 - keep also the old location in memory it
413:11 - will be useful in the mathematics so i'm
413:14 - just going to initialize this with the
413:16 - same location in the beginning so the
413:18 - particle doesn't move from some past
413:21 - last
413:23 - place
413:24 - and
413:25 - we need to be able to draw this
413:29 - so i'm just gonna do simple things like
413:33 - begin path and then
413:38 - let's make these red
413:44 - so they stand out and we easily
413:46 - recognize them
413:48 - or actually orange i think it's better
413:51 - red than green like the green shirt
413:53 - color is sometimes confusing to people
413:57 - so
413:59 - uh
414:02 - let's
414:03 - just
414:04 - make a small circle there at the
414:07 - location
414:10 - since these are going to be vectors
414:13 - i can say here location of 0 and
414:16 - location of 1 or i can just
414:19 - spread the location object like this
414:22 - and give it the radius
414:24 - say
414:25 - 0.1
414:36 - and um
414:40 - the arc method works like that so
414:44 - i need to specify there
414:46 - the full circle and
414:48 - these need to
414:50 - update
414:51 - according to some kind of forces so
414:54 - usually we have some gravity
415:01 - i don't want to leave these as global
415:04 - variables here but
415:12 - let's see later
415:14 - so
415:15 - just some value for the gravity there
415:18 - and this would actually need to be a
415:20 - vector
415:21 - and since we're in 2d space i'm going to
415:23 - say
415:24 - 0 horizontally and 0 vertically like
415:28 - that and the update
415:32 - so what i'm going to do now is pretty
415:35 - much first figure out if the location if
415:37 - the particle is moving
415:39 - from its old location somehow so i'm
415:41 - going to get a
415:44 - velocity vector
415:46 - by doing a
415:48 - subtraction from this location to this
415:53 - old location
415:55 - like that and i can predict the new
415:57 - location
416:00 - to by adding
416:02 - to this location
416:05 - the velocity vector that we just
416:08 - calculated so where it came from where
416:10 - it's now
416:11 - you get that difference the vector
416:14 - connecting them and you add it to the
416:16 - current location to get the new one but
416:18 - you're not done yet because then you can
416:21 - still add this gravity for example so
416:25 - this actually needs to change
416:29 - and we say new location is equal to add
416:34 - to new location we add the gravity
416:37 - vector
416:39 - and
416:40 - we also have to update now
416:45 - old location to be equal to this
416:48 - location
416:50 - like that so we don't lose it and now we
416:52 - can update this location to
416:55 - new
416:58 - location that we calculated previously
417:00 - so i use the extra variable there so
417:03 - that
417:04 - i can still keep the previous one and i
417:07 - don't change it
417:09 - instantly there
417:12 - okay
417:13 - so with this kind of particle here and
417:17 - an update and then draw method i'm going
417:19 - to go to the avatar
417:23 - and uh
417:25 - here i'm going to
417:28 - just try adding a particle where it's
417:31 - looking at
417:34 - yeah
417:36 - so
417:38 - let's see
417:40 - this
417:41 - part
417:43 - particle new particle
417:46 - at
417:48 - look at
417:52 - this is with x y because it's in pixels
417:56 - so i'm gonna say
417:59 - this
418:00 - look at
418:06 - x and this look at
418:10 - why i'm converting it into an array here
418:13 - and
418:15 - i don't think i need to give it anything
418:17 - else and now here in the draw method i'm
418:20 - going to
418:21 - [Music]
418:22 - say this particle
418:25 - draw on the context like so
418:28 - so if i refresh
418:31 - i get errors
418:39 - okay
418:46 - oh wow
418:49 - i think this location might be a kind of
418:52 - a
418:54 - reserved word
419:15 - and this is uh
419:21 - or maybe not let's
419:23 - i think i'm missing this there
419:32 - yes i think now it should work let's see
419:36 - okay
419:37 - so
419:38 - we see now this particle
419:40 - um
419:44 - initialized where
419:47 - a where that look at point
419:50 - is in the beginning but it's not a
419:52 - reference to it i'm
419:55 - taking its x and y initially when it's
419:57 - initialized and then
420:00 - it stays there the particle
420:02 - um
420:03 - i think i'm gonna make the particle look
420:06 - a little bit different so
420:08 - let me go here and say
420:11 - i will make it red so i will make it a
420:14 - smaller radius
420:17 - 3 and
420:21 - stroke
420:22 - it will be red
420:24 - but i'm also going to
420:25 - [Music]
420:27 - make a stroke to it that is going to be
420:33 - white
420:34 - so that
420:36 - you can see it
420:38 - better
420:49 - okay i think this is good
420:51 - so that's the particle but it's not
420:53 - falling i said it should fall with the
420:56 - gravity but we are never calling this
420:58 - update function so
421:01 - here
421:06 - let's call this particle
421:10 - update first and see what happens
421:15 - something happens it's not there anymore
421:19 - i think it might have moved very quickly
421:24 - because
421:26 - this
421:28 - scene is in such a small
421:38 - or i don't know
421:58 - what is happening there
422:01 - this number is becoming huge all of a
422:03 - sudden
422:18 - and this becomes infinity so what what
422:20 - gives
422:23 - let me debug this velocity vector here
423:08 - something strange is happening no matter
423:10 - what the gravity is
423:17 - these numbers become big and small i
423:20 - mean
423:21 - negatively big let me go to the utils
423:23 - maybe i made some mistakes here with the
423:25 - vectors so
423:39 - oh subtract this minus
423:44 - probably this is it let's
423:46 - save
423:48 - okay and now the point
423:50 - is falling
423:51 - and it's actually accelerating
423:54 - it's falling faster and faster and
423:56 - faster and that's great
423:58 - so i would like to
424:01 - do a couple of things here
424:04 - [Music]
424:06 - and i will start with this
424:10 - let me show you the picture
424:13 - we had previously there like that so
424:17 - these things here are missing right now
424:19 - and they actually
424:21 - used to be
424:23 - um
424:25 - in my original drawing they used to be
424:28 - something hanging from there
424:30 - so i would like to make those
424:32 - move a little bit as the character is
424:35 - moving
424:36 - so
424:37 - um
424:38 - when he moves left to right like this i
424:40 - want it to fee
424:42 - to move a little bit like a pendulum
424:45 - so i'm going to put one particle here
424:47 - and one particle here i'm going to make
424:49 - this one up the one up static and the
424:52 - one at the bottom
424:55 - it will be constrained to be at the
424:57 - fixed distance from the top one
425:00 - so
425:01 - let's first define these particles and
425:03 - um
425:07 - actually uh i'm just going to define
425:11 - another one
425:14 - beneath this one
425:16 - so
425:17 - let's add a function here
425:29 - i will refactor this at some point
425:32 - but
425:33 - update particles and this is now going
425:36 - to
425:40 - let's put draw particles as well it's
425:43 - it's nicer like that and here we have
425:46 - particles
425:47 - is equal to
425:49 - an array so the first item in this array
425:52 - is going to be
425:53 - one particle at that look at
425:56 - and
425:56 - the other item in this array is going to
425:59 - be another particle that is somewhere
426:02 - below that so
426:03 - in the beginning
426:05 - i just do something easy like this
426:08 - so below the first particle and now what
426:11 - i'm going to do here is for
426:15 - this particles
426:16 - for each
426:19 - particle i'm going to loop through all
426:22 - of them and say
426:25 - update these particles and then i'm
426:28 - going to say
426:30 - draw
426:31 - these particles
426:34 - on the context so
426:36 - here this method will need that
426:39 - and
426:40 - i'm going to say here this
426:42 - update
426:43 - particles and
426:45 - this draw particles
426:50 - like this
426:51 - so this should now
426:53 - let's go back to our
426:55 - code this should now show two particles
426:57 - that are just falling like that but the
426:59 - first one i want it to be static so i
427:03 - think i wanted to
427:05 - fix it somehow to
427:09 - i will add the third parameter let's
427:11 - call it true and i'm going to
427:16 - fix it to
427:23 - is fixed so i
427:25 - i won't allow it to move
427:30 - like this
427:31 - and in the update
427:36 - none of this needs to happen if it's
427:37 - fixed so if is
427:40 - this is fixed
427:43 - return
427:44 - i think this is fine and i don't need to
427:46 - log the velocity anymore that was just
427:48 - for debugging there
427:50 - so now
427:56 - what happened
427:58 - where is one particle
428:01 - um
428:06 - no i don't think this is
428:08 - this is not the problem
428:24 - what happened
428:26 - so back in the avatar i have
428:29 - oh i'm passing here
428:34 - inside the array and i think it had
428:36 - consequences
428:38 - okay so back here
428:41 - if it's fixed i don't have to update
428:45 - so this one is fixed there
428:48 - right
428:52 - okay
428:53 - so that one is fixed but the other one
428:55 - is not so what we need to do now is uh
428:59 - constrain the other particle
429:01 - to
429:02 - uh
429:03 - the first one so for that i'm gonna
429:05 - implement here a segment class
429:10 - that will have a fixed length and this
429:12 - segment will be between two particles so
429:15 - i'm just gonna
429:17 - say here a constructor for
429:19 - a and b
429:21 - and
429:23 - i will say here
429:26 - okay
429:29 - i don't want to confuse a and b with the
429:31 - way i'm talking about those a b points
429:33 - from previously i think it's it's clear
429:36 - enough
429:38 - i'm going to save a here and say
429:44 - now let's just say
429:45 - particle a
429:49 - particle b
430:01 - okay and let's calculate the distance
430:03 - between these two particles so i'm going
430:06 - to say a length for this segment
430:09 - is equal to the distance between
430:12 - particle a
430:15 - location
430:17 - and particle b
430:19 - location like this
430:21 - and
430:23 - i think that's all i need to know about
430:25 - this segment it's initial length when
430:27 - it's defined
430:29 - and then to draw this segment i'm going
430:31 - to use a context and i'm just going to
430:35 - do
430:36 - this
430:38 - a simple line i think i'm going to do a
430:40 - red line just
430:42 - to debug for now
430:44 - so
430:45 - ctx
430:46 - begin path
430:48 - ctx
430:50 - stroke style
430:52 - red
430:54 - ctx move to
430:56 - this particle
430:58 - a location
431:02 - and here i can
431:04 - spread these into two values because the
431:06 - move two needs two values
431:08 - and line two particle b location
431:14 - like this
431:24 - i have a message
431:36 - okay
431:37 - oh wait there was another
431:51 - right
431:51 - so
431:52 - um
431:53 - stroke
431:58 - like this and
432:00 - the segment
432:03 - needs to be created also somewhere so
432:06 - here let's say
432:08 - this segment
432:10 - i pre i prepare it to be an
432:13 - array already
432:14 - is a new segment
432:17 - with
432:20 - particles of 0 and this dot particles of
432:26 - one so the ones we defined previously
432:30 - like this
432:33 - and uh i also i'm also gonna need
432:37 - update segments
432:42 - but all of these are the same all of
432:44 - these have update and draw update and
432:47 - draw
432:48 - so
432:49 - maybe it shouldn't be update particles
432:51 - and update
432:53 - and draw particles but
432:57 - update
432:58 - and draw
433:01 - we already have a draw
433:03 - update
433:04 - items and
433:10 - physics item
433:13 - and draw physics item
433:20 - and this is going to be a parameter so
433:24 - items
433:30 - and the context there so here
433:34 - i'm gonna have to change these
433:38 - like so
433:41 - i i'm gonna reuse this same code to
433:45 - handle the segments and the particles so
433:48 - here update physics items
433:52 - and
433:53 - draw physics items
433:56 - first i'm going to give this
433:58 - particles
434:00 - and then i'm gonna give this particles
434:03 - here
434:04 - but after we do that
434:08 - i'm gonna give this segments
434:16 - this segments
434:18 - and
434:18 - i don't have yet the update for the
434:20 - segments yet so let me comment it out
434:23 - and just see if this code still works
434:49 - um
434:50 - not in an array here
434:52 - these are just two arguments
434:57 - okay so now you can see also the red
434:59 - line but this is not a segment i mean it
435:02 - is a segment that is changing length but
435:04 - uh
435:05 - it should be like a stick so our update
435:08 - method here inside of the
435:11 - segment class it needs to
435:14 - constrain it to the initial length when
435:17 - it was defined so i'm going to say here
435:20 - update
435:24 - and let's just see
435:27 - what the new length is first so
435:34 - it's going to be we subtract
435:38 - from
435:39 - this particle a location
435:43 - to this
435:45 - particle b
435:48 - location so this is
435:50 - the difference between
435:52 - a and b and currently
435:55 - and i'm gonna need the magnitude of this
435:57 - so how
435:59 - i mean
436:00 - so far we we actually
436:03 - have the vector difference
436:13 - yeah and the magnitude of this is going
436:16 - to be
436:18 - magnitude of
436:22 - like this
436:23 - and
436:25 - we need the difference between the two
436:27 - magnitudes so how much do we need to
436:31 - relocate the particles so that they are
436:33 - still close to
436:35 - as close as in the beginning here so the
436:37 - difference between this magnitude and
436:39 - this initial length
436:41 - so
436:44 - is going to be magnitude minus this
436:47 - length like this
436:49 - and
436:53 - i'm also going to need
436:58 - it's going to be easier if i also get
437:00 - the normalized vector between these two
437:03 - because then i can scale that
437:06 - in both directions and
437:09 - and fix the segment if it gets too long
437:11 - or too
437:12 - too short
437:13 - so i'm gonna do here
437:17 - the normalizing
437:19 - vector
437:20 - normalized vector by normalizing this
437:25 - d vector so now the length is going to
437:28 - be 1 after this but it's not going to be
437:32 - losing its orientation
437:36 - okay
437:37 - so now what we can do
437:42 - is um
437:56 - move a and b
437:59 - locations of a and b
438:09 - with this difference with half this
438:11 - difference
438:13 - in each direction so
438:16 - this particle a location is going to be
438:21 - let's add so let's add to the current
438:24 - this particle a location
438:29 - we can scale the normalized vector from
438:33 - above
438:34 - with
438:36 - minus the difference
438:38 - by two so i'm moving um
438:43 - one point by half
438:44 - and i have to think about also these
438:46 - fixed points later the ones that
438:49 - don't move but let's just do this now
438:52 - and hope it works
438:53 - and the same thing for b
438:55 - but
438:56 - plus here so one goes if the segment is
439:00 - longer than it should be
439:01 - this point goes half the difference that
439:04 - way and this goes half the difference
439:06 - that way if it's shorter then it goes
439:09 - half the difference have the difference
439:11 - opposite direction so something like
439:13 - that
439:14 - great
439:16 - i hope
439:18 - i really think this is going to break
439:22 - refresh it's not broken but it's not
439:25 - doing oh i'm not
439:27 - calling this
439:28 - here because we didn't have an update
439:30 - method previously
439:35 - normalizing is not defined
439:40 - i think it's called normalize
439:45 - i was just talking what i'm doing
439:48 - okay
439:49 - and now this point is
439:54 - there
439:55 - interesting that this other one doesn't
439:59 - oh it does move
440:01 - it
440:02 - if you look closely you can see this one
440:04 - is actually falling very very slowly
440:07 - and that's because
440:10 - this one is pulling on it so it's going
440:12 - down a little bit and then this segment
440:14 - stretches and then both of these points
440:17 - adjust because
440:19 - here we have
440:21 - we are moving each of them even if point
440:24 - a
440:25 - should be fixed actually
440:28 - so i'm gonna need to
440:30 - take care of this somehow so this code
440:33 - is fine if the points are not fixed so
440:36 - if for example
440:37 - this particle a
440:40 - is fixed
440:42 - if it's not fixed and
440:48 - this particle b
440:50 - is not fixed
440:52 - then this is just fine code here
440:59 - but otherwise
441:07 - if
441:11 - a is not fixed
441:20 - then a is going to move
441:23 - twice that difference so it's going to
441:25 - do all the work so to
441:28 - speak else
441:31 - it means b is the one that is not fixed
441:37 - i don't need this if statement i think
441:39 - so
441:46 - what happens if both are fixed
441:49 - so if these are not fixed if a is not
441:52 - fixed
441:53 - if b is not fixed
441:57 - let's just be careful here and
442:00 - if b is not fixed then b is gonna move
442:04 - with both of them
442:07 - i mean uh with double the
442:10 - um
442:13 - yeah
442:16 - but uh
442:19 - if both of them are fixed
442:23 - then nothing should happen i think this
442:25 - is this should work
442:27 - i hope
442:28 - so if i refresh now
442:32 - i think this point doesn't move anymore
442:35 - but so far
442:36 - there's nothing fancy happening here so
442:39 - what i want to do now is
442:42 - fix this point to something maybe i'm
442:44 - going to fix it to the
442:47 - a location so
442:58 - let's say here this particles of zero so
443:02 - this point from there is gonna be
443:05 - this dot
443:07 - look at at each time we are drawing
443:11 - um
443:13 - actually i need to do to look at x and
443:16 - this look at
443:18 - y
443:19 - converting to an array from this point
443:21 - of pixel point object
443:29 - now
443:30 - it's breaking
443:32 - the
443:33 - location
443:35 - of the particle
443:36 - zero has to be like that
443:39 - okay and now
443:48 - this gravity is
443:50 - is too weak
443:53 - i
443:55 - i want it to be stronger so
443:59 - physics gravity
444:09 - okay
444:10 - so now when it's moving
444:12 - um
444:16 - that segment uh always constrains the
444:19 - bottom particle the particle wants to go
444:22 - down then when you move to the side it
444:24 - wants to stay there its original
444:27 - position but then that segment is going
444:30 - to pull it
444:31 - somehow so now i'm i'm getting
444:35 - pretty much exactly what i want but
444:37 - that's not where we're gonna put this so
444:41 - yeah i
444:43 - let's let me try to swing it like a
444:46 - like a swing
444:48 - like give it
444:53 - momentum when i should give it momentum
444:56 - and
444:58 - this is fun okay it's going more and
445:01 - more
445:02 - okay
445:03 - um
445:04 - i want this to be somewhere here
445:09 - attached to the
445:11 - body
445:12 - so that's gonna be
445:15 - this is gonna happen in the draw body
445:19 - thing
445:27 - yeah and then we are gonna use these
445:30 - same things for the hair as well
445:33 - so
445:33 - [Music]
445:36 - let's go back here and actually
445:39 - i would like to have in the avatar
445:42 - a body as well
445:44 - this all the because men much code is
445:48 - going to be their new body
445:51 - and
445:52 - hope this is not a re reserved word
445:57 - so
445:58 - bode.js and let's include it here as
446:02 - well
446:09 - like this
446:11 - and then both djs
446:14 - might be a reserved word but let's see
446:17 - so
446:18 - uh
446:19 - draw body
446:25 - is gonna be just a method in class
446:29 - body
446:38 - that is called
446:39 - draw like this
446:46 - and the shirt color
446:51 - let's actually pass it here
447:00 - uh
447:01 - i also need the skin tone
447:07 - so we don't use global variables at this
447:09 - stage
447:15 - okay
447:16 - shirt color and skin tone
447:29 - okay so this is now body and inside of
447:33 - avatar
447:35 - i
447:48 - all the
447:51 - draw
447:53 - on the context
448:40 - okay
448:41 - look at
448:42 - needs to be passed here as well
448:49 - because the
448:52 - body is also adjusting a little bit with
448:54 - that
449:05 - so
449:07 - draw
449:08 - with this
449:12 - this look at
449:17 - okay why is it red
449:20 - oh i'm not passing the colors here
449:25 - when creating the body i should use
449:34 - shirt color
449:36 - skin tone
449:39 - these should be also passed here in the
449:42 - avatar when creating the avatar
449:45 - to avoid
449:53 - issues
449:55 - great okay
449:56 - it works
449:58 - so
449:59 - now i really want to
450:02 - add these particles
450:03 - not in the avatar
450:08 - but in the
450:11 - body
450:13 - and
450:15 - i think this is just
450:17 - fine to copy here
450:22 - but the code here for
450:26 - updating the physics items drawing the
450:29 - physics items
450:34 - and these things here
450:36 - this needs to be extracted in the
450:38 - physics
450:40 - file here so i'm going to make a class
450:45 - physics
450:47 - and i think i'm going to use static
450:49 - variables so static functions so i'm
450:52 - going to
450:58 - write here
450:59 - physics
451:02 - update physics items
451:05 - draw physics items probably this draw
451:08 - should be
451:09 - not in physics but in some
451:12 - drawer or whatever
451:15 - but this is just fine
451:17 - and
451:20 - these go out from there
451:27 - to here with static because we don't
451:30 - initialize this object
451:32 - and i think this is where the gravity
451:35 - goes as well
451:37 - so
451:38 - static
451:40 - gravity there
451:42 - and
451:42 - the particle takes it from physics
451:49 - it's better like this
451:53 - a little better it's not perfect but
451:56 - i didn't really know what i'm gonna do
451:58 - with this
452:00 - so let's
452:03 - remove this and
452:05 - inside of the body
452:08 - after we do all the other drawings i'm
452:10 - gonna put here
452:13 - this code
452:16 - yeah
452:18 - save this refresh and an error
452:29 - okay the
452:30 - look at is
452:32 - no longer with this here i'm passing it
452:36 - like that
452:51 - hmm
453:05 - i'm just gonna put zero zero for now
453:16 - zero plus zero three i don't need the
453:19 - look at
453:21 - in that way at least so
453:28 - let's just
453:29 - have it zero zero
454:17 - mm-hmm
454:37 - um
454:58 - why aren't they appearing
455:15 - um
455:32 - why is it not appearing there
455:35 - it should appear right
456:17 - i know
456:22 - this location is not good
456:29 - it's under the head
456:32 - it was under the head
456:36 - oh boy
456:38 - yeah
456:40 - okay
456:41 - so
456:50 - so it's drawing it there
456:54 - but i really want to use this look at
456:57 - point somehow so
457:03 - let's first move it to
457:06 - location there so it was
457:09 - where was it
457:14 - somewhere here
457:17 - so
457:18 - let me put it actually somewhere
457:22 - lower
457:23 - so
457:24 - let's put
457:25 - 93 here
457:33 - i think this is
457:40 - let's see if we can use these values
457:42 - because i don't remember what
457:44 - here
457:50 - yes
457:51 - no
457:52 - it's not exactly
457:58 - a bit higher up let's say seventy
458:02 - five
458:06 - 71
458:09 - like this and
458:12 - now it's
458:13 - it's there but it's not affected by the
458:16 - physics because the drawings that are
458:18 - happening here
458:20 - are
458:23 - not
458:34 - i don't like
458:37 - uh
458:38 - not here
458:39 - we go with these back
458:42 - in the avatar and draw them on top of
458:44 - that otherwise this is just a squishing
458:48 - squishing effect there
458:50 - so let's go to avatar and
458:54 - put them back here
458:56 - and the it's okay that we did this in
458:58 - the body it's no problem it's very good
459:03 - but i want this to be at the higher
459:06 - level
459:08 - so here in the draw
459:10 - i'm going to say
459:12 - that
459:15 - okay
459:16 - and
459:18 - now
459:21 - this location should be even higher i
459:24 - think
459:25 - 65.
459:29 - okay it's almost good 64.
459:40 - yes 64. and this is the center point so
459:45 - now um
459:49 - i need to figure out how much this point
459:52 - should move left and right according to
459:54 - these
459:55 - translations and these scalings here
459:59 - so
460:00 - only the x location changes so
460:04 - i call this a string now i'm gonna call
460:07 - this thing string
460:11 - so let's say
460:13 - string x is going to be equal to
460:19 - i mean
460:21 - let's
460:22 - call it string location and the x is
460:25 - going to be equal to
460:27 - this value
460:29 - and
460:31 - y is going to be equal to this value
460:33 - but
460:35 - we need to
460:42 - we need to
460:51 - modify so first what we do is we
460:55 - translate
460:57 - this by that so that just means
461:00 - plus that value
461:03 - and then when we are at the location
461:09 - i'm going to scale with this
461:15 - let's say
461:16 - x translate
461:21 - this
461:32 - and this
461:39 - like so
461:40 - and uh here plus
461:44 - x translate
461:49 - times this x scale
461:51 - it should be fine and i'm not repeating
461:54 - the variables there anymore i really
461:56 - hope i didn't mess something up
462:04 - okay
462:08 - it's doing it
462:10 - it's it's doing it i don't want this to
462:13 - be anything like an in your face effect
462:15 - but
462:17 - i want it to do
462:19 - what it's it's doing there
462:21 - so
462:23 - great i
462:24 - i like it
462:26 - let's do the same thing on the right
462:28 - side
462:32 - i just want to get the things working
462:34 - now i i will style these better at the
462:36 - end somehow
462:38 - and the code is now not great yet but
462:41 - it will become better i think
462:43 - so i need more particles here
463:00 - this is actually the main location of
463:02 - the
463:08 - yeah
463:09 - this is the main location of the string
463:11 - so let's call this
463:13 - this
463:20 - string location
463:34 - initial string location
463:37 - and
463:38 - this one is going to be
463:44 - that
464:04 - okay
464:05 - and um
464:09 - this
464:13 - this
464:16 - with this in front
464:19 - otherwise like now if i re
464:22 - well i broke it but uh
464:24 - when you initialized everything was kind
464:26 - of
464:27 - spinning in place because the initial
464:29 - location was not that
464:31 - that we were forcing it to be but then
464:35 - um
464:39 - in the first second it teleports
464:41 - somewhere else and it forces the spin to
464:43 - happen
465:27 - in it
465:33 - okay
465:36 - yeah great and
465:39 - we have another one on the right
465:52 - let's put this one on the right
465:57 - oh
465:59 - yeah because it's not symmetric we i
466:01 - drew this kind of free form shape
466:05 - okay
466:07 - then let's have two of them
466:19 - or
466:20 - right and left
466:24 - i think i'm going to make a string
466:26 - object eventually
466:28 - but
466:31 - let's just see how how
466:33 - much software engineering do i need to
466:36 - use
466:46 - let's do it
466:49 - left string
466:57 - initial location
467:02 - this one
467:04 - particles
467:11 - an array
467:21 - segments
467:24 - an array
467:28 - segments should be with these particles
467:30 - and i'm not sure how to access these
467:33 - from here
467:38 - i don't think this code works
467:46 - i
467:47 - may need to extract this as a formal
467:50 - class
467:56 - but no problem
467:58 - let's see
467:59 - so left string let's put the right
468:02 - string and we'll adjust it later
468:07 - okay
468:08 - so this is now
468:12 - right string
468:13 - and here
468:30 - left string particles
468:34 - left string segments
468:42 - left string particles of zero
468:54 - is equal to and i'm just going to do the
468:56 - calculation here directly
468:59 - so
469:07 - it's going to be this dot left string
469:12 - initial location
469:19 - x
469:23 - plus the translate
469:30 - times the scale and the second one is
469:32 - going to be just the value of y
469:35 - i don't think this will work
469:38 - but
469:40 - needs to be done anyway
469:54 - yeah it doesn't work so let me extract
469:57 - this as uh
469:58 - as another class
470:06 - string and thread are called both words
470:09 - that mean something else
470:14 - hanging string
470:18 - okay
470:20 - and
470:21 - in the constructor
470:24 - we give it an initial location
470:28 - so this init lock is in it
470:34 - and
470:35 - now particles and segments can be here
470:38 - like i can write it like this like that
470:42 - this particles is equal to a new
470:44 - particle with this initial location
470:47 - these segments
470:49 - is going to be
470:51 - an array with just one segment
470:55 - and these
470:56 - particles
471:01 - okay and now i have this left string
471:04 - equals new hanging string
471:07 - of this initial location
471:10 - thing there
471:13 - and
471:15 - probably now it's going to work
471:18 - right string with the plus there
471:27 - no
471:32 - it doesn't work
471:35 - so a hanging string with these locations
471:41 - left string particles
471:44 - location is
471:47 - left string initial location plus
471:50 - blah blah
472:23 - some undefined particles
473:24 - so i'm passing it here
473:28 - the left string
473:32 - initial location
473:37 - oh dot y
473:39 - i hope it's this
473:41 - whew it's that
473:42 - great
473:46 - let's give it a draw method
473:50 - an update method and the draw method
473:55 - so
473:56 - in the update method i want to
473:58 - [Music]
474:00 - put the location of the first particle
474:03 - to something
474:07 - something like that so where is the
474:09 - attachment coming from so
474:18 - or
474:19 - no i just give it the translate and the
474:21 - scale it's a little bit confusing but
474:26 - yeah
474:27 - so this x translate and scale
474:31 - will be sent to that and it's going to
474:33 - use
474:34 - these particles of zero and this initial
474:37 - location like this
474:41 - it's not that confusing because that's
474:43 - how we are updating the the body there
474:46 - so
474:47 - it's okay
474:50 - so now i'm going to say here
474:53 - this left
474:54 - string update
474:57 - uh x translate x scale
475:01 - and
475:02 - for the right string
475:07 - i'm going to do
475:09 - the same
475:12 - thing
475:16 - maybe
475:29 - let's also
475:31 - update the physics after that
475:35 - like that
475:36 - and
475:41 - draw the things
475:43 - i have draw for that now
475:45 - so i'm going to say
475:48 - draw the particles
475:52 - and draw the segments
475:56 - i also need to update the segments
476:00 - yeah so
476:02 - a little bit confusing what i did maybe
476:04 - but
476:13 - so now i'm updating those that one and
476:17 - i'm gonna draw it this one
476:22 - on the context and same for the one on
476:25 - the right and hopefully this works now
476:29 - okay
476:36 - i think it's okay but the one on the
476:38 - right needs to be lower so
476:49 - even more
476:55 - even more
477:03 - okay and the bottom part can be even off
477:07 - the screen so
477:11 - something like that
477:12 - i
477:13 - i will style this a bit later but look
477:16 - at it now so one is moving one way the
477:18 - other one is moving a little bit
477:20 - different
477:21 - i really like this this
477:23 - effect now
477:25 - so
477:26 - about the styling we will look at later
477:29 - now what i'm gonna do is
477:39 - the hair
477:41 - so
477:45 - i'm gonna try to make
477:46 - strings like that
477:49 - here in the front so hanging somehow in
477:53 - the front and these are
477:55 - going to move and then maybe i'm going
477:57 - to do the same in the back i have longer
477:59 - hair now
478:01 - so maybe i don't worry about this top
478:03 - part just yet but here i want some hair
478:06 - to appear like this
478:08 - so let's
478:09 - let's try
478:11 - see how our
478:12 - code is at the moment
478:17 - like
478:23 - yeah basically i i want to know
478:26 - if this code is good enough
478:34 - i think it is at least for now so the
478:37 - string left and string right
478:40 - actually
478:41 - let's call this pendulum it's it's much
478:43 - better
478:45 - it's a much better name so pendulum
478:49 - uh
478:55 - like this
478:58 - yeah and let's extract it in pendulum
479:03 - js
479:04 - pendulum js
479:08 - like this
479:11 - and
479:12 - here
479:14 - in index i'm going to include
479:19 - pendulum js
479:22 - so everything still works now and the
479:24 - hair is going to be pendulum as well so
479:27 - made out of different pendulums
479:30 - maybe we make double pendulums chaotic
479:32 - pendulums let's see if enough time
479:36 - but
479:37 - i think that
479:39 - code is
479:41 - decent at the moment
479:44 - a little bit too many things here but i
479:46 - think
479:49 - fifth of them will go away because they
479:51 - are not
479:52 - needed for
479:53 - actual
479:54 - things
479:55 - all right so
479:59 - i want now to
480:03 - get back this code where i click
480:06 - and i get the chord and it's without the
480:08 - look at
480:10 - translation
480:12 - and um
480:14 - figure out some locations here in the
480:17 - beginning to put the hair
480:20 - so something like
480:22 - this location
480:26 - this this this this something like that
480:31 - so i just clicked there to something
480:33 - that looks good but i prefer to have it
480:35 - not exact so that it doesn't look too
480:37 - symmetric
480:39 - and
480:40 - these locations are going to be things
480:43 - where
480:44 - i'm going to
480:46 - add more pendulums so let's say
480:50 - this
480:51 - front
480:52 - here
480:53 - is going to be an array of pendulums so
480:56 - new pendulum
481:00 - of
481:04 - x and y
481:06 - something
481:18 - and these will need to be
481:26 - figured out somehow depending on the
481:28 - sliders
481:30 - but anyway
481:32 - one step at a time
481:34 - so now this
481:36 - value from here
481:39 - from here
481:42 - from
481:42 - here it looks the same
481:49 - starts to be positive
481:58 - thing one
481:59 - all right
482:06 - so
482:07 - uh
482:09 - yeah many pendulums in the front here so
482:12 - what do we do with them
482:13 - we update them so for
482:18 - this pendulums
482:21 - for each
482:24 - pendulum
482:26 - i'm going to say
482:29 - p dot update
482:31 - according to something i'm gonna put x
482:35 - translate
482:44 - and one at the beginning just to test
482:47 - some basic things but uh
482:49 - it will be different i'm sure
482:52 - so that's what happens first and then
482:55 - p dot draw on the context so each of the
482:57 - hair pendulums
483:00 - uh front hair not pendulums so
483:03 - for each front hair pendulum
483:06 - do this thing
483:10 - okay
483:13 - it's horrible
483:15 - so something happens but
483:18 - not what it should be
483:21 - i think
483:23 - i need to put
483:25 - something relative to
483:27 - a translation by a at least
483:32 - so
483:37 - something like this but the special
483:39 - translation for the head so these x and
483:44 - these are shirts
483:50 - shirt x translate and shirt
483:55 - x scale
484:00 - or body
484:08 - okay
484:20 - okay
484:21 - but i will need
484:27 - head x translate
484:31 - actually head translate
484:34 - and it's gonna need to have a
484:37 - x and a y
484:39 - so
484:47 - and i don't like something i have here
484:49 - this update with the scale doesn't make
484:52 - much sense
484:56 - not at all actually
485:00 - i will need to revise something here
485:04 - let's
485:05 - have another function
485:07 - update 2
485:09 - where
485:12 - it's going to have just an
485:15 - attach location i wanted to do something
485:18 - like this before so
485:20 - i just copy it inside and i say that
485:22 - this location is going to be
485:25 - this whatever
485:27 - attach location that i'm giving
485:30 - so
485:31 - if time i have to refactor this
485:36 - so hit translate
485:38 - x is going to be
485:40 - let's just put it um
486:00 - i can't put it at a
486:10 - i would like to keep these values
486:12 - somewhere
486:13 - maybe each particle is going to
486:16 - have the initial location kept
486:22 - let's see if that helps
486:24 - so
486:25 - then these numbers are as the initial
486:28 - location so this is going to be now
486:31 - this dot look at x
486:52 - so update 2
486:55 - yeah for each
486:57 - head it's different so
487:02 - update 2 with x to
487:06 - this look at x plus p
487:10 - init location
487:13 - x
487:15 - and
487:17 - this is something else not needed
487:22 - and
487:24 - it's not needed and the same thing
487:26 - happens for
487:29 - y i think
487:37 - nope
487:56 - oh
488:07 - actually
488:09 - it's not a bad idea
488:12 - [Music]
488:19 - hey
488:20 - we have it already
488:22 - i didn't need to do that so
488:24 - i don't need this initial location there
488:27 - and it's called init lock
488:32 - i don't like it let me refactor this
488:35 - like that
490:07 - okay so max and y goes there by mistake
490:17 - so the pendulum is defined with an x and
490:20 - y
490:20 - okay
490:22 - and then here
490:27 - p update
490:29 - oh this should be an array yes because
490:31 - we are in the vector place i couldn't
490:34 - use vectors
490:35 - i think for the
490:38 - pixels because
490:40 - they do have x y
490:44 - okay
490:46 - so
490:47 - let me disable now this
490:53 - pendulum
491:01 - this particle logging there it's filling
491:03 - up the console and i don't want that
491:06 - okay
491:08 - okay
491:11 - it's something it's uh something cool i
491:14 - like it length needs to be a parameter
491:17 - and these
491:22 - points here
491:24 - maybe they can be a little lower down
491:28 - so
491:32 - in the avatar where i'm defining the
491:35 - first and the last
491:37 - point i'm gonna put here minus
491:42 - 41.
491:48 - so now this is lower and the last one
491:51 - should be also
491:53 - somewhat lower
491:55 - maybe 38
492:00 - good and these lengths i think they can
492:06 - vary
492:09 - so in the pendulum the length is set to
492:12 - this
492:22 - i put the default of that but here
492:26 - when defining the avatar it's going to
492:28 - be
492:40 - no not that one
492:42 - this one
492:54 - second one i think can be 35
492:57 - i'm giving myself a haircut
493:01 - let's put this one also a bit lower
493:05 - this is
493:06 - fine
493:09 - okay
493:15 - this point is too much to the right i
493:17 - don't like it there so let me put here
493:23 - 34.
493:29 - good
493:30 - okay it's it's something interesting
493:33 - definitely interesting i i like it
493:37 - um
493:38 - i would like it to bounce somehow
493:42 - somehow
493:46 - uh
493:46 - let's try to make these as
493:50 - double pendulums
494:00 - it's not as hard as it sounds
494:03 - i think
494:04 - double pendulum
494:08 - okay
494:10 - length divided by two
494:13 - and
494:14 - one more particle
494:16 - that is going to be
494:20 - with the length so it's going to have a
494:22 - midpoint here
494:23 - and the
494:25 - segments
494:26 - will be two segments
494:28 - and
494:30 - the second one is going to be like that
494:37 - like that
494:40 - and uh that's it i think
494:45 - i just need to go here and replace with
494:47 - double pendulum
494:54 - and i get an error a double pendulum is
494:56 - not defined because i'm not including it
494:58 - anywhere
495:11 - okay
495:25 - it has a different shape
495:28 - now a little bit different behavior than
495:30 - before
495:31 - but somehow i
495:35 - i think the gravity is maybe too much
495:54 - maybe even too much
496:01 - yes
496:03 - tall and
496:04 - small but that's what i want
496:10 - more more of this kind of movement it's
496:13 - it's great
496:14 - and because the pendulums have different
496:17 - lengths then each hair is going to be
496:20 - behaving differently
496:22 - okay great i like it
496:31 - this is awesome
496:34 - i i like it a lot
496:37 - so
496:38 - what i'm gonna do next is uh do the back
496:41 - hair as well
496:45 - so the back hair
496:50 - similar to this i think it's not too
496:52 - complicated
497:04 - and
497:05 - [Music]
497:08 - then i'm gonna try to make the mouth
497:10 - move
497:12 - so
497:13 - i will keep the hair ugly like this for
497:15 - now and
497:19 - think about it later how to get it
497:21 - better
497:23 - but
497:27 - yeah so styling the hair will be the
497:29 - fine tuning part
497:31 - so now let me add similar things for the
497:34 - back here so front hair is there
497:41 - back here
497:45 - and
497:49 - let's have it very similar to this
497:54 - the same in the beginning
497:57 - but this needs to be longer maybe
497:59 - [Music]
498:02 - just replace these threes with the six
498:06 - and now the back here
498:10 - goes through the same things
498:14 - like this
498:20 - i refresh
498:21 - and it's there
498:23 - but
498:25 - it should be
498:27 - in the back
498:29 - and it should be lower
498:31 - so let's put here
498:35 - let's replace this four with the two
498:40 - this three with the one
498:44 - i think that's fine and this six with
498:46 - the seven
498:54 - okay and the problem now
498:57 - there are
498:58 - two problems actually
499:06 - it should be opposite of what a is doing
499:10 - so when you move the head up this back
499:13 - hair has to go down and when you do this
499:16 - this back hair has to go up
499:18 - so this back here
499:29 - i want a reflection here i want to
499:33 - not the reflection but a
499:36 - symmetric a point that is symmetric
499:41 - somehow
499:45 - this look at
499:49 - point that we define here in the
499:51 - beginning
499:53 - i wanted to have
500:06 - initial values so
500:08 - init x
500:10 - 0
500:11 - init y
500:13 - minus 0.13
500:15 - this is not the
500:17 - best way
500:18 - the clearest way to do it but
500:23 - i want to
500:24 - get this done
500:26 - so
500:28 - i keep the same value so that they never
500:30 - change
500:32 - and then in the avatar here when we are
500:35 - moving this so what i want to have here
500:38 - is a
500:40 - symmetric point on the other side of
500:42 - this one so i'm going to say
500:45 - i don't have the vector operations for x
500:47 - and y but
501:23 - so init x and init y are going to just
501:26 - keep them static right
501:32 - yes so those
501:34 - are the initial locations of that a
501:36 - point so now what i want is
501:40 - this point here
501:42 - is the
501:43 - initial one so i want
501:46 - this pendulum to move
501:48 - down here
501:50 - symmetric with respect to this pendulum
501:53 - so i have this location and i have this
501:55 - location
501:57 - if i subtract
501:59 - from x
502:00 - the initial x
502:06 - i need this vector right here
502:41 - i think it's like this
502:47 - i would really like to use the same
502:49 - operations there that's the vectors but
502:53 - i think i i could
502:55 - i just
502:57 - want to get things done now
503:00 - maybe have time to refactor this
503:09 - yeah yeah this is good this is very good
503:12 - it's just confusing that the
503:14 - back hair is in front so let me move it
503:17 - in the back
503:18 - somehow uh
503:22 - when we are drawing the head i want
503:26 - actually behind the body
503:28 - or i don't know
503:31 - yeah behind the body also so it's going
503:34 - to be
503:36 - here
503:49 - great
503:50 - they need to be
503:53 - longer
504:03 - and this one is too high up i can see it
504:06 - there i don't want that
504:08 - so
504:09 - the one on the right needs to be
504:12 - a little bit more to the left
504:15 - and let's put here eight
504:46 - okay
504:52 - let me make everything a bit um
504:59 - transparent
505:04 - doesn't work
505:09 - i don't draw the head
505:46 - i think
505:47 - um
506:23 - it's fine
506:32 - it's not fine i don't like it i think
506:34 - the front part it's interesting that
506:37 - it's like that but the back part those
506:40 - pendulums are so long
506:44 - that
506:46 - and the gravity is so weak that it
506:48 - affects them in some
506:50 - not so great way
506:52 - so what i want to do
507:00 - is put here a value of
507:04 - 3
507:05 - and in this update 2
507:12 - here
507:16 - gravity multiplier
507:24 - yes
507:25 - so
507:28 - i will pass this to the physics the idea
507:30 - is that
507:32 - i want them to be more solid than the
507:35 - the ones in front i mean not so much
507:37 - bouncing around
507:39 - and i just use this trick to get it to
507:42 - work
507:43 - of course it's not a realistic
507:45 - simulation but
507:47 - this is more about
507:49 - animation and how things look like and
507:51 - how they should
507:52 - look like on
507:54 - when drawing something so
507:56 - i don't care about reality
507:59 - really
508:00 - and
508:04 - i'm sending now this gravity multiplier
508:08 - to
508:14 - the double pendulum
508:18 - update physics items
508:32 - gravity multiplier
508:35 - gravity multiplier
508:38 - and the update is going to be
508:47 - usually it's nothing
508:49 - but otherwise it's going to be
508:52 - scaling
508:56 - g with this gravity multiplier so
509:02 - yeah by default it's one
509:04 - and here we are not using the gravity so
509:07 - we don't need to pass anything to to
509:10 - this
509:11 - i think let's save
509:20 - so the hair in the front is behaving in
509:22 - one way the hair in the back is behaving
509:25 - more rigidly if i'm going to put this
509:28 - avatar to have here maybe 30 then
509:32 - those hairs in the back are going to be
509:36 - very very
509:37 - rigid they are being pulled down so hard
509:40 - by that
509:41 - increased gravity
509:43 - that they are not allowed to move
509:46 - uh
509:47 - like the ones in front are jumping there
509:49 - but i'm not gonna exaggerate so much i'm
509:52 - just gonna put here maybe
509:54 - ten
510:00 - yeah i still want them to move somehow
510:02 - but
510:02 - not extreme like
510:04 - that okay
510:06 - great
510:17 - i think i'm gonna take a break and then
510:20 - what i'm gonna do next is gonna be
510:26 - the
510:27 - something with this blue and my face and
510:30 - i don't like really how that sounds
510:34 - i hope that i can use this tape somehow
510:38 - and make some blue markers on the face
510:41 - and i'm gonna move to do the
510:47 - mouth
510:48 - the mouth movements
510:52 - yes he agrees
510:56 - good
510:56 - okay so i'm gonna go have lunch and
511:01 - continue after that
511:07 - okay i'm back
511:09 - and uh we are going to do this mouth
511:12 - movement next
511:13 - so i'm gonna begin it by adding a couple
511:17 - of more sliders one that controls how
511:19 - the mouth opens like this
511:22 - like
511:22 - that and then another one
511:26 - upwards and
511:27 - remember only this part of the face
511:30 - moves actually so this top part of the
511:33 - mouth is always going to be at the same
511:35 - same place but
511:37 - this is
511:38 - move the down movement is what will
511:40 - happen
511:42 - so
511:43 - i'm going to
511:45 - just change the shape of the beard here
511:47 - and this bottom most point
511:50 - to somehow
511:52 - be controlled by the sliders and also
511:54 - this empty space right here
511:56 - i'm probably not going to draw an actual
511:58 - mouth i
512:00 - i hope
512:01 - i think this empty space might be enough
512:04 - with the movement of the
512:06 - chin to give the idea of talking
512:10 - otherwise
512:11 - it's more work
512:14 - so let's see i'm going to go to
512:16 - index.html
512:20 - and
512:23 - i'm going to
512:28 - put some more sliders here on the right
512:31 - so i'm going to say
512:42 - like this
512:46 - and
512:47 - i think same settings at the as before
512:50 - but
512:53 - update
512:54 - mouth
513:02 - and update mouth these will be some new
513:04 - functions there
513:06 - so if i refresh
513:10 - this is fine
513:11 - and
513:12 - let's add at the top there something
513:15 - like
513:17 - look at
513:22 - yeah
513:24 - and um
513:48 - i think this is better
514:01 - i'm gonna use capital values and i don't
514:04 - need um i mean capital letters and i'm
514:06 - not gonna
514:07 - need the column anymore i think it's
514:09 - quite obvious what these are
514:16 - i think that's good
514:21 - so um
514:22 - maybe here it's
514:25 - it's clear if i put
514:29 - column on the
514:31 - right of these words
514:35 - okay so these need to do something and
514:37 - update mouth is a function that doesn't
514:40 - exist so let's go down to
514:44 - where this one is and um
515:07 - um
515:16 - i'm gonna have to pass to
515:21 - yeah i don't know why i complicated
515:23 - things
515:25 - so much with this global variable i
515:27 - think i'm just going to access the
515:31 - avatar
515:34 - and tell the avatar what is the value
515:38 - and that's it
515:42 - so
515:43 - um
516:14 - like that
516:18 - so
516:19 - inside of the avatar i'm going to have a
516:24 - mouth
516:39 - um attribute with
516:43 - 0 x and y
516:46 - and
516:50 - actually this should be passed down to
516:52 - the beard as well because
516:58 - the beard is what is going to change
517:00 - shape according to these values so
517:03 - inside of the beard object i'm going to
517:06 - say here
517:11 - mouth info
517:14 - mouth info so some information about the
517:17 - mouth according to these sliders here
517:23 - okay
517:25 - so now when we do this draw half beard
517:29 - we need to remember
517:31 - what this
517:32 - what these shapes are and it's not very
517:35 - complicated
517:36 - we were moving
517:39 - here
517:43 - and then
517:45 - doing a curve here
517:48 - a curve here
517:51 - and then align to here nothing changes
517:54 - so much
517:55 - but now this point will change
518:01 - so that point
518:03 - will change according to the mouth x
518:09 - and then we have
518:11 - a line to here here
518:15 - here
518:16 - all of these three
518:20 - will change uh with y
518:25 - so
518:38 - i'm just gonna guess some scalers for
518:40 - how much this info is going to affect
518:56 - and let's see what happens
519:04 - okay
519:06 - this month
519:18 - so this is just going to pass a
519:19 - reference and every time we change this
519:21 - object it's going to
519:24 - should be updated in the beard as well
519:41 - too much too much way too much
519:44 - so
519:45 - here in the beard
519:50 - let's put um
519:51 - dot one
519:58 - maybe it's okay
520:00 - i think it's okay
520:03 - and uh vertically
520:14 - this also needs to be smaller
520:32 - yeah but i think that actually the this
520:36 - last
520:37 - two points here could be a little bit
520:40 - lower
520:41 - this 46
521:01 - i think that's fine
521:03 - so the mouth is like that and
521:06 - actually
521:07 - the bottom most point also needs the
521:10 - same thing here
521:12 - so for the y value
521:14 - um
521:18 - yeah and let's make some
521:21 - constants here so
521:23 - mouth stretch
521:25 - x
521:27 - is equal to this amount
521:36 - and mouth stretch you
521:49 - so that it's clear
521:51 - what these things that are also
521:54 - repeating very much
521:56 - mean
522:10 - okay
522:11 - something is bad here
522:23 - because when the mouth closes like that
522:25 - it um
522:32 - i can see that
522:33 - bottom point which used to be
522:37 - c i think
522:40 - so let me try to fix that i'm gonna go
522:43 - to
522:45 - the
522:53 - avatar
522:55 - and in draw head
522:57 - let's try to put this
523:02 - yeah very complicated function there for
523:04 - the translations and
523:26 - almost good
523:38 - i see that line a little bit and i don't
523:41 - like it
523:42 - but um
523:47 - i don't think i needed a stroke
523:50 - and then i just see the neck in the
523:52 - background
524:00 - yeah
524:01 - let's see so
524:07 - and i don't actually need this code
524:09 - anymore this was just for reference in
524:11 - the beginning
524:12 - they were those uh
524:15 - cross shape thing for the
524:17 - head i think yeah
524:19 - and here
524:21 - what if i just don't do the stroke
524:33 - it's perfect
524:34 - i don't see any anything wrong with that
524:40 - great
524:56 - okay
524:58 - good so no need for this
525:04 - and and
525:09 - now that i have these controls for the
525:11 - mouth i'm going to start to do some
525:14 - image processing here so that the mouth
525:17 - will
525:19 - the mouth information comes from
525:22 - a set of points around the face and
525:25 - actually the head should also come
525:28 - from my
525:29 - movement somehow so i'm thinking
525:32 - one thing needs to be static somewhere
525:35 - like a blue point should be here
525:40 - um
525:41 - and then
525:44 - here on the side of the mouth
525:47 - i need something so
525:48 - two points here on the sides of the
525:50 - mouth
525:52 - they should be quite close to the mouth
525:55 - so this might be
525:57 - difficult to place and i have the beard
525:59 - here it's horrible
526:01 - and then
526:02 - one point
526:04 - also needed here so two points there
526:08 - one point here
526:10 - and one point here so maybe then we use
526:13 - the bottom point
526:15 - relative to this point to figure out
526:18 - side to side movement
526:21 - and uh
526:25 - no
526:43 - i don't like that this point is changing
526:45 - vertically and we might need this
526:47 - distance for something
526:50 - like we might need this distance for
526:53 - um
526:58 - figuring out how much the head should
527:00 - move and so on so then if you're talking
527:02 - like this it might
527:04 - move your head in unexpected ways later
527:09 - will it yes
527:11 - basically
527:12 - the up and down movement like this it's
527:14 - the same as if my my mouth opens
527:18 - so
527:22 - i need this point for mouth up and down
527:27 - i also need something static maybe on
527:29 - the nose
527:30 - so let's start with the point here and
527:33 - the point on the nose and see if we get
527:35 - just the head movement that we have now
527:38 - and then do that
527:40 - more sophisticated thing i have a bit of
527:43 - a worry that this camera here that i'm
527:45 - using in front is not that good or
527:50 - let's see
527:51 - can it recognize very small objects if
527:58 - um i will have to play with the
528:00 - thresholds and and things for the image
528:02 - processing but first i'm gonna take this
528:05 - tape and i'm going to
528:08 - cut some things from the tape
528:13 - so this is double-sided tape and i'm
528:17 - hoping it will hold
528:19 - on my face
528:24 - and i have this marker here that i'm
528:27 - going to
528:30 - color it with so that it's blue
528:34 - i really didn't have it was clo shops
528:37 - were closed yesterday and i couldn't buy
528:39 - anything better
528:41 - i just had this tape at home
528:52 - so
529:24 - of course another option would be to
529:26 - draw on my face
529:28 - i really hope i don't have to do that
529:30 - and
529:31 - i think that the way that collar behaves
529:34 - on
529:35 - skin is
529:37 - not so great
529:41 - okay something works
529:44 - so
529:48 - i made something like this by
529:51 - coloring some tape on one side and i'm
529:53 - gonna put
529:55 - here
529:57 - i guess
530:05 - and it's not fantastic because
530:08 - light reflects from
530:10 - it
530:15 - i think it's recognized but sometimes it
530:17 - may not be recognized
530:20 - uh
530:26 - yeah
530:28 - not much i can do about it i think maybe
530:30 - i can change the lights somehow in the
530:32 - room later
530:33 - but um
530:36 - let's do tell one on the nose
530:40 - and i'm gonna look funny for some time
530:44 - if this stays on my nose
531:27 - okay
531:36 - great
531:39 - i really hope i win this
531:49 - so
531:51 - okay some strange movements there
531:54 - happening
531:55 - uh
531:56 - let's move on to
532:01 - due to
532:02 - uh the
532:04 - image processing part so here in index
532:08 - we were doing something with the video
532:10 - and
532:11 - getting the marked locations but i'm not
532:13 - convinced that this function works that
532:16 - great
532:17 - i would like to see the locations on the
532:20 - canvas here highlighted maybe i'm going
532:22 - to turn these
532:24 - blue pixels into
532:28 - red pixels by
532:30 - changing the pixel color there
532:37 - so
532:39 - let's display them
532:41 - i'm going to
532:42 - loop
532:45 - and now these are vectors actually
532:52 - so i'm going to loop through them and
532:54 - say
532:57 - cam ctx begin path
533:02 - cam ctx
533:06 - fill style red
533:09 - cam ctx
533:14 - arc
533:15 - no
533:16 - just a small rectangle so
533:18 - wrecked
533:20 - at the location so i can
533:24 - spread
533:25 - the location of i
533:28 - and one pixel one pixel for the width
533:30 - and the height
533:32 - and
533:35 - fill
533:36 - so now i'm debugging
533:39 - the small canvas there
533:41 - to see
533:46 - these are red
533:53 - not always red
533:56 - [Music]
534:01 - so what's the problem here if i go to
534:03 - the get marked locations
534:07 - and if i bring this color here
534:10 - okay this is
534:13 - not always red
534:23 - not always
534:25 - i mean sometimes it doesn't look red
534:28 - at all
534:32 - i think
534:33 - some problem can be with the threshold
534:36 - that i'm using maybe i could make it a
534:38 - bit higher but i think that if it's too
534:40 - high then maybe my shirt will look blue
534:43 - or
534:49 - let's try to go here
534:52 - 200 but
534:53 - this really depends on the room
534:57 - no something here is now turning
535:02 - turning blue
535:07 - how about without the headset
535:13 - no some things there are just too much
535:16 - so maybe this
535:18 - needs to be something like that
535:28 - it might be good enough if there would
535:30 - not be these reflections there
535:35 - so
535:40 - i'm gonna do something about the lights
535:41 - in this
536:26 - um
536:44 - okay and now i can't see very well
536:46 - because i looked directly in the light
536:55 - ah
536:56 - going great
537:06 - still waiting
537:09 - ah good that time is ticking and i have
537:12 - maybe
537:15 - three hours left of available
537:20 - time
537:20 - i can use for this
537:22 - i'm not gonna use anymore
537:25 - okay getting a little better
537:30 - so
537:35 - i think some
537:37 - it's better
537:38 - this
537:39 - detection seems to be
537:41 - seems to be better
537:44 - and if i'm hiding these blue things
537:50 - then the sliders work again
537:53 - so
537:54 - of course um
537:56 - i have to code now these things a little
537:58 - bit differently so
538:00 - i want to know where this is and where
538:02 - this is
538:10 - all right
538:21 - so
538:21 - [Music]
538:23 - how do i do that
538:27 - well
538:30 - i'm really concerned first about this
538:32 - bottom point so this is my most
538:34 - important point there
538:36 - and
538:38 - i want to detect it first
538:40 - so let's figure out how to get this
538:43 - bottom point first
539:01 - and
539:06 - let's just
539:07 - do here something like process
539:14 - image and move the code there because it
539:18 - starts to be horrible where it is at the
539:20 - moment we may need to add some more
539:22 - files here
539:25 - uh actually i'm gonna
539:27 - move these
539:28 - to
539:32 - camera
539:34 - file since
539:36 - that's where we initialize the camera
539:38 - and it's close enough to
539:41 - image processing
539:43 - at the moment
539:46 - so
539:48 - function
539:49 - process image
539:52 - and the video and the camera context are
539:54 - global
539:56 - variables i think everything here should
539:59 - still work now
540:02 - yeah
540:03 - so here this is just for debugging
540:22 - so now the
540:24 - markers here on the right are
540:27 - not changing color
540:29 - but if i put debug to true i will also
540:32 - see point a there
540:34 - but uh it's fine
540:37 - and
540:38 - this does change like that so
540:40 - inside of the camera file
540:48 - i'm going to
540:55 - also here say
541:02 - find
541:06 - um get constellation so these are two
541:11 - stars two points and there will be two
541:14 - more here and probably one more here so
541:16 - i'm gonna have a function that gets me
541:18 - this constellation
541:21 - from these
541:22 - marked locations
541:24 - so i
541:25 - of course now there are many many
541:27 - locations here that are making this red
541:29 - point and
541:30 - this one so they will need to be
541:32 - averaged or something
541:35 - but um
541:37 - let's get them like this and say here
541:40 - const constellations
541:44 - constellation
541:48 - or just points
541:50 - is
541:51 - get
541:52 - those
541:53 - things i don't know why i want to call
541:55 - it like that technical term is
541:57 - clustering but uh i'm not going to use
541:59 - any clustering algorithm for this
542:02 - i want it to be more reliable and
542:04 - they tend to be either
542:06 - slow or too complicated or
542:10 - random
542:12 - in some cases
542:13 - so i want to detect first this point
542:17 - with this get constellation function
542:26 - and
542:28 - then i will want to draw them
542:30 - so
542:40 - we'll get to that but inside of this get
542:43 - constellation function
542:47 - i want to say
543:00 - get the point with the minimum
543:03 - y value so i think the point with the
543:05 - minimum y value must be inside of this
543:08 - one
543:09 - here
543:11 - in this region
543:12 - many points here
543:14 - so let's say
543:16 - um
543:23 - meanwhile point is
543:27 - find the point
543:30 - so that
543:34 - this location or this point that we are
543:38 - inspecting
543:42 - this is a vector now so the
543:44 - second component is the y
543:47 - is equal to
543:54 - math
543:55 - the
543:56 - maximum actually because y grows
543:59 - downwards on the computer so maximum
544:02 - um
544:06 - of the y values
544:09 - of the locations so i'm going to say
544:11 - here
544:13 - locations
544:14 - map
544:27 - like this so this is going to give me an
544:29 - array this map here is going to give me
544:32 - an array of all the y values then the
544:35 - max is going to be the maximum of those
544:38 - y values and here we're going to find
544:40 - the point with the maximum of the y
544:42 - values
544:43 - so let's leave this here
544:46 - and
544:47 - now
544:54 - let's return it for now
544:57 - just one point
545:00 - okay
545:02 - and
545:04 - this is just one point now
545:06 - and um
545:08 - we were using something to draw this a
545:11 - point previously so um
545:20 - i don't know where that is it's in the
545:22 - avatar
545:25 - draw head
545:29 - this one the draw point
545:31 - so i want this to happen now in the
545:38 - on the camera screen there
545:47 - but it may not be very visible
545:50 - because here there's some scaling
545:52 - happening and here there's not
545:54 - let's just see what happens so
545:58 - drop point
546:01 - it's some utility function
546:05 - oh my the canvas is not even specified
546:12 - so ctx and let me change this inside of
546:16 - the avatar give it the ctx here and
546:19 - we're not really using it anywhere so
546:21 - that's good
546:22 - now here
546:24 - um
546:27 - cam
546:28 - ctx
546:31 - and uh
546:32 - let's call this point now
546:35 - m
546:40 - point
546:41 - so the one we are getting the bottom
546:43 - point from here
547:03 - this should be with x and y
547:37 - it's undefined
548:10 - really how is that possible
548:15 - because there must be some points there
548:23 - to have some mistake here let me just
548:26 - first
548:35 - log this part
548:53 - okay so these look like some y values
548:56 - indeed
549:06 - oh
549:07 - this is an array here
549:10 - it's an array and
549:12 - max doesn't work with array it works
549:14 - with
549:15 - many parameter values so i have to
549:21 - spread that right there
549:31 - okay
549:34 - no error at least
549:37 - but
549:44 - oh i
549:45 - should probably include this doctype
549:48 - here
549:52 - so this thing doesn't appear anymore
549:56 - okay
549:57 - i think the point that we are displaying
549:59 - is
550:01 - too small
550:05 - so when we draw the point here i'm gonna
550:07 - have to give it some big radius
550:10 - bigger radius
550:16 - something is there now but uh what
550:19 - happened to everything else
550:26 - what happened
550:46 - did that in this dog type do something
550:48 - to my css
550:50 - what
550:51 - really
550:59 - how did that happen
551:23 - okay
551:25 - so
551:26 - now the point is actually here this
551:29 - small m there
551:32 - so um
551:36 - it's not exactly in the middle of all
551:39 - these red points here at the bottom
551:42 - but maybe we'll get to that
551:44 - first i wanted to have this
551:48 - m point there
551:51 - and uh i need to draw this a little bit
551:54 - bigger it's just too small so um
551:58 - going back to the camera
552:09 - and now i think it's too big because if
552:11 - i'm gonna have many small ones there
552:17 - yeah it's good a little bit fidgeting
552:20 - like that but it's it's fine
552:22 - so
552:23 - this is just the one point the minimum y
552:27 - point
552:28 - now i'm gonna
552:29 - take the nose point
552:32 - so
552:33 - um
552:34 - to get the point on the nose i'm
552:36 - basically gonna get
552:38 - the farthest away point from m
552:42 - and i'm doing that
552:46 - i i think i can also get the one with
552:49 - the smallest
552:51 - y
552:54 - but i'm gonna use this furthest away
552:56 - from trick later so let's do that
553:00 - i will say
553:01 - let i
553:02 - like that
553:04 - i teach it better in this way
553:08 - so going through all the locations i'm
553:10 - going to calculate
553:15 - the distance between
553:20 - locations of i
553:22 - and
553:23 - the min y
553:25 - point which is actually the max y point
553:28 - because
553:29 - y grows downwards
553:31 - so
553:33 - yeah max
553:34 - so
553:35 - the distance from
553:37 - each point to that one and i'm going to
553:39 - take the maximum so
553:41 - i'm going to say
553:47 - nose
553:48 - point
553:49 - is going to be
553:53 - just some location
553:55 - like that
553:57 - and
554:06 - and that and here
554:09 - if distance is more than max distance
554:14 - then max distance is going to be
554:17 - distance and
554:19 - nose point will be updated to be
554:22 - the location of i something like this so
554:25 - just getting the maximum
554:27 - the furthest away point from
554:31 - this end point
554:33 - and now i have two points that i want to
554:37 - return so i'm going to call this chest
554:41 - and max y point
554:44 - and
554:46 - nose
554:47 - [Music]
554:49 - nose point
554:52 - i think i should call this one
554:55 - chest
554:57 - point
555:01 - it's clear that it's the max y from this
555:04 - line of code there
555:06 - so
555:07 - now i have two things that i'm returning
555:10 - and i have here points
555:12 - and um
555:14 - or i could have
555:17 - destructuring here like nose and chest
555:21 - and now i can say draw the
555:24 - nose point
555:29 - let's call it
555:31 - n actually for nose
555:34 - and the other one which is m here let's
555:36 - call it
555:37 - c for chest
555:47 - okay
555:53 - okay so i have the nose and i have the
555:56 - chest
555:57 - and it seems to be quite quite reliable
556:00 - sometimes problems because of this
556:03 - shininess
556:05 - i couldn't do everything i wanted with
556:07 - the lights because
556:09 - the window is also there and it's too
556:12 - complicated
556:13 - but
556:15 - this is something that kind of works now
556:18 - at least
556:20 - a little bit
556:21 - and it can be much better in better room
556:24 - conditions or with different types of
556:26 - markers here that don't
556:29 - shine because
556:31 - there are materials that don't shine out
556:34 - there and
556:35 - i just happen to have a crappy one
556:50 - does this mask
556:52 - work as blue if i change the color
556:56 - now
556:57 - i think this is okay for this demo
557:02 - okay so chest point nosepoint
557:05 - what do we do with them
557:08 - well
557:10 - um
557:17 - i need to know some
557:20 - i need to calibrate the system
557:22 - so i'm going to add here a button that
557:26 - says
557:26 - calibrate
557:31 - and
557:33 - html
557:49 - like that
557:51 - and
557:53 - when we press on this
557:58 - calibrate light
558:01 - i wonder if this is how you write
558:03 - calibrate
558:05 - anyway i don't use internet so
558:10 - i can't check
558:12 - so calibrate
558:14 - um
558:16 - it should go also in the camera for now
558:18 - at least
558:28 - so what happens now here is that
558:32 - i want to
558:36 - i really want to keep these as a global
558:38 - variable so
558:43 - let's call these
559:10 - something like that
559:19 - and now that and here i can still
559:21 - destructure so
559:39 - okay
559:41 - and when i calibrate i'm going to
559:44 - let's just log this
559:48 - like that
559:55 - okay so i have the nose and the chest
559:59 - coordinates
560:00 - when calibrated
560:02 - so what i'm going to do is
560:05 - when i press calibrate i'm going to make
560:07 - a copy
560:08 - of these
560:11 - points
560:17 - yeah i will say here
560:24 - the reference location so
560:27 - the reference
560:28 - um
560:29 - is going to be the one when you press
560:31 - the calibrate and then we're going to
560:33 - calculate relative to those somehow
560:36 - so
560:37 - constellation points
560:40 - reference is equal to
560:52 - nose is gonna be
560:58 - like that
561:00 - and
561:01 - the chest
561:06 - is gonna be like that so
561:09 - now i can log it after that
561:13 - and if i'm gonna press calibrate i'm
561:15 - gonna get
561:17 - the nose and the reference
561:20 - and if i move now
561:22 - a little bit and i check constellation
561:28 - points like this i should get
561:36 - i'm losing them
561:44 - yeah i'm losing them i'm replacing them
561:46 - here
561:47 - so let's add the code as before
561:54 - like this
561:56 - and now
562:01 - i just write here constellation points
562:04 - nose is equal to nose
562:08 - i think this is going to work
562:20 - yeah now they're equal but if i'm moving
562:22 - and i'm
562:26 - debugging
562:30 - they are not equal anymore
562:32 - so relative to this
562:34 - uh change so depending on this change
562:38 - somehow
562:42 - because i need to know
562:44 - how far
562:45 - is n from c to be able to do the head
562:50 - movement like this properly
562:52 - so now
562:57 - i don't need this log anymore i believe
562:59 - they are working
563:01 - based on this calibration
563:13 - here
563:17 - i want to
563:21 - based on nose and chest now
563:25 - and the reference nose and
563:28 - and chest i'm going to figure out
563:31 - something here so let's get the distance
563:34 - between nose and chest so
563:36 - distance between nose and chest
563:42 - let's just call this d1
563:45 - and
563:46 - d2 is going to be the distance between
563:51 - the ref
563:52 - the constellation points
563:55 - ref nose
563:57 - and constellation points
564:00 - ref chest
564:02 - so these are the
564:04 - other values when we press the calibrate
564:06 - button
564:08 - so two distances here so now um
564:12 - depending on how much these distances
564:15 - change if if d2 is exactly equal to d1
564:19 - then
564:20 - the head is gonna stand stand still but
564:23 - if d1 is going to be bigger it means the
564:27 - head should go up
564:32 - so
564:34 - d1 minus d2 and then we figure out some
564:38 - kind of
564:40 - scalar for that
564:42 - so i'm going to say here
564:45 - d1 minus d2
565:00 - the difference on y so this is d1 minus
565:03 - d2
565:06 - and that's going to be the value for
565:08 - this
565:09 - and i'm not gonna
565:11 - change x anymore i'm just debugging now
565:13 - so the head can't move
565:27 - all right we need to have a reference
565:46 - so without pressing calibrate nothing
565:48 - happens
565:49 - and now if i calibrate
565:59 - very interesting
566:01 - [Music]
566:04 - very interesting
566:10 - yep
566:12 - way too much
566:14 - we divide by the
566:16 - height
566:26 - and i think i messed something up here
566:28 - it should be d1 d2 minus d1
566:36 - calibrate first
566:40 - okay but i want more stronger than that
566:43 - so let's scale this by something let's
566:46 - say
566:47 - five times what it's doing at the moment
566:52 - i press calibrate
566:57 - okay
566:58 - and now horizontally nothing happens but
567:02 - it's easy i think let's just call this y
567:05 - one and y two
567:08 - uh
567:09 - they mean some distances um
567:12 - to the
567:14 - nose
567:15 - or no they were the distances yes sorry
567:20 - but horizontally we need something
567:22 - similar so
567:24 - we need we don't use actually the
567:26 - reference anymore
567:28 - i just want to know if n is on the left
567:31 - or on the right of this c right here
567:35 - so
567:43 - yeah
567:44 - so i'm going to say
567:47 - diff
567:48 - x
567:52 - is
567:56 - nose
567:57 - x minus chest x
568:02 - and also i'm going to divide this by
568:15 - i want to divide by this d1 actually
568:20 - let's see
568:22 - i
568:23 - i'm starting to get tired and i can't
568:25 - really explain anymore why i think some
568:28 - of these some of these things work
568:31 - but
568:35 - basically the distance
568:37 - this distance i want to use somehow for
568:40 - normalizing
568:42 - and
568:43 - this should be here and this code should
568:46 - work now
568:48 - i mean should be active
568:54 - okay very interesting
568:58 - very interesting
569:36 - something is strange
569:39 - oh these
569:40 - don't have x and y they have
569:43 - zero and one
569:45 - i
569:46 - i hope
569:48 - uh
569:49 - and i'm interested in x so zero for both
569:52 - of them
570:02 - nice i like it
570:07 - maybe multiply this by two
570:13 - okay
570:14 - calibrate
570:19 - yeah
570:20 - this starts to feel awesome i i'm really
570:23 - excited about this
570:25 - sometimes crazy stuff happens like if a
570:27 - point disappears
570:31 - but that's just how it is i'm not i
570:33 - don't even know what to do about things
570:35 - like that
570:36 - it will work in very good lighting
570:38 - conditions even better than this room
570:41 - and um
570:42 - if these things don't
570:45 - don't shine i think this room is quite
570:47 - good actually but the the material on
570:50 - these things is not great
570:55 - [Music]
570:56 - so some crazy stuff can happen
570:59 - when i'm testing but
571:02 - and there's a fidgeting here you can see
571:04 - the head somehow fidgeting all the time
571:07 - because
571:08 - i'm not actually detecting
571:11 - uh very well
571:14 - the center of all the blue points there
571:18 - so i would like to do that
571:23 - eventually
571:24 - let's fine-tune this later so
571:29 - i want now to detect
571:31 - points
571:32 - on the side of the mouth
571:35 - no this point on the bottom of the mouth
571:37 - next
571:42 - no the sides of the mouth so i need to
571:46 - cut some more of this
571:49 - tape
571:51 - and
571:52 - i'm going to do it in a smarter way now
571:54 - i'm
571:56 - going to actually
571:58 - peel the outer layer i can't draw on the
572:01 - outer layer because it's too slippery
572:03 - and the color just leaves off
572:06 - it's this kind of wax paper
572:10 - so i'm gonna
572:13 - draw here blue on one side
572:18 - for
572:21 - three more points
573:02 - like that
573:06 - and now i just cut these
573:32 - always important to
573:34 - pay attention to what you're doing
573:36 - normal things that what you're doing
573:39 - and see what can be improved because if
573:41 - you keep doing
573:42 - something in a
573:44 - bad way like how i drew these the first
573:47 - time then you never become better at
573:50 - things
573:53 - [Music]
574:15 - i don't think it will stay there
574:27 - stays on my lip
574:33 - not where i want it to be
574:35 - i want it to be
574:36 - here on the side
574:42 - nope
574:45 - i'm in trouble
574:52 - this bottom part of the lip is fine
575:02 - so at least i can do that
575:06 - it's not the best but
575:09 - it stays here i think
575:11 - the other ones i really don't know what
575:14 - to do about them
575:26 - so
575:27 - one here for opening the mouth it's
575:29 - definitely possible but i can't open the
575:31 - mouth
575:33 - sideways which is
575:40 - hello
575:41 - hello
575:44 - hello
575:45 - hello
575:47 - maybe the points here
575:57 - hello
575:58 - hello
576:06 - they are too much
576:08 - um how to say
576:11 - now they aren't on the side of the face
576:13 - and they are really getting light from
576:15 - the window and it's a problem there
576:20 - um it really needs to be here
576:28 - maybe i can somehow wrap it around my
576:32 - beard
576:45 - is this
577:09 - hmm
577:14 - i don't know how reliable this is
577:26 - because from the front you just don't
577:27 - see it now
577:35 - or
577:44 - maybe something
577:48 - so somehow wrapping it around the beard
577:52 - and
577:54 - inwards at the same time
577:58 - yeah hard to describe what i'm doing i
578:01 - don't know
578:03 - how to say it
578:04 - but
578:06 - i might be able to pull this off let's
578:09 - see
578:36 - hmm
578:39 - is it getting anything
578:48 - [Music]
578:54 - maybe on the outside
579:06 - no
579:08 - okay
579:12 - ow
579:14 - horrible
579:29 - i'm gonna have to make new ones
579:33 - i think that attaching it to the beard
579:36 - like that works
579:56 - i think attaching it to the beard
580:01 - does something
580:05 - but then i have to
580:06 - use two types of tapes so
580:09 - one of it is gonna be just to
580:13 - attach to the beard
580:30 - so i'm gonna
580:31 - put it
580:40 - just here like that
580:43 - i think
580:46 - and
580:55 - yeah
580:57 - something like that and the next one is
581:00 - going to this normal blue thing which i
581:02 - have to do again
581:07 - and attach it
581:15 - what
581:19 - oh great yeah new point coming in
581:22 - somewhere
582:30 - something like that
582:35 - it's not very
582:38 - good
582:41 - but
582:43 - i think it will work i think something
582:45 - will work and i probably look horrible
582:48 - and can i still drink
582:56 - yeah
582:57 - so we have two points and now i want to
583:00 - get this let's just call it left right
583:02 - and
583:05 - l
583:06 - r
583:07 - b
583:08 - so that's how these points are going to
583:10 - be called
583:11 - l r and b
583:14 - and um
583:15 - let's get point
583:17 - l
583:19 - l or r it uh it doesn't matter they are
583:22 - kind of the same thing and the property
583:25 - of that will be that
583:26 - the
583:27 - sum of distance from this one to this
583:32 - and to this
583:35 - must be maximum so the farthest away
583:37 - point from here
583:39 - is going to be that point that has the
583:41 - biggest possible distance to n and c
583:45 - so
583:47 - let's call that point
583:51 - l
583:53 - l point
583:56 - and say that it's the location of zero
583:59 - as before
584:00 - i'm going to copy this code
584:04 - and
584:05 - [Music]
584:07 - a new max distance i'm just going to
584:09 - reinitialize it with zero
584:11 - and the distance is going to be the
584:13 - distance to the chest point
584:17 - plus the distance to the nose point
584:24 - so
584:26 - yeah
584:27 - then
584:28 - l point is going to be the new one
584:31 - and let's just call it
584:33 - l
584:37 - l point
584:39 - like this
584:40 - so now with our constellations here
584:51 - i just want to draw it
584:53 - so l of 0 l of 1 and let's just call it
584:57 - l
585:06 - i need to
585:08 - destructure it here as well
585:14 - okay so l is a point
585:17 - and it's either here
585:19 - or
585:20 - in the other place
585:22 - i could force it to be one or the other
585:25 - but
585:25 - for now it doesn't i will do it later
585:30 - let's get r also
585:37 - so r is going to be
585:39 - if you know l like if l is this r is
585:42 - going to be the point that is the
585:44 - furthest away from all the other ones
585:47 - so i'm going to go here and say
585:51 - r
585:52 - like that
585:54 - and
585:56 - i copied this
585:59 - with r point
586:02 - and here i'm gonna also add the distance
586:05 - to
586:07 - l
586:08 - white let me write these distance
586:13 - sums one under the other so that it's
586:16 - more visible what is happening here
586:19 - and uh
586:20 - this is gonna be our point
586:35 - okay
586:46 - no
586:47 - it's not good
586:54 - something is not good so first problem
586:57 - is
587:04 - when i'm drawing them this should be r
587:07 - here
587:14 - okay
587:17 - okay
587:19 - so
587:28 - why it doesn't work so i'm having now
587:33 - l here
587:34 - okay and when
587:36 - or
587:36 - l here and when air l is here r is for
587:40 - some reason there
587:44 - next to c
587:46 - because it prefers the distance there so
587:50 - l and n distance to l and distance to n
587:53 - is so far away
587:56 - uh
587:58 - yeah
587:59 - that it's better to be down there than
588:02 - here these will be short and only one
588:04 - long so
588:06 - i think maybe trying instead of a sum
588:10 - doing a product there
588:12 - is going to emphasize that even more
588:16 - so let's see
588:21 - okay so
588:23 - now
588:24 - this system seems to work
588:29 - not big difference in l and r but
588:32 - it is what it is
588:34 - uh with different kind of markers it can
588:37 - be even better and
588:39 - probably if i get closer or let's see
588:41 - later
588:43 - the last one
588:45 - just the same thing again the point that
588:48 - is furthest away from all other points
588:52 - so
588:53 - i'm going to call that
588:56 - b for
588:57 - bottom of the of the mouth
589:01 - let's have
589:02 - b
589:06 - b
589:07 - b
589:09 - b
589:14 - b point
589:19 - b point
589:23 - b b
589:31 - also the distance to r there
589:35 - okay
589:40 - not good
589:50 - not good so
589:57 - yeah again it's better to have a
590:00 - position like that
590:11 - i think what i'm going to do because the
590:13 - chest point here is so low
590:16 - and it's such a big problem either move
590:18 - the point upwards a little bit so if
590:21 - this point here
590:24 - would be
590:32 - no that's not helping much
590:44 - let's put the weight on this chest point
590:49 - make it smaller
591:09 - no that's not the problem the problem is
591:12 - that b is such a great place for being
591:15 - far away from all the other ones
591:18 - so maybe we
591:20 - divide by the distance to the chest
591:23 - point
591:43 - no
591:47 - so i want a point that is
591:54 - far enough from
591:56 - n l and r
591:59 - but if you get too close to that point
592:06 - it's bad
592:08 - uh no
592:09 - i think that i i had this
592:14 - the other way around
592:46 - what if i use here the minimum distance
592:52 - the minimum distance
592:54 - to rl uh
592:57 - n and b
592:59 - so minimum distance
593:01 - if
593:02 - distance is less than the
593:06 - minimum
593:08 - distance
593:10 - then the minimum distance is updated
593:12 - like
593:21 - no
593:22 - because now it's going to choose a point
593:24 - that is it's exactly zero
593:27 - how about
593:28 - with the previous addition from before
593:36 - huh
593:46 - and how about squaring these
593:54 - so squaring the distance
593:56 - these individual distances
594:11 - no why does it go there where
594:24 - oh i'm looking for
594:26 - a minimum distance but this is a very
594:30 - small one to begin with
594:35 - okay now it works i think many of the
594:38 - others would have worked as well
594:42 - too many details to start to explain
594:45 - but
594:46 - basically b is quite close to the center
594:49 - of mass of all the other points so i
594:52 - used it
594:54 - in that way
594:56 - this definition here with the sum of
594:58 - squared distances is it's there now and
595:02 - i can do a check here that if um
595:07 - l point
595:10 - x
595:10 - i mean
595:11 - zero is greater than our point
595:14 - of zero
595:16 - then swap these
595:21 - i think i can do
595:27 - something like this in javascript maybe
595:45 - okay now l r are proper n is proper b is
595:49 - proper c is proper everything is fine
595:52 - but um
595:55 - and of course if i calibrate
595:59 - head still moves like this but the other
596:01 - things are not
596:02 - not appearing anywhere
596:06 - so
596:07 - what will happen next
596:10 - is uh
596:23 - is is
596:28 - let's just put here in the calibration
596:30 - in the reference points i'm going to put
596:32 - also
596:34 - l
596:42 - r and b
596:46 - that's the first thing
596:51 - and now um
596:57 - let's calculate
597:04 - a distance between b and n so b and n
597:11 - it's going to give us a distance for how
597:14 - the mouth is opening so b goes down and
597:18 - and always stays where the nose is i
597:20 - can't move my nose
597:22 - so
597:27 - let's say
597:36 - bn1 is going to be distance
597:41 - from
597:44 - nose to b
597:48 - and bn2 is going to be a distance from
597:53 - uh
597:55 - let's just say here ref is
598:01 - equal to that so that i don't write this
598:04 - everywhere it's just horrible
598:12 - okay so ref
598:14 - knows
598:16 - ref b
598:19 - so
598:21 - b and if
598:23 - y is going to be equal to
598:27 - b n one
598:30 - minus b and two
598:33 - probably like that
598:35 - i
598:37 - i don't want to think about it anymore
598:38 - if it's not one it's going to be the
598:40 - other
598:41 - and this difference is going to be
598:44 - divided by
599:02 - wait
599:16 - d1 let's keep the same logic and see
599:19 - what happens
599:20 - so with this bndiff i'm gonna say update
599:24 - mouth
599:26 - with um
599:36 - value and
599:38 - y
600:23 - okay
600:28 - so
600:29 - let's try calibrate
600:35 - everything broke
600:51 - ref nose and ref b
601:13 - oh
601:16 - the constellation points are missing the
601:19 - other ones
601:29 - okay
601:31 - calibrate
601:38 - opposite
601:39 - so
601:40 - needs to be opposite and needs to be
601:42 - multiplied by something more so i had it
601:45 - right in the first time and let's
601:47 - multiply this by five or something
601:56 - calibrate
602:06 - hello
602:07 - hello
602:08 - hello
602:10 - hi
602:11 - hi hi
602:13 - hi
602:14 - hello i think this can be even
602:19 - six but i'm gonna try with seven
602:25 - hello
602:27 - hello
602:28 - hi hello hello
602:34 - l and r points are not really moving
602:41 - i'm not using them yet but
602:46 - nothing seems to happen at least not yet
602:51 - this fidgeting is what i'm gonna fix
602:53 - next so what i'm gonna do
602:55 - is um
603:01 - i really like it i
603:03 - i did something really great i'm happy
603:06 - with this
603:08 - so um
603:10 - the fidgeting i'm gonna take
603:14 - an average of the points i'm gonna
603:16 - average the points in their neighborhood
603:19 - here
603:23 - somehow
603:30 - and replace
603:32 - lrb and
603:35 - nose and chest
603:36 - with the actual average there so that
603:39 - they don't jump around so much
603:42 - and then this animation will be also
603:44 - smoother on the left it's not good as it
603:46 - is
603:48 - so let's try that
603:51 - next
603:59 - now that we have all of those points
604:01 - there
604:08 - i'm going to go through
604:13 - let's create sets of points that are
604:15 - closer to n to l to b to air and to c
604:19 - so i'm going to call these
604:25 - n set
604:27 - like this
604:30 - c set
604:33 - b
604:34 - set
604:36 - lsat
604:39 - r set
604:41 - and now i'm going to loop
604:46 - through all of the points
604:54 - and i'm going to say
604:59 - to calculate
605:01 - five distances is
605:04 - n this is going to be distance from
605:10 - logs of i to
605:12 - a
605:13 - nose
605:14 - point
605:22 - and the others will be like
605:26 - same
605:29 - c distance
605:31 - b distance
605:32 - l distance r distance
605:36 - and this is gonna be
605:38 - chest
605:40 - point
605:42 - this is gonna be
605:44 - b point
605:47 - l point
605:51 - and r point
605:53 - and now i want to put these in the set
605:56 - where the distance is the minimum
605:59 - so let's
606:01 - get the mean
606:02 - uh
606:04 - is going to be math dot min of endist
606:08 - seedist be this
606:11 - eldest
606:13 - this like that
606:15 - and
606:19 - i'm going to say
606:23 - if
606:31 - mean this
606:33 - is going to be equal to
606:35 - and this then
606:38 - and set push
606:40 - locks of i
606:45 - and else
606:48 - if mindist is
606:50 - seedist
606:52 - then c set is going to be
606:56 - logs of i
606:57 - then b
606:59 - this here
607:02 - b set is going to be log getting logs of
607:06 - i
607:11 - l
607:12 - l set
607:14 - r
607:16 - r set
607:19 - yeah
607:20 - so now i have sets of points
607:22 - for each of those
607:26 - things so these points are going to be
607:27 - nearest to
607:30 - the ones that are marked on with the
607:32 - letters on the camera
607:34 - but um
607:40 - but now i can calculate the average of
607:42 - each of those and replace
607:45 - each of those points like nose point
607:47 - chest point b point and so on so
607:50 - nose point
607:51 - is going to be
607:53 - average of
607:56 - n set
608:01 - chest point
608:08 - b point
608:11 - l point and r point
608:15 - so r set
608:17 - l
608:18 - set b set
608:25 - c set
608:27 - ends
608:31 - might be confusing what i'm doing now
608:33 - but
608:34 - look at the points now and look at this
608:36 - fidgeting on the right
608:38 - and it should be gone when i refresh if
608:40 - i didn't make any errors
608:47 - errors
608:54 - okay
608:55 - chest point
608:56 - is const
609:05 - okay calibrate
609:18 - much more stable
609:19 - so i'm gonna actually have a tutorial
609:22 - someday about this lightsaber effect and
609:26 - i will teach better there what i did
609:28 - here with the averaging so
609:30 - i don't know if it's already out when
609:32 - you're watching this or if it's coming
609:34 - but
609:35 - we did it
609:38 - i i averaged the points and now they
609:40 - became stable because they are not
609:42 - represented anymore by one single point
609:45 - but by many points
609:49 - many points
609:51 - averaged together and
609:53 - they are not fidgeting so much
609:55 - yeah this is great wow i'm really happy
609:58 - with that character moving there
610:01 - when the points are not blocked
610:03 - otherwise it's horrible
610:14 - okay
610:16 - let's try also these side points this
610:22 - l and r
610:24 - maybe they work who knows
610:30 - so
610:34 - i'm gonna copy this code
610:39 - like this and say
610:42 - l r diff with dx
610:47 - lr1
610:50 - lr2
611:01 - lrdf
611:03 - x
611:05 - is gonna be lr1 minus lr2 divided by d1
611:10 - multiplied by something
611:12 - and lr diff
611:16 - x there
611:18 - so let's see
611:22 - calibrate i'm looking straight at the
611:24 - camera
611:30 - hey
611:32 - it kind of works
611:34 - hello
611:35 - hello wow
611:37 - wow this works um how about if you put
611:41 - bigger value here
611:43 - nine
611:45 - not 79.
611:48 - okay calibrate
611:55 - hello
611:56 - hello
611:57 - hello i am raduz avatar
612:00 - hello i'm radus avatar
612:04 - maybe with the mouth it would look even
612:06 - better
612:08 - let's see if i redesign it to have a
612:11 - mouth in the end
612:13 - i think i need a
612:15 - few minutes break and then i have about
612:18 - one and a half
612:20 - hours
612:21 - left to do this so i'm gonna do
612:26 - i'm gonna
612:28 - during my break i think i'm gonna record
612:30 - myself saying something with these
612:32 - things on my face
612:34 - so that i can play with this method
612:37 - also without these things on my face
612:41 - i mean to play with this
612:43 - thing
612:44 - so i will record myself saying something
612:47 - and
612:48 - when we come back
612:49 - uh
612:51 - when i come back
612:53 - i will
612:56 - make this work with the camera or only
612:59 - with the sliders
613:00 - or with the video that i'm going to
613:02 - record
613:04 - and
613:07 - i like it
613:09 - a lot
613:11 - and
613:13 - then fine tuning drawing these to look
613:16 - like hair kind of like in the original
613:18 - drawing
613:20 - and these strings here
613:27 - they are small minor it's much more
613:29 - interesting what happens up here now but
613:31 - i like them
613:33 - great so
613:35 - i will take a 5-10 minutes break and
613:38 - record also something meanwhile
613:42 - okay i'm back and
613:44 - i recorded a short video to test this i
613:48 - don't know if it works yet but i added
613:51 - it here as this
613:53 - mp4
613:54 - file in the folder
613:57 - and i think it's really easy to test
614:00 - here i just have to put
614:03 - something like
614:09 - and before of course it's still gonna
614:11 - initialize the webcam and and do
614:13 - whatever
614:15 - but uh
614:17 - it's
614:18 - gonna replace the data
614:21 - uh from the webcam with the
614:24 - source coming from that video
614:26 - let's see if it works
614:37 - it crashed
614:42 - but um it's talking there something and
614:46 - that's me from the video it crashed
614:48 - because of a
614:50 - course
614:52 - so it's trying to load the file from the
614:55 - computer and uh do some processing with
614:58 - it like image processing and the browser
615:00 - doesn't like that
615:02 - um
615:04 - i think i need to
615:08 - make this into a server
615:10 - so
615:13 - let me go to
615:20 - show the status bar
615:22 - in this visual studio code and i have
615:25 - this live server
615:27 - extension
615:33 - allow
615:34 - access
615:37 - and
615:38 - and and
615:41 - now instead of going to this
615:46 - location i'm just going to put here
615:49 - the localhost
615:51 - ip address and
615:53 - this 5500 port
616:00 - hi i am
616:03 - okay
616:04 - one
616:05 - two
616:06 - three
616:07 - four
616:08 - five
616:09 - six
616:10 - seven
616:12 - eight
616:13 - nine
616:14 - ten there were some problems there
616:19 - with um
616:23 - with some of those things disappearing
616:25 - sometimes
616:28 - but
616:30 - let's
616:32 - refresh and press to calibrate also
616:35 - quickly somehow
616:38 - or i don't know
616:39 - um i want this to actually
616:44 - calibrate here
616:54 - wow every time i'm
616:56 - saving something it's updating there the
616:58 - server works differently
617:03 - testing one
617:05 - two
617:06 - three
617:07 - four
617:08 - five
617:09 - six
617:10 - seven
617:11 - eight
617:12 - nine
617:13 - ten
617:38 - yeah um
617:41 - this calibrate can't be called there yet
617:44 - because the image processing hasn't
617:46 - happened yet
617:47 - so
617:53 - i'm gonna take it out
618:00 - i'm also going to disable the sound here
618:03 - four
618:04 - five
618:05 - six
618:06 - seven eight
618:09 - nine
618:10 - ten
618:14 - hi i am radus avatar
618:16 - testing
618:18 - one
618:18 - two
618:19 - three
618:20 - four five
618:23 - six
618:24 - seven
618:25 - eight
618:27 - hi i am radhu zabatar
618:30 - testing one
618:32 - two
618:33 - three
618:34 - four
618:35 - five
618:36 - six
618:37 - seven
618:38 - eight
618:40 - nine
618:41 - ten
618:43 - not very bad not very bad i like it um
618:47 - let me disable the sound because this is
618:50 - disturbing every time i i change
618:52 - something in the files this is uh
618:55 - updating in the browser and talking
618:59 - i can't concentrate when he's talking
619:01 - when i'm talking there like that
619:04 - some
619:07 - uh
619:19 - maybe that
619:24 - seems to work so the voice is not there
619:27 - anymore so there is some small problem
619:29 - with the
619:31 - mouth here
619:33 - and also
619:35 - here
619:36 - and
619:37 - i wonder if i can
619:41 - hmm
619:49 - work with the different thresholds that
619:52 - are better so that it works for all the
619:55 - cases let's say
619:59 - 195.
620:22 - was it perfect
620:42 - there was a little bit of a jumpiness
620:45 - but not much
620:48 - uh only if you look on the right side
620:51 - then this b was jumping at some point
620:54 - but only a little bit the mouth looked
620:56 - okay i think
621:05 - yeah
621:06 - okay i think this is just good
621:09 - so
621:13 - i have a demo now as well
621:15 - i can put this on my website
621:18 - and show it to the judges later
621:22 - otherwise it's very hard for somebody to
621:24 - test this application of course you
621:26 - could do something with these sliders
621:30 - but
621:34 - it's not as great as when you see it in
621:36 - action and people won't put these things
621:38 - on their face or wouldn't know how to do
621:40 - it unless they see some example like
621:42 - this
621:43 - so i'm happy i did that
621:47 - let's change the input somehow based on
621:50 - if you want to use the sliders or this
621:52 - video or your own webcam
621:55 - so
621:55 - in index.html
621:58 - i'm going to
622:04 - go
622:05 - and say
622:07 - here
622:11 - now where do i want to put this
622:13 - selection for the input
622:16 - um
622:17 - i think the sliders shouldn't even
622:19 - appear
622:26 - so sliders should actually be called
622:29 - side
622:32 - panel
622:38 - and
622:39 - here
622:44 - these are the sliders now
622:54 - and the sliders can be
623:06 - invisible
623:08 - i mean not added to the dom
623:12 - if the video is playing and in the
623:14 - beginning and i want the video to be
623:16 - playing in the beginning
623:18 - but i don't necessarily want the camera
623:21 - access because people don't like to
623:25 - share their cameras and website usually
623:28 - so also the calibrate button not needed
623:32 - if the video is there
623:35 - so
623:52 - okay
623:54 - and
624:00 - now we can add this kind of
624:03 - select
624:04 - component
624:07 - let's call it
624:13 - input
624:16 - and
624:17 - id of input
624:20 - and now i'm gonna give it
624:27 - some options inside so option
624:30 - with the value of
624:33 - video
624:37 - video
624:40 - and
624:42 - then
624:43 - the other ones are just going to be
624:45 - camera and
624:57 - sliders
625:08 - okay
625:09 - great
625:27 - so these will be
625:29 - here it needs a label
625:38 - let's give it also
625:40 - on a new line
625:43 - and
626:00 - okay
626:03 - here
626:41 - okay
626:42 - so
626:43 - inside of this camera.js file
626:47 - i think i'm going to just initialize the
626:49 - video with element here at the top like
626:52 - this
626:55 - and
626:56 - i'm actually gonna
627:00 - copy this
627:02 - here
627:07 - this navigator media devices blah blah
627:10 - blah
627:13 - this should be inside the function
627:14 - called
627:16 - initialize camera
627:20 - and we only call that when we change
627:23 - that selection
627:25 - i think
627:26 - and what will happen then is
627:31 - so by default the page should load the
627:33 - video first
627:48 - okay it wants some kind of a
627:53 - start button or something
627:58 - let's add here
628:13 - or i don't know
628:15 - now it worked
628:18 - so it begins with the video
628:24 - or no maybe it will want us to do that
628:27 - so let's just put here a button that
628:29 - calls
628:31 - a button that says
628:38 - start
628:46 - like this and the start function
628:50 - let's just go to the camera for now and
628:53 - say here
628:57 - start
629:23 - something is wrong there
629:29 - this needs to be here
629:34 - it changes the size already now
629:37 - now start
629:38 - and it begins and i think that it won't
629:41 - complain anymore about
629:43 - problems
629:45 - so
629:47 - it starts that but if we change this to
629:50 - the camera i want to do initialize
629:52 - camera and then i don't want to do this
629:55 - anymore
629:56 - i do want to say that the source object
629:59 - is going to be the data from there
630:11 - or maybe i do want to do this because
630:13 - maybe the
630:16 - yeah
630:16 - i'm gonna create a new video i'm gonna
630:19 - set its
630:21 - source object like that
630:23 - not like this
630:31 - because the camera your camera might be
630:33 - different than my camera when i recorded
630:36 - the video and so on
630:38 - so
630:39 - yeah
630:42 - so this start here should be start
630:48 - video maybe let's see
630:51 - so when i refresh and i press start this
630:54 - is going to start
630:56 - and
630:58 - it's great i like it
631:00 - and
631:02 - when i change to camera or sliders some
631:05 - things should happen so
631:07 - let's make here an unchanged
632:03 - okay so here we have camera sliders
632:06 - video
632:07 - and
632:08 - switch
632:10 - info dot value
632:13 - if we have
632:14 - video
632:21 - then what happens
632:22 - um
632:24 - let me close many of these things from
632:26 - here
632:28 - so
632:38 - i think i want to have this one like
632:40 - that
632:47 - and i actually
632:49 - think i it should be
632:51 - re-initialized here so let's just have
632:54 - it null in the beginning
632:56 - re-initializing it like that
633:00 - this volume
633:02 - i should remember to put it back to
633:04 - maximum
633:12 - start
633:14 - break
633:15 - and now if this is a camera
633:24 - then
633:25 - we are gonna do
633:26 - initialize camera
633:41 - okay
633:48 - so start the video
633:50 - video starts
633:52 - if i change this to camera
634:02 - it works but
634:05 - i think i'm in different positions and
634:07 - it's not calibrated or something
634:15 - video is great
634:25 - yeah something is wrong i oh this
634:28 - headset was making some bad
634:32 - colors i think
634:38 - okay
634:39 - now it's good
634:41 - so video seems to work
634:43 - it starts it's doing some different
634:45 - things there
634:46 - camera
634:49 - okay let's put also the video with the
634:52 - volume to one i'm
634:54 - i mean
634:55 - hide this
634:56 - because i wonder if the video plays in
634:58 - the background
635:18 - so the video is playing in the
635:19 - background and i think we should do
635:22 - video stop
635:25 - before
635:26 - starting something else
635:36 - if possible
635:57 - testing one
635:59 - two
636:00 - three
636:01 - four
636:02 - five
636:04 - seven
636:05 - eight
636:06 - nine
636:07 - ten
636:13 - hi i am
636:16 - testing
636:19 - okay
636:27 - i want to start in the beginning to just
636:29 - start the video without the option to
636:31 - give the input
636:33 - so i'm gonna
636:35 - remove the input from there
636:40 - just in the beginning so i'm gonna say
636:43 - here
636:48 - input display none
636:54 - input
636:55 - container
636:57 - display none
636:59 - and the input container will be inside
637:01 - of this thing
637:02 - so
637:15 - okay and these line breaks i think
637:18 - should be also inside there
637:21 - more line breaks here maybe inside this
637:24 - video output
637:33 - okay so now you just have the option to
637:36 - press start there
637:38 - hi i am
637:41 - testing one
637:43 - 2
637:44 - 3
637:45 - 4
637:46 - 5
637:47 - 6
637:48 - 7
637:49 - 8
637:50 - 9
637:51 - 10.
637:54 - so when we press the start
638:08 - i'm gonna make this input
638:17 - up here
638:29 - and this start button should disappear
638:32 - because we don't need to press
638:34 - start anymore i think
639:04 - okay
639:05 - so now we have the video we change to
639:07 - the camera
639:11 - calibrate button should be there with
639:13 - the camera
639:14 - so
639:17 - we need that
639:19 - everybody's going to have different
639:21 - markers on their face and if they ever
639:23 - try this
639:25 - i will
639:26 - so calibrate button
640:00 - no need to calibrate with the video it's
640:02 - just confusing it
640:06 - does the calibration it should do the
640:10 - calibration automatically let's put here
640:15 - on the first frame
640:20 - so auto calibrate set to true
640:42 - so on the first frame
640:45 - when there is no constellation points
640:48 - there
640:50 - we calibrate
640:59 - yes
641:21 - yeah i think this is good
641:23 - um
641:33 - but i don't want auto calibration for
641:35 - the camera because
641:38 - people need to see themselves first
641:52 - so now it doesn't work but if i press
641:55 - calibrate
641:59 - hello
642:00 - hey
642:01 - hello
642:02 - hello
642:04 - la la la la la la
642:06 - [Laughter]
642:12 - oh
642:15 - something was happening with this point
642:18 - okay this is very funny
642:22 - uh come on a little more energy i need
642:26 - more energy
642:47 - video
642:50 - yeah it starts well and it auto
642:52 - calibrates itself on the first frame
642:54 - there
643:08 - camera
643:12 - calibrate
643:19 - hello hahaha
643:21 - great
643:22 - and the sliders doesn't do anything yet
643:37 - let's put this to be
643:41 - initialize video
643:43 - initialize camera initialize sliders
643:46 - and now in the beginning the
643:49 - start button is going to be
643:51 - initialize video
643:54 - [Music]
643:56 - yeah
643:58 - and the sliders
644:02 - here so
644:16 - right
644:22 - so initialize sliders
644:26 - this should be in something like a
644:27 - control panel let's make
644:33 - control panel js and just move some
644:38 - functions there
644:53 - like that
644:55 - and from here
645:09 - so they initialize sliders it's going to
645:11 - be something like
645:14 - like what
645:16 - we have the sliders here that need to be
645:18 - turned on
645:20 - we want the video output to be turned
645:22 - off
645:26 - so
645:29 - sliders with output
645:47 - i'm getting some messages
645:50 - i have to check
646:18 - yeah
646:19 - okay
646:20 - so the output none
646:24 - and
646:25 - make sure that the sliders are off in
646:28 - both of those cases
646:37 - so start the video
646:39 - then they can change the camera for
646:41 - example but nothing but really will
646:44 - really happen here unless they do
646:45 - something serious like this
646:48 - um
646:51 - what happens if they press calibrate now
647:07 - so somehow with a
647:09 - marker like this
647:14 - funny things happen
647:17 - very funny things happen you really need
647:19 - to have
647:20 - points on your face like i have
647:24 - and then it works
647:27 - okay
647:28 - sliders
647:32 - okay
647:33 - uh
647:35 - no not okay
647:38 - the video needs
647:40 - to be not
647:41 - active anymore
647:43 - [Music]
647:48 - maybe this video pause is enough
647:56 - and
647:59 - constellation points has to be set to
648:03 - nothing
648:07 - let's see if now it's different
648:10 - so video is there
648:14 - camera is there calibrate
648:22 - okay
648:40 - for me
648:41 - seems to work i want a
648:44 - line break between the after the sliders
649:05 - why don't they work
649:20 - i think the video is still there
649:23 - so in the camera we have process image
649:26 - this is going to happen all the time
649:34 - here
649:36 - video
649:37 - it needs to be
649:40 - put to null we need to put it to null
649:43 - here
649:51 - that will make the sliders activate
649:59 - yes
650:03 - okay great um
650:11 - but now we are gonna work with this
650:13 - video i think and maybe with the camera
650:16 - if these things still stay on my face
650:23 - calibrate
650:29 - would be good to have some kind of
650:33 - some kind of
650:35 - instructions here what to do
650:39 - maybe
650:57 - start is not defined oh
651:48 - where's the video
652:16 - getting tired
652:20 - this is some common behavior it should
652:22 - be
652:23 - grouped together
652:35 - calibrate below the camera i think below
652:38 - the input i'm gonna
652:41 - move that button there
652:44 - it's better like that
653:17 - okay good
653:19 - we have something
653:22 - we have something that works here
653:25 - and even with this video i like it
653:29 - problem now is just that
653:32 - uh
653:36 - these styles are horrible this hair
653:38 - needs to look like hair
653:42 - and i
653:44 - still need some energy and i don't know
653:46 - how to get it
653:48 - but uh
653:50 - come on it's a little bit more effort
653:58 - [Music]
654:08 - [Applause]
654:12 - i think
654:19 - i can do something
654:21 - [Applause]
654:22 - maybe
655:04 - i like the hair
655:05 - i really like the hair
655:07 - what's wrong with this c now it's
655:11 - getting color from the
655:13 - it's getting glare from the light
655:21 - i don't think i can do much about the
655:23 - lights to make it better but
655:26 - this is really great i'm really happy
655:29 - with
655:30 - what i have done
655:31 - and for the hair
655:39 - let's do this
655:44 - so
655:55 - i want to connect now this point to this
655:58 - point
656:13 - may be influenced by this point
656:26 - let's do that so
656:28 - move to here
656:33 - line to here curve to
656:36 - this place and see what happens
656:40 - so inside of the avatar
656:46 - actually in the hair
656:48 - okay head is something that is empty
656:52 - i don't think we use head anywhere
656:57 - i remove this head now
657:04 - so here uh
657:10 - not in the hair but
657:11 - inside avatar because this is where we
657:13 - define these
657:15 - front hairs
657:17 - so what i'm gonna do now is
657:25 - here where we are drawing
657:28 - that's not gonna be
657:29 - used anymore at the end
657:32 - um
657:35 - and i'm gonna
657:36 - say
657:40 - draw
657:41 - front
657:42 - hair a function on the
657:47 - ctx
657:50 - actually a method here
658:00 - draw front here like this
658:03 - and i would say
658:06 - begin path
658:09 - move to
658:12 - this front hair
658:16 - of
658:18 - zero
658:20 - so this is going to be now
658:23 - the first pendulum
658:29 - particles of zero
658:39 - and these are
658:41 - arrays so i can
658:43 - do
658:44 - spreading here
659:25 - location
659:35 - okay
659:36 - and
659:37 - line two
659:40 - particle 2 location so this is gonna
659:44 - draw
659:46 - a line let's make ctx stroke and let's
659:49 - make this one
659:58 - yellow
660:01 - so this line right here that you can see
660:03 - in yellow
660:06 - here
660:08 - so now let's try ctx
660:12 - quadratic
660:14 - curve
660:16 - two
660:19 - and it's gonna go to
660:26 - the second hair
660:28 - the base of the
660:30 - second hair
660:34 - with the second hair
660:37 - control point from
660:39 - the middle
660:43 - yes and here
660:46 - comma
660:48 - so this is what i'm getting
660:52 - now
660:54 - my drawing here okay it's kind of like
660:56 - in reverse actually
660:58 - the
660:59 - curves are in reverse here
661:02 - mm-hmm
661:06 - so i should use this as the control
661:09 - point
661:11 - uh
661:11 - no problem
661:21 - okay something like that
661:27 - and i will do the same thing
661:32 - for the other
661:34 - one
661:48 - hmm
661:57 - looks nice
662:01 - i would like to have another hair
662:03 - somewhere on the left here that i won't
662:06 - draw but
662:08 - it will affect this other hair and the
662:11 - other things
662:17 - so let's actually do that have another
662:20 - pendulum
662:21 - in
662:22 - even more to the left here like
662:26 - three two
662:29 - oh this is the back here
662:40 - okay that's good
662:42 - or even 41.
662:44 - it doesn't matter if it's outside
662:47 - so what i will do now is uh
662:51 - that here
662:52 - strand here is not going to be
662:55 - drawn so
662:57 - i'm gonna
662:58 - go it's just gonna influence the others
663:01 - it's crazy
663:04 - uh
663:04 - what i'm doing
663:06 - so then i'm actually gonna start at the
663:09 - first hair here
663:13 - and
663:18 - continue to do as previously but now
663:21 - instead of this line 2 i would like to
663:24 - have it influenced by this point
663:28 - so this is not straight anymore so i'm
663:31 - going to
663:32 - replace that line too with another
663:36 - quadratic curve
663:39 - and
663:42 - end
663:43 - location will be that
663:46 - but
663:47 - this will be
663:48 - that
663:50 - what
663:54 - no line to
663:57 - yeah yeah this is what i want
664:01 - that's what i want
664:03 - okay
664:04 - so now that i'm here i'm gonna
664:06 - repeat the same thing
664:22 - but
664:32 - here i'm gonna have one here i'm gonna
664:35 - have two
664:36 - here i'm gonna have two and here i'm
664:38 - gonna have three
664:40 - i like that great
664:41 - and uh
664:43 - now
664:46 - i really feel like i want this to be
664:48 - more in the middle more on the left
664:52 - so this is now
664:54 - front here of three
664:56 - zero one two three
664:59 - maybe
665:02 - yeah
665:05 - and
665:06 - maybe this also a little bit to the left
665:09 - actually this one also a little bit to
665:11 - the top
665:17 - and the next one a little bit to the
665:19 - left
665:24 - and i would like
665:26 - actually the first one
665:28 - to be even more to the left
665:31 - but i don't care that it's outside like
665:33 - that
665:35 - and
665:36 - maybe even more
665:38 - and the first one here
665:40 - maybe 31
665:43 - okay and i will need another one at the
665:46 - end
665:47 - so
665:51 - like that for the influence of this last
665:54 - strand so now i'm going to do a little
665:56 - bit of things in reverse it's going to
665:58 - change the direction
666:01 - let's add one more strand there
666:05 - two on the left and three on the
666:08 - right
666:10 - i want there are too many here in this
666:12 - original one i don't want to waste time
666:14 - on that now
666:16 - so uh
666:18 - i want one more strand so let's
666:21 - group these
666:22 - more
666:29 - so this goes even more to the left maybe
666:32 - 1 5
666:37 - 28
666:40 - and another one here
666:44 - thirty
666:48 - two
666:49 - no
666:51 - forty
666:55 - [Music]
666:58 - 37
667:00 - 26
667:04 - 13.
667:05 - something like that
667:07 - so now going back to this place
667:10 - let's do
667:14 - third here
667:33 - so from here we are actually gonna go
667:36 - influenced by
667:45 - four maybe
667:52 - this is now three and this is four
667:57 - now
667:59 - this is five
668:01 - no this is four
668:04 - this is
668:07 - five
668:27 - yeah
668:28 - okay now i got it
668:31 - okay so now i have the third hair
668:34 - and
668:37 - fourth hair
668:52 - five five
668:53 - six
668:54 - five
668:59 - okay
669:07 - fifth hair
669:11 - six six
669:14 - seven
669:15 - six
669:23 - something is not good
669:42 - yeah the point that i'm using to
669:44 - influence here i think this should be
669:47 - four
669:49 - now
670:08 - no we're done we are done i forgot the
670:11 - last one is just
670:12 - to guide guide the things
670:16 - so now that we have done all those
670:18 - all these things
670:20 - i think all i need to do is um
670:25 - fill
670:26 - not stroke
670:44 - okay
670:45 - and probably i want one more
670:48 - line too and i'm gonna go in this middle
670:51 - point right here
670:56 - so that i will cover part of this bold
670:59 - area
671:04 - maybe that's enough let's see so
671:06 - zero one two three
671:09 - align to
671:10 - [Music]
671:17 - three particles of zero location
671:25 - maybe it's enough i hope
671:27 - and now
671:28 - i don't want to draw
671:31 - these
671:32 - anymore
671:37 - oh boy i look
671:39 - bold
671:41 - i
671:41 - i think that's maybe a sign that i'm
671:43 - becoming bold
671:46 - uh
671:47 - it's fine
671:51 - yeah
671:52 - uh let's see how it looks like
671:54 - with the video
672:10 - nice
672:11 - okay
672:14 - let's put the sliders on
672:31 - okay
672:32 - it's pretty okay
672:35 - uh let me add back the
672:42 - stroke and
672:45 - i think this one is just too
672:47 - much to the right
672:50 - so
672:59 - and this one
673:04 - yeah like that
673:05 - now when i'm actually drawing the hair
673:10 - i could move this point
673:12 - lower so that i don't look so bold let's
673:15 - see
673:16 - draw half here
673:18 - topmost point okay
673:21 - but um
673:29 - what was this point here
673:35 - i don't know
673:40 - i think it's something on the side
673:46 - the control point probably it's that one
673:49 - or the outer one
673:52 - right most point okay probably that one
674:04 - wow i look so cool i don't know how i
674:07 - did that
674:13 - i like it
674:15 - but i don't look like that
674:17 - so it wasn't that point
674:20 - i think it's
674:21 - this point right here
674:23 - so
674:43 - okay
674:44 - and let's disable now that
674:49 - stroke from here the yellow line that i
674:51 - don't want to see anymore
674:58 - i think these control points here need
675:00 - to be
675:02 - i don't have hair that goes like that in
675:04 - the
675:05 - down there
675:08 - yeah so this control point needs to be a
675:11 - little bit lower
675:27 - not that i think here i need
675:35 - no
675:37 - this is the outer control point okay
675:40 - uh
675:42 - oh yeah yeah yeah this one
675:56 - it's okay
676:01 - it's okay
676:37 - i think the hair can be lower
676:42 - the front hair can be lower
677:09 - yeah
677:10 - i like this it's better
677:12 - it could have few more hairs i think but
677:15 - it's not bad
677:17 - it's not bad at all
677:34 - hello
677:35 - hello
677:36 - hey
677:49 - i think that the initial video is so
677:51 - boring compared to what you can make it
677:53 - do
677:57 - let's
677:58 - i i want to do the
678:00 - hair in the back as well
678:10 - and then these front things
678:14 - so for the hair on the back i'm gonna do
678:16 - similar tricks
678:18 - and
678:20 - i also want to have another one on the
678:22 - left somewhere that is
678:24 - outside the screen
678:31 - or actually this might still be in the
678:34 - screen
678:41 - maybe something like that let's see
678:47 - and a last one
678:54 - okay
679:01 - yeah maybe it's gonna be good
679:03 - so i'm gonna do the same thing for
679:07 - draw
679:09 - back
679:11 - here
679:17 - so this
679:18 - draw front here
679:26 - does it have the same number of three
679:28 - four five six seven eight one two three
679:31 - four five six seven
679:34 - it's almost the same
679:36 - but
679:39 - without the last one
679:50 - this could be made definitely with the
679:52 - loop and i wouldn't have to reuse that
679:54 - but
679:55 - somehow
679:57 - i
679:58 - like that i could style them
680:00 - individually and if you would like one
680:02 - of them to be a little bit different you
680:04 - have control like this
680:06 - so
680:07 - i know this code could be
680:10 - half this size but uh
680:13 - i prefer to have this kind of
680:17 - [Music]
680:19 - control here
680:22 - so now this front here
680:26 - will be replaced with the back here
680:30 - everywhere here so let's just do
680:55 - okay something is happening
680:57 - but uh
680:59 - the drawing of the back here is now
681:02 - on the front and i want it to be here
681:06 - and okay
681:10 - nice
681:15 - um
681:50 - okay
681:51 - uh
681:53 - needs to be bigger
681:55 - needs to be bigger you don't see it well
681:58 - enough so let me put here
682:02 - nine nine nine
682:04 - nine nine
682:07 - nine
682:09 - okay
682:10 - and these ones on the side i think they
682:12 - can be even more so
682:16 - five and six
682:26 - maybe
682:28 - and these ones
682:46 - not bad
682:52 - oh
682:57 - this is bad
683:06 - so
683:11 - i think the top part
683:13 - of these can be
683:18 - lower
683:40 - hmm
683:45 - too much
683:46 - 85
683:50 - 85
683:52 - 80.
684:14 - and i think that
684:16 - something is wrong here
684:19 - i don't want it to move
684:21 - maybe that much up and down
684:25 - i don't know
684:28 - somehow moving too much up and down
684:55 - yeah i think i will just move
684:58 - the outsides a little bit more in let's
685:01 - say this is now
685:03 - 55 and this is 55
685:07 - and
685:09 - this can be 38 and
685:13 - 39
685:16 - and i think that now shouldn't be the
685:18 - problems anymore
685:22 - they're okay
685:27 - but uh that gravity thing
685:30 - i think it's too much i want to see it
685:32 - moving more so the gravity multiplier
685:40 - not there
685:45 - where is the multiplier
686:17 - where am i calling that
686:24 - oh in the double pendulum
686:30 - oh yeah this update 2 method
686:39 - this is the kind of thing that you
686:41 - really forget
686:42 - what it's doing
686:44 - after some time
686:48 - okay and i want the sides of the hair
686:51 - here to be closer to the other one so
686:55 - 23
687:01 - twenty
687:04 - no
687:05 - twenty eight
687:12 - no
687:14 - not the front here
687:19 - back here
687:30 - okay that one
687:32 - oh
687:34 - the side hairs are
687:37 - too long now
688:03 - these don't really matter
688:08 - okay
689:46 - [Music]
689:48 - these ones are too far to the side
689:55 - i like this shape more
690:12 - these movements are just way too much
690:15 - so
690:16 - i think that what i want to do here is
690:20 - put more emphasis on
690:29 - initial location
690:49 - why
690:56 - oh no something is horribly wrong
691:01 - this one maybe doesn't need that
691:07 - okay
691:17 - mm-hmm
691:39 - okay
691:43 - i want to move this point a little bit
691:45 - to the left so
692:03 - no
692:04 - minus 36
692:06 - and
692:08 - 36.
692:25 - it's a little funny
692:28 - i think that these sliders are just too
692:31 - much
692:33 - allowing too much freedom i'm gonna
692:36 - put them even less because in the real
692:39 - movement this never happens so i'm gonna
692:41 - put here minus
692:45 - three
692:46 - on the y
692:48 - plus three on the y
692:58 - uh huh
693:04 - and uh maybe even
693:06 - two
693:07 - two
693:08 - and uh the step is gonna be
693:13 - zero five
693:28 - okay and i think this hair can be a
693:31 - little bit more to the right
693:36 - they are too close now
693:38 - so let me go
693:41 - back to the avatar and
693:44 - try again
693:46 - 20 here
693:49 - 25.
694:02 - okay
694:08 - nice
694:09 - so
694:10 - one thing that could be tried is
694:13 - actually
694:15 - add one more hair on the front to
694:17 - partially cover the years i think that
694:20 - would be a great effect
694:23 - uh i'm gonna still try to do that
694:31 - and also limit this x a little bit i
694:34 - think that
694:36 - minus 0.4 and plus 0.4 is just enough
694:43 - i mean
694:44 - i'm cheating here not doing a real 3d
694:47 - and
694:48 - it can show
694:50 - if i'm not paying attention
694:53 - and of course people will notice it's
694:55 - it's obviously a 2d animation there
694:59 - and i think here it's just too much
695:03 - movement still so
695:06 - let me
695:11 - or it's fine okay
695:14 - i'm gonna try also something with the
695:17 - front here
695:19 - maybe i call it side hair
695:28 - let's say side hair
695:30 - and um
695:42 - left
695:43 - i'm just gonna copy these things
695:48 - i need just three pendulums the one in
695:50 - the middle is gonna do the actual
695:53 - drawing
695:54 - so this side here left
695:58 - uh
696:06 - update
696:08 - and
696:09 - draw
696:11 - yeah so just copying the one that we had
696:14 - previously
696:16 - and
696:18 - draw
696:18 - side here
696:29 - left
696:31 - my this needs to be extracted into its
696:34 - own function
696:38 - and done some loop there
696:41 - i'm too tired now
696:44 - and it's gonna stay like this
696:48 - so
696:49 - [Music]
696:52 - let's see if i have energy at some point
696:54 - to fix the code
697:02 - so
697:04 - this is actually all we need there
697:14 - yeah this is the side here
697:17 - but now we need to tweak it a bit
697:23 - so
697:24 - the side here on the left
697:30 - this point here
697:52 - okay i'm i have to comment out this
697:55 - front hair and this back hair it's
697:57 - confusing too much
697:59 - so why is it like that
698:01 - side hair left
698:04 - and also
698:07 - these many things i don't want them
698:09 - anymore
698:12 - yeah
698:13 - so
698:16 - okay it's good but these things need to
698:19 - be more to the left
698:20 - i think
698:25 - yeah let's put six here four here
698:38 - something like that maybe
698:55 - and up more up
699:10 - okay something like that
699:12 - so how does this look like with the
699:14 - sliders
699:18 - nice almost nice
699:21 - too much to the left here
699:24 - let's just put it so that
699:28 - it's 50
699:29 - 40 to
699:32 - 31
699:39 - okay
699:50 - hmm
700:21 - okay that's good i think
700:26 - okay
700:27 - so
700:29 - i think we can do another one
700:38 - on the other side
700:43 - i'm just gonna put positive signs here
700:46 - and hope for the best
700:49 - side hair right
700:52 - let's reactivate the back here
700:55 - uh i'm gonna draw these if debug
701:13 - front here
701:16 - if debug
701:25 - and
701:30 - side hair
701:32 - right
701:37 - probably would have been much better to
701:40 - write loops there
701:49 - at least here i'm going to make draw
701:51 - side here
701:53 - function and here i'm going to say
701:59 - side hair
702:01 - left
702:02 - and
702:04 - i mean draw a side hair method
702:07 - and write
702:18 - just
702:19 - object so
702:22 - i will replace
702:24 - this with the
702:25 - argument and i don't need to copy those
702:29 - i just can't concentrate anymore so it
702:32 - has to be like that
702:34 - okay
702:35 - better maybe
702:36 - let's put debug to false
702:50 - oh
702:51 - not like that
702:54 - okay so those things are not visible
702:57 - there and
703:10 - i like it it's much more personal this
703:13 - way
703:15 - let's see calibrate
703:21 - yeah
703:22 - yeah
703:24 - great i really like it
703:26 - very nice
703:28 - very nice
703:31 - okay
703:33 - so these things
703:35 - uh
703:37 - it's the last thing
703:38 - and then i'm gonna take a break do
703:40 - something else and come back in uh
703:44 - maybe half hour or so and
703:50 - see whatever quick polishing i can still
703:52 - do
703:55 - and i'm done with this so it was amazing
703:58 - okay these things
704:14 - i will make an option for the debug
704:17 - there
704:28 - oh yeah the horrible nose
704:40 - i forgot it's so horrible
704:53 - i don't need these
704:55 - click listeners anymore
705:12 - why should i remove this
705:17 - probably it means this alpha thing
705:20 - i don't need the image anymore
705:25 - the reference image
705:29 - yes
705:30 - i can actually delete it from the
705:32 - project here
705:40 - and in the beginning i'm loading it
705:42 - somewhere
705:43 - image image
705:45 - no need for image and i just need to
705:48 - animate
705:53 - yeah
705:54 - good
705:58 - fantastic
705:59 - it's so great
706:01 - why don't people do this
706:07 - it's awesome
706:11 - awesome
706:13 - and now i'm thinking about that project
706:15 - that we cut off the list with the
706:20 - scanning website that scans your body
706:22 - and so on it's not very complicated to
706:24 - actually change this so that
706:27 - you would do some face
706:30 - profiling like how big are somebody's
706:32 - eyebrows and what is the skin color and
706:36 - i don't know things like that how far
706:39 - apart the eyes are the big the nose is
706:42 - and so on and then with that you could
706:44 - change this avatar
706:47 - automatically so
706:50 - of course that one probably meant
706:52 - something different like that the actual
706:54 - textures and you
706:56 - the
706:57 - avatar you're making is pretty much
707:00 - looking like you
707:01 - but this is
707:02 - in my opinion much better it's much more
707:04 - creative
707:11 - yeah okay those things i want to get
707:14 - them done and then
707:16 - i need to do something for
707:19 - half an hour and then final
707:22 - find fine tuning
707:25 - probably debug button here if i if
707:28 - people want to see what is happening
707:30 - behind the scenes
707:43 - right
707:44 - [Music]
709:04 - i said i'm doing those threads on the
709:06 - shirt but i'm doing something else i'm
709:08 - just cleaning up some of this code
710:16 - okay much better
710:19 - structure here
710:30 - that thing
710:32 - avatar
710:34 - uh
710:42 - okay five minutes
710:44 - avatar
710:57 - left string and right string so
711:01 - update and draw so i don't want to draw
711:04 - them
711:05 - like this
711:06 - i want to say
711:14 - ctx
711:20 - begin
711:21 - path
711:24 - ctx
711:25 - field style
711:27 - and i'm going to do an rgba
711:30 - black with some transparency
711:34 - like that
711:35 - and probably
711:38 - same for a stroke
711:40 - style so what i want to do here is get
711:44 - um
711:46 - draw this as a circle
711:49 - which is a dark transparent and i don't
711:52 - need to define new colors
711:56 - uh
712:04 - pendulum
712:07 - init location
712:18 - x
712:24 - y
712:27 - a radius of something
712:33 - full circle
712:37 - and
712:38 - no more drawing this left
712:42 - left string like that
712:47 - and the ctx fill
712:50 - ctx stroke
712:54 - too big
713:00 - great
713:08 - i would really like to do these ellipses
713:11 - it's so easy to do but
713:14 - no time now
713:18 - circles are just too perfect eyes as
713:20 - well
713:21 - at least a little bit
713:23 - oval-ish it's enough to make it so much
713:26 - more organic
713:28 - so
713:30 - okay
713:37 - this
713:38 - this
713:42 - that
713:56 - okay both of these are there
713:59 - and now
714:00 - um
714:03 - just a line too
714:45 - something like that
714:47 - but
714:49 - thicker
715:04 - i don't like that they're so straight
715:09 - i'm gonna
715:10 - do a quadratic
715:18 - curve to
715:20 - [Music]
715:22 - going there
715:27 - but
715:33 - somehow
715:52 - somehow i want the point here
715:58 - anywhere really
716:05 - yeah
716:06 - um
716:41 - that's fine
716:43 - and um
716:56 - same here
717:08 - but the
717:09 - other side
717:16 - okay
717:27 - somehow i would like the body to
717:31 - move a bit more
717:50 - and these things to move more
717:56 - it's just too small movement i think for
717:59 - them to be picked up
718:15 - yeah
718:16 - so maybe in the physics i'm gonna put
718:19 - the
718:24 - gravity less
718:37 - no
718:38 - no that's just fine they wouldn't swing
718:42 - that much anyway
718:43 - and again this is some kind of
718:46 - very small
718:49 - thing that i wanted there
718:52 - no need to worry about so what i do want
718:55 - to do is have this curvature a little
718:57 - bit different so
719:00 - plus
719:03 - three
719:05 - it's good and i want the thickness to be
719:07 - more
719:11 - ctx line width
719:25 - uh
719:58 - okay now they look better
720:02 - right
720:11 - way too much movement on the side i
720:13 - don't like it i think it was
720:19 - i find
720:20 - more fine like that it needs to be
720:22 - subtle i think it's the head that it's
720:24 - doing the movement
720:26 - and the side just a little bit
720:28 - difference there
720:30 - okay
720:32 - one more test with the camera
720:35 - calibrating
720:48 - hello
720:49 - [Music]
720:51 - is this good
720:54 - should i do more
720:58 - great
720:58 - [Laughter]
721:01 - okay wow something crazy is happening
721:04 - gwen
721:06 - when not all points are recognized
721:09 - wow this is fantastic i'm so happy i did
721:13 - this
721:24 - okay i'll take a
721:26 - break and then
721:28 - really wrap up all this page and and
721:31 - that's it
721:35 - i'm back
721:36 - so
721:37 - i still want to do a couple of things
721:40 - um
721:42 - add a debug
721:44 - option
721:46 - so that
721:48 - for example when this video starts here
721:51 - um
721:54 - you don't see those things there
722:00 - actually those need to be added
722:02 - somewhere
722:03 - um
722:06 - let me see
722:07 - this draw point so this is
722:10 - if debug like that
722:13 - it's
722:14 - easy to do that part
722:17 - but
722:24 - um yeah
722:26 - um but i want to have an option there
722:30 - so
722:32 - i need to use a
722:35 - kind of a checkbox maybe
722:40 - so
722:41 - let's put
722:52 - input
722:53 - type
722:58 - checkbox
723:06 - okay and let's write here
723:10 - debug
723:19 - like this
723:21 - and
723:27 - yes
723:42 - and give it an id
723:49 - debug check like this
723:52 - so
723:54 - our debug value
724:10 - no no no
724:11 - i don't want it
724:13 - it was fine like that
724:15 - so on
724:17 - change
724:20 - toggle debug
724:23 - this
724:24 - and what will
724:26 - happen now is that
724:50 - okay so i compare it like that so i say
724:54 - if this is
724:57 - it was true or false so debug is equal
725:00 - to
725:01 - that
725:07 - and it doesn't need to be a constant
725:09 - anymore
725:14 - so now there are a lot of points there
725:16 - being visible
725:20 - points in the video also
725:26 - like control points
725:32 - yes
725:33 - but this jumps way too much somehow uh
725:56 - yes
726:11 - i think i just put this one at the very
726:14 - top to avoid these kind of nasty
726:17 - issues
726:32 - okay
726:34 - camera
726:36 - calibrate
726:40 - what
726:44 - what is happening i need to see with the
726:47 - debugging oh the headset is on
726:51 - it's uh confusing it has some kind of
726:55 - parts that reflect blue light
727:02 - yeah
727:03 - awesome
727:04 - i like it
727:06 - what happened
727:08 - what happened
727:10 - i didn't see what happened that
727:12 - debugging was ah this
727:18 - it's pointing upwards and the light is
727:20 - reflecting
727:24 - okay
727:26 - okay yeah great no debug
727:30 - awesome
727:34 - great
727:35 - okay
727:36 - uh
727:37 - video
727:41 - this needs the sound to be on
727:44 - let's remove also these debugging
727:46 - statements
727:58 - does that happen in the camera
728:07 - no
728:09 - index no we were in index how
728:13 - where is this coming from control panel
728:16 - oh okay i forgot we did that
728:20 - i don't need that value anymore
728:23 - put volume on
728:27 - i mean we don't need this anymore so the
728:29 - video does have volume
728:32 - let's
728:33 - check it out
728:36 - hi i am
728:39 - testing one
728:41 - two
728:42 - three
728:43 - four
728:44 - five
728:45 - six
728:46 - seven
728:47 - eight
728:48 - nine
728:49 - ten
728:59 - great
729:00 - okay
729:01 - the nose i still have a bit of energy
729:04 - and time left
729:06 - maybe 30 minutes max
729:09 - so
729:10 - let's try the nose
729:12 - [Music]
729:18 - nose
729:26 - so i think that the tip there
729:37 - i think we can do two curves one on each
729:40 - side somehow
729:42 - yeah
729:43 - so
729:46 - let me
729:47 - adjust this a bit
729:49 - so
729:50 - somehow the nose would look
729:53 - more
729:54 - 3d-ish more roundish
729:58 - so i'm gonna
729:59 - move to this is the top part i guess and
730:03 - then there is the bottom part
730:08 - yeah
730:09 - so
730:11 - this
730:12 - i want to say
730:14 - minus 0.1
730:18 - now
730:20 - 0
730:21 - three
730:24 - okay
730:26 - and um
730:27 - [Music]
730:34 - tip left so left tip tip l
730:40 - like that
730:41 - and another one on the right
730:44 - with
730:47 - plus that
730:49 - so this is going i remove this thing
730:53 - oh yeah two control points it was also
730:56 - some idea
730:57 - let's see
730:59 - so with the
731:00 - this one i'm gonna
731:03 - do another
731:07 - with the right
731:09 - but i'm going to go back to this stop
731:11 - point here
731:38 - like that
731:45 - not great but
731:48 - let's see
731:49 - so now uh
731:51 - let's see how it looks like with the
731:54 - sliders
731:59 - huge nose there
732:09 - i think
732:14 - this can be one
732:23 - yeah so now this other line
732:26 - will depend on this offset i'm going to
732:29 - make it transparent
732:31 - so it's not important anymore because
732:34 - the noise is defined by the outside line
732:38 - so
732:46 - the more
732:47 - the line is on the outside
732:51 - the more visibility it has so let's try
732:55 - something like
732:58 - ctx global alpha
733:02 - ref.x offset
733:07 - and
733:11 - stroke
733:49 - actually
733:50 - i want to keep this top point there and
733:54 - let's just put this bottom point also
734:02 - 0 and 0 33
734:46 - um
734:47 - actually i want this formula
734:59 - hi i am
735:32 - hi i am
736:14 - hi
736:34 - yeah i can't really explain what i'm
736:36 - doing anymore
736:52 - hi
737:18 - hi
738:06 - hi i am
738:19 - oh
738:37 - what is happening here
738:40 - this is a number but this is some weird
738:42 - thing
738:45 - it's concatenating here some string
739:01 - i don't know why it's doing that
739:07 - hi i am
739:23 - what is happening
739:35 - i don't know but i think that if i'm
739:37 - gonna
739:40 - change this to do first the
739:54 - audition hi hi
740:08 - hi i am
740:19 - no
740:35 - hi i am
740:55 - hi i am
741:16 - okay
741:46 - hi i am
742:28 - i'm just gonna
742:29 - comment out everything here at the
742:31 - bottom focus on one side
742:43 - so
742:49 - negative values
742:55 - no i don't want that um
742:58 - minus 0.4 and i want
743:04 - absolute value of this
743:07 - hi i am
743:20 - i don't know why it's not showing with a
743:22 - different alpha
743:28 - begin path move to
743:30 - curve to
743:32 - stroke and then the different global
743:34 - alpha
743:46 - what is happening here
745:17 - how can this line appear here
745:38 - uh
745:39 - [Applause]
746:04 - what is happening there
746:36 - hi i am
746:50 - what is happening
748:07 - i really don't get what's going on now
748:13 - and i don't have much time left
748:37 - um
748:59 - let me just undo everything i did here
749:02 - and see if this weird behavior is still
749:04 - happening
749:23 - so
749:24 - if i comment out this draw nose does it
749:27 - do this strange thing
749:29 - yes it does
749:41 - and here if i say
750:14 - doesn't make the nose red
750:39 - i think it's something of a bug
750:42 - and i'm not in the
750:48 - i don't have enough energy now and brain
750:51 - power to figure it out
751:30 - let's see if two control points work
751:34 - bezier
751:35 - curve two
751:52 - hi i am
751:57 - a little bit more pointy there
752:13 - hi
752:41 - i don't want that
752:44 - the opposite of that
752:55 - hi i am
753:13 - hi i am
753:27 - hi i am
753:49 - it's not going great
754:02 - hi i am
754:36 - why doesn't this work
755:02 - i just undo everything
755:04 - it feels like
755:06 - it's against wanting its nose to be
755:09 - changed
755:10 - it doesn't want me to change its nose
755:12 - and
755:14 - i respect that
755:17 - okay
755:18 - i think this is it
755:21 - it's
755:22 - more than i thought i'm gonna do
755:25 - i'm really curious what
755:28 - samuel is gonna do
755:31 - i have a feeling it might be more
755:33 - impressive than what i did
755:36 - because you can do so many great things
755:38 - nowadays with
755:41 - online resources and he's a very clever
755:45 - guy
755:46 - so
755:50 - it's going to be exciting to find out
755:59 - yeah but sliders work video
756:02 - works
756:05 - testing
756:06 - 1
756:07 - 2
756:08 - 3
756:09 - 4
756:10 - 5
756:11 - 6
756:12 - 7
756:13 - 8
756:14 - 9
756:15 - 10
756:18 - camera works
756:24 - hello
756:29 - this is the last time i'm
756:32 - talking now as the avatar
756:35 - thanks for watching if you got to this
756:38 - part
756:40 - and
756:41 - the code is not
756:43 - horrible
756:45 - but some parts of it could be better
756:50 - much better
756:51 - than
756:53 - what they are
756:55 - i'm really tired
756:57 - and i'm gonna
756:59 - call it a day because it's not yet night
757:02 - it's just four in the afternoon
757:04 - and i'm gonna go home
757:06 - and rest
757:08 - and
757:08 - the weekend is coming
757:11 - so
757:14 - that's it thanks for watching
757:17 - and
757:18 - see you guys
757:29 - [Laughter]
757:37 - look at the hair look at the hair
757:41 - it's great wow i like it
757:50 - awesome
757:55 - okay i'm gonna put one more thing here
758:00 - instructions for what calibrate means
758:34 - so in the control panel when we do the
758:36 - video
759:12 - hi i am radus avatar
759:15 - testing one
760:28 - hi i am
761:19 - hi i am
762:06 - hi i am
762:27 - hi i am
762:49 - hi i am
763:20 - hi i am
763:34 - hi i am
764:26 - hi i am radus avatar
764:29 - testing one
764:31 - two
764:32 - three
764:33 - four
764:34 - five
764:35 - six
764:37 - hi i am
765:06 - why is calibrate there
765:36 - hi i am
765:55 - hi i am
766:04 - hi i am radu zavantar
766:07 - testing 1
766:09 - 2

766:11 - 4
766:12 - 5
766:13 - 6
766:14 - 7

766:17 - ten
766:48 - hi i am
767:01 - hi hi
767:09 - hi i am
767:23 - okay
767:26 - okay
767:28 - yeah
767:29 - i'm gonna put this on my website and see
767:31 - if the video loads
767:37 - and that's pretty much it i might make a
767:40 - simple preloader
767:42 - if the website
767:44 - if it doesn't load fast enough then
767:47 - i'm gonna put their loading please wait
767:50 - if
767:51 - the video doesn't come immediately when
767:53 - you press the start button
767:56 - but that's a minor thing so
768:00 - see you guys
