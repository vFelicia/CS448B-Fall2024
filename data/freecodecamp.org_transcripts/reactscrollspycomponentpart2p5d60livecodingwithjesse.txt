00:06 - hey everybody
00:07 - welcome to live coding with jesse i'm
00:10 - jesse
00:11 - and today
00:13 - we're going to finish the component that
00:14 - we started yesterday
00:16 - i
00:18 - i made a lot of changes so first thing
00:20 - i'm going to do is
00:22 - cover those changes
00:24 - before we get started with the coding
00:27 - this is my first time using the new
00:30 - webcam with my my home office set up
00:34 - so
00:35 - let me know if anything is weird
00:38 - hopefully the picture quality is a
00:39 - little bit better it should be
00:42 - but um
00:46 - i um
00:48 - i'm getting like from from my point of
00:50 - view
00:51 - the audio is way off from the video
00:55 - uh as i see it in obs i'm hoping it's
00:58 - not like that for you all please let me
01:00 - know uh what what it's like for you
01:07 - and my computer is really sluggish while
01:10 - i'm running this okay so the audio and
01:13 - video seem to be out of sync
01:19 - i was afraid that
01:24 - all right let's
01:27 - let me
01:32 - see what i could do i tried to look into
01:35 - how to fix that
01:39 - yesterday
01:46 - but uh i couldn't find
01:50 - i couldn't really find anything that
01:51 - seemed to apply with what was going on
01:54 - yesterday with the stream
01:57 - so while i'm explaining this i'm just
01:59 - gonna check over on my other screen
02:02 - some some options
02:22 - all right it looks like there's there's
02:24 - quite a few um
02:26 - options here
02:27 - to choose from on a google search
02:35 - uh john said time for a new machine
02:39 - yeah i
02:41 - that would be really nice
02:45 - i i do have one other thing that i can
02:47 - try it was just gonna
02:49 - be a lot of extra setup but i can i i
02:52 - can run obs on a different machine
02:56 - and then
02:59 - that would let my computer um my that
03:03 - i'm actually coding on
03:04 - uh it wouldn't have to handle all the
03:06 - load of running obs
03:10 - so
03:12 - uh maybe that'll be my my next step
03:31 - uh it looks like i can set an audio
03:33 - delay
03:42 - yeah maybe i'll um
03:48 - let me add in
03:52 - audio delay
04:05 - let me go to the settings real quick and
04:07 - add that in
04:08 - if this doesn't work
04:10 - um
04:11 - i guess i'll just go to the code
04:15 - let's see
04:17 - all right audio
04:28 - stream
04:29 - or output audio is probably where i need
04:31 - to go
05:21 - sync asset
05:27 - all right let me see if i can
05:31 - add this delay
05:43 - all right
05:46 - is this is this better at all
06:02 - you know what actually let me try
06:07 - can you hear me
06:09 - all right that seems to be
06:14 - so the um
06:16 - the webcam itself has a
06:18 - microphone so i wonder if i switch to
06:20 - that if it'll give it'll be better
06:23 - synced
06:29 - it looks like it's still off from my
06:31 - point of view but
06:34 - i'm not sure
06:43 - alright so i think i so i switched mics
06:46 - to a different mic and i think that i
06:48 - just set a delay of um
06:52 - 300 milliseconds
06:59 - but i'm not exactly sure
07:06 - alright
07:08 - so let me at least show you and explain
07:11 - what
07:12 - what's going on here
07:16 - and
07:18 - maybe i can try to adjust the settings a
07:20 - bit based on
07:22 - on your feedback
07:28 - let me go
07:31 - i'm gonna adjust the settings like
07:33 - drastically
07:50 - all right so in the spot where i
07:53 - think i can add a delay
07:56 - i just added an audio delay of 10
07:59 - seconds
08:04 - all right so it looks say the the volume
08:06 - is dropped
08:08 - okay
08:09 - i am a little bit farther away from the
08:12 - webcam mic
08:14 - let me see if i can adjust the volume
08:32 - all right is the volume any better now
08:41 - all right just keep keep letting me know
08:42 - whether it's getting better or worse and
08:44 - i'll go back to it
08:46 - but for now i
08:48 - i do want to show you what i've done
08:51 - so
08:53 - i'm sure most of you uh remember harshit
08:57 - he's been
08:59 - not in the stream quite as much since
09:00 - i've been streaming later on and it's
09:02 - it's really hard to watch because of the
09:04 - time zone
09:06 - uh difference
09:07 - but
09:09 - heart [ __ ] gave me some good advice
09:13 - to use
09:14 - what's it called react scroll
09:18 - i think that's what it's called yeah
09:20 - react scroll
09:22 - to help with handling the scrolling
09:24 - instead of trying to do it ourselves
09:26 - and
09:28 - you know i really wanted to use what
09:29 - we'd already used in the previous
09:31 - project
09:33 - because i thought that would save us a
09:35 - lot of time but as we saw yesterday
09:37 - it ended up being
09:41 - pretty difficult there were just so many
09:43 - pieces in different places
09:46 - that
09:46 - i i didn't even realize they were there
09:50 - because number one it's been a while
09:51 - since i worked on a project but also
09:54 - most of that work was from a pull
09:56 - request and i didn't do it myself so
10:01 - having seen the code and not actually
10:03 - written it
10:04 - myself
10:06 - it just
10:08 - was a lot harder to try to adapt it so i
10:10 - think this is probably going to be a
10:13 - better way to do it so far it's it's
10:15 - working well
10:17 - so
10:18 - i want to give you
10:20 - just a very brief overview of what we've
10:23 - done in terms of the code and let me
10:25 - make this code a lot bigger
10:28 - that's pretty small
10:36 - wow
10:38 - this is
10:43 - quite
10:44 - slow i see what i'm gonna do actually
10:47 - let me
10:49 - i'm gonna change my display
10:53 - let's see
10:58 - there we go
11:01 - let's change this display let's get rid
11:03 - of this
11:08 - and
11:14 - let's see
11:15 - that looks like it's in sync
11:18 - it's it's much better
11:22 - does that look better to you all
11:29 - so i might just go with this one then
11:36 - and
11:38 - maybe oh um
11:41 - if i just
11:45 - just go with this for now and then try
11:47 - to work out the difference
11:55 - i'm gonna switch back to the normal
11:58 - uh microphone
12:01 - that i usually use and so the audio will
12:04 - be you know back to normal
12:08 - okay
12:09 - that'll be something i just need to work
12:11 - on uh maybe after i stream today if i
12:13 - have time i'll work on getting the
12:15 - the other computer set up to run obs
12:20 - all right so for now
12:23 - let me make some space get rid of this
12:25 - sidebar i don't need that
12:53 - okay john says the video is fine
12:56 - but the sound is out
12:59 - works fine enough
13:02 - sound is now in sync okay awesome
13:05 - all right that's cool
13:06 - i think uh probably my this this laptop
13:10 - is just not powerful enough to handle
13:12 - that
13:12 - and so my audio's
13:14 - just gonna be out of sync so
13:16 - i don't think i'm gonna make it work
13:18 - with um
13:21 - with this computer and that camera
13:26 - so i need to figure some other solution
13:28 - out with another computer
13:31 - all right and
13:35 - now let's get to this
13:37 - i do want to show you all
13:38 - maybe on one of the breaks so remind me
13:41 - if you're interested but i'd like to
13:43 - show you all one of the side projects
13:44 - that uh harshit and nikki have been
13:47 - working really hard on
13:48 - and give you an update on that
13:52 - because we haven't we haven't looked at
13:54 - it in the stream in quite a while
13:58 - okay so
14:00 - here's what we have so far we've brought
14:02 - in well if i can click the right
14:04 - the right component i'll show you what
14:06 - we had so far
14:07 - okay so we imported
14:10 - let me see we actually imported a lot so
14:13 - we imported
14:15 - all of this stuff from react scroll
14:18 - okay so link events
14:20 - animate scroll as scroll
14:23 - and then scroll spy and scroller
14:28 - just as an aside here we are using a
14:32 - component called link on other pages
14:37 - uh and we're getting that from from next
14:40 - if we were to use that component on this
14:42 - page we could import link as something
14:45 - else and that would reduce the confusion
14:48 - so we probably will do that
14:54 - and i forgot to set my timer
14:56 - oh because this area
15:09 - alright so we've added
15:12 - basically everything
15:14 - everything where you see these these
15:16 - blue lines
15:18 - in the green line here this is all added
15:22 - so on component did mount
15:25 - basically um just setting
15:29 - event handlers right in this case the
15:31 - the scroll
15:36 - and then we have some functions that
15:38 - we're not using right now so we'll
15:39 - probably take out but i copied and
15:42 - pasted heavily from the example
15:45 - um if you want to check out react scroll
15:48 - uh let me let me throw a link in here
15:50 - for you
15:51 - i thought i had it here i guess i don't
15:54 - let me grab the link for react scrolls
15:56 - um so that you all can can check out
15:59 - this package
16:04 - there we go so the link's in there now
16:05 - if you click it and it doesn't work
16:07 - please try copying and pasting it
16:13 - okay
16:16 - so we'll probably get rid of scroll to
16:17 - top
16:19 - i don't really see the need for a scroll
16:21 - to top function
16:23 - on this particular page but it's good to
16:25 - know it's there
16:29 - because we should probably use that on
16:31 - the search page
16:33 - and we're definitely using the scroll to
16:36 - function so
16:37 - you could you know scroll to a certain
16:39 - element and you can see you can set
16:41 - different things like duration uh delay
16:45 - uh you can even set like the type of
16:47 - animation
16:49 - so really nice
16:50 - i'm not probably not going to mess too
16:52 - much with the type of animation because
16:54 - that's kind of thing that could
16:55 - get me off track for a while just
16:57 - testing things out and then like the
16:59 - grand scheme of things
17:01 - it's just not that important for this
17:04 - one particular part of the site
17:07 - um
17:08 - let's see
17:11 - let's continue
17:13 - yeah so some of these will have to work
17:16 - out
17:17 - and see like do we really need
17:19 - we're only using one type of scroll so
17:21 - we may not need some of these
17:24 - and then of course when the component
17:26 - unmounts wait we remove our
17:29 - event listeners
17:33 - now in terms of
17:35 - markup
17:37 - we've added this
17:39 - i've added this div i put in some inline
17:42 - styles in the div but they're not
17:43 - working for me right now so that's the
17:45 - number the first thing we're going to
17:46 - work on are these styles to get it in
17:48 - the right location
17:51 - but we just have an unordered list
17:55 - and then within each list item we have
17:57 - that link component not to be confused
18:00 - with the one we've used elsewhere from
18:02 - next
18:03 - this is the link component we're getting
18:04 - from react scroll
18:06 - and we've just set
18:08 - our class is active so when we're
18:11 - scrolled in that
18:13 - particular spot
18:15 - so
18:16 - when we're inside that component that
18:18 - element on the page that has an idea of
18:20 - spring
18:22 - then this link is going to have the
18:24 - class of active
18:27 - and we can attach and i have attached uh
18:30 - css classes
18:32 - to that
18:36 - right now i just have spring and summer
18:42 - oh sorry
18:44 - uh but we'll end up with you know all
18:46 - the seasons so we'll have four
18:48 - four links
18:51 - and
18:52 - the only other change that i needed to
18:54 - make was
18:56 - in our container so it's the second
18:59 - content container
19:03 - we changed
19:04 - why
19:05 - i changed this
19:07 - id i should say i added the id of spring
19:12 - and then i added in another container
19:13 - below that and gave it the id of summer
19:16 - just so that we had two to work with to
19:19 - test
19:22 - all right so all in all
19:25 - once we get rid of everything we don't
19:26 - need i think this will end up being
19:29 - less code
19:31 - um
19:32 - and it'll be more centralized in one
19:34 - place i mean yes we're bringing in a
19:35 - whole another npm package but in terms
19:38 - of like cluttering our components way
19:40 - less clutter
19:48 - all right
19:49 - now let me show you what it looks like
19:53 - so
19:58 - let me go to
20:00 - missionary outreach
20:19 - okay so right now
20:21 - i can't even see it
20:23 - so something i did with the styles are
20:25 - really messing things up
20:29 - so i'm gonna inspect here
20:32 - because i know in the markup it's it's
20:34 - right below this
20:36 - so even though we can't see it on the
20:37 - page it's it's obviously still going to
20:39 - be in the same place in the markup so
20:41 - that's where we're going to search for
20:42 - it we'll mess with the styles a bit
20:44 - right here in devtools
20:46 - and see if we can figure out you know
20:48 - what to do i think
20:51 - i pulled over the styles from our other
20:53 - project that resource center project
20:55 - it's uh it's
20:57 - rc.franciscan.university if anybody
20:59 - wants to check that out
21:00 - and uh i believe it's the
21:04 - planning guide page would be slash
21:06 - planning hyphen guide
21:08 - and i think we had that menu
21:11 - positioned
21:13 - uh
21:14 - yeah let me make this bigger we had that
21:18 - menu positioned like in our
21:21 - in our dom tree we had it
21:25 - like up at
21:27 - one of the higher levels
21:33 - so i think that made a difference
21:39 - so i'm just gonna get rid of a lot of
21:41 - these styles
21:43 - right now just to see does that make any
21:45 - difference at all
21:47 - and we could see
21:48 - it does not
21:50 - so the one thing that i think
21:52 - is messing this up is
21:56 - this
21:59 - position fixed
22:02 - but if we wanted to behave in in the
22:04 - appropriate way we need that
22:10 - sorry for the yawning
22:13 - i've um
22:16 - i've been having like
22:19 - uh i've been so drowsy tired all day i
22:22 - uh
22:23 - i thought i was gonna fall
22:24 - asleep uh so let me just click it just
22:27 - to show you
22:28 - right so when you click it
22:30 - it does take you to the right section
22:34 - so that works i did have to use an
22:35 - offset
22:37 - of negative 50 pixels so we could still
22:39 - see this because the id is actually on
22:41 - this container and not on
22:44 - on the title because we want the scrolls
22:46 - by to detect that it's inside of this
22:49 - container the whole way down when we're
22:51 - scrolling otherwise it would just very
22:53 - briefly have the class of active and
22:55 - then once this was off the screen it
22:57 - would go away that would be no good
23:02 - all right you know what and
23:04 - nikki says give it a ridiculous z index
23:06 - just to be sure all right let's let's
23:08 - try that let's put put all these back on
23:11 - and then give it a z index
23:15 - uh
23:18 - big z index
23:23 - actually you can see where is it
23:26 - it it looks like it's putting it way
23:28 - down in the bottom
23:33 - uh let's see if we go
23:41 - see if it puts it
23:43 - ah yes
23:45 - okay
23:48 - all right so it it needed at least we
23:50 - can see it on the screen so
23:53 - uh right here in the corner let me
23:56 - make this bigger so
24:00 - it'll be easier so here in the corner we
24:03 - have this spring and summer
24:11 - but really what we need
24:20 - this is kind of odd i don't know if you
24:22 - can see this but the background color is
24:24 - is off here
24:26 - it's white here and then it's at off
24:28 - white i don't know what's going on with
24:30 - that you know what i think uh the
24:32 - student that's working on this page
24:34 - brought over a bunch of styles from the
24:36 - html css version of the page that he did
24:39 - first and i think some of them are
24:41 - conflicting
24:44 - so
24:45 - uh there's there's a few areas where the
24:47 - styles are a little off
24:51 - it's not really a big deal we'll get
24:53 - that sorted out
24:59 - okay
25:06 - i guess what i'm thinking is
25:16 - we may have talked about this yesterday
25:24 - is that this menu won't
25:26 - this menu will stay here on the page
25:30 - so it you won't see it it won't go up
25:32 - here as you scroll
25:35 - so here's how i think we can make that
25:37 - happen you all please let me know
25:40 - if you have a better idea i'm definitely
25:44 - open to suggestions
25:46 - so
25:46 - by default
25:49 - this will be
25:52 - positioned here on the page
25:55 - uh so i think we can
25:58 - how can we accomplish that
26:01 - we'll get into the css of that in just a
26:03 - second but then
26:05 - since we already have the scroll spy set
26:06 - up we'll just check out
26:08 - there's got to be a way to make
26:10 - something happen
26:12 - um
26:13 - like fire off a function that we create
26:17 - when we get to a certain place
26:20 - or
26:22 - change something we got to be able to
26:23 - change something when we get to that
26:25 - certain spot
26:27 - and at that point the styles will change
26:30 - so that this goes to
26:33 - something very similar to what it is
26:34 - right now
26:39 - so let's
26:48 - let's go back to the code
26:52 - so i think we can do this
26:54 - [Music]
27:04 - all right if we have
27:14 - oh
27:15 - nikki saying use position sticky
27:25 - yeah is that
27:26 - what's the support for position sticky
27:29 - let's check that out
28:00 - hmm
28:20 - all right well
28:23 - i mean obviously internet explorer 11
28:27 - is not supporting it
28:32 - i'm not really that worried about
28:34 - internet explorer 11.
28:39 - i've told you all how i feel about it if
28:41 - anybody once really wants to know ask me
28:43 - and i'll answer it at the end of the
28:44 - stream
28:45 - um
28:50 - yeah so i'm not going to worry about
28:52 - internet explorer 11 for right now
28:57 - let's try position sticky
28:59 - and i don't know that i've ever used
29:01 - this before i remember
29:03 - someone bringing it up on the stream
29:04 - before and we checked it out but i don't
29:06 - know if i ever used it if i did i forgot
29:09 - um
29:10 - so let's play around with it
29:20 - i don't know where it went
29:24 - let's just look up um
29:29 - what
29:30 - yeah i'm pretty sure i'll get a link
29:32 - right to mdn from here there we go
29:42 - oh polyfills
29:44 - maybe we can't make this work
29:50 - all right here's our sticky position if
29:52 - you haven't used mdn before i highly
29:55 - recommend it so it's the mozilla
29:57 - developer network anytime you search for
30:00 - anything in html css javascript and
30:04 - who knows what else
30:05 - the
30:06 - mdn uh article on that will probably
30:10 - probably be one of the top search
30:12 - results uh so it's it's very thorough
30:16 - if you're a beginner it could be a
30:18 - little intimidating because there's so
30:19 - much information
30:21 - for beginners i recommend if if you're
30:24 - confused by all this
30:26 - scroll down to the examples and check
30:28 - out the examples first
30:30 - for me starting out and even now
30:33 - the examples sometimes make it clear to
30:35 - me
30:36 - immediately whether or not this is going
30:38 - to work
30:39 - and then if i think it'll work and i'm
30:41 - interested i'll go back and read
30:43 - and
30:44 - learn what i what i need to about it
30:47 - but otherwise it can take some time to
30:50 - get through everything and try to figure
30:52 - it all out
30:55 - um
30:56 - so
30:57 - let me just uh
30:59 - go through this quickly
31:01 - i'm not gonna read it out i'm just gonna
31:02 - glance at it
31:29 - all right
31:43 - let's go down to the sticky area
31:57 - all right this sounds perfect for us a
31:59 - stickly positioned element is treated as
32:01 - relatively positioned until across
32:03 - crosses
32:05 - specified threshold
32:07 - at which point is treated as fixed it's
32:10 - exactly what we were going to try to
32:12 - implement ourselves with javascript
32:19 - okay
32:31 - which one
32:40 - one is all right so which one has the id
32:43 - of one
32:51 - i don't see it in there
32:54 - all right let's see
32:57 - oh
32:59 - okay
33:02 - i like that that's nice
33:11 - okay
33:16 - i just see that uh frankie just joined
33:19 - us welcome
33:20 - thanks for joining us don't worry about
33:22 - being late
33:28 - all right so let's try it out uh it
33:30 - seems like all i really need is
33:33 - this position sticky and then
33:35 - like a value from the top
33:38 - so let's go back here
33:42 - and let me get rid of
33:50 - that was weird that max with is messing
33:52 - things up
33:54 - oh
33:57 - can you believe it it works just like
33:59 - that
34:03 - that's amazing
34:05 - check that out
34:11 - wow
34:15 - that's cool all right a few things
34:18 - that don't want to try here
34:22 - okay so
34:23 - uh when it really is position fixed
34:26 - it's nice that it doesn't take up this
34:28 - space here so i want to do something
34:30 - about that
34:34 - um
34:38 - i definitely don't want it taking up so
34:41 - much space
34:50 - i don't know if you all can hear that
34:52 - but my phone just keeps going off
34:54 - constantly
34:56 - um
35:01 - okay i do have some work messages let me
35:03 - just check and make sure it's not
35:05 - emergency
35:19 - okay there is a change i need to make
35:24 - to the bulletin website
35:27 - but i don't think it needs to be made
35:28 - until the end of the week
35:30 - all right so no no emergencies
35:35 - okay
35:37 - thanks for being patient check that out
35:40 - all right so let's see
35:47 - interesting
35:49 - um
36:00 - all right so this position right it's
36:02 - not working let's see if we can do
36:07 - there we go
36:08 - nice all right so i know floats are old
36:12 - school but in this case a float does
36:13 - exactly what we wanted to
36:16 - so
36:17 - we're gonna go with the float and then
36:19 - we're gonna put a
36:21 - margin
36:22 - right
36:26 - margin
36:27 - if i can't get this right here we go
36:29 - right of 16
36:32 - pixels okay i always like to have at
36:34 - least 16 pixels here because you can see
36:37 - we have this scroll bar that shows up
36:41 - and
36:42 - on browsers where this happens
36:46 - uh we definitely want enough space so
36:48 - you can still read and click on these
36:52 - i believe internet explorer scroll bar
36:55 - is like always there
36:57 - and it's big
36:58 - so
37:00 - i know we're not really trying to
37:01 - support it but
37:04 - something small like that i think is
37:08 - it's definitely worth doing because you
37:10 - never know how browsers look to on
37:12 - different
37:13 - um
37:15 - operating systems so i think this scroll
37:17 - bar is like the slimmest one and
37:20 - on windows i believe they're a little
37:21 - bit thicker
37:24 - all right wow that was
37:29 - that was super
37:31 - easy
37:32 - uh i guess
37:37 - what's going on here this is
37:40 - it's not exactly working
37:44 - something happened and it's not working
37:47 - so that active class is not working
37:49 - right
37:51 - uh but let me check the time
37:55 - all right only about two minutes uh
37:57 - let's
38:00 - let's get these styles over into a css
38:03 - file
38:05 - quickly
38:08 - so i'm just going to copy these and
38:10 - we'll do the position sticky so this
38:12 - will be
38:14 - i'm just using this
38:15 - missions.css that we already had
38:20 - and
38:21 - let's start
38:24 - um
38:25 - actually i had that on the div and that
38:27 - div doesn't have a class right now
38:29 - we need to give that dave a class
38:39 - let's get rid of these styles
38:42 - and give it a class name
38:46 - of
38:48 - um
38:53 - scroll spy container
39:17 - position sticky and then we'll paste
39:20 - this
39:26 - in i don't have auto formatting set up
39:30 - for my css unfortunately
39:33 - i have to manually do that
39:36 - there we go
39:41 - um
39:42 - all right cool let's
39:44 - i don't think we changed anything else
39:48 - let's give it a refresh
39:50 - just to be sure
39:52 - uh the styles don't
39:54 - auto refresh so when i change the uh
39:57 - like the css files
40:13 - it's taking quite a while
40:18 - why is that happening
40:25 - uh i think i messed something up here
40:36 - all right no none of those errors would
40:38 - be able to explain it
40:40 - okay let me take a five minute break i'm
40:43 - gonna go to the live chat and answer
40:45 - some questions and when we come back
40:46 - we're gonna troubleshoot
40:50 - the stuff that i've apparently broken
40:56 - okay i didn't notice right off at the
40:59 - very beginning of the stream tova says
41:01 - hello first time here um if you're still
41:03 - here jova welcome to the stream thank
41:06 - you so much for uh for joining us today
41:09 - sorry about all the technical
41:11 - difficulties at the beginning
41:31 - oh phoenix said earlier there's a weird
41:33 - noise let me know if there still is a
41:35 - weird noise
41:36 - i mean there shouldn't
41:40 - i don't hear anything now nobody is
41:42 - home at my house so if you hear
41:44 - something weird
41:46 - let me know again
41:49 - yeah i can't hear anything
41:55 - uh james ross asked if there's any
41:57 - update uh with uh my kids brain project
42:01 - um
42:03 - so
42:05 - the last thing that happened with that
42:06 - project was i i had a
42:10 - video
42:11 - call with
42:13 - alex castillo
42:16 - and
42:18 - he works with brain computer computer
42:20 - interfaces and javascript
42:23 - and
42:23 - he does presentations on it at different
42:26 - conferences he used to work at netflix
42:28 - and he has his own company now that are
42:31 - is focusing on the brain computer
42:32 - interfaces
42:34 - so he
42:35 - he was working on
42:39 - making the link so we did some testing
42:41 - to try to get the
42:43 - brain computer interface
42:45 - connected via bluetooth directly to a
42:47 - website right through the through the
42:49 - browser
42:50 - uh and we were successful at getting
42:52 - that to work
42:54 - um i did send him some some test data so
42:58 - he's going to try to work with that to
43:00 - get a link
43:01 - so that the data can be readable
43:04 - so
43:05 - i've no idea how long that's going to
43:07 - take in the meantime
43:10 - i can probably start working on like the
43:12 - front end of it
43:14 - and just
43:16 - basically like mocking
43:18 - data
43:19 - um
43:20 - so
43:22 - i'm hoping to get started on that soon
43:25 - it's i mean it's it's there's just
43:27 - always things going on you know there's
43:28 - always things to do so
43:31 - hopefully i'll get to that it is kind of
43:33 - high on my list so
43:36 - oh i will update you all as as we go on
43:56 - uh john soto says um question uh why not
44:01 - use scroll into view
44:06 - um
44:06 - we could use that
44:10 - since we are already using
44:13 - this package to
44:16 - um
44:17 - to track the the scroll
44:20 - i'm just using the tools that are
44:21 - available uh there
44:24 - uh to move the
44:26 - to do the scrolling
44:28 - so
44:30 - i think this is the case where there's a
44:31 - lot of different ways to do this
44:33 - and i don't know if this weighs the best
44:35 - way
44:37 - uh but so far it is it seems to be
44:40 - working
44:44 - uh john
44:45 - soto if there's any particular reason
44:48 - why you think strolling into view would
44:49 - actually be the better way to go please
44:51 - let me know because i'm i'm definitely
44:52 - interested in doing this
44:55 - you know the best way i can
45:03 - uh john hanson says bringing over a
45:04 - pre-made react package can be great
45:06 - though i find that you have to put
45:08 - trust in the dev of that package
45:11 - yeah for sure for sure i think that's i
45:14 - mean that's an issue i think everybody
45:16 - deals with now there are very few like
45:18 - large-scale projects where everything's
45:20 - built
45:21 - from scratch i mean
45:23 - like anybody using react for a project
45:25 - is trusting the devs behind react it's
45:28 - just
45:28 - um
45:29 - i don't know that's just the way
45:32 - web development is now
45:34 - uh for better or for worse we're all
45:36 - able to build really cool things and
45:39 - and build on
45:40 - you know what everyone else is working
45:42 - on
45:43 - it's really awesome it's great
45:44 - collaboration but at the same time
45:47 - yeah it does require that trust so
45:51 - i guess um
45:52 - it is a good idea to at least
45:55 - look at the package a bit look at the
45:57 - github repo
45:58 - uh see some of the issues what have
46:00 - people said about it how many people are
46:02 - actually using it
46:04 - um
46:05 - you know see
46:06 - basically if there's anything that just
46:08 - looks weird
46:10 - in terms of
46:12 - you know does nobody use this maybe
46:14 - there's a reason why nobody uses it um
46:16 - are there a ton of issues that
46:19 - that never get closed
46:21 - that's probably a warning sign too so
46:24 - at the end of the day though you're
46:25 - right you just you have to trust that
46:27 - the people that made the package uh did
46:30 - a good job
46:32 - and uh you know definitely make sure to
46:34 - test things out on your own
46:36 - um and not just trust that it's it's
46:38 - always gonna work
46:54 - uh
47:02 - okay let me
47:11 - let me start this and let's go
47:15 - oh okay i broke everything so let's
47:17 - check that out first
47:19 - and see why
47:22 - why it's broken now
47:24 - probably because i've messed up the
47:26 - width
47:29 - [Music]
47:34 - um
47:36 - shoot
48:07 - this just seems
48:29 - all right let me
48:40 - i think that
48:41 - maybe the float right is what's doing it
48:57 - see
49:06 - while i'm waiting for that to reload i'm
49:08 - just gonna go through
49:10 - okay
49:11 - all right that did work now
49:13 - um some of the functionality we needed
49:16 - i think because i think we have all the
49:18 - functionality now it it scrolls with a
49:21 - page
49:23 - but only when we want it to
49:26 - you click a link
49:28 - and it goes to the right section
49:34 - oh
49:34 - we're still missing
49:38 - that change
49:40 - in
49:43 - when we have that active class
49:45 - so that was something that was working
49:47 - before i started the stream so something
49:49 - that i've done since then has has
49:52 - changed it
49:53 - um
49:55 - so that plus
49:57 - this positioning is
50:01 - what we need to uh we need to fix
50:06 - all right
50:08 - let me
50:11 - i'm gonna save this i'm gonna try one
50:13 - more time just to see like what
50:19 - what's going on is this this is it
50:21 - always gonna happen and it looks like it
50:23 - is
50:25 - okay
50:32 - oh
50:35 - nice
50:36 - all right cool it um
50:38 - it worked this time
50:59 - all right excellent
51:02 - um at some point we may not get to it on
51:05 - this stream but we'll definitely want to
51:07 - make sure that that
51:08 - side
51:09 - navigation goes away
51:15 - we don't really have room for it on a
51:17 - smaller screen
51:24 - all right
51:26 - all right cool
51:27 - all right so now that's that's sorted
51:30 - and we need
51:32 - i need to figure out why the active
51:34 - class is not being applied here so let
51:37 - me inspect this
51:38 - so we can see
51:40 - if it's being applied
51:44 - let's see so it should be on
51:53 - i think it'll be applied here on the a
51:55 - tag
52:00 - okay yeah so it is being applied it's
52:03 - just the css that needs to change
52:08 - okay
52:10 - and that makes sense because the styles
52:12 - are actually on the li right now
52:20 - okay
52:40 - oops
52:43 - all right let's check it out
53:02 - it'd be nice if i could get the class to
53:04 - apply here but i don't think it's going
53:06 - to work like that
53:12 - nikki just said it looks like masonry is
53:14 - just being a bit slow on this machine
53:16 - yeah i think you're right
53:18 - um it's just
53:20 - this this machine just can't handle
53:24 - streaming very well
53:29 - hmm
53:43 - john said looks like this coding session
53:44 - has been conquered
53:45 - almost we're close we're really close
53:49 - okay so if i
53:53 - all right let me ask this is there a way
54:00 - in css
54:04 - to where i could change the style
54:08 - of a parent
54:10 - if the child has a certain class added
54:16 - i don't i don't know if that's even
54:17 - possible
54:23 - let's let's go to google
54:45 - i know you can do it on
54:51 - uh what is it
54:52 - like hover and stuff like that
55:11 - so
55:23 - hmm
55:36 - all right john's saying that styled
55:38 - components would work really well here
55:41 - because we could just switch the
55:42 - attribute name with javascript
56:00 - hmm
56:08 - uh actually let me let me uh to look at
56:11 - this from a different uh perspective
56:13 - here
56:14 - so
56:18 - i want to try two things one is nikki's
56:21 - idea and it's uh what if we move the
56:23 - link component outside the allies
56:26 - we'll try that first that seems to be
56:28 - the most straightforward thing if it
56:29 - works then great we're done
56:32 - if that doesn't work then what i want to
56:34 - do is
56:35 - let's move the styles onto the a tags
56:38 - and see if we can get a similar effect
56:41 - by putting the styles on the a tag
56:52 - whoa nikki there's a parent selector
56:58 - no way how did i not know about that
57:19 - oh wait a second
57:22 - is there really a parent selector or is
57:24 - that just a suggestion
57:26 - from css tricks
57:49 - all right i'm looking it up right now on
57:51 - can i use on the other screen
58:25 - all right i don't think that's it i
58:26 - think uh i found the um
58:29 - johnny says yes there's a parent
58:30 - selector
58:33 - all right let's try it then
58:50 - seems like it's not but a lot of people
58:52 - want it
58:53 - yeah i want it
58:56 - all right let's
59:00 - let's try moving this around
59:38 - this is gonna be really weird i don't
59:40 - think i don't know if this will work
59:44 - i'm just gonna try with one just to save
59:46 - time
59:51 - did it refresh it
60:03 - i don't think it did let me refresh
60:35 - okay
60:36 - john says the parent selector will be
60:38 - out in css4
60:44 - all right so i guess i can't use it yet
61:16 - hmm
61:27 - oh you know what i didn't
61:30 - the css is still not
61:32 - not right
61:34 - so it it did work and
61:37 - you know that we now have an li inside
61:40 - of this a tag
61:42 - which
61:43 - [Music]
61:46 - actually that
61:47 - that's weird but it works
61:50 - um
61:53 - so we need to have li
61:59 - senior dev a active
62:02 - l i
62:06 - there we go
62:16 - okay
62:19 - that looks like it will work
62:22 - so
62:25 - really wish i didn't have to reload this
62:27 - again but i do
62:28 - it's just so slow
62:30 - i'll check my time while we're waiting
62:32 - all right about 10 minutes
62:34 - i think 10 minutes is more than enough
62:36 - to fix this problem
62:39 - hopefully
62:56 - all right i'm checking out the live chat
62:58 - while i'm waiting for that to load
63:00 - nikki says disclaimer i've never
63:02 - actually used position sticky uh just a
63:05 - possible answer for the problem you
63:07 - should do what you want
63:09 - good to know thanks for that
63:11 - because also the css tricks article on
63:13 - something uh is also a great resource i
63:16 - go to that when mdn starts to confuse me
63:18 - which is often okay that's that is good
63:21 - css tricks is um is pretty good all
63:24 - right cool check that out so we have
63:27 - when we're not on that area we don't
63:29 - have that little border and now when we
63:31 - scroll to it hey there's that little
63:33 - border
63:35 - perfect
63:38 - perfect all right
63:41 - nice
63:46 - really cool
63:49 - all right i like that um i'm thinking
63:51 - maybe the colors could be different
63:54 - uh we're not really using that yellow
63:56 - color in this site so we may want to
63:58 - change that
64:00 - um
64:01 - you may
64:03 - may or may not want to use the gold
64:04 - color for this
64:06 - you know maybe we'll go with
64:08 - you might want to go with uh regular
64:10 - color text with gold on the side
64:13 - um
64:14 - green text with gold on the side i mean
64:16 - there's a lot of combinations so i'm
64:18 - probably not going to get into that for
64:20 - this stream
64:22 - i mean it's pretty basic just changing
64:24 - hex colors on
64:26 - on text here
64:28 - um
64:31 - yeah all right very cool so what i do
64:33 - need to do though is to go back in and
64:36 - make sure i change the markup for that
64:38 - second link
64:39 - as well
64:44 - so
64:45 - that was i believe nikki's idea to put
64:48 - the
64:49 - li inside of the
64:52 - link tag and that was a great idea
64:56 - honestly i thought it would not work
64:59 - but
65:00 - it was such a straightforward change
65:02 - that it was definitely worth the try and
65:05 - it turned out that it did work
65:10 - for some reason my auto formatting is
65:12 - not correcting this mess that i just
65:14 - made
65:17 - um
65:18 - probably when i go to commit it'll get
65:20 - corrected so i'm not going to worry
65:22 - about it
65:24 - but i do want to
65:26 - wait for the refresh just to make sure
65:28 - it's working
65:30 - and i don't think it'll work
65:33 - to go down here because the page isn't
65:35 - long enough i can't actually scroll into
65:37 - the section
65:38 - so i won't be able to test that out
65:41 - but we
65:42 - see if we can see
65:46 - yeah it it won't work
65:49 - right now
65:50 - so if i add some like demo content to
65:53 - this section we can see if it'll work
65:55 - but i'm i'm pretty confident that it
65:57 - will i tested it out earlier with
66:00 - some different stuff and i was getting a
66:02 - change in the
66:05 - uh in the classes for each section
66:09 - and we can see like the the allies here
66:12 - so these look the same now
66:14 - all right
66:16 - let's save that and
66:20 - let's do a git status
66:25 - what why is my
66:27 - chrome bouncing
66:30 - what does it want to tell me i don't
66:32 - know
66:33 - um
66:34 - let's do uh commit now
66:38 - yeah this looks good
66:47 - okay cool
66:48 - um
66:52 - i think there's some low dash stuff we
66:54 - can get rid of
66:56 - like the four each
66:58 - i believe in the map values
67:03 - you know i want to i we can for sure get
67:05 - rid of the four each but i do want to
67:07 - double check about map values so maybe
67:09 - i'll um
67:12 - maybe i'll wait and double check that uh
67:14 - later on before i just get rid of it
67:18 - uh but for now
67:20 - we can do a git add
67:24 - and
67:27 - and we'll run through our
67:35 - yarn
67:45 - so we're going to add a feature and this
67:47 - we add
67:51 - um
67:54 - completed
68:15 - all right i added the word completed in
68:17 - there because i think i may have made a
68:18 - commit already that said we added this
68:21 - um
68:22 - when we had just added
68:24 - some of it and it didn't work yet
68:27 - so while that goes through all the tests
68:29 - and everything i'm going to go over to
68:30 - the live chat
68:32 - and start answering some questions
68:36 - so let me scroll up to where i left off
68:55 - uh devin says you should listen to
68:58 - everything everything spring summer
69:01 - winter dread while you work on this
69:05 - oh i have to
69:07 - all right i'll have to look that up
69:09 - i don't think i've heard that
69:17 - nikki said is it bigger than 16 pixels
69:20 - on windows i think that's let's talk
69:21 - about the scroll bar
69:23 - um
69:25 - devin says i.e scroll bar i thought we
69:27 - were dropping support
69:29 - yeah
69:30 - windows ie for sure has a big scroll bar
69:32 - but i think on windows in general every
69:35 - browser has a big scroll bar
69:46 - it's been a while since i've used
69:47 - windows so i'm i'm not 100 sure but
69:50 - i think the last time i tested on
69:53 - windows which is probably the last time
69:55 - we launched something new
69:57 - uh i i think
69:59 - there were large scroll bars even on on
70:01 - chrome
70:04 - devin says will this even be usable on
70:05 - ie can you just target ie and show a sub
70:08 - nav for spring summer at the top
70:10 - yeah we'll see i'm i'm not even going to
70:12 - try to make it 100 usable and ie
70:16 - uh i mean like think about this is like
70:18 - one page on an entire site that's gonna
70:20 - have thousands of pages
70:22 - most likely
70:24 - um
70:25 - i'm okay if one menu looks a little bit
70:28 - weird
70:31 - i'd actually it would be cool to see
70:32 - what it falls back to
70:34 - i mean i am interested in trying it on
70:36 - internet explorer just to see what
70:38 - happens
70:39 - there's got to be some like fallback
70:41 - position
70:42 - does it fall back to fixed
70:44 - in that case it'll still work it'll just
70:47 - look weird
70:48 - um
70:50 - when it's uh
70:52 - you know in the hero section
71:16 - devin says mixing
71:17 - top and margin right seems weird to me
71:20 - yeah it it definitely is weird uh it
71:23 - there's some weirdness going on with the
71:25 - styles and markup for this component so
71:30 - i think
71:33 - had i made it from scratch instead of
71:35 - importing a little bit from previous
71:37 - projects
71:39 - i maybe wouldn't have done it like that
71:45 - but um
71:47 - this works
71:50 - so i'm definitely
71:54 - i say i'm i'm pretty sure that there's
71:56 - probably a
71:57 - better way to do it
71:59 - um it probably wouldn't
72:01 - look different to the user
72:03 - and it probably wouldn't result i guess
72:06 - i tried to save that webpage
72:09 - all right that's why
72:10 - chrome was bouncing
72:12 - yeah so i i don't know that it would be
72:14 - worthwhile
72:16 - for me to really worry about
72:18 - about that at this point so i mean just
72:21 - to be clear i think writing good code
72:23 - and writing the best solutions is
72:25 - important but
72:27 - you don't always have time for that
72:29 - like i don't think i could
72:32 - make sure all this code is as close to
72:34 - perfect as possible
72:36 - and still get it launched on time
72:39 - uh so what we have to settle for then is
72:42 - does it work
72:43 - and is the code at least reasonable
72:46 - um
72:48 - you know and i
72:51 - that's that's my experience
72:53 - you know with actually working on
72:54 - projects with deadlines and things is
72:56 - that you just
72:57 - you just have to do it sometimes so
73:00 - but anyway i i entirely agree that
73:02 - setting the marge
73:05 - works but the reason we had to do that
73:07 - obviously was because of the float right
73:09 - so
73:10 - um
73:13 - we need that
73:15 - offset
73:17 - for the scroll spy
73:19 - uh so you can see that come into play
73:21 - like so we need that top value
73:23 - uh for the
73:25 - i'm sorry for the sticky so you can see
73:27 - that come into play of this 50 pixels
73:29 - down
73:31 - but then we also need the margin
73:34 - since we decided to use the float
73:38 - which is pretty weird to use with top as
73:40 - well that's why we needed that margin
73:43 - so
73:45 - definitely weird but it gets the job
73:47 - done
73:50 - and i think yeah it went through
73:52 - everything
73:54 - so i also fixed the test i remember
73:56 - yesterday i was saying that the tests
73:57 - were like taking forever so um
74:01 - i believe it was nikki that found
74:04 - the commit where i broke everything
74:07 - and so i was able to go back and um
74:11 - and change everything at some point i
74:13 - made a commit that reverted to an older
74:16 - version of the package json file i'm not
74:18 - exactly sure how that happened but it
74:20 - was about five days ago
74:22 - and so all this week this past week the
74:25 - tests have been acting weird
74:27 - that was why
74:30 - so now it's all worked out we have our
74:32 - test back
74:34 - and
74:35 - they run quickly
74:38 - so i'm going to run a get push to make
74:40 - sure that is on github
74:44 - so you all can check that out if you'd
74:46 - like
74:48 - a link to the github repo is in the
74:50 - description
74:52 - uh frankie s if i'm feeling better today
74:54 - oh thanks for asking frankie
74:57 - this morning i felt good
75:01 - but then after a couple hours my energy
75:03 - was just gone
75:04 - and um
75:06 - actually i was actually felt so good
75:07 - this morning i was thinking about
75:08 - working out i ended up not and just
75:10 - started work
75:12 - like right away
75:14 - uh i did have to take the kids to school
75:16 - so i got the kids ready and i took them
75:17 - to school and um
75:20 - i don't know i still might work out i'm
75:21 - thinking about it
75:24 - i just don't want to go i i don't feel
75:26 - 100 but i don't want to go too long
75:27 - without a workout because i know like
75:29 - with my depression
75:31 - if i go too long without working out
75:33 - i'll get depressed so
75:36 - even though my legs are still sore from
75:38 - my last workout that was two days ago
75:41 - it would be better for my mental health
75:43 - i think if i just do it so hopefully
75:45 - i'll do it
75:46 - and uh
75:47 - but i think this uh this antibiotic that
75:50 - i'm on is is starting to help the
75:51 - congestion is almost completely gone
75:55 - uh so
75:57 - i'm glad it i'm glad it seems like it's
75:59 - it's working because i
76:01 - honestly i've had this on and off i
76:03 - don't know what it is
76:05 - some type of
76:06 - virus or something i don't know on and
76:08 - off for
76:10 - it seems like
76:12 - months uh who knows how long it really
76:14 - was but it just seems like it's been so
76:15 - long
76:16 - um
76:18 - but hey i appreciate you asking thank
76:20 - you
76:23 - oh john says try out right 18 pixels
76:29 - all right i'll try that i'm not going to
76:30 - try it right now i want to test first i
76:32 - think it looks okay with 16
76:36 - but i'm not opposed to bumping out a bit
76:38 - more if we need to especially for
76:41 - people using windows
76:58 - uh nikki says i also thought it wouldn't
77:01 - work so flipping the lis and the link
77:03 - tags
77:04 - um so that the allies inside the link
77:07 - so you're saying
77:08 - thought that wouldn't work what are the
77:10 - implications of not having the
77:13 - uli structure
77:16 - but a ul
77:19 - a structure
77:21 - a city truth i don't know but
77:24 - we may want to think about that i think
77:28 - visually there's not going to be any
77:30 - implications but for screen readers
77:32 - there might be
77:34 - i maybe i'll have to look at that
77:37 - i'm wondering
77:40 - yeah i mean based on the position and
77:42 - the markup that's actually a really good
77:44 - position i think for screen readers
77:45 - because it's like a sub menu that comes
77:49 - comes in there
77:51 - we'll have to see i mean maybe i might
77:52 - just have to
77:54 - try out just the basic
77:56 - screen reader that comes like on a mac
78:00 - and see what it says when it gets to
78:01 - that point
78:06 - i mean they'll still show up as link
78:08 - tags
78:11 - so user would know that it's it's a link
78:17 - i wonder how misleading anchor tags are
78:19 - for screen readers right because if they
78:21 - show up as
78:23 - a link
78:27 - would a screen reader just describe it
78:28 - as a link like to another page
78:31 - when it's really not it's just the link
78:33 - to a different spot in the same page
78:35 - like what happens when that jump happens
78:37 - does the screen reader also jump down
78:39 - i'm getting kind of off topic here but
78:41 - that's
78:43 - that's really interesting i just don't
78:45 - know
78:48 - you know what is doing that
78:51 - is jumping to a different section in the
78:52 - same page even a good idea for
78:55 - accessibility
78:57 - i don't know i need to learn more about
78:59 - that
79:00 - there's like a whole world of
79:02 - you know making your website more
79:04 - accessible that
79:06 - you know i just don't know enough about
79:26 - um john's pretty sure that li is not
79:29 - needed on uo
79:31 - uh also says chrome used to have an
79:32 - experimental flag to make a skinny
79:34 - scroll bar that shows wider when hovered
79:38 - not smart to develop with that flag on
79:42 - yeah why
79:44 - i mean i could see it would be easier to
79:45 - actually click a wider scroll bar to
79:48 - scroll up and down but
79:50 - i don't know i think that would be
79:51 - annoying for trying to develop stuff
79:53 - with that you're basically changing the
79:55 - width
79:57 - the window with
79:58 - on hover that's not
80:03 - i mean it's only a couple pixels that
80:04 - depending on where your break points are
80:06 - that could totally like make your whole
80:08 - layout reflow just on hover
80:17 - oh okay nikki said
80:21 - i i do have something in my package.json
80:23 - so i have a jest key that i need to
80:26 - remove
80:29 - but also says it's not a huge deal since
80:31 - it's not used now okay so i'll
80:33 - it's not hurting anything then to be
80:35 - there so i'll
80:37 - remove it at some point i guess
80:40 - uh
80:43 - yeah
80:44 - thanks for letting me know about that
80:46 - though that saved me so much time
80:48 - um you know earlier when you when you
80:51 - showed the commit where all that changed
81:03 - uh arthur says
81:05 - hey jesse i'm learning front-end
81:07 - development my problem is that i switch
81:09 - between html css and javascript as
81:12 - priorities i try to create a small
81:15 - javascript project but stop at designing
81:18 - but again
81:20 - uh
81:21 - i get sleepy while learning html css all
81:24 - that best practices and cool stuff
81:27 - um yeah
81:31 - i guess in terms of priorities it's
81:38 - i mean you you need to know
81:40 - you need to know all of it i mean i
81:42 - focus i
81:43 - depending on what you want to do i mean
81:45 - i would focus more on javascript
81:48 - you will pick up
81:50 - your html and css more along the way uh
81:53 - those to me seem to be more simple
81:55 - especially html there's some tricky
81:58 - things to css if you really want to get
82:00 - into it there are some people doing
82:01 - really complex things with css and
82:03 - really cool things
82:04 - but for most of us
82:06 - you know we don't need to be at that
82:08 - level uh for for a lot of the sites that
82:11 - we make so
82:13 - you're probably better off focusing on
82:15 - your javascript and then instead of
82:17 - getting like bogged down in the styles
82:20 - just use a framework like like bootstrap
82:23 - or materialize or if you're doing react
82:25 - you know you could use material ui or
82:27 - you know whatever other framework that
82:30 - way uh you won't get as distracted by
82:32 - the styles in the ui
82:35 - because so much of it is done for you
82:38 - and then maybe have
82:40 - you could maybe possibly set a rule for
82:42 - yourself that you get the site build all
82:44 - the functionality done first
82:46 - before you style
82:49 - um
82:50 - and then that way
82:51 - you know maybe you won't get
82:53 - you know stuck
82:54 - in in that section so
82:57 - i'm not i'm not 100 sure that that's
82:59 - your issue but
83:02 - uh sometimes that that helps me
83:06 - just
83:07 - not get too caught up in designing first
83:10 - because you could end up designing for
83:12 - elements and features that don't even
83:14 - make it into your site
83:16 - and then it ends up being you
83:18 - know a waste of time i mean you always
83:21 - learn from it but
83:23 - you know it did would take up a lot of
83:25 - your time that could otherwise be used
83:27 - to
83:28 - you know add more functionality to your
83:30 - um to your project or
83:33 - you know do more testing and things so
83:36 - um
83:37 - hopefully that that helps
83:41 - all right that's that's it for the um
83:44 - for the live chat and uh we basically
83:47 - accomplished what we set out to which is
83:49 - awesome so
83:50 - uh i i was a little bit bold and i wrote
83:53 - in the description
83:54 - to the video
83:57 - it was either in the description of the
83:59 - video or in my tweet about it i wrote
84:01 - that i will be completing
84:03 - uh this uh scroll spy nav today
84:08 - so when i wrote it i thought like uh
84:10 - what if i don't complete it i'm gonna
84:12 - i'm gonna feel silly but we did we
84:14 - completed it so that's pretty cool
84:16 - um okay arthur has some follow-up here
84:19 - uh i read a lot of articles
84:22 - watch courses and sometimes don't create
84:24 - a single project yeah i like design and
84:26 - want my projects to look good i struggle
84:28 - mostly with layouts and responses
84:30 - yeah yeah arthur definitely check out
84:33 - some of the frameworks that i mentioned
84:35 - because it'll take care a lot of the
84:36 - respon of the responsiveness
84:39 - i mean it's good to know how that works
84:41 - and writing media queries and things but
84:43 - it's a type of thing that you really
84:44 - only only want to do from scratch once
84:46 - and then either copy what you did for
84:48 - other projects or use a framework
84:51 - because it can be tedious
84:53 - and i think unnecessarily tedious i
84:55 - don't think there's a lot of value in
84:57 - recreating a whole layout system every
85:01 - single time
85:02 - unless you're doing something really
85:03 - experimental um
85:06 - then it's better off just to use
85:08 - something pre-made in in that case uh
85:11 - something thoroughly tested you know
85:15 - um yeah and make sure
85:16 - really try to do projects i mean it
85:20 - i get into the same thing sometimes
85:21 - where
85:22 - i read a lot of stuff i watch courses
85:25 - and things like that
85:26 - but um
85:29 - uh try to make sure that you're also
85:31 - working on projects maybe split up your
85:33 - time
85:35 - to say like okay i'm gonna spend this
85:36 - much time each day working on a project
85:39 - even if it don't get anywhere like i'm
85:41 - i'm gonna give it a good try and then
85:43 - you can go to your your other resources
85:46 - because it's important to actually be
85:48 - the building
85:49 - as well
85:52 - all right arthur says thanks for
85:53 - answering you're welcome arthas i have
85:55 - that bad feeling do it from zero yeah
85:58 - don't worry nobody does it from zero
86:00 - don't worry about that i used to feel
86:02 - the same way um especially when i was
86:04 - learning like i gotta do it all from
86:06 - scratch
86:07 - but nobody does it from scratch like we
86:08 - were talking about earlier in the stream
86:10 - like
86:11 - if you're building a react project
86:13 - how much work has already been done by
86:15 - the react team at facebook like so much
86:18 - work there's no such thing as from
86:21 - scratch for a react developer
86:23 - um
86:24 - you know there's
86:26 - so in so many things it's not just react
86:29 - if you're using angular if you're using
86:31 - vue
86:32 - uh if you're using any type of testing
86:34 - you know framework uh you know whatever
86:38 - even if you're just using um
86:40 - some boilerplate html code like
86:43 - unless you wrote it yourself and are
86:45 - copying it from a
86:46 - former project like
86:48 - still so i mean we all we all build on
86:51 - uh what others have done
86:54 - and that's i think a good thing
86:56 - uh so
