00:00 - hey welcome to my Bommel course before
00:02 - we get started I first want to make sure
00:04 - that you're familiar with scrim ba scrim
00:06 - bow is this interactive platform that
00:07 - you're using you can record and edit
00:10 - other people's screencasts and see the
00:11 - changes in real times if I have a
00:13 - website here you can actually copy edit
00:16 - the code say let's say hello Roma save
00:21 - it and then that will be reflected in
00:22 - the browser so everything that I do here
00:25 - you can do it as well or copied and save
00:27 - it as your own all right this is my
00:29 - beaumont course and in it you're gonna
00:31 - learn how to use MoMA MoMA is a modern
00:34 - CSS framework from Jeremy Thomas who
00:36 - goes by Jake Adams it's based on flexbox
00:39 - and using MoMA we can describe our
00:41 - websites design using just classes
00:43 - flexbox is a newer CSS spec that makes
00:46 - sectioning and aligning more natural we
00:49 - don't need to know flexbox but it is how
00:51 - boma works behind the scenes and when I
00:53 - say classes what I mean is that instead
00:55 - of writing around a CSS per element you
00:58 - can use it predefined classes this is
01:00 - really what the bulk of boma is and with
01:02 - enough classes we can describe our
01:04 - websites design using just semantics
01:06 - so before we deconstruct what that means
01:09 - take a look at the icons that you see
01:11 - below with OMA we can prototype columns
01:13 - form elements components modifiers
01:16 - layout elements and elements themselves
01:18 - the way that we interact with a boma is
01:20 - first we use this template this is the
01:23 - standard template that you would use
01:25 - when you start to author any MoMA
01:26 - website I've added one line of code and
01:29 - this is so that we can understand our
01:31 - website it's just a CSS debugger if you
01:35 - want to enable it you can just uncomment
01:37 - this line and see that it looks a bit
01:39 - different we'll use that to make sure
01:41 - that our website is designed perfectly
01:45 - other than that this is where bulma is
01:48 - getting linked to our website and then
01:50 - this these are font awesome icons this
01:53 - will load it up into your website okay
01:55 - we were talking about classes before
01:57 - this area right over here
01:58 - well boma is styling classes for us and
02:01 - with enough classes we can make a really
02:03 - robust and response website this for
02:06 - example would create the website that
02:08 - I've been showing you so far which
02:10 - already out of the box is responsive
02:13 - doesn't mean a lot so far but it will
02:14 - going forward okay this is a boma
02:18 - website and it's one of the three
02:20 - websites that we're going to learn to
02:21 - make in these screencasts this is what
02:23 - it would look like on a mobile device
02:25 - and on the right a tablet device whereas
02:27 - this was the desktop and then we're
02:30 - going to learn how to make a beautiful
02:31 - blog I already created a course for this
02:34 - but this one will be using boma and will
02:36 - take a fraction of the time
02:37 - instead of 40 minutes you'll be able to
02:39 - do this in maybe 15 or so minutes then
02:43 - after that we're gonna make a launch
02:45 - page for a product here I've recreated
02:48 - the Tesla Roadster page this is not the
02:50 - actual page it's just my version of it
02:52 - it is responsive and that's how it would
02:54 - look on a mobile and a tablet device
02:56 - alright so this is pretty exciting stuff
02:58 - if you have any questions or comments
03:00 - you want to reach out to me you can
03:01 - click my face reach out to me on Twitter
03:03 - otherwise I think we're ready to get
03:05 - started alright I'll see you in the next
03:07 - screencast where we'll first build this
03:09 - website and then that will slowly turn
03:11 - into this one all right I'll see you
03:14 - there
03:19 - hey welcome back so in this screencast
03:21 - we're going to turn this website into
03:24 - this one this actually is a website and
03:26 - then we'll use this as a base to add
03:29 - some complexity and make it a bit
03:30 - prettier until we get all the way back
03:32 - up to our original slide which again is
03:34 - responsive so on a mobile device this
03:38 - and then as a tablet on the right
03:40 - alright so how do we begin just to start
03:43 - let me point out that we have a few
03:44 - folders and files ready to go I have our
03:47 - images that we use across all of our
03:49 - websites and then I have some of almost
03:51 - documentation this is by no means all of
03:54 - boma this is maybe 10 or 15% if I had to
03:57 - guess might be much less than that
03:59 - but the point is that way Poma works is
04:01 - that we have our classes and these
04:03 - classes usually follow some HTML
04:05 - contract and that means that our boma is
04:08 - pretty idiomatic and that another boma
04:10 - developer could look at our website and
04:12 - just by looking at these contracts
04:14 - understand our website so looking at our
04:17 - website this is the first thing that we
04:19 - see and in our code we have a section a
04:22 - better component that we could use
04:24 - instead of a section is a hero so
04:26 - section is more generic whereas hero
04:28 - signifies it's important it's the first
04:31 - thing that we see so now we don't have
04:35 - very much let's go ahead and look at the
04:37 - debugger and we can see that the element
04:42 - is occupying just a portion but by no
04:44 - means all the height so what we can do
04:46 - is hero has a modifier called is full
04:49 - height modifiers allowed to just modify
04:52 - some other class and in this case is
04:54 - full height is limited to hero you can't
04:57 - use it everywhere we're also going to
04:59 - add another modifier as background black
05:03 - turning off our debugger okay so often
05:07 - when you want to put something inside of
05:09 - a hero or a section you put a container
05:15 - we can see that the container is trying
05:18 - to create a space for us to put some
05:20 - content okay and then in our container
05:23 - I'm going to add a image so we're gonna
05:27 - add the image contract and put that
05:31 - right in here you might be wondering why
05:35 - do we need to specify the dimension what
05:37 - can happen is that the website will
05:39 - resize itself because the images are
05:41 - loading and images can occupy a
05:43 - different height when they're unloaded
05:44 - as opposed to when they are loaded and
05:46 - so to avoid this behavior you can just
05:48 - specify what the dimensions are so there
05:51 - are predefined dimensions but you can
05:53 - also use an aspect ratio if you need
05:55 - more generalized dimensions now in this
05:58 - case we don't actually need this because
06:00 - our website is so simple right and then
06:02 - we'll swap out image source with our
06:04 - actual logo so say voila or the light
06:07 - which was in here right there and then
06:10 - that's in our images folder so we're
06:14 - almost there we definitely need to
06:16 - constrain the width so I'll just add X
06:19 - width and we'll say maybe 512 pixels all
06:24 - right and then last we want to Center it
06:25 - so here I'm going to add a style tag
06:28 - this is how we can interpolate our own
06:31 - CSS with homeless or create a center
06:34 - class which is just a generic centering
06:36 - class and then justify content is for
06:41 - the horizontal centering so we do use
06:43 - Center as the value and then align items
06:45 - is for the vertical centering the center
06:48 - class will Center whatever element is
06:50 - inside of it so we'll go up one element
06:53 - and we'll put it in here and it's
06:56 - centered we'll turn off the debugger and
07:00 - now we have a responsive website albeit
07:04 - pretty boring that's it for this one in
07:07 - the next one we are going to add some
07:09 - columns and make it a bit more like an
07:11 - actual website all right I'll see you in
07:13 - the next screencast
07:19 - hey welcome back so this is the state of
07:22 - our website it's terrible and what we
07:25 - can do to make it a bit better we're
07:26 - going to add a section so this is the
07:28 - hero at the tops the first thing that
07:30 - you see underneath we have a section and
07:33 - so we pretty much know how to do that
07:34 - we'll add the columns class and then
07:36 - three columns
07:37 - now we'll add some text and then we're
07:39 - on our way first things first let's go
07:42 - to our Docs and then get these section
07:46 - that right here so let's get rid of our
07:49 - is full height see how that looks and
07:53 - then let's make these size a bit smaller
07:56 - so I'll reduce it by a factor of two
08:00 - it cool looks good and then now we're
08:04 - gonna add some columns they'll go back
08:07 - to the moment dock and then here's
08:10 - columns okay so we'll just put that
08:12 - there
08:14 - turn on the debugger and then let's take
08:16 - a look so we have a column a single
08:19 - column occupying pretty much the full
08:21 - containers with what if we had two
08:23 - columns it's pretty smart here and it
08:27 - can figure this out for us we don't
08:28 - actually need to state how many columns
08:30 - we desire we can pretty much just put it
08:32 - right in here so we know that we're
08:35 - going to have three so I'll just add one
08:37 - more and then we can add in some text
08:44 - and then we'll turn off the debugger
08:50 - it's not quite the same so what's going
08:52 - on you can see that there is an area
08:54 - around the text but the text here is
08:57 - occupying pretty much the full column
09:00 - there's no padding there's no margin
09:01 - let's take a closer look
09:04 - alright there's no gap so what's going
09:07 - on well what we can do is can add a
09:09 - container inside of here but instead of
09:11 - container when you use what's called a
09:14 - notification in a notification will give
09:16 - it this sort of gray style that you see
09:18 - here so we're going to wrap the text in
09:20 - a notification class
09:25 - and see that it's got some area around
09:28 - it now
09:32 - yeah all right looks good all right
09:37 - looks great now what's so cool about
09:39 - flexbox and boma and all this stuff is
09:42 - that it can do a lot of the heavy
09:44 - lifting for us so here's what I mean
09:46 - if I resize or it's already responsive
09:50 - we didn't actually need to do very much
09:52 - to do that and you're here responsive
09:54 - design you have to have media queries
09:56 - and then you have to understand how
09:57 - everything connects to each other but
09:59 - boma understands these ideas and pretty
10:01 - much takes out the labor for us so
10:04 - that's awesome it's optimized for
10:06 - tablets desktops and mobile devices out
10:08 - of the box now I want to point out that
10:10 - notification can be modified just like
10:13 - we used has background black before you
10:15 - can use other modifiers so for example I
10:17 - can do is primary and take a look how
10:21 - the text is white and the background is
10:23 - green whereas over here the text is
10:25 - black and the background is gray all
10:28 - right now the last thing is if we want
10:30 - to control the text we can add a
10:32 - modifier so we'll need to wrap this in
10:35 - its own paragraph is size so we can do
10:41 - you like is three and you can see it got
10:44 - really really big so much that it's
10:46 - overwhelming believe there's one through
10:48 - seven and what we use for now is five so
10:52 - just a bit bigger and that's it in the
10:58 - next screencast when I add those is
11:00 - primary and some others to make this
11:03 - really beautiful and then add a title
11:05 - for each of these columns all right I'll
11:07 - see you in the next screencast
11:14 - hey welcome back so this is the state of
11:17 - a website not bad but we're gonna
11:20 - improve it with some color so it'll look
11:21 - like this by the time that we're
11:23 - finished which I think looks a lot
11:24 - better so how do we do that how do we go
11:26 - from here there all right so we know we
11:28 - need to remove the background make this
11:31 - the color logo because that is a
11:32 - different one than it is here and then
11:34 - we can give the columns their own
11:37 - background and then add a title and then
11:39 - add a color to our notification all
11:42 - right so that is pretty straightforward
11:44 - okay so like we mentioned we'll get rid
11:46 - of the has background black it'll
11:50 - default to a white but now our logo is
11:53 - invisible so we can go to our images and
11:56 - then we're gonna swap out the white one
11:57 - for this one alright just like that nice
12:02 - that's a bit big so let's change that
12:05 - max width
12:08 - so now we don't have a partition between
12:11 - our hero and the section to make that
12:13 - more obvious let me point that out with
12:15 - the debugger so here we can see that
12:18 - there's a beginning and an end to the
12:20 - hero and the section to make that more
12:22 - obvious we need to add a color that's
12:24 - why this one looks a bit different so
12:29 - we'll go to section I'm gonna add has
12:31 - background and I'm gonna use light for
12:35 - this nice so now we have a problem we
12:39 - can't see our column from the section
12:42 - right we need to be able to separate
12:45 - these two so what we can do is add a
12:47 - modifier to our notification right here
12:50 - we can do is and then of the available
12:53 - ones we have I think there's info is
12:56 - linked and you have danger warning and
12:59 - primary right so these would all happen
13:01 - is before them so let's see what they
13:03 - look like just turning off the deep
13:07 - bugger
13:08 - so yeah link gives us a nice blue - feel
13:12 - free to experiment with these I'm going
13:14 - to use is info is primary and then is
13:17 - warning now let's really cool about
13:21 - using these thematic modifiers is they
13:23 - actually modify more than just the
13:25 - background take a look at the text the
13:27 - text has now altered firm black to white
13:29 - depending on which theme we're using so
13:31 - this is a really nice feature of OMA
13:33 - well we'll inverse the text in this case
13:36 - to make sure that it's readable if we
13:38 - force this to be a has text white right
13:42 - here
13:44 - it's not as readable as before so this
13:48 - is one of the things that boma is doing
13:49 - for us behind the scenes that I think is
13:51 - really cool now we only need to add a
13:53 - title so what we can do is we're going
13:55 - to add an H element so do h1 and then
13:58 - we'll do what was it oh yeah almost the
14:00 - first one and that does not look good
14:04 - that looks so inferior all right so
14:07 - let's attribute this so right now it's
14:09 - not getting anything from MoMA because
14:12 - it doesn't have a class so I'm going to
14:14 - give it a say title now we get something
14:17 - that stands out that's a bit big so I
14:19 - add a modifier to per title and we'll do
14:22 - is size to do I think one less yeah that
14:26 - looks good that's pretty quick right so
14:33 - Roma is doing a lot of the work for us
14:35 - now we're ready to move on to adding the
14:38 - columns that you see beneath all right
14:40 - I'll see you in the next screencast
14:47 - hey welcome back so our website looks
14:49 - like this which is alright I mean it's a
14:52 - bit boring but what we can do is
14:53 - beautify it so we're gonna give it some
14:55 - pecans and then another section and then
14:57 - that section will have its own cut icons
14:59 - that have a color and then the title and
15:01 - the paragraph will hug each other here
15:03 - so how do we do this
15:04 - we're gonna go to the boma documentation
15:07 - and we're gonna grab two classes we need
15:09 - the media class which is like a Facebook
15:13 - post or a Twitter post
15:15 - and then we need to grab the actual icon
15:18 - class which is here all right and I'm
15:23 - going to put that right in here we have
15:27 - our media left which is this area over
15:29 - here and then inside of it we need to
15:31 - put the icon class which is what we did
15:33 - here okay and then our content well we
15:36 - already have content it's here so we're
15:38 - just going to insert that right here and
15:43 - that's really it so let's go ahead and
15:47 - refactor this combine our notification
15:50 - with the media class so we'll do media
15:52 - notification and then all we need to do
15:55 - is we'll make this article this article
15:58 - and then we'll get rid of this guy
16:03 - alright so let's see how this looks got
16:08 - the wrong icon but it's a start the icon
16:10 - that will actually use is this one and I
16:13 - didn't memorize that that is coming from
16:14 - an awesome com so that's where we get
16:16 - the codes for the font awesome icons and
16:19 - we don't want this to have a color so we
16:21 - can just get rid of that for now our
16:23 - icon is appearing as white because of
16:26 - his info and that's pretty interesting
16:30 - if I put is warning the icon goes black
16:33 - that's a really nice feature to make the
16:35 - icon bigger we can add a modifier here
16:37 - let's say FA LG for large and you also
16:41 - have 2x and then every X and there's
16:44 - probably more so with you 2x for now I
16:47 - think that's the right size yeah that
16:49 - looks really good now if you want it to
16:51 - have more of an area around the icon
16:53 - I'll show you what I mean yeah that box
16:56 - is like really narrow it doesn't have
16:57 - that sort of nice area around it an easy
17:00 - way to fix that is we can add a modifier
17:02 - to the icon class of is medium or as
17:06 - large or try it as large yeah so that
17:10 - red definitely makes a difference and
17:12 - then let's turn off the bugger so it's a
17:16 - bit big let's just make that is medium
17:19 - instead cool yeah so that's really all
17:23 - there is to making this a media class
17:26 - who's gonna paste in the results pepper
17:32 - use act code that we wrote before just
17:34 - copied and pasted and yeah the rest of
17:37 - it is really the same thing so let's go
17:39 - ahead and just take all of this copy and
17:41 - paste it again
17:46 - all right and we know that we're gonna
17:47 - have six instead of three so we're gonna
17:51 - repeat the column so instead we have six
17:53 - columns and that does not look good so
17:57 - we need to fix this how do we how do we
18:00 - fix that so we can add a few things for
18:03 - every column we need to say it's one
18:05 - third there's a whole bunch of modifiers
18:07 - in use here we're gonna use is one third
18:09 - and then this will basically force each
18:11 - column to occupy one third of the
18:14 - website's width so we just repeat that
18:16 - process and then let's see how that
18:21 - looks
18:23 - all right that's a bit better but it's
18:25 - definitely on at the same line which is
18:27 - not ideal hope you had another modifier
18:30 - called
18:31 - is multi-line and then this will force
18:33 - it to break Thanks
18:35 - now you probably know what to do here
18:37 - right what do we what's left we can get
18:40 - rid of the background for the whole
18:42 - section the notification doesn't need to
18:45 - have a color now it's great okay so
18:49 - let's just go ahead and force that so we
18:51 - say it has that ground white in our
18:56 - paragraph to make these hug to make this
18:58 - hug the title you can just give the
19:00 - class of subtitle now finally we're just
19:04 - gonna make this a little smaller and
19:06 - then get rid of this space around the
19:08 - icon we can give it a color by doing has
19:14 - text let's say warning I'm gonna go and
19:18 - paste in the results and then we'll load
19:20 - that up and what up it's really that
19:23 - cool and it's all responsive which is
19:26 - really amazing because we didn't we
19:28 - didn't even need to code that right one
19:30 - was doing all of this for us so bomb was
19:32 - really incredible at rapidly prototyping
19:34 - and shipping websites quickly and then
19:37 - coming up we're going to learn how to on
19:39 - the blog I'll see you in the next
19:41 - screencast
19:47 - hey welcome back so you just finished
19:49 - your first Bulma website and that's
19:51 - really amazing just how much fun looking
19:53 - new for you you think about it you did
19:55 - responsive beautiful website design
19:57 - without even touching was it any CSS
20:00 - like it was it's like for hot it's like
20:03 - five lines of CSS so bomb was really a
20:06 - powerhouse here and understanding and
20:08 - mastering boma can really I mean the
20:11 - thing is even if you don't use boa in
20:12 - production it can teach you how Jeremy
20:15 - or Jake Adams might solve a problem
20:16 - using boma and I think that's pretty
20:18 - amazing all right let's start up our new
20:21 - website this is going to be a blog and
20:23 - to start you'll note that we have this
20:25 - little breadcrumb at the top so let's go
20:27 - ahead and paste that in one of the
20:29 - components that we can use is the bread
20:32 - crumb so it's right here note that we're
20:34 - starting with the section in the
20:35 - container if we're not starting with the
20:37 - hero it makes sense that we would start
20:38 - with a section instead alright so put
20:41 - that right here and then let's take a
20:43 - look and it doesn't do anything because
20:48 - it's empty so I'm just filling with
20:50 - values
20:53 - all right so that looks really great now
20:55 - let's go ahead and open it up and it's
20:58 - okay but in our design here the contents
21:01 - pretty narrow so how do we how do we
21:03 - change that so I couldn't find a hundred
21:05 - percent idiomatic way to do this with
21:07 - bulma's so instead I relied on CSS grid
21:09 - so now we're going to learn how to embed
21:12 - CSS grid into boma and so here's what we
21:15 - can do create a grid class which
21:18 - requires it need display grid then when
21:21 - a template three columns because you can
21:23 - imagine that this website is really just
21:25 - three columns the container is the
21:28 - reason that this doesn't go all the way
21:29 - to the edge of the web page that's why
21:31 - we have a gap here but if we just ignore
21:33 - that gap we basically have a small
21:35 - column a bigger column and then a
21:37 - another small column over here well what
21:40 - we can do
21:41 - grid template columns and we're going to
21:45 - divide our website into thirds to start
21:47 - so we've new one if our one if our one
21:49 - fr fr stands for a fraction unit so now
21:52 - our websites being divided into thirds
21:54 - anywhere we put the grid class this one
21:57 - okay now we need to be pretty explicit
21:59 - here because if we just use grid as it
22:02 - is the content will fall into this
22:04 - column so because almost always the
22:06 - content falls into this column we just
22:09 - need to be explicit about that you
22:11 - belong to the second before the third
22:14 - column I want the content to start here
22:17 - and then end here so the syntax is two
22:20 - over three and then we can just put the
22:24 - grid here because of our content is
22:27 - inside of this div we put the grid here
22:30 - and the asterisk is referring to
22:33 - anything inside of the grid that would
22:35 - include this nav that will inherit this
22:38 - grid com rule okay so we go ahead and
22:40 - load this up our websites divided into
22:42 - thirds now with the content occupying
22:44 - just the center column it's a bit too
22:46 - narrow so what we can do instead is
22:47 - we'll give this a fixed width all right
22:51 - that's great
22:51 - and let's turn on the debugger so if we
22:55 - make this responsive oh and I forgot it
22:58 - off right there okay all right so
23:01 - looking with the debugger see this
23:03 - little these white lines right here well
23:05 - that's because our column
23:06 - is too wide on a mobile device it can't
23:09 - be 624 pixels that might be wider than
23:12 - the screen and say this is a responsive
23:15 - column with a minimum and a maximum
23:17 - width anywhere from 0 to 624 pixels so
23:21 - now you'll note that we don't get that
23:23 - side effect so that's great all right
23:25 - how we how do we get these bigger images
23:28 - if you look on a mobile device you'll
23:30 - note that they occupy the full width
23:32 - whereas on a desktop device
23:34 - it's just occupying most of the width so
23:37 - remember the reason we have this gap
23:38 - here is because of the container given
23:41 - that what's called this column medium
23:44 - and I can update this it's really
23:46 - amazing that grid is that subtle and
23:48 - then now if I wanted to refer to all
23:50 - three columns which is pretty much what
23:52 - this design is these images are spanning
23:55 - all three columns then I'll just create
23:57 - another identifier and then here I'll
24:00 - use Excel okay and then to use our new
24:05 - excel identifiers I need to create a
24:07 - class so that we can give a specific
24:09 - element say for example nav occupy all
24:12 - three columns and not just the the
24:14 - center medium column
24:16 - so now I wanted our nav to occupy all
24:19 - three columns I can just give it the
24:21 - class of grid Excel wait a minute what's
24:26 - what's going on we've got this gap right
24:27 - here well that's actually boma trying to
24:30 - help us out almost trying to make
24:31 - everything pretty but in this case it's
24:33 - adding padding and we don't want it it's
24:35 - interrupting the design what we can do
24:37 - this would new is padding less here so
24:41 - this tells the section to not have its
24:43 - own padding there we go
24:44 - right now it's occupying all three so
24:47 - that's great and let's go ahead and turn
24:49 - this off and now it's just occupying the
24:53 - the content column it looks like we can
24:55 - keep the vertical padding it's just the
24:57 - horizontal padding that that we don't
24:58 - care for so let's go ahead and make our
25:01 - own class because it doesn't exist in
25:03 - Omaha but we'll just make it real quick
25:04 - so we say is padding less horizontal
25:06 - we'd say padding left I mean right right
25:13 - okay and then let's see what happens
25:15 - oh I just realized we mistyped hang on
25:21 - okay it's better now all right so we
25:24 - created the class and now it's occupying
25:26 - the full width which is really really
25:28 - what we want we want to have a hundred
25:29 - percent control of the layout in this
25:32 - case now we're gonna have a problem
25:35 - which is our content doesn't hug the
25:37 - wall but our image does ooh how do we do
25:40 - with that well it's actually pretty
25:42 - subtle something has the class of grid
25:44 - excel we just don't care about it but in
25:46 - general we want it to have a small
25:49 - gutter so the way that we can do this is
25:51 - very subtle right we put a extra column
25:54 - right here and right here now no matter
25:58 - what there will always be a 1.5 RM which
26:02 - valuates - I think 24 pixels there
26:04 - always be a gutter to the left and the
26:06 - right of our content column and then the
26:08 - one if R is just the the remainder space
26:11 - so check this out it's really it's
26:14 - really amazing right so we load up the
26:16 - web page and now we've got that gutter
26:21 - so so that's good and then we go ahead
26:23 - and put grid excel and then it's gone so
26:27 - it's really that easy for us to define
26:29 - the
26:30 - laying out using CSS grid and still
26:32 - embed it into our boma so we get the
26:34 - benefits of both CSS grid and OMA next
26:37 - we're going to learn how to make this
26:38 - author thing at the top and then we'll
26:40 - make the title and I'll see you in the
26:42 - next screencast
26:47 - hey you will come back ooh now that
26:50 - we're code gods we're ready to ready to
26:52 - move on and we're gonna start with the
26:54 - title of these all right the author at
26:56 - the top then we're gonna do the the
26:58 - title under that so how do we how do we
27:00 - do this well if you recognize a pattern
27:02 - here that's good we're going to use the
27:04 - media class the media component again
27:07 - because it makes simple how do we do the
27:09 - icon or the image at the at the left and
27:12 - then a title and then a paragraph to the
27:14 - right so one difference though is that
27:17 - we're gonna have this icon or the image
27:19 - in the center right
27:21 - you can't hit here but if we had
27:22 - multiple lines we would still want that
27:24 - image to be centered so we'll learn how
27:26 - to do that too and we're ready to go
27:29 - ahead and grab the media component and
27:35 - one thing is that this will belong in
27:36 - its own section so we'll grab that too
27:44 - all right
27:45 - and then one thing that we'll want to do
27:49 - is it's pretty much safe to assume that
27:53 - we can use this again and we can use
27:58 - grid here again as well if we wanted to
28:01 - refactor this we could go into here and
28:03 - then make a rule for section to
28:05 - automatically get rid of the padding
28:08 - left in the padding right so that we
28:09 - didn't have to put it here every time
28:11 - but for now I'm just gonna put that like
28:12 - this so here we go right here we're
28:17 - gonna put an image so I'll grab the
28:19 - class for that component for that do
28:21 - this one all right there I change this
28:27 - to 64 by 64 and there isn't a class for
28:33 - every size it's just that this is
28:35 - there's a few predefined classes 64 is
28:37 - one of them so I'm not there's not like
28:39 - a 65 by 65 and so on and so forth all
28:42 - right and then here we'll swap out the
28:44 - image new images and we're gonna grab
28:47 - the which one was it me me me me me me
28:52 - me JPEG okay great now for the content
28:57 - the content what we'll do is put this in
29:00 - a paragraph
29:01 - and then let's see we got zenok okay so
29:08 - let's put that in real quick all right
29:11 - so we have a strong tag to make a bold
29:13 - we have a link that goes nowhere right
29:15 - now then I'm gonna force the text this
29:19 - text to be gray so to do that I've got
29:21 - it wrapped inside of a span and then
29:23 - I've given it the class it has text
29:25 - grade to just force to be a bit lighter
29:27 - then I'm just using a break to break to
29:30 - the next line because it belongs to the
29:32 - same paragraph and then here this is
29:35 - definitely recommended we're using the
29:37 - time element so that search engines can
29:39 - basically document when this when the
29:41 - intended publication date was so for
29:44 - this I've just put the same date as I
29:46 - have that I published this article so
29:48 - that was April April 20th all right and
29:52 - the rest is pretty simple by the way
29:54 - this is not the bullet character it's
29:57 - actually I think I'm saying a right
29:59 - interpunct right this is an octave
30:03 - thorpe so alright wait so let's see how
30:08 - this looks nice now you'll note if you
30:12 - are OCD like me that the image is not in
30:15 - the center right we've got that little
30:17 - gap and Neath but not above so how do we
30:19 - deal with that to feel a little while to
30:21 - figure this out
30:21 - but it's pretty simple we're gonna make
30:23 - a general use class that we can use and
30:26 - I'm gonna call it Center which this will
30:29 - use flexbox
30:30 - so we just got flex here and then I'm
30:32 - going to Center horizontally and
30:34 - vertically if you were asleep earlier we
30:37 - did this like a few screencasts ago so
30:38 - this really isn't anything new
30:41 - do where do we put that know where we
30:44 - can actually put it as right here the
30:47 - reason is is because we're going to
30:48 - Center
30:49 - not just the figure but the text too
30:50 - because the text is taller than the
30:53 - figure the text will not actually have a
30:55 - gap above or beneath it but because the
30:57 - figure is shorter than the text the
30:59 - figure will have a gap above and beneath
31:01 - it now huh all right we'll turn out the
31:04 - debugger and that's one problem solved
31:07 - but we have one more not this huge gap
31:10 - up here and you might like that
31:12 - I don't so the way that we deal with
31:14 - that again is the padding here because
31:17 - we've started a new section Balma
31:20 - basically said hey I think I want you to
31:22 - have some padding - where's gonna be
31:24 - lips it's gonna be a little dirty here
31:27 - and just can mine that out all right so
31:32 - now we've got that nice even gap above
31:34 - and below the nav and then the other
31:37 - part really looks ideal now on for the
31:42 - title I don't know that this is the most
31:45 - idiomatic way to do this it's just sort
31:47 - of what I worked out and put something
31:51 - inside of a div ID of it we'll do an h1
31:54 - and h2 remember I want to give this
32:00 - style and give them a class of title and
32:05 - subtitle
32:07 - remember there's modifiers to change the
32:10 - size so I'll have this Cascade I'll do
32:12 - is - and then is 3 and here do how to
32:18 - build yeah that's great let's take a
32:21 - look Oh
32:25 - so when I came up with was this well we
32:28 - know that sections will go ahead and
32:30 - give us some padding why don't we just
32:33 - use a section class here we don't need
32:35 - to use the section element because
32:37 - that's not semantically correct
32:39 - this isn't really a new section but we
32:41 - can borrow the properties from section
32:43 - to style this very consistently so I
32:47 - just grab this
32:53 - and voila alright let's see how it looks
32:57 - on a mobile device not bad
33:00 - we'll do some things later to make the
33:02 - text appear a little bit smaller so that
33:04 - it fits better but other than that it
33:06 - looks great alright in the next
33:08 - screencast we're going to figure out how
33:10 - to do our images which are gorgeous and
33:12 - then we're going to go and do the
33:13 - content in the screencast after all
33:16 - right I will see you very very soon
33:23 - hey welcome back we've got this
33:26 - beautiful blog design and now we're
33:28 - ready for these really nice images so
33:31 - what's that about well what we can do is
33:34 - go to the docs and we're gonna grab the
33:37 - columns like we used before yeah
33:40 - and then looking here I've got three so
33:43 - do three columns we're going to do three
33:49 - columns so do okay we have our three
33:54 - columns inside of each column there's
33:57 - going to be an image which could be a
33:59 - link it could be just an image that's
34:01 - fine and then we'll have a caption at
34:03 - the bottom alright so we'll grab the
34:05 - image class and then that goes inside of
34:08 - each of these I will remove this guy
34:12 - from now and then with you up three
34:15 - images right here it's gonna be blog one
34:17 - through three okay let's see what
34:21 - happens
34:22 - all right hang on right images yeah ooh
34:29 - yeah it's okay so we forgot to make this
34:34 - a grid excel right how's that look
34:38 - hey looks okay so one thing that we can
34:42 - do in boma is use the remember how we
34:45 - use notification before to give sort of
34:47 - a background well there's a few more
34:48 - that we can use there's box and card I
34:51 - really like card so we use it here and
34:53 - that'll give us that little nice line
34:55 - and a very very subtle shadow beneath it
34:58 - so that's the effect that we have here
35:00 - all right and then I'll just add a card
35:02 - to each of these yeah so you've got this
35:08 - gap which is a bit weird and then we had
35:11 - this other problem we're on a mobile
35:13 - device we probably would like this in
35:16 - general but for images we just want it
35:19 - to be wide the whole time okay let's go
35:22 - and get rid of the gap first so there's
35:25 - a feature called is variable which has
35:27 - its own modifier I think it's like one
35:29 - through a few maybe one two three four
35:31 - and if we use zero that will turn off
35:33 - the gap now if I want to increase that
35:36 - just
35:37 - little bit one or two or three let's do
35:39 - two yeah so this is a really nice
35:42 - feature if you don't want to completely
35:43 - remove it just partly remove it all
35:46 - right so we're gonna make this zero and
35:49 - yeah that looks really cool how do we
35:53 - deal with this there's another modifier
35:56 - that we can use for columns because
35:58 - columns are such an essential component
36:00 - God is mobile I want you to keep your
36:03 - aesthetic whether you're on a mobile or
36:04 - a desktop device really quite simple and
36:09 - again the reason that this isn't going
36:12 - full with here is because of the
36:13 - container if we really didn't like that
36:17 - it wouldn't be hard for us to just
36:18 - remove it all right and let's go ahead
36:21 - and add a figure caption below do you
36:25 - think caption a caption you know what
36:30 - I'm gonna make this a figure so that
36:31 - it's easier and then we can just make
36:34 - these good as for now instead now I want
36:37 - this to be small and Volman eise's that
36:39 - so no problem and then what was the text
36:42 - it was like that and you don't need to
36:46 - quit because you're already here good
36:48 - stewards of the Internet let's gonna
36:49 - make these links that go nowhere okay
36:52 - and then over here
36:54 - let's who happens so okay I think we
36:59 - know what we can do right we could put
37:00 - the class center here all of our
37:03 - problems go away yeah that's not bad and
37:06 - then let's just see how this would look
37:07 - with some content beneath it so just do
37:09 - you like yeah right we need a we need a
37:17 - we need some we need some space there so
37:19 - what we needs is because this doesn't
37:21 - belong to boma boma isn't giving us any
37:24 - any special treatment
37:25 - instead the Bommel way to do this might
37:28 - be to use level allows you to align
37:32 - content along level this is just
37:34 - indicating that anything in it needs to
37:37 - belong anywhere on the left the center
37:38 - or the right and then here I can make
37:42 - this a level item now basically saying I
37:45 - want this thing to be a level and then
37:47 - we have one item so this should be
37:48 - centered and because the
37:50 - belongs to MoMA he knows how to give us
37:52 - that breathing room that we so desire
37:54 - right before the concent was hugging it
37:56 - and that was an ideal yeah so we now we
38:01 - had that little space right there and
38:05 - then let's make the text a little bit
38:07 - lighter du has text gray and then the
38:14 - last thing is there's for me I'm really
38:17 - picky though I don't want this gap right
38:18 - here well if we inspect it eventually
38:21 - we'll find that that is a margin being
38:23 - applied so it's a market being applied
38:25 - to the columns what we can do is just
38:27 - say remember we use is penniless before
38:30 - well here I use is marginalists oh yeah
38:35 - that looks so cool and of course it's
38:39 - all responsive yeah all right I'll see
38:42 - you in the next screencast where we add
38:44 - this content and then we'll add a rule
38:46 - to make this a little bit smaller on a
38:48 - mobile device so that the content fits a
38:50 - bit better alright see you soon
38:58 - welcome back Internet now we're ready to
39:00 - add the content of our blog it'd be a
39:02 - pretty terrible blog we just kept it as
39:05 - is and it's beautiful but it's kind of
39:07 - useless so what we can do is in the
39:10 - documentation there is a class that we
39:13 - can use called content and you my friend
39:16 - have seen this before
39:18 - voila right you've seen this now content
39:22 - didn't do anything for us at the time
39:24 - because we just had a boring old
39:25 - paragraph but now we're gonna start to
39:27 - understand really how powerful content
39:29 - is and content becomes especially
39:32 - relevant if you want to use markdown in
39:35 - your websites because doing on these
39:37 - attributes all the time can be a bit
39:39 - annoying sometimes you just want the
39:41 - element to describe the content and for
39:43 - that to be enough and so content is a
39:45 - great example of this so let's do an h1
39:49 - view and h2 right
39:52 - so note these don't have the title or
39:55 - the subtitle that we've used before
39:56 - which was necessary when we wanted to
39:59 - give this the style here these are just
40:01 - naked HTML elements when we load them up
40:04 - note that they do have a style and
40:06 - that's because content is helping us out
40:08 - here content is really magical because
40:11 - we basically don't have to worry about
40:14 - any of the trivial elements that we
40:16 - might want to use it's good for
40:17 - paragraphs for for lists whether they're
40:20 - ordered or unordered you've got your h's
40:22 - that i've showed you before we've got
40:23 - block quotes and even tables it's pretty
40:26 - awesome I'm gonna grab a really complete
40:29 - example from the website super complete
40:32 - and I'll show you what I mean
40:34 - wait there are no funny classes right I
40:38 - mean even have stuff like this where
40:41 - there's it's it's super right and then
40:43 - here we've got the sub four I mean it
40:45 - stands for so maybe submarine I don't
40:47 - know what that stands for okay well
40:49 - let's take a look whoa what so look at
40:53 - that right our blog is really gorgeous
40:57 - and we have to do so little work to get
41:00 - there now this let me just point that
41:02 - out that is my tabs screwing with the
41:04 - source code so here this is wrapped in a
41:08 - pre which means basically pre process
41:11 - don't cross us this text you want to
41:13 - have that hug the left wall where
41:14 - there's no no space to the left then
41:18 - that extra space we can fix that like
41:22 - that at least that's one way to fix it
41:25 - I'm sure there are others anyway this is
41:27 - really powerful the rate boma has done
41:30 - so much heavy lifting for us and all we
41:33 - had to use is HTML
41:34 - I think Tim berners-lee would be like
41:36 - extremely proud right now so anyway for
41:39 - for our website I'm gonna go ahead and
41:41 - just get rid of this instead I'll put
41:45 - the content yeah now check this out this
41:51 - is also why content is so powerful the
41:54 - content can scale so we can have medium
41:57 - content we can download content contents
42:02 - pretty miraculous I mean you can have
42:04 - different paragraphs in your website
42:06 - have different sizes and that's not just
42:08 - true for text it's true for all those
42:11 - elements that I showed you just a moment
42:13 - ago so boma is really freaking magical
42:15 - let's say you wanted to do like is large
42:18 - notification that's a really simple
42:23 - example of how we combine different bola
42:25 - moment classes to make like an
42:28 - advertisement or like a banner and then
42:31 - let's say we want to like style it right
42:34 - it's really crazy how powerful boma is
42:37 - anyway
42:38 - let's go ahead and just leave that - I
42:41 - think this medium was good and that's it
42:44 - this is how you make a beautiful blog
42:46 - you know in a responsive sense it's not
42:49 - optimized I mean it is mobile but the
42:51 - text is a bit big so I'll show you a
42:54 - fascinatingly simple way that we can we
42:56 - can fix that make a media query which
43:00 - means I want you to override some code
43:02 - in this circumstance and the
43:04 - circumstance if we're rendering our
43:06 - website at some max width then consider
43:09 - the following rules so I'll say I want
43:11 - my route element to update its font size
43:13 - from the default of 16 pixels to say
43:17 - like - like 414 let's just do a percent
43:22 - be like 90 percent 100 percent would be
43:24 - 16 pixel
43:25 - here 90% with not 14 but definitely
43:29 - easier on the eyes and then the
43:31 - circumstance is when I get to right here
43:35 - so we know that this is 624 and I need
43:41 - some way to say 624 plus these guys so I
43:46 - can say plus 1.5 REM so remember one REM
43:51 - is 16 pixels so 1.5 REM is 24 pixels and
43:57 - then we knew times 248 and then we do 6
44:01 - 24 plus 48 and then we can say 6 72
44:05 - pixels all right now when we get to that
44:10 - when we cross over from a desktop or a
44:13 - tablet device to what we're calling a
44:15 - mobile device we get a slight update and
44:19 - everything that is defined with an e/m
44:21 - or in rem as its unit will also
44:23 - proportionally change to its really
44:26 - powerful if we wanted to go even further
44:30 - totally possible to that's it you've
44:34 - made a beautiful blog in like record
44:36 - time and it's ence responsive and we
44:39 - have like what the team lines of code
44:42 - it's crazy
44:43 - yeah so that's amazing now we're gonna
44:47 - go all the way up to a launch page I
44:50 - have stolen the Tesla Roadster page and
44:52 - then made it our own using boma believe
44:54 - it or not this will also be responsive
44:56 - and we're gonna do it with again very
44:59 - little code all right enough talk let's
45:01 - get into it
45:02 - I'll see you in the next screencast
45:09 - hey welcome back I'm pretty excited I'm
45:12 - not gonna say much about this we're just
45:14 - gonna get started alright so we're gonna
45:16 - use a hero I'm gonna drop the hero body
45:20 - I'm just gonna start with that alright
45:25 - let's take a look with the debugger
45:26 - turned on and ah it's not occupying any
45:30 - height so for that we can do is full
45:34 - height remember we do that pretty
45:36 - recently when we were designing this
45:38 - webpage here we have its full height and
45:40 - then here we just removed it so for this
45:43 - website you can imagine that we just
45:45 - have a hero and it has a modifier of is
45:47 - full height okay let's take a look now
45:50 - it's a darker color right if I remove
45:52 - that it's a little lighter and that's
45:56 - because it's a darker color on top of
45:58 - our whole website that being the hero
46:00 - okay
46:01 - so we can start to fill in the
46:02 - background so in our images we've got
46:05 - one two and three and we're going to use
46:07 - multiple images because we want our
46:10 - website to look different on a mobile or
46:12 - a tablet device so this is actually a
46:16 - different image than this one I mean
46:17 - it's the same picture but they've the
46:20 - the tesla team has edited it so that
46:22 - it's optimized for a mobile or a tablet
46:24 - device I'm going to do the same here so
46:28 - all we need to do is target the hero I
46:30 - want to say you have a background and
46:33 - Lee a background of images and then 0 1
46:37 - right see what happens
46:40 - oh hang on the debugger is overriding
46:45 - the background yeah the first time this
46:48 - happened I thought my screen was dirty
46:50 - yeah it's the pictures huge right so we
46:54 - need to let's Center it all right so we
47:00 - need to go a bit further when you use
47:02 - something called cover which means I
47:04 - want this image to basically want the
47:06 - image to fit inside of our websites
47:08 - browser yeah that looks really good and
47:13 - it is responsive in a sense but the
47:16 - problem is is that on mobile devices
47:18 - it's just too narrow we we can't see the
47:20 - car it just doesn't look ideal
47:22 - so to fix that what we can do is use a
47:25 - media query actual Renee is two that are
47:28 - max that are max with is a thousand 24
47:31 - pixels or we're 768 pixels then wanted
47:38 - to display a different background and we
47:41 - just update that let's take a look hey
47:45 - we move a yeah
47:46 - missing the hero okay yeah so that
47:53 - actually does look better
47:54 - right alright so there is the desktop
47:58 - right and we get to a tablet changes a
48:01 - little bit and then on a mobile device
48:03 - that changes even more so the point is
48:05 - that these images are optimized for
48:07 - different devices and that's great we'll
48:11 - get a better experience as a result now
48:14 - you might have noticed when I was
48:16 - changing the the widths you might have
48:18 - seen it like a flash of white well
48:20 - that's because the background behind the
48:22 - image will default to white if we're not
48:25 - explicit we want that to be black which
48:27 - i think is a bit more a bit more brand
48:31 - we can just do this and while we're
48:35 - waiting for an image to load as we're
48:37 - changing the width we'll get a stroke of
48:39 - black yeah so now we get like a stroke
48:42 - of black if our image is still loading
48:44 - which i think is just a little bit
48:46 - better than white so that's it for this
48:49 - screencast and the next one will focus
48:50 - on the the navigation bar at the top
48:53 - which of course will be mobile but in a
48:57 - different sense we're gonna hide some
48:58 - content in the event that we're on a
49:00 - mobile device all right I'll see you
49:01 - very soon
49:07 - hey welcome back now we're going to add
49:09 - that nap bar at the top and it's going
49:11 - to require some extra CSS so I have
49:14 - these helpers here and we're going to
49:16 - link to them like this so it's not that
49:20 - different than the way that we've linked
49:21 - our debugger it's actually the same but
49:24 - looking at our helpers we have a few
49:26 - things that we need to add in order to
49:28 - make this work
49:29 - you're familiar with Center that's
49:30 - nothing new but now instead of just
49:32 - centering an element inside of another
49:35 - one when you put it at the top the right
49:37 - the bottom and the left so that's nice
49:39 - and we have this special case where by
49:42 - default Flex Direction sets to row and
49:47 - in the event that we want it to set to
49:49 - column then we can just use center
49:51 - column instead might be wondering what
49:54 - the heck does that mean well looking at
49:56 - this the elements are following each
49:59 - other across a row whereas here they're
50:02 - following each other across a column so
50:04 - this is an example where if we want the
50:06 - elements to fall vertically we can say
50:09 - Center column and that will still Center
50:12 - Center the element inside of a column
50:14 - all right these just make this stuff
50:16 - work and then down here this is how we
50:19 - can have a single single space text and
50:22 - here this is if we want to hide
50:24 - something if we're on a mobile device so
50:28 - at a thousand 24 pixels anything that
50:31 - has a class of desktop I want it to just
50:33 - disappear all right so now we can add
50:35 - that nav bar and to do that we're gonna
50:37 - go into our Docs if I want to grab this
50:39 - guy instead of body we're going to use
50:43 - head here okay now the way that I
50:47 - thought of this design is to have this
50:50 - split into three columns so I have the
50:52 - left the center and then the right
50:53 - column over here we know how to do that
50:56 - just go to grab the columns and then we
50:58 - put that there and we know we'll have
51:01 - three so I'll just put this like this
51:04 - now remember when we're on a mobile
51:07 - device it's gonna stack the columns so
51:09 - to fix that we can just put is mobile
51:11 - and I found that if we put is margin
51:14 - list it'll look a lot prettier right
51:16 - it's just very simple now so now I'm
51:20 - going to fill in the valley
51:21 - with some texts for now this hey cool so
51:28 - our elements are falling vertically and
51:31 - we don't want that we effectively want
51:33 - them to fall horizontally if you
51:35 - remember a moment ago one of our helpers
51:37 - well these helpers do that because flex
51:41 - direction is set to row by default
51:43 - that's exactly what we want in fact we
51:46 - can just leave that there and it won't
51:47 - do anything at all I'll just put the
51:51 - center here and that actually centers
51:56 - the elements inside of their parent easy
51:59 - enough we can just make that left and
52:00 - right cool
52:03 - it's looking better now to deal with the
52:05 - fact that the text is just too close I
52:07 - found that there is a class just for
52:11 - this purpose so use nav bar found that
52:15 - there's a class to do with this so
52:18 - commute now our item mount will space it
52:21 - out real nicely so we just put that
52:23 - everywhere
52:25 - hey great this is looking phenomenal now
52:29 - on a mobile device we still have the
52:31 - trouble of having all this data so the
52:33 - way that we can deal with it is we'll
52:35 - just put desktop here remember remember
52:38 - that's this one here saying at thousand
52:41 - 24 pixels or less hide the content
52:43 - instead of putting it here for it for
52:45 - shop and sign-in
52:49 - we want to keep this button here so
52:51 - instead you can put desktop there and
52:59 - that was really easy okay
53:03 - now really all that's left is just style
53:05 - so all that's really left is basically
53:08 - the icon and then the style so the style
53:11 - is actually pretty easy everything is a
53:14 - heading and it has a text weight of fold
53:18 - we also want the text to be black and I
53:21 - found I can't just put has text black
53:24 - here it doesn't work so instead we're
53:27 - gonna be a bit lazy and just put it
53:30 - right here so again if we wanted to we
53:33 - could just refactor this in the style or
53:35 - even go all the way to Beaumont and
53:37 - customize it for our needs but for now
53:39 - just do it this way alright that's
53:44 - looking really good let's swap out the
53:46 - text here and the text here with the
53:49 - right image and icon so we know so for
53:55 - so we're familiar enough so we're
53:58 - familiar enough with how to do that
53:59 - so we know how to do that we just grab
54:01 - that and we go to here and I want to
54:07 - keep our item and I don't need will link
54:13 - our logo
54:16 - which is right here and you'll note that
54:21 - it's gonna be like crazy it's because
54:23 - it's rendering the SVG's height and
54:26 - width and not the desired height and
54:28 - width I'm just gonna inline this for now
54:32 - and we can say height one REM which kind
54:36 - of works but the width is still way too
54:38 - big you can see that here but a fix that
54:43 - I worked out that the width to the
54:45 - height was six point two five that's
54:48 - great and now we just need to deal with
54:51 - the hamburger so we just copied that put
54:54 - it here and then there is a font awesome
54:57 - icon for this now you'll note that the
55:03 - text is grayish so should we say it has
55:08 - text black and let's just make sure it's
55:12 - all good
55:13 - you might be wondering why is the height
55:16 - changing so again what we'll do is we
55:19 - can give it a fixed width and height
55:23 - make it one two one and let's take a
55:26 - look so we got the the boundaries right
55:30 - but here it's just doing something funny
55:33 - found that if we put the center here all
55:36 - of our problems go away let's take a
55:40 - look all right now to emulate that this
55:43 - is active go to a rope stir and make
55:47 - that way I believe that there's an is
55:50 - active class that you can use or you can
55:52 - make your own style or you can do this
55:54 - your own way I just want to show you the
55:56 - fastest way that you could so I want to
55:58 - show you I just want to show you the
55:59 - fastest way that you could emulate that
56:01 - design now unfortunately I don't have
56:03 - enough time to make this interactive but
56:07 - we will finish this responsive and all
56:09 - alright I'll see you in the next
56:11 - screencast
56:16 - hey welcome back so our sites awesome
56:19 - and now we're going to add in the Tesla
56:22 - and roadster text that you see at the
56:23 - top to do that I'm gonna add a hero body
56:28 - and then we're gonna have an each one
56:31 - and in h2 whoops and you can probably
56:38 - work out how we style this right we just
56:41 - do and actually let's do subtitle here
56:44 - because the text is smaller not bigger
56:46 - and then we'll put title here yeah so
56:56 - just put this in a good for now I don't
56:58 - know what you're doing just put it in a
57:00 - div okay so this works all the same
57:03 - alright so the point is we want to have
57:05 - this up at the top and we want it to be
57:07 - centered so what we need to do is
57:10 - basically override override
57:12 - where is fault where it falls on the
57:14 - page and there's a general class that we
57:16 - can use to to deal with this so we can
57:19 - view is overlay which means it's
57:23 - position is independent from the content
57:25 - on the page so even though I've got
57:31 - content here the fact that it's overlaid
57:33 - on top just ignores that so it's a good
57:35 - start and there is a modifier has text
57:39 - centered to center the text and then you
57:42 - can kind of work out that we just need
57:44 - to just shift it down a bit so we can
57:46 - use style top and 82 was right now note
57:52 - I'm not using p.m. or REM here because I
57:54 - want the height to always be the same
57:56 - whether we're on a mobile device or not
57:58 - let's take a look so yeah that looks
58:02 - great so we turn off the debugger and I
58:04 - guess all that's left is this gap in
58:06 - between and the the text color itself I
58:09 - think you know how to do this right we
58:11 - could just say hey wait a minute
58:13 - I know how to do that just do has text
58:14 - in black there how that worked and would
58:21 - use single spaced here similar space
58:26 - what do you single spaced here
58:31 - remember our helper we had single space
58:34 - to find because I have this other
58:36 - version of it it doesn't matter where we
58:38 - define it we can put it here or we can
58:41 - put it up here
58:42 - so the asterisk is really vital here
58:47 - okay so now that content pretty much
58:50 - hugs each other which is what we want
58:52 - and then finally I want this to be a
58:55 - little bit lighter so instead of
58:58 - changing the color let's change the the
59:00 - text wave it has text weight light and
59:04 - yeah that gives us sort of a nice
59:06 - aesthetic all right that one was easy
59:09 - now last we're gonna do this like
59:10 - complicated thing at the bottom and I
59:13 - was like super intimidated when I went
59:15 - to Tesla and was like how do I do that
59:17 - turns out that this is actually pretty
59:20 - intuitive if we use grid I'm sure
59:22 - there's a way that you could use flexbox
59:23 - but I found that grid was basically the
59:26 - most expressive way to solve this
59:28 - problem that's it for this screencast
59:30 - see you in the final screencast
59:38 - hey welcome back so our site it's
59:40 - freaking awesome but it's missing the
59:42 - specs at the bottom they're kind of
59:45 - intricate they're a responsive design is
59:48 - not like anything we've seen so far so
59:50 - you might be feeling a bit intimidated
59:52 - now how do you possibly do this and do
59:55 - that in like 10 minutes or less and the
59:58 - thing is if you have the right tool it
60:00 - can be a lot easier than you imagined so
60:02 - what we're gonna do is use CSS grid here
60:04 - so I have a link to a file called grid
60:07 - and over here I have it defined it's
60:10 - just empty when you use grid to create
60:13 - this design and it's going to be a lot
60:15 - easier than I think you might imagine
60:16 - let's go ahead and create our hero's
60:19 - foot do like this and like a main
60:24 - instead would be footer but it's up to
60:28 - you
60:29 - and we're going to follow the format
60:32 - that we did before so we have everything
60:34 - inside of a div just inside of the
60:37 - parent so here is where we can define
60:42 - our grid and I'm going to use an ID for
60:45 - this it could be a class but doesn't
60:47 - really matter at least not right now
60:49 - now looking at this design I want you to
60:51 - imagine that this is four columns and
60:54 - two rows I want you to imagine that this
60:57 - is four columns and two rows so you have
61:00 - one two three four for the columns and
61:03 - then here you have two rows right so you
61:06 - have one and two and beyond that you
61:08 - have five elements you have one two
61:12 - three four and five
61:14 - all right so we'll create five gifts I
61:17 - love
61:19 - so a b c d e so if we go to our grid
61:27 - okay so now let's turn on the let's turn
61:29 - on the debugger okay so you can see the
61:34 - foot is trying to exist here but there's
61:37 - just nothing to show all right so we'll
61:39 - put some content yeah all right so let's
61:43 - constrain the grid to say with 768 and
61:49 - then let's Center here because that will
61:51 - Center its child which is the grid cool
61:55 - and let's just add a padding around here
62:01 - okay cool so now it's got like this
62:03 - little gap beneath it which is like we
62:06 - have here you a grid like this and then
62:09 - display grid set of grid template
62:13 - columns for interview areas so areas are
62:20 - pretty amazing
62:21 - if you remember we have four columns and
62:23 - two rows so in terms of IDs this is a B
62:27 - C D and E and so what we want is to say
62:30 - it that a occupies all four columns in
62:33 - the first row and then BCDE each occupy
62:36 - one column but span the entire row I
62:38 - think I said that right all right so
62:40 - here's how we can do that and say eh eh
62:43 - eh eh so this is one row and then four
62:47 - columns here we can say we c d e alright
62:53 - let's see what happens we've got the
62:55 - text at the top and then these would
62:57 - each be these specs now on a mobile
63:00 - device this won't do anything fancy but
63:02 - I bet you have an idea of how we can do
63:04 - that we can say at media max with 512
63:08 - pixels and say grid when an override
63:13 - grid template areas it's astonishing how
63:17 - simple this is
63:18 - all we need to do is remove a column and
63:22 - add a row that's it I know I know it's
63:30 - crazy
63:33 - it's who happens so
63:38 - on a mobile device you can see how the
63:41 - reserve now is at the bottom and the
63:43 - specs are in the center and then the
63:45 - text is at the top and then that changes
63:47 - depending on what we're looking at the
63:50 - rest of this is really just aesthetics
63:52 - so what we can do is we can say hey I
63:54 - want the rose to have a gap you say grid
63:58 - row gap one REM that gives us a nice
64:04 - break in between and I think you know
64:08 - what to do now the rest is really just
64:10 - titles subtitles and an icon so I'm
64:13 - gonna go in and paste them in because it
64:15 - is pretty cumbersome but I bet you'll
64:17 - understand all of it once I put it here
64:22 - so there it is and let's just talk about
64:25 - it real quick
64:26 - so one of the things that you'll note is
64:28 - that we're using contact column because
64:30 - I want the text here to be on top of
64:32 - each other if we used Center which is
64:35 - flex direction row it flows left to
64:37 - right and so to fix that we just say
64:40 - center column take a look you'll you'll
64:43 - recognize all of this code now we have a
64:46 - paragraph has text centered has text
64:48 - white here we have a paragraph with an
64:51 - icon inside of it here I've got this
64:54 - speed icon has text gray light we set a
64:59 - fixed width in a fixed height which is
65:01 - just a little bit smaller than the text
65:03 - and we can use modifiers so we have
65:07 - bearing size text right we have 1.9 as
65:10 - big and then small we have s and that's
65:13 - because of the and that's because we're
65:14 - changing the size with the modifier is
65:17 - size 5 for the reserve Now button that's
65:22 - really just a link it has some modifiers
65:24 - and I set the width to a hundred so that
65:28 - always occupies the available width and
65:30 - really that's all there is to it the
65:32 - thing is with boma you can really
65:34 - rapidly prototype and the code is fairly
65:36 - idiomatic so I really hope you enjoyed
65:39 - this course please
65:40 - please share this if you think it was
65:42 - valuable and if you want to reach out to
