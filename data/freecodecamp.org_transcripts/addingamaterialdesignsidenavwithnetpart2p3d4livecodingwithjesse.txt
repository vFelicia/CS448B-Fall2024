00:08 - everybody welcome to live coding with
00:11 - Jesse and I'm Jesse and we're gonna do
00:14 - some coding today pretty much right
00:19 - where we left off yesterday I've been
00:21 - trying to figure out how to get rid of
00:24 - these errors that we were having so just
00:26 - to do a recap for for what happened
00:30 - yesterday if you missed it
00:33 - we are trying to use the materialized
00:35 - CSS framework in an old website that has
00:39 - a lot of stuff going on a lot of
00:40 - different files put in by different
00:42 - companies and different developers and
00:44 - there's pretty much no documentation and
00:48 - so we're just learning as we go and when
00:54 - we tried to implement the side nav from
00:59 - materialized we kept getting an error so
01:04 - I tried commenting out different things
01:07 - so it really doesn't matter if I comment
01:11 - out the side nav function the modal
01:13 - throws an error and so pretty much
01:17 - everything that I'm trying to do from
01:19 - materialized doesn't work so I'm just
01:23 - going through and trying to remove
01:25 - everything I can that may be causing
01:28 - conflicts and hopefully hopefully
01:33 - something will work out so that's where
01:38 - I'm at
01:40 - just to show you see a lot of stuff on
01:45 - the screen right now so let me pull over
01:49 - here's what we have right now right so
01:52 - this is not this doesn't look good at
01:56 - all right here's the live site that
02:02 - we're trying to change and
02:09 - and this is we're gonna try to change it
02:12 - to well at least in terms of the header
02:14 - it'll definitely be a different
02:16 - background image this is just a stock
02:19 - photo but we want the header to look
02:22 - like that in the side and I have to look
02:24 - kind of like this we're gonna switch in
02:27 - that new logo that we used for the the
02:30 - last project for project 2 but other
02:32 - than that everything should be the same
02:35 - so we're here right now but once we get
02:42 - with the exception of some weird padding
02:45 - issues that I'll have to deal with once
02:48 - we get the the functions that come built
02:52 - in with materialized to work this should
02:56 - look a lot better so let's let's tell
03:04 - you what let me move this over for now
03:05 - and let's give it a refresh because I
03:09 - just did a few things before I started
03:11 - the stream and I haven't checked it yet
03:13 - all right so hey check this out so not
03:21 - not perfect but look at that
03:29 - we got we got it working so that's good
03:33 - news
03:34 - so at least some of what we're doing is
03:36 - working let's let's check out let's
03:43 - check out the console let's see Wow no
03:46 - errors awesome I mean other than this I
03:50 - I realized that that's just not gonna
03:53 - find that image but that's that's great
03:56 - alright so here's what I commented out I
03:59 - commented out this custom das file
04:03 - because I was I was looking through it
04:05 - and it really didn't have a lot that
04:10 - that I thought we needed so let me I
04:14 - guess it's not going to be in there
04:15 - anyway to get out but the it was
04:20 - basically doing a lot of things for
04:23 - components that I'm that I took out that
04:26 - aren't even on the page anymore so I
04:28 - think it should be fine maybe later on I
04:31 - should go through and look at it a
04:33 - little bit more closely just to make
04:35 - sure nothing was really necessary but
04:38 - there must have been something in there
04:40 - that was messing things up the only
04:44 - other thing I changed is I took out this
04:47 - version of jQuery which I thought I had
04:49 - already done but I guess I either didn't
04:53 - do it or I undid it somehow and didn't
04:55 - realize it so now we are using I think
04:59 - we're still loading two different
05:00 - versions of jQuery so we have this newer
05:04 - version for now I'm okay with that at
05:08 - some point we're gonna have to decide
05:09 - whether we want to run the older version
05:11 - or the newer version and how we're gonna
05:13 - do that we'll see what the best way to
05:19 - do that is let me say I had everyone in
05:21 - the live chat oh we got a question
05:25 - already so Jay rec says hey Jesse what
05:28 - programming language did you learn first
05:32 - back-end
05:35 - [Music]
05:37 - I want to say the first language that I
05:44 - feel like I really learned to the point
05:47 - where I could I could build stuff that
05:49 - works was JavaScript and that obviously
05:53 - is back in with node and front-end if if
05:59 - you want to if you want to take learn
06:02 - and the really loose sense then I'd say
06:06 - C++ I did build a calculator in C++
06:11 - before I learned how to do anything in
06:14 - JavaScript so but I don't other than
06:20 - like just the basic concept programming
06:23 - concepts that I learned when I took a
06:25 - class on C++ I don't remember much about
06:28 - it like syntax and things like that I
06:31 - haven't even looked at any C++ code
06:34 - probably since I took that course but it
06:38 - was cool because I just I remember
06:40 - learning things like different types of
06:42 - loops for loops while loops learning
06:48 - just a lot of the basic stuff so anyway
06:51 - I don't really use other languages that
06:55 - much I mean right now it's like some
06:57 - c-sharp stuff but am PHP I guess I I
07:01 - guess I have done some PHP with
07:06 - WordPress so I completely forgot about
07:09 - that but yeah I can I can do some PHP
07:13 - I've done like file upload like file
07:19 - handlers you know a handle form data and
07:21 - upload files with PHP so I guess I I
07:25 - could include that in as well I once
07:30 - took a little course on Java now that I
07:32 - think about it
07:34 - we built a game in the class but it was
07:36 - more like just a demo like we
07:39 - collaboratively built the game so the
07:43 - teacher did most of the work
07:46 - hey everybody
07:51 - okay so egos asking me about the the
07:54 - hack right so let me explain this so I
07:57 - was just I was just talking about these
08:00 - two different versions of JavaScript so
08:01 - you can't see the other one but it gets
08:03 - input basically through this tag here
08:07 - but it's an old version I think it's
08:09 - like one point ten or something
08:12 - so we I want to use the newer version
08:14 - but the problem is I can't find where
08:17 - this data is getting pulled in to change
08:19 - that so evo had a great idea was well
08:22 - why not just find where it's at you know
08:27 - in the file structure and then just take
08:31 - this file and rename it and I thought
08:35 - that was a really great idea until
08:38 - earlier today I was gonna do it and then
08:40 - I realized that if I did that it would
08:45 - change the version of jQuery on the live
08:47 - site and I don't want to do that because
08:51 - in the off chance that it does cause
08:54 - some weird problem I may not even know
08:58 - it because there's just way too many
08:59 - pages on the site for me to go through
09:01 - and check that and I wouldn't want to go
09:05 - through all those pages on the site it's
09:06 - just too slow it would take me all like
09:08 - days so anyway I'm not gonna do it right
09:11 - now
09:12 - I actually really want to know where
09:15 - this is coming from anyway because it's
09:17 - loading a lot of other files so we may
09:19 - not even need those files so that was a
09:23 - really good idea if this was really an
09:25 - actual test server instead of some weird
09:28 - I don't I don't even know it's it's
09:35 - supposed to be a test but everything I
09:39 - change changes the live site if I'm not
09:41 - careful okay
09:50 - hey Sebastian's back awesome so
09:56 - Sebastian was a regular here on this
10:00 - livestream in the chat but he recently
10:05 - went to Germany and says just got
10:09 - Internet awesome okay let's get started
10:19 - if you haven't if you haven't watched
10:24 - before the format is basically I do
10:26 - twenty five minutes of code five minutes
10:28 - a question to answer another 25-minute
10:30 - session of code and then the end I do
10:32 - Question and Answer
10:33 - occasionally I'll do more code I'll go
10:36 - longer but today I'm just going to do
10:38 - the two sessions of code two sessions of
10:41 - questions and answers so that's what
10:45 - we're gonna do now
10:46 - and I'm gonna set a timer to help me
10:47 - stay on track if I can find it and I
10:51 - think I'm also gonna clean up these
10:52 - windows a bit so once I once you start
10:58 - working on more than one project things
11:00 - start to get a little bit crazy so I
11:03 - still have everything open from project
11:06 - 2 which is not done yet and now this
11:08 - this project I have lots of stuff open
11:10 - for I was working on another project
11:12 - earlier as well and so I have a lot
11:17 - going on I actually spent most of the
11:19 - morning going over a site it's AG it's
11:25 - only like a few pages but it's like a
11:27 - little site that we have this other
11:29 - company building for our single sign-on
11:31 - system and it's just really disappointed
11:35 - I just told them some basic things to do
11:38 - so it matches the style that we use on
11:40 - the other site just I mean really basic
11:43 - like literally I gave them the CSS and
11:47 - said here put this in and then I checked
11:50 - they came back and said hey we've done
11:52 - like everything that you asked for
11:54 - except for this one thing I checked and
11:56 - they like didn't even get 50% of it done
11:58 - so really disappointed and
12:01 - I mean this was like really basic stuff
12:04 - and they they couldn't even get a hover
12:06 - to work like a CSS hover it was yeah it
12:11 - was just odd I don't know how much we're
12:13 - paying them but I don't think I want to
12:15 - know I think it just made me sad so
12:19 - anyway I had to go through and basically
12:21 - in dev tools figure out to write all the
12:24 - code out and tell them exactly what line
12:26 - to replace so that this gets done I have
12:31 - until the end of October it's supposed
12:33 - to launch at the end of October so I
12:36 - just I mean it's not my project I'm not
12:39 - really gonna get credit for it but I
12:41 - still don't want it to look bad because
12:43 - it's you know it's gonna reflect the
12:44 - university so anyway sorry for the
12:49 - complaints I don't it's just I just want
12:54 - to find a really good like outside
12:56 - company that does quality work and and
12:59 - can understand like that things need to
13:04 - be precise so you can't you can't just
13:07 - get it like close enough especially when
13:10 - I'm giving very precise like I'm giving
13:13 - them the CSS I'm not just saying oh you
13:15 - know make it look pretty which is vague
13:17 - I'm actually saying like this is exactly
13:19 - what I want and anyway we've had some
13:24 - bad luck with different companies and
13:27 - websites just really really helped me
13:33 - find somebody good that we could stick
13:35 - with when we need to outsource projects
13:38 - okay sorry I said I was sorry for
13:41 - complaining and then I just went on
13:43 - again from the minute let's I was just
13:50 - cleaning up Windows so let's get the
13:53 - windows that you know the desktops that
13:55 - we're actually gonna use the most we'll
13:57 - get those right next to each other and
13:59 - so here we go get this one just one I
14:03 - think that's I think that's it
14:06 - so we'll have our code oops maybe I
14:10 - didn't do it right
14:11 - oh no it's it's right code here right
14:19 - here okay all right so here's what we
14:24 - have right now not terrible but it looks
14:30 - like we still have a lot of weird stuff
14:32 - going on with CSS so this should be up
14:37 - at the top I mean this should not be all
14:39 - moved over so we're gonna have to just
14:41 - go through and inspect these elements
14:43 - and see what in the CSS is causing it to
14:49 - shift around and then as a last resort
14:52 - we can use important on our CSS
14:55 - properties but a better way would be
14:58 - just to make our selectors more specific
15:02 - than what's currently in place I think
15:06 - that'll be that'll be the best way to do
15:10 - it I don't want to get into actually
15:13 - changing the CSS that's already there
15:15 - because for every file I'll have to make
15:19 - a test file and then I'll have to change
15:22 - the names right of when we're importing
15:25 - that and then I'll have to work on that
15:28 - CSS and hope that it doesn't mess
15:31 - something up elsewhere I won't really be
15:33 - able to test that at all so you can see
15:35 - it would be kind of a mess so and in
15:38 - this instance I'm gonna be very specific
15:41 - with my selectors so that I know it's
15:45 - only going to affect the stuff that
15:47 - we're putting in so we we may have to
15:49 - throw in some IDs and things and use
15:51 - that which I normally wouldn't do but in
15:54 - this case we want to make sure it
15:55 - doesn't cause side effects in other
15:58 - places okay so let's just let's start
16:06 - checking these things out and we'll try
16:10 - to make some space
16:14 - and let's get rid of this we don't need
16:20 - that right now just make as much space
16:24 - as we can here all right this looks good
16:30 - interesting
16:36 - yeah that is that's very interesting
16:39 - okay let's just check out what's going
16:41 - on oh I thought that the the one that I
16:48 - had oh well
16:50 - so now let's let's get this let's move
16:57 - this over now oh I know this is the
17:00 - right one I don't know what that's to
17:02 - you guys just get rid of it oh that's
17:05 - the project - okay whoops I don't need
17:13 - this right now let's move it over
17:23 - man I have so as you a lot of you
17:26 - already know I listen to music in my
17:27 - headphones while I'm doing this and a
17:30 - country song just came on and I like
17:33 - pretty much all music but I'm really not
17:36 - a big fan of country music man how did
17:39 - that how did that come on
17:43 - but anyway pretty distracting just for a
17:47 - minute here but let's check out let's
17:50 - check out what's going on so here's our
17:52 - our nav rapper and
18:06 - let's check out our header first is
18:09 - that's the outside the outermost
18:11 - container so you can see that's down a
18:15 - bit and let's see where so this is our
18:18 - file so anything in new design we want
18:21 - to see that at the top and we don't want
18:22 - to see anything crossed out because
18:25 - that's our CSS also anything that's
18:28 - materialized mndot CSS we want to see
18:30 - that actually applied if we see anything
18:33 - crossed out on those two then we'll know
18:35 - that that's being overridden by
18:37 - something else so so far so good on the
18:40 - header but it looks like we have some
18:44 - weird stuff going on here right this is
18:47 - from styles dot CSS which I did not
18:49 - write so there we go let's check it out
18:56 - let's make it alright so it didn't fix
18:58 - it totally but it got rid of that thing
19:01 - at the top right so you can see we had a
19:04 - position:absolute and we had top twenty
19:06 - right that was because right you can see
19:10 - in the version site we have now that it
19:13 - actually does have this little gap at
19:15 - the top so that's where we got that from
19:23 - so now we don't have that anymore
19:25 - let's see okay with a hundred percent it
19:29 - that that really shouldn't be a problem
19:33 - we could probably just leave that in
19:34 - there we don't need that top anymore
19:37 - so what we need to do though is
19:47 - we need to figure out what type of
19:49 - positioning we wanted to have and I
19:52 - think we're gonna go with a fixed with a
19:56 - fixed header let me double check yeah we
20:01 - wanted what this navbar to be fixed
20:08 - actually that's interesting that
20:24 - that's really odd that the navbar fixed
20:27 - position is not fixed
20:41 - okay so I guess the interior positioning
20:44 - is fixed we just can't tell you can't
20:48 - scroll right now let's see if I can make
20:50 - it scroll okay so that positioning is
20:52 - working so we're good with that all
20:56 - right so we still need to figure out you
20:59 - know this big gap on the side and I
21:02 - think I was thinking about this I think
21:05 - to some point last night and I was
21:09 - thinking you know when you use
21:10 - materialized there's a structure to the
21:12 - page that we just don't have here right
21:16 - we have all this other stuff going on so
21:20 - I think we need to check out what's
21:22 - outside of this header and just see how
21:25 - things are lining up and see how much of
21:28 - this structure we can actually change
21:29 - without messing things up so that's
21:34 - where we'll look we should probably
21:39 - remember what we did with this header so
21:43 - position we don't want absolutely we
21:47 - don't once house let's just say sorry
21:56 - position okay so static so let's go with
22:01 - static and okay top let's double check
22:06 - new design 32
22:09 - oops all right so let's go to our new
22:13 - design whoops this is uh Jas we need our
22:17 - CSS you designed that CSS I'm go to 1:30
22:25 - there we go okay so we need position
22:35 - static and top auto now it should
22:41 - override right because it's just it's
22:45 - the same right it's header here header
22:47 - here and we're loading this after so the
22:51 - cascading nature of
22:53 - skating stylesheets should take effect
22:55 - and what we have will override what's
22:58 - there so let's refresh just to
23:00 - double-check yep and there we go so all
23:04 - right so there's one salt you can see
23:06 - how tedious this process is gonna be we
23:09 - may we may end up only getting a new
23:13 - header we'll see I hope to do like an
23:19 - entirely new homepage but that if it
23:26 - keeps going at this pace then it's gonna
23:29 - be tough
23:29 - hopefully as we go along we'll we'll
23:32 - have less
23:33 - you know maybe we'll figure out a lot of
23:35 - what's what's going on and what's
23:37 - causing this and it won't be as big of a
23:39 - deal okay actually I just thought to
23:45 - check to make sure that this this is
23:47 - working and it is now if you remember we
23:51 - we have not actually added these the way
23:58 - we want to yeah well sorry
24:04 - I really haven't gone all day and now
24:08 - I'm yawning during the stream so I'm
24:11 - gonna drink some some G fuel
24:25 - if you're not familiar with G fuel it's
24:27 - like a five-hour energy except it's
24:30 - powder and you mix it with water just a
24:36 - lot of vitamins and caffeine okay so we
24:42 - still need right these are all
24:43 - hard-coded right now so that's not what
24:45 - we want so we still need to add put that
24:47 - in but before we couldn't even see this
24:50 - to tell if what we were doing was
24:51 - working so we're gonna do that since
24:54 - we're already kind of into the CSS let's
24:57 - do a little bit more of this and get it
24:58 - to the point where it looks about like
25:01 - it should and then we'll just try to put
25:03 - in some of that stuff from the template
25:05 - that'll give us these links I'd like it
25:10 - if we could get the links just like this
25:12 - but as long as we can get close to that
25:14 - I'll be happy with that too I'm kind of
25:18 - hoping that we can reevaluate some of
25:20 - these links when we redo this but we'll
25:23 - see evidently when before I was here
25:26 - when this site underwent a redesign the
25:28 - last time figuring out what links get in
25:31 - the top navigation on the homepage was a
25:34 - huge deal like every department one of
25:37 - their stuff on the front and so don't
25:40 - really want to go into that again if we
25:43 - don't have to but I think it could use a
25:45 - bit of cleaning up all right so let's
25:48 - check out if we're doing yours so we
25:51 - have this inner page outer see that this
25:55 - may be messing us up a bit it's C I may
25:59 - have to just put this on the other
26:00 - screen for a second just so I can see
26:03 - okay all right check this out you see
26:10 - that so we've got we've got some weird
26:20 - margins going on here
26:22 - I'm guessing yep there it is okay so I
26:24 - was guessing there is a max width on
26:26 - this and there it is there's a max width
26:28 - and it's set to zero Auto
26:30 - so anything in there can't go past there
26:32 - so that's why we're cut off at least on
26:36 - this side
26:36 - some reason we're overflowing here on
26:40 - the other side which is good shoot I
26:44 - click the link okay we're back
26:48 - so let's mess around with this a bit max
26:55 - with there we go
26:59 - awesome alright so check that out look
27:03 - it works let's make sure this works cool
27:05 - oh man why is it always so I don't know
27:12 - what's over there that I keep clicking
27:14 - but alright so that works so here's what
27:19 - we're gonna do we what's above this okay
27:31 - so let's check what we're doing to
27:34 - materialize right now because this could
27:37 - take that I think in materialize the way
27:39 - you structure it is there's a main
27:42 - component I can't remember if header is
27:45 - supposed to be inside of main or not and
27:48 - so let me double check that and then
27:49 - that'll determine what I want to do with
27:51 - this div so I think I have it
27:55 - I guess it's this way here we go so
28:02 - let's see what how we structured it here
28:09 - okay so here's our header and there's
28:14 - main below it and then it's just bought
28:16 - ietter mein okay I think we're gonna try
28:18 - to completely get rid of this inner page
28:21 - out of wrap or a page outline thing okay
28:24 - I imagine it might mess some other
28:26 - things up but we'll see so what I want
28:29 - to do is get rid of this completely so
28:33 - that our header well we have two options
28:36 - either we can try to move the header up
28:38 - so it's outside of this and then make
28:40 - this our main so try to basically just
28:45 - add the class main to this and see if we
28:47 - can override the other styles or get rid
28:49 - of it completely and you know put in a
28:52 - main down here so we'll see what's
28:53 - easier once we check this out so let's
28:57 - go back to our be our main main test
29:03 - master so let's try to find that what
29:08 - was that called inner page see if we can
29:11 - find it here in their page there we go
29:14 - okay awesome so it looks like we could
29:24 - yeah we could just move this up I'm
29:30 - guessing that everything that I do needs
29:33 - to be inside this form so I'm gonna put
29:39 - it inside the form for now I'm not sure
29:43 - Umberto's not in the live chat and he's
29:45 - he's good with c-sharp but if anybody
29:49 - knows I think when we're doing stuff
29:51 - with like dotnet everything's got to be
29:55 - inside this form so that's what I'm
29:58 - gonna do it like that for now and I
30:02 - think it should work and I'm gonna the
30:06 - indentation in this file is just
30:08 - ridiculous I don't know how this
30:11 - happened but it was like that before we
30:14 - started also I still haven't all right
30:18 - let's save that but then let's
30:20 - let's get the important stuff out of the
30:22 - way first we have got to change these
30:24 - settings so that it uses spaces instead
30:27 - of tabs so let's see there we go
30:35 - tab size needs to be equal to 2 oops
30:39 - [Music]
30:44 - the editing in Visual Studio code is
30:47 - actually pretty cool all the way copy
30:52 - the settings sure so just kind of as an
31:02 - aside here if you never done editing and
31:04 - visual studio code it's kind of cool I
31:07 - like it
31:08 - so you have your settings JSON and here
31:12 - on on this panel they give you all the
31:15 - settings and you can search them and it
31:17 - gives you a description then you can
31:20 - click over here to edit and it copies it
31:23 - over to kind of like your settings file
31:27 - that just overrides all the other stuff
31:29 - right so this is where you put you know
31:33 - your custom settings and so it's pretty
31:37 - cool like you'd see like I am what did I
31:41 - do I put in here I changed something in
31:48 - my user settings and I can't find it but
31:50 - anyway it's somewhere in my settings I
31:53 - took away the the map like the mini-map
31:56 - thing that was on the sides it was taken
31:59 - away too much space but it's really cool
32:02 - pretty much anything in the UI you can
32:04 - change from there so all right so let's
32:07 - test this out maybe it didn't work it
32:14 - does not look like it worked
32:18 - no all right maybe I need to restart for
32:22 - it to take effect we'll see I'm gonna
32:26 - just double check that it actually yeah
32:29 - it's in there
32:38 - the settings overridden based on the
32:40 - file contents when editor detected
32:43 - annotation okay so since that file
32:47 - already has that kind of indentation
32:49 - that's why it's doing that so I'm gonna
32:52 - leave that alone we're just going to be
32:54 - stuck with that but going forward for
32:56 - new files we have in Visual Studio code
32:59 - will have the same indentation that I'm
33:01 - used to using alright so now that we've
33:05 - we've changed this let's see what things
33:08 - look like
33:16 - all right great let's make sure oh nice
33:20 - and look at that before I don't know if
33:22 - you remember but the overlay was coming
33:25 - over top of this and now it's not so
33:31 - that's that's awesome
33:33 - at least at some point it was coming
33:36 - over top of it great and there it is
33:41 - there's that that link so I'm getting
33:46 - I'm gonna have to fix that something's
33:49 - that's not how it's supposed to work so
33:53 - that's that's a minor thing I'll just
33:55 - fix that later but anyway double check
33:59 - okay great that's working so when you
34:01 - click on one over here it opens a side
34:02 - bar and it automatically opens up that
34:06 - all these sub links wonderful great
34:14 - alright instead of some weird stuff like
34:16 - the color of links is when you hover
34:19 - changes to blue we don't want that but
34:23 - not bad so here's the next step let's
34:29 - try to populate the links in the side
34:31 - nav from the link the data that we're
34:34 - getting from from our content management
34:36 - system and we need the we need to put in
34:42 - the logo too so we'll figure out where
34:45 - to where to bring that logo in at and
34:48 - [Music]
34:52 - actually I think we're using an SVG logo
34:55 - it's a pretty long SVG but we can
34:57 - potentially just copy and paste the SVG
34:59 - stuff right in there we'll see I might
35:03 - do that okay so for now we need to go to
35:09 - our
35:13 - I'm main nav test I just we need to look
35:19 - at what's going on here and figure out
35:25 - where to put these so
35:43 - okay I'm still somewhat familiar with
35:46 - what the mark-up looks like on the the
35:50 - main site so this section I guess I'll
35:58 - show you all what it what it looks like
36:00 - so it was just make a lot of sense if we
36:02 - just take a look for a second so we have
36:04 - these these links here then we have this
36:08 - menu here down here these are the the
36:12 - bottom links that they're talking about
36:13 - so for each one of these we need to get
36:16 - all of these sub links and then the
36:19 - bottom links as well and put them in
36:21 - that side nav under there
36:23 - so this is where keep on the wrong way
36:27 - so this is where we're getting this
36:29 - bottom links so in this green box menu
36:39 - hey at least the ternary operator is the
36:43 - same as it is in JavaScript let's see
36:48 - that's good I understand something so if
36:52 - you're not familiar with the ternary
36:54 - this is basically like an if statement
36:55 - so it's if this is true then do this
36:59 - which in this case is put in this little
37:02 - bit of markup if it's not true then do
37:08 - this
37:15 - okay
37:18 - so you might be able to copy this
37:23 - actually my the timer went up so before
37:26 - I get into this let's do the five minute
37:28 - five minutes a question answer and then
37:31 - we'll get back and we'll start copying
37:33 - some of these and putting them up in our
37:36 - code up here and seeing if we can get
37:39 - this if we can get it working okay
37:45 - let me find my timer there we go
37:49 - do our short break all right I'm gonna
37:54 - scroll up I'm probably not gonna get
37:55 - through everything in this five minutes
37:57 - but if I don't get to your question now
37:59 - I'll get to it at the end of the stream
38:24 - you know like there's a lot of talking
38:26 - going on a lot of chat but not a lot of
38:27 - questions
38:37 - okay here's a question
38:40 - rich rich Bob says is Ubuntu better than
38:45 - Windows and I would say it just kind of
38:50 - depends on what your preferences are I
38:53 - mean you could probably match them up
38:56 - like head-to-head on certain things and
38:58 - say you know one's better than the other
39:00 - at certain things but I I really only
39:04 - use Linux for servers and not as I mean
39:09 - if we're comparing servers I definitely
39:11 - prefer Linux servers like an abuti
39:13 - server over a Windows server but I don't
39:16 - have enough experience with linux
39:18 - desktops to be able to really say one
39:20 - way or another evo says I find it it is
39:26 - harder with Linux because you need to
39:28 - have a pretty deep understanding of all
39:30 - your your tools on Windows it's pretty
39:33 - much all done for you okay
39:43 - yeah that makes sense from what I've
39:45 - heard from people who do use Linux for
39:48 - desktop it's like if if you like
39:51 - handling a lot of that stuff then it's
39:54 - really good but if you just want
39:55 - something you can just turn on and it'll
39:57 - work and and you don't have to worry
39:58 - about it then windows might be the way
40:02 - to go although if you want something
40:04 - that just turns on it just works a Mac
40:06 - is probably the way to go I've never had
40:09 - other than a Chromebook I've never had
40:11 - something that just starts up so fast
40:13 - and is reliable
40:16 - there's definitely drawbacks as well
40:18 - like how much it costs but and the lack
40:21 - of being able to customize things but
40:25 - it's definitely reliable
40:45 - okay
40:52 - all right so you have let me see some
40:54 - questions so sy asks does he look at the
40:57 - chat and I think someone else already
40:59 - answered but I'll just reiterate that
41:01 - that yeah I do look at the chat so at
41:04 - the beginning of the stream I spend most
41:06 - of the time coding I will take a break
41:08 - halfway through and answer questions and
41:11 - then at the end of the stream we'll get
41:13 - to all the questions so and then
41:16 - occasionally I do look over when I'm
41:18 - coding it just so happened that this
41:20 - coding session this first one I I didn't
41:22 - really look over very often
41:28 - Jordan asks what we're building
41:30 - basically we're not really like building
41:32 - anything we're just kind of trying to
41:34 - improve an existing website so it's an
41:37 - older website it's built on some older
41:38 - technology we're trying to go in going
41:41 - in there and we're giving it a facelift
41:43 - and trying to make it a little bit
41:44 - faster so we're gonna add some material
41:47 - design style UI and try to just get rid
41:53 - of as much as much code as we can that's
41:57 - unnecessary there's a lot of files being
42:00 - loaded there's a lot of images being
42:01 - loaded we want to just clean up that UI
42:04 - get rid of a lot of it and just do what
42:08 - we can I mean this site's probably a
42:10 - year or so away from being totally
42:13 - redone anyway so we just need to keep it
42:16 - going
42:17 - and and make it look a little bit better
42:20 - and until till we can get to the point
42:23 - where we're gonna redo it totally Daniel
42:30 - asks is there any way we can help you
42:31 - out
42:36 - [Music]
42:46 - I said Daniel I don't I don't know if
42:48 - you were referring to helping me out or
42:50 - helping someone out in the chat but if
42:53 - anybody right now this project is kind
42:56 - of hard to collaborate on because I
42:59 - don't have a whole lot on github right
43:02 - now like I have this on github and I
43:05 - have a I think I have this linked in the
43:07 - description the fu s starter template
43:10 - that's on github and it has things like
43:13 - in this menu but I'm working on getting
43:16 - some version of of this and github I
43:21 - just what I want to make sure that I
43:23 - leave out any of the config files and
43:27 - because that has like database passwords
43:29 - and usernames and things in there so I
43:30 - want to just be really careful about
43:33 - making sure I don't put anything that I
43:35 - shouldn't I don't get hope so when I get
43:38 - a chance I'm gonna put some of this out
43:40 - here and then at least you'll have a
43:41 - chance to check it out will you be able
43:43 - to run it probably not because you'll
43:45 - need you'll need Ektron which nobody has
43:49 - Ektron it cost a lot of money and
43:54 - there's like no one in my mind there's
43:57 - no reason for anyone to use a cron
43:59 - anymore it's it's not a great system
44:03 - compared to what we have now who knows
44:05 - maybe well at one point in the past it
44:07 - was a really awesome system but now it's
44:09 - it's definitely shows its age so alright
44:15 - so I got through I don't know about 3/4
44:20 - of what's in the live chat so I'm gonna
44:21 - go back and do a little bit more coding
44:24 - another 25-minute session and then I'll
44:26 - go through everything in the live chat
44:27 - so I'm gonna write down where I stopped
44:30 - so I don't doesn't take me forever to
44:32 - find it
44:40 - okay there was some talk about whether I
44:43 - respond to comments and slack or in a
44:45 - live chat I do check in on the slack
44:48 - Channel when I can but that's I usually
44:50 - don't check slack during the stream so
44:53 - that's all you know if you want to send
44:55 - a message or something when I'm not
44:57 - streaming slacks the way to go if I am
44:59 - streaming go ahead and put it in the
45:01 - live chat and I'll check that the same
45:03 - goes for anything else so Twitter or any
45:06 - social media channels I - I know almost
45:08 - never check that while I'm streaming but
45:12 - I I do try to get to it after before and
45:18 - after Xtreme it was just odd
45:20 - somebody from business services
45:22 - department here just called but hung up
45:25 - after one ring so that's that's fine
45:30 - with me I want a code
45:33 - okay let's where's my timer okay let's
45:39 - set that timer again and now let's let's
45:44 - just start copying some things over I
45:47 - think let's see so you know what this
45:51 - repeater and right now
46:08 - I'm trying to find what the outermost
46:16 - element is here okay so
46:35 - all right let's check on yeah let's
46:38 - check some of these so it's inspected I
46:46 - just want to see the structure of it
46:47 - okay so here's that mega menu div inside
46:51 - there that's where we have to you ELLs
46:55 - that are coming and now so let's check
46:57 - that so here's that mega menu div and
47:04 - then okay there's another item template
47:08 - with another repeater okay
47:22 - so really
47:28 - this is going to be kind of like the
47:31 - bottom most level this this item sounds
47:39 - late
47:53 - okay in this repeater we'll need this
47:55 - repeater as well let's check out Mega
48:01 - Man you don't see ya I may not need any
48:03 - of these outer things double check
48:25 - actually I think we should do that okay
48:31 - so will once like this okay
48:39 - I'm gonna I'm gonna move this over to my
48:41 - other screen so I can see it and look at
48:43 - the code at the same time so here's what
48:47 - we'll do so we definitely want we want
48:51 - all of this but we're just gonna have to
48:53 - change like these I have to change these
48:57 - to match what we're doing up here so
49:02 - that's
49:03 - [Music]
49:08 - I could split this let me
49:22 - let me check out I think this is just
49:26 - okay so this is a big list these are all
49:30 - allies okay so we can keep this
49:33 - structure of allies so there's one one
49:40 - ul over everything and then
49:54 - okay so we'll have to keep our URL
49:57 - because they're not there's not a where
49:59 - I'm sorry our ul our unordered list this
50:02 - outermost because that's not being it
50:03 - put in by this template the first thing
50:06 - they put in is this Li and that'll be
50:09 - these allies for us and then right now
50:13 - it's putting in an a tag and a link but
50:16 - we don't want that right so let's let's
50:18 - see what we're doing so what we want we
50:21 - want the a tag but we don't want it to
50:23 - be a link so let me just bring this down
50:26 - here just so that we have a reference so
50:33 - we'll reference that right here so
50:38 - here's what we want let's remove this
50:41 - href
50:49 - and our class we don't need to bring in
50:58 - a class dynamically it's only just gonna
51:02 - have the class collapsible header
51:12 - and then for the data URL we're just
51:18 - gonna call that faith section
51:28 - there we go and then we need the name
51:34 - and we definitely don't want this image
51:38 - i was actually i actually already hid
51:40 - that on the main site because it looks
51:43 - just so old and terrible i guess we
51:46 - don't need the span either rid of that
51:51 - and there we go and that's the name so
51:54 - that's what we need
51:55 - awesome so that one's taken care of so
51:57 - that's that's going to be all of our our
51:59 - top level headers for our side nav right
52:07 - and now we need to get to these that are
52:09 - inside here so for right now in my
52:12 - markup I actually have multiple
52:15 - unordered lists but if we can do it
52:21 - differently I think it would be better
52:25 - it makes more sense to just have one
52:28 - unordered list so let's see how how we
52:31 - can do it so now we have underneath the
52:38 - allies let's check what we have here so
52:42 - underneath the Li a a tag we have this
52:46 - div that's collapsible body so let's
52:50 - let's just copy that and bring it down
52:52 - here and instead of
53:04 - so if it has child taxonomy then we're
53:09 - gonna say I think this is the point
53:16 - where we'll want to put the collapsible
53:21 - [Music]
53:25 - yeah so instead of this mega menu div
53:28 - we're gonna put our collapsible body div
53:35 - right there okay this is collapsible
53:41 - body
53:58 - and I'll need to escape these there we
54:05 - go
54:11 - just okay so I since I was using double
54:14 - quotes and then double quotes inside you
54:17 - have to escape them I'm not really sure
54:18 - how it works
54:19 - and with.net if I could have used like
54:24 - single quotes in here maybe I could've
54:26 - but I decided just to do it like this
54:28 - since it's being done down here and I
54:29 - know it works like that all right so now
54:33 - we'll have for every it looks like for
54:36 - every section that actually has links
54:40 - sub-links it'll add this div that's
54:43 - collapsible body if it doesn't have sub
54:46 - links it won't it won't add anything
54:48 - which for right now everything will have
54:51 - sub link so we'll just keep going
54:56 - alright so we have another item template
54:59 - here that's gonna add okay so here's
55:06 - here's where we can we can change this a
55:09 - bit since we want one ul yeah one ul we
55:21 - can change this up get first submenu
55:25 - item class
55:40 - now this is this is kind of confusing
55:50 - okay so there should be allies within
55:53 - this I'm not sure where they're coming
55:55 - in at probably coming in on that that
56:06 - dot CS file so so let's do this let's
56:13 - move a ul up here yeah we'll get rid of
56:21 - this div we'll get rid of this you l
56:25 - will move it up here and then then it
56:35 - should put in a lies beneath that
56:43 - yeah let's double check our markup here
56:46 - collapse body ul and these are just
56:48 - allies with a tags in the middle okay
56:51 - that should work that that's exactly
56:54 - that's exactly what we want okay so
56:58 - let's do that
57:00 - we need this green box menu
57:14 - I need
57:26 - all right let's try something out I'm
57:28 - wondering if we can get rid of just
57:30 - completely get rid of all of that and
57:33 - just and yeah I think we can so we'll
57:41 - leave this for Peter here but then for
57:46 - this we can just get rid of a whole
57:50 - thing and we can get rid of
57:59 - is that it no that's not it this was a
58:02 - closing tags these closing tags now
58:07 - we'll put here a ul and I don't think
58:13 - yeah we just needed you out so we'll
58:19 - open our ul up here and then we'll close
58:24 - it here so inside that div
58:32 - okay now this should just output allies
58:39 - in this same way we want it to here so
58:43 - let's say that and what we can do is we
58:56 - can just check out what gets outputted
58:58 - here without having to change any of
59:00 - this yet okay so let me refresh
59:06 - hopefully no errors will see nice okay
59:16 - so this is looking looking pretty good
59:21 - so far so let me bring this over so
59:25 - y'all can see the structure so this is
59:27 - what we wanted we wanted these sections
59:31 - right we have the the UL
59:47 - okay
59:49 - awesome
59:51 - so here we go that we have all these
59:53 - here the only thing I'm not sure about
59:57 - is is that that first section did we
60:03 - have that all we did have that but it
60:09 - was last oh you know what
60:15 - that's uh that's this one that we left
60:20 - in here let me take that out
60:22 - I was confusing me okay let's give it a
60:28 - refresh and should be should be alright
60:35 - now
60:50 - I just got a slack message from the
60:55 - project manager so let's see you have to
60:59 - replace the character with so I have
61:02 - this file uploader right and if someone
61:06 - uploads a file with a dot in it with a
61:10 - period in it other than the file
61:12 - extension then she gets an error when
61:17 - she tries to get the file I can't
61:22 - remember what I replaced it with let's
61:26 - see so you get an error let me see I
61:34 - think if you used to take out I thought
61:38 - if you just took out the dot that it
61:40 - would work maybe I changed the dot too -
61:42 - no I didn't
61:51 - oh I don't know I will
62:05 - all right I'll get to that I mean
62:25 - all right so I was okay cool I just want
62:29 - to check to make sure it wasn't an
62:31 - emergency otherwise we were gonna be
62:34 - switching gears a little bit and doing
62:36 - something else on this stream okay but
62:38 - not an emergency so let's
62:52 - sorry it's just just let her know I will
62:58 - be able to get the file alright so this
63:02 - is working so now what we want to do is
63:04 - actually put this inside actually put
63:11 - this inside here so if you remember we
63:13 - need to keep this outer UL but then
63:17 - everything else can go so let's do that
63:22 - is this the outer one yep okay so here's
63:27 - our outer UL and let me double check
63:55 - actually I think I think we're taking
63:58 - out too many us not we are let me
64:18 - yeah okay so it's not we want to keep
64:23 - this ul this Li I'm gonna keep it this
64:32 - you oh okay so this is that one
64:39 - so just a bit from this Li up we'll take
64:44 - that out
64:51 - okay
64:57 - this is always tough to do especially
65:01 - when it when I'm on the like the the
65:04 - trackpad for a Mac select bodies here
65:07 - the mouse okay
65:10 - is this it yep that's it
65:14 - okay take all that out and replace it
65:20 - with this and everything should work
65:29 - save it
65:32 - refresh
65:46 - whoa check that out all right awesome
65:57 - let's make sure all right there's links
66:03 - look good nah haze all right cool so
66:10 - we've successfully figured out how
66:14 - everything is coming into these
66:16 - templates and we've been able to adapt
66:19 - it to fit the materialise you know side
66:24 - nav component and I know I said this for
66:31 - the last couple of streams but this is
66:33 - really it feels a comet-like reacts
66:36 - right we basically just popped in you
66:41 - know our data there's some weird stuff
66:45 - going on that's definitely not react
66:46 - like but we know enough now that I think
66:56 - we can do this we can build out you know
67:02 - this homepage so not bad see how much
67:08 - time I have and go from there all right
67:12 - about three minutes maybe I'm saying
67:18 - three minutes I'm not sure how much I
67:19 - get done we do need a logo actually let
67:23 - me okay
67:24 - want to double check and make sure that
67:26 - that still works yep that works too
67:28 - awesome if you do need a logo to go
67:32 - there hmm
67:38 - it's probably gonna take me three
67:40 - minutes to find that logo
67:44 - so that's probably not gonna work out so
67:47 - I think what I'll do is I'm just going
67:51 - to start the question answer session a
67:53 - few minutes early and yeah that's good I
67:59 - this was not bad you know on a Friday I
68:01 - got everything done I got it done sooner
68:03 - than I thought I would it works so this
68:07 - may be my most successful stream ever
68:11 - but right now I'm gonna scroll up I'm
68:15 - gonna so if you have a question please
68:17 - put in the live chat right now if you
68:18 - don't have a question you'd be great if
68:19 - you could stick around and help answer
68:20 - some questions I would certainly value
68:24 - having your expertise here if you can't
68:27 - stick around for the question answer
68:28 - session I totally understand thank you
68:30 - so much for watching and I'll be back on
68:33 - Monday probably around sometime around
68:36 - 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time
68:38 - you can subscribe to the free camps
68:40 - Channel and you'll get an alert whenever
68:42 - I schedule the next stream or you could
68:45 - you could also follow me on Twitter and
68:48 - I always tweet right after I schedule
68:50 - stream I put out a tweet and I let you
68:53 - all know what I'm gonna be doing that
68:56 - day and when I'm gonna do it and I
68:59 - provide a link to the live stream okay
69:09 - okay
69:23 - okay let's see web some okay so we have
69:27 - a question rich rich OGG says is
69:30 - webstorm good I've never used webstorm
69:34 - so that'll have to be I don't have to be
69:36 - answered by those in the live chat
69:39 - because I I just don't know very much at
69:43 - all about it
69:53 - Jordan asked why why dotnet it was not
69:59 - my choice that just happens to be what
70:02 - this site was built in so I'm not
70:08 - allowed to completely rebuild the site
70:10 - from the ground up yet so from now my
70:14 - job is just to make do with what we have
70:16 - and make it make it faster and prettier
70:21 - and hopefully more user friendly as best
70:25 - I can with with what we have so so
70:29 - that's why I'm working with dotnet right
70:31 - now hopefully the next time I work on
70:35 - this site will be back with react and
70:40 - that we'll be doing will be doing
70:43 - everything at that point we'll probably
70:46 - like back in front end everything to
70:50 - build this if a question from MH r says
71:00 - best text editors best text editors for
71:08 - JavaScript PHP etc I like I like atom
71:16 - that's like my main editor but I'm using
71:19 - Visual Studio code right now I also like
71:21 - that I'm still not really that used to
71:26 - Visual Studio code so sorry uh-huh kept
71:36 - feeling that sneeze coming on us hoping
71:41 - we just go away okay so I'm not that
71:44 - used to Visual Studio code yet I like it
71:46 - and I can see a lot of potential in it
71:48 - I'm not sure it hasn't been out as long
71:51 - as Adams so I'm not sure like in terms
71:53 - of the the package ecosystem of you know
71:57 - it doesn't have as much available for
72:01 - customization in terms of like packages
72:03 - already made I don't really know
72:08 - i-i-i go with those two I've heard
72:11 - though that sublime is good a lot a lot
72:14 - of people it seems like a lot of people
72:17 - that do videos on YouTube use sublime
72:21 - those are really the only ones that I'm
72:23 - familiar with
72:25 - I used to use notepad plus plus back in
72:28 - the day I don't really recommend it but
72:32 - it was better than regular notepad
72:34 - starting out
72:51 - okay so Shay says hey Jessi what made
72:55 - you settle on react and material design
72:57 - for the new university sites and
73:00 - thoughts of WordPress moving away from
73:02 - reactants just announced okay so for the
73:05 - first question for the material design
73:11 - aspect of it I needed so we don't have
73:15 - any web designers here at the University
73:19 - so basically when I was hired we didn't
73:22 - really have like a standard a fully
73:25 - developed standard so we had all you
73:27 - know different sites with you know
73:30 - really different I don't know they they
73:37 - just looked they had some elements that
73:39 - were similar but I mean they they just
73:41 - looked really weird and they had like
73:47 - not even that the hex colors weren't
73:49 - even the same sometimes so it was just
73:51 - kind of a little bit of a mess so I knew
73:54 - we needed like we needed something that
73:56 - could be cohesive right but I I had to
74:00 - develop these sites mainly that like my
74:03 - main job was I had to actually build it
74:05 - you know I had to develop that mostly
74:06 - front-end but even sometimes back-end
74:08 - stuff so I knew like I needed to just
74:12 - settle on a premade system that I knew
74:15 - worked and I could go with so I liked
74:20 - material design I thought it was nice it
74:23 - was simple the docks are very clear and
74:26 - easy to understand there are also like
74:31 - frameworks like materialized that were
74:33 - really easy to use and you know
74:37 - developed I mean when I first started
74:38 - using and it was in the early stages so
74:40 - there were some buggy stuff but I mean
74:42 - now it's pretty reliable so I just I
74:48 - chose you know it shows the material
74:50 - design because you know it seemed to me
74:54 - like a very simple well known design
74:57 - that users would be familiar with
74:59 - already so they wouldn't have to guess
75:01 - what they're supposed to do or what
75:03 - different things
75:04 - and the site you know they I like the
75:07 - idea that it's so widely used that you
75:11 - make sure user immediately familiar with
75:14 - your UI I didn't want people to have to
75:16 - guess what they're supposed to do so
75:18 - anyway that's what I went with I'm sure
75:20 - there there are other things I could
75:21 - have gone with but I'm not I'm happy
75:24 - with with going with material design in
75:29 - terms of react react was the decision to
75:34 - go with react came later I mean I knew
75:40 - like everybody kept hearing about react
75:42 - so I knew like when if when I first
75:44 - started hearing about it it was this
75:46 - cool thing but I wasn't sure I mean you
75:49 - know you know how it is like there's
75:51 - always new new things coming and going
75:53 - with JavaScript but it just kept staying
75:57 - around and getting bigger and bigger and
75:59 - then I'd hear more about it and then
76:00 - it'd be like every talk at a conference
76:02 - was talking about react and you know all
76:05 - these videos on YouTube we're talking
76:08 - about react and so then I just I started
76:11 - I started using I started messing around
76:14 - with it and I build I build some stuff
76:20 - with it I built like a site or for a
76:23 - client with it got familiar with it I
76:25 - really started to like it and I I like
76:30 - that there's so many people using it
76:33 - because there's there's always a lot of
76:36 - information if I have a problem with
76:37 - something in react I can usually find
76:39 - the answer very quickly
76:42 - I'm not saying reacts the only system
76:43 - like that but it's it's nice so I mean
76:46 - there are some other systems that I
76:48 - could use besides react but they just
76:49 - don't have that user base so that's kind
76:55 - of why with react I mean it's not it's
77:01 - not really like I sat down and really
77:03 - evaluated all the different systems it
77:05 - was just kind of going with you know
77:07 - I've used this a little bit I've used
77:08 - that a little bit what's really gonna
77:10 - work for us right now and what's likely
77:12 - to be to stick around for a while in the
77:15 - future right I don't want to like with
77:16 - the site we have right now
77:17 - we're in a position where the CMS that
77:20 - we use Ektron their company got bought
77:22 - out by another company I'm not even sure
77:25 - you know what the supports like if
77:27 - there's still updates like it's
77:29 - basically a dead content management
77:31 - system right there's not really anybody
77:34 - that works on it there are very few
77:36 - companies and developers that work with
77:38 - that system so you're kind of stuck and
77:40 - end up having to pay a lot of money for
77:42 - work that in my opinion from looking at
77:45 - the work isn't really that great so I
77:49 - don't want to be in that situation again
77:50 - so right now trying to find a react
77:52 - developer is a lot easier than trying to
77:56 - find let's say like an extra one right
77:58 - so I don't know I think it sets us up in
78:01 - a good position to be able to bring
78:03 - people on either as employees or as like
78:07 - contract workers that will be familiar
78:09 - with our system
78:10 - they'll be familiar with material design
78:11 - they'll be familiar with react so now
78:15 - that was what kind of my thoughts just
78:16 - kind of thinking ahead as to you know
78:18 - what's and that's the same way we went
78:20 - with like WordPress for a lot of
78:22 - handling a lot of our data as a content
78:24 - management system we could have gone
78:25 - with some other stuff we use Drupal for
78:28 - some other sites that have been built
78:30 - you know by outside contractors but I
78:33 - like to stay with WordPress because it
78:34 - has the largest market share right now
78:36 - among CMS's at least at least last time
78:41 - I checked I think it had the largest
78:42 - market share so once again if I needed
78:45 - to hire somebody to work on that my odds
78:48 - of finding a wordpress developer are
78:50 - greater than finding a developer of
78:52 - probably any other type of CMS right now
78:55 - so the next part this ended up being a
78:59 - long answer to the question so I mean
79:01 - they were there really like three
79:02 - questions here so the third question
79:05 - thoughts of moving WordPress away of
79:08 - WordPress moving away from react that's
79:10 - the first I heard of it I haven't seen
79:12 - anything about it so I have I guess I
79:14 - don't have any thoughts because I don't
79:15 - have any details right now my first
79:19 - reaction was is this about the react
79:23 - license I don't know I mean I but I have
79:29 - no idea I'll have to
79:30 - I'll have to find out more about it but
79:35 - I'm really interested to see what their
79:37 - reasoning is though if it's just about
79:40 - the licensing I'm not that worried about
79:41 - it because I mean I'm a little guy I'm
79:45 - not I'm not gonna be on anybody's radar
79:48 - with anything I'm doing I'm just I'm not
79:50 - worried about that but I could see why
79:53 - WordPress might be worried about that
80:14 - jonbi says my favorite text editor is a
80:17 - stone tablet and a chisel that's
80:19 - old-school I had a meeting one time when
80:23 - I was doing some like subcontracting
80:26 - work for a media marketing company and
80:29 - we had a Skype meeting with everybody
80:31 - that worked for this place were all like
80:33 - remote workers so we had a Skype meeting
80:35 - try to get everybody together to talk to
80:38 - each other because we had never met met
80:40 - before there were people working that
80:41 - with this company that I had never met
80:43 - in my life and they they heard me they
80:51 - liked they heard the sound of my pen
80:52 - writing on a paper and they were all
80:55 - like what are you doing you seriously
80:57 - use paper they were all shocked that I
80:59 - still used paper especially in a Skype
81:03 - meeting so sometimes it's nice I've
81:07 - never gone so old old school to use you
81:10 - know a chisel but I I can understand
81:15 - wanting to you know physically you know
81:18 - leave some marks on something
81:36 - let's see Rishabh says what is html5
81:41 - boilerplate
81:52 - actually I'm thinking so John Hutten in
81:55 - John Hanson says a boiler plate is a
81:59 - node NPM install environment many out
82:02 - there maybe you mean a keystroke
82:04 - shortcut for HTML and your editor yeah
82:08 - I'm not sure I guess maybe I don't know
82:13 - for sure but I thought html5 boilerplate
82:16 - was just like a starter like some markup
82:23 - just to get you started that just has
82:25 - some of the basic stuff you need I like
82:29 - something similar to what like now I
82:35 - don't really know I might have to look
82:36 - this up now because I maybe I'm
82:38 - second-guessing what I thought html5
82:41 - boilerplate was I'll look it up after
82:46 - this jadyn all right now
82:52 - Jambi says what resource have you been
82:56 - using to learn c-sharp slash asp.net
83:03 - umberto I've been using umberto in the
83:06 - live stream that's that's my resource so
83:08 - he's not here right now but he's gonna
83:10 - he's actually on a flight right now to
83:13 - Denver so he sent me a message earlier
83:16 - to let me know he wouldn't be in the
83:18 - chat so he'll probably hear this later
83:20 - but that's pretty much it I I've I've
83:23 - been relying on Umberto's expertise and
83:26 - your help in the live chat mainly
83:29 - because I I don't see the benefit of me
83:36 - learning that much of it right now
83:39 - because for two reasons one this is
83:44 - right now is the only site that I'll
83:46 - ever need to work on in the foreseeable
83:48 - future that uses dotnet c-sharp the
83:54 - second reason is we're getting we hired
83:57 - a new web developer he won't be in my
84:01 - department he's gonna work in another
84:02 - department here but his job is gonna be
84:06 - to handle all like the dotnet c-sharp
84:09 - stuff so he starts October 2nd that's
84:14 - just in a couple of weeks so if any if I
84:17 - need any help with that
84:19 - I'm supposed to go go to him and I'm
84:22 - gonna handle you know a lot of the all
84:25 - the react stuff that we've been doing
84:26 - like that's gonna be my domain and I'm
84:29 - gonna be in charge of making sure that
84:31 - the branding standards on the web like
84:33 - the style guide is all enforced so this
84:36 - other guy's gonna handle the C sharp and
84:40 - dotnet stuff and then he's gonna come to
84:43 - me when he needs more like front-end
84:48 - design related stuff so that's how it's
84:54 - gonna work out so I just don't see the
84:56 - benefit right now and me spending a lot
84:58 - of time learning something that I'm not
84:59 - likely to use so I just kind of want to
85:02 - learn enough to get by
85:04 - and get this to a point where it's
85:06 - better I mean honestly it's not really
85:10 - gonna be that hard to make it better
85:11 - than it is right now cuz it's really
85:13 - slow right now but I want to try to make
85:17 - it as good as I can without wasting my
85:20 - time learning something so right now all
85:23 - of my learning time is going into
85:26 - learning react so I'm learning Redux
85:28 - right now and I just started learning
85:30 - react native like maybe two days ago I
85:33 - started on the react native part of the
85:36 - course I'm taking so and that's what
85:39 - I'll be doing after work today and all
85:41 - day Saturday and so hopefully I'll have
85:44 - hopefully I'll have a Redux project
85:46 - finished and then maybe on Monday I can
85:49 - show you all it's already in on my
85:53 - github so like my personal github
85:59 - account has its like Udacity readable or
86:03 - something if you want to check it out
86:06 - the design on it is really crazy in old
86:09 - school so I think I will show you all
86:11 - when I'm ready to finished just just for
86:14 - fun definitely not material design
86:24 - okay Shree Kampf asks is this the new
86:29 - project yes it is the new project James
86:38 - Moore says is learning asp.net MVC
86:41 - advantageous as a front-end developer it
86:49 - depends on what you want to do I guess I
86:52 - usually say when I'm asked about what
86:58 - what to learn really is it just depends
87:02 - so if you like working with this stuff
87:04 - or if you know of a company you really
87:06 - want to work for that uses it then yeah
87:09 - it would be advantageous if if you're
87:13 - talking though more in general what's
87:15 - that meant Aegis for a front-end
87:16 - developer
87:17 - I'd say focus on JavaScript because as a
87:21 - front-end developer you're pretty much
87:23 - always going to be using javascript no
87:26 - matter what else you're using you know
87:29 - Java scripts everywhere so I mean
87:31 - obviously HTML and CSS right you have to
87:33 - know that but those are a little bit
87:37 - easier to learn enough to be decent with
87:41 - but I would say if you're not sure
87:45 - exactly what you want to do but you know
87:47 - you want to do front-end stick with
87:49 - JavaScript and then once you start to
87:51 - get an idea of what you like then you
87:54 - can choose something else to pick up as
87:57 - well but I wouldn't if someone just came
88:03 - up and said hey I want to be a friend of
88:04 - developer what would I learn I probably
88:06 - never say dotnet that would not be first
88:09 - on my list
88:20 - okay there there's been like a running
88:23 - discussion about text editors throughout
88:26 - the live chat and now Lara says surely
88:29 - vim or Emacs is the best it's always I
88:35 - feel like we've had this discussion so
88:38 - many times on the live chat about about
88:42 - editors I really just need to do a video
88:45 - about editors and then just refer people
88:47 - to that but honestly I know I've already
88:53 - said what editors I use and what I like
88:55 - I've seen people use them and it looks
88:58 - really cool so I like them I have no
89:03 - idea how to use them I've never used X I
89:05 - tried to use it once and I know
89:09 - everybody says this and it's a joke but
89:11 - I honestly did have trouble
89:14 - exiting them right it looks like so I've
89:19 - just never really had the time to be
89:21 - able to try to learn it one day maybe
89:25 - one day I want to be you know the person
89:27 - that does a live demo at a conference
89:29 - using them and looks awesome like but so
89:35 - I don't disagree that BAM and I think
89:37 - Emacs is a similar situation and you see
89:39 - somebody using Emacs you're like wow
89:43 - Emacs and then so let's see
89:56 - okay so John B says the WordPress issue
89:58 - is about the react license yes they
90:01 - decided to go away from react so as not
90:04 - to propagate the issues of the patent
90:07 - issue to anyone who uses Gutenberg the
90:10 - WordPress tool okay that makes sense
90:13 - yeah that makes a lot of sense that's
90:15 - what I figured so basically now that I
90:20 - know for sure that it was the patent
90:22 - issue my thoughts on the whole WordPress
90:26 - moving away from react thing is one I'm
90:28 - like kind of disappointed because I was
90:29 - excited about WordPress using react so
90:32 - much but in terms of the impact this is
90:37 - gonna have on react in general and on my
90:39 - use of it is it's not gonna impact my
90:42 - use of it at all and I don't think it's
90:44 - gonna have my opinion in my unqualified
90:47 - opinion but I don't really think it's
90:50 - gonna have a huge impact on react
90:52 - I think WordPress using react was a cool
90:56 - thing and it made WordPress seem like
91:02 - seemed like it was really moving forward
91:05 - and changing and kind of I don't I don't
91:09 - want to say being more relevant cuz
91:11 - WordPress is already you know it has a
91:12 - lot of market share but it made me think
91:14 - that like WordPress was really that kind
91:17 - of forward thinking and trying to push
91:18 - things but in terms of react it didn't
91:21 - make me think very much of anything
91:23 - about react it was just one more
91:26 - organization added to the long list of
91:28 - organizations that are to use it so in
91:30 - my opinion WordPress saying they're not
91:33 - using react anymore is kind of lowers my
91:37 - opinion of WordPress but not of react if
91:40 - that makes sense
91:41 - I still like WordPress and I'll still
91:43 - use WordPress and I totally understand
91:45 - their reasoning for it and I don't know
91:50 - if I was in the same position I might do
91:51 - this do the same thing but I don't think
91:56 - it's gonna have a that big of an impact
91:59 - on on react it'll be a much bigger
92:02 - impact on on WordPress in terms of the
92:06 - direction that they'll they'll be going
92:07 - in now I don't know what they're gonna
92:09 - replace
92:09 - with but they were really seen like
92:11 - there one in the direction of at some
92:15 - point down the road the wordpress api
92:18 - would be the main way things were done
92:19 - and a lot of you'll be using a lot of
92:23 - react interacting with the api instead
92:27 - of PHP interacting with the database and
92:29 - using templates like at least that's
92:33 - that's where i thought it was gonna go
92:35 - but now i'm not sure i mean they could
92:38 - just they could start using view right i
92:40 - mean maybe they could use pre act so i
92:42 - mean they could switch something else in
92:43 - there and keep going a new but probably
92:45 - be the same but anyway i'm gonna stop
92:48 - talking because I feel like I'm in over
92:50 - my head and I'm not I'm not qualified a
92:55 - strong opinion on this
93:12 - Chasez jonbi yep it makes sense for
93:15 - their business I just wonder if it will
93:17 - be a big enough issue to slow Reax
93:19 - growth or for Facebook to change things
93:22 - yeah that's my my thoughts on it or no
93:26 - it's not gonna change anything for react
93:31 - I think Facebook's so big and they have
93:35 - so many other things they're doing like
93:36 - it just it's not it seems like a big
93:38 - deal to us because we're developers and
93:40 - like we hear about the stuff every day
93:43 - but in the grand scheme of things react
93:46 - is such a it's a small part of what
93:48 - Facebook's doing you know to the world
93:51 - right I mean when I talk to people who
93:53 - aren't developers they have no idea what
93:55 - react is they've never heard about it in
93:57 - their lives I mean I can tell them like
93:59 - hey all these other sites use it and
94:01 - they know like okay that's cool but they
94:03 - have no idea they know what Facebook is
94:06 - and they know a lot of stuff about
94:07 - Facebook but they have no idea of react
94:09 - is so so that's that's why I just I
94:12 - don't think Facebook's gonna really care
94:14 - enough they're happy to just try to
94:17 - protect themselves from lawsuits which
94:19 - is from my understanding that's why the
94:21 - their license is the way it is okay
94:29 - Laura says html5 boilerplate is like a
94:32 - template set up to quickly throw a
94:34 - website together okay so it's what I
94:35 - thought it was all right cool so so yeah
94:39 - so essentially it's it's a more kind of
94:45 - bare-bones version of what I was trying
94:46 - to do with this
94:48 - this fus homepage thing these are
94:51 - originally based on the starter template
94:53 - I made I wanted just to have some
94:55 - bare-bones stuff that somebody let's say
94:58 - like from another department so maybe
95:00 - like the new developer that's coming in
95:01 - if they wanted a starting point to go
95:03 - with it had a lot of the basic styles
95:05 - that we use and they could just put
95:07 - together a site they could just you know
95:09 - pull this down from github and and
95:12 - already have a lot of it built out or if
95:15 - we needed to go with an outside
95:18 - contractor I could just say hey like
95:21 - start with this and utilize what we have
95:25 - and then that way it would hopefully
95:27 - save us some money
95:28 - because they wouldn't and sometime we
95:32 - wouldn't have as much back and forth of
95:34 - trying to make sure that they fit the
95:35 - brand standards because they would it
95:37 - would already be built into this so like
95:42 - I said html5 boilerplate doesn't go
95:44 - quite that far it's not as opinionated
95:45 - on style like CSS and things like that
95:48 - and you know but it'll just give you
95:50 - some basic you know like this type of
95:52 - basic stuff right that you need for
95:55 - every site so I I don't recall exactly
95:57 - how much is in there but just helps you
96:02 - skip some of those really basic things
96:04 - that there's no reason you need to do
96:06 - that by hand
96:18 - okay Lord says reasoning behind react
96:24 - license makes sense but also raises some
96:26 - issues patent law is flawed and react
96:28 - license as a product of trying to
96:30 - protect against those flaws yeah that's
96:33 - a good point yeah I mean really if you
96:36 - think about a patent law was you know it
96:39 - was all developed way before you know we
96:42 - had like software like we have today or
96:44 - the internet or anything so it's it's
96:46 - definitely it makes sense that patent
96:51 - laws is not keeping up well with with
96:55 - the way things are now so it definitely
96:59 - needs to need some updating no beer says
97:15 - okay nobody's talking about text editors
97:19 - here I thought it wasn't sure for a
97:21 - second either read through that okay
97:28 - they were they were talking about
97:30 - notepad plus plus for for editing and it
97:35 - seems like it can be useful but yeah
97:40 - like I started out I started out on
97:42 - notepad just regular notepad and that
97:44 - wasn't thinking about it now that was
97:46 - insane trying to build websites with
97:48 - notepad and then I went to notepad plus
97:51 - plus and that was that was cool there
97:53 - were a lot of cool features that I was
97:54 - just kind of learning and once I
97:58 - switched though from notepad plus plus
98:00 - plus to Adam I never wanted to go back
98:03 - like it was obviously better and things
98:08 - like Adam are obviously better so I'm
98:12 - sure there are probably some cool
98:14 - features with notepad plus plus that I
98:16 - didn't know about and I never used so
98:17 - there might be some some up useful
98:19 - things I'm just missing but it was
98:22 - Mike's my experience was that I really
98:25 - liked Adam a lot better Abdul Azeez asks
98:36 - how many languages needed to learn to be
98:38 - a back-end developer so I would say it I
98:50 - mean it kind of depends so I think the
98:55 - easiest route and this is the route that
98:57 - I'm kind of taking is learning
99:03 - JavaScript front-end and back-end will
99:05 - allow you of I think the fastest route
99:09 - to full stack front-end and back-end
99:12 - because you know the syntax is all the
99:15 - same it's one it's the same language
99:17 - then you have to learn how to interact
99:18 - with a database and you just have to
99:22 - decide I guess you know what kind of
99:26 - database you want to wear
99:27 - with sequel no sequel I mean it's so I
99:32 - mean potentially you could get away with
99:35 - knowing one language and do that I mean
99:38 - obviously you're gonna be limited to
99:40 - just that language but you you could
99:44 - build you know complete apps and things
99:48 - just with JavaScript and knowing how to
99:51 - interact with some sort of database but
99:56 - it I mean it kind of depends on what you
99:58 - want to do what you want to work on and
100:01 - in that case you could go like no beer
100:04 - just mentioned PHP Ruby ASP and then
100:10 - database languages he says my sequel
100:13 - MongoDB right even things like right
100:18 - like c-sharp Java
100:21 - I'm sure there's there's other languages
100:24 - less common that are being used Python
100:28 - it's another big one I was forgetting so
100:32 - and there are some industries that use
100:35 - really like ancient programming
100:38 - languages as well so there's a lot of
100:40 - things that you could you could you
100:45 - could pick from but I mean if you wanted
100:48 - like my personal advice on it I I think
100:52 - the fastest route is full stack
100:54 - javascript is that the best in terms of
100:58 - like career-wise right now or salary I
101:01 - don't really know I'd have to you know
101:03 - see some data about that but but you
101:09 - can't deny it's easier to learn one
101:10 - language than to write
101:21 - hahaha Patrick wrote : WQ it I mentioned
101:29 - earlier that I couldn't exit them so in
101:31 - case you're not familiar with them
101:32 - that's how you exit : w kiss I remember
101:37 - it now now that you put it up there yet
101:40 - that's that's what it was
101:43 - he's been tutor for the win
101:54 - this lost my place there we go
101:57 - Blake says we should build react 2.0
102:00 - actually what are they on with three
102:02 - aren't they it's just about to release
102:04 - react 16 or something down there you
102:08 - never like see the version number it's
102:10 - always just react but I think it's
102:12 - sixteen Rijn arrow says I need help
102:20 - please can some good person help me
102:21 - understanding big o-notation pretty
102:23 - please I don't know anything about big
102:27 - o-notation but free code camp has a
102:31 - series on their YouTube channel on big
102:33 - o-notation so check out the playlists on
102:36 - this channel and if you scroll down I
102:38 - think it was it's kind of an older
102:40 - series but if you scroll down you'll see
102:42 - that there's a us I think it's a whole
102:44 - series on big o-notation if not a series
102:47 - there's at least one one video maybe
102:49 - more so check that out and I think I
102:55 - watch some of it but I ended up not
102:58 - getting through it because I thought I
102:59 - don't really need to know this right now
103:01 - I should be learning something more
103:03 - relevant to my work so but definitely
103:06 - check that out and if it's useful let me
103:09 - know and then I'll recommend it to other
103:11 - people as well
103:23 - smiler says hi where can I deploy my
103:26 - first dotnet website for studying
103:28 - purposes and like my portfolio
103:33 - [Music]
103:40 - okay so Blake says you could do it on
103:43 - cloud nine
103:45 - so it's c9i oh that's a great idea I
103:48 - wasn't thinking about that Blake but
103:50 - that's that is probably the easiest way
103:52 - to just get something up quickly
103:55 - otherwise I don't know I've actually not
103:58 - I've never deployed a dotnet website on
104:02 - my own I've always just worked on ones
104:04 - that are already deployed so so I'm I
104:09 - can't really help you that much with it
104:11 - sorry about that I dunno we have someone
104:15 - that's normally in the live chat and
104:16 - they just couldn't make it today so if
104:17 - you come back for some future live
104:20 - streams umberto who's in the live chat
104:23 - and he works with with C sharp and
104:28 - dotnet so he'd definitely be able to get
104:31 - you get you on the right track
104:40 - Ranieri says can you tell me the runtime
104:42 - for this please could you add the
104:45 - runtimes
104:55 - right now what do you mean by runtimes
104:57 - trying to screw up and see if I missed
104:59 - something
105:29 - okay
105:40 - okay so they were taught there there's a
105:44 - lot of stuff about big o-notation I'm
105:46 - not gonna read it all I'll just pick out
105:48 - some things and then we're pretty much
105:50 - at the end of the live chat so talking
105:55 - about Jambi says in response I was
105:57 - saying I don't know that much about big
105:59 - o-notation I didn't take the time to
106:00 - really learn it cuz I didn't think it
106:01 - would be useful for me at the time but
106:04 - John B says that Big O is useful it
106:07 - tells you worst case complexity for an
106:09 - algorithm gives a good indicator if an
106:11 - approach to an algorithm is bad or not
106:14 - for example like doing a for loop in a
106:18 - for loop that's bad okay that's
106:20 - interesting I didn't think about that
106:22 - now that you say that I'm starting to
106:25 - remember a little bit about what I did
106:27 - learn about Big O notation so yeah ayat
106:32 - that could I think at the time I just
106:34 - thought like wow I'm not really doing
106:35 - anything where I even need to worry
106:39 - about stuff like that I was just working
106:40 - on a lot of small like one-page websites
106:43 - that use like the only JavaScript it
106:47 - used was just for like UI interactions
106:50 - like a side nav and you know or some
106:55 - type of scroll effect or something like
106:57 - that so but I could definitely see now
107:00 - that I'm getting into some more in-depth
107:02 - things it could be useful maybe I was to
107:07 - take a look at that video series when I
107:10 - get a chance
107:26 - let's see James Moore says I appreciate
107:30 - your services no beer it says Jessie
107:34 - thanks for streaming you're welcome
107:35 - thanks for watching and thanks for
107:37 - participating in the live chat alright
107:45 - okay that's it that's the end of the
107:48 - live end of the live chat so we're gonna
107:51 - finish up the stream here thank you for
107:55 - watching everybody
107:56 - and thanks for all your help and all
108:00 - your contributions to the live chat is a
108:03 - good stream today we got done exactly

108:08 - too many errors and so there's a good
108:12 - day great way to end the week so I'm
108:15 - gonna be busy this weekend
108:16 - working on some some Redux and learning
108:20 - about react native so hopefully I have
108:23 - some cool stuff to share with you on
108:25 - Monday and I hope you all have a great
108:28 - weekend hopefully not as busy as mine
108:30 - but I hope you have a fun weekend or at
