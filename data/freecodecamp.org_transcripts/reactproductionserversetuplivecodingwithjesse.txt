00:11 - hey everybody sorry about that I didn't
00:13 - realize the stream was was already up uh
00:17 - it's Jesse and if you haven't watched
00:20 - before this this show is just about me
00:23 - doing my work I'm a front-end
00:26 - developer and I want to show my normal
00:28 - work and and you'll see all my mistakes
00:32 - and everything and just get an idea for
00:34 - what it's like for a frontend developer
00:37 - to work at least for
00:39 - me today we have a very ambitious
00:43 - plan we want to set up from
00:47 - scratch a digital ocean droplet a server
00:51 - to be able to run
00:55 - react I not I'm almost positive there's
00:59 - no way I can get this down in a half an
01:00 - hour so hey guys everybody saying hi in
01:05 - the live
01:06 - chat so I have two options either I
01:09 - split this up and do it over two days so
01:11 - today and tomorrow or I can just try to
01:13 - do an extra long video
01:17 - today and try to get it all done so I
01:21 - think it'll probably depend on how many
01:23 - people are watching at the end of a half
01:26 - an
01:27 - hour if there's a lot of viewers Maybe
01:30 - just keep going if it's kind of dropping
01:31 - off then we'll see maybe I'll split it
01:34 - up into two
01:36 - videos uh but either way I need to have
01:39 - it done because I'd like to have
01:42 - something up and running to show uh the
01:44 - people that I'm making the site for uh
01:48 - to show them what's going on and to test
01:50 - it uh working with the API where all the
01:54 - content is going to come
01:55 - from okay so uh we have opposing
01:59 - viewpoints in the live chat someone's
02:01 - saying split it up into two videos
02:03 - someone's saying make it work today all
02:06 - right we'll see I'll I'll think about it
02:08 - we'll see how far we get uh if if we're
02:12 - close if we're close to being done then
02:14 - maybe maybe we'll go a little bit longer
02:16 - but if I think it's going to take like
02:18 - an extra hour then maybe I'll split it
02:21 - up uh so I haven't set up a server in
02:24 - this way in
02:26 - probably maybe like three months so
02:30 - uh we'll see I'll be a little
02:33 - rusty so before we start real quick
02:38 - uh the site this site that I'm working
02:40 - on now is probably going to launch May
02:42 - 25th is the official launch date now
02:45 - unless that changes uh after that I'm
02:47 - going to start doing tutorial videos on
02:49 - my channel the link is in the
02:51 - description uh I'll do all the live
02:54 - stream still on free code camp and then
02:55 - I'll just throw the tutorial videos on
02:57 - my own
02:58 - channel I had a lot of suggestions for
03:01 - different things to do tutorials on so
03:03 - I'm I'm keeping a list of everything
03:05 - that you all suggest in the live chat or
03:07 - in the comments and I'd like to uh do
03:10 - some short very focused videos on each
03:13 - one of those
03:15 - topics all right uh the rest of the week
03:18 - in case you haven't seen this yet I've
03:20 - showed it the last couple of of videos
03:23 - uh tomorrow is also a different time
03:24 - than normal it's going to be 11:30 a.m.
03:27 - sorry about the time change this is just
03:29 - because I have so many meetings today
03:31 - and
03:32 - tomorrow Wednesday I will be traveling
03:35 - to a conference to syntax conon so I
03:38 - don't know if I'll be able to live
03:39 - stream or when so I'll just put it on
03:43 - Twitter when I'm going to live stream
03:46 - and I think you'll get an alert if
03:48 - you're subscribed to free code Camp uh
03:50 - if you want to get the uh the Tweet as
03:52 - well then uh follow me on Twitter the
03:56 - link to my Twitter account is also in
03:58 - the description
04:00 - and then Thursday and Friday I'll be at
04:03 - syntax conon I did get permission from
04:05 - the people with syntax conon to record
04:08 - and live stream as long as the speakers
04:10 - are cool with it so I have some ideas
04:14 - for what to do but I want to know what
04:15 - you want to see okay so I'm I'm going to
04:18 - this syntax
04:19 - con uh they're going to have front-end
04:22 - stuff backend stuff and uh some talks on
04:24 - different
04:26 - platforms so let me know I was thinking
04:30 - maybe I could do interviews with some of
04:31 - the speakers or even some of other
04:33 - people there maybe I could just do quick
04:35 - Recaps of the sessions that I go to and
04:38 - just show some of the
04:40 - highlights so I'm not really sure what
04:43 - you want to see what would be you know
04:46 - realistic to do I'm also not really sure
04:48 - how good the Wi-Fi is going to be so
04:50 - they might be pre-recorded videos
04:51 - instead of live streams but let me know
04:54 - in the live chat or in the comments what
04:56 - you would like to see as long as you
04:58 - comment before you know Thursday morning
05:01 - uh then I I'll be able to read it and
05:04 - hopefully uh do whatever you guys you
05:08 - know want me to do whatever you want to
05:09 - see all right so let's get started since
05:12 - we have a lot to do I'm going to be
05:16 - neglecting the live chat slightly more
05:19 - than usual today because there's so much
05:21 - to do and I don't want to miss a step
05:24 - because it could could mess things up
05:28 - all right cool somebody said just start
05:31 - bro all right
05:34 - so I want to start this from scratch so
05:36 - I I did the very first step beforehand
05:39 - I'll just show you what that was I
05:41 - logged on to digital ocean I already
05:43 - have an account on digital ocean I just
05:45 - went in I clicked create droplet and I
05:47 - came to this screen we're selecting
05:50 - Ubuntu
05:52 - 16.04 we've chosen the $5 a month
05:55 - droplet we can always scale this up
05:57 - later if we get a lot of traffic
06:00 - but for now this should work uh and then
06:03 - you can pick uh New York data centers
06:06 - are closest to my location so that's
06:08 - what I
06:10 - pick I've added the um IPv6 networking I
06:16 - forgot to click the monitoring which I
06:18 - should have you can always add it in
06:19 - later but it's a little bit harder so I
06:22 - would recommend just clicking the
06:23 - monitoring I didn't need any of this
06:25 - other stuff for right now I already have
06:27 - my SSH Keys added in here and these are
06:29 - some of the SSH keys for my colleagues
06:32 - so
06:35 - um if you don't have these added in you
06:38 - can add them in later on after you've
06:40 - created the droplet and then you just
06:42 - give it a name and you click create and
06:43 - it's as easy as that and then you have
06:45 - your droplet up and running so this is
06:48 - my droplet now so I can get my IP
06:50 - address and log into the droplet the
06:54 - first step to log in is simply to put
06:57 - in in the in your terminal SSH and then
07:02 - root at and then you put in your IP
07:04 - address okay assuming that you had your
07:07 - SSH Keys set up already then it logs you
07:11 - in and and you're good to go uh I'm not
07:14 - going to go over the SSH key things
07:16 - since I already had them set up but I
07:18 - definitely recommend using it I'll
07:20 - probably do a video on it at some point
07:22 - because it's it's pretty important you
07:24 - you use it a lot uh but it saves you
07:26 - from having that passwords in fact we're
07:28 - going to completely disable passwords on
07:29 - the server and just have uh you know
07:33 - have the SSH keys and it'll just make it
07:36 - a little bit more
07:37 - secure uh since there'll be no way to
07:41 - log in with the password so if you want
07:43 - to follow along I always use the
07:47 - instructions on digital ocean to set
07:49 - this up when I go through it doesn't
07:50 - matter how many times I do it if you
07:52 - miss a step then things might not work
07:56 - right or it might be bad for security so
07:59 - I always just follow along a lot of the
08:01 - steps I I remember and I could do pretty
08:04 - quickly but I don't want to trust that
08:06 - to memory I have the links in the
08:08 - description first we're going to install
08:12 - uh well we're going to set up Ubuntu
08:15 - it's already installed and then we're
08:16 - going to move on to engine X and then
08:18 - we'll see how far we can go maybe we'll
08:20 - get to node after that but the first
08:23 - two uh tutorials are linked in the
08:27 - description all right so I am now on
08:30 - step two if you want to follow
08:32 - along and we're going to create a user
08:35 - because we don't want to log in as root
08:36 - all the
08:37 - time so we actually are pretty much
08:39 - never going to use root again after we
08:41 - create this other user so I'm just going
08:44 - to go add
08:48 - users sometimes I'm going to type them
08:50 - out sometimes I'm just going to copy and
08:51 - paste them I don't think there's
08:53 - anything wrong with copying and pasting
08:54 - things into the terminal because you
08:57 - know one one mistake in the command
08:59 - doesn't work so for longer commands
09:01 - copying pasting is the way to
09:03 - go and I'm just going to
09:06 - make the user
09:08 - Jesse it can be
09:13 - anything it's going to ask you for
09:17 - password this is not the login
09:20 - password it's going to ask you for some
09:22 - of your info you don't really need to
09:24 - fill this
09:25 - out if you're in uh kind of a bigger
09:28 - organization
09:30 - maybe you might want to fill this out so
09:32 - people know who you are it's primarily
09:34 - going to be me logging in and working on
09:36 - this so it doesn't really matter I'll
09:38 - just put my
09:39 - name okay so now that user is set
09:45 - up and we need to give that user root
09:48 - privileges okay so that password that we
09:50 - just typed in that's not your login
09:52 - password remember there will be no login
09:54 - password it's just going to be SSH keys
09:56 - to get in this password is going to be
09:58 - what you use when you try to use pseudo
10:01 - which means basically this user called
10:04 - Jesse is going to have privileges to do
10:06 - things that only root can normally do
10:09 - I'll need to run the command pseudo to
10:11 - be able to do those things as if I were
10:14 - the root user and I'm going to need that
10:16 - password so if anybody were to ever
10:20 - somehow get on my machine so they had my
10:22 - SSH key and be able to log in as uh as
10:27 - Jesse as me they would still need to
10:29 - know my password to actually do anything
10:32 - as the root user and generally root
10:35 - commands
10:36 - are I mean they could mess up your whole
10:38 - server you can do anything as root so
10:41 - it's a added layer of security it's
10:43 - slightly annoying to have to retype your
10:44 - password
10:46 - but it's definitely uh it's definitely
10:49 - better to have that that little bit of
10:51 - security I don't recommend having no
10:53 - password for that i' I've never tried to
10:56 - do that but I assume it's possible
11:01 - okay so now we're going to give the
11:04 - Privileges I'm going to copy and paste
11:11 - this so the example name they're using
11:15 - in the digital ocean instructions is
11:18 - Sammy so I'm just need to change Sammy
11:20 - to
11:22 - Jesse okay and
11:25 - now that user has
11:29 - uh pseudo
11:31 - privileges if you're following along
11:33 - with me we're going to skip step four
11:35 - because I've I've already done this
11:36 - earlier so if you haven't set up your
11:38 - SSH Keys then you will need to do step
11:42 - four if you are using digital ocean I
11:45 - recommend you know set those up so that
11:48 - you can use them in the the actual
11:50 - creation of the droplet and it'll save
11:52 - you some
11:57 - time so we're skipping all the way to
12:00 - step five and this is optional but
12:04 - recommended we're going to disable
12:06 - password authenication so I don't I
12:08 - don't want anybody to be able to use a
12:09 - password to log into the
12:11 - server so what I'm going to do before
12:14 - that is I'm actually going to log out of
12:18 - the root
12:22 - user let's see I think exit there we go
12:25 - so I just typed exit that logs me out
12:28 - and now I'm going to SSH back in but I'm
12:31 - going to change from
12:33 - root to
12:36 - Jesse and it denied my
12:39 - public
12:44 - no I guess I skipped a
12:47 - step this is the point of doing this
12:50 - live so you see when I mess up
12:52 - and hopefully you don't feel bad as you
12:54 - when you mess up I've already done it
12:57 - I'm going to scroll up quickly
13:00 - and see what I
13:21 - missed oh okay I'm I'm pretty sure I
13:25 - need to add my public key
13:29 - uh to a file in the root directory for
13:32 - that user so good thing I didn't disable
13:35 - the root yet which we will do but
13:38 - because I need to get back in there so
13:42 - what I'm going to do
13:44 - is as the root
13:47 - user I'm going to
13:50 - switch to Jesse so i' I've actually went
13:54 - from
13:54 - roote and now I'm it's as if I am this
13:59 - user uh briefly I'll I'll be this
14:02 - user now I'm automatically in the home
14:05 - directory for this
14:08 - user so we can see the directory we're
14:10 - in so home
14:13 - Jesse and we're going to make a
14:16 - directory for our SSH
14:20 - key so we've just made this directory
14:24 - and now we're going to
14:26 - change the
14:31 - the Privileges for that directory that's
14:33 - what the uh what this command
14:36 - does and we'll change it back to put
14:40 - that kind of lock that down after we we
14:44 - first we first put that in okay so we
14:47 - use
14:49 - Nano so we're going to use
14:55 - Nano okay so if you're not familiar with
14:58 - Nano it's just an editor that you can
15:01 - use in a terminal uh Some people prefer
15:04 - Vim that's a little bit more complicated
15:07 - I'm not really good with it maybe one
15:10 - day I'll I'll take some more time to
15:11 - practice but Nano is
15:14 - the the simplest editor so if you're new
15:19 - uh use use Nano uh it's it's pretty easy
15:24 - okay so what I need to do now is to
15:26 - insert my public key
15:29 - so here's what I'm going to
15:32 - do I'm going to now I have to actually
15:36 - go to my public
15:41 - key should just take me a second find my
15:44 - public
15:57 - key actually let's
16:27 - see
16:30 - sorry for the delay I'm doing this on my
16:32 - other monitor just so that I don't
16:34 - accidentally show the world something
16:37 - that they shouldn't see in terms of
16:39 - passwords or anything like that uh so as
16:42 - soon as I get
16:44 - this I
16:46 - will switch back over and start running
16:49 - some commands
16:55 - again all
16:57 - right
17:55 - okay all right so what I've done done
17:58 - offscreen is I
18:00 - went through the command line
18:04 - uh I went to my SSH folder for my local
18:08 - user on my machine and I found the
18:12 - public key file and I just copied and
18:15 - pasted that public key into this folder
18:20 - here uh when you're done with with Nano
18:23 - the way you exit out is I just press
18:25 - controll X and it'll ask if I want to
18:28 - save I type why I hit enter it ask me
18:31 - what file name I want I obviously wanted
18:34 - to keep the same name so I hit enter
18:37 - so in case you haven't used Nano it's
18:39 - it's pretty
18:40 - easy
18:42 - now what we tried to do a minute ago
18:45 - should
18:49 - work all right I just glanced at the
18:51 - live chat I'm going to answer this
18:53 - question real quick because I think it's
18:55 - important uh someone says is this the
18:57 - work of a friend and developer
18:59 - technically no I I guess like you might
19:04 - consider this like devop stuff I mean
19:06 - correct me if that's not really the
19:07 - right term but uh what will happen is if
19:10 - you're a freelancer you'll probably have
19:12 - to do this
19:13 - stuff if you are working in a small team
19:16 - at a company somewhere you'll probably
19:18 - have to do this stuff uh if if there's
19:21 - no other person dedicated to this kind
19:23 - of thing you will have to do it at some
19:25 - point if you ever want your site to be
19:27 - you know live on a a real server
19:29 - somewhere you'll have to do some
19:31 - something like this so it's good to know
19:34 - not exactly uh front-end developer work
19:39 - but it's you know it's something that
19:42 - you probably should learn how to do
19:44 - because you you may need to do
19:47 - it all right so now let's attempt to do
19:51 - what we did
19:52 - before and that
19:54 - is let's exit
19:59 - and we need to exit twice remember
20:01 - because we went into the the user
20:04 - account with the name of Jesse from root
20:06 - so now we're back in route and we want
20:08 - to get all the way out to my local
20:10 - machine now I'm in my local
20:13 - machine
20:15 - and I'm going to
20:19 - type Jesse if you're wondering uh
20:24 - no oh no this is uh an epic fail guys
20:30 - ah I know exactly what I
20:33 - did I skipped to
20:37 - step sorry
20:40 - guys not a great day
20:42 - today I'm much better in the afternoons
20:45 - if you've watch my other streams they're
20:47 - usually in the
20:48 - afternoons uh all right so remember
20:52 - we we kind of relaxed the permissions on
20:55 - this
20:56 - file and we never restricted them I'm
20:59 - guessing that may have something to do
21:01 - with the reason why this isn't working
21:04 - so we're going to go back into that
21:09 - user
21:10 - and I'm going to check and make sure
21:13 - okay we do have that directory so that
21:15 - that's
21:19 - there okay we do have the authorized
21:21 - keys I'm just going to double check to
21:23 - make sure that the key is there that's
21:25 - why I'm going to move off the screen
21:29 - briefly not that anybody could probably
21:31 - use my public key if they because they
21:33 - won't have a private key but just in
21:35 - case there's some way I don't know about
21:37 - to do something bad with that key I'm
21:39 - I'm doing it off
21:46 - screen okay I'm checking this file at
21:49 - right now it I have the
21:56 - key Okay so all that seems it seems
22:00 - right and so now I'm just going
22:08 - to reset this back to what it should
22:13 - be and we're going to type
22:16 - exit
22:19 - okay and I'm actually going
22:26 - to copy
22:29 - this let's
22:31 - see I'm going to copy
22:34 - this and just try it over here so I
22:38 - don't have to log out again in case it
22:39 - doesn't work ah it's not working again
22:43 - anybody see anybody out
22:45 - there do you see what I'm
22:48 - missing uh this is the first time this
22:51 - has ever happened to me I've set up
22:52 - servers like this several times uh in
22:55 - the past uh six months or So and I've
22:59 - never had this
23:01 - happen so what we can do that I don't
23:04 - normally do is I can just continue on as
23:07 - the root user and do some of these
23:11 - things
23:14 - and I
23:16 - will try to figure out what is
23:20 - wrong later
23:22 - on I'm just I'm I'm double checking my
23:26 - um
23:32 - huh yeah
23:36 - just double checking the directions real
23:43 - quick
23:45 - yeah oh well I didn't miss anything not
23:48 - sure what's happening I suppose it's
23:51 - like some simple thing that I just I'm
23:54 - not seeing so what we'll do is we'll
23:58 - continue as the root user and go as far
24:00 - as we can as the root
24:03 - user and we're almost up to half an hour
24:06 - anyway so I'd hope to be farther along
24:09 - but this is a good example of how things
24:11 - really work
24:12 - sometimes sometimes you go to do
24:14 - something you've done before and it's
24:16 - always worked before and now it doesn't
24:18 - work and you can't figure it out so I'm
24:21 - sure anybody that's been a developer for
24:23 - any length of time has experienced
24:25 - something like this so so is it somebody
24:29 - asked if it's free to try digital
24:31 - ocean no but you can usually find some
24:34 - digital ocean credit so uh yeah all
24:38 - right so somebody mentioned the GitHub
24:40 - student pack gives free credits just
24:42 - search online for um a code to have get
24:46 - free free time on digital ocean you'll
24:50 - find it I think I found something that
24:52 - was like $25 free but usually you can at
24:55 - least find1 or $15 somewhere
24:58 - um I think I can give out a link that'll
25:01 - give you at least
25:02 - $10 but I mean if you want me to send
25:05 - you the link that's fine uh let me know
25:07 - but I think you can find an even better
25:09 - one uh like at least maybe 15 to 25 out
25:13 - there if you uh take the time to
25:16 - look okay so the last thing that we at
25:18 - least can do is I can show you how to
25:19 - disable
25:22 - passwords on your
25:26 - server normally you would do this you
25:28 - can do this as root user but normally
25:30 - after I set up the other user I never
25:33 - use root again and I disable root but
25:35 - obviously I can't do that right now
25:37 - since I can't get that other user
25:39 - working so what I've done let me uh I
25:42 - I've typed
25:44 - in or I've copied and pasted in uh Nano
25:49 - I've opened the
25:51 - sdore config
25:54 - file so that's what we're in this is the
25:58 - our configuration file for SSH login
26:02 - basically and we're going to find the
26:05 - line that talks about password
26:10 - authentication so let's see what is it
26:18 - at did I pass it up
26:25 - probably there we go
26:29 - okay password authentication oh it's
26:31 - actually defaulted to
26:33 - no probably because I H I don't know why
26:37 - it defaulted to no I've done it before
26:39 - and it's been defaulted to yes so we
26:40 - don't have to change that but there are
26:42 - a few other things that we want to
26:44 - change so since we want to do
26:46 - authentication just with the keys we
26:48 - need to
26:50 - check we'll just check these other
26:52 - things out they may already be
26:55 - set when I've sometimes when I've done
26:58 - this in the past these actually have
27:00 - been set to different values so maybe
27:03 - um maybe the defaults have
27:07 - changed so we want to check public key
27:10 - authentication and make
27:13 - sure that that is set to
27:18 - yes sorry I have the font so big it's I
27:21 - can't see the the whole file so I'm
27:23 - doing a lot of scrolling around
27:31 - let's make sure there we go okay public
27:35 - key authentication we need it set to yes
27:38 - and we want to set challenge response
27:40 - authentication to no or at least make
27:42 - sure that it's set to
27:54 - know
27:56 - okay
27:59 - there we go challenge response
28:00 - authentication no that's all we need
28:05 - so let's get out of this by pressing
28:07 - contrl X if you haven't made any changes
28:10 - in Nano when you hit control X it
28:12 - doesn't ask you to save the changes or
28:14 - anything you'll just it'll take you
28:16 - right
28:17 - out okay we didn't really change
28:19 - anything but if we had we would want to
28:21 - do this I'll show you the command in a
28:24 - second we want to reload the system if
28:26 - we had so we'll go ahead and do it just
28:28 - to show you uh and this is the
28:31 - command that you'll want to use okay and
28:34 - then any changes you had would take
28:35 - effect after you've you've done that
28:40 - so the next step if you're following
28:42 - along on the digital ocean uh
28:45 - instructions is actually to test the uh
28:47 - the login for your new
28:51 - user we've tested it several times it
28:54 - won't work so so we're just going to
28:57 - skip to the next step and I'll fix this
29:01 - later
29:05 - on
29:06 - and what we're going to do now is set up
29:09 - a basic
29:11 - firewall so first we can check to
29:18 - see what's going on right now with our
29:20 - firewalls so we have open SSH running or
29:24 - that's
29:25 - available um
29:29 - we want to allow
29:31 - this so we're going
29:35 - to type in ufw allow op SSH we obviously
29:39 - need this to work or we can't log
29:42 - in all right so we've allowed that the
29:45 - rules are updated now we need to enable
29:47 - our firewall
29:49 - so really simple ufw enable Okay so now
29:55 - our firewall command May disrupt
29:58 - existing connections yeah that's
30:00 - fine okay um it always says that but
30:04 - I've never actually had a connection
30:07 - disrupted now we want to check to make
30:09 - sure it's running so we can just type
30:11 - ufw
30:13 - status and it will show we do have our
30:16 - firewall running but we have our open
30:19 - SSH and the V6 for the
30:21 - IPv6 allowed okay so that that lets us
30:25 - log in later on not today but maybe
30:28 - tomorrow's tutorial uh we'll add to this
30:31 - list but for now this is all we need and
30:34 - that takes us to the end of the first
30:37 - guide we've set up
30:40 - Ubuntu next step is to set up engine X
30:43 - that's going to be our reverse proxy at
30:46 - some point and uh we'll go over that
30:49 - probably tomorrow because I don't want
30:51 - to keep going without having this user
30:54 - account uh working I need to figure out
30:56 - why that's not working working so now
30:59 - what I'm going to do is since the uh the
31:02 - half hour is up I'm going to take just
31:04 - maybe a few more minutes I'm going to
31:05 - check out the live chat and see if I can
31:08 - answer any of your questions somebody
31:10 - said now try logging in I guess we could
31:13 - yeah I mean it it couldn't hurt let's go
31:16 - back over here let's go to log in still
31:20 - denied I'm like I'm thinking I might
31:23 - have done something really dumb like put
31:26 - in a space somewhere in in either the
31:30 - the key file or when I added the user
31:34 - and that's what's messing me
31:36 - up because in terms of the steps we took
31:40 - if you were following along we we we hit
31:43 - all the steps the only thing we skipped
31:44 - was actually creating the key which we
31:46 - didn't need to do since we already had
31:48 - one created so um the only other thing I
31:52 - could think of is it's possible I
31:54 - accidentally copied the wrong key
31:57 - I don't want to go through that again uh
32:01 - that I don't think that would be a good
32:03 - use of of your time uh for watching this
32:06 - to just watch me try to copy thing
32:08 - something again so I'll do that after
32:10 - the
32:11 - video and for
32:13 - now let me try to answer some of your
32:17 - questions and also if anybody uh kind of
32:21 - shouted out where they're from I'll read
32:22 - that out too so we have somebody from
32:24 - the
32:26 - Philippines
32:34 - okay somebody asked for a page that
32:36 - should set up a react from scratch uh
32:39 - links in an overall page
32:43 - please yeah
32:45 - maybe I don't know if I've set
32:47 - everything up from scratch already in
32:48 - the live stream it could be possible to
32:51 - go back a few live streams and see
32:54 - that uh as I said I think in the
32:56 - beginning I I really do want to do some
33:00 - very uh focused short tutorials on each
33:04 - one of these steps that I kind of do in
33:05 - my live stream but we go through kind of
33:07 - quickly so those are coming probably not
33:11 - until sometime in
33:18 - June somebody recommended uh Tyler
33:22 - mcginness for his react courses says
33:25 - they're for beginners and they're free
33:27 - that's cool if I get a chance I might
33:29 - check that out too thank you for the the
33:44 - advice okay somebody said you created
33:46 - the user but not put in any key I I
33:48 - actually I put in the key but I put it
33:51 - in on my other
33:53 - monitor but I'm I'm going to put it in
33:57 - again just to make sure I did everything
33:59 - right and I I put in the right
34:02 - key after this video I may just start
34:05 - completely from the
34:14 - beginning someone said they're scared of
34:16 - using the commands still stuck in the
34:17 - old school
34:19 - FTP once you get used to the commands
34:22 - it's you get more comfortable with it
34:25 - especially when you know I first set up
34:27 - this server there's really nothing on it
34:29 - if I completely messed This Server up I
34:31 - would just shut down the droplet and
34:32 - start again and in fact if I can't
34:35 - figure out what I did to mess up this
34:37 - user account I probably will just shut
34:39 - down the droplet and start
34:41 - again um hopefully I don't have to do
34:44 - that but that's kind of the best time
34:46 - you know play with some of these
34:48 - commands on a fresh server or even on
34:50 - your local machine if you can and uh and
34:53 - just get used to him there you know
34:55 - don't don't try him out for the first
34:56 - time on a really important live project
34:59 - but uh once you get used to them they're
35:01 - nice and once again these aren't off the
35:03 - top of my head I'm following the
35:05 - instructions because I don't trust my
35:06 - memory uh for this you know for these
35:11 - type of things for the initial setup I
35:13 - won't I don't trust it to
35:18 - memory oh cool somebody from Phoenix
35:21 - Arizona says first time they got to
35:23 - watch the live stream they've been
35:24 - watching the replays so uh cool yeah
35:26 - maybe the different time worked out
35:28 - better for some
35:29 - people someone from Nepal is watching
35:34 - awesome someone says it's the first time
35:36 - they're watching a server setup well
35:38 - that's cool I wish it would have went a
35:39 - little bit
35:42 - better does the SSH key generated on the
35:45 - local machine work on the remote server
35:47 - well yeah that's so basically the way it
35:50 - works is you generate the key on your
35:52 - local machine on your local machine then
35:54 - get saved your private key and your
35:56 - public key what you want the uh the
36:00 - server to have is the public key so then
36:05 - that public key gets matched up with
36:07 - your private key but basically you never
36:09 - send your private key anywhere that only
36:11 - stays on your your local
36:14 - machine uh and then that's how the keys
36:16 - are matched up so you can see it's I
36:17 - mean it's a pretty secure setup Ian
36:19 - someone would would basically have to
36:22 - actually be on your machine to be able
36:24 - to uh to get in you know through that
36:29 - way okay somebody uh suggested using a
36:32 - virtual machine to play around with even
36:34 - if you break it you can reset it that is
36:35 - great advice yeah and then you don't
36:37 - even have to spend any money on a
36:39 - droplet or anything virtual machine you
36:41 - just set up for
36:51 - free what he
36:55 - said
36:59 - okay somebody uh mentioned I can't see
37:01 - your terminal too well but check that
37:03 - you copied the entire contents of your
37:05 - public key so uh that's what I'm kind of
37:08 - thinking that might be the the problem
37:10 - maybe I I didn't get everything copied
37:14 - uh maybe I was just trying to do it too
37:15 - quickly didn't get it all
37:18 - copied now that I think about that
37:21 - that's probably the most likely
37:24 - solution all right someone says I love
37:26 - the designing and developing rather than
37:28 - setup yeah uh setup it's something that
37:31 - you have to do if you don't have anybody
37:32 - else uh working on I actually had
37:34 - somebody else set up the other server
37:35 - that'll host the WordPress site so uh
37:38 - they set that up for me which is awesome
37:40 - uh I just kind of wanted to do this on
37:43 - camera instead of have uh somebody else
37:45 - do it so that you guys could see it in
37:48 - case you've never seen it before and
37:49 - then we'll get back to the designing and
37:51 - developing stuff after we we get this
37:53 - set
37:55 - up
37:59 - okay someone suggested the Ubuntu forums
38:02 - uh topic permission Deni public key
38:04 - error I'll check that out I'm going to
38:05 - try to copy the key over one more time
38:07 - if that doesn't work I'm definitely
38:08 - going to check that out on the
38:11 - forums uh someone says subscribe to me
38:14 - so monster minor MC says subscribe to me
38:17 - that's not an endorsement I'm just
38:18 - reading it out I don't really know what
38:19 - their channel is is about I guess
38:25 - Minecraft
38:27 - no okay someone asked we're not done
38:29 - with with next and react are we no we're
38:31 - definitely not done we've just gotten to
38:33 - the point where I need to set up the
38:35 - server where this will eventually be
38:38 - housed when it's live I need to set it
38:40 - up put something on there test it out uh
38:43 - get the domain pointed at least the test
38:45 - domain so uh because if we're going to
38:48 - launch this next Thursday I like to have
38:50 - all this set up well in advance in case
38:54 - well something like this happens and
38:57 - I I mess it up so I don't want to put
38:59 - that off until the last
39:04 - minute somebody else said check the
39:06 - pubkey file uh contents that's I'm
39:10 - pretty sure that is the problem
39:11 - someone's from neple someone from India
39:13 - Argentina Holland Brazil Poland Thailand
39:18 - another one from Brazil all right I love
39:20 - it that you guys are you know from all
39:22 - over the
39:23 - place from Jersey
39:27 - in the united the United Kingdom Channel
39:29 - Islands that's cool uh I'm in the United
39:31 - States and when someone says jersey in
39:33 - the United States I always think of the
39:34 - state New Jersey and uh forgetting that
39:38 - it's called New Jersey because there was
39:40 - an original jersey in the
39:45 - UK oh someone says the GitHub student
39:47 - pack was denied oh man yeah check how
39:52 - did I get it uh Microsoft has some sort
39:54 - of developer program that's that's free
39:58 - I got a pretty good code from that one
40:00 - so uh check that one
40:03 - out I forget what it's called for sure
40:05 - but if you type in something like
40:07 - Microsoft developer program if you type
40:09 - that into Google then uh I'm sure it'll
40:11 - come
40:15 - up someone rapael balini has put his
40:18 - email in here in case uh anybody wants
40:21 - him for a freelance job once again
40:23 - that's not an endorsement I've I've
40:25 - never seen his work before but he's put
40:27 - it on
40:29 - there someone asks if there's any way I
40:31 - can practice locally or free online yeah
40:33 - locally I mean you can practice some
40:35 - terminal commands locally on your
40:37 - machine in terms of server setup you you
40:40 - probably will need to run uh like a
40:43 - virtual server if you install Docker you
40:46 - can do some of this in
40:48 - Docker so um You probably you'll need
40:52 - some tutorials to to get used to Docker
40:54 - first but I would check check that out
40:58 - and then you know you can just do
41:01 - whatever you want on the server if you
41:02 - mess it up no big deal because it's just
41:04 - a virtual server anyway so we have
41:06 - someone from Saudi Arabia
41:11 - bellarus see someone mentions virtual
41:14 - box to do the virtual server
41:16 - so you can do server virtual machine so
41:19 - good uh all good
41:22 - suggestions someone says it's my first
41:24 - time watching live in your video channel
41:25 - awesome
41:27 - yeah maybe it's not such a bad thing
41:29 - that I had to do this at a different
41:30 - time of day and now some you know
41:31 - different people get to watch it live
41:33 - when maybe they couldn't otherwise what
41:36 - if my hard drive dies and I lose my SSH
41:38 - Keys why I be able to log in digital
41:40 - ocean does have a way to uh to log in
41:46 - so let me did
41:48 - I I wonder if I closed my my screen with
41:52 - digital ocean I think I did no I have it
41:55 - here I'll show you real quick um let me
42:00 - see I can't remember where it is there
42:04 - is some somewhere sorry guys I wanted to
42:06 - show you but now that I look I can't
42:08 - remember where it is because I've never
42:09 - had to use it there is somewhere on this
42:11 - admin panel for digital ocean there is a
42:13 - spot where you can reset the root
42:16 - password okay you got Brian seore said
42:19 - Brian seore is the guy that set up my
42:21 - WordPress server he's a colleague of
42:22 - mine here so he said you can reset your
42:25 - root password in digital ocean and you
42:28 - can actually Lo use a terminal right
42:30 - there in the browser from your digital
42:31 - ocean panel so you can still get in that
42:37 - way this somebody asked if this will be
42:39 - saved at the channel later it will about
42:41 - five minutes after I stop uh
42:43 - broadcasting it should be saved as a
42:45 - video so you can watch the whole thing
42:47 - or pause or you know whatever you need
42:49 - to if I went too
42:51 - fast someone cheeseburger says Jesse we
42:54 - have to cook
42:56 - so I'm not sure about that actually I I
42:59 - do really like to cook I post pictures
43:01 - of my food on Instagram from time to
43:04 - time so if you like to see pictures of
43:06 - food you can check out my Instagram but
43:10 - uh I don't think I'll be doing any
43:13 - cooking shows anytime soon so we have
43:15 - somebody from uh New York City oh also
43:18 - Brian seiso recommend c9.io so it's
43:21 - Cloud9 uh I forgot about that yeah that
43:24 - will give you like Cloud development
43:27 - environment where there's a server set
43:29 - up so you can test those commands as
43:31 - well Windows Linux subsystem is easy to
43:35 - set up all right so we we have a lot of
43:37 - great suggestions if you want to test
43:39 - out your skills with the command line in
43:42 - in a environment like a live
43:46 - server all right and I've got to the end
43:48 - of the uh live
43:51 - chat if you uh wanted to ask something
43:54 - you didn't get a chance to or you just
43:55 - didn't want to ask in front of everybody
43:57 - uh you can either direct message me on
43:59 - Twitter or if you don't care if
44:01 - everybody sees your question just put it
44:03 - in the comments below this video if you
44:06 - want to see how we got to this point
44:08 - check out my previous
44:10 - videos either on free code camp or on my
44:13 - own channel there's a link in the
44:15 - description I will see you tomorrow at
44:18 - the same time we did today so 11:30 a.m.
44:21 - eastern time thanks for watching uh have
44:25 - a great day
44:29 - he
