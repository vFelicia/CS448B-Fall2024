00:00 - What I want to talk about today is how you can
00:02 - Become a super programmer like myself how you can write code like a real hacker
00:08 - using this one simple trick
00:11 - So I'm gonna start with telling two stories
00:14 - There's basically two stories of how I became a software programmer
00:19 - One of them was really cool. And the other one is true
00:23 - They're both kind of true I'm not I'm not just coming up with this
00:26 - um
00:27 - So I was about 13. I horribly broke my leg in a sporting accident because I was a very sporty youth as you can tell
00:34 - and
00:35 - You know, I just I didn't have anything to do I was like, you know, it was summer
00:38 - Everybody else was just like chasing ball chasing tail, you know, whatever they were doing. I was at home
00:43 - I didn't have any friends, but I had this one friend and the friend was called IRC
00:46 - But problem was that on IRC
00:48 - I didn't have any friends because nobody liked me
00:49 - So I figured if I would start a channel then people would come and you know
00:53 - They would have friends
00:55 - But the way to have an IRC channel and many of you are too young to remember this is you need a boss
01:00 - To keep the channel when you're you know offline
01:02 - So I started to make a boss and I didn't really know what programming was but I heard that you make BOTS in this programming
01:07 - language called Perl
01:09 - So it's like I learned that and that was pretty chill
01:12 - And then I wanted to share that with everybody because nobody came to my channel
01:15 - But I figured if I share this bot that maybe then we people will come
01:18 - So I made a website for it because you know that wasn't github back in the day
01:21 - so I learned HTML and CSS and eventually JavaScript and that's like a really cool story, but
01:28 - Because you know involves all the things like open source and you know being hacker and you know, like I don't know
01:32 - I don't know SSH into Linux be pcs, you know, it's all kind of cool stuff but in actuality
01:38 - I didn't do anything with that. I you know my leg healed. I went back to school. I went to university. I studied comparative literature
01:45 - philosophy major, whoo and
01:49 - You know that there's one side effect of studying comparative literature is that you're constantly broke
01:54 - You have absolutely no money. You have absolutely no skills that you can use to make money
01:59 - So so so, you know, you have no basically ignore no survival
02:02 - So I was mooching off this girl
02:04 - Who I was living with at the time and she was like you got to get a job
02:07 - So I went you know, and I I got a job in an office. I wore like a suit
02:10 - I got like a cheapest suit that you could
02:12 - And I went the and they give me this massive Excel spreadsheet and they said this is your job like, okay
02:19 - and
02:20 - For like about a day I tried, you know working with the Excel spreadsheet, but then I was like alright
02:25 - well, that's probably a way to like automate myself out of this job and and
02:30 - so I did I I basically I I learned how to write VBA macros which is the only language that is worse than Perl is
02:37 - VBA
02:38 - but but basically that worked and what I learned from that experience is two things one that
02:45 - Automating your tooling is like a fucking fantastic
02:48 - you know ability and then
02:50 - What I also learned is this concept of macros
02:52 - So I want to talk to you today about Visual Studio code how many people here know Visual Studio code everybody more or less?
02:59 - It's kind of like if you use sublime text or atom. It's basically like a text editor or slash IDE, but it's made by Microsoft
03:07 - And what's cool about vs. Code is similar to atom is that you can actually write x tensions for it
03:11 - So you can basically write your own tools and I've written some tools that have made me a lot better programmer and I'm gonna demonstrate
03:16 - To you today by doing some live coding for approximately many minutes
03:23 - Yeah, that's gonna be like this it's not gonna go well I'm this is like my fourth beer
03:31 - Alright let's do this
03:33 - so the first thing that you need to do in order to
03:36 - Can you see this cool the first thing you need to do in order to create a visual studio?
03:41 - Plug-in you say yo code. This is not a joke
03:45 - Yeah, there's this tool called yeoman generator and you can install generators for it in this case
03:50 - It's the code vs code generator
03:52 - and now if you know
03:53 - This is where you kind of decided. You want to be a real hacker
03:55 - If I was the kind of hacker that had actually like gone do with a kind of pearl and SSH and whatever route I would
04:00 - Choose JavaScript, but I'm the Microsoft guy. So I chose subscript
04:04 - We can get a give this thing a name
04:08 - It's gonna call AVS code hacker macros
04:12 - And I'm just gonna say yes to everything I don't know what that is then we're gonna pray that NPM install works cool
04:22 - And then what's gonna open vs code, all right do we see this I'll be bigger maybe
04:29 - Yep
04:30 - cool
04:32 - So I'm just gonna like quickly show what's here. So we have a package.json
04:36 - This is like an a standard type script nord project. We have some activation events
04:40 - We have some commands that we can you know use to
04:45 - Kind of you know give you know, basically start our program and then we have this photo extension - yes
04:50 - I've treated a little bit I made this buffers and storage files that we're gonna like store some of these macros in but they're not
04:54 - Very important and we don't need to really look at them right now
04:58 - But essentially to start kind of doing this, I think what real hackers do is first thing we use multi cursors
05:03 - I don't know if you know this you can do a command D and you can multi cares
05:06 - of course your selection like this and then you can just delete it because real hackers don't use comments so we can
05:12 - Delete those
05:13 - Real hackers. Also don't log anything so we can delete those. So that's fine. Now we have basically the simplest possible vyas code
05:20 - like, you know
05:21 - like extension that you can have
05:23 - So what I'm going to do is I want to write an extension
05:25 - Live right now that enables you to record macros that you can use to act like sort of automate your workflows
05:30 - So I think the first thing we're going to do is we're gonna just look modify this
05:36 - Thing this default one, we're gonna make it a recorder. I'm gonna implement this in a minute. Don't worry
05:42 - And then we're gonna copy that and make that a play and then we need one more
05:45 - This is kind of boring plumbing. When we need to over overwrite the type command in the standard thing and then what you need to
05:53 - Put those in the subscriptions, so we're gonna cleaning up the thing. It's we're not actually going to clean up anything
05:57 - There's the activate method you're supposed to do something here, but we're not gonna go to real hackers don't actually free resources. So
06:03 - That's one thing
06:04 - Now the next thing we're gonna do is going to implement this recorder real quick. It's relatively simple
06:12 - All related to do is we're going to need to create basically like your storage class
06:17 - And then we're gonna create
06:22 - We're gonna need to put that in disposable we can I need to put some some handlers
06:29 - It's pretty simple
06:32 - Let me just see if we can tune this up a little bit
06:36 - Bad on all right
06:45 - It's so this bit is a bit tricky where we need to basically we need to kind of like register some of that
06:51 - So
06:52 - and if you can see that but it's like
06:55 - Yeah, it's like boring plumbing. I think this is the thing about typescript
06:58 - It's like, you know, you need to write this all this bullshit code that you normally like wouldn't have to
07:03 - Anyway, so that's the way that works
07:10 - Anyway, I ran out of beer I'm gonna need somebody to help me
07:15 - Any volunteers, can I have them? Oh, no. No no Richard you you misunderstood me. Come here
07:21 - All right, Richard, is this mic on? Yes. Yeah, can you tell me what is your name?
07:26 - All right, Richard, I'm gonna go get a beer if you finish this program for me
07:30 - So it's very simple just implement like a replay class and you know the things just whatever you do
07:35 - Do not press backspace or Harrow keys because that will fuck everything up
08:02 - So, uh, yeah that was that was that
08:06 - Basically what this thing does
08:09 - Has anybody see this website called hacker typer?
08:12 - Yeah, so this is hacker typer, but you record your own own hacker typer kind of thing
08:16 - So what I'm actually doing here right now is implementing this thing
08:19 - And then we can just go into the debug mode. We can start debugging we can open a new instance of Visual Studio code
08:27 - And then within here we can
08:29 - We can basically just say record macro and then now I can say hello reactivate
08:35 - Ten, except ah, no not ten. I'm just gonna do X instead and I can save that macro
08:43 - I'm gonna give a name react want to call it one reactivate. So it sorts
08:48 - and then hopefully I should be able to oh
08:53 - It doesn't sort
08:58 - Cool so now I should be able to just play what I just recorded including things like selections and multi cursors and you know whatnot
09:05 - So this thing is called
09:08 - vs code hacker typer
09:10 - It is in the in the visual studio code extension marketplace. It's absolutely free. I don't know why they call it marketplace
09:16 - I don't think you can make any money on this
09:19 - But you know Microsoft's I guess at anyway so so this is what I made thank you
09:33 - So I have a couple of real quick things
09:35 - So V escort hacker typer is there you can use it
09:38 - But you might you know when I good why would anybody make something like this?
09:42 - But also mostly importantly, why would you want to use this?
09:45 - And I think I don't remember what my slides are. Okay
09:48 - so
09:49 - Why did I make this one of them is?
09:50 - One of them is that I've always really wanted to be like the one of the people who can do live coding
09:55 - But I just can't I'm like like really slow typer and it makes such typing mistakes and I get very very nervous
10:00 - but at the same time I would like to you know have you know this tool that I can use to actually like
10:05 - Communicate really really complex ideas to people and sometimes the best way to communicate about code is to show the code
10:11 - But you can't just show the massive amounts of code and all those things that Claire showed
10:15 - You know the tools that we can have in presentation that ITER's and things are great
10:19 - But the best way to understand code is be able to jump around it, you know, like look at things explain explain them
10:24 - I believe here I might have I already broke this
10:28 - I can't show you but you can go you can kind of like go and and mix things up and you know
10:31 - Like highlight things and then just keep continue typing and it kind of kind of works
10:35 - The other thing is I wanted to explore like and truly this story about
10:40 - Excel wasn't like hokey
10:42 - Kitsch it's it's really like where I started really programming and now that you know, like we have you know
10:48 - These tools that are automatable in the programming languages that we all know or obvious code type script or JavaScript
10:54 - What are they kind of see? Like, how can we do this and V escort accessibility is really really great
10:59 - What I I'm not a big fan of typescript as a programming language
11:02 - I like if you have a language that has the word type in it
11:06 - It should probably do type checking but it doesn't actually work like there's so many it's horrible so many broken things in it
11:13 - that doesn't actually
11:14 - You know like correctly. It's validate, you know the types of your code, but that said
11:18 - You know this experience of learning how a BS code accessibility works couldn't have been easier
11:23 - I did not read any documentation. All I went is like, okay
11:26 - Well, let's see what this automated generator gives me and explore the you know, the API via the auto completions and all that. So
11:33 - I thought that was like a really really great experience
11:38 - Now I'm gonna leave you with this
11:42 - Really topical we are ever there's another quote from ray tracing our friends a formidable homemade victory
11:47 - So we are basically a software consultancy that you know, that's a lot of open source stuff
11:51 - So a victory that Richard mention is something that we made
11:54 - Spectacle that Claire used I something that we made and a bunch of other things as well
11:59 - And you know, we are hiring. So if you want to work, you know on this kind of like cool oppressor space
12:03 - please do talk to us and the most important thing about this is why did I really make this is
12:08 - Recently formidable started to pay people for any open source contributions. They do on their free time, which means I got paid for this shit
12:14 - Which is, you know, pretty incredible, so
12:17 - That's it. Thank you very much
