00:00 - hello world i want to go to the very
00:03 - basics i want to talk about login and
00:05 - monitoring using cloudwatch so i want to
00:08 - start from the very start asking the
00:11 - question what is cloudwatch cloudwatch
00:14 - is the monitoring service from aws it
00:16 - helps you to
00:18 - keep your logs track some metrics
00:20 - trigger some alarms it can also record
00:23 - all the different changes in your
00:25 - infrastructure so you can do things with
00:27 - it like trigger lambdas if you have too
00:31 - many instances running or
00:33 - things like that it does all kind of
00:35 - very interesting things so it's more
00:37 - than just a login tool so cloudwatch
00:39 - help you to bring the visibility from
00:41 - your infrastructure into one place but i
00:44 - think that's one of the biggest
00:45 - challenges in aws to see what is going
00:48 - on in all these different services and
00:50 - clowatch is that place where you can
00:53 - connect everything together we have been
00:55 - using cloud watts to check the logs from
00:57 - lambdas but you can also do other things
00:59 - with it like check different metrics
01:01 - in your
01:02 - dynamo or even check the logs from the
01:05 - api gateway if you enable all resources
01:08 - will push some kind of information to to
01:10 - cloud cloudwatch but specifically for
01:12 - lambda cloudwatch is a great thing
01:14 - because
01:16 - when you have these execution
01:18 - times that is very limited and ephemeral
01:21 - and you want to respond as fast as
01:22 - possible
01:24 - you want that your login is not
01:26 - consuming thing
01:28 - kind of your execution time and when
01:30 - you're working with lambda and
01:31 - cloudwatch
01:32 - lambda will be kind of streaming
01:34 - asynchronously the logs to cloudwatch
01:37 - and it doesn't consume any extra
01:39 - execution time in your function and it
01:41 - doesn't generate any performance issue
01:43 - as with other libraries
01:46 - external libraries from aws that might
01:48 - generate some problems so that's why
01:50 - usually it's a good practice to use your
01:52 - cloud watch for logging in lambda and
01:55 - then maybe use some external library to
01:59 - see these logs or filter these logs or
02:01 - something like that but
02:03 - but keep the cloud watch as the login
02:06 - place for your lambda so now i want to
02:09 - show you
02:10 - basics of cloudwatch let's go to
02:13 - try out the metrics the login and the
02:16 - dashboards
02:17 - and let's go to the console to get that
02:20 - done
02:21 - let's start by creating a new empty
02:23 - project this is going to be a very very
02:25 - very simple project so just follow the
02:28 - steps as always to create a simple
02:30 - project with
02:31 - aws node.js as the template we are going
02:36 - to get into atom
02:38 - and do some small modifications the code
02:41 - is available in github but this is very
02:43 - simple code so i just remove
02:46 - all these comments
02:48 - to make it simpler to read
02:50 - and then i will create a trigger for the
02:54 - hello function
02:55 - so we can trigger this easily what we
02:58 - are going to do here
03:00 - after we create a trigger
03:02 - is to do
03:04 - a console log
03:06 - because that's what we want to try i
03:08 - will just change the message to
03:09 - something and this console log will just
03:13 - write hello
03:14 - in the console hello was called so very
03:17 - simple message so we will deploy now and
03:20 - we will see what happens so we'll speed
03:22 - up the deployment
03:24 - and when we finish deployment i will
03:26 - just trigger this
03:28 - function with that url let's just
03:29 - trigger it from postman so and we can
03:32 - see the message so now we can go to
03:35 - lambda in our account in aws in the
03:38 - console and then if you go there and you
03:40 - look for the function that you just
03:42 - deploy
03:44 - cloudwatch dev hello you can go to
03:46 - monitoring
03:48 - and there you can see the different
03:50 - metrics for this function and to see the
03:53 - logs you can just go to
03:55 - logs this is one way to find the logs
03:57 - and there you can see the logs for this
04:00 - call and you can see hello was called
04:02 - another way is a little bit more
04:05 - straightforward but in a way not that
04:06 - easy sometimes to find is to go directly
04:08 - to cloud watch and then go to log and
04:11 - there
04:12 - look for the logs in the list of lambdas
04:15 - if you have few lambdas then it becomes
04:17 - very easy if you have a lot
04:19 - like me this becomes very painful so
04:21 - when you find your your lambda
04:24 - then you can get into the log group
04:26 - and then you can see exactly the same
04:29 - another way to do that to see the logs
04:31 - my favorite i will say is to see the
04:33 - logs from the serverless framework
04:37 - in your terminal so you just type sls
04:40 - logs minus f the name of the function
04:43 - and minus t to tail the log so this
04:46 - if you keep on calling it will keep on
04:48 - appearing if you don't put the minus t
04:50 - it will just print whatever is there
04:52 - another thing you can do with cloudwatch
04:54 - as i said is to create dashboards with
04:56 - metrics so i will just create a new
04:58 - dashboard i'll put the name testing
05:00 - cloudwatch you can put any name you want
05:04 - and there you have an empty
05:06 - dashboard and there you can add widgets
05:08 - so these dashboards you can display in a
05:09 - screen or you can have them open to see
05:12 - how your service is performing
05:14 - and when you add a new metric
05:17 - you can look for the different
05:20 - services
05:21 - so we will just look for lambda
05:23 - and then you can look by function name
05:26 - and there is all the functions there
05:28 - then i will just look for the serverless
05:30 - cloudwatch and you can search so it
05:32 - becomes
05:34 - easier if you put the name of the
05:35 - function it just shows that it filters
05:38 - out the rest
05:39 - and then if you see on the right you'll
05:41 - start seeing some dots appearing
05:44 - those are like the only time we invoke
05:46 - this function so
05:48 - there's only one but if this is called
05:50 - many times then you will see lines so
05:52 - you can define things like the order in
05:55 - which these metrics are shown you can
05:57 - also define the period that these
06:00 - metrics are showing so either one second
06:03 - of information or five minutes or one
06:05 - hour and depending on that you are going
06:07 - to see different things the period and
06:09 - the statistics will make you see
06:11 - different things so it's important that
06:13 - you tune
06:14 - your dashboard
06:15 - to something that you understand
06:18 - so if i put 30 seconds
06:20 - the average it will be the average in 30
06:22 - seconds but i want the sum
06:25 - in 30 seconds
06:27 - so it's a different value than the
06:28 - average this case is the same because i
06:30 - only call it once but if you have
06:32 - multiple for some metrics the average is
06:35 - good for others the sum is better and
06:37 - then you have some graph options you can
06:39 - put annotations you can
06:41 - define what kind of
06:43 - data you how you want to show the data
06:46 - and that's kind of the graph then you
06:49 - can add numbers those graphs that's
06:52 - something i like
06:53 - some things are
06:55 - easy to see as a number
06:58 - so let's just look again for the for the
07:01 - same function
07:02 - and then you can see
07:04 - if i change the period
07:06 - then the average just disappears
07:10 - there's not enough data so now we have
07:12 - it
07:13 - one minute
07:14 - and we don't have any data there so in
07:16 - order to get some data what i will do is
07:18 - i will trigger this function many times
07:21 - so we can see in one minute
07:24 - i don't know how many invocations we
07:26 - have this takes a while
07:28 - usually cloud watch is almost real time
07:31 - so you need sometimes to wait a little
07:32 - bit
07:33 - now if i refresh this graph you can see
07:35 - that there is some values and we can see
07:38 - that there is some invocation and also
07:40 - you can see now that we have called this
07:42 - a couple of times so if i change the
07:44 - period and i change the statistic you
07:47 - start seeing things differently so you
07:49 - have the amount of
07:51 - i don't know invocations
07:53 - in one minute there were four in one
07:56 - hour
07:58 - there's an eight
07:59 - so
08:00 - it's different
08:02 - different values so
08:05 - you can play a little bit with that but
08:07 - always be careful on what is your period
08:09 - and what is your metric because
08:10 - sometimes those numbers can be deceiving
08:13 - if you don't know
08:14 - what you're putting there so
08:16 - another thing you can do is you can
08:18 - change the
08:20 - period that you're showing the data
08:22 - so even if the metric is being displayed
08:25 - for every 30 seconds you can also show
08:27 - what is happening in the last hour in
08:29 - the last three hours in the last day or
08:32 - then you can show what happened in the
08:33 - last minute
08:34 - or in the last 15 minutes
08:36 - and things like that remember that you
08:38 - need some data
08:40 - this was the video for today i hope you
08:42 - like it if you did give a big thumbs
