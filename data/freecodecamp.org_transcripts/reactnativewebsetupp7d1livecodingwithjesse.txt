00:08 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:10 - with jesse uh it's good to be back it's
00:13 - been
00:14 - a long time
00:16 - so sorry i started a little bit later
00:18 - then scheduled uh i'm having some issues
00:22 - with um
00:25 - with the stream so
00:28 - let me know if you can hear me if you
00:30 - can see me
00:31 - um
00:33 - the it it may be bad uh so i had to
00:37 - force quit some applications
00:39 - uh right now i have very little running
00:42 - on my machine
00:44 - so
00:45 - today
00:50 - i'ma wait to hear back and see if you
00:51 - can hear me and see me before i go into
00:54 - this
00:55 - so let me know
01:01 - all right well nobody's saying there's
01:03 - something wrong usually
01:04 - that happens quickly if something is
01:06 - wrong so
01:10 - uh i guess i'll just start
01:12 - so
01:13 - really quick uh
01:15 - here's why i haven't been streaming
01:18 - um
01:19 - i got a new job
01:21 - and before my old job i could live
01:23 - stream while i was at work at my new job
01:25 - i can't also i have a longer commute for
01:28 - my new job so it's been tough to find a
01:31 - time
01:32 - where i can i can actually stream so the
01:35 - plan now is i think i could consistently
01:38 - stream around 8am eastern time
01:42 - on wednesdays and fridays so i'm gonna
01:45 - try to do that
01:47 - and i'd like to do a project with react
01:49 - native web that's what i'm working with
01:51 - for my my new job so
01:55 - i think it'll be better if i if i stick
01:57 - with that
01:59 - that way i'll know what's going on and
02:01 - the stream and the project at work uh
02:04 - can kind of like
02:06 - play off of each other
02:08 - so
02:13 - hey everybody there's a lot of people
02:15 - saying hi just say hello
02:17 - um
02:19 - so this stream is gonna be kind of like
02:21 - a short stream compared to some of my
02:22 - older ones so i'm going to keep it maybe
02:24 - like a half an hour
02:25 - [Music]
02:27 - maybe a little bit longer
02:29 - and
02:31 - for this stream i'm just going to set up
02:34 - a react native web project
02:38 - so really quickly react native so
02:41 - react is a javascript library
02:44 - that helps you to build progressive web
02:46 - apps
02:48 - react native
02:50 - is
02:51 - a javascript library
02:54 - that allows you to create
02:56 - mobile apps
02:58 - using react
03:00 - you can also create other things so
03:02 - essentially you have this base of of
03:05 - react that you can code
03:08 - and then it can be turned into other
03:10 - applications
03:12 - right that can run natively on different
03:14 - devices so not just android and ios
03:19 - or
03:19 - you know windows
03:21 - machine but also
03:24 - you could
03:26 - there there are other things so like a
03:27 - vr application right or
03:33 - in this case
03:34 - we're going to
03:36 - use react native
03:38 - and have it run as a website
03:41 - on the web it looks like my image is
03:44 - frozen
03:45 - so
03:48 - right now i guess as long as you can
03:50 - hear me i'm okay with that
03:53 - so
03:55 - why would we want to do this this sounds
03:57 - crazy why not just use react well the
04:00 - reason being you can write
04:02 - most of your code
04:04 - and
04:05 - and react native
04:07 - with
04:08 - some slight alterations depending on
04:10 - platform and run it on many platforms
04:13 - so we build for the web but at the same
04:16 - time
04:17 - we could very easily
04:20 - turn that into
04:21 - an ios app an android app
04:26 - and whatever else you know comes out
04:29 - that
04:30 - uh react native can
04:32 - kind of compile into i guess so
04:36 - that's why i'm using react native at
04:38 - work so that we could very easily be
04:40 - cross platform
04:43 - and that's why i want to use it with
04:44 - this project
04:46 - so let's get to some code
04:48 - and
04:50 - if my image is frozen
04:53 - well let's do this
04:57 - i'm gonna get rid of the video for now
05:05 - okay so
05:06 - that should help
05:09 - maybe a little bit with like frame rate
05:11 - and stuff or with
05:12 - the freezing
05:14 - um the video seems to be a little bit
05:17 - more resource intensive
05:20 - so first thing we're going to do
05:22 - i am on a mac so this may be slightly
05:24 - different on windows but i want to open
05:27 - visuals actually let's open
05:30 - first things first let's open a
05:34 - chrome
05:35 - window
05:44 - okay
05:45 - [Music]
05:47 - should be back now
05:51 - let me know uh how it is now
05:58 - it looks like
06:00 - on my end it looks like it's better
06:04 - so hopefully it is a bit better
06:06 - um
06:11 - let me know i'm gonna you know what it's
06:13 - not the internet connection
06:16 - for me it's um
06:19 - it's my machine
06:23 - so i just think that
06:25 - my macbook pro is a little bit old it
06:26 - doesn't have the the specs to handle
06:30 - streaming like this so
06:32 - i'll try to figure out something else
06:33 - this may be a great excuse for me to get
06:35 - a new computer
06:37 - uh so we'll we'll see
06:42 - okay
06:43 - so the resolution is probably lower now
06:46 - so i'm going to try to make the the font
06:49 - as large as i possibly can
06:53 - and
06:55 - let's try to
07:02 - huh
07:08 - all right
07:11 - yeah if if the um
07:15 - if the video is too bad
07:17 - then maybe check out the recording that
07:19 - should be available a little later
07:23 - hopefully it'll be better but anyway
07:25 - this is create react app
07:29 - you can check this out more on your own
07:31 - if you'd like
07:33 - but basically we're going to do
07:36 - npx create react app and then we'll just
07:38 - name the app
07:40 - so let me open up a terminal
07:44 - i use i term
07:55 - remind me later okay
07:57 - so
08:02 - i'll make this as big as i can
08:04 - so you can see it
08:06 - all right so this is just you know
08:08 - regular terminal
08:10 - um i've gone into my projects folder
08:14 - we're gonna do create react app and now
08:16 - let's name it and for now um let's say
08:20 - uh
08:21 - fcc
08:29 - um
08:30 - react actually let's do
08:35 - let's do it like this
08:38 - it's going to be a weird name but
08:41 - for
08:42 - react native uh especially when you're
08:45 - going to try to do this
08:47 - your naming restrictions
08:48 - oh you can't contain capital letters
08:50 - okay
08:51 - let's just call it um
09:02 - it's gonna be all together
09:04 - oops what am i doing
09:14 - so
09:15 - there's an issue when you try to
09:19 - use this with mobile
09:23 - that you can't have hyphens in your name
09:28 - so that's why i was doing it all
09:30 - together like that
09:32 - alright so this is going to do its thing
09:34 - and
09:35 - it's probably gonna take a little while
09:37 - since we're
09:39 - streaming at the same time so i'm gonna
09:41 - check out the live chat a little bit
09:47 - uh
09:52 - okay so it looks like the frame rate's
09:54 - still really bad
09:58 - and that's probably since i started
10:00 - doing this
10:04 - hmm
10:18 - okay
10:38 - [Music]
10:42 - it's
10:47 - yeah you know at this point
10:52 - if i put the settings any lower
10:54 - i'll be streaming at
10:57 - 480
10:58 - and
11:03 - that means the recording that will be
11:05 - available afterwards will still be at
11:07 - 480.
11:09 - so i really don't want that it's it's
11:11 - really hard to see the code
11:13 - so i may just have to try streaming from
11:15 - a different machine next time
11:22 - hopefully
11:25 - what i'm going to shoot for for this
11:26 - stream is
11:29 - let's just try to get this installed so
11:32 - i can at least show you the package json
11:34 - file and how we're going to set that up
11:39 - and also if anybody has any questions go
11:42 - ahead and put it in the live chat right
11:43 - now and at least i can answer some
11:45 - questions while we're waiting
11:48 - let's see
11:52 - i'm just going to scroll down through
11:54 - the chat a little bit to see if anybody
11:55 - had asked anything
12:12 - oh hey john hanson's here
12:15 - how's it going
12:30 - um
12:38 - okay
12:41 - all right giuliano says it's working at
12:44 - uh 360 dpi
12:46 - all right not ideal but
12:49 - that's working
12:50 - yeah sorry for the really bad quality of
12:53 - the stream
12:55 - this is way worse than it was the last
12:56 - time i tried to stream on this computer
12:58 - so
12:59 - i'm not sure what
13:01 - what changed
13:02 - uh but it seems like something has
13:04 - changed to make it even worse
13:07 - so next time i stream
13:10 - i am definitely going to change things
13:12 - up
13:14 - um kid brave it's definitely not you the
13:16 - video is freezing a lot it's it's
13:19 - entirely
13:20 - um my fault
13:23 - so
13:24 - wow this might take a little while
13:30 - hmm
13:36 - yeah
13:36 - and this is making this take forever
13:38 - okay
13:40 - so
13:44 - i'm probably not going to make you all
13:46 - suffer through that much more of this
13:51 - is it actually done now
13:54 - um
13:55 - so
13:56 - this stream will just basically be an
13:58 - introduction to the project then hey
14:00 - wonderful it did stop
14:03 - all right so now that we've
14:05 - created uh this project using create
14:08 - react app
14:09 - we're gonna actually go into the project
14:12 - so we're gonna cd fcc
14:14 - react native web now we're into the
14:16 - project and now we can go
14:18 - we can open that up in visual studio
14:20 - code which is my code editor
14:23 - of choice
14:27 - and
14:28 - basically we're going to do almost
14:29 - everything from there so we don't even
14:31 - need this terminal anymore so i'm going
14:33 - to go ahead and shut that down
14:41 - and
14:42 - hopefully
14:44 - visual studio code will actually load up
14:55 - so for those of you that join maybe a
14:57 - little bit later
14:59 - we're starting a brand new project
15:02 - this is going to be like a side project
15:04 - for me
15:05 - so
15:07 - not would i
15:11 - what i've done in the other streams
15:14 - is no longer responding
15:17 - let's just keep waiting a little bit
15:19 - longer
15:26 - so i can't stream my actual like work
15:29 - projects anymore my full-time job but
15:32 - i'm gonna do a side project and i'm
15:33 - gonna try to use the same technology
15:35 - that i am using in my project uh for my
15:38 - my normal job
15:44 - let's see
15:45 - okay so
15:48 - we're in here
15:50 - and
15:51 - this is our package json file you can
15:54 - see right away it's very basic
15:57 - but it has it definitely has what we
15:59 - need
16:02 - okay so what we need to add
16:05 - in addition to this
16:07 - is we need to add react um
16:10 - react native
16:11 - and react native web
16:14 - i have to double check here maybe we
16:16 - don't need react
16:20 - native yeah we may just need react
16:23 - native web
16:25 - i'm actually not going to try to load
16:26 - this package here seeing as it took
16:29 - forever
16:30 - uh to get this working before
16:32 - so we'll add in react native web
16:36 - and at that point we'll need to add in
16:39 - some things so
16:44 - we need to add this into
16:48 - is this do we need to add this in our
16:49 - config
16:50 - clues built-in support
16:53 - okay you know what we don't need to add
16:55 - this i had to use it on a
16:57 - a project at work but
17:02 - we should be all right
17:05 - basically react native web works by like
17:08 - aliasing
17:09 - um
17:11 - parts of react
17:13 - so you could see like if we were to do
17:15 - it manually
17:16 - we do it with webpack
17:18 - also babel
17:21 - but if we use create react app this
17:23 - should
17:24 - work
17:25 - right off the bat and basically allow us
17:27 - to write react native
17:30 - code with create react app which is very
17:33 - convenient
17:37 - alright so we would add that in and then
17:39 - in addition to our
17:41 - normal
17:43 - so basically
17:44 - instead of our normal react script start
17:49 - we would have a start for
17:52 - like react native web
17:58 - and that would bring up a react native
18:00 - code in a web browser
18:03 - and we'd be able to work on it like a
18:04 - normal react project
18:06 - at the same time we could also
18:09 - use react native
18:12 - to bring up the project
18:15 - um as an ios app or an android app like
18:19 - in a simulator or in a connected device
18:22 - so
18:23 - for now for the project
18:25 - we're just going to stick with the web
18:27 - version because
18:29 - it obviously my my machine can't even
18:32 - really handle this but when you try to
18:34 - open up a simulator like ios simulator
18:38 - it takes a lot of resources so even if i
18:40 - had a really good computer it would
18:42 - still probably mess up the stream so
18:44 - we're just going to stick with the web
18:46 - if you'd like
18:48 - to
18:49 - do it for as as an app
18:52 - we can go over that
18:53 - but i can't really stream that
18:56 - successfully unless i get a really
18:58 - awesome computer
19:00 - so
19:04 - i think i'm going to start wrapping
19:06 - things up i'm going to answer a few
19:07 - questions that i see here and then we're
19:09 - going to wrap things up for today
19:12 - i'll try to stream
19:15 - again
19:16 - at the very least i'll try to stream
19:18 - like wednesday morning
19:20 - with a better setup
19:23 - uh it's possible that i might be able to
19:25 - do some weekend streams too
19:27 - uh if you want to get notified about
19:29 - that subscribe to this channel free code
19:31 - camp channel turn on your notifications
19:33 - you can follow me on twitter infos below
19:36 - you can follow me on instagram i notify
19:38 - everyone on instagram and twitter when
19:39 - i'm about to stream
19:41 - um i have a lot of pre-recorded videos
19:43 - if you want to see those you can go to
19:45 - my youtube channel the links in the
19:46 - description to this video
19:50 - uh and
19:52 - i think we got a react question so john
19:54 - hanson says
19:56 - what's the best place to use a switch
19:58 - statement as a function
20:00 - inside render or in the return the
20:04 - switch will load different children
20:05 - components based on
20:08 - a state change
20:11 - okay that's interesting
20:18 - hmm
20:29 - if i were doing it
20:31 - i don't know that i've tried to use a
20:33 - switch statement inside the render or
20:35 - not but it seems like inside the render
20:37 - function would be better
20:40 - for those of you who aren't familiar
20:42 - with
20:43 - what we're talking about this might help
20:45 - to show
20:47 - something
20:49 - if it'll come up
20:51 - so like when we're talking about the
20:53 - the render function
20:58 - i'm sorry the return
21:01 - so
21:05 - if it allows it which i'm not sure if if
21:08 - it would allow it or not to put a switch
21:10 - statement in the return i've never tried
21:11 - it
21:12 - it would make sense
21:15 - to put it in the return
21:16 - and just have different things come up
21:19 - you usually i just use ternaries
21:21 - inside
21:23 - the return
21:25 - and
21:27 - that that usually works but it could get
21:29 - complicated if you had a lot of options
21:34 - um let's see
21:38 - yeah
21:39 - john if you end up trying that and it
21:41 - works let me know i'd really like to see
21:43 - that because i've never attempted it
21:44 - before
21:46 - what i have done before is used a
21:48 - ternary like out here
21:52 - and the ternary would
21:55 - change the state
21:56 - right then depending on the value of
21:59 - state it would render things in here so
22:02 - there would be something like
22:05 - for this component
22:07 - it would say something like i don't know
22:09 - route
22:11 - let's just call it route
22:13 - um
22:14 - we would say right this
22:17 - state
22:21 - this state route
22:22 - and then
22:24 - i would say like equals
22:27 - and let's just say
22:29 - home
22:30 - okay let's say we have a string of home
22:33 - and
22:35 - now we're going to say
22:39 - um
22:41 - and and then we'd put a component here
22:44 - and then what that would do is say okay
22:47 - if the route equals home we're going to
22:49 - render this home component and then
22:51 - you'd wrap each component in something
22:53 - like this
22:54 - but the value
22:55 - of this state route would be different
22:58 - for each one
22:59 - then you have your switch statement up
23:01 - here that changes state
23:03 - so
23:06 - that would essentially achieve the same
23:09 - thing
23:11 - you would add a bit more code
23:14 - um but then you wouldn't put a switch
23:16 - statement in the return
23:18 - which i know this works i'm not sure if
23:21 - a switch statement works
23:25 - that makes sense
23:28 - has anybody else tried to work with
23:29 - switch statements in um in the return
23:38 - all right uh neymar asks what's this for
23:41 - uh we're working with react native um
23:44 - it's just a live stream to show
23:46 - like what is the process is like to code
23:49 - without rehearsing
23:52 - and there's there's a lot of mistakes
23:53 - that happen and like we we just go
23:55 - through them together
23:58 - um
23:59 - we have a question about suggesting a
24:01 - good es6 through 8 course
24:05 - um
