00:01 - okay so J querer number three uh if you
00:03 - didn't catch one and two they're in the
00:05 - description we're just going to move on
00:07 - uh so where we left off is we copied and
00:10 - pasted this piece of code four times
00:12 - because we were listening to four
00:13 - different buttons and we wanted to
00:15 - interact with four different panels it's
00:17 - not bad there's nothing wrong with this
00:19 - but it's terrible in that this thing is
00:21 - going to be huge if we're a little bit
00:23 - smarter we can actually make one thing
00:26 - that listens to all the buttons and
00:28 - talks to all the CL the panels so let's
00:31 - do this I'm going to show you kind of a
00:33 - couple different ways that you can do
00:35 - this uh and before we get into that I
00:37 - need to show you um how we can Target by
00:42 - attribute let me show you real quick
00:44 - what I mean by that I'm going to add
00:46 - this button and if you guys know from
00:48 - HTML 5 if you go data Dash you can make
00:51 - your own attributes I can go data Dash
00:53 - panel equals panel one and so then what
00:58 - I can do is I can actually find with J
01:00 - Creer I'm going to go over here to my
01:03 - console and just do it real time I'm
01:06 - going to look
01:07 - for a button that has an attribute of
01:12 - data panel equals panel
01:19 - one there you go and it found my button
01:22 - it's that first button so you can see if
01:23 - I use these brackets I can enter any
01:26 - attribute I can actually do this if I
01:28 - want to do um um ID I can actually
01:31 - search for idid because ID is an
01:33 - attribute ID equals
01:36 - btn1 so there you go same thing it found
01:39 - the panel and I found the button that
01:40 - has an ID of btn1 so that's how we
01:43 - search by uh attribute so I'm going to
01:46 - do now is I'm going to actually add data
01:49 - panel and I'm going to add the panel ID
01:51 - I'll actually go panel ID how's that
01:54 - makes a little more sense and then I'm
01:55 - going to put the ID of the panel that it
01:57 - relates
01:58 - to panel equal panel one panel two panel
02:01 - three panel four all
02:03 - right so let's get rid of this copy
02:06 - paste we're going to be smarter A good
02:08 - rule of web development is Dr y do not
02:11 - repeat yourself well don't repeat
02:13 - yourself this before this was not very
02:16 - dry we need to do what's called dry it
02:18 - up we need to stop repeating ourselves
02:22 - and write this one piece of code that
02:23 - does all the things that the copy and
02:25 - pasting would have done so now instead
02:28 - of button one let's get rid of these IDs
02:31 - here and we're going to add classes
02:38 - instead panel button so now these are
02:41 - all going to be a panel button because
02:42 - you'll know you can only have one ID but
02:44 - we can have multiple classes so now
02:46 - instead of targeting by ID we're going
02:48 - to Target by panel button and now this
02:51 - one rule is going to listen to All panel
02:53 - buttons whenever you click so now if I
02:55 - click on panel button
02:57 - one or if I click on button any of the
02:59 - buttons it should be toggling panel one
03:02 - so progress not where we want to be yet
03:04 - but we're getting there so now what we
03:06 - want to do is we want to do something
03:08 - that's
03:09 - called let's get the ID panel
03:13 - ID panel ID equals and we don't know
03:17 - which button was clicked cuz it might
03:18 - have been button one it might have been
03:20 - button two might have been button three
03:21 - might have been button four so we
03:23 - actually want to do is this no PR no
03:26 - Quotes no double quotes just this and so
03:29 - what that means whenever you do jQuery
03:31 - this it's going to take whatever the
03:33 - action was on and we're going to start
03:34 - using that guy so I can go this dot
03:39 - ATR data panel ID so that's going to
03:43 - look for an attribute of data- panel ID
03:45 - that's going to give me what that is so
03:47 - now panel ID if I go alert panel
03:52 - ID what it'll do is it'll get the panel
03:54 - ID and then it will alert it to me here
03:56 - I'll show you panel one
04:00 - if I click here panel three so now we
04:03 - know what panel we want to do something
04:04 - with great we're almost there um so
04:07 - instead of alerting panel ID I want to
04:11 - do
04:12 - hash Plus panel ID because I didn't
04:16 - store the hash up there I guess I could
04:18 - have stored the hash up there if I
04:19 - wanted to but for the sake of the lesson
04:21 - I'll show you how to put two strings
04:23 - together so we're going to put the hash
04:26 - Plus panel ID which doesn't do addition
04:28 - it just kind of bumps them together so
04:31 - hash Plus panel ID
04:34 - toggle so now we're going to listen to
04:37 - any panel button and when you click on
04:39 - it it's going to grab the panel ID out
04:41 - of that button and it's going to then go
04:44 - find that panel and toggle it see if it
04:46 - works nice
04:49 - nice and we win we dried it up we added
04:53 - one more line to our code and we have a
04:56 - much much cleaner thing uh you another
04:59 - way you can dry stuff up is say whenever
05:02 - you click this you want to show it and
05:04 - you want to you know give it some new
05:09 - content so what I can do is um ver
05:14 - content
05:17 - equals my new awesome content so now I
05:21 - can not only toggle it but I can make
05:24 - sure
05:25 - that panel
05:28 - ID Plus
05:32 - panel
05:35 - body HTML is content no no Quotes no
05:40 - double quotes which means I'm looking
05:42 - for a variable if I did quotes like this
05:45 - it would change it to the actual text of
05:46 - Co n tent which is kind of what it
05:49 - already is I don't want that I want it
05:51 - to look for a variable called content
05:53 - that I made up here I made a variable
05:55 - called content and I said it's my
05:57 - awesome new content so now it should
05:58 - there you go they're automatically going
06:00 - to get my new awesome content great
06:04 - another thing uh you can do is you can
06:05 - do
06:07 - HTML empty quotes to just kind of clean
06:09 - it out so now when you click on it
06:11 - nothing at all so that's kind of a way
06:13 - that we would dry up jQuery and start to
06:16 - reuse things that's also how you find
06:18 - out more information about who has
06:20 - clicked that this thing this I could
06:23 - also go this ATR
06:25 - ID if I wanted to find out the ID of
06:28 - whoever was clicked on
06:33 - um and that's going to alert my
06:35 - ID whoops can't do that because there
06:38 - are no IDs
06:40 - anymore I got rid of the IDS didn't I
06:42 - yep well if the IDS were still printed
06:45 - on here you'd be able to do that so
06:47 - anyway that's how you dry up jQuery
