00:01 - in this video we are going to dive into
00:03 - using Lambda from AWS and we're going to
00:05 - use the serverless framework for it
00:07 - which is a great combination super
00:09 - simple to use and extremely powerful so
00:12 - if you're not familiar with Lambda it's
00:14 - this really cool new paradigm that
00:16 - provides functions as a service you
00:18 - don't manage servers you don't manage
00:20 - scaling servers instead you provide AWS
00:23 - with your functions and they schedule
00:26 - those across servers and you pay for the
00:28 - amount of time they run
00:30 - and you pay for the amount of requests
00:32 - they receive so let's go ahead and look
00:34 - over at their pricing basically with
00:36 - Lambda you get a million free requests
00:39 - per month and 400,000 gigabyte seconds
00:42 - of compute time per month so what that
00:45 - equates to is the more memory you want
00:47 - your function to have the less free
00:49 - seconds of running time per month you
00:51 - have so if you're doing node.js which
00:53 - we're going to do in this example then
00:56 - your server will not be running all the
00:58 - time you'll provide it a noj s function
01:00 - and that function will execute whenever
01:02 - it's triggered the trigger could be an
01:04 - HTTP request the trigger could also be
01:07 - something like hey an image arrived in
01:10 - an S3 AWS bucket let's go ahead run our
01:13 - node.js process and resize those images
01:15 - and then it's done we're not paying for
01:16 - it all the rest of the time it could
01:18 - also be a schedule job that runs every 2
01:20 - minutes or every day or something like
01:22 - that functions as a service is an
01:25 - extremely useful Paradigm that in a way
01:27 - that solves problems very easily that
01:30 - would otherwise take a lot more
01:31 - involvement to solve so here's a use
01:33 - case for how much you'd actually pay uh
01:36 - if you had a 512 megabyte memory
01:38 - function and it ran three million times
01:41 - a month and each time that's about 1
01:43 - second you're looking at $18 to handle
01:46 - those three million jobs so that's a
01:49 - really cool pricing structure uh it's it
01:52 - saves a lot of money in certain use
01:53 - cases and gives you a lot of flexibility
01:55 - so what I've done is I've signed up for
01:56 - a brand new AWS account and now all I
01:59 - need to to do is have nodejs installed
02:01 - on my machine and you can do npm install
02:04 - G for Global
02:07 - serverless so server list will be
02:09 - installed on my machine
02:11 - now there we have it and now I can go
02:14 - server list
02:16 - create and this will not work it's going
02:18 - to say Hey you have to give me a
02:19 - template are we doing AWS node.js python
02:22 - Java so in this case I'm going to do AWS
02:27 - nodejs DT for template and give it the
02:30 - template I'm going to use so there we
02:32 - have it we've now created a template
02:34 - let's go ahe and close this out don't
02:37 - save and so this is my function that I'm
02:40 - providing I'm going to leave this as is
02:41 - for now if you've done any kind of
02:43 - node.js anything this should look
02:45 - decently familiar basically whenever our
02:48 - trigger event happens it's going to run
02:51 - this function and we're going to have
02:52 - all the event information which would be
02:54 - hey was this an HTTP event if so what
02:57 - path what parameters what was the post
02:59 - data all that and then we can send back
03:02 - a response and then we also have this
03:04 - serverless yaml which configures the
03:05 - function so they give us a lot of
03:07 - commented out stuff you don't really
03:09 - need most of it all you have to do
03:11 - really is change your name so we'll call
03:13 - this Lambda
03:16 - test and then we're going to leave the
03:18 - provider as is no.
03:20 - JS and you can see all this other stuff
03:22 - you can configure its access privileges
03:25 - within AWS if you're used to AWS you
03:27 - know what that all means and you can
03:30 - give it custom environment variables if
03:32 - you want some including and excluding
03:35 - rules and then here's the stuff that's
03:37 - actually important your events so let's
03:39 - go ahead and uncomment some of
03:42 - these let's go ahead and snatch an HTTP
03:45 - event here that's the one we want to use
03:47 - we're going to have this thing fire on
03:49 - HTTP events you can see also it's very
03:51 - easy to have this thing run on a
03:53 - schedule every 10 minutes that's easy to
03:55 - read it could run on S3 bucket changes
03:58 - so whenever a file gets uploaded to an
04:00 - S3 bucket say an image let's go resize
04:03 - that image to all of the sizes that we
04:04 - need lots of great things you can do
04:06 - with that and that's it let's go ahead
04:08 - kill all the rest of this just make sure
04:10 - it's nice and clean and that's my
04:12 - configuration for my function can do a
04:15 - little bit of wh space clean up
04:17 - here and we're good to go now we're
04:19 - ready to deploy it all I have to do is
04:21 - get some credentials from AWS so I can
04:24 - actually deploy this so I'm going to go
04:26 - to my security
04:28 - credentials and you'll see I get get a
04:29 - warning that there are better places to
04:31 - do this by creating an i user with
04:33 - limited permissions but for now for this
04:36 - example I'm just going to do this uh
04:38 - this totally works uh these keys will
04:40 - just have access to my entire AWS
04:43 - account so in a lot of use cases for a
04:45 - lot of companies that's way too much
04:47 - access you want to create users with
04:49 - limited permissions uh so there we go
04:52 - I'm going to copy that access key and
04:54 - I'm going to go
04:57 - serverless config credentials
05:01 - and then I'm going to do provider
05:04 - AWS key there's my key and my secret
05:15 - key that's configured you can see they
05:17 - stored it in
05:19 - user. AWS credentials I can cap that
05:23 - file and there it is that's the file
05:24 - that it created for me so if you've
05:26 - already configured your AWS CLI this
05:29 - step has already been done for you I can
05:31 - either download that key file or close
05:33 - it and I'll never be able to see those
05:35 - keys again so now what I can do is I can
05:37 - simply go server list
05:42 - deploy okay there you have it that took
05:44 - right about 60 seconds and it created my
05:47 - service and gave me an https endpoint
05:50 - let's go click on it and there you have
05:53 - it there's my message my function ran
05:55 - and this is the response you can see
05:57 - over here in the Handler that my
05:59 - response is the message and then the
06:02 - entire event so here's the entire event
06:05 - I got the path I got the method the
06:07 - headers all that stuff everything it
06:09 - would take for me to actually act on
06:11 - this HTTP event so instantly within
06:14 - seconds I have a service up and running
06:17 - woohoo that's super great uh so now I
06:20 - can go ahead and make some changes let's
06:22 - just make this v1.0 I've got the service
06:27 - up and running now I can just run
06:29 - serverless deploy again okay there we go
06:32 - that took a lot less time this time
06:33 - around it took about 20 or 30 seconds
06:37 - now I can go ahead and refresh my
06:38 - endpoint and there we go my message is
06:41 - version
06:42 - 1.0 uh the other great thing about this
06:44 - is you can real time create as many
06:45 - stages as you want I can go stage uh
06:49 - production let's say what I've been
06:51 - working on now is considered the
06:53 - development stage well now I can create
06:55 - a production stage and this is going to
06:57 - send my code out to a production
06:59 - environment M it's the exact same thing
07:01 - but I'm going to get a different URL for
07:03 - it so while that's deploying let's come
07:04 - in here and let's add another function
07:07 - so we have our hello function let's go
07:09 - ahead and configure a different function
07:11 - here let's call this one image
07:14 - resize you can see that my path right
07:17 - here was Slash users SLC create let's
07:19 - just make it a regular slash now and
07:22 - then let's make this a SL image
07:27 - resize so now we have two two paths
07:30 - right now they're both pointing to
07:31 - Handler JS hello method which is the
07:34 - Handler JS hello method so let's go
07:37 - ahead and copy and paste
07:39 - this we'll call this image
07:43 - resize and let's say we're going to do
07:45 - something completely different we're
07:46 - going to post an image up here it's
07:48 - going to resize that image and the
07:50 - response will be the new image so we'll
07:52 - just pretend that this happened it we'll
07:53 - say resize your
07:56 - image resize your image so that's image
07:59 - res size Handler image
08:03 - resize and now we're good to go you can
08:06 - see my production deployment already
08:07 - happened and I have this new URL here so
08:11 - here's my production URL and my
08:14 - deployment my development URL so let's
08:16 - just go ahead and run another serverless
08:21 - deploy okay there we go that took a
08:23 - couple seconds again and you can see
08:25 - that we now have two different functions
08:28 - we've got our Dev function and our image
08:31 - resize function or we've got our home
08:33 - function and our image resize function
08:35 - so I can go here and I can go image
08:40 - resize and resized your image it called
08:42 - a completely different function that
08:44 - function could have been a completely
08:46 - different file uh or that could be a
08:48 - completely different serverless project
08:50 - alog together if that's how we wanted to
08:51 - configure it so if I go over to
08:54 - production you can see there is no root
08:57 - I can't go just slash that's going to
09:00 - say missing authentication token which
09:01 - means that does not exist so then I
09:04 - could deploy that to production as well
09:07 - and then I'd have both of those
09:08 - functions on production so I know I
09:11 - really flew through that but basically
09:13 - in a matter of a couple minutes I have
09:16 - created a Dev and a production
09:18 - environment this could totally be a rest
09:21 - API this could be a lot of other things
09:23 - let me go over here to Lambda now and
09:26 - show you that these functions have been
09:27 - created I now have three functions but
09:30 - I'm not paying for them at all because
09:32 - they're not executing I'm only going to
09:34 - pay for them as they execute and I'm
09:36 - only going to pay for the execution time
09:39 - so it's a really great Paradigm a really
09:41 - really cool Paradigm um and it's a lot
09:44 - of fun I'd encourage you to mess around
09:46 - with serverless in Lambda when you have
09:47 - some free time it's really going to
09:49 - stretch your imagination on exactly how
09:51 - your web apps can work so that's it for
09:53 - serverless and Lambda I hope you enjoy
09:55 - the video go ahead thumbs up subscribe
09:57 - you'll get notifications whenever I come
09:59 - out with great new videos and have
10:01 - yourselves a great day
