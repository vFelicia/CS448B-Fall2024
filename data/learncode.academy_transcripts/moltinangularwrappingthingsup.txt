00:00 - all right so a little while ago I kicked
00:03 - off this single page angular app that
00:05 - used Molton to build a storefront and so
00:08 - I kind of wrapped that together it's not
00:09 - beautiful but all the key components are
00:11 - working and so I kind of wanted to
00:12 - Showcase this to you real quick I also
00:15 - threw all the code up on GitHub it's not
00:18 - necessarily all gorgeous code because I
00:20 - did it really pretty quickly um but if
00:23 - you want to kind of get some ideas on
00:24 - how you could build an app I'll kind of
00:26 - show you some things that I ended up
00:28 - doing um over here in inventory they
00:30 - have this cool thing called collections
00:32 - so I made a collection I added some
00:35 - products to my collection called
00:36 - homepage features um and I think ideally
00:39 - what that does is then when you go to
00:41 - store uh these are kind of the featured
00:43 - items these all exist in other
00:44 - categories but you can add them also to
00:47 - this collection I think ideally I'd also
00:50 - C create a collection called homepage
00:53 - slider uh which would have you know big
00:55 - images for all the truly featured items
00:58 - up there um another thing I did is I
01:00 - added stripe checkout here under
01:02 - Advanced gateways I added stripe added
01:05 - my stripe.com account which is super
01:08 - easy to use all you have to do is add
01:09 - your API key which I just added my API
01:12 - test key um and then that's good to go
01:15 - so stripe is now kind of my default
01:17 - checkout
01:18 - system um and let's kind of show you the
01:20 - rest of the store here so I can go to
01:21 - this here killer iPad add it to my cart
01:25 - I've kind of got this Global cart icon
01:27 - here that keeps track of all the items
01:30 - that are in my cart let's go back to the
01:31 - store let's find some sale items uh this
01:34 - test product is sale item let's go add
01:37 - that yeah I think ideally I'd have a
01:39 - quantity thing here also a drop down for
01:41 - you know if there's sizes or colors but
01:44 - that's easy to add a little later we can
01:46 - go to our checkout um here's kind of my
01:49 - pretty janky little cart that I threw
01:50 - together but everything is functioning
01:52 - you know it' be nice to have some
01:54 - updating of quantities here and the
01:56 - ability to remove items let's go ahead
01:58 - and check out
02:00 - here's kind of our checkout I went ahead
02:02 - and actually just copied and pasted all
02:04 - the fields from Molton checkout um their
02:07 - angular template they had going on so
02:09 - that made it quick and easy I'll put a
02:11 - link to their angular template they have
02:13 - as well in the description I'm just
02:15 - going to go ahead send it all to one
02:16 - address do autofill here okay there you
02:19 - go I threw in some dummy information
02:21 - autofill grabbed a few things but you're
02:23 - not going to know where I live and
02:25 - you're not going to know my home phone
02:26 - so um there's my basic deal I added a
02:29 - few shipping methods or should I say I
02:31 - added one shipping method which is free
02:33 - shipping and then I can pay with my
02:35 - credit card um which is going to go
02:37 - through
02:39 - stripe um and then stripe for testing
02:42 - has all these kind of credit cards that
02:44 - you can use this one's always going to
02:47 - authorize um and then you can have some
02:49 - different ones you know some of these
02:51 - will automatically fail some of these
02:53 - will give you a fail where the address
02:54 - doesn't match yada yada yada so we're
02:57 - just going to do that and then any
02:59 - expiration date is going to pass with
03:01 - this credit card number
03:03 - so date and year so
03:06 - 12 2017 sure and
03:10 - 555 so let's go ahead and pay now if you
03:13 - look real quick at
03:15 - orders ah I've already paid for it dang
03:17 - it if you go to this before you pay
03:20 - you're going to see that you have an
03:21 - unpaid order um and then after the
03:23 - customer has paid uh then it's going to
03:26 - convert over to a paid order and that's
03:29 - kind of nice that way you can kind of
03:30 - keep you know keep contact with
03:32 - customers who start an order I don't
03:34 - know if you've ever gotten an email from
03:35 - a from a company where you start an
03:37 - order and then you kind of abandon the
03:39 - process you can get an email later that
03:41 - day or later that week that says hey did
03:43 - you forget about your order here so
03:45 - that's nice you kind of get the idea you
03:46 - get the ability to query by orders that
03:48 - have not been paid yet and there we go
03:51 - there's my paid order and I got this
03:54 - really completely pointless little thank
03:56 - you for your order page and I could send
03:58 - off an email at that point or do
04:00 - whatever I wanted to do but there's my
04:02 - kind of really quick storefront all in
04:03 - all it did not take very long to put
04:05 - together and once again the full source
04:08 - code is learn codeacademy Molton D
04:11 - angular I'll get you that link and I'll
04:13 - also get you a link to Molton angular
04:15 - app that they kind of threw together
04:17 - with coffee script they probably put a
04:18 - little bit more tender loving care into
04:20 - it than I did so check theirs out as
04:23 - well and have a great day and hope you
04:26 - enjoy using
04:27 - Molten
