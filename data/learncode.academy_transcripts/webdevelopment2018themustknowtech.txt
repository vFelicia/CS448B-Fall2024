00:00 - hey everybody this is my absolute
00:02 - favorite video of the year every year
00:04 - it's the video of uh where i really
00:06 - cover what does it take to be a great
00:08 - web developer this year i mean it covers
00:11 - the basics for people getting into web
00:13 - development what do you need to learn in
00:14 - in what order do you need to learn it
00:16 - and it also covers for people who are
00:18 - currently front end or back end
00:19 - engineers or devops engineers what do
00:21 - you need to learn this year to keep your
00:23 - skill set really current so i'm excited
00:26 - about it uh there's three things i want
00:27 - to cover real quick up front one the
00:29 - link to this mind map right here on
00:31 - koggle is in the description so that way
00:33 - everything that's blue is a link to a
00:35 - video that i have
00:36 - or a course that i have or uh some great
00:39 - information on the web
00:41 - so you'll want to click on that once you
00:43 - watch this when you're actually learning
00:44 - all these things because i have a lot of
00:46 - videos covered already as you can see
00:49 - also there's some links in the
00:51 - description to the different areas so
00:52 - you can jump straight to an area of your
00:54 - expertise if you're already say a
00:56 - front-end engineer and lastly all the
00:58 - opinions on here are my own absolutely
01:01 - none of them are bought and paid for i
01:03 - do not recommend anything on here
01:05 - because someone gives me money to do so
01:08 - that's very very important to mention i
01:10 - do have one link that's an affiliate
01:11 - link but it's on there i've been
01:13 - recommending them for a long time anyway
01:15 - and i'll tell you what that link is so
01:17 - let's begin um you want to become a web
01:20 - developer in 2018 what does this
01:22 - landscape look like
01:24 - well you're going to learn basic front
01:26 - end development and then you're going to
01:27 - become either a front-end engineer which
01:29 - is this road up here which i'll show you
01:31 - or you're going to become a back-end
01:33 - engineer and you can actually learn both
01:35 - and become what's called a full-stack
01:37 - engineer if i were to give you my
01:38 - recommendation i would say learn basic
01:41 - front end you have to do this anyway you
01:42 - need to start with learning basic front
01:44 - end
01:45 - then become a javascript slash front end
01:47 - engineer and then become a full stack
01:50 - javascript engineer and then learn other
01:53 - backend languages i'll go into more of
01:55 - that detail later on as we go along but
01:57 - that's my recommended path in 2018 for
01:59 - what's going to be the best for you the
02:01 - best for your job opportunities and all
02:03 - that so
02:05 - if you're learning today you want to
02:06 - become a web developer in 2018 this is
02:09 - what you need to do start off by
02:10 - clicking on this link and learning basic
02:12 - html it's really easy to learn you're
02:15 - going to learn html css and basic
02:19 - javascript so html is content for a web
02:23 - page every webpage you go to is made in
02:25 - html it's basic content
02:28 - without css which is style cascading
02:31 - style sheets which is what that stands
02:33 - for you're just going to be able to
02:34 - create ugly ugly ugly content so then as
02:37 - soon as you learn the real basics of
02:39 - html which you can get comfortable in in
02:41 - just a few hours
02:43 - then you're going to start learning css
02:44 - you want to start making that content
02:46 - look pretty and beautiful
02:48 - so you're going to start by learning the
02:49 - basics of css then you're going to learn
02:51 - how to do layouts you're going to use
02:53 - grid mostly grid and flexbox these days
02:57 - then you want to learn how to do
02:58 - responsive design responsive means that
03:00 - that same html
03:02 - will look different and display
03:03 - different on an iphone than it will on a
03:05 - big old desktop computer that's called
03:07 - responsive
03:08 - and then responsive images and css
03:11 - animation you honestly probably don't
03:13 - have to learn too much in css animation
03:15 - for the basics but that's kind of your
03:17 - basic css skill set and so again you
03:20 - learn basic html then learn css and the
03:23 - rest of html together as you go
03:26 - so once you have those down then you're
03:27 - going to start learning basic javascript
03:30 - now javascript is the function to a web
03:32 - page so say on twitter you go and add a
03:35 - new tweet it shows up in your timeline
03:37 - right away it just appears on the page
03:39 - that's javascript to doing all those
03:41 - smarts
03:42 - let's say you reply to a tweet and then
03:44 - it somehow
03:45 - goes and notifies everybody else's
03:47 - phones well javascript is telling that
03:48 - web page hey send out this new tweet
03:50 - that's the function
03:52 - javascript is also a programming
03:53 - language so this is where you start to
03:55 - learn basic programming
03:57 - and here's kind of the things you'll
03:59 - want to learn on here
04:01 - i won't go through really what they are
04:02 - you can learn them as you go
04:04 - jquery is on here you don't really need
04:06 - to learn jquery anymore
04:08 - but i put it on the list because the
04:11 - skill sets there are jobs for just this
04:14 - skill set here and they tend to know
04:16 - html css and oftentimes those companies
04:19 - will use jquery so
04:20 - it's a decent thing to familiarize
04:22 - yourself with while you're at this stage
04:24 - i call this
04:26 - the website developer stage you can
04:28 - create websites but you can't
04:30 - necessarily create web apps like you
04:32 - couldn't go create twitter
04:34 - but you do know how to create like a
04:35 - brochure site you know it has flat
04:38 - information maybe for a small business
04:40 - or restaurant or something so this is a
04:42 - skill set you can start getting work for
04:44 - you can start making money uh maybe even
04:46 - get a full-time job and then as you go
04:49 - down one of these two paths
04:50 - then you can really become a career web
04:53 - developer
04:54 - so that's basic front end that's what it
04:55 - takes to do basic front end in 2018 so
04:58 - then as you pick a path again i
04:59 - recommend this path first and then back
05:02 - end but as you pick a path you're going
05:03 - to want to learn this to-do list as you
05:05 - go you don't have to learn it all
05:07 - overnight um but you do want to learn
05:10 - them as you're going this is kind of
05:12 - just like a learning list for you so by
05:14 - the time you become a full front end
05:16 - engineer you'll kind of learn these
05:17 - things you want to learn how to use the
05:18 - terminal you don't have to master it but
05:20 - you do want to feel comfortable there if
05:22 - you're not comfortable in the terminal
05:24 - in the console you will start being held
05:26 - back as you go deeper so terminal
05:29 - something you want to lose you'll want
05:31 - to learn it's a little intimidating at
05:33 - first but you pick it up really quickly
05:36 - then you're going to want to learn basic
05:37 - ssh
05:38 - and then how to put files onto a web
05:41 - server with ssh then you're going to
05:42 - learn github github is how
05:45 - the world tends to store their code as a
05:48 - standard professional developers tend to
05:50 - use git and they tend to use github with
05:53 - git
05:54 - then you're going to learn how client
05:56 - which is like a web page and the servers
05:58 - talk to each other there's two videos i
06:00 - put on this link that are really really
06:03 - helpful for people getting into web
06:04 - development it's things that
06:06 - are very difficult to
06:08 - know what you don't know and that took
06:10 - me years to kind of pick up on that i've
06:12 - compiled into two pretty short videos
06:14 - that i really wish someone would have
06:16 - told me when i was starting out
06:18 - learn what a restful web service is
06:20 - that's kind of something that you'll
06:22 - need to learn as you become a front end
06:24 - or back end engineer
06:25 - how you can kind of talk client to
06:27 - server
06:28 - and then you want to learn domain name
06:30 - and dns basics um just a little bit more
06:33 - about what an a record is what a c name
06:35 - record is stuff like that
06:37 - um and then lastly i guess i failed to
06:40 - mention the first time you want to be
06:41 - able to publish your html css and basic
06:43 - javascript to a website that's really
06:45 - important
06:46 - i recommend hostgator for this i've been
06:48 - recommending them for a long time so i
06:50 - finally did get an affiliate coupon code
06:53 - with them so if you do click this link
06:55 - or use this code i may make a buck off
06:57 - of it so that is the one link on here
06:59 - that i will mention is an affiliate link
07:01 - so don't use it if you don't want to
07:03 - there's these drop 25 percent and drop
07:05 - 10 bucks codes but let's make a deal i
07:08 - think can give you somewhere around 30
07:09 - to 40 lots of the time so that is again
07:11 - that is my coupon code use it to your
07:13 - own peril
07:15 - and so you want to learn basically how
07:16 - to set up a website that's the easiest
07:18 - place to do it when you don't know what
07:20 - you're doing is hostgator they're also
07:21 - one of the cheapest out there and then
07:23 - you want to learn how to put your html
07:25 - css and javascript on that website so
07:28 - that's basic front end um once you've
07:30 - got that and you're becoming a front-end
07:33 - developer uh here's kind of the things
07:35 - you want to learn this looks
07:36 - intimidating this is not very
07:38 - intimidating in reality um just give me
07:41 - about one minute to explain why here so
07:44 - you basically want to learn
07:46 - four things when you're becoming a
07:48 - front-end developer also known as a
07:51 - front-end engineer or a web developer or
07:53 - a javascript engineer or a react
07:55 - developer or view developer those are
07:57 - kind of the job titles you'll be
07:58 - searching for when you know these things
08:00 - you're going to upgrade your css skills
08:02 - you're going to upgrade your javascript
08:04 - skills become a little bit more
08:06 - confident as a programmer
08:07 - you're going to learn some build tools
08:09 - and you're going to learn one or more
08:10 - javascript frameworks
08:12 - things like this you can learn in more
08:15 - or less a day and then master in a week
08:17 - same with a lot of things up here you
08:19 - can learn so many of these things on
08:21 - this list in a day at the most a week
08:24 - this is going to be where most of your
08:25 - learning is going to take place in
08:26 - learning one of these frameworks so it's
08:28 - really not that big of a deal
08:31 - so css tools and skills these have been
08:33 - around for years nothing's really
08:35 - changed here sas lesser stylus are the
08:38 - pre-compilers you want to use they just
08:40 - add extra functionality to css
08:43 - when it comes to a css framework
08:46 - if you know css grid you might not need
08:48 - a framework anymore
08:51 - being that you do need a framework
08:52 - bootstrap or materialize are kind of the
08:54 - two coolest ones these days i've not
08:56 - gotten a lot of chance with the brand
08:57 - new bootstrap before i need to learn
09:00 - that and do a video on that
09:02 - because it does it's based on css grid
09:04 - so it's kind of cool
09:06 - and then css organization is something
09:08 - that that's useful in a lot of arenas
09:11 - basically the methodologies for what you
09:13 - name classes and what you call your css
09:16 - things when you're
09:17 - developing them
09:18 - uh those are kind of the three popular
09:20 - css organization methodologies that you
09:22 - want to learn again super easy to learn
09:26 - and then you'll want to learn a
09:27 - front-end build tool you want to be able
09:29 - to take all your css and compile it up
09:31 - and build it up
09:33 - npm scripts are a great way to do that i
09:35 - cover those in my node.js course
09:37 - webpack is the number one tool to use
09:40 - there used to be grunt and gulp
09:43 - and webpack but honestly you just kind
09:45 - of want to learn webpack these days if
09:47 - you're going to learn one other one you
09:49 - could learn gulp but webpack is really
09:51 - just the one to know
09:52 - and then here's a really good document
09:54 - from i believe mozilla on front end
09:56 - performance and and how to learn the
09:58 - areas to make sure your front end
10:00 - website is performant and put together
10:02 - really smart um
10:04 - so then once you learn that uh let's go
10:06 - to javascript frameworks this is really
10:08 - the biggest thing you want to learn to
10:10 - become a front-end engineer front-end
10:12 - developer
10:13 - is you want to learn how to program well
10:16 - using a framework now the one to know in
10:18 - 2018 is react js if you're going to
10:21 - learn one learn react boom that is it
10:24 - react and vue are the two that i would
10:26 - tell you to learn in 2018 angular and
10:29 - ember are still out there with some jobs
10:30 - but not a lot of new applications are
10:33 - being built in angular and ember so i
10:35 - would say honestly don't even worry
10:37 - about those unless you have some spare
10:39 - time and you want to maybe familiarize
10:41 - yourself with angular because there's
10:43 - a decent bit of angular job still out
10:45 - there
10:46 - react and view are the two things to
10:48 - know
10:49 - and so if i was going to build a brand
10:50 - new web app today
10:52 - if it was small like a single module i'd
10:54 - do it in view
10:56 - just view just drop view on the page
10:58 - you'll have your module done it's going
10:59 - to be fast it's going to be easy view is
11:02 - really great
11:03 - and then as the app grows i'm going to
11:05 - use
11:06 - maybe view with view this right here
11:09 - view
11:10 - or next if it's going to be a larger
11:12 - view app but honestly
11:14 - personal opinion once it starts getting
11:15 - into larger apps i'm going to absolutely
11:18 - use react
11:19 - just because if nothing else the
11:21 - community solutions
11:23 - and help content available react is
11:26 - awesome react or vue can handle big apps
11:28 - really well but react is the one to pick
11:30 - these days um
11:32 - so what do you do with react um if i was
11:34 - doing react
11:36 - relay or apollo if you're gonna use
11:38 - graphql graphql is a really cool
11:41 - alternative to rest
11:43 - that's definitely something you want to
11:45 - familiarize yourself with these days
11:47 - apollo is probably my favorite i prefer
11:49 - apollo over relay
11:51 - and then next js or after js or if you
11:53 - want to do server side rendered apps
11:55 - those are really good to look into
11:57 - and then managing css and react
11:59 - glamorous emotion or styled components
12:01 - are kind of duking it out for who's the
12:03 - best honestly
12:05 - they're all going to get the job done
12:06 - well each has their advantages and
12:08 - disadvantages
12:10 - but anyway no no real preference there
12:12 - overall just kind of take a quick glance
12:14 - at all of them but that's how you're
12:15 - going to manage your css inside of react
12:18 - and then you also want to look into
12:20 - state management so this applies to
12:22 - multiple different frameworks
12:24 - so with react you don't want to keep all
12:26 - your data in the react application you
12:28 - want to keep all your data in mobx or
12:31 - redux
12:33 - and my preference would be use modbx for
12:35 - smaller applications and if they get
12:37 - bigger and complicated and start to to
12:39 - get a little shaky with how complex
12:42 - you're doing things with data use redux
12:45 - at that point but lots of people default
12:47 - to redux these days and you shouldn't
12:49 - you should default to mob x because it's
12:51 - way simpler
12:52 - you're going to get more work done in
12:54 - the day and you're going to enjoy your
12:55 - developer life more because there's a
12:56 - lot of ceremony to building applications
12:59 - with redux and if you don't need that to
13:02 - solve complexity
13:03 - code with mobx if you're in the react
13:05 - ecosystem you'll know what i mean
13:08 - flux is good to know because that's kind
13:09 - of where these two came from but you
13:11 - don't really need to use flux these days
13:14 - i mean rxjs and bacon.js are very fun
13:16 - for learning functional programming kind
13:18 - of up here and you can actually use a
13:21 - lot of those methodologies in your other
13:23 - apps as well
13:24 - and then you want to learn unit testing
13:26 - how do i test my react.js application
13:28 - how do i write tests
13:30 - that can run against that app jest is
13:32 - definitely the one to use these days
13:34 - mocha is also really really good and has
13:36 - been around for quite a while
13:38 - but just is the one i would definitely
13:39 - go to right off the bat so that's kind
13:42 - of your javascript framework ecosystem
13:44 - of 2018 not a lot has changed there's
13:47 - just maturity coming and vue is getting
13:49 - a lot more popular
13:51 - some other fun things you can learn nah
13:54 - really the only one that's required on
13:55 - here is es6 if you do not know es6
13:59 - you're going to start feeling pretty out
14:01 - of date in 2018 it's definitely
14:03 - something you need to know
14:05 - which is technically es 2015 es 2016 es
14:08 - 2017
14:10 - those are those the ones you want to
14:11 - know static type checkers are good to
14:13 - know but you don't have to know these
14:15 - they're really really easy to implement
14:17 - and functional programming javascript is
14:19 - definitely something you should kind of
14:20 - walk yourself through at some point as
14:22 - well you don't need to learn it right
14:23 - away so that's the front end skill set
14:26 - your javascript engineer javascript
14:28 - developer at this point um although if
14:31 - you see a job for javascript engineer
14:33 - lots of times that can mean back-end
14:35 - javascript as well so
14:37 - be aware of that all these other jobs
14:39 - are for sure you know this skill set
14:41 - that i laid out here
14:43 - so you've learned basic html you're
14:45 - front end developer front end engineer
14:47 - at this point i would say the next step
14:49 - you should do in your learning process
14:50 - is learn node.js so you're full stack
14:54 - javascript developer so you're going to
14:56 - go to back end now and you're going to
14:57 - start really learning how to build out
14:58 - the server side of those applications
15:01 - you've been building in javascript and
15:03 - absolutely if you're going to pick one
15:04 - back-end language these days pick nodejs
15:08 - it's one of the easiest and fastest to
15:09 - learn if you already know javascript
15:11 - it's going to feel really really natural
15:13 - node.js with express js is totally the
15:17 - thing to do these days
15:18 - you're not going to go wrong with it
15:20 - also i have an ojs course because i
15:22 - absolutely believe in it so much
15:24 - compiled a lot of great knowledge into
15:26 - uh not just node.js but what it means to
15:28 - be a back-end engineer so if you're new
15:30 - to back-end engineering um if you've
15:32 - been in this world for a while this
15:35 - node.js course is going to be really
15:36 - really good for you a lot of key
15:38 - software engineering concepts for the
15:40 - back end are in here
15:42 - the job titles that you're going to end
15:44 - up looking for in the back end
15:46 - maybe backend engineer back in developer
15:48 - they're the same thing full stack
15:50 - engineer full stack developer
15:52 - full stack usually means you know at
15:54 - least react or vue or angular or
15:56 - something
15:58 - uh and then it might just be called a
15:59 - software developer
16:01 - and but honestly most often it's going
16:03 - to be the language you know so you're
16:05 - you're looking for no js developer job
16:07 - node.js engineer job a ruby job or a net
16:10 - job
16:11 - uh they might also be called a platform
16:13 - engineer or a dba if you're just
16:16 - databases what i clicked on something
16:18 - what did that do okay
16:19 - but dbas are people who just love and
16:22 - live and breathe databases and i don't
16:24 - quite understand those people but
16:25 - they're very valuable so dba is
16:27 - something else that's out there so
16:29 - these are
16:30 - all kind of the popular languages and
16:32 - honestly there's many many more so many
16:34 - back-end languages so what i'd say is
16:39 - start with node.js
16:41 - don't learn these ones for now
16:44 - don't learn any of the other scripting
16:46 - languages if you know node.js instead
16:48 - learn a scripting language and then to
16:51 - expand your horizons learn maybe a
16:53 - functional language a high-performance
16:55 - language
16:56 - um
16:57 - notable others we'll get to that in a
16:59 - second so if i were if i were to say
17:01 - what language is plural should i learn
17:04 - node.js first from there i would do
17:06 - golang and then from there i would do
17:08 - closure if i'm just going to give you my
17:10 - opinion learn that first learn that
17:13 - second learn that third there's all
17:16 - sorts of great stuff out there that's
17:17 - that pays well that has lots of job
17:19 - opportunity but these are going to be
17:20 - the ones that i think are going to set
17:21 - you up for success the best in 2018. um
17:25 - java and csharp.net are on here because
17:27 - there's a lot of jobs for that but
17:30 - um these worlds are are interesting
17:32 - java's been around for a long time and i
17:34 - don't recommend people to learn these at
17:35 - n at least not early on
17:38 - because you might get bad practices you
17:40 - might get a bad way of doing things or
17:43 - you might get an amazing way of doing
17:44 - things they're just a really mixed bag
17:46 - in these two ecosystems so i say don't
17:49 - learn those right off um you can look at
17:51 - them later on and then you maybe have
17:53 - more opinion there's there's a lot of
17:55 - bad java out there and there's a lot of
17:57 - bad.net out there and then there's a lot
17:59 - of good as well so that's that's why i
18:01 - don't ever recommend those to people who
18:02 - are learning
18:04 - um one cool thing to learn is serverless
18:06 - and aws lambda
18:08 - that's a really really cool thing to
18:10 - learn these days it's very very useful
18:13 - to know i mean it's a lot of fun to look
18:15 - into serverless
18:16 - architectures
18:18 - so what you do i did it again i zoomed
18:20 - in or something so what you do when
18:22 - you're learning a new language is you're
18:24 - going to say i'm learning node.js
18:26 - you're going to learn basically these
18:29 - things with the language you're going to
18:30 - look up
18:31 - uh what do they use for package
18:33 - management
18:34 - what do they use for unit functional
18:35 - testing so and it's easy to find on
18:37 - google you know functional testing with
18:39 - javascript functional testing
18:42 - with golang unit testing with golang
18:45 - you know unit functional testing with
18:46 - closure you basically can google all of
18:48 - these things here you want to learn how
18:50 - do you build a restful api how do you
18:52 - build a graphql api what are some
18:54 - security best practices all these things
18:56 - these are the things you will want to
18:57 - learn for each language and honestly
19:01 - the most difficult thing when you're
19:02 - learning a new backend programming
19:03 - language is not so much the language
19:05 - itself it's oftentimes the ecosystem
19:08 - it's knowing what is considered standard
19:11 - uh so like what is the most popular
19:12 - node.js package for working with a mysql
19:16 - database uh what's the most popular one
19:18 - for working with another database you
19:19 - know how do node.js engineers tend to
19:21 - set up their projects these are things
19:23 - that just take a while
19:24 - of getting involved in the community to
19:26 - learn how that works so you tend to feel
19:28 - like a fish out of water for the first
19:29 - couple weeks learning a new back-end
19:31 - language
19:33 - but once you kind of learn the standard
19:34 - ways of of doing things it really you
19:37 - really start to feel at home quickly
19:40 - and then you also want to learn these
19:41 - databases you want to learn these
19:42 - databases how to connect to them and
19:44 - interact with them for each language you
19:46 - do
19:47 - you'll also want to know how to set them
19:49 - up so
19:50 - start up here learn my sequel that's
19:52 - totally the easiest and best way to
19:54 - start postgres is in many ways very very
19:57 - similar to mysql so if you know one you
20:00 - in many ways know the other
20:02 - so you want to learn relational
20:03 - databases and then you want to learn a
20:05 - nosql database that's kind of these two
20:07 - lines here
20:08 - redis you tend to use for caching and
20:10 - for you know keeping track of users
20:12 - sessions interacting with your
20:14 - application uh cassandra can also be
20:16 - used for that cassandra also finds its
20:18 - home on this line down here document
20:20 - databases
20:23 - search engine databases elasticsearch
20:25 - and solar are the most popular graph
20:28 - databases are a very cool kind of newer
20:30 - thing they've been around for a little
20:31 - while but they're getting more
20:33 - popular these days neo4j orient db
20:36 - there's there's several others but those
20:38 - are two very cool ones to look at
20:40 - um and then message brokers it's kind of
20:42 - a a different way that applications can
20:44 - communicate with each other aside from
20:46 - making either restful or graphql api
20:48 - requests
20:50 - they can communicate over messaging bus
20:52 - this is especially useful over really
20:54 - large and complex applications so
20:56 - rabbitmq 0mq and kafka are three very
20:59 - popular message brokers so if you know
21:01 - all those things in one or two languages
21:03 - i mean you're doing good if you know all
21:04 - these things in one language you're
21:06 - doing good
21:07 - that's kind of the back end developer
21:09 - skill set for 2018
21:12 - so if you're really confident as a
21:13 - back-end developer another area you can
21:14 - look into is devops which i've covered
21:16 - in the past as well this is kind of like
21:18 - back end developer 2.0 slash a really
21:22 - niche area of being a back-end developer
21:25 - where you're just really really good at
21:27 - deploying and helping teams deploy
21:30 - applications in a professional way
21:32 - so to be a devops engineer you need to
21:34 - know some infrastructure platforms aws
21:37 - is probably the best one to learn if
21:39 - you're just going to learn one learn aws
21:42 - it's going to put you in the most demand
21:43 - and it's going to pay the best
21:45 - azure google cloud really good
21:47 - digitalocean is great for simpler
21:48 - smaller infrastructures simpler smaller
21:51 - companies
21:52 - then you're going to want to learn how
21:53 - to do server management also called cm
21:56 - or configuration management the number
21:57 - one thing you've got to learn these days
21:58 - is docker
22:00 - and then ansible is a good thing to
22:01 - learn as well there's salt puppet and
22:02 - chef
22:03 - puppet and chef tend to be used on more
22:05 - enterprise level size of things
22:07 - but they're good to know but if you
22:09 - learn docker and ansible you've got a
22:10 - cool skill set
22:12 - as well
22:13 - and those are those are totally the ways
22:15 - to do it so docker's basically going to
22:16 - help you package up an application into
22:18 - a container that you can just put all
22:20 - over the place you can run that same
22:22 - container here or here or here or here
22:24 - or on 20 servers on one server docker is
22:27 - awesome you need to know docker honestly
22:29 - even if you're a back-end engineer you
22:31 - should know docker these days it's very
22:32 - very important
22:34 - um and then ci pipelines continuous
22:36 - integration continuous deployment
22:39 - making apps deploy as you merge code to
22:42 - github
22:43 - really cool solutions for that circle ci
22:45 - and code ship those are ones that are
22:46 - hosted you know you pay monthly and they
22:48 - take care of it all for you or you can
22:50 - install stuff on your own servers and
22:52 - infrastructure jenkins is probably the
22:54 - most popular but the oldest drone ci is
22:57 - a lot of fun but the least feature full
22:59 - it's docker native so it's it's really
23:01 - lightweight in the way it runs i like
23:03 - drone it's a lot of fun get lab is also
23:06 - a very cool solution that's that's very
23:09 - all-encompassing so your whole company
23:11 - either uses git lab or they don't tends
23:13 - to be how it works
23:15 - um and then when you learn docker uh
23:17 - docker's really settled in the last
23:19 - couple years so docker used to have all
23:21 - this change and traction and stuff going
23:23 - on and it's really settled into some
23:25 - stability here
23:26 - uh one i have a course with o'reilly on
23:28 - docker
23:30 - and then if you're
23:32 - building out something small scale you
23:33 - want to use docker swarm maybe docker
23:35 - cloud
23:36 - if you're building out something medium
23:38 - scale
23:39 - what would normally be what say 12
23:41 - servers if you weren't using docker
23:43 - ranchers a great easy solution for
23:46 - running kubernetes without having to
23:48 - worry about running kubernetes
23:51 - and then docker data center universal
23:52 - control plane are good if you're more
23:54 - enterprise level
23:56 - which is good and then if you're doing
23:57 - stuff big scale kubernetes or mesos are
24:00 - really the two things to use with
24:02 - kubernetes really being the one to use
24:05 - so if you learn docker with kubernetes
24:08 - that's that's a great skill set for
24:10 - devops these days lots of demand at all
24:13 - sorts of companies so huh there's deep
24:16 - breath
24:16 - that's what it takes to be a software
24:19 - engineer web developer these days
24:21 - obviously so much more always you could
24:23 - talk about this stuff for hours but
24:25 - that's what you want to know that you
24:27 - you learn these things you're going to
24:28 - be in demand you're going to get jobs
24:29 - and you're going to have a lot of fun
24:31 - working with fun high-tech
24:33 - solutions so hope you enjoyed this video
24:35 - leave a comment tell me what you
24:37 - any questions you have on any of the
24:39 - stuff that i covered and have yourselves
24:41 - a great day
