00:00 - hey everybody uh we have a super cool
00:02 - video for you today I have a guest here
00:04 - Travis neelsen with Dev tips and we're
00:06 - going to be talking about how to get
00:08 - started in web development from the
00:10 - perspective of somebody who's rocking it
00:12 - in in the industry uh Travis has a great
00:14 - YouTube channel that you have to check
00:16 - out called Deb tips uh it focuses on the
00:19 - whole world to web development uh Travis
00:21 - why don't you introduce yourself real
00:22 - quick and just tell us about your
00:23 - channel real fast oh great um thanks
00:27 - well first of all thanks for having me
00:28 - on on your Channel I'm a big fan of of
00:31 - learn code academy I've been watching it
00:33 - for a while so uh so thanks for that uh
00:36 - Dev tips is is something that I've been
00:39 - pouring my nights and weekends in into
00:41 - lately and it's a YouTube channel
00:43 - similar to yours um it may be a little
00:45 - bit more front Endy less javascrip uh so
00:50 - you know the first the first videos I
00:52 - made were like HTML 5 Basics like
00:55 - talking about the history of HTML 5
00:57 - where did it come from why do we need it
01:00 - and going all the way up now we're
01:01 - talking about a lot of like layout in
01:03 - CSS and we talk about SAS a lot but we
01:06 - also talk about a lot of um like The
01:09 - Human Side of of the industry right so I
01:12 - go to meetups and I interview people and
01:14 - I talk to them about you know what do
01:16 - they do to remain you know inspired or
01:19 - or uh you know I went to a Meetup uh at
01:24 - Yahoo the other day and I talked to Dan
01:26 - cedarholm who's the creator or the
01:28 - co-founder of dribble we talked about
01:30 - like like giving back to the the
01:32 - community and why to do that and stuff
01:34 - so so it it covers like a a wide
01:37 - spectrum of things it's mostly just like
01:40 - whatever I feel interested in at the at
01:42 - the moment um which is actually why we
01:46 - started talking you know I I'm I'm
01:48 - interested in what you were doing and I
01:49 - wanted to to share that with my audience
01:52 - and now you've invited me to come on
01:53 - your channel which is really cool yeah
01:56 - so just in case uh you point out a good
01:59 - thing we're doing a two-part video
02:01 - actually kind of covering two different
02:02 - sides of this we've got a video where
02:04 - he's interviewing me on his channel and
02:06 - uh we've got got some really questions
02:09 - uh pointed uh for Travis that you're
02:11 - going to want to hear the answers to if
02:12 - you're starting off the web development
02:14 - process uh and you're you're wanting to
02:16 - learn how to get into that World um
02:18 - we're really going to pick his brain
02:19 - here for this video um and so I guess
02:24 - you just want to get into it yeah yeah
02:26 - let's just get started okay sweet Okay
02:29 - so I guess my first question would be
02:31 - let's say I'm somebody that I'm I'm
02:33 - either just now starting off or I've
02:35 - been learning web development because
02:36 - I've already kind of I think this is the
02:38 - good industry for me what's the first
02:41 - thing you're going to do what's the
02:42 - first thing you're going to learn and
02:45 - why um like technically like what you
02:48 - should start learning or or like yeah
02:51 - like let's say how start learning oh
02:55 - good question uh let's let's go both I
02:58 - mean what would you start learning and
03:00 - and how would you start learning it yeah
03:03 - okay so so content wise or yeah the
03:05 - learning the content wise I mean I'm I'm
03:09 - I'm very very frontend um when it comes
03:12 - to like the work that I do
03:13 - professionally and the stuff that I
03:14 - teach so my inclination would be to to
03:16 - learn HTML in and out and learn CSS in
03:20 - and out and learn how how JavaScript can
03:23 - enhance these two components of of a of
03:26 - a standard web page I think like if
03:29 - you're going to learn uh the stuff that
03:31 - that you teach will is is very very um
03:34 - Cutting Edge in terms of like tooling
03:37 - and workflow and stuff and to even
03:40 - understand those things like like to
03:42 - even buy a ticket to the amusement park
03:45 - of Wills Channel you have to understand
03:48 - what HTML is and how CSS properties will
03:52 - affect those HTML elements so my uh
03:56 - inclination would be to you know to
03:58 - start there to start at the very BAS
04:00 - Basics well yeah and that's uh if if
04:02 - you're if you're kind of subscribing to
04:04 - this Channel and you're learning that
04:06 - process you're really going to benefit
04:08 - from watching the dev tips Channel just
04:10 - just to make sure I say it there's a
04:11 - reason we're doing this because you'll
04:13 - love it um so so say say you're learning
04:17 - HTML CSS is it better to stick to just
04:20 - HTML for a while and then go CSS is it
04:24 - better to to learn them all at the same
04:26 - time does it depend on your personality
04:29 - hard yeah that's a hard question for me
04:31 - to answer because when I learned HTML
04:33 - there was no CSS oh wow and so I don't
04:36 - have you know I don't have that
04:37 - experience I mean somebody coming into
04:40 - the industry right now is going to have
04:43 - a bigger book to read and what I mean by
04:45 - that is they have a lot more to learn
04:47 - initially than I did when I came to it
04:51 - it was like just this weird thing that I
04:53 - was doing in my you know in in my Mom's
04:56 - computer and you know I was learning
04:59 - what what is a paragraph tag and I had
05:00 - to figure that out and that was kind of
05:03 - it you know like I read I read a chapter
05:04 - in a book and I kind of understood the
05:06 - whole thing but like today there's so
05:09 - because you know like the like CSS is
05:13 - growing Leaps and Bounds every year
05:17 - right like if you learned CSS completely
05:20 - two years ago and then closed your eyes
05:22 - for two years and then looked at it
05:24 - again it would be a different Beast
05:25 - altogether right now yeah now do you see
05:28 - that as good or bad for a new person or
05:29 - or a mixed bag well I could see how it
05:33 - would be difficult I mean it it's
05:35 - raising the bar um for you know
05:40 - to sorry it's raising um the entry level
05:45 - right uh what am I what am I trying to
05:48 - say
05:48 - here yeah that barrier of Entry is is a
05:51 - little tougher than barrier entry that's
05:53 - the
05:54 - word yeah it's raising the barrier to
05:56 - entry right so it's harder to get
05:58 - started but I think that it's more
06:01 - exciting than it's ever been so the
06:04 - payoff is going to be a lot greater so
06:07 - when I first started I made this like
06:10 - you know these horrible things that are
06:12 - like the o blite on the internet and uh
06:16 - yeah they were just so pathetic and um
06:20 - you know and and but that but it wasn't
06:23 - because I sucked and it was because I
06:26 - sucked okay it was because I sucked but
06:29 - it was also because the internet sucked
06:32 - like you couldn't make awesome things
06:34 - back then but now you can right the
06:37 - internet is awesome now and it it'll
06:40 - it'll continue to scale and get even
06:42 - more and more awesome but the point is
06:44 - that like it's it's possible for
06:47 - somebody in their bedroom and you know
06:49 - to read a book or or read a few blogs or
06:52 - or watch a few videos on YouTube and
06:54 - learn some things that are incredible
06:56 - and that that would make me drool
07:00 - when I was first starting right yeah so
07:04 - I think it is harder but the payoff is
07:06 - greater gotcha so are there are there
07:09 - any resources out there where there's
07:10 - some guys that are are giving tips on
07:13 - what this kind of like more intermediate
07:15 - Advanced CSS looks like I because from
07:18 - this I mean from from the sound of
07:19 - things I mean just so you guys know
07:21 - Travis is definitely like super super
07:23 - awesome at CSS I I tend to specialize
07:26 - more in JavaScript um and so is there if
07:29 - if I'm if I'm learning CSS what
07:31 - resources are are like these are the
07:33 - right
07:34 - ones to be looking at okay so CSS is
07:39 - very Broad in in what it can do and what
07:41 - it's for um but there are some very
07:45 - fundamental principles to understand
07:48 - right and um uh I hope this is not too
07:52 - self you know pluggy but I I did make a
07:56 - um a a video series it's like I think
07:59 - it's nine or seven or nine videos about
08:02 - CSS Basics and and I'll give the link
08:05 - you to you will so you can put this in
08:06 - the show notes or the the comment or the
08:08 - whatever below the D below and um it's
08:13 - it's about like we're starting at the
08:15 - very beginning what is CSS how does it
08:18 - actually interact with
08:21 - HTML and what is a block level element
08:24 - what is an inline element and and
08:27 - talking about like these very basic
08:29 - Concepts and then building from there
08:30 - going all the way up to how do you how
08:32 - do you install SAS and use that oh I
08:35 - that's got to be great because even the
08:37 - videos that I cover on CSS I'm I'm I'm
08:40 - focusing on hey let's let's go zero to
08:42 - 60 like right now so you can feel like
08:44 - you're doing something but I do not
08:46 - cover the detail that's very important
08:48 - to know yeah these were some of the
08:52 - first things I did and I felt that I
08:53 - needed to like explain them in order to
08:56 - do awesome like not I mean not that
08:58 - they're not aw awesome I think I think
08:59 - fundamentals are really exciting
09:01 - personally um but I felt like I needed
09:04 - to go over them in order to go into more
09:07 - like applicable skills in the in the job
09:10 - market today but so so they're very
09:12 - useful for people just starting out
09:14 - other resources that are not of my own
09:16 - um goodness I mean the the the
09:20 - Mozilla uh the mdn right the Milla
09:23 - developer Network or what is it called
09:25 - the yeah mdn mdn I don't what it stands
09:28 - for
09:29 - it's I just don't know the address Yeah
09:32 - well yeah yeah so Mozilla whatever and
09:35 - find some stuff uh and then um I would
09:38 - also say stack Overflow is a great place
09:41 - to just ask questions and and they have
09:43 - like a a really searchable database of
09:45 - other people like you that have asked
09:48 - similar questions to you and what the
09:50 - answers have been so I mean this is
09:51 - stuff that even though I am considered a
09:54 - professional I've been working in the
09:55 - industry for years I'm still visiting
09:57 - these places I go to mdn and stack over
09:59 - overflow all the time all Every Day I'm
10:01 - on stack Overflow yeah yes yes and there
10:03 - there's also one website in particular
10:06 - that's a like a Blog that I would
10:08 - recommend to anybody hand time over time
10:11 - and I have recommended it on my channel
10:13 - is css-tricks
10:16 - docomo who is the one of the co-founders
10:19 - of codepen.io
10:20 - and uh I've been following Chris for
10:23 - years he's so good he's so good at
10:25 - teaching he's like so smart and he talks
10:28 - about the things that I am very
10:30 - interested in which is front-end
10:32 - development and he he's branched out
10:34 - quite a bit over the years so even
10:35 - though his URL is css-tricks talks about
10:39 - you know JavaScript HTML he talks about
10:41 - tooling he talks about serving stuff he
10:42 - talks a lot about WordPress if you guys
10:44 - are interested in that he talks about
10:45 - like all these types of things and then
10:47 - if you go to Chris's products uh
10:50 - codepen.io that's a great place to um
10:54 - you know just see examples of things and
10:56 - and see how like if you want to see what
10:59 - the
11:00 - the what the internet is thinking about
11:03 - itself that's where you should go you
11:05 - should go to codepen to see what the
11:07 - internet thinks about itself in terms of
11:10 - um New Tricks it can do and and fancy
11:12 - new clothes that it can wear right gota
11:15 - yeah and then there's GitHub so always
11:19 - look at GitHub because there you are I
11:21 - got a trick question for you it's
11:22 - something people ask me a lot and I
11:25 - don't really know that I know how to
11:26 - answer but you might is they say how
11:29 - long will it take me uh let's say two
11:32 - hours a day every night of the week five
11:34 - days a week um two hours a day to learn
11:37 - this stuff to where I could get my first
11:39 - job is there any kind of Benchmark have
11:41 - you seen people make that journey and do
11:43 - you have any kind of a guess it's okay
11:45 - if you don't I'm not super sure man I
11:49 - you know what just I'm kind of it's hard
11:53 - for me to like I I feel like I'm giving
11:55 - you bad questions or giving you bad
11:56 - answers like you you asked U you you
11:59 - know it should you learn it all at once
12:01 - and and you know I have a bad answer
12:02 - because I I came into it at a different
12:04 - time than it is right now right so in in
12:06 - in a similar way like I'm a professional
12:09 - designer I'm a product designer I'm I'm
12:11 - not even an
12:12 - engineer and I learned how to develop
12:16 - stuff because I wanted my designs to
12:18 - live and
12:20 - so my first clients and my
12:23 - first the first people who paid me to
12:25 - code I'd been coding a long time making
12:28 - and Publishing long before they were
12:30 - even paying me to do it and and now I
12:33 - design professionally and I code
12:35 - professionally I do both at my current
12:37 - job um so so but your question is how
12:41 - long would it take somebody if they
12:42 - studied two hours a night every night
12:44 - and until they're ready to get their
12:46 - first job I think that that's the wrong
12:51 - question I think it's not about how long
12:54 - will it take me I think it's about how
12:57 - willing am I to be uncomfortable right
13:01 - if you're good question that is that's
13:04 - it that that really is it yeah I think
13:07 - and I know this just from speaking with
13:08 - you for a while will that you you like
13:10 - to dive in head first and to be
13:13 - uncomfortable and that's when you I mean
13:15 - I'm speaking for you but this is what I
13:17 - gather that you that's kind of like how
13:19 - you learn and Thrive you learn to love
13:21 - it I mean that's kind of the joy of web
13:23 - development yes and I I can I can
13:26 - unequivocally say every every
13:29 - job
13:31 - every employment that I've had and I've
13:34 - been sitting in the meetings I'm looking
13:36 - around the tables and I think what am I
13:40 - doing
13:41 - here this is across the board right I I
13:46 - didn't I didn't go to school I taught
13:48 - myself and I sit at I sit at the table
13:52 - with M people with master's degrees
13:54 - double Masters that that have gone to
13:56 - Stanford and like like people that are
13:59 - like seriously legit doctors I've worked
14:01 - with like people with double phds and in
14:04 - computer human computer interactions and
14:06 - Science and and they they do all these
14:08 - really interesting you know stuff I have
14:11 - no idea what they're doing and they're
14:12 - asking me questions about you know
14:15 - design or or or simple CSS stuff that
14:18 - they leaped right over right so it's not
14:20 - about when are you ready technically
14:24 - it's about when are you ready
14:25 - emotionally to be afraid and to be
14:29 - uncomfortable and
14:31 - um to just when are you ready to do
14:35 - it that's a that's it man great answer
14:39 - to that question because when the
14:41 - pressure's on you got to know that that
14:43 - at the end of the day if you don't know
14:45 - what to do you're gonna go find out what
14:47 - to do you're gonna ask a question on
14:50 - stack Overflow Google for two hours
14:52 - you're gonna find the answer if you
14:53 - don't have it and that's yeah yes if you
14:57 - if you ask me a question that you can
15:00 - easily Google I'll be upset with you and
15:03 - and that that's just like why are you in
15:05 - web development that's just the nature
15:08 - of like I mean if you if you ask my if
15:10 - you ask that in the comments on my
15:11 - channel I'm actually presenting myself
15:13 - as a learning source so that's perfectly
15:15 - fine but professionally if you come over
15:16 - to my desk and ask me something that you
15:18 - can easily find out um it'll I'll I'll
15:22 - I'll won't say it to your face but I'll
15:23 - think a little less of you that's that's
15:25 - for sure um do you go go for a living as
15:28 - a veler I mean that's just what you do
15:30 - you do yes yes Google is your very best
15:32 - friend as a developer and and like and
15:35 - stress that you don't know the answer
15:37 - when somebody asks you is also your best
15:41 - friend so and and there are there are a
15:44 - few ways though to get ready for that
15:46 - okay um I would surround your surround
15:50 - myself with people who support you right
15:53 - for me it was was my family my wife she
15:57 - believed in in me at at a time when I
15:59 - didn't believe in myself and and um
16:02 - there there was a moment in my life when
16:04 - I when I transitioned from uh I I used
16:07 - to be a Salesman I sold electronic I I
16:10 - sold televisions right on a sales floor
16:12 - you would go into a place and I would be
16:14 - like hey let me tell you about some
16:16 - stuff and and and I would oh and design
16:18 - and I would love design and read about
16:19 - design and think about design all day
16:21 - but I would make money by doing
16:22 - something I didn't love at all and I it
16:25 - was because I was afraid and I didn't
16:27 - believe in myself and Meanwhile my my
16:30 - wife is is always saying hey you know
16:32 - take your time and and and be
16:33 - comfortable but I believe in you and and
16:35 - I think that like like that having
16:37 - somebody there to to support me while I
16:41 - did really scary
16:44 - things um was was was pretty
16:48 - instrumental in um in in making that
16:51 - transition another thing is not just
16:54 - surrounding yourself with people who
16:55 - support you emotionally uh but who
16:59 - who
17:01 - will support you technically and support
17:04 - you in your skills right so I'm talking
17:06 - about a mentor yeah so finding a mentor
17:10 - is really important to to have somebody
17:13 - who is uh generally interested in your
17:17 - well-being uh personally and that you
17:19 - can talk to and express you know your
17:22 - your frustrations or your excitements
17:24 - with u professionally and having this
17:27 - person to guide you along the way is is
17:30 - really important um I never had that
17:33 - kind of one existential person but in
17:36 - through through like making deep
17:39 - relationships with people that I've
17:40 - worked with or people that I've known
17:42 - that that's kind of come about in a
17:43 - roundabout way and and now uh and now uh
17:47 - leading to the third one that I would
17:49 - recommend in order to learn and grow in
17:51 - this industry is to um this is going to
17:55 - sound really pretentious and dumb but I
17:58 - would I would pack your bags and move I
18:01 - would go to somewhere that respects this
18:04 - industry no that's huge that actually
18:07 - really is
18:09 - huge um I now for me that was that was
18:12 - moving to Oakland California and then
18:15 - across the bay into San Francisco that
18:17 - was when things went from from you know
18:21 - Zer to 90 and it was incredible as soon
18:24 - as I could put San Francisco this is the
18:26 - weirdest thing and it's probably
18:31 - I'm sorry to say this but this is also
18:32 - true as soon as I put San Francisco on
18:35 - my
18:38 - resume job offers every day
18:41 - wow like it it's it's it's it's not even
18:45 - fair to people who are not here it's
18:48 - it's really not and um this is a this is
18:51 - a sad truth if you don't feel
18:54 - comfortable with picking up your your
18:56 - belongings and moving or if you're stuck
18:58 - some some some place that but but this
19:00 - San Francisco is not the only place of
19:02 - course right there are other places that
19:04 - respect what we do right and New York
19:06 - Atlanta Boston Houston Orlando strangely
19:12 - Orlando Orlando yeah yeah Chicago Austin
19:15 - Texas um uh there there and worldwide
19:19 - too right there's a lot of places Brazil
19:21 - is really popping off right now uh
19:23 - Mexico is pretty big um Singapore huge
19:27 - uh
19:28 - Philippines uh a Australia Germany is
19:32 - really big in Tech um Nethers a lot huge
19:36 - I'm sorry what's that Netherlands huge
19:39 - hug yes yes yes absolutely so there's a
19:41 - lot of places where they where this kind
19:43 - of they're coming into this
19:46 - understanding that the things that we do
19:48 - are are are valid and worthwhile and uh
19:54 - valuable right so if you can surround
19:57 - yourself in a culture
19:58 - that values what you do and what you're
20:01 - trying to do you're not only going to
20:03 - learn and grow faster but you're going
20:05 - to receive uh remuneration you're going
20:08 - to be paid well to do what you do and
20:10 - it's going to increase your confidence
20:11 - it's going to increase your desire to
20:13 - learn and grow and and you're going to
20:15 - get better projects to work on that are
20:17 - more visible and that's going to
20:19 - increase your status in the community so
20:21 - w great advice great advice that's huge
20:25 - yeah so before Before I Let You Go on
20:26 - this before we we say goodbye to Travis
20:29 - till whenever um any any last words of
20:32 - advice towards people that are starting
20:34 - on this journey I really want to go for
20:36 - it yeah okay yeah I do um now you may
20:41 - have heard some version of this advice
20:44 - before but it it's but it's so important
20:47 - to understand and so I just I'll just
20:51 - reiterate it you're not going to be as
20:54 - good as you want to be until you get all
20:57 - of the wrap out and what I mean by that
21:01 - is that you have to make and make and
21:04 - make and make until the thing that you
21:07 - finally make is good you're going to
21:08 - make so much junk it's going to just be
21:11 - ugly and not work right and be horrible
21:15 - that nobody wants and you're going to
21:16 - make that for a very long
21:18 - time until you finally make something
21:21 - good so don't be afraid to make crap
21:23 - then don't get
21:26 - discouraged right let's say you have an
21:29 - exact amount of crap that you have to
21:31 - Wade through before you get to the good
21:33 - stuff and everybody has the same amount
21:36 - of crap that they have to get
21:38 - through if you work two hours a night
21:41 - every night you're going to get through
21:42 - it pretty fast that's just truth if you
21:46 - work three hours a night you're going to
21:47 - get through it
21:50 - faster right and that that's really the
21:53 - the the kind of um the recommendation
21:55 - that I have work fast and work hard and
21:59 - just like realize when you're new and
22:02 - you're learning that the stuff that you
22:04 - make is worthless it's worthless to
22:06 - other people but it's not to you it's
22:08 - going to be the Stepping Stones to
22:10 - making great things that's good and um
22:13 - and then when you finally start making
22:14 - those great things all of the sudden
22:17 - people are going to really want you and
22:19 - really want you to make great things for
22:21 - them and they're going to pay you a lot
22:22 - of money to do it which is nice but the
22:24 - main point is that you'll be finally
22:25 - making those things that you wanted to
22:27 - make the whole time because right now
22:29 - you can see it you have this vision of
22:31 - what you want to be and what you want to
22:33 - do and and you know who you want to be
22:35 - like but you can't do it because you
22:37 - suck you work so hard and then you don't
22:40 - suck it's just time it's 10,000 hours
22:43 - that's just
22:44 - it that's awesome man man great advice
