00:00 - in this video we are going to take our
00:01 - web page layout that we've been building
00:03 - and we're going to turn it into multiple
00:05 - pages we're going to have a home page a
00:06 - locations page and a contact page also
00:09 - if you've missed any of the previous
00:11 - videos the link is in the description so
00:13 - the first thing we want to do is we want
00:14 - to go over to our tab page here and we
00:16 - have our index.html which is the correct
00:19 - name for your home page and then what we
00:21 - want to do is we want to save this copy
00:23 - it to multiple different pages so i'm
00:25 - going to do file save as which as you
00:27 - can see is command shift s
00:29 - let's save as contact
00:31 - dot html now we have a second page i can
00:34 - command shift s and say locations.html
00:38 - now i have my three pages now again the
00:40 - only name that really matters is
00:41 - index.html
00:43 - these can be whatever you want as long
00:44 - as you remember their name also
00:46 - important you need to remember if it's
00:49 - capital c for contact or lowercase c
00:52 - it's called case sensitive you have to
00:54 - know what all those names are exactly
00:56 - the letters that make up your file name
00:58 - a lot of people get hung up there so now
01:00 - let's go ahead and turn these pieces of
01:02 - text into links
01:04 - to make a link you do an a tag why it's
01:06 - not a link tag i have no idea it's
01:08 - always been an a tag and the word inside
01:11 - of that is going to be the text that
01:13 - gets shown as a link
01:14 - so then you add an attribute to the a
01:17 - tag uh called href which is hyperlink
01:20 - reference
01:21 - and then you pick which file you want
01:23 - that to go to which is index.html
01:26 - we just made a link to index.html whoops
01:28 - like looks like i got an extra little
01:30 - character there
01:32 - got it
01:33 - and so now you can see that it turns
01:35 - purple because i've been there before
01:36 - and i can click on it and it takes me
01:38 - home which is where i already am so
01:39 - that's not very useful let's change this
01:41 - to say home there we go
01:44 - so now let's go ahead and add an a tag
01:46 - for locations a
01:49 - and let's call locations
01:53 - and again this is where the file name
01:55 - comes in handy or it comes in important
01:57 - is you call this whatever file you want
01:59 - it to go to so
02:01 - locations.html so now my locations has
02:05 - turned into a link and i can click on it
02:07 - it says title because i haven't changed
02:08 - that
02:09 - and then i can hit the back arrow so i'm
02:11 - good i can go back and forth between my
02:12 - two pages now let's do the last one of
02:15 - contact
02:17 - contact.html and we'll paste it in there
02:20 - so now i have three links
02:22 - going to my three pages yep the contact
02:24 - one works as well so now i can just copy
02:27 - this code
02:28 - click here shift click there
02:31 - and hit command c to copy
02:33 - now i can go to contact and i can paste
02:35 - all this in here
02:38 - get my links and i can go to locations
02:40 - and do the same thing get my links while
02:43 - i'm at it
02:44 - locations
02:48 - contact
02:49 - now i can go to all my pages locations
02:51 - contacts home every single page knows
02:54 - how to link back to every single other
02:56 - page excellent so you actually have a
02:58 - couple options here for how you want to
03:00 - lay out your folder this works great for
03:02 - a couple pages but if you had a website
03:04 - with 150 pages you wouldn't want to see
03:07 - them all down here you'd want to create
03:08 - folders
03:09 - so let's create a folder here and call
03:11 - it pages
03:12 - now i have a folder called pages let's
03:14 - start moving stuff in there yes i want
03:16 - to move it locations
03:18 - do you want to move it sure i want to
03:19 - move it so now if i go to index.html
03:23 - let's go back to our home here
03:25 - and i click on locations it says hey i
03:27 - can't get locations.html that's because
03:29 - it doesn't exist
03:31 - this link is automatically going to look
03:33 - for the file in the same directory that
03:36 - my current page is so i'm in i'm on
03:38 - index.html which is right here and it's
03:41 - going to look for locations.html and not
03:43 - find it so we want to look in the pages
03:46 - directory so that's pretty simple we
03:47 - just tell it pages slash locations.html
03:52 - and there we go now this link will work
03:54 - again ta-da we can get back to locations
03:56 - and you notice if i'm in the locations
03:58 - page and click on home ah i can't get
04:01 - pages slash index.html
04:04 - because i'm on the locations page
04:06 - and i clicked for index.html and that
04:09 - doesn't exist in my folder so if you
04:11 - want to look up a folder level you have
04:13 - to do dot dot slash that means hey look
04:16 - in the folder above mine so if i'm in
04:18 - pages right here and i do dot slash then
04:21 - it's going to go up a level which is
04:23 - right here
04:24 - so that's kind of your way of looking
04:26 - navigating all the different folders you
04:28 - could have
04:29 - a folder inside of pages called pages
04:32 - artists
04:34 - and then artists that start with the
04:36 - letter w
04:37 - this is if you had just hundreds and
04:38 - hundreds of pages and it would
04:39 - automatically look in the pages folder
04:41 - and then for another folder in there
04:42 - called artists and then another folder
04:44 - in that folder called w and then a file
04:47 - called locations.html
04:48 - so you can do a lot of different things
04:50 - you can make this website as big as you
04:52 - want to make it and then also on
04:54 - locations.html
04:56 - i could look up a level so let's say i
04:58 - was in that w folder i could go up a
05:00 - level to
05:01 - artists and then up a level two pages
05:04 - and then up a level back to the
05:06 - beginning where my index.html will be if
05:09 - that makes sense
05:10 - so let's go ahead and do dot dot slash
05:13 - for index.html
05:15 - and now if i'm on locations i can go
05:17 - home
05:18 - whoops let's refresh i forgot to refresh
05:21 - there we go now i can go home and i get
05:23 - there so i'm at home
05:25 - go into pages
05:27 - locations.html
05:28 - and go to dot dot slash index.html and
05:32 - that all works so for just three pages
05:34 - eh i'm gonna leave it all here i'm to
05:37 - drag them all back here
05:38 - i'm going to get rid of the pages folder
05:40 - but that is very important that you know
05:42 - how to do that
05:43 - in code because it messes up a lot of
05:45 - new coders so i'm going to get rid of
05:47 - all my changes that i made here
05:51 - and locations.html does not need the dot
05:54 - dot anymore there we go so that's our
05:56 - website it's set up but we do have one
05:58 - small problem here is that every single
06:00 - page has a copy of all our css styles so
06:04 - if i change something here what am i on
06:06 - let's go to index and if i change this
06:08 - to be pink
06:10 - because everyone loves pink
06:14 - then i go to locations oh no locations
06:16 - is red now so there's a lot of styles
06:18 - you want to share across your whole
06:20 - website like how your navigation looks
06:22 - how your footer looks what the
06:24 - background color is for your page so
06:26 - we're going to want to get this into
06:27 - what's called an external style sheet
06:30 - to do an external style sheet you just
06:32 - i'm going to right click here and do new
06:34 - file and you can call it whatever you
06:36 - want
06:37 - styles.css
06:39 - you usually want to end it with css
06:41 - normal names that people use are styles
06:44 - or stylesheet or main.css those are kind
06:48 - of some of the names that people will
06:49 - use
06:50 - and let me go up here and grab all my
06:52 - css but i don't want that tag because
06:55 - this is not going to be an html page i
06:57 - just want the css styles
07:00 - and then i can get rid of that style tag
07:03 - so i'm going to go ahead and save that
07:04 - now we have no style at all i'm going to
07:06 - paste all of that into the styles.css
07:09 - now all i have to do is bring styles.css
07:13 - into all three of my pages i do that by
07:15 - going to the head
07:17 - into the head i go link
07:20 - i'm going to add a link tag
07:22 - i'm going to link and hit tab and look
07:24 - it automatically took care of some stuff
07:25 - for me rel equals style sheet that's
07:28 - very important and then the href is
07:30 - going to be styles.css
07:33 - and there you go you can see that we
07:35 - automatically have our styles pulled
07:37 - into our page so with this one tag we
07:40 - can add css styles to any page that we
07:43 - want i don't want to cut it i want to
07:45 - copy it let's copy it there
07:47 - let's go to contact.html
07:50 - get rid of all this style
07:52 - and paste in my link tag hit save and
07:55 - now contacts should have my pink styles
07:58 - excellent now let's also go to locations
08:04 - same thing
08:05 - style sheet style css now whichever page
08:08 - i go to has my styles what's great about
08:10 - this is now i can change that color from
08:13 - anything let's make it blue
08:15 - and now all my pages automatically have
08:17 - the blue styles that have caught so this
08:20 - is how you want to manage the styles on
08:22 - your web page you can also create
08:24 - multiple style sheets you can make one
08:26 - for the navigation one for the footer
08:28 - you can make a bunch of different css
08:30 - files and put the css in there and
08:33 - import all of them so you can have
08:35 - multiple links here you can have 10
08:37 - links if you want although in general
08:39 - you want to have fewer fewer is usually
08:41 - better so that's how you set up your
08:43 - website
08:44 - to scale to grow to a lot of pages with
08:47 - css
08:48 - in the next video we're going to look at
08:49 - how we target things because again we've
08:51 - got this problem where this div is going
08:53 - to automatically affect every single div
08:56 - on our whole website so we are going to
08:57 - want to look at css targeting next
08:59 - that's really going to set us up to
09:01 - build out the rest of our website easily
09:08 - you
