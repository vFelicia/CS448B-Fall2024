00:01 - in this video we're going to be learning
00:02 - Yen which I believe is one of the best
00:05 - and most awesome tools that's come to
00:07 - front-end development in a long time uh
00:10 - if you are learning HTML CSS JavaScript
00:13 - or if you're using those languages day
00:15 - in day out for your job you got to know
00:17 - what yman is uh and you need to know
00:19 - these tools you're going to be really
00:21 - happy uh to know how this all works so
00:23 - let's just get into it first thing
00:25 - you'll need is you'll need nodejs
00:26 - installed on your system if you don't
00:29 - have that installed go to nodejs.org and
00:32 - click the green button I'll leave it at
00:34 - that it installs on Mac Windows Linux
00:36 - just fine and then you're going to need
00:37 - to open up the dreaded terminal that a
00:39 - lot of people avoid because they think
00:40 - it's terrifying but I promise it's not
00:43 - so on Apple that's uh utilities terminal
00:47 - and on PC you just hit Apple or Windows
00:50 - run and then type CMD here's how you
00:52 - know if node is installed you go node DV
00:55 - and that'll give you your version 0.10.1
00:58 - two if that says node command not found
01:01 - or something like that node is not
01:02 - installed on your computer or if you're
01:04 - on Windows you might have to reboot
01:06 - after installing it so that's it nodes
01:08 - installed so now you have access to the
01:10 - npm command which is node package
01:12 - manager you're going to go npm
01:16 - install DG Yo which will globally
01:21 - install that's what the - G is for
01:23 - globally install Yen uh and it's very
01:27 - important to put that- G in there it's
01:28 - going to put it in the folder you're in
01:30 - and you won't be able to run it as a
01:31 - command so we did that and let's also
01:33 - install npm DG
01:38 - generator web app this is kind of like
01:40 - their
01:42 - default did I not npm install I didn't
01:46 - do
01:48 - install there we go so web app is kind
01:51 - of like their basic hey you're building
01:52 - a website this is kind of a one siiz
01:54 - fits-all website generator what yman
01:56 - does is they give you a set of
01:58 - generators and anyone can actually add
02:00 - their own
02:01 - generator uh to yman and you can
02:04 - automatically generate things so now
02:06 - wherever I go I can create a folder and
02:09 - I can have yman build me a whole web app
02:11 - so let's go CD space code that's where I
02:15 - keep all my
02:16 - code make directory test app there we go
02:21 - so now I'm in the code test app
02:23 - directory and I'm just going to hit
02:26 - yo yo okay so then it gives me a list of
02:29 - all the install generators as you can
02:30 - see I have quite a few installed because
02:32 - I've messed around with a lot of them
02:33 - I'm just going to Arrow key down to web
02:35 - app and hit
02:37 - enter and then what would you like to
02:39 - keep it easy I'm going to drop SAS off
02:41 - I'm going to drop I'm going to drop all
02:43 - these off but if you if you know how to
02:45 - use SAS definitely keep sass check
02:47 - bootstrap it'll put it all in there for
02:49 - you um but I'll just check them all off
02:51 - with a space bar for now and hit enter
02:53 - and there you go it's building me a web
02:58 - app
03:00 - and it's grabbing everything I need to
03:02 - build that web app um it's going to give
03:05 - you a lot of cool stuff there you go
03:07 - it's done gives a little shout out to
03:10 - everyone who made it Addie Osman
03:12 - especially killer guy awesome guy I
03:15 - don't know him personally but I'll
03:16 - pretend I do because he's amazing and
03:18 - now all you need to do is type grunt
03:21 - server and what that's going to do is
03:23 - it's going to start up a web server on
03:25 - your own computer using node.js and it's
03:28 - going to open your application which it
03:31 - did on my other window here so I'll pull
03:32 - it up here now we have test app and we
03:36 - are Lo we are looking at our computer
03:38 - which is this address right here is the
03:40 - web address for our machine um and there
03:43 - you go that's a website that it made for
03:45 - us so I'm going to go ahead now and pull
03:47 - that over
03:48 - here let me go ahead and add a folder so
03:53 - we can see what I just made Code test
03:56 - app there you go my test is something I
03:59 - was doing earli earlier let me get rid
04:00 - of that
04:01 - guy okay test app right here this is all
04:04 - the files it just made for us in the
04:05 - test app directory um and let's look at
04:09 - the app folder and go to index.html it
04:12 - already made us a website and included a
04:15 - lot of stuff if you've used HTML 5
04:17 - boilerplate then a lot of this stuff
04:19 - looks really familiar to you uh and it
04:22 - basically included HTML5
04:25 - boilerplate um and here's our web page
04:28 - and it did some cooler things things
04:29 - than that it included live reload so if
04:32 - you have the live reload extension on
04:34 - Chrome you'll see this guy right here
04:37 - and now any changes I make to the web
04:40 - page it'll refresh automatically I hit
04:42 - save and there we go it refreshed uh to
04:45 - get the live reload extension you just
04:47 - go to settings
04:49 - extensions and then get more extensions
04:51 - and you can see I got live reload here
04:53 - now and you just want to make sure that
04:55 - that is checked if it's if it's open in
04:57 - the middle then it will not be live
04:58 - reloading so now any changes I make on
05:01 - my web page or on my CSS or on my
05:04 - JavaScript it will be listening and
05:06 - automatically refresh my page so instead
05:09 - of alo alo I can go hello
05:11 - hello actually speak English there Mr
05:14 - Addie um and then let's go to Styles it
05:17 - also included some main CSS for us
05:19 - already let's see what this is this is
05:21 - the hero unit well every hero unit needs
05:24 - to be
05:25 - red of
05:27 - course and then
05:30 - oh
05:31 - color there you go color red you notice
05:33 - CSS just takes a little bit and there
05:35 - you go now everything's red any new
05:37 - rules I add here real time are just
05:40 - automatically going to update it is
05:42 - awesome for web development now let me
05:44 - show you let's go into a little bit more
05:46 - detail kind of what yman does is it
05:48 - gives you an easy way to just jump in
05:50 - and have your development workflow be
05:54 - faster and then as you work with yomen
05:57 - you can actually learn some top topnotch
06:00 - ideas and ways of doing things but you
06:03 - don't have to know them to start using
06:04 - yman you don't have to know what else
06:06 - going on right now you just have to know
06:08 - H it gave me this great website and it
06:10 - real time is going to refresh for me so
06:12 - let's go into a little bit more of what
06:13 - it's doing for you let's look at
06:15 - gruntfile.js you notice I did grunt
06:18 - server oh and by the way when you're on
06:21 - here just hit uh control C to cancel
06:24 - that at any point in time once again
06:26 - grunt
06:27 - server it's going to run your whole
06:29 - server it's going to open up your window
06:31 - see opens it for me nice um and then you
06:34 - cancel at any time what that's doing is
06:35 - it's booting up your web
06:37 - server and then it is waiting and it's
06:40 - listening it's running what's called
06:41 - grunt watch and it's going to be
06:43 - listening for any saves on any of your
06:45 - files and it's going to reload your web
06:47 - page as that's going on so here's kind
06:49 - of what's going on in grunt this will
06:50 - totally freak you out if you're not used
06:52 - to JavaScript it'll totally freaky out
06:55 - so just kind of sit in it for a little
06:57 - while so you can understand a couple
06:58 - lines it's not not it's not that bad but
07:01 - it's also not incredibly easy either if
07:04 - you don't know JavaScript uh it's
07:06 - running watch which watch just it
07:08 - watches some Java JS and it's listening
07:11 - to all these files basically anything in
07:13 - my yman app scripts folder that ends
07:16 - with JS it's listening to that and when
07:19 - it listens to that it's going to live
07:21 - reload um it's also going to listen to
07:25 - Styles so if I make any changes to my
07:28 - Styles file F Styles folders CSS files
07:32 - it's going to automatically
07:35 - reload um and that's pretty much it this
07:38 - is the connect thing this is what tells
07:39 - it to open up a server on Port
07:43 - 9000 um it's also going to do some unit
07:45 - testing for you if you guys are into
07:47 - unit testing which I hope you are then
07:48 - it created all that for you here if
07:50 - you're not into unit testing I'll leave
07:51 - it out of this tutorial but it built
07:53 - your whole unit test file for you there
07:55 - which is super nice um it's going to JS
07:58 - hint all your JavaScript
08:00 - and mocha is what it's going to be using
08:01 - for your actual some of your unit
08:04 - tests and let's look at another thing it
08:07 - did it gave you a bower Json so it
08:10 - automatically put jQuery on your page um
08:13 - here's kind of what bow is do I want to
08:16 - get into Bower
08:18 - yet I'll get into Bower a little bit
08:20 - later so uh let's look all the way down
08:23 - at the end of our grunt file and okay
08:26 - here we go register task so we've got a
08:28 - few
08:30 - grunt tasks here these are the things
08:31 - that you can actually do grunt
08:35 - server um oh and look it's been
08:37 - deprecated so now it tells you to use
08:38 - grunt serve okay grunt serve is the one
08:40 - we should be using now that's that's a
08:41 - new addition grunt serve with that that
08:44 - boots up the server and it watches and
08:47 - then grunt test this is if you want to
08:49 - write unit tests and run those then you
08:51 - run grunt test and then grunt build is
08:54 - what you do when you're ready to put
08:55 - your website onto the interwebs for the
08:58 - whole world to see uh and what that's
09:01 - going to do is that's going to actually
09:03 - build everything out uh it's going to
09:06 - compress all your CSS style sheets let's
09:09 - actually run that real quick what you
09:12 - can do is you can put all these files
09:14 - with fdp or whatever you're using
09:16 - straight up onto your website and call
09:18 - it a day uh but what you can also do is
09:21 - if you want to make use of a lot of
09:23 - great things going
09:25 - on you can just run
09:27 - grunt build
09:33 - and now it's going to start minifying
09:35 - your JavaScript it's going to Minify all
09:37 - your CSS and it's going to uh there we
09:41 - go and it's going to dump it all into
09:43 - the dist folder which stands for
09:45 - distribution and this is your actual
09:48 - website right here let's take a look at
09:50 - the difference look at this it's
09:51 - minified so there's way less code going
09:53 - on here it's going to load a lot faster
09:56 - another thing you'll notice your styles
09:57 - are minified it also so minified
10:00 - everything down all the way those are a
10:02 - lot smaller and your JavaScript got
10:05 - minified and all the vender all the
10:08 - jQuery and everything else you're using
10:09 - got minified as well so this is actually
10:12 - what you're going to put up on the
10:13 - Internet uh there's a lot of best
10:16 - practices that went into this that is
10:18 - really going to make your website a lot
10:20 - more performant uh so that's kind of a
10:22 - lot of the built-in things it gives you
10:24 - let's look into this index.html and find
10:26 - out what's going on with that let's say
10:29 - you want to add some more CSS files to
10:32 - your web page you don't just want to do
10:34 - main.css say you want to add you know
10:37 - something for the rest of your site let
10:39 - me say this as I don't know blog. CSS so
10:44 - then all you do is copy and paste this
10:46 - link and now we add blog.
10:49 - CSS and so now it's going to load both
10:51 - of these files into our web page and
10:53 - when we run grunt build it's going to
10:56 - concatenate both of those into one file
10:58 - and Minify them together we're still
11:00 - only going to see this one file that's
11:02 - really cool if you scroll down to the
11:04 - bottom of your page exact same thing
11:06 - happens with your JavaScript it puts all
11:09 - your javascripts in
11:11 - here um and it's basically pull in a
11:15 - bower file for you here's our scripts
11:18 - main JS so let's see our scripts main JS
11:22 - it's logging aloalo right now let's say
11:24 - we want to save this to blog. JS now
11:28 - it's going to console
11:30 - log blog
11:32 - blog um we want to get that on our page
11:35 - it works the exact same
11:37 - way scripts blog so now when we're in
11:40 - development mode it's going to load in
11:42 - all the files individually so we're
11:44 - going to see console errors uh but when
11:47 - it goes time to run the grunt build it's
11:49 - going to build out one minified scripts
11:52 - file and it's going to take care of that
11:54 - let me look let me show you real quick
11:56 - what's what this whole Bower thing is
11:58 - all about one of the the things that
12:00 - front end is finally caught up to is the
12:02 - concept of package management of if it's
12:05 - the exact same file that can be
12:06 - downloaded for all the computers all the
12:08 - people working on your project you
12:10 - should not have to put that file in your
12:13 - project you should be able to create a
12:15 - package file which is this bower.json
12:18 - and say it has a dependency of jQuery
12:22 - and then what then all you have to do is
12:24 - the person downloads your project from
12:26 - GitHub and they do Bower install which
12:29 - I'll do
12:30 - here and when we do Bower install it's
12:32 - going to go ahead and grab all your
12:34 - dependencies so here's kind of let's say
12:37 - we also wanted to add backbone.js to our
12:39 - file so we go Bower install
12:43 - backbone I think it's called backbone it
12:45 - might be called backbone.js yep there we
12:47 - go it's downloading
12:49 - backbone and you'll notice it's going to
12:52 - change this file here in a couple
12:57 - seconds
13:00 - in just a couple seconds oh I didn't hit
13:03 - save power install backbone DS and it
13:06 - will actually save it to your bow Json
13:11 - file capital
13:13 - S come on get it together will okay so
13:18 - uh Bower install backbone what that
13:21 - command did is you'll notice up here I
13:23 - have my Bower components folder and now
13:25 - I have jQuery and I have backbone and
13:28 - backbone
13:29 - requires underscore so it automatically
13:31 - grabbed that for me as well so those are
13:34 - now in here and when I hit- S it saved
13:38 - it to my bower.json file so I'll include
13:42 - this in my GitHub repository and now
13:45 - when anybody downloads it from GitHub
13:47 - they just go bow
13:49 - install and it's going to grab
13:50 - everything that I need it knows I have
13:52 - everything so let me actually go ahead
13:54 - and delete some stuff so when I I'm not
13:56 - going to include this B components in my
13:58 - my GitHub repository that's a whole lot
14:01 - of files that don't actually have to do
14:02 - with the code I'm writing I'm just using
14:05 - them for my web app so all I do is I
14:08 - include this in my file that says hey I
14:10 - need jQuery and backbone you get it you
14:12 - run bow
14:14 - install and it's now going to grab
14:16 - jQuery it's going to grab backbone and
14:19 - backbone is going to grab underscore
14:21 - there you go see all three are in there
14:23 - and then this references Bower
14:25 - components jQuery jquery.js so if I also
14:29 - want to make sure underscore gets added
14:31 - then I just copy and paste these and
14:32 - they'll end up in my build as
14:34 - well let's go
14:38 - underscore and what is that
14:41 - underscore underscore.js
14:44 - and then backbone is backbone
14:48 - backbone.js
14:50 - there you go so now I've got all three
14:53 - files and they're all coming into my web
14:55 - page and if I now run grunt
15:01 - build this is where the true magic takes
15:03 - place cuz if if this was my web page now
15:05 - I'm loading one two three four five
15:08 - JavaScript files and I have hardly even
15:10 - written a line of code so you can see as
15:12 - this thing grows and grows and grows I
15:14 - could be making 15 20 30 G requests I
15:18 - don't want to have that many script
15:19 - files load up when I open up my page I
15:22 - want them to to be much more compressed
15:25 - so now if I look at my disc folder I've
15:28 - got script
15:29 - I've got vendor and the vendor is all
15:32 - the backbone underscore and jQuery files
15:35 - minified uh concatenated together and
15:37 - then I have my main JS which are my two
15:41 - JavaScript blog JS and Main JS they've
15:43 - been they've had all the magic done to
15:45 - them they're both together yippe it's
15:48 - awesome so that is pretty much yman and
15:53 - that's uh a pretty quick introduction to
15:56 - what it does for you uh there's some
15:58 - ways that you can depending on how they
16:00 - built the generator you might be able to
16:01 - add a view might be able to generate a
16:04 - page um but that's pretty much an intro
16:08 - to Yen hope it helps and have an awesome
16:11 - day
