00:00 - we've been learning web development from
00:02 - the very beginning and if you've missed
00:03 - any of the other videos i'm putting a
00:04 - link to the full playlist in the
00:06 - description below
00:07 - so in this video we're going to cover
00:08 - css selectors so here's a css rule and
00:12 - it consists of three parts the selector
00:14 - which says hey what elements on the page
00:16 - are we actually going to be changing and
00:18 - then you pick some properties on those
00:19 - elements and you change the property
00:22 - values that's a css rule all we've done
00:24 - so far is use selectors that target
00:26 - elements by tag name so this applies to
00:28 - every body tag on the page every ul on
00:30 - the page every li on the page but this
00:33 - will run into problems and i'll show you
00:34 - why let's say we have two sections here
00:36 - and we want to do a layout i'll do a
00:38 - really quick flexbox layouts
00:40 - sections get display flex
00:44 - the default flex direction is going to
00:46 - be row i'm fine with that let's go
00:48 - section divs
00:50 - they're going to get a background of
00:51 - gray
00:54 - a width of 100 percent
00:57 - let's go ahead and save that yeah
00:59 - looking pretty good let's give them a
01:00 - margin of 1 pixel here
01:03 - so that way we can kind of see the
01:04 - delineation between the sections okay
01:06 - this works great uh until i want to make
01:08 - these bottom ones red well how do i make
01:10 - these bottom ones red
01:12 - if i change this to red then they all
01:14 - become red every div inside of a section
01:16 - on the whole page becomes red so what i
01:18 - have to do is i actually have to target
01:21 - only the divs that are down here so we
01:23 - do that with css classes but before i
01:25 - jump into classes let me show you just a
01:28 - little bit more about basic selector
01:30 - rules and how that works so we've added
01:32 - a space here and whenever we add a space
01:35 - it says hey let's look inside of what's
01:37 - to the left of it so that space means
01:39 - let's look for divs inside of sections
01:41 - you can keep going here you can say divs
01:44 - inside of divs that are inside of
01:45 - sections or ul ally a this would be any
01:48 - a that's inside of an li that's inside
01:50 - of a ul that's inside of a div that's in
01:52 - a div that's in a section it's a pretty
01:54 - complex rule but you can go as long as
01:56 - you want
01:57 - you can also do a comma and say this is
01:59 - going to apply to more than one selector
02:01 - but let's say we also want them to apply
02:03 - to any a tag on the page so there we go
02:06 - now we have a tags on the page
02:08 - uh they're also getting the gray
02:10 - background uh and any section divs on
02:12 - the page also get the gray background so
02:14 - you can do commas you can do as many
02:15 - commas as you want we can make this
02:17 - apply to the body as well now the whole
02:18 - body gets a background color you get a
02:20 - background color you get a background
02:21 - color so that's kind of how the commas
02:23 - work spaces and commas that's your basic
02:26 - selector rules is you can add spaces to
02:28 - say look inside
02:30 - and you can add commas to say oh we're
02:32 - going to do this as well so let's look
02:34 - back to the class problem what you can
02:35 - do down here is you can add classes to
02:37 - your html
02:39 - class equals and then anything inside of
02:42 - here is a class let's give this class
02:44 - let's call it a feature box
02:47 - you can't use spaces in your class names
02:49 - because whenever you use a space you're
02:51 - giving it a second class as well so this
02:53 - will be this will have two classes
02:54 - feature box
02:56 - and we'll call the sales
02:58 - you can add it you can add it before you
02:59 - can add it sales here
03:01 - sales space feature box or feature box
03:04 - space sales it does not matter whenever
03:06 - you add a space you're adding a second
03:08 - class and you'll see what that means
03:09 - here in just a moment
03:11 - let's give this one here a class
03:13 - this will also be a feature box
03:15 - but this one will be closeouts
03:18 - so we have two feature boxes our sales
03:20 - feature box
03:21 - and our closeouts feature box and now we
03:23 - can target them so we can say uh let's
03:26 - go up here uh section dot feature box
03:30 - so this is any section with a feature
03:32 - box class inside of it doesn't matter if
03:34 - the feature box class is second or first
03:37 - if it has a feature box class it's going
03:39 - to get this rule
03:40 - uh and then also you can say any section
03:44 - feature box div gets these rules so
03:48 - nothing changed because we're still
03:50 - targeting this section and this section
03:54 - but now we can do here is feature box
03:56 - dot sales
03:57 - we're going to only target sections that
03:59 - have the class feature box and the class
04:02 - sales you'll notice i did not add spaces
04:04 - here space would say let's look inside
04:06 - of section for any element with a class
04:09 - of feature box and sales we don't want
04:11 - that we want only section elements with
04:14 - a class of feature box and sales we want
04:16 - these dots to apply to the section
04:19 - element so we connect them to it
04:21 - so now you notice that only the first
04:24 - one caught those rules all of them up
04:26 - here every section feature box is
04:28 - display flex but only the ones that are
04:31 - feature box sales get that background
04:33 - color so now i can kind of copy and
04:35 - paste and let's say feature box
04:37 - closeouts
04:39 - they're going to get a background color
04:40 - of red and boom we've solved our problem
04:44 - another thing though is we've actually
04:45 - copied some code there's this rule in
04:47 - web development d-r-y dry don't repeat
04:51 - yourself you'll hear people say i need
04:53 - to dry this code up that means that
04:55 - we're copying and pasting some things
04:57 - here that we have to maintain what if we
04:59 - want to change this margin to two pixels
05:01 - well now we have to find every place
05:03 - where we set our margin to one pixel and
05:05 - we have to change it that's not good we
05:06 - need to draw this code up to dry this
05:08 - code up it's pretty simple let's just
05:10 - say every dot feature box div
05:16 - every dot feature box div will get these
05:18 - two rules
05:20 - boom
05:20 - and then only the sales divs and the
05:23 - closeouts divs get the rule the colors
05:26 - specified so that's going to do the
05:28 - exact same thing but it's drier now if i
05:30 - want to change the margin to 2 pixels i
05:32 - only do it in one place and while it's
05:34 - not a big deal right here it's so easy
05:36 - to get your code copied to where this
05:38 - little margin one pixel is in a hundred
05:40 - different places of your website you
05:41 - don't know where it is
05:43 - another way we can clean this up is we
05:44 - no longer have to specify section here
05:46 - because dot feature box does it all
05:48 - there's not any other places on our
05:49 - website that are going to have dot
05:51 - feature box in them unless we want them
05:53 - to be a feature box so we can get rid of
05:55 - the section and look our code kind of
05:57 - reads a little easier now too
05:59 - feature boxes get display flex any divs
06:03 - inside of feature boxes get this kind of
06:05 - layout and specific feature boxes have
06:08 - different background colors that's how
06:10 - you target with classes classes you can
06:13 - have as many of any of them on a page as
06:15 - you want the other way that you can
06:16 - target is with ids
06:18 - ids get id equals
06:21 - um and we could give it something let's
06:22 - call it frank
06:24 - an id frank you target that by saying
06:26 - pound frank so anything with id frank
06:29 - let's give it a font size
06:32 - a 200 percent font size
06:35 - uh the problem with ids is you can only
06:37 - have one of this id on the entire page
06:41 - doesn't matter if you add another id
06:42 - frank down here that is illegal html it
06:46 - might work fine yep you can see google
06:48 - chrome actually handles it okay but you
06:50 - don't know what you're gonna get on
06:52 - different browsers and different devices
06:53 - because that's technically illegal html
06:56 - uh so ids usually you can get by by
06:59 - doing class names you don't really have
07:01 - to do ids stay away from unless you find
07:03 - a really good reason why you need to do
07:05 - ids but classes pretty much will always
07:07 - get the job done just fine
07:10 - so that's how you use class names to
07:12 - specify certain things
07:14 - again you can use comma and do a whole
07:16 - bunch of other specific things we want
07:18 - feature box closeouts to be read ah we
07:20 - also want i don't know
07:23 - non-feature box is that a thing probably
07:25 - not non-feature box dot closeouts to be
07:28 - read basically anything closeout divs we
07:30 - want them to be read so you can add
07:32 - commas and target multiple things on
07:34 - your page i'll leave you with one more
07:36 - thing there's there's a decent bit more
07:38 - that you'll learn ongoing with css
07:40 - selectors you don't have to know it all
07:42 - now to become a web developer so one
07:44 - more thing that i will show you is that
07:46 - the web page provides you things that
07:48 - are called pseudo classes p-s-e-u-d-o
07:51 - which means kind of pretend classes
07:53 - so pseudo classes this one would get a
07:56 - pseudo class of first child
07:58 - this would get a pseudo class of last
08:00 - child first child means that if this is
08:03 - a parent element
08:04 - the first element in there is a first
08:06 - child that's this li right here and the
08:09 - last one inside of that parent element
08:11 - is a last child so i could target all
08:13 - first child lis which is just this home
08:16 - one and give it a special background
08:17 - color
08:19 - i do that by doing a colon colon means
08:22 - i'm looking for pseudo class there are
08:23 - some pseudo classes provided
08:25 - let's give this one a background color
08:29 - of red
08:30 - boom you can see my first child got a
08:32 - background of red if i change this to
08:33 - last child
08:35 - then i last child got a background of
08:37 - red where this is useful is when i want
08:39 - to do some things like hey let's uh give
08:42 - these things a background color
08:45 - let's give them all a background color
08:46 - of gray
08:48 - let's give them rounded corners
08:54 - so now they're doing that oh well 10
08:56 - pixels that's huge what on earth was i
08:57 - thinking let's try three pixels let's
08:59 - give them some padding
09:02 - uh let's go and give them some spacing
09:06 - margin left of 20 pixels they're kind of
09:08 - spread out a little bit ah but i don't
09:10 - want this first child to be bumped over
09:13 - and that's where first child comes in
09:17 - first child will have a margin left
09:23 - of zero
09:25 - and now it bumps over and i've got the
09:27 - spacing carried out this is like the
09:29 - ugliest navigation of all time thank you
09:32 - very much i'll be here all week but it
09:34 - gets the point across sometimes you only
09:36 - want to
09:37 - mess with the first child in your layout
09:39 - in order to keep your layout looking the
09:40 - way that you desire so first child is
09:43 - out there there's also ones that are
09:45 - active
09:47 - active this is if your link is active
09:49 - right now so if i'm on the home page i
09:51 - can make this home page not be
09:53 - underlined i could say a colon active
09:57 - that's going to get text decoration
10:02 - none of course that's not going to
10:03 - happen because i'm not on the home page
10:05 - right now i'm on one called test.html
10:07 - um i could say a hover this is a really
10:10 - fun one hover gets a text decoration of
10:12 - none so whenever i hover over a link it
10:14 - gets a text decoration that goes away
10:16 - although usually you want to do
10:17 - something that's the opposite you want
10:19 - to say a text decoration
10:22 - is none
10:25 - and whenever you hover it gets underline
10:28 - so now all the text decorations go away
10:30 - and when i hover ooh they get an
10:31 - underlying thing going on nice or i
10:33 - could say that
10:35 - any li hover
10:38 - gets a background color
10:41 - of red
10:42 - so whenever i hover over one of these
10:43 - the background color flips to red so
10:45 - that's how you get some fun little
10:47 - useful interaction using pseudo classes
10:50 - that the html page provides for you i'll
10:52 - leave you with this for now like i said
10:54 - there's plenty more that you can learn
10:55 - ongoing but these are the ones that give
10:56 - you a lot of ammunition to build out the
10:59 - rest of your page in the next video
11:00 - we're going to go back to the web page
11:02 - we've been building and add images and
11:03 - wrap it up and really make it look nice
11:05 - and lovely because you guys have already
11:06 - learned quite a bit about html and css
11:10 - let's have fun with that video
11:19 - you
