00:00 - hey in this video we are going to
00:01 - continue web development for absolute
00:03 - beginners for people who know nothing if
00:05 - you have not seen the prior 3 videos
00:07 - i'll put the link in the description to
00:08 - this whole series and you'll want to
00:10 - watch that first but let's move forward
00:12 - so the first skill you're going to need
00:14 - as a web developer is the ability to
00:16 - build a layout to basically look at a
00:19 - design a graphic design of what a
00:21 - website should look like and then turn
00:24 - that into code so let's learn how you do
00:26 - that we're also going to introduce a few
00:27 - new tags along the way
00:29 - so basically the tags that we're going
00:31 - to use in this video are div tags div
00:34 - just means divider i'll show you what
00:36 - that is here let's add a bunch of div
00:37 - tags
00:38 - let's do a
00:41 - b
00:42 - c whoop i hate it when it does that
00:45 - sometimes and d i'm going to save that
00:48 - and you can see there's really nothing
00:49 - special about a div tag it just
00:51 - basically is a content block it's just a
00:54 - divider there
00:56 - and a div tag actually is this box that
00:59 - spans as much space as it has from left
01:01 - to right which is why they're stacking
01:04 - one on top of the other and not left to
01:06 - right because a div tag by default gets
01:08 - what's called a block display so it's
01:10 - going to fill out the whole content left
01:12 - to right and then the next div tag by
01:15 - default goes below it now with css we
01:17 - can change all that but that's what a
01:19 - div tag is so basically every little
01:22 - content block of your web page is a div
01:24 - tag
01:25 - but after a while developers realized
01:27 - wow if you go to the source code of a
01:29 - webpage and just see millions of div
01:31 - tags it's not very easy to read and
01:33 - understand what's going on so we
01:35 - introduced what are called semantic tags
01:37 - they're all basically div tags but they
01:40 - have different names to allow us to
01:42 - read a web page easier as we're building
01:45 - it so these tags are a header tag
01:47 - which you guessed it is usually used for
01:49 - adding a header of a website
01:51 - other tags are nav
01:53 - section
01:54 - footer all these tags are divs but they
01:58 - allow us to describe our web page in a
02:00 - way that's much easier to read and also
02:02 - a way that's much much easier for search
02:04 - engines like google to understand what
02:07 - the areas of content mean so these are
02:09 - called again semantic tags which means
02:12 - they're a lot easier to read so we're
02:14 - going to use div tags we're going to use
02:16 - semantic tags and we're also going to
02:17 - use those good old ul tags with the li
02:20 - tags inside of it you use that a lot in
02:22 - web development for your layouts but
02:25 - that's pretty much it when you're
02:26 - building layouts those are the tags that
02:28 - you use so let's get into what a layout
02:30 - is and how you know which tags to use
02:32 - where i'm going to go to a screenshot of
02:35 - bing.com here so here's bing.com and i'm
02:38 - going to pull up some boxes that i drew
02:40 - around if i had to turn this into a
02:42 - design if if you got given this
02:44 - screenshot and said hey build me a
02:46 - webpage that is laid out like this how
02:49 - would you do it so if i had to build
02:51 - this layout i'd start off with two tags
02:53 - a header tag which is this whole big
02:56 - piece up here this whole top part
02:58 - and then i do a section tag down here
03:01 - that includes all this down here so two
03:04 - tags at the very top level right inside
03:06 - of the body tag that all the rest of the
03:09 - content will go into inside of the
03:11 - header tag i would have a nav tag that
03:13 - would house the navigation
03:16 - this right here would be a ul full of
03:18 - lis for each link so this is an
03:20 - unordered list a ul and then there's an
03:22 - li and li and li and li and so on and
03:26 - over here i'd probably do three div tags
03:28 - a div here
03:30 - a div here and then a div here for the
03:33 - mobile menu kind of button so that's the
03:36 - tags that you would use then here i
03:37 - would just have a div tag for this
03:40 - and then here i would have a ul tag with
03:43 - a bunch of lis in it because again if
03:46 - you look at all these they're really
03:47 - just a bunch of
03:49 - uh it's an unordered list of items they
03:51 - just have different backgrounds and
03:52 - different text titles but they're really
03:54 - all the same thing
03:56 - so that's the tags that i would use to
03:57 - layout this entire website and then down
04:00 - here i would have three div tags as well
04:03 - and i would layer them next to each
04:04 - other from there on when you have a good
04:07 - skill set of building layouts
04:09 - all you have to learn is one bit at a
04:11 - time how to build the pieces of content
04:13 - that you want how do i build a
04:15 - navigation and make links all go side by
04:17 - side like this how do i build this
04:19 - little thing with a circle and the guy
04:21 - inside of it how do i build a search bar
04:23 - and make it look like this those are all
04:25 - little bits of css that you learn along
04:27 - the way and nobody knows it all and you
04:30 - have to google all the time to figure
04:32 - out how you do what you how to do what
04:33 - you want to do and that's part of the
04:35 - fun of being a web developer is that
04:36 - you're always always learning so the
04:38 - layout that we're going to build for our
04:40 - webpage is going to look like this we're
04:42 - going to have a header tag you guessed
04:44 - it inside we'll have a navigation and
04:46 - probably a big background image
04:48 - and then we're going to have two
04:49 - sections and a footer section one will
04:52 - have three equal boxes
04:54 - section two will just be one big section
04:56 - i don't know what we'll put in there
04:57 - maybe some text or something and then
04:59 - our footer section down here and that's
05:01 - gonna be our website so you can see it's
05:03 - really not gonna be a whole lot of tags
05:05 - to make the layout component of our
05:08 - design so let's go over to our code so
05:11 - the first thing we're going to want to
05:11 - do is create a header tag there's our
05:14 - header tag and we'll want to create two
05:15 - section tags again i'm just typing the
05:17 - tag name and hitting tab another thing i
05:19 - can do is i can do section
05:21 - star 2 and i just got two sections so
05:25 - i'll call this triple section
05:28 - because if you'll remember i'm gonna
05:30 - actually have three squares inside of
05:32 - there later on lower section
05:36 - there we go and then let's make a footer
05:38 - tag
05:40 - footer
05:41 - and i'll just add header here
05:43 - so there we have it that is our layout
05:46 - and as you can see they act just like
05:48 - divs there's really no style here at all
05:50 - so let's add a little bit of style when
05:52 - i'm building a layout the easiest way to
05:54 - start is to add background colors to
05:56 - every piece
05:57 - so i'm going to add a header
05:59 - style here let's make this background
06:02 - color black
06:05 - there we go and then let's do section
06:07 - this background color will be white
06:11 - and the font color then will probably
06:13 - need to become something else so let's
06:14 - make color
06:16 - gray
06:17 - for now sure that works and then let's
06:19 - make the footer
06:20 - it's going to have a background color
06:22 - black as well
06:27 - so there's our basic section from here
06:29 - on out we'll finish up this video by
06:30 - learning about how to add spacing around
06:33 - your different elements around your
06:35 - different tags you can see that there's
06:37 - this kind of annoying gray spacing here
06:40 - and so we're definitely going to want to
06:42 - get rid of that we're also going to want
06:43 - to control how big the header is and how
06:45 - big these sections are so there's
06:47 - basically two ways you handle spacing in
06:49 - css there are two properties that you
06:51 - would have we'll go to the header here
06:54 - there is margin
06:55 - and there is padding
06:57 - and between those two you can add all
06:58 - the spacing that you need so margin is
07:01 - pretty simple
07:02 - and padding is the same as well let's
07:04 - just add 20 pixel margin margin excuse
07:07 - me around everything you can see that
07:09 - when i did that i got 20 pixels uh up
07:12 - here 20 pixels here 20 pixels there and
07:15 - 20 pixels there it didn't solve our
07:17 - problem but we will get to that in a
07:19 - moment
07:19 - but that's the easiest way to add
07:21 - something now if i change this to
07:23 - padding
07:25 - padding adds that spacing inside of your
07:28 - box so you can see my box went all the
07:30 - way to the edges but now i have 20
07:31 - pixels of spacing here
07:33 - here here and i also have it over here
07:36 - you just can't tell because the text
07:37 - doesn't go that far so it's margin and
07:40 - it's padding and there's three ways that
07:42 - you can enter this let's go back to
07:44 - margin here
07:45 - so you can enter it with one value
07:48 - and one value applies it to all sides of
07:50 - your box you can also add two values if
07:54 - you add two values let's go 20 pixels
07:56 - and 40 pixels then this goes to top and
07:59 - bottom
08:00 - and this goes to left and right you can
08:01 - see top and bottom have this smaller 20
08:03 - pixels and left and right have the 40
08:06 - pixels and then you can also add four
08:08 - values which it works like a clock top
08:12 - right
08:13 - bottom and left so think at the clock
08:15 - you have the top of the clock and then
08:17 - you have the right of the clock and then
08:19 - you have the bottom of the clock and
08:20 - then you have the left of the clock
08:23 - so starts at the clock we have our 20
08:24 - pixels 40 pixels 10 pixels and 50 pixels
08:29 - so those are the three ways you can
08:30 - enter it you can enter it with one value
08:32 - two values or four values you can enter
08:35 - it with three values as well but it's a
08:36 - little strange
08:38 - padding is the exact same way you can
08:41 - see that it just all changed to the
08:42 - inside of my box now 20 40 10 and 50. so
08:47 - padding works exactly like margin does
08:50 - you can use one value two values or four
08:52 - values so now to get rid of this little
08:55 - gray area here by default the body tag
08:58 - has margin and padding on it and that
09:00 - might actually be different among
09:02 - browsers so we want to make sure we
09:04 - specify that let's make sure the margin
09:07 - is zero
09:09 - and we're just going to say zero and the
09:11 - padding is also zero let's hit save and
09:14 - ta-dah we have solved our problem with
09:16 - those ugly edge borders no matter how
09:18 - much i stretch my web page out here it
09:21 - always goes all the way to the edge
09:23 - which is super nice excellent so that's
09:26 - one thing that we've solved
09:28 - and then another thing that's very
09:30 - important to note is these don't all
09:32 - have to be in pixels there's a lot of
09:34 - things called units in css
09:37 - this padding can be 20 pixels
09:39 - it could also be 20 percent which is 20
09:42 - percent of whatever space we have you
09:43 - can see whoa 20 percent here is not very
09:46 - much because my window is not very wide
09:50 - so 20 to my window is just a little bit
09:52 - but 20 percent of the height of the
09:54 - window is a lot more uh so percentage is
09:58 - really interesting concept you can see
10:00 - as i get wider
10:02 - that 20 becomes a lot bigger so
10:05 - percentage is interesting it's it's a
10:07 - mixed bag you don't always want to use
10:09 - it there's about 10 different css units
10:12 - uh for now we're just going to stick to
10:14 - pixels it's the easiest way to start
10:16 - it's the easiest thing thing to think
10:18 - about because a pixel is just a dot on
10:21 - your screen so we've gotten that let's
10:23 - go ahead and add some padding here to
10:25 - the rest of our sections and we've got
10:28 - this video done let's go over here to
10:30 - the section let's add padding let's just
10:32 - add a padding of 20 pixels all around
10:37 - 20 pixels there
10:39 - and on the footer 20 pixels although
10:41 - that looks a little bit much on the
10:43 - footer let's add maybe 10 pixels and
10:45 - then 20 pixels so the top and bottom
10:48 - will be a little bit less but the left
10:49 - and right have that larger and i'm
10:51 - zoomed in here this is the actual size
10:53 - of my web page if i zoom out to 100
10:57 - so i'm zoomed in so it looks a little
10:58 - bigger that's actually what our sections
11:01 - look like so that's your basic css
11:03 - layout stuff you've you've got your
11:05 - semantic tags and you've got your boxes
11:08 - and you're just going to add margin and
11:10 - padding to get them to lay out the way
11:11 - that you want to in the next video we'll
11:14 - deal with the navigation and we'll also
11:15 - deal with this little triple section
11:17 - here
