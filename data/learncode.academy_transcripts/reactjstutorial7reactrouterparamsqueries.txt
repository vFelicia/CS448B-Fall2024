00:00 - so before I get into handling
00:02 - complicated data with react that would
00:04 - be flux or Redux which I'm really
00:06 - excited to get into uh let's go ahead
00:08 - and just cover a little bit more on
00:10 - routing handling routes handling route
00:12 - information and then let's get this HTML
00:15 - if you'll remember right now the entire
00:17 - HTML is just rendering into this so we
00:20 - want to get almost all this HTML into
00:23 - our actual react single page app so
00:25 - we'll want to convert that all as well
00:27 - once those two are out of the way we're
00:29 - ready to start taking on a a framework
00:31 - style approach to react um and that's
00:34 - really where react gets fun really
00:36 - starts give you some great mental
00:37 - patterns uh so let's look at uh some
00:40 - more routing features right now lots of
00:42 - times say with archives you'll actually
00:44 - let me go back to my page lot times you
00:46 - want to go archives SL some article or
00:49 - say some article some
00:52 - filter you know you'll actually want to
00:54 - go to a specific archive so the easy way
00:57 - to do this is to um don't don't want to
01:00 - save my web
01:01 - page easiest way to do this is just add
01:04 - another route or more detail to my route
01:06 - so we're going to go to archives and
01:08 - we're going to go to specific
01:09 - article and that'll be called article so
01:13 - I'm adding what's uh called a Pam now to
01:16 - my URL so let's go and do that let's
01:19 - refresh so now I got archives which no
01:21 - longer matches that's very important to
01:23 - know now this path is this route is only
01:26 - going to match archives article so
01:27 - that's going to be a specific article
01:31 - um and now it's going to match archives
01:34 - SL some article let's go ahead and look
01:36 - at this archives let's go ahead console
01:38 - log props
01:41 - now so I'm in the archives route again
01:44 - which is whenever we go archives and
01:46 - give it an article it's going to render
01:48 - the archives component so in this
01:50 - archives component let's go ahead and
01:52 - inspect these props now uh you can see
01:54 - that it's passing a pams and article has
01:56 - a value so it's some
01:58 - article some other
02:02 - article let's go look at it now
02:05 - rendered article is some other article
02:07 - excellent let's actually go spit this
02:09 - out on the page
02:18 - here there we go this props H sorry not
02:21 - props
02:23 - pams and I'll clean that up in a second
02:26 - so there you go some other
02:28 - article some other you know it's
02:31 - basically going to change as my as my
02:34 - path changes so that's cool um and the
02:36 - way you could really clean that up is
02:38 - you'd go const uh
02:43 - pams equals this props and then I can
02:46 - just go pam. article that cleans it up a
02:48 - different bit a difference or if if you
02:50 - were pulling multiple pams and then
02:52 - you're pulling multiple values out of
02:54 - those pams you could even clean up
02:58 - more so then this could just be article
03:01 - you know for if you're if you're adding
03:03 - a lot of values to your render method it
03:05 - really helps to have nice clean small
03:08 - variable names U so there we go that's
03:10 - rendered in uh another thing you can do
03:13 - without any configuration on your route
03:15 - is just you can just use Query variables
03:18 - so we can just add a question mark and
03:21 - let's go say date equals
03:23 - today and now if I look at again my
03:27 - props object I can look at the location
03:30 - and I've got this query in there and
03:31 - that's just real time going to be any of
03:33 - your query brand values date today and
03:36 - filter equals
03:39 - none so then I can go back to location
03:43 - I've got date today filter none so let's
03:45 - go ahead and snatch that pull that
03:48 - in cons query
03:54 - equals pulling query out of
03:56 - location and then let's go ahead and get
03:59 - what did I Ed date and
04:03 - filter so then let's uh wrap this in a
04:06 - div since I can't return
04:09 - just three
04:13 - H1s and then let's actually spit out
04:18 - date
04:22 - filter and there we go now I'm snatching
04:24 - all my information that the user might
04:26 - be passing in there date today filter
04:28 - none and then if I were to say filter
04:30 - all there you go it's all going to
04:32 - change real time yesterday blah blah
04:36 - blah um and then lastly you can also
04:38 - make stuff uh you can make stuff
04:40 - optional so I can go to archives and I
04:42 - can actually just wrap these in
04:45 - parns and now it will match if I do
04:48 - article or if I don't have article in
04:50 - there so that's probably more what I
04:52 - want the archives page to be doing so
04:54 - that's how you do that let's go and take
04:55 - this archives link now uh the last thing
04:58 - I want to show you in this video is lots
05:00 - of times you want to know if your route
05:01 - is active you want to add a class like
05:04 - up here if the featured route was active
05:06 - I'd want this to have the class. active
05:08 - for all my bootstrap stuff to look good
05:11 - uh so that's very simple to do with
05:12 - react router let me go to my layout yep
05:15 - here we go so you're simply just going
05:18 - to add active class name as long as
05:20 - you're using the link component you
05:22 - simply just go active class name equals
05:25 - and then whatever you want that to be so
05:26 - in this case I've added active class
05:28 - name equals test
05:30 - so whenever settings is let's go ahead
05:32 - inspect this archives element I do not
05:35 - have a class name of test but when the
05:37 - archives route is there Boom the active
05:39 - class of test just got added and again
05:42 - it's gone so that's kind of really nice
05:44 - and then if you wanted to do it
05:46 - programmatically
05:48 - programmatically um then you can
05:51 - actually get this out of History so if
05:54 - you remember I always have that props
05:56 - history right there you can see so let's
05:58 - get history out out of
06:01 - props and then you can go
06:04 - history do
06:08 - isactive and we'll just look up we'll
06:11 - just look up
06:14 - archives let's console log
06:18 - this so we're going to console log if
06:21 - archives is
06:22 - active let's say so
06:26 - false
06:28 - true false
06:30 - true there you go
06:32 - so now um everything's working we can go
06:36 - ahead and just pull our components in
06:38 - I'm not going to bore you by doing this
06:40 - in front of you uh but I'm just going to
06:42 - go ahead and take the navigation out put
06:43 - it into layout as a navigation
06:45 - components uh get the footer out into
06:48 - its own stuff basically just get all
06:49 - this stuff broken out into layout and
06:52 - then from here on out we're going to
06:53 - cover flux and Redux and data and a
06:56 - whole bunch of fun stuff so at this
06:58 - point get comfortable with how react
07:00 - Works get comfortable with how routing
07:02 - works you want to know those well before
07:04 - you get into the framework aspect of
07:07 - react so once those are good to go check
07:09 - out the next videos
