00:00 - so a question I've been asked a ton is
00:02 - how do I get my website online once I've
00:04 - coded it here's a website I've got
00:06 - here's the files for it and I can view
00:08 - it in Chrome but I want to get this
00:10 - thing online with its own domain name
00:12 - we're going to cover that in this email
00:13 - and it's a lot simpler than you might
00:15 - think here's the steps uh one you got to
00:18 - get a domain if you don't have one uh
00:20 - that's going to be about $12 a month uh
00:22 - $12 a year I'm sorry um and then you got
00:25 - to get a web host that's about roughly
00:27 - $5 a month we're going to do one that's
00:30 - a month uh because you get unlimited
00:32 - domain names with this one uh I
00:34 - recommend for a web host going with uh
00:38 - hostgator.com I have some codes for that
00:40 - uh these guys tend to be the cheapest
00:42 - and they have great customer support so
00:45 - you're going to get a lot out of them um
00:47 - and you can also use drop 25 perk drop
00:50 - 25% coupon code uh to save 25% or you
00:54 - can do drop 10 bucks uh and save 10
00:57 - bucks on that so we're going to go
00:58 - through that process of what all that
01:00 - looks like so you're comfortable before
01:02 - you start it you're going to upload your
01:03 - files and then you're going to dance and
01:05 - rejoice because your website is live
01:07 - that's pretty much it to upload your
01:09 - files I recommend cyberduck I think it's
01:12 - just a great simple free program and
01:14 - that's it so let's get into host skater
01:17 - and do step one all right so here we are
01:19 - at Host
01:28 - skat.dk well over a dozen helped a lot
01:32 - of people that are using other hosts and
01:33 - this just has the best for the price um
01:36 - if you go to web hosting we're going to
01:38 - get our domain and our web hosting at
01:39 - the same time uh you have two choices
01:41 - you can go single domain that's the
01:43 - cheapest but if you bump it up like $2 a
01:45 - month or I guess $3 if you were good at
01:48 - math 350 uh you can get unlimited
01:50 - domains which means you can have all the
01:52 - websites you want as long as you pay for
01:54 - the domain name uh and this is
01:56 - definitely the one I'd recommend that
01:57 - way if you want to add your brother 's
02:00 - website anybody else's website you can
02:02 - do it for free they just have to buy the
02:05 - domain um let's go Will's awesome site
02:09 - Wills awesome site is available so Wills
02:11 - awom site.com I'm actually going to buy
02:13 - this um and let it expire so uh here we
02:18 - go I'm going to do a one-month baby
02:20 - package if you did the 36 months you can
02:22 - apply that big drop
02:27 - 25% coupon on there and that's going to
02:29 - save
02:30 - $75 uh but I wouldn't do that I'm not
02:32 - going to do that for this example uh
02:34 - since this is a fake website I'm never
02:36 - going to use I'm just going to do one
02:38 - month and I'm just going to do drop 10
02:42 - bucks uh to actually bring that down and
02:45 - then I'm going to uncheck all these
02:47 - add-ons you do not need these add-ons uh
02:50 - I never ever recommend for anybody to do
02:53 - these add-ons so there we go that brings
02:55 - us down to a total of $12 which is
02:57 - basically the cost of our domain name
02:59 - and the first first month of Hosting is
03:00 - free I'm going to fill out all my
03:02 - billing information and I'll be right
03:05 - back all right we're successful I was
03:08 - able to register for the hosting um and
03:11 - now I've gotten this email which you
03:13 - will want to guard with your life
03:14 - because this is all the server
03:16 - information uh and this is what you want
03:18 - to pass on to somebody else if the
03:20 - website ever changes hands this is
03:22 - basically server access uh here's kind
03:24 - of what it is is this is our control
03:26 - panel where you can edit a lot of stuff
03:28 - install WordPress add email addresses
03:31 - for your domain name you just got uh
03:33 - this is your username and your password
03:35 - to log into the website that's my domain
03:37 - which I've I click there it does not
03:39 - work yet because a domain takes 1 to 24
03:42 - hours to do what's called propagation uh
03:44 - so it can happen as fast as an hour but
03:46 - i' I'd give it a full day uh and then
03:49 - your server IP this is actually your
03:51 - server uh that this domain name now
03:54 - points to uh and so we can actually
03:57 - access the server with this IP until our
03:59 - domain name propagates so let's go ahead
04:01 - and copy the server IP let's go ahead
04:04 - and crank open cyberduck and hit open
04:06 - connection we're going to connect to the
04:08 - server now in the future we can use
04:11 - Wills awom site.com uh but once again
04:13 - that's not propagated yet so cyberduck
04:15 - won't be able to connect to it either
04:18 - let's copy the username let's copy the
04:22 - password and then where sometimes you if
04:25 - you run into any errors here you may
04:26 - need to change your connect mode to
04:28 - passive FTP
04:30 - uh so if you're run any problems do that
04:33 - so here we go I've connected to my
04:35 - server and if I go to
04:37 - www um sometimes you'll have a default
04:39 - HTML file that you'll just want to go
04:41 - ahead and delete you don't need it let's
04:43 - go ahead and just copy all of my files
04:46 - let's just drag them on over cyberduck
04:49 - is burping at me yes don't show again I
04:52 - want to switch to secure so there you go
04:55 - all the files are now copying over to my
04:58 - web my web host and that's pretty much
05:02 - it uh the way we can connect to it and
05:04 - see if that worked is let's go and copy
05:06 - the server IP here's kind of a quick
05:09 - workaround is you can go to your
05:12 - username which it made will stir it cut
05:15 - off the end so I can now go to my IP
05:17 - address tildo wilster and this will be
05:21 - my website there we go I had to hit
05:23 - refresh because it was still in the
05:25 - process of uploading there you go and
05:28 - that's it my website is now online and
05:30 - within 24 hours I can go to what what is
05:33 - it again wills awom site.com and hit ref
05:37 - and load it up and it will be my learn
05:39 - code rocks website let me actually prove
05:41 - it to you that this is what happened I'm
05:44 - going to go change this learn code is
05:48 - awesome let me change it what is that
05:49 - learn code rocks really
05:53 - rocks there we go let's go ahead and
05:57 - redrago HTML file up
06:00 - it's probably going to ask me if I want
06:01 - to replace it yep I do want to replace
06:03 - it let's hit refresh and now learn code
06:06 - really rocks and that is how you put
06:08 - your website online hope you enjoyed the
06:11 - lesson and have a great
06:13 - day
