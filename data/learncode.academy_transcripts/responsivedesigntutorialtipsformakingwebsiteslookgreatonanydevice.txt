00:00 - hey in this video we are going to be
00:02 - covering responsive design what
00:04 - responsive design means is you want your
00:06 - website to look great on any size device
00:09 - from the smallest of mobile devices all
00:11 - the way up to the largest of desktop
00:13 - screens that's the concept of responsive
00:15 - design now we've got a website here that
00:17 - is not responsive we kind of just built
00:19 - out a website as a part of our tutorial
00:21 - for new beginners course
00:22 - if you'd like to see this course and how
00:24 - we got to here i'm going to put the link
00:26 - to the full course in the description
00:27 - and i'm also going to put in the
00:29 - description the link to the code as is
00:31 - now and the link to the code where we
00:33 - end up when we make this responsive so
00:35 - you can see right now that if you were
00:36 - to view this on a small screen we've got
00:38 - some stuff that starts breaking down
00:40 - this content starts bleeding off the
00:42 - page the menu gets weird and this
00:44 - background starts looping so at this
00:46 - point we're going to want to add
00:47 - responsive rules so when i'm approaching
00:50 - turning a website into a responsive
00:52 - website there's really two things that i
00:54 - think about phase one is let's work with
00:56 - the content let's make sure the
00:57 - responsive navigation or the net let's
00:59 - make sure the navigation looks good on
01:01 - mobile and desktop devices sometimes
01:03 - that means writing a completely new
01:05 - mobile navigation or sometimes that
01:07 - means just adjusting your navigation to
01:10 - look good on mobile technically you
01:12 - actually want to design mobile first
01:13 - these days because more people are
01:14 - probably going to hit your website
01:16 - statistically from a mobile device than
01:18 - a desktop device we started desktop
01:20 - first in this because it's a little
01:22 - easier to learn that way
01:23 - but you should actually design mobile
01:25 - first and then make adjustments for
01:27 - desktop devices
01:29 - so i'll start with the navigation make
01:31 - sure that looks good on all devices and
01:32 - then i'll go to my content blocks like
01:34 - this is a content block here and you can
01:36 - see that we've got some help that that
01:38 - this needs we got to give this area some
01:39 - love so that's what i'll do first
01:42 - content blocks navigation and then all
01:44 - my content blocks and then i will work
01:46 - on images i want to make sure that the
01:49 - images are optimized and we only load as
01:51 - big of an image as we really need to
01:52 - load and then also our actual content
01:55 - images so we deal with our background
01:57 - images the ones that are made in css
01:59 - and then we're going to want to deal
02:00 - with our images our img tags we're going
02:02 - to want to make sure that those are
02:04 - sharp and the correct size the most
02:06 - optimized size for every device that's
02:09 - going to be viewing it okay that's a
02:10 - mouthful wow let's get into this it's
02:12 - not actually as complicated as i may
02:14 - have just made it sound but that's the
02:16 - approach start with your content then
02:19 - move to your images and tada you have a
02:21 - responsive website so for our content
02:23 - let's go ahead and start with the
02:25 - navigation but before i do i want to
02:27 - introduce a new css thing to you and
02:29 - that is the media query you do a media
02:31 - query by doing at media
02:34 - screen
02:35 - and
02:36 - uh and then you open and close parens
02:37 - and open and close curly braces
02:40 - if what's in here is true we're going to
02:42 - add new css to the page so let's add
02:45 - some new css real quick let's say our
02:46 - features block which is this white
02:48 - background block here
02:51 - gets a background
02:53 - of red so nothing's going to happen
02:55 - because i have bad syntax here but if
02:58 - what's in here is true then this new css
03:00 - will get added to the page in the order
03:02 - i've declared it here so let's say a max
03:05 - width of 400 pixels if our screen is up
03:09 - to 400 pixels so 400 pixels or below
03:12 - then that new css gets added to the page
03:14 - and
03:15 - there you go you see it on a small
03:17 - device so let's then go ahead and maybe
03:20 - also add another rule here let's copy
03:21 - and paste this
03:23 - and say if your screen is
03:26 - up to 800 pixels let's make this pink
03:29 - and so yeah now you can see that it's
03:31 - pink if we go bigger then it's white and
03:33 - if we continue to shrink down it's oh no
03:36 - it never turns red why doesn't it turn
03:38 - red because well these both match are we
03:42 - below 400 pixels yes we are add this to
03:44 - the page are we below 800 pixels yes we
03:47 - are add this to the page and this
03:49 - overwrites this so it's a simple fix
03:52 - i've just defined my media queries in
03:55 - backwards order i need to go like this
03:57 - there we go and now you can see that
03:59 - it's going to say is it below 800 yes it
04:02 - is add pink is it below 400 yes it is
04:06 - add red so now it's going to match 400
04:09 - overwrites and then 400 goes away
04:12 - leaving pink and then pink goes away
04:14 - leaving white so really this brings us
04:17 - to that first point of media queries is
04:18 - you want to make sure that you define
04:20 - them in the correct order
04:22 - i'm going in a desktop down version
04:25 - right now which is using max widths i'm
04:28 - starting with everything right all these
04:30 - rules apply to everything
04:32 - and then i'm saying well if you have
04:34 - something smaller than 800 pixels let's
04:36 - kind of add some pink to that and if you
04:38 - have something even smaller let's add
04:40 - even more edge case rules so that's a
04:42 - desktop down approach a mobile first
04:45 - approach is going to be using min width
04:48 - and it's going to go the opposite
04:49 - direction so if you have a min width
04:51 - these are going to apply to the smallest
04:53 - of devices on up
04:55 - and then as the device gets bigger we're
04:56 - going to add more rules and then as the
04:59 - device gets bigger we're going to add
05:01 - even more rules so that's kind of a
05:03 - mobile up approach you can see that i'm
05:04 - going to start off pink and then red
05:07 - and then it goes from there so that's a
05:09 - mobile first approach and that's how
05:11 - media queries work so let's go and get
05:12 - rid of these and actually write some
05:14 - media queries now to deal with our
05:16 - design now kind of some old school ways
05:18 - of thinking in terms of css media
05:20 - queries is
05:22 - where are my break points for mobile and
05:24 - where are my break points for tablet
05:25 - this is kind of when responsive design
05:27 - first became a thing people would think
05:29 - of it this way they think of well what's
05:31 - an average size mobile device let's call
05:33 - it there and let's make a break point
05:36 - there and then go out all the mobile
05:38 - rules and then where's an average sized
05:40 - tablet device let's make a break point
05:41 - there and then add all my media rules
05:43 - but that's really not the proper way of
05:45 - thinking of it nowadays because there's
05:47 - any size of device out there imaginable
05:50 - that could view your page you really
05:51 - need every size to look good so instead
05:54 - of saying where are my break points for
05:56 - different devices you need to say where
05:58 - does my design start breaking down and
06:00 - start to warrant a different approach so
06:03 - in this case you can see my design
06:05 - starts breaking down somewhere around
06:07 - this like six to eight hundred pixel
06:08 - mark
06:09 - that's when i lose my
06:11 - content down here that's when the menu
06:13 - starts wrapping around and doing weird
06:15 - stuff so what you really want to ask is
06:17 - where does my design break down
06:19 - let's add some media queries at those
06:21 - points and start addressing issues
06:23 - that's going to be way faster and it's
06:26 - also the proper way to think about a
06:27 - website so let's start with the
06:29 - navigation up here the design breaks
06:30 - down around here let's add some media
06:32 - queries to fix this i'm going to scroll
06:35 - up here to my header
06:36 - and then after my header i'm going to
06:38 - add a media query
06:40 - and you can do several things you can
06:42 - add completely big chunks of media query
06:45 - rules at the bottom of your css or you
06:48 - can add multiple small ones with each
06:51 - section i'm i think for the simplicity
06:53 - of this website i'm going to be able to
06:55 - go just fine by adding some responsive
06:57 - rules to the bottom of the header
06:59 - and then some responsive rules to the
07:01 - bottom of the features that way they're
07:02 - easy to find and easy to track so i'm
07:04 - just going to go make a comment uh
07:06 - responsive
07:08 - rules
07:09 - and then i'm going to go ahead and add a
07:10 - media query here media
07:12 - screen
07:14 - and and then open and close and then
07:16 - open and close so let's find out where
07:18 - our break point is here an easy way to
07:20 - do this is to open developer tools by
07:21 - clicking view developer
07:24 - developer tools and as soon as i do when
07:26 - i resize my screen yay i get these like
07:29 - little pixel dimensions here so let's
07:31 - find exactly where my design breaks down
07:33 - you see
07:35 - it's right around up there we go 715
07:38 - pixels so it's 715 pixels i'm going to
07:41 - add my first rule i'm going to close out
07:43 - those developer tools i might not even
07:44 - need them there so for a max width
07:48 - of 715 pixels
07:50 - let's do something cool now we just need
07:52 - to figure out what we're going to do so
07:54 - let's go ahead and shrink this down a
07:55 - little bit
07:56 - i think what i'd like to do is actually
07:58 - make locations and contact up here for
08:00 - this full line of menu items and then
08:02 - drop this logo down below now there's a
08:05 - few different ways i could approach that
08:06 - let me go to my html
08:08 - some people will actually use javascript
08:10 - to remove this from the dom and then
08:12 - re-add it down below you could totally
08:15 - do that
08:16 - you could write a completely new menu ul
08:20 - and so that would be this one and so
08:21 - this one goes away on desktop
08:24 - and this one appears on mobile that
08:26 - makes sense in a lot of situations
08:28 - especially if you have say a mobile menu
08:30 - up here with a hamburger menu that
08:31 - slides out sometimes the dom structure
08:35 - looks completely different in this case
08:37 - i want very similar dom structure i just
08:39 - want these two menu items up here so i'm
08:41 - just going to hack it in and go like
08:42 - this then i'm going to class
08:45 - equals mobile
08:47 - and i'm going to add a class equals
08:48 - desktop
08:51 - down there so class mobile
08:53 - and then class equals desktop
08:55 - and so i'm going to show these when i
08:58 - get bigger
08:59 - and i'm going to show these when i get
09:01 - smaller that's pretty easy to do so when
09:03 - i hit save i now have duplicate content
09:05 - there no problem at all let's just go
09:08 - over here and let's do header
09:11 - mobile
09:13 - against display none
09:16 - so by default my mobile things will just
09:18 - display none
09:19 - and then when i get over here then
09:22 - header mobile
09:25 - gets display inline block
09:30 - the way it should
09:32 - and header display or header let's close
09:35 - this
09:36 - header desktop
09:38 - gets display none
09:39 - so when this kicks in it's going to
09:41 - overwrite the two and there we go those
09:44 - two are showing and those two below are
09:46 - gone hey pretty cool that's that's
09:48 - working well right there let's go ahead
09:50 - and shrink this
09:52 - let's see
09:55 - nice everything is working
09:57 - so you can see that those two go away
09:59 - boom
10:02 - and then that one comes down excellent
10:03 - this is working my navigation is kind of
10:05 - solved with just those couple rules
10:07 - everything's looking good now this
10:08 - background image doesn't quite look
10:10 - right
10:11 - but everything looks good as well let's
10:13 - go ahead and change this um header
10:14 - height to be something more like 200.
10:19 - so there we go that kind of shrinks down
10:20 - as well so once you get to that break
10:21 - point
10:22 - it shrinks down the background image can
10:24 - use a little tweaking but i'm going to
10:25 - leave that for the next phase of this
10:27 - tutorial
10:28 - so there we go boom boom nice my
10:30 - navigation is working good let's move on
10:31 - to this content block
10:33 - we can go down here and add a responsive
10:35 - rule as well let's go add responsive
10:37 - rules
10:40 - and let's get a media query going here
10:41 - for that same breakpoint it looks like
10:43 - it's right around that 715 pixels as
10:44 - well so i'm just going to make the whole
10:46 - display kind of flip at 715 pixels
10:52 - and so we're going to do is we're going
10:53 - to go ahead and change this
10:56 - i'm going to make each one of these
10:57 - display block you can see that what we
10:59 - have right now is we've got our features
11:02 - and it's display flex but if i to change
11:04 - this to display block
11:06 - then it's not going to flex box display
11:08 - anymore each item is going to get its
11:10 - own row because they're all just going
11:12 - to be display block cool that's all i
11:14 - have to do so in here
11:15 - let's go features
11:21 - and so now when i come over here we're
11:22 - getting a flexbox layout and as soon as
11:25 - you go to there we're getting a display
11:26 - block that's pretty cool but i'm not
11:28 - super in love with it
11:30 - and also you might not need these rules
11:32 - at all
11:34 - what i can do is i can turn these off if
11:36 - you're actually smart with how you build
11:38 - your layouts you might not need those
11:40 - responsive display changes
11:42 - i can just turn flex wrap on and these
11:46 - will automatically wrap around so when
11:48 - this starts running out of space it'll
11:49 - wrap down to its own line so i'm just
11:52 - going to go flex wrap
11:54 - wrap
11:56 - and without any media queries i should
11:59 - be okay
12:00 - there we go you can see it actually
12:02 - looks nicer it starts wrapping around to
12:04 - a two in one display and if i get even
12:06 - smaller well now i get the one one one
12:09 - display so this is kind of a lesson to
12:11 - point out that you might not need media
12:13 - queries if you're just better with your
12:15 - design layouts
12:17 - if you can make your layouts by using
12:19 - flexbox or css grid in a little bit of a
12:21 - smarter way then the content each
12:24 - content block can kind of manage itself
12:26 - based on the space it has and you don't
12:27 - really need media queries to handle that
12:29 - about the only thing i want to do here
12:31 - is i noticed here when i came down a
12:32 - little smaller oh we're good this is
12:35 - nice i'm happy okay that's been very
12:37 - very easy so at this point we've kind of
12:39 - dealt with the content blocks and you
12:41 - just take them a block at a time and
12:42 - figure out what you want to do do you
12:44 - want to change these do you want to turn
12:46 - them from circles to squares when you
12:47 - got a small screen do whatever you want
12:50 - the the sky's the limit because you can
12:51 - add completely new chunks of css based
12:54 - on your screen size
12:56 - so now let's talk about images i'm
12:58 - actually not going to dive all the way
13:00 - into images into this tutorial because
13:02 - it's a pretty big conversation but in
13:05 - short you're going to deal with images
13:06 - in two ways you can go with the
13:08 - background images and then you can
13:10 - actually deal with the content images
13:12 - the img tags so the background images
13:14 - are a little bit more straightforward
13:16 - you can use your responsive rules to
13:18 - load in completely different background
13:20 - images you can have low you can have
13:22 - logo large you can have logo medium logo
13:25 - small and load in different ones based
13:27 - on different screen sizes
13:29 - and css is smart enough to load all the
13:31 - css and know which one image to go grab
13:34 - so that's kind of how you deal with
13:36 - background images
13:37 - and you also want to maybe change the
13:39 - position of them so here we have you can
13:42 - see that as we hit that first break
13:45 - and we kind of can't see the logo
13:47 - anymore i kind of want this little
13:48 - oatmeal loaf to kind of go down a little
13:50 - bit so let's make this background image
13:53 - what do we got here header background
13:54 - image you can see position is center
13:56 - let's come over here and go position
14:00 - we can go x and y so right now this
14:02 - would be like zero x and zero y uh let's
14:05 - make the y maybe something like 30
14:07 - pixels
14:08 - oops sorry background position that's
14:10 - why nothing moved
14:11 - background position there you go so uh
14:14 - 30 pixels is bad we don't want that
14:15 - let's go
14:16 - negative 30 pixels there you go we're
14:19 - slowly kind of pulling it up
14:21 - negative 40 pixels
14:23 - and at that point i can kind of start
14:25 - realizing you know i actually want this
14:26 - to be 250 pixels tall and that's
14:29 - starting to feel a little better so
14:30 - let's make it negative 30 pixels 250
14:33 - pixels it's a lot of tweaking that you
14:35 - have to do and then as we get even
14:36 - smaller
14:38 - i'm going to want that to adjust even
14:40 - more because now my 250 pixel height
14:42 - doesn't make sense so i'm going to add
14:44 - yet another media query here
14:47 - let's say under 500 pixels
14:51 - i want my height to be 200 now
14:58 - so there we go i've solved the header
15:00 - heights problem
15:01 - and i also want to bump this position
15:03 - down a little bit more at this point so
15:05 - background position
15:09 - and negative 10 pixels let's change it
15:11 - even more to zero there we go so i can
15:14 - kind of see the logo now so here i'm at
15:15 - a height of 200 pixels
15:18 - and my background position is zero or
15:20 - technically negative zero whatever
15:22 - that's all about and then boom i've
15:23 - bumped it to 250
15:25 - and there i'm bumping it to the full
15:27 - 400. so now it's looking pretty good on
15:29 - each device and realistically users
15:31 - don't ever resize their browsers
15:34 - they're going to load up at this size or
15:36 - they're going to load up at this size or
15:37 - they're going to load up at this size
15:38 - they're just going to see what they see
15:40 - when they load up and so we've adjusted
15:42 - our background images that's working
15:43 - pretty well
15:45 - we could probably optimize and tell this
15:47 - to load in a different size of
15:49 - background image because right now it's
15:50 - loading in a background image that is
15:52 - this big so that's not very optimized
15:54 - for mobile especially if they're on a 3g
15:56 - connection so we could actually tell the
15:58 - background image
16:00 - to be a completely different url you
16:02 - know some image small
16:05 - and so it's going to load in something
16:06 - else that's kind of how you'd optimize
16:08 - those background images now let's talk
16:10 - about optimizing these actual content
16:13 - images which is anything with an img tag
16:16 - i'm not going to go into all the way to
16:17 - do this because it truly is its own
16:19 - conversation but i will tell you that
16:21 - there's two ways that you deal with it
16:24 - you deal with it with source set which
16:26 - is src sct
16:28 - a source set attribute and the source
16:30 - set attribute is when you have the exact
16:32 - same image in the exact same proportions
16:36 - but you just want to load larger or
16:38 - smaller versions of it so if it's a 4x6
16:41 - and it's the exact same photo
16:43 - then source set is the approach that you
16:46 - want to use now if you want to actually
16:48 - crop an image differently
16:50 - or maybe show it square it one size and
16:52 - rectangular add another then you
16:54 - actually want to use the html5 picture
16:57 - tag
