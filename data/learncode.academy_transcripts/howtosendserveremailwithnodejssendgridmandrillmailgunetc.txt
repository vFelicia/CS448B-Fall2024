00:01 - so if you've never sent email from a web
00:03 - application that can be a daunting idea
00:05 - at first uh but it's actually really
00:07 - easy for anyone that's done it so we're
00:09 - just going to show you how to send email
00:11 - from a no. JS application the process is
00:13 - very similar for a PHP or Ruby on Rails
00:16 - app uh but since I've been doing node
00:18 - tutorials we're going to stick to this
00:20 - and so it's a lot easier to use an
00:23 - external service because for several
00:25 - reasons one you don't have to configure
00:26 - your server to be a mail server that
00:29 - doesn't go to fam which can be a journey
00:31 - all on its own uh and it's just so much
00:34 - more simple uh and more reliable to let
00:37 - someone else handle that part of the
00:39 - process for you just like letting
00:40 - someone else handle your Hardware I
00:42 - think email is something that is always
00:44 - worth it to let someone else handle some
00:46 - main Services out there for it mandril
00:49 - send
00:50 - grid and mail Gun there's probably a
00:53 - dozen more these seem to be three of the
00:55 - big players um I can say that of the two
00:58 - I've I've used mandril and SRA I do
01:00 - prefer send grid they both will give you
01:02 - 12,000 emails a month for free 400 a day
01:06 - I think is how they cap it uh so they'll
01:08 - give you that many a month for free
01:10 - although Mandrill sometimes will go to
01:13 - spam um and it may have to do with the
01:15 - size of the website smaller websites or
01:17 - something uh but I also feel like
01:18 - mandril is a little bit slower to
01:20 - deliver email send grid on a brand new
01:22 - website nobody knows about will not go
01:24 - to spam and um it's just reliable you'll
01:28 - get an email in about 5 Seconds so we're
01:30 - going to be doing a send grid example uh
01:33 - so what you need to do is you need to go
01:35 - npm install uh here's what I have right
01:37 - here just so you can see I have a basic
01:39 - I just rain Express generator so I have
01:41 - just an basic Express app haven't really
01:44 - done anything to it you're going to go
01:45 - npm install save send grid let's install
01:49 - send grid so that's going and then
01:51 - you're going to go to send grid.com
01:54 - and you're going to sign up for an
01:58 - account which won't even take your
02:00 - credit card information won't do
02:01 - anything if you are doing the try for
02:03 - free option so you're going to go ahead
02:05 - sign up for an account now one thing
02:06 - send grid does which might be why they
02:08 - don't go to spam as often is they have a
02:10 - person actually approve your account
02:13 - application I don't know what that
02:14 - person is looking for uh because all
02:17 - they really ask for is your name address
02:19 - and website um but when you sign up for
02:23 - that it will take up to six or seven
02:26 - hours I don't know it might take till
02:27 - the next day if it's overnight I did
02:30 - this yesterday um just so you know that
02:33 - I'm I'm not talking from past experience
02:35 - wh I deleted him I just yesterday
02:38 - created a new site added Mandel to it it
02:40 - went to spam took about five or maybe
02:43 - was more like 15 it was a while to to
02:45 - receive an email a lot longer than I
02:47 - wanted it to be uh and then I added srid
02:50 - right away as well srid did not go to
02:52 - spam and I got emails within 5 seconds
02:54 - so but it did take six or seven hours
02:56 - for them to provision my account um it
02:59 - says in Red Bar once you've logged in
03:02 - account is
03:03 - provisioning um you know you'll hear
03:05 - back soon so as soon as that provisioned
03:07 - I was good let's go show you how to
03:10 - install this and we'll be good so you go
03:12 - to npm send grid I just type Google for
03:15 - those npm send grid and this will give
03:18 - you kind of the easiest way to start
03:20 - with that
03:21 - package here's my index route so I guess
03:24 - I can go res. send
03:27 - okay boot at my app
03:30 - npm
03:32 - start okay so there I am I just have an
03:35 - okay route on the the
03:37 - homepage so let's go ahead and send my
03:39 - email when you log into the homepage so
03:42 - I'm pasting that
03:44 - in that's going to ask for my username
03:46 - and password that I created when I made
03:49 - my account so that's all that
03:52 - is um and then you just fill out this
03:54 - information so let's make this I don't
03:57 - want you to see my password
04:01 - so I actually set them in the process
