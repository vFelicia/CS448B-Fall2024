00:00 - so let's create a build system with
00:02 - grunt uh if you don't know what a build
00:04 - system is or missed my Spiel on what a
00:06 - build system is I'm going to put a link
00:07 - to that in the description and hopefully
00:10 - you've already watched the video on the
00:12 - basic introduction to node.js because
00:14 - that will be a requirement for this if
00:15 - you don't no node so that's also down
00:18 - there and let's go ahead and get started
00:19 - uh we're going to use grunt today to
00:22 - concatenate our JavaScript files um and
00:26 - uh we're also going to concatenate our
00:27 - CSS files and they're going to watch so
00:29 - it's going to do these whenever we save
00:31 - that's going to be our first step that
00:32 - we do um and so let's go ahead and get
00:35 - started the first thing we're going to
00:36 - do is run npm install DG for Global
00:41 - grunt CLI so grunt command line
00:44 - interface is what CLI is for so now
00:46 - everyone on the computer will have
00:48 - access to the grunt
00:50 - command uh and then we don't have a
00:53 - package Json started yet so I'm going to
00:55 - run npm in nit that's going to create a
00:57 - package Json for me I'm just going to
00:59 - say okay okay okay okay okay okay okay
01:01 - and there we go there's my package Json
01:04 - now I can't have this called grunt
01:05 - because I actually have to install the
01:07 - package called grunt here let me show
01:09 - you what happens if I go npm install DS
01:13 - to save grunt into my
01:15 - package grunt it's going to say refusing
01:18 - to install grunt as a dependency of
01:20 - itself so I'll call this grunt
01:23 - project save it and now I can run npm
01:26 - install s
01:27 - grunt there we go grunt is now installed
01:31 - I have node modules and grunt is there
01:34 - excellent so the only other thing I need
01:35 - to do is I need to create a grunt file.
01:39 - JS with a capital G I believe it has to
01:42 - have a capital G I believe so so when
01:45 - you run grunt it's going to Lo it's
01:47 - going to load the grunt file and that's
01:49 - pretty much all that happens so what we
01:52 - do if you remember from nodejs we're
01:54 - going to do a module.
01:56 - exorts equals function and function gets
01:58 - grunt
02:01 - and that's it for you and so now for our
02:05 - first action remember grunt is a task
02:07 - Runner so let's create some tasks to
02:10 - run register
02:13 - task and let's give it a name Let Me Go
02:16 - full screen here uh let's register a
02:18 - task called speak maybe and give it a
02:21 - function to run when you run the task
02:24 - speak uh we'll just console log I'm
02:28 - speaking there we go so now if I run
02:31 - grunt
02:34 - speak it's gonna say hey I'm speaking
02:37 - woohoo let's create another
02:39 - command register task
02:42 - yell I'm
02:46 - yelling so now if I run grunt speak it
02:50 - speaks and grunt yell I'm yelling there
02:53 - you go congratulations you've made your
02:54 - first two tasks now we all have all we
02:56 - have to do is make these tasks smarter
02:59 - um one other thing that you can do is
03:01 - you can go grunt register
03:05 - task um
03:07 - both and then I can give it an array Let
03:09 - Me Go full screen again so you can see
03:10 - it um and this will require run
03:14 - speak and
03:16 - yell so then it's going to run speak and
03:19 - yell so the both tasks will do both
03:20 - let's verify that that
03:22 - works grun both I'm speaking I'm yelling
03:26 - and also if you call this default
03:28 - whatever task you called default will
03:30 - run when you just run grunt so there we
03:33 - go grunt so that's how you R register
03:35 - tasks you do grunt. register task
03:38 - whatever's in the function gets fired
03:40 - when the task gets called so that's
03:42 - pretty basic nothing super smart going
03:44 - on now we have to do is let's load some
03:46 - common tasks uh that we're going to use
03:49 - um all the time and so to do this I'm
03:51 - going to go to the grunt website and
03:53 - look at the plugins what's awesome about
03:55 - grunt is not so much that grunt runs
03:57 - tasks but that it's got a build ion
04:00 - awesome awesome plugins to plug into it
04:03 - uh so grunt contrib concat is going to
04:05 - be the first one we look at we're going
04:06 - to concatenate files together and one
04:09 - thing with grunt you get good at is you
04:10 - get good at looking at um I'm actually
04:13 - going to look at this on GitHub might be
04:15 - a little more familiar you guys you get
04:17 - good at looking at readme files and
04:18 - figuring out what to do so I'm just
04:20 - going to scroll down I know where to go
04:21 - here um there's a grunt and knit config
04:25 - so here's kind of how these tasks work
04:28 - one you're going to install
04:30 - them there you go save Dev so let's go
04:33 - ahead and run this command to install
04:36 - it npm install we're installing Grunt
04:39 - contrib concat and we're going to save
04:41 - that as
04:43 - well that's installed and so now you can
04:46 - run this load tasks grunt contrib
04:50 - concat let's get rid of these
04:54 - guys now we're loading a task from our
04:57 - npm module and so at that that's going
04:59 - to do is that's going to look for
05:02 - preconfiguration on what our
05:03 - concatenations are going to be and so
05:07 - grunt is always going to load its
05:09 - configurations for your different tasks
05:11 - in the same place and that is called the
05:14 - grunt innit config it'll all make sense
05:17 - here in just a second here so I'm copy
05:18 - and pasting this so This Grunt and knit
05:21 - config object right here holds all of
05:24 - our configuration for all of our tasks
05:27 - um and all these grunt redefined tasks
05:30 - are going to look in that config uh to
05:33 - know what to do uh so let's get rid of
05:35 - this options here we don't need a
05:37 - separator so basically grun contri
05:40 - concat is going to look at the concat
05:43 - part of the object and that's going to
05:45 - know that the configuration for concat
05:48 - is in there and so we're going to call
05:49 - this action of concat disc you can call
05:51 - it whatever you want you can call it
05:53 - happy we'll call it dist for
05:56 - distribution and let's go Js what did I
05:59 - call these one and
06:03 - two Js one.
06:06 - Js js2 doj and we're going to do build
06:10 - usually things will be called build for
06:12 - a built for a built project or dist for
06:15 - a distribution so build I think is a
06:17 - little bit more popular and we'll just
06:20 - call it js. or we'll just call it
06:23 - scripts.js it's not Min because it's not
06:27 - been minified yet so there we go so now
06:30 - since I did load npm tasks I can run
06:34 - grunt concat because that's what the npm
06:37 - task for grunt concat
06:40 - is so I can now run grunt
06:44 - concat there you go and file build
06:48 - script.js wh that should be called
06:50 - scripts.js so there we go there's a
06:53 - build folder that appeared now and
06:55 - there's a script that's got both of my
06:56 - files in it and that's pretty much it
06:59 - that was really really easy uh so let's
07:02 - go and tweak some things let's go build
07:06 - jscripts going to delete that folder go
07:10 - away and then let's make one we'll call
07:13 - this
07:15 - JS and then let's make this one
07:19 - CSS and so now you'll go CSS what are
07:22 - these two called Main and
07:28 - theme Let's Go full screen again
07:32 - CSS theme.
07:34 - CSS and you will go build
07:38 - CSS um styles
07:40 - CSS there we go so once again uh my
07:44 - grunt canat command comes from this it's
07:47 - loading it from the npm module and so
07:51 - concat is going to look at this and it's
07:52 - automatically going to run everything in
07:54 - here when I run grunt concat let's run
07:56 - it again we created scripts.js and we
07:58 - created Style .js so now my build folder
08:00 - is looking a little bit different we've
08:02 - got styles that has all my Styles
08:05 - awesome I was now able to break these up
08:08 - and I've got JS which is my script so
08:10 - these are the two that I'm actually
08:11 - going to deploy so now let's go to the
08:13 - next level with this and let's watch my
08:15 - file system for changes I don't want to
08:17 - have to run grunt concat every time I
08:19 - want to just be able to save this file
08:21 - boom and have it automatically do some
08:24 - changes so for that plugin we are going
08:26 - to go back a few and that's just called
08:29 - grunt contrib
08:31 - watch load them back there we go grunt
08:34 - contrib watch the grunt contrib ones are
08:37 - the ones that are made by the uh
08:38 - contributors to Grunt and so those are
08:40 - always trusted plugins those are always
08:42 - going to be good ones we're going to run
08:44 - this command
08:46 - here like I said with grunt you get
08:48 - really good at reading read me files and
08:51 - then we're going to load npm task grunt
08:53 - contrib
08:54 - watch connect to my grunt
08:57 - file there we go
09:00 - and then here's our watch
09:03 - example and so with watch it's going to
09:06 - watch for file system
09:09 - changes um and when that happens you get
09:11 - to run tasks so let's go we'll just keep
09:13 - it J we'll call it JS and this will be
09:16 - called JS star star which means any
09:19 - folder star which means any file ending
09:22 - injs so any file ending injs that's in
09:25 - the JS directory uh that's not really
09:28 - fully necessary
09:29 - but I want a little bit more control cuz
09:31 - I'm a controlling person whenever that
09:34 - happens we're going to run
09:41 - concats and then we're also going to
09:43 - remove options
09:45 - spawn and so there we go that's our JS
09:49 - and then we'll also do a
09:52 - CSS CSS and that will also run concat
09:55 - con cat's really fast so I can run that
09:58 - every time so now you'll know notice
09:59 - something different when I run grunt
10:01 - watch it runs and it just stays there
10:04 - forever uh because it's actually sitting
10:07 - actively waiting for me to make some
10:08 - changes let me hit save here um okay
10:15 - okay
10:17 - and that didn't work because I must have
10:19 - something wrong in my Js file here so
10:22 - let's
10:26 - see oh I have two things called Js
10:29 - there's my problem this one was
10:31 - overriding this one happens all the time
10:33 - uh so I'm going to hit contrl C to
10:36 - cancel out of that let's run grunt watch
10:39 - again and hit save there we go file js.
10:44 - one. JS was changed and so it redid them
10:46 - both and now let's try saving a CSS file
10:50 - awesome same thing so if I change this
10:52 - background to
10:53 - Pink then my build CSS now has that as a
10:57 - background of pink awesome terrible idea
11:00 - but it's awesome um and you can also go
11:03 - like this I can just run concat js on
11:05 - that let me cancel that and start that
11:08 - up again so now when I run JS it's only
11:11 - going to run the concat JS thing you'll
11:13 - notice it did not create a Styles CSS
11:17 - again it just
11:18 - created uh the JavaScript because it
11:21 - only ran this portion and so that's kind
11:24 - of why you'll give them a name so you
11:25 - can actually refer to portions of a task
11:29 - by
11:29 - name this will be concat CSS so the last
11:33 - things last thing I'm going to do is I'm
11:34 - going to go
11:36 - grunt
11:37 - register task
11:41 - default and this will run um this will
11:44 - run
11:46 - concats and this will run
11:50 - watch here we go let me zoom out so you
11:53 - can see that so I added a default task
11:55 - as well there and so once that's saved I
11:59 - can now cancel out of that and I can
12:01 - just run Grunt and that will start off
12:04 - doing the build right away uh which is
12:06 - good because we'll want to build it
12:07 - before we run our server the first time
12:09 - and now it's running watch as well so
12:11 - our build folder
12:13 - exists and we are now watching these for
12:15 - changes so if I get rid of the both of
12:17 - those
12:18 - okays it changes my scripts JS and it'll
12:22 - also build out my CSS let's go back to
12:25 - Red because pink is a terrible idea so
12:28 - there you go that your introduction to
12:29 - grunt hope you liked it and we'll get
12:33 - into the next part of our build in the
12:34 - next video
12:37 - bye
