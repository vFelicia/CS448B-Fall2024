00:00 - out to do web development in the
previous tutorial we covered
00:04 - basic HTML how to put together HTML
00:07 - page we learned how to do tags: opening
and closing tags
00:11 - we learned kinda what some others
popular tag names are
00:14 - lastly there's only ten or fifteen you
actually need to know anyway
00:18 - so hopefully by now you've taken that
course and you're comfortable
00:22 - I was kinda writing out basic HTML tags
00:25 - this should look decently familiar to
you if not go back to the last video
00:29 - and get comfortable I promise it won't
take very long there's
00:32 - only a few tags you have to learn and it
really feels weird at first if you're
00:37 - not used to writing anything that feels like
code
00:39 - but I promise it comes very quickly you
won't be confused for long
00:43 - so I've done years I've taken a modified
my example from the last video
00:48 - and now have my html with a header
00:51 - and a body and in that body I have
header one which has my website
00:55 - I've got an unordered list with a link
to three different pages
00:59 - and I've got I also a little bit of content
01:02 - you notice this tag up here. I left this out
in the last example cuz it didn't
01:06 - really apply to learning basic HTML tags
01:09 - but we're gonna add this at the top
every HTML page
01:13 - and this just declares that the document
type: is HTML
01:16 - and putting like this actually means
html5 so
01:20 - it all you need to know is that it needs
to be there at this point
01:23 - it basically tells your browser a
working with an html5 page
01:27 - what I did then as I created a new page
01:31 - called page 2 dot html and I saved it
in the same folder
01:34 - that I created another page called page
3 dot html and it's also in the same folder
01:39 - you can see here I didn't include a full
01:42 - http:// WWW dot
01:45 - my website dot com all I did is put a
it's called a relative link
01:50 - if you don't put that full thing it
looks starting in the same folder that
01:55 - you're in now
01:55 - and the reason we called our first page
index is because
01:59 - index is what its automatically going to
look like look at when you load a web
02:04 - site if you go to Google dot com
02:05 - a you know there can be some
configuration changed
02:09 - to make it different but by default a
website is going to look for
02:13 - index dot HTML so one thing I changed
here is the first /li
02:18 - if it's on the page that you're on now
there's not going to be an  tag
02:22 - Because if we're on home we don't have to go to
Home were already there so as you can
02:25 - see on home this is not a link
02:27 - page two and three are linked and I can
go to page to you
02:30 - and it loads page to you and now home
02:34 - and page 3 our link because home is
going
02:37 - index and three is going to page three
so I can now navigate between
02:42 - all three pages of my website..see it's not
too bad
02:45 - I basically have a website it's up and
running it's just
02:49 - ugly because there's no style so let's
get into how to add style to your
02:54 - webpage
02:54 - I've saved a file called main dot CSS
02:58 - and a CSS stylesheet is how we do
styling
03:02 - And it basically works like this: you have a
selector
03:06 - which is where we take up something
we're going to add style to
03:10 - and then you have a rule the selector
basically as brackets
03:14 - anything within those brackets gets
applied to the selector so the rule
03:18 - you have the property that you wanna
change in the value wanna give it
03:22 - and then you've got a colon and an there's 
a semi-colon this'll probably be the
03:26 - weirdest part about CSS is getting
comfortable
03:29 - going selector open some brackets
03:32 - go back go up property collin
03:36 - value semi-colon probably looks weird
feels like it's a lot to memorize
03:41 - its gonna come really fast type your
selector
03:44 - open some brackets take a property pick
a value for
03:47 - you're done so in this case we picked
body so
03:51 - anything within the body is now going to
get a background
03:55 - of 999 and we'll get into this a little bit
later but for now
03:58 - that just means a background of gray say
what will make it black
04:02 - well make it read for now that's a
little easier to understand
04:05 - so the body now gets a background thread
knows when I refresh
04:09 - nothing happens because this style sheet
is not attached
04:13 - at all to my page so there's two ways
you can get style
04:17 - to your page you can start by just going
style
04:21 - and add style tag
04:24 - and will make sure we at this attribute: type
04:27 - equals text slash CSS because we're
doing
04:30 - CSS style and now I can go body
04:35 - background
04:38 - Nope, not bottom
04:41 - red it save hey check it out there you
go so you're thinking
04:46 - why would I not clearly do it this way
this is
04:49 - much easier but what if we want to type
in a 150 different rules
04:54 - and we want to be shared between all our
pages on now either have to copy paste
04:58 - or you put them in a separate file which
is what we're gonna do here
05:02 - we put background red in here and now we
can link to it
05:08 - going to do a link and this href is
going to be
05:15 - I'm going to link two styles main dot
CSS
05:20 - and I need to do rel=stylesheet
05:29 - and basically what that tells it is I'm
giving you a link
05:32 - to a style sheet and we can also add
type equals
05:35 - text slash CSS most new browsers don't
need that
05:39 - some old browsers are going to so now
we've done is we've got at this link and
05:43 - now all I have to do is add
05:45 - this link to each page and each page
05:49 - is now going to get all the styles that
I put in main.CSS
05:53 - so you see as I navigate every page
background is hideous red
05:57 - I'm going to change that to a slightly
more pleasant color
06:01 - 999 which is kind of a grayish color
06:04 - it's now we can add some more styles
let's say we want to make our headers
06:09 - a better font actually let's make the
whole body a different font
06:14 - fonts family
06:19 - Ariel that's a little bit cleaner
looking
06:22 - now the font family is Arial now CSS is
where you get into
06:26 - a decent bit more memorization there's
only about
06:30 - 10 or 15 HTML tags you use there's a lotta
CSS properties that you can adjust
06:35 - because as you can imagine
06:37 - every ounce of style but the whole page
has is coming from the CSS properties
06:42 - so it's just gonna take you a little
while
06:46 - you wanna start off with some things
that are more comfortable and work your
06:49 - way up
06:50 - there's not it's not an endless black
box there's an end to it
06:54 - it probably will only take you a few
weeks and all of the sudden you realize wow
06:58 - there are no more CSS properties that I
don't know
07:01 - it's just a long few weeks have learning
so definitely give yourselves a little
07:06 - bit I'm
07:07 - have patience and it will come very
quickly but first your gonna feel like
07:11 - you're just completely drowning
07:13 - in the ability to not do anything that
you want to do
07:18 - but we're gonna show you a little bit
more about selectors here real quick so
07:22 - here's how you..I've shown you how to grab
things by tagname
07:26 - that's what we did here we just created
a tag name: body
07:29 - usually you don't do that to too often
07:32 - you'll do it for body you'll do for h1
so I'll go h1
07:39 - I'm gonna go color and this will be like
a
07:43 - 333 color
07:47 - and now you'll notice my h1 got just a
little bit lighter let's change a little bit
07:50 - more 2666
07:52 - all the "mark of the beast" jokes are coming up
07:55 - basically if you go all the way to 000
you're a black
08:00 - go all the way up to you 999 you're at a
gray
08:03 - and anything in between is kinda well
and between something like that 555
08:08 - but also a fist fight to any each to use
some going to do h1
08:13 - common H to you and now you'll notice my
h2
08:16 - also has a gray color
08:19 - I can also make this PL on any my
paragraphs have a psych make this any
08:23 - allies on May ally status I could make
this any A's on
08:26 - a stab this and now I've styled
everything
08:29 - with a color 555 I don't eighties to do
that though so maybe I'll make my
08:34 - A's a different color later on let's
make my
08:37 - A's a little different color
08:41 - blue ago act
08:44 - green everything's green
08:49 - area everything's blue I want to change
it up a little bit
08:52 - so now we have every page is inheriting
the styles
08:56 - so it's starting to look just a little
bit better up so let's go ahead and add
09:01 - maybe a couple more styles here
09:04 - let's give paragraphs a background color
09:12 - let's make our paragraphs color
09:16 - whites yeah that spill nice
09:20 - I'm going to go and take PL this cuz I
don't wanna target my P's anymore
09:26 - and now we want to add just a little bit
of padding to it see how this is like
09:30 - completely cramped
09:31 - we want that paragraph to have a little
bit more padding so that's call patty
09:36 - and here you get to define unsafe I
pixels
09:40 - so now you notice to put five picks a
padding on all sides
09:43 - make it a little bit more
09:47 - 10 pics patting their ego and say just
want to be on the top and the bottom
09:51 - which you can actually do is if you do
one value gets applied to all sides
09:55 - if UT two values then it goes top bottom
09:59 - left-right Sun ap I say 10 pixels era
pixels
10:03 - top bottom half 10 left-right have not
10:06 - well the right goes all the way cuz it's
filling up page
10:09 - that's something we can address later if
you do four values
10:13 - then you're doing one for each side so
I'm going it goes like this:
10:18 - if I go one value and it does all
10:22 - ID to you
10:25 - it's going top bottom left right
10:29 - if I do four that kinda goes around
clockwise just like a clock starts at
10:33 - the top
10:34 - top bright bottom left
10:37 - so I can actually add four things
younger 10 pixels
10:41 - 10 pixels 0 pixels on the bottom and 0
pixels on the left
10:45 - so now I have patting year had here
which can't quite see
10:49 - because once my text gets over there
you'd be able to see it
10:52 - and I got some there for now was gonna
go 10 pixels on all sides
10:57 - and call it a day so now any paragraph I
add
11:00 - on nemi pages is going to get a book our
gray background
11:04 - white text and a nice little padding
their hey let's experiment just to find
11:08 - out
11:12 - at there some more page to content it's
nice
11:15 - everything I get throughout my entire
site every paragraph is gonna have a
11:18 - lovely little look
11:20 - but say my HQ I'm gonna leave that right
where it is
11:27 - so this is kinda basically how we're
gonna style some things let's say we
11:29 - want just this one paragraph
11:32 - have a different color to it what do we
do that we want to give it what's
11:36 - considered a class
11:38 - yes I know we're not supposed to have
upper lower class and the classes are
11:41 - bad but in this case
11:42 - that's just what we're gonna call it
class
11:47 - I secondary
11:50 - let's do that class secondary right now
nothing changed
11:54 - but now I can add a rule targeting class
secondary
11:59 - and I'm gonna add a dot the dot means
I'm looking for class
12:04 - so I thing I put in here on our override
12:08 - what I put in there
12:14 - I'm gonna go background:none
12:18 - and this colors gonna be
12:21 - let's make this a little bit have a more
greyed out color
12:24 - let's see if that happens 555 there you
go it's actually make it even more great
12:28 - out some subs
12:29 - on barrio so now I have
12:33 - any paragraph gets this and anything
with the class
12:36 - secondary it's that because we specified
a class
12:40 - a class is now more specific
12:46 - if you'll notice even if I put secondary
be four
12:50 - usually what happens by the way with CSS
rules is what comes after is gonna
12:54 - override
12:55 - so if I had another p we're all here and
this background is red
13:01 - now this is overriding this because it
happened
13:04 - after that's why it's called cascading
style sheets
13:07 - kinda cascades it can get defined appear
13:10 - but you can override it as you move on
13:14 - so what we've done now as you notice
class
13:18 - does not get overridden because class is
considered more
13:21 - specific its and issue up specificity
13:27 - so now secondaries get no background and
they get a color
13:31 - 777 another way that you can target
things
13:34 - oh yes and a nice thing about classes
can apply to multiple things
13:39 - they can apply to you this I can also
make
13:42 - this paragraph have a class secondary as
well
13:47 - so now they both have secondary I can
also make this /li right here at a class
13:51 - secondary
13:52 - and tickets great out as well it applies
to anything that you
13:56 - at the Class two another way that you
can make a very specific issue
14:02 - in targeting is by ID
14:10 - ID equal special the difference between
ID in class
14:14 - as you can only have one ID per page so
I can only have one thing
14:18 - that's called special on the page I
cannot create
14:21 - two things with an idea special you're
breaking the rules
14:25 - so I can say secondary has that's copy
paste here
14:32 - and now there's something with an idea
special and this background will be read
14:36 - because after all its special
14:41 - and now there you go so each page can
have one thing called special
14:45 - but they can have as many things called
secondary as they want
14:49 - usually you know you wanna class things
more than you want to I D things ID is
14:54 - only is something very specific
14:57 - and you know for sure there's only going
to be one
15:00 - a common occurrence that is ID equals
navigation
15:04 - there's usually only one primary
navigation on the page
15:08 - so in this case I I kid
15:12 - make my you l have an idea nap and
that's the kind of thing that you're
15:16 - usually
15:17 - use an ID for I ID's are a little bit
faster
15:21 - as far as if you have a thousand rules
ID's are going to be a little bit faster
15:25 - after your web page to appear other
classes are going to be a little bit
15:29 - slower
15:30 - usually really are not going to notice
though unless you get tons and tons and
15:34 - tons and tons and tons
15:35 - CSS classes so years kinda how we
basically
15:39 - style at a web page in our next video
we're going to cover
15:42 - some more advanced CSS rules
