00:00 - hey there we are on the home stretch of
00:02 - how to build a website from the very
00:03 - beginning we've gotten a long ways and
00:05 - we're going to get a lot of the wrap-up
00:06 - work done in this video now if you've
00:08 - missed any of the videos before i'm
00:10 - going to put a link in the description
00:11 - to the whole playlist so in this video
00:13 - we're dealing with images and i've
00:15 - specifically left images and content out
00:18 - because so much of web development has
00:20 - already happened it happens in the
00:22 - layout all of web development or all of
00:24 - html and css development should i say
00:27 - is layout and then content that goes in
00:29 - those layout blocks so we've done the
00:31 - layout we've done a lot of the hard work
00:33 - already and it might not look like much
00:35 - but we've gotten a lot of the website
00:36 - done already so there's two ways we're
00:38 - going to add images into this to really
00:40 - take it a long way and make it look like
00:42 - a complete website so the two ways you
00:44 - add images is by simply adding an img
00:46 - tag which instead of adding an h1 with
00:49 - text will add an image with a picture in
00:51 - it the img tag is used when you want to
00:54 - add an image that's actually considered
00:56 - a part of content so instead of
00:58 - inserting text i would insert an image
01:01 - that is considered a piece of the
01:02 - article so to speak
01:04 - the other main way that you actually use
01:05 - way more often is using css to add a
01:08 - background image to things so in this
01:10 - case for this header which is this black
01:13 - box here i'd use css to make a
01:15 - background image on that whole header
01:16 - it's not considered a part of the
01:18 - content it's a part of the design which
01:20 - is why you use it a whole lot more
01:21 - because web pages
01:23 - in terms of images are way more design
01:25 - than content
01:26 - so those are the two ways we're going to
01:27 - get into and this video might be a
01:29 - little bit longer because there's a lot
01:30 - of dialogue there's a lot more that i
01:32 - want to describe as i'm going
01:34 - to teach you how to use images
01:36 - appropriately in your web pages so stay
01:38 - tuned there's a lot of great information
01:39 - in this one
01:41 - but first we need some images to do that
01:42 - i looked up artisan bakery and lo and
01:44 - behold there's one in edwardsville
01:46 - illinois
01:47 - so we're going to snatch some images for
01:48 - this to use on our website which is not
01:50 - legal to do but for practicing and
01:53 - developing at home it's a great idea
01:54 - basically just right click on any image
01:57 - save image as so find any images you
01:59 - like right click on an image save image
02:02 - as so i've saved some images here let's
02:04 - go ahead and close that out
02:06 - i'm in free promo for you artisan bakery
02:08 - um and so i've got an images folder now
02:10 - that's important to know where you put
02:12 - those images just like referencing css
02:14 - you've got to reference the images where
02:16 - they are so images slash and then here's
02:18 - all my images i got a logo which is a
02:20 - png pngs are great because they can be
02:22 - transparent as you can see the
02:24 - background is showing through and then
02:26 - i've got a hero i'm going to use this
02:27 - for the banner here then i've got goods
02:29 - coffee and breads and i'm going to use
02:31 - those in these blocks here and i think
02:32 - i'm going to turn them into circles so
02:34 - there's my images let me go close that
02:36 - folder view out and the breads
02:39 - and so let's go and get started let's
02:40 - start up here with the header i'm going
02:41 - to make a menu add a logo here in the
02:43 - middle then i'm going to make a
02:45 - background image up here this is going
02:46 - to be using our first method which is
02:48 - css for background images so the first
02:52 - thing i'm going to do here is i'm going
02:53 - to right in the middle put the logo i'm
02:55 - going to add an li with an a tag
02:58 - and i'm also going to make this an a tag
03:00 - because i want when you click on the
03:01 - logo for it to go to the home page
03:03 - that's kind of a normal thing to do
03:06 - you want that logo to always take you
03:07 - home and i'm going to add a title here
03:09 - i'm going to say artisan
03:10 - bakery
03:12 - logo
03:14 - so there we go that is now going to add
03:15 - a link up there
03:17 - which needs to be a logo and i
03:18 - intentionally added this text here
03:20 - because it's a good idea again to always
03:23 - make it semantic it should read like
03:24 - what it actually is and the reason
03:26 - that's important is because there's a
03:28 - lot of people out there that are
03:29 - visually impaired visually disabled and
03:31 - they're going to use screen readers to
03:33 - visit your website and they can fully
03:35 - browse the internet with a screen reader
03:37 - as long as the web developers do it
03:39 - semantically correct
03:41 - nobody wants to be that jerk that builds
03:43 - a business a building that doesn't have
03:45 - a wheelchair ramp right and you don't
03:47 - want to be the jerk that builds a
03:48 - website that people can't view with a
03:50 - screen reader when they're visually
03:51 - disabled or impaired because you just
03:53 - didn't take the time to add in a couple
03:55 - little little text elements so as you
03:58 - can see just by reading this it doesn't
03:59 - matter how it looks i know that this is
04:01 - the logo and it's going to take me to
04:02 - the home page so now i can go over to
04:05 - css and actually turn this into a pretty
04:07 - logo
04:08 - first of all i'm going to add a class
04:11 - logo
04:12 - so header class logo can now be targeted
04:16 - there's the logo and there's the a tag
04:18 - inside of the logo li
04:20 - and let me give this thing a background
04:22 - color
04:23 - of red i always like to give it a
04:24 - background color when i'm working with
04:25 - something just so i can see what that
04:27 - box is doing i'm going to give it a
04:29 - width of 300
04:30 - and this will do nothing because it's
04:33 - display inline by default i need to
04:35 - change this to display
04:38 - inline block and now boom 300 wide and
04:41 - then i can also give it a height here
04:43 - let's go like 80 pixels
04:46 - and now that that's going i can get rid
04:48 - of this text a little trick that you can
04:50 - use to get rid of text is called text
04:52 - indent
04:53 - and then since it's display block i can
04:56 - tell the text to just kind of go way far
04:58 - left so i'm going to go negative 999
05:00 - pixels and that's going boom way off the
05:03 - screen to where no one will ever see it
05:05 - uh what's great about this is again it's
05:07 - semantically correct you can read that
05:09 - it's a link and you can read that the
05:11 - link text says artisan bakery logo but
05:13 - you're never going to see it so now that
05:15 - that's there i can add a background
05:17 - image now before i add a background
05:19 - image let me describe a little bit more
05:20 - of what this background property does
05:22 - this is actually shorthand
05:24 - if you'll remember margin is shorthand
05:26 - for
05:28 - margin top margin right margin bottom
05:30 - margin left you can actually add a bunch
05:32 - of things in there
05:33 - background is the same way it's
05:35 - background color
05:37 - uh background image uh repeat it just
05:40 - keeps going so if you're gonna do
05:42 - anything more than color or image
05:44 - then i like to use the actual broken out
05:47 - ones background color
05:49 - red and that's gonna do the exact same
05:51 - thing just like you can break out margin
05:52 - right margin top you can break out
05:54 - background and there are a lot of
05:56 - options you can see if i just do that
05:58 - there's a lot of options here that i can
06:00 - use for background so let's go
06:01 - background image and let's go url which
06:04 - means we're going to pull in an image
06:07 - and then i open and close the
06:08 - parentheses now in quotes in here i just
06:10 - go pick my image
06:12 - images logo.png
06:14 - and boom i got my logo in there awesome
06:17 - and i also got rid of the background
06:18 - color now you can notice that this logo
06:20 - is a lot bigger than i actually want it
06:22 - to display this is the first important
06:24 - thing about images on the web make your
06:26 - images double the size and then shrink
06:29 - them down to the size you want inside
06:31 - the browser this is simply because not
06:34 - all devices have the same pixel
06:36 - resolution i don't know if you follow
06:37 - the tech specs on new iphones and stuff
06:40 - like that but they're always trying to
06:41 - cram as many more pixels onto the screen
06:43 - as possible to make it as smooth and as
06:45 - detailed as it can possibly be
06:47 - so when the web started out monitors
06:49 - used to be 72 pixels per inch and now
06:51 - they're up in the hundreds 140s 180s i
06:54 - forget what the latest ones are because
06:55 - i don't really care that much
06:57 - but if you display
06:59 - something that's 300 pixels at 72 pixels
07:02 - per inch on a latest greatest iphone
07:05 - it's going to look fuzzy and blurry
07:07 - because that iphone is going to have to
07:08 - kind of
07:09 - size that image up so how you get around
07:11 - this is you make the image twice as
07:13 - large as you want and then size it back
07:16 - down that way it looks crisp and clear
07:18 - on the latest greatest iphone the latest
07:19 - greatest macbook screen and it also
07:21 - looks crisp and clear on an older 72
07:24 - pixel per inch monitor so to do this we
07:26 - simply say background size
07:28 - 300 pixels and that's going to
07:30 - automatically apply to the width the
07:32 - height will be taken care of
07:33 - automatically great
07:35 - and then if i also were to bump this
07:37 - height up to 90 you'd see we got a
07:38 - little problem here it's automatically
07:40 - looping that logo let me make it 190.
07:43 - you can see that logo is just going to
07:44 - loop and loop and loop so we want to do
07:46 - background repeats
07:48 - none or no repeat no dash repeat
07:51 - you would think it would be none but
07:52 - it's no dash repeat
07:54 - so there we go now it doesn't loop at
07:56 - all and i can change this height to go
07:58 - back to
07:59 - 80 pixels which is pretty much where i
08:01 - want it to be
08:02 - one more thing that i want to do is i
08:03 - want to actually tell this thing i want
08:04 - to hack the way that this thing displays
08:06 - and i want to make it display up a
08:08 - little bit so this arrow will line up
08:10 - with all of my text links so the way i
08:12 - can do that is i can go to top
08:15 - and i can say hey your top actually
08:17 - needs to start at negative 40 pixels
08:20 - but when i save it nothing happens so if
08:22 - i want that display to actually go up
08:24 - from the top i have a little trick that
08:26 - i have to do i have to go position
08:29 - relative
08:31 - and that's going to say hey now i can
08:32 - kind of adjust my box relative to the
08:35 - guys that i'm sitting in line with so if
08:37 - i give it a position relative now i can
08:39 - move the top and say hey my top actually
08:41 - starts 40 pixels above everybody else's
08:44 - without position relative you're going
08:45 - to be frustrated because top will never
08:47 - work position relative is just this
08:49 - little hack this little thing with css
08:51 - you have to know if you ever want to
08:52 - manually adjust
08:54 - where the box begins
08:56 - so 40 pixels looks like a little too
08:58 - much let's try 30 pixels boom looking
09:00 - excellent okay there we have our logo
09:02 - you can see that as we size left and
09:04 - right that all looks good i do want to
09:06 - make this centered though so on the
09:07 - header i'm going to make it text align
09:11 - center
09:12 - so now at this point it should always be
09:14 - nice and centered on our page yay no
09:16 - matter what device loads this up whether
09:18 - it's a big screen whether it's a small
09:20 - screen about the only thing that
09:21 - probably looks bad is a mobile screen
09:23 - yeah mobile looks stupid you always have
09:25 - to take some steps to make sure mobile
09:27 - looks good and we will get to those in
09:29 - the next video
09:30 - but for now that is looking nice okay
09:33 - moving on we've got our header going
09:34 - it's looking nice let's go and add a
09:36 - background image to really wrap up this
09:38 - header i like for my headers to be the
09:41 - tall ones that have that hero image type
09:43 - of thing so instead of 100 pixel height
09:46 - let's make it a 400 pixel height let me
09:48 - also alphabetize this didn't quite
09:50 - alphabetize that correctly h i j k l m n
09:53 - o p there you go and that's good let's
09:55 - get rid of this home h1 and just add a
09:57 - nice big hero image in there
10:01 - and so the hero image is going to be
10:02 - done exactly the same way background
10:05 - image and i'm going to leave that
10:06 - background color because as the website
10:08 - loads up if you happen to be on a slower
10:10 - internet connection i like seeing that
10:12 - black box to say hey this is kind of a
10:14 - section so that way you kind of get a
10:15 - sense of the layout while it's loading a
10:18 - background image url let's go images
10:21 - hero oh nice it's already selected
10:23 - hero.jpg
10:24 - and boom we've got our hero image again
10:26 - it's a lot bigger than we want it to be
10:29 - so let's go to background size and
10:32 - instead of a pixel i'm going to say 100
10:34 - i always want it to be 100 of the width
10:37 - so now that as the devices are grown
10:40 - let's say you view it on a tablet
10:42 - horizontally or view it on a huge screen
10:44 - it's always going to fill out a hundred
10:45 - percent uh that works although defaults
10:48 - the background position is gonna be the
10:50 - top you notice that we always are seeing
10:51 - the top as the screen gets really really
10:54 - big so instead i'm actually gonna say
10:56 - background position center
11:01 - and now it'll always stay centered as
11:03 - you get on a really big screen you get
11:04 - this nice little oatmeal loafy thing so
11:08 - that's always going to look good again
11:09 - on mobile it's probably not going to
11:11 - look right yep on mobile you can see
11:13 - it's repeating repeating repeating
11:14 - that's because this really shouldn't be
11:16 - 400 pixels tall on mobile again we'll
11:18 - deal with it in the next video when we
11:20 - deal with responsive design so boom
11:23 - there's our header that's how you do
11:24 - background images in css
11:27 - really you just want to make sure those
11:28 - images are always a lot bigger and then
11:29 - you scale them back down so next up
11:32 - we're going to go and add actual img
11:35 - tags down here because these are kind of
11:36 - a part of the content they're part of
11:38 - the article so let's go over to the html
11:42 - we have a section class equals features
11:45 - and then we have three divs in here so
11:46 - i'm going to change these let's get rid
11:48 - of them to insert an image you just do
11:50 - an img tag and there's really really
11:53 - easy to work with you just add a source
11:55 - images slash breads
11:58 - and boom it's inserted these are 400 by
12:01 - 400 i crop them down in photoshop you
12:03 - can use your favorite image editor to do
12:05 - that
12:06 - they're 400 by 400 because i want them
12:08 - to show as 200 by 200
12:11 - amazing
12:12 - fresh
12:13 - baked bread
12:16 - you're going to add an alt tag for two
12:17 - reasons whenever you add an image one it
12:19 - allows screen readers to kind of get a
12:21 - description to the visually impaired of
12:23 - what that image is showing and two it
12:25 - also allows google and search engines to
12:28 - properly index your page if your page
12:30 - has a lot of images like a good website
12:32 - should
12:34 - there's not a lot of words for google to
12:35 - pick up on so this basically provides
12:37 - words to the image
12:39 - so your website will be easier to show
12:42 - up on search engines we'll have an
12:43 - easier time showing up on search engines
12:46 - now in this case we're going to add a
12:48 - caption as well you can add a caption
12:49 - two ways you could add an h4 or a p tag
12:52 - or something and say fresh baked bread
12:56 - and that's going to show up there and
12:57 - then we can use css to move it around
12:59 - but whenever you have an image and a
13:01 - caption that goes with it the more
13:03 - technically correct way to do it is to
13:05 - add a figure
13:07 - tag which is an html5
13:10 - semantic tag it's just like section or
13:12 - header or nav it doesn't do anything it
13:14 - basically acts like a div
13:17 - but it basically tells us more
13:18 - semantically what's going on a figure
13:20 - tag expects two things to be inside of
13:22 - it an img tag
13:25 - and also
13:26 - let's go to them and also a fig caption
13:31 - a fig caption tag right there the fig
13:33 - caption is basically our caption so
13:35 - let's cut this out
13:37 - paste it in there
13:39 - and we're done you can see that also
13:40 - kind of lays out more like divs layout
13:43 - so there's our first one let's copy and
13:45 - paste
13:46 - and copy and paste so this will be
13:49 - coffee
13:50 - we'll just call it fresh baked coffee
13:54 - just be lazy for now and then we'll call
13:56 - this i don't know it's not gourmet
13:58 - coffee these days right because that's
13:59 - like what they marketed to our parents
14:01 - uh what is it like artisan coffee now
14:04 - everything's artisan
14:05 - um home
14:07 - it's not brewed roasted home roasted
14:09 - coffee right that's what everybody does
14:12 - they roast it in house so we got our
14:14 - home roasted coffee boom oh that's
14:16 - lovely and then we also have goods
14:20 - market market goods
14:24 - home goods sure whatever and
14:28 - goods market man i don't even know what
14:30 - you say with this market sure that's
14:32 - gonna work we got our goods market so
14:34 - now with a couple css rules here we can
14:36 - make this look really nice let's go over
14:38 - to our style css you can see it's doing
14:40 - all sorts of crazy stuff
14:42 - and the reason it's doing that is
14:44 - because there's basically no styles
14:45 - attached to it so this section will make
14:47 - that features i think i called it
14:49 - features yeah class equals features
14:51 - that's this whole section here
14:54 - uh features has padding it has display
14:56 - flex it has a flex direction a
14:58 - background of white good good good
14:59 - that's what we want it has a color of
15:00 - gray that's why this is getting a color
15:02 - of gray
15:03 - and instead of all divs we want features
15:06 - figure
15:08 - those will get a width of 100 pixels
15:11 - a background of blue
15:13 - we don't really want that anymore let's
15:14 - get rid of the background blue and the
15:16 - margin auto which makes them
15:17 - automatically lay out nicely now we're
15:19 - getting some overflow here because this
15:20 - has a width of 100 pixels and we're
15:22 - putting 400 pixel images into it so
15:24 - they're just kind of bleeding over into
15:26 - their neighbors
15:27 - so now we can do is actually add some
15:29 - style to those images
15:31 - fig features
15:33 - figure
15:34 - image img let's give them a width of
15:39 - let's go 200 pixels i think 100 is going
15:42 - to be too small
15:44 - so 200 pixels boom looking nice laying
15:46 - out nicely and i also want them to be
15:48 - circles and a fun little trick you can
15:49 - do to make them circles is give them a
15:51 - border
15:52 - radius if you give them a border radius
15:55 - of 10 pixels they have rounded corners
15:57 - see that nice little rounded corners but
15:58 - if you give them a border race of 50
16:00 - percent
16:02 - well that's basically what it takes to
16:03 - make it a circle the radius goes 50
16:05 - percent and then 50 percent and ta-da so
16:08 - now they're lovely little circles uh
16:10 - let's make the figures have
16:12 - a text a line
16:16 - of center sorry kind of stumbled and
16:18 - stammered there a little bit
16:20 - um and as i'm throwing these things out
16:21 - there you might not know all these css
16:24 - properties right so i might use things
16:26 - like text align or text indent
16:28 - and you don't have to freak out like
16:30 - you're not some real developer when you
16:32 - see a css property you've never seen
16:34 - before
16:35 - there's tons of css properties out there
16:37 - some that you hardly ever use and most
16:39 - of them that are your bread and butter
16:40 - you use them all day every day you can
16:42 - see even as i'm building out this
16:43 - website i keep coming back to the same
16:46 - things over and over again width and
16:48 - margin and background and color and
16:50 - padding that's most of what you use and
16:52 - every so often you'll run across a css
16:54 - property you're like what the heck is
16:56 - this and then you google it and you find
16:57 - out what it is that doesn't mean you're
16:58 - not a developer
17:00 - oftentimes if you haven't used a certain
17:02 - property for six months or a year you're
17:04 - going to forget about it anyway so
17:06 - googling and learning and forgetting and
17:08 - remembering that's just a part of being
17:09 - a web developer so don't be intimidated
17:11 - as i'm throwing out these properties
17:13 - like text indent that you might not have
17:15 - seen before it doesn't mean you're an
17:16 - idiot well you may be an idiot i just i
17:18 - don't know that for sure so um moving on
17:21 - uh let's make a little bit of design
17:23 - here to make this look prettier i'm
17:24 - gonna give it a little bit of a shadow
17:26 - just a really subtle shadow and also a
17:28 - border that's kind of a nice way to make
17:30 - images that are circles look good
17:32 - the way you do a shadow is box shadow
17:35 - and box shadow takes four properties it
17:37 - takes the color let's just say black for
17:39 - now
17:40 - and then it takes the offset of
17:42 - horizontal let's say 10 pixels
17:44 - horizontally 10 pixels vertically that
17:47 - might be vertical and horizontal i
17:48 - always forget which order and then how
17:51 - wide that shadow is a 10 pixel shadow so
17:53 - you can see that offset at 10 pixels
17:55 - offset at 10 pixels and then it's 10
17:57 - pixels worth of blur well we don't
17:59 - actually want that offset let's just go
18:01 - zero and zero
18:02 - and so now it stays right behind it and
18:04 - it's just got that lovely little 10
18:06 - pixels of blur i'm gonna change that
18:08 - color to gray
18:11 - change that color to gray it's a very
18:13 - subtle shadow now but just enough to
18:15 - give it a little pop that we want uh one
18:17 - thing that bad designers do is they
18:18 - almost always way over blow stuff 50
18:21 - pixels in black they almost always make
18:23 - stuff look just ridiculous
18:25 - so to be a good designer it's all about
18:27 - subtle subtle little things
18:30 - uh let's also give it just a border
18:33 - of one pixel solid
18:36 - white so that way we're gonna have this
18:38 - tiny little white border that goes on
18:40 - with that tiny little gray shadow behind
18:42 - it i don't know it just has a little
18:44 - subtle look to it you can tweak on this
18:45 - stuff forever and come up with really
18:48 - really cool looks but that's good enough
18:49 - for now i think the last thing i'm going
18:51 - to do is i'm going to make that figure
18:53 - caption have a little bit of text to it
18:55 - which i can actually just apply these
18:57 - rules straight to the figure
18:59 - let's see let's do a text transform
19:04 - of uppercase
19:05 - so it's all uppercase ta-da it's better
19:08 - to do this in css than to actually do it
19:10 - in the html because you're not shouting
19:12 - at people right you're not going fresh
19:14 - baked bread you know you're actually
19:16 - saying fresh baked bread
19:18 - you just want it to design-wise have
19:21 - caps so that's the way to do that
19:23 - and wow i think we're looking pretty
19:25 - darn good here i don't really like that
19:28 - gray color i think that should be
19:29 - something else but i'm going to leave it
19:30 - for now that could be tweaked on let's
19:32 - just kind of give this footer a little
19:34 - something and we are done we kind of
19:36 - have a design here so obviously if i was
19:38 - laying out the rest of this webpage i'd
19:39 - have two or three sections maybe one
19:41 - with our specials one to you know sign
19:43 - up for our email list stuff like that
19:45 - but it's all the exact same thing you're
19:47 - adding content you're adding images
19:50 - nothing too crazy
19:52 - so let's just say i don't know one two
19:54 - three main street
19:56 - and then what are we edwardsville
20:00 - illinois
20:02 - let's go and add a little dot by hitting
20:03 - option eight that's kind of the way you
20:05 - add one of those little bullet
20:06 - characters uh five five five five five
20:08 - five five five five five
20:10 - and us at me.com
20:13 - there's our footer
20:16 - and let's go and maybe add some style to
20:17 - the footer as well let's give it some
20:20 - color of gray
20:23 - and text a line of center
20:30 - and i don't know that padding's a little
20:31 - bit let's make it 20 pixels indeed ta-da
20:34 - and i'll also make this font size just a
20:36 - little bit smaller
20:38 - uh 10 pixels
20:40 - a little too small 12 pixels
20:43 - there we go so we basically got our
20:46 - website done you can see man it's
20:47 - looking like a good website if we add
20:49 - more content then this would actually be
20:51 - all the way down at the bottom when you
20:52 - scroll down because there would be
20:53 - content pushing it down
20:55 - but that's pretty much it so a little
20:58 - bit of cleanup we can do here
21:00 - let's go ahead
21:01 - this should be navuel right we never
21:04 - want to target all uls and lis across
21:06 - our whole page that'll just be
21:07 - frustrating so let's go ahead and copy
21:09 - these move these up to where the header
21:11 - rules are
21:12 - that's always a good idea you want to
21:14 - keep your stuff together i'm going to
21:15 - add a comment by hitting command and
21:18 - forward slash that's kind of a little
21:19 - hot key to add a comment
21:21 - anything beside in between these uh
21:24 - pieces of code here will not be css it's
21:26 - just comments that we can make so i can
21:28 - say header and then i can go down here
21:31 - that's all our header rules nice
21:33 - features
21:35 - this is going to help us just as we're
21:36 - kind of scrolling through those comments
21:38 - have that green color on purpose
21:40 - so now as you're kind of looking it's a
21:42 - lot easier to scroll through and see
21:44 - where your css rules are man that's
21:46 - about it this website came together how
21:48 - much time do we spend on this like maybe
21:49 - an hour max and we kind of have a whole
21:51 - complete look assuming that someone
21:53 - already took pictures for us and had a
21:55 - logo for us
21:56 - web development is not impossible it's a
21:58 - bunch of little skill sets so uh that
22:00 - covers it for now in the next video
22:02 - we're gonna handle responsive design
22:03 - we're gonna make this look better on
22:05 - mobile devices uh we did a really good
22:07 - job with our content to where it looks
22:09 - good on all the other devices it's just
22:11 - not going to look so good on mobile so
22:13 - we'll handle that that's called
22:14 - responsive design we'll catch you on the
22:16 - next video
