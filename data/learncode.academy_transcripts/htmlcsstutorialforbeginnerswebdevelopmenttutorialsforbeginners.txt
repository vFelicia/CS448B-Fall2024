00:00 - in this video we are going to start
00:01 - learning css along with our html now if
00:04 - you got here and you haven't seen my
00:05 - last two videos about how to set up this
00:07 - professional web environment with a live
00:09 - reloading server you're going to want to
00:10 - watch those those are in the description
00:12 - so let's move forward here css again
00:15 - stands for cascading style sheets so i
00:18 - made this basic web page here but it has
00:20 - no style it's just all default text
00:23 - default layout and i am zoomed in so it
00:25 - looks very big and it's easy for you
00:27 - guys to read but we're going to want to
00:28 - add style to this right now and we can
00:30 - do that with two you guessed it tags
00:33 - because everything in html is a tag so
00:36 - there's two tags we can use to get css
00:38 - style on our page we can use a style tag
00:41 - which will add css right here in the
00:43 - html document right here in this
00:45 - index.html file and the other tag which
00:48 - we'll wait on for a little bit is the
00:50 - link tag the link tag allows us to move
00:53 - that css out of the html into its own
00:56 - file and what's good about that is then
00:58 - any html page can bring that file in so
01:01 - you can share all your styles across a
01:03 - bunch of different web pages and that's
01:05 - what we want to do almost all of the
01:07 - time but for now to keep it easy we're
01:09 - just going to add a style tag here so
01:11 - now anything inside of this tag is not
01:14 - html it's going to be css
01:16 - so we're going to get in here we're
01:17 - going to add what's called our first css
01:19 - rule a rule consists of three things a
01:22 - selector
01:24 - and then you're going to do what's
01:24 - called curly braces that's these funny
01:27 - little things right here which you're
01:29 - pretty much only using coding and then
01:30 - you have a property
01:32 - and you have a value and you can have a
01:34 - bunch of properties and values
01:37 - property two
01:38 - which there's no such thing as these by
01:40 - the way and give it another value and
01:41 - then each thing is separated by a colon
01:44 - between property and value and a
01:45 - semicolon that's probably the weirdest
01:47 - thing there when you're learning css is
01:49 - you're using these characters that
01:51 - you're not used to using all that often
01:52 - the curly braces and then the colon and
01:55 - semicolon so now that we know this is
01:58 - all css is selectors with properties and
02:01 - values we just have to know how to use
02:03 - them selectors are pretty easy just pick
02:05 - which element you want to target so this
02:07 - is called targeting as well i'm going to
02:09 - target every h1 on my page
02:12 - and i'm going to start changing
02:14 - properties with different values one
02:16 - property would be hey what color is that
02:17 - font
02:18 - right now it's by default black let's
02:20 - change that to red you can actually use
02:22 - named colors for popular colors and you
02:24 - can see when i hit save i now have a red
02:27 - h1 let's copy this and make our h2 a
02:30 - different color let's add another rule
02:32 - let's get a new selector here
02:34 - and let's change that from red and
02:36 - instead of typing color i can actually
02:38 - hover over it and actually use my color
02:40 - picker you can see i'm picking an rgb
02:43 - color now let's pick something a little
02:45 - bit more i don't know brown doesn't
02:47 - really matter let's go gray gray is nice
02:49 - i think there we go got gray hit save
02:51 - and now my h2 is grayed out so that's
02:54 - going to be how you add rules that's css
02:57 - right there in a nutshell selectors
03:00 - properties and values i can change
03:01 - several properties on here i can change
03:04 - the opacity
03:06 - to 0.5 and hit save and now it becomes a
03:09 - little transparent which just looks like
03:11 - a lighter gray but if i had a background
03:13 - image on this webpage then that would be
03:14 - slightly transparent so you can see i
03:17 - can add multiple rules there
03:19 - and that's how you do that in css so
03:21 - let's start changing some rules on our
03:23 - page here
03:24 - let's give our body a background color
03:29 - with background so the body doesn't
03:32 - actually have a color to it because
03:33 - there's no text it has a background
03:35 - property
03:36 - let's just go black
03:38 - so i can get a color picker here and
03:40 - then i'll make it like a dark trendy
03:42 - gray
03:44 - let's go ahead and say that's still a
03:45 - little too dark here let's change that a
03:47 - little bit more hover over that get my
03:48 - color picker
03:51 - there we go so that's my page let's make
03:53 - this a less menacing color than red how
03:56 - about something like a nice cheery blue
03:59 - there we go and then let's just make
04:01 - this a lighter color gray to stand out
04:03 - on that dark gray background there we go
04:05 - let's also give this thing a font
04:07 - because that font is killing me right
04:09 - now so let's go font
04:11 - and you can see oh wow css kind of helps
04:13 - me out here it gives me font family font
04:16 - display it helps me see all these
04:18 - different things i can just go font dash
04:20 - family
04:22 - and then i can go helvetica new
04:25 - look it even tells me hey it looks like
04:27 - you're doing this rule here that's kind
04:29 - of a popular rule ariel comma helvetica
04:32 - comma sans-serif i'll show you what that
04:34 - means here
04:39 - ah that's looking much nicer so what
04:41 - i've done here on the font family is
04:43 - i've added multiple fonts because i
04:45 - don't know exactly what fonts the user's
04:47 - computer is going to have installed if i
04:49 - pick a font on my computer that doesn't
04:51 - guarantee everybody else is going to
04:52 - have it now these are some popular ones
04:54 - helvetica new helvetica those are mac
04:56 - fonts ariel is kind of the same version
04:58 - of that only not quite as good that
05:00 - windows machines pretty much all have
05:03 - and then sans serif so there's some ways
05:05 - you can get around the font problem
05:06 - which we'll get into in future videos
05:08 - and make sure that the font you want is
05:11 - available for every user but for now you
05:13 - pick a font family that you know is
05:15 - going to be popular
05:17 - on almost everybody's computer just
05:19 - please don't pick comic sans please do
05:22 - not ever pick comic sans so there we go
05:24 - i've made my font family and i'm going
05:26 - to zoom this back out that's actually
05:27 - what my web page looks like but it's
05:29 - pretty small on that screen so i'm going
05:31 - to zoom back in here
05:33 - and also i want my default color for my
05:35 - text to kind of be white because i don't
05:37 - want to have to change every paragraph
05:39 - in my whole
05:40 - web page so let's go color white
05:44 - there we go so now my default color is
05:46 - white let's go ahead and target that
05:48 - button and kind of change the background
05:49 - color of that button
05:53 - let's make that gray and you can see
05:54 - i've got my background color there and
05:56 - let's give it a border of none
06:00 - and now i have no border that's
06:01 - excellent and i also want to change the
06:03 - color on that as well too i don't know
06:05 - white so now you can see i'm kind of
06:07 - styling my web page i could also give
06:09 - this h1 a background color
06:12 - let's make this black so really dark
06:14 - black background for my h1 and that's
06:17 - kind of how we build the look and feel
06:20 - of a web page that's using css rules so
06:24 - from here i'm going to give you one
06:25 - piece of homework and then we're going
06:26 - to start building out an actual web page
06:29 - from here on out we're going to learn by
06:31 - building a complete website
06:33 - the homework is i want you to google
06:35 - because the number one skill you're
06:37 - going to learn as a web developer is how
06:38 - to google and find an answer on your own
06:40 - i want you to google and find out how to
06:42 - give this
06:43 - rounded corners with css i want you to
06:46 - find out how to make these corners
06:47 - rounded rectangle so go ahead do your
06:50 - homework find out what css rule it takes
06:52 - to make these corners rounded rectangles
06:54 - and let's start building out a whole
06:55 - website
07:02 - you
