00:00 - hey in this video we are going to be
00:01 - talking about local development workflow
00:04 - how many you guys know if you code 8
00:06 - hours a day the way you interact with
00:08 - your computer the utilities you use all
00:10 - the little things that make your
00:12 - development workflow enjoyable are
00:14 - important this is eight hours of every
00:16 - day of your working life so we're going
00:18 - to be talking about that some of the
00:20 - utility apps that I use along the way um
00:22 - a lot of you guys have asked me since I
00:24 - reviewed the ergod do easy keyboard and
00:26 - have mentioned that that's my keyboard
00:27 - of choice these days you've asked me for
00:30 - lot more details about my keyboard layup
00:31 - and how I do the layers I've got this
00:33 - beautiful brand new just released show
00:36 - snow and shine LED White Version I'll be
00:40 - showing you all the cool LED functions
00:42 - that this bad boy does and also how I
00:44 - set up the keys use my mouse at the same
00:47 - time through my keyboard and all that
00:49 - fun stuff so let's go a switch the
00:51 - camera angle around so you can see my
00:53 - keyboard and going back and forth
00:55 - between my screen at the same time this
00:57 - video is going to be a lot of fun let's
00:58 - get into it all right I'm going to get
01:01 - back to that beautiful keyboard here in
01:02 - just a second but let's start off with
01:05 - uh the first section of this video which
01:06 - is going to be software utilities that
01:08 - just help your Dev life uh there's
01:11 - pretty much three utilities that I'll
01:13 - install on any Mac right away that
01:14 - really help my worklow uh the first one
01:17 - is divvy which is a window manager app
01:20 - the other two good ones out there that
01:21 - would be I guess competition with divvy
01:23 - would be spectacle which is free for Mac
01:26 - uh and also magnet which is a newer one
01:28 - which is really cool as well so if you
01:30 - basically want to open a window you can
01:33 - have a hotkey that sends it to the left
01:35 - to the right full screen you can tap
01:38 - full screen again and it would go full
01:39 - screen to your other monitor if you have
01:42 - two monitors or you can send it to Any
01:44 - Corner if you want so I could go left
01:46 - corner right corner then I also have hot
01:49 - keys for 2/3 and hot keys for 1/3
01:53 - display so that's kind of the hot keys
01:55 - that I have going on for divy and that
01:57 - simple window management utility is
02:00 - something that I tremendously Miss if
02:02 - I'm on a machine that does not have it
02:05 - the ability to just fire off hot keys
02:07 - and move your windows around is
02:09 - tremendously useful so that's the first
02:11 - thing I'm going to install on any
02:12 - machine just to make life happier uh the
02:15 - second thing I'm going to install is
02:16 - going to be iterm 2 which is a terminal
02:19 - replacement um I'm definitely definitely
02:21 - going to install a terminal replacement
02:23 - if for nothing other than a hotkey
02:25 - window it turn 2 is great because you
02:27 - can have a hotkey window no matter what
02:28 - application I'm in I can hit in my case
02:31 - I've assigned it to command backtick or
02:33 - on my ergodox EZ I have a dedicated key
02:36 - that I've just is a command back tick
02:38 - key um so no matter what application
02:40 - you're in you can automatically just
02:41 - pull up your all your different tabs
02:44 - keep all your terminal tabs right there
02:46 - for all the things you're doing and then
02:48 - hotkey it away that's something that
02:49 - once you get used to that again you
02:51 - absolutely never never never want to go
02:53 - back uh I'd say the third can't do
02:56 - without application would be Alfred
02:58 - Alfred just makes searching easy no
03:00 - matter where you are let's say photos
03:02 - whoops see mistyped so now I can search
03:04 - Amazon or Wikipedia or Google um but I
03:08 - can also go Photoshop photo booth uh the
03:12 - POC phone the ioto you can basically it
03:15 - goes through your contacts your
03:16 - applications you get to search Google
03:19 - Amazon whatever right there again
03:21 - anywhere you are on your computer with a
03:23 - hot key Alfred is super awesome so those
03:26 - are the three software utilities now
03:29 - let's get back to that keyboard again
03:30 - let me show you how I have the the
03:31 - keyboard configured to actually help my
03:34 - Dev workflow as well because this
03:36 - ergodox EZ keyboard is completely
03:39 - configurable and really helps life out
03:41 - so I'm going to go split screen
03:43 - here so here we are with this beautiful
03:46 - new ergod doxy Z keyboard again the new
03:49 - snow and shine version with the
03:50 - beautiful fully programmable LEDs I'm
03:52 - going to get into all the programming
03:53 - and the way that I use this um first of
03:56 - all I'll show you the pretty stuff you
03:57 - can change the Hue to be any color you
04:00 - want obviously lots of beautiful colors
04:02 - to choose from with LEDs change your
04:04 - brightness make it very subtle make it
04:07 - full brightness I always just leave it
04:08 - at full brightness and there's a lot of
04:10 - fun macros that it comes built in with
04:12 - so you can go through things that slowly
04:15 - fade in and Fade Out Of course let's
04:17 - make that a different Hue
04:19 - there you can make them go a little
04:21 - faster you can do things that pulse that
04:24 - are lots of them are very very slow very
04:26 - subtle the kind of thing you'd actually
04:28 - want during your workday
04:31 - um there's ones that slowly fade
04:32 - rainbows across slowly do Night Rider
04:37 - style effects all sorts of fun stuff
04:39 - basically all the things I was thinking
04:41 - I'd like to do come baked in uh so lots
04:44 - of fun effects you can do there and then
04:45 - you can also set up hot Keys just for
04:47 - some of your favorite colors let's go
04:49 - with a nice blue for now now I'll show
04:51 - you how I've got this keyboard
04:53 - programmed so the ergod do way is to use
04:55 - layers so your fingers don't move a
04:57 - whole lot they'll be right here got a
04:59 - little bit
05:00 - cluttered you'll have it right around
05:02 - here and then you toggle to layers to do
05:04 - different types of things so let's go
05:06 - ahead and pull up my computer screen now
05:08 - let's uh pull up some actual code so I'd
05:12 - say as far as familiarity goes took me
05:14 - about one month to get confident on this
05:17 - keyboard and that wasn't using it
05:19 - constantly I found the most efficient
05:20 - way to learn it was to go back and forth
05:22 - from a regular keyboard to this so I
05:23 - didn't get too frustrated um after that
05:26 - about a month to get confident two
05:28 - months to feel great to really love the
05:31 - keyboard three months to feel like a
05:32 - just Rockstar and now I can type as fast
05:35 - as I
05:39 - want I have no problems except for
05:41 - apparently uh
05:43 - typo Bard um I I have no problems typing
05:47 - full speed on this keyboard and you
05:50 - actually get a lot of great things with
05:51 - it so the layers concept is super cool I
05:55 - know if you noticed earlier but I was
05:57 - clicking my keys as I was using my mouse
05:59 - when I click here I go into layer one
06:02 - which I can either go temporary or leave
06:05 - it constantly on this is my programming
06:07 - layout which I'll put the link to my
06:09 - layout in the description uh these are
06:11 - temp layer one toggle layer one temp
06:15 - layer 2 toggle Layer Two so if I go to
06:18 - layer one then my they're not WD they're
06:22 - the esdf that controls my mouse and then
06:25 - over here I can change it to control my
06:26 - mouse slow or medium or fast which is
06:30 - default so this fast key is really kind
06:32 - of useless but if I want to you know
06:34 - slowly I'm getting close to a file go
06:36 - more medium I don't really use slow too
06:38 - much but I do use medium from time to
06:40 - time so that's very useful and then this
06:42 - is scroll we don't really have much to
06:44 - scroll
06:45 - with let's go create some junk
06:50 - here and I can scroll now these are my
06:53 - scroll Keys like my scroll wheel would
06:55 - be and I can also scroll left and right
06:57 - although there is no left and right
06:59 - scroll so I have Mouse scroll all my
07:02 - mouse actions are right there while it's
07:04 - not as powerful as a mouse it definitely
07:07 - gets the job done and allows me to not
07:09 - move back and forth throughout the day
07:11 - um also this hotkey right here is my
07:14 - arrow keys so let's do some more stuff
07:17 - here so if I go over here then I have my
07:19 - arrow keys so mouse keys arrow keys and
07:24 - I can move around all the way I need to
07:26 - move and then this right here is my
07:28 - coder lay layer so this is only a
07:30 - temporary I really never need to toggle
07:32 - the coder layer and that's what gives me
07:34 - basically all of my hot keys on this
07:36 - hand I have more this is more dedicated
07:38 - to hot Keys There's an actual another
07:40 - window so let's go hide Sublime Text uh
07:43 - pull up something here let's go new
07:46 - right left full these are my four
07:51 - quadrants and that's one3 or 23 and
07:53 - that's 1/3 so that's kind of what I use
07:55 - that for and then as far as my coder
07:58 - layer I tend to do that over here so
08:00 - let's say I'm doing a function I can
08:02 - hold this and now I have
08:04 - paren I have curly brackets and I have
08:07 - braces I also have my common coder
08:10 - things at equals the arrow then I also
08:14 - have back ticks right there so between
08:16 - that I can do a lot of cool
08:18 - things function just crank out a
08:20 - function really fast or if you're doing
08:23 - es6 a
08:25 - equals there we go so what I did there
08:28 - is const a
08:29 - equals which is on the blue layer space
08:32 - now I'm on this
08:34 - layer Arrow just did an arrow function
08:38 - right there and there so those keys once
08:41 - you get to know them a lot of cool stuff
08:43 - really easy to crank out code fast and
08:47 - fun also a lot of Sublime Text things uh
08:50 - I have a dedicated copy cut copy paste
08:52 - here so let's
08:54 - copy paste paste paste paste use my
08:57 - arrow keys here scroll up
09:00 - uh I have some Sublime Text hot Keys
09:02 - programmed in here so this will bump my
09:04 - selection down these two keys bump it up
09:06 - and down and these will actually move my
09:08 - lines up and down so that's a lot of fun
09:11 - let's move it back up there maybe bump
09:13 - my selection up
09:16 - one there we are that's really nice and
09:19 - easy to move stuff around so you can do
09:21 - a lot of fun things really fast with
09:24 - that and that's pretty much how this
09:27 - keyboard programmed it took me a while
09:29 - while to figure things out if you ever
09:31 - have a kind of custom programmable
09:33 - keyboard what I'd encourage you to do is
09:35 - take some time and think about the hot
09:37 - keys that are frustrating to you one
09:39 - thing that was frustrating to me was
09:41 - command tab because on a regular
09:42 - keyboard you're doing something like
09:44 - that yet I command tab all the time so I
09:46 - kept tab right here and I also made a
09:49 - shift tab right here so I can easily go
09:52 - back and forth since I'm doing that all
09:54 - day long um and I found that I didn't
09:56 - really need that extra space bar so then
09:58 - here's my space
10:00 - here's my backspace and here's my tab
10:03 - right there this is equals plus minus
10:06 - kind of my math Keys there's my equals
10:09 - plus minus and or times the common math
10:13 - keys that I use all the time um and
10:16 - between those I have a lot of fun a lot
10:18 - a lot a lot of fun using this keyboard
10:21 - now let me show you Visual Studio code
10:22 - here like I said I've been mentioning
10:24 - I've been playing with code a decent bit
10:26 - recently and I think I might be making a
10:29 - switch to Vis Visual Studio code one
10:32 - thing I love about Visual Studio code is
10:34 - it lints real time in a really great way
10:38 - let's make an error here you can see
10:40 - right there my linter is showing uh oh
10:43 - you doing something wrong here doing
10:45 - some problems I also have a terminal
10:47 - right here if I want to use my terminal
10:48 - in this project at all super nice what's
10:51 - cool about Visual Studio code is it
10:53 - gives you just enough to feel like an
10:55 - IDE but it's really a text editor at
10:58 - heart so it's a text editor that gives
11:00 - you a lot of good ide things so over
11:02 - here is my GitHub or my git stuff which
11:05 - is really nice uh you can easily see all
11:08 - your git changes let's go ahead and
11:10 - commit
11:17 - something there we go now let's go
11:19 - change something over
11:25 - here let's make some things there let's
11:28 - hit save
11:31 - and I should see my get changes here
11:33 - super nice and then I can click on it
11:35 - and you'll actually see your inline
11:37 - diffs which is really nice you'll see
11:39 - the red code you took away over here the
11:41 - green code you took away over there I
11:43 - can plus that okay now it's
11:46 - staged you can see that it's staged for
11:49 - commit so that's it's really nice the
11:51 - GitHub integration feels completely
11:53 - natural the es linting and the terminal
11:56 - right here although I don't really use
11:57 - the terminal that often uh the es
11:59 - linting real time and that git
12:02 - integration is just enough IDE to get
12:05 - the job done so I think I might be
12:07 - switching to visual studio code here
12:09 - soon uh we'll see time will tell I do
12:12 - like Sublime Text it is fast but anyway
12:16 - that's pretty much my Dev workflow I
12:17 - know I flew through quite a few things
12:20 - covered the keyboard covered my
12:22 - utilities that I like to use covered my
12:25 - text editors that I like to use but if
12:27 - you have any questions leave me in the
12:28 - comments below I'd love to answer them
12:31 - uh hope this helped you out and have
12:33 - yourself a great day
