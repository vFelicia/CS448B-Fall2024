00:00 - hey everybody this is going to be an
00:01 - upgrade to my one of my most popular
00:03 - videos of all time it has over 500 000
00:06 - views
00:07 - and it's the question i get asked
00:09 - absolutely the most by new beginners and
00:11 - that is hey i just finished this sweet
00:13 - new website how do i make it an actual
00:15 - website i've got my html and css files
00:18 - and stuff but i actually want to turn it
00:20 - into
00:21 - myawesomesite.com how do i do that is
00:23 - there cost associated with that and what
00:25 - is the easiest fastest cheapest best
00:28 - path for me
00:29 - so the short answer is there is no one
00:31 - answer to it there's a lot of different
00:33 - ways that you can do it
00:34 - and as your skill level grows you may
00:36 - actually choose some different methods
00:38 - like as you learn github and as you
00:40 - learn other things there's there's a
00:42 - variety of methods out there but if
00:44 - you're starting off and you're an html
00:46 - css developer the absolute easiest way
00:48 - to go is to get a shared hosting server
00:51 - by a domain name through a separate
00:53 - domain name registrar so that way
00:55 - instead of
00:56 - 127.0.0.1 you have myawesomedomain.com
01:00 - and then you're going to get a web
01:01 - server a web hosting plan the web server
01:04 - is a computer that lives on the internet
01:06 - that's constantly online and you're
01:07 - going to put your html and css files on
01:10 - that server and they're going to point
01:12 - your domain name to that server and then
01:15 - ta-da you have a website and if you ever
01:17 - want to move the server somewhere else
01:19 - you have your domain separate you can
01:21 - set up a different server and point your
01:22 - domain to the new server that's why it's
01:24 - very important to keep them separate it
01:25 - makes that a lot simpler so we're going
01:27 - to go through that on this video we're
01:28 - going to try to do it in record time get
01:30 - all the steps so you can actually see me
01:32 - by an actual domain by an actual hosting
01:34 - plan and then connect the two and you
01:37 - are done i'll also mention that i have
01:39 - links to these two places i'm going to
01:41 - recommend in the description if you use
01:43 - those links you will support this
01:44 - channel um so they are affiliate links
01:46 - uh however it very important for me to
01:48 - mention that i will never ever ever
01:50 - recommend something that i don't fully
01:52 - believe is the best solution for the
01:54 - developers i'm recommending it to so i
01:56 - would never ever give a false
01:58 - recommendation in order to
02:00 - get support for the channel or anything
02:01 - like that
02:02 - so i'm on iwantmyname.com this is my
02:04 - favorite place this is where i keep my
02:06 - domains my absolute favorite place for
02:08 - domains to live it's super easy they
02:10 - give you domain privacy for free which
02:12 - is my favorite thing about them
02:14 - and uh so yeah you just start off by
02:16 - searching for a domain let's say
02:18 - myawesomewebsite.com
02:22 - nope not dot zom
02:23 - howabout.com
02:27 - there you go myawesomewebsite.com is
02:30 - available let's buy this thing
02:32 - wait nope it's taken my awesome
02:36 - awesomenewwebsite.com see if you got
02:38 - that one
02:39 - the internet's got that one available
02:40 - for me let's buy it let's go ahead check
02:42 - out my
02:44 - awesomenewwebsite.com you can see that
02:45 - it's going to cost 14 i'll go back real
02:48 - quick
02:48 - some of these newer domains might be as
02:50 - expensive as seventy or a hundred
02:52 - dollars so the dot coms are the cheapest
02:55 - but they're the hardest to get exactly
02:56 - what you want as well i can also say
02:58 - that dot coms tend to do a little bit
03:00 - better in search engine optimization so
03:02 - that is something to think about so i'm
03:04 - going to go ahead and check out and then
03:05 - i'll enter my credit card address and go
03:07 - through all this i'll skip that for you
03:09 - i'll see you at the next step okay boom
03:11 - i filled out all my credit card
03:12 - information i bought my
03:14 - awesomenewwebsite.com you can see i'm on
03:15 - my dashboard i can go ahead click on
03:17 - that and the most important thing that i
03:19 - can do is i can change my name servers
03:21 - down here now i have to buy web hosting
03:23 - first i'm going to get some web hosting
03:25 - and then i'm going to point these name
03:27 - servers to the web hosting also you can
03:29 - see that i got privacy enabled by
03:31 - default which means that
03:32 - you people cannot look up the website
03:35 - and get my home address which is what
03:37 - you get if you don't have domain privacy
03:40 - turned on so let's go over here to
03:42 - shared hosting plans on hostgator.com
03:44 - again link is in the description
03:47 - and you can either buy it for a single
03:48 - domain or unlimited domains uh and then
03:51 - ssl certificate comes baked in on all of
03:54 - them that means the https which with the
03:56 - lock which is good
03:58 - if you do want to do unlimited domains
03:59 - multiple domains maybe you're going to
04:01 - be building several websites for several
04:03 - people uh like another dollar or two a
04:05 - month and you can get this one instead
04:07 - that's definitely a good move uh so
04:09 - let's go and buy this one though because
04:11 - we just have our one domain and say hey
04:13 - i already own this domain
04:15 - of myawesomewebsite.com
04:19 - myawesomenewwebsite.com so i don't need
04:20 - to purchase that
04:22 - and then i'm going to go ahead and fill
04:23 - out some username and security pin
04:25 - information but let's come down here
04:26 - first and see you can see that the the
04:29 - bigger you go the more discount they're
04:31 - going to give you obviously that makes
04:32 - sense there's a few coupon codes that
04:34 - you can always use
04:36 - you can use let's make a deal
04:40 - that's a coupon code that they give me
04:41 - because i recommend so many people over
04:43 - to them at this point um
04:45 - and that's going to give you a really
04:46 - good discount you can see that if we go
04:48 - over to i don't know just say 12 months
04:52 - then that gives us 35 off you can see
04:55 - that the coupon code is reflected here
04:56 - up to 40 percent off so that's a really
04:58 - good coupon code um other coupon codes
05:01 - that they always have out there is drop
05:03 - 10 bucks
05:04 - and drop 25 perks so drop 25 those kind
05:09 - of always work at any point in time as
05:11 - well but i think let's make a deal is
05:13 - kind of the best coupon code that i've
05:15 - found for them
05:16 - the other thing you're going to make
05:17 - sure you do is turn off all this stuff
05:19 - because they're going to want to
05:21 - upsell you on all these other things
05:23 - that you may or may not need
05:25 - if you're not good at backing up your
05:27 - code you might want to pay the two
05:28 - dollars a month for that if you want
05:30 - gmail to power your email addresses
05:34 - then five dollars a month is what gmail
05:36 - charges so
05:37 - you can get your address at
05:39 - yourdomain.com but it's all through
05:41 - gmail that's what i do personally that's
05:43 - a great way to do it but that is five
05:45 - dollars a month as well so there are
05:46 - some extra things you can buy but you
05:48 - don't really need them i'm gonna go
05:50 - ahead and buy this hosting here and
05:52 - we'll see at the next step hey so check
05:54 - this out i've got all my credit card
05:56 - information added and because i'm going
05:58 - to delete this account after i make it
06:00 - i just got the one month and i did the
06:02 - drop 10 bucks i get to buy this for .01
06:05 - cents now that's probably not the route
06:07 - you want to go if you want to have your
06:08 - website around for a little while you're
06:09 - going to want to buy more than one month
06:11 - and the let's make a deal coupon code is
06:13 - probably going to be a better deal for
06:14 - you overall because after this it goes
06:17 - up to like the full
06:18 - eight or ten dollar monthly plan
06:21 - uh but one of the things i actually
06:22 - really do like about hostgator is
06:24 - they're one of the only places that lets
06:25 - you do a month-to-month shared hosting
06:27 - plan lots of places make you do a
06:29 - minimum of three months so i figured i'd
06:31 - point that out pretty cool that you
06:32 - can't actually get started for one penny
06:35 - okay there you go i now have a web host
06:38 - and again the web host is where we're
06:39 - going to put our html and our css files
06:41 - and they're going to always be online
06:42 - and we are going to point our domain
06:44 - name to the web host as well so you can
06:46 - see i've got a hosting package here
06:47 - let's go ahead and click over on the
06:48 - hosting tab and i can find out the
06:50 - details that i need to send my domain
06:52 - name over i'm going to click on manage
06:55 - here
06:56 - and it's going to take just a second to
06:57 - load and then i can find what are called
06:59 - my name servers my name servers are what
07:02 - i need to plug in here let's go update
07:04 - name servers
07:06 - on iwantmyname.com
07:09 - and let's go to settings here
07:12 - and there we go we have our name servers
07:14 - i only have two name servers which is
07:16 - more common than four
07:18 - so name server one
07:22 - name server two
07:24 - and then i just get rid of all the
07:26 - others you can see they only require two
07:28 - lots of places only have two and now our
07:30 - domain name is pointed to our dashboard
07:33 - so all we want to do now is let's go
07:35 - back to overview
07:37 - and let's go to file manager and upload
07:39 - our files and then we are going to be
07:41 - done so when i click on our file manager
07:43 - here you can see that we've got this
07:45 - folder structure this is our actual
07:47 - server we're kind of connected to that
07:49 - this www is a folder so i can double
07:51 - click on that i've got this
07:53 - default.html i'm going to go ahead and
07:55 - i'm going to right click and hit delete
07:58 - so now let's upload my own stuff let's
07:59 - click upload here
08:01 - and select some files from my desktop
08:03 - i've got my websites and index in a
08:06 - styles.css
08:10 - let's add index
08:12 - let's add style css
08:14 - they're both uploaded let's go back here
08:16 - and see if we can find them
08:18 - tada they're there and now let's try
08:21 - going to my awesome
08:23 - new
08:24 - website dot
08:25 - took me a long time to type that out and
08:28 - tada you can see that i actually have a
08:30 - website myawesomenewwebsite.com
08:34 - it is uploaded it is online it is
08:36 - finished it's it's really that easy get
08:39 - a domain name
08:40 - get hosting and hostgator obviously and
08:43 - i want my name do make it very easy
08:45 - other places like godaddy make this
08:47 - process much more frustrating there are
08:49 - a lot of hosts that make this process a
08:52 - lot more detailed in the steps that you
08:54 - have to take uh which is why i like
08:57 - these two companies they make it very
08:58 - very simple very fast it all happens
09:01 - real time
09:02 - um and so in just a few minutes i've got
09:04 - a website up uh i've got my files on it
09:07 - and we are good to go so i hope this
