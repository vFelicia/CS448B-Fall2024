00:00 - in this video we're going to show you
00:01 - the view lifecycle methods which allow
00:02 - us to do some cool things including load
00:05 - some dynamic data from a server that our
00:06 - component needs to render so the
00:08 - lifecycle methods that View bakes in our
00:10 - before creates which as you guessed
00:13 - fires if this was a function we add here
00:16 - it's going to fire before our view
00:19 - component gets actually created so we
00:21 - have before creates we have create we
00:24 - have before mounts which is before the
00:27 - component actually gets mounted into the
00:29 - dom and then we have mounted which is
00:31 - the one we'll want to use if we want to
00:33 - load any dynamic data then we also have
00:35 - before destroy and destroyed if you want
00:37 - to do some cleanup or something before
00:39 - this component ever leaves the dom so
00:42 - let's go ahead and create a mounted
00:43 - method we'll just create it right here
00:46 - on our view object that we're sending to
00:48 - our new view and let's just do console
00:51 - log mounted so this is going to fire
00:54 - when our component actually mounts to
00:56 - and you can see right here the ID app so
00:59 - if I save and refresh hey I got it
01:01 - mounted to prove this to you let's go
01:03 - ahead and remove this if you remove the
01:05 - element it will not mount to the dom it
01:07 - doesn't know where and when this is
01:09 - useful in some circumstances if you
01:11 - don't want to mount it to the dom
01:12 - immediately but you want to kind of get
01:14 - it all set up so what I can do down here
01:16 - now in my console is I can go app dot
01:19 - amount and then I can just give it let's
01:22 - go to mount to app and there we go it
01:25 - mounted and you can see it said mounted
01:27 - so that's kind of a way that you can use
01:29 - that so that's when that fires it fires
01:31 - when your app boom attaches to the dom
01:34 - and so that's where we're going to want
01:35 - to fetch some dynamic data so we could
01:38 - do this with the fetch API here we could
01:39 - just use JavaScript fetch API request
01:43 - some data in there or whatever it is who
01:45 - knows what it is then let's go ahead
01:48 - take that response and let's turn it
01:52 - into JSON
01:56 - then we have our response and we can do
02:01 - something with it
02:02 - so in this case let's go ahead and use
02:05 - rest learn code Academy which is a free
02:08 - restful api that I set up a while ago
02:10 - it's great for prototyping stuff the
02:12 - date is public and it gets erased every
02:14 - so often but basically how to use it as
02:15 - you just go rest dot learn code dot
02:20 - Academy slash API make up your own user
02:22 - make sure you make up your own unique
02:23 - user so I'll make this view five and
02:25 - then you make up the collection so this
02:27 - will be friends so the first time you
02:30 - try to access it it doesn't exist it
02:32 - gets created and now it's an empty array
02:33 - so I can go ahead and fetch that now
02:36 - that's now a full restful endpoint with
02:38 - git post input so there we go
02:41 - view five friends and when we get that
02:44 - data back in let's say this dot data or
02:47 - this dot friends equals data so there we
02:51 - have it and that's now we're fetching
02:54 - dynamic data let's prove that this
02:55 - actually populates that dynamic list by
02:58 - going to my terminal I'm gonna use curl
03:00 - to actually post some people to that
03:02 - friends list so we're gonna send a post
03:07 - request here and the data will be named
03:12 - we're just gonna give it a JSON object
03:16 - I'm gonna post my name there we go we'll
03:19 - and we're gonna post to that URL there
03:22 - we go we added it you can see our
03:23 - response back we got an ID so if I go to
03:26 - here I now have one friend in my friends
03:30 - list and if I now reload this I don't
03:33 - have my friends list because I haven't
03:34 - mounted yet so let's run that exact same
03:36 - command mount it mounted it grab my
03:39 - friends and there you go my friends are
03:41 - now populated so now I want to insert
03:43 - friend dot name instead of just friend
03:46 - let's mount it again fetched it and
03:50 - there at my name will so that's getting
03:52 - a little annoying to have to trigger
03:54 - that mouth let's add this yell back in
03:56 - here
03:57 - now let's go post another friend here
04:00 - let's post say William and maybe one
04:05 - more person Willis so now I should have
04:09 - three friends or my app loads up
04:11 - excellent I have three friends so that's
04:13 - kind of how you'll use your lifecycle
04:15 - methods to do fun stuff namely the most
04:17 - common use case is going to be to load
04:19 - dynamic data in the next videos let's go
04:22 - ahead turn this into a full friends list
04:23 - editor so we can delete friends and edit
04:26 - friends
