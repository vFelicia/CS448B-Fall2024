00:00 - hey in this video we are going to cover
00:02 - yarn which is a very cool new npm
00:05 - replacement uh if you've been doing
00:07 - front end or back in development with
00:09 - node.js then you're used to using npm to
00:11 - install all of your javascript packages
00:14 - npm is great but there are a few
00:15 - deficiencies with it that yarn fixes and
00:18 - so we're going to cover that real quick
00:20 - i'm going to show you how great it is to
00:21 - get started with yarn all you have to do
00:23 - is npm install
00:26 - g yarn and then you're good to go yarn
00:29 - gets installed and it will work with
00:30 - your existing package json for lots of
00:33 - projects it's just going to work out of
00:34 - the box you just use yarn instead of npm
00:38 - so while that's installing real quick
00:39 - there we go that's done let's go ahead
00:41 - now and do an npm install you can see i
00:43 - just kind of threw a package together
00:46 - and threw in some dependencies let's say
00:48 - low dash mobx mysql react connects babel
00:51 - and webpack all right let's go and do an
00:52 - npm install
00:54 - and see how long this takes here and
00:57 - i've already tested this it takes about
00:59 - 25
01:00 - between 20 and 30 seconds to do this npm
01:03 - install which is quite a bit of time to
01:06 - just get a few javascript packages
01:08 - because it's pretty much going through
01:09 - synchronously and getting them all one
01:11 - at a time for the most part um so there
01:14 - we go still going still going
01:16 - still going
01:18 - this takes a while there you go still
01:20 - going all right that took a while and
01:22 - we've got our node modules created so
01:24 - let's go ahead and rmr let's rimraf
01:28 - our node modules folder and let's do
01:30 - this with yarn real quick yarn install
01:32 - let's see what we have here there it
01:34 - goes looking up all the package
01:36 - dependency trees
01:38 - installing everything and
01:41 - boom
01:42 - almost boom
01:44 - boom that took 10 seconds
01:46 - much much much much faster cool thing
01:49 - about yarn is it caches everything which
01:51 - means if we have another project let's
01:54 - say node modules is gone
01:56 - our yarn install again here
02:02 - this is going to be much faster you can
02:04 - see the fetching was instantaneous and
02:06 - now we're done in five seconds if this
02:08 - was another project using the exact same
02:11 - versions of some of these packages those
02:13 - packages would not have to fetch you
02:15 - essentially get offline development for
02:17 - everything that you've already had to
02:19 - fetch before so we've established that
02:21 - speed is this big plus with yarn let's
02:23 - look at the next major big thing that
02:25 - yarn adds for you and that's application
02:28 - stability you can notice this yarn lock
02:30 - file over here
02:32 - this is basically your npm shrink wrap
02:34 - file if you've ever messed with npm
02:36 - shrink wrap it's not a whole lot of fun
02:38 - you've got to always update it yourself
02:41 - sometimes you actually have to get in
02:42 - there manually and mess with it it
02:44 - basically locks down your full
02:45 - dependency tree well because if you
02:48 - don't do that then you might end up with
02:50 - slightly different versions of packages
02:53 - on different developer machines or you
02:55 - might have a slightly different package
02:57 - version on your machine and then go to
02:59 - production and it doesn't work
03:01 - and that can be just a lot of
03:02 - frustration and so yarn automatically
03:04 - locks it down all the time and it's a
03:07 - really clean and easy to read format you
03:09 - can see that this is the yarn lock file
03:11 - it's really easy to understand let's go
03:13 - to react
03:15 - react you can see there's my react
03:17 - dependencies wow that's pretty nice
03:18 - let's look at something more involved
03:20 - let's say connects there's my connects
03:22 - dependencies not too bad you can see
03:25 - them all right there boom boom boom and
03:27 - we're good to go so if you ever want to
03:29 - update something let's go ahead and look
03:31 - at react
03:32 - we're pulling off a 0-14 there's a later
03:35 - version out there so my package json
03:36 - same thing i can go yarn upgrade
03:40 - react
03:44 - and it fetches it very quickly as
03:46 - expected we're now running react 1542
03:49 - and you can see i'm now let's go to
03:51 - react
03:53 - i'm now running the upgraded version of
03:55 - reactant yarn lock as well so yarn lock
03:57 - you want to commit to your repository to
03:59 - your source control just like you would
04:01 - with your package json and now if any
04:03 - other environment pulls this and doesn't
04:06 - install they're going to get the exact
04:07 - same versions that they're supposed to
04:09 - get so between these two features it's a
04:12 - really big addition a lot of cool stuff
04:15 - there's a little bit of a difference in
04:17 - the way you'll type the commands
04:19 - instead of npm install you'll do yarn
04:22 - add a lot of cli's are using add instead
04:25 - of install these days because it's a lot
04:26 - easier to type so
04:28 - yarn add view
04:30 - let's go ahead add view
04:32 - there we go that's added you can see
04:33 - it's added right there and let's say we
04:35 - want to add something else to a dev
04:36 - dependency yarn add
04:39 - d
04:40 - jquery
04:41 - so now it's going to add as a dev
04:43 - dependency
04:44 - because there we go jquery is in our dev
04:46 - dependencies uh so that's pretty similar
04:49 - um and then you could also do yarn start
04:51 - just like npm start so for the most part
04:54 - all the commands are the same yarn
04:56 - remove jquery
04:59 - take jquery away there we go and that's
05:02 - pretty much it so i hope you found this
05:03 - video helpful
05:04 - yarn has definitely been a great
05:06 - addition to my team and i hope it helps
05:08 - you out in your day-to-day workflows
