00:01 - let's learn Bower today a lot of you
00:02 - guys have heard about Bower it is a
00:05 - package manager for the web if you know
00:07 - what package managers are you're like
00:09 - yes this is great that it's here if you
00:11 - don't know what package managers are uh
00:14 - you're going to learn what that is and
00:15 - what the value of that is and why
00:17 - everybody's buzzing about it so let's do
00:19 - p Let's uh just get into it I'll show
00:21 - you what this is about first off you'll
00:23 - need no JS installed on your machine if
00:25 - that's not installed uh here's how you
00:27 - know as you type node DV I have version
00:30 - 10 0.10.1 two if that's if you don't see
00:33 - that then go ahead to nodejs.org get it
00:36 - installed once that's there then you can
00:38 - go npm install DG bow so that is going
00:43 - to globally install bower for me so now
00:46 - it isn't executable anywhere on my
00:48 - system um there you go Bower is now
00:51 - installed and ready to be used so go to
00:54 - the folder where your project is which
00:56 - is in sandbox test for me and let's just
00:59 - go ahead and say we want to add jQuery
01:01 - to our page we go bow install
01:04 - jQuery and that's going to go grab the
01:07 - latest greatest version to jQuery and
01:09 - you can see I got in finder here you can
01:11 - see it added a b components folder added
01:13 - jQuery and added uh distribution version
01:16 - for that right there as well as the Full
01:18 - Source um and this is Sublime same
01:21 - package up here so now if I go Bower
01:25 - list it says that it jQuery is installed
01:29 - in the Bower component folder if I go b
01:31 - list paths with double dashes then it
01:35 - will show me the path to the one I'm
01:37 - going to want to use by default so now I
01:39 - can just go
01:43 - here there you go jQuery is on my page
01:46 - bow is super great for that let's say I
01:48 - also want to add
01:50 - backbone bow install backbone it's going
01:53 - to automatically grab backbone backbone
01:55 - has a dependency of underscore so it's
01:57 - also going to grab underscorejs yes for
02:00 - me and now if I do Bower list paths I've
02:04 - got my one for underscore got my one for
02:06 - backbone and I could just add those all
02:09 - here so that's the first awesome thing
02:12 - about Bower is it just gives you a
02:13 - really easy way to install dependencies
02:16 - and this wouldn't have been a complete
02:18 - pain in the rear but I have had to
02:19 - download the zip file unzip the zip file
02:22 - put it where I want it to go and this is
02:24 - just way better um and so that's Step
02:28 - One is using just to install stuff just
02:31 - using it to download stuff on your page
02:33 - if you want to get by the way a let me
02:36 - uninstall
02:39 - jQuery um if you want to install a
02:42 - specific version you know lots of people
02:44 - don't want to use J gree 2.0 if you're
02:46 - supporting Legacy
02:48 - browsers jqu just did
02:51 - pound what is that 1.9.2 I could
02:54 - probably grab that there you go jorey
02:57 - 1.9.2 grab that specific version let's
02:59 - let's make sure that's what's in
03:01 - there and oh we got an error there
03:04 - available
03:06 - versions
03:08 - 1.9.1
03:12 - okay there we go and see was even nice
03:15 - enough to know dummy there is no 1.9.2
03:18 - out there right
03:19 - now and so same thing let's go list
03:26 - paths and sometimes it doesn't have the
03:29 - path in there power component SL jQuery
03:31 - got to pick your own yourself here so
03:34 - there you go jQuery
03:39 - jQuery and there's just no dist path so
03:43 - sometimes it doesn't have the path in
03:44 - there for you depending on how they
03:45 - added Bower so that's step one of bower
03:48 - use it to download and install
03:50 - JavaScript files let's go to step two
03:52 - this is honestly where I think B becomes
03:54 - even more useful is let's say we're
03:57 - working on this project and we're not
03:59 - the only On's working on this project
04:01 - it's kind of a bad idea a bad pattern to
04:05 - check in this code into your G
04:08 - repository um as the web keeps growing
04:10 - and growing and everything becomes
04:11 - interdependent on it on each other uh a
04:14 - good pattern is to only checking code
04:16 - that has to do with your project
04:19 - specifically so we don't want this to be
04:21 - in the repo we just want a package file
04:23 - that says hey install these things for
04:25 - us so we're going to go Bower and knit
04:27 - and start making that package file by
04:29 - default it's going to start throwing in
04:31 - these things I'm just going to say yes
04:32 - to
04:35 - everything there we go just keep saying
04:37 - yes yes yes I'm just going to I'm just
04:39 - going to do all the defaults and say yes
04:41 - and it's going to make a power. Json
04:43 - file for me here's all the values I put
04:46 - in I can change them now if I want um
04:49 - and here's the dependencies that were
04:51 - currently installed at the point of me
04:54 - creating this init file and so now what
04:57 - I can do is I can actually I'll have a
04:58 - get ignore
05:00 - line for the bower components folder so
05:02 - Bower components will not be included in
05:04 - my get repository just these two files
05:07 - and so now whenever anybody else pulls
05:10 - the repo down they just go bow
05:12 - install and that's going to grab all
05:15 - their dependencies so it's kind of like
05:17 - a common thing you download the folder
05:19 - you run Bower install and now your
05:21 - folders your project is good to be used
05:24 - and so we've we've cleaned it out we've
05:26 - kept all these dependencies out we know
05:28 - it's going to automatically load the
05:30 - specific version that our uh our product
05:33 - is built for as the versions keep
05:35 - incrementing we're only going to get a
05:37 - new version if we intentionally choose
05:39 - to go
05:41 - 2.0 2.0 um and so that's kind of where
05:47 - the package management concept comes in
05:49 - for Bower another thing you can do is
05:50 - you can install say you have a large
05:53 - Network and you have internal company
05:55 - repos of projects and pieces of code you
05:58 - can install those using B
06:00 - you can go B install um and then a
06:02 - GitHub repo URL say if you have a local
06:05 - installation of GitHub Enterprise uh or
06:08 - if you just have private GitHub repos as
06:10 - long as you have access it'll use your
06:12 - GitHub SSH keys and you can install any
06:16 - GitHub URL as long as everyone else on
06:18 - your project will have access to that
06:20 - repo added in here as well so it gives
06:23 - you a way to break up your project into
06:25 - meaningful chunks and
06:27 - components uh and each one just can use
06:30 - a bower package to do it all and this
06:32 - doesn't just go for JavaScript I can go
06:34 - Bower install
06:36 - bootstrap and this will give me all the
06:38 - CSS
06:41 - files um and actually now that we have a
06:43 - bower Json file you notice I added
06:46 - bootstrap but it didn't get added to the
06:48 - bower.json that's a mistake that people
06:51 - commonly make a lot is you have to hit
06:54 - flag capital S if you want it to save to
06:58 - your actual B Json file and see now
07:02 - you'll notice that it reloaded bootstrap
07:04 - is saved if I go B our list paths it
07:08 - gives me multiple paths for bootstrap
07:10 - because M bootstrap has the Javascript
07:12 - file it's got the CSS file and it's also
07:14 - got all the glyph icon fonts so yay
07:16 - there we are that's Bower hope you
07:18 - enjoyed learning about it have a great
07:27 - day
