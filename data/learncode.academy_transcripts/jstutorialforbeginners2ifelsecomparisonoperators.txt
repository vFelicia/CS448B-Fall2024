00:00 - so in our first JavaScript lesson we
00:02 - learned about variables and we learned
00:04 - about the first two types which is the
00:06 - number and string and there's really
00:09 - only six or eight types in JavaScript
00:11 - depending on how you look at it so
00:12 - they're not going to go on and on
00:13 - forever but before we get into the next
00:15 - types I want to show you some extra
00:17 - programming tips or some extra ways that
00:19 - you can build programs with the types
00:21 - that you already know let's say that my
00:24 - user's age is 16 years old and I want to
00:28 - write a program to where if they're less
00:29 - than 16 it's going to alert that they
00:31 - can't drive if they're older than 16 uh
00:34 - it's going to alert that they can drive
00:37 - how would I do that uh we're going to do
00:39 - that with an if statement so I'm going
00:41 - to do if and I'm going to open and close
00:42 - my parentheses again and I'm going to
00:45 - open and close my curly braces now for
00:47 - this I'm going to want to do multiple
00:48 - lines so you're going to want to hold
00:50 - control or shift depending on if you're
00:51 - on Mac or Windows and then it's going to
00:54 - allow us to do multiple lines of code
00:56 - here and it won't run until we hit enter
00:59 - so I can go if age is less than remember
01:02 - that sign for math class I'll show I'll
01:04 - talk about it more in a minute alerts
01:07 - you canot
01:09 - drive so this is a less than symbol it's
01:12 - called a comparison operator um and
01:15 - basically because the little side points
01:18 - over here if the age is little than 16
01:22 - or if it's less than 16 then we are
01:25 - going to do what is ever in between
01:27 - these curly braces basically if the
01:29 - question we asking here is true then
01:31 - we're going to do what's between the
01:33 - curly braces if it's not true we're
01:35 - going to ignore what's in between the
01:36 - curly braces so right now my age is 16
01:40 - and I've said if age is less than 16
01:43 - then alert I cannot drive it didn't do
01:45 - anything at all because my age is 16 or
01:48 - greater so if I change age to
01:50 - 15 and run it again I hit the up Arrow a
01:54 - couple times uh one great thing about
01:55 - the console is your up and down arrows
01:57 - will give you all your history so I hit
01:59 - the up a couple times and hit enter now
02:02 - it says I cannot drive because my AG is
02:04 - changed to 15 let's look at some more
02:07 - comparison operators real quick I'm
02:08 - going to pull that up again uh there's
02:11 - the less than and then there's greater
02:13 - than so this would be if age is greater
02:15 - than 16 and then I can also add an
02:18 - equals to either of those and this means
02:20 - is it greater than or equal to 16 so
02:23 - greater than 16 would be 17 and up
02:26 - greater than equal would be 16 and up
02:29 - less L than would be 15 and under less
02:32 - than an equal would be 16 or under so 16
02:36 - is also included in the group I can also
02:38 - do two equals for is exactly 16 and then
02:43 - I can also do not equal for is not 16 so
02:48 - if your age is not 16 you canot drive
02:51 - doesn't make any sense but that's kind
02:53 - of how you do that I will put these in
02:54 - the description because you you might
02:56 - forget them and you might want to
02:58 - remember them so if your age is let's go
03:02 - back to our program if your age is less
03:04 - than 16 alert you cannot drive let's say
03:06 - I want to say alert you can't drive this
03:08 - is going to be a little Rabbit Trail but
03:10 - it's important to notice uh there's a
03:12 - problem with this code because I'm
03:14 - opening up my string here with a single
03:17 - quote and then I'm ending it here but
03:19 - I'm actually not ending it here I'm
03:21 - ending it here so that's actually going
03:23 - to give an error this will not work and
03:25 - so what if you want to add a single
03:27 - quote inside of or an apostrophe inside
03:31 - of a string we have two choices you can
03:34 - either go to double quotes here and so
03:37 - now that's going to work um or what you
03:40 - can
03:41 - do is you can do what's called escaping
03:44 - it with a backslash The Back The Backs
03:46 - slash in a string says whatever the next
03:49 - character is don't treat it as code
03:51 - treat it as a string character so this
03:54 - will work now it's going to be y u space
03:56 - c n apostrophe T Dr so let's hit that
04:00 - and you'll see it says you can't drive
04:02 - with an apostrophe and so that's called
04:05 - escaping that's important uh to know I
04:08 - know it's kind of a rabbit Trail kind of
04:09 - off the beaten path of where we're going
04:11 - but that's important so let's go if age
04:14 - is less than 16 alert you can't drive if
04:16 - age is greater than
04:20 - 16
04:21 - alert you can
04:24 - drive and an exclamation cuz driving is
04:26 - fun there's a problem with our program
04:28 - though is what if the user is 16 so if
04:30 - it's less than 16 it'll do this if
04:33 - they're older than 16 like 17 then it'll
04:36 - do that but what if they're exactly 16
04:38 - well let's fix that by going less
04:40 - greater than equal so now if you're 16
04:43 - or older you can drive so now our
04:45 - program will always alert something
04:47 - let's change my age to
04:49 - 17 you also notice I didn't do V anymore
04:53 - that's CU I've already defined the
04:54 - variable of age you only have to do V
04:57 - the first
04:58 - time a equal 17 and let's run our
05:02 - program again it says you can drive now
05:04 - let's change our age to 16 and make sure
05:06 - that our program works age 16 yep you
05:10 - can drive too let's go one more step
05:12 - further with our
05:14 - program and what you can actually do is
05:16 - you can make this go else let's clean
05:18 - this up a little
05:20 - bit what you can do instead of if if is
05:23 - you can do what called an if else
05:24 - statement I can say if age is less than
05:27 - 16 do this else we're going to do this
05:31 - so basically if you're not younger than
05:33 - 16 we're going to do what's in here
05:35 - every single time so this program will
05:37 - do the exact same thing you can also do
05:41 - an if else an else if statement so what
05:44 - that would do is you can add another
05:47 - condition you can do another set of
05:48 - comparison operations in here so if the
05:51 - age is less than 16 do this else if age
05:56 - is exactly 16 you can drive
06:00 - finally else which would mean if they're
06:03 - older than
06:05 - 16
06:06 - alert you've probably been driving
06:12 - already and you'll notice once again I
06:15 - have to escape that because that's not
06:17 - allowed I would have been closing this
06:19 - off with y apostrophe and this would
06:21 - have just been bad code so now if our
06:23 - age is less than 16 we're going to do
06:25 - this else if our age is exactly 16 we're
06:29 - going to do this and if it's anything
06:31 - besides that we're going to alert that
06:33 - you've probably been driving
06:34 - already and so my age currently is 16
06:37 - you can drive finally let's change our
06:40 - age to
06:42 - 15 run our program you can't drive let's
06:46 - change our age to
06:50 - 17 you've probably been driving already
06:53 - and let's do something let's change our
06:55 - age to
06:56 - 16.5 what do you think it's going to do
06:58 - I changed it to 16
07:00 - .5 well it's going to do else because
07:02 - it's not exactly 16 it's greater than 16
07:06 - you've probably been driving already and
07:07 - it's true just not for very long so
07:09 - please keep driving safely so that is if
07:12 - else statements so now go ahead and
07:14 - write maybe another program where you
07:16 - prompt you get something from a user and
07:21 - do something fun with it so have a great
07:24 - day and enjoy JavaScript lesson number
