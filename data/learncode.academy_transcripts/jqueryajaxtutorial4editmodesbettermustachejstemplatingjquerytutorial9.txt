00:01 - all right this is our last video of
00:02 - building a basic jQuery ajax app we can
00:05 - now get orders we can add orders we can
00:08 - delete orders all that's left is to edit
00:10 - orders and for that we are going to use
00:12 - a put request uh kind of if you're
00:15 - you've probably heard the term restful
00:16 - apis and that's kind of a standard way
00:19 - of putting together an API where you use
00:21 - get request to access things your
00:23 - backend is looking for post requests to
00:25 - add new items uh and if an item has an
00:28 - ID and you want to edit it then you use
00:30 - a put request to it's basically the same
00:33 - as a post but you add the ID on the URL
00:35 - and then you do a put request and you
00:36 - will update that resource uh and then
00:39 - delete which we've already done which
00:40 - you can do by ID we're going to be doing
00:42 - the put request it's the most involved
00:44 - and so we're going to take our
00:45 - templating to a whole new level uh show
00:47 - you a better way of templating other
00:49 - than scratching out lines in JavaScript
00:51 - that's going to be the first thing we
00:53 - want to do this is pretty much as far as
00:55 - I will ever go with plunking out you
00:58 - know uh string lines concatenated
01:01 - together in JavaScript it's kind of
01:03 - messy it's a whole lot of quotes it's
01:06 - just stuff we don't want to do Beyond
01:07 - this this is as far as I'm going to go
01:09 - any more than this we got to go one of
01:11 - two routes we either got to put a
01:12 - template tag in our HTML uh which is a
01:15 - quick easy way and that's what we're
01:17 - going to do for this or you can say you
01:19 - have a lot of templates you can create
01:21 - an HTML file for each template and then
01:25 - you can use something like grunt to
01:26 - automatically turn those into JavaScript
01:28 - strings for you that's way more involved
01:31 - than we need for this so we're not going
01:32 - to do that in this uh but let's go ahead
01:34 - and take this we're going to copy it
01:37 - out and what you can do is you can add a
01:39 - template
01:42 - tag and so we're just going to paste
01:45 - this in here I'm going to use my Apple D
01:47 - multiple cursors and Sublime to get rid
01:49 - of all my quotes and same thing to get
01:52 - rid of all my pluses there we go now if
01:54 - I give this an ID order
01:57 - template and then I can inst instead of
02:00 - stringing all this out right here I can
02:02 - go order template equals and I can grab
02:04 - it with
02:07 - jQuery HTML did I do order Dash template
02:11 - yes I did okay so this should work
02:12 - exactly as I have it before let's save
02:14 - and refresh excellent so this is working
02:17 - perfectly and it's much cleaner you get
02:20 - syntax highlighting here uh you know you
02:22 - see all the pretty colors that you
02:24 - should see when you're coding HTML and
02:26 - it just works uh one one thing to
02:28 - mention if you're using ie eight or
02:30 - older uh it may just be a safer way to
02:33 - just go script uh this is kind of the
02:35 - old way we used to do it you do a script
02:37 - tag and you give it a type of text SLT
02:41 - template and what that's going to do is
02:43 - it's going to tell the browser type text
02:45 - template the browser doesn't know what
02:47 - that is it knows it's not JavaScript so
02:49 - it's going to ignore this block of code
02:51 - uh and you you're safe to put anything
02:53 - you want inside of it uh and you're not
02:55 - going to blow up your JavaScript on the
02:57 - page because it doesn't think it's
02:58 - JavaScript so that's kind of the old way
03:00 - to do it uh I'll just stick to the
03:02 - template tag uh for now since I'm only
03:05 - supporting HTML 5 browsers with my
03:07 - application and yay now we can move
03:09 - forward so we're going to do is we want
03:11 - an edit mode for this Li I'm going to go
03:14 - clean up my HTML a little bit uh we want
03:17 - an edit mode so we're going to do is
03:19 - we're going to add a class of edits to
03:21 - this Li when we're editing it and then
03:23 - we want some stuff to be hidden and we
03:25 - want other stuff to be shown when that
03:27 - edit tag is there so I'm going to go
03:30 - ahead and bump this down I'm going to
03:32 - make it a
03:35 - span and this span will get hidden when
03:37 - we're in edit mode and I'm going to make
03:39 - an
03:40 - input and the input will get shown when
03:42 - we're in edit mode and the way I'm going
03:44 - to do that is with a class class edit so
03:47 - the class edit and I'm also going to get
03:48 - a class of drink uh name so I know how
03:51 - to access the name there and this class
03:54 - will get no edits so whenever edit
03:57 - exists on the LI anything anything with
03:59 - no edit will get hidden anything with
04:01 - edit will get shown yeah very simple
04:03 - sounds easy enough let's do the same
04:05 - thing here for
04:06 - drink and this just becomes
04:09 - drink there we go so that's covered and
04:13 - then we need some other buttons here we
04:14 - got the remove button we'll leave you
04:16 - there we need an edit
04:20 - button and this one will have let's see
04:23 - class equals edit order and I'm also
04:26 - going to add a no edit to this because I
04:28 - don't want to show this one we're
04:29 - currently
04:31 - editing um and then let's make a cancel
04:35 - button this will have edit so it'll get
04:37 - shown only when we're editing and we'll
04:40 - call this one cancel
04:43 - edit there's a lot to go that goes into
04:46 - editing it's a lot simpler to just
04:48 - create and delete um and I think that's
04:50 - it edit and cancel awesome uh we also
04:53 - need a save button now won't we so let's
04:55 - go save um this will be called save save
05:00 - edit
05:02 - maybe and this one will have an edit
05:04 - class so we show this only on edit so if
05:07 - I hit save here we should see everything
05:09 - yep so now everything is plunked out
05:11 - let's add some CSS rules here to just
05:13 - hide what we
05:17 - need so when we're on edit I'll actually
05:21 - do this so any edit within the LI gets
05:24 - to display
05:26 - none there we go now anything that is
05:29 - only going to show on edit is gone and
05:32 - so then you li edit edit so when the lii
05:37 - is in edit mode anything with
05:39 - edit gets a display initial which is
05:43 - what it would have shown had we not
05:44 - added a display
05:45 - none and then no edit gets a display
05:50 - none there we go that should work so now
05:53 - if I refresh I see an edit button and if
05:55 - I were to inspect this element here and
05:58 - add a class
06:02 - pass there we go now we see save cancel
06:05 - and they are inputs awesome now let's
06:07 - just wire this in with
06:09 - JavaScript so moving on uh we want to
06:12 - add down here another delegate because
06:14 - if you remember delegate is going to
06:16 - apply to anything that hasn't been
06:18 - created yet as well as things that are
06:21 - currently
06:22 - existing so I'm going to
06:27 - delegate um what was the name of my I
06:30 - think it was called edit order yes edit
06:32 - order right there so an edit order gets
06:40 - clicked we are going to let's see let's
06:44 - cach this
06:48 - Li just like we did up here this I can
06:50 - actually probably copy and paste that
06:52 - for
06:55 - me there we go so now we're grabbing the
06:58 - closest Li and we are going to copy the
07:01 - name of the value into the value of the
07:05 - input for editing purposes so we are
07:08 - going to go Li find I want to find my
07:12 - input class
07:14 - name the input with the name class
07:17 - that's going to
07:18 - be this guy and I want to set the value
07:21 - to be the content of this guy so oh I'm
07:25 - going to add a name class here and I'm
07:27 - going to add a drink class here so I'm
07:29 - going to basically set the value of span
07:31 - class name to be the value of input
07:34 - class name if that makes sense so let's
07:37 - go input class name
07:39 - Val which means I'm setting the value or
07:41 - getting the value and that will go l i
07:45 - find span class
07:49 - name HTML so that's we are setting the
07:52 - input to the same value as the span
07:56 - let's do the same thing with
07:58 - drink so now input class drink I love
08:01 - the sublime multiple cursors right there
08:03 - Apple D it's just H it's great okay so
08:07 - setting that and then we're just going
08:08 - to add the edit
08:12 - class so once again caching the the LI
08:15 - right here is a great move because I can
08:17 - do several operations and I don't have
08:19 - to search the Dom each time so let's see
08:22 - if that works hit edit and awesome we
08:25 - populate our two values and we turn into
08:27 - edit mode which means our save and
08:28 - cancel there let's go and add our cancel
08:31 - item I'm going to actually copy and
08:33 - paste because this is probably a lot
08:34 - more similar than anything
08:36 - else cancel
08:39 - edit and then all cancel edit is going
08:42 - to do is remove class
08:47 - edit so I'm just going to grab that Li
08:50 - again remove the class of edit let's see
08:52 - if that works edit cancel edit cancel
08:56 - nice so that works um
08:59 - um add my semicolons there and then the
09:03 - last thing we need to do is the save
09:04 - operation so here we go same thing
09:09 - orders what did I call
09:12 - that save edit is the name of my save
09:22 - button so when save edit is clicked I'm
09:25 - going to have to grab those two values
09:26 - and put together my put request let's
09:28 - just do a very similar thing to what we
09:30 - did here Order
09:31 - equals
09:33 - name and in this in this case I'm
09:36 - actually going to grab the LI kind of
09:37 - same thing I've been
09:39 - doing and then going to go Li
09:42 - find
09:45 - input Val so there we go I'm going to
09:47 - grab the value of whatever that input is
09:49 - and order will be the same or drink will
09:52 - be the same way drink will be grab input
09:55 - drink uh have the value for that so
09:57 - there we go I've got my order put
09:58 - together together let's post this thing
10:00 - to the back end I'm going to do some
10:02 - copy and paste to make it a little
10:07 - easier this is going to be a put request
10:10 - and instead of posting to API orders
10:12 - we're doing a put to API orders and
10:15 - we're also going to add the ID here so
10:17 - this is going to
10:19 - be let me make this easy I'm going to
10:22 - add the ID
10:26 - here there we go love mess templating
10:29 - makes it easy to throw stuff in there so
10:32 - now I can just go Li H data
10:37 - ID so there we go we've grabbed the ID
10:40 - off of what that entry is we're going to
10:42 - put it to ord ID we're going to pass the
10:44 - order object and on success we are
10:48 - basically going to populate our values
10:51 - let's see what's going to happen so when
10:52 - we hit save we changed this William I
10:56 - hit save I can't just go back back to
10:59 - here cuz this span now needs to be
11:01 - updated I'll show you over here in the
11:03 - HTML we've put a new value in here when
11:05 - the save comes through as successful we
11:07 - need to take that value throw it in here
11:10 - and then take edit off of our edit mode
11:12 - so that's easy to do we're just going to
11:15 - go l i find
11:19 - span if I can type span
11:23 - name HTML is order. name there we go
11:29 - I'll do the same thing for
11:31 - drink and then I'm going to remove the
11:33 - class of
11:34 - edit which I think I have right
11:41 - there and so get that edit class removed
11:44 - and then airor let's do error updating
11:47 - order there we go let's see if our API
11:50 - Works refresh so I can go will
11:54 - am save not right click and there we go
11:58 - it's saved let's let look at our Network
11:59 - to make sure that happened we did a put
12:01 - request to API
12:03 - orders1 got a 200 okay on that and if I
12:06 - refresh it should say William instead of
12:09 - will awesome let's change it back to
12:11 - will change my order to a
12:15 - frap I keep right clicking for some
12:18 - reason there you go we got it so I know
12:20 - I kind of sped through that may need to
12:22 - rewatch it again that's kind of how
12:23 - you're going to take your templating to
12:25 - a higher level that's how you're going
12:26 - to add a put request um and that's an
12:29 - easy way to toggle any kind of visual
12:31 - thing into an order mode is just add
12:34 - hidden you know hidden input elements
12:36 - and then toggle them on and off so hope
12:39 - you had a great time watching this and
12:41 - catch you around
