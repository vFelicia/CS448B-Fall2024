00:01 - hey you guys I just had to take a quick
00:03 - detour from the coding videos to show
00:06 - you guys a intro to GitHub adom text
00:10 - editor which I just got my Beta invite
00:13 - to a few days ago so this isn't even
00:15 - publicly released yet but I wanted to
00:17 - kind of give you guys some insight on
00:18 - how great this editor is I am thoroughly
00:21 - impressed after the last few days and
00:23 - honestly once a couple little bugs get
00:25 - fixed that are already in the works on
00:26 - getting fixed I will be switching to
00:28 - this as my primary editor cuz it is
00:31 - awesome uh you guys probably know I'm
00:33 - historically a huge Sublime Text guy I
00:35 - swear by it um and if you like subblime
00:38 - text you're just going to fall in love
00:39 - with Adam is my my guess so we'll just
00:42 - kind of show you around so you'll notice
00:44 - right away feels really at home with
00:46 - Sublime Text um the tabbing even just
00:49 - feels really really subliming which is
00:52 - great to me I feel right at home one of
00:54 - the great things right out of the box
00:56 - you'll notice is some colors here it's
00:58 - automatically built in with a get differ
01:00 - so you're going to notice these are
01:02 - orange cuz I made a change to my
01:04 - main.js uh so it's really great and
01:07 - you'll also notice that any folders that
01:09 - are get ignored are grayed out anything
01:12 - that's in the get ignore file is applied
01:15 - to the colors and the themes can make
01:17 - use of that information so those are two
01:19 - big wins for me right off because those
01:22 - are really nice to have um I can do
01:24 - Apple shift p and do all commands just
01:27 - like you can in Sublime love that they
01:29 - give you the hot keys there I can do
01:31 - Apple p and I can automatically search
01:34 - for any
01:36 - file and that's super nice and then
01:38 - Apple p uh just like Sublime Text will
01:41 - give you your most recent history at the
01:43 - top as well or any open files uh so you
01:46 - can use apple P to hot switch back and
01:48 - forth between your most recent files uh
01:51 - if you just hit Apple p and then enter
01:52 - so that's really cool uh what are some
01:55 - other great features most of the hot
01:57 - keys that you're going to be using in
01:59 - Sublime are going to work like apple D
02:01 - to uh automatically do multiple cursors
02:05 - uh so I've got some multiple cursors
02:06 - selected here by hitting Apple d a few
02:08 - times you probably can't see
02:10 - that let me see if I can get you a
02:12 - better uh let's see padding will
02:14 - probably work padding Apple d a couple
02:16 - times and now I can go
02:18 - margin so that's nice for multiple
02:21 - cursors um really most anything so far
02:24 - you'll notice the diffs are right there
02:25 - flagged super nice um most anything that
02:30 - you can do in Sublime you can do with
02:31 - Adam let's look at the preferences real
02:33 - quick um automatically has package
02:36 - manager built in really great the
02:38 - packages are built in coffee script
02:41 - items built on noes so this is going to
02:43 - be a really easy Text Editor to hack and
02:46 - build packages for I can't wait to start
02:48 - building uh some packages for this um
02:51 - also your themes here a really cool
02:54 - feature is you can theme the UI so if
02:56 - you guys are weird and like your light
02:58 - UI you can do that and feel all cool and
03:02 - then you can also do dark if you uh for
03:04 - whatever reason you're like me so let's
03:07 - install a Dracula
03:09 - theme
03:13 - Dracula there we go Dracula theme let's
03:15 - get that guy
03:18 - installed H
03:20 - installed and now we're rocking with
03:22 - Dracula so super easy to work with let's
03:25 - look at one of the coolest features of
03:26 - atom is that it gives you some command
03:28 - line tools so so any folder you're in
03:31 - I'll go ahead and close this out don't
03:33 - save anything I can just go add them and
03:36 - it's going to automatically open up the
03:38 - folder that I was in one of the bugs
03:39 - there in the process of fixing is that
03:41 - when you do it this way you're not going
03:42 - to see your get diving uh but that is
03:45 - already a bug request and they're
03:46 - working on that you can also go
03:51 - Adam grunt file and that's just going to
03:53 - open the file you're in super cool you
03:55 - can give it several different flags you
03:57 - can tell it to open in the foreground if
03:59 - you go
04:01 - Adam help you can see that you can open
04:04 - it in a new window you can uh log output
04:07 - you can run development mode super cool
04:09 - another thing they give you is the APM
04:11 - command which is your Adam package
04:13 - package manager I can go APM list I can
04:16 - see all the default packages and I can
04:18 - also see any user packages which is my
04:20 - Dracula theme so I can uninstall
04:24 - that Dracula theme I can probably do APM
04:28 - search monokai
04:31 - too yep there you go so I can install
04:34 - this theme from
04:36 - here so really gives you some cool
04:39 - features out of the box um you can add
04:42 - the atom command for Sublime I use Su uh
04:46 - for the exact same features so it's not
04:48 - stuff that you absolutely can't get with
04:50 - Sublime these aren't features you can't
04:52 - add into Sublime but really out of the
04:54 - box they just give them all to you which
04:56 - I am loving so there's your first take
04:58 - on Adam editor really liking it I
05:00 - uninstalled my Dracula theme so that's
05:03 - not working now um but out of the box
05:06 - I'm saying way to go GitHub this editor
05:08 - is cool and I am hands down a fan have a
05:11 - great day you guys
