00:00 - okay now my workspace is running so we
00:02 - can focus on building the react
00:04 - application again everything in react is
00:07 - a component and components return
00:09 - exactly one Dom element just like an
00:13 - HTML everything has to have one parent
00:16 - Dom element they can't have two parent
00:18 - Dom elements so if I want to return a
00:20 - pair of h1s this will not work I'm going
00:22 - to get the nasty error that JSX elements
00:26 - must be wrapped in an enclosing tag so
00:28 - if I want to return multiple I just have
00:29 - to wrap them in a div like so now it
00:37 - will work again and I'll have two H ones
00:39 - of course I don't need to do that so in
00:42 - this case I'll go back and revert
00:44 - another thing is you can import dynamic
00:47 - information very easily I could create a
00:49 - constant my name my name is will and
00:54 - then anything in curly braces in the JSX
00:57 - portion of your file that's very
01:00 - important it won't work outside of there
01:01 - but anything in curly braces will just
01:04 - execute as normal JavaScript so in this
01:07 - case it's going to evaluate name which
01:09 - is the value of will there you go it's
01:11 - will I could also do three plus two it's
01:14 - five and then I could also do a
01:18 - self-executing anonymous function and
01:22 - that returns the value of three of
01:26 - course that's a terrible idea I don't
01:27 - know why you'd ever want to do that but
01:29 - you can see it executes the function
01:30 - returns the value of three and then sets
01:33 - the value of three in there if you do
01:36 - need logic this is not the proper place
01:38 - to do it generally if you need basic
01:40 - logic you can do it in the render method
01:43 - so say ver Val equals I could do some
01:47 - sort of self executing anonymous
01:48 - function here say maybe get Val
01:52 - something like that is totally fine and
01:54 - then I could print Val or if you have a
01:57 - little bit more logic and you want to
01:58 - keep your render method clean which is
01:59 - always a good idea you could do get Val
02:02 - you could create a method on your class
02:05 - and then I could do this get Val
02:12 - and then whatever get Val returns will
02:14 - be printed out into the template so I'm
02:16 - going to return will again and UB its
02:21 - will again you can also pass that a
02:23 - value I could pass that a value now I
02:27 - can return will plus Val and you get the
02:30 - point
02:31 - it basically is class methods and you
02:33 - can invoke them last but not least I can
02:36 - actually use a constructor method since
02:38 - it is a JavaScript class I can do a
02:40 - constructor method the only thing you
02:44 - have to do is you must call super as the
02:46 - first line of a react component
02:47 - constructor so we call super on the
02:50 - first line and then we could do this dot
02:52 - name equals will and then we can simply
02:57 - just access this dot name it's will so
03:02 - there you go that's your basic component
03:05 - introduction in the next video we're
03:06 - going to look about how to take multiple
03:08 - components and create a full app layout
03:10 - from react components
