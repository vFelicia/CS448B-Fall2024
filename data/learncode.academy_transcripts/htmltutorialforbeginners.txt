00:00 - in this video we are going to learn html
00:02 - for new developers now if you missed my
00:04 - last video which is how to set up visual
00:06 - studio code um in a professional coding
00:09 - environment and workspace you definitely
00:11 - want to watch that that link is in the
00:13 - description go ahead watch that and come
00:14 - back to here in this video we're going
00:16 - to learn html which is the content for
00:19 - the web i'm going to go ahead and close
00:20 - this real quick i can click on this
00:22 - folder thing and get rid of all those
00:24 - files so i have a little more screen to
00:26 - work with
00:27 - but if you think about a website it's
00:29 - got content and it's got look and feel
00:31 - to it so the content would be the words
00:33 - on the page any images on the page any
00:35 - buttons on the page
00:37 - and that those words images and buttons
00:39 - could look a thousand different ways
00:40 - with a thousand different colors so html
00:42 - is what puts the content on the page um
00:45 - and it's ugly you can tell that this is
00:46 - ugly i don't even have a font that's
00:48 - being chosen for me uh let alone a font
00:51 - size and a font color or a background
00:53 - color that's because i'm just using html
00:55 - right now i'm just adding content to my
00:57 - page after that we'll get into css which
01:00 - is cascading style sheets css would say
01:04 - give me a gray background with blue text
01:06 - and a button with rounded rectangle
01:08 - corners on it and let's make this image
01:10 - small and i don't know let's make it
01:12 - shake when you hover over it things like
01:14 - that that's css and so when people learn
01:16 - html and css together they can build a
01:19 - full website
01:21 - and then javascript is what a developer
01:23 - will learn to add functionality to that
01:25 - website where you can maybe post a tweet
01:27 - to twitter and things like that that's
01:29 - all functionality that's javascript so
01:32 - those three technologies make a web
01:34 - developer's tool kit now what we're
01:36 - going to do in this video is we're going
01:37 - to learn html
01:39 - and html is the easiest piece of all
01:41 - three you can really learn it in a day
01:44 - or even an hour because all you have to
01:46 - do is memorize a few words let me show
01:48 - you what i mean here i'm going to take
01:50 - away all this code
01:52 - and i'm going to leave that top one
01:53 - there because that's the one that says
01:55 - hey it's an html web page
01:57 - everything in html is considered a tag a
02:00 - tag looks like this a greater than
02:02 - symbol the tag name we'll call this html
02:06 - and then any attributes i'll get to
02:08 - attributes in a second and then the less
02:11 - than symbol you can see when i type that
02:12 - less than symbol vs code visual studio
02:15 - code automatically added what's called a
02:17 - closing tag for me which is the same
02:19 - thing but it has a slash anything
02:21 - between the opening tag and the closing
02:24 - tag is considered inside of a tag so if
02:27 - i type type type type this is now inside
02:30 - of my html tag and that's how that works
02:32 - you can have tags inside of tags i could
02:35 - have a body inside of the
02:36 - html tag
02:38 - and then i could have other tags inside
02:40 - of that you can have as many tags inside
02:42 - of as many tags as you want it's all
02:44 - just tags tags can be two things they
02:47 - can have an opening closing
02:49 - or if there's nothing inside of them
02:50 - they can be what's called self-closing
02:52 - which you add a slash to the end of it
02:55 - and a good example of this would be an
02:57 - image an image
03:00 - is the img tag
03:02 - and image doesn't have text inside of it
03:04 - or any of that it loads an image
03:06 - from a web server and spits it out on
03:08 - the page so we don't have to have an
03:11 - opening and closing tag it can be self
03:12 - closing
03:14 - and then we define things how does that
03:16 - image know which image we're pulling
03:18 - from the internet we're going to use
03:19 - what's called attributes for that so a
03:22 - tag can have one or more attributes to
03:24 - do an attribute you do a space
03:26 - after the tag name and you give it an
03:28 - attribute let's say it has a width
03:30 - width equals 300. and so you do equals
03:35 - and then an opening closing of
03:37 - quotes and then whatever's inside of
03:39 - that is considered the attribute so
03:41 - think of it as a person right the tag
03:42 - name is image let's say this was called
03:44 - frank
03:45 - and frank has a height well he could
03:47 - have a width too
03:48 - there's attributes about frank right as
03:50 - a person he's got a certain height and
03:53 - he's got a certain intelligence
03:56 - these are things that are
03:58 - qualities about frank intelligence high
04:01 - and so that's kind of how tags and
04:03 - attributes work the tag is what the
04:05 - thing is
04:06 - the attributes describe
04:08 - things about that tag so in this case we
04:11 - have in the case of image we have an
04:13 - image
04:15 - and you might have a height a width and
04:18 - a source which is where that image comes
04:20 - from that is all of html we just covered
04:23 - all of html right here tags with tag
04:26 - names and attributes that's it from here
04:29 - on out you just have to memorize a few
04:31 - tag names
04:32 - and a few attributes and you have all of
04:34 - html done so let's get into some of
04:36 - these common tag names there's really
04:38 - three categories that give you
04:40 - everything you need to start off to
04:42 - build an html web page you have to have
04:44 - three tags to start off you have to have
04:46 - an html tag again i'm just typing html
04:49 - and hitting tab here and visual studio
04:51 - code is doing the rest so really all you
04:53 - do have to do is memorize some words so
04:56 - i'm doing an html tag inside of that i'm
04:59 - going to do a head tag
05:01 - and then i'm also going to do a body tag
05:04 - those are the three tags that it takes
05:05 - to build a web page you notice that head
05:08 - and body are both inside of html that's
05:11 - extremely important
05:13 - now html doesn't care about white space
05:16 - at all so these could be like this
05:18 - these could be like that it doesn't
05:19 - really matter none of that matters it
05:21 - only matters to you the developer we
05:23 - like to keep them
05:24 - indented in such a way where it's easy
05:26 - to see what's inside of what so that's
05:29 - what the indentions are all about i
05:30 - indent using tab so you can go tab and
05:33 - then you can also select one or more
05:35 - things and do shift tab or tab and
05:38 - things will move around indention wise
05:40 - so that's what those indentions are all
05:42 - about
05:43 - in our head tag we'll add one title tag
05:46 - here and let's say my page
05:49 - and let's add an exclamation mark
05:51 - because we're feeling chirpy today so
05:52 - there we go you can see up here at the
05:54 - top if you can see it because it's
05:55 - really little it says my page
05:57 - exclamation mark in the body let's add
05:59 - our hello world back
06:02 - and then that is our web page so we've
06:05 - got our body our body is everything that
06:07 - the user sees in this main body of the
06:09 - web page so all of the rest of our tags
06:11 - are going to go in here
06:12 - and so that is your basic three tags for
06:15 - a web page html head body and a title
06:19 - tag which you don't have to do but
06:20 - pretty much everybody wants to do it
06:22 - because you want your tab to have a
06:23 - title so now let's look into how you
06:25 - style text text comes with
06:28 - h1 tag being your biggest piece of text
06:31 - which is a header
06:34 - there you go wow that's really big i'm
06:35 - kind of zoomed in here to make it easier
06:37 - but wow that h1 is big and you can go
06:39 - all the way down to h6
06:41 - my subtitle
06:44 - so you notice that h2 is by default a
06:46 - little smaller the default css for h1 is
06:49 - going to make it huge and h2 is going to
06:51 - be smaller and smaller still all the way
06:53 - down to h6 i'll do an h6 here which is
06:56 - even smaller
06:58 - so the h6 is even smaller than and what
07:01 - these are used for is these are used for
07:03 - telling google
07:05 - if you want it to rank your page to rank
07:06 - on google and all of the web browsers
07:08 - and everything what the most important
07:10 - pieces of your page are so google is
07:12 - going to look at your page and it's
07:13 - going to say oh the h1 that's the title
07:14 - for the whole page h2 these are section
07:17 - subtitles so any
07:19 - content blocks within your page will be
07:21 - h2s and farther down if if an h2 has
07:24 - multiple content blocks in that those
07:26 - will all be h3s that's what we use those
07:28 - tags for css could make this one huge
07:31 - and make this one tiny so it doesn't
07:33 - necessarily relate to size it more
07:35 - relates to importance so those are our
07:38 - h1 h2 those are our header tags
07:41 - and then there's a p tag which is for a
07:43 - paragraph hi i'm
07:45 - a paragraph of text
07:50 - so there's my paragraph of text and if i
07:52 - do multiple ones of these
07:54 - then you'll notice that each one kind of
07:55 - has a space in between it just like you
07:57 - would expect a paragraph to do default
07:59 - css is going to add a space below each
08:01 - paragraph
08:03 - and so that's how paragraphs work now
08:05 - you'll remember i mentioned that html
08:07 - does not care about white space so if i
08:08 - do a ton of spaces here it doesn't
08:11 - change when i save it nothing is
08:12 - different what if i add a million
08:14 - returns here well accidentally got a
08:15 - slash so we'll get rid of that slash if
08:17 - i had a million returns nothing changes
08:20 - html does not care about spaces past one
08:23 - the first space works because you know
08:25 - you really couldn't type anything
08:26 - without a space
08:27 - but that's kind of how html works it
08:30 - doesn't care about white space white
08:31 - space is what you use as the developer
08:33 - to make it easy to read all the content
08:36 - well what if i wanted to add a line
08:37 - break like that well there's an actual
08:39 - tag for a line break called br and it's
08:42 - a self-closing tag because it doesn't
08:44 - have any content in it and you can see
08:46 - there we go we have an actual line break
08:48 - a return an enter key got added into
08:50 - that so that's a tag you want to know as
08:52 - well br for line break
08:54 - and then what if you want to change some
08:56 - of the ways these work
08:57 - you can add strong to make it bold
09:02 - let's make it a strong paragraph added a
09:04 - space there probably don't need a space
09:06 - there strong is basically what you use
09:08 - for bold if you're looking at really old
09:10 - web pages you may see a b tag floating
09:13 - around which does the same thing but
09:14 - that's that shouldn't be used anymore
09:16 - strong is what you should use for bold
09:18 - now
09:19 - and then em is what you use for emphasis
09:22 - which is italics you can see there we go
09:24 - italics so those are the tags that we
09:26 - use for bold and italics strong and em
09:29 - and we're actually getting a lot of the
09:31 - way through this list so if you feel
09:32 - overwhelmed just remember we only have
09:34 - about 12 words we have to memorize html
09:37 - head title body
09:39 - p
09:40 - strong em
09:42 - and then we also covered our header tags
09:44 - and you're almost through basic html
09:47 - with just those words uh here's a fun
09:50 - one there's buttons i'm a button
09:55 - there we go we have a button looks like
09:57 - i got a typo in there somewhere yep got
09:59 - an extra little piece
10:01 - and you can click it
10:03 - we have a button there no style to it
10:05 - but there's a button on the page and the
10:06 - button also doesn't do anything because
10:08 - we don't have any javascript or anything
10:10 - telling the button what to do but hey
10:12 - the button is there all the same so
10:14 - that's all of our text tags i'm going to
10:16 - show you two more tags and then we're
10:18 - done with basic html we can actually
10:20 - start learning basic css from here on
10:23 - out so let's go and add a list tag these
10:26 - are actually really important so if i go
10:29 - li
10:29 - and say i'm an item
10:32 - you can see i kind of have a bulleted
10:34 - list right there yep i have a bulleted
10:36 - list
10:37 - and if i have multiple items i could
10:38 - either lay them out like that or i
10:41 - should if i have multiple items wrap
10:43 - them in a ul which is unordered list and
10:46 - now i have to select this and cut it and
10:48 - paste it because i did it in a weird
10:49 - order and you learned to get really good
10:51 - at those kind of things as a web
10:53 - developer so i have a ul tag
10:55 - with multiple li tags in it this is an
10:58 - unordered list and list items so that's
11:01 - what those stand for these would be
11:03 - things like a navigation a top
11:05 - navigation on your page you will define
11:07 - a list of things and then use css to lay
11:09 - them out as a navigation
11:11 - you can also change this to o l
11:15 - o l
11:16 - and you'll make it an ordered list which
11:18 - is not very useful you don't do this as
11:21 - often in html but you can see as soon as
11:23 - i changed it to ol i got number one
11:25 - number two added to my lis but usually
11:28 - li and ul is the combination you'll go
11:31 - for that creates a list of items and
11:33 - then you can use css to style that in a
11:35 - way you need to so there you go that's
11:37 - it that's all you need to know for html
11:40 - it's tags with attributes with tag names
11:44 - that's html in a nutshell let's start
11:46 - building an actual web page with style
11:49 - and look and feel in the next video
11:50 - we're going to get into css
11:57 - you
