00:00 - you want to talk mobile web Let's Talk
00:02 - mobile web shall we you've probably
00:04 - heard it said that it is a mobile first
00:07 - world and if you haven't heard it you
00:08 - just heard it and that's a very
00:09 - important saying in web development
00:12 - because it means that people are going
00:13 - to view your website on a mobile device
00:15 - as much or a lot more than on a desktop
00:18 - these days unless you're in a really
00:20 - unusual industry which actually I'm in
00:23 - uh web videos I don't get a lot of
00:24 - Mobile Traffic because people don't want
00:26 - to watch code on their phone but unless
00:28 - you're doing something really un usual
00:30 - like that it's a mobile first world uh
00:33 - the way your website looks on a mobile
00:35 - device is very important so it's said to
00:38 - build a great advice is to build your
00:41 - website for the mobile web first and
00:43 - then make it look good on desktop and so
00:45 - we're going to kind of show you some
00:46 - basic ways of how I'll approach some web
00:49 - development how I'll view the mobile
00:51 - experience in an easy way um and so
00:53 - let's get into it here's kind of my
00:54 - to-do list the first thing is I'm going
00:56 - to build it in the browser it's really
00:58 - nothing magical or mysterious about it
01:00 - let's say I have this web page which is
01:02 - basically I copied it from start
01:07 - bootstrap.css
01:11 - um and so once again start
01:16 - bootstrap.css
01:18 - like on the mobile experience I'm going
01:21 - to be using live reload I'm going to set
01:23 - that up up front uh not only for when
01:26 - I'm developing the mobile experience but
01:28 - later on it's going to be very useful
01:29 - when when I'm VI viewing it in devices
01:31 - you'll get to see that a little later so
01:33 - I have some videos in the description on
01:35 - how to use live reload you want to get
01:37 - that going it will help you out a lot
01:39 - it's not too hard to hit refresh here
01:41 - but later on when we're using multiple
01:43 - devices it's going to be really helpful
01:45 - to have live reload so I'm using Local
01:47 - Host
01:48 - 8080 I'm using live server in this
01:51 - example uh so you know now I can change
01:53 - instead of rocking new website let's
01:54 - just hit save rocking website uh let's
01:57 - say this site's going to kill it this
01:59 - site's going to really kill
02:01 - it all right cool that still fits in a
02:04 - mobile view and that kind of gives me an
02:06 - idea of what my website's going to look
02:09 - like so that's phase one nothing super
02:11 - amazing going on just resize your
02:13 - browser uh the next thing I'm going to
02:15 - do is some device specific emulating or
02:18 - profiling uh so what I'm going to do in
02:21 - Chrome Chrome's my favorite for this is
02:23 - I'm going to go developer tools and I'm
02:25 - going to click on this button right here
02:28 - and what this button will do is it'll
02:29 - allow me to select a model I can select
02:32 - the iPhone 6 I can toggle from portrait
02:34 - horizontal now whenever you select a new
02:37 - device it's a really good idea to reload
02:39 - your browser so the viewport gets
02:40 - updated and see it looks different after
02:43 - a refresh a lot of people forget to
02:44 - refresh when they change their device
02:47 - that's a very important thing that you
02:48 - want to do and then you can reload your
02:51 - Dimensions see what it looks like
02:52 - portrait and landscape um and another
02:55 - great feature is the network uh
02:58 - throttling which allows me to throttle
03:00 - my internet connection down to 3G and
03:02 - see what people are going to get on a 3g
03:04 - connection or God forbid the uh the
03:08 - security plagued 2G network so many
03:11 - security holes in the 2G network which
03:13 - is why the CIA loves using 2G that's
03:16 - another topic for another day um so
03:18 - there you go that's some device specific
03:20 - profiling what's it going to look like
03:22 - on an iPad and all that so that gives
03:24 - you a little bit of a better idea once
03:26 - again it's still pretty easy we're on
03:28 - our machine we can do some really rid
03:30 - development the next phase I'm going to
03:32 - start using an actual iOS simulator
03:34 - which I'm sorry you can only do on Mac
03:36 - if you're a PC user uh once you get into
03:39 - iOS development it really helps to drop
03:41 - that chunk of change to get a Mac so
03:43 - what we're going to do for this is we're
03:45 - going to go to the App Store and we're
03:47 - going to get xcode if you don't already
03:48 - have it it is free um but it usually
03:51 - doesn't come on a Mac um so that'll be
03:53 - an install I get the chance to update
03:55 - which I should do that will take forever
03:57 - to install because it's gigabytes of uh
04:00 - the the application is huge once you've
04:02 - installed
04:04 - xcode uh then we're going to go to
04:06 - Applications and you're going to right
04:08 - click or control click on xcode and do
04:10 - show package contents so we're now in
04:13 - the xcode package and we're going to go
04:15 - contents applications and there's an iOS
04:18 - simulator and we're just going to drag
04:20 - that out to our doc so now whenever we
04:22 - want we can just run the iOS
04:25 - simulator and this is actually going to
04:27 - boot up iOS on our machine so there you
04:29 - go it's it's huge I'm I'm not using my
04:31 - retina display right now but if I was
04:33 - this would not look so huge uh because
04:35 - the iOS 6 has a retina display so if I
04:39 - go to iOS 5 you can see it's a lot
04:40 - smaller there a lot more
04:42 - manageable um and there we go and I
04:45 - didn't want open pass book no go away ah
04:48 - Hardware home
04:49 - button um and so there you go I'm
04:52 - running an iOS I'm running a iPhone 5 uh
04:56 - for this sake let's run the iPhone 4
05:00 - there we go and now I can go to Safari
05:02 - and I can go to Local Host 8080
05:08 - here and I can view my website here an
05:11 - actual iOS exactly as it will look um I
05:14 - can also if I hold the ALT key I can do
05:17 - two finger gestures so or the alt option
05:20 - key so I can do two finger gestures
05:22 - there and if I'm holding the ALT key and
05:24 - I hold the shift key at any point you'll
05:26 - see they lock in position for like a
05:28 - two-finger scroll kind of thing so you
05:30 - can start that's kind of how you'll
05:32 - you'll view your website in an iOS
05:34 - simulator it's pretty quick uh it's
05:37 - still really nice to keep it on your
05:39 - device and another great thing is live
05:41 - reload will still work you can see
05:42 - that's kind of annoying looking uh so I
05:45 - can take a really back off of it hit
05:48 - save and live reload works on the iOS
05:51 - simulator which is great so in mobile
05:54 - view maybe I don't want the word really
05:55 - in there it creates an extra line that I
05:58 - don't like okay so that's good um the
06:00 - simulator for most of the time really
06:03 - gets the job done it's pretty accurate
06:06 - as to what it'll look like uh but if you
06:08 - want to actually look at it on your
06:09 - device that's pretty simple that's going
06:11 - to be the next step forward is I'm going
06:13 - to look at this on some actual devices
06:15 - so what I'll do is I will put those
06:17 - devices on the same network that I'm on
06:20 - I'll go to system preferences and I'll
06:22 - go to network here and then I will go to
06:26 - Advanced and I'm going to look at my IP
06:29 - add address which is right here
06:34 - 192.168.1.2 so that will be on my actual
06:37 - physical device iPads I you know iPhones
06:41 - Android devices whatever I can grab I'm
06:43 - going to grab them all one 192 and then
06:45 - I'm going to go here I'll just use the
06:47 - simulator for this part but this is
06:49 - going to work on my iPhone that's on the
06:50 - network as well
06:52 - 192.168.1 7 col 8080 so instead of Local
06:56 - Host I'm going to my IP address and
06:59 - there you go that's my actual website as
07:01 - well and so I can I will have sometimes
07:05 - five or six devices when I'm fine-tuning
07:07 - things I'll have the iPad up I'll have
07:09 - my iPhone up I'll have the Android up
07:11 - all on my desk um and they're all up on
07:13 - the website and so now when I go really
07:17 - going to really kill it when I hit save
07:19 - all those devices are going to live
07:20 - reload right there live reload is still
07:22 - going to work um and then they'll
07:24 - automatically just refresh my web page
07:26 - and I can see it and that's there's
07:28 - there's soft software and there's a
07:30 - bunch of tools that kind of simulate all
07:32 - this stuff for you they'll simulate your
07:34 - Android and they'll simulate your iPhone
07:37 - but honestly my favorite is is Let's do
07:40 - let's do it in the browser maybe pull up
07:41 - an emulator while we're developing this
07:44 - thing let's go as fast as we can and
07:46 - then when it's time to really check it
07:47 - out on devices just get the actual
07:49 - devices you know borrow a friend's
07:52 - Android and and just actually fine-tune
07:55 - it have one in the office if you're a
07:56 - company um have like your target you
08:00 - know five devices say we our goal as a
08:02 - company is we want this site to look
08:04 - good on these five devices and these are
08:06 - the ones we officially
08:08 - support and that's kind of how we'll do
08:11 - that so there's my thoughts on mobile
08:12 - web uh if you have any just awesome
08:15 - tools that you can't live without post
08:17 - them on here as well I would love to see
08:19 - them and I know a lot of people would
08:20 - love to see them as well so hope you're
08:22 - having a great day and that's my
08:24 - thoughts on mobile development
