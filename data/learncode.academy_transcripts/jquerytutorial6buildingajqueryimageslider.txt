00:01 - all right today we're going to be
00:02 - building a basic jQuery slider an image
00:05 - slider now there's a lot of great jQuery
00:07 - plugins out for there for this Flex
00:09 - slider royal slider all sorts of good
00:12 - ones they have more features than we're
00:13 - going to be able to build in a couple
00:14 - minutes uh but we're learning jQuery so
00:17 - this is a great example let's get into
00:19 - it um I have a slider here let me show
00:21 - you the HTML behind it I have a wrapper
00:23 - div with the ID of slider and then I
00:26 - have UL class slides and then I have a
00:28 - bunch of Lis that I'll have a class of
00:30 - slide um each one of these has just an
00:33 - image that I've put in there slider 1 2
00:36 - 3 4 5 and then I finished it with my
00:38 - first one as well they're going to be
00:40 - sliding to the left and I want the first
00:42 - one to be able to slide onto the screen
00:45 - at the very end we'll see what that
00:46 - means in a minute so here's the CSS
00:49 - driving it the slider wrapper has a
00:51 - width of 720 and any overflow is hidden
00:54 - and then all the slides are going left
00:56 - to right all the way out so the slides
00:58 - UL has a width of 6,000 pixels um and
01:03 - then all the slides float left so
01:05 - basically what you're seeing here is I
01:07 - can show you is if I were to make the
01:09 - margin
01:14 - left 100 pixels there you go so as the
01:17 - UL the uh the UL slides to the left with
01:20 - a a negative margin it's going to move
01:23 - there until we run out of slides and so
01:26 - basically all our JavaScript needs to do
01:28 - is move this U well back and forth um so
01:32 - that's the basics oh yeah and then when
01:34 - it gets to the end here let me go back
01:35 - up here when it gets to the end we need
01:38 - to somehow know that we are on the last
01:40 - slide and then boom go to margin zero uh
01:44 - and the user won't even notice it
01:45 - because it's the exact same slide so we
01:47 - need to go back to margin zero when we
01:48 - hit the last slide so let's get into the
01:50 - code uh one piece of code you'll need to
01:53 - know in JavaScript that if you don't
01:55 - know how to do it yet is set
01:57 - interval set interval takes two things
01:59 - things it takes a function and then it
02:01 - takes a time frame like let's say 1,000
02:04 - milliseconds which is 1 second and every
02:07 - th000 milliseconds it will fire this
02:08 - function so as an example I can do this
02:12 - I can go every th000 milliseconds we're
02:15 - going to log the date new date there you
02:19 - go and so you'll notice here in the
02:21 - console it's going to log the new date
02:23 - going up 1 second every time another
02:25 - thing you can do with set interval is
02:27 - you can save its value my interval
02:30 - equals that interval so now if I save
02:33 - that it's going to start over again um
02:36 - and now I can go clear
02:38 - interval my interval give it the one you
02:41 - want to clear and it stops it so that's
02:44 - kind of we don't want it to
02:45 - automatically run forever we want to
02:47 - have the ability to start it and stop it
02:49 - so we're going to save our interval and
02:51 - then we need to use jQuery to animate
02:53 - this slider and how you do that is you
02:56 - do I'll show you over here you do jQuery
03:01 - selector do
03:04 - animate and then you're going to give it
03:05 - an object which is all the CSS
03:08 - properties and what you want to animate
03:10 - them to you can animate more than one
03:11 - thing at a time but in our case we're
03:13 - just doing margin left uh a time frame
03:16 - again like how many milliseconds and
03:17 - then a call back uh which is if you want
03:20 - it to do something after the animation
03:22 - is complete the Callback function will
03:24 - be there so we can just
03:27 - go slider slides
03:32 - animate margin
03:36 - left to let's make it-
03:39 - 720 and then I'll give it let's do that
03:42 - over the course of one second there you
03:44 - go so now it just went to my second
03:46 - slide I can also do negative if I make
03:49 - it a string I can go negative equals 720
03:53 - and it's not going to go to- 720 it's
03:55 - going to keep minusing 720 every time I
03:58 - run that so so now it's going to keep
04:00 - minusing 720 keep minusing 720 um or I
04:04 - can just actually go to minus 720 which
04:07 - is slide number two if that made sense
04:09 - so let's go ahead and build out this uh
04:12 - thing here we're going to start by
04:13 - wrapping it in a jQuery document ready
04:17 - function which is what we always
04:19 - do and I also always like to start off
04:21 - with comments to set the stage for what
04:23 - I'm going to be building set interval is
04:25 - what I'm going to build here and in that
04:27 - interval I'm going to animate margin
04:30 - left and then I'm also going to if it's
04:33 - last slide go to position
04:39 - one which is zero
04:41 - pixels um and then I also want to add
04:43 - another feature I want to listen for
04:46 - Mouse enter and pause so if you hover
04:50 - over the slider I want it to pause and
04:51 - you know while I'm looking at that slide
04:54 - and then resume on Mouse
04:57 - leave so when I leave I want it to start
04:59 - sliding again so that's basically what
05:01 - my slider is going to be let's start
05:02 - building this
05:03 - out set
05:06 - interval and let's make it run every 3
05:10 - seconds and every 3 seconds I'm going to
05:13 - go
05:16 - slider slider slides.
05:20 - animate just what I showed you before
05:23 - margin left is going to go negative 7 no
05:25 - negative equals 720 pixels cuz I don't
05:29 - just want to go to negative 720 pixels I
05:31 - want to keep subtracting 720 every time
05:34 - and let's slide for about 1 second when
05:37 - we do that there we go let's actually
05:39 - save refresh and now we should be
05:41 - sliding every 3 seconds yeah over the
05:44 - course of a second feels good feels good
05:47 - but this is just going to keep going
05:48 - forever once we get to slide seven it
05:50 - doesn't know you're there it just keeps
05:52 - sliding so now we need to get a little
05:53 - bit smarter if it's the last slide go to
05:56 - position one uh one thing I'm going to
05:59 - do here is I'm going to start I don't
06:02 - like that all these configuration
06:04 - options are kind of scattered throughout
06:05 - the code that's kind of a bad idea so
06:08 - I'm going to start moving things up here
06:09 - I'm going to go
06:11 - width equals 720 which is the width of
06:14 - our slides which is set in the CSS it's
06:16 - 720 the the slides are all 720 um I'm
06:20 - going to go there animations
06:24 - speed equals
06:27 - 1,000 and then ver pause equals 3,000 so
06:31 - now I'm going to make this pause there
06:33 - we go animation
06:36 - speed and U I will just go - 720 plus
06:41 - width so that basically is the same as
06:44 - saying negative equals 720 except for
06:47 - now I'm just storing my 720 Pi so if if
06:49 - at any point time I want to change the
06:51 - configuration it's all in one place
06:52 - you'll notice the colors are starting to
06:54 - look a little different now all my
06:56 - yellows are up here um and there's not
06:58 - very many yellows down here that's a
07:00 - good sign that means all my
07:01 - configuration all the things of the same
07:03 - type tend to be in the same place not
07:05 - all code ends up looking this way but
07:08 - this is definitely a good side um
07:10 - another thing I want to do
07:14 - too uh save configuration is I want to
07:17 - do what's called caching the Dom I think
07:18 - I've covered this in some other videos
07:20 - uh but I don't want to have to look for
07:22 - slider slides every time I want to be
07:24 - able to look for it once and then just
07:26 - reference it every time so I'm actually
07:28 - going to go
07:30 - ver
07:34 - slider there we go so I searched the Dom
07:37 - and I found my slider I'm using the
07:40 - dollar sign here so I know it's a jQuery
07:43 - object um You can call it just slider um
07:46 - but I want to know that that's not a
07:48 - string or something I want to remember
07:49 - that that's a jQuery search so there we
07:52 - go slider equals that and now I can
07:54 - reference it later on so now every
07:56 - single time the interval fires I don't
07:58 - have to look for for my slider uh except
08:01 - for I'm not actually animating the
08:02 - slider I'm animating the slide
08:05 - container so let's get that slide
08:08 - container equals um and what I'm going
08:11 - to do is I'm going to go
08:12 - slider.
08:15 - find
08:16 - slides so I'm going to I've already
08:19 - searched all my webpage document and I
08:21 - found this guy and I've kept it track of
08:23 - it and now I just want to find a guy
08:25 - inside of it so I'm going to find slides
08:27 - inside that's a very fast oper ation um
08:30 - so now once again you're noticing I've
08:32 - only done my jQuery selector once so
08:34 - this is going to be a very fast and high
08:37 - performance piece of code um and then I
08:39 - want to go let's go slides as well
08:43 - equals
08:45 - um slide
08:48 - container yeah that's right
08:52 - find slide so that's going to be the
08:55 - whole list of my slide elements so this
08:58 - is actually slide Li
09:00 - container did I not spell that right
09:03 - nope I didn't container there you go I'm
09:06 - just going to copy paste that it's
09:08 - annoying to type that while I'm talking
09:10 - okay so there we go so just again to
09:12 - cover what I did here is I only searched
09:15 - my whole HTML web page once right there
09:18 - um and from there on I'm looking inside
09:20 - that piece that I found to find some
09:23 - specific things I will reference later
09:25 - so now every time it has to do the
09:27 - animation it just goes boom I already
09:28 - know where that is I'm going to find it
09:30 - and animate it it's a much faster piece
09:31 - of code so now what I need to do is I
09:35 - need to start checking afterwards to see
09:38 - if I'm on my Cur if I'm on the last
09:40 - slide or
09:41 - not um what I will do here is I'm going
09:44 - to add a
09:45 - callback remember I said the third thing
09:48 - you can pass to animate is a callback so
09:50 - once the animation is done I want to
09:52 - check if I'm on the last slide if I am
09:55 - on the last slide I go to the first
09:56 - slide so if
10:01 - um and I'm going to do this I'm going to
10:03 - let's do this let's go Plus+ or current
10:07 - slide wait I didn't sa current slide
10:11 - here current slide equals one always
10:13 - want to start on slide one so I'm going
10:15 - to go current slide plus plus so I'm
10:17 - boosting that up so the first time it's
10:19 - going to turn it to two then three then
10:21 - four every time I plus plus that it's
10:23 - just going to go up one number if
10:26 - current
10:27 - slide equals
10:31 - slides.
10:33 - length so if current slide is if we're
10:37 - on the last one current slide will be 1
10:39 - 2 3 4 5 6 and then if that is the same
10:44 - as my length uh which is the count so if
10:48 - I can show you
10:50 - that there's slide if I do slide. length
10:54 - then it's going to be six there are six
10:56 - slide elements on my page so if current
10:59 - slide is the same as slide
11:02 - length then we want to make current
11:05 - slide equals
11:07 - one we want to make sure that goes back
11:09 - to one and then we're going to go slide
11:13 - container um just CSS we're not going to
11:16 - animate this time we want it to happen
11:17 - immediately and we want it to happen
11:19 - behind the
11:21 - scenes we want to make the margin left
11:23 - zero okay so every time we animate we
11:27 - bump up our number of our current slide
11:29 - if it now equals our slides length uh
11:31 - then we're going to go back to number
11:32 - one that should work let's check it out
11:34 - and I'm going to set our pause to one
11:36 - second so this should happen faster uhoh
11:39 - slide contain coner is not fine right
11:43 - because I can't
11:45 - spell here we go slide
11:48 - container slide caner is still not found
11:52 - what the heck cannot type yep there we
11:57 - go all right so here we go we're sliding
12:00 - through every 1 second and then we
12:02 - should know here nice okay so once we
12:05 - got to the last one we realized that we
12:08 - were on the last one and we set this
12:10 - back to one and then we went to margin
12:12 - left zero great and that's going to get
12:15 - really annoying for it to move that fast
12:17 - so now all we have to do is add this
12:21 - we've taken these three out check check
12:23 - check let's just do that Mouse enter in
12:26 - that pause part and we're done with our
12:28 - slider uh this is actually going to be a
12:30 - little trickier than we think so let's
12:32 - go here slide
12:34 - container actually we're just going to
12:36 - do
12:37 - slider slider. on Mouse
12:42 - enter we're going to pause
12:47 - slider and then do on Mouse
12:52 - leave we're going to resume slider or
12:54 - start
12:56 - slider okay now the thing is is is we
13:00 - actually don't have a way of pausing our
13:01 - slider right now so what we need to do
13:04 - is let's actually make an
13:07 - interval this will be our thing that we
13:10 - start and stop and let's make a function
13:13 - for start slider and a function for stop
13:19 - slider so now I'm going to put this set
13:22 - interval within my start slider
13:26 - function interval equal set interval
13:30 - okay so now um whenever I click Start
13:33 - slider it's going to store my interval
13:35 - in this guy um I had to Define this
13:38 - outside of my function because if I did
13:41 - ver interval in here instead I can't
13:45 - access that interval anywhere outside of
13:47 - the function it's kind of within What's
13:48 - called the scope interval only exists
13:50 - within this function so now I can't talk
13:52 - to it from outside so what I had to do
13:54 - is I had to define interval
13:56 - here and now I can reference interval is
14:00 - talking to that guy so I can start
14:02 - slider and then function stop slider is
14:06 - easy stop slider is just going to clear
14:08 - the
14:11 - interval and that's why I had to define
14:14 - interval outside of my function because
14:16 - I have to be able to clear it um and I
14:19 - can show you in a little bit why that
14:21 - wouldn't work the other way so now we go
14:23 - I have my oh I called it pause slider
14:26 - didn't it well we're going to call this
14:27 - pause slider then
14:29 - I just call it
14:32 - stop so now when I Mouse enter over
14:35 - slider it's going to stop it and I Mouse
14:37 - leave it's going to start it um and
14:40 - guess what when I hit when I stop it and
14:42 - it refreshes uh when I save it and
14:44 - refreshes nothing happens because start
14:46 - slider is never being called so I need
14:48 - to at the very end of all
14:50 - things just start my
14:53 - slider now it should
14:56 - work great so it's it's sliding
15:00 - excellent now if I hover it should stop
15:02 - sliding of course I'll probably need to
15:03 - click on this okay if I
15:05 - hover there you go it stopped and now if
15:08 - I Mouse leave of course I just called it
15:11 - moose
15:13 - leave okay let's try this
15:16 - again it's paused let's pause it make
15:19 - sure it's paused it is paused let's
15:24 - hover and it should start up again
15:26 - excellent so let's just once again cover
15:29 - what we did to make sure it's not super
15:31 - confusing um and I'm going to just I
15:35 - don't know what I'm going to do with you
15:36 - I'm going to just comment you out so
15:38 - that thing doesn't slide all day all
15:41 - right so we made a function start slider
15:44 - stop slider so that way we could say on
15:47 - Mouse enter we're going to stop slider
15:49 - on Mouse leave we're going to start
15:50 - slider um and then we Define this
15:52 - interval thing here let me go um just
15:55 - for your learning about JavaScript if we
15:57 - did interval here here we just made
16:00 - interval a new variable but it's only
16:04 - going to stay within my function so stop
16:06 - slider will not work because when I hit
16:09 - clear interval it's not going to know
16:11 - where to find interval a function only
16:13 - has access to the variables inside of it
16:16 - and the variables up one level which are
16:18 - all these guys it's not going to have a
16:21 - it's not going to have access to
16:23 - variables defined inside of another
16:24 - function here let me show you this in
16:26 - operation right here so I'm going to
16:27 - save
16:29 - and I'm going to
16:31 - hover interval is not defined it says
16:35 - because it doesn't know what to
16:37 - do so when I try to stop the slider it
16:41 - can't find interval um and so there's
16:44 - your problem so we're just going to go
16:46 - ver
16:47 - interval we're just going to Define it
16:50 - and not give it any kind of value
16:52 - whatsoever and now everybody else can
16:54 - talk to it we can put values into it and
16:57 - we can mess with the values that are
16:58 - there so there you go that's how to
17:00 - build a jQuery slider um hope it made
17:03 - sense feel free to watch it again drop
17:05 - me some comments if there are things
17:07 - that don't make sense have yourself a
17:09 - great day
