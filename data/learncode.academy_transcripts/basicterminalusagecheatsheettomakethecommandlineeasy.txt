00:00 - all right a big part of being a web
00:02 - developer these days is using the
00:04 - terminal uh the terminal is something
00:06 - that creative and visual people kind of
00:08 - avoid uh in a lot of ways because it
00:11 - kind of there's no instruction manual
00:12 - there's no buttons to it and you it it
00:14 - feels like it's hard to wrap your mind
00:16 - around what all the terminal is we're
00:18 - going to break that down to a very low
00:20 - level it's very simple it's just a few
00:22 - basic commands uh to be really
00:24 - comfortable in the terminal so we're
00:26 - going to do that today and this will
00:28 - hopefully really help you out if you
00:29 - need open it you've never opened it
00:31 - before you're going to go
00:33 - applications uh utilities and then
00:36 - terminal and there it is and I'll drag
00:37 - terminal onto my doc so it's saved there
00:41 - um and here we are at our terminal and
00:43 - by default it's going to open us up to
00:45 - our Tilda directory which is our users's
00:47 - home directory let's get into our first
00:49 - command our first command is LS um and
00:52 - if you're on Windows that's going to be
00:54 - di for the most part these commands are
00:56 - going to be the same uh but this is
00:58 - really a Mac Linux
01:01 - um tutorial you may have to Google you
01:03 - know what the commands are but the
01:05 - principles are all exactly the same so
01:08 - here we go LS you can see this is my
01:10 - home directory for my user um and so LS
01:13 - is going to show me my list of all the
01:15 - files and the folders the next command
01:17 - we're going to use is CD CD is change
01:20 - directory I can go CD space
01:23 - pictures and LS and you can see this is
01:25 - my pictures directory for my home users
01:28 - I don't really have any pictures just my
01:30 - photo library and my photo booth Library
01:32 - um and then I can also go CD do dot
01:35 - which is going to go up a level into my
01:38 - previous directory so now I'm back to my
01:40 - user directory uh a hotkey that you can
01:43 - do is command K Apple K which clears out
01:46 - your terminal uh which is very useful
01:49 - command um you can see so I'm back to my
01:51 - home directory um you can also go CD
01:54 - forward slash which is going to take me
01:56 - to my root directory which is the same
01:58 - as just going Macintosh h D you can see
02:00 - that's this applications Library System
02:03 - blah blah blah that I'm now at my root
02:05 - directory so I can go back to my user
02:07 - directory or I can go there the long way
02:09 - which is CD space users
02:13 - cmn there we go I'm back at my cmn my
02:17 - home login directory so if I want to go
02:21 - to multiple directories at a time I can
02:24 - go CD space code I know I have a code
02:27 - directory sandbox I have a Sandbox
02:29 - directory test I just went into a up a
02:32 - level to code up a level to sandbox up a
02:35 - level to test I just went into that
02:38 - folder and if I hit LS I have one folder
02:41 - here called another folder so let's go
02:45 - ahead and make another directory here
02:48 - it's mkdir make directory
02:52 - mkd yet another
02:55 - folder so if I hit LS there we go yet
02:57 - another folder um I'm actually going to
03:00 - open this test folder that I'm in right
03:02 - now so you can see I made yet another
03:04 - folder let's make another
03:06 - one and
03:08 - again there we go and again so now I
03:10 - have three folders in here um if I want
03:12 - to remove a folder I can RM and again oh
03:17 - it's a it's a full directory so I have
03:18 - to use RMR which is recursive and again
03:23 - there we go so if I want to actually
03:25 - remove a file I can just use RM for
03:27 - remove um or I can use RM d r which will
03:30 - remove recursively anything inside of
03:33 - that entire directory so we're almost
03:35 - out of commands I know you're probably
03:38 - freaking out that this is all the
03:39 - terminal is it's LS it's CD it's make
03:43 - directory and it's RM that's pretty much
03:46 - it I'll get to show you a couple cool
03:47 - commands here but let's do one more and
03:50 - that is touch that will
03:52 - create a file for me so I touched
03:55 - index.html why put it under there I have
03:58 - no idea so I touched index.html that
04:00 - made a blank file called
04:03 - index.html I can open
04:06 - index.html and it will open it in
04:08 - whatever my default program for that is
04:10 - which in this case is Chrome so I get an
04:12 - empty page I can open
04:16 - index.html and if I do- a and then in
04:20 - these quotes I can put a program name it
04:23 - does it is case sensitive so I can't do
04:25 - lowercase Sublime Text I have to do
04:28 - uppercase Sublime upper case text and
04:31 - there we go here's my
04:33 - index.html so I can just kind of go I'm
04:36 - a web
04:38 - page save it close it so now if I open
04:41 - index HTML I'm a web page there we go um
04:46 - and I can also open it up in Sublime
04:48 - Text again and there it is I can edit it
04:50 - and save it this is actually pretty
04:52 - convenient uh I I'm using all the time
04:55 - now open commands from the command line
04:58 - because it's really conen convenient uh
05:00 - one thing you'll notice I'm doing is
05:01 - when I hit the up and down arrows it
05:03 - goes through all my previous commands
05:05 - another thing that's very very very
05:07 - useful uh because lots of times you'll
05:09 - just want to do a command over and over
05:11 - and over again and it's a lot easier to
05:13 - hit up um another thing you can do is
05:15 - open Dot that's going to open my current
05:18 - folder that I'm in which is test so if I
05:20 - hit open Dot it's going to open it in
05:22 - finder which is the default so let me
05:25 - show you again open Dot opens finder if
05:27 - you're ever in the com the command line
05:29 - and there's just something you want to
05:31 - do that's more convenient for you in in
05:34 - finder like say rename this yet another
05:37 - folders you know sometimes that's just
05:39 - easier for you to do in finder uh if
05:41 - you're not comfortable with a command
05:43 - line and you just want to open Dot I can
05:45 - also open Dot with application Sublime
05:49 - Text and that's going to take me to my
05:52 - whole folder you know so I got my whole
05:53 - folder view now in Sublime Text very
05:56 - very useful I can do that in any other
05:59 - program I want um and so that's a great
06:03 - command gosh we're almost out of basic
06:06 - command line commands uh pretty much the
06:10 - only other thing that we're going to
06:12 - want to do let's see we've done RM so
06:14 - let me list I will open Dots so we can
06:17 - see this happen in
06:19 - action so I can RM
06:22 - index.html let's delete it there we go I
06:25 - can rm- R my yet another folder
06:33 - uh whoops it's just called yet it's yet
06:34 - another folder Z I renamed it and if you
06:37 - want to rename things let me touch
06:40 - index.html again there it's back so what
06:42 - I can do is I can rename it that's MV
06:45 - it's called it's for move uh but move is
06:47 - actually how you rename it I'm going to
06:49 - rename index.html to index
06:53 - 2html there we go it just got renamed I
06:56 - can rename another folder
07:01 - this folder there we go it just got
07:03 - renamed so MV is your rename that's kind
07:07 - of counterintuitive to a lot of people
07:09 - but you're really not renaming the file
07:11 - you're moving the file to a different
07:13 - location uh as far as the command lines
07:16 - concerned you're moving it to a
07:18 - different URL or path so to speak uh so
07:22 - that's pretty much that I'll show you
07:23 - one more cool trick and we'll be done
07:24 - with this is at any point in time you
07:26 - can hit tab to autocomplete so if I want
07:29 - to to open in if I just hit I in and hit
07:32 - tab it's going to autocomplete that for
07:34 - me ah that saves so many typos
07:38 - especially if you have complex file
07:39 - names so if I go open in index 2html
07:44 - there we go it opened it if I go
07:51 - open I can't do it on uh program names
07:56 - unfortunately uh but I was able to
07:58 - autocomplete that for there and then I
08:01 - can also open this I can just hit tab
08:04 - this folder
08:08 - a there we go this folder is now open in
08:11 - Sublime Text so that's pretty much the
08:13 - commands CD you can go CD SL to go to
08:16 - your root directory you can go cd/ Tilda
08:19 - to go to your user directory LS is going
08:22 - to show you your file names mkd iir and
08:25 - these will all be in the description uh
08:27 - as your cheat sheet make directory
08:29 - rename a file or should I say move a
08:32 - file um and remove a file uh which you
08:35 - have to do SLR for directories that's
08:38 - your intro to the terminal do it play
08:40 - around use some commands have fun and
08:43 - know that you don't have to be afraid of
08:45 - the terminal anymore thanks have a great
08:47 - day
