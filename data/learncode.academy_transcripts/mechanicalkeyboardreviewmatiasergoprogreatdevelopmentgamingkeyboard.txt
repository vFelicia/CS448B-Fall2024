00:00 - hey guys over the next couple videos I'm
00:03 - going to be talking to you about
00:04 - mechanical organ ama keyboards now
00:07 - mechanical keyboards for those you guys
00:09 - who are not in the know are basically
00:11 - really premium-grade keyboards most
00:14 - keyboards these days cheap out on the
00:16 - key switches and give you rubber dome
00:18 - key switches now what's different about
00:20 - that is you don't feel the key press
00:22 - until you've maxed out all the way and
00:25 - hit the bottom just picture a rubber
00:27 - dome and when you press you eventually
00:29 - get enough force to pop it down and so
00:32 - when you've hit all the way to the
00:33 - bottom that's when the key is pressed
00:35 - and you also feel that pressure of
00:37 - bottoming out well mechanical key
00:39 - switches take cues from the olden days
00:42 - and they actually have a key switch that
00:44 - activates before you bottomed out and
00:46 - you feel it usually with a tactile force
00:49 - there's a lot of options and they give
00:51 - you this old kind of keyboard feel but
00:54 - they also give you this really premium
00:55 - kind of keyboard feel so today I'm going
00:58 - to be talking about a really cool one I
01:00 - kind of custom selected two of them and
01:02 - I really do mean a custom selected two
01:04 - keyboards to bring to you guys one of
01:06 - them is the matias / gopro keyboard i
01:09 - have the mac version here they also have
01:11 - a pc version but this is the matias a
01:13 - gopro and it is very cool for one as you
01:17 - can clearly see it can split into two
01:19 - which i love a keyboard that can now
01:22 - allow me to split out as my hands
01:24 - naturally rest which is something like
01:26 - this it also gives you the ability to
01:28 - keep your coffee in the middle which is
01:30 - actually surprisingly addictive and very
01:32 - useful to have in the middle of the day
01:35 - your coffee close you can also keep
01:37 - papers and notes and stuff in the middle
01:38 - you can also just make adjustments as
01:41 - your day goes on which is very cool and
01:44 - so this is also it feels much better on
01:46 - the wrists much more natural as you go
01:49 - this keyboard again it's Mattias
01:51 - ergo Pro keyboard I'll just kind of go
01:52 - through some of the specs and and why
01:54 - you might actually be interested in this
01:56 - besides the wow factor the fact that it
01:58 - splits apart for one there's just not a
02:01 - lot of great keyboards that are
02:02 - ergonomically dynamic but not a lot of
02:05 - great ones this one is definitely right
02:09 - away what I would classify as a great
02:12 - keyboard
02:12 - for several reasons one it's a
02:15 - mechanical keyboard as I mentioned
02:16 - before
02:17 - so the key switches are phenomenal and
02:19 - these ones are actually the Mattias
02:22 - quiet click which are arguably some of
02:25 - the best mechanical key switches in the
02:27 - business and they're amazing for two
02:29 - reasons one they give you a very very
02:31 - tactile response you feel that key press
02:34 - before you bottom out so as you get
02:37 - better and better on the keyboard you
02:38 - actually type lighter and lighter but
02:41 - you still get actually more response
02:43 - than if you were typing on a normal
02:45 - keyboard so that's very very cool and
02:48 - then it's also a very quiet tense the
02:51 - quiet click the Mattias quiet click key
02:54 - but it's also one of the best keys for
02:57 - office use which is one of the reasons I
02:58 - selected this as a great keyboard to
03:00 - demo to you guys because a lot of y'all
03:02 - are in an office setting and if you'd be
03:04 - interested in a mechanical keyboard they
03:05 - have a reputation for being loud and
03:07 - clicky which of course if your work from
03:09 - home err one of those guys whose beard
03:11 - is down to your knees and you've never
03:13 - showered or seen humanity for weeks
03:15 - that's awesome go with the clicky it
03:17 - feels incredible to have like a cherry
03:20 - MX blue where every key press gives you
03:23 - this satisfying click but that's just
03:26 - not a keyboard for most of us we really
03:27 - we work around coworkers and we're
03:29 - generally nice people and so we need
03:32 - something that's a little quieter so the
03:34 - Mattias quiet click Keys are one of the
03:36 - best choices of all time for a great
03:40 - office friendly mechanical key switch
03:43 - mechanical quick key switches are also
03:44 - rated to just millions and millions and
03:46 - millions a minute like 15 million clicks
03:48 - or something like that this thing is
03:50 - gonna last forever some other really
03:53 - great features about it are these palm
03:54 - rests these things are really nice they
03:57 - are stable and so the second you feel
03:59 - you feel like you have your own desk
04:02 - space that is attached to your keyboard
04:04 - and they also get several tinting
04:06 - options you can tent them a little bit
04:08 - of an angle which I personally love
04:09 - feels really nice
04:11 - you can also tint front down and both
04:13 - backs for kind of a negative forward
04:15 - angle I think that's a four and a half
04:17 - degree and if memory serves this is a
04:19 - nine degree tinting angle and so you can
04:21 - kind of have some options throughout the
04:23 - day as time goes on and then if your
04:25 - mother comes to her
04:26 - in your house or your grandmother's
04:28 - visiting it needs to update or Twitter
04:29 - and doesn't know how to use a split
04:31 - keyboard it does come straight together
04:33 - like that so very good very useful it's
04:36 - kind of a normal keyboard with the
04:38 - option of a great split keyboard now I
04:40 - will have to mention that they do have
04:41 - to plug together so in the spirit of
04:44 - clicky keyboards you get this nice
04:45 - clicky connector which connects them
04:48 - right there and then it connects with
04:49 - one USB some notable changes that they
04:53 - made to the normal keyboard layout aside
04:55 - from being split is that they gave you
04:58 - these dedicated undo cut copy paste
05:00 - buttons and they really reworked the
05:02 - navigation portion as a code or
05:05 - something use all the time as navigating
05:07 - with keys around the screen especially
05:09 - when you're in the terminal and mouse is
05:11 - just not very useful and this is very
05:13 - nice you have your home end page up page
05:15 - down right next to your arrow keys which
05:17 - makes for a very very nice experience as
05:20 - you're often needing to navigate around
05:22 - the screen so that's the Mattias
05:25 - ergo kirgo pro keyboard it's just a
05:29 - great keyboard some other cool features
05:31 - about it as laser-etched keys so these
05:33 - are never ever ever going to wear off
05:35 - they're laser etched they don't wear off
05:37 - and it also has n key rollover which any
05:40 - really fast typist will appreciate
05:43 - because you probably noticed that when
05:44 - you're typing really really fast there's
05:46 - a problem with modern keyboards and that
05:48 - they'll actually drop key presses when
05:51 - too many keys are pressed at the same
05:52 - time well n key rollover does defeat
05:54 - that that quirk and so as fast as you
05:57 - want to go this keyboard will have no
05:59 - problems keeping up with you let's wrap
06:02 - this review up with a great sound test
06:04 - so you can hear exactly how cool these
06:06 - keys are and hopefully give you a sense
06:08 - of just how good they feel but before I
06:10 - get to that I'll just kind of give you
06:11 - my personal experience on it
06:13 - I've been coding on this keyboard all
06:15 - week straight since I got my hands on it
06:17 - for review and it feels so good I mean I
06:21 - have for years was just a longtime fan
06:24 - of just a good old Apple what they call
06:27 - chiclet keyboards you know just nice
06:28 - quiet easy to do but I'll tell you what
06:32 - when you get when you get your hands on
06:33 - a mechanical keyboard and use it for a
06:35 - while you find yourself never wanting to
06:37 - go back day 1 day 2 you're fine
06:40 - day three you start to really kind of
06:42 - get addicted to that tactile a nice
06:44 - tactile feeling day four day five day
06:47 - six you find yourself getting very
06:48 - frustrated on a chiclet keyboard so
06:52 - let's get into some sound clips
06:53 - there's my review retailing I said right
06:56 - around 200 bucks it's not this massive
06:59 - dent to your wallet compared to a
07:00 - computer and you get to take it with you
07:02 - to every computer you own from here on
07:03 - out it's a great keyboard and I am NOT
07:06 - just saying that it is a phenomenal
07:08 - keyboard I'm not getting paid to tell
07:11 - you guys that the Mattias ergo Pro let's
07:14 - listen to some sound clips
