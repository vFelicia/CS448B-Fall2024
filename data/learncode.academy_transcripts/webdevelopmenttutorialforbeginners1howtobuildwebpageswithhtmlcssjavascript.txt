00:00 - So today we're going to get into how to
00:02 - do web development now and I want to
00:03 - draw a quick distinction before we get
00:05 - into stuff what's the difference between
00:07 - web design and web development uh and
00:10 - basically web design is more graphic
00:12 - design it means you work with Photoshop
00:15 - you make the look in the feel of the web
00:17 - page and then you give it to a developer
00:19 - they're going to take your look and feel
00:20 - and they're going to make the actual web
00:22 - page for you um the designers don't tend
00:25 - to get paid as much uh they don't tend
00:27 - to uh have as much opportunity to work
00:29 - remotely I used to be a designer and I
00:31 - moved on to development because it was
00:33 - just a better career to get into uh so
00:36 - that's kind of the difference also it's
00:38 - cheaper to be a web developer you don't
00:39 - have to buy $1,000 worth of Adobe
00:42 - Photoshop software uh all you need is
00:44 - notepad that's right notpad um except
00:47 - for you'll probably want to get
00:48 - something better than notepad we are
00:50 - going to be using Sublime Text um which
00:53 - is one of the best notepad kind of
00:56 - editors out there and it's free so go
00:58 - ahead go download Sublime text pause the
01:00 - video come back when you got it fired up
01:02 - and we're going to build a web page so
01:04 - what we're going to do is we're going to
01:05 - start by creating a new file in Sublime
01:07 - Text and saving it as
01:10 - index.html as you see here um we're
01:13 - basically you can call it whatever you
01:14 - want but the fact that we're calling it
01:16 - HTML means that when we open it up in
01:18 - Chrome it's going to know that it's a
01:20 - web page so it's going to show it as an
01:21 - HTML web page um and today we're going
01:24 - to be learning HTML uh later we're going
01:26 - to be learning CSS which is another
01:28 - skill you need to learn to be a web
01:29 - developer
01:30 - um and then later on you're going to
01:31 - learn JavaScript uh JavaScript is what
01:34 - uh HTML is what puts the content
01:37 - together for your page uh but it's going
01:39 - to be ugly because it's just content CSS
01:41 - is what puts together your style it
01:44 - stands for castaing cascading
01:46 - stylesheets so basically it gives look
01:49 - feel and style to your web page uh uh
01:52 - but we're not going to cover that today
01:54 - so what we're going to make today is
01:55 - ugly be prepared we're going to get into
01:57 - style later and then JavaScript is fun
01:59 - function it makes the web page do cool
02:01 - things uh load in data real time just
02:05 - like Pinterest does and like Instagram
02:07 - it makes things move around and animate
02:09 - JavaScript is where things get fun uh
02:12 - it's also where uh you get paid better
02:14 - if you learn HTML CSS uh you know you
02:17 - you get paid fine you get paid normal
02:19 - but if you get really good at JavaScript
02:22 - people are really looking for people are
02:23 - good at JavaScript you can get paid
02:25 - quite a bit and it's a lot easier to get
02:27 - remote work uh or very flexible work so
02:31 - with no further Ado we let's get into
02:34 - making an HTML page so you've saved your
02:38 - index.html now go to Chrome and open
02:40 - file open your index.html file where you
02:43 - saved it um mine shows Local Host
02:46 - because I'm using live reload basically
02:48 - whatever I type it's automatically going
02:50 - to refresh over here for me
02:53 - automatically for you you're going to
02:55 - have to hit save you're going to have to
02:56 - come over to Chrome you're going to have
02:57 - to hit refresh uh but I for the sake of
03:00 - this video I'm doing it differently so
03:03 - let's build an HTML page uh the core of
03:06 - HTML is tags basically that's all there
03:09 - is to HTML is tags a tag is basically
03:12 - something surrounded by greater than and
03:15 - less than kind of quotes and so this is
03:17 - an HTML tag and this is a closing HTML
03:21 - tag pardon me if you can hear my baby
03:24 - crying somewhere way in the background
03:26 - um I'm not sure what's going on out
03:28 - there but I'm sure Mom will take care of
03:29 - it
03:30 - um said like a good dad right so here we
03:33 - have HTML opening tag HTML closing tag
03:38 - uh tags are a little awkward to type at
03:40 - first because they use those keys down
03:42 - towards the bottom right that you don't
03:43 - use very often but I promise you'll get
03:45 - fast very quickly so basically anything
03:48 - in between these HTML tags is considered
03:51 - within the HTML tags um there's
03:54 - basically three tags that you're going
03:55 - to use to create a web page there's an
03:58 - HTML which means hey this is my HTML
04:01 - page anything inside of this is
04:02 - considered your web page um you're going
04:04 - to make a head
04:06 - tag which we'll get into in a little bit
04:08 - and you're going to make a body tag
04:10 - whatever's in the body tag is what your
04:12 - user will see and interact with so I'm
04:14 - going to put in here hello
04:18 - world and now I have a web page
04:20 - congratulations you're web developer and
04:23 - you're probably thinking wow this is
04:25 - kind of complicated it's all this code
04:27 - looking stuff don't worry it looks like
04:29 - a foreign language at first but
04:31 - seriously within five times you're going
04:34 - to feel very comfortable there's only
04:37 - like 10 tags maybe 20 at the most you're
04:40 - going to use and they're all tags you
04:42 - just have to remember a different word
04:44 - so far all we've actually done is
04:46 - created three tags we made an HTML tag
04:50 - we put a head tag with inside of it and
04:52 - we put a body tag with inside of it as
04:54 - well and these are considered siblings
04:56 - they're next to each other I'm also
04:58 - going to add a title tag
05:00 - tag and inside of the title I'm going to
05:03 - put my web
05:05 - page and I can't type today my web page
05:09 - and now you look at the top when you
05:10 - refresh it says my web page at the top
05:13 - of your web page or your tab so once
05:16 - again the head is not what the user
05:17 - interacts with this is all reserved for
05:19 - other stuff um which is why the title
05:23 - goes up there and so the body is what
05:25 - the user interacts with and we did hello
05:27 - world and the rest of our example will
05:29 - be adding other tags in here so let me
05:32 - show you kind of some other tags this is
05:35 - bold so we're going to wrap bold it's
05:37 - called wrapping it in B
05:41 - tags and now you can see that bold is
05:44 - bold because I wrapped it in B which
05:46 - stands for
05:47 - bold em is what we're going to use for
05:52 - italic and uh em basically stands for
05:55 - emphasis it used to be people would use
05:57 - I it also works but that is not the
06:00 - correct way to do it anymore um do not
06:03 - show a prospective employer that cuz
06:05 - it's not good so B is for bold em is for
06:09 - italic and then um let's see actually
06:14 - strong I can't believe I did this strong
06:17 - is what we're going to use for bold we
06:19 - used to use B and we used to use I and
06:23 - we used to use U for underline but now
06:25 - we use strong for bold and we use em for
06:28 - italics and we started doing this when
06:30 - we started getting into mobile devices
06:32 - and devices that might not actually have
06:34 - the capability of rendering bold or
06:38 - italics and so we needed some other way
06:40 - to let the user know or maybe it's a
06:42 - screen reader uh that you should display
06:46 - it in whatever way you can so but for
06:49 - the most part strong is always bold em
06:51 - is always italic that's about all you
06:53 - need to know so we've covered bold and
06:55 - italic now let's get into a critical tag
06:58 - the a tag
07:00 - that makes a hyperlink to another web
07:02 - page when you click on it so we're going
07:04 - to make a google.com and guess what it
07:06 - doesn't go anywhere uh that's because it
07:08 - doesn't know where to go uh one thing
07:11 - that some tags need is what's called
07:13 - attributes we've defined an a tag but
07:16 - this a tag doesn't know enough about
07:18 - itself to know where to go we know
07:21 - what's inside of it google.com text but
07:24 - we need to know where to go so we're
07:26 - going to add an href attribute you add
07:28 - an attribute by doing equals and then a
07:31 - pair of quotes and whatever's inside of
07:33 - the quotes is setting the hre
07:37 - so google.com there you go and look
07:40 - magically now I'm underlined and I have
07:42 - that purple color because I've been to
07:44 - google.com before and look I can now go
07:46 - back and forth from google.com to my web
07:49 - page all like that you're now a web
07:51 - developer it's tremendous so let's do
07:54 - another tag an IMG for image and this
07:58 - one needs to know what the source of the
08:00 - image is I'll leave that blank for now
08:03 - and that's all an image tag is for the
08:06 - source I'm going to go look something up
08:08 - on
08:10 - Google and let's just look up an image
08:12 - of Simon
08:15 - cow sure everybody loves Simon right why
08:18 - not let's view image I'm going to copy
08:21 - the
08:23 - URL why won't you let me close I don't
08:26 - know okay my computer's acting strange
08:29 - hit save and look there we go google.com
08:33 - link and a nice link to Simon cow's web
08:39 - website see if I can close this there we
08:42 - go um so basically that's your core tags
08:46 - uh another thing you'll probably notice
08:48 - is is these are not coming onto new
08:51 - lines like we've typed them out at first
08:53 - that doesn't make sense and it seems
08:55 - very bad uh but later on you'll realize
08:57 - it's very very good how HTML works is is
09:01 - it does not recognize anything except
09:04 - for how you program it to go so unless
09:07 - you say it with tags it doesn't know
09:09 - what to do and that's because these
09:11 - things can get huge or sometimes they'll
09:14 - get word wrapping like this and it just
09:16 - doesn't know what to do so it's not
09:18 - going to make any guesses for you if you
09:20 - don't say line break which is a br tag
09:23 - it doesn't line break so there we go I
09:25 - added a br tag and now it's bold whoops
09:28 - I want to add a another line break
09:30 - because right now Simon cowl is on the
09:32 - same line as all the other friends so
09:33 - I'm going to
09:37 - be there you go so now we got this is
09:40 - bold line break this is italic
09:43 - google.com line break and an image
09:45 - that's kind of how you start structuring
09:47 - your web page and you're probably
09:49 - thinking this is ugly this doesn't feel
09:52 - like building a web page uh but this is
09:54 - about as complicated as HTML gets for
09:57 - real I'm not making it up HTML is not
10:00 - much more complicated than this you just
10:02 - have to remember a few tags a few
10:05 - attributes like href and source and
10:08 - that's about it I can show you a few
10:11 - more tags here uh UL is something you'll
10:14 - use a lot that stands for unordered list
10:17 - um and inside this you'll add Lis um so
10:21 - here I've added An Li which stands for
10:23 - line item um item
10:28 - one
10:29 - item
10:31 - two and now you see we've got our you
10:33 - know I'm going to get rid of Mr Simon
10:35 - nobody likes to see him for very long
10:38 - anyway okay there we go so now we've got
10:41 - an unordered list which by default is
10:43 - just going to display with bullet points
10:46 - uh item one item two uh you can style
10:49 - these a lot of different ways so you're
10:51 - going to use the UL a lot anytime you
10:53 - have a list of items you're going to use
10:55 - a UL with Lis inside of it um a drop
10:58 - down naig ation is a list of items
11:00 - you'll use ulli um an actual navigation
11:04 - is a list of items you'll use ulli a
11:06 - list of MP3s in a fake MP3 player online
11:10 - uls with Lis um another thing very
11:14 - similar is
11:16 - ol's and that's un and that is ordered
11:19 - list and that actually by default is
11:21 - going to spit out numbers for each item
11:23 - you don't really use this one very often
11:25 - but it's helpful to know that it
11:27 - exists uh we're almost out of tags
11:30 - honestly folks uh there's div tags which
11:32 - you use a lot but we're not going to
11:35 - show you that's basically for styling so
11:37 - we're going to leave it untouched right
11:39 - now span tags you'll also use a decent
11:43 - bit but once again that is for styling
11:45 - so that is about as complicated as HTML
11:49 - gets all you have to do is get
11:51 - comfortable typing in tags um and you're
11:56 - pretty much an HTML developer uh
11:59 - paragraph tags those are important and
12:01 - header tags and then we'll be done P P
12:04 - is for paragraph that's another way to
12:07 - kind of separate text let's say we added
12:09 - this four
12:12 - times it's starting to get all
12:16 - messy and I forgot to close these p and
12:19 - each P and a slash P there we go so
12:22 - inside of this
12:24 - paragraph We have this I don't know what
12:26 - that did right there inside of this
12:28 - paragraph We have a block of text for
12:31 - each one you'll see the paragraph
12:33 - automatically kind of created its own
12:35 - space on either side paragraphs are
12:38 - usually the way you're going to want to
12:39 - add fresh line breaks usually you don't
12:41 - want to use the BR tag um like we're
12:44 - using
12:45 - there uh but it has its purposes as well
12:48 - BR creates a line break as you can see
12:51 - here and P creates a fresh paragraph
12:54 - with space on either side the only other
12:56 - tags you're going to use are header tags
12:58 - they start with h depending on how big
13:01 - you want the header to be you'll use H1
13:02 - for the
13:05 - biggest H2 is smaller than
13:10 - that and H3 and so on down to about H6
13:14 - or
13:15 - so it's pretty rare to have headers
13:17 - Beyond in six different sizes you're
13:19 - probably pretty bad at design if you're
13:21 - doing
13:26 - that and when it refreshes there you go
13:29 - big not so big not really big and then
13:30 - we're down to our normal text so that is
13:34 - HTML design so our next thing we're
13:38 - going to cover style so you can actually
13:40 - not feel like a fake developer you get
13:43 - to feel like a real developer in the
13:44 - next one as we start to style our things
13:47 - CSS gets a little more complicated so
13:49 - I'd encourage you take a little time
13:51 - make some links make some different web
13:53 - pages um and just have fun with HTML for
13:57 - a little while before you move forward
13:59 - in our next one we're going to do a
14:01 - little bit more advanced HTML and we're
14:03 - going to do a little bit more
14:06 - Style
