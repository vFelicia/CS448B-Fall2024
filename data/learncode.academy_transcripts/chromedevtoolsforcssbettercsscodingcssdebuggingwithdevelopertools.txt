00:01 - okay so in this video we're going to be
00:02 - doing Chrome Dev tools we're going to be
00:05 - using Chrome Dev tools to enhance our
00:07 - CSS coding uh to take it to the next
00:10 - level make the workflow a little easier
00:12 - also give us the ability to see what's
00:14 - going on on somebody else's site and
00:16 - bring those CSS rules over to our site
00:18 - easily so let's say I got this site here
00:21 - uh basic bootstrap three panel layout
00:23 - looks like Factory bootstrap if you
00:26 - haven't seen the bootstrap video check
00:28 - it out now you're going to get your mind
00:30 - blown on how awesome bootstrap is I'll
00:32 - put that in the
00:33 - description um this should look familiar
00:35 - to you otherwise basic bootstrap stuff
00:38 - so I mean by default your theme with
00:41 - bootstrap will give you several things
00:43 - let's say I want to make this one
00:45 - special and this one dim you can go
00:47 - panel success which is this these are
00:50 - based off the colors of your theme uh
00:53 - warning that's a yellow primary these
00:56 - are all going to come from your
00:58 - bootstrap theme that you're using those
01:00 - are great but let's say I really want it
01:01 - to be something unique in my own um so
01:04 - I'm going to leave that panel default
01:06 - and I'm going to go panel special and
01:07 - we're going to build a rule on top of
01:09 - bootstrap you don't want to modify
01:11 - bootstrap just so you know don't want to
01:13 - modify bootstrap bad idea bad practice
01:16 - if they ever upgrade it you're going to
01:17 - get in big trouble you're not going to
01:19 - be able to do it so you want to build on
01:21 - top of it with your own customized rules
01:23 - so I'm going to make panel special and
01:25 - we're going to build out a rule for
01:26 - panel special to make this thing look
01:28 - you guessed it special
01:30 - so the first thing I'm going to do is
01:31 - I'm going to come over here and I'm
01:32 - going to rightclick and do inspect
01:34 - element in Chrome and that opens up Dev
01:36 - tools Let's Go full screen here Dev
01:39 - tools is what Chrome gives you Mozilla
01:41 - Firefox also gives you something pretty
01:43 - similar to this uh some features better
01:46 - some features worse um also IE has it
01:49 - pretty much of all the devs I know most
01:51 - people prefer Chrome nobody prefers IE a
01:55 - couple people prefer Milla firefox's Dev
01:58 - tools find the one you like this is
02:00 - about Chrome so when I right clicked and
02:02 - inspected the element it gave me the
02:04 - panel heading which was the thing I
02:05 - clicked on you can see this is the HTML
02:07 - that I actually had going on there uh a
02:10 - couple cool things you can do is you can
02:11 - real time you know right click and start
02:13 - changing your
02:16 - HTML very special panel um kind of like
02:18 - what I'm doing with live reload uh you
02:21 - can also delete a
02:23 - node um actually delete a whole node you
02:25 - know just start actually real time
02:27 - modifying your HTML code you can right
02:30 - click and do edit as HTML and instead of
02:32 - a div we'll change it to a
02:37 - button ah if I could
02:40 - type there you go now we have some
02:42 - awkward button there so real time you
02:44 - can change your HTML I'm going to
02:45 - refresh my page it doesn't actually
02:48 - change your file it just reloads what
02:51 - you're seeing at the time so if you ever
02:53 - hit refresh be careful it's going to
02:55 - clear everything you've adjusted in the
02:57 - meantime I have made that mistake
02:59 - several times or if you're using live
03:00 - reload you come over here and hit save
03:03 - and ah all my Styles got tweaked um and
03:06 - now it just reloaded so be careful of
03:09 - that um let's say once again we want to
03:11 - make this thing special so I can also
03:13 - when I click on each element I can see
03:15 - every CSS rule that is applying to that
03:18 - element all in a row here and as you can
03:21 - see it's quite a few and they're all
03:22 - coming from bootstrap because bootstrap
03:24 - has just got a lot put into it this has
03:27 - some you know body styles that affect
03:29 - every element on there you can see it's
03:31 - inherited from body keeps going up the
03:34 - list and then there's some Styles
03:36 - directly on panel heading um you can
03:39 - real time change any of these let's
03:41 - change the background color to a reddish
03:43 - border color to a whitish uh if you're
03:45 - going more for the design at the moment
03:47 - these will really help you know you
03:50 - quickly flush out design stuff even
03:52 - faster than if you're using live reload
03:54 - you can turn Styles off you know so I
03:57 - can turn off my border radius that
03:58 - little I think it's a yeah three pixel
04:01 - rounded Corners I can turn those off
04:03 - turn off my padding yeah don't want to
04:05 - do that um you can just kind of see what
04:07 - happens and if you want to actually
04:09 - click you can see where they're coming
04:10 - from I'm using bootstrap minified so
04:12 - it's one Big Blob of CSS not very
04:15 - helpful
04:17 - there um let's say I want to build my
04:20 - own we can't modify these because these
04:23 - are coming from bootstrap and we're not
04:25 - going to modify bootstrap so I'm G to
04:27 - actually build my own panel special
04:29 - class so let me go ahead hit refresh
04:31 - here I'm going to start building out
04:33 - element style here and we're going to
04:35 - start on panel heading so I'm going to
04:37 - go
04:38 - background red color
04:42 - white um and then let's go tweak these
04:45 - to be a more pleasant red since that
04:48 - default red is hideous make that
04:50 - slightly off white there we go that
04:52 - looks nice I'm also going to go
04:55 - border border radius zero to get those
04:58 - square corners just to make it different
05:01 - I'd probably want to do that sitewide
05:02 - but whatever so you notice it entered
05:04 - those in it converted them to RGB colors
05:06 - which is fine you can use either one and
05:09 - also gave me this inline style thing so
05:11 - I can double click on that and copy them
05:13 - which is great and now come to my CSS
05:16 - file panel special and we are actually
05:19 - on panel heading
05:26 - so panel special panel heading copy
05:29 - those files in there hit save it
05:31 - refreshes and I got them awesome so
05:34 - let's go ahead and tweak this body a
05:35 - little bit let's go
05:38 - background color I'll make color red too
05:43 - um and let's go background red let's go
05:46 - give it a nice little Pleasant
05:49 - color and I'm feeling special it's
05:52 - working um let's go border radius zero
05:56 - and this won't work I want to get rid of
05:58 - these rounded Corners I already know it
06:00 - won't work cuz I tried this ahead of
06:02 - time um and oh no I changed border
06:05 - radius to zero and it didn't happen
06:08 - where is that coming from and this is
06:10 - something you ask yourself when you're
06:11 - coding CSS all the time where the heck
06:14 - is that style coming from because this
06:16 - should have overwritten it and it didn't
06:18 - overwrite it so I'll scroll down I'm on
06:21 - panel body I scroll down there's no
06:23 - border radius on here another thing you
06:25 - can do is you can click on
06:27 - computed and you can see here um
06:31 - computed style are all the ones that
06:32 - it's inheriting from I will get to
06:35 - computed in a little bit um so I'm
06:37 - checking out Styles border radius has
06:38 - not been defined anywhere so well
06:41 - clearly I don't need that so I'll delete
06:43 - you and so now what you got to do this
06:45 - is what this inspector for is I'm going
06:47 - to start going up the chain so the panel
06:49 - body I must be getting border radius
06:51 - from this element up here let's go up an
06:53 - elements and yep there you go border
06:55 - radius of four pixels so we are able to
06:59 - take this for panel body let me copy
07:02 - that
07:07 - out panel
07:10 - body copy those in I hate the white
07:13 - space but oh well and now we should be
07:16 - looking yep now I got our colors when it
07:18 - refreshes yep so all we need to do is
07:20 - get that border radius zero on the
07:22 - actual panel special
07:28 - element
07:31 - and that should take care of it yep
07:33 - there we go now we got square square
07:35 - corners everywhere so it helped us debug
07:37 - that and like I said once again what
07:39 - you're going to get all the time is
07:40 - where is that padding coming from I set
07:42 - padding to zero on this it must be
07:44 - coming from up here um and let's look at
07:47 - this computed tab here real quick
07:49 - computed will show you 100% of the
07:52 - styles that are applying to that element
07:56 - and so here's color you can actually
07:58 - drop it down and and see the whole so
08:00 - you can see it's coming from panel is
08:02 - getting a transparent color and then
08:04 - panel default is overriding it which is
08:06 - why that struck out with this uh gray
08:09 - color right there so if I go panel
08:11 - heading and I go background color you
08:14 - can see panel default is going to give
08:16 - us that F5 F5 and panel special is
08:19 - overriding it so that's another way you
08:21 - can kind of look through and see you can
08:23 - also see that this panel special Ru is
08:25 - coming from my CSS inspect stylesheet uh
08:28 - whereas this is coming from the
08:29 - bootstrap file so that's kind of how
08:31 - you're going to use this um kind of
08:35 - going to how you're going to use this
08:37 - inspector for CSS stuff let's say
08:39 - there's a style there's a let's go to
08:42 - csst tricks.com and see if there's
08:46 - something on here that we want to
08:48 - snatch that must not be the CSS tricks
08:51 - what is his
08:53 - website great guy CSS Dash tricks great
08:57 - website great stuff on here let's say
09:00 - I'm like ooh that hover thing is Nifty
09:02 - let's look at that and see what rule
09:04 - that U made that thing glow when I
09:06 - hovered over it so let's see if we can
09:09 - find what that is uh this looks like it
09:12 - is div class logo let's click on that
09:16 - and then another thing you can do is you
09:18 - can click on here and see what happens
09:20 - on
09:22 - Hover and that will automatically turn
09:24 - hover on okay nothing changed when I
09:27 - turned hover on so let me look at Dash
09:29 - tricks and see if that changes when I
09:31 - turn hover on that didn't change when I
09:33 - turned hover on let's keep looking
09:39 - here there we go this a when I click on
09:44 - Hover then you can see the glow starts
09:47 - coming on so it's in the hover element
09:50 - and let's go find out where that
09:56 - is color hover text
09:59 - decoration you're just going to start
10:01 - looking through all these and I'm going
10:02 - to start turning these off till I can
10:04 - find out which one makes the glow go
10:08 - away that's not it that's not it oh you
10:12 - know what it is it's when the hover is
10:14 - on the a I'll bet you anything I now see
10:18 - there we go that's it so let me tell you
10:20 - what I just did here is I could tell
10:22 - okay there's nothing in the
10:24 - a that is causing that glow to come on
10:28 - but
10:29 - it's when the hover is turned on the a
10:31 - that the glow appears so that means
10:33 - there must be a rule inside as well I
10:36 - don't know if I'm making sense here but
10:37 - I'll show you what it is is there's a a
10:40 - hover span so when we're hovering over
10:42 - the a the span is going to get its own
10:45 - Rule and that's where it is it's going
10:47 - to get that text Shadow I want that I
10:50 - need this so I'm going to copy text
10:54 - Shadow and then I'm going to say let's
10:57 - just go text shadow
11:02 - and now I have it all the time let's go
11:04 - back here o it's glowing awesome I
11:07 - snatched it but I only want it when I
11:08 - hover over it so I'm going to
11:13 - go panel
11:15 - special I'll basically just rip off what
11:18 - he did
11:19 - panel special hover so I'm hovering over
11:22 - panel
11:23 - special then my panel
11:26 - heading is going to get that
11:29 - so that should give me
11:31 - nothing here we go I want to hover ha
11:34 - got it and then it glows and it's
11:37 - special so that's kind of a really quick
11:40 - I don't know if I confused you on the
11:42 - whole hover part um but that's kind of
11:44 - how you use this to start seeing what's
11:46 - going on with that I want to copy that
11:49 - onto my site um that's a pretty much
11:53 - basic intro to how to use CSS for Dev
11:56 - tools going to put up some other videos
11:58 - here for bootstrap at the end and have
12:00 - yourselves a great day bye
