00:00 - hey everybody i have huge news for you
00:02 - see that rocket ship going to saturn
00:04 - yeah that's how big this news really is
00:06 - uh docker is seriously awesome it's my
00:09 - favorite most preferred way to package
00:11 - and deploy applications of any kind if
00:13 - you've been following me on twitter you
00:15 - know that i really really like docker
00:17 - and you're like dude i've been hearing
00:18 - that i'm like yeah you have because it's
00:20 - right it's really true
00:22 - so
00:23 - i've been working on a way to help you
00:24 - get past the docker basics there are so
00:26 - many hello world application tutorials
00:29 - out there with docker but it's hard to
00:31 - find good information to get you past
00:33 - those basics so i've been making a
00:35 - course called
00:36 - real world docker see how that flew in
00:38 - that was really cool so i'm going to do
00:39 - it twice
00:41 - awesome and that guy there with the pen
00:43 - in the paper that illustrates that i've
00:44 - been working really hard on this course
00:46 - because i have it's a lot more work to
00:48 - put together a full course than to throw
00:50 - together a couple hello world tutorials
00:53 - so i've been doing it with o'reilly
00:55 - media they're awesome they put out great
00:57 - stuff they're those animal book people
00:59 - yeah they really like animals i think
01:01 - that's a goat or maybe it's a yak i'm
01:03 - not really sure it might be a male sheep
01:05 - but anyway they love their animals and
01:08 - they put out great web content if you're
01:10 - familiar with them again the course is
01:12 - called real world docker we've recently
01:13 - released it and it's going to be super
01:15 - cool it's going to take you from feeling
01:17 - scared confused and alone from only
01:20 - knowing those docker basics that you see
01:21 - on those hello world tutorials to not
01:24 - feeling so scared so confused and so
01:26 - alone to get that confidence to actually
01:29 - deploy a docker application into
01:31 - production and then it's going to get
01:33 - you to the point of wow bring on the
01:34 - millions of users because i just scaled
01:36 - this application to handle massive
01:38 - traffic load
01:39 - and you get lots of code that's right
01:42 - lots of code any code that we use in any
01:44 - of the examples you get to take home and
01:46 - copy and paste and mess with and hack
01:48 - it's all yours so what will you actually
01:50 - learn well you're going to learn docker
01:52 - deployments everything from really
01:53 - simple single monolithic applications
01:55 - with continuous deployment that means
01:57 - you merge it to the master branch and it
01:59 - goes out to production merge it to the
02:00 - staging branch and it's on staging
02:03 - you're also going to learn how to break
02:04 - that app up into microservices which can
02:06 - scale much better in a large scenario
02:09 - and you're going to learn some of the
02:09 - deployment strategies that huge
02:11 - companies like netflix use when they're
02:13 - deploying services across a large
02:16 - infrastructure you're also going to
02:17 - learn networking and service discovery
02:19 - so you can swarm multiple servers
02:21 - together to act like one deployment
02:23 - platform then you can run apps on any
02:24 - one of those servers and everything just
02:26 - talks together just fine and you'll also
02:29 - learn immutable and disposable
02:30 - infrastructure which basically means you
02:32 - don't fix servers and apps when things
02:34 - go wrong you just destroy them and
02:36 - replace them and with continuous
02:37 - deployment you actually do it all the
02:39 - time it's a great way of deploying your
02:41 - application infrastructure you're
02:43 - thinking wow that's cool you're right
02:45 - that's actually my next slide it's so
02:48 - cool thank you for bringing that up so
02:50 - again it's called real world docker the
02:52 - link is in the description and also you
02:54 - can go to o'reilly.com and search for
02:56 - real world docker it's also available on
02:59 - safari books if your company provides
03:00 - you with a safari books membership and
03:03 - so go check it out you're going to love
03:04 - the course it's going to help you out a
