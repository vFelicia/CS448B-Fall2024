00:00 - in this video we're going to move beyond
00:02 - a single component and we're going to
00:03 - build an entire layout made completely
00:05 - of react components
00:07 - so our client js really shouldn't and
00:09 - doesn't need to have our layout in it so
00:12 - let's go ahead and cut that out of the
00:13 - picture our first step is we're going to
00:15 - make it into its own component so i'm
00:16 - going to make a new folder in the js
00:18 - directory called components
00:22 - and in that components i'm going to make
00:24 - a new file
00:25 - paste that in and let's save this
00:28 - as layout.js
00:31 - and i'm actually going to capitalize it
00:33 - because as a standard rule of thumb you
00:35 - always want components to have a capital
00:38 - letter be capitalized
00:40 - again import react i don't need react
00:42 - dom
00:45 - and there we go let's go full screen for
00:46 - this so now i have my layout all i have
00:48 - to do is export my class that i've
00:51 - created
00:53 - so i can require it now into client js
01:01 - components
01:04 - layout
01:05 - and now this rest will work as intended
01:08 - i can probably clean up that space there
01:10 - don't need it anymore so now i've got
01:12 - importing layout i'm exporting layout
01:13 - let's save and make sure it still works
01:15 - yep everything still works as expected
01:18 - great so let's go ahead and create the
01:20 - rest of our page now so we have our
01:22 - layout
01:24 - and then let's go and create a header
01:26 - and a footer i'm going to go ahead and
01:27 - just save this as header.js
01:31 - there we go we have our header js so i'm
01:33 - going to change this name to header
01:36 - and we'll get rid of this whole
01:37 - constructor function
01:40 - and will return a header tag
01:47 - i'll just leave that there for now
01:49 - excellent that's in place let's go ahead
01:51 - and import that into our layout
02:00 - i'll get rid of this constructor mess as
02:02 - well
02:03 - and we're returning our one div
02:08 - we're printing header again it's
02:10 - capitalized
02:12 - and i can use it straight there in the
02:14 - html because it's a component components
02:16 - can render anywhere in the html that you
02:18 - want you can see i've got header going
02:21 - and again the reason we capitalize
02:22 - components as a standard is because
02:24 - they're a constructor the header is not
02:26 - a rendered
02:28 - dom element yet it's a it has the
02:30 - capacity to render out a dom element
02:33 - whenever we print it so i could do this
02:35 - and this and this and it's going to
02:36 - render out three completely different
02:38 - elements later on we'll get into showing
02:40 - you how you can pass unique
02:42 - details and information into each one of
02:45 - these and make them actually render into
02:47 - three different looking headers
02:49 - another option you have if you want to
02:50 - render multiple versions of something
02:52 - is i could call this a list i could do
02:55 - an array
02:58 - and i could make it an array of three
03:00 - dom elements
03:02 - which is very useful for something like
03:04 - a list full of lis
03:06 - and then i could just go list
03:09 - and jsx is smart enough to know that
03:11 - that is an array of three components so
03:13 - let's render each one as components so
03:15 - that's what you would do if say your
03:17 - main was an unordered list and each one
03:20 - of these was an li of sorts
03:23 - then that would be the way you'd want to
03:24 - handle that
03:26 - and each one could get passed in its own
03:28 - specific information so let's just go
03:30 - ahead and undo some undoing here to
03:32 - where we just have a header
03:36 - there we go now let's make our footer
03:39 - i'm just going to go ahead and save
03:40 - header as footer
03:46 - will be the footer tag
03:51 - and now my layout can import footer as
03:53 - well
03:56 - see i'm always having to run through the
03:57 - alphabet in my head to figure out which
03:59 - comes first you always want to keep
04:00 - those alphabetized
04:03 - we can print our header
04:05 - and our footer
04:07 - see what we got should render out
04:09 - excellent we're good to go and then you
04:11 - could create a body and so forth so this
04:14 - is kind of a standard layout here
04:16 - sometimes people will do a pages folder
04:18 - that has all of our very very top-level
04:20 - components which in this case would be
04:22 - layout
04:23 - and then components would be everything
04:25 - that lives with inside of a page
04:28 - so that's an option you can have your
04:29 - layout living components or you could
04:31 - have a separate pages folder
04:33 - or sometimes that would be called routes
04:35 - and then inside of these like i said is
04:37 - your top level components and then if a
04:40 - component has a component within it
04:42 - standard ways you'll probably want to
04:43 - just create a new folder so let's say
04:45 - this header actually has a title in it
04:47 - let's go ahead and create a new folder
04:50 - we're going to call it header so any
04:51 - component within the header component is
04:54 - going to go into here i know that was
04:56 - mouthful
04:57 - so we'll put you in there and call you
04:59 - title
05:02 - so here's my title js
05:04 - we're going to call it title and we're
05:06 - going to return an h1
05:12 - so there's my title
05:14 - and my header will now import that title
05:16 - and use it
05:24 - and it'll simply print title
05:28 - so now i should have a welcome that's a
05:30 - header with a title h1 inside of it
05:33 - and there's my footer let's go ahead and
05:34 - just look real quickly at
05:36 - the dom that was created from that
05:39 - here's my app
05:42 - and then there's an h1 getting printed
05:44 - and there's a footer getting printed so
05:46 - even though header is returning the
05:47 - title there's no extra dom elements that
05:50 - get added unless i want to wrap a div in
05:52 - there
05:58 - now there will be a div inside that's my
06:02 - header component
06:03 - and then that's my
06:05 - header div
06:07 - and that's how it all works out so i
06:09 - hope you enjoyed this lesson now let's
06:11 - get into some of the more meaty uh meat
06:14 - and potatoes portion of react and that's
06:16 - passing values into components there's
06:19 - multiple ways of doing it there's right
06:21 - ways and there's wrong ways so this is
06:23 - one of the next pieces that you really
06:25 - want to get right if you want to learn
06:26 - react properly so we'll get into data
06:29 - and passing around data in the next
06:31 - video
