00:02 - hey there and welcome back to web
00:04 - development tutorials um if you have not
00:07 - seen the first two videos uh you'll want
00:09 - to watch those first uh check here for a
00:11 - link to basic HTML and check over here
00:14 - for lesson number two which is a link to
00:16 - basic CSS I'm not going to recover those
00:19 - things so you'll want to check those out
00:20 - and if you've already gotten those two
00:22 - and you're kind of on the learning curve
00:24 - I highly encourage you uh learning web
00:27 - development is a skill you will be very
00:29 - very glad you learned it's easy to find
00:31 - work if you're half decent at web
00:33 - development uh there's lots of
00:35 - opportunities to work from home work
00:37 - remote um currently right now I'm in a
00:40 - permanent position and my employer is on
00:43 - the other side of the country my whole
00:44 - team is on the other side of the country
00:46 - uh it's just it's a really great career
00:49 - in my opinion to be in uh lots of
00:51 - flexibility lots of opportunity it's
00:54 - worth the work that being said let's get
00:56 - into building CSS layouts which is what
00:58 - we're going to do on this one uh you
01:00 - know how to do some basic CSS rules but
01:03 - now we're going to say let's take this
01:05 - page this blank page and really make it
01:07 - feel like an actual real web page um so
01:11 - let's get into it one thing you'll
01:12 - notice as I'm typing is I'm using a
01:14 - plugin for Sublime Text called EMT um
01:18 - and what that allows you to do is that
01:19 - allows you to hit Tab and autocreate
01:21 - some things so if I do
01:23 - header it gives me a header tag if I do
01:27 - UL sub Li * 5 gives me a UL with five
01:32 - Lis in it I can go start tabbing through
01:35 - all the fields it's really nice I'll put
01:38 - a little bit of description for it in
01:40 - the uh description down there on how to
01:42 - do it um but let's get into our layout a
01:46 - few HTML 5 Tags I'm going to introduce
01:48 - to you are called
01:50 - header
01:53 - nav and footer I don't I'm can't
01:56 - remember if I covered div or not so div
01:58 - is another one um these are all
02:01 - basically non styling Tags by default
02:05 - they're just container tags they're
02:06 - called semantic tags and what they do is
02:09 - they help you kind of give meaning to
02:11 - the content within them just by looking
02:12 - at the code clearly I'm doing a header
02:14 - with a nav you can put anything you want
02:17 - in here uh but when I see nav it helps
02:19 - the the reader understand uh or the
02:22 - Google bot understand you know when
02:24 - Google's looking at your page to figure
02:26 - out what all the content is helps you
02:28 - figure out what's inside of it
02:30 - so as you see if I just put text it
02:32 - appears and there's nothing special
02:34 - going on so what we're going to do is
02:35 - we're going to start building out our
02:37 - page using these semantic Tags I'm going
02:39 - to do an unordered
02:40 - list um with five liis in
02:45 - it and those Lis are all going to have a
02:48 - hyperlinks in them so this kind of the
02:50 - way I do it in M Atul With An Li and an
02:53 - a * 5 and there we go and I'm just going
02:57 - to put pound for the hyperlinks in there
03:00 - um since that kind of tells it to do
03:03 - nothing I add in some fake links here
03:06 - home blog
03:08 - about
03:11 - contact links sure there we go and
03:15 - you're like that does not look like a
03:16 - navigation um it will we've done it
03:18 - correctly with the tags we've said UL
03:21 - unordered list with line items and from
03:23 - there on out we're going to style them
03:24 - to look the way we want them to uh you
03:26 - know what else I'm going to do I'm going
03:27 - to add an H1 a header
03:31 - my page there we go website complete
03:35 - that's going to be our header section
03:36 - let's move on uh and let's build a three
03:39 - column layout let's go div class equals
03:46 - row and let's do three div class
03:49 - columns div. call time 3 there we
03:55 - go EMT is awesome once you get the swing
03:58 - of it and then footer
04:07 - content okay so this is the markup that
04:10 - we need to make a pretty decent site so
04:12 - far let's move over to CSS and show you
04:14 - how this thing starts coming together uh
04:17 - let's start by doing
04:21 - header and let's give the header a
04:24 - background for now we're not going to
04:26 - worry too much about design let's just
04:28 - go 00 Zer which is black you can also go
04:33 - black um and
04:36 - color
04:39 - white um save that there you go that's
04:42 - starting to come in yeah black is just a
04:43 - little too depressing I'm going to go
04:45 - 9999 for a slight grayish color let's go
04:48 - body let's give body
04:51 - uh H we'll leave body where it is one
04:53 - thing you'll notice too is by default
04:55 - the body has a slight margin around it
04:58 - so we're going to to go ahead and drop
05:01 - body margin
05:05 - zero um and that'll take care of these
05:07 - two it won't take care of that one
05:09 - though uh let's go ahead
05:12 - and save keep moving
05:15 - on header
05:17 - [Music]
05:19 - H1 this will be our title and this will
05:22 - and then we can move on to nav I'm just
05:24 - creating some CSS selectors here for
05:26 - what I'm going to be
05:28 - doing nav UL will give that no margin if
05:32 - you'll notice by default the nav UL has
05:34 - margins on
05:38 - it that took care of a lot header H1
05:42 - let's give youo
05:48 - margin and let's give make sure the
05:51 - header has no
05:53 - margin trying to figure out where this
05:55 - extra little bitty margin's coming from
05:57 - sometimes there's some defaults on
05:58 - browsers that that you're not aware
06:04 - of all right we'll figure that out in a
06:06 - little bit I'll show you how to inspect
06:08 - that to find out where that padding's
06:10 - coming
06:12 - from so it clearly isn't that all right
06:15 - um so what we'll do now let's move on to
06:18 - the
06:21 - ulli so we're going to make a rule here
06:24 - you can see I'm further selecting into
06:26 - things by going navul the reason I'm
06:28 - putting nav first is I don't want to
06:29 - style every UL on my page uh with what
06:33 - I'm putting in here I just want to style
06:35 - my nav UL right now same with here I
06:38 - don't want to make every Li for the rest
06:40 - of my entire website look like a
06:42 - navigation so I'm just specifying nav
06:46 - with a UL child with an Li child so you
06:49 - see it's going nav UL Li and it's going
06:53 - to style that what I'm going to do is
06:56 - list style type by default it's going to
07:00 - do bulleted and now I'm going to change
07:02 - that to none you'll see now the bullets
07:05 - are gone there we
07:07 - go and then I'm also going to change the
07:12 - display to
07:15 - inline
07:17 - block there's a few display choices by
07:20 - default uh you can usually there's
07:23 - display inline oh there's my problem
07:25 - body had a colon in it and yes I knew I
07:28 - wasn't crazy easy see margin zero um you
07:32 - can see once I changed it to inline
07:34 - block they all jumped in line with each
07:37 - other um and the reason I made it in
07:40 - line is also an option which will give
07:41 - me a similar look uh you can see nothing
07:44 - changed the reason I did inline
07:47 - block is when I did inline block I can
07:49 - actually assign them fixed widths and I
07:52 - can do a lot more things with inline
07:54 - block than I can with in
07:56 - line uh let me give them a
08:01 - background
08:04 - color let's give these a background of
08:08 - black a color of
08:13 - white and you'll notice they they're
08:16 - still blue because the hyperlinks the a
08:18 - tags default have a color as well
08:25 - so there you go that'll take care of
08:28 - those and I'm also going to add a little
08:30 - bit of
08:32 - margin let's try five pixels all
08:36 - around I don't want to do margin okay
08:38 - one thing you'll notice this is a when
08:40 - you do margin it adds spacing on the
08:43 - outside of your element as you see here
08:46 - I have a black background and margin
08:48 - added spacing here which is what's
08:50 - giving me this funky look if I add
08:53 - padding instead of
08:55 - margin what padding is going to do is
08:58 - there you go see now now it's going to
09:00 - create padding inside of my element so
09:04 - what I'm going to do is I like the five
09:05 - pixel top and bottom padding but I want
09:07 - to have more like 10 pixel on the left
09:09 - and the
09:11 - right so that looks a little better I'm
09:13 - actually going to go even more 15 pixels
09:17 - once again with margin and padding you
09:18 - can go it goes top bottom left right top
09:22 - or top right it goes clockwise top right
09:24 - bottom left and if you just do two then
09:28 - it goes top bottom left
09:30 - right so I'm going five
09:33 - pixels 15 pixels so that goes top bottom
09:36 - five pixels Left Right 15 pixels if I
09:39 - want it to be more detailed I could also
09:40 - go five pixels 15 pixels same
09:46 - thing there's that and then I also do
09:49 - want to drop margins to zero
09:52 - because notice how there's a little bit
09:54 - of margin in between
09:56 - there I think there's a little bit of
09:58 - margin there we'll have to figure out
09:59 - where that margin's coming from we'll
10:01 - look at that in a little
10:03 - bit so there's our buttons you see it's
10:05 - starting to look like a web page I'm
10:08 - also going to
10:15 - add display in line to my
10:18 - H1 and display in
10:22 - line to my ul and that should make them
10:26 - yep bounce around to the same line which
10:28 - is very
10:30 - nice another thing I'm going to do is
10:33 - start adding
10:35 - some margins to my header now or padding
10:43 - rather let's try a same 5 pixel 15 pixel
10:46 - padding that's starting to feel good
10:48 - although I don't want any padding on the
10:50 - bottom so I'm actually going to go and
10:52 - extend this
10:55 - rule so what I just did is five pixel
10:58 - top right bottom left there we go kind
11:01 - of want these guys to stay on the bottom
11:04 - uh it's feeling a little good let's
11:05 - maybe see what happens if I do 15 pixel
11:09 - there yeah feeling decent feeling decent
11:13 - so what's going to happen here is
11:15 - because I made this display in line and
11:18 - this whole UL display in line by default
11:20 - they're automatically just going to line
11:22 - up with each other um and depending on
11:24 - how the space goes they're just going to
11:27 - automatically show up where they show up
11:29 - you'll notice there's a little bit extra
11:30 - padding coming on here that's cuz uls by
11:33 - default have padding as
11:37 - well let me drop that there you go and
11:40 - now I'm noticing oh okay I kind of like
11:42 - that default padding there maybe what
11:45 - I'm going to do here is give it a little
11:48 - bit of padding on the
11:50 - left 0 0 Let's try 15 pixels
11:56 - zero top right bottom whoops wrong thing
12:00 - top right bottom
12:04 - left that feels good so now whatever my
12:07 - title does is going to automatically
12:08 - bump these out further and further along
12:11 - let's move on to our three column layout
12:14 - so a little bit of explanation since I
12:16 - flew through this I'm using uh selectors
12:19 - to obviously clearly grab everything
12:21 - header header one I want to kind of keep
12:23 - them grouped uh so it's easier to figure
12:26 - things out a decent idea is start with
12:28 - the very top elements of your page move
12:31 - down the list you can see I went body
12:35 - header what's inside the header then I
12:37 - went nav I didn't do anything specific
12:40 - to the nav so that could stay there then
12:42 - I went what's inside the nav then I went
12:44 - what's inside the UL and so keeping with
12:48 - that um you'll notice we we only have a
12:50 - few actual selector rules uh CSS rules
12:54 - that we've used we've used a lot of
12:56 - margin and padding you're going to use
12:57 - those a ton you're going to use display
13:00 - a
13:01 - lot um you're going to use background
13:03 - and color and you know this list style
13:06 - type you're really only use that one
13:07 - here and there you see there's not an
13:09 - infinite amount of CSS rules uh or css
13:13 - yeah rules once you get to know them get
13:16 - to know what they
13:17 - are you start getting comfortable a lot
13:20 - faster than it feels like At first so uh
13:23 - let's move on to our div you'll notice
13:26 - we went div class row and then we went
13:29 - div class column class column class
13:32 - column all right let's create these
13:34 - things in an actual three column
13:38 - layout div
13:41 - row so I went a div with a class of row
13:44 - if I did this and added that space then
13:46 - it would look for a div with something
13:48 - class row inside of it I'll actually
13:51 - just go class
13:53 - row we'll leave you for
13:57 - now class column and what we're going to
13:59 - do is we're going to give
14:02 - you a
14:04 - float of
14:06 - left and what that means is is
14:08 - everything with the column now floats
14:10 - left check it out so they are all
14:12 - floating
14:13 - left uh we have a problem here in that
14:17 - since they're floating left our foot are
14:19 - bumped up and that's a tricky thing we
14:21 - have to add here is we have to we are
14:24 - going to do something sneaky is we can
14:28 - do one of two things we can either make
14:29 - the
14:32 - footer clear both clear both means
14:36 - forget about the floats and wrap around
14:39 - because lots of times after your things
14:40 - are floating left let me see if I can
14:43 - show you a little more clearly What's
14:44 - Happening
14:47 - Here let me give it a background of
14:51 - 999 and a padding of say 20
14:56 - pixels I'll give it a background of 3 3
14:59 - three so it sticks
15:01 - out so we've now got these three
15:07 - columns add a little bit of margin too
15:09 - for effect okay there we go that looks a
15:11 - little better three columns now that
15:13 - they're floating everything is kind of
15:15 - going to be out of pocket and they're
15:17 - just going to start lining up on the
15:19 - left um which
15:21 - means that the footer by default is
15:24 - going to bump up lining on the left as
15:26 - well we don't want that to happen we
15:28 - want it to do it called clearing the
15:29 - floats which means okay forget all the
15:31 - floats that are going on clear it come
15:34 - back down here and so that's why I'm
15:36 - adding a clear both that means it's
15:38 - clearing left and right floats uh if we
15:41 - told this to float
15:43 - right then they'd all start floating
15:46 - based off the right side of the page so
15:47 - when you tell it clear both you're
15:49 - telling it clear all the float lefts and
15:50 - the float rights if you can understand
15:53 - floats you've basically understood 80%
15:56 - of CSS layouts uh maybe not 80% maybe
15:59 - halfway through floats are a little bit
16:02 - interesting to to wrap your head around
16:03 - at first but as you can see it's it's
16:05 - not that
16:07 - complicated so I'm actually going to do
16:09 - now is I'm going to actually go a
16:10 - percentage
16:14 - size Let's see we have three so that
16:17 - would be 33% for the entire
16:23 - thing so if each gets 33% we''ve
16:26 - basically failed out our whole guy
16:29 - and you see they're no matter what my
16:31 - size of my window is they're always
16:33 - going to
16:37 - adjust what I'm actually going to do now
16:39 - is add a
16:41 - margin say
16:46 - 1% so that will now cause them to bump
16:48 - around okay so what happened here we
16:50 - have 1% margin plus
16:53 - 33% uh if you add these three together
16:56 - 33% you're getting 99% and now we added
16:59 - a margin of one one one one we basically
17:03 - added 6% to margins so now we're ending
17:06 - up
17:07 - at
17:09 - 105% that doesn't work so when you float
17:12 - stuff they're just going to keep
17:13 - wrapping around uh it's really nice
17:15 - let's say we added five more
17:19 - divs you'll notice they just keep
17:21 - wrapping around kind of like what
17:23 - Pinterest does the things just keep
17:25 - wrapping and coming down and wrapping
17:27 - and coming down interested in an even
17:30 - three column
17:31 - layout uh so I'm trying to think of what
17:33 - the math would be here I basically need
17:35 - to drop 5 percentage off um let's go
17:41 - 31 there you
17:43 - go so now we've got our three column
17:46 - layout you notice that no matter how my
17:48 - browser window
17:49 - changes it stays nice and Nifty that's
17:53 - really great um so that's kind of a lot
17:56 - of when you can use a percentage layout
17:58 - because what that's going to give you is
18:00 - the ability for your page to look really
18:02 - nice on all devices you can go
18:05 - width and keep it fixed I went 200
18:08 - pixels there uh but you notice that
18:10 - depending on what kind of screen size
18:12 - you get it's not always going to look
18:14 - the same I'm going to leave this here
18:17 - because in future lessons we're going to
18:18 - cover Twitter bootstrap uh which does a
18:21 - lot of these smarts for you and does a
18:24 - lot of cool things for making it look
18:25 - great on every device I just kind of
18:27 - want you to get the basics of how we do
18:30 - everything here um one one thing I'm
18:34 - going to add before calling this layout
18:36 - done let's add border
18:40 - radius 10
18:42 - pixels and that's going to add rounded
18:44 - Corners ah doesn't look too nice right
18:47 - now let's may make it
18:53 - five and let me add that padding back
18:57 - in
19:00 - so there you go now we're call whoops we
19:02 - got a padding of 10 pixels so now what
19:03 - you noticed here is that
19:06 - bumped our margin off against maybe I'm
19:09 - going to go
19:17 - padding there we go so what I did is I
19:19 - changed our margin to 0.5% and our
19:21 - paddings got
19:23 - 05% on the left and right so maybe I'll
19:25 - go 10 pixels top bottom .5 % left right
19:30 - and we definitely need a
19:35 - color there we go we're getting a layout
19:38 - I don't like that the footer is clearing
19:39 - both by default I want it to be a little
19:41 - more generic than that so what I'm going
19:43 - to do is I'm going to do a
19:46 - row
19:48 - after and this is kind of what's called
19:50 - a pseudo element you see that now I get
19:53 - the exact same
19:55 - effect um row after creates a fake take
19:58 - element after the row that's invisible
20:00 - and you get to style it however you want
20:02 - so all that element does right now is
20:04 - clear both so anytime I add a row tag
20:08 - it's going to clear both after it
20:10 - meaning that any floats they're all
20:12 - going to be checked out and the next guy
20:14 - is going to appear exactly as you wish
20:16 - it to so if I copy and paste this row
20:19 - and I just have one
20:27 - column
20:29 - and my that is did not do what I wanted
20:32 - it to
20:44 - do oh why is it doing that
20:52 - okay there we go make the row clear
20:57 - both and I'm not sure why the afters
20:59 - were doing what it's doing so I'll look
21:01 - into that and put it in the comments
21:03 - below so I don't look like a fool here
21:06 - on uh on public YouTube so that's pretty
21:09 - much where you're going to go I'll bad
21:12 - add my footer to clear both
21:16 - again one things you learn about web
21:18 - development is you never learn at all
21:20 - even if you knew it six months ago you
21:21 - might not have used that certain thing
21:23 - for six months um and once we get into
