00:01 - okay i am really excited about this
00:03 - video uh some stuff i've wanted to talk
00:05 - about for a long time got a cool product
00:07 - here in my hands
00:09 - the level by fluid stance a lot of you
00:12 - guys have seen this and wondered if it's
00:13 - any good uh yes it is i'll talk about
00:15 - that in a second
00:16 - uh basically um if any of you guys have
00:18 - been following my twitter i don't really
00:20 - talk about my twitter but it's at learn
00:22 - code acad acad
00:24 - uh so if any for those of you guys that
00:26 - have followed it i've been talking about
00:28 - my stand-up desk situation a lot
00:30 - recently and how much i love it and yes
00:33 - i have i've been doing full-time web
00:34 - development 40 hours a week since i was
00:37 - 18
00:38 - and sitting is a major problem is a
00:41 - major health problem got some quotes
00:42 - here uh from other people not just me
00:46 - tim cook ceo i think from apple he calls
00:49 - sitting the new cancer
00:51 - um and then i think huffington post said
00:53 - sitting is the smoking of our generation
00:56 - uh there's some infographics if you
00:58 - check out pinterest that show how much
01:00 - higher the percentage of death is for
01:03 - people who sit 40 hours a week i mean
01:05 - it's just it's bad sitting 40 hours a
01:07 - week is bad and back in the day you
01:09 - didn't really have a choice this is what
01:11 - companies did even web companies you had
01:13 - to wear your nice shirt and you had to
01:15 - sit 40 hours a week at a desk and that's
01:17 - just what we did
01:18 - but research and health conscious
01:21 - companies are coming out and they're
01:22 - just giving us a lot more options
01:24 - a lot of web companies especially if you
01:27 - request a stand-up desk or a stand-up
01:29 - sit-down desk they'll probably provide
01:31 - it for you
01:33 - or if you request a thing to help you uh
01:35 - with your development experience they'll
01:36 - probably provide it for you so um
01:39 - basically my experience about six months
01:42 - ago i started doing a stand-up desk and
01:44 - i'm absolutely positively never ever
01:47 - ever ever going back um i don't stand
01:50 - full eight hours a day i tend to stand
01:52 - about six hours a day
01:54 - but it's just you feel so much better
01:56 - throughout the day
01:57 - you have so much more energy throughout
01:59 - the day
02:01 - and a lot of issues like back issues
02:04 - even even if you have a great ergonomic
02:05 - chair i used to work at webmd.com and
02:07 - they they gave us really good those
02:09 - really expensive ergonomic chairs and
02:12 - you don't deal with near as much with
02:13 - your back but you still deal with all
02:15 - the other health issues that are
02:17 - associated with sitting for a long time
02:20 - so back issues kind of go away right
02:22 - away your core gets stronger standing up
02:24 - you notice that which as a developer
02:26 - noticing your core at all it's kind of
02:29 - revolutionary
02:30 - um and then neck issues kind of went
02:32 - away i started kind of having some neck
02:34 - issues i had a little forward head
02:35 - posture you know where your neck kind of
02:37 - does that thing from trying to fix code
02:39 - issues
02:40 - that went away really quick you know i
02:42 - got my monitor up higher than desk level
02:45 - and
02:46 - that went away real fast so basically
02:48 - physically you just feel a lot better
02:50 - standing um and then the only thing you
02:53 - notice is is you can't stand very long
02:56 - because you find yourself doing a hard
02:58 - stand where you'll you put you're trying
03:00 - to solve a problem you're focused you
03:02 - find yourself putting all the pressure
03:04 - on one hip or the other hip or just one
03:06 - knee or one ankle for a long period of
03:09 - time
03:10 - your feet can't handle the pressure of
03:12 - standing for a long period of time again
03:14 - especially because you're focused
03:17 - and that's really where this product
03:18 - makes a massive difference this is the
03:20 - fluid stance level
03:22 - or the level by fluid stance and it's a
03:25 - stand-up desk balance board
03:27 - um and it's not a balance board like
03:28 - you'd find at the gym where it's made
03:31 - for drastically increasing your balance
03:34 - and strengthening your legs it's a much
03:36 - more gentle if you can look at the slope
03:38 - of that it's a much more gentle
03:41 - balance
03:42 - whatever a gentle slope and so it's very
03:45 - natural very easy to stand on my wife
03:47 - jumped on it and could stand on it right
03:49 - away she doesn't do skateboarding or any
03:51 - extreme sports like that and she could
03:53 - easily just stand on it and enjoyed
03:55 - standing on it my toddlers love this
03:57 - thing
03:58 - and i love it i mean it just really it's
04:00 - fun to go to my desk in the morning with
04:03 - this thing here because it's just fun
04:04 - and i'll show you kind of what it does
04:06 - in a minute um but the best thing about
04:08 - it is you don't do those hard stands
04:10 - there's more of a motion throughout the
04:12 - day
04:13 - you can change to i don't know 30 40
04:15 - different positions you can kind of roll
04:18 - your feet back sideways you know really
04:20 - stretch your calf out for part of the
04:23 - day and you can roll your feet forward
04:24 - and just get a whole bunch a lot of
04:26 - range of motion you don't do those hard
04:29 - stands and your feet don't really get
04:30 - very sore
04:32 - i could probably stand on this thing a
04:33 - full eight hours in the day and my feet
04:36 - wouldn't be sore by the end of the day
04:37 - or at least not anywhere as close as
04:39 - they'd feel
04:41 - um if i was standing on the ground i
04:43 - couldn't stand eight hours straight on
04:44 - the ground without something like this
04:46 - to put it plainly
04:47 - and it's not best in class it's pretty
04:50 - much only in class
04:52 - there's kind of a cheap knockoff plastic
04:55 - kind of thing that you can find on
04:56 - amazon but it's not even a similar kind
04:59 - of product it only goes back and forth
05:01 - and it's just not even in the same class
05:03 - so this is every bit worth the price
05:06 - they tend to range from about around 200
05:08 - to around four hundred dollars depending
05:10 - on what you want this deck made out of
05:12 - um but i can say i would much rather
05:15 - have a cheaper sit stand desk with one
05:18 - of these guys than a really nice like
05:20 - two thousand dollar sit stand desk now
05:22 - as far as the desk component itself you
05:25 - can either uh i think the best way to go
05:28 - is a sit stand adjustable desk ikea
05:31 - makes a 400 one that's electric that you
05:34 - can change throughout your day so if
05:36 - you're in or near a big city that has an
05:38 - ikea
05:39 - that's your cheapest way to go if your
05:40 - company is buying you one and budget's
05:42 - not as much of a concern
05:44 - you can go to the sleep number store
05:46 - they have several options of really good
05:49 - sitting standing desks that are more
05:50 - around the one to two thousand dollar
05:52 - range
05:53 - um
05:54 - and that's it i mean i really just i
05:56 - kind of had to do a video on it and i
05:58 - was able to really get my hands on this
06:00 - i've used this non-stop since i got my
06:02 - hands on this thing it is it is awesome
06:04 - and i'm not getting paid to tell you
06:06 - this i think it's very important i say
06:08 - this because some people would think
06:09 - that i'm i'm getting paid to tell you
06:11 - this um
06:12 - i'm not so it's it's just basically a
06:14 - great product that i think people should
06:16 - know about and request from their work
06:18 - to get them one so let's kind of show
06:21 - you how this thing works
06:22 - alright so here you go here it is um
06:24 - i've got it on a piece of wood right
06:26 - here because i do think it's best
06:28 - experienced on wood it totally works on
06:30 - carpet and rugs
06:31 - but you just stand on it and as you can
06:33 - see it's not that big of a balance
06:36 - issue and if you ever start swaying into
06:38 - one direction it takes no effort to just
06:40 - get it back
06:41 - especially if you have a desk that gives
06:43 - you any kind of pressure at all i'm not
06:44 - touching a desk right now and it's a lot
06:47 - of fun just twisting it back and forth
06:50 - all the little different ranges of
06:51 - motion you get like i said you can
06:53 - stretch out your calves kind of get that
06:56 - work on there and then
06:57 - lean forward you can even do like a
06:59 - walking motion while you're sitting
07:02 - there working of course
07:03 - you ever get bored just give yourself a
07:04 - little spin see if i can grab the wall
07:06 - here
07:08 - so the spin is of course
07:10 - kind of a professional level move i'm
07:12 - not gonna lie i'm really kind of a
07:14 - professional at this but yeah this thing
07:16 - is great
07:18 - and again i'm not touching a desk right
07:20 - now touching a desk it's even easier
07:22 - even more comfortable even more natural
07:25 - let me kind of show you how it works
07:28 - on a rug this is a very thick rug
07:33 - um still works just fine no issues
07:35 - whatsoever
07:37 - in some ways it's actually a little
07:39 - easier in that you don't spin
07:41 - if you don't want to move back and forth
07:43 - as you go then this is uh some kind of
07:45 - rug or pad will actually help you out
07:47 - um and that it just kind of gives you a
07:49 - forward backward left right motion you
07:51 - don't really get any of that spinning
07:52 - you got to kind of work to spin at this
07:54 - point
07:55 - and then a low carpet
07:59 - if you can hear me i'm a little further
08:00 - from the microphone now low carpet kind
08:02 - of gives you that in between really easy
08:04 - to spin at this point i'm it's not going
08:06 - to damage the carpet at all
08:08 - and honestly
08:09 - this piece of pine right here i got a
08:11 - piece of pine
08:13 - as kind of a tester for what it's going
08:15 - to do to a hardwood floor pine obviously
08:17 - being a pretty soft wood a really light
08:19 - wood
08:20 - didn't really do any damage to this
08:22 - thing after a straight week
08:24 - tiny little scrapes and scuffs so if
08:28 - you're gonna do it on a nice hardwood
08:29 - floor um i would definitely get some
08:31 - kind of pad they sell a floor pad for it
08:34 - that obviously looks a lot better than
08:36 - this
08:37 - um you could also go cheap and just go
08:39 - to home depot for six bucks to get one
08:41 - of these
08:42 - which works just fine or get some sort
08:44 - of hard plastic chair mat or something
08:46 - like that but
08:47 - again
08:48 - the thing works great super fun to stand
08:51 - on just hop on it every morning have a
08:53 - great time
08:55 - and your legs your knees i've noticed
08:57 - these ankles are just kind of moving
08:58 - constantly
09:00 - um
09:01 - and i can code just fine on it that's
09:02 - that's the best thing too it's not
09:04 - distracting from coding
09:06 - at all it's it's a distraction-free
09:09 - thing i feel like it actually helps me
09:10 - focus better because a lot of us coders
09:13 - are kind of a little bit 80d and we need
09:15 - something to kind of keep us engaged and
09:17 - so this helps with that
09:19 - okay that's it um as you can see it's
09:21 - super fun product stand up desk is
09:24 - awesome again i'm telling you guys you
