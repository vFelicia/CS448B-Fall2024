00:00 - so we are deploying this node.js app
00:03 - that I've spun up into production we're
00:04 - going to be doing an automated
00:06 - deployment on it so we can run one
00:08 - command and deploy to as many servers as
00:10 - we have if our application is huge and
00:12 - has 10 servers we can run one command
00:14 - and it'll send them off to all 10 so uh
00:17 - I've used digital ocean to spin up a
00:19 - server called test node app if you did
00:21 - not if you do not know about digital
00:23 - ocean and you didn't catch my first
00:25 - video go ahead and catch that now it's
00:26 - in the description and if you don't know
00:28 - about SSH you want to watch my SSH video
00:30 - that is also in the description and that
00:32 - will get you up to speed with what we're
00:33 - about to be doing so we've got an email
00:36 - here that's created our computer Force
00:39 - there's the IP address and there's our
00:41 - password so let's go ahead and SSH root
00:43 - at IP address let me grab that
00:46 - password I already logged in just so you
00:49 - know so it will ask you to change your
00:50 - password the first time you log in um
00:53 - and I've already changed my password so
00:55 - let's say I've logged in I've changed my
00:57 - password so now what we are going to do
01:00 - is we are going to install node that's
01:01 - already installed because I spun up a
01:03 - digital ocean image that has node
01:05 - installed so let's go ahead and install
01:07 - forever forever is going to be our node
01:10 - package that actually runs our app mpm
01:13 - install G
01:16 - forever there we go forever's
01:19 - installing and then once that's done the
01:22 - next thing we're going to do is add a
01:23 - user uh a deploy user there you go
01:26 - forever's installed let's create a
01:28 - deploy user so if you look at this I
01:30 - have for you it's got all the commands
01:32 - that I'm going to be running I've got
01:33 - this gist right here in the description
01:35 - and I've got a link uh I've got a link
01:38 - to how to create a deploy user so let's
01:41 - go ahead and just copy and paste this
01:43 - you can look at those commands later on
01:44 - and see what they actually are it's just
01:46 - going to ask for that user's new
01:48 - password there we go my user is updated
01:51 - there's now a deploy user who has pseudo
01:54 - Powers so you can kind of do some pseudo
01:56 - things you don't really want to do
01:57 - things as root it's a good idea to have
01:59 - a user that at least has you can apply
02:01 - restrictions to so now we can ssh in as
02:06 - this user so let me go
02:08 - exits we're going to SSH
02:10 - deploy at that IP address so we're going
02:13 - to log in as that
02:17 - user and we are going to Now set up
02:19 - password list
02:20 - SSH uh so that way that user can log in
02:24 - with an ID with an SSH key
02:28 - instead so the steps for doing that as
02:31 - you can see here we're going to make a
02:32 - directory for SSH and get out mkd r. SSH
02:37 - okay let's
02:39 - exit there we go I'm out um and now we
02:42 - have to do is copy our RSA key into the
02:47 - authorized keys so I'm assuming you
02:48 - already have an ID RSA key and now we
02:51 - are just going to copy that if you have
02:53 - it by a different name you'll want to
02:55 - change that I'm just going to copy that
02:58 - to oops I kept
03:00 - url.com it's not at url.com because I
03:04 - have an IP address
03:05 - here deploy
03:08 - at my IP
03:10 - address it will ask for my password I've
03:14 - copied the key over and now I can ssh in
03:18 - and it will not ask for a password there
03:20 - we go I'm in awesome so now almost done
03:24 - all we need to do is automate our
03:26 - deployment we already have a user setup
03:28 - who has uh permissions and so let's go
03:31 - ahead and audited made our deployment
03:32 - the tool we're going to be using for
03:33 - this is called Flight Plan it's a
03:35 - node.js library so it really kind of
03:38 - will feel very familiar if you're
03:39 - familiar with node.js Capistrano is also
03:41 - a great Tool uh it's a little more full
03:44 - featured which means it's a little more
03:45 - complicated to set up but you get more
03:48 - features out of it uh but flight plan is
03:50 - great for a lot of scenarios so we're
03:52 - going to install flight plan so we are
03:54 - on our machine right
03:56 - now we're just going to go npm install G
04:00 - flight
04:01 - plan that gives us the fly command
04:04 - everywhere on the
04:06 - machine there we go and then we are in
04:09 - our application right now we are going
04:11 - to install fly locally in mpm install
04:15 - and we're going to do save Dev
04:17 - fly just so you guys know too I'm
04:19 - popping in and out of my terminal
04:22 - because I'm using ierm 2 so I can hotkey
04:24 - in and out which is very nice so now
04:27 - you'll notice the reason I did save Dev
04:29 - that Dev flag uh for those you guys who
04:31 - don't know is it adds it to Dev
04:34 - dependencies instead of dependencies so
04:36 - when I push my repository to production
04:40 - I can just run npm install production
04:43 - and it will only install these guys
04:45 - whereas if I run npm install it will
04:47 - install the dev dependencies as well
04:49 - really all that does is it just speeds
04:51 - up my deployment a little bit if you
04:52 - have 10 Dev dependencies like Gulp and
04:55 - stuff then your deployment on production
04:58 - doesn't install any of those it makes it
04:59 - just a little bit faster you can install
05:01 - it here it doesn't really matter it's
05:03 - not going to blow anything up so flight
05:06 - plan is installed so now I can hit fly
05:09 - and it's going to say there's no flight
05:11 - plan. JS so all I need to do now is add
05:14 - a flight plan. JS file let's touch
05:19 - that there we go so now it's created and
05:22 - let's copy in so now I'm going to copy
05:25 - and paste this flight plan. JS code that
05:27 - I have for you in my gist it's a slight
05:30 - tweak on what they provide for you by
05:32 - default uh that's set up for forever so
05:36 - there we go that's my flight plan. JS
05:37 - here's what you're going to do you're
05:38 - going to give it an app name which you
05:39 - can make whatever you want this
05:41 - determines the folder that it deploys
05:43 - your app to the username which we made a
05:45 - user called deploy and then whatever
05:47 - your start file is so we run bin www to
05:51 - start our app some people call it server
05:53 - J
05:54 - server.js then the only other
05:55 - configuration you're going to do is
05:57 - you're going to set up your IP addresses
05:58 - for your staging and production servers
06:01 - so let me grab that IP address there's
06:04 - my IP address and that's my production
06:06 - server if you had a staging server you
06:08 - could also set that up so we could
06:10 - deploy to staging first and then deploy
06:12 - to production once that's successful and
06:14 - you can set this up as an object or you
06:17 - can set it up as an array and you can
06:19 - add multiple servers so when you do fly
06:23 - production it will deploy to I don't
06:25 - know 10 or 20 of these servers if you
06:27 - want I just have one right now so that's
06:29 - I have and that's it so now I can just
06:32 - run fly production and it will deploy to
06:34 - my production server
06:38 - fry fly production there we go it's
06:41 - sending it sending it
06:46 - over running my app with forever and we
06:49 - are good so now I can go to my IP
06:53 - address and I can go to Port
06:56 - 3000 and check it out there's my node
06:58 - application all I need to do at this
07:00 - point is buy a domain name and point it
07:01 - to this IP address and I'm good so
07:04 - that's basically how you deploy um and
07:07 - if I need to redeploy I just run fly
07:09 - production again or fly staging to run
07:12 - to the staging servers and it's done so
07:14 - let me show you kind of under the hood
07:16 - what this is doing for us what what fly
07:18 - is actually doing what flight plane is
07:20 - doing so when you run it the first thing
07:22 - it does is it gets all the files to copy
07:25 - it runs this command on your machine it
07:27 - runs all the local ones first so if you
07:29 - have like a gulp build or a grump a
07:31 - grunt build you can uncomment that and
07:33 - it will run that
07:34 - first and then it will do run get LS
07:37 - files and what that does is that gets a
07:38 - list of all the files that would be
07:40 - checked into your git repository so it
07:42 - will ignore node modules it will ignore
07:45 - anything that's in your git ignore file
07:47 - I can even show you what this command
07:48 - does uh G LS files it shows you right
07:51 - there there's all my files and they're
07:52 - full URLs so that's kind of nice um and
07:57 - then it copies all those files with one
07:59 - r sync command you can see what that
08:01 - rsync command is here it's a big old
08:05 - messy command that it does for you so it
08:07 - R syncs them all in and then it runs npm
08:10 - install production um it moves them to
08:13 - attempt directory runs npm install
08:15 - production and then it makes a Sim link
08:19 - uh to the application name folder which
08:22 - I'll show you what that is that doesn't
08:23 - probably doesn't make sense and then it
08:25 - stops your application with forever and
08:26 - then it restarts your application with
08:28 - forever let's go log into
08:32 - our server SSH deploy there we go and
08:36 - let me show you what I got here so we
08:37 - see that I have node app that's a folder
08:40 - and then I have two different folders
08:43 - for my two deployment so I have history
08:44 - of all my deployments and this is
08:46 - actually a Sim link so it deploys your
08:49 - deployment to a folder given gives it
08:51 - the Tim stamp that's a time stamp right
08:52 - there and then it says it makes a Sim
08:55 - link node app now points to this folder
08:58 - so if I were to make a new deployment it
09:00 - would create my new folder put all my
09:02 - new code in there and then it would
09:04 - change the Sim link so th node app
09:06 - points to here so then if I go CD space
09:10 - node
09:12 - app it thinks I'm in node app but I'm
09:14 - really in my deployment folder because
09:16 - it's a shortcut it's a Sim link and then
09:19 - it runs my my command which is forever
09:23 - starts um and then whatever I've set you
09:26 - know bin
09:28 - www and that's what flight plan's doing
09:30 - for you behind the scenes uh that's
09:32 - pretty much how you do an enjoyable
09:34 - deployment to any kind of environment
09:37 - you want we call these environments
09:39 - staging environment production
09:40 - environment and now we'll go into the
09:42 - next video where I'll show you how to
09:44 - enhance this uh by running our node app
09:46 - as a service and that will make it an
09:48 - even stronger deployment strategy
