00:01 - all right this is lesson number two
00:03 - about learning JavaScript if you missed
00:05 - lesson number one you might want to
00:06 - watch it the Link's in the footer or
00:08 - I'll put an annotation on here somewhere
00:10 - we're just going to keep moving forward
00:11 - so we are now into a super basic website
00:15 - have it up over here um and it's going
00:17 - to automatically reload as I enter stuff
00:21 - um you might have to tab over and hit
00:22 - reload what I'm going to do here is I'm
00:24 - just going to create a script tag and
00:26 - whenever I add a script tag by default
00:28 - that's going to be JavaScript straight
00:30 - in my page and so I'm going to go
00:33 - alert you'll notice Sublime gives me
00:35 - cool nice new colors that's very nice so
00:37 - now if I hit save oh my page reloads and
00:40 - hit hi there every time I reload my page
00:41 - it's going to say hi there so we're
00:43 - using the exact same code that you can
00:45 - use
00:46 - here in the console and we're now just
00:50 - putting it in the page I can also do
00:52 - console
00:55 - log hi there so that's kind of the the
00:58 - use of console log is is it's a way to
01:01 - kind of debug when stuff's breaking and
01:03 - you don't know what's going on you can
01:04 - spit stuff out to your console and your
01:07 - normal user doesn't see it uh but you
01:10 - can open your console and see there your
01:12 - notes to yourself as to what kind of
01:15 - stuff is going on so that's kind of how
01:17 - you do JavaScript right there on your
01:19 - page and let's go ahead and load up
01:21 - what's called jQuery if you go to
01:24 - jquery.com jQuery is what's called a
01:27 - library and it gives you some great ways
01:31 - to uh do stuff very very easily and
01:34 - actually we're going to go to code.
01:36 - jquery.com
01:37 - because we just want to get the actual
01:40 - code and you can click on
01:43 - minified and there we go I just want the
01:45 - link right there I'm going to copy the
01:48 - link and right down here and the bottom
01:51 - of my page now we'll just go and add
01:56 - script and Source equals and then paste
01:59 - that link you got there awesome so now
02:01 - jQuery is going to load in onto my
02:04 - page hit refresh you don't notice
02:06 - anything because jQuery doesn't actually
02:08 - do anything it just gives you a bunch of
02:12 - predefined variables remember we talked
02:13 - about variables and commands uh kind of
02:16 - gives you a bunch of predefined things
02:17 - that you can use so here I'm going to
02:20 - make my own script after
02:22 - jQuery because we want to make sure
02:23 - we're doing this after jQuery uh
02:26 - otherwise jQuery won't be loaded yet and
02:29 - uh now you can do some things like
02:32 - jQuery sign is the dollar sign this is
02:35 - basically the main function you get I
02:37 - can go jQuery do I can go jQuery and I'm
02:41 - going to look for the tag of
02:44 - header and these are just like CSS
02:47 - selectors that's the beauty of jQuery
02:49 - I'm going to go header
02:51 - H1
02:53 - HTML and I'm going to change the HTML of
02:56 - header H1 once again this looks just
02:59 - like CSS doesn't it that's why everybody
03:02 - loves jQuery um and I'm going to go my
03:05 - awesome
03:07 - site I'm going to hit save you'll notice
03:10 - it starts off at my site and then
03:11 - instantly goes B my awesome site so now
03:14 - we are real time changing stuff in
03:18 - jQuery which is or or in using
03:20 - JavaScript let's go ahead and do this
03:23 - I'm going to go
03:26 - UL Li I'm going to go same thing milk
03:31 - eggs and I'll just leave that there so
03:35 - UL I made that a UI didn't I
03:39 - whoops UL Li let's try doing something
03:42 - else let's
03:44 - go um UL that'll just find an element
03:48 - just like CSS again and I'm going to do
03:51 - append append means we're going to add
03:53 - another thing in
03:55 - there uh veggies and I'm just going to
03:58 - put some straight HTML code in in there
04:00 - so UL it's now going to add an Li to my
04:03 - UL with veggies so there you go milk
04:06 - eggs and now veggies is in there even
04:08 - though it's not in the code I'm going to
04:10 - copy and paste
04:12 - this now we got a lot of veggies so you
04:16 - can add a whole lot of things this is
04:17 - kind of where the web like I said really
04:20 - starts getting fun because now you're
04:21 - changing your web page real time I can
04:23 - also come over here this will be a lot
04:24 - more fun let's do it like
04:26 - this let's do it in the console nice and
04:31 - so then I can
04:33 - go I'm going to go let's clean this
04:36 - thing out UL HTML let's just give it a
04:39 - single Li when you hit HTML it's going
04:43 - to
04:46 - completely it's going to completely wipe
04:48 - out what's in there and it's going to
04:50 - give it all new stuff so there we go now
04:52 - I completely wiped out my
04:54 - HTML um or you can and I added An Li in
04:58 - there so now we're really time starting
05:00 - to mess with our stuff um instead of a
05:04 - pend let's say I wanted to add something
05:06 - before milk then you can do this
05:11 - you
05:19 - prepend now eggs showed up before milk
05:22 - because a prepend is basically going to
05:24 - do it at the very beginning of my
05:27 - element upend is going to go at the very
05:29 - end um gosh there's some other things
05:32 - and the other great thing about jQuery
05:34 - is it just all makes sense if I go
05:38 - ulli and just hit enter down here then
05:40 - you'll notice it gives me an array of
05:42 - all my elements I can go
05:46 - ulli EQ and this is going to get
05:50 - an it's going to get an index so eq0 so
05:55 - I'm just getting the zero index of that
05:57 - if you guys remember from doing
05:58 - JavaScript
06:00 - eq1 is milk so I can go lq1
06:04 - remove and it's gone then I can go lq0
06:09 - remove and it's gone so that's kind of
06:13 - the super basics of how you're going to
06:15 - use jQuery to start changing all sorts
06:17 - of stuff in your
06:20 - website Let's uh let's add a link and
06:24 - let's make a link do something
06:26 - smart
06:28 - um
06:30 - I'm going to make this hrf equal pound
06:32 - because we're not going to go anywhere
06:34 - with this this is just going to be a
06:35 - link actually I'll just do a
06:39 - button um this button will be ID add
06:46 - one so there's a button that says add
06:48 - one it does absolutely nothing so now
06:51 - what you can do with Jer though is you
06:53 - can go let's grab add
06:56 - one I'm going to go do click and this is
06:59 - the one thing you'll have to remember
07:01 - here
07:03 - function and then this syntax just feels
07:05 - really weird so you're doing click and
07:08 - then you're typing function open close
07:12 - brackets uh this is probably one of the
07:14 - weirder things if you're brand new it's
07:16 - like oh man this looks crazy and
07:18 - confusing you just memorize it and then
07:20 - you're done with it so type it out 10
07:22 - times in a row to force yourself to
07:24 - memorize it and you're going to be okay
07:26 - now whatever you add in here is going to
07:28 - happen whenever the function whenever it
07:31 - gets clicked so whenever I click on add
07:33 - one it's going to do all this fun
07:36 - stuff so if that makes sense um and then
07:39 - I'm going to space it so it's clear so
07:40 - now when I click this it's actually
07:41 - going to add a whole lot of veggies let
07:43 - me just do it where it does it
07:46 - once so now every time I do this it's
07:48 - going to add a row of
07:53 - veggies don't know why I did that sound
07:56 - uh let's make this get even smarter if
07:58 - I'm not going too fast for you I'd
08:00 - rather go too fast so you feel like
08:03 - you're drowning and then all of a sudden
08:05 - you wake up and realize wow I know quite
08:06 - a bit of JavaScript already you can
08:08 - always re-watch the video so I'm going
08:10 - to do an input which is
08:14 - a let me give this one an ID you'll see
08:18 - what an input is here
08:20 - soon name I'll just call it ID equals
08:23 - name so that's what an input is it's
08:26 - you've seen them in forms all over the
08:27 - place they allow you to input stuff we
08:28 - didn't talk about them before cuz we
08:31 - didn't have JavaScript to do anything
08:32 - smart with them so I had an input named
08:35 - name with an ID of name and the button
08:37 - add one so when add one
08:41 - clicks let's do this let's
08:46 - go we're going
08:48 - to
08:51 - go there Val U
08:57 - equals V
09:00 - andv gets the value of name it'll get
09:05 - the value of any input so here let me do
09:07 - this watch um I'm delete this and then
09:11 - I'm going to go alert
09:13 - value
09:15 - so now let me type in whatever
09:18 - here ah alert test so now I've grabbed
09:22 - my
09:23 - value out of name remember because my ID
09:26 - is name here so whenever I click on add
09:30 - one then it's going to say value equals
09:34 - name's value and I'm going to alert it
09:36 - or if you want you can console log
09:41 - it now it's going to appear in my
09:46 - console so that's kind of how that's
09:48 - going to work so I've I've grabbed my
09:50 - value out and now I'm going to go
09:57 - UL append
10:00 - and here's where where I'm going to do a
10:02 - string let me show you real quick about
10:04 - so I want to go
10:06 - Li and I want the value to be in
10:09 - here and this will not work this will
10:13 - just say value value value great it's
10:17 - actually putting a string of value I
10:19 - want it to get that in there let me come
10:22 - over here and show you how you insert
10:24 - different strings together um if I go
10:27 - name Plus
10:32 - value well now it says name value so I
10:34 - can actually go name space plus value
10:39 - and that's kind of how you can add two
10:41 - strings together into one what happens
10:44 - if I go name plus 20 so now I'm adding a
10:48 - string plus a number JavaScript is smart
10:50 - enough to say okay treat the number as a
10:52 - string because clearly you can't add
10:54 - name to 20 so that's kind of how you add
10:58 - stuff together so I'm going to do
11:00 - Li and then I'm going to go
11:04 - plus and I'm going to go and ending Li
11:07 - so I've got a string we're going to add
11:09 - in the string we're going to add it to
11:12 - our other string so now let's give this
11:15 - guy try so now I
11:17 - go veggies and I get add one
11:22 - ha boom I feel like we're doing real
11:26 - programming here this is awesome and
11:28 - let's pick pick up some friends at the
11:30 - store cuz who wants to go shopping with
11:32 - friends I do I do that's kind of your
11:34 - very very very very basics of using
11:37 - jQuery I don't know if you can see but
11:40 - jQuery kind of makes it pretty easy this
11:42 - is the most complicated bit of jargon we
11:44 - had to memorize that actually feels like
11:46 - code function open close what the heck
11:49 - does that do um
11:53 - and yeah I'll get into functions here
11:55 - before I let you go for today let's go
11:57 - back to our console real quick let's say
11:59 - jQuery is all good and all let's
12:01 - describe this so you understand what
12:03 - that means I'm going to actually we know
12:06 - that we can disc we can do variable name
12:08 - equals
12:10 - 30 uh age equals 30 and now name's
12:14 - defined so I going to name equals
12:19 - will so I want to do a function that
12:21 - alerts both of these or I want I want to
12:23 - do something that's reusable those are
12:25 - called functions when we do alert that's
12:27 - just a function that does something so I
12:30 - can go
12:31 - function alert
12:34 - name and remember I told you there's
12:36 - about six types in JavaScript well
12:38 - here's your next type it's called
12:40 - function alert
12:43 - name and that's you notice that looks
12:46 - pretty similar function alert name and
12:48 - this is going to go alert name so now I
12:52 - just go
12:53 - alert
12:55 - name there you go and it's always going
12:57 - to alert the name
13:00 - name let's say I want it to do something
13:02 - a little smarter than that plus let's
13:05 - call this alert name Plus
13:11 - Age let me add a space
13:14 - there there you go now this is going to
13:16 - alert name Plus Age so now I go alert oh
13:19 - it already knows that it
13:22 - exists will 30 so now I'm kind of
13:25 - defining this thing that does something
13:28 - for me um and so that's what's going on
13:32 - here is when you the actual official
13:35 - JavaScript click is that but then it
13:38 - needs to know what do I do when you
13:39 - click I need to do something so we're
13:42 - creating what's called an anonymous
13:43 - function we're creating a function right
13:44 - now with no name to it I mean you can
13:46 - give it a
13:47 - name um add value you can use the exact
13:52 - same thing we were using here function
13:55 - alert name ad value and that's what
13:57 - we're doing we're just creating a
13:58 - function we saying do this stuff right
14:00 - now this name is completely pointless
14:02 - because you're never going to call it
14:03 - again um but this
14:07 - works there you go and then this
14:14 - works U so that's kind of a little
14:16 - explanation of why we added that we're
14:18 - creating a function and we're giving it
14:20 - some
14:22 - functionality one other thing and this
14:24 - is the last thing since you've got a lot
14:26 - to learn and you probably want to go
14:27 - have some fun last thing with functions
14:29 - that you can do is you can give them
14:31 - arguments remember if you do alert what
14:33 - just going to do a blank alert and then
14:35 - you can give it something to alert you
14:37 - can give it your argument of 30 or I can
14:40 - say name age equals
14:46 - 30 yeah I can give it an argument how do
14:48 - we do that well you just go
14:56 - function I'll just go alert this + 10
14:59 - and then I'll say I'm giving in a
15:01 - variable name here I want you to give
15:04 - me I'm just going to call it the
15:09 - thing and then we're just going to go
15:13 - alert the thing plus 10 so now whatever
15:17 - we pass it is going to be referenced as
15:20 - the thing whenever we're inside the
15:22 - function this is going to kind of be
15:24 - what bends your brain a little bit show
15:26 - you how this works alert this + 10 and
15:30 - I'm going to just say 10 or
15:33 - 20 it's going to alert 30 why is it
15:37 - doing that because I said alert this
15:38 - plus 10 and I gave it 20 so now the
15:41 - function fires the function alert this
15:42 - plus 10 fires and it calls the thing
15:46 - equals 20 it kind of creates that
15:48 - variable for us so then it's going to
15:50 - alert 20 + 10 because we gave it 20 and
15:53 - called it the thing you can call that
15:56 - whatever you want I'll call it
15:59 - V for Value Val is kind of something
16:02 - developers will say a lot so I can go V
16:05 - plus 10 now I say alert this plus 1020
16:09 - yeah exact same thing it doesn't care
16:11 - what you call this um it just knows that
16:13 - whatever the first thing you give it is
16:15 - going to be called Val you can actually
16:16 - do several things
16:21 - together add these together V one vow
16:27 - two
16:32 - alert Val one plus Val two that's what
16:35 - it's going to
16:37 - do and what did I type
16:41 - wrong oh I didn't spell function right
16:44 - there we go verion okay so now if I go
16:47 - add these
16:52 - together there we go I still get
16:55 - 30 10 30 now I got 40 because it doesn't
16:59 - it doesn't care what those two things
17:00 - are this function just goes take Val one
17:03 - take Val two add them together and alert
17:06 - them so that's kind of functions and I'm
17:08 - definitely going to leave you there
17:09 - because I hit you with way too much this
17:10 - should have been two lessons but oh well
17:12 - please forgive me have some fun with
17:14 - jQuery write a couple
17:16 - functions annoy your friends with a
17:18 - million alerts and have an awesome day
