00:01 - Okay so we've gotten if you watched the
00:03 - last video to the point where we can now
00:05 - run an automated deployment for our
00:06 - nodejs app so let's make this better
00:09 - there's there's kind of a problem with
00:10 - forever even though most people that I
00:12 - know use forever for deployments forever
00:14 - has this problem and that for the word
00:16 - forever does not include if your server
00:18 - has to reboot for some reason if your
00:21 - server if digital Ocean or or Rackspace
00:24 - tends to do this whenever they have
00:25 - problems your servers all get rebooted
00:27 - and now your website's down because
00:29 - forever did not restart your service and
00:32 - so what we're going to actually do is
00:34 - run our noj node.js app as its own
00:37 - system service as its own upstart
00:39 - service and this is kind of like a
00:41 - higher or a midlevel uh Linux thing that
00:45 - we're going to be doing and so this way
00:48 - it'll automatically run whenever it
00:49 - starts so the first thing we're going to
00:51 - do is we're going to ssh in as root so
00:55 - let me exit and let me SSH into my
00:59 - server as
01:02 - Roots actually before I do that I'm
01:04 - going to ssh in as deploy and I'm going
01:06 - to stop my
01:08 - current if I go forever list I've got it
01:10 - running so I'm going to go forever stop
01:12 - all stop my existing forever
01:15 - service now I'm going to log in as
01:20 - root okay so I'm logged in as root and
01:23 - now I'm going to create this file Etsy
01:26 - init node app let me actually go into
01:28 - Etsy init see see on it okay so if I do
01:32 - a file list these are all the services
01:34 - that are starting on boot up um so
01:36 - basically if I create a newcon file a
01:39 - new configuration file then that service
01:41 - will also start so I'm going to copy and
01:44 - paste this code right here and I'm going
01:47 - actually I run this command first I will
01:49 - edit this file with Nano uh I prefer Vim
01:52 - basically Nano and Vim are text editors
01:55 - for your terminal since we don't really
01:58 - have a graphical user interface we have
02:00 - to use a terminal text editor Vim is
02:02 - better but Nano is easier so we'll be
02:05 - using Nano for this example if you're
02:07 - new to that and so now I'm in a file to
02:10 - edit going to copy this code and let's
02:13 - paste it in there we go so this is going
02:15 - to be my configuration file when do we
02:17 - start when file system and networking
02:19 - are started that's when we start our
02:21 - service and then we're going to change
02:23 - directory into home deploy node app
02:26 - that's where we are automatically that's
02:28 - where flight plan is pushing all our
02:29 - stuff
02:30 - to and then we're going to set some
02:32 - environment variables that our node app
02:34 - can listen to so if this is a staging
02:36 - server we would change that to staging
02:39 - and then our Port whatever our node Port
02:41 - is and this is the actual command to run
02:42 - our
02:43 - service uh we're finding node and then
02:46 - we're running bin www so that should
02:48 - make perfect sense to you I'm going to
02:51 - contrl X say y hit enter and there we go
02:55 - now we have a service so I can go start
02:58 - node app and it's running so let me go
03:02 - back over here hit refresh and you
03:04 - remember I stopped the forever service
03:06 - and it's still running cuz I've started
03:07 - this so I can go stop node
03:11 - app and I can hit refresh and it's dead
03:14 - dead service so start node app again and
03:17 - once again that's because it's called
03:19 - node app.on whatever you call the file
03:21 - is what the service name will be so now
03:24 - my service has been created um my next
03:26 - step is going to be give my deploy user
03:29 - the password or the ability to run that
03:33 - command that's really a root level
03:34 - command controlling services and so
03:37 - since my no since my deploy user is a
03:39 - part of the pseudo group I can run
03:42 - pseudo restart node app but it's going
03:45 - to ask for a password and I don't want
03:47 - to do that because I want this to be
03:48 - automated so I'm going to copy this
03:50 - command and I'm going to paste this
03:51 - command in and that will wh what did I
03:54 - do I guess I didn't copy it did
03:56 - I ah ruining everything there we go so
04:00 - now it is I have added that command in
04:02 - I've added that ability in and what that
04:04 - did is if you type
04:07 - viudo this is all these pseudo
04:09 - permissions and what I did is I just
04:10 - appended that to the end of my file so
04:13 - I'm deploy deploy now has the ability to
04:16 - run restart node app uh if you also want
04:19 - to give your deploy script the ability
04:21 - to run start node app and stop node app
04:25 - you can run
04:26 - Asin start node app
04:30 - and then sbin stop note
04:33 - app or if you want it to give the
04:35 - ability to run all um any Services stop
04:39 - start any Services just leave node app
04:41 - off so I'm not going to save this no
04:44 - don't save I only want my my deploy user
04:46 - to be able to
04:48 - passwordless restart the app uh that's
04:51 - as little permissions as I need so now I
04:53 - can exit
04:55 - out let's get out of there and now all I
04:57 - have to do is go adjust my flight plan
05:00 - file my flight plan. JS going to remove
05:03 - these two lines where I'm using forever
05:05 - don't use forever
05:07 - anymore let's use this pseudo restart
05:10 - node
05:12 - app there we go so it's going to EXA
05:14 - pseudo restart node app let's test
05:16 - deploy this fly
05:23 - production and it's
05:27 - moving there you go finish just fine it
05:30 - was actually slightly faster it felt
05:31 - like and my service is still running
05:34 - let's just triple check this and will be
05:38 - done for sure let me go to My Views
05:41 - index Jade welcome to title let's shout
05:44 - tidle yay let's run a
05:46 - deployment fly to
05:50 - production I kind of like the fly
05:52 - command it feels
05:54 - very
05:56 - successful there we go welcome to
05:58 - express and that is deploying with
06:00 - node.js as a service oh yes let's do the
06:02 - real test um let's log in and reboot our
06:07 - server
06:09 - reboot there you go system is going down
06:11 - for reboot now and then let's go and try
06:15 - this it's not working because my
06:17 - server's down server should be up in
06:20 - about five there we go and now it's back
06:23 - and my service is running and I've
06:24 - deployed as a service so hope this helps
06:27 - you out and have a great day
