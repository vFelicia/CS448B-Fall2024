00:01 - hey there I've had a lot of people ask
00:03 - me uh to do a quick video just kind of
00:05 - showing my Sublime Tech settings and any
00:07 - packages that I find useful um and I
00:09 - keep a pretty simple layout but I'll go
00:12 - ahead and show you what I have right now
00:14 - uh the first thing you'll notice is my
00:15 - theme the theme is pre-dawn um and I
00:18 - love it because it also themes the UI
00:20 - gives it a really nice looking feel uh
00:22 - when I'm not using preon I'm probably
00:24 - using flat land or Dracula uh for an
00:28 - actual theme but I love the UI theme
00:30 - that pedon gives you um another thing
00:34 - that I use is G gutter uh G gutter
00:38 - is is a package that I love because it
00:40 - kind of as you can see over here in the
00:42 - gutter it's going to show you your
00:43 - GitHub changes if you've added some
00:45 - lines or if I've made changes to this it
00:47 - shows up as uh blue for changed or red
00:51 - for removed super super cool so you can
00:54 - see the diff real time with your GitHub
00:56 - stuff uh definitely love git gutter
01:00 - um I also use EMT for code completion
01:03 - that's probably the one that some of you
01:04 - guys have seen and wondered what that is
01:06 - that just basically allows me to go div
01:09 - class
01:10 - special ah sure whatever special and
01:13 - then it's and hit Tab and it's
01:14 - automatically going to complete some
01:16 - stuff some other stuff you can do with
01:17 - EMT I'll put a cheat sheet uh URL in the
01:20 - description but you can go d
01:23 - special um and then I don't know put an
01:26 - H4 inside of it uh you can also do plus
01:31 - for a sibling to that H4 super cool and
01:34 - then you can tab through and
01:35 - automatically fill it out so when you
01:37 - get good with EMT HTML is a breeze uh
01:41 - some more complex stuff you can do is
01:42 - you can have it number stuff I can go Li
01:45 - times five I'll actually have it Go Li
01:48 - ID uh sorry panel and then number which
01:52 - will actually do the number of it times
01:54 - 5 so now I got panel 1 2 3 4 5 super
01:57 - cool if I didn't like that I could do
01:59 - dollar dollar it would do twod digigit
02:02 - um numbers there so that' be panel 01 02
02:05 - 03 0405 took me a long time to realize
02:08 - that EMT could do that I really like
02:10 - that EMT does that uh you can also wrap
02:13 - stuff in
02:15 - parentheses um so I can go a div with a
02:19 - UL Li Time 5 and I can do times five of
02:23 - those so now I've got five uls with five
02:26 - liis in it sometimes with Sublime Text
02:28 - you'll get this weird quirk where you
02:30 - hit Tab and nothing happens on that when
02:31 - you're doing the wraps and you'll see
02:34 - down under here a number keeps clicking
02:36 - you have to tab like 10 times it's just
02:39 - a quirk that happens sometimes most of
02:41 - the time it works um and I haven't quite
02:43 - figured out when it doesn't work but
02:45 - just in case you run into that um
02:47 - another cool thing with EMT is there's a
02:50 - lot of cool shortcuts with EMT that I
02:51 - don't have memorized but if you hit
02:53 - control D on a Mac it's going to
02:55 - automatically select everything within
02:57 - your current tag so you can easily
02:59 - condense stuff or delete stuff uh so
03:02 - that's EMT and then honestly Let's see
03:05 - we get gutter my theme I do have like a
03:08 - custom tiny little bash script we can go
03:11 - sub and then open a file in Sublime Text
03:15 - as you can see I use it all the time
03:17 - even as I Was preparing for this video
03:18 - so I could go sub index.html and it's
03:21 - going to open index.html or sub
03:25 - main.js yeah and that that I use all the
03:27 - time once again I'll put the video link
03:29 - to that in the description for how to
03:31 - put that bash script together very very
03:34 - useful I end up using that thing all day
03:36 - long um and then I just use honestly
03:38 - some Sublime Text hot Keys you know like
03:41 - apple d uh for multiple
03:44 - cursors you know to be able to change
03:46 - stuff
03:49 - um you know you can easily do Apple D um
03:52 - Apple D also has this thing Apple K
03:54 - where you can skip a selection if you
03:56 - want um which is very useful uh what are
03:59 - other Sublime Text ones it took me a
04:01 - while to realize control Apple up and
04:03 - down is going to move any line up and
04:06 - down through your stuff super cool I'm
04:08 - sure that's probably different on PC um
04:10 - I do have a cool cheat sheet that I'll
04:12 - also add to the description for that
04:14 - once again that's Apple control up and
04:16 - down I use that all the time it just
04:18 - moves your line up and down um you can
04:21 - also use apple brackets to change your
04:24 - indentation instead of Apple instead of
04:27 - tab and um shift tab with which tab and
04:30 - shift tab work great when you're on
04:32 - multiple lines selected but if you just
04:34 - want to indent your one line apple and
04:36 - then your your brackets there you go
04:39 - your left and right brackets will indent
04:41 - whatever line you're on uh use that one
04:43 - all the time as well and honestly that's
04:46 - about as complex as I do with Sublime I
04:49 - mean it's got kind of its basic things a
04:52 - lot of times I won't use the sidebar and
04:54 - I'll just use apple p uh to hotkey back
04:57 - through my recent files I'll use p and
05:00 - enter to go back and forth between two
05:02 - files this is kind of basic Sublime Text
05:04 - stuff I don't know if you guys know that
05:07 - or don't know it or not and apple R will
05:09 - take you through all the symbols in your
05:10 - file so Apple R can take me to the init
05:13 - function and to the method function um
05:16 - but that's about it that's pretty much
05:17 - as complicated as my Sublime setup is
05:20 - hope it helped you a little bit and
05:21 - honestly if you have great stuff I'm all
05:23 - ears I'd love to see it uh comment below
05:26 - I'd love to hear any great tips you guys
05:28 - have found as well have a great day

Cleaned transcript:

hey there I've had a lot of people ask me uh to do a quick video just kind of showing my Sublime Tech settings and any packages that I find useful um and I keep a pretty simple layout but I'll go
