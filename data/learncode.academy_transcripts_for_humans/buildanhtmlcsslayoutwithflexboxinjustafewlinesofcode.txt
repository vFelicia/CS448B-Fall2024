00:00 - in this course we are learning web
00:01 - development from the absolute beginning
00:03 - and if you've missed any of the other
00:04 - videos the link to the whole course is
00:06 - in the description
00:08 - so moving forward here in the last video
00:10 - we used margin and padding to create our
00:12 - basic containers for our entire web page
00:15 - and all the content that will go in
00:16 - those containers in this video we're
00:18 - going to learn how to actually finish
00:19 - our layout by using different display
00:22 - styles different display properties in
00:24 - css i'll show you how we're going to do
00:26 - this and what those display properties
00:28 - are by creating three divs here in this
00:30 - triple section so i'm gonna do div times
00:33 - three and hit tab that's a nice little
00:35 - thing we can do and i get to also tab
00:37 - i'm gonna hit a tab b tab c tab and now
00:41 - whoops there we go and now i actually
00:43 - have some content in there so i'm going
00:44 - to go ahead and save this
00:46 - you can see by default they get what's
00:47 - called a block layout and i'm going to
00:49 - start showing you um how this all works
00:52 - in css and how we can change that
00:54 - default display i'm just going to target
00:56 - every single div on the page since i
00:58 - only have three divs right now and let's
01:01 - go and give them a background color of
01:03 - red
01:05 - that way i can actually see what i'm
01:06 - dealing with so you can see that by
01:08 - default a div fills out its entire
01:11 - container if you remember this section
01:13 - has a padding of 20 pixels on all sides
01:15 - so the actual inside of the container
01:18 - starts here and goes all the way over to
01:20 - here and a div by default gets what's
01:22 - called display
01:25 - block you see if i change it to display
01:26 - block nothing happens because it's
01:28 - already display block i can change this
01:31 - display mode to several different things
01:32 - i can make display inline
01:35 - display inline is going to put them all
01:37 - one in a row and each box will be the
01:39 - size of its content so if a gets a lot
01:42 - more a's in it then it gets larger but
01:45 - what i cannot do with display inline is
01:47 - actually set a width
01:49 - so i can't say this is 100 pixels wide
01:51 - it's not going to do anything display
01:53 - inline totally looks at the content
01:56 - inside of that div and sizes itself
01:59 - accordingly so if you actually want to
02:00 - make it a fixed width you can do inline
02:03 - block
02:04 - and now i can set those to be 100 pixels
02:06 - wide so now each one of them is 100
02:09 - pixels wide because they're in line but
02:11 - it's also a block and i get to tell that
02:13 - block how wide and how tall to be i can
02:15 - also give it a height
02:16 - of 20 pixels so then it's going to be 20
02:19 - pixels tall which it looks like they're
02:20 - already kind of that high just because
02:22 - the text so you have block and you have
02:24 - inline block and another fun display
02:27 - which is much more complicated is called
02:29 - flex what you have to do for flex is you
02:32 - have to add it to the parent container
02:35 - so whatever the parent of all these divs
02:36 - is that is the section tag you're going
02:38 - to want to make that display flex
02:42 - so there we go we have display flex on
02:45 - there
02:45 - and i'm going to go ahead get rid of
02:47 - inline block here just going to leave
02:48 - those block and you can see that flex
02:51 - automatically does an inline block type
02:53 - of thing here so we're going to do then
02:56 - is we're going to go flex direction
03:00 - and you have several options here you
03:01 - can do row you can do column you can do
03:03 - reverse row so let's make it row and
03:05 - that's what the default is you can also
03:07 - do row dash reverse
03:10 - which is not nearly as useful and
03:12 - actually does something a little unusual
03:13 - it takes the first div and puts it all
03:16 - the way on the right and then goes
03:17 - backwards from there you can also tell
03:20 - the flex direction to be column
03:23 - and that's going to go top to bottom and
03:25 - as you guessed you can do column reverse
03:27 - which seems even less useful let's take
03:29 - our top div and put it on the bottom and
03:31 - go backwards from there but it does have
03:33 - its purposes i'm sure to some people
03:35 - somewhere on the earth so let's go back
03:37 - to flex direction row which is kind of
03:39 - our default we just have to do one
03:41 - little magic thing
03:42 - margin auto
03:44 - and now boom
03:46 - it's automatically going to be flexed
03:48 - across the whole width so if i stretch
03:51 - my window out here you can see the boxes
03:54 - stay a hundred pixels wide but they're
03:57 - always going to be flexed across the
03:59 - entire content and the margins are
04:01 - automatically taken care of we have a
04:03 - half margin here
04:05 - a half margin here another half margin
04:07 - you can see that it just looks correct
04:09 - it looks the way that it should work
04:11 - there's a lot more options with flexbox
04:13 - that you can do display flex is called
04:15 - flexbox that's we're doing what's called
04:18 - a flexbox layout in here that's very
04:20 - important that you know that
04:22 - and so that's how we're going to account
04:24 - for those three divs that we have going
04:27 - on i'm going to get rid of some extra
04:28 - a's here so let's go and move on to a
04:30 - navigation how would we handle a
04:31 - navigation it's a little bit different
04:33 - we actually want to use inline block
04:35 - instead so let's go over to this header
04:37 - here and let's add a few tags in here
04:39 - let's add an h1
04:40 - tag we'll call it title
04:43 - let's also add a nav tag nav is a
04:46 - semantic tag so it doesn't do anything
04:47 - it's just a div
04:49 - and so what's inside of this we're gonna
04:50 - do a ul with three lis let's do a ul
04:54 - and i'm gonna do this i'm gonna do a
04:55 - greater than symbol li times three that
04:58 - says hey give me a ul and inside of that
05:01 - ul give me three lis boom so that's done
05:04 - right there let's say this is gonna be
05:06 - our navigation home
05:07 - uh locations and contacts
05:11 - let's say we're going to make a website
05:12 - for a bakery maybe they'll make awesome
05:15 - cupcakes or something like that who
05:16 - doesn't love cupcakes so this is going
05:18 - to be our top navigation and then this
05:20 - will be our title here so let's go ahead
05:22 - and style this navigation properly i'll
05:24 - go ahead here and do a ul
05:27 - and the ul is basically let's do a
05:28 - margin of zero ul's by default have some
05:31 - margin and padding to them
05:33 - padding of zero and i want these bullet
05:36 - points to go away so i'm going to do
05:37 - list style type
05:40 - none
05:41 - that's the magic word for making all
05:43 - those bullets go away we want no list
05:45 - style type so that's our ul and then the
05:48 - allies i'm going to give them a display
05:49 - inline block
05:53 - and now they're going to lay out boom
05:54 - boom just how we'd expect them to lay
05:56 - out i can also give them a margin let's
05:58 - give them a margin of 20 pixels
06:02 - now we are set up of course we have a
06:04 - left margin here so i don't really want
06:06 - that i have a couple choices for what i
06:08 - can do here i can give them a 0 top
06:10 - 20 pixel right 0
06:13 - and 0 which also accounts for basically
06:16 - we're only adding margin right
06:18 - or i can also explicitly say margin dash
06:20 - rights
06:21 - is 20 pixels and do that as well that is
06:24 - the exact same thing so you can also
06:26 - specify margins by just picking one
06:28 - value you want to change so as you can
06:31 - see it's starting to look like a website
06:33 - but there's a few things we need to do
06:35 - from here first of all we need to
06:36 - actually learn how to make multiple
06:38 - pages because we're going to need a
06:39 - locations page and a contact page and
06:41 - we're also going to need to css target a
06:43 - little differently this rule right here
06:45 - for instance will apply to every div on
06:48 - our entire page and that's not correct
06:50 - so in the next lesson we are going to
06:52 - learn how to build out the rest of that
06:54 - website with multiple pages and target
06:56 - css in a better way
07:03 - you

in this course we are learning web development from the absolute beginning and if you've missed any of the other videos the link to the whole course is in the description so moving forward here in the last video we used margin and padding to create our basic containers for our entire web page and all the content that will go in those containers in this video we're going to learn how to actually finish our layout by using different display styles different display properties in css i'll show you how we're going to do this and what those display properties are by creating three divs here in

flex what you have to do for flex is you have to add it to the parent container so whatever the parent of all these divs is that is the section tag you're going to want to make that display flex so there we go we have display flex on there and i'm going to go ahead get rid of inline block here just going to leave those block and you can see that flex automatically does an inline block type of thing here so we're going to do then is we're going to go flex direction and you have several options here you can do row you can do column you can do reverse row so let's make it row and that's what

default we just have to do one little magic thing margin auto and now boom it's automatically going to be flexed across the whole width so if i stretch my window out here you can see the boxes stay a hundred pixels wide but they're always going to be flexed across the entire content and the margins are automatically taken care of we have a half margin here a half margin here another half margin you can see that it just looks correct it looks the way that it should work there's a lot more options with flexbox that you can do display flex is called flexbox that's we're doing what's called a flexbox layout in here that's very important that you know that and so that's how we're going to account for those three divs that we have going on i'm going to get rid of some extra a's here so let's go and move on to a navigation how would we handle a navigation it's a little bit different we actually want to use inline block instead so let's go over to this header here and let's add a few tags in here let's add an h1 tag we'll call it title let's also add a nav tag nav is a semantic tag so it doesn't do anything it's just a div and so what's inside of this we're gonna do a ul with three lis

is gonna be our navigation home uh locations and contacts let's say we're going to make a website for a bakery maybe they'll make awesome cupcakes or something like that who doesn't love cupcakes so this is going to be our top navigation and then this will be our title here so let's go ahead and style this navigation properly i'll go ahead here and do a ul and the ul is basically let's do a

all those bullets go away we want no list style type so that's our ul and then the allies i'm going to give them a display inline block and now they're going to lay out boom boom just how we'd expect them to lay out i can also give them a margin let's give them a margin of 20 pixels now we are set up of course we have a left margin here so i don't really want that i have a couple choices for what i can do here i can give them a 0 top 20 pixel right 0 and 0 which also accounts for basically we're only adding margin right or i can also explicitly say margin dash rights is 20 pixels and do that
