00:00 - all right so these next two videos are
00:02 - actually going to be a lot of fun for
00:04 - anybody who's ever tried e-commerce
00:06 - before um I've had to do e-commerce
00:08 - several times and if you're using a
00:11 - e-commerce platform usually they're this
00:14 - bulky PHP annoying thing uh that's just
00:18 - annoying like when people ask me to hey
00:20 - will you develop e-commerce for me I
00:22 - usually Grimace and just I don't want to
00:24 - do it because it's one of the less fun
00:26 - things that you do as a developer um
00:28 - however this company recently reached
00:30 - out and said hey would you be interested
00:31 - in looking at a product and featuring it
00:33 - and I said well I've got to like the
00:34 - product any product before I tell people
00:37 - about it uh but let me take a look at it
00:39 - um and honestly I fell in love with it
00:41 - I'm pretty much going to be using this
00:43 - for e-commerce stuff in the future
00:44 - because it's so easy and so cool so I
00:48 - wrote him back a little while later and
00:49 - said yes I'm definitely going to do a
00:51 - video on this and so what Molton the
00:54 - company Molton has done is they've taken
00:56 - the whole big platform out of it they
00:59 - said we're not going to provide you a
01:00 - platform we're going to give you apis
01:02 - that connect to the admin tool that all
01:05 - your support staff uses to enter
01:07 - products and update prices and blah blah
01:09 - blah and then you get to build it in
01:12 - anything you want so for JavaScript
01:14 - users you can build it in angular or
01:16 - Ember or whatever for PHP users you can
01:18 - build it in any framework you want yes
01:21 - anybody that's done e-commerce before is
01:23 - already really excited so I'm going to
01:24 - show you the API real quick and then in
01:26 - the next video we're going to build an
01:27 - angular app and we're going to build out
01:30 - almost the entire store in just minutes
01:33 - so let's real quick look at Molton what
01:34 - it is what it does basically create a
01:37 - free tier account their free tier gives
01:39 - you like 30,000 API requests a month I
01:42 - believe it's quite a bit um and so you
01:46 - create a new store it takes like two
01:48 - questions and you have a store and as a
01:51 - developer that's about all you have to
01:53 - do you can access your API keys right
01:55 - here um for that store and then you can
01:59 - also add
02:00 - admins administrators uh to the store
02:03 - that can log into the dashboard uh let
02:05 - me show you the dashboard real quick uh
02:08 - the dashboard is what all your support
02:09 - staff will use or if you're a small
02:11 - company you'll use it uh but it's a
02:13 - great separation of concerns because
02:15 - developers don't need to worry shouldn't
02:17 - have to worry about orders inventory
02:19 - shipping any of that junk uh and so it's
02:23 - a really clean slick inventory
02:26 - management tool I went ahead and added
02:28 - three products took no time at all
02:30 - and so we're going to use apis from here
02:32 - on out to access the store and start
02:35 - building our store any way we want to um
02:39 - and so let's look since we're going to
02:40 - be doing angular let's look at the
02:42 - JavaScript API I won't really touch the
02:44 - PHP API although it's pretty much just
02:47 - as simple so let me go ahead I have this
02:50 - local host file spun up over here and
02:53 - here's my basic HTML file now to start
02:56 - off with Molton you're going to copy
02:57 - that API key and you need to load in
03:00 - their SDK right here which they have all
03:03 - this in their docs they do have really
03:04 - good docs especially for a new company
03:06 - they have really good docs so you create
03:08 - your new molten object and then you do a
03:11 - molten do
03:14 - authenticate um and then that's just
03:15 - going to give you a callback function
03:17 - when it's authenticated when it's
03:18 - connected to your store um and so from
03:21 - there on out you can make API calls and
03:23 - they're very straightforward you can go
03:25 - Molton do category. list category
03:30 - list and I'm not going to pass it any
03:33 - filters of any
03:35 - kind and so let's just console log
03:40 - categories whoops I want to console log
03:43 - that man I can't okay there we go so I'm
03:46 - just going to console log categories
03:47 - after I get them let's Let Live reload
03:49 - pick that up and there we go I've got my
03:51 - one category which is the default
03:53 - uncategorized category uh it's got my
03:56 - description it's got my ID so let's go
03:58 - ahead and now get all the products that
04:00 - are in that category I'm going to snatch
04:03 - that ID out so I can go molten
04:07 - product. list uh and I can search
04:12 - category is that ID right there and the
04:14 - ID does have to be a string it cannot be
04:16 - a
04:17 - number and
04:20 - products so there we go that's going to
04:22 - call back and let's just console log
04:27 - products there we go I've got my three
04:29 - three products right there super easy
04:32 - simple to do let's snatch a product ID
04:35 - um let's just do a product get let's get
04:38 - this ID I think that's all I have to do
04:40 - if I recall
04:42 - correctly all their apis are named
04:44 - correctly they really make sents which
04:46 - is nice see yep there's my product
04:48 - there's my pricing um it's got both
04:50 - formatted pricing with tax without tax
04:53 - which is really cool um raw stuff um
04:57 - you've also got apis to create customer
05:00 - customer logins so yes you don't have to
05:02 - manage
05:03 - customers um and then that way they can
05:06 - add in all their information basically
05:08 - anything you'd get in a full featured
05:09 - shopping cart you can do via simple apis
05:13 - um let's go ahead and I have that
05:14 - product number right there and now I can
05:17 - add it to my
05:18 - cart cart insert that the second Pam is
05:22 - how many you want I want to add three of
05:24 - that to my cart there's some third Pam
05:27 - that's always got to be null I'm not
05:28 - quite sure what that for maybe it's for
05:30 - something in the future but for now that
05:33 - has to be in
05:34 - there um so we're adding that product
05:37 - three times and I will return a cart so
05:40 - let's go ahead and add that product I
05:42 - have already added it before so I should
05:43 - see a lot more than three in there yeah
05:46 - I see uh the price is $10.99 and I've
05:49 - got 10 of them in there right now so uh
05:53 - there we go and that's going to show me
05:55 - kind of my
05:56 - totals formatted here's where my cart's
05:59 - sitting right now
06:00 - now um and that's basically the
06:03 - JavaScript API super easy I'm not going
06:05 - to bore you with every API call you can
06:07 - do let's get into fun stuff in the next
06:09 - video we're going to do angular and
06:11 - we're going to use the yman angular
06:13 - generator which I've been wanting to do
06:14 - for a while anyway because it really
06:16 - speeds up your angular development um
06:19 - you basically don't have to do any
06:20 - boiler plates and we're going to build
06:22 - out a shopping cart all the way up to
06:24 - check out in a matter of minutes so
06:26 - let's go ahead and cover that video

Cleaned transcript:

all right so these next two videos are actually going to be a lot of fun for anybody who's ever tried ecommerce before um I've had to do ecommerce several times and if you're using a ecommerce

back and let's just console log products there we go I've got my three three products right there super easy simple to do let's snatch a product ID um let's just do a product get let's get this ID I think that's all I have to do if I recall correctly all their apis are named correctly they really make sents which is nice see yep there's my product there's my pricing um it's got both formatted

here's where my cart's sitting right now now um and that's basically the JavaScript API super easy I'm not going to bore you with every API call you can do let's get into fun stuff in the next video we're going to do angular and we're going to use the yman angular generator which I've been wanting to do for a while anyway because it really speeds up your angular development um you basically don't
