00:00 - in this video we're going to learn how
00:01 - to use the vue.js framework it's one of
00:03 - the top three frameworks you should know
00:05 - these days and it's really simple to
00:07 - learn and fun to use it's a lot like
00:09 - angular in many ways but its simple
00:12 - nature makes it a lot more enjoyable
00:14 - especially for newer coders as a first
00:16 - framework so let's go ahead and get into
00:18 - it i have a html file here and that's
00:21 - going to reload onto this page here as i
00:23 - type and save so let's go ahead and
00:25 - start by using emmett to just get a
00:27 - basic html document set up let's say h1
00:31 - my app
00:32 - and then let's actually make the app
00:34 - here so div with an id of app i give it
00:38 - an id of id
00:39 - let's change that to app so there we go
00:41 - that's my actual html document
00:43 - everything else will happen
00:45 - through vue.js in this id app here so
00:49 - let's go and get view on the page we can
00:51 - do that by adding a single script tag
00:54 - unpackage.com view and then let's add a
00:57 - javascript file here for us
01:05 - we'll add main js let's make that
01:07 - main.js file
01:10 - and there we go so view is on the page
01:12 - and then it's loading our main js and
01:14 - the rest of the app can happen in here
01:17 - since view is already on the page we can
01:19 - get started by going const app equals
01:22 - new view
01:23 - and we're just going to give it an empty
01:25 - object for now so now we have gone ahead
01:27 - and we have created our application but
01:30 - it's not mounting on the page anywhere
01:32 - so we want to tell it to mount to id app
01:35 - which is this div element here so let's
01:37 - go el
01:39 - and give it a string app so it's
01:41 - basically going to find that
01:43 - and then it will be mounted onto the
01:45 - page now let's go ahead and actually
01:47 - tell this application to create some
01:49 - html for us we can do that by specifying
01:52 - a template value
01:55 - and this can just be a string so we can
01:57 - say h1
01:58 - hi
02:01 - and now our application will re-render
02:03 - and we will see that our app has boom
02:05 - said hello to us i'm going to actually
02:07 - change this to an es6 template string so
02:10 - i can go multi-line and it'll be a lot
02:12 - easier so now i can go h1 like this hi
02:15 - what i cannot do is i cannot add two
02:18 - different elements without a wrapping
02:20 - tag you need to return one top level tag
02:23 - i'll show you what this means so hi
02:26 - and then this will fail hello
02:30 - you can see i'm going to get an error
02:31 - here in the console that says whoops
02:34 - seeing two tags here you can only return
02:36 - one root element so what you do in this
02:39 - case is you just return a div
02:42 - that has multiple elements inside of it
02:44 - as many as you want basically as long as
02:46 - you return one top level element you'll
02:48 - be good with your view template so let's
02:51 - do a little bit more before we end this
02:52 - video let's go ahead and create some
02:54 - data values and get those real time
02:57 - injecting into our application so if you
02:59 - create a data object this object can be
03:02 - as big or as small as you want it to be
03:05 - let's start real simple here let's just
03:06 - say name
03:08 - bobby
03:10 - age
03:11 - 25
03:12 - so there we go we've created that object
03:14 - here and instead of saying hi hello
03:16 - let's say name
03:18 - and then you can use mustache syntax the
03:20 - template automatically gets these data
03:22 - values put in in a mustache type of
03:26 - syntax so i can say uh give me the name
03:28 - value
03:30 - and i can say give me the age value
03:33 - so now those will spit out right now
03:35 - we'll see name bobby age 25. you can
03:38 - also make this as deep as you want it to
03:40 - be so i could say bobby let's make a
03:42 - whole object just for him
03:47 - bobby boone
03:50 - and then let's say there's john here
03:56 - i don't know why i always use hillbilly
03:58 - names it just seems fun i guess
04:01 - so then we can actually say
04:04 - john.name
04:06 - and we say john.age
04:10 - so now we'll spit out john's name in
04:12 - john's age let's change this one down
04:15 - here to be bobby name bobby age so you
04:17 - can basically do as many dots as you
04:18 - want and keep
04:20 - going deeper and deeper into that data
04:29 - there we go so now we have john
04:31 - and bobby and we're spinning out their
04:34 - names and ages so i'll leave you at that
04:36 - for now for this video that's how you
04:38 - get started with your very first view
04:39 - app get it connected to the dom
04:42 - spit out some data in the next video
04:44 - we're going to look at how to use this
04:46 - data in a more complex way loop through
04:48 - items
04:49 - and interact with user events
04:57 - you
