00:17 - new technology and enjoy the learning
00:19 - curve and the pain of learning that new
00:20 - technology to give you guys a little bit
00:23 - of extra encouragement and incentive I
00:25 - will be giving away a beautiful dot
00:27 - keyboard ultimate for yes I reached out
00:30 - to the awesome people adopt keyboard
00:32 - because I have long since loved and
00:34 - admired their beautiful mechanical
00:35 - keyboards I said hey would you provide
00:37 - one so I can give way to coders to
00:39 - encourage them to code and they said
00:41 - yeah that's a paraphrase this is
00:44 - something like that and so anyway this
00:46 - is a dot keyboard ultimate 4 as you
00:49 - notice there's no key cap inscriptions
00:51 - why would I give this one away well let
00:53 - me tell you the story how Das Keyboard
00:55 - came into being the owner and founder
00:57 - actually created a blank keyboard for
01:00 - himself because he wanted to type better
01:02 - he got it within a few weeks that he was
01:04 - typing double the speed so then all his
01:06 - friends wanted one I mean dot keyboard
01:09 - was born so if you're a web developer
01:11 - you're in development and you don't
01:13 - touch type meaning typed by sense of
01:15 - feel and knowledge of where the keys are
01:17 - you really should be touch typing I mean
01:19 - this is your career this is what you do
01:21 - or if you're learning this is what you
01:22 - want to do you should learn how to touch
01:24 - type it's not that hard to do and
01:27 - honestly getting a keyboard like this
01:28 - will get you there a lot faster and
01:31 - honestly the ultimate four looks amazing
01:34 - while you can get a dot keyboard with
01:37 - all the letters on there I specifically
01:39 - said give me the without the letters it
01:41 - looks cooler and it will be more
01:42 - beneficial to whoever wins this it's
01:44 - also cheering MX switches which are
01:46 - arguably the best switches you can have
01:49 - so that way if you're in an office
01:51 - setting its clicky but it's quiet it's
01:55 - about it allows a normal keyboard listen
01:56 - to that one of the reasons this keyboard
01:59 - specifically the dock keyboard ultimate
02:01 - is so quiet is this is aluminum not
02:04 - plastic it's beautiful anodized aluminum
02:07 - which actually makes it feel and sound
02:10 - very
02:11 - different from a keyboard encased in
02:13 - cheap plastic housing it feels well
02:15 - listened to it I mean that that's quiet
02:19 - and it feels better that's one of the
02:21 - things I love about DAF keyboard their
02:23 - quality is really really good and
02:25 - honestly for a cherry MX blue keyboard
02:28 - or a Cherry MX you know blue or brown
02:30 - this is brown you're not going to find a
02:33 - better price point really this is 169
02:36 - that's about as good as you get while
02:38 - you might be able to find cheaper
02:40 - guaranteed it's going to be cheaper
02:41 - construction along with it so that's
02:45 - pretty much it dot keyboard ultimate for
