00:01 - what if you could automate routine
00:02 - things that you do in the terminal every
00:04 - day like switch to a very long and
00:07 - complex folder path that you normally
00:08 - have to go CD space CD space um or maybe
00:11 - open a file or a folder directly in
00:13 - Sublime Text today we learn in this very
00:16 - quick video how to do that it will only
00:18 - apply to Mac and Linux and Unix users uh
00:21 - it will not apply to WN to Windows users
00:22 - I'm sorry there are ways to do it but
00:24 - that's just it's completely different
00:26 - from this video so what you're going to
00:27 - do is you're going to go to Sublime text
00:29 - or your favorite text editor and you're
00:30 - going to open a new document and we're
00:32 - going to save what's called The Bash
00:34 - profile folder I can't type and talk at
00:38 - the same time if you guys wonder why I
00:40 - do that okay so the file in your user
00:42 - directory called bash profile is the
00:45 - file we're going to update and what that
00:47 - is is that runs every time you open a
00:49 - new terminal session so let's go ahead
00:51 - and make an alias and Alias just is a
00:53 - shortcut basically for a command Alias
00:56 - let's go n now I'll just make it super
01:00 - simple I'll just call it engine X for an
01:02 - engine X project that I'm working on if
01:04 - I go engine X then the command then I
01:06 - basically do quotes and anything in the
01:08 - quotes is the actual command it runs
01:10 - when I type engine X so I'm going to go
01:13 - code
01:14 - sandbox engine X engine so that's a long
01:17 - folder name that I hate typing I'm
01:19 - always having to type it and I'm going
01:21 - to echo which will tell me this will
01:24 - basically just Echo whatever I put in
01:25 - here and this is just my reference to
01:28 - remember that I have this command
01:32 - okay let me go ahead and hit save I'm
01:34 - going to go to my user folder
01:36 - bash
01:38 - profile there we go it warns me that dot
01:41 - is only for system files and then I'm
01:42 - going to replace it and I say yeah okay
01:44 - so now if I create a new terminal
01:46 - session you'll notice that it echoes
01:48 - this that's why I type the echo here so
01:50 - whenever I open a new window of any kind
01:52 - I'm always going to Echo that and so now
01:55 - I can just type engine
01:58 - X there we go and it automatically took
02:00 - me all the way up to my engine X folder
02:02 - which is my usercode sandbox /in x/g X
02:07 - awesome let's here's another very useful
02:09 - one and that's I call it sub which is
02:12 - for Sublime Text um I'm going to go open
02:15 - this is actually a function A bash
02:17 - function looks like JavaScript in a lot
02:19 - of ways number one or dollar one is my
02:22 - first argument that I pass it I'll show
02:24 - you in a second how to use that and
02:26 - then- a is my application names and I'm
02:28 - going to go Sublime
02:30 - text so there we go and then I'm going
02:33 - to Echo my you know REM
02:43 - reminder open file in Sublime there we
02:46 - go let's save that and let's go ahead
02:49 - and now I have to open a new session
02:50 - always have to open a new terminal for
02:52 - these things to activate just so you
02:53 - know if I type sub here nothing happens
02:56 - says command not found I open a new
02:59 - terminal window and I'm going to be fine
03:01 - so now I can go let me see what I got
03:03 - here I can go sub music and voila it
03:07 - opened the music folder as if it were a
03:09 - project in Sublime Text super cool let
03:12 - me go to my engine X folder
03:14 - now and let me see what I got let me go
03:17 - sub vagrant
03:20 - file nice so now I can easily open a
03:23 - file I can easily open a project if you
03:25 - want to open the folder you're in you
03:27 - just do Dot and there you go now I got
03:29 - my whole engine x file and that's a
03:31 - super fun little trick that lots of
03:32 - people don't know about that you allows
03:35 - you to automate a lot of things in
03:36 - terminal create your own shortcuts and
03:38 - generally enjoy life more have a great
03:47 - day
