00:00 - in this whole series we are going to be
00:02 - learning JavaScript and the reason is
00:04 - simple because JavaScript rocks it's
00:07 - arguably the most popular language
00:10 - around today and it's running in pretty
00:13 - much every web browser so if you're
00:15 - using your iPhone to view a website or
00:18 - your iPad or your Android or Chrome or a
00:20 - super old version of Internet Explorer
00:22 - it's pretty much going to be running
00:23 - JavaScript and what it does and
00:25 - JavaScript basically adds function to
00:27 - your website to your HTML and CSS so say
00:30 - I want to keep track of how many times
00:32 - this button has been clicked two times
00:35 - three times four times that's JavaScript
00:38 - or say I want to click this and it shows
00:40 - some super secret hidden content that's
00:42 - also JavaScript or say I'm working on a
00:45 - form and I wanted to do something my
00:47 - name is Will hey Will's a great name
00:49 - well thank you this computer's brilliant
00:52 - that's all JavaScript so we're going to
00:53 - get into kind of the basics of
00:55 - JavaScript and the good news is is
00:57 - Javascript is a programming language so
00:59 - once you learn it you've actually
01:01 - learned some computer programming so
01:03 - before we add it to our actual web page
01:06 - let's kind of start off with some
01:08 - programming Basics on JavaScript what I
01:10 - want you to do is get Google Chrome
01:13 - download it install it if you're going
01:14 - to be a web developer it's a really good
01:16 - browser to use and go view developer
01:19 - JavaScript console the shortcut key for
01:22 - this on Mac is command option J or on
01:25 - Windows it's control shift J and that's
01:28 - going to bring up your console here
01:30 - and what the console does is it allows
01:32 - me to code directly into my web page now
01:35 - none of this gets saved onto my web page
01:37 - it's just kind of happening real time
01:39 - and it's the best way to learn and to
01:41 - play around with code so you can see I
01:44 - can type one here it says one I can type
01:46 - 1 plus two there you go I kind of got a
01:48 - calculator going on 3 +
01:51 - 354 357 so the first thing that we need
01:55 - to learn with programming is you need to
01:57 - learn what a variable is now it's a big
01:59 - word but variable basically means we're
02:01 - creating a container that's going to
02:03 - store a value for later on so remember
02:07 - in algebra when you'd say like xal 1 so
02:10 - what's x + 1 well that's two well if xal
02:14 - 2 what's x + 1 well that's three
02:17 - basically a variable is that we're
02:18 - giving a a a number a name and how you
02:22 - do that in JavaScript is you use the
02:24 - letters v r for variable so I could say
02:27 - ver x equals 1 it's now every time I
02:30 - Type X it's going to say well that's one
02:33 - so x + 2 well that equals 3 cuz that's
02:36 - as far as JavaScript is concerned
02:37 - there's no difference between saying x +
02:40 - 2 and saying 1 + 2 cuz we said x equal 1
02:45 - so I could go ver x = 1 ver Y = 2 and I
02:51 - could say x + y and that equals three so
02:55 - now it probably feels like you're in
02:56 - your math class and for those of you
02:58 - guys who hated math you're like no oh
03:00 - this is going to be terrible I promise
03:02 - this is not about math so maybe a better
03:05 - example is let's say their name equals
03:09 - will and you can use single or double
03:11 - quotes for this but if you're going to
03:12 - use letters you have to use quotes like
03:15 - I said you can use double quotes if you
03:17 - want so now whenever I say name it's
03:19 - going to spit out will so now I can do
03:23 - alert and then I can open up and I can
03:27 - say name and I can close out my
03:30 - parenthesis and I hit enter and it's
03:32 - going to say
03:33 - will so I could also say
03:36 - alert and I could just do some quotes
03:39 - right now hi
03:42 - Will and then hit enter so it says Hi
03:45 - Will alerts kind of a cool function that
03:47 - does this little alert window this will
03:49 - work in pretty much any browser so
03:53 - that's kind of what a variable is now
03:55 - there's some types of variables types
03:58 - that's a very important word to remember
04:00 - JavaScript has about seven types to it
04:03 - um and most most every computer language
04:07 - has a lot of the same types at the very
04:09 - beginning you'll notice that you
04:10 - remember I did a number ver xals 3
04:14 - that's a number type so I can do math
04:16 - with that I can do x + 3 and it's going
04:20 - to know that this is the actual number
04:23 - three now if I do that with quotes
04:26 - equals
04:28 - 30 and that does not know that it's the
04:31 - number 30 anymore I actually whenever
04:33 - you use quotes it becomes a string type
04:36 - and string means that all these
04:38 - different digits are strung together so
04:41 - it just knows that this is the number
04:43 - three followed by the number zero it
04:45 - doesn't know that it's the number 30 so
04:48 - if I say x + 10 well now it's just 3 0 1
04:52 - 0 JavaScript is smart enough to not give
04:55 - you an error it's just going to say ah
04:58 - you just added a number in in a string
05:00 - let's just lump it together into one big
05:02 - string so if I say ver y equal 30
05:05 - without quotes now Y is the number 30 so
05:09 - y + 10 is going to be 40 so that's your
05:12 - string type and that's your number type
05:15 - I'm going to teach you one more command
05:17 - and you're free to create a basic
05:19 - program for yourself that command is
05:22 - prompt I do prompt I open and close my
05:26 - parentheses and hit enter and that's
05:27 - going to open up this window here so now
05:30 - I can say Will and it's going to return
05:33 - will so I could go that really didn't do
05:36 - anything yet so I'll have to go ver name
05:38 - equals
05:41 - prompt and then I can go will and so now
05:46 - if I ever say name name is stored as
05:49 - will so I could go ver name equals
05:53 - prompt and now if I hit a semicolon I
05:57 - can add a second command alert
06:01 - name so there we go I'm going to go will
06:04 - it's going to say okay and then it
06:06 - alerted will awesome so let me go one
06:09 - more thing let's make this a little bit
06:12 - more ver name equals prompt ver last
06:16 - name equals
06:19 - prompt alert
06:22 - name
06:24 - plus let me do a comma plus last
06:28 - name there we go so let's go will
06:32 - Stern and then it's going to say will
06:34 - comma Stern all right probably would
06:36 - have made more sense to do a space uh
06:38 - except for that prompt isn't helping me
06:40 - out because it's not telling me what to
06:41 - do it just gives me this little thing so
06:43 - you can actually enter a prompt message
06:45 - in here what's your first
06:51 - name there we go and now it asks me what
06:54 - is your first name I'm going to say my
06:56 - first name is Will so let's fix this
07:00 - little program I've written here their
07:03 - name equals what what is your first name
07:08 - and I'm getting quite a long line here
07:09 - but that's okay what is your last name
07:13 - and you see it looped around here and
07:16 - then I'm actually going to turn that
07:18 - into a space so it looped around but
07:21 - what is your first name
07:23 - Will what is your last
07:26 - name wil Stern so there there you go and
07:30 - now you can write your first basic
07:32 - JavaScript computer program uh and if
07:35 - you were to do some homework before
07:36 - going on to the next lesson I'd say
07:38 - create a prompt and alert-based
07:41 - program that asks for some user
07:43 - information and then spits out a
07:46 - combination of that information just
07:48 - like I did here I alerted a name plus a
07:51 - last name or maybe make an addition
07:53 - program where you say you know give me
07:56 - one number give me another number and
07:59 - say
07:59 - the sum of those two numbers is blah
08:02 - blah blah that's your first homework
08:03 - assignment and let's get into the next
08:07 - lesson

string let's just lump it together into one big string so if I say ver y equal 30 without quotes now Y is the number 30 so y + 10 is going to be 40 so that's your string type and that's your number
