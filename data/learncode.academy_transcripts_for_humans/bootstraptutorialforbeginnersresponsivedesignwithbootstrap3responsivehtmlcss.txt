00:01 - hey there we're going to be using
00:02 - bootstrap CSS today to make a responsive
00:05 - layout if you don't know what a
00:07 - responsive layout is you're about to
00:09 - find out um and if you're brand new to
00:11 - HTML CSS this is video number four and
00:13 - I'll put a link to video number one over
00:16 - here where you can check those out and
00:18 - get a little familiar with HTML CSS
00:20 - first uh but let's move right into it uh
00:23 - what you're going to need to do to start
00:24 - with bootstrap is you're going to need
00:26 - to go to get
00:28 - bootstrap.css it's been kind of having
00:31 - some server lag today so I've had to
00:32 - refresh a lot of times bootstrap is
00:35 - getting all popular on us okay um you'll
00:37 - scroll down and you'll see bootstrap CDN
00:39 - if you just want to use the files from
00:41 - CDN which is a great way to do it copy
00:44 - these two links and then add them right
00:47 - here into your
00:50 - header there you go so now they're both
00:52 - in there now bootstrap CSS is on my page
00:54 - I'm also going to take the
00:56 - script and I'm going to add it at the
00:59 - very bottom of my body tag um and what
01:02 - that's going to do is you always want to
01:04 - put scripts at the bottom uh otherwise
01:06 - your page is going to wait for all the
01:08 - scripts to load before it shows your
01:10 - user the page and you want that to be as
01:12 - fast as possible we are keeping the
01:14 - stylesheets up top because as soon as
01:17 - the page shows up we want it to have
01:18 - style we don't want it to show up ugly
01:20 - and then catch style later on so that's
01:23 - why style goes up top so as things
01:25 - appear they have the correct style and
01:27 - then the function goes down here because
01:29 - we can show them a page and not have all
01:31 - the function uh move yet it'll load up a
01:34 - split second later but it feels a lot
01:36 - faster kind of the explanation on why
01:38 - we're putting it there so now that
01:41 - bootstrap CSS is on here let me show you
01:43 - I actually loaded the Styles bootstrap
01:46 - CSS it is going to create tons and tons
01:49 - of CSS rules that help you do a lot of
01:53 - great stuff for you um and I'm not going
01:55 - to get into all of what's going on there
01:58 - today uh but what I'm just going to show
02:00 - you kind of how we start using it so
02:01 - let's start by doing a three column
02:03 - layout what we're going to do is
02:06 - div with a class of row and then I'm
02:09 - going to go div
02:12 - column small
02:17 - six kind of what we got here so you see
02:19 - it doesn't look like too much let me I
02:20 - did make a couple helper classes here in
02:22 - my main CSS dark BG darker BG darkest BG
02:27 - so I'll give you dark
02:28 - BG
02:31 - okay it made something that spans
02:33 - halfway across the screen uh what
02:35 - bootstrap gives you is a 12 column
02:38 - responsive layout which means it goes 12
02:41 - columns across and since I made it be uh
02:43 - six columns across then no matter what
02:45 - size my window gets here I'm always
02:47 - going to see six columns across until I
02:50 - get lower than small which is as soon as
02:53 - I get extra small and then it's going to
02:55 - fill the whole screen this is called a
02:57 - responsive layout which means it acts
03:00 - according to the size of the user's
03:01 - browser and device let's go ahead and
03:03 - add another one you'll see more what
03:05 - we're talking
03:07 - about let's make this one darker
03:13 - BG so now we have two columns here and
03:16 - you'll see that these are going to do
03:17 - good and as soon as my screen size gets
03:18 - small boom like an iPhone or something
03:21 - they bump down to the next size let's go
03:23 - ahead and add another
03:25 - column let's go darkest
03:28 - BG um um and now it's going to start
03:31 - looping around because we have more than
03:33 - 12 columns we have
03:35 - 666 uh column of the Beast so I'm going
03:38 - to give each of these a four the reason
03:40 - they went with 12 is you can do groups
03:42 - of three if you divide it by four uh if
03:45 - you can do groups of four if you all
03:46 - give them a width of three you have a
03:48 - lot of options a lot of divisibility
03:50 - with a number 12 so that's why they went
03:52 - with that so now I have a three column
03:55 - layout and they each have the full
03:57 - background on it there we go uh what you
04:00 - can also do is you have widths of small
04:04 - extra small medium large extra large and
04:07 - those are all based off your screen
04:09 - widths so say I want this one to always
04:12 - when we B when we merge down say I want
04:15 - these two to still be half width so what
04:17 - I can do here is start adding some extra
04:20 - small rules so small let's make U6 u3 U
04:25 - and
04:28 - three and we go extra small I want you
04:31 - to be full which is
04:35 - 12 and then extra small you're going to
04:38 - be six and you're going to be
04:41 - six these helper classes they build for
04:44 - you are awesome so now we have
04:46 - 633 and when you bounce down now this
04:49 - guy goes all the way across and these
04:51 - guys both span it's really good you
04:53 - notice there's some problems going on
04:54 - here it's because I did not wrap this in
04:56 - a container tag forgot to do that
05:01 - that kind of gives you a little bit of a
05:04 - kind of sets your deal to your layout
05:06 - container there we go that fixes that
05:09 - always want it to be in a container tag
05:11 - what a container does is it kind of
05:13 - gives you your your centered look and
05:16 - feel so then I bounce down to responsive
05:18 - layout and that's excellent that's kind
05:19 - of how you do column layouts now let's
05:21 - do a navbar easiest way to do this is go
05:24 - to components on bootstrap you're going
05:26 - to be going to get
05:28 - bootstrap.css because you're just going
05:30 - to be doing a lot of copy paste I'm
05:32 - going to go to navbar and there's an
05:34 - example of a Navar I'm just going to
05:35 - copy the whole dang
05:38 - thing there's no way you're going to
05:40 - remember all this anytime quickly so you
05:43 - just go with it I'm going to create let
05:46 - me see what does this start with it
05:47 - starts with a nav tag so I'm going to
05:48 - create a header tag
05:51 - here and I'm going to paste that big
05:53 - mess in there and I don't know why my
05:55 - Sublime always pastes
05:58 - messy so there we go navbar navbar
06:02 - default these are all styling
06:04 - classes um what I'm actually going to do
06:07 - is I'm going to make the header we'll
06:09 - see what happens here there we go
06:11 - there's my Navar it looks beautiful I'm
06:14 - going to wrap all this in a container
06:15 - tag
06:20 - again make sure keep the indentations
06:23 - clean don't want nasty HTML
06:27 - people and so now my container is
06:30 - actually going to have the navbar
06:34 - class keeping it full width uh you know
06:38 - I actually don't like my decision to do
06:39 - that let's keep
06:41 - it sometimes with bootstrap you have a
06:43 - lot of trial and error because you do
06:44 - have not memorized what all these things
06:46 - do no I'm taking it back I am going to
06:50 - do it change plan again like I just said
06:53 - little trial and error these are the
06:56 - things you put together once a site so
06:57 - it's usually like four months in between
07:00 - implementation that's a class
07:03 - container oh that's my problem I don't
07:06 - want that to have I want the container
07:07 - to be inside ha there we
07:10 - go container to be here you're going to
07:14 - have class
07:16 - navbar which is kind of what makes it do
07:18 - that full width page thing the class of
07:20 - navbar gives it that full width thing
07:23 - and now I have bad
07:27 - HTML Okay so for those of you guys who
07:30 - just got confused by what I did we have
07:32 - our header with class A navbar and then
07:35 - inside we have a container which gives
07:37 - us that centered look and then it goes
07:39 - navbar default class which we can
07:41 - actually take
07:43 - out and there we go what I'm actually
07:45 - going to do is give this container
07:50 - class Navar inverse there we go actually
07:53 - I don't want it there one on the
07:57 - header there we go
07:59 - got it so your
08:03 - navbar SL
08:06 - defaults gives you that grayish I don't
08:08 - know if you can see but it's a little
08:09 - bit gray I like navbar inverse because
08:12 - it gives me a black look and then I put
08:14 - the container which is going to keep all
08:16 - my stuff kind of in this centered look
08:19 - here so my container is inside of my
08:22 - navbar class and then I have my
08:24 - navigation inside and I'll give this
08:27 - a roll Banner just since that's
08:31 - technically correct HTML
08:33 - markup there we go now I got all my
08:35 - stuff now I'm going to delete some
08:36 - things I don't want I don't care about
08:37 - this link Dro down here just going to
08:39 - get rid of
08:42 - you and I'm not using search so you're
08:45 - gone it's a lot easier to copy and
08:48 - delete later there we go now I've kind
08:50 - of got my header and now I've got my
08:52 - three colum layout and now I can add
08:54 - links and you'll see this drop
08:56 - down is not working so we'll have to
09:00 - work on
09:02 - that and there's kind of how we pull in
09:04 - a lot of our bootstrap stuff and you'll
09:08 - as you as you'll go you'll find out
09:09 - there's a lot of times the bootstrap
09:11 - documentation might not give you the
09:12 - most clear example on what to do things
09:15 - might not work exactly as you hope the
09:17 - first time around um you just got to
09:19 - keep moving let me show you some more
09:20 - bootstrap stuff that you can do you can
09:21 - go components see it keeps keep having
09:25 - to refresh bootstrap it is not doing so
09:27 - good today bootstrap will give you
09:29 - button groups like that with that
09:32 - code it'll give you button toolbars you
09:35 - can do all sorts of great stuff under
09:37 - the CSS tab you get your more basic
09:39 - stuff like buttons there we go you can
09:41 - see it's either a button um or an a tag
09:45 - with the class of BTN let's add some
09:48 - buttons
09:58 - here a class button button I don't have
10:00 - a hre there so it's
10:03 - not doing
10:08 - it there we go you got to make sure you
10:10 - give it a color so this is button
10:12 - defaults you can go button
10:15 - primary which is kind of like hey this
10:17 - is primary out of all of
10:20 - them you can go
10:23 - secondary actually I don't think
10:25 - secondary is anything you can go danger
10:28 - which is error you can go
10:32 - warn
10:34 - warning you can go success which is
10:38 - green and so that's kind of how you get
10:40 - your
10:41 - buttons uh they have a panel which is a
10:44 - very useful thing let me go back to
10:46 - components reload
10:50 - again panels panels are super
10:55 - awesome let me go here copy the panel
10:59 - so instead of giving this row you'll
11:02 - notice I mean this is pretty ugly I've
11:05 - just used the column or the classes to
11:07 - depict what's going on with the grid I'm
11:10 - going to remove these dark BG darker BG
11:13 - darkest BG because clearly those don't
11:15 - look very
11:18 - pretty and we're going to copy and paste
11:20 - in our panel these are a lot more often
11:23 - the kind of components you would use for
11:26 - a um an actual web page
11:31 - page widget one there we go that's
11:35 - looking much
11:37 - nicer I'm going to copy and paste that
11:39 - into my next
11:45 - one and you see they automatically
11:47 - resize to what you've chosen which is
11:51 - excellent and then they automatically
11:53 - Bounce Down When you minifi to a smaller
11:55 - one another great thing about this is
11:56 - look what happened to my menu is it
11:58 - automatically shrunk down which is great
12:01 - my menu automatically gives me a menu
12:07 - button and so let's go ahead and add
12:10 - some buttons in here
12:19 - now do something there we go and they
12:22 - even do the Nifty little looks another
12:24 - thing you can do on panel is you see
12:26 - panel default type here we can change
12:27 - these to panel primary
12:31 - we can change them to panel success all
12:34 - the same
12:35 - things apply to these
12:39 - panel
12:42 - danger you can also do the same thing to
12:45 - text um this class is panel body I can
12:48 - go text
12:50 - danger there you go now it has red text
12:52 - and I can make this text
12:56 - success I can also
13:00 - instead of that I can wrap something in
13:02 - a span and give it a class of text
13:08 - success and has the exact same effect so
13:11 - I can go black
13:14 - text and then success text that's kind
13:18 - of your basic introduction to bootstrap
13:20 - there's way too much to it to cover in
13:21 - one video so I'm going to leave it there
13:24 - uh just enough to to give you a dive in
13:28 - um I cop and pasted a few components
13:30 - I've been doing some responsive layout
13:32 - you can see obviously I clearly have
13:34 - some stuff to add in here some
13:36 - adjustments to make things aren't
13:37 - working flawlessly there's still some
13:40 - things to be figured out and desired uh
13:42 - but that's pretty much your intro to
13:43 - using bootstrap to create a great
13:45 - responsive
13:47 - layout

Cleaned transcript:

hey there we're going to be using bootstrap CSS today to make a responsive layout if you don't know what a responsive layout is you're about to find out um and if you're brand new to HTML CSS this is video number four and I'll put a link to video number one over here where you can check those out and get a little familiar with HTML CSS first uh but let's move right into it uh what you're going to need to do to start with bootstrap is you're going to need to go to get bootstrap.css it's been kind of having some server lag today so I've had to refresh a lot of times bootstrap is getting all popular on us okay um you'll scroll down and you'll see bootstrap CDN if you just want to use the files from CDN which is a great way to do it copy these two links and then add them right here into your header there you go so now they're both in there now bootstrap CSS is on my page I'm also going to take the script and I'm going to add it at the very bottom of my body tag um and what that's going to do is you always want to put scripts at the bottom uh otherwise your page is going to wait for all the scripts to load before it shows your user the page and you want that to be as fast as possible we are keeping the stylesheets up top because as soon as the page shows up we want it to have style we don't want it to show up ugly and then catch style later on so that's why style goes up top so as things appear they have the correct style and then the function goes down here because we can show them a page and not have all the function uh move yet it'll load up a split second later but it feels a lot faster kind of the explanation on why we're putting it there so now that bootstrap CSS is on here let me show you I actually loaded the Styles bootstrap CSS it is going to create tons and tons of CSS rules that help you do a lot of great stuff for you um and I'm not going to get into all of what's going on there today uh but what I'm just going to show you kind of how we start using it so let's start by doing a three column layout what we're going to do is div with a class of row and then I'm going to go div column small six kind of what we got here so you see it doesn't look like too much let me I did make a couple helper classes here in my main CSS dark BG darker BG darkest BG so I'll give you dark BG okay it made something that spans halfway across the screen uh what bootstrap gives you is a 12 column responsive layout which means it goes 12 columns across and since I made it be uh six columns across then no matter what size my window gets here I'm always going to see six columns across until I get lower than small which is as soon as I get extra small and then it's going to fill the whole screen this is called a responsive layout which means it acts according to the size of the user's browser and device let's go ahead and add another one you'll see more what we're talking about let's make this one darker BG so now we have two columns here and you'll see that these are going to do good and as soon as my screen size gets small boom like an iPhone or something they bump down to the next size let's go ahead and add another column let's go darkest BG um um and now it's going to start looping around because we have more than 12 columns we have 666 uh column of the Beast so I'm going to give each of these a four the reason they went with 12 is you can do groups of three if you divide it by four uh if you can do groups of four if you all give them a width of three you have a lot of options a lot of divisibility with a number 12 so that's why they went with that so now I have a three column layout and they each have the full background on it there we go uh what you can also do is you have widths of small extra small medium large extra large and those are all based off your screen widths so say I want this one to always when we B when we merge down say I want these two to still be half width so what I can do here is start adding some extra small rules so small let's make U6 u3 U and three and we go extra small I want you to be full which is 12 and then extra small you're going to be six and you're going to be six these helper classes they build for you are awesome so now we have 633 and when you bounce down now this guy goes all the way across and these guys both span it's really good you notice there's some problems going on here it's because I did not wrap this in a container tag forgot to do that that kind of gives you a little bit of a kind of sets your deal to your layout container there we go that fixes that always want it to be in a container tag what a container does is it kind of gives you your your centered look and feel so then I bounce down to responsive layout and that's excellent that's kind of how you do column layouts now let's do a navbar easiest way to do this is go to components on bootstrap you're going to be going to get bootstrap.css because you're just going to be doing a lot of copy paste I'm going to go to navbar and there's an example of a Navar I'm just going to copy the whole dang thing there's no way you're going to remember all this anytime quickly so you just go with it I'm going to create let me see what does this start with it starts with a nav tag so I'm going to create a header tag here and I'm going to paste that big mess in there and I don't know why my Sublime always pastes messy so there we go navbar navbar default these are all styling classes um what I'm actually going to do is I'm going to make the header we'll see what happens here there we go there's my Navar it looks beautiful I'm going to wrap all this in a container tag again make sure keep the indentations clean don't want nasty HTML people and so now my container is actually going to have the navbar class keeping it full width uh you know I actually don't like my decision to do that let's keep it sometimes with bootstrap you have a lot of trial and error because you do have not memorized what all these things do no I'm taking it back I am going to do it change plan again like I just said little trial and error these are the things you put together once a site so it's usually like four months in between implementation that's a class container oh that's my problem I don't want that to have I want the container to be inside ha there we go container to be here you're going to have class navbar which is kind of what makes it do that full width page thing the class of navbar gives it that full width thing and now I have bad HTML Okay so for those of you guys who just got confused by what I did we have our header with class A navbar and then inside we have a container which gives us that centered look and then it goes navbar default class which we can actually take out and there we go what I'm actually going to do is give this container class Navar inverse there we go actually I don't want it there one on the header there we go got it so your navbar SL defaults gives you that grayish I don't know if you can see but it's a little bit gray I like navbar inverse because it gives me a black look and then I put the container which is going to keep all my stuff kind of in this centered look here so my container is inside of my navbar class and then I have my navigation inside and I'll give this a roll Banner just since that's technically correct HTML markup there we go now I got all my stuff now I'm going to delete some things I don't want I don't care about this link Dro down here just going to get rid of you and I'm not using search so you're gone it's a lot easier to copy and delete later there we go now I've kind of got my header and now I've got my three colum layout and now I can add links and you'll see this drop down is not working so we'll have to work on that and there's kind of how we pull in a lot of our bootstrap stuff and you'll as you as you'll go you'll find out there's a lot of times the bootstrap documentation might not give you the most clear example on what to do things might not work exactly as you hope the first time around um you just got to keep moving let me show you some more bootstrap stuff that you can do you can go components see it keeps keep having to refresh bootstrap it is not doing so good today bootstrap will give you button groups like that with that code it'll give you button toolbars you can do all sorts of great stuff under the CSS tab you get your more basic stuff like buttons there we go you can see it's either a button um or an a tag with the class of BTN let's add some buttons here a class button button I don't have a hre there so it's not doing it there we go you got to make sure you give it a color so this is button defaults you can go button primary which is kind of like hey this is primary out of all of them you can go secondary actually I don't think secondary is anything you can go danger which is error you can go warn warning you can go success which is green and so that's kind of how you get your buttons uh they have a panel which is a very useful thing let me go back to components reload again panels panels are super awesome let me go here copy the panel so instead of giving this row you'll notice I mean this is pretty ugly I've just used the column or the classes to depict what's going on with the grid I'm going to remove these dark BG darker BG darkest BG because clearly those don't look very pretty and we're going to copy and paste in our panel these are a lot more often the kind of components you would use for a um an actual web page page widget one there we go that's looking much nicer I'm going to copy and paste that into my next one and you see they automatically resize to what you've chosen which is excellent and then they automatically Bounce Down When you minifi to a smaller one another great thing about this is look what happened to my menu is it automatically shrunk down which is great my menu automatically gives me a menu button and so let's go ahead and add some buttons in here now do something there we go and they even do the Nifty little looks another thing you can do on panel is you see panel default type here we can change these to panel primary we can change them to panel success all the same things apply to these panel danger you can also do the same thing to text um this class is panel body I can go text

I can go black text and then success text that's kind of your basic introduction to bootstrap there's way too much to it to cover in one video so I'm going to leave it there uh just enough to to give
