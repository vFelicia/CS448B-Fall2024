With timestamps:

00:01 - so if you are using FTP to as a way of
00:04 - getting your files into production for a
00:06 - website uh say you cyberduck or
00:08 - something you drag your files in there's
00:10 - a much better way I know I recently did
00:13 - a video where I showed you how to sign
00:15 - up for hosting from host skater and I
00:17 - showed you how to use FTP to get the
00:18 - files over but that's really an
00:20 - entrylevel way of getting in if you
00:22 - learn just a couple more things you can
00:24 - do this in a much more stable Much More
00:26 - Much More trustworthy and an easier much
00:29 - faster way uh there's absolutely no
00:31 - reason this should take this long uh
00:33 - just to put a few files online when you
00:35 - make changes so we're going to stop this
00:37 - and close this yes please stop get out
00:40 - of here uh let's go do this in a much
00:42 - better way uh so what you're going to
00:44 - need I have a gist here that I will put
00:46 - the link to online and we're just going
00:48 - to step right through it so you can see
00:49 - how easy this is couple prerequisites
00:52 - let's make sure you install node.js from
00:54 - nodejs.org now let's make sure you have
00:56 - git on your machine uh or GitHub as it's
00:59 - often called and uh make sure you get
01:01 - that on your computer and then let's
01:04 - move forward so you're going to open up
01:05 - your terminal and you're going to run
01:07 - this command npm install dasg the- G is
01:10 - important the first time Flight Plan
01:13 - the- g means we're going to install it
01:14 - globally which means we're actually
01:16 - going to have access to the fly command
01:19 - now I can say fly there's no target
01:21 - specified but fly is on my machine and
01:24 - then you're going to get into your
01:25 - folder that your project is in which is
01:27 - Wills awesom site.com for me and then
01:30 - I'm just going to run no I'm not going
01:31 - to run Will's awesome site I'm going to
01:33 - run npm install Flight
01:36 - Plan without the G and that's going to
01:39 - actually install it into my project so
01:42 - now you can see if I go to my project I
01:44 - have node modules and flight plan is in
01:46 - there so that's great next up if your
01:51 - project is not currently a git
01:53 - repository you don't really have to know
01:55 - what that means but you're going to need
01:56 - to run these three commands in your
01:58 - project and and that's get in it let me
02:01 - uh clean this up here for you get in it
02:04 - there you go now I'm my project is a get
02:07 - repository get add- a capital A and get
02:12 - commit DM and then in quotes you're
02:14 - going to do a commit message first
02:17 - commit there you go now all my files are
02:20 - in a GitHub repository the only
02:22 - prerequisite to using flight plan is you
02:25 - have to keep your files in a GitHub
02:27 - repository so now we're going to create
02:29 - our flight plan .js file let me copy
02:32 - this new file paste it in save it as
02:36 - flight plan.
02:39 - JS there we go now I have flight plan.
02:42 - JS the only thing you're going to want
02:43 - to change is your host to be your
02:45 - website and your username to be whatever
02:48 - your HostGator or whatever login is now
02:51 - one of the reasons I recommend HostGator
02:53 - they allow you to ssh in that's
02:56 - something your host has to allow you to
02:57 - do in order to do this kind of
02:59 - deployment
03:00 - um they Rec this is for host skater
03:02 - right here when host skater allows you
03:04 - to ssh in you have to do it to Port
03:06 - 2222 lots of web hosts don't allow you
03:09 - to ssh in at all some require you to use
03:12 - a different port so that's something
03:13 - you're going to need to know if you're
03:14 - not using HostGator and that's it I've
03:16 - called this target production which
03:19 - means if I hit fly production it's going
03:21 - to copy all my files to production okay
03:24 - so that's it I've saved it and let's
03:26 - test it out let's just go fly production
03:30 - copying them all it's going to ask for
03:31 - my
03:35 - password and there you go it did it
03:37 - you're like no way there's no way it was
03:39 - that easy oh really well let's check it
03:41 - out let's go to
03:42 - index.html and instead of learn code
03:44 - being really rocks it's really rocks fly
03:50 - production ask for my
03:53 - password there you go and let's refresh
03:55 - our
03:56 - website learn code Rel rocks no way way
04:00 - why was that so fast because this uses
04:03 - rsync and rsync only pushes the files
04:06 - that changed uh which is really nice
04:09 - refresh there you go learn code now it
04:11 - just really rocks so there you are
04:14 - that's how to do great deployments using
04:15 - flight plan for any kind of websites and
04:18 - if that if you want to make it if that
04:20 - password gets really annoying for you I
04:22 - have an SSH video that will show you how
04:24 - to set up passwordless SSH so you don't
04:27 - need to type that every time so your
04:29 - computer is authorized to do that to the
04:31 - server without a password hope you
04:33 - enjoyed this video have a great day
