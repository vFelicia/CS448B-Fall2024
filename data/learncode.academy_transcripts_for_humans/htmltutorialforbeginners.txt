00:00 - in this video we are going to learn html
00:02 - for new developers now if you missed my
00:04 - last video which is how to set up visual
00:06 - studio code um in a professional coding
00:09 - environment and workspace you definitely
00:11 - want to watch that that link is in the
00:13 - description go ahead watch that and come
00:14 - back to here in this video we're going
00:16 - to learn html which is the content for
00:19 - the web i'm going to go ahead and close
00:20 - this real quick i can click on this
00:22 - folder thing and get rid of all those
00:24 - files so i have a little more screen to
00:26 - work with
00:27 - but if you think about a website it's
00:29 - got content and it's got look and feel
00:31 - to it so the content would be the words
00:33 - on the page any images on the page any
00:35 - buttons on the page
00:37 - and that those words images and buttons
00:39 - could look a thousand different ways
00:40 - with a thousand different colors so html
00:42 - is what puts the content on the page um
00:45 - and it's ugly you can tell that this is
00:46 - ugly i don't even have a font that's
00:48 - being chosen for me uh let alone a font
00:51 - size and a font color or a background
00:53 - color that's because i'm just using html
00:55 - right now i'm just adding content to my
00:57 - page after that we'll get into css which
01:00 - is cascading style sheets css would say
01:04 - give me a gray background with blue text
01:06 - and a button with rounded rectangle
01:08 - corners on it and let's make this image
01:10 - small and i don't know let's make it
01:12 - shake when you hover over it things like
01:14 - that that's css and so when people learn
01:16 - html and css together they can build a
01:19 - full website
01:21 - and then javascript is what a developer
01:23 - will learn to add functionality to that
01:25 - website where you can maybe post a tweet
01:27 - to twitter and things like that that's
01:29 - all functionality that's javascript so
01:32 - those three technologies make a web
01:34 - developer's tool kit now what we're
01:36 - going to do in this video is we're going
01:37 - to learn html
01:39 - and html is the easiest piece of all
01:41 - three you can really learn it in a day
01:44 - or even an hour because all you have to
01:46 - do is memorize a few words let me show
01:48 - you what i mean here i'm going to take
01:50 - away all this code
01:52 - and i'm going to leave that top one
01:53 - there because that's the one that says
01:55 - hey it's an html web page
01:57 - everything in html is considered a tag a
02:00 - tag looks like this a greater than
02:02 - symbol the tag name we'll call this html
02:06 - and then any attributes i'll get to
02:08 - attributes in a second and then the less
02:11 - than symbol you can see when i type that
02:12 - less than symbol vs code visual studio
02:15 - code automatically added what's called a
02:17 - closing tag for me which is the same
02:19 - thing but it has a slash anything
02:21 - between the opening tag and the closing
02:24 - tag is considered inside of a tag so if
02:27 - i type type type type this is now inside
02:30 - of my html tag and that's how that works
02:32 - you can have tags inside of tags i could
02:35 - have a body inside of the
02:36 - html tag
02:38 - and then i could have other tags inside
02:40 - of that you can have as many tags inside
02:42 - of as many tags as you want it's all
02:44 - just tags tags can be two things they
02:47 - can have an opening closing
02:49 - or if there's nothing inside of them
02:50 - they can be what's called self-closing
02:52 - which you add a slash to the end of it
02:55 - and a good example of this would be an
02:57 - image an image
03:00 - is the img tag
03:02 - and image doesn't have text inside of it
03:04 - or any of that it loads an image
03:06 - from a web server and spits it out on
03:08 - the page so we don't have to have an
03:11 - opening and closing tag it can be self
03:12 - closing
03:14 - and then we define things how does that
03:16 - image know which image we're pulling
03:18 - from the internet we're going to use
03:19 - what's called attributes for that so a
03:22 - tag can have one or more attributes to
03:24 - do an attribute you do a space
03:26 - after the tag name and you give it an
03:28 - attribute let's say it has a width
03:30 - width equals 300. and so you do equals
03:35 - and then an opening closing of
03:37 - quotes and then whatever's inside of
03:39 - that is considered the attribute so
03:41 - think of it as a person right the tag
03:42 - name is image let's say this was called
03:44 - frank
03:45 - and frank has a height well he could
03:47 - have a width too
03:48 - there's attributes about frank right as
03:50 - a person he's got a certain height and
03:53 - he's got a certain intelligence
03:56 - these are things that are
03:58 - qualities about frank intelligence high
04:01 - and so that's kind of how tags and
04:03 - attributes work the tag is what the
04:05 - thing is
04:06 - the attributes describe
04:08 - things about that tag so in this case we
04:11 - have in the case of image we have an
04:13 - image
04:15 - and you might have a height a width and
04:18 - a source which is where that image comes
04:20 - from that is all of html we just covered
04:23 - all of html right here tags with tag
04:26 - names and attributes that's it from here
04:29 - on out you just have to memorize a few
04:31 - tag names
04:32 - and a few attributes and you have all of
04:34 - html done so let's get into some of
04:36 - these common tag names there's really
04:38 - three categories that give you
04:40 - everything you need to start off to
04:42 - build an html web page you have to have
04:44 - three tags to start off you have to have
04:46 - an html tag again i'm just typing html
04:49 - and hitting tab here and visual studio
04:51 - code is doing the rest so really all you
04:53 - do have to do is memorize some words so
04:56 - i'm doing an html tag inside of that i'm
04:59 - going to do a head tag
05:01 - and then i'm also going to do a body tag
05:04 - those are the three tags that it takes
05:05 - to build a web page you notice that head
05:08 - and body are both inside of html that's
05:11 - extremely important
05:13 - now html doesn't care about white space
05:16 - at all so these could be like this
05:18 - these could be like that it doesn't
05:19 - really matter none of that matters it
05:21 - only matters to you the developer we
05:23 - like to keep them
05:24 - indented in such a way where it's easy
05:26 - to see what's inside of what so that's
05:29 - what the indentions are all about i
05:30 - indent using tab so you can go tab and
05:33 - then you can also select one or more
05:35 - things and do shift tab or tab and
05:38 - things will move around indention wise
05:40 - so that's what those indentions are all
05:42 - about
05:43 - in our head tag we'll add one title tag
05:46 - here and let's say my page
05:49 - and let's add an exclamation mark
05:51 - because we're feeling chirpy today so
05:52 - there we go you can see up here at the
05:54 - top if you can see it because it's
05:55 - really little it says my page
05:57 - exclamation mark in the body let's add
05:59 - our hello world back
06:02 - and then that is our web page so we've
06:05 - got our body our body is everything that
06:07 - the user sees in this main body of the
06:09 - web page so all of the rest of our tags
06:11 - are going to go in here
06:12 - and so that is your basic three tags for
06:15 - a web page html head body and a title
06:19 - tag which you don't have to do but
06:20 - pretty much everybody wants to do it
06:22 - because you want your tab to have a
06:23 - title so now let's look into how you
06:25 - style text text comes with
06:28 - h1 tag being your biggest piece of text
06:31 - which is a header
06:34 - there you go wow that's really big i'm
06:35 - kind of zoomed in here to make it easier
06:37 - but wow that h1 is big and you can go
06:39 - all the way down to h6
06:41 - my subtitle
06:44 - so you notice that h2 is by default a
06:46 - little smaller the default css for h1 is
06:49 - going to make it huge and h2 is going to
06:51 - be smaller and smaller still all the way
06:53 - down to h6 i'll do an h6 here which is
06:56 - even smaller
06:58 - so the h6 is even smaller than and what
07:01 - these are used for is these are used for
07:03 - telling google
07:05 - if you want it to rank your page to rank
07:06 - on google and all of the web browsers
07:08 - and everything what the most important
07:10 - pieces of your page are so google is
07:12 - going to look at your page and it's
07:13 - going to say oh the h1 that's the title
07:14 - for the whole page h2 these are section
07:17 - subtitles so any
07:19 - content blocks within your page will be
07:21 - h2s and farther down if if an h2 has
07:24 - multiple content blocks in that those
07:26 - will all be h3s that's what we use those
07:28 - tags for css could make this one huge
07:31 - and make this one tiny so it doesn't
07:33 - necessarily relate to size it more
07:35 - relates to importance so those are our
07:38 - h1 h2 those are our header tags
07:41 - and then there's a p tag which is for a
07:43 - paragraph hi i'm
07:45 - a paragraph of text
07:50 - so there's my paragraph of text and if i
07:52 - do multiple ones of these
07:54 - then you'll notice that each one kind of
07:55 - has a space in between it just like you
07:57 - would expect a paragraph to do default
07:59 - css is going to add a space below each
08:01 - paragraph
08:03 - and so that's how paragraphs work now
08:05 - you'll remember i mentioned that html
08:07 - does not care about white space so if i
08:08 - do a ton of spaces here it doesn't
08:11 - change when i save it nothing is
08:12 - different what if i add a million
08:14 - returns here well accidentally got a
08:15 - slash so we'll get rid of that slash if
08:17 - i had a million returns nothing changes
08:20 - html does not care about spaces past one
08:23 - the first space works because you know
08:25 - you really couldn't type anything
08:26 - without a space
08:27 - but that's kind of how html works it
08:30 - doesn't care about white space white
08:31 - space is what you use as the developer
08:33 - to make it easy to read all the content
08:36 - well what if i wanted to add a line
08:37 - break like that well there's an actual
08:39 - tag for a line break called br and it's
08:42 - a self-closing tag because it doesn't
08:44 - have any content in it and you can see
08:46 - there we go we have an actual line break
08:48 - a return an enter key got added into
08:50 - that so that's a tag you want to know as
08:52 - well br for line break
08:54 - and then what if you want to change some
08:56 - of the ways these work
08:57 - you can add strong to make it bold
09:02 - let's make it a strong paragraph added a
09:04 - space there probably don't need a space
09:06 - there strong is basically what you use
09:08 - for bold if you're looking at really old
09:10 - web pages you may see a b tag floating
09:13 - around which does the same thing but
09:14 - that's that shouldn't be used anymore
09:16 - strong is what you should use for bold
09:18 - now
09:19 - and then em is what you use for emphasis
09:22 - which is italics you can see there we go
09:24 - italics so those are the tags that we
09:26 - use for bold and italics strong and em
09:29 - and we're actually getting a lot of the
09:31 - way through this list so if you feel
09:32 - overwhelmed just remember we only have
09:34 - about 12 words we have to memorize html
09:37 - head title body
09:39 - p
09:40 - strong em
09:42 - and then we also covered our header tags
09:44 - and you're almost through basic html
09:47 - with just those words uh here's a fun
09:50 - one there's buttons i'm a button
09:55 - there we go we have a button looks like
09:57 - i got a typo in there somewhere yep got
09:59 - an extra little piece
10:01 - and you can click it
10:03 - we have a button there no style to it
10:05 - but there's a button on the page and the
10:06 - button also doesn't do anything because
10:08 - we don't have any javascript or anything
10:10 - telling the button what to do but hey
10:12 - the button is there all the same so
10:14 - that's all of our text tags i'm going to
10:16 - show you two more tags and then we're
10:18 - done with basic html we can actually
10:20 - start learning basic css from here on
10:23 - out so let's go and add a list tag these
10:26 - are actually really important so if i go
10:29 - li
10:29 - and say i'm an item
10:32 - you can see i kind of have a bulleted
10:34 - list right there yep i have a bulleted
10:36 - list
10:37 - and if i have multiple items i could
10:38 - either lay them out like that or i
10:41 - should if i have multiple items wrap
10:43 - them in a ul which is unordered list and
10:46 - now i have to select this and cut it and
10:48 - paste it because i did it in a weird
10:49 - order and you learned to get really good
10:51 - at those kind of things as a web
10:53 - developer so i have a ul tag
10:55 - with multiple li tags in it this is an
10:58 - unordered list and list items so that's
11:01 - what those stand for these would be
11:03 - things like a navigation a top
11:05 - navigation on your page you will define
11:07 - a list of things and then use css to lay
11:09 - them out as a navigation
11:11 - you can also change this to o l
11:15 - o l
11:16 - and you'll make it an ordered list which
11:18 - is not very useful you don't do this as
11:21 - often in html but you can see as soon as
11:23 - i changed it to ol i got number one
11:25 - number two added to my lis but usually
11:28 - li and ul is the combination you'll go
11:31 - for that creates a list of items and
11:33 - then you can use css to style that in a
11:35 - way you need to so there you go that's
11:37 - it that's all you need to know for html
11:40 - it's tags with attributes with tag names
11:44 - that's html in a nutshell let's start
11:46 - building an actual web page with style
11:49 - and look and feel in the next video
11:50 - we're going to get into css
11:57 - you

Cleaned transcript:

in this video we are going to learn html for new developers now if you missed my last video which is how to set up visual studio code um in a professional coding environment and workspace you definitely want to watch that that link is in the description go ahead watch that and come back to here in this video we're going to learn html which is the content for the web i'm going to go ahead and close this real quick i can click on this folder thing and get rid of all those files so i have a little more screen to work with but if you think about a website it's got content and it's got look and feel to it so the content would be the words on the page any images on the page any buttons on the page and that those words images and buttons could look a thousand different ways with a thousand different colors so html is what puts the content on the page um and it's ugly you can tell that this is ugly i don't even have a font that's being chosen for me uh let alone a font size and a font color or a background color that's because i'm just using html right now i'm just adding content to my page after that we'll get into css which is cascading style sheets css would say give me a gray background with blue text and a button with rounded rectangle corners on it and let's make this image small and i don't know let's make it shake when you hover over it things like that that's css and so when people learn html and css together they can build a full website and then javascript is what a developer will learn to add functionality to that website where you can maybe post a tweet to twitter and things like that that's all functionality that's javascript so those three technologies make a web developer's tool kit now what we're going to do in this video is we're going to learn html and html is the easiest piece of all three you can really learn it in a day or even an hour because all you have to do is memorize a few words let me show you what i mean here i'm going to take away all this code and i'm going to leave that top one there because that's the one that says hey it's an html web page everything in html is considered a tag a tag looks like this a greater than symbol the tag name we'll call this html and then any attributes i'll get to attributes in a second and then the less than symbol you can see when i type that less than symbol vs code visual studio code automatically added what's called a closing tag for me which is the same thing but it has a slash anything between the opening tag and the closing tag is considered inside of a tag so if i type type type type this is now inside of my html tag and that's how that works you can have tags inside of tags i could have a body inside of the html tag and then i could have other tags inside of that you can have as many tags inside of as many tags as you want it's all just tags tags can be two things they can have an opening closing or if there's nothing inside of them they can be what's called selfclosing which you add a slash to the end of it and a good example of this would be an image an image is the img tag and image doesn't have text inside of it or any of that it loads an image from a web server and spits it out on the page so we don't have to have an opening and closing tag it can be self closing and then we define things how does that image know which image we're pulling from the internet we're going to use what's called attributes for that so a tag can have one or more attributes to do an attribute you do a space after the tag name and you give it an attribute let's say it has a width width equals 300. and so you do equals and then an opening closing of quotes and then whatever's inside of that is considered the attribute so think of it as a person right the tag name is image let's say this was called frank and frank has a height well he could have a width too there's attributes about frank right as a person he's got a certain height and he's got a certain intelligence these are things that are qualities about frank intelligence high and so that's kind of how tags and attributes work the tag is what the thing is the attributes describe things about that tag so in this case we have in the case of image we have an image and you might have a height a width and a source which is where that image comes from that is all of html we just covered all of html right here tags with tag names and attributes that's it from here on out you just have to memorize a few tag names and a few attributes and you have all of html done so let's get into some of these common tag names there's really three categories that give you everything you need to start off to build an html web page you have to have three tags to start off you have to have an html tag again i'm just typing html and hitting tab here and visual studio code is doing the rest so really all you do have to do is memorize some words so i'm doing an html tag inside of that i'm going to do a head tag and then i'm also going to do a body tag those are the three tags that it takes to build a web page you notice that head and body are both inside of html that's extremely important now html doesn't care about white space at all so these could be like this these could be like that it doesn't really matter none of that matters it only matters to you the developer we like to keep them indented in such a way where it's easy to see what's inside of what so that's what the indentions are all about i indent using tab so you can go tab and then you can also select one or more things and do shift tab or tab and things will move around indention wise so that's what those indentions are all about in our head tag we'll add one title tag here and let's say my page and let's add an exclamation mark because we're feeling chirpy today so there we go you can see up here at the top if you can see it because it's really little it says my page exclamation mark in the body let's add our hello world back and then that is our web page so we've got our body our body is everything that the user sees in this main body of the web page so all of the rest of our tags are going to go in here and so that is your basic three tags for a web page html head body and a title tag which you don't have to do but pretty much everybody wants to do it because you want your tab to have a title so now let's look into how you style text text comes with h1 tag being your biggest piece of text which is a header there you go wow that's really big i'm kind of zoomed in here to make it easier but wow that h1 is big and you can go all the way down to h6 my subtitle so you notice that h2 is by default a little smaller the default css for h1 is going to make it huge and h2 is going to be smaller and smaller still all the way down to h6 i'll do an h6 here which is even smaller so the h6 is even smaller than and what these are used for is these are used for telling google if you want it to rank your page to rank on google and all of the web browsers and everything what the most important pieces of your page are so google is going to look at your page and it's going to say oh the h1 that's the title for the whole page h2 these are section subtitles so any content blocks within your page will be h2s and farther down if if an h2 has multiple content blocks in that those will all be h3s that's what we use those tags for css could make this one huge and make this one tiny so it doesn't necessarily relate to size it more relates to importance so those are our h1 h2 those are our header tags and then there's a p tag which is for a paragraph hi i'm a paragraph of text so there's my paragraph of text and if i do multiple ones of these then you'll notice that each one kind of has a space in between it just like you would expect a paragraph to do default css is going to add a space below each paragraph and so that's how paragraphs work now you'll remember i mentioned that html does not care about white space so if i do a ton of spaces here it doesn't change when i save it nothing is different what if i add a million returns here well accidentally got a slash so we'll get rid of that slash if i had a million returns nothing changes html does not care about spaces past one the first space works because you know you really couldn't type anything without a space but that's kind of how html works it doesn't care about white space white space is what you use as the developer to make it easy to read all the content well what if i wanted to add a line break like that well there's an actual tag for a line break called br and it's a selfclosing tag because it doesn't have any content in it and you can see there we go we have an actual line break a return an enter key got added into that so that's a tag you want to know as well br for line break and then what if you want to change some of the ways these work you can add strong to make it bold let's make it a strong paragraph added a space there probably don't need a space there strong is basically what you use for bold if you're looking at really old web pages you may see a b tag floating around which does the same thing but that's that shouldn't be used anymore strong is what you should use for bold now and then em is what you use for emphasis which is italics you can see there we go italics so those are the tags that we use for bold and italics strong and em and we're actually getting a lot of the way through this list so if you feel overwhelmed just remember we only have about 12 words we have to memorize html head title body p strong em and then we also covered our header tags and you're almost through basic html with just those words uh here's a fun one there's buttons i'm a button there we go we have a button looks like i got a typo in there somewhere yep got an extra little piece and you can click it we have a button there no style to it but there's a button on the page and the button also doesn't do anything because we don't have any javascript or anything telling the button what to do but hey the button is there all the same so that's all of our text tags i'm going to show you two more tags and then we're done with basic html we can actually start learning basic css from here on out so let's go and add a list tag these are actually really important so if i go li and say i'm an item you can see i kind of have a bulleted list right there yep i have a bulleted list and if i have multiple items i could either lay them out like that or i should if i have multiple

web developer so i have a ul tag with multiple li tags in it this is an unordered list and list items so that's what those stand for these would be things like a navigation a top navigation on your page you will define a list of things and then use css to lay them out as a navigation you can also change this to o l o l and you'll make it an ordered list which is not very useful you don't do this as often in html but you can see as soon as i changed it to ol i got number one number two added to my lis but usually li and ul is the combination you'll go for that creates a list of items and then
