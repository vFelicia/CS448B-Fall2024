00:00 - hey guys in this video we are going to
00:01 - be covering everything it takes in
00:03 - checklist form to learn web development
00:05 - from the very beginning to the point
00:07 - that you can get a job and consider
00:09 - yourself a professional web developer
00:11 - now in the past i've done this in mind
00:13 - map style and i've included every
00:15 - possible thing you could learn and all
00:17 - the options that are out there and the
00:19 - nice things to know but it was pretty
00:20 - confusing for new developers it was very
00:22 - useful for experienced and professional
00:24 - developers but it kind of confused and
00:26 - overwhelmed new developers so in this
00:28 - video i'm going to cover checklist form
00:30 - just what it takes to learn web
00:32 - development what course you should take
00:35 - what path you should take and what
00:36 - technologies you should learn in order
00:38 - to become a hireable professional web
00:41 - developer and we're going to give you
00:43 - about as much time as it takes now i'm
00:45 - going to point out this link here at the
00:46 - bottom this is the link to what i'm
00:48 - using in a more print friendly form and
00:50 - i'm also going to add many many more
00:51 - links to that as i start building out
00:53 - videos against these to-do's because i'm
00:56 - going to start building out a lot of
00:57 - videos afresh for 2022 with all the
01:01 - checklist items you see here so let's
01:03 - get into it you are starting web
01:05 - development you want to become a
01:06 - professional software engineer make the
01:09 - big bucks what do i have to learn to not
01:12 - have people laugh at me in a job
01:13 - interview in the near future so you
01:15 - basically have three phases you're going
01:18 - to go through you're going to go through
01:19 - the 101 front end fundamentals you're
01:21 - going to go 102 which is where you
01:23 - become an intermediate front end
01:24 - engineer or developer and then you're
01:26 - going to learn advanced front end and at
01:28 - that point you're pretty confident hey
01:30 - companies are looking for the skill set
01:32 - that you have so let's get into 101 what
01:35 - are the things you need to learn 101 web
01:37 - development is basically three skills
01:40 - you're going to learn basic html basic
01:42 - css and your javascript fundamentals but
01:45 - i've broken them down to give you a
01:46 - little more detail about what you should
01:48 - google and what you should actually
01:49 - learn if you're learning these things of
01:51 - course you're going to want to install a
01:52 - code editor first you should use visual
01:54 - studio code that's from microsoft visual
01:57 - studio code it is super great super
01:59 - popular tons of professionals use it and
02:02 - of course it's free which is very nice
02:04 - everything we will do on here is free
02:06 - with the exception of where you host a
02:08 - web page when you're ready to actually
02:11 - publish it so basic html is something
02:13 - you want to learn it's really really
02:16 - simple you basically just learn tags and
02:18 - you learn about 20 tags then you're
02:21 - basically confident with basic html you
02:23 - can build an ugly page think craigslist
02:26 - craigslist is what you get when you code
02:28 - with html and use almost no css the
02:31 - biggest hang up you're going to have
02:32 - here is html folder structure how do you
02:35 - actually save your files in folders and
02:38 - then how do you add links to link to
02:40 - those specific files in the right
02:42 - folders this is where everybody seems to
02:44 - mess it up everybody seems to have a
02:45 - hard time getting this piece right of
02:48 - adding links and making sure those links
02:49 - go to the actual file or the actual web
02:52 - page you want them to go to so that's
02:54 - going to be the trickiest thing when
02:55 - you're starting off and then once you
02:57 - kind of have your basic tags down and a
03:00 - little bit html you're going to want to
03:01 - move right into basic css when you're
03:04 - barely confident with html learn html
03:07 - and css together you're going to learn
03:09 - how to add css to your page using style
03:12 - tags and link tags and inline style
03:15 - attributes and then you're going to
03:16 - learn how to create css rules what is
03:19 - the css selector how does the css
03:21 - selector work and how can you change
03:23 - some basic properties how can you change
03:25 - your font to red and your background
03:27 - page to blue which would be a super ugly
03:29 - page by the way and then you want to get
03:31 - really good and here's where a lot of
03:32 - people mess it up too the next thing you
03:34 - want to do is get really really good at
03:36 - drawing boxes on the screen with flexbox
03:40 - mostly and grid later on but first just
03:43 - flexbox can you draw a layout with
03:47 - flexbox any layout right a sidebar with
03:49 - a top header
03:51 - or can you do like a top header and then
03:53 - three boxes in a row side by side and
03:55 - then six boxes side by side if you learn
03:58 - how to draw boxes really really well
04:01 - you can become really good at building
04:03 - web pages quickly and easily because the
04:06 - most confusing part for people starting
04:07 - off is how do i draw the boxes that hold
04:10 - all the little pictures and text and
04:12 - things if you can draw the boxes well
04:14 - then the things that go in the boxes are
04:16 - usually pretty easy because if you think
04:18 - about any design any design is just
04:20 - boxes with stuff in them right the
04:22 - header of a web page is just kind of a
04:25 - box at the top and then inside of that
04:27 - there's a logo and a navigation and then
04:29 - the footer of a web page it's just a box
04:31 - with links in it right so if you can
04:33 - learn how to draw boxes really really
04:35 - well then you're set up to do really
04:37 - well with css
04:39 - basically you just want to learn how to
04:40 - draw boxes and then how to do the little
04:43 - tricks of the things that you put in
04:44 - there like how do i show a profile image
04:46 - but make it a circle not a square when
04:49 - the image i'm using is a square and how
04:51 - do i make sure make the button like fade
04:53 - to blue when i hover over it right these
04:55 - are just little tricks none of them are
04:57 - hard but you have to basically google
04:59 - and find the trick that you want to do
05:01 - next up you have like about a quarter of
05:04 - a day thing on learning what is a css
05:06 - reset and how do i use it that's really
05:08 - really easy checkbox to check off but an
05:10 - important one and then last you
05:12 - basically just want to get to the point
05:14 - where you can build an entire website
05:17 - look from just a design or a mock-up and
05:20 - it's it's very intimidating at first
05:22 - because you barely know how to put a
05:24 - button on the page but eventually you
05:25 - learn okay a button is easy okay a blue
05:27 - button is easy okay a blue button that
05:29 - fades to red that has rounded corners
05:31 - and a shadow that's also pretty easy
05:34 - it's just these little tiny details that
05:35 - you learn and learn learn and that's
05:36 - what you're going to be spending two to
05:38 - six weeks doing how do i draw boxes and
05:40 - how do i do all the little tricks of
05:42 - making things look certain ways so
05:45 - that's html and basic css at this point
05:48 - you are going to move into javascript
05:50 - fundamentals now javascript is a
05:52 - programming language and this is the
05:54 - programming language that you use on the
05:56 - web so you're going to learn programming
05:59 - basics you're going to learn how to
06:01 - select these are by the way all these
06:02 - things i'm typing are things that are
06:04 - really good google searches
06:06 - querying dom elements working with dom
06:09 - elements in javascript right i'm trying
06:11 - to give you the actual official names
06:13 - even though it sounds confusing now
06:15 - javascript event listeners these are all
06:18 - the search phrases that you're going to
06:19 - search for when you're learning this
06:21 - stuff you're basically going to say how
06:23 - do i take code
06:24 - and interact with the web page right
06:26 - like so how do i say when the user
06:28 - clicks on this button i want to go out
06:31 - to twitter and fetch their latest tweets
06:33 - and show them right there in the webpage
06:35 - or when they hover over this button how
06:37 - do i show other content on the page that
06:39 - didn't exist before they hovered on the
06:41 - button this is what you use javascript
06:43 - for you use javascript for programming
06:46 - making actions and things on the page
06:49 - and that's basically when you're going
06:50 - to learn javascript because it's
06:52 - programming if you're new to programming
06:54 - concepts like variables functions and
06:57 - flow control like if those words sound
06:59 - intimidating to you they're not really
07:00 - scary concepts but if they sound
07:02 - intimidating that's what you're going to
07:03 - be learning you're going to be learning
07:05 - programming basics and that's why i put
07:07 - two to six weeks here if you already
07:08 - kind of know programming with python or
07:10 - something you're going to be closer to
07:12 - that two weeks mark but if you if
07:14 - programming is new to you you're going
07:15 - to want to give yourself
07:16 - several weeks of buffer to
07:19 - look at what a variable is or a function
07:20 - and feel intimidated by the fact that
07:22 - that didn't make sense and then learn it
07:24 - again and oh okay after three or four
07:26 - days of learning functions over and over
07:28 - again that makes perfect sense i get it
07:31 - now so that's where that buffer time is
07:33 - going to come in and then lastly there's
07:34 - a little bit of head knowledge that you
07:36 - want to learn so i put about a day here
07:39 - what is dns like you want to know what
07:41 - dns is how you register for a domain
07:44 - name you want to learn what a web server
07:46 - or web host does for you and when you
07:49 - point your domain name to a web host
07:51 - what's actually happening you don't
07:53 - really have to know this stuff but you
07:55 - got to learn it at some point this is a
07:56 - pretty good time to learn it like when i
07:59 - type somewebsite.com
08:01 - how do i get a webpage back what
08:03 - actually happens like you're going to
08:04 - spend years really understanding this
08:06 - stuff but at this point it's good to
08:08 - have a basic idea of
08:10 - what happens when i type in the name for
08:12 - a website and then as a web developer
08:14 - what part of that do i control uh kind
08:17 - of a hint here you're going to register
08:18 - for a domain name you're going to point
08:21 - that domain to a web host and that web
08:24 - host has all your html css and
08:26 - javascript files on it so that web host
08:29 - when you say mywebsite.com it's going to
08:32 - give you back your main html page to all
08:34 - your users so that's basically what
08:36 - you're going to be learning here and at
08:38 - this point how do you publish your
08:39 - website because you're going to want to
08:40 - publish your websites there's some
08:41 - things you'll do a little later as you
08:43 - learn more technologies but for now the
08:45 - easiest thing is you're going to go with
08:46 - an html web host hostgator has long been
08:50 - the easiest one of the cheapest ways to
08:52 - set this up when you know what you know
08:54 - at the 101 level it's also pretty
08:56 - inexpensive it's like three to five
08:58 - dollars a month depending on how many
09:00 - months you pay for up front i have a
09:02 - video on how to do it start to finish we
09:04 - have a website up in like eight or ten
09:06 - minutes it's very very simple and
09:07 - there's also a few coupon codes that you
09:10 - can use that may or may not save you
09:11 - some money
09:13 - i have an affiliate thing with hostgator
09:15 - which i reached out to because i have
09:17 - always recommended them to people so
09:19 - feel free to use those or not use those
09:21 - this is 101 should take you between one
09:25 - and three or so months to learn this and
09:28 - once you get here you're ready to move
09:30 - on to the intermediate level give
09:32 - yourself a pat on the back let's move on
09:35 - moving over to web dev 102 we're going
09:37 - to confront maybe what for many people
09:40 - is their biggest intimidation and that's
09:42 - using the terminal that's right you're
09:45 - going to stop being afraid of it now for
09:46 - lots of people they see that plain white
09:48 - or plain black screen and just kind of
09:50 - freak out what is this how do i do it
09:52 - yeah it's just it's not that bad guys
09:54 - it's only scary if you've never used it
09:57 - it's pretty simple so you're just going
09:59 - to learn how to navigate around your
10:01 - computer right just like you would on
10:02 - your computer you'll click into folders
10:04 - find the file you want you're going to
10:06 - do that in the terminal you've got to
10:08 - use it at some point or people are just
10:10 - going to laugh at you on the interviews
10:12 - why not start learning it now so you're
10:14 - pretty comfortable with it when you go
10:16 - interviewing for jobs so you're going to
10:18 - learn the basic terminal you're going to
10:20 - learn how to get around and use it and
10:22 - then you're going to learn how to
10:23 - install node.js packages now node.js
10:26 - means two things it means one
10:28 - little things that help you out in your
10:30 - front end development that you're going
10:31 - to install on your machine and then
10:33 - node.js also means a back-end
10:35 - programming language that you use to
10:37 - make web servers with you are not going
10:39 - to do that ladder part you're going to
10:40 - do the first part you're going to use
10:43 - node.js to install things that help you
10:45 - code better so we're going to learn how
10:47 - to install npm packages which is like
10:50 - one command
10:52 - it's not hard to do and then we're going
10:53 - to learn how to use other people's code
10:55 - which is called a package to help us
10:58 - code less and accomplish more that's the
11:00 - whole point of it right packages
11:02 - somebody wrote this cool thing that they
11:03 - find very useful and they put it up on
11:05 - the internet for any coder to use they
11:07 - call it a no js package an npm package
11:10 - so you're going to learn how to install
11:12 - npm packages to accomplish cool things
11:14 - on your own machine very easily then
11:16 - you're going to learn about version
11:18 - control this is the other big new
11:20 - concept that's going to happen in this
11:23 - section now i only put one to two weeks
11:25 - because it doesn't take very long to
11:26 - learn version control but basically
11:28 - version control is how we handle a bunch
11:32 - of people on a team coding on the same
11:34 - project
11:35 - if you imagine three people coding on
11:38 - the same file how does that work do you
11:41 - say hey other guys don't touch this file
11:44 - i'm working on it today and when i hit
11:45 - save then i'll call you back on the
11:47 - phone and you can start working on it
11:49 - that's a terrible terrible workflow as
11:51 - you can imagine that does not scale well
11:53 - to big teams and big companies so what
11:56 - we have to do is we actually have to use
11:58 - version control version control is going
12:00 - to track what everybody does and it's
12:02 - going to automatically merge all the
12:04 - changes together ah it's going to be so
12:07 - much nicer so you'll see when you learn
12:09 - how to use git
12:10 - for version control why people do it and
12:13 - why every serious professional company
12:15 - uses it
12:16 - super super cool a little bit of a
12:18 - learning curve give yourself a little
12:19 - bit of time don't rush it don't try to
12:21 - learn getting day even though you can
12:23 - learn the basics of git in an hour or
12:24 - two don't rush it you know get really
12:27 - comfortable with it give yourself a
12:28 - little bit of time at this point you are
12:30 - going to want to move on to intermediate
12:32 - css intermediate css is where you learn
12:34 - how to do things like hey i want one web
12:37 - page but i want it to look different on
12:39 - mobile than on desktop that's called
12:41 - media queries and responsive layouts
12:43 - these allow you to have the same content
12:45 - display a little bit differently on
12:47 - different machines same thing with
12:48 - responsive images if you're on a huge
12:51 - desktop machine maybe you want to
12:52 - display this massive background image
12:55 - and if you're on a mobile maybe you just
12:56 - want to download a little bitty image to
12:58 - use less bandwidth and make the page
12:59 - load faster so these are two responsive
13:02 - features that you're going to learn
13:04 - and then you're going to use a npm
13:06 - package called sas to compile sas code
13:10 - into css what that means is you're going
13:12 - to write a language that's better than
13:14 - css
13:15 - and then you're going to turn that
13:16 - language that code you write in sas into
13:19 - css code which will work on all the web
13:22 - pages browsers don't read sas code they
13:24 - read css code but it's easier to write
13:27 - sas code and then turn it into css code
13:30 - using a npm package called sas
13:33 - if that confuses you well it's not so
13:35 - bad and then you're going to learn how
13:36 - to break your css code into different
13:39 - files
13:40 - a 3 000 line css code is terrible to
13:43 - work with it's so much easier to work
13:45 - with 10 or 15 files that are much
13:48 - smaller in terms of code so you're going
13:50 - to learn how to break this up and also
13:52 - use sas to compile all those files down
13:55 - into one file now it's going to start
13:57 - feeling like you're a professional with
13:58 - your css handling and then lastly you
14:01 - want to learn css frameworks like
14:03 - tailwind css or bootstrap these are kind
14:06 - of some things that many many companies
14:08 - will use to manage their css and they
14:10 - make life a lot more enjoyable in many
14:12 - many circumstances then you're going to
14:14 - move on to an intermediate javascript
14:16 - here's where you learn how to actually
14:17 - become a more serious programmer you're
14:19 - going to learn a checklist of things
14:21 - that i won't go through because it'll
14:23 - probably just confuse you but you're
14:25 - going to basically learn all these
14:26 - different things in javascript
14:29 - some people that are more creative and
14:31 - not as technical you're going to lean
14:33 - more towards the six week mark of this
14:35 - if you're highly technical and you love
14:37 - complex topics then it'll be a lot
14:39 - easier for you either way the complexity
14:41 - is not terrible it really isn't terrible
14:43 - but
14:44 - depending on how you're wired if you're
14:46 - drawn more towards the design aspect of
14:49 - web development this will take you
14:50 - probably a little longer and if you're
14:52 - highly highly technical mathematical
14:55 - detailed you might just latch onto this
14:57 - and catch it a little bit faster so give
14:59 - yourself some time there depending on
15:00 - how you're wired and then lastly you're
15:02 - going to come over here to code quality
15:04 - basics these are some npm packages that
15:06 - we run against our code to help us out
15:09 - this right here will catch javascript
15:11 - errors before we ever run it in the
15:13 - browser that's what eslint does prettier
15:15 - can format our code whenever you hit
15:17 - save and it can make sure that
15:18 - everybody's code on a whole team looks
15:21 - exactly the same and is formatted and
15:23 - spaced exactly the same eslint and
15:26 - prettier are super awesome typescript
15:28 - allows you to add some extra features to
15:30 - javascript that do not exist in
15:33 - javascript all three of these are pretty
15:34 - stinking popular and it'd be really good
15:36 - to at least know what they are
15:38 - familiarize yourself with what they are
15:41 - and you're also going to want to learn
15:42 - here basic testing for your code testing
15:46 - is how you actually write programming to
15:49 - prove that your programming did what it
15:51 - should do
15:52 - let's say you had a math program that
15:54 - took a and b
15:56 - and returned a plus b well then you
15:58 - could write a test and said hey if a is
16:00 - one and b is two then you should return
16:03 - three that way if you accidentally ever
16:05 - make a change to your code and break
16:06 - what it should do your test will say hey
16:09 - a plus b doesn't equal 3 anymore what
16:11 - did you do wrong in your code so that's
16:13 - basically what tests are as you're
16:15 - writing your code you're writing tests
16:17 - against your code to make sure that it
16:19 - does well as you make changes over time
16:23 - it still does what you intended it to do
16:25 - at this point you also have a lot more
16:27 - options because you know git and github
16:29 - on how you can deploy your code to
16:31 - websites you can use github pages
16:33 - netlify or versel vercell is my favorite
16:36 - although it's not necessarily the
16:38 - cheapest depending on how you do it
16:40 - but there are some great ways if you
16:42 - know how to push your code to github to
16:44 - deploy your website and really enjoy
16:46 - your life now you're done with 102
16:49 - lots of people or maybe not lots of
16:51 - people used to be you could get a job at
16:53 - this point it's getting a little
16:55 - trickier to get a job at this point um
16:57 - so it's probably worth mentioning that
16:59 - you want to go to 103 before seriously
17:02 - pursuing a career however if you're in a
17:04 - large city like new york atlanta la
17:08 - there's there's a decent
17:10 - uh chance that you could get a job with
17:12 - the 102 skill set it just will be a
17:15 - little harder to find you're gonna have
17:16 - to find a company that has specific
17:18 - niches
17:19 - for 102 level developers uh 102 by the
17:23 - way is totally something i've made up
17:26 - this is basically a benchmark you're
17:28 - looking for for a complete skill set on
17:30 - how to build flat web pages very very
17:34 - well
17:35 - 101 is how you build flat pages fairly
17:38 - well the advanced css and javascript you
17:41 - get in the 102 level allow you to build
17:43 - them very well especially node packages
17:46 - git all these things really give you a
17:48 - complete skill set around building flat
17:50 - web pages so the 103 skill set is all
17:53 - about building web apps you're going to
17:56 - learn how to use static site generators
17:58 - to build a huge application that is all
18:02 - flat content and you're also going to
18:05 - learn how to use single page
18:07 - applications or build web applications
18:10 - uh if you think about it every social
18:12 - media website you use is not a flat web
18:16 - page right it's not the same every time
18:18 - you visit it like maybe a company's
18:20 - business card style website would be
18:22 - a web application is going to be
18:24 - different every time you visit it
18:25 - because it's going to pull in
18:26 - information from a database on the
18:27 - internet it's going to show that to you
18:30 - uh like if you're thinking about using
18:32 - twitter as people are using it you're
18:34 - getting notifications you're seeing the
18:36 - likes go up you're seeing new content
18:38 - appear on the page as people post this
18:40 - is a web application and you're going to
18:42 - learn how to build this now you're going
18:44 - to learn how to use it with just
18:46 - javascript to make a really really basic
18:49 - web application and you're going to
18:51 - learn how routing works and how to use
18:54 - urls to store the where you were what
18:56 - page you were at
18:57 - and that as soon as you learn this
18:59 - you're going to realize this would be
19:01 - really frustrating to do without a
19:03 - package that helps me do a lot more and
19:06 - that's why you're going to learn react
19:08 - react is going to help you build web
19:11 - apps with javascript it's going to give
19:13 - you a whole lot of structure and a whole
19:15 - lot of tools that allow you to do those
19:17 - crazy things i talked about without a
19:19 - whole lot of difficulty it would just be
19:22 - very complex to do them by yourself
19:24 - without a framework that's what react is
19:27 - called it's a framework it's a set of
19:29 - structure and rules that if you use that
19:31 - structure and use those tools and rules
19:33 - you can get a whole lot done very
19:35 - quickly so you're going to learn how to
19:37 - do a basic react application
19:40 - where you can fetch data from the
19:42 - internet and then post it in your page
19:44 - and maybe send data back off to the
19:45 - internet when the user does certain
19:47 - things like write posts or write to-do's
19:49 - in a to-do list
19:50 - then you're gonna learn how to use css
19:52 - in react applications it's still css
19:55 - it's still sas it's everything you've
19:57 - been doing but you're gonna use it just
19:59 - a little bit differently inside of react
20:02 - it doesn't take
20:03 - too long you'll notice i put one to two
20:05 - weeks here as the timeline but it is
20:07 - something that you want to give yourself
20:08 - a little bit of time aside to learn
20:11 - because there's some methodology that
20:12 - goes into it and there are several
20:13 - options you can use
20:15 - next up you're going to learn some
20:17 - frameworks for react i thought you said
20:20 - react was a framework yes react is a
20:21 - framework for how you do things in
20:23 - javascript but then there are also
20:25 - bigger things that help you organize
20:27 - your react code and that sounds complex
20:30 - but it's really not too bad these things
20:32 - just make your life easier is what it is
20:35 - if you're doing basic react these two
20:37 - things will make your life better
20:38 - next.js is the one i would go for
20:40 - although react router is very popular
20:43 - and useful as well if you're short on
20:46 - time just learn react
20:47 - learn next.js and move on with your life
20:50 - and then you're also going to learn
20:52 - advanced state management if you don't
20:54 - know react right now then that word
20:56 - doesn't make any sense
20:58 - but basically you're just going to learn
20:59 - how to control the data of your
21:01 - application in an easy to reproduce in a
21:04 - reliable way modbx is what i would use
21:07 - for that it's very very simple very
21:09 - straightforward you're going to like
21:11 - your life a lot with mobex redux is the
21:14 - most popular tool for doing this these
21:16 - days but i don't really recommend it i
21:18 - think it actually has a lot of
21:19 - weaknesses that frustrate people who use
21:21 - it
21:22 - but that being said if you're looking
21:24 - for a job it'd be a good idea to at
21:26 - least familiarize yourself with how
21:28 - redux works because more than likely a
21:31 - company is going to use or have some
21:33 - redex codes still in their code base so
21:36 - you're going to learn advanced state
21:37 - management
21:39 - and that's pretty much it
21:40 - at this point
21:42 - you're ready to go look for a job you
21:43 - have a rock solid skill set that lots of
21:46 - people are looking for hiring
21:48 - and you can do a lot of things and
21:52 - provide a lot of value to your company
21:54 - same thing here how to publish websites
21:56 - at this point doesn't really change
21:57 - except for vercell is awesome for
21:59 - deploying next js applications
22:02 - absolutely love it it's
22:04 - it's the company that is the people that
22:05 - make next js so it just works very very
22:08 - well if you stuck with me through this
22:10 - point you're dedicated you're in you're
22:13 - gonna love it and you should probably
22:14 - subscribe and thumbs up if you have not
22:16 - subscribed to me yet because i'm gonna
22:17 - be adding a lot of these videos in uh
22:20 - probably even at some point building
22:21 - full courses that teach all of this
22:23 - stuff for not too much money because a
22:25 - boot camp would cost you about 18 000 to
22:28 - learn all this stuff
22:30 - and i think people should be able to
22:31 - learn it for a lot less if they are
22:33 - driven and motivated people so hope you
22:36 - enjoy this video hope it helps you out
22:38 - in your web dev learning journey good
22:40 - luck to you go learn go build great
22:42 - stuff and have a good day

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys in this video we are going to be covering everything it takes in checklist form to learn web development from the very beginning to the point that you can get a job and consider yourself a professional web developer now in the past i've done this in mind map style and i've included every possible thing you could learn and all the options that are out there and the nice things to know but it was pretty confusing for new developers it was very useful for experienced and professional developers but it kind of confused and overwhelmed new developers so in this video i'm going to cover checklist form just what it takes to learn web development what course you should take what path you should take and what technologies you should learn in order to become a hireable professional web developer and we're going to give you about as much time as it takes now i'm going to point out this link here at the bottom this is the link to what i'm using in a more print friendly form and i'm also going to add many many more links to that as i start building out videos against these todo's because i'm going to start building out a lot of videos afresh for 2022 with all the checklist items you see here so let's get into it you are starting web development you want to become a professional software engineer make the big bucks what do i have to learn to not have people laugh at me in a job interview in the near future so you basically have three phases you're going to go through you're going to go through the 101 front end fundamentals you're going to go 102 which is where you become an intermediate front end engineer or developer and then you're going to learn advanced front end and at that point you're pretty confident hey companies are looking for the skill set that you have so let's get into 101 what are the things you need to learn 101 web development is basically three skills you're going to learn basic html basic css and your javascript fundamentals but i've broken them down to give you a little more detail about what you should google and what you should actually learn if you're learning these things of course you're going to want to install a code editor first you should use visual studio code that's from microsoft visual studio code it is super great super popular tons of professionals use it and of course it's free which is very nice everything we will do on here is free with the exception of where you host a web page when you're ready to actually publish it so basic html is something you want to learn it's really really simple you basically just learn tags and you learn about 20 tags then you're basically confident with basic html you can build an ugly page think craigslist craigslist is what you get when you code with html and use almost no css the biggest hang up you're going to have here is html folder structure how do you actually save your files in folders and then how do you add links to link to those specific files in the right folders this is where everybody seems to mess it up everybody seems to have a hard time getting this piece right of adding links and making sure those links go to the actual file or the actual web page you want them to go to so that's going to be the trickiest thing when you're starting off and then once you kind of have your basic tags down and a little bit html you're going to want to move right into basic css when you're barely confident with html learn html and css together you're going to learn how to add css to your page using style tags and link tags and inline style attributes and then you're going to learn how to create css rules what is the css selector how does the css selector work and how can you change some basic properties how can you change your font to red and your background page to blue which would be a super ugly page by the way and then you want to get really good and here's where a lot of people mess it up too the next thing you want to do is get really really good at drawing boxes on the screen with flexbox mostly and grid later on but first just flexbox can you draw a layout with flexbox any layout right a sidebar with a top header or can you do like a top header and then three boxes in a row side by side and then six boxes side by side if you learn how to draw boxes really really well you can become really good at building web pages quickly and easily because the most confusing part for people starting off is how do i draw the boxes that hold all the little pictures and text and things if you can draw the boxes well then the things that go in the boxes are usually pretty easy because if you think about any design any design is just boxes with stuff in them right the header of a web page is just kind of a box at the top and then inside of that there's a logo and a navigation and then the footer of a web page it's just a box with links in it right so if you can learn how to draw boxes really really well then you're set up to do really well with css basically you just want to learn how to draw boxes and then how to do the little tricks of the things that you put in there like how do i show a profile image but make it a circle not a square when the image i'm using is a square and how do i make sure make the button like fade to blue when i hover over it right these are just little tricks none of them are hard but you have to basically google and find the trick that you want to do next up you have like about a quarter of a day thing on learning what is a css reset and how do i use it that's really really easy checkbox to check off but an important one and then last you basically just want to get to the point where you can build an entire website look from just a design or a mockup and it's it's very intimidating at first because you barely know how to put a button on the page but eventually you learn okay a button is easy okay a blue button is easy okay a blue button that fades to red that has rounded corners and a shadow that's also pretty easy it's just these little tiny details that you learn and learn learn and that's what you're going to be spending two to six weeks doing how do i draw boxes and how do i do all the little tricks of making things look certain ways so that's html and basic css at this point you are going to move into javascript fundamentals now javascript is a programming language and this is the programming language that you use on the web so you're going to learn programming basics you're going to learn how to select these are by the way all these things i'm typing are things that are really good google searches querying dom elements working with dom elements in javascript right i'm trying to give you the actual official names even though it sounds confusing now javascript event listeners these are all the search phrases that you're going to search for when you're learning this stuff you're basically going to say how do i take code and interact with the web page right like so how do i say when the user clicks on this button i want to go out to twitter and fetch their latest tweets and show them right there in the webpage or when they hover over this button how do i show other content on the page that didn't exist before they hovered on the button this is what you use javascript for you use javascript for programming making actions and things on the page and that's basically when you're going to learn javascript because it's programming if you're new to programming concepts like variables functions and flow control like if those words sound intimidating to you they're not really scary concepts but if they sound intimidating that's what you're going to be learning you're going to be learning programming basics and that's why i put two to six weeks here if you already kind of know programming with python or something you're going to be closer to that two weeks mark but if you if programming is new to you you're going to want to give yourself several weeks of buffer to look at what a variable is or a function and feel intimidated by the fact that that didn't make sense and then learn it again and oh okay after three or four days of learning functions over and over again that makes perfect sense i get it now so that's where that buffer time is going to come in and then lastly there's a little bit of head knowledge that you want to learn so i put about a day here what is dns like you want to know what dns is how you register for a domain name you want to learn what a web server or web host does for you and when you point your domain name to a web host what's actually happening you don't really have to know this stuff but you got to learn it at some point this is a pretty good time to learn it like when i type somewebsite.com how do i get a webpage back what actually happens like you're going to spend years really understanding this stuff but at this point it's good to have a basic idea of what happens when i type in the name for a website and then as a web developer what part of that do i control uh kind of a hint here you're going to register for a domain name you're going to point that domain to a web host and that web host has all your html css and javascript files on it so that web host when you say mywebsite.com it's going to give you back your main html page to all your users so that's basically what you're going to be learning here and at this point how do you publish your website because you're going to want to publish your websites there's some things you'll do a little later as you learn more technologies but for now the easiest thing is you're going to go with an html web host hostgator has long been the easiest one of the cheapest ways to set this up when you know what you know at the 101 level it's also pretty inexpensive it's like three to five dollars a month depending on how many months you pay for up front i have a video on how to do it start to finish we have a website up in like eight or ten minutes it's very very simple and there's also a few coupon codes that you can use that may or may not save you some money i have an affiliate thing with hostgator which i reached out to because i have always recommended them to people so feel free to use those or not use those this is 101 should take you between one and three or so months to learn this and once you get here you're ready to move on to the intermediate level give yourself a pat on the back let's move on moving over to web dev 102 we're going to confront maybe what for many people is their biggest intimidation and that's using the terminal that's right you're going to stop being afraid of it now for lots of people they see that plain white or plain black screen and just kind of freak out what is this how do i do it yeah it's just it's not that bad guys it's only scary if you've never used it it's pretty simple so you're just going to learn how to navigate around your computer right just like you would on your computer you'll click into folders find the file you want you're going to do that in the terminal you've got to use it at some point or people are just going to laugh at you on the interviews why not start learning it now so you're pretty comfortable with it when you go interviewing for jobs so you're going to learn the basic terminal you're going to learn how to get around and use it and then you're going to learn how to install node.js packages now node.js means two things it means one little things that help you out in your front end development that you're going to install on your machine and then node.js also means a backend programming language that you use to make web servers with you are not going to do that ladder part you're going to do the first part you're going to use node.js to install things that help you code better so we're going to learn how to install npm packages which is like one command it's not hard to do and then we're going to learn how to use other people's code which is called a package to help us code less and accomplish more that's the whole point of it right packages somebody wrote this cool thing that they find very useful and they put it up on the internet for any coder to use they call it a no js package an npm package so you're going to learn how to install npm packages to accomplish cool things on your own machine very easily then you're going to learn about version control this is the other big new concept that's going to happen in this section now i only put one to two weeks because it doesn't take very long to learn version control but basically version control is how we handle a bunch of people on a team coding on the same project if you imagine three people coding on the same file how does that work do you say hey other guys don't touch this file i'm working on it today and when i hit save then i'll call you back on the phone and you can start working on it that's a terrible terrible workflow as you can imagine that does not scale well to big teams and big companies so what we have to do is we actually have to use version control version control is going to track what everybody does and it's going to automatically merge all the changes together ah it's going to be so much nicer so you'll see when you learn how to use git for version control why people do it and why every serious professional company uses it super super cool a little bit of a learning curve give yourself a little bit of time don't rush it don't try to learn getting day even though you can learn the basics of git in an hour or two don't rush it you know get really comfortable with it give yourself a little bit of time at this point you are going to want to move on to intermediate css intermediate css is where you learn how to do things like hey i want one web page but i want it to look different on mobile than on desktop that's called media queries and responsive layouts these allow you to have the same content display a little bit differently on different machines same thing with responsive images if you're on a huge desktop machine maybe you want to display this massive background image and if you're on a mobile maybe you just want to download a little bitty image to use less bandwidth and make the page load faster so these are two responsive features that you're going to learn and then you're going to use a npm package called sas to compile sas code into css what that means is you're going to write a language that's better than css and then you're going to turn that language that code you write in sas into css code which will work on all the web pages browsers don't read sas code they read css code but it's easier to write sas code and then turn it into css code using a npm package called sas if that confuses you well it's not so bad and then you're going to learn how to break your css code into different files a 3 000 line css code is terrible to work with it's so much easier to work with 10 or 15 files that are much smaller in terms of code so you're going to learn how to break this up and also use sas to compile all those files down into one file now it's going to start feeling like you're a professional with your css handling and then lastly you want to learn css frameworks like tailwind css or bootstrap these are kind of some things that many many companies will use to manage their css and they make life a lot more enjoyable in many many circumstances then you're going to move on to an intermediate javascript here's where you learn how to actually become a more serious programmer you're going to learn a checklist of things that i won't go through because it'll probably just confuse you but you're going to basically learn all these different things in javascript some people that are more creative and not as technical you're going to lean more towards the six week mark of this if you're highly technical and you love complex topics then it'll be a lot easier for you either way the complexity is not terrible it really isn't terrible but depending on how you're wired if you're drawn more towards the design aspect of web development this will take you probably a little longer and if you're highly highly technical mathematical detailed you might just latch onto this and catch it a little bit faster so give yourself some time there depending on how you're wired and then lastly you're going to come over here to code quality basics these are some npm packages that we run against our code to help us out this right here will catch javascript errors before we ever run it in the browser that's what eslint does prettier can format our code whenever you hit save and it can make sure that everybody's code on a whole team looks exactly the same and is formatted and spaced exactly the same eslint and prettier are super awesome typescript allows you to add some extra features to javascript that do not exist in javascript all three of these are pretty stinking popular and it'd be really good to at least know what they are familiarize yourself with what they are and you're also going to want to learn here basic testing for your code testing is how you actually write programming to prove that your programming did what it should do let's say you had a math program that took a and b and returned a plus b well then you could write a test and said hey if a is one and b is two then you should return three that way if you accidentally ever make a change to your code and break what it should do your test will say hey a plus b doesn't equal 3 anymore what did you do wrong in your code so that's basically what tests are as you're writing your code you're writing tests against your code to make sure that it does well as you make changes over time it still does what you intended it to do at this point you also have a lot more options because you know git and github on how you can deploy your code to websites you can use github pages netlify or versel vercell is my favorite although it's not necessarily the cheapest depending on how you do it but there are some great ways if you know how to push your code to github to deploy your website and really enjoy your life now you're done with 102 lots of people or maybe not lots of people used to be you could get a job at this point it's getting a little trickier to get a job at this point um so it's probably worth mentioning that you want to go to 103 before seriously pursuing a career however if you're in a large city like new york atlanta la there's there's a decent uh chance that you could get a job with the 102 skill set it just will be a little harder to find you're gonna have to find a company that has specific niches for 102 level developers uh 102 by the way is totally something i've made up this is basically a benchmark you're looking for for a complete skill set on how to build flat web pages very very well 101 is how you build flat pages fairly well the advanced css and javascript you get in the 102 level allow you to build them very well especially node packages git all these things really give you a complete skill set around building flat web pages so the 103 skill set is all about building web apps you're going to learn how to use static site generators to build a huge application that is all flat content and you're also going to learn how to use single page applications or build web applications uh if you think about it every social media website you use is not a flat web page right it's not the same every time you visit it like maybe a company's business card style website would be a web application is going to be different every time you visit it because it's going to pull in information from a database on the internet it's going to show that to you uh like if you're thinking about using twitter as people are using it you're getting notifications you're seeing the likes go up you're seeing new content appear on the page as people post this is a web application and you're going to learn how to build this now you're going to learn how to use it with just javascript to make a really really basic web application and you're going to learn how routing works and how to use urls to store the where you were what page you were at and that as soon as you learn this you're going to realize this would be really frustrating to do without a package that helps me do a lot more and that's why you're going to learn react react is going to help you build web apps with javascript it's going to give you a whole lot of structure and a whole lot of tools that allow you to do those crazy things i talked about without a whole lot of difficulty it would just be very complex to do them by yourself without a framework that's what react is called it's a framework it's a set of structure and rules that if you use that structure and use those tools and rules you can get a whole lot done very quickly so you're going to learn how to do a basic react application where you can fetch data from the internet and then post it in your page and maybe send data back off to the internet when the user does certain things like write posts or write todo's in a todo list then you're gonna learn how to use css in react applications it's still css it's still sas it's everything you've been doing but you're gonna use it just a little bit differently inside of react it doesn't take too long you'll notice i put one to two weeks here as the timeline but it is something that you want to give yourself a little bit of time aside to learn because there's some methodology that goes into it and there are several options you can use next up you're going to learn some frameworks for react i thought you

ready to go look for a job you have a rock solid skill set that lots of people are looking for hiring and you can do a lot of things and provide a lot of value to your company same thing here how to publish websites at this point doesn't really change except for vercell is awesome for deploying next js applications absolutely love it it's it's the company that is the people that make next js so it just works very very well if you stuck with me through this point you're dedicated you're in you're gonna love it and you should probably subscribe and thumbs up if you have not subscribed to me yet because i'm gonna be adding a lot of these videos in uh probably even at some point building full courses that teach all of this stuff for not too much money because a boot camp would cost you about 18 000 to learn all this stuff and i think people should be able to learn it for a lot less if they are driven and motivated people so hope you enjoy this video hope it helps you out in your web dev learning journey good luck to you go learn go build great stuff and have a good day
