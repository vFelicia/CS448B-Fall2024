With timestamps:

00:01 - all right we're on video number two of
00:03 - our jQuery ajax series uh in the last uh
00:07 - video what we did is we covered how to
00:09 - do a get request to grab all of our
00:11 - orders from the server and spit them out
00:14 - so what we have here is an empty UL of
00:17 - orders no liis in it we're on page load
00:21 - we are grabbing all the orders and we're
00:23 - spitting out An Li for each one so
00:25 - that's what's going on here and you see
00:27 - if I inspect this element let's make
00:29 - this a little bigger here you see that I
00:31 - got two liis in here we have populated
00:34 - An Li for Will and An Li for Laura yippe
00:37 - so that's done let's go on and move into
00:40 - the next part which is posting our new
00:42 - drinks say I want to do a drink for John
00:44 - and he just gets a
00:46 - coffee I want to be able to add that I
00:48 - want that to do something I want it to
00:50 - add it to the backend server so it's now
00:52 - per permanently in the database and I
00:54 - also wanted to add it on the page when
00:55 - that's successful let's go ahead let me
00:58 - show you one more thing here on this get
01:00 - request or the jQuery ajax should I say
01:03 - is you can also do
01:05 - error and I can do an erir if this thing
01:07 - does not work I can
01:11 - alert error loading ORD so I have
01:14 - success and I have error if I
01:16 - refresh nothing happens because it was
01:18 - successful uh but let's say I give this
01:20 - a bad URL here two s's on accident alert
01:24 - error loading orders and nothing
01:26 - happened cool so I'll leave that in
01:28 - there and let's go into the next part we
01:30 - want to post new things to the backend
01:32 - so let's look at here from the backend
01:35 - team they said to add an order you send
01:38 - a post request to the same URL API
01:41 - orders except for we're not doing a get
01:43 - request we're doing a post request and
01:45 - which means we're sending information up
01:48 - and here's the sample post data that we
01:50 - are sending we're sending a Json post um
01:53 - and we're sending this information and
01:55 - it will respond kind of like a get
01:57 - request it will also have a response
02:00 - will have the item with an ID now which
02:02 - is if it's successful so we can use that
02:04 - ID to reference it later if we want to
02:06 - update our beverage order so let's go
02:10 - ahead and put that in so we have a
02:13 - button here the ID is ADD order so on
02:17 - click of add
02:23 - order we want to do something we want to
02:26 - make a post let's go ahead and grab our
02:30 - information up top let me cach this Dom
02:33 - every time we add an order we're going
02:34 - to want to look at these two fields and
02:37 - get the value out so I'm going to cash
02:38 - these two Fields up top and I think
02:42 - they're called name Yep they're called
02:44 - name and drink there you go name
02:54 - equals name and drink so on ADD order
02:57 - I'm going to get those two values out of
02:59 - here and then I'm going to post that
03:01 - order so let's go ahead and put together
03:03 - our little posting let's see from the
03:05 - backend team we want to post a simple
03:08 - object of name and drink so let's build
03:11 - that
03:16 - object and name. vow easy enough and
03:20 - then
03:23 - drink drink. valow so that's our order
03:26 - right there we have our name and our
03:27 - drink we're getting the value out of
03:28 - these two fields and we're moving on and
03:32 - then we're going to do Ajax
03:35 - again this type is going to be a post
03:40 - not a get which means we're sending
03:42 - information URL is the
03:46 - same and then we also have a data field
03:49 - since we are passing data in we're going
03:52 - to give it our order right there our
03:54 - order
03:55 - object and a success
03:57 - function and so the order you can
03:59 - actually pass it an existing object or
04:01 - you can actually just kind of create an
04:03 - object on the fly like this if we were
04:06 - to do that that would be the exact same
04:07 - thing we're creating a brand new object
04:10 - it's a little cleaner in my opinion to
04:12 - build the object up there and then so
04:14 - this stays clean um so on success this
04:18 - is our new
04:19 - order that they have given us
04:22 - back um we can do the exact same thing
04:25 - here orders.
04:28 - append New
04:32 - Order and New
04:36 - Order so we are doing is we're posting
04:38 - our new order to the back end we're
04:40 - going to wait for that to be successful
04:42 - if it's successful we are going to add a
04:45 - new Li to our list so it shows up on our
04:47 - page and I'll also add an
04:51 - error and we'll just call this
04:56 - alert error saving order not message
04:59 - there we go let's see if this
05:01 - works so uh oh I have a JavaScript error
05:04 - here let's find out what that's all
05:06 - about unexpected token online 24 yep I
05:10 - did bad syntax those of you guys who are
05:11 - watching the video watching that I
05:13 - cannot type and talk at the same time
05:15 - are probably laughing out loud at me
05:17 - okay so our two drinks are populated in
05:19 - let's add a new one John just likes
05:22 - coffee haha it did it let's go and look
05:25 - at our Network Tab and see what just
05:28 - happened so you notice we did our
05:30 - initial get of orders and then we did a
05:33 - little while later we did a post to the
05:36 - same API and let's look at that real
05:39 - quick you'll notice we posted this
05:42 - information of name John drink coffee
05:46 - and then we got a response of name John
05:50 - drink coffee and an ID of three and so
05:52 - now watch what happens when we refresh
05:54 - our page we've saved it to the back end
05:58 - and now we're getting three drinks so if
05:59 - I had two more
06:02 - drinks Bobby likes water not sure why
06:06 - there we go so now if I refresh now we
06:08 - have all four drinks awesome we have a
06:10 - fully functioning app that talks to the
06:13 - back end and so one thing I do not like
06:16 - that's going on here is I don't really
06:18 - like that we are copying this EXA
06:21 - basically this exact same thing over
06:24 - again so let's go ahead and pull that
06:28 - out we're going to make a function
06:30 - called add
06:34 - order and this will just take an order
06:38 - so let's get rid of this right here cut
06:40 - you out paste you in here order. name so
06:43 - basically whatever we pass it is going
06:45 - to be calling it order so now I just
06:47 - have to go add
06:49 - order and give it my order same thing
06:52 - down here hate that we're doing the
06:54 - exact same
06:56 - thing except for we're going to be
06:58 - passing it the New Order In this case
07:00 - that should work just fine so I refresh
07:02 - it's still populating my initial orders
07:04 - just fine and if I do a new
07:08 - one drink will be
07:12 - latte there we go that's working just
07:14 - fine as well so now what we've done is
07:17 - we have pulled this out to uh a single
07:21 - function here um but if we want to get
07:22 - much more complicated than this it's
07:24 - going to get really messy I really want
07:27 - to start adding more elements in here
07:28 - like a paragraph gra tag and some strong
07:31 - tags but that's just going to be a giant
07:33 - messy string we really want to do this
07:36 - with a templating engine so let's go
07:38 - ahead and add in Hogan JS into our next
07:42 - ah we'll use mustache JS let's go Ahad
07:44 - and add mustache JS into our next video
07:47 - and then we'll add in the delete
07:48 - functionality to wrap up our application

Cleaned transcript:

all right we're on video number two of our jQuery ajax series uh in the last uh video what we did is we covered how to do a get request to grab all of our orders from the server and spit them out so what we have here is an empty UL of orders no liis in it we're on page load we are grabbing all the orders and we're spitting out An Li for each one so that's what's going on here and you see if I inspect this element let's make this a little bigger here you see that I got two liis in here we have populated An Li for Will and An Li for Laura yippe so that's done let's go on and move into the next part which is posting our new drinks say I want to do a drink for John and he just gets a coffee I want to be able to add that I want that to do something I want it to add it to the backend server so it's now per permanently in the database and I also wanted to add it on the page when that's successful let's go ahead let me show you one more thing here on this get request or the jQuery ajax should I say is you can also do error and I can do an erir if this thing does not work I can alert error loading ORD so I have success and I have error if I refresh nothing happens because it was successful uh but let's say I give this a bad URL here two s's on accident alert error loading orders and nothing happened cool so I'll leave that in there and let's go into the next part we want to post new things to the backend so let's look at here from the backend team they said to add an order you send a post request to the same URL API orders except for we're not doing a get request we're doing a post request and which means we're sending information up and here's the sample post data that we are sending we're sending a Json post um and we're sending this information and it will respond kind of like a get request it will also have a response will have the item with an ID now which is if it's successful so we can use that ID to reference it later if we want to update our beverage order so let's go ahead and put that in so we have a button here the ID is ADD order so on click of add order we want to do something we want to make a post let's go ahead and grab our information up top let me cach this Dom every time we add an order we're going to want to look at these two fields and get the value out so I'm going to cash these two Fields up top and I think they're called name Yep they're called name and drink there you go name equals name and drink so on ADD order I'm going to get those two values out of here and then I'm going to post that order so let's go ahead and put together our little posting let's see from the backend team we want to post a simple object of name and drink so let's build that object and name. vow easy enough and then drink drink. valow so that's our order right there we have our name and our drink we're getting the value out of these two fields and we're moving on and then we're going to do Ajax again this type is going to be a post not a get which means we're sending information URL is the same and then we also have a data field since we are passing data in we're going to give it our order right there our order object and a success function and so the order you can actually pass it an existing object or you can actually just kind of create an object on the fly like this if we were to do that that would be the exact same thing we're creating a brand new object it's a little cleaner in my opinion to build the object up there and then so this stays clean um so on success this is our new order that they have given us back um we can do the exact same thing here orders. append New Order and New Order so we are doing is we're posting our new order to the back end we're going to wait for that to be successful if it's successful we are going to add a new Li to our list so it shows up on our page and I'll also add an error and we'll just call this alert error saving order not message there we go let's see if this works so uh oh I have a JavaScript error here let's find out what that's all about unexpected token online 24 yep I did bad syntax those of you guys who are watching the video watching that I cannot type and talk at the same time are probably laughing out loud at me okay so our two drinks are populated in let's add a new one John just likes coffee haha it did it let's go and look at our Network Tab and see what just happened so you notice we did our initial get of orders and then we did a little while later we did a post to the same API and let's look at that real quick you'll notice we posted this information of name John drink coffee and then we got a response of name John drink coffee and an ID of three and so now watch what happens when we refresh our page we've saved it to the back end and now we're getting three drinks so if I had two more drinks Bobby likes water not sure why there we go so now if I refresh now we have all four drinks awesome we have
