With timestamps:

00:00 - so in our first JavaScript lesson we
00:02 - learned about variables and we learned
00:04 - about the first two types which is the
00:06 - number and string and there's really
00:09 - only six or eight types in JavaScript
00:11 - depending on how you look at it so
00:12 - they're not going to go on and on
00:13 - forever but before we get into the next
00:15 - types I want to show you some extra
00:17 - programming tips or some extra ways that
00:19 - you can build programs with the types
00:21 - that you already know let's say that my
00:24 - user's age is 16 years old and I want to
00:28 - write a program to where if they're less
00:29 - than 16 it's going to alert that they
00:31 - can't drive if they're older than 16 uh
00:34 - it's going to alert that they can drive
00:37 - how would I do that uh we're going to do
00:39 - that with an if statement so I'm going
00:41 - to do if and I'm going to open and close
00:42 - my parentheses again and I'm going to
00:45 - open and close my curly braces now for
00:47 - this I'm going to want to do multiple
00:48 - lines so you're going to want to hold
00:50 - control or shift depending on if you're
00:51 - on Mac or Windows and then it's going to
00:54 - allow us to do multiple lines of code
00:56 - here and it won't run until we hit enter
00:59 - so I can go if age is less than remember
01:02 - that sign for math class I'll show I'll
01:04 - talk about it more in a minute alerts
01:07 - you canot
01:09 - drive so this is a less than symbol it's
01:12 - called a comparison operator um and
01:15 - basically because the little side points
01:18 - over here if the age is little than 16
01:22 - or if it's less than 16 then we are
01:25 - going to do what is ever in between
01:27 - these curly braces basically if the
01:29 - question we asking here is true then
01:31 - we're going to do what's between the
01:33 - curly braces if it's not true we're
01:35 - going to ignore what's in between the
01:36 - curly braces so right now my age is 16
01:40 - and I've said if age is less than 16
01:43 - then alert I cannot drive it didn't do
01:45 - anything at all because my age is 16 or
01:48 - greater so if I change age to
01:50 - 15 and run it again I hit the up Arrow a
01:54 - couple times uh one great thing about
01:55 - the console is your up and down arrows
01:57 - will give you all your history so I hit
01:59 - the up a couple times and hit enter now
02:02 - it says I cannot drive because my AG is
02:04 - changed to 15 let's look at some more
02:07 - comparison operators real quick I'm
02:08 - going to pull that up again uh there's
02:11 - the less than and then there's greater
02:13 - than so this would be if age is greater
02:15 - than 16 and then I can also add an
02:18 - equals to either of those and this means
02:20 - is it greater than or equal to 16 so
02:23 - greater than 16 would be 17 and up
02:26 - greater than equal would be 16 and up
02:29 - less L than would be 15 and under less
02:32 - than an equal would be 16 or under so 16
02:36 - is also included in the group I can also
02:38 - do two equals for is exactly 16 and then
02:43 - I can also do not equal for is not 16 so
02:48 - if your age is not 16 you canot drive
02:51 - doesn't make any sense but that's kind
02:53 - of how you do that I will put these in
02:54 - the description because you you might
02:56 - forget them and you might want to
02:58 - remember them so if your age is let's go
03:02 - back to our program if your age is less
03:04 - than 16 alert you cannot drive let's say
03:06 - I want to say alert you can't drive this
03:08 - is going to be a little Rabbit Trail but
03:10 - it's important to notice uh there's a
03:12 - problem with this code because I'm
03:14 - opening up my string here with a single
03:17 - quote and then I'm ending it here but
03:19 - I'm actually not ending it here I'm
03:21 - ending it here so that's actually going
03:23 - to give an error this will not work and
03:25 - so what if you want to add a single
03:27 - quote inside of or an apostrophe inside
03:31 - of a string we have two choices you can
03:34 - either go to double quotes here and so
03:37 - now that's going to work um or what you
03:40 - can
03:41 - do is you can do what's called escaping
03:44 - it with a backslash The Back The Backs
03:46 - slash in a string says whatever the next
03:49 - character is don't treat it as code
03:51 - treat it as a string character so this
03:54 - will work now it's going to be y u space
03:56 - c n apostrophe T Dr so let's hit that
04:00 - and you'll see it says you can't drive
04:02 - with an apostrophe and so that's called
04:05 - escaping that's important uh to know I
04:08 - know it's kind of a rabbit Trail kind of
04:09 - off the beaten path of where we're going
04:11 - but that's important so let's go if age
04:14 - is less than 16 alert you can't drive if
04:16 - age is greater than
04:20 - 16
04:21 - alert you can
04:24 - drive and an exclamation cuz driving is
04:26 - fun there's a problem with our program
04:28 - though is what if the user is 16 so if
04:30 - it's less than 16 it'll do this if
04:33 - they're older than 16 like 17 then it'll
04:36 - do that but what if they're exactly 16
04:38 - well let's fix that by going less
04:40 - greater than equal so now if you're 16
04:43 - or older you can drive so now our
04:45 - program will always alert something
04:47 - let's change my age to
04:49 - 17 you also notice I didn't do V anymore
04:53 - that's CU I've already defined the
04:54 - variable of age you only have to do V
04:57 - the first
04:58 - time a equal 17 and let's run our
05:02 - program again it says you can drive now
05:04 - let's change our age to 16 and make sure
05:06 - that our program works age 16 yep you
05:10 - can drive too let's go one more step
05:12 - further with our
05:14 - program and what you can actually do is
05:16 - you can make this go else let's clean
05:18 - this up a little
05:20 - bit what you can do instead of if if is
05:23 - you can do what called an if else
05:24 - statement I can say if age is less than
05:27 - 16 do this else we're going to do this
05:31 - so basically if you're not younger than
05:33 - 16 we're going to do what's in here
05:35 - every single time so this program will
05:37 - do the exact same thing you can also do
05:41 - an if else an else if statement so what
05:44 - that would do is you can add another
05:47 - condition you can do another set of
05:48 - comparison operations in here so if the
05:51 - age is less than 16 do this else if age
05:56 - is exactly 16 you can drive
06:00 - finally else which would mean if they're
06:03 - older than
06:05 - 16
06:06 - alert you've probably been driving
06:12 - already and you'll notice once again I
06:15 - have to escape that because that's not
06:17 - allowed I would have been closing this
06:19 - off with y apostrophe and this would
06:21 - have just been bad code so now if our
06:23 - age is less than 16 we're going to do
06:25 - this else if our age is exactly 16 we're
06:29 - going to do this and if it's anything
06:31 - besides that we're going to alert that
06:33 - you've probably been driving
06:34 - already and so my age currently is 16
06:37 - you can drive finally let's change our
06:40 - age to
06:42 - 15 run our program you can't drive let's
06:46 - change our age to
06:50 - 17 you've probably been driving already
06:53 - and let's do something let's change our
06:55 - age to
06:56 - 16.5 what do you think it's going to do
06:58 - I changed it to 16
07:00 - .5 well it's going to do else because
07:02 - it's not exactly 16 it's greater than 16
07:06 - you've probably been driving already and
07:07 - it's true just not for very long so
07:09 - please keep driving safely so that is if
07:12 - else statements so now go ahead and
07:14 - write maybe another program where you
07:16 - prompt you get something from a user and
07:21 - do something fun with it so have a great
07:24 - day and enjoy JavaScript lesson number
07:27 - two

Cleaned transcript:

so in our first JavaScript lesson we learned about variables and we learned about the first two types which is the number and string and there's really only six or eight types in JavaScript depending on how you look at it so they're not going to go on and on forever but before we get into the next types I want to show you some extra programming tips or some extra ways that you can build programs with the types that you already know let's say that my user's age is 16 years old and I want to write a program to where if they're less than 16 it's going to alert that they can't drive if they're older than 16 uh it's going to alert that they can drive how would I do that uh we're going to do that with an if statement so I'm going to do if and I'm going to open and close my parentheses again and I'm going to open and close my curly braces now for this I'm going to want to do multiple lines so you're going to want to hold control or shift depending on if you're on Mac or Windows and then it's going to allow us to do multiple lines of code here and it won't run until we hit enter so I can go if age is less than remember that sign for math class I'll show I'll talk about it more in a minute alerts you canot drive so this is a less than symbol it's called a comparison operator um and basically because the little side points over here if the age is little than 16 or if it's less than 16 then we are going to do what is ever in between these curly braces basically if the question we asking here is true then we're going to do what's between the curly braces if it's not true we're going to ignore what's in between the curly braces so right now my age is 16 and I've said if age is less than 16 then alert I cannot drive it didn't do anything at all because my age is 16 or greater so if I change age to 15 and run it again I hit the up Arrow a couple times uh one great thing about the console is your up and down arrows will give you all your history so I hit the up a couple times and hit enter now it says I cannot drive because my AG is changed to 15 let's look at some more comparison operators real quick I'm going to pull that up again uh there's the less than and then there's greater than so this would be if age is greater than 16 and then I can also add an equals to either of those and this means is it greater than or equal to 16 so greater than 16 would be 17 and up greater than equal would be 16 and up less L than would be 15 and under less than an equal would be 16 or under so 16 is also included in the group I can also do two equals for is exactly 16 and then I can also do not equal for is not 16 so if your age is not 16 you canot drive doesn't make any sense but that's kind of how you do that I will put these in the description because you you might forget them and you might want to remember them so if your age is let's go back to our program if your age is less than 16 alert you cannot drive let's say I want to say alert you can't drive this is going to be a little Rabbit Trail but it's important to notice uh there's a problem with this code because I'm opening up my string here with a single quote and then I'm ending it here but I'm actually not ending it here I'm ending it here so that's actually going to give an error this will not work and so what if you want to add a single quote inside of or an apostrophe inside of a string we have two choices you can either go to double quotes here and so now that's going to work um or what you can do is you can do what's called escaping it with a backslash The Back The Backs slash in a string says whatever the next character is don't treat it as code treat it as a string character so this will work now it's going to be y u space c n apostrophe T Dr so let's hit that and you'll see it says you can't drive with an apostrophe and so that's called escaping that's important uh to know I know it's kind of a rabbit Trail kind of off the beaten path of where we're going but that's important so let's go if age is less than 16 alert you can't drive if age is greater than 16 alert you can drive and an exclamation cuz driving is fun there's a problem with our program though is what if the user is 16 so if it's less than 16 it'll do this if they're older than 16 like 17 then it'll do that but what if they're exactly 16 well let's fix that by going less greater than equal so now if you're 16 or older you can drive so now our program will always alert something let's change my age to 17 you also notice I didn't do V anymore that's CU I've already defined the variable of age you only have to do V the first time a equal 17 and let's run our program again it says you can drive now let's change our age to 16 and make sure that our program works age 16 yep you can drive too let's go one more step further with our program and what you can actually do is you can make this go else let's clean this up a little bit what you can do instead of if if is you can do what called an if else statement I can say if age is less than 16 do this else we're going to do this so basically if you're not younger than 16 we're going to do what's in here every single time so this program will do the exact same thing you can also do an if else an else if statement so what that would do is you can add another condition you can do another set of comparison operations in here so if the age is less than 16 do this else if age is exactly 16 you can drive finally else which would mean if they're older than 16 alert you've probably been driving already and you'll notice once again I have to escape that because that's not allowed I would have been closing this off with y apostrophe and this would have just been bad code so now if our age is less than 16 we're going to do this else if our age is exactly 16 we're going to do this and if it's anything besides that we're going to alert that you've probably been driving already and so my age currently is 16 you can drive finally let's change our age to 15 run our program you can't drive let's change our age to 17 you've probably been driving already and let's do something let's change our age to 16.5 what do you think it's going to do I changed it to 16 .5 well it's going to do else because it's not exactly 16 it's greater than 16 you've probably been driving already and it's true just not for very long so please keep driving safely so that is if else statements so now go ahead and write maybe another program where you prompt you get something from a user and do something fun with it so have a great day and enjoy
