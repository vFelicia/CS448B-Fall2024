00:01 - okay so on our last tutorial we started
00:03 - off uh with an introduction to bootstrap
00:06 - Twitter bootstrap I would highly
00:08 - encourage you to use bootstrap from now
00:10 - on start getting comfortable with it
00:13 - because you will write very few CSS
00:15 - rules and you'll be able to create very
00:18 - great stable stuff websites all over the
00:21 - world huge scale web sites are using
00:23 - Twitter bootstrap um and check the link
00:25 - if you did not catch that tutorial one
00:28 - thing you'll notice is this is not
00:29 - working yet that is because I
00:31 - accidentally forgot jQuery you'll notice
00:33 - I grabbed on bootstrap's website I
00:35 - grabbed these three things two CSS and
00:37 - one JavaScript uh but what I forgot is
00:40 - that bootstrap uses jQuery so if you
00:42 - scroll down to basic template you'll see
00:45 - that they include jQuery here so I'm
00:48 - going to copy that and put the jQuery
00:50 - script in my thing as
00:54 - well now you notice everything's working
00:56 - beautifully my drop down works so that's
00:59 - what it looks like on on a mobile and if
01:01 - you expand it out here's what it looks
01:03 - like on a regular website looks very
01:06 - nice and there we go so now I'm going to
01:08 - go ahead and move forward with a little
01:11 - bit more CSS stuff so back to basic CSS
01:15 - Maybe for One More lesson and then we'll
01:17 - move on and be done uh say we wanted to
01:21 - create one of these ourselves cuz even
01:23 - when you're using bootstrap every once
01:24 - in a while you've got to make something
01:26 - custom and it's really good to know some
01:28 - CSS moving forward so let's say I want
01:30 - to recreate one of these kind of widgets
01:32 - here let's say instead of calling it
01:34 - panel I'm going to call it my
01:40 - panel let's go div let's go
01:45 - header and we'll call it class
01:50 - body We'll add a single paragraph in
01:54 - here so right now completely unstyled
01:57 - seems to be normal let's go and open my
01:59 - main CSS I've already created three
02:01 - rules here my
02:05 - panel and heading so let's go ahead and
02:10 - give my panel a margin you can see I did
02:12 - a little bit of my homework
02:14 - beforehand 3% so that way it's always
02:18 - going to be within 3% of either Edge and
02:22 - let's give the heading a
02:26 - color this is some of this is going to
02:28 - be a little bit repeat for you so
02:31 - so give it we'll give it black for now
02:33 - just so we can see where we're
02:36 - sitting did I call it header yep called
02:39 - it header
02:41 - heading and one thing you'll notice is
02:44 - is I did my panel space heading one
02:46 - thing that people do accidentally all
02:47 - the time is they'll do my panel do
02:50 - heading and what that is going to look
02:52 - for is something that has the class my
02:54 - panel and the class heading this is the
02:57 - same as that because it's looking for
03:00 - something with both classes so you'll
03:02 - notice right now this selector is not
03:04 - selecting anything if I did my panel and
03:07 - added a class of heading now I've added
03:10 - two classes you'll notice it starts
03:12 - picking up on the entire panel now just
03:15 - in case you run into that and wonder
03:17 - what's going on and why your codee's not
03:18 - working you probably forgot a space
03:20 - there anytime you add a space it goes to
03:22 - the next level and is looking for a
03:24 - child of this guy so I obviously don't
03:27 - want black so let's look into kind of
03:30 - doing the a Color Picker to pick a color
03:32 - we want I'm just going to go to Google
03:34 - and I'm going to type in online Color
03:36 - Picker there we
03:39 - go there we go online Color Picker let's
03:42 - pick a color let's say a nice
03:45 - greenish sure that works I'm going to
03:47 - copy that and you'll notice it gave me
03:49 - the pound
03:51 - hex value so I'm going to do that paste
03:54 - it
03:55 - in hey we have kind of a normal looking
03:58 - color there that's kind of where you're
03:59 - going to do do a lot of your color
04:00 - picking from if you don't use
04:02 - Photoshop let's go ahead you'll notice
04:05 - this is snug up against the edges so I'm
04:06 - going to add some padding to
04:09 - this I'm noticing my padding here is a
04:12 - little bit less on the top and bottom
04:13 - and more on the left so I'm going to try
04:15 - maybe 10 pixels top bottom 20 pixels
04:19 - left
04:20 - right yep looks pretty good and then I'm
04:24 - noticing there's actually kind of a
04:25 - darker color for the text so I'm going
04:27 - to go back to my Color Picker
04:30 - I'm going to try to darken this guy up a
04:32 - little
04:33 - bit and see if that could be a good text
04:35 - color for
04:42 - me yeah looks kind of good a little bit
04:45 - lighter but no worries I'm also going to
04:47 - make the border that same
04:49 - color one pixel
04:54 - solid when you're defining
04:57 - borders you go with your width first
04:59 - first then your style and then your
05:01 - color I could go I Believe I Can Go
05:03 - dotted pretty much solid is what you're
05:06 - going to use all the time yeah there's
05:07 - dotted I think I can go dashed there's a
05:09 - bunch of them out there you'll need to
05:11 - search for them yeah dashed usually
05:14 - you're just going to use
05:15 - solid one pixel solid there you go
05:18 - that's looking nice and then I'm also
05:20 - going to add a border radius which is a
05:22 - different
05:24 - Rule and that's going to be the curved
05:27 - Corners let's try 10 pixels
05:31 - that's a little too much go five pixels
05:34 - border radius works like everything else
05:36 - I can give it five pixels five pixels 0
05:39 - 0 and that'll give me five pixels top
05:41 - bottom zero on the left and the right if
05:45 - I just kind of want that one corner I
05:47 - can go zero
05:49 - pixels you notice it'll Lop off this guy
05:51 - so I just kind of have that one corner
05:53 - right there um and I'll just go five
05:56 - pixels for all of them one thing you'll
05:59 - notice a lot of times too is you'll
06:00 - notice - webkit border
06:06 - radius and what it is is older browsers
06:09 - used to not officially support this
06:12 - border radius tag because it's pretty
06:14 - new so these this is called a vendor
06:16 - prefix this is any browser using webkit
06:19 - which would be Chrome or Safari or
06:21 - pretty much any mobile phone older
06:23 - phones will need to add that Milla
06:26 - Firefox uses the mo
06:31 - VI pixels and so lots of times if you
06:33 - want to make it fully compliant with
06:34 - older browsers you'll do these things
06:37 - you'll do these three you go border
06:38 - radius webkit border radius Mo border
06:41 - radius um and then if you happen to be
06:44 - sporting older Opera oh border
06:48 - radius it's kind of annoying we're
06:51 - pretty much on the verge of being out of
06:53 - these things but it's still not a bad
06:55 - idea to add in the vendor prefixes for
06:57 - now I'll just keep them out just for
06:59 - cleanness you also notice I'm I'm trying
07:01 - to kind of keep it in alphabetical order
07:03 - here it's not a rule that you have to do
07:05 - that but it's a good idea keeps things
07:08 - clean uh one thing I'm noticing is I do
07:10 - not want a border radius on the bottom
07:13 - of my header so I'm going to go five
07:14 - picks zero actually I think I might need
07:16 - to go yep that is not going to do what I
07:19 - want it to do five pixels five pixels 0
07:22 - 0 so that way it's on the top and the
07:25 - bottom and I want this border to
07:27 - actually apply wh
07:30 - want this border to apply to the entire
07:34 - panel which is what's going on up here
07:37 - there we go that's looking a little
07:38 - better and I want this border radius you
07:39 - notice my this has a uh border radius
07:43 - but I want the panel to have a border
07:44 - radius as
07:46 - well there we go looking better now this
07:50 - has the Border radius you see if I take
07:52 - this off then it's square and then the
07:54 - Border below it is square and you'll get
07:56 - a couple weird little pixels there so
07:59 - I'm keeping the Border radius on both of
08:02 - them let's move on to the
08:07 - body if I can
08:10 - type my panel body let's give it padding
08:13 - let's try the same 10 pixels 20
08:18 - pixels there you go looking good and I
08:23 - actually want this to have a 5 pixel
08:25 - border radius
08:27 - everywhere there we go we basically
08:29 - created this panel uh let's look into a
08:33 - couple other things you know what I'm
08:34 - noticing is it looks like there might be
08:35 - an Ever So slight Shadow on these panels
08:38 - so I'm going to go ahead and add this
08:40 - it's called box
08:42 - Shadow and box Shadow has four values it
08:46 - has your
08:48 - offset uh your X offset y offset your
08:53 - blur and then your color it's kind of
08:56 - how that works is let's start with a 10
08:58 - pix pix 10 pixel Z pixel blur and just
09:03 - black to make it clear what's going on
09:06 - you'll notice it's 10 pixels this way 10
09:08 - pixels down and it's not blurred at all
09:11 - and it's black so if I make this blur 10
09:13 - pixels you notice it's starts getting
09:15 - fuzzy now and so with these guys it
09:18 - looks like they don't have any offset at
09:20 - all this it's kind of like just a
09:23 - all-inclusive Shadow this is probably a
09:25 - lot smaller like four pixels and this is
09:28 - not black it's it's a very light color
09:30 - maybe like a
09:32 - [Music]
09:36 - 999 yeah you can barely see it now looks
09:39 - like that might be maybe even lighter
09:40 - CCC is a lighter color I have a few of
09:43 - these colors memorized there you go so
09:45 - it's got that ever so slight gray shadow
09:48 - that these other ones seem to have so
09:50 - that's kind of how we're going to do a
09:51 - box Shadow on this entire panel let's
09:54 - say we wanted to give this I'm going to
09:56 - copy and paste this a few times
10:02 - let's say we wanted to create three of
10:03 - these and whenever we hovered over one
10:05 - we wanted a delete button to appear what
10:07 - I'm going to do here is I'm going to add
10:09 - a div and this class will be show on
10:14 - Hover and then in here I'm going to add
10:17 - a bootstrap
10:19 - button think it's button danger is a red
10:26 - one delete there we go so that's there
10:29 - it'll always be there for now let me go
10:31 - and add that to my other
10:33 - two yeah it's actually a little big I
10:35 - want it to be
10:37 - button
10:38 - XS button extra small there you
10:43 - go let's go and add this to each one of
10:46 - these so now they each have a delete
10:50 - button and I'm going to
10:55 - go uh I'll make it show whenever you
10:58 - hover over my panel so here's how I'm
11:00 - going to do that my
11:02 - panel show on Hover is going to be
11:06 - display
11:09 - none so they are not going to appear at
11:12 - all and then what I'm going to do is my
11:15 - panel hover so now these rules will only
11:18 - apply whenever you're hovering over my
11:25 - panel my panel show on Hover display
11:29 - back to inline
11:30 - block which is what it was before so now
11:33 - whenever I hover over a panel that
11:35 - appears nice so now it feels like your
11:39 - page is doing some really smart stuff
11:40 - really all we're doing is we're hiding
11:42 - it and we're showing it whenever you
11:44 - hover over this panel at all H kind of
11:46 - nifty you know what else I could do is I
11:48 - could go my panel
11:53 - hover I could make this box Shadow get a
11:56 - little bigger when you hover over it
11:59 - this kind of just some ideas of things
12:01 - that you can do maybe I'll make it like
12:02 - eight pixels and I will make it a more
12:06 - apparent
12:08 - Shadow there you go now whenever you
12:10 - hover over it see that shadow is just a
12:11 - little bit more to show you what I mean
12:13 - I'll make it full
12:15 - black a little too much for design sake
12:18 - but whenever you hover over it kind of
12:20 - gives it a little pop now I could even
12:22 - make the Border a little bit
12:26 - larger maybe like a two pixel border
12:31 - there you go now it really kind of has
12:32 - some pop whenever you hover over it see
12:35 - it jumps a little bit because the Border
12:36 - has now made it a few pixels larger now
12:39 - it's got an extra pixel on top because
12:41 - that borders two pixels extra pixel on
12:44 - the bottom so you notice it kind of the
12:46 - guys below it do this little jump down
12:48 - thing so ideally I'd probably adjust
12:50 - some margins there on this hover thing
12:53 - so let me
12:57 - see
13:00 - maybe that'd be 1% 3% see if I can
13:04 - compensate for
13:09 - that oh you know what is that delete
13:11 - button showing up okay so that's
13:12 - automatically going to be larger that's
13:14 - supposed to be happening that's what's
13:16 - going on there we'll leave it so that's
13:18 - kind of a little bit more intermediate
13:20 - CSS and before I wrap up this lesson um
13:22 - I'll get into kind of a few more
13:24 - selectors and I'll talk a little bit
13:27 - about specificity and cascading stuff so
13:31 - let's go and just clear all this out
13:33 - save that let me clear all this
13:37 - out and I'm just you know I'll just
13:39 - create a complete Blank Slate
13:42 - here before I wrap up this lesson on CSS
13:46 - I'm going to go and create an
13:51 - H1 hello
13:53 - world so I'm going to in my stylesheet
13:56 - I'm going to go H1
14:00 - color
14:01 - red now H1s are going to be
14:06 - red
14:08 - H1s should be red not exactly sure
14:12 - what's going on
14:13 - there oh probably because bootstrap has
14:16 - an
14:19 - H1 let's make it a class H1 bootstrap
14:22 - has a whole bunch of rules in it and so
14:24 - that's where all my colors are coming
14:25 - from from bootstrap
14:27 - already oh no
14:29 - what's going on
14:31 - here let's just make it a
14:37 - paragraph one of the things you run into
14:39 - sometimes with using something like
14:41 - bootstrap is it's doing a whole bunch of
14:44 - stuff and you don't exactly know what
14:45 - it's doing and so sometimes you can get
14:47 - frustrated trying to do things so
14:49 - definitely there's some downsides let me
14:51 - make it really
14:53 - large
14:55 - 400% okay there we go kind of ran into
14:58 - an is issue that I'm actually going to
14:59 - demonstrate here so now paragraphs have
15:01 - a color of red anything that comes after
15:05 - will overwrite if it's the same level of
15:07 - specificity so if it's as specific so
15:11 - I'm going to go color
15:13 - blue now you'll notice even though I've
15:15 - defined a color red P's will have color
15:17 - blue because it came after the fact now
15:20 - if I went P
15:22 - class um
15:25 - primary and this had a class of primary
15:31 - now it became righted again because this
15:33 - is a more specific rule than this this
15:36 - just applies to paragraphs this applies
15:38 - to paragraphs with a class of primary
15:42 - now if I went P
15:45 - ID
15:48 - of
15:49 - [Music]
15:52 - main green so now if I have an ID on
15:55 - here ID just got even more specific
15:59 - and now it's green so you'll see that
16:01 - that's kind of even though they came
16:03 - before IDs are more specific than uh
16:08 - classes and classes are more specific
16:10 - than just elements and so that's kind of
16:13 - how that works you notice even if I take
16:15 - away the P an ID is more specific than
16:18 - both of
16:20 - these however if I go
16:25 - primary matching by ID or matching by
16:29 - tag name and by class name is considered
16:32 - more specific than matching by class
16:34 - name so this sets it to Green this
16:37 - overwrites it to red and then this
16:39 - doesn't do anything this makes it all
16:42 - paragraph tags are now would be blue for
16:45 - any just standard paragraph tags so
16:47 - that's kind of how specificity works is
16:50 - if I were to also go primary
16:54 - other if this said p. primary is red
16:58 - I'll do it like this p. primary is red
17:01 - p. primary.
17:03 - other is green now so if I make it class
17:06 - primary and other well now that's
17:08 - considered even more specific it matches
17:11 - on three levels it matches on a tag
17:13 - level on a class level and on a
17:17 - secondary class level or an additional
17:19 - class level so this is now the most
17:22 - specific rule that applies to my
17:24 - paragraph tag here so it will be green
17:27 - so that's kind of how that goes if
17:28 - you're including it all in a stylesheet
17:30 - now let's look into doing something else
17:32 - let me copy main CSS and let me save
17:36 - this
17:38 - as other
17:40 - CSS and I'm going to include other CSS
17:44 - after main CSS
17:48 - here
17:50 - other main CSS other CSS so now we have
17:53 - two things we're including in let's make
17:56 - main CSS just have PS be a color of
17:59 - blue let's have other CSS beps with a
18:03 - color of
18:06 - red now my paragraph is red kind of what
18:09 - happens is is it goes
18:12 - main loads up all the main rules and
18:15 - then loads up all the other rules and
18:16 - it's no different than if they were
18:18 - stacked on top of each other so main
18:21 - color blue then it loads in other color
18:24 - red that's no different than if you did
18:26 - this blue red what we've done is we've
18:29 - split them up into separate style sheets
18:32 - which sometimes makes sense if you start
18:33 - getting a really big style sheet makes a
18:36 - lot of sense to split them up into
18:38 - groupings so it's a lot easier to find
18:41 - out where your file where your rules go
18:44 - let's move on and so now let's add a
18:47 - style here this is a page level
18:50 - stylesheet I'm just adding a style tag
18:52 - straight in here I'm going to go P color
18:56 - green now paragraphs have a color of
18:59 - green you'll notice if I put this before
19:02 - my
19:03 - link the paragraphs now have a color of
19:05 - red because this happens before loads up
19:08 - these Styles then it goes to here then
19:11 - it goes to here so they get overwritten
19:13 - by what's here on the page um page page
19:17 - level stylesheet not really that great
19:19 - of an idea I wouldn't recommend doing it
19:21 - because then you have to copy and paste
19:23 - rules all over the place another third
19:26 - way you can do it is you can actually
19:28 - add inline style
19:30 - here on any
19:33 - tag can I do pink I think I can do pink
19:37 - I don't know let's try
19:39 - purple I don't think I
19:46 - can style color green oh I didn't spell
19:50 - it right style color green there you go
19:53 - now it's green this will always override
19:56 - anything that has been passed
19:58 - up and above in here so element level
20:01 - style is considered more specific than
20:04 - something coming from a style sheet this
20:06 - is a really bad idea unless you're doing
20:08 - it dynamically with JavaScript on the
20:10 - fly as they're doing things the only way
20:13 - to really change an element Real Time
20:15 - with JavaScript is by adding things to
20:18 - the element itself but in general it's a
20:21 - really bad idea to add styling straight
20:23 - to a tag anyway that probably concludes
20:26 - for this lesson about all you need to
20:27 - know
20:28 - i' say go out there have fun Google
20:31 - stuff if you want to know how to make
20:33 - something say look italics I'm not going
20:35 - to tell you because one thing you have
20:36 - to learn as a web developer is to get
20:38 - really good at Googling just type CSS
20:41 - italics and you'll find it type CSS
20:43 - underline you'll find it type CSS pretty
20:46 - much anything and you'll find it online
20:48 - uh but this is enough to get you going
20:50 - hope it helps and have an excellent day

Cleaned transcript:

okay so on our last tutorial we started off uh with an introduction to bootstrap Twitter bootstrap I would highly encourage you to use bootstrap from now on start getting comfortable with it because you will write very few CSS rules and you'll be able to create very great stable stuff websites all over the world huge scale web sites are using Twitter bootstrap um and check the link if you did not catch that tutorial one thing you'll notice is this is not working yet that is because I accidentally forgot jQuery you'll notice I grabbed on bootstrap's website I grabbed these three things two CSS and one JavaScript uh but what I forgot is that bootstrap uses jQuery so if you scroll down to basic template you'll see that they include jQuery here so I'm going to copy that and put the jQuery script in my thing as well now you notice everything's working beautifully my drop down works so that's what it looks like on on a mobile and if you expand it out here's what it looks like on a regular website looks very nice and there we go so now I'm going to go ahead and move forward with a little bit more CSS stuff so back to basic CSS Maybe for One More lesson and then we'll move on and be done uh say we wanted to create one of these ourselves cuz even when you're using bootstrap every once in a while you've got to make something custom and it's really good to know some CSS moving forward so let's say I want to recreate one of these kind of widgets here let's say instead of calling it panel I'm going to call it my panel let's go div let's go header and we'll call it class body We'll add a single paragraph in here so right now completely unstyled seems to be normal let's go and open my main CSS I've already created three rules here my panel and heading so let's go ahead and give my panel a margin you can see I did a little bit of my homework beforehand 3% so that way it's always going to be within 3% of either Edge and let's give the heading a color this is some of this is going to be a little bit repeat for you so so give it we'll give it black for now just so we can see where we're sitting did I call it header yep called it header heading and one thing you'll notice is is I did my panel space heading one thing that people do accidentally all the time is they'll do my panel do heading and what that is going to look for is something that has the class my panel and the class heading this is the same as that because it's looking for something with both classes so you'll notice right now this selector is not selecting anything if I did my panel and added a class of heading now I've added two classes you'll notice it starts picking up on the entire panel now just in case you run into that and wonder what's going on and why your codee's not working you probably forgot a space there anytime you add a space it goes to the next level and is looking for a child of this guy so I obviously don't want black so let's look into kind of doing the a Color Picker to pick a color we want I'm just going to go to Google and I'm going to type in online Color Picker there we go there we go online Color Picker let's pick a color let's say a nice greenish sure that works I'm going to copy that and you'll notice it gave me the pound hex value so I'm going to do that paste it in hey we have kind of a normal looking color there that's kind of where you're going to do do a lot of your color picking from if you don't use Photoshop let's go ahead you'll notice this is snug up against the edges so I'm going to add some padding to this I'm noticing my padding here is a little bit less on the top and bottom and more on the left so I'm going to try maybe 10 pixels top bottom 20 pixels left right yep looks pretty good and then I'm noticing there's actually kind of a darker color for the text so I'm going to go back to my Color Picker I'm going to try to darken this guy up a little bit and see if that could be a good text color for me yeah looks kind of good a little bit lighter but no worries I'm also going to make the border that same color one pixel solid when you're defining borders you go with your width first first then your style and then your color I could go I Believe I Can Go dotted pretty much solid is what you're going to use all the time yeah there's dotted I think I can go dashed there's a bunch of them out there you'll need to search for them yeah dashed usually you're just going to use solid one pixel solid there you go that's looking nice and then I'm also going to add a border radius which is a different Rule and that's going to be the curved Corners let's try 10 pixels that's a little too much go five pixels border radius works like everything else I can give it five pixels five pixels 0 0 and that'll give me five pixels top bottom zero on the left and the right if I just kind of want that one corner I can go zero pixels you notice it'll Lop off this guy so I just kind of have that one corner right there um and I'll just go five pixels for all of them one thing you'll notice a lot of times too is you'll notice webkit border radius and what it is is older browsers used to not officially support this border radius tag because it's pretty new so these this is called a vendor prefix this is any browser using webkit which would be Chrome or Safari or pretty much any mobile phone older phones will need to add that Milla Firefox uses the mo VI pixels and so lots of times if you want to make it fully compliant with older browsers you'll do these things you'll do these three you go border radius webkit border radius Mo border radius um and then if you happen to be sporting older Opera oh border radius it's kind of annoying we're pretty much on the verge of being out of these things but it's still not a bad idea to add in the vendor prefixes for now I'll just keep them out just for cleanness you also notice I'm I'm trying to kind of keep it in alphabetical order here it's not a rule that you have to do that but it's a good idea keeps things clean uh one thing I'm noticing is I do not want a border radius on the bottom of my header so I'm going to go five picks zero actually I think I might need to go yep that is not going to do what I want it to do five pixels five pixels 0 0 so that way it's on the top and the bottom and I want this border to actually apply wh want this border to apply to the entire panel which is what's going on up here there we go that's looking a little better and I want this border radius you notice my this has a uh border radius but I want the panel to have a border radius as well there we go looking better now this has the Border radius you see if I take this off then it's square and then the Border below it is square and you'll get a couple weird little pixels there so I'm keeping the Border radius on both of them let's move on to the body if I can type my panel body let's give it padding let's try the same 10 pixels 20 pixels there you go looking good and I actually want this to have a 5 pixel border radius everywhere there we go we basically created this panel uh let's look into a couple other things you know what I'm noticing is it looks like there might be an Ever So slight Shadow on these panels so I'm going to go ahead and add this it's called box Shadow and box Shadow has four values it has your offset uh your X offset y offset your blur and then your color it's kind of how that works is let's start with a 10 pix pix 10 pixel Z pixel blur and just black to make it clear what's going on you'll notice it's 10 pixels this way 10 pixels down and it's not blurred at all and it's black so if I make this blur 10 pixels you notice it's starts getting fuzzy now and so with these guys it looks like they don't have any offset at all this it's kind of like just a allinclusive Shadow this is probably a lot smaller like four pixels and this is not black it's it's a very light color maybe like a 999 yeah you can barely see it now looks like that might be maybe even lighter CCC is a lighter color I have a few of these colors memorized there you go so it's got that ever so slight gray shadow that these other ones seem to have so that's kind of how we're going to do a box Shadow on this entire panel let's say we wanted to give this I'm going to copy and paste this a few times let's say we wanted to create three of these and whenever we hovered over one we wanted a delete button to appear what I'm going to do here is I'm going to add a div and this class will be show on Hover and then in here I'm going to add a bootstrap button think it's button danger is a red one delete there we go so that's there it'll always be there for now let me go and add that to my other two yeah it's actually a little big I want it to be button XS button extra small there you go let's go and add this to each one of these so now they each have a delete button and I'm going to go uh I'll make it show whenever you hover over my panel so here's how I'm going to do that my panel show on Hover is going to be display none so they are not going to appear at all and then what I'm going to do is my panel hover so now these rules will only apply whenever you're hovering over my panel my panel show on Hover display back to inline block which is what it was before so now whenever I hover over a panel that appears nice so now it feels like your page is doing some really smart stuff really all we're doing is we're hiding it and we're showing it whenever you hover over this panel at all H kind of nifty you know what else I could do is I could go my panel hover I could make this box Shadow get a little bigger when you hover over it this kind of just some ideas of things that you can do maybe I'll make it like eight pixels and I will make it a more apparent Shadow there you go now whenever you hover over it see that shadow is just a little bit more to show you what I mean I'll make it full black a little too much for design sake but whenever you hover over it kind of gives it a little pop now I could even make the Border a little bit larger maybe like a two pixel border there you go now it really kind of has some pop whenever you hover over it see it jumps a little bit because the Border has now made it a few pixels larger now it's got an extra pixel on top because that borders two pixels extra pixel on the bottom so you notice it kind of the guys below it do this little jump down thing so ideally I'd probably adjust some margins there on this hover thing so let me see maybe that'd be 1% 3% see if I can compensate for that oh you know what is that delete button showing up okay so that's automatically going to be larger that's supposed to be happening that's what's going on there we'll leave it so that's kind of a little bit more intermediate CSS and before I wrap up this lesson um I'll get into kind of a few more selectors and I'll talk a little bit about specificity and cascading stuff so let's go and just clear all this out save that let me clear all this out and I'm just you know I'll just create a complete Blank Slate here before I wrap up this lesson on CSS I'm going to go and create an H1 hello world so I'm going to in my stylesheet I'm going to go H1 color red now H1s are going to be red H1s should be red not exactly sure what's going on there oh probably because bootstrap has an H1 let's make it a class H1 bootstrap has a whole bunch of rules in it and so that's where all my colors are coming from from bootstrap already oh no what's going on here let's just make it a paragraph one of the things you run into sometimes with using something like bootstrap is it's doing a whole bunch of stuff and you don't exactly know what it's doing and so sometimes you can get frustrated trying to do things so definitely there's some downsides let me make it really large 400% okay there we go kind of ran into an is issue that I'm actually going to demonstrate here so now paragraphs have a color of red anything that comes after will overwrite if it's the same level of specificity so if it's as specific so I'm going to go color blue now you'll notice even though I've defined a color red P's will have color blue because it came after the fact now if I went P class um primary and this had a class of primary now it became righted again because this is a more specific rule than this this just applies to paragraphs this applies to paragraphs with a class of primary now if I went P ID of main green so now if I have an ID on here ID just got even more specific and now it's green so you'll see that that's kind of even though they came before IDs are more specific than uh classes and classes are more specific than just elements and so that's kind of how that works you notice even if I take away the P an ID is more specific than both of these however if I go primary matching by ID or matching by tag name and by class name is considered more specific than matching by class name so this sets it to Green this overwrites it to red and then this doesn't do anything this makes it all paragraph tags are now would be blue for any just standard paragraph tags so that's kind of how specificity works is if I were to also go primary other if this said p. primary is red I'll do it like this p. primary is red p. primary. other is green now so if I make it class primary and other well now that's considered even more specific it matches on three levels it matches on a tag level on a class level and on a secondary class level or an additional class level so this is now the most specific rule that applies to my paragraph tag here so it will be green so that's kind of how that goes if you're including it all in a stylesheet now let's look into doing something else let me copy main CSS and let me save this as other CSS and I'm going to include other CSS after main CSS here other main CSS other CSS so now we have two things we're including in let's make main CSS just have PS be a color of blue let's have other CSS beps with a color of red now my paragraph is red kind of what happens is is it goes main loads up all the main rules and then loads up all the other rules and it's no different than if they were stacked on top of each other so main color blue then it loads in other color red that's no different than if you did this blue red what we've done is we've split them up into separate style sheets which sometimes makes sense if you start getting a really big style sheet makes a lot of sense to split them up into groupings so it's a lot easier to find out where your file where your rules go let's move on and so now let's add a style here this is a page level stylesheet I'm just adding a style tag straight in here I'm going to go P color green now paragraphs have a color of green you'll notice if I put this before my link the paragraphs now have a color of red because this happens before loads up these Styles then it goes to here then it goes to here so they get overwritten by what's here on the page um page page level stylesheet not really that great of an idea I wouldn't recommend doing it because then you have to copy and paste rules all over the place another third way you can do it is you can actually add inline style here on any tag can I do pink I think I can do pink I don't know let's try purple I don't think I can style color green oh I didn't spell it right style color green there you go now it's green this will always override anything that has been passed up and above in here so element level style is considered more specific than something coming from a style sheet this is a really bad idea unless you're doing it dynamically with JavaScript on the fly as they're doing things the only way to really change an element Real Time with JavaScript is by adding things to the element itself but in general it's a really bad idea to add styling straight to a tag anyway that probably concludes for this lesson about all you need to know i' say go out there have fun Google stuff if you want to know how to make something say look italics I'm not going to tell you because one thing you have to learn as a web developer is to get really good at Googling just type CSS italics and you'll find it type CSS underline you'll find it type CSS pretty much anything and you'll find it online uh but this is enough to get you going hope it helps and have an excellent day
