00:00 - hey there so I'm doing the first kind of
00:03 - informational video that I've ever done
00:06 - uh as a response to getting a lot of
00:08 - questions probably 50 people have asked
00:10 - me just in the last 30 days this
00:13 - question and the question is how do I go
00:15 - to get a job in the web development
00:17 - industry I'm on the learning process how
00:18 - do I know when it's time to look what
00:21 - does that process look like who's going
00:22 - to hire me how just tell me about that
00:25 - world and so this video is going to kind
00:27 - of dive into that world for those of you
00:29 - guys who are on the learning curve or
00:30 - look into now or eventually jump into
00:32 - the web development industry and a
00:34 - career in that which by the way great
00:36 - industry great career I cannot say
00:38 - enough good things about it so let's get
00:40 - into it there's been several times along
00:43 - uh over the years where I've had to
00:45 - interview people for the company that
00:46 - I'm looking for I was either uh a key
00:49 - role in hiring that next person or I was
00:51 - just among the
00:53 - interviewers um and so I'll kind of talk
00:55 - from the employer perspective so you can
00:57 - kind of see where the employers are are
00:59 - going for cuz if you're a good fit for
01:01 - the employer then you're ready to get a
01:02 - job so as an employer I'm looking for a
01:06 - resume cuz that's what I'm going to get
01:08 - and and I'm looking for indicators on
01:10 - this resume and as the and with the
01:12 - person when I sit down to meet with them
01:14 - uh the first thing I'm going to be
01:16 - asking is is this person on the playing
01:18 - field that I'm on um they don't have to
01:21 - know everything I know they don't have
01:22 - to be able to do what the good people on
01:24 - the team can do but they've got to at
01:25 - least be able to be on the playing field
01:27 - uh so the indicators of that are one
01:29 - what tech Technologies do you use
01:31 - everyone uses HTML CSS so that's kind of
01:35 - a prerequisite to getting into web
01:36 - development you've got to know the
01:38 - languages the web is built on so you
01:41 - know HTML CSS how can you show me that
01:43 - you have a modern usable skill set take
01:46 - a day and learn how to use SAS and how
01:48 - to compile SAS um or less for CSS these
01:52 - are going to happen really fast and easy
01:55 - um but when I see that on there I know
01:56 - you're not just some HTML CSS coder oh
01:59 - SAS and L and stylist okay this is good
02:02 - this means that you learn you know new
02:04 - stuff um another very common thing
02:07 - you're going to see HTML CSS jQuery tons
02:10 - of jobs that say those three things as
02:14 - pretty much what they're looking for uh
02:16 - contrary to popular belief there are
02:17 - lots of employers looking for people who
02:20 - can do basic HTML CSS and jQuery uh
02:24 - because they have a lot of high-end devs
02:25 - to do all the complicated stuff but they
02:27 - need people to push through the content
02:29 - they need to be able to say here's a
02:32 - Photoshop PSD file I need you to be able
02:35 - to you know slice an image out of it and
02:38 - then do the rest in HTML CSS so
02:41 - Photoshop slicing HTML CSS and know some
02:44 - basic jQuery uh to do a little bit of
02:47 - custom functionality on your page um
02:50 - I'll get back to jQuery in a second on
02:52 - what that means and how good at jQuery
02:54 - need to be um another key indicator if I
02:57 - see GitHub on there okay good this
02:58 - person takes code
03:00 - seriously um designers don't really care
03:03 - about GitHub coders live on GitHub so
03:07 - create your own GitHub repository do
03:10 - some pull requests get comfortable with
03:12 - it if you know how to put a repo on
03:15 - GitHub how to make branches and do pull
03:18 - requests there's some videos I have on
03:20 - that I'll put them in the description uh
03:22 - you're good to go with that another
03:24 - thing is is create your GitHub account
03:26 - and put your own work on GitHub so they
03:28 - can actually see that you use GitHub
03:31 - repositories for your own work okay
03:33 - another big plus they actively use
03:36 - GitHub day in and day out huge indicator
03:39 - um some indicators that don't have to do
03:41 - with skill is uh but are still key
03:43 - indicators is what text editor do you
03:45 - use do you use Sublime Text because that
03:48 - goes a long way because every series
03:49 - coder I know right now uh I'd say at
03:52 - least 80% of them use Sublime Text that
03:55 - doesn't mean that the coders that don't
03:56 - use it are bad coders it just bad coders
04:00 - or or should I say newbies often times
04:03 - don't use professional level tools yet
04:06 - if you can show you use professional
04:07 - level tools uh that's going to get you
04:10 - off off the mindset of oh he's a newbie
04:12 - and doesn't know what he's doing other
04:14 - things what operating system do you use
04:17 - Windows is fine you can totally do web
04:19 - development on Windows and do a great
04:21 - job at it but most web developers are
04:24 - going to use Mac OS or they're going to
04:26 - use Linux uh so if you have a Windows
04:29 - machine cons consider installing for
04:31 - free it's free and you can install it
04:33 - alongside of Windows auntu Linux so you
04:35 - can boot up to either one um if you see
04:38 - Linux on a uh if I see Linux on a resume
04:42 - I'm I'm I'm not going to think newbie
04:44 - here because development newbies just
04:46 - don't use Linux they they usually have
04:48 - their Windows computer maybe a Mac
04:50 - computer which is cool but if I see
04:52 - Linux on there I'm going to be like okay
04:54 - this is this is a person that that takes
04:56 - what they do seriously and they really
04:58 - want to learn professional ways of doing
05:01 - things and Sublime Text and all that
05:02 - they all run on Linux anyway the
05:04 - terminal it's all the same Linux and Mac
05:07 - OS are very very similar um in the way
05:09 - you would develop on them so that's kind
05:12 - of some key indicators I'm looking for
05:13 - resume wise let me go back to jQuery um
05:16 - how do you know when you know enough
05:18 - jQuery because jQuery you can learn
05:20 - you're going to be learning it for like
05:21 - five years uh the first thing I'd want
05:23 - to learn is Dom traversal you're good
05:25 - with selectors you can if I give you an
05:28 - unordered list with liis in it can you
05:31 - find Li number three and then can you do
05:33 - something to all the liis that are
05:36 - siblings of Li number three if if you
05:39 - someone clicks on Li number three can
05:41 - you find the panel that that is a part
05:44 - of you know can you navigate the Dom
05:46 - decently well in jQuery um I'm actually
05:48 - building a full
05:50 - jQuery course on that with about 12
05:53 - lessons that'll cover all these issues
05:55 - and and if you know the stuff in the
05:56 - course you should be good with jQuery
05:58 - that'll be in the description if if I
05:59 - have that at the time you're watching
06:01 - this video but if you're watching this
06:03 - video the day it came out I don't have
06:04 - that quite yet but it's coming you're
06:07 - going to want to know how to do J career
06:08 - user events so when the user clicks on
06:10 - this mouses over this you can fire off
06:12 - Smart JavaScript things um you're going
06:15 - to want to know jQuery ajax somewhat
06:17 - you're going to need to know how to do
06:20 - get requests with jQuery ajax get say a
06:23 - list of tweets um and put them into your
06:27 - website you know through AJ so you'll
06:30 - need to know jQuery ajax that's probably
06:31 - going to be the last part of your
06:33 - learning experience um with jQuery and
06:36 - then you need to know how to use jQuery
06:38 - plugins you need to know how to grab a
06:41 - woo slider or Flex slider and put it on
06:44 - your page and make a slider out of it
06:45 - which is really easy uh the first time
06:48 - might be daunting but there's
06:49 - instructions for all these plugins on
06:51 - all their sites uh and that's what makes
06:53 - jQuery great is there's plugins for all
06:55 - this stuff you need to be able to grab a
06:57 - panel plugin and
07:00 - be able to make a tab panel by
07:02 - configuring that plugin and so if you
07:04 - can do that you're pretty much good with
07:07 - jQuery you don't have to know how to
07:08 - build your own plugins that's a plus if
07:11 - you've built your own plugin uh but you
07:13 - definitely don't know how to do that and
07:16 - that's pretty much if you know HTML CSS
07:19 - and you're solid with jQuery uh you'll
07:21 - have competition and getting that first
07:24 - job might be difficult but that's the
07:25 - base skill set you need to get into the
07:28 - industry um what also have you done is a
07:32 - is the next huge thing I'm going to look
07:34 - for if you don't have job experience you
07:37 - can create your own job experience by
07:41 - building sites for other people one
07:43 - thing I did when I was starting out I
07:44 - was 18 at the time so I've been doing
07:46 - this a long time uh but I I did free
07:49 - sites for nonprofits that I supported
07:51 - like Foster or adoption agencies or my
07:54 - church um which most likely they have a
07:56 - a site that's 10 years old and terrible
07:59 - anyway so anything you can do just
08:01 - converting it to bootstrap will be a
08:03 - massive Improvement um and they will
08:06 - love love love love love you for that um
08:08 - and then you can actually on your resume
08:10 - say volunteer lead developer 4 or lead
08:14 - developer 4 and they can say as a
08:16 - volunteer capacity you know kind of hide
08:17 - it in there somewhere and so by the time
08:20 - it's time to look for a job you've got
08:22 - history um you can put on your resume
08:24 - that you have job history that you're
08:26 - not a newbie in this you've done it and
08:28 - I can even show you my GitHub
08:29 - repositories for these sites so you can
08:31 - see that I actually coded them myself um
08:34 - the last thing would be possibly learn
08:36 - learn WordPress learn how to make
08:38 - WordPress sites uh you don't have to do
08:41 - this but a lot of agencies and smaller
08:43 - design shops crank out WordPress sites
08:46 - day in and day out and if you know how
08:48 - to crank out a fast WordPress site buy a
08:51 - template off of theme
08:53 - forest.com pop it into your WordPress
08:55 - you know pop it into WordPress and and
08:57 - hack it there are a lot of people
09:00 - looking for people with that skill set
09:02 - it might be a good first step into the
09:04 - industry um so that's pretty much the
09:08 - whole skill set if you if you say yes to
09:10 - all those questions hands down you can
09:12 - get a decent job in the industry hands
09:15 - down it'll be paying a a a decent salary
09:19 - um and as you grow in those you can get
09:21 - a really good salary in webd right now
09:23 - it may change in the next 20 years but
09:25 - for right now if you're good it's going
09:28 - to be a good job um and so how do you
09:32 - actually go about finding the employer
09:34 - will be the last thing I mentioned in
09:35 - this video how do you actually find
09:37 - those employers um the the first tip for
09:41 - sure is put your resume online uh this
09:44 - is a recruiter driven industry so there
09:46 - are thousands of people out there whose
09:48 - full-time job is to find people like you
09:51 - even if you're new and place you in a
09:53 - job their job is to find you and then
09:55 - find a job for you and so uh get your
09:59 - res online some of the ways you do that
10:00 - is you apply for jobs on Monster and if
10:03 - they still do this you can check that
10:05 - you want to make your resume available
10:07 - you can probably also post your resume
10:08 - on monster big big big big point though
10:11 - do not put your cell phone number on
10:14 - your resume if you're posting it online
10:16 - because that cell phone will ring from
10:18 - recruiters for the next 10 years after
10:19 - you found the great job you will still
10:22 - get phone calls that there's an
10:23 - excellent job for you um leave your
10:26 - phone number off it's a good idea to
10:28 - actually create a professional email
10:30 - account that this is this is your public
10:33 - web developer email account cuz you will
10:36 - get daily emails for the rest of your
10:38 - life as a web developer you don't get a
10:40 - ton but you just you know you just want
10:42 - to be aware of that it's it's the great
10:44 - thing about this industry but there's
10:46 - minor drawbacks you want to stay off the
10:48 - radar in some ways um and so lots of job
10:52 - postings
10:54 - indeed.com has job postings monster
10:56 - Career Builder uh you can look Craigs
10:59 - list generally people using Craigslist
11:01 - are not going to use recruiters which
11:03 - means they're not going to be looking to
11:04 - pay top dollar for someone in the field
11:06 - so odds of you finding a great job on
11:08 - Craigslist are a lot less if you're
11:10 - starting off and you're just looking for
11:12 - part-time work work on the side to build
11:15 - your portfolio Craigslist will be a
11:17 - great place to find that kind of work uh
11:20 - and so that's kind of it but generally
11:22 - speaking I would look for
11:23 - companies that are using recruiters cuz
11:26 - those are going to be more serious
11:27 - companies uh those are going to the
11:29 - companies that don't have the time a day
11:31 - to go looking for 5,000 people they're
11:33 - like look I'm just going to pay the
11:34 - recruiter $10,000 to find me a great
11:37 - candidate because I'm going to spend way
11:38 - more than $10,000 finding those
11:40 - candidates myself these are good
11:42 - indicators that you're looking for a
11:43 - good company here so um that pretty much
11:47 - wraps up my intro thoughts if you had
11:49 - asked me out to coffee and said hey tell
11:50 - me what you think about this industry
11:53 - that would be pretty much what I'd give
11:55 - you so hopefully that's helpful feel
11:57 - free to comment if you have any question
11:59 - questions and I'll definitely do my best
12:01 - to answer any questions you guys have
12:03 - and hope this was a help to you guys
12:05 - have a good one

Cleaned transcript:

hey there so I'm doing the first kind of informational video that I've ever done uh as a response to getting a lot of questions probably 50 people have asked me just in the last 30 days this question and the question is how do I go to get a job in the web development industry I'm on the learning process how do I know when it's time to look what does that process look like who's going to hire me how just tell me about that world and so this video is going to kind of dive into that world for those of you guys who are on the learning curve or look into now or eventually jump into the web development industry and a career in that which by the way great industry great career I cannot say enough good things about it so let's get into it there's been several times along uh over the years where I've had to interview people for the company that I'm looking for I was either uh a key role in hiring that next person or I was just among the interviewers um and so I'll kind of talk from the employer perspective so you can kind of see where the employers are are going for cuz if you're a good fit for the employer then you're ready to get a job so as an employer I'm looking for a resume cuz that's what I'm going to get and and I'm looking for indicators on this resume and as the and with the person when I sit down to meet with them uh the first thing I'm going to be asking is is this person on the playing field that I'm on um they don't have to know everything I know they don't have to be able to do what the good people on the team can do but they've got to at least be able to be on the playing field uh so the indicators of that are one what tech Technologies do you use everyone uses HTML CSS so that's kind of a prerequisite to getting into web development you've got to know the languages the web is built on so you know HTML CSS how can you show me that you have a modern usable skill set take a day and learn how to use SAS and how to compile SAS um or less for CSS these are going to happen really fast and easy um but when I see that on there I know you're not just some HTML CSS coder oh SAS and L and stylist okay this is good this means that you learn you know new stuff um another very common thing you're going to see HTML CSS jQuery tons of jobs that say those three things as pretty much what they're looking for uh contrary to popular belief there are lots of employers looking for people who can do basic HTML CSS and jQuery uh because they have a lot of highend devs to do all the complicated stuff but they need people to push through the content they need to be able to say here's a Photoshop PSD file I need you to be able to you know slice an image out of it and then do the rest in HTML CSS so Photoshop slicing HTML CSS and know some basic jQuery uh to do a little bit of custom functionality on your page um I'll get back to jQuery in a second on what that means and how good at jQuery need to be um another key indicator if I see GitHub on there okay good this person takes code seriously um designers don't really care about GitHub coders live on GitHub so create your own GitHub repository do some pull requests get comfortable with it if you know how to put a repo on GitHub how to make branches and do pull requests there's some videos I have on that I'll put them in the description uh you're good to go with that another thing is is create your GitHub account and put your own work on GitHub so they can actually see that you use GitHub repositories for your own work okay another big plus they actively use GitHub day in and day out huge indicator um some indicators that don't have to do with skill is uh but are still key indicators is what text editor do you use do you use Sublime Text because that goes a long way because every series coder I know right now uh I'd say at least 80% of them use Sublime Text that doesn't mean that the coders that don't use it are bad coders it just bad coders or or should I say newbies often times don't use professional level tools yet if you can show you use professional level tools uh that's going to get you off off the mindset of oh he's a newbie and doesn't know what he's doing other things what operating system do you use Windows is fine you can totally do web development on Windows and do a great job at it but most web developers are going to use Mac OS or they're going to use

cool but if I see Linux on there I'm going to be like okay this is this is a person that that takes what they do seriously and they really want to learn professional ways of doing things and Sublime

can get a decent job in the industry hands down it'll be paying a a a decent salary um and as you grow in those you can get a really good salary in webd right now it may change in the next 20 years but for right now if you're good it's going to be a good job um and so how do you actually go about finding the employer will be the last thing I mentioned in this video how do you actually find those

leave your phone number off it's a good idea to actually create a professional email account that this is this is your public web developer email account cuz you will get daily emails for the rest of your life as a web developer you don't get a ton but you just you know you just want to be aware of that it's it's the great thing about this industry but there's minor drawbacks you want to stay off the radar in some ways um and so lots of job postings indeed.com has job postings monster Career Builder uh you can look Craigs list generally people using Craigslist are not going to use recruiters which means they're not going to be looking to pay top dollar for someone in the field so odds of you finding a great job on Craigslist are a lot less if you're starting off and you're just looking for parttime work work on the side to build your portfolio Craigslist will be a great place to find that kind of work uh and so that's kind of it but generally speaking I would look for companies that are using recruiters cuz those are going to be more serious companies uh those are going to the companies that don't have the time a day to go looking for 5,000 people they're like look I'm just going to pay the recruiter $10,000 to find me a great candidate because I'm going to spend way more than $10,000 finding those candidates myself these are good indicators that you're looking for a good company here so um that pretty much wraps up my intro thoughts if you had asked me out to coffee and said hey tell me what you think about this industry that would be pretty much what I'd give you so hopefully that's helpful feel free to comment if you have any question questions and I'll definitely do my best to answer any questions you guys have and hope this was a help to you guys have a good one
