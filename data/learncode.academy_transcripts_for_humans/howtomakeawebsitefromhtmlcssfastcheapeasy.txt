00:00 - hey everybody this is going to be an
00:01 - upgrade to my one of my most popular
00:03 - videos of all time it has over 500 000
00:06 - views
00:07 - and it's the question i get asked
00:09 - absolutely the most by new beginners and
00:11 - that is hey i just finished this sweet
00:13 - new website how do i make it an actual
00:15 - website i've got my html and css files
00:18 - and stuff but i actually want to turn it
00:20 - into
00:21 - myawesomesite.com how do i do that is
00:23 - there cost associated with that and what
00:25 - is the easiest fastest cheapest best
00:28 - path for me
00:29 - so the short answer is there is no one
00:31 - answer to it there's a lot of different
00:33 - ways that you can do it
00:34 - and as your skill level grows you may
00:36 - actually choose some different methods
00:38 - like as you learn github and as you
00:40 - learn other things there's there's a
00:42 - variety of methods out there but if
00:44 - you're starting off and you're an html
00:46 - css developer the absolute easiest way
00:48 - to go is to get a shared hosting server
00:51 - by a domain name through a separate
00:53 - domain name registrar so that way
00:55 - instead of
00:56 - 127.0.0.1 you have myawesomedomain.com
01:00 - and then you're going to get a web
01:01 - server a web hosting plan the web server
01:04 - is a computer that lives on the internet
01:06 - that's constantly online and you're
01:07 - going to put your html and css files on
01:10 - that server and they're going to point
01:12 - your domain name to that server and then
01:15 - ta-da you have a website and if you ever
01:17 - want to move the server somewhere else
01:19 - you have your domain separate you can
01:21 - set up a different server and point your
01:22 - domain to the new server that's why it's
01:24 - very important to keep them separate it
01:25 - makes that a lot simpler so we're going
01:27 - to go through that on this video we're
01:28 - going to try to do it in record time get
01:30 - all the steps so you can actually see me
01:32 - by an actual domain by an actual hosting
01:34 - plan and then connect the two and you
01:37 - are done i'll also mention that i have
01:39 - links to these two places i'm going to
01:41 - recommend in the description if you use
01:43 - those links you will support this
01:44 - channel um so they are affiliate links
01:46 - uh however it very important for me to
01:48 - mention that i will never ever ever
01:50 - recommend something that i don't fully
01:52 - believe is the best solution for the
01:54 - developers i'm recommending it to so i
01:56 - would never ever give a false
01:58 - recommendation in order to
02:00 - get support for the channel or anything
02:01 - like that
02:02 - so i'm on iwantmyname.com this is my
02:04 - favorite place this is where i keep my
02:06 - domains my absolute favorite place for
02:08 - domains to live it's super easy they
02:10 - give you domain privacy for free which
02:12 - is my favorite thing about them
02:14 - and uh so yeah you just start off by
02:16 - searching for a domain let's say
02:18 - myawesomewebsite.com
02:22 - nope not dot zom
02:23 - howabout.com
02:27 - there you go myawesomewebsite.com is
02:30 - available let's buy this thing
02:32 - wait nope it's taken my awesome
02:36 - awesomenewwebsite.com see if you got
02:38 - that one
02:39 - the internet's got that one available
02:40 - for me let's buy it let's go ahead check
02:42 - out my
02:44 - awesomenewwebsite.com you can see that
02:45 - it's going to cost 14 i'll go back real
02:48 - quick
02:48 - some of these newer domains might be as
02:50 - expensive as seventy or a hundred
02:52 - dollars so the dot coms are the cheapest
02:55 - but they're the hardest to get exactly
02:56 - what you want as well i can also say
02:58 - that dot coms tend to do a little bit
03:00 - better in search engine optimization so
03:02 - that is something to think about so i'm
03:04 - going to go ahead and check out and then
03:05 - i'll enter my credit card address and go
03:07 - through all this i'll skip that for you
03:09 - i'll see you at the next step okay boom
03:11 - i filled out all my credit card
03:12 - information i bought my
03:14 - awesomenewwebsite.com you can see i'm on
03:15 - my dashboard i can go ahead click on
03:17 - that and the most important thing that i
03:19 - can do is i can change my name servers
03:21 - down here now i have to buy web hosting
03:23 - first i'm going to get some web hosting
03:25 - and then i'm going to point these name
03:27 - servers to the web hosting also you can
03:29 - see that i got privacy enabled by
03:31 - default which means that
03:32 - you people cannot look up the website
03:35 - and get my home address which is what
03:37 - you get if you don't have domain privacy
03:40 - turned on so let's go over here to
03:42 - shared hosting plans on hostgator.com
03:44 - again link is in the description
03:47 - and you can either buy it for a single
03:48 - domain or unlimited domains uh and then
03:51 - ssl certificate comes baked in on all of
03:54 - them that means the https which with the
03:56 - lock which is good
03:58 - if you do want to do unlimited domains
03:59 - multiple domains maybe you're going to
04:01 - be building several websites for several
04:03 - people uh like another dollar or two a
04:05 - month and you can get this one instead
04:07 - that's definitely a good move uh so
04:09 - let's go and buy this one though because
04:11 - we just have our one domain and say hey
04:13 - i already own this domain
04:15 - of myawesomewebsite.com
04:19 - myawesomenewwebsite.com so i don't need
04:20 - to purchase that
04:22 - and then i'm going to go ahead and fill
04:23 - out some username and security pin
04:25 - information but let's come down here
04:26 - first and see you can see that the the
04:29 - bigger you go the more discount they're
04:31 - going to give you obviously that makes
04:32 - sense there's a few coupon codes that
04:34 - you can always use
04:36 - you can use let's make a deal
04:40 - that's a coupon code that they give me
04:41 - because i recommend so many people over
04:43 - to them at this point um
04:45 - and that's going to give you a really
04:46 - good discount you can see that if we go
04:48 - over to i don't know just say 12 months
04:52 - then that gives us 35 off you can see
04:55 - that the coupon code is reflected here
04:56 - up to 40 percent off so that's a really
04:58 - good coupon code um other coupon codes
05:01 - that they always have out there is drop
05:03 - 10 bucks
05:04 - and drop 25 perks so drop 25 those kind
05:09 - of always work at any point in time as
05:11 - well but i think let's make a deal is
05:13 - kind of the best coupon code that i've
05:15 - found for them
05:16 - the other thing you're going to make
05:17 - sure you do is turn off all this stuff
05:19 - because they're going to want to
05:21 - upsell you on all these other things
05:23 - that you may or may not need
05:25 - if you're not good at backing up your
05:27 - code you might want to pay the two
05:28 - dollars a month for that if you want
05:30 - gmail to power your email addresses
05:34 - then five dollars a month is what gmail
05:36 - charges so
05:37 - you can get your address at
05:39 - yourdomain.com but it's all through
05:41 - gmail that's what i do personally that's
05:43 - a great way to do it but that is five
05:45 - dollars a month as well so there are
05:46 - some extra things you can buy but you
05:48 - don't really need them i'm gonna go
05:50 - ahead and buy this hosting here and
05:52 - we'll see at the next step hey so check
05:54 - this out i've got all my credit card
05:56 - information added and because i'm going
05:58 - to delete this account after i make it
06:00 - i just got the one month and i did the
06:02 - drop 10 bucks i get to buy this for .01
06:05 - cents now that's probably not the route
06:07 - you want to go if you want to have your
06:08 - website around for a little while you're
06:09 - going to want to buy more than one month
06:11 - and the let's make a deal coupon code is
06:13 - probably going to be a better deal for
06:14 - you overall because after this it goes
06:17 - up to like the full
06:18 - eight or ten dollar monthly plan
06:21 - uh but one of the things i actually
06:22 - really do like about hostgator is
06:24 - they're one of the only places that lets
06:25 - you do a month-to-month shared hosting
06:27 - plan lots of places make you do a
06:29 - minimum of three months so i figured i'd
06:31 - point that out pretty cool that you
06:32 - can't actually get started for one penny
06:35 - okay there you go i now have a web host
06:38 - and again the web host is where we're
06:39 - going to put our html and our css files
06:41 - and they're going to always be online
06:42 - and we are going to point our domain
06:44 - name to the web host as well so you can
06:46 - see i've got a hosting package here
06:47 - let's go ahead and click over on the
06:48 - hosting tab and i can find out the
06:50 - details that i need to send my domain
06:52 - name over i'm going to click on manage
06:55 - here
06:56 - and it's going to take just a second to
06:57 - load and then i can find what are called
06:59 - my name servers my name servers are what
07:02 - i need to plug in here let's go update
07:04 - name servers
07:06 - on iwantmyname.com
07:09 - and let's go to settings here
07:12 - and there we go we have our name servers
07:14 - i only have two name servers which is
07:16 - more common than four
07:18 - so name server one
07:22 - name server two
07:24 - and then i just get rid of all the
07:26 - others you can see they only require two
07:28 - lots of places only have two and now our
07:30 - domain name is pointed to our dashboard
07:33 - so all we want to do now is let's go
07:35 - back to overview
07:37 - and let's go to file manager and upload
07:39 - our files and then we are going to be
07:41 - done so when i click on our file manager
07:43 - here you can see that we've got this
07:45 - folder structure this is our actual
07:47 - server we're kind of connected to that
07:49 - this www is a folder so i can double
07:51 - click on that i've got this
07:53 - default.html i'm going to go ahead and
07:55 - i'm going to right click and hit delete
07:58 - so now let's upload my own stuff let's
07:59 - click upload here
08:01 - and select some files from my desktop
08:03 - i've got my websites and index in a
08:06 - styles.css
08:10 - let's add index
08:12 - let's add style css
08:14 - they're both uploaded let's go back here
08:16 - and see if we can find them
08:18 - tada they're there and now let's try
08:21 - going to my awesome
08:23 - new
08:24 - website dot
08:25 - took me a long time to type that out and
08:28 - tada you can see that i actually have a
08:30 - website myawesomenewwebsite.com
08:34 - it is uploaded it is online it is
08:36 - finished it's it's really that easy get
08:39 - a domain name
08:40 - get hosting and hostgator obviously and
08:43 - i want my name do make it very easy
08:45 - other places like godaddy make this
08:47 - process much more frustrating there are
08:49 - a lot of hosts that make this process a
08:52 - lot more detailed in the steps that you
08:54 - have to take uh which is why i like
08:57 - these two companies they make it very
08:58 - very simple very fast it all happens
09:01 - real time
09:02 - um and so in just a few minutes i've got
09:04 - a website up uh i've got my files on it

hey everybody this is going to be an upgrade to my one of my most popular videos of all time it has over 500 000 views and it's the question i get asked absolutely the most by new beginners and that is hey i just finished this sweet new website how do i make it an actual website i've got my html and css files and stuff but i actually want to turn it into myawesomesite.com how do i do that is there cost associated with that and what is the easiest fastest cheapest best path for me so the short answer is there is no one answer to it there's a lot of different ways that you can do it and as your skill level grows you may actually choose some different methods like as you learn github and as you learn other things there's there's a variety of methods out there but if you're starting off

this video we're going to try to do it in record time get all the steps so you can actually see me by an actual domain by an actual hosting plan and then connect the two and you are done i'll also mention that i have links to these two places i'm going to recommend in the description if you use those links you will support this channel um so they are affiliate links uh however it very important for me to mention that i will never ever ever recommend something that i don't fully believe is the best solution for the developers i'm recommending it to so i would never ever give a false recommendation in order to get support for the channel or anything like that so i'm on iwantmyname.com this is my favorite place this is where i keep my domains my absolute favorite place for domains to live it's super easy they give you domain privacy for free which is my favorite thing about them and uh so yeah you just start off by searching for a domain let's say myawesomewebsite.com nope not dot zom howabout.com there you go myawesomewebsite.com is available let's buy this thing wait nope it's taken my awesome awesomenewwebsite.com see if you got that one the internet's got that one available for me let's buy it let's go ahead check out my awesomenewwebsite.com you can see that it's going to cost 14 i'll go back real quick some of these newer domains might be as expensive as seventy or a hundred dollars so the dot coms are the cheapest but they're the hardest to get exactly what you want as well i can also say that dot coms tend to do a little bit better in search engine

that i got privacy enabled by default which means that you people cannot look up the website and get my home address which is what you get if you don't have domain privacy turned on so let's go over here to shared hosting plans on hostgator.com again link is in the description and you can either buy it for a single domain or unlimited domains uh and then ssl certificate comes baked in on all of them that means the https which with the lock which is good if you do want to do unlimited domains multiple domains maybe you're going to be building several websites for several people uh like

always have out there is drop 10 bucks and drop 25 perks so drop 25 those kind of always work at any point in time as well but i think let's make a deal is kind of the best coupon code that i've found for them the other thing you're going to make sure you do is turn off all this stuff because they're going to want to upsell you on all these other things that you may or may not need if you're not good at backing up your code you might want to pay the two dollars a month for that if you want gmail to power your email addresses then five dollars a month is what gmail charges so you can get your address at yourdomain.com but it's all through gmail that's what i do personally that's a great way to do it but that is five dollars a month as well so there are some extra things you can buy but you don't really need them i'm gonna go ahead and buy this hosting here and we'll see at the next step hey so check this out i've got all my credit card information added and because i'm going to delete this account after i make it i just got the one month and i did the drop 10 bucks i get to buy this for .01 cents now that's probably not the route you want to go if you want to have your website around for a little while you're going to want to buy more than one month and the let's make a deal coupon code is probably going to be a better deal for you overall because after this it goes up to like the full eight or ten dollar monthly plan uh but one of the things i actually really do like about hostgator is they're one of the only places that lets you do a monthtomonth shared hosting plan lots of places make you do a minimum of three months so i figured i'd point that out pretty cool that you can't actually get started for one penny okay there you go i now have a web host and again the web host is where we're going to put our html and our css files and they're going to always be online and we are going to point our domain name to the web host as well so you can see i've got a
