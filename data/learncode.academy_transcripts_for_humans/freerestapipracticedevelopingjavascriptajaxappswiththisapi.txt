00:01 - you know a lot of people who are
00:02 - learning JavaScript run into a block in
00:05 - their learning curve when they want to
00:08 - start developing Ajax applications but
00:10 - they're not on a team uh that has Ajax
00:13 - backend apis that they can use or maybe
00:15 - they're learn you're learning at home um
00:17 - and you don't have access to anything
00:19 - that gives you the ability to start
00:20 - doing that I thought about that over the
00:22 - weekend a lot and so I put together a
00:24 - free restful API that you guys can learn
00:28 - uh use to learn Ajax on your own so yay
00:31 - for you guys you get to do that now um I
00:34 - had a lot of people who went through the
00:35 - jQuery tutorial where we do cover how to
00:37 - build a single page app and you guys
00:39 - asked me hey what can I do I don't have
00:42 - access to an API so here you go no
00:44 - excuses now you have access to an API
00:47 - this should give you all the code you
00:49 - need to do it anyway uh but I'll give
00:51 - you the miniature like two-minute
00:52 - walkthr basically um the data resets
00:55 - every night so it's not going to last
00:56 - forever that's kind of my way of making
00:58 - sure I don't have this gigantic server
01:00 - full of pointless data um and it's not
01:02 - secure anybody can guess your username
01:04 - and access all the data you post so it's
01:06 - just for learning um and then here's
01:08 - kind of how you use it if you just go
01:09 - rest. Learn code. Academy uh go API and
01:13 - then pick a username in this case will
01:15 - and then friends you have access to all
01:17 - the friends that you've created of
01:19 - course if it's the first time you did it
01:21 - say
01:22 - Willis then that that collection will be
01:24 - empty it will be created the second you
01:26 - try to uh access or post to
01:30 - uh username Willis collection friends so
01:33 - I can have Willis friends I can have
01:35 - Willis tweets and there you go empty
01:37 - collections uh so then you can just
01:38 - snatch the code and post to that
01:40 - collection let me snatch this open the
01:43 - console or you guys can do it from your
01:44 - web application let's post to Willis
01:48 - friends I'm going to add my friend let's
01:50 - go ahead and reload that there you go
01:53 - now I have a friend called Billy Bob
01:55 - let's go a and run that a few more times
01:58 - of course I don't have jQuery on this
01:59 - page so I can't do
02:01 - that let's ah where am I there you go
02:04 - let's post that exact same thing like
02:05 - three more times I just ran it and just
02:07 - kind of reran it so now if I refresh
02:09 - Willis friends I have three friends with
02:12 - different IDs so now I can modify those
02:15 - with a put request I can delete those
02:17 - with a delete request let's do this
02:20 - delete Willis friends id1 let's go and
02:24 - delete
02:25 - you let's go check again now I have
02:28 - three friends let's refresh and I have
02:30 - two friends now id2 and ID3 so yippe
02:34 - there you guys go that is your API enjoy
02:37 - it let me know if you run into any
02:38 - problems and also if you build anything
02:41 - cool with it comment below I'd love to
02:43 - see what you guys are building as you're
02:44 - learning Ajax have a good day
