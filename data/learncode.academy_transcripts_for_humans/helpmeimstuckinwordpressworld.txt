00:00 - this video is called help me i am stuck
00:02 - in wordpress world see this guy he's
00:04 - stuck and this is for developers that
00:07 - are stuck in a cms rut uh now there's a
00:10 - few things i should point out right away
00:12 - first of all you can substitute any cms
00:15 - for wordpress whenever i say wordpress
00:17 - here so that could be drupal craft cms
00:19 - and so on uh this video is really for
00:21 - developers who find themselves stuck in
00:23 - the dead zone of being proficient in a
00:25 - cms but they feel much less capable
00:28 - outside of one i personally was stuck
00:30 - here for at least five years earlier on
00:34 - in my career as a developer
00:36 - and i personally know many many dozens
00:38 - of developers who are stuck here right
00:40 - now so it is a very real place
00:43 - and secondly i have to mention that i'm
00:45 - not hating on wordpress drupal or any
00:48 - cms they're a very real technology they
00:51 - serve an important purpose many top
00:53 - notch companies need and use cms's the
00:57 - problem is many developers uh have the
01:00 - experience where they're learning web
01:02 - development and a cms helps them get
01:04 - very far very fast through templates and
01:07 - plugins
01:08 - but after a while developing any
01:10 - templates and plugins world they find
01:12 - themselves at a dead end there's
01:14 - something mentally about the way you
01:16 - approach a templates and plug-ins world
01:18 - that is different from the whole rest of
01:20 - the world of web development
01:22 - and they've been shielded from many
01:23 - aspects of that development world and
01:25 - they cannot break out of cms world so
01:27 - that's who this video is for it's
01:30 - designed to help you break into
01:31 - development arenas that cmss may have
01:34 - been shielding you from
01:36 - so how do i know if this is me um you
01:39 - know this is you if any or all of these
01:41 - apply to you
01:42 - one if you're comfortable creating sites
01:44 - in a cms but you're uncomfortable
01:47 - creating sites outside of wordpress or
01:50 - the cms of your choice
01:52 - then this video is for you uh also
01:54 - and or if you think in terms of hacking
01:57 - and tweaking instead of building so if
02:00 - you hack and tweak things as normal
02:03 - instead of build new things uh for an
02:05 - example hey we need a calendar so
02:07 - instant thought let's look for a
02:08 - calendar plugin i can tweak to fit my
02:10 - needs or instant thought let me find a
02:12 - template that looks like the website i
02:15 - need to build and tweak it to fit my
02:17 - needs so if you think in terms of
02:19 - hacking tweaking instead of building
02:21 - then this is for you also if you mostly
02:24 - or only know how to work with plugins
02:27 - you don't really know how to code stuff
02:29 - by yourself and that leads into if i
02:32 - asked you to build an application like
02:34 - pinterest facebook twitter
02:36 - without a cms you'd have no clue where
02:39 - to begin
02:40 - and lastly i guess if you don't actually
02:42 - know how a cms works behind the scenes
02:45 - and you really couldn't begin to build
02:48 - the cms that you use all the time then
02:50 - this is for you so if this is you do not
02:52 - feel bad just be aware that there is so
02:55 - much of the development world out there
02:58 - uh to know an experience that you
02:59 - haven't known and experienced yet and
03:01 - it's gonna be very good for you to break
03:03 - out of exclusively cms world
03:07 - and they the one exception i'd say is if
03:09 - you consider yourself if you consider
03:11 - yourself to be
03:12 - a designer a graphic designer who can
03:15 - also implement that into the web if your
03:18 - true passion is look and feel and you
03:21 - have no desire to learn development then
03:23 - intentionally stop at html css and and
03:26 - maybe lightweight javascript like jquery
03:29 - but that being said when i was stuck in
03:31 - cms world for those five years i would
03:34 - tell myself that it was because i was a
03:36 - designer but the truth was all i knew
03:38 - how to be was a designer i didn't know
03:41 - that i absolutely loved development
03:43 - because it kind of intimidated me and i
03:45 - had never learned it i was in a box and
03:47 - i never knew that i was and lots of
03:50 - developers are in this place as well so
03:53 - ah if you've determined this is me
03:54 - you're talking about me and one of those
03:56 - things what do i do
03:58 - first of all you need to make a mindset
04:00 - change you are a builder not a
04:03 - repurposer um it's kind of like the
04:06 - difference between people who go buy old
04:08 - dressers on craigslist and refinish them
04:11 - to make them look all trendy but they
04:13 - can never build a trendy dresser from
04:16 - scratch from raw materials
04:19 - and so that's kind of the mental
04:20 - difference is you need to learn how to
04:21 - work with the raw materials the raw
04:23 - lumber so to speak in the development
04:26 - world but instead of wood it's pieces of
04:28 - technology it's frameworks and servers
04:30 - and utilities and stuff like that
04:33 - it's not as intimidating as it might
04:35 - sound and it is far more fulfilling to
04:38 - build something from raw materials than
04:40 - to repurpose something else that
04:42 - somebody else built they're both fun but
04:44 - building is definitely in my opinion
04:46 - drastically more fun
04:48 - so
04:49 - you're gonna change your mindset and
04:51 - then the big piece is is you're going to
04:53 - learn an application development skill
04:56 - set now there's a few different skill
04:58 - sets that you can choose from uh so you
05:01 - get to pick one pick a road any road as
05:03 - you can see from the picture here they
05:04 - all lead to the beach you're they're all
05:06 - going to take you forward so don't sweat
05:08 - this decision too much but pick a skill
05:11 - set you can be front and developer full
05:13 - stack developer or back-end specialty
05:16 - developer and like i said all roads kind
05:19 - of lead to advancing yourself and
05:21 - technology there's overlap there's blend
05:24 - you're not going to get pigeon holed
05:26 - into one thing you can easily cross
05:28 - between these as you move forward as a
05:30 - developer so keep that in mind have fun
05:33 - pick the one that seems like the most
05:34 - fun to you
05:35 - in general if you're left-brained
05:38 - uh you know you like intense data and
05:41 - math go more back-end in in general if
05:44 - you're more right-brained creative go
05:46 - more front-end or full-stack but those
05:47 - are general
05:49 - generalizations very broad sweeping
05:51 - brushes you don't have to hold yourself
05:52 - to those rules
05:54 - so if you're going the front-end
05:55 - developer skill set these are kind of
05:58 - the list of what you need to do
06:00 - first you need to learn how to build a
06:03 - responsive html css layout in page from
06:06 - scratch
06:07 - now this is kind of a core competency
06:10 - of a front-end web developer and it's
06:12 - funny lots of people can actually build
06:14 - sites in wordpress for a decade and not
06:17 - know how to do this so if that's you the
06:19 - first core competency you have to
06:21 - develop is how to build html css layouts
06:24 - and pages from scratch lots of people do
06:27 - know how to do that that are wordpress
06:28 - developers but many many people don't as
06:31 - well
06:32 - uh secondly you got to learn a
06:33 - javascript framework you're going to
06:35 - build client-side applications not just
06:38 - little widgets not just little jquery
06:40 - plug-ins you're going to build
06:42 - applications with a framework um i'd
06:44 - recommend just go for react i think
06:46 - react is something you cannot go wrong
06:47 - with these days
06:49 - if you're not going to go with react go
06:50 - with angular or view view is the
06:53 - simplest of the three so if you find
06:55 - react in angular very intimidating and
06:57 - difficult
06:58 - kick it off with view and then move into
07:01 - something else angular is also very
07:03 - popular but in general i think react is
07:05 - the best for the way it will make you
07:07 - think as a developer i think it will
07:09 - teach you very good habits very good
07:11 - mental approaches towards how to build
07:14 - applications
07:15 - so layouts
07:17 - learn a framework and then pretty much
07:19 - learn how to consume back-end apis you
07:21 - don't have to know how to build
07:23 - back-ends but you do have to know how to
07:25 - work with them how to get data so you
07:27 - can use services like endless or
07:29 - firebase
07:30 - i have a very stripped down free thing
07:32 - called rest.learncode.academy
07:35 - which is just a
07:36 - server that resets its information every
07:38 - day but you can kind of play around with
07:40 - a fake back end on there and it's again
07:43 - completely free
07:45 - and then lastly you need to learn how to
07:46 - set up which is a the fancy word for
07:48 - that is provision
07:50 - a static site web server and get your
07:52 - code on there so you know how do you get
07:54 - a static site web server you can google
07:56 - how to provision static site web server
07:58 - with digitalocean or with your service
08:00 - of choice um so you get a choice there
08:03 - i'll put a code in the description for
08:04 - some free money on digitalocean ten
08:06 - dollars or twenty dollars for free i
08:08 - forget exactly what the value is but you
08:10 - can actually mess around with servers
08:12 - for free um and again that's a referral
08:14 - link i get free credit if you use that
08:15 - but i never use that credit anyway so
08:18 - feel free not to use it
08:20 - so if you want to go full stack
08:22 - developer skill set here's kind of what
08:24 - that word looks like you actually begin
08:26 - with
08:27 - everything from front end so front end
08:29 - is kind of a good place to start
08:32 - plus
08:34 - you're going to shoot to hey can i
08:35 - install a database locally and on a
08:37 - production server
08:38 - you can't go wrong with my sequel and or
08:41 - mongodb
08:42 - those are two good players to go with
08:44 - these days
08:45 - there are some trendier newer databases
08:48 - but mysql and mongodb are hands down the
08:50 - most popular two so those are good
08:52 - choices to go with
08:54 - and then you're going to learn how to
08:55 - build a backend application for your
08:58 - front end application so full stack
09:01 - developers tend to build say a
09:05 - single page react app and then the api
09:08 - that that app consumes that tends to be
09:10 - where a full stack developer stops so
09:13 - you're you're building the database and
09:15 - you're exposing an api to your front-end
09:17 - application uh so that way your
09:19 - front-end application can read and write
09:21 - to that database and that's usually
09:23 - about where full stack developers tend
09:25 - to stop and then you know the ability to
09:27 - deploy that application to production so
09:29 - how to deploy node.js application to
09:31 - production is a good thing to search on
09:33 - google
09:34 - and then what technologies and languages
09:36 - um if you're saying just tell me a good
09:38 - one go with node.js with the framework
09:41 - being express js you can't go wrong with
09:44 - that now if you're really comfortable
09:46 - with php because almost all these cmss
09:48 - are rphb
09:50 - start off with lumen and then go laravel
09:54 - since lumen is is much simpler
09:56 - lightweight it's much more like express
09:57 - js laramel laravel is very full featured
10:01 - but honestly even if you know php and
10:04 - you're up for a challenge go with
10:05 - node.js it's simple it's javascript and
10:08 - you really cannot go wrong with it these
10:11 - days it's an awesome piece of technology
10:13 - so there's your second skill set and
10:16 - your third skill set back in developer
10:18 - skill set
10:19 - you will learn everything from full
10:21 - stack but not the front end portion so
10:23 - you'll learn how to set up a database
10:25 - you'll learn how to consume information
10:27 - from that database you'll learn how to
10:29 - expose an api that front-end
10:30 - applications can use but you will never
10:32 - build those front-end applications
10:35 - and then you will learn how to scale an
10:36 - app as traffic grows
10:39 - which sounds complicated but it's not
10:40 - really that bad
10:42 - you'll use a load balancer like nginx or
10:45 - h a proxy either one of those are great
10:47 - picks
10:49 - and you'll learn how to backup and
10:50 - restore the database of your choice
10:52 - that's not really too hard they're made
10:53 - to be backed up and restored optionally
10:56 - you can learn how to scale those
10:58 - databases to handle large amounts of
10:59 - traffic
11:01 - and then how do you continuously test
11:04 - and deploy an application so when you
11:06 - push to github tests run on your code
11:09 - and when you merge to master or merge to
11:11 - a specific branch then it automatically
11:13 - goes out into production servers
11:16 - this is you don't have to learn this to
11:18 - start back-end but it's definitely a
11:19 - part of the back-end developer skill set
11:23 - some companies out there offering
11:26 - continuous integration tools or codechip
11:28 - circle ci travis ci all very good
11:31 - companies
11:32 - and they also want to learn how to
11:33 - deploy with docker these days that's
11:35 - also something that a developer should
11:37 - strive to have in their skill set as a
11:39 - back-end developer
11:41 - and then how do you provision servers
11:43 - with code this is a little more advanced
11:45 - back-end developer skill set
11:47 - but using what's called configuration
11:49 - management tools how do you get servers
11:52 - set up using code that you wrote in
11:54 - advance so you can essentially use that
11:56 - code over and over again to create 10
11:58 - identical servers in production you
12:00 - don't have to do it manually that's a a
12:03 - very good thing it's worth doing it's
12:04 - worth spending the time on
12:06 - so
12:08 - there's your skill sets uh to go for i'm
12:10 - gonna give you a quote you owe it to
12:12 - yourself to know more than just a cms
12:14 - that's for me
12:16 - i'm giving you that quote hopefully this
12:18 - helps you out if you found yourself
12:20 - stuck in that world that i was stuck in
12:22 - hopefully this gives you not just the
12:24 - motivation incentive but a road map to
12:27 - get out of there and start experiencing
12:29 - much more of this broad and enjoyable
12:31 - world of web development
12:33 - and that is all thank you so much have a
12:37 - great day and keep on coding

Cleaned transcript:

this video is called help me i am stuck in wordpress world see this guy he's stuck and this is for developers that are stuck in a cms rut uh now there's a few things i should point out right away first of all you can substitute any cms for wordpress whenever i say wordpress here so that could be drupal craft cms and so on uh this video is really for developers who find themselves stuck in the dead zone of being proficient in a cms but they feel much less capable outside of one i personally was stuck here for at least five years earlier on in my career as a developer and i personally know many many dozens of developers who are stuck here right now so it is a very real place and secondly i have to mention that i'm not hating on wordpress drupal or any cms they're a very real technology they serve an important purpose many top notch companies need and use cms's the problem is many developers uh have the experience where they're learning web development and a cms helps them get very far very fast through templates and plugins but after a while developing any templates and plugins world they find themselves at a dead end there's something mentally about the way you approach a templates and plugins world that is different from the whole rest of the world of web development and they've been shielded from many aspects of that development world and they cannot break out of cms world so that's who this video is for it's designed to help you break into development arenas that cmss may have been shielding you from so how do i know if this is me um you know this is you if any or all of these apply to you one if you're comfortable creating sites in a cms but you're uncomfortable creating sites outside of wordpress or the cms of your choice then this video is for you uh also and or if you think in terms of hacking and tweaking instead of building so if you hack and tweak things as normal instead of build new things uh for an example hey we need a calendar so instant thought let's look for a calendar plugin i can tweak to fit my needs or instant thought let me find a template that looks like the website i need to build and tweak it to fit my needs so if you think in terms of hacking tweaking instead of building then this is for you also if you mostly or only know how to work with plugins you don't really know how to code stuff by yourself and that leads into if i asked you to build an application like pinterest facebook twitter without a cms you'd have no clue where to begin and lastly i guess if you don't actually know how a cms works behind the scenes and you really couldn't begin to build the cms that you use all the time then this is for you so if this is you do not feel bad just be aware that there is so much of the development world out there uh to know an experience that you haven't known and experienced yet and it's gonna be very good for you to break out of exclusively cms world and they the one exception i'd say is if you consider yourself if you consider yourself to be a designer a graphic designer who can also implement that into the web if your true passion is look and feel and you have no desire to learn development then intentionally stop at html css and and maybe lightweight javascript like jquery but that being said when i was stuck in cms world for those five years i would tell myself that it was because i was a designer but the truth was all i knew how to be was a designer i didn't know that i absolutely loved development because it kind of intimidated me and i had never learned it i was in a box and i never knew that i was and lots of developers are in this place as well so ah if you've determined this is me you're talking about me and one of those things what do i do first of all you need to make a mindset change you are a builder not a repurposer um it's kind of like the difference between people who go buy old dressers on craigslist and refinish them to make them look all trendy but they can never build a trendy dresser from scratch from raw materials and so that's kind of the mental difference is you need to learn how to work with the raw materials the raw lumber so to speak in the

to build something from raw materials than to repurpose something else that somebody else built they're both fun but building is definitely in my opinion drastically more fun so you're gonna change

and developer full stack developer or backend specialty developer and like i said all roads kind of lead to advancing yourself and technology there's overlap there's blend you're not going to get pigeon holed into one thing you can easily cross between these as you move forward as a developer so keep that in mind have fun pick the one that seems like the most fun to you in general if you're leftbrained uh you know you like intense data and math go more backend in in general if you're more rightbrained creative go more frontend or fullstack but those are general generalizations very broad sweeping brushes you don't have to hold yourself to those rules so if you're going the frontend developer skill set these are kind of the list of what you need to do first you need to learn how to

to start backend but it's definitely a part of the backend developer skill set some companies out there offering continuous integration tools or codechip circle ci travis ci all very good companies and they also want to learn how to deploy with docker these days that's also something that a developer should strive to have in their skill set as a backend developer and then how do you provision servers with code this is a little more advanced backend developer skill set but using what's called configuration management tools how do you get servers set up using code that you wrote in advance so you can essentially use that code over and over again to create 10 identical servers in production you don't have to do it manually that's a a very good thing it's worth doing it's worth spending the time on so there's your skill sets uh to go for i'm gonna give you a quote you owe it to yourself to know more than just a cms that's for me i'm giving you that quote hopefully this helps you out if you found yourself stuck in that world that i was stuck in hopefully this gives you not just the motivation incentive but a road map to get out of there and start experiencing much more of this broad and enjoyable world of web development and that is all thank you so much have a great day and keep on coding
