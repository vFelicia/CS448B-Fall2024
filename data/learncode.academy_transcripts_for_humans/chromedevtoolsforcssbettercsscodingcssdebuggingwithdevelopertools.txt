00:01 - okay so in this video we're going to be
00:02 - doing Chrome Dev tools we're going to be
00:05 - using Chrome Dev tools to enhance our
00:07 - CSS coding uh to take it to the next
00:10 - level make the workflow a little easier
00:12 - also give us the ability to see what's
00:14 - going on on somebody else's site and
00:16 - bring those CSS rules over to our site
00:18 - easily so let's say I got this site here
00:21 - uh basic bootstrap three panel layout
00:23 - looks like Factory bootstrap if you
00:26 - haven't seen the bootstrap video check
00:28 - it out now you're going to get your mind
00:30 - blown on how awesome bootstrap is I'll
00:32 - put that in the
00:33 - description um this should look familiar
00:35 - to you otherwise basic bootstrap stuff
00:38 - so I mean by default your theme with
00:41 - bootstrap will give you several things
00:43 - let's say I want to make this one
00:45 - special and this one dim you can go
00:47 - panel success which is this these are
00:50 - based off the colors of your theme uh
00:53 - warning that's a yellow primary these
00:56 - are all going to come from your
00:58 - bootstrap theme that you're using those
01:00 - are great but let's say I really want it
01:01 - to be something unique in my own um so
01:04 - I'm going to leave that panel default
01:06 - and I'm going to go panel special and
01:07 - we're going to build a rule on top of
01:09 - bootstrap you don't want to modify
01:11 - bootstrap just so you know don't want to
01:13 - modify bootstrap bad idea bad practice
01:16 - if they ever upgrade it you're going to
01:17 - get in big trouble you're not going to
01:19 - be able to do it so you want to build on
01:21 - top of it with your own customized rules
01:23 - so I'm going to make panel special and
01:25 - we're going to build out a rule for
01:26 - panel special to make this thing look
01:28 - you guessed it special
01:30 - so the first thing I'm going to do is
01:31 - I'm going to come over here and I'm
01:32 - going to rightclick and do inspect
01:34 - element in Chrome and that opens up Dev
01:36 - tools Let's Go full screen here Dev
01:39 - tools is what Chrome gives you Mozilla
01:41 - Firefox also gives you something pretty
01:43 - similar to this uh some features better
01:46 - some features worse um also IE has it
01:49 - pretty much of all the devs I know most
01:51 - people prefer Chrome nobody prefers IE a
01:55 - couple people prefer Milla firefox's Dev
01:58 - tools find the one you like this is
02:00 - about Chrome so when I right clicked and
02:02 - inspected the element it gave me the
02:04 - panel heading which was the thing I
02:05 - clicked on you can see this is the HTML
02:07 - that I actually had going on there uh a
02:10 - couple cool things you can do is you can
02:11 - real time you know right click and start
02:13 - changing your
02:16 - HTML very special panel um kind of like
02:18 - what I'm doing with live reload uh you
02:21 - can also delete a
02:23 - node um actually delete a whole node you
02:25 - know just start actually real time
02:27 - modifying your HTML code you can right
02:30 - click and do edit as HTML and instead of
02:32 - a div we'll change it to a
02:37 - button ah if I could
02:40 - type there you go now we have some
02:42 - awkward button there so real time you
02:44 - can change your HTML I'm going to
02:45 - refresh my page it doesn't actually
02:48 - change your file it just reloads what
02:51 - you're seeing at the time so if you ever
02:53 - hit refresh be careful it's going to
02:55 - clear everything you've adjusted in the
02:57 - meantime I have made that mistake
02:59 - several times or if you're using live
03:00 - reload you come over here and hit save
03:03 - and ah all my Styles got tweaked um and
03:06 - now it just reloaded so be careful of
03:09 - that um let's say once again we want to
03:11 - make this thing special so I can also
03:13 - when I click on each element I can see
03:15 - every CSS rule that is applying to that
03:18 - element all in a row here and as you can
03:21 - see it's quite a few and they're all
03:22 - coming from bootstrap because bootstrap
03:24 - has just got a lot put into it this has
03:27 - some you know body styles that affect
03:29 - every element on there you can see it's
03:31 - inherited from body keeps going up the
03:34 - list and then there's some Styles
03:36 - directly on panel heading um you can
03:39 - real time change any of these let's
03:41 - change the background color to a reddish
03:43 - border color to a whitish uh if you're
03:45 - going more for the design at the moment
03:47 - these will really help you know you
03:50 - quickly flush out design stuff even
03:52 - faster than if you're using live reload
03:54 - you can turn Styles off you know so I
03:57 - can turn off my border radius that
03:58 - little I think it's a yeah three pixel
04:01 - rounded Corners I can turn those off
04:03 - turn off my padding yeah don't want to
04:05 - do that um you can just kind of see what
04:07 - happens and if you want to actually
04:09 - click you can see where they're coming
04:10 - from I'm using bootstrap minified so
04:12 - it's one Big Blob of CSS not very
04:15 - helpful
04:17 - there um let's say I want to build my
04:20 - own we can't modify these because these
04:23 - are coming from bootstrap and we're not
04:25 - going to modify bootstrap so I'm G to
04:27 - actually build my own panel special
04:29 - class so let me go ahead hit refresh
04:31 - here I'm going to start building out
04:33 - element style here and we're going to
04:35 - start on panel heading so I'm going to
04:37 - go
04:38 - background red color
04:42 - white um and then let's go tweak these
04:45 - to be a more pleasant red since that
04:48 - default red is hideous make that
04:50 - slightly off white there we go that
04:52 - looks nice I'm also going to go
04:55 - border border radius zero to get those
04:58 - square corners just to make it different
05:01 - I'd probably want to do that sitewide
05:02 - but whatever so you notice it entered
05:04 - those in it converted them to RGB colors
05:06 - which is fine you can use either one and
05:09 - also gave me this inline style thing so
05:11 - I can double click on that and copy them
05:13 - which is great and now come to my CSS
05:16 - file panel special and we are actually
05:19 - on panel heading
05:26 - so panel special panel heading copy
05:29 - those files in there hit save it
05:31 - refreshes and I got them awesome so
05:34 - let's go ahead and tweak this body a
05:35 - little bit let's go
05:38 - background color I'll make color red too
05:43 - um and let's go background red let's go
05:46 - give it a nice little Pleasant
05:49 - color and I'm feeling special it's
05:52 - working um let's go border radius zero
05:56 - and this won't work I want to get rid of
05:58 - these rounded Corners I already know it
06:00 - won't work cuz I tried this ahead of
06:02 - time um and oh no I changed border
06:05 - radius to zero and it didn't happen
06:08 - where is that coming from and this is
06:10 - something you ask yourself when you're
06:11 - coding CSS all the time where the heck
06:14 - is that style coming from because this
06:16 - should have overwritten it and it didn't
06:18 - overwrite it so I'll scroll down I'm on
06:21 - panel body I scroll down there's no
06:23 - border radius on here another thing you
06:25 - can do is you can click on
06:27 - computed and you can see here um
06:31 - computed style are all the ones that
06:32 - it's inheriting from I will get to
06:35 - computed in a little bit um so I'm
06:37 - checking out Styles border radius has
06:38 - not been defined anywhere so well
06:41 - clearly I don't need that so I'll delete
06:43 - you and so now what you got to do this
06:45 - is what this inspector for is I'm going
06:47 - to start going up the chain so the panel
06:49 - body I must be getting border radius
06:51 - from this element up here let's go up an
06:53 - elements and yep there you go border
06:55 - radius of four pixels so we are able to
06:59 - take this for panel body let me copy
07:02 - that
07:07 - out panel
07:10 - body copy those in I hate the white
07:13 - space but oh well and now we should be
07:16 - looking yep now I got our colors when it
07:18 - refreshes yep so all we need to do is
07:20 - get that border radius zero on the
07:22 - actual panel special
07:28 - element
07:31 - and that should take care of it yep
07:33 - there we go now we got square square
07:35 - corners everywhere so it helped us debug
07:37 - that and like I said once again what
07:39 - you're going to get all the time is
07:40 - where is that padding coming from I set
07:42 - padding to zero on this it must be
07:44 - coming from up here um and let's look at
07:47 - this computed tab here real quick
07:49 - computed will show you 100% of the
07:52 - styles that are applying to that element
07:56 - and so here's color you can actually
07:58 - drop it down and and see the whole so
08:00 - you can see it's coming from panel is
08:02 - getting a transparent color and then
08:04 - panel default is overriding it which is
08:06 - why that struck out with this uh gray
08:09 - color right there so if I go panel
08:11 - heading and I go background color you
08:14 - can see panel default is going to give
08:16 - us that F5 F5 and panel special is
08:19 - overriding it so that's another way you
08:21 - can kind of look through and see you can
08:23 - also see that this panel special Ru is
08:25 - coming from my CSS inspect stylesheet uh
08:28 - whereas this is coming from the
08:29 - bootstrap file so that's kind of how
08:31 - you're going to use this um kind of
08:35 - going to how you're going to use this
08:37 - inspector for CSS stuff let's say
08:39 - there's a style there's a let's go to
08:42 - csst tricks.com and see if there's
08:46 - something on here that we want to
08:48 - snatch that must not be the CSS tricks
08:51 - what is his
08:53 - website great guy CSS Dash tricks great
08:57 - website great stuff on here let's say
09:00 - I'm like ooh that hover thing is Nifty
09:02 - let's look at that and see what rule
09:04 - that U made that thing glow when I
09:06 - hovered over it so let's see if we can
09:09 - find what that is uh this looks like it
09:12 - is div class logo let's click on that
09:16 - and then another thing you can do is you
09:18 - can click on here and see what happens
09:20 - on
09:22 - Hover and that will automatically turn
09:24 - hover on okay nothing changed when I
09:27 - turned hover on so let me look at Dash
09:29 - tricks and see if that changes when I
09:31 - turn hover on that didn't change when I
09:33 - turned hover on let's keep looking
09:39 - here there we go this a when I click on
09:44 - Hover then you can see the glow starts
09:47 - coming on so it's in the hover element
09:50 - and let's go find out where that
09:56 - is color hover text
09:59 - decoration you're just going to start
10:01 - looking through all these and I'm going
10:02 - to start turning these off till I can
10:04 - find out which one makes the glow go
10:08 - away that's not it that's not it oh you
10:12 - know what it is it's when the hover is
10:14 - on the a I'll bet you anything I now see
10:18 - there we go that's it so let me tell you
10:20 - what I just did here is I could tell
10:22 - okay there's nothing in the
10:24 - a that is causing that glow to come on
10:28 - but
10:29 - it's when the hover is turned on the a
10:31 - that the glow appears so that means
10:33 - there must be a rule inside as well I
10:36 - don't know if I'm making sense here but
10:37 - I'll show you what it is is there's a a
10:40 - hover span so when we're hovering over
10:42 - the a the span is going to get its own
10:45 - Rule and that's where it is it's going
10:47 - to get that text Shadow I want that I
10:50 - need this so I'm going to copy text
10:54 - Shadow and then I'm going to say let's
10:57 - just go text shadow
11:02 - and now I have it all the time let's go
11:04 - back here o it's glowing awesome I
11:07 - snatched it but I only want it when I
11:08 - hover over it so I'm going to
11:13 - go panel
11:15 - special I'll basically just rip off what
11:18 - he did
11:19 - panel special hover so I'm hovering over
11:22 - panel
11:23 - special then my panel
11:26 - heading is going to get that
11:29 - so that should give me
11:31 - nothing here we go I want to hover ha
11:34 - got it and then it glows and it's
11:37 - special so that's kind of a really quick
11:40 - I don't know if I confused you on the
11:42 - whole hover part um but that's kind of
11:44 - how you use this to start seeing what's
11:46 - going on with that I want to copy that
11:49 - onto my site um that's a pretty much
11:53 - basic intro to how to use CSS for Dev
11:56 - tools going to put up some other videos
11:58 - here for bootstrap at the end and have
12:00 - yourselves a great day bye

Cleaned transcript:

okay so in this video we're going to be doing Chrome Dev tools we're going to be using Chrome Dev tools to enhance our CSS coding uh to take it to the next level make the workflow a little easier also give us the ability to see what's going on on somebody else's site and bring those CSS rules over to our site easily so let's say I got this site here uh basic bootstrap three panel layout looks like Factory bootstrap if you haven't seen the bootstrap video check it out now you're going to get your mind blown on how awesome bootstrap is I'll put that in the description um this should look familiar to you otherwise basic bootstrap stuff so I mean by default your theme with bootstrap will give you several things let's say I want to make this one special and this one dim you can go panel success which is this these are based off the colors of your theme uh warning that's a yellow primary these are all going to come from your bootstrap theme that you're using those are great but let's say I really want it to be something unique in my own um so I'm going to leave that panel default and I'm going to go panel special and we're going to build a rule on top of bootstrap you don't want to modify bootstrap just so you know don't want to modify bootstrap bad idea bad practice if they ever upgrade it you're going to get in big trouble you're not going to be able to do it so you want to build on top of it with your own customized rules so I'm going to make panel special and we're going to build out a rule for panel special to make this thing look you guessed it special so the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to come over here and I'm going to rightclick and do inspect element in Chrome and that opens up Dev tools Let's Go full screen here Dev tools is what Chrome gives you Mozilla Firefox also gives you something pretty similar to this uh some features better some features worse um also IE has it pretty much of all the devs I know most people prefer Chrome nobody prefers IE a couple people prefer Milla firefox's Dev tools find the one you like this is about Chrome so when I right clicked and inspected the element it gave me the panel heading which was the thing I clicked on you can see this is the HTML that I actually had going on there uh a couple cool things you can do is you can real time you know right click and start changing your HTML very special panel um kind of like what I'm doing with live reload uh you can also delete a node um actually delete a whole node you know just start actually real time modifying your HTML code you can right click and do edit as HTML and instead of a div we'll change it to a button ah if I could type there you go now we have some awkward button there so real time you can change your HTML I'm going to refresh my page it doesn't actually change your file it just reloads what you're seeing at the time so if you ever hit refresh be careful it's going to clear everything you've adjusted in the meantime I have made that mistake several times or if you're using live reload you come over here and hit save and ah all my Styles got tweaked um and now it just reloaded so be careful of that um let's say once again we want to make this thing special so I can also when I click on each element I can see every CSS rule that is applying to that element all in a row here and as you can see it's quite a few and they're all coming from bootstrap because bootstrap has just got a lot put into it this has some you know body styles that affect every element on there you can see it's inherited from body keeps going up the list and then there's some Styles directly on panel heading um you can real time change any of these let's change the background color to a reddish border color to a whitish uh if you're going more for the design at the moment these will really help you know you quickly flush out design stuff even faster than if you're using live reload you can turn Styles off you know so I can turn off my border radius that little I think it's a yeah three pixel rounded Corners I can turn those off turn off my padding yeah don't want to do that um you can just kind of see what happens and if you want to actually click you can see where they're coming from I'm using bootstrap minified so it's one Big Blob of CSS not very helpful there um let's say I want to build my own we can't modify these because these are coming from bootstrap and we're not going to modify bootstrap so I'm G to actually build my own panel special class so let me go ahead hit refresh here I'm going to start building out element style here and we're going to start on panel heading so I'm going to go background red color white um and then let's go tweak these to be a more pleasant red since that default red is hideous make that slightly off white there we go that looks nice I'm also going to go border border radius zero to get those square corners just to make it different I'd probably want to do that sitewide but whatever so you notice it entered those in it converted them to RGB colors which is fine you can use either one and also gave me this inline style thing so I can double click on that and copy them which is great and now come to my CSS file panel special and we are actually on panel heading so panel special panel heading copy those files in there hit save it refreshes and I got them awesome so let's go ahead and tweak this body a little bit let's go background color I'll make color red too um and let's go background red let's go give it a nice little Pleasant color and I'm feeling special it's working um let's go border radius zero and this won't work I want to get rid of these rounded Corners I already know it won't work cuz I tried this ahead of time um and oh no I changed border radius to zero and it didn't happen where is that coming from and this is something you ask yourself when you're coding CSS all the time where the heck is that style coming from because this should have overwritten it and it didn't overwrite it so I'll scroll down I'm on panel body I scroll down there's no border radius on here another thing you can do is you can click on computed and you can see here um computed style are all the ones that it's inheriting from I will get to computed in a little bit um so I'm checking out Styles border radius has not been defined

border radius from this element up here let's go up an elements and yep there you go border radius of four pixels so we are able to take this for panel body let me copy that out panel body copy those in I hate the white space but oh well and now we should be looking yep now I got our colors when it refreshes yep so all we need to do is get that border radius zero on the actual panel special element and that should take care of it yep there we go now we got square square corners everywhere so it helped us debug that and like I said once again what you're going to get all the time is where is that padding coming from I set padding to zero on this it must be coming from up here um and let's look at this computed tab here real quick computed will show you 100% of the styles that are applying to that element and so here's color you can actually drop it down and and see the whole so you can see it's coming from panel is getting a transparent color and then panel default is overriding it which is why that struck out with this uh gray color right there so if I go panel heading and I go background color you can see panel default is going to give us that F5 F5 and panel special is overriding it so that's another way you can kind of look through and see you can also see that this panel special Ru is coming from my CSS inspect stylesheet uh whereas this is coming from the bootstrap file so that's kind of how you're going to use this um kind of going to how you're going to use this inspector for CSS stuff let's say there's a style there's a let's go to csst tricks.com and see if there's something on here that we want to snatch that must not be the CSS tricks what is his website great guy CSS Dash tricks great website great stuff on here let's say I'm like ooh that hover thing is Nifty let's look at that and see what rule that U made that thing glow when I hovered over it so let's see if we can find what that is uh this looks like it is div class

so let me look at Dash tricks and see if that changes when I turn hover on that didn't change when I turned hover on let's keep looking here there we go this a when I click on Hover then you can see the glow starts coming on so it's in the hover element and let's go find out where that is color hover text decoration you're just going to start looking through all these and I'm going to start turning these off till I can find out which one makes the glow go away that's not it that's not it oh you know what it is it's when the hover is on the a I'll bet you anything I now see there we go that's it so let me tell you what I just did here is I could tell okay there's nothing in the a that is causing that glow to come on but it's when the hover is turned on the a that the glow appears so

all the time let's go back here o it's glowing awesome I snatched it but I only want it when I hover over it so I'm going to go panel special I'll basically just rip off what he did panel special hover so I'm hovering over panel special then my panel heading is going to get that so that should give me nothing here we go I want to hover ha got it and then it glows and it's special so that's kind of a really quick I don't know if I confused you on the whole hover part um but that's kind of how you use this to start seeing what's going on with that I want to copy that onto my site um that's a pretty much basic intro to how to use CSS for Dev tools going to put up some other videos here for bootstrap at the end and have yourselves a great day bye
