00:00 - all right so if you're learning web
00:02 - development if you know HTML CSS or
00:05 - you're learning those the next step for
00:07 - you is going to be to learn jQuery
00:09 - jQuery is the easiest and most popular
00:12 - JavaScript library so if you want to
00:14 - start learning JavaScript learn jQuery
00:17 - every employer I've ever worked for uses
00:19 - jQuery no matter how big or how small
00:21 - they were so it's very popular there are
00:24 - companies that don't use it but most of
00:26 - them do so here's how you add jQuery on
00:29 - your page you download it from
00:30 - jquery.com put it in your project folder
00:33 - um and then what you're going to do is
00:35 - you're going to just add a script tag
00:37 - and you'll add the source to it so in
00:39 - this case it's in a bower components
00:41 - folder jQuery folder inside of there and
00:43 - then there's my file jquery.js so when I
00:47 - put that on my page nothing changes
00:49 - because jQuery doesn't actually do
00:51 - anything it gives you a library of
00:53 - commands that you can use to do things
00:55 - so it's on the page now and I'm going to
00:57 - go add my own script tag and inside of
01:00 - it I'm going to write my own JavaScript
01:03 - uh so what you're going to have to
01:04 - remember to start jQuery is one thing uh
01:08 - and this is the memorization part for
01:09 - you once you get through this you get to
01:11 - actually have tons of fun with jQuery so
01:13 - here we go it's
01:15 - document before I mention that this
01:18 - dollar sign is the the value that's
01:21 - given to the jQuery Library when it
01:22 - loads up so anytime you you want to
01:24 - reference jQuery you hit dollar um so we
01:27 - go
01:28 - document
01:30 - and then we go ready and you just got to
01:32 - memorize this you'll later on understand
01:34 - what it's about and then you do this
01:36 - function thing function open and close
01:39 - parentheses uh open and close curly
01:41 - braces and then close your first
01:43 - parentheses honestly what I did when I
01:45 - started off is I copied and pasted this
01:47 - and saved it somewhere because it just
01:49 - didn't make sense to me and you don't
01:50 - want to have to think about it just
01:52 - paste this in your jQuery code always
01:55 - goes inside of a document ready function
01:58 - you can have multiple document ready
02:00 - functions there's really no need to if
02:02 - you just have a few lines of code but
02:04 - they're not going to conflict what this
02:06 - does is this says hey wait for my whole
02:08 - document to load up before I try running
02:11 - any JavaScript otherwise you're going to
02:13 - try to talk to panel one with JavaScript
02:16 - and panel one hasn't loaded yet so the
02:18 - javascript's going to run it's not going
02:19 - to find panel one it won't do anything
02:22 - and then panel one will load and it's
02:24 - not going to do what you're expecting it
02:25 - to do and you probably won't even get
02:27 - any errors about it it just says nothing
02:30 - happens so the document ready function
02:32 - says hey wait for my document to fully
02:34 - load then let's start running stuff so
02:37 - your jqu goes in here there's also a
02:38 - short way of doing it and that's just
02:41 - dollar function so that's what I use
02:44 - that's what most people use but you can
02:45 - do document ready function they're the
02:47 - same thing so now that we've done that
02:50 - and now that I've probably confused you
02:51 - from the start that's the only
02:52 - complicated part the rest of it let's
02:54 - just have fun you're going to go dollar
02:56 - command and open your parenthesis and
02:58 - then you have two parts to each jQuery
03:01 - action you have the selector which works
03:03 - just like CSS you see over here I showed
03:06 - you what they are so there's panel
03:08 - one and that's because it's id1 exactly
03:11 - as if you were doing ID is panel one
03:13 - just like if you were doing CSS um so
03:16 - I've selected it you can use single
03:17 - quotes or you can use double quotes
03:20 - don't know what sublime's doing to me
03:21 - there you can use double quotes either
03:23 - one work and then you give it dot and
03:26 - give it your method so in this case I'm
03:27 - going to go hide and I'm going to hit SA
03:29 - it's going to reload for me so there you
03:31 - go it loads up the page and then it
03:33 - hides panel one I can tell it to hide
03:36 - 300 which will hide over the course of
03:38 - 300 milliseconds you'll see it kind of
03:40 - does a little animation there for me and
03:43 - then it's chainable Jake c is awesome
03:45 - and that you can keep chaining it as
03:46 - long as it's not the semicolon yet so I
03:49 - can hide it and then I can show it over
03:51 - the course of one second so it hides
03:53 - fast and then it shows slowly and you
03:55 - can just keep going you can do hide show
03:57 - hide show there you go go hio hio it's
04:01 - fun jQuery is tons of fun another thing
04:05 - you can do is slide
04:08 - up and just as you'd expect it slides up
04:11 - and then it hides and then you can have
04:13 - it slide
04:16 - down up and then back down you can also
04:20 - add a delay in there
04:22 - delay so we're going to delay for 1
04:24 - second which is 1,000 milliseconds wait
04:27 - a little bit and then we'll do it again
04:28 - jQuery it's fun this is super awesome so
04:32 - I can have it slide up delay you can do
04:34 - fade
04:35 - in fade out there it goes and gone and
04:39 - then it's going to slide down um another
04:42 - thing you can do is you can do Fade
04:43 - toggle you can do toggle for pretty much
04:46 - anything so if I do Fade toggle
04:49 - twice then it'll fade out since it's
04:52 - currently in and then it'll fade in
04:54 - because it's currently out toggle will
04:56 - well it'll toggle you can slide toggle
05:00 - it's going to slide up and it's going to
05:01 - slide back down and then you can just do
05:03 - toggle if you just want it to do a hide
05:06 - a show hide so that's kind of the
05:08 - showing and hiding parts of uh jQuery
05:13 - super super fun you can go.
05:16 - CSS this is where it gets a little bit
05:19 - more tricky and then you give it a pair
05:21 - of curly braces which are options and
05:24 - I'm actually you can go color
05:28 - red and then oh red is not defined you
05:31 - have to do it in uh quotes sorry about
05:32 - that there you go and now my color
05:35 - became red uh this one has something
05:37 - else overwriting it but there you go the
05:39 - panel one gets a color of red and then I
05:42 - can do a comma here and I can go font
05:46 - weight the one thing you can't do I'll
05:49 - show you in a second font weight bold
05:52 - there we go font weight bold the one
05:54 - thing you can't do is you can't do font
05:55 - Dash weight because in JavaScript this
05:58 - means font minus weight which it looks
06:01 - for Math and doesn't make sense and
06:03 - we'll throw an error ah that doesn't
06:04 - make sense uh what you can do is you can
06:06 - wrap that in quotes if you want to do it
06:08 - that way single or double quotes and
06:11 - that works or jQuery is smart enough to
06:13 - where you can go font
06:16 - weight so there you go I can change the
06:19 - CSS um and it's a little confusing this
06:23 - is kind of a cleaner way of doing it
06:25 - we're making what's called a JavaScript
06:27 - object if you want to Google that so
06:29 - anytime you do curly braces in
06:31 - JavaScript it's making an object unless
06:33 - you have function before it which is
06:35 - really that's for a JavaScript lesson so
06:37 - now I can go color red and add a comma
06:40 - font weight bold now it's starting to
06:41 - feel a little bit more like CSS and I
06:44 - can go display
06:48 - none and just in case I didn't want to
06:50 - see it anymore which is basically what a
06:52 - jQuery show hide does so there we go
06:55 - panel one uh so let's make panel one
06:59 - high
07:01 - and then let's make panel
07:05 - 2 CSS
07:10 - opacity
07:12 - 0.5 so now when I boot up that's gone
07:15 - and that's halfway hidden and at from
07:17 - this point we'll call this a lesson and
07:20 - what will the next step will be in the
07:22 - next lesson is to listen to events the
07:24 - real fun of JavaScript happens when you
07:26 - start interacting with what the user
07:28 - does those are called JavaScript events
07:30 - when they click do this when they hover
07:32 - do this um and when they Mouse up do
07:36 - that so that's really where jQuery gets
07:38 - even more fun we'll stop right here so
07:41 - you can watch it over if I've done too
07:43 - much too fast if you've kept up with a
07:45 - pretty fast pace here let's go on to
07:47 - lesson number
07:58 - two

Cleaned transcript:

all right so if you're learning web development if you know HTML CSS or you're learning those the next step for you is going to be to learn jQuery jQuery is the easiest and most popular JavaScript library so if you want to start learning JavaScript learn jQuery every employer I've ever worked for uses jQuery no matter how big or how small they were so it's very popular there are companies that don't use it but most of them do so here's how you add jQuery on your page you download it from jquery.com put it in your project folder um and then what you're going to do is you're going to just add a script tag and you'll add the source to it so in this case it's in a bower components folder jQuery folder inside of there and then there's my file jquery.js so when I put that on my page nothing changes because jQuery doesn't actually do anything it gives you a library of commands that you can use to do things so it's on the page now and I'm going to go add my own script tag and inside of it I'm going to write my own JavaScript uh so what you're going to have to remember to start jQuery is one thing uh and this is the memorization part for you once you get through this you get to actually have tons of fun with jQuery so here we go it's document before I mention that this dollar sign is the the value that's given to the jQuery Library when it loads up so anytime you you want to reference jQuery you hit dollar um so we go document and then we go ready and you just got to memorize this you'll later on understand what it's about and then you do this function thing function open and close parentheses uh open and close curly braces and then close your first parentheses honestly what I did when I started off is I copied and pasted this and saved it somewhere because it just didn't make sense to me and you don't want to have to think about it just paste this in your jQuery code always goes inside of a document ready function you can have multiple document ready functions there's really no need to if you just have a few lines of code but they're not going to conflict what this does is this says hey wait for my whole document to load up before I try running any JavaScript otherwise you're going to try to talk to panel one with JavaScript and panel one hasn't loaded yet so the javascript's going to run it's not going to find panel one it won't do anything and then panel one will load and it's not going to do what you're expecting it to do and you probably won't even get any errors about it it just says nothing happens so the document ready function says hey wait for my document to fully load then let's start running stuff so your jqu goes in here there's also a short way of doing it and that's just dollar function so that's what I use that's what most people use but you can do document ready function they're the same thing so now that we've done that and now that I've probably confused you from the start that's the only complicated part the

milliseconds you'll see it kind of does a little animation there for me and then it's chainable Jake c is awesome and that you can keep chaining it as long as it's not the semicolon yet so I can hide it and then I can show it over the course of one second so it hides fast and then it shows slowly and you can just keep going you can do hide show hide show there you go go hio hio it's fun jQuery is tons of fun another thing you can do is slide up and just as you'd expect it slides up and then it hides and then you can have it slide down up and then back down you can also add a delay in there delay so we're going to delay for 1 second which is 1,000 milliseconds wait a little bit and then we'll do it again jQuery it's fun this is super awesome so I can have it slide up delay you can do fade in fade out there it goes and gone and then it's going to slide down um another thing you can do is you can do Fade toggle you can do toggle for pretty much anything so if I do Fade toggle twice then it'll fade out since it's currently in and then it'll fade in because it's currently out toggle will well it'll toggle you can slide toggle it's going to slide up and it's going to slide back down and then you can just do toggle if you just want it to do a hide a show hide so that's kind of the showing and hiding parts of uh jQuery super super fun you can go. CSS this is where it gets a little bit more tricky and then you give it a pair of curly braces which are options and I'm actually you can go color red and then oh red is not defined you have to do it in uh quotes sorry about that there you go and now my color became red uh this one has something else overwriting it but there you go the panel one gets a color of red and then I can do a comma here and I can go font weight the one thing you can't do I'll show you in a second font weight bold there we go font weight bold the one thing you can't do is you can't do font Dash weight because in JavaScript this means font minus weight which it looks for Math and doesn't make sense and we'll throw an error ah that doesn't make sense uh what you can do is you can wrap that in quotes if you want to do it that way single or double quotes and that works or jQuery is smart enough to where you can go font weight so there you go I can change the CSS um and it's a little confusing this is kind of a cleaner way of doing it we're making what's called a JavaScript object if you want to Google that so anytime you do curly braces in JavaScript it's making an object unless you have function before it which is really that's for a JavaScript lesson so now I can go color red and add a comma font weight bold now it's starting to feel a little bit more like CSS and I can go display none and just in case I didn't want to see it anymore which is basically what a jQuery show hide does so there we go panel one uh so let's make panel one high and then let's make panel 2 CSS opacity 0.5 so now when I boot up that's gone and that's halfway hidden and at from this point we'll call this a lesson and what will the next step will be in the next lesson is to listen to events the real fun of JavaScript happens when you start interacting with what the user does those are called JavaScript events when they click do this when they hover do this um and when they Mouse up do that so that's really where jQuery gets even more fun we'll stop right here so you can watch it over if I've done too much too fast if you've kept up with a pretty fast pace here let's go on to lesson number two
