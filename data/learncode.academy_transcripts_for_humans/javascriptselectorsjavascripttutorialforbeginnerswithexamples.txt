00:00 - so in this lesson we're going to be
00:03 - taking lots of that fun JavaScript code
00:04 - we've been learning and we're going to
00:05 - have more fun by actually applying it to
00:07 - a real webpage I've got this kind of
00:10 - really basic web page here and we're
00:12 - going to be using javascript to real
00:14 - time make some changes to it so here's
00:16 - kind of some of the HTML elements that I
00:18 - have going on I've got a couple
00:19 - paragraph tags and h4 I have a UL with
00:22 - some allies so let's use JavaScript to
00:24 - real time change this page I'm going to
00:26 - go to my console I've got it pretty big
00:27 - and blown up because we're going to be
00:29 - doing this whole lesson in the console
00:30 - so the first thing to know about how you
00:32 - interact with your HTML document here is
00:36 - there's a document object on the page so
00:39 - you can see this is an actual JavaScript
00:41 - representation of my webpage it's called
00:44 - the Dom the document object model and
00:48 - that's basically how you access your
00:50 - HTML and CSS through JavaScript and so
00:53 - this document object model has an API
00:55 - force it has some API methods we can
00:57 - access I can go documents dot gets
01:01 - elements by tag name so you notice I did
01:05 - elements plural here because we can have
01:07 - more than one element with the same tag
01:09 - name and let's grab all of our
01:10 - paragraphs P and I just need to enter
01:15 - string in here can be single or double
01:16 - quotes I'm going to look for anything
01:18 - with a P tag and there you go I have an
01:20 - array of two elements I have my first
01:22 - paragraph tag in my second paragraph tag
01:24 - how about we look for anything with an
01:26 - h1 there you go there's my h1 so it
01:28 - gives me an array and so then I can
01:30 - actually do what we would do so let's
01:32 - look at my P I can go array 0 which is
01:36 - going to give me only the first one in
01:38 - the array or I can actually save these
01:41 - as a variable I can go there P tags
01:44 - equals documents that gets elements by
01:49 - tag name P there you go so now P tags
01:54 - the variable equals these two awesome
01:57 - and I can go first P tag equals P tags 0
02:03 - so now my first P tag variable I can
02:05 - pass these around just like I can any
02:07 - other variables so now anytime I go
02:10 - first P tag it's always going to point
02:13 - to this pair
02:13 - graff sweet let's look at some of these
02:15 - other selector methods we got going on
02:17 - here so I got documents document dot get
02:23 - elements well you can actually just see
02:25 - them if you type get right there you've
02:27 - got get elements plural by class name
02:29 - and that would be LM and by there you go
02:35 - and that'll just be the class name you
02:37 - want I have a class name done that's
02:39 - this guy right here you see I have one
02:40 - li we've done you can get element
02:43 - singular by ID since there is only one
02:47 - element allowed with each ID
02:49 - I think this yeah this ul is called
02:51 - checklist there you go so that's that
02:54 - guy with ID of checklist and that's kind
02:58 - of pretty much it now if you are using
03:00 - anything ie 8 or newer definitely if
03:03 - you're using IE 9 or newer there's a
03:04 - great one called document dot query
03:08 - selector which is awesome because then
03:11 - you can just use any selector you want
03:14 - just as you would with CSS so I can go
03:16 - dot done anything with a class of done I
03:18 - can do a hash tag and look for anything
03:21 - with an ID hash tag checklist there we
03:24 - go and document query selector will
03:26 - always just give me the first thing that
03:28 - comes up it will not search the entire
03:30 - document oh just give me the first one
03:31 - it finds if I want everything then I go
03:34 - query selector all and then I'll just
03:38 - search for P tags and that will just
03:40 - give me any paragraph tags right there
03:43 - in NR a so those two are cool and you
03:46 - know I mentioned that you can't use this
03:47 - in all browsers one of the quirks to
03:49 - JavaScript
03:49 - just like CSS is newer browsers support
03:53 - newer features older browsers do not
03:55 - support them so there's a great website
03:57 - called can I use com you can see right
04:00 - here I typed in query selector and I can
04:02 - see what all browsers supports what I'm
04:05 - wanting to use the only one that has
04:07 - partial support here is IE 8 it's not
04:10 - going to work with css3 selectors
04:11 - because IE 8 does not support those and
04:14 - also html5 tags you know tags like main
04:20 - and footer you know might have some
04:22 - trouble with that so you'll always want
04:23 - to test your JavaScript code if you
04:25 - don't get a full green light
04:27 - on the browsers that you're supporting
04:29 - stinks I know and it's always ie that's
04:32 - a problem but hey what are you going to
04:33 - do that's the internet things change so
04:35 - there's basically your document
04:38 - searching methods so let's do some fun
04:41 - stuff here let's say I want to change
04:43 - the HTML for this paragraph did I call
04:46 - that first P tag yes so first P tag
04:48 - still points to this paragraph so now I
04:50 - can go first P tag dot enter HTML and I
04:55 - can actually change the inner HTML
04:56 - equals new paragraph now it's not really
05:01 - a new paragraph but new paragraph
05:03 - contents there you go if I could spell
05:06 - content in new paragraph content there
05:09 - goes so real time I just changed it
05:10 - let's say I want to actually add a new
05:12 - element inside of there a new paragraph
05:15 - strong content I can actually type text
05:21 - and it will turn it into HTML tags which
05:24 - is pretty cool I can also do stuff with
05:26 - classes so let's look at that li right
05:29 - there that's got done so let's call that
05:31 - very Li equals documents dots man I'm
05:36 - not typing document very well tonight
05:37 - you're just going to have to bear with
05:39 - me on that one document query selector
05:44 - I'm only going to do query selector
05:46 - because I just want the first one with a
05:47 - done class so there we go so Li now
05:51 - equals that guy so I can go li dot class
05:54 - name and there you go my class name is
05:57 - done so let's go class name equals
06:01 - nothing so now my class equals nothing
06:04 - I have no classes assigned and the
06:06 - strikethrough is gone so let's go li
06:09 - class name let's add done back there we
06:12 - go let's add a second class name to it
06:15 - done also done let's say I have another
06:18 - class called also done it didn't do
06:20 - anything because that there's no CSS for
06:22 - that let's say I want to set it back to
06:25 - just done let's say I want to take I
06:29 - have an amount of classes I don't know
06:31 - how many classes I have let's say class
06:33 - name is done also done also so let's say
06:37 - Li dot class name has a lot of classes I
06:39 - don't exactly know what all they are
06:41 - I just want to add a new one to it I can
06:44 - go Li class name let me go and clear
06:46 - this out here li class name equals Li
06:48 - dot class name so let's take let's say
06:52 - it equals what it already is plus let's
06:55 - add a space and add a new one special
06:57 - there we go so now it's going to say hey
07:01 - let's it now equals what we equaled
07:03 - before plus this more stuff so now
07:07 - that's my class list right there pretty
07:09 - cool well add a class name equals
07:13 - nothing all classes are gone again so
07:15 - that's that's pretty nice it's kind of a
07:17 - pain in the rear to do a lot of stuff
07:20 - with classes beyond that if you want to
07:23 - do a lot of adding removing classes like
07:25 - let's say I wanted to just remove also
07:27 - done let me actually copy and paste this
07:30 - and add this back in Li dot class name
07:34 - equals there you go let's say I just
07:38 - want to remove also done well there's
07:39 - kind of like some hacky ways you can do
07:41 - it I can go li dot class name equals Li
07:44 - class name dot replace let's say I want
07:50 - to replace also done with which is the
07:54 - second argument replace is kind of cool
07:57 - you can do do replace on anything that's
07:58 - text strings I'm going to replace this
08:01 - with nothing so there we go so now I
08:04 - have an extra space in there but that's
08:06 - still going to work in browsers it's
08:08 - kind of hacky and that it's not clean
08:10 - because then if I added another class
08:12 - and removed it ten times I get a whole
08:14 - lot of spaces in there but that's going
08:16 - to work and so if you want to do a lot
08:18 - more besides just a little bit of adding
08:20 - and changing you'll want to look into
08:22 - jQuery I've got a full jQuery course
08:24 - jQuery makes it really easy for you to
08:26 - do a lot of this stuff and I'll leave it
08:29 - at that
08:29 - I'll put some links for jQuery out there
08:31 - let's look at maybe one more thing let's
08:36 - go ahead and look at okay so there's
08:38 - this class loot there's this class class
08:42 - list thing you can see if I do class
08:45 - list I actually have a list of all my
08:48 - classes one two three it's an actual
08:50 - array now if I go to can I use and type
08:52 - class list it's kind of depressing
08:56 - it's not supported for ie8 or ie9 it's
09:00 - not fully supported with IE 10 or even
09:04 - IE 11 so that's coming classlist is
09:07 - going to be really cool because you can
09:08 - do stuff like classless add new so now i
09:13 - can look at li class list and it's got
09:15 - new super cool I can go class list
09:18 - remove let's take new away and now if I
09:22 - look at class list new is gone so better
09:26 - support is coming to JavaScript natively
09:28 - but if you want to do it in the meantime
09:29 - you're going to want to use a library if
09:31 - you're using jQuery it's super easy I
09:34 - would just do something like this I'd
09:37 - look up my class for done and I do add
09:40 - class new and that's how jQuery works
09:44 - I'll leave it for that I've got a whole
09:45 - series on jQuery which you'll love um
09:48 - and that's pretty much it there's you
09:52 - know that's how you'll select stuff
09:54 - that's how you'll add stuff you can also
09:56 - navigate up all let's look at that li
09:59 - again so I can go Li dot parent node
10:02 - parent element and element and that's
10:07 - going to be the UL that it's a part of
10:08 - so let's say if I want ul Li dot parent
10:11 - element dot parent element that's going
10:14 - to be going up the tree some more so now
10:16 - I'm at main and you can see main has the
10:19 - UL in it and that you will has the Li in
10:21 - it let's say I'm on this Li and I want
10:24 - to find then this guy right here well
10:27 - then I can go li dot parent element dot
10:31 - children there you go dot children and
10:36 - that's going to be all the children of
10:38 - my parent element now once again
10:40 - children's got a quirk to it it works
10:43 - safely ie 9 plus ie 8 back can have some
10:47 - quirks but that works really well so
10:50 - then I can go li parent element children
10:53 - zero and that's going to be that apples
10:55 - guy so let's say I want to change u
10:58 - equals what will you be Frank
11:04 - there you go so now Frank oranges
11:06 - bananas and watermelon so that's enough
11:08 - on selectors for now then the next video
11:10 - we're going to cover how you can
11:12 - actually listen to what the user does
11:14 - and change stuff real time so hope this
11:17 - lesson helped you out

Cleaned transcript:

so in this lesson we're going to be taking lots of that fun JavaScript code we've been learning and we're going to have more fun by actually applying it to a real webpage I've got this kind of really basic web page here and we're going to be using javascript to real time make some changes to it so here's kind of some of the HTML elements that I have going on I've got a couple paragraph tags and h4
