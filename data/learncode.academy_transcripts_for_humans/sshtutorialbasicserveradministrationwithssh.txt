00:01 - hey there so in some upcoming videos I'm
00:03 - going to be showing some node server
00:06 - Administration we're going to set up an
00:08 - engine X load balancer um we're going to
00:13 - deploy some nodejs applications into the
00:16 - wild uh but to do that you got to be
00:18 - comfortable with SSH um and so this
00:20 - video is going to kind of cover that if
00:22 - you're comfortable with SSH this video
00:23 - is not really for you uh but a lot of
00:26 - devs have not really gone further than
00:27 - GitHub when it comes to SSH so this
00:30 - video is going to get into it and show
00:32 - you how fun and uh just powerful it is
00:35 - so basically SSH just opens up a secure
00:37 - shell to another machine usually it's
00:41 - going to be a Linux machine uh and it
00:44 - just basically gets you into the
00:45 - terminal of that machine so I can go SSH
00:48 - will which is my username at um superc
00:52 - cars.com which is a fake uh machine but
00:56 - uh that I've created but basically
00:57 - superc cars.com is going to point to an
01:00 - IP address of an actual real machine
01:02 - sitting somewhere uh so if I SSH into
01:04 - that I'm basically logging into that
01:06 - machine as the will User it's going to
01:08 - ask for my password um and there you go
01:11 - I'm now will at supercars so I'm
01:13 - actually on that machine um logged into
01:15 - the will user directory uh so I can do
01:19 - everything on this machine just as if I
01:21 - was actually there um I can install
01:23 - things let's say git is not currently
01:25 - installed so I can do pseudo
01:28 - appg install get
01:30 - um apt git is basically linux's npm or
01:33 - node package manager or Homebrew it
01:36 - allows you to install programs from the
01:38 - command line um so I can just do this
01:41 - and now get is installed so I can now
01:44 - let me find a gist I can now get
01:48 - clone there you go I can now clone a
01:50 - gist that I wrote the other day and
01:52 - there we go I have uh get repository on
01:56 - my machine so it's actually great for
01:58 - deployments if you want to clone your
02:00 - directory and pull your master branch
02:03 - and this is your actual web server there
02:05 - you go let's say you want to install
02:07 - MySQL PHP whatever uh you're on the
02:10 - machine you can configure and
02:12 - administrate your machine um all through
02:15 - SSH it's really great um you can also
02:17 - copy files um using
02:20 - rsync so let me show you what I have
02:22 - here I exited by the way exit is the
02:24 - command to get out of you'll notice when
02:26 - I hit exit I left that machine and I'm
02:29 - back on my machine now which has my kind
02:31 - of custom bash script here um so you can
02:35 - use rsync let me show you I have these
02:37 - three files in my directory um and I can
02:40 - rsync uh- AV is the one and by the way
02:43 - all these commands I'm going to put them
02:45 - in a gist uh and put it in the
02:47 - description so I don't just show you a
02:49 - bunch of stuff and then leave you
02:50 - hanging but I can rsync AV dot is my
02:53 - current directory so I'm going to do all
02:55 - the files in this directory will atup
02:58 - cars.com
03:00 - and then colon because I'm going to
03:01 - actually give it a path to do that I'm
03:02 - going to go home directory slne app it's
03:07 - going to ask for my password that's kind
03:09 - of annoying I'm going to show you how to
03:10 - do password list um SSH here in a second
03:13 - but you see I created the directory home
03:15 - will new app and I copied all these
03:17 - files there let's actually ssh in and
03:20 - see if that did
03:21 - it and need's my password again there we
03:24 - go we have new app so I can go CD space
03:26 - new app and do directory listing and
03:29 - there you go there's my files so that's
03:31 - kind of actually a quick and dirty way
03:32 - to do it a deployment if you want to you
03:34 - can just rsync all your files straight
03:37 - to your server and now your web server
03:40 - is updated with your new files it sure
03:42 - beats FTP it's pretty dirty it'd be
03:44 - better to actually do push it to a
03:47 - GitHub repo log in and do a poll from
03:51 - that repo or even better use a
03:52 - deployment software like Capistrano
03:55 - which we'll get into in the future uh in
03:57 - some videos there's definitely better
03:58 - deployment strategy but R sync sure
04:01 - beats uh FTP um let me actually RM I'm
04:04 - going to delete main.css here let's get
04:08 - out and I'm going to rsync again and
04:11 - then you'll notice all it did was copy
04:13 - main.css because rsync is actually going
04:15 - to sync up it's going to find out what
04:17 - it needs to do it's only going to move
04:19 - the files it needs to move the files
04:20 - that were changed once again super beats
04:23 - FTP so if you're looking for a quick and
04:25 - dirty deployment there you go uh just
04:27 - rsync that thing uh but we'll get into
04:30 - better things later on let's show you
04:32 - real quick how to do a password list SSH
04:35 - uh you probably had to do this when you
04:37 - got setup on GitHub is you had to make
04:39 - an SSH key um what a key pair is is
04:43 - you've got your public key and you've
04:46 - got your private key when you generate
04:48 - it it will create both like say you Cate
04:50 - create a key called ID RSA which is
04:53 - standard um it's going to do ID RSA
04:56 - which is your private key and it's going
04:58 - to do ID RSA Pub you're going to copy
05:01 - the contents of this to the server and
05:04 - the pub and you're going to move it to
05:05 - the authorized Keys file and then the
05:08 - server knows that this ID RSA key is
05:13 - accepted in place of a password so this
05:16 - is the one you want to protect with your
05:17 - life uh because anybody with this file
05:20 - can access your server that has this
05:22 - file installed so what we're going to do
05:24 - is we're going to install this right
05:26 - here onto our server and then anytime we
05:28 - have this key we can connect without a
05:30 - password uh so to do that we just go to
05:32 - our user folder and go to SSH directory
05:36 - if that's not there you're going to have
05:37 - to create it um and then whoops I just
05:42 - made one called SSH without the dot so
05:45 - you're going to make a directory called
05:48 - SSH which it says um it's already there
05:52 - so um and then if you don't see an ID
05:56 - RSA file which I just deleted mine
05:58 - you're going to want to generate one
05:59 - that's easy SSH key gen and then the
06:02 - only thing you're going to want to do is
06:04 - capital c and you're going to want to
06:06 - give it a comment that kind of
06:07 - differentiates it to you usually just do
06:10 - your email
06:14 - address there we go um and then it's
06:16 - going to say you want to make it this
06:17 - file ID RSA sure hit enter uh passphrase
06:21 - I'm going to do no passphrase so if I
06:23 - hit LS now I have ID RSA and IDs a.ub
06:27 - you're going to open this and you're
06:29 - going to copy the contents to your
06:30 - clipboard or if you want to do it the
06:33 - quick way you can go cat ID rs. Pub pipe
06:37 - PB copy so I'm going to copy that to my
06:41 - clipboard and now I'm going to SSH will
06:45 - at superc cars.com
06:48 - again I'm getting tired of type in my
06:50 - password so now we are going to go into
06:53 - my SSH folder it doesn't exist so I'm
06:56 - going to actually make
06:57 - it and then I'm going to get into it and
07:00 - I'm going to use Nano which is kind of
07:02 - like a command line text editor there's
07:05 - Nano emac and Vim which are kind of the
07:08 - three popular ones my favorite is vim
07:10 - although it's the most complicated uh
07:12 - Nano is the easiest so if you're not
07:14 - used to it use Nano I'm going to Nano a
07:18 - file called
07:19 - authorized unor Keys uh which it may
07:23 - already exist if it already exists this
07:25 - will open it if it doesn't exist Nano
07:27 - will create it I can now paste in my key
07:30 - Contents I can exit and I can save um
07:34 - which by the way let me show you what I
07:36 - was doing here I did crl X to exit one
07:39 - thing that's nice about Nano is it gives
07:40 - you like kind of a menu at the bottom uh
07:43 - crl X and then y to save and it says hit
07:47 - enter yep so now if I hit LS I have a
07:50 - file called authorized keys and in that
07:53 - is my ID RSA Pub you can add 30
07:56 - different keys if you want so 30
07:58 - different people can all s H into your
08:01 - uh machine without a password I can now
08:04 - hit exit and now let me go back to my
08:07 - folder that I was in code
08:11 - sandbox I think it was just SSH there we
08:14 - go so now let me pull up that rsync
08:16 - command
08:18 - again there we go and now it does not
08:21 - ask for a password I can also go SSH
08:24 - will at superc
08:26 - cars.com and it didn't ask for a
08:28 - password so now I can create Like A bash
08:30 - script that did 50 different things on
08:33 - my server and it wouldn't need a
08:35 - password for it I could run one command
08:37 - that runs the script and it does this
08:39 - whole server script so when you've seen
08:41 - bash scripting that's pretty much a lot
08:44 - of times along the lines of the things
08:46 - you're looking at doing uh but that's
08:49 - pretty much ssh in a nutshell it allows
08:52 - you to securely connect to another
08:54 - server run some commands on it
08:56 - administrate that server um and in the
08:58 - next video we're going to show you how
09:00 - to create your own Linux server on your
09:03 - machine using vagrant uh and virtual box
09:06 - and so you can mess with and get to know
09:08 - server Administration better without
09:11 - blowing up your actual live web server
09:13 - or someone else's live web server so
09:15 - let's get into that next video which is
09:17 - on vagrant

Cleaned transcript:

hey there so in some upcoming videos I'm going to be showing some node server Administration we're going to set up an engine X load balancer um we're going to deploy some nodejs applications into the
