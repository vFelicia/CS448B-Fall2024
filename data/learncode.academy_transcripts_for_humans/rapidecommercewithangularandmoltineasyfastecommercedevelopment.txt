00:01 - okay so we're going to have a lot of fun
00:02 - in this video we are going to be rapidly
00:05 - building an e-commerce platform with
00:08 - angular um and molten we're actually
00:11 - going to be using the yman angular
00:13 - generator because that's going to
00:15 - automatically scaffold out routes and
00:17 - stuff for us and then we're also going
00:19 - to be using Molt's e-commerce API which
00:21 - I covered in another video super cool
00:23 - tool that's going to let us build any
00:25 - kind of app we want in just a matter of
00:27 - seconds um so go ahead and download
00:29 - those two tools if you're going to
00:30 - follow along and here we go we're going
00:33 - to start by I've already done an npm
00:35 - install G yo for Yan um I also have
00:39 - grunt installed globally and I have
00:42 - Bower installed yo globally yally and
00:45 - then I've also installed uh an
00:48 - generator
00:50 - angular uh because that's our angular
00:52 - generator so those three are installed
00:54 - and so now I can make a
00:57 - directory that's going to be let's just
00:59 - call this
01:02 - storefronts and so now I just go yo
01:07 - angular what I like to use SAS with
01:09 - compass yes I like SAS yes I like
01:11 - bootstrap yes I like SAS with bootstrap
01:15 - I'm just going to say yes to all those
01:17 - and now it's going to install everything
01:18 - for me I'm going to be right back
01:20 - because I'm not going to make you watch
01:21 - my
01:23 - install okay there we go that took about
01:26 - a minute and the install finished so
01:28 - let's go ahead and go
01:30 - Sublime into this folder and see what we
01:33 - got so it's scaffolded out oh one more
01:35 - thing we have to do is we have to go bow
01:37 - install now that it scaffolded all that
01:40 - out for us so that's going to install
01:42 - all the bower modules that were in our
01:45 - where is that in our bower.json so it
01:48 - installed all those so it's given us an
01:50 - app here's our index.html that it built
01:53 - out for
01:54 - us and you see that we basically just
01:56 - have an about controller and a main
01:58 - controller uh so let's let's go ahead
02:00 - and use that generator to now scaffold
02:03 - out some routes for us we can go yo
02:05 - angular route let's build a store
02:10 - Route there you go let's also build a
02:13 - let's say the store is going to be all
02:15 - categories so then they click on a
02:17 - category let's build a category
02:20 - route then they click on a product so
02:22 - let's click on a
02:24 - product product route and then let's do
02:27 - a cart route let's see if we can get
02:30 - that far I don't want to take an
02:30 - incredible amount of your time but I
02:32 - know we can at least get to cart here in
02:33 - just a few minutes so there we go now we
02:36 - have a lot more files we've included
02:38 - we've included our store JS our category
02:40 - JS product
02:42 - cart I'm just going to add I'm going to
02:44 - go these top links and I'm just going to
02:47 - make change about to
02:51 - store delete contact who needs to
02:54 - contact the store okay so there we go
02:57 - now all I have to do is go grunt serve
03:00 - that's going to open up a live reloading
03:02 - web page for us in
03:07 - Chrome uh should be any second now cool
03:10 - all right there we go so home and store
03:12 - this is the store view so if you look at
03:14 - app scripts um app also has now all of
03:18 - our routes this is what our generator
03:20 - did when we did our route generation we
03:22 - created a store a category product it
03:26 - Maps them to the controller create our
03:28 - controllers for us and created our views
03:30 - for us so we basically have a full app
03:34 - now we just have to connect it to Molten
03:36 - I love the angular generator one thing
03:38 - I've learned about yman generators take
03:40 - the time to find the generators you like
03:42 - take the time to learn them and you're
03:44 - going to get that time back 100 fold uh
03:47 - so if you remember from the molten video
03:49 - you have to authenticate first before
03:51 - you make API calls so this is a little
03:53 - bit tricky in angular what we have to do
03:55 - is we have to now make a service there's
03:58 - probably three or four ways you could do
04:00 - this in angular but I'm going to do it
04:01 - with the service I think it's the
04:03 - simplest
04:04 - way you can't see but I'm making a
04:06 - folder called Services down here when
04:08 - the font's zoomed in you can't see in
04:11 - Sublime what's going on down there and
04:13 - let me go ahead and make a new file in
04:15 - here and let's save this as mol.
04:18 - JS uh so now I'm just going to make a
04:20 - service module here
04:23 - angular let uh let's not call it molon
04:26 - let's see with this app it's called
04:27 - storefront app so let's go ahead and go
04:30 - storefront app. Molton I like this stuff
04:33 - that's not 100% about just my app to be
04:36 - its own module name uh so no
04:40 - dependencies on
04:42 - you and let's do a
04:46 - factory and let's call this molten off
04:49 - maybe yeah there you go so there we go
04:53 - and what I'm going to do here is I'm
04:56 - going to if you remember I have to
04:58 - basically do I'm going to copy this I
05:01 - have this copied over here the molten
05:02 - stuff I need to do you create a new
05:04 - molten
05:05 - object then molten do
05:10 - off
05:12 - authenticate and there you go what that
05:15 - does is that authenticates and then you
05:18 - can do any molten stuff within here uh
05:21 - so what I'm actually going to do is I
05:22 - need to kind of wait for that to
05:24 - authenticate and then return an
05:27 - authenticated object so I'm going to use
05:29 - CU for that and I'm going to create a
05:31 - promise if you don't know about promises
05:33 - I do have a video on promises um and so
05:36 - I'll put the link to that I think I have
05:39 - a video on promises um so we're going to
05:41 - go ver
05:43 - deferred equals q. defer so what I've
05:47 - done is I've kind of made a promised
05:48 - object right here a deferred object and
05:50 - so that's going to be what I
05:53 - return defer do promise I'm going to
05:56 - return the promise of that now you're
05:58 - you might feel confused here for about 2
06:00 - minutes stick with me till we get this
06:02 - first route done and it's all going to
06:04 - make a lot of sense and then we get to
06:05 - copy paste so I'm going to do is I'm
06:08 - going to authenticate first I'm
06:10 - returning instantly This Promise the
06:13 - promise is not resolved with anything so
06:15 - when molten authenticates then I'm going
06:18 - to
06:20 - resolve with the molten object that's
06:22 - been authenticated this object right
06:24 - here so this is what's ultimately going
06:27 - to get returned when people require
06:29 - molten off so there's my
06:32 - Factory uh one thing I have to do is I
06:35 - have to now add since I did not generate
06:37 - that factory I have to add that in
06:39 - myself let's go
06:41 - Services mol. JS and I also have to add
06:44 - that molten API
06:47 - Library js. mol.com
06:50 - V1 so I'm going to go ahead and save
06:53 - this uh file save as save page as let's
06:58 - go code
07:00 - what's that called storefront app
07:03 - scripts let's make a folder called
07:05 - vendor and let's call this
07:08 - molon
07:10 - min.js yes use JS I'm not a
07:14 - fool and then let's add this maybe right
07:17 - here after
07:18 - angular so
07:21 - scripts
07:24 - vendor what I call it Molton do min.js
07:27 - so now Molt's on my page and that molten
07:30 - service is on my page let's save this
07:33 - see if I have any errors here okay I
07:35 - still am seeing the store view so that's
07:37 - good um I'm not seeing a m molten Min
07:41 - app looks like they have Source mapping
07:43 - on that I'm just going to drop that off
07:45 - because I don't want to see Source
07:47 - mapping error that error is not a
07:49 - problem but I don't want to see it um so
07:52 - there we go now I'm loading my store
07:53 - view so now I can make in my app you see
07:57 - I've got these routes created I can now
08:00 - make molten API calls here in my app so
08:04 - let's go to the store view this will be
08:06 - where we view all categories we're going
08:09 - to do a resolve so before we load our
08:11 - store view we need to resolve a few
08:14 - promises we'll call this one
08:19 - categories um and then this will will
08:23 - require molten
08:25 - o wh molten o I believe let's see if
08:28 - that's what it was called molten o yeah
08:31 - so now once again so our Factory molten
08:33 - o is going to return a promise that gets
08:36 - resolved with a good molten object so
08:39 - let's also load in Q so we're going to
08:41 - do is q. when molten O So when molten O
08:47 - resolves
08:49 - then we're going to be able to do stuff
08:51 - in here so that resolves with the Molton
08:54 - objects if you remember we resolved
08:57 - right here we passed in Molten so molten
09:00 - is what gets passed into our function
09:02 - now we can make our molten
09:05 - calls molten category list and this
09:08 - seems like a lot of code but once we get
09:10 - this in we get to copy paste so it's
09:12 - really not a lot once we get this first
09:14 - one done we're going to be able to do a
09:17 - lot of stuff really fast so we're going
09:19 - to list our
09:21 - categories
09:22 - categories and then I actually want to
09:25 - do another resolve here don't
09:27 - I so what I'm I'm going to have to do
09:30 - here is Q let's make
09:33 - a exact same thing we did for our o q.
09:39 - defer and then I'm going to go
09:42 - deferred do resolve
09:45 - categories and then I'm going to return
09:48 - that deferred
09:51 - promise okay so once again I'm making a
09:54 - deferred and I'm returning that so I'm
09:56 - returning this as categories and angular
09:58 - is going going to wait until this
10:00 - promise resolves with our categories so
10:03 - there we go we're going to have all our
10:04 - categories in uh let's go to the
10:07 - controller that it generated for us what
10:09 - are we calling this store yep we're on
10:12 - store let's require
10:16 - categories so categories is going to
10:19 - require this guy right here which is our
10:22 - whole categories process we just
10:25 - did scope.
10:27 - categories equals
10:30 - categories and let's console log
10:32 - categories as well so we can see
10:36 - that uh let's go ahead and refresh here
10:38 - and go to
10:39 - store unknown provider categories uhoh I
10:44 - hate it when you get these things ah I
10:46 - know what I did wrong I did not
10:49 - add since I made a new module I did not
10:52 - make my app require that module yet
10:55 - angular I do that a lot that's that's
10:58 - something I do a lot when I'm doing
10:59 - angular stuff I'll add a module I'll add
11:02 - it to my HTML and I'll for forget to
11:04 - make my app require it so now we're good
11:07 - you can see my object is right here boom
11:10 - I've got one
11:11 - uncategorized I've got one category
11:14 - called
11:15 - uncategorized so let's go ahead and make
11:18 - that spit it out on the page now let's
11:21 - go to our views our store view so if you
11:24 - remember I made scope categories
11:27 - categories um what do we actually want
11:29 - to print out here the ID is that and the
11:33 - title is what we're looking at so let's
11:35 - go back to our story
11:39 - HTML categories I'll just do a list for
11:42 - now don't want to bore you
11:44 - guys this will be an NG
11:48 - repeat let's go cat in
11:55 - categories so this will be cat. tile
11:59 - Some people prefer the spaces here some
12:00 - people don't I don't really care and
12:03 - this hrf will
12:05 - be uh what is it actually this is ngre
12:09 - because we're going to do some
12:10 - templating in
12:12 - here pound
12:15 - SL
12:19 - category and then it'll be cat. ID I
12:23 - kind of prefer spaces when it's there
12:25 - and I don't like spaces when it's here
12:26 - in a URL because it makes it feel m
12:28 - passive so let's see if that worked here
12:30 - there we go uncategorized and that takes
12:33 - us to a URL that's not working yet so
12:35 - there we go category cat ID let's go and
12:38 - build out our categories now actually
12:40 - let's make sure this works so I go to
12:42 - store categories let me go to my
12:45 - Forge
12:52 - molon let's go ahead and log in to will
12:55 - store add a category make sure this is
12:59 - working here
13:00 - inventory
13:05 - categories create a
13:07 - category no parent
13:10 - category awesome
13:14 - category oh I need a description
13:17 - St awesome
13:25 - category there we go so there's my
13:27 - categories and now if I load up here I
13:29 - should see two awesome category and
13:31 - uncategorized awesome it is real time
13:34 - connecting to my store so let's go ahead
13:35 - and build out that category
13:38 - route it's going to be really simple I
13:41 - just copy and paste that whole
13:45 - resolve and instead of categories this
13:47 - will be
13:51 - products um when molon off then product
13:57 - list
13:59 - category equals and then this will be
14:01 - the ID of our category uh so what we
14:04 - need to do here is we need to do route
14:07 - we need to get that route Pam off there
14:10 - route current I think it's
14:13 - pams do ID so we're going to make this
14:16 - category slash ID so we just want to go
14:19 - to slash category we need to go to a
14:21 - specific category every time so
14:24 - categoryid that will be route. current.
14:27 - prams doid
14:29 - we're going to list that this should
14:32 - work let's go ahead and re refresh this
14:36 - guy so there we go that worked and let's
14:38 - go into our
14:40 - category
14:43 - controller
14:49 - products products you know what I also
14:51 - want to get the
14:57 - category
14:59 - so let's go back to that and we're going
15:03 - to also do the
15:07 - category love those Sublime Text
15:09 - multiple cursors Apple D um let's go
15:13 - category I believe it's
15:16 - doget I think I can just go ID like
15:21 - that so that should work let's see if
15:25 - that all works for us okay it's not
15:27 - resolving
15:29 - um it's not instantiating okay so let's
15:32 - try up unexpected identifier got a
15:35 - problem
15:36 - here ah no
15:43 - comma so there we go category view is
15:45 - resolving so that's good we should have
15:49 - a
15:50 - category and a products in there so
15:53 - let's go to our view and add
15:57 - them
15:59 - and this is category.
16:01 - tile since our category object is in
16:04 - there and again we'll just do an Li yeah
16:07 - I'm actually going to go over to store
16:09 - copy and
16:16 - paste prod in
16:18 - products and this will go to
16:22 - products prod.
16:25 - ID prod. tile let's see if this works
16:30 - hey we got our three products sweet see
16:32 - how it's going a lot faster so far our
16:34 - uncategorized category and then we've
16:37 - got our products I'm not messing with
16:39 - any design yet let's go to a single
16:42 - product and then maybe we'll do an add
16:44 - cart and a cart for those of you guys
16:46 - who totally want to keep following along
16:49 - um any you guys at this point you can
16:51 - probably realize wow you're going to be
16:53 - able to build out a whole shopping cart
16:54 - in a day um so definitely go just get
16:57 - the free to your molten thing Try It Out
17:01 - Try building an angular app or a
17:02 - Javascript app with just HTML you're
17:04 - going to like it I'm going to go ahead
17:06 - and add a product and an add to cart and
17:08 - then we'll call it because we're
17:09 - probably looking at about 20 minutes 30
17:11 - minutes by
17:12 - then let's go ahead we're on the product
17:15 - view so I'm going to copy the category
17:17 - resolve seems the most likely
17:21 - one um products we want the
17:27 - products and then this one will also
17:29 - have an ID
17:31 - required that one's got the route
17:33 - injected then we're going to do product.
17:36 - get we're getting that product yep
17:39 - that's all we need copy paste so let's
17:42 - go do that
17:43 - uh product controller requires
17:47 - product scope. product equals product
17:52 - it's a lot of product and so now we
17:54 - should be able to
17:55 - [Music]
17:57 - go
18:03 - and then let's let's console log this so
18:05 - we can kind of get a look at what look
18:07 - at what that product object looks
18:14 - like bearded man Strikes Back like it um
18:19 - let's see it looks like I got a problem
18:21 - in here somewhere unknown provider
18:24 - products product control I must have
18:26 - made a typo in there
18:29 - let me look at this
18:30 - guy oh I know what the problem is this
18:33 - is not in a resolve ah hate it when it's
18:36 - something it's always something silly
18:38 - like that isn't
18:48 - it there we go that's going to work cuz
18:52 - it
18:52 - works unexpected token well now there's
18:55 - unexpected token somewhere where is that
18:59 - okay accidentally typed
19:05 - you and there we go we've got our
19:07 - product bearded man Strikes Back uh
19:10 - we've got our description your beards
19:11 - will grow twice as long listening to
19:14 - these Homeless looking guys rock your
19:15 - face off with a banjo okay so we want to
19:18 - print that
19:19 - description maybe want we want to print
19:22 - pricing. formatted do without tax okay
19:27 - let's go a and just print those two
19:29 - then do an add to cart
19:30 - [Music]
19:32 - button so let's
19:34 - go
19:38 - P we're going to go NG bind HTML because
19:41 - with this is HTML in the description
19:44 - that it's really cool that you actually
19:46 - have the ability to add basic HTML tags
19:48 - to the product description which is
19:50 - really nice so the front end or the code
19:52 - has no we don't care what the
19:55 - description is we're just going to print
19:56 - it
19:57 - out
20:01 - which means I probably want that to be
20:02 - in a div not a P
20:07 - tag there we go so there's the
20:10 - description let's do a
20:19 - price what was that that was product
20:23 - dot pricing dot formatted do without
20:35 - tax there we go $10 even let's make an
20:39 - add cart
20:45 - button add to
20:48 - carts and then this will go NG
20:54 - click head
20:56 - cart and let's let's make this class
20:59 - equals
21:01 - BTN BTN success so there we go we're
21:05 - going to add that one to card let's go
21:06 - back to product JS and get that not
21:08 - product J yep that's
21:15 - it so this will basically pull in that
21:19 - now we need to get that
21:21 - molten we need to get that molten object
21:24 - in here uh so what we can do is go back
21:26 - to appjs
21:30 - and then this can
21:32 - just be
21:33 - [Music]
21:35 - molten and we will just
21:38 - [Music]
21:43 - return return molten o we can actually
21:46 - just return I think we just return
21:49 - molten o since that's a
21:57 - promise
21:58 - let's find out if we can do
22:01 - that let me console log that real
22:15 - quick yeah there we go so we've got our
22:17 - whole molten thing there uh so let's go
22:20 - ahead then we're going to go Molton do
22:23 - cart. insert and then we are going to go
22:27 - product.
22:28 - ID quantity will always be one we could
22:31 - add a field there but we're not going to
22:32 - do that uh for now and then that third
22:35 - pram again is null not sure why it's
22:37 - always
22:39 - null um let's uh do something a little
22:42 - funky here let's
22:46 - go let's make we we want to show status
22:49 - that we're adding that so let's make
22:52 - this an
22:54 - ngf um add
22:56 - status if there's no ad status we're
22:59 - going to show this if there is an ad
23:03 - status we are not going to make it
23:06 - clickable and this will be
23:09 - warning and this will be
23:14 - adding so there we go that'll be adding
23:17 - to cart
23:22 - so add status is null by
23:26 - default
23:30 - add status will be I don't know
23:35 - true actually I'm going to do I'm going
23:37 - to actually make
23:39 - that I'm actually take the status from
23:42 - in here is what I'm going to
23:48 - do so there we go adding to cart I'm
23:52 - going to do scope.apply
24:00 - I might not need to do that there um and
24:03 - then once it's
24:07 - complete scope. add status equals
24:12 - success and then let's bring timeout
24:17 - in so then we're going to do a
24:22 - timeout maybe of 1
24:25 - second and then we're going to make
24:27 - scope add status is null
24:31 - again so there we go we should add it to
24:33 - the cart uh what I did here is we're
24:36 - going to insert it to the cart uh we're
24:39 - going to we're going to change ad status
24:41 - so the button is going to not be clicked
24:43 - that's going away and this guy's showing
24:45 - up and then when it's successful we
24:47 - should say success for about a second
24:49 - and then click back to null so they can
24:51 - add another one to the cart let's see if
24:53 - this works here adding to cart apply is
24:56 - already in progress yeah I figured that
24:57 - was the case
24:59 - we don't need
25:00 - you we do need you I believe let's try
25:06 - that live reload refresh add to cart
25:08 - adding to
25:10 - cart success and now we can add it to
25:13 - cart again great add to cart adding to
25:16 - cart success all right so that's
25:19 - basically how we're going to do it we'll
25:20 - leave cart out for now maybe we'll do
25:22 - another video on it maybe we won't it's
25:25 - not that magical you just have to add a
25:27 - customer loog
25:28 - and then post up your address and your
25:30 - credit card information but that's a
25:31 - little bit more time intensive so hope
25:34 - you enjoyed looking at Molton with me
25:36 - today and uh give them a trial run sign
25:39 - up look at it it's a cool API and it's
25:43 - one that I'm very very glad I took the
25:45 - time to look into have a great
25:48 - day

Cleaned transcript:

okay so we're going to have a lot of fun in this video we are going to be rapidly building an ecommerce platform with angular um and molten we're actually going to be using the yman angular generator because that's going to automatically scaffold out routes and stuff for us and then we're also going to be using Molt's ecommerce API which I covered in another video super cool tool that's going to let us build any kind of app we want in just a matter of seconds um so go ahead and download those two tools if you're going to follow along and here we go we're going to start by I've already done an npm install G yo for Yan um I also have grunt installed globally and I have Bower installed yo globally yally and then I've also installed uh an generator angular uh because that's our angular generator so those three are installed and so now I can make a directory that's going to be let's just call this storefronts and so now I just go yo angular what I like to use SAS with compass yes I like SAS yes I like bootstrap yes I like SAS with bootstrap I'm just going to say yes to all those and now it's going to install everything for me I'm going to be right back because I'm not going to make you watch my install okay there we go that took about a minute and the install finished so let's go ahead and go Sublime into this folder and see what we got so it's scaffolded out oh one more thing we have to do is we have to go bow install now that it scaffolded all that out for us so that's going to install all the bower modules that were in our where is that in our bower.json so it installed all those so it's given us an app here's our index.html that it built out for us and you see that we basically just have an about controller and a main controller uh so let's let's go ahead and use that generator to now scaffold out some routes for us we can go yo angular route let's build a store Route there you go let's also build a let's say the store is going to be all categories so then they click on a category let's build a category route then they click on a product so let's click on a product product route and then let's do a cart route let's see if we can get that far I don't want to take an incredible amount of your time but I know we can at least get to cart here in just a few minutes so there we go now we have a lot more files we've included we've included our store JS our category JS product cart I'm just going to add I'm going to go these top links and I'm just going to make change about to store delete contact who needs to contact the store okay so there we go now all I have to do is go grunt serve that's going to open up a live reloading web page for us in Chrome uh should be any second now cool all right there we go so home and store this is the store view so if you look at app scripts um app also has now all of our routes this is what our generator did when we did our route generation we created a store a category product it Maps them to the controller create our controllers for us and created our views for us so we basically have a full app now we just have to connect it to Molten I love the angular generator one thing I've learned about yman generators take the time to find the generators you like take the time to learn them and you're going to get that time back 100 fold uh so if you remember from the molten video you have to authenticate first before you make API calls so this is a little bit tricky in angular what we have to do is we have to now make a service there's probably three or four ways you could do this in angular but I'm going to do it with the service I think it's the simplest way you can't see but I'm making a folder called Services down here when the font's zoomed in you can't see in Sublime what's going on down there and let me go ahead and make a new file in here and let's save this as mol. JS uh so now I'm just going to make a service module here angular let uh let's not call it molon let's see with this app it's called storefront app so let's go ahead and go storefront app. Molton I like this stuff that's not 100% about just my app to be its own module name uh so no dependencies on you and let's do a factory and let's call this molten off maybe yeah there you go so there we go and what I'm going to do here is I'm going to if you remember I have to basically do I'm going to copy this I have this copied over here the molten stuff I need to do you create a new molten object then molten do off authenticate and there you go what that does is that authenticates and then you can do any molten stuff within here uh so what I'm actually going to do is I need to kind of wait for that to authenticate and then return an authenticated object so I'm going to use CU for that and I'm going to create a promise if you don't know about promises I do have a video on promises um and so I'll put the link to that I think I have a video on promises um so we're going to go ver deferred equals q. defer so what I've done is I've kind of made a promised object right here a deferred object and so that's going to be what I return defer do promise I'm going to return the promise of that now you're you might feel confused here for about 2 minutes stick with me till we get this first route done and it's all going to make a lot of sense and then we get to copy paste so I'm going to do is I'm going to authenticate first I'm returning instantly This Promise the promise is not resolved with anything so when molten authenticates then I'm going to resolve with the molten object that's been authenticated this object right here so this is what's ultimately going to get returned when people require molten off so there's my Factory uh one thing I have to do is I have to now add since I did not generate that factory I have to add that in myself let's go Services mol. JS and I also have to add that molten API Library js. mol.com V1 so I'm going to go ahead and save this uh file save as save page as let's go code what's that called storefront app scripts let's make a folder called vendor and let's call this molon min.js yes use JS I'm not a fool and then let's add this maybe right here after angular so scripts vendor what I call it Molton do min.js so now Molt's on my page and that molten service is on my page let's save this see if I have any errors here okay I still am seeing the store view so that's good um I'm not seeing a m molten Min app looks like they have Source mapping on that I'm just going to drop that off because I don't want to see Source mapping error that error is not a problem but I don't want to see it um so there we go now I'm loading my store view so now I can make in my app you see I've got these routes created I can now make molten API calls here in my app so let's go to the store view this will be where we view all categories we're going to do a resolve so before we load our store view we need to resolve a few promises we'll call this one categories um and then this will will require molten o wh molten o I believe let's see if that's what it was called molten o yeah so now once again so our Factory molten o is going to return a promise that gets resolved with a good molten object so let's also load in Q so we're going to do is q. when molten O So when molten O resolves then we're going to be able to do stuff in here so that resolves with the Molton objects if you remember we resolved right here we passed in Molten so molten is what gets passed into our function now we can make our molten calls molten category list and this seems like a lot of code but once we get this in we get to copy paste so it's really not a lot once we get this first one done we're going to be able to do a lot of stuff really fast so we're going to list our categories categories and then I actually want to do another resolve here don't I so what I'm I'm going to have to do here is Q let's make a exact same thing we did for our o q. defer and then I'm going to go deferred do resolve categories and then I'm going to return that deferred promise okay so once again I'm making a deferred and I'm returning that so I'm returning this as categories and angular is going going to wait until this promise resolves with our categories so there we go we're going to have all our categories in uh let's go to the controller that it generated for us what are we calling this store yep we're on store let's require categories so categories is going to require this guy right here which is our whole categories process we just did scope. categories equals categories and let's console log categories as well so we can see that uh let's go ahead and refresh here and go to store unknown provider categories uhoh I hate it when you get these things ah I know what I did wrong I did not add since I made a new module I did not make my app require that module yet angular I do that a lot that's that's something I do a lot when I'm doing angular stuff I'll add a module I'll add it to my HTML and I'll for forget to make my app require it so now we're good you can see my object is right here boom I've got one uncategorized I've got one category called uncategorized so let's go ahead and make that spit it out on the page now let's go to our views our store view so if you remember I made scope categories categories um what do we actually want to print out here the ID is that and the title is what we're looking at so let's go back to our story HTML categories I'll just do a list for now don't want to bore you guys this will be an NG repeat let's go cat in categories so this will be cat. tile Some people prefer the spaces here some people don't I don't really care and this hrf will be uh what is it actually this is ngre because we're going to do some templating in here pound SL category and then it'll be cat. ID I kind of prefer spaces when it's there and I don't like spaces when it's here in a URL because it makes it feel m passive so let's see if that worked here there we go uncategorized and that takes us to a URL that's not working yet so there we go category cat ID let's go and build out our categories now actually let's make sure this works so I go to store categories let me go to my Forge molon let's go ahead and log in to will store add a category make sure this is working here inventory categories create a category no parent category awesome category oh I need a description St awesome category there we go so there's my categories and now if I load up here I should see two awesome category and uncategorized awesome it is real time connecting to my store so let's go ahead and build out that category route it's going to be really simple I just copy and paste that whole resolve and instead of categories this will be products um when molon off then product list category equals and then this will be the ID of our category uh so what we need to do here is we need to do route we need to get that route Pam off there route current I think it's pams do ID so we're going to make this category slash ID so we just want to go to slash category we need to go to a specific category every time so categoryid that will be route. current. prams doid we're going to list that this should work let's go ahead and re refresh this guy so there we go that worked and let's go into our category controller products products you know what I also want to get the category so let's go back to that and we're going to also do the category love those Sublime Text multiple cursors Apple D um let's go category I believe it's doget I think I can just go ID like that so that should work let's see if that all works for us okay it's not resolving um it's not instantiating okay so let's try up unexpected identifier got a problem here ah no comma so there we go category view is resolving so that's good we should have a category and a products in there so let's go to our view and add them and this is category. tile since our category object is in there and again we'll just do an Li yeah I'm actually going to go over to store copy and paste prod in products and this will go to products prod. ID prod. tile let's see if this works hey we got our three products sweet see how it's going a lot faster so far our uncategorized category and then we've got our products I'm not messing with any design yet let's go to a single product and then maybe we'll do an add cart and a cart for those of you guys who totally want to keep following along um any you guys at this point you can probably realize wow you're going to be able to build out a whole shopping cart in a day um so definitely go just get the free to your molten thing Try It Out Try building an angular app or a Javascript app with just HTML you're going to like it I'm going to go ahead and add a product and an add to cart and then we'll call it because we're probably looking at about 20 minutes 30 minutes by then let's go ahead we're on the product view so I'm going to copy the category resolve seems the most likely one um products we want the products and then this one will also have an ID required that one's got the route injected then we're going to do product. get we're getting that product yep that's all we need copy paste so let's go do that uh product controller requires product scope. product equals product it's a lot of product and so now we should be able to go and then let's let's console log this so we can kind of get a look at what look at what that product object looks like bearded man Strikes Back like it um let's see it looks like I got a problem in here somewhere unknown provider products product control I must have made a typo in there let me look at this guy oh I know what the problem is this is not in a resolve ah hate it when it's something it's always something silly like that isn't it there we go that's going to work cuz it works unexpected token well now there's unexpected token somewhere where is that okay accidentally typed you and there we go we've got our product bearded man Strikes Back uh we've got our description your beards will grow twice as long listening to these Homeless looking guys rock your face off with a banjo okay so we want to print that description maybe want we want to print pricing. formatted do without tax okay let's go a and just print those two then do an add to cart button so let's go P we're going to go NG bind HTML because with this is HTML in the description that it's really cool that you actually have the ability to add basic HTML tags to the product description which is really nice so the front end or the code has no we don't care what the description is we're just going to print it out which means I probably want that to be in a div not a P tag there we go so there's the description let's do a price what was that that was product dot pricing dot formatted do without tax there we go $10 even let's make an add cart button add to carts and then this will go NG click head cart and let's let's make this class equals BTN BTN success so there we go we're going to add that one to card let's go back to product JS and get that not product J yep that's it so this will basically pull in that now we need to get that molten we need to get that molten object in here uh so what we can do is go back to appjs and then this can just be molten and we will just return return molten o we can actually just return I think we just return molten o since that's a promise let's find out if we can do that let me console log that real quick yeah there we go so we've got our whole molten thing there uh so let's go ahead then we're going to go Molton do cart. insert and then we are going to go product. ID quantity will always be one we could add a field there but we're not going to do that uh for now and then that third pram again is null not sure why it's always null um let's uh do something a little funky here let's go let's make we we want to show status that we're adding that so let's make this an ngf um add status if there's no ad status we're going to show this if there is an ad status we are not going to make it clickable and this will be warning and this will be adding so there we go that'll be adding to cart so add status is null by default add status will be I don't know true actually I'm going to do I'm going to actually make that I'm actually take the status from in here is what I'm going to do so there we go adding to cart I'm going to do scope.apply I might not need to do that there um and then once it's complete scope. add status equals success and then let's bring timeout in so then we're going to do a timeout maybe of 1 second and then we're going to make scope add status is null again so there we go we should add it to the cart uh what I did here is we're going to insert it to the cart uh we're going to we're going to change ad status so the button is going to not be clicked that's going away and this guy's showing up and then when it's successful we should say success for about a second and then click back to null so they can add another one to the cart let's see if this works here adding to cart apply is already in progress yeah I figured that was the case we don't need you we do need you I believe let's try that live reload refresh add to cart adding to cart success and now we can add it to cart again great add to cart adding to cart success all right so that's basically how we're going to do it we'll leave cart out for now maybe we'll do another video on it maybe we won't it's not that magical you just have to add a customer loog and then post up your address and your credit card information but that's a little bit more time intensive so hope you enjoyed looking at Molton with me today and uh give them a trial run sign up look at it it's a cool API and it's one that I'm very very glad I took the time to look into have a great day
