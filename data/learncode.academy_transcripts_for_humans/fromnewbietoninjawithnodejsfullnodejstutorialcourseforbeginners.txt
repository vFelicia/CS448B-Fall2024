00:07 - that's right this red guy in spandex on
00:09 - the left could be you I mean look at him
00:11 - that girl's totally checking him out too
00:13 - I've been working on a course called
00:15 - from newbie to ninja in node.js and I've
00:17 - been developing it for a while and I'm
00:19 - ready to release it to you guys it's
00:21 - going to be awesome so for all you tldr
00:24 - people just visit store. Learn code.
00:26 - Academy it's on sale there now and it's
00:29 - 50% off these first three days for all
00:31 - of my subscribers I want to give you
00:33 - guys a great deal this course is 30
00:35 - videos I've basically taken my five
00:38 - years of day in day out experience
00:40 - coding node.js and I've determined what
00:42 - the core competencies of a node.js
00:44 - developer are say that five times fast
00:46 - core competencies of a node.js developer
00:49 - so by the time you're done with this
00:50 - course you're going to have everything
00:51 - it takes to be a node.js developer not
00:54 - just know random bits and pieces about
00:56 - node.js so who is this video for if
00:59 - you're going to purchase a course you
01:00 - want to know what for you first and
01:02 - foremost it's designed for people who
01:04 - are new to backend if you've been doing
01:06 - front end your whole life um and backend
01:08 - is a little mysterious or terrifying and
01:10 - you're looking for the correct on-ramp
01:12 - this is the ideal course for you with
01:15 - each video I made sure to stop and think
01:17 - how would this feel if I was new to
01:19 - backend what terminologies would be new
01:21 - what things might be intimidating and I
01:23 - want to make sure I explain them well
01:25 - for someone who's new to backend if
01:27 - you're experienced in backend you'll
01:29 - feel right at home along the way and I
01:30 - won't dumb anything down but for anyone
01:33 - that's new it's going to be a really
01:34 - nice on-ramp into backend Technologies
01:37 - and building backend applications second
01:39 - it's going to be really good for people
01:40 - with PHP only backend experience while
01:43 - PHP can mean a lot of things if you've
01:45 - done mostly cms's working maybe with
01:48 - open- Source shopping carts and just
01:50 - hacking things around and you can make
01:52 - backend work but you don't really feel
01:54 - like a true backend engineer this is
01:57 - going to be a really good course for you
01:59 - because the way OJs runs as a constant
02:01 - running service puts it alongside of
02:04 - many many other backend applications
02:07 - basically if you learn node.js you're
02:08 - going to get the concepts of many other
02:10 - web Technologies in a way you wouldn't
02:12 - get if you have PHP only backend
02:15 - experience also if you're just new to
02:17 - node.js if you're a backend developer
02:18 - and you want to learn node.js this again
02:21 - will give you those core competencies in
02:23 - a really quick way really the only thing
02:25 - you need to know is some JavaScript you
02:27 - don't even have to be a JavaScript ninja
02:29 - um and I'll put some links to some of my
02:31 - free playlists in the description below
02:33 - you basically need to know the basics of
02:35 - JavaScript uh maybe watch my JavaScript
02:38 - is weird and awesome course maybe know
02:40 - about modular JavaScript and promises
02:43 - and you'll be good to go so what will
02:45 - you learn in this course we're going to
02:46 - cover six main areas we're going to
02:48 - cover the node.js basics and all the
02:50 - things that took me a long time to
02:52 - discover about those Basics along the
02:54 - way even some things that I just learned
02:56 - over the last year that have always been
02:58 - there and then we're also going to learn
03:00 - expressjs which is hands down the most
03:02 - popular web application framework for
03:04 - node.js we're going to learn all its ins
03:06 - and outs and how simple it is to put
03:09 - together a powerful application then
03:11 - we're going to move on to databases
03:12 - connecting to mySQL getting and setting
03:14 - data and also how to manage those
03:16 - databases in a great production
03:18 - environment like setting up database
03:20 - fixtures so your team can work
03:21 - completely offline with their own
03:23 - database on their machine and handling
03:25 - your production database with migrations
03:28 - some great things which will be really
03:30 - especially if you're new to backend then
03:31 - we're going to move into authentication
03:33 - and authorization that tricky piece of
03:35 - how do I do a username password login
03:37 - and know that it's secure ooth to login
03:40 - so you can log in with your Google ID or
03:42 - with your GitHub ID um and then
03:44 - authorization and private data and
03:46 - making sure things stay secure then
03:48 - we're going to move into redis so that
03:49 - way you can manage your sessions and
03:51 - caching and reddis is just a really cool
03:53 - uniquely usable database and then we're
03:55 - also going to cover deployment how you
03:57 - provision those production servers and
03:59 - get that application out to production
04:01 - basically like I said it's going to be
04:03 - everything it takes to get you rolling
04:05 - with no. JS and for the next 3 days it
04:08 - is 50% off that's right 50% off because
