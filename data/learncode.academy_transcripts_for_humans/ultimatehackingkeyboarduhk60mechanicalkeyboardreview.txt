00:00 - ladies and gentlemen i have gotten my
00:02 - hands on the ultimate hacking keyboard
00:04 - uh k 60. it is a beautiful mechanical
00:08 - keyboard and it splits
00:10 - [Music]
00:18 - okay yes so you are looking at the uh k
00:21 - 60 it is ultimate hacking keyboards 60
00:24 - mechanical keyboard 60 meaning it has no
00:28 - number keys and it also has no function
00:30 - keys it makes up for this by providing
00:32 - you with a concept of layers much like
00:34 - an ergodox keyboard does so you have
00:36 - your regular keys
00:38 - printed or blank i think blank is
00:40 - absolutely beautiful so had to go with
00:42 - blank so it gives you a regular layer
00:45 - and then you can toggle to another layer
00:46 - for your function keys another layer for
00:48 - your arrow keys another layer for all
00:50 - your custom hotkeys where one key can do
00:53 - any number of things or combination of
00:55 - keys
00:56 - yeah so fully programmable customizable
00:59 - a ton of fun and yes
01:02 - it splits so it can be a standard qwerty
01:05 - keyboard or much more of an ergonomic
01:07 - thing uh so let's go over some of the
01:09 - features first i've been using this
01:11 - keyboard for a month straight because i
01:13 - never want to talk about something that
01:14 - i haven't fully used as you all know
01:17 - almost everything seems cool when you
01:18 - first get it but after a little while
01:20 - you really know what you think about it
01:22 - so i really know what i think about this
01:24 - and i will let you know that as well
01:27 - so looking at the features first
01:29 - it does come with an optional actual
01:31 - real wood wrist rest which is an
01:33 - accessory that i think is an absolute
01:35 - must oh my goodness it it adds a lot of
01:37 - weight to the keyboard it adds a lot of
01:39 - stability to it
01:41 - and it really just adds a lot of beauty
01:43 - to the frame that you already get which
01:44 - in my opinion is already a really pretty
01:47 - frame frame comes in black white red
01:50 - orange i think that's all the colors
01:51 - there might be one or two more so you
01:53 - have some color options with the frame
01:55 - the frame also does have some leds here
01:58 - to show which layer you are on there's
02:00 - some small little things that say you're
02:01 - on the mod function or mouse layer and
02:03 - there's also three leds that say what
02:06 - general mode your keyboard is in because
02:08 - you can customize it to have several
02:10 - different modes for colmac or dvorak or
02:13 - any of that stuff
02:14 - it is connected by basically a phone
02:16 - cable fun story my eight-year-old saw me
02:19 - plugging it in and said whoa cool
02:21 - invention of a cable that has a little
02:23 - plastic clip on it
02:24 - yeah he'd never seen a phone cable
02:26 - before fun times
02:29 - and it splits obviously
02:31 - this construction is extremely solid and
02:33 - by extremely solid i mean this is the
02:35 - most solid feeling keyboard i have ever
02:37 - laid my hands on
02:39 - immediately i realized how plasticky
02:41 - clacky almost every other mechanical
02:43 - keyboard sounds and feels and it's not
02:46 - to do with the key switches and keycaps
02:48 - it has to do with the casing
02:50 - that you connect them to so you might
02:52 - even be able to hear
02:56 - those are browns or kale coppers in this
02:59 - case so a tactile key and instead of a
03:03 - clacky
03:04 - click they have more of a nice calming
03:07 - thud to them because what you're getting
03:09 - in this case is you're getting a metal
03:12 - backing plate you're getting metal
03:14 - connectors so when it's connected it is
03:17 - stable and
03:18 - very pleasing very satisfying to connect
03:21 - it together because it's basically steel
03:23 - rods going into steel posts to support
03:25 - them even the wrist rests that you get
03:27 - the wooden wrist rests connect to a
03:28 - metal backing plate that screws into
03:31 - metal receivers so all in all the
03:33 - construction of this keyboard is
03:35 - remarkably sound just way more solid
03:38 - than any keyboard i have ever used that
03:41 - right off the bat first impression when
03:43 - i started touching the keyboard was wow
03:45 - this feels
03:46 - phenomenal
03:48 - also you'll notice that it's your
03:50 - standard staggered key qwerty keyboard
03:52 - so in my mind when you start getting
03:54 - into a layered keyboard like this the
03:55 - number one decision you have to make is
03:57 - do you want to go with the switch from
03:59 - staggered right where the layers stagger
04:01 - on the top compared to the row behind
04:03 - them or do you want to go with linear or
04:05 - ortho linear where each layer is exactly
04:08 - in a row with one before it i've
04:10 - historically really liked ergodox
04:12 - keyboards because of the linear layout
04:15 - and strangely enough i find myself
04:18 - liking this keyboard as potentially my
04:20 - favorite keyboard of all time and by
04:22 - potentially
04:24 - here's here's what i would say if you
04:26 - are not dead certain that you are a
04:28 - brave person and want to try crazy new
04:31 - layouts like the ergodox provides with
04:34 - thumb clusters and all the other stuff
04:35 - that an ergodox type of keyboard gives
04:37 - you
04:38 - you should buy this mechanical keyboard
04:40 - if you're looking to get in mechanical
04:42 - keyboards here's exactly why i would say
04:44 - that is because you're starting off
04:47 - connected standard qwerty you're going
04:49 - to be able to go from 0 to 60 and get
04:50 - comfortable in it in no time whereas an
04:53 - ergodox type of style layout you're
04:54 - talking minimum two weeks probably more
04:56 - like six weeks till you fully feel
04:58 - comfortable i felt comfortable on this
05:00 - immediately because it's a standard
05:02 - qwerty layout and then as i got more
05:04 - comfortable i was able to split it apart
05:06 - maybe try some more strange and unusual
05:09 - keyboard layouts and key mappings which
05:11 - brings me to one of my absolute favorite
05:13 - things about this keyboard is the visual
05:16 - keymapper software is the best in its
05:19 - class absolutely the best i've ever
05:21 - encountered
05:22 - while many other keyboards have really
05:24 - good key mapping software you download
05:26 - an actual software app that runs on your
05:28 - computer you open it up click click
05:30 - click change some key mappings and hit
05:32 - save you don't have to find a little
05:34 - paper clip and punch a little button to
05:36 - go into dfu mode where you can program
05:38 - it
05:39 - you basically just open the app change
05:42 - the key mappings hit save and your
05:44 - keyboard is updated absolutely
05:46 - phenomenal and seamless because the
05:48 - number one thing you want to do on a
05:49 - keyboard like this is customize and hack
05:52 - and change your key combinations and
05:54 - your hot keys all the time so you get an
05:57 - opportunity to do that with this
05:58 - keyboard it's it's not frustrating it's
06:01 - extremely seamless it takes because of
06:03 - not having to put it into firmware
06:05 - update mode it honestly takes about a
06:08 - quarter of the time to make small
06:09 - changes which is really really nice
06:12 - um it also comes with some tenting keys
06:13 - let's see if you can see them here it's
06:15 - got some tenting keys that you can
06:16 - either put all on the back row for a
06:19 - vertical tenting front to back
06:21 - or you can put them
06:23 - on the insides here making for a
06:26 - center to edge tenting
06:28 - the only gripe that i would actually
06:30 - have about the hardware of this keyboard
06:32 - is it's really tiny little screws to
06:35 - unscrew these tenting uh pegs and try
06:38 - them out on a different layout or
06:39 - different location
06:41 - it's not super easy to do but it's not
06:43 - like you have to do that every day once
06:44 - you find that you like it this way
06:47 - or that way or the optional tent forward
06:49 - option which i don't think i'd ever go
06:52 - for the
06:53 - tents forward option
06:55 - [Music]
06:58 - but once you you know try out those
06:59 - three options find out what you like you
07:01 - don't really ever change it so it's not
07:03 - that big of a gripe that was honestly my
07:05 - only nitpick
07:06 - out of everything even where you plug in
07:08 - the usb cord it's indented in here
07:11 - underneath has a little wire catch so if
07:14 - your kid walks by and really trips on
07:16 - that cable it's not going to rip it out
07:17 - of the keyboard worst case scenario
07:19 - you're going to bend and put a kink in
07:20 - the cable because it's got a little
07:22 - cable kink right there for you so a lot
07:25 - of thought has been put into this
07:27 - keyboard absolutely making it a to die
07:30 - for phenomenal keyboard
07:32 - they are coming out with some really
07:34 - cool thumb clusters uh like a mouse and
07:36 - a trackball type of things uh for these
07:39 - sides they haven't come out with them
07:40 - yet but it looks like those are getting
07:41 - really close to making it into
07:43 - production those would be pretty
07:44 - interesting as well especially for the
07:46 - people that go for split i mean once i
07:48 - go for a split keyboard i never go back
07:49 - to together i just am a huge fan of
07:52 - split keyboards once you get past that
07:53 - initial learning curve of liking i mean
07:56 - putting your coffee in the middle
07:58 - i don't need to say anymore so having
08:00 - that thumb cluster there for making
08:02 - mousing easier pretty cool
08:04 - last thing i'd like to highlight and
08:06 - show off is they have these extra little
08:08 - clicks right here below the space bar on
08:11 - each side there's a button built into
08:13 - the actual frame of the keyboard and you
08:16 - also have two separate space bars so you
08:18 - can make space bar do space on your
08:20 - right hand and the click do space on
08:22 - your left hand while this does a much
08:24 - more useful function for those of you
08:26 - guys who use either your right or your
08:28 - left thumb mostly for spacing
08:31 - but in my opinion as soon as i saw those
08:33 - i was like well these are my layer
08:34 - toggles right there layer two layer
08:37 - three and then cap slot key for layer
08:39 - four and boom you can easily get to all
08:41 - four of your layers
08:42 - it was a really quick setup for me made
08:44 - it really simple to get to what i want
08:46 - to do i have my mousing layer my
08:47 - function keys layer
08:49 - and then all my custom hotkeys layers
08:52 - all in all
08:53 - i have really nothing negative to say
08:55 - about this keyboard
08:57 - and i have a lot of positives it is the
08:59 - extraordinary build quality makes it
09:01 - enjoyable from the day from
09:05 - making it
09:06 - pretty much my one of my favorite two
09:08 - mechanical keyboards of all time if you
09:10 - had to pick and you weren't sure if you
09:12 - wanted a risky unusual layout like some
09:14 - of those
09:15 - unusual keyboards that are out there i
09:18 - would say get this keyboard as a first
09:20 - run mechanical keyboard
09:22 - for the price point you honestly can't
09:24 - build a quality keyboard
09:26 - for the price that you can have them
09:27 - just build it and ship it to you anyway
09:29 - it's just getting the parts and the key
09:30 - switches and the keycaps alone
09:33 - you're gonna be spending as much or more
09:35 - than this to build one yourself and it
09:38 - probably will not be made as well so i'm
09:40 - a huge fan uhk you've made me a
09:42 - phenomenal fan thanks for the demo piece
09:44 - to try out for this video and i hope you
09:47 - guys enjoyed watching have a good day
10:08 - you

ladies and gentlemen i have gotten my hands on the ultimate hacking keyboard uh k 60. it is a beautiful mechanical keyboard and it splits okay yes so you are looking at the uh k 60 it is ultimate
