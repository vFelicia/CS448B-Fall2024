00:02 - been a professional web developer for
00:04 - almost 20 years and in this course we
00:06 - are going to learn professional web
00:07 - development absolutely free from the
00:10 - very beginning my previous course on
00:12 - this on youtube has had millions of
00:14 - views thousands of comments and i've
00:16 - learned a lot about the common hang-ups
00:18 - people find and run into when they're
00:20 - learning web development so we're going
00:22 - to redo this course for 2018 2019 give
00:24 - you the most modern skill set to get you
00:27 - a career as a web developer we're going
00:28 - to make it easy fun and hopefully help
00:30 - you to avoid any confusing pitfalls that
00:33 - are common for people to end up with
00:35 - along the way now i want to mention
00:36 - really quickly before we get into this
00:38 - course that if you're here because you
00:40 - just need a website for yourself or for
00:42 - your business you do not want to learn
00:44 - all of this it's not the right road for
00:46 - you instead look in the description i
00:48 - have a link down there for the wix adi
00:50 - that's their artificial intelligence
00:53 - web development tool and it's basically
00:55 - with a few questions going to build a
00:57 - whole website for you that you can then
00:58 - customize that is the fastest and
01:00 - cheapest way to get your website up if
01:02 - all you want is a website if that's not
01:05 - you and you want to learn web
01:06 - development because you know how great
01:08 - of a career it is and it is a great
01:10 - career with good pay and tons of demand
01:13 - then let's get into developing websites
01:16 - and being a web developer in this day
01:18 - and age so the first thing you'll need
01:20 - to do is let's install some professional
01:22 - web development tools good news they're
01:24 - all free because web developers love
01:26 - free stuff so what i want you to do is
01:28 - open your web browser which i prefer
01:30 - chrome and most web developers do these
01:32 - days but open your web browser and go to
01:34 - visual studio code just google search
01:37 - visual studio code and that's going to
01:39 - take you to this and i want you to
01:41 - download it this is the best web
01:44 - development tool out there that is free
01:46 - not everybody uses the same text editor
01:48 - but visual studio code is probably the
01:50 - most popular text editor these days so
01:53 - go ahead download it install it start it
01:55 - up and you'll end up with something like
01:57 - this visual studio code right here
01:59 - although you'll probably see a welcome
02:01 - screen that looks like this now i want
02:03 - you to install one thing once you get it
02:04 - open i want you to click over here onto
02:06 - this square button
02:08 - and you can install all these great
02:09 - extensions for free from the marketplace
02:12 - and the one that we're the most
02:13 - interested in right now is called live
02:15 - server so go ahead search for live
02:17 - server and get this top one right here
02:19 - launch a development local server with
02:21 - blah blah yes install that we want to
02:24 - install that and reload and you'll see
02:25 - in just a second what that does for us
02:28 - so now that live server is installed and
02:31 - we have visual studio code installed
02:33 - we're ready to start coding
02:35 - this is exactly what professionals see
02:37 - all day every day when they're coding is
02:39 - visual studio code or the text editor of
02:42 - their choice if they don't want to use
02:43 - visual studio code so let's make a
02:45 - project and create our first super ugly
02:48 - super basic website before we wrap up
02:50 - this tutorial i want you to go over to
02:52 - this files tab here and click on it and
02:54 - you can see it says hey you haven't
02:55 - opened a folder yet let's go ahead and
02:56 - open a folder
02:57 - in this case you get to choose where you
02:59 - want to go maybe create a new folder
03:01 - somewhere in this case i already have a
03:03 - folder called learn code and i have a
03:04 - folder called my website so i'm going to
03:06 - use this one
03:08 - and then in this folder you want to
03:10 - create your very first file which you
03:11 - can do the new file button
03:13 - or you can go file new or you can just
03:15 - do command n or control n if you're on a
03:18 - pc so let's go create our new file we
03:20 - always want to call this first file the
03:22 - home page of our website
03:24 - index.html index is what the website is
03:27 - automatically going to open when you go
03:29 - to yourawesomewebsite.com
03:31 - so here we have index.html and i want
03:33 - you to do something really sneaky here
03:35 - just hit exclamation mark and then hit
03:37 - tab and boom don't freak out this looks
03:40 - like a lot of code but it's actually not
03:42 - confusing at all
03:44 - we if exclamation tab we created the
03:47 - empty website template what you want to
03:50 - do is go in between these two body tags
03:53 - body tag and body tag and go ahead say
03:55 - something let's say hi and hit save
03:58 - you'll want to learn to hit save from
04:00 - your keyboard which on a mac is command
04:01 - s or control s from windows or you can
04:04 - just do file save but that's a lot
04:06 - slower you're going to want to save a
04:08 - lot
04:09 - once you've saved your page right click
04:11 - and click open with live server you
04:14 - should have this because you created
04:16 - your live server or you installed live
04:18 - server so now you can see i've got this
04:21 - live server that it created on my
04:23 - machine instead of a website and it's
04:25 - going to index.html and there's my
04:28 - website hi
04:29 - what i can do now is i can kind of
04:31 - create a layout here by dragging my two
04:33 - windows so i can see them both at once
04:35 - and if i change this maybe add an
04:37 - exclamation mark and hit save it
04:39 - automatically reloads that's because my
04:41 - live server is doing something called
04:43 - live reloading where whenever my my
04:46 - website changes i get to see that change
04:48 - right away it's a great development
04:50 - experience so i can say hello world
04:53 - hit save and my website is updated so
04:56 - there you go we've created your first
04:59 - website you don't really understand any
05:01 - of this this is called html and it's the
05:03 - first thing a web developer learns and
05:05 - so in the next video we're going to get
05:07 - into learning html then we're going to
05:09 - add to that css and javascript and once
05:11 - you learn all three of those things you
05:13 - are a web developer so let's get into
05:16 - that next html video
