00:00 - for those of you who have heard of
00:01 - tailwind over the last few years
00:02 - tailwind css but i've never gotten a
00:04 - chance to dig in or at least maybe you
00:06 - have some exposure but you just don't
00:08 - quote get it uh this video is really a
00:10 - must watch for any of you guys
00:12 - tailwind is an extraordinary
00:14 - utility class library for css and if the
00:17 - idea of css utility classes is new to
00:20 - you you've got to give me at least three
00:21 - minutes here to show you how awesome of
00:23 - a concept this is whether you use
00:25 - tailwind or not because at first glance
00:27 - most people say what's the point i don't
00:28 - get it but once you get it oh wow you
00:31 - never want to go back to writing css the
00:33 - same way again
00:34 - especially in your component driven
00:36 - javascript apps like if you do react.js
00:38 - or vue.js applications wow tailwind
00:41 - absolutely shines here and saves so much
00:45 - time so let's get into it i'll show you
00:47 - the true basics and then we'll dive a
00:49 - little bit deeper after that so i'm
00:51 - going to start with a basic html file
00:53 - and all you have to do is add tailwind
00:55 - css to get started now this is not a
00:58 - production worthy setup
00:59 - taiwan basically gives you thousands and
01:02 - thousands of classes and then in
01:04 - production all the ones you don't use
01:06 - get stripped out and what these utility
01:08 - classes allow you to do is never go to a
01:10 - style sheet and write css instead you
01:12 - use those utility classes to accomplish
01:14 - what you want to accomplish so let's see
01:16 - uh hi make sure i got a live reloading
01:18 - setup you see there's a nice css reset
01:20 - going on with tailwind every single
01:22 - element has essentially no style to it
01:25 - so what you want to do is you want to
01:27 - create a let's do a div with a class
01:29 - here
01:30 - let's add a background color to it
01:32 - tailwind gives me a bunch of different
01:34 - colors i can go red 500 red 800 red 200.
01:39 - green 200
01:41 - and if i customize the config then these
01:43 - colors can all be colors that actually
01:45 - come from my color palette for the app
01:48 - i'm working on uh but for now i'm just
01:50 - going to leave the default config here
01:51 - let's go back with that red 400 now
01:54 - let's do a text of whites
01:56 - now at first you're probably thinking
01:58 - how do i know what all these classes are
01:59 - and at first you'll want to have the
02:01 - documentation up when you start with
02:03 - tailwind that only lasts a couple hours
02:05 - a couple days at the most because how
02:07 - many css classes and styles do you
02:10 - really use throughout the day for
02:11 - margins it's pretty easy uh let's add a
02:14 - padding of two that's going to add a
02:17 - padding everywhere let's say we want
02:18 - padding of x and y so px to be eight so
02:22 - our left and right are going to have a
02:24 - stronger one and they go with the grid
02:26 - system so 2 4 6 8 12 16 32 24
02:31 - and again those those margins are
02:33 - configurable if you want them to be
02:34 - which we'll get into a little later
02:36 - let's also say our margins are two
02:39 - let's say m
02:40 - t which is m top or m b right we have m
02:43 - x and y for x and y
02:46 - m t b l r for margin top left bottom
02:50 - right so i'll go on mt of 12
02:53 - and it's just really really fast what
02:55 - you're noticing is i've not had to leave
02:57 - the html at all so far
02:59 - i'm able to just right away as i'm
03:02 - writing out the content i can spit out
03:04 - the classes and have my style baked
03:06 - right in now for some people it drives
03:08 - them a little bit nuts at first that you
03:10 - have extra classes but especially if
03:12 - you're in react land or working on
03:14 - component style work
03:16 - what's incredible is if i want to move
03:18 - this to any other component i literally
03:20 - just cut it out and then paste it where
03:22 - i want it all the style moved with it
03:24 - there is no css file there is no css
03:27 - file anywhere
03:29 - and i've been able to build an entire
03:30 - very large scale applications with no
03:33 - css files no cascading styles of any
03:37 - kind it's really really phenomenal the
03:40 - speed is so fast and the peace of mind
03:43 - and reusability you get it's just great
03:46 - you focus on building features
03:48 - not on figuring out how the css works
03:52 - you also get responsiveness built in so
03:54 - i can use md
03:56 - lg
03:57 - xl these are kind of predefined
03:59 - breakpoints i could make my own if i
04:01 - wanted to in the config you know called
04:02 - super large
04:05 - but what i can do here is let's say this
04:07 - margin top is 12
04:09 - that's for mobile
04:10 - but for medium screens i want to make
04:12 - margin top of 24.
04:14 - basically all the classes you get just
04:16 - prefix them with md colon and on large
04:19 - screens i want to empty
04:21 - 35 let's go something big 64.
04:23 - so now as i expand my screen boop boop
04:26 - it continues to bounce down i have
04:28 - responsive stuff built in anything you
04:30 - can do
04:31 - i could also make the large have a
04:32 - different color
04:36 - so when i go large i get the black text
04:40 - anything you can automatically do with
04:42 - classes you also get classes for the
04:44 - responsive styles uh there's also hover
04:47 - styles so if i want to go hover
04:50 - bg is black so now if i hover it goes to
04:52 - black and i can also add
04:54 - transitions a duration of 500 that gives
04:57 - an automatic transition nice let's say i
05:00 - want that to be a little faster
05:01 - 200 milliseconds faster transition uh
05:05 - just so many cool things you can do
05:08 - without really trying or thinking too
05:10 - much about it uh so let's go ahead and
05:12 - build out a full layout i'm not i'm
05:14 - going to fast forward through a lot of
05:15 - the parts so there's nothing mundane
05:17 - happening and i will stop and comment
05:18 - here and there uh but let's show you
05:20 - just how fast and easy it is to build
05:22 - out a beautiful layout with tailwind all
05:24 - right so the first thing we're going to
05:25 - want is a nice big header maybe that's
05:27 - got some sort of hero background image
05:29 - but for now we can use tailwind's
05:31 - gradient backgrounds which are super
05:33 - nice
05:34 - so this is going to be a gradient from
05:36 - the top left to the bottom right
05:43 - there we go we've got that nice gradient
05:45 - header that's 80 height and i had a flex
05:47 - column so i can stack some things
05:50 - top to bottom let's add maybe a logo a
05:52 - menu and a user menu in here
06:07 - okay i've added my menu things up top
06:09 - this will be my logo it's got a width of
06:10 - 40.
06:11 - uh then flex one for the middle so this
06:13 - is going to automatically uh flex no
06:16 - matter how big the screen gets and then
06:18 - this also has a fixed width of 40 here
06:21 - on the right uh you can see that i
06:23 - easily just say hey flex item center
06:26 - width full and it automatically takes
06:28 - care of everything so flex is super
06:30 - useful i added flex column to this so i
06:32 - can now add some other things stacking
06:34 - boom boom boom uh so let's go ahead and
06:37 - have add like a tagline and a button and
06:39 - then we'll add a hero type of callout
06:42 - down below
06:50 - nice there we go um i added test white
06:53 - let's say text of white there we go uh
06:56 - nice and white let's add a button
07:12 - awesome we've got a button here and as
07:14 - you hover the color changes a little bit
07:16 - uh i did a shadow let me on hover make
07:19 - the shadow go bigger
07:22 - there we go ah that's a little bit big
07:24 - maybe i'll go shadow large instead of xl
07:27 - on hover
07:29 - nice and just a quick little moment so
07:31 - you can see i'm not really using
07:33 - anything fancy i'm using text white text
07:36 - size
07:37 - uh rounded background colors
07:40 - uh hover duration everything i already
07:42 - showed you i'm just reusing those same
07:44 - ones okay so i added font bold and then
07:47 - font light so that way this has a bold
07:49 - font that has a skinny little light font
07:52 - uh let's see no nothing else really text
07:55 - sizes
07:56 - shadow that's a new one that i added but
07:58 - really you can build these pretty cool
07:59 - layouts pretty fast with all the basic
08:02 - stuff you already know uh let me go
08:03 - ahead and make like some sort of
08:04 - call-out thing that overlaps here it has
08:07 - a sort of negative margin to it i'm
08:09 - gonna go down to the next section
08:29 - okay i've added a hero call out here uh
08:32 - we have flex flex column i have the
08:35 - items being centered i have a negative
08:38 - margin here uh on the top i that
08:41 - probably only has to have a negative
08:42 - margin on the top
08:44 - uh
08:44 - let's see uh
08:47 - margin bottom is 10 pixels
08:49 - then i did this hover margin i forgot
08:52 - that that is not actually supported out
08:54 - of the box you can configure that to
08:56 - work but uh that would be nice if when
08:58 - you kind of hovered over it it slid up a
09:00 - little bit you can configure that
09:02 - and then the actual box just is rounded
09:04 - white background you can see it's all
09:05 - just kind of normal stuff i gave it a
09:07 - border color told it to be half width
09:10 - so that way it's basically a 50 width no
09:12 - matter how big the screen gets this is
09:14 - not super complex stuff let's go ahead
09:16 - and add a footer on here and i feel like
09:18 - we've got our basic layout done in just
09:20 - a couple minutes
09:28 - there we have our footer content i i
09:30 - told it to be a height of 80. normally
09:32 - there's enough content on a page to
09:34 - where the footer doesn't have to be big
09:36 - like that but i went ahead and made it
09:37 - big you can see within just a few
09:39 - minutes we have this really really
09:40 - pretty modern looking layout uh there's
09:43 - surprisingly little anything going on on
09:46 - the page just a few lines no css styles
09:49 - anywhere right so what we see right here
09:51 - is all there is let's say we wanted to
09:53 - abstract the header out into its own
09:55 - react component i could just copy this
09:57 - and do header
09:59 - and then literally paste that into the
10:01 - header component where i want it and i'm
10:03 - not worrying about style sheets i'm not
10:05 - worrying about anything what you see is
10:07 - what you get if you want to come in and
10:09 - make tweaks it's simple to come in and
10:11 - see exactly where the styles for this
10:13 - logo are coming from or where are the
10:15 - styles for this thing coming from
10:17 - they're right here next to the content
10:19 - uh
10:20 - in the past we would have said that's a
10:21 - no-no you need to separate your markup
10:23 - from your styles and have clean markup
10:25 - but at the end of the day what do you
10:26 - really want to accomplish you want to
10:28 - get features done you want to be able to
10:30 - troubleshoot features easily
10:32 - and all that is right here on this page
10:35 - if you use css utility classes
10:38 - and honestly i don't see a good argument
10:40 - why you wouldn't use tailwind it's just
10:41 - so simple and nice so let's get into how
10:44 - you actually configure this tailwind
10:47 - css
10:48 - all these styles these generated styles
10:50 - how you configure these to your document
10:53 - all right well there's definitely no one
10:55 - way that people bundle their css and
10:57 - package things for production
10:59 - the what we want to do across all
11:01 - platforms and deployment methods is
11:02 - really the same for tailwind we want to
11:04 - build our own version of this css file
11:06 - that's where the classes are based on
11:08 - the colors we pick and the the widths
11:10 - and the margins that we choose and then
11:12 - we want to strip out all of the uh
11:15 - styles all the css classes that we are
11:17 - not using so this is as small as
11:18 - possible so to do that let's go ahead
11:20 - and just open up and create an npm
11:23 - package for this repo
11:25 - and then we are going to install three
11:27 - packages tailwind css post css and auto
11:31 - prefixer
11:37 - okay now we can run npx tailwind init
11:42 - and this will create our tailwind config
11:44 - js file this is basically going to say
11:47 - hey anything you want to configure about
11:49 - tailwind
11:50 - go for it
11:51 - so now we basically just have to run one
11:54 - command which is npx tailwind
11:58 - dash o and then what we want our output
12:01 - file to be so i'll just say tailwind.css
12:05 - and it's going to generate a ton css
12:07 - file
12:08 - from this configuration we have right
12:10 - here boom there you go the entire
12:12 - tailwind css file and if i do uh node
12:16 - environment equals production
12:22 - then you can see that it will try to
12:23 - purge all the css styles that are not
12:26 - there now we've not provided a path for
12:28 - where all of our html is uh but once we
12:31 - provide that path it will strip out all
12:33 - the styles that are not used uh so let's
12:36 - go ahead and customize this a little bit
12:38 - here
12:39 - one great thing about the tail and
12:40 - documentation is it shows you how to
12:42 - customize each and every possible thing
12:45 - you want to do so let's pull that up
12:46 - real quick
12:47 - okay if i go here to documentation and
12:50 - colors you can see all the lovely colors
12:52 - that they give us and if we want to
12:54 - customize them we just pick colors so
12:56 - let's go ahead and say colors
12:59 - i'll call this primary
13:01 - now let's make primary
13:03 - a nice fire engine red this lovely ugly
13:06 - color that no one would ever use in
13:08 - their website another command that i can
13:10 - run here is i can run tailwind
13:13 - w which is going to watch for file
13:15 - changes and whenever i hit save then
13:17 - it's automatically going to regenerate
13:19 - my tailwind css file now i can
13:22 - incorporate my tail1css file right here
13:28 - and what i've done now is i've lost all
13:30 - my colors
13:32 - and but what i do have is availability
13:34 - of my new colors uh i usually don't like
13:37 - to do this what i usually like to do is
13:38 - actually uh say extend the colors
13:42 - so let's actually change colors here
13:44 - with extend i'm gonna move this out
13:47 - and move it in here that way i get to
13:49 - keep all of the colors that i have built
13:51 - in
13:53 - and i also have my new colors so i have
13:55 - a new color called primary let's go over
13:57 - to index and let's make this learn more
14:00 - button have a bg of primary
14:04 - and now there's that fire engine red
14:06 - that we are all expecting to know and
14:07 - love there
14:08 - and that's kind of how you extend your
14:10 - colors same thing with your margins
14:12 - let's go over here to our margins
14:15 - and you can see that it's called spacing
14:18 - if you want to extend your default
14:19 - spacing scale which is right here
14:22 - you can add anything of your own you can
14:24 - customize what exists
14:26 - override what exists or add your own
14:28 - independent values so let's say i needed
14:30 - some really
14:31 - large spacing for some reason
14:37 - so now i have access to w slash massive
14:41 - if i want to make something with massive
14:43 - let's say this learn more button you're
14:45 - gonna be a width of massive
14:48 - and of course it's just well it's big
14:51 - it's really big so that's basically how
14:54 - you override or extend uh your css
14:57 - styles uh pretty pretty simple last of
15:00 - all let's go ahead and show you how you
15:02 - can go ahead and purge those unwanted
15:04 - styles it's pretty simple they already
15:06 - set up a purge option right here so i
15:09 - can just go
15:10 - let's see star
15:14 - we're going to say any html file is what
15:16 - we are going to purge let's see if
15:18 - anything happened here
15:19 - let me see how many lines this had
15:21 - before
15:22 - purge let's see we're looking at
15:25 - and ninety thousand
15:26 - six hundred and fourteen lines now let's
15:29 - go ahead and run our production
15:32 - ta-da and we're down to
15:34 - 798 lines
15:36 - way fewer styles a tiny little css file
15:39 - compared to what it was so that's as
15:41 - simple as it gets in terms of wanting to
15:44 - purge things uh you can also say that
15:46 - anything in your components if you're
15:47 - doing react
15:49 - you can say any js file we're also going
15:51 - to look at that it's smart enough to
15:52 - look at your jsx code so that's tailwind
15:56 - that's css utility classes
15:58 - honestly i'm never ever ever going back
16:01 - from using this watch me change my mind
16:03 - two years from now as something awesome
16:05 - and new comes out to replace it but i
16:07 - highly encourage you to use tailwind on
16:09 - your next project you're just going to
16:10 - be really happy not only when you start
16:12 - off the project but a year afterwards
16:15 - when you're having to maintain this
16:16 - thing and you've forgotten all about how
16:18 - you set everything up that's my favorite
16:20 - thing about tailwhen you come back to a
16:22 - page you instantly know what's going on
16:24 - there's no guesswork uh all the styles
16:27 - for this button are right there um it's
16:29 - just really cool so hope you guys enjoy
16:31 - this tutorial have a good one and as
16:33 - always if you subscribe you'll get
16:35 - notified first and i always answer
16:37 - questions on my new videos in the next
16:39 - couple days so catch you guys around
16:53 - you

Cleaned transcript:

for those of you who have heard of tailwind over the last few years tailwind css but i've never gotten a chance to dig in or at least maybe you have some exposure but you just don't quote get it uh this video is really a must watch for any of you guys tailwind is an extraordinary utility class library for css and if the idea of css utility classes is new to you you've got to give me at least three minutes here to show you how awesome of a concept this is whether you use tailwind or not because at first glance most people say what's the point i don't get it but once you get it oh wow you never want to go back to writing css the same way again especially in your component driven javascript apps like if you do react.js or vue.js applications wow tailwind absolutely shines here and saves so much time so let's get into it i'll show you the true basics and then we'll dive a little bit deeper after that so i'm going to start with a basic html file and all you have to do is add tailwind css to get started now this is not a production worthy setup taiwan basically gives you thousands and thousands of classes and then in production all the ones you don't use get stripped out and what these utility classes allow you to do is never go to a style sheet and write css instead you use those utility classes to accomplish what you want to accomplish so let's see uh hi make sure i got a live reloading setup you see there's a nice css reset going on with tailwind every single element has essentially no style to it so what you want to do is you want to create a let's do a div with a class here let's add a background color to it tailwind gives me a bunch of different colors i can go red 500 red 800 red 200. green 200 and if i customize the config then these colors can all be colors that actually come from my color palette for the app i'm working on uh but for now i'm just going to leave the default config here let's go back with that red 400 now let's do a text of whites now at first you're probably thinking how do i know what all these classes are and at first you'll want to have the documentation up when you start with tailwind that only lasts a couple hours a couple days at the most because how many css classes and styles do you really use throughout the day for margins it's pretty easy uh let's add a padding of two that's going to add a padding everywhere let's say we want padding of x and y so px to be eight so our left and right are going to have a stronger one and they go with the grid system so 2 4 6 8 12 16 32 24 and again those those margins are configurable if you want them to be which we'll get into a little later let's also say our margins are two let's say m t which is m top or m b right we have m x and y for x and y m t b l r for margin top left bottom right so i'll go on mt of 12 and it's just really really fast what you're noticing is i've not had to leave the html at all so far i'm able to just right away as i'm writing out the content i can spit out the classes and have my style baked right in now for some people it drives them a little bit nuts at first that you have extra classes but especially if you're in react land or working on component style work what's incredible is if i want to move this to any other component i literally just cut it out and then paste it where i want it all the style moved with it there is no css file there is no css file anywhere and i've been able to build an entire very large scale applications with no css files no cascading styles of any kind it's really really phenomenal the speed is so fast and the peace of mind and reusability you get it's just great you focus on building features not on figuring out how the css works you also get responsiveness built in so i can use md lg xl these are kind of predefined breakpoints i could make my own if i wanted to in the config you know called super large but what i can do here is let's say this margin top is 12 that's for mobile but for medium screens i want to make margin top of 24. basically all the classes you get just prefix them with md colon and on large screens i want to empty 35 let's go something big 64. so now as i expand my screen boop boop it continues to bounce down i have responsive stuff built in anything you can do i could also make the large have a different color so when i go large i get the black text anything you can automatically do with classes you also get classes for the responsive styles uh there's also hover styles so if i want to go hover bg is black so now if i hover it goes to black and i can also add transitions a duration of 500 that gives an automatic transition nice let's say i want that to be a little faster 200 milliseconds faster transition uh just so many cool things you can do without really trying or thinking too much about it uh so let's go ahead and build out a full layout i'm not i'm going to fast forward through a lot of the parts so there's nothing mundane happening and i will stop and comment here and there uh but let's show you just how fast and easy it is to build out a beautiful layout with tailwind all right so the first thing we're going to want is a nice big header maybe that's got some sort of hero background image but for now we can use tailwind's gradient backgrounds which are super nice so this is going to be a gradient from the top left to the bottom right there we go we've got that nice gradient header that's 80 height and i had a flex column so i can stack some things top to bottom let's add maybe a logo a menu and a user menu in here okay i've added my menu things up top this will be my logo it's got a width of 40. uh then flex one for the middle so this is going to automatically uh flex no matter how big the screen gets and then this also has a fixed width of 40 here on the right uh you can see that i easily just say hey flex item center width full and it automatically takes care of everything so flex is super useful i added flex column to this so i can now add some other things stacking boom boom boom uh so let's go ahead and have add like a tagline and a button and then we'll add a hero type of callout down below nice there we go um i added test white let's say text of white there we go uh nice and white let's add a button awesome we've got a button here and as you hover the color changes a little bit uh i did a shadow let me on hover make the shadow go bigger there we go ah that's a little bit big maybe i'll go shadow large instead of xl on hover nice and just a quick little moment so you can see i'm not really using anything fancy i'm using text white text size uh rounded background colors uh hover duration everything i already showed you i'm just reusing those same ones okay so i added font bold and then font light so that way this has a bold font that has a skinny little light font uh let's see no nothing else really text sizes shadow that's a new one that i added but really you can build these pretty cool layouts pretty fast with all the basic stuff you already know uh let me go ahead and make like some sort of callout thing that overlaps here it has a sort of negative margin to it i'm gonna go down to the next section okay i've added a hero call out here uh we have flex flex column i have the items being centered i have a negative margin here uh on the top i that probably only has to have a negative margin on the top uh let's see uh margin bottom is 10 pixels then i did this hover margin i forgot that that is not actually supported out of the box you can configure that to work but uh that would be nice if when you kind of hovered over it it slid up a little bit you can configure that and then the actual box just is rounded white background you can see it's all just kind of normal stuff i gave it a border color told it to be half width so that way it's basically a 50 width no matter how big the screen gets this is not super complex stuff let's go ahead and add a footer on here and i feel like we've got our basic layout done in just a couple minutes there we have our footer content i i told it to be a height of 80. normally there's enough content on a page to where the footer doesn't have to be big like that but i went ahead and made it big you can see within just a few minutes we have this really really pretty modern looking layout uh there's surprisingly little anything going on on the page just a few lines no css styles anywhere right so what we see right here is all there is let's say we wanted to abstract the header out into its own react component i could just copy this and do header and then literally paste that into the header component where i want it and i'm not worrying about style sheets i'm not worrying about anything what you see is what you get if you want to come in and make tweaks it's simple to come in and see exactly where the styles for this logo are coming from or where are the styles for this thing coming from they're right here next to the content uh in the past we would have said that's a nono you need to separate your markup from your styles and have clean markup but at the end of the day what do you really want to accomplish you want to get features done you want to be able to troubleshoot features easily and all that is right here on this page if you use css utility classes and honestly i don't see a good argument why you wouldn't use tailwind it's just so simple and nice so let's get into how you actually configure this tailwind css all these styles these generated styles how you configure these to your document all right well there's definitely no one way that people bundle their css and package things for production the what we want to do across all platforms and deployment methods is really the same for tailwind we want to build our own version of this css file that's where the classes are based on the colors we pick and the the widths and the margins that we choose and then we want to strip out all of the uh styles all the css classes that we are not using so this is as small as possible so to do that let's go ahead and just open up and create an npm package for this repo and then we are going to install three packages tailwind css post css and auto prefixer okay now we can run npx tailwind init and this will create our tailwind config js file this is basically going to say hey anything you want to configure about tailwind go for it so now we basically just have to run one command which is npx tailwind dash o and then what we want our output file to be so i'll just say tailwind.css and it's going to generate a ton css file from this configuration we have right here boom there you go the entire tailwind css file and if i do uh node environment equals production then you can see that it will try to purge all the css styles that are not there now we've not provided a path for where all of our html is uh but once we provide that path it will strip out all the styles that are not used uh so let's go ahead and customize this a little bit here one great thing about the tail and documentation is it shows you how to customize each and every possible thing you want to do so let's pull that up real quick okay if i go here to documentation and colors you can see all the lovely colors that they give us and if we want to customize them we just pick colors so let's go ahead and say colors i'll call this primary now let's make primary a nice fire engine red this lovely ugly color that no one would ever use in their website another command that i can run here is i can run tailwind w which is going to watch for file changes and whenever i hit save then it's automatically going to regenerate my tailwind css file now i can incorporate my tail1css file right here and what i've done now is i've lost all my colors and but what i do have is availability of my new colors uh i usually don't like to do this what i usually like to do is actually uh say extend the colors so let's actually change colors here with extend i'm gonna move this out and move it in here that way i get to keep all of the colors that i have built in and i also have my new colors so i have a new color called primary let's go over to index and let's make this learn more button have a bg of primary and now there's that fire engine red that we are all expecting to know and love there and that's kind of how you extend your colors same thing with your margins let's go over here to our margins and you can see that it's called spacing if you want to extend your default spacing scale which is right here you can add anything of your own you can customize what exists override what exists or add your own independent values so let's say i needed some really large spacing for some reason so now i have access to w slash massive if i want to make something with massive let's say this learn more button you're gonna be a width of massive and of course it's just well it's big it's really big so that's basically how you override or extend uh your css styles uh pretty pretty simple last of all let's go ahead and show you how you can go ahead and purge those unwanted styles it's pretty simple they already set up a purge option right here so i can just go let's see star we're going to say any html file is what we are going to purge let's see if anything happened here let me see how many lines this had before purge let's see we're looking at and ninety thousand six hundred and fourteen lines now let's go ahead and run our production tada and we're down to 798 lines way fewer styles a tiny little css file compared to what it was so that's as simple as it gets in terms of wanting to purge things uh you can also say that anything in your components if you're doing react you can say any js file we're also going to look at that it's smart enough to look at your jsx code so that's tailwind that's css utility classes honestly i'm never ever ever going back from using this watch me change my mind two years from now as something awesome and new comes out to replace it but i highly encourage you to use tailwind on your next project you're just going to be really happy not only when you start off the project but a year afterwards when you're having to maintain this thing and you've forgotten all about how you set everything up that's my favorite thing about tailwhen you come back to a page you instantly know what's going on there's no guesswork uh all the styles for this button are right there um it's just really cool so hope you guys enjoy this tutorial have a good one and as always if you subscribe you'll get notified first and i always answer questions on my new videos in the next couple days so catch you guys around you
