01:24 - talking about these keyboards these are
01:27 - super ergonomic ortho linear fully
01:29 - programmable keyboards or ortho linear
01:32 - means they are straight they're not like
01:35 - angled like circa 1983 or whatever like
01:38 - all the other keyboards have been for
01:39 - the last hundred years these are
01:41 - actually the way our fingers want to be
01:42 - when they type and you can program any
01:45 - key to be absolutely any key any
01:47 - modifier any combination of keys you can
01:49 - do layers
01:50 - all sorts of cool things you can do with
01:52 - the ergodox keyboard the ergodox is not
01:54 - unique to ergodox ez
01:57 - they're just the only people mass
01:58 - manufacturing it at scale and in a good
02:00 - quality that i'm aware of i've seen some
02:02 - other companies but i'm not sure how
02:04 - good they are and these guys are doing
02:06 - it right
02:07 - let's get this guy plugged in and then
02:09 - i'll mess with the keycaps i'm really
02:11 - excited to feel the keycaps but i'm
02:13 - really also excited to see it glow
02:15 - so uh
02:16 - let's get this plug in
02:23 - okay we're plugged in and you don't see
02:25 - anything yet uh because i've got to turn
02:27 - on these animations now i've changed my
02:29 - keyboard layout but i believe
02:31 - yep there we go got it boom
02:33 - color backlit now i have super bright
02:36 - video lighting on um so i'm gonna i'm
02:39 - gonna get that video lighting turned off
02:41 - chad hit the lights
02:42 - okay there we go we got most of the
02:44 - lighting off you can see i got this
02:45 - lovely red by default
02:48 - and i'm pretty positive i can change
02:50 - through the hue yep i can change to any
02:52 - hue that i'd like
02:54 - also any brightness
02:56 - and then i should have a bunch of
02:58 - animations here by pressing this button
03:02 - rainbow flavor and it's changing it's
03:04 - animating okay lovely like i've always
03:06 - wanted the backlit keycaps to land on
03:08 - the ergodox ez and these are absolutely
03:12 - beautiful all sorts of like twinkling
03:14 - effects and
03:16 - crazy rainbows and slow rainbows and
03:19 - all sorts of cool stuff and then the
03:21 - solid colors and you can fully customize
03:23 - this to do anything you want now one of
03:24 - the things i've had in mind thinking of
03:26 - this
03:27 - i'm gonna get the lights back on chad
03:29 - lights one of the things i've been
03:31 - thinking about this is because you can
03:32 - customize anything about the ergodox
03:35 - is it'd be kind of cool to see
03:36 - notifications up here in colors like if
03:39 - you have a meeting showing up or various
03:41 - notifications you want i'm interested in
03:43 - seeing if i can get that programmed i
03:44 - may circle back we'll see how much free
03:46 - time i have i have twin newborns i don't
03:48 - have a lot of free time right now but
03:51 - this thing is cool okay now for the key
03:52 - switches let's let's pretend to type
03:54 - here
03:55 - [Applause]
04:01 - these feel to me like
04:03 - my favorite key switch of all time which
04:05 - is the mattias quiet click key switch
04:08 - um
04:11 - yeah
04:13 - yes okay so my favorite key switch of
04:15 - all time hands down is the matthias
04:16 - quiet click it's very unique i'm sure
04:18 - not everyone loves it but i absolutely
04:20 - love it it's it's got a very gentile
04:23 - tactile bump very gentile
04:25 - gentle tactile bump you can feel it on
04:28 - there but it's super gentle and when you
04:30 - bottom out it's really really quiet and
04:32 - that is exactly what these feel like let
04:35 - me give you for context
04:36 - my daily driver keyboard exact same
04:38 - keyboard but gator on browns
04:42 - tactile
04:43 - um
04:48 - that
04:51 - okay you can even you can even hear the
04:53 - difference it's more less of a clack and
04:55 - more of like a clud
04:57 - thuddy clack
04:59 - less of a click and more like
05:01 - and i'm loving loving loving that
05:04 - i would absolutely a thousand times over
05:08 - pick the kale key switches
05:11 - over the gatoron
05:13 - browns and over cherry mx key switches i
05:16 - like wouldn't even think about it i
05:17 - these are these key switch that i love
05:21 - these feel so similar
05:23 - and it's been a while because i i don't
05:24 - own a mattias quiet click but they in my
05:27 - mind they're giving me the emotional
05:29 - feeling that i had when i used to use
05:30 - that um and i'm loving this
05:35 - and my wife will like it too because
05:37 - it's at least half the volume of gator
05:39 - on browns already
05:40 - oh i'm loving this keyboard i like want
05:42 - to do a happy dance right now like
05:45 - okay
05:46 - um
05:47 - i don't know what else there is to say
05:49 - except for maybe a couple features that
05:50 - people might not have seen if they
05:51 - haven't watched my other ones the
05:53 - tenting on these things are awesome
05:54 - they've got these little tenting pegs
05:56 - that are adjustable
05:58 - multiple directional and you can kind of
06:00 - tent it to your liking and it also comes
06:02 - with the
06:04 - wings
06:06 - wings um
06:08 - which are
06:09 - super cool they're like a very solid
06:11 - rubbery thing and uh they go right there
06:13 - and your wrists can rest on them but i'm
06:15 - not going to take the time to unbox them
06:16 - right now
06:17 - honestly not too much else to say
06:20 - i'm just like throwing stuff going crazy
06:22 - not too much else to say except for
06:25 - this thing is super cool
06:28 - the custom printed keycaps where you see
06:30 - the glowing coming straight through i
06:31 - mean that's that's a nice touch they
06:34 - feel awesome which is good because i
06:36 - would have been kind of depressed if
06:37 - there's this great new backlit feature
06:39 - but the key key switches feel terrible
06:42 - um the the quality of the keycaps
06:43 - themselves i think might have some to
06:45 - contribute to the niceness of how it
06:47 - feels and
06:50 - i'm really excited to use this stinky
06:51 - keyboard every day
06:53 - nothing else to say except for i love
06:55 - the ergodox keyboard in general it's
06:56 - worth the
06:58 - approximately one to four weeks it takes
07:01 - to learn to retype differently
07:04 - with custom programmed hotkeys and all
07:05 - that stuff but
07:07 - super fun i'll put a link in the
07:08 - description to where you can get this
07:09 - guy and
07:12 - i could wholeheartedly recommend this
07:13 - keyboard it's a blast already i'm
07:16 - want to go code now and stop talking to
