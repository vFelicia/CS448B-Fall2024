00:01 - hey hey we're going to be learning
00:02 - JavaScript today and I am super excited
00:04 - about this because this is where you
00:06 - move from designer world to developer
00:09 - World HTML CSS hey that stuff's great
00:12 - it's considered more A Little More
00:14 - Design because it's outputting looks and
00:18 - when you move JavaScript now you're
00:20 - starting to move into functionality and
00:22 - the good news is is if you learn
00:23 - JavaScript you're set up to learn a
00:25 - bunch of other languages cuz programming
00:27 - is programming is programming they're
00:28 - all very very very similar um so what
00:31 - we're going to do is go ahe to open up
00:33 - Google Chrome and hit view developer
00:36 - JavaScript console or if you're on the
00:38 - Mac App uh Apple Alt J or command Alt J
00:42 - so I can hit command Alt J and toggle
00:43 - listing open closed Chrome you can do
00:46 - JavaScript two ways you can do it in
00:47 - your HTML code like in your text editor
00:51 - or to learn it and to do a lot of things
00:52 - you can do it straight in the browser
00:54 - this is the easiest way to learn so this
00:56 - is what we're going to do cuz basically
00:58 - we're typing real time into JavaScript
01:00 - and it's going to real time give us what
01:02 - we're doing so for instance I can go
01:04 - alert open up a colon and then go in
01:08 - quotes hi there close out the colon and
01:12 - hit semicolon or not colon these are uh
01:15 - whatever they're called brackets braces
01:18 - uh so there you go alert hi there and
01:20 - look we created an alert and it says hi
01:23 - there so that's great there you go
01:25 - you're a programmer um I can also go
01:28 - alerts you can do two commands on one
01:32 - line as long as there's a semicolon
01:35 - there it's going to know that you're
01:36 - done with a command and it's going to
01:37 - look for the next thing as a new
01:41 - command so that's one of the important
01:43 - things of semicolons hi there I say okay
01:46 - hi again see programming is not that
01:49 - terrifying people it's it's not this
01:51 - actual other language people call them
01:53 - languages but the languages are in
01:55 - English it's more or less just a list of
01:57 - commands so another thing you can do is
01:59 - console we're in the console right now
02:01 - so I can do
02:04 - console.log hi there oh and then it
02:06 - spits out hi there and so now I can go
02:09 - console.log high there
02:11 - alert hi there so now it's going to log
02:15 - High there and then it's immediately
02:16 - going to alert hi there so there you go
02:19 - so that's kind of your Basics I'm
02:20 - running commands and I'm putting in the
02:23 - commands my they're called arguments uh
02:26 - I'm basically telling the command alert
02:28 - whatever I give you as an argument so in
02:30 - this case I'm telling it to alert a text
02:33 - string of hi there let's get into what
02:35 - is a text string I just use that weird
02:38 - word don't don't freak out on me it just
02:40 - basically means remember that all these
02:42 - characters are a thing so if I go hi
02:45 - there it knows that hi there is a text
02:48 - string let me kind of tell you the
02:50 - difference between a text string and a
02:52 - non-text string uh or a string so if I
02:56 - go two if I go 20 it does not know that
02:59 - that's the number 20 it just knows that
03:01 - that's a string I.E it's a letter two
03:05 - and a letter zero if I do 20 without
03:08 - quotes well okay now it knows that
03:10 - that's a number see if you spit out
03:12 - there's no quotes there it knows that
03:14 - that's the number 20 here watch let me
03:16 - show you something if I do quotes and go
03:17 - 20 + 1 it's a string it's a two a zero a
03:22 - space A plus a space a one that's what a
03:25 - string type is it's not smart it just
03:28 - knows it's these characters if I go 20 +
03:30 - 1 well now it's doing math for me cuz
03:32 - I'm using numbers so that's kind of the
03:35 - difference between a string type and a
03:37 - number type they're called types um and
03:39 - that's that's a key word you want to
03:41 - remember as you move forward is there's
03:43 - probably five types in JavaScript uh
03:46 - maybe there's six there's there's
03:48 - basically just a few types not an
03:50 - endless amount of types string and
03:51 - number are things you'll have in any any
03:54 - any programming language um and across
03:57 - most languages these are going to be the
03:58 - same so let's get into how we actually
04:00 - do programming and then once we kind of
04:02 - get comfortable with the basics of
04:04 - programming the next video I'll show you
04:06 - how to actually do some stuff on your
04:08 - web page with it but first we got to get
04:10 - a little bit more comfortable uh with
04:12 - JavaScript as a language so I'm going to
04:14 - clear this out I'm going to introduce
04:16 - the concept of variables a variable it's
04:19 - just a lot easier to think of it as a
04:21 - container tell you what I won't even
04:22 - explain it I'll just show you how it
04:23 - works it'll make sense their name so I'm
04:26 - making a variable called name equals
04:28 - will there we go so now I basically said
04:31 - hey name equals will so anytime I hit
04:33 - name it goes huh
04:35 - will so if I go alert name without
04:39 - quotes I'm not giving it a string now
04:41 - I'm giving it a variable which is
04:44 - already defined my name is Will so if I
04:46 - hit alert it says will let's do that
04:48 - again I'm going let's go let's call this
04:51 - one
04:52 - message
04:54 - equals hello
04:57 - there so now I can go alert
05:00 - message hello there if I go
05:05 - alert messaging
05:07 - quotes then it says message because I
05:10 - gave it a string I didn't give it a
05:12 - variable I didn't give it a container we
05:14 - already defined I gave this a brand new
05:16 - thing that I created as a string anytime
05:18 - I do quotes I'm creating a new thing I'm
05:20 - creating a new string if that makes
05:23 - sense what happens if you try to alert
05:25 - something you haven't defined yet
05:27 - alert um new message
05:30 - which we've not created it says app new
05:32 - message is not defined you haven't
05:34 - created something called New Message
05:36 - yet well let's make a variable called
05:38 - New
05:42 - Message now I can do alert new message
05:44 - and there you go my new message so hope
05:46 - that wasn't too redundant for you but
05:48 - that's kind of how you're going to do
05:50 - things I can also create a variable
05:51 - called my number and I can make this one
05:55 - a number instead
05:57 - of um so now if I do my number it knows
06:01 - 200 and notice there's no quotes around
06:03 - it it knows that it's a it knows that
06:06 - it's an integer or a number so what I
06:08 - can do is bear my
06:11 - age equals 33 shh don't tell anyone so
06:15 - now I can go my
06:18 - age plus
06:20 - 20 if I spelled my age
06:23 - correctly it knows that in 20 years I'll
06:25 - be
06:26 - 53 so you can do math with variables if
06:29 - as far as JavaScript is concerned there
06:31 - is no difference between saying my age
06:33 - equals 20 and going 33 + 20 it's like
06:37 - well let's just look up what my age is
06:39 - okay my age is exactly the same as 33 so
06:42 - what variables do is they give you the
06:43 - ability to store information and pull it
06:46 - back up at a later time this is very
06:48 - very useful it's basically the core of
06:50 - programming you're saving information
06:53 - you're looking it up at another time so
06:56 - let's get into an if else statement if
07:00 - you're not in too far over your head if
07:02 - not just watch the video over again it
07:04 - it'll make sense pretty quickly for you
07:06 - we can do this let me
07:09 - Define
07:11 - age equals 33 again not I don't know why
07:15 - I did triple equals so age is
07:18 - 33 and I'm going to go if and then I'm
07:22 - going to do brackets again age is less
07:25 - than remember from your math School
07:27 - greater than less than symbols yep so
07:29 - age is on the little side of the arrow
07:31 - so if age is less than
07:34 - 35 and then I'm going to do these guys
07:38 - and then for this you're going to have
07:39 - to hold shift and hit enter Because if
07:40 - you hit enter it's going to execute the
07:42 - command so I hit shift and hit
07:47 - enter I'm going to go you're still
07:53 - young and then I'm going to hit shift
07:55 - and enter again and I'm going to close
07:57 - out that bracket so let's look at what I
07:59 - did I said we're going to do a check
08:00 - here if and then whatever is in here
08:02 - equals
08:04 - true then it's going to go execute
08:07 - whatever's between these braces which in
08:09 - this case is just a single alert so at
08:12 - this point I go if my age is younger
08:14 - than 35 alert that I'm still young let's
08:16 - hit enter and see what happens still
08:19 - young so now watch this I'll go age I
08:23 - don't have to hit ver because age has
08:24 - already been
08:28 - defined a age equal 37 now you only need
08:31 - to use ver the very first time you're oh
08:34 - yeah for very first time you only have
08:36 - to use ver the very first time you're
08:38 - defining a
08:39 - variable so now if I run the same thing
08:41 - if age is less than
08:44 - 35 nope doesn't alert that I'm still
08:46 - young so what I can do now is I can go
08:50 - else holding shift and return
08:53 - again so if age is less than 35 alert
08:56 - still
08:58 - young
09:02 - oh oh man getting old so now it's going
09:05 - to check it out if you're if you're
09:07 - younger than 35 or if this number is
09:09 - less than 35 alert that you're young
09:11 - else alert getting old and this is
09:14 - called an if statement and then it's an
09:16 - if else statement uh and that's another
09:18 - core thing that you're going to use
09:19 - programming in any language it's just
09:22 - for checking stuff out say you've
09:24 - downloaded the user from Twitter and you
09:27 - want to see if they have tweets
09:29 - if uh if tweets let me see uh let me
09:33 - give you an example of what we do
09:38 - here tweet count equals zero so then you
09:42 - can go you know you've loaded up your
09:43 - user if tweet
09:45 - count is less than
09:54 - one you need to make some
09:58 - tweets
09:59 - and so it's going to alert that to the
10:00 - user or it's going to spit out a message
10:03 - on the page it's going to do something
10:04 - that's a lot prettier than this ugly
10:05 - generic alert um so that's kind of the
10:08 - concept of how you use JavaScript in
10:10 - programming uh you can also say if
10:13 - there's more than five tweets then you
10:15 - only show five if you know you can this
10:17 - is basically where you get some of those
10:19 - programming basics in there um let's do
10:24 - one more thing and then we'll move on to
10:26 - in the next video where we actually do
10:27 - some cool fun stuff in our page if
10:30 - you're not freaking out so far we we did
10:31 - a string type we did a number type we
10:33 - did if else let's do some arrays so
10:38 - arrays are the third type we're going to
10:40 - learn in javascripts clear that
10:43 - again my list an array is basically a
10:46 - list of things and a an array is done
10:49 - with brackets so whenever you do
10:52 - brackets like that it creates something
10:54 - of an array type and what you do is you
10:56 - just give it a bunch of
10:58 - values uh I'll do a grocery list here so
11:01 - eggs and I'm doing each one in quotes
11:05 - you'll notice you can use single quotes
11:06 - or double quotes it's kind of
11:08 - interchangeable with JavaScript eggs
11:12 - milk fruits so now if I go my list I've
11:18 - got a list of three items eggs milk
11:20 - fruit and so that's what an array is an
11:22 - array stores a list of items for you
11:25 - usually if you were to download a
11:27 - friend's list from you know Twitter or
11:30 - whatever you would get an array of all
11:32 - of your friends so that's kind of what
11:34 - arrays are for they're kind of like a
11:36 - ulli thing you know a UL is a list of
11:39 - items and this is kind of the JavaScript
11:41 - equivalent of a UL it's a list of things
11:44 - um so you can go my list zero and that's
11:47 - going to get the first the Zero Entry
11:49 - which is eggs um a lot of people that
11:52 - kind of is weird to them index number
11:54 - zero I thought that was the first item
11:56 - that should be one yeah well for
11:57 - whatever reason programming Lang
11:59 - languages usually use a it's called a
12:01 - zero Index this is zero this is one this
12:06 - is
12:07 - two so I can go my list0 equals and I
12:11 - can change this to a different string I
12:14 - can call it
12:15 - now
12:17 - Vig so now if I go my list you'll notice
12:21 - they work just like variables it's
12:23 - basically just a group of variables
12:25 - except for each one doesn't have a name
12:27 - they have an index now I can go my list
12:30 - to one equals old do one
12:34 - eggs and I go my
12:36 - list so now we go veggies eggs fruit so
12:40 - you notice we're just kind of changing
12:41 - this thing I can also go my list three
12:44 - which there is no three
12:47 - equals I don't know we'll add friends to
12:49 - the
12:51 - list hit my list now we have four things
12:54 - in here and you can also at any point in
12:56 - time go my list. length
12:59 - and see yep we got four items in there
13:01 - so we have four items items 0 1 2 and
13:05 - three which is a little confusing to
13:06 - people but now that you know it you know
13:09 - it um and that's pretty much how you'll
13:12 - use arrays um and if
13:15 - you're um yeah and that's pretty much it
13:19 - we'll go ahead and end this video for
13:21 - now and the next video I want to get you
13:23 - into something that's usable that's fun
13:24 - right away so we're going to skip
13:26 - JavaScript knowledge Point 2.0 and we're
13:29 - just going to go straight into using
13:31 - jQuery to do fun stuff hope you enjoyed
13:33 - this lesson

Cleaned transcript:

hey hey we're going to be learning JavaScript today and I am super excited about this because this is where you move from designer world to developer World HTML CSS hey that stuff's great it's considered more A Little More Design because it's outputting looks and when you move JavaScript now you're starting to move into functionality and the good news is is if you learn JavaScript you're set up to learn a bunch of other languages cuz programming is programming is programming they're all very very very similar um so what we're going to do is go ahe to open up Google Chrome and hit view developer JavaScript console or if you're on the Mac App uh Apple Alt J or command Alt J so I can hit command Alt J and toggle listing open closed Chrome you can do JavaScript two ways you can do it in your HTML code like in your text editor or to learn it and to do a lot of things you can do it straight in the browser this is the easiest way to learn so this is what we're going to do cuz basically we're typing real time into JavaScript and it's going to real time give us what we're doing so for instance I can go alert open up a colon and then go in quotes hi there close out the colon and hit semicolon or not colon these are uh whatever they're called brackets braces uh so there you go alert hi there and look we created an alert and it says hi there so that's great there you go you're a programmer um I can also go alerts you can do two commands on one line as long as there's a semicolon there it's going to know that you're done with a command and it's going to look for the next thing as a new command so that's one of the important things of semicolons hi there I say okay hi again see programming is not that terrifying people it's it's not this actual other language people call them languages but the languages are in English it's more or less just a list of commands so another thing you can do is console we're in the console right now so I can do console.log hi there oh and then it spits out hi there and so now I can go console.log high there alert hi there so now it's going to log High there and then it's immediately going to alert hi there so there you go so that's kind of your Basics I'm running commands and I'm putting in the commands my they're called arguments uh I'm basically telling the command alert whatever I give you as an argument so in this case I'm telling it to alert a text string of hi there let's get into what is a text string I just use that weird word don't don't freak out on me it just basically means remember that all these characters are a thing so if I go hi there it knows that hi there is a text string let me kind of tell you the difference between a text string and a nontext string uh or a string so if I go two if I go 20 it does not know that that's the number 20 it just knows that that's a string I.E it's a letter two and a letter zero if I do 20 without quotes well okay now it knows that that's a number see if you spit out there's no quotes there it knows that that's the number 20 here watch let me show you something if I do quotes and go 20 + 1 it's a string it's a two a zero a space A plus a space a one that's what a string type is it's not smart it just knows it's these characters if I go 20 + 1 well now it's doing math for me cuz I'm using numbers so that's kind of the difference between a string type and a number type they're called types um and that's that's a key word you want to remember as you move forward is there's probably five types in JavaScript uh maybe there's six there's there's basically just a few types not an endless amount of types string and number are things you'll have in any any any programming language um and across most languages these are going to be the same so let's get into how we actually do programming and then once we kind of get comfortable with the basics of programming the next video I'll show you how to actually do some stuff on your web page with it but first we got to get a little bit more comfortable uh with JavaScript as a language so I'm going to clear this out I'm going to introduce the concept of variables a variable it's just a lot easier to think of it as a container tell you what I won't even explain it I'll just show you how it works it'll make sense their name so I'm making a variable called name equals will there we go so now I basically said hey name equals will so anytime I hit name it goes huh will so if I go alert name without quotes I'm not giving it a string now I'm giving it a variable which is already defined my name is Will so if I hit alert it says will let's do that again I'm going let's go let's call this one message equals hello there so now I can go alert message hello there if I go alert messaging quotes then it says message because I gave it a string I didn't give it a variable I didn't give it a container we already defined I gave this a brand new thing that I created as a string anytime I do quotes I'm creating a new thing I'm creating a new string if that makes sense what happens if you try to alert something you haven't defined yet alert um new message which we've not created it says app new message is not defined you haven't created something called New Message yet well let's make a variable called New Message now I can do alert new message and there you go my new message so hope that wasn't too redundant for you but that's kind of how you're going to do things I can also create a variable called my number and I can make this one a number instead of um so now if I do my number it knows 200 and notice there's no quotes around it it knows that it's a it knows that it's an integer or a number so what I can do is bear my age equals 33 shh don't tell anyone so now I can go my age plus 20 if I spelled my age correctly it knows that in 20 years I'll be 53 so you can do math with variables if as far as JavaScript is concerned there is no difference between saying my age equals 20 and going 33 + 20 it's like well let's just look up what my age is okay my age is exactly the same as 33 so what variables do is they give you the ability to store information and pull it back up at a later time this is very very useful it's basically the core of programming you're saving information you're looking it up at another time so let's get into an if else statement if you're not in too far over your head if not just watch the video over again it it'll make sense pretty quickly for you we can do this let me Define age equals 33 again not I don't know why I did triple equals so age is 33 and I'm going to go if and then I'm going to do brackets again age is less than remember from your math School greater than less than symbols yep so age is on the little side of the arrow so if age is less than 35 and then I'm going to do these guys and then for this you're going to have to hold shift and hit enter Because if you hit enter it's going to execute the command so I hit shift and hit enter I'm going to go you're still young and then I'm going to hit shift and enter again and I'm going to close out that bracket so let's look at what I did I said we're going to do a check here if and then whatever is in here equals true then it's going to go execute whatever's between these braces which in this case is just a single alert so at this point I go if my age is younger than 35 alert that I'm still young let's hit enter and see what happens still young so now watch this I'll go age I don't have to hit ver because age has already been defined a age equal 37 now you only need to use ver the very first time you're oh yeah for very first time you only have to use ver the very first time you're defining a variable so now if I run the same thing if age is less than 35 nope doesn't alert that I'm still young so what I can do now is I can go else holding shift and return again so if age is less than 35 alert still young oh oh man getting old so now it's going to check it out if you're if you're younger than 35 or if this number is less than 35 alert that you're young else alert getting old and this is called an if statement and then it's an if else statement uh and that's another core thing that you're going to use programming in any language it's just for checking stuff out say you've downloaded the user from Twitter and you want to see if they have tweets if uh if tweets let me see uh let me give you an example of what we do here tweet count equals zero so then you can go you know you've loaded up your user if tweet count is less than one you need to make some tweets and so it's going to alert that to the user or it's going to spit out a message on the page it's going to do something that's a lot prettier than this ugly generic alert um so that's kind of the concept of how you use JavaScript in programming uh you can also say if there's more than five tweets then you only show five if you know you can this is basically where you get some of those programming basics in there um let's do one more thing and then we'll move on to in the next video where we actually do some cool fun stuff in our page if you're not freaking out so far we we did a string type we did a number type we did if else let's do some arrays so arrays are the third type we're going to learn in javascripts clear that again my list an array is basically a list of things and a an array is done with brackets so whenever you do brackets like that it creates something of an array type and what you do is you just give it a bunch of values uh I'll do a grocery list here so eggs and I'm doing each one in quotes you'll notice you can use single quotes or double quotes it's kind of interchangeable with JavaScript eggs milk fruits so now if I go my list I've got a list of three items eggs milk fruit and so that's what an array is an array stores a list of items for you usually if you were to download a friend's list from you know Twitter or whatever you would get an array of all of your friends so that's kind of what arrays are for they're kind of like a ulli thing you know a UL is a list of items and this is kind of the JavaScript equivalent of a UL it's a list of things um so you can go my list zero and that's going to get the first the Zero Entry which is eggs um a lot of people that kind of is weird to them index number zero I thought that was the first item that should be one yeah well for whatever reason programming Lang languages usually use a it's called a zero Index this is zero this is one this is two so I can go my list0 equals and I can change this to a different string I can call it now Vig so now if I go my list you'll notice they work just like variables it's basically just a group of variables except for each one doesn't have a name they have an index now I can go my list to one equals old do one eggs and I go my list so now we go veggies eggs fruit so you notice we're just kind of changing this thing I can also go my list three which there is no three equals I don't know we'll add friends to the list hit my list now we have four things in here and you can also at any point in time go my list. length and see yep we got four items in there so we have four items items 0 1 2 and three which is a little confusing to people but now that you know it you know it um and that's pretty much how you'll use arrays um and if you're um yeah and that's pretty much it we'll go ahead and end this video for now and the next video I want to get you into something that's usable that's fun right away so we're going to skip JavaScript knowledge Point 2.0 and we're just going to go straight into using jQuery to do fun stuff hope you enjoyed this lesson
