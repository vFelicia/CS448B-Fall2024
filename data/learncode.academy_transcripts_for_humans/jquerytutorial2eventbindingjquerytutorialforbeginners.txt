00:01 - okay so jQuery lesson number two if you
00:03 - missed lesson number one I'm going to
00:04 - put the link in the description you're
00:06 - definitely going to want to see that I'm
00:07 - also going to get a link on the screen
00:09 - here you should see that if you're not
00:10 - on mobile let's move forward so in the
00:13 - last lesson I showed you how to do
00:14 - jQuery actions um or methods as they're
00:17 - called uh one I didn't show you is the
00:20 - HTML method so if I go btn1 let's get
00:23 - grab button one I can do HTML and I can
00:26 - actually change what's in the HTML code
00:29 - so right now the code is just that
00:30 - button one text so now it's called my
00:33 - button that's kind of fun so what I
00:35 - actually got to do is I got to rewrite
00:37 - what's inside of that HTML element let's
00:40 - look at panel one here that's this guy
00:42 - this div um and what I get to do here is
00:46 - I can actually rewrite the entire inside
00:48 - of it so I can go if I do panel
00:52 - one HTML my panel so there you go all
00:57 - the elements are gone that were inside
00:58 - and now the only thing inside of it is
01:00 - text that says my panel I can even add
01:03 - new
01:06 - tags bold not
01:08 - bolts this isn't too good of an idea to
01:11 - do very much of but you can do a little
01:13 - bit you can add a tag or two and it's
01:15 - not considered a bad practice okay so we
01:17 - know how to do jQuery methods so let's
01:20 - listen to what the user doing and do
01:23 - methods when the user interacts with our
01:25 - page so we're going to do is let's give
01:27 - an example when we click on button one I
01:29 - want this panel to show and hide so
01:32 - let's go button one we start with the
01:34 - thing we're wanting to listen to and the
01:36 - method is called on and then we give it
01:39 - a event name this is a JavaScript event
01:42 - name so I'm going to go on click the
01:45 - first these are called arguments that
01:47 - I'm passing here the first thing I'm
01:48 - giving it is listen to The Click event
01:51 - and then I'm going to go comma and then
01:53 - I'm going to give it my function which
01:54 - you'll recognize from up here open close
01:57 - parenthesis open close curly braces so
02:01 - anything in between those curly braces
02:03 - now will fire whenever the click event
02:06 - takes place so now I can go I'm going to
02:10 - add the pr seed or the semicolon to be a
02:12 - good guy now I can go panel
02:17 - one hide actually I'll just go toggle
02:20 - that way it'll show and hide Whatever It
02:22 - Isn't So when I click on button one it's
02:25 - going to run this function and it's
02:26 - going to toggle panel hey would you
02:29 - check that out
02:30 - let's actually make that slide
02:32 - toggle this is something you use
02:34 - probably I'll make it a slide toggle of
02:37 - 200 there you
02:39 - go slides and is beautiful let's make it
02:43 - when I click on the panel I actually
02:46 - want it to hide that panel
02:50 - itself so when you click on panel
02:52 - one there you go it's gone now I can't
02:55 - actually click it to toggle it back so I
02:57 - have to hit the button to well I took
02:59 - away my button one now didn't I so I
03:01 - can't actually bring it back without
03:03 - refreshing my page um but that's how you
03:06 - would do that if you want to get rid of
03:07 - things I could make an x button inside
03:09 - of here so when you click that x button
03:12 - it tells panel one to go away so I can
03:16 - actually make it fade
03:18 - out that might make a little more sense
03:20 - click and it's gone and that's a lovely
03:22 - way of doing things you'll notice I
03:24 - changed the panel I didn't remove the
03:26 - whole column which is why those things
03:28 - are sitting there so um let's go into a
03:33 - little bit more clever usage of this so
03:36 - let's say we had button one let's assign
03:39 - these buttons to each one of these
03:41 - panels btn1 I think is what they're
03:43 - called btn1 panel one Fade Out There we
03:47 - go I'm going to go button two you're
03:51 - going to do panel two I'm going to do
03:54 - button three does panel three and button
03:57 - four does panel four there you go so now
04:01 - each one of these should go away go away
04:03 - go away go away come back all right did
04:05 - I just do Fade Out yep let's do Fade
04:08 - toggle do my Nifty Sublime Text multiple
04:11 - cursors there there you go any order now
04:14 - I actually have a pretty living
04:16 - breathing page nice let's actually
04:19 - change this event from click to Mouse
04:22 - over something you might want to do
04:28 - sometimes and it's going to going toggle
04:30 - them each time now I get to do some fun
04:32 - crazy you know everybody's got to do
04:34 - that when they make something like that
04:35 - right so there you go and mouse over I
04:38 - can make it to where all it does is Fade
04:41 - Out and you have to click to bring it
04:42 - back
04:45 - in Mouse over it's going to fade out I'm
04:48 - going to copy and paste all of these you
04:50 - notice it's pretty easy to get a mess of
04:52 - jQuery in the next video I'm going to
04:54 - show you how to clean this up cuz this
04:56 - is already kind of too much we don't
04:58 - really want to do it this way um and so
05:01 - then when I click I'm going to tell it
05:03 - to fade back
05:05 - in so now I have four mouseovers on
05:08 - Mouse over we're going to fade out and
05:10 - when we click we're going to fade back
05:11 - in Fade Out Fade Out Fade Out click will
05:14 - bring me back in there we go that's a
05:16 - super fun way of doing things uh what I
05:18 - can also
05:20 - do
05:21 - is I'll teach you one more method here
05:25 - so let's go on
05:27 - click function on button one click panel
05:30 - one we are actually going to go find and
05:33 - now we get to look inside of panel one
05:35 - what I want to do is panel one body
05:40 - panel body this is what I want to change
05:41 - here I'll go panel actually I won't do
05:44 - find I'll just go panel one panel body
05:48 - and I'm going to change that HTML to my
05:50 - new panel
05:54 - content so now I click on that my panel
05:57 - content will change to my new panel
05:59 - content nice very good so that is pretty
06:03 - much how you listen to events and then
06:05 - tell your page to do stuff one cool
06:07 - thing you could do is I could have all
06:08 - these panels hidden by default which I
06:10 - could do you know with a CSS class um or
06:13 - in this case I'll just make it I'll do
06:15 - it the wrong way here and go display
06:18 - none so now all these panels are going
06:21 - to be hidden by
06:23 - default and then the button will
06:26 - activate them and you'll get to show
06:27 - them so button one on click panel one.
06:31 - show ah what's going
06:34 - toggle so on button one click panel one
06:36 - will toggle so they're all hidden there
06:38 - you go and now I can copy and paste
06:42 - that
06:44 - to button two if you're using Sublime
06:48 - Text by the way Apple D is what gives
06:49 - you multiple cursors like
06:52 - that there you go so now they're all
06:54 - going to toggle whenever I hit these so
06:57 - that's kind of your intro to listening
06:59 - to jQuery events the next video we're
07:01 - going to show you how to clean up your
07:02 - jQuery cuz there's no way you actually
07:05 - need to do this when they all do the
07:07 - exact same thing I'm going to show you
07:08 - how to clean that up how to reuse some
07:11 - stuff in jQuery and just how to make it
07:13 - a little bit more professional so catch
07:15 - that video next and have a good day

okay so jQuery lesson number two if you missed lesson number one I'm going to put the link in the description you're definitely going to want to see that I'm also going to get a link on the screen
