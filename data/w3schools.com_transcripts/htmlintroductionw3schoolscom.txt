00:00 - Hello! So you want
to learn how to make websites.
00:03 - In that case you need to learn HTML!
00:08 - So let's start at the very beginning.
00:10 - What exactly is HTML?
00:13 - And why do I need it?
00:15 - Let's break it down from the basics,
and build our way up.
00:19 - HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
00:23 - It uses markup to describe
the structure of web pages.
00:28 - The structure is built up by elements,
and they are represented by tags!
00:32 - Tags label pieces of content
such as "heading"
00:37 - "paragraph" "table" and so on.
00:42 - These tags aren't shown on the page,
00:44 - but are used to display content
in different ways.
00:49 - That's a lot to digest!
00:50 - So let's go into it.
00:52 - First let's try it together.
00:55 - Don't worry about understanding,
it'll all click as we work through it.
01:00 - We start by declaring
that this is an HTML document.
01:05 - The  is the root
element of any HTML page.
01:10 - The  contains meta information
about the document.
01:15 - The  element specifies
a title for the document.
01:20 - The  contains
the visible page content.
01:24 - Finally, the  defines a large heading,
while  defines a paragraph.
01:30 - With everything set in the order, let's
01:33 - go into the explanation of how tags work.
01:36 - Tags typically come in pairs.
01:39 - A start tag, and the end tag.
01:43 - The end tag is written
just like the start tag,
01:46 - but with a forward slash inserted
before the tag name.
01:50 - Here we've got the tag name
and the forward slash tag name.
01:53 - And the contents of the element
in between them.
01:57 - So if this was a paragraph, we'd use
 ---  and some text in the middle.
02:06 - Let's play a game.
02:07 - See if we can correctly match start,
and end tags, together.
02:23 - So what turns HTML code and elements
into a viewable website?
02:28 - Well, that's where web browsers come in.
02:30 - The purpose of a web browser, be
it Chrome, Firefox, Edge,
02:34 - or Safari, is to read HTML documents
and display them.
02:39 - But, the browser
does not display the HTML code.
02:42 - Instead, it uses it, to determine
how to display the document.
02:47 - Let's see what kind of building blocks
are hidden behind this webpage.
02:53 - This is a visualization
of an HTML page structure.
02:57 - You can see the HTML,
the head, with the page title
03:00 - below that, and then the body under that.
03:04 - And that's the basics.
03:06 - Let's delve into this further,
but for now, take a break.
