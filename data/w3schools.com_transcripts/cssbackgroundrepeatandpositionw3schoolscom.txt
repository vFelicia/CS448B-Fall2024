00:00 - Hey, tech enthusiasts!
00:01 - Lets take a look at how to control the repeating and positioning of CSS background images!
00:08 - First up, the CSS background-repeat property.
00:11 - By default, a background image will repeat itself both horizontally and vertically across your webpage.
00:17 - Look at our example.
00:19 - If we don’t specify anything else, our lovely gradient background will tile all over,
00:24 - which can get a bit... overwhelming.
00:27 - But what if we only want it to repeat horizontally?
00:30 - Easy peasy! We use repeat-x.
00:33 - background-repeat: repeat-x;
00:35 - And just like that,
00:36 - our gradient looks sleek across the width
00:38 - without invading the space above and below!
00:41 - Quick tip!
00:43 - To repeat an image just vertically,
00:45 - switch repeat-x to repeat-y.
00:47 - Super handy for those long scrolling pages!
00:50 - Now, let's say you want the background image to appear just once.
00:53 - No problem!
00:54 - Set background-repeat to no-repeat.
00:58 - background-repeat: no-repeat;
01:01 - Perfect for that stunning image you want to show just once!
01:05 - Finally, positioning.
01:07 - Where your image sits can make or break your design.
01:10 - Use background-position to set your stage perfectly.
01:14 - background-repeat: no-repeat;
background-position: right top;
01:20 - And voilà!
01:21 - Our tree now peeks from the top right,
01:23 - complementing rather than competing with our text.
01:28 - And there you have it!
01:29 - Repeat and position your background images like a pro!
