00:01 - Welcome back, creative coders!
00:02 - Today we're looking at CSS backgrounds
00:04 - and specifically background colors!
00:07 - Imagine you're making a digital masterpiece.
00:10 - The first thing you need is somewhere to make it.
00:12 - In CSS, that is any HTML element,
00:15 - and background colors are your paint!
00:19 - Let's start with the basics.
00:21 - First up, background-color.
00:23 - This property colors our HTML elements.
00:26 - Here, we just turned the whole page light blue.
00:29 - Pretty, isn't it?
00:31 - You can specify colors using names like “red”,
00:33 - HEX codes like “#FF0000”,
00:37 - or RGB values like “rgb(255, 0, 0)”.

00:50 - Now, let's color more elements.
01:10 - Easy, right?
01:11 - Each element gets its own splash of color.
01:15 - Sometimes you want to see through your paint,
01:17 - using opacity.
01:19 - Opacity values range from 0, fully transparent,
01:22 - to 1, fully opaque.
01:26 - Notice how this makes everything in the  semi-transparent,
01:29 - including text!
01:31 - To avoid making the text transparent,
01:33 - we specify that the color is transparent, instead of the element.
01:38 - Here, only the background is semi-transparent,
01:41 - not the text.
01:43 - We use RGBA instead of RGB, so we can adjust the Alpha Channel,
01:47 - or opacity.
01:50 - That's your quick tour of CSS backgrounds!
