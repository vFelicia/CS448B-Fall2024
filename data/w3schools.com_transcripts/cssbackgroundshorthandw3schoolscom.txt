00:00 - Hey coders!
00:01 - Today we're going to zip through the magic
00:03 - of CSS background shorthand!
00:07 - Usually, when you want to style the background of a webpage,
00:10 - you might write many lines of code for
00:12 -  for color, image, how it repeats, and its position.
00:15 - Typically something like:
00:17 - background-color: #ffffff;
00:20 - background-image: url(”img_tree.png”);
00:24 - background-repeat: no-repeat;
00:26 - background-position: right top;
00:29 - This sets your page with a white background,
00:32 - adds an image,
00:33 - and positions it right at the top without repeating.
00:37 - But guess what?
00:38 - There's a super shortcut!
00:40 - With the CSS background shorthand,
00:42 - you can slam all these settings into one powerful line!
00:46 - background: #ffffff,
00:49 - url(”img_tree.png”),
00:52 - no-repeat,
00:53 - right top;
00:55 - Now, our css code is sleek and neat,
00:57 - but still does everything it did before!
01:02 - In this shorthand, the order matters.
01:04 - First, we mention the color,
01:05 - then the image,
01:06 - how it repeats,
01:07 - attatchment,
01:08 - and lastly, its position.
01:10 - If we miss any, that's okay,
01:12 - just keep the order!
01:14 - You may even have noticed
01:15 - that we did not set a value for background-attachment
01:18 - in the example.
01:19 - But that is fine as long as the values we
01:21 - DO use are in the correct order.
01:25 - And that's it!
01:26 - Try using this shorthand in your next project.
