00:00 - Hello again!
00:02 - Today let's learn about the HTML id attribute
00:07 - This specifies a unique id for an HTML element
00:12 - The id is a way to reach a 
specific element in a page
00:16 - Kind of like shouting a name in a crowd
00:19 - Hey Bill!
00:23 - And it's very versatile too
00:25 - It can be used as an identifier 
for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
00:30 - Let's look at an example for each of these:
00:35 - In CSS to select an element with a specified id
00:41 - write a hashtag character and 
then the id of the element
00:45 - Just like that
00:48 - Now let's see how we can use it in HTML
00:51 - In HTML you can use the id as a bookmark
00:56 - Anyway HTML bookmarks are used to allow 
readers to jump to specific parts of a web page
01:02 - This is very handy if your 
web page is very very long
01:07 - Want to make your own bookmark?
01:08 - First insert the id attribute 
and then add a link to it
01:13 - When that link is clicked the page will 
scroll right to the section of the bookmark
01:18 - You can even jump to a bookmark from another page
01:22 - But remember how I said you 
could use this in JavaScript?
01:26 - Let's go over to that
01:28 - JavaScript can access an element with a 
specified id by using the getElementById method
01:36 - See?
01:37 - You can use the id attribute to 
manipulate text with JavaScript
01:42 - Want to learn more about JavaScript then 
head on over to the JavaScript tutorial
01:48 - Before we finish this lesson let's go 
over some rules for the HTML id attribute
01:54 - 1: The ID attribute can be 
used on any HTML element
01:59 - 2: The ID value is case sensitive
02:03 - 3: The ID value must contain at least one 
character and must never contain white spaces and
02:10 - 4: Each ID must be unique within the page
02:14 - Two elements cannot share the same id
02:18 - That's all I have for the id attribute
02:20 - Say goodbye Bill
02:21 - Bye-bye!
