00:01 - let's start with a simple example here
00:03 - we create a variable X outside of the
00:05 - function and use it inside the function
00:07 - my funk when we call my funk it prints
00:10 - python is awesome easy
00:13 - right notice how the variable X is
00:15 - created outside the function that's why
00:18 - it's called a global variable it can be
00:20 - used anywhere in our code
