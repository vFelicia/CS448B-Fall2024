00:00 - comments in Python start with a hashtag
00:02 - symbol like this they're super handy for
00:05 - explaining your code making it easier to
00:07 - read or even preventing certain lines
00:09 - from running while you test your code
00:12 - here's a basic
00:13 - example see that python ignores
00:16 - everything on that line after the
00:17 - hashtag so this is a comment is just for
00:20 - us humans to read you can also put
00:22 - comments at the end of a line of
00:24 - code again everything on that line after
00:27 - the hashtag is ignored by python it's
00:30 - like adding a note for yourself or
00:31 - others who read your code
