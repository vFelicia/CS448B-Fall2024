00:00 - Hey there, future coders!
00:01 - Today, we're looking into Python comments.
00:03 - Ready? Let's go!
00:06 - Comments in Python start with a hashtag symbol, like this:
00:10 - They're super handy for explaining your code,
00:12 - making it easier to read,
00:14 - or even preventing certain lines from running
00:16 - while you test your code.
00:18 - Here's a basic example:
00:20 - See that?
00:21 - Python ignores everything on that line after the hashtag.
00:24 - So, 'This is a comment' is just for us humans to read!
00:28 - You can also put comments at the end of a line of code:
00:31 - Again,
00:32 - everything on that line after the hashtag is ignored by Python.
00:35 - It's like adding a note for yourself or others who read your code.
00:40 - Now, what if you want to prevent a line of code from running?
00:44 - Easy! Just comment it out:
00:46 - Here: 'Hello, World!'
00:48 - Won't print because it's commented out.
00:50 - But 'Cheers, Mate!' will show up just fine.
00:54 - Need to write a comment that spans multiple lines?
00:57 - Python doesn't have a specific syntax for multiline comments,
01:01 - but you can just use the hashtag symbol on each line:
01:04 - And that's it!
01:06 - Now you know how to use comments in Python
01:08 - to make your code clearer and easier to work with.
