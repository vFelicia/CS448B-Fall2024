00:00 - Hey there, future Python wizards!
00:04 - Today, we're learning about global variables.
00:07 - These are special variables that live outside of functions
00:10 - and can be accessed by everyone,
00:12 - both inside and outside of those functions.
00:15 - Let's start with a simple example.
00:17 - Here, we create a variable x outside of the function
00:20 - and use it inside the function myfunc().
00:22 - When we call myfunc(),
00:24 - it prints 'Python is awesome'.
00:26 - Easy, right?
00:28 - Notice how the variable x is created outside the function.
00:31 - That's why it's called a global variable. 
00:34 - It can be used anywhere in our code.
00:38 - Now, what happens if we create a variable with the same name inside the function?
00:42 - Here, inside myfunc(), we set x to 'fantastic'.
00:46 - But outside the function, x is still 'awesome'.
00:50 - This is because the x inside the function is a local variable,
00:53 - only accessible within myfunc().
00:57 - See? The global x remains unchanged.
01:00 - Pretty neat, huh?
01:03 - Now, what if we want to create a global variable inside our function?
01:07 - We use the global keyword.
01:09 - This tells Python that we want our variable to be global,
01:12 - and not local.
01:15 - After calling myfunc(),
01:17 - x is now 'fantastic' in the global scale.
01:20 - The global keyword gives us the power to create the global variable inside a function.
01:28 - In the next example
01:29 - we first set x to 'awesome',
01:31 - as a global variable.
01:33 - Then, inside myfunc(),
01:35 - we use the global keyword to change x to 'fantastic'.
01:39 - When we print x outside the function,
01:41 - it shows 'fantastic'.
01:45 - And there you have it!
01:47 - Using the global keyword,
01:49 - we can access and modify global variables from within our functions.
01:52 - Remember, with great power comes great responsibility!
