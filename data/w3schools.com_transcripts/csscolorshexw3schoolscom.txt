00:01 - Hey there, color coders!
00:03 - Today, we're diving into the colorful world of CSS HEX colors!
00:08 - Imagine your computer screen is a giant box of crayons.
00:12 - Hex colors help us tell the computer which crayons to pick to color our websites!
00:17 - Each Hex color starts with a 'hashtag', followed by 6 letters or numbers.
00:23 - These pairs are placeholders for Red, Green and Blue.
00:25 - They tell our computer how much of each color to mix together.
00:30 - Unlike the values for RGB,
00:32 - hexadecimal, or Hex values go from 0 to F.
00:36 - This means that they can represent the same values as 0 to 255 with two digits instead of three.
00:42 - Let's decode these crayon labels, shall we?
00:45 - HEX values range from 00 to FF.
00:48 - That's like going from no color at all to the brightest shade!
00:51 - For example, #FF0000 is a bright red,
00:56 - because it's all red with no green or blue.
00:59 - Black is like turning off all colors with #000000.
01:05 - And white? It's like turning them all the way up with #FFFFFF!
01:12 - Now, let's play mad scientist and mix our own colors! 
01:16 - Take #90EE90 for instance.
01:19 - It's a nice light green because it has some red, a lot of green, and some blue.
01:24 - Now, let's play mad scientist and mix our own colors! Take hashtag 90 EE 90 for instance. It's a nice light green because it has some red, a lot of green, and some blue.
01:27 - By changing these values, we can create every color you can think of!
01:31 - From sea green (#3CB371)
01:35 - to violet (#EE82EE).
01:40 - Want to see something cool?
01:42 - Shades of gray are super easy!
01:44 - Just use equal amounts of all three colors.
01:47 - Like #787878; it's a perfect midtone gray!
01:53 - And guess what?
01:55 - When you're feeling a bit lazy, you can use a shortcut!
01:57 - #RGB is the same as repeating each digit.
02:01 - So, #F0C is really #FF00CC!
02:08 - It's like texting 'LOL' instead of 'laugh out loud.' Saves time and works just the same!!
02:16 - Alright, superstars, that's a wrap on CSS HEX colors!
