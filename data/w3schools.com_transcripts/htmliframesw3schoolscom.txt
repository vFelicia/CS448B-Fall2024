00:00 - Hello again
00:01 - Now we'll be learning about HTML iframes
00:05 - No they aren't the latest gadget from Apple
00:08 - Iframes are used to display 
a web page within a web page
00:12 - So it looks like this
00:14 - But how do you do this?
00:16 - Let's start with the iframe syntax
00:20 - An HTML iframe is defined with the 
 tag which looks just like that
00:27 - See that src? The src attribute specifies 
the URL, or source, of the inline frame page
00:37 - Next let's tackle the height and width
00:40 - Use these two attributes to 
specify the size of the frame
00:46 - The attribute values are specified in pixels by
00:48 - default but you can also put them 
in percentages if you so choose
00:54 - Alternatively you can use CSS to set 
the height and width of the frame
01:00 - By default an iframe has a border around it
01:03 - To remove the border, add the style attribute
01:06 - and use the CSS border property
01:09 - Which looks like this
01:11 - Also with CSS you can change the size 
style and color of the iframes border
01:19 - Did you know that an iframe can be 
used as the target frame for a link?
01:25 - To do so, the target attribute of the link 
must refer to the name attribute of the iframe.
01:31 - Just like this. Simple right?
01:36 - Right.
