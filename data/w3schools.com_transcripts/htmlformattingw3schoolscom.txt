00:00 - In an earlier chapter we went 
over the HTML style attribute
00:04 - But did you know HTML also has elements 
for defining text with a special meaning?
00:10 - Of course not. That's why 
you're watching this video!
00:13 - See these HTML elements?
00:16 - They correspond to formatting output 
like, bold, or italic text respectively.
00:21 - But it goes beyond bold or italics.
00:23 - There are many different ways to 
display special types of text.
00:27 - Let's start with the b and strong elements.
00:32 - b defines a bold text 
without any extra importance.
00:37 - strong defines strong text. 
This indicates important text
00:41 - and is usually displayed as bold in the browser.
00:44 - Next is the i and em elements.
00:48 - i defines italic text while 
em defines emphasized text.
00:58 - One important thing to to note is that 
browsers display strong as b and em as i
01:06 - But there's a difference in the meaning of 
these tags b and i defines bold and italic text
01:12 - but strong and em means that 
the text is important as well.
01:17 - Next comes small.
01:19 - It does exactly what you're thinking,
makes text smaller.
01:23 - Then there's the mark element.
01:26 - This element defines marked or highlighted text.
01:29 - There are are also elements that 
define deleted and inserted text.
01:33 - Use the del element which 
defines deleted or removed text.
01:41 - Then there are subscripted 
text and superscripted text.
01:45 - sub is for subscripted and, sup is for 
superscripted, doesn't get much easier than that.
01:52 - Just to recap here are the different html
01:55 - text formatting elements and 
how they can change any text.
