00:01 - To provide additional 
information about HTML elements
00:04 - you need to get familiar with attributes.
00:07 - Attributes can provide more 
details about an element.
00:12 - They're always specified in 
the start tag of an element
00:15 - and usually come in name / value pairs like this.
00:21 - One type of attribute is 
href like in this example.
00:26 - Links are defined with the 
 tag and the link address,
00:30 - or URL, is specified in the href attribute.
00:36 - Another type of attribute is src.
00:39 - We call that Source, like in this example:
00:43 - HTML images are defined with the 
 tag and the image source,
00:48 - or URL, is defined by the src attribute.
00:53 - Images in HTML have a set of size attributes these
correspond to the width and height of an image.
01:00 - For instance an image size with a width 
of 500 equates to 500 pixels wide.
01:06 - If you change the width to 300 
the image will become smaller.
01:11 - The style attribute is used to specify 
the look or style of an element.
01:16 - This is called CSS and you'll learn 
about that in another chapter.
01:21 - For now you just need to know 
that CSS allows you to change
01:25 - colors, sizes, and set the layout of your page.
01:31 - The language of the document can be declared 
in the HTML tag with the lang attribute.
01:37 - This is important for screen 
readers and search engines.
01:41 - The title attribute specifies 
a title for an element.
01:44 - The value of this title is displayed as a tool 
tip when you move the mouse over the element.
01:49 - Double quotes around attribute values are the 
most common but single quotes can also be used,
01:56 - and sometimes you actually have to use both.
01:59 - For instance if an attribute 
value contains double quotes
02:03 - it is necessary to use single 
quotes around it or vice versa.
02:07 - So remember if you want to change something about 
an element you will probably need an attribute.
