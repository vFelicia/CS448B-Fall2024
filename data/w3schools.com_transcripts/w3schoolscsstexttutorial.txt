00:00 - welcome to the w3schools CSS text
00:04 - tutorial you can use CSS to format text
00:08 - in many different ways
00:10 - let's go through the most common ways to
00:12 - format text first how to set text color
00:16 - you can set the color of the text with
00:19 - the color property in CSS a color is
00:23 - usually specified by either a hex value
00:25 - like we said for this header or an RGB
00:31 - value like we set for this paragraph or
00:35 - a color name like we set for the body
00:38 - element by setting the color for the
00:41 - body element we set the default color of
00:44 - the page so if we remove the styles for
00:48 - the other elements all elements will
00:51 - have the default color reset for body
00:54 - let's try changing it now all the
01:00 - elements are blue let's try to set the
01:05 - text alignment you can set the
01:07 - horizontal alignment of a text using the
01:10 - text align property text can be centered
01:13 - like this h1 element with the text
01:16 - aligned properly set to center or left
01:19 - or right aligned like this date let's
01:24 - try changing it from right to left or
01:30 - the text aligned property can be set to
01:32 - justify when text aligned is set to
01:35 - justify each line is stretched so that
01:39 - each line has equal width and the left
01:42 - and right margins are straight like in
01:44 - magazines or newspaper
01:45 - let's try resizing the browser window
01:48 - now the size of the space between words
01:51 - are changing as the browser is trying to
01:54 - keep the same width for all the lines
02:00 - you can set or remove decoration from
02:03 - text using the text decoration property
02:06 - this is mostly used to remove underlines
02:09 - from links for design purposes see this
02:14 - is a normal link and when we set text
02:17 - declaration none the line underneath it
02:21 - disappears but the link still works you
02:26 - can also be used to decorate text let's
02:30 - try to decorate h1 element
02:46 - see see here is a normal h1 element
02:51 - let's try adding line through now the
03:03 - text has a line through or we can add an
03:08 - over line
03:12 - now insert a line over the text or an
03:17 - underline in general it's not a good
03:26 - idea to add underlines text that is not
03:29 - links as it might confuse users the text
03:36 - transform property can be used to
03:39 - transform text you can turn everything
03:42 - into uppercase or lowercase letters or
03:44 - capitalize the first letter of each word
03:48 - these P elements all have the same text
03:52 - in third style differently the first one
03:56 - has text transform uppercase so the text
04:01 - is shown in all uppercase letters the
04:05 - second one has text transform lowercase
04:08 - so the text is shown in all lowercase
04:11 - letters the last one has text transform
04:16 - capitalized so the first letter of each
04:20 - word is capitalized let's remove the
04:24 - style from this paragraph and see what
04:26 - happens
04:32 - see the text is the same as it was
04:36 - originally now text indentation you can
04:43 - use the text indent property to specify
04:46 - the indentation of the first line of a
04:48 - text see the first line in this text has
04:53 - been given more space or been indented
04:57 - you can change the text in that property
04:59 - to change the indentation you see that's
05:10 - just the first line that's indented
05:16 - let's see how we can specify the space
05:18 - between characters we use the letter
05:22 - spacing property to set the space
05:24 - between characters this heading as the
05:30 - letter spacing 3 pixels which means
05:33 - there are three pixels more than usual
05:35 - between the characters let's try to give
05:39 - it some more space now this heading is
05:44 - the letter spacing of minus three pixels
05:47 - which means there are three pixels less
05:50 - than usual between characters if we set
05:54 - it to minus ten the characters will
05:58 - overlap
06:03 - on the w3schools tutorial page there are
06:06 - more examples and we list on the CSS
06:09 - text properties there's a link for each
06:12 - property it goes to our CSS reference
06:15 - where I can find information for any CSS
06:17 - property that this concludes our
06:20 - tutorial for CSS text thank you for
