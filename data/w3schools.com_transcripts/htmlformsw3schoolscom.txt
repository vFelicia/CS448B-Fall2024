00:00 - You've been handed plenty of 
forms throughout your life
00:03 - At the doctor's office
00:04 - at school
00:05 - for activities and programs
00:07 - If you want to sign up or join something
00:09 - you're usually going to have to fill out a form
00:12 - In today's age these forms are usually 
on websites and built with HTML
00:18 - An HTML form is used to collect user input
00:22 - The user input is then sent 
to a server for processing
00:26 - The HTML form element is used to create a form
00:30 - The form element is a container 
for different types of elements
00:35 - One of the most used elements 
inside a form is the input element
00:39 - The input element can be displayed in several 
different ways depending on its type attribute
00:45 - We have textfields, checkboxes, 
radio buttons, submit buttons , etc.
00:58 - Let's look at a real life example
01:01 -  defines a 
single line input field for text
01:06 - "My name is Bill"
01:08 -  displays a radio button
01:11 - It lets a user select one 
option from a number of choices
01:17 - "This one, the burger"
01:19 -  displays a checkbox
01:22 - It lets a user select many 
options from a number of choices
01:26 - "Check! Check! Check! Check!"
01:29 - "I'll have all of those on my juicy burger!"
01:33 - There are many more input types you can use
01:36 - Here's a quick list:
01:41 - In addition to the input element there are 
several other elements we can use in forms
01:46 - The select element defines a drop- down list
01:50 - It's a partially hidden list that drops down 
with a list of options that you can choose from
01:56 - "I'll pick this up at 5:00"
01:59 - The text area element defines 
a multi-line input field
02:03 - where the user can input text 
with more than just a few words
02:07 - Like a comment field
02:09 - "I would like my burger super well done!"
02:13 - Finally let's add a submit button
so Bill can send in his order
02:17 -  defines a submit button
02:21 - "I'm so hungry!"
02:23 - When submitting a form the user input is 
sent to a file on a server for processing
