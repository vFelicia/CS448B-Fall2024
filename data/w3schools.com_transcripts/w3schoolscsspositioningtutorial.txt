00:00 - welcome to the w3schools CSS positioning
00:03 - tutorial the CSS positioning properties
00:07 - allow you to position an element it can
00:10 - also place an element behind another
00:12 - specify what should happen when an
00:14 - elements content is too big elements are
00:18 - positioned using the top bottom left and
00:21 - right properties however these
00:23 - properties will have no effect unless
00:25 - the position property is set first they
00:28 - also work differently depending on the
00:30 - positioning methods there are four
00:32 - different positioning methods let's
00:35 - start static positioning all HTML
00:39 - elements are positioned static by
00:41 - default a static positioned element is
00:44 - always positioned according to the
00:46 - normal flow of the page look at these P
00:49 - elements they appear one after the other
00:52 - this is what we call normal flow
00:55 - elements we position static are not
00:59 - affected by the top bottom left and
01:01 - right properties now let's look at fixed
01:05 - positioning element with a fixed
01:07 - position is position relative to the
01:10 - browser window like this P element the
01:15 - position property is set to fixed and
01:17 - its position 30 pixels from the top of
01:20 - the page 5 pixels from the right of the
01:23 - page it will not move even if the window
01:27 - is scrolled elements with fixed position
01:31 - are removed from the normal flow so the
01:34 - document and the other elements behave
01:37 - like the fixed positioned element does
01:38 - not exist since they are removed from
01:42 - the normal flow elements with fixed
01:45 - position can overlap other elements
01:51 - by this I see that the text overlaps the
01:57 - other elements let's look at relative
02:03 - positioning a relative position element
02:05 - is positioned relative to its normal
02:08 - position this heading is moved right
02:13 - according to its normal position its
02:16 - position property is set to relative and
02:19 - it's left property is set to 20 pixels
02:21 - so it's positioned 20 pixels from the
02:25 - left relative to its normal position
02:29 - let's try moving it now this heading is
02:35 - smooth left according to its normal
02:37 - position smooth by setting the left
02:40 - property to minus 20 pixels so its
02:44 - position minus 20 pixels relative to its
02:50 - normal left position let's try moving
02:53 - that to relative position elements can
02:58 - be moved and overlap other elements but
03:01 - to reserve space for the element still
03:03 - preserved in the normal flow let's see
03:06 - what happens if we overlap two elements
03:08 - here
03:18 - now these two elements overlap but the
03:21 - reserved space for the element is still
03:24 - preserved now let's look at absolute
03:29 - positioning element with an absolute
03:32 - position is positioned relative to the
03:34 - first parent element that has a position
03:36 - other than static this heading has some
03:43 - absolute position but it has no parent
03:46 - elements with a position other than
03:48 - static so it's positioned relative to
03:50 - the page as position absolute and let's
03:56 - position 100 pixels from the left and
03:59 - 150 pixels from top let's try moving it
04:04 - around now it's positioned 200 pixels
04:13 - from the left and 200 pixels from the
04:16 - top of the page absolute positioned
04:20 - elements are removed from the normal
04:21 - flow so the document and other elements
04:24 - behave like the absolute position
04:25 - element does not exist since they are
04:30 - removed from the normal flow elements
04:33 - with absolute positioning can overlap
04:36 - other elements like this let's look a
04:41 - bit closer at overlapping elements when
04:45 - elements are positioned outside the
04:46 - normal flow they can overlap other
04:48 - elements the set index property
04:52 - specifies stack order of elements this
04:56 - is how you specify which element should
04:58 - be placed in front of or behind other
05:00 - elements an element with greater stack
05:03 - order is always in front of an element
05:06 - with lower stack order an element can
05:08 - have both a positive or negative stack
05:10 - order now we change the stack order for
05:13 - this image from minus 1 to 1 and now it
05:17 - appears in front of the text
05:22 - but what happens if the content of
05:25 - element is too big to fit in the
05:27 - specified place the overflow property
05:32 - specifies what to do if the content of
05:34 - an element is bigger than the elements
05:36 - box here the overflow property is set to
05:40 - scroll so the content that won't fit is
05:43 - still there but you have to scroll to
05:45 - see it air the old flow property is set
05:51 - to hidden so the content that won't fit
05:54 - is hidden from the user the default
05:58 - value is visible if the overflow is set
06:07 - to visible the content that won't fit
06:10 - overflows from its box on the w3schools
06:16 - tutorial page there are more examples
06:18 - and we list all the CSS positioning
06:21 - properties and there's a link for each
06:24 - property that goes to our CSS reference
06:26 - where we can find more information for
06:29 - any CSS property and this concludes our
06:32 - tutorial for CSS positioning thank you
06:35 - for watching
