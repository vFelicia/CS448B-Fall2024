00:00 - Now let's take a closer look at HTML paragraphs
and how they are displayed.
00:05 - Paragraphs in HTML are defined by the p element.
00:10 - Here are three paragraphs.
00:12 - This is how they are written in the code,
and this is how they are displayed on the page.
00:17 - You can see that the browser 
automatically adds some white space,
00:20 - also known as margin,
before and after each paragraph.
00:25 - HTML can be a mystery.
You can never be sure how HTML will be displayed.
00:31 - Screen sizes, as well as resized 
windows, will create different results.
00:37 - With HTML you cannot change the output by 
adding extra spaces or lines in the HTML code.
00:43 - In fact the browser will remove any extra spaces 
or line brakes when the page is displayed.
00:48 - If you want a line brake use the HTML br element.
00:53 - This brakes a line without 
starting an entirely new paragraph.
