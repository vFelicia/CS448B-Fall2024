00:00 - Hey everyone.
00:01 - Today, we're diving into a cool CSS trick
00:04 - that can add some magic to your webpage!
00:06 - We're talking about the
00:06 - CSS background-attachment property.
00:09 - Let's get started!
00:12 - The background-attachment property in CSS
00:14 - lets you decide whether your background image
00:16 - should move with the page as you scroll or just stay put.
00:17 - as you scroll or just stay put.
00:20 - It's like deciding if your wallpaper
00:21 - should follow you around or just hang tight on the wall!
00:24 - Let's start with a fixed background.
00:26 - This means the image will stay right where it is,
00:29 - no matter how much you scroll.
00:30 - Check out this code:
00:33 - We set the background-image to img_tree.png,
00:36 - tell it not to repeat with 'background-repeat: no-repeat',
00:39 - position it at the 'right top',
00:41 - and the magic part:
00:42 - 'background-attachment: fixed'.
00:44 - Now, when you scroll down the page,
00:47 - the image stays in its fixed position!
00:51 - Now, let's make that image scroll like the rest of the page.
00:54 - We just change one line of code.
00:56 - Instead of 'fixed',
00:57 - we set the background-attachment to 'scroll'.
01:00 - Now, when you scroll down the page,
01:02 - your scroll past the background image,
01:04 - just like this!
01:08 - Whether it's fixed or scrolling,
01:10 - you can choose the perfect style for your site.
01:12 - Try it out and see what works best for your design!
