00:01 - Hey there, future data wizards!
00:03 - Lets look at the SELECT statement.
00:05 - Think of it as your trusty tool for picking data out of a database,
00:09 - like choosing your favorite candies from a jar!
00:13 - So, let's get started.
00:14 - The SELECT statement is used to grab data from a database.
00:17 - Here’s a simple example to warm up.
00:20 - This code tells the database:
00:22 - 'Hey, give me the CustomerName and City columns from the Customers table.'
00:28 - But how do we write this in a general form?
00:30 - Here's the syntax:
00:33 - 'column1, column2, et cetera' are the columns you want,
00:36 - and 'table_name' is the table you’re getting them from.
00:41 - Now, let’s look at our demo database, the Customers table.
00:44 - Here's a sneak peek:
00:47 - Lets do our SELECT statement from earlier:
00:49 - 'SELECT CustomerName and City FROM Customers;
00:53 - Pretty cool, right? 
00:54 - But what if we want to see everything in the table?
00:56 - We use the * wildcard!
00:58 - Like this:
01:00 - This tells the database:
01:02 - 'Show me all the columns!' 
01:03 - And you get the whole shebang.
01:06 - And that’s the basics of the SQL SELECT statement!
01:09 - Easy peasy, right?
