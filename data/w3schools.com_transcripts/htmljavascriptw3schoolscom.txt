00:02 - Today's lesson: JavaScript
00:08 - It has the ability to make HTML pages 
far more dynamic and interactive
00:14 - Let's learn how
00:15 - We will begin with the  tag
00:18 - which is used to define a client side script
00:21 - Now the script element either 
contains scripting statements
00:25 - or it points to an external script 
file through the src attribute
00:31 - So what are the common uses for JavaScript?
00:35 - Dynamic changes of content
00:38 - Image manipulation and
00:40 - form validation
00:44 - To select an HTML element JavaScript usually 
uses the document.getElementById method
00:52 - In this example the p element has an 
id attribute with the value of "demo"
00:58 - The getElementById method finds the p element
01:02 - Then we use the innerHTML property to change the 
content of the p element to "Hello JavaScript!"
01:12 - You can also change the style of an HTML element
01:15 - like this
01:24 - Or even change HTML attributes like this
01:32 - That was a small taste of what 
you can do with JavaScript
01:35 - Let's move on to more HTML
