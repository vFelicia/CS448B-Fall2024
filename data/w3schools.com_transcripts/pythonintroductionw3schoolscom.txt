00:00 - Hey everyone! Welcome back to W3Schools!
00:03 - Today, we're diving into the wonderful world of Python!
00:08 - Imagine if you could tell your computer
00:10 - exactly what to do
00:11 - in a language almost as simple as English.
00:13 - That's Python!
00:15 - Created by Guido van Rossum
00:17 - and released in 1991,
00:19 - Python has become one of the most popular
00:21 - programming languages in the world.
00:24 - Whether it's powering web applications,
00:26 - creating software,
00:27 - solving math problems,
00:29 - or even automating the boring stuff on your computer.
00:31 - Python is the go-to language for all that and more!
00:36 - With Python, you can build web apps,
00:37 -  automate tasks, manage big data,
00:40 - and even connect to databases.
00:41 - It's truly a Swiss Army knife of programming!
00:45 - So, why Python?
00:46 - Well, it works on almost any device,
00:48 - from your Windows PC to a Raspberry Pi.
00:51 - Its simple syntax means you write less code and do more
00:54 - fast!
00:55 - Plus, it's super easy to learn and use.
00:58 - Whether you prefer procedural,
00:59 - object-oriented, or even functional programming.
01:02 - Python's got you covered.
01:04 - It adapts to your style,
01:05 - making it perfect for both quick projects
01:08 - and complex software systems.
01:10 - And whether you prefer coding in a simple text editor
01:13 - or a powerful IDE like PyCharm or Eclipse,
01:16 - Python supports all.
01:19 - Python's design focuses on readability.
01:22 - It uses lines and spaces to organize code,
01:24 - unlike the curly brackets and semicolons
01:26 - you see in many other languages.
01:29 - Let's try a quick example.
01:31 - If we type print('Hello, World!'),
01:33 - Python will greet us without any fuss.
01:35 - Let's see it in action.
01:38 - Now we add some simple calculations like 5 plus 5,
01:42 - and 10 times 2.
01:43 - No problem for Python!
01:45 - That's a wrap on our Python introduction!
