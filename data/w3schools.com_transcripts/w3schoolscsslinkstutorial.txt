00:00 - welcome to the w3schools CSS links
00:03 - tutorial links can be styled with any
00:07 - CSS property for example color font
00:10 - family background and so on
00:13 - in addition links can be styled
00:16 - differently depending on which state or
00:20 - situation the link is currently in the
00:24 - for link states are link which is a
00:28 - normal and visit the link visited which
00:33 - is a link the user has already visited
00:37 - Hoover which is a link when the user
00:40 - Mouse's over it and active which is a
00:45 - link the moment it's clicked let's
00:50 - create an additional link here to page I
00:54 - haven't visited yet so I can show the
00:57 - link States a bit more clearly let's try
01:05 - changing the colors for a different link
01:08 - States start with link set that to a
01:12 - blue color so the link I haven't visited
01:18 - yet is shown in a blue color and let's
01:23 - change the color for visit the links to
01:26 - red so the link that I already have
01:32 - visited is red let's change the color
01:36 - for Hoover to orange so when I hover
01:44 - over the links it will change to an
01:47 - orange color
01:49 - let's change active to green so I'm
01:55 - going to click the link and I'm going to
01:57 - keep the mouse button pressed so you can
02:00 - see the color see it turns to green
02:03 - color when setting the style for several
02:09 - link states there are some rules
02:12 - Hoover must come after link and list it
02:18 - an active must come after Hoover let's
02:27 - go through some of the other common ways
02:28 - to style links text decoration is mostly
02:33 - used to remove underlined from links
02:37 - this example we've removed the underline
02:40 - from the link but it will appear when we
02:43 - hover or click it let's change that
02:46 - underline to align true see now there's
02:57 - a line through the link when we hover
03:02 - now let's set the background color for
03:04 - the links here we use the background
03:09 - color property to specify the background
03:11 - color for the different link States it's
03:16 - quite common to group the style rules
03:18 - for visited link and Hoover and active
03:24 - so let's try that I'll visit it a link
03:33 - will have the same style and Hoover
03:35 - enacted will have the same style let's
03:40 - change the background color for a link
03:43 - and missed it to orange and over an
03:48 - active to yellow so now there's an
03:58 - orange background color for the link
04:01 - whether it's visited or not and it will
04:05 - get a yellow background if we hover it
04:07 - or click it
