00:00 - Hey there, techies!
00:01 - Welcome back to W3Schools.com.
00:03 - Today, we're diving into the rules of Python syntax!
00:06 - Let's get started.
00:08 - Quick recap on how to run Python on your own!
00:11 - You can execute Python code directly
00:13 - in the command line from the Python shell.
00:16 - Just type something like
00:17 - print("Hello, World!")
00:19 - and hit enter.
00:20 - Your message is displayed right away.
00:23 - You can also create a Python file with the .py extension
00:27 - and run it from the command line.
00:29 - You can name the file whatever you want,
00:31 - but it must end withÂ  .py
00:33 - Run the file with the python command and the file location.
00:36 - For our examples, we use our own Python code editor
00:39 - that you can run right from your browser.
00:41 - No installation required.
00:44 - That covers how to run python.
00:46 - Now, let's look at the rules for writing python.
00:49 - Starting with indentation
00:51 - In Python, indentation is crucial.
00:54 - In this example we have an if statement
00:56 - with a second line
00:57 - print("Five is greater than two!")
01:00 - The second line is indentated with 4 spaces.
01:03 - This indentation tells Python that
01:05 - the second line is part of the if statement block.
01:08 - If you skip the indentation,
01:10 - Python will throw a syntax error,
01:12 - or read them as 2 different statements.
01:14 - So, always remember to indent your code properly!
01:17 - You can use different numbers of spaces, but the standard is four.
01:21 - Just make sure you're consistent within the same block,
01:24 - because Python will throw an error
01:25 - if you use different numbers of spaces within the same block!
01:30 - Next up, variables!
01:32 - In Python, you create variables by assigning values to them.
01:35 - Like this:
01:37 - Here, x is an integer variable with a value of 5,
01:40 - and y is a string variable with the value "Hello, World!".
01:44 - No need for a type declaration!
01:45 - Simple and easy!
01:48 - And don't forget about comments.
01:50 - They start with a hashtag and are great for documentation.
01:53 - When Python sees a hashtag on a line,
01:56 - it will read the rest of that line as a comment.
01:58 - So you can write notes to yourself or others in your code.
02:01 - Handy, right?
