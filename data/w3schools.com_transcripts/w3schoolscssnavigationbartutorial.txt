00:00 - welcome to the Doubletree school's CSS
00:03 - navigation bar tutorial having
00:06 - easy-to-use navigation is important for
00:09 - any website so in this tutorial I will
00:11 - show you how to style a list of links
00:14 - into a navigation bar like this a
00:19 - navigation bar needs standard HTML as a
00:22 - base and since the navigation bar is
00:25 - basically a list of links using the UL
00:29 - and Li elements makes perfect sense so
00:33 - here we have a list of links the regular
00:39 - style so it looks like navigation bar
00:44 - let's start by removing the list markers
00:49 - since the navigation bar will not need
00:52 - them so we set the list style type to
01:08 - none and then we set the margins and
01:18 - padding to zero to remove any browser
01:25 - default and now we have a list of links
01:29 - that we can use as our base for our
01:32 - navigation bar let's start by building a
01:37 - vertical navigation bar so we need to
01:42 - style the links or a elements
01:55 - so let's start by setting this play lock
02:01 - of displaying the links as block
02:04 - elements we'll make the whole area
02:06 - clickable and not just the text it also
02:09 - allows us to specify the width and since
02:18 - block elements take up the full width
02:20 - available by default I want to specify a
02:22 - width a suit sauce now we set the width
02:27 - to 120 pixels and you can see that not
02:30 - just the text is clickable but the whole
02:33 - were 120 pixel area let's add some
02:38 - background color and change the color of
02:52 - the text
03:01 - now let's remove the underline from the
03:05 - links and center align the text
03:26 - now we want to text to be bolder and we
03:40 - wanted to show in all uppercase case
03:42 - letters now let's give the text some
03:58 - space by adding padding now we want to
04:10 - add some interactivity on the background
04:13 - color to change when the user Mouse's
04:15 - over a link so the style rule we created
04:19 - we want to change it to apply to link
04:25 - and visit it that means unvisited and
04:33 - listed links I want to create a new rule
04:36 - for Hoover and active
04:50 - where the background color changes to
04:53 - green or specifically a darker green now
05:07 - we have a fully style vertical menu
05:10 - let's leave this example for now and see
05:13 - how we can create a horizontal
05:14 - navigation bar there are two ways to
05:19 - create a horizontal navigation bar using
05:22 - inline or floating list items let's see
05:27 - how we can use inline list items here we
05:32 - have a horizontal linked list it's been
05:36 - created by setting display inline for
05:41 - the list item elements by default list
05:46 - item elements are block elements by
05:49 - setting it to inline we remove the line
05:52 - breaks before and after each list item
05:56 - and display them on one line however we
06:00 - can't use this method if you want the
06:02 - links to have equal width since an
06:04 - inline element cannot have width so
06:09 - let's go back to our previous example
06:10 - where we created a vertical navigation
06:12 - bar and see if we can change it to
06:15 - horizontal here we have links we would
06:22 - equal width since the a elements have
06:27 - been set to display block and as a
06:30 - specify width now if we float these list
06:36 - item elements they will slide next to
06:38 - each other let's see
06:53 - we started to float left and the items
06:58 - will prepare next to each other on the
07:02 - horizontal line so now we have a fully
07:05 - style horizontal navigation bar this
07:10 - concludes our tutorial for CSS
