00:00 - Greetings once again!
00:02 - I would like this lesson to center on style.
00:05 - Specifically CSS
00:07 - Now CSS stands for cascading style sheets
00:12 - and it describes how HTML elements 
are displayed on a web page
00:18 - This has the ability to save 
many hours because it controls
00:21 - the layout of multiple web pages all at once
00:25 - There are three ways to add CSS to HTML elements
00:30 - First there's inline which is done by 
using the style attribute in HTML elements
00:36 - The second is internal which is completed 
by using a style element in the head section
00:43 - Lastly there's external which 
means using an external CSS file
00:49 - Let's take a look at the three options in action
00:53 - An inline CSS is used to apply a 
unique style to a single HTML element
01:00 - This is done by using the style 
attribute of an HTML element
01:04 - Just like this:
01:05 - Here we set the text to "blue"
01:10 - Next is internal CSS,
01:12 - which is used to define a 
style for a single HTML page
01:17 - An internal CSS is defined in 
the head section of an HTML page
01:22 - within the style element
01:24 - Just like that
01:28 - And the last option is external CSS
01:31 - which is used to define the 
style for many HTML pages
01:36 - With external style sheets you can change the look 
of an entire website by changing only one file
01:43 - To use this option add a link to it 
in the head section of the HTML page
01:50 - An external stylesheet can 
be written in any text editor
01:54 - but the file must not contain any HTML code
01:57 - It also must be saved with a .css extension
02:02 - It should end up looking like this
02:05 - That was a short introduction to CSS but don't 
worry we'll cover more of the specifics later on
