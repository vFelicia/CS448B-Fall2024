00:00 - Hey everyone.
00:01 - Today, we're diving into the basics of SQL,
00:04 - or as it is more commonly pronounced,
00:06 - Sequel.
00:08 - It is the language that powers databases all around the world.
00:12 - First up, what exactly is SQL?
00:15 - SQL stands for Structured Query Language.
00:18 - It's the standard language for accessing and manipulating databases.
00:22 - SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute
00:26 - ANSI in 1986
00:28 - and of the International Organization for Standardization
00:32 - ISO in 1987.
00:35 - So, what can SQL actually do? Let's break it down!
00:39 - SQL can:
00:40 - Execute queries against, and retrieve data from a database.
00:44 - Insert, update and delete records from a database.
00:47 - Create new databases, tables and views.
00:50 - Set permissions, and much much more.
00:55 - Even though SQL is an ANSI/ISO standard,
00:57 - there are different versions of the SQL language.
01:01 - To be compliant with the ANSI standard,
01:03 - they all support the major commands like
01:04 - SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT, and WHERE.
01:08 - Most SQL database variations also have their own proprietary extensions
01:12 - in addition to the SQL standard!
01:16 - Want to build a website that shows data from a database?
01:18 - Here's what you'll need:
01:20 - A SQL database program like
01:22 - MS Access, SQL Server, or MySQL,
01:26 - a server-side scripting language like PHP or ASP
01:30 - Some SQL knowhow to get the data you want
01:33 - and some HTML & CSS to style the page
01:36 - By the way,
01:37 - W3Schools.com Spaces has everything you need for this. You should check it out.
01:44 - Now, let's talk about RDBMS,
01:46 - which stands for Relational Database Management System.
01:49 - RDBMS is the foundation for SQL and modern database systems like
01:53 - MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access.
02:01 - In an RDBMS, data is stored in tables.
02:03 - A table is a collection of related data entries, consisting of columns and rows.
02:10 - Let's look at an example: The 'Customers' table.
02:14 - We can retrieve data using SQL. For instance:
02:18 - SELECT * FROM Customers;
02:22 - This command retrieves all records from the 'Customers' table.
02:28 - Every table has: fields, records, and columns.
02:32 - Fields are columns designed to maintain specific information about every record.
02:37 - A record, or row, is each individual entry in the table.
02:41 - Columns are vertical entities in a table
02:44 - containing all information associated with a specific field.
02:49 - And that's a quick introduction to SQL!
