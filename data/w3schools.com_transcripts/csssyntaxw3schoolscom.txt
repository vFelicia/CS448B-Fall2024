00:00 - Welcome to the world of CSS, where
every detail matters!
00:03 - Today, we're unraveling the secrets of CSS
syntax.
00:06 - Let's get styling with W3Schools.com!
00:09 - In CSS, we communicate through selectors,
properties, and values.
00:13 - It's like giving specific instructions
to your webpage on how to dress up!
00:18 - Selectors are like
name tags for HTML elements.
00:21 - They identify which elements to style.
00:23 - From simple tags to classes and IDs,
selectors are the first step in styling.
00:29 - Properties are the style attributes
like color and margin.
00:33 - Values are the specific settings
for these properties.
00:36 - For example, color would use different
color values,
00:39 - and margin could use a numeric pixel value
or percent.
00:42 - Together,
they create the look of your webpage.
00:49 - Let's put it all together.
00:51 - Watch how we transform a plain HTML page
00:53 - into a visually appealing design
using CSS syntax.
00:57 - First,
we select the body element. Our goal?
01:00 - To change its background color.
01:02 - With a simple line of CSS body {
background color: lightblue }.
01:07 - The background transforms!
01:10 - Next, let's style our header.
01:11 - We want it centered on the page.
01:13 - Hereâ€™s how we do it.
01:14 - Using h1 { text align: center }
01:18 - Now our header is centered.
01:21 - With each line of CSS,
our page becomes more vibrant
01:23 - and engaging.
01:28 - And that's the magic of CSS Syntax!
