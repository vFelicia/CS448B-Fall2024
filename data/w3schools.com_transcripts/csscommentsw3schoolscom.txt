00:00 - Hey there, young coders!
00:01 - Today, we're diving into a secret world in CSS that's invisible yet incredibly helpful.
00:06 - Welcome to the magical land of CSS Comments!
00:11 - Imagine you're a detective, and these comments are your secret notes.
00:14 - They're hidden messages in your CSS code that only you and other coders can see,
00:19 - not the people visiting your website.
00:21 - CSS comments are like whispers in your code.
00:24 - They don't change anything on your website but are super handy for leaving notes and secrets for yourself and your team.
00:31 - Writing a comment is like casting a spell.
00:33 - Just wrap your note between /* and */,
and you've made a comment.
00:39 - You can sprinkle these magical notes anywhere in your code.
00:42 - Above a style rule, inside it, or even in the middle of a line!
00:46 - And if your secret message is too long for one line, no worries! 
00:50 - Stretch it across as many lines as you need.
00:54 - Remember, detectives, we also have HTML comments.
00:57 - These start with .
01:04 - They're perfect for hiding clues in the HTML part of your code
01:08 - No matter what kind of comment you add,
it will never be visible in the result
01:13 - Now you're ready to leave hidden messages all over your code,
01:16 - making it easier to understand and update.
