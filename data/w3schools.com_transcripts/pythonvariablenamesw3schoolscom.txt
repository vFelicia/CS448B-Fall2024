00:01 - Hey there, future coders!
00:02 - Today, we're looking at Python variable names.
00:07 - What's in a name?
00:09 - Well, when it comes to coding, quite a lot!
00:12 - In Python, you can name your variables almost anything you like.
00:15 - Short names like 'x' or 'y' work,
00:18 - but it can be helpful to use more descriptive names like
00:21 - 'age', 'carname', or 'total_volume'.
00:24 - But there are some rules we need to follow.
00:27 - Rule number one:
00:29 - A variable name must start with a letter or an underscore.
00:33 - Rule number two:
00:34 - A variable name cannot start with a number.
00:37 - So 'age2' is fine, but '2age' is a no-go.
00:42 - Rule number three:
00:44 - Variable names can only contain
00:46 - alphanumeric characters and underscores.
00:49 - That means letters: A to Z,
00:51 - Numbers: 0 to 9, and underscores are allowed.
00:56 - So, 'my' underscore 'var' is good,
00:58 - but 'my var' with space or hyphen won't work.
01:02 - And finally,
01:03 - rule number four:
01:05 - Variable names are case-sensitive.
01:07 - That means these three variable with the name "age"
01:10 - are three different variables because of the upper and lower cases.
01:14 - So be careful with your caps lock!
01:18 - Oh, and one more thing:
01:19 - Your variable name can't be a Python keyword.
01:23 - Keywords are special reserved words in Python like
01:26 - 'if', 'else', 'while', 'for', and many more.
01:30 - Let's look at some examples of legal variable names:
01:34 - All these variable names are legal in Python.
01:38 - And now, some illegal ones:
01:40 - These are illegal since the first one starts with a number,
01:43 - the next one has a hyphen,
01:45 - and the last one contains a space.
01:48 - Now, let's talk about multi-word variable names.
01:51 - They can be hard to read,
01:53 - so here are three techniques to make them clearer.
01:56 - First, we have Camel Case.
01:58 - Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter.
02:01 - Next, there's Pascal case.
02:04 - Here, each word, including the first,
02:05 - starts with a capital letter.
02:10 - Finally, we have Snake Case.
02:11 - Each word is separated by an underscore.
02:15 - And that's it!
02:16 - Now you know how to name your variables in Python.
