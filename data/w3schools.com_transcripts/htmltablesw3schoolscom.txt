00:00 - In this lesson you will 
learn how to create a table
00:04 - No I don't mean the kind that needs chairs
00:08 - I mean the kind that arranges their 
data into rows and columns like this:
00:16 - So let's talk about the tools 
you need to build your tables
00:19 - You will use the HTML table 
element to define a table
00:25 - If you want to define table rows, use tr elements
00:28 - You'll need one tr element for each row
00:32 - Each row consists of one or more td elements,
also known as table data
00:38 - These act as columns inside the table 
and define data for each table cell
00:44 - You can also add headings for each 
column by using the th element
00:50 - phew did you get all that?
00:52 - Let's do a quick recap
00:54 - Define a table with the table element
00:58 - Define rows with the tr elements
01:01 - Add headings with the th elements
01:06 - And add table data with td elements
01:09 - Those are the basic tools 
you need to build HTML tables
01:14 - By the way you should note the table 
headings are bold and centered by default
01:21 - and borders won't just appear automatically so if
01:24 - you want to border on your 
table you must specify it
01:27 - Here's how:
01:28 - The CSS border property defines a border
01:33 - As you can see in the result this will 
display a table with double borders
01:38 - If you don't want that use the border-collapse 
property to display a single table border
01:45 - If you want to add a little extra padding 
to the cells use the CSS padding property
01:52 - If you want to change the alignment of text 
within the cell use the CSS text-align property
01:59 - Now let's say you want a cell 
to span over many columns
02:02 - For that you have to use the colspan attribute
02:07 - It should be added directly 
to the table cell like this
02:12 - Just like you would have to use the rowspan 
attribute to make a cell span over many rows
02:20 - Well there you have it
02:22 - Now you know how to add tables to your website
02:25 - Happy building
