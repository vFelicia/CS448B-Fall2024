00:06 - hello programmers welcome back to
00:08 - programming kids
00:10 - my name is sari and today we're gonna
00:11 - learn about string
00:13 - indexing and sizing so what are you
00:15 - waiting for
00:16 - let's get started so the first thing you
00:19 - have to do while is indexing and sizing
00:22 - indexing is when you grab a single
00:24 - character and sizing
00:25 - when you grab a subsection from that
00:27 - string so what are you waiting for
00:30 - just pop into our picture notebook and
00:32 - see some examples about
00:34 - strength indexing and slicing
00:37 - so i will search for the jupiter
00:39 - notebook enter
00:43 - that's the command line
00:50 - now to start coding we will press new
00:52 - button 3.
00:59 - here you can see the input function so
01:01 - let us
01:02 - start first by creating a string let us
01:05 - name it as
01:06 - my string is equal
01:10 - to let's say programming
01:16 - fibs run
01:22 - string now from the sentence programming
01:26 - kids
01:26 - if i want to grab a single character you
01:29 - will use indexing
01:30 - because indexing is when you grab a
01:32 - single character
01:34 - so let us say if i want to grab a we'll
01:36 - use indexing
01:38 - and what can you start counting with
01:40 - zero
01:41 - one two three etc so we have to count
01:45 - b to a starting with zero
01:48 - so zero one two three four five
01:52 - do you say my string
01:56 - brackets five you'll get a
01:59 - now if you want to grab another letter
02:03 - k so 0
02:06 - 1 two three four five
02:09 - six seven eight nine ten eleven or so
02:13 - let's please count
02:14 - twelve so we will say my string
02:19 - brackets you will get
02:23 - k now there is two ways to get that same
02:27 - letter so let us just grab another
02:29 - letter let's say
02:31 - r so 0 1
02:34 - 2 3 okay my string
02:38 - brackets four we will get r
02:42 - to get that same letter we'll start
02:45 - counting with
02:46 - zero starting counting by negative
02:49 - number
02:49 - so you're saying negative one negative
02:51 - two and negative three negative four
02:53 - also the space count
02:54 - negative five negative six negative
02:56 - seven negative eight negative nine
02:58 - negative ten negative eleven and
03:00 - negative twelve
03:02 - the rest of negative 12 i will get the
03:05 - same letter
03:06 - r so that's it for indexing
03:10 - now let us see some examples about
03:13 - slicing
03:14 - so first let me create a string i'll
03:17 - name it as
03:18 - my string my string
03:28 - and i'll just add some random
03:32 - letters so these
03:35 - these are just some random letters
03:41 - okay so now if i run that
03:44 - that's it my string
03:49 - i will get these random letters
03:53 - so from these random letters if i want
03:56 - to grab
03:59 - sentences if i want to grab h
04:02 - q a we will use slicing
04:07 - so we will count from h to g so now here
04:10 - people will be confused
04:12 - we said that we want h q a why are we
04:15 - counting till g
04:16 - because invite means go up but don't
04:19 - include that number
04:20 - if you are going up by button won't
04:23 - include that number
04:24 - so we will save my strength
04:28 - brackets colon we will count from h
04:32 - to g so zero one two
04:35 - three so you will say three
04:38 - and you will get hq a the
04:43 - hqa now let us see if i want to grab
04:48 - l ok so we will say
04:51 - my string
04:55 - brackets calling l okay
04:59 - so zero one two three four five
05:02 - six from h to l
05:06 - six i'll write you six
05:10 - and then six seven
05:13 - eight nine means go up but don't take it
05:15 - with that number
05:18 - nine now if i run that i'll get l
05:22 - okay l okay
05:26 - now let us say if i want to grab c
05:29 - till h will say my string
05:34 - brackets so
05:38 - situate so you will say
05:41 - will count zero one two three four
05:45 - five six seven eight nine
05:49 - so you say here nine
05:58 - oops you say nine
06:04 - add the brackets yes now you will get
06:10 - c throw h so this is it
06:13 - for sizing so now let's just talk about
06:16 - the step size
06:18 - so let us say my string will get these
06:21 - random
06:22 - letters now what if i want to go as tip
06:25 - size by
06:26 - two what if i want to go from h to a
06:30 - to e to say my string
06:35 - and say calling colon if i want to do a
06:38 - slip size by two
06:39 - let's say coin colon two and it will go
06:43 - from h
06:44 - a e l c n
06:48 - we got a step size by two and you can
06:51 - say a step size
06:52 - by any number you like
06:56 - we can say
07:00 - three you will get a step size by three
07:06 - and also if you want the random lectures
07:08 - we'll say
07:13 - colin colon
07:16 - get all these random letters now what if
07:19 - i want to reverse what if i went to
07:22 - numbers from heat from h
07:26 - to h so i want the number starting from
07:29 - h e
07:30 - and x all the way to back to the c my
07:33 - string
07:36 - brackets call calling calling
07:39 - negative one randa
07:43 - i'll get this number back
07:46 - so that's it for today's video i hope
07:49 - you learned something new
07:50 - if you did please subscribe to join our
07:53 - family
07:54 - like and hit that notification bell on
07:56 - to get notified every time we upload a
07:58 - new video
08:00 - keep programming and i'll see you guys
08:01 - all next time on programming kids
08:03 - bye for now
