00:00 - [Applause]
00:04 - hello everyone
00:05 - welcome to programming kids my name is
00:08 - lynn
00:08 - and in today's video we will be applying
00:11 - the math rules that we learned in our
00:13 - past video so in our last video
00:16 - we learned all the rules that you
00:19 - shouldn't apply and that you should
00:21 - apply
00:21 - on python so that you can easily make
00:24 - python do your math homework
00:27 - well python can be as fast as a
00:29 - calculator
00:31 - and they can give you the answer no
00:33 - matter how
00:34 - complex the question might be so
00:37 - let's open up idle
00:42 - all right so usually in our videos we
00:44 - open a new file but because you probably
00:47 - want
00:48 - the answer to come fast and you don't
00:49 - want to waste your time
00:51 - by opening a new file and running it you
00:53 - can just do it on the python shell over
00:55 - here
00:57 - okay so we are going to be going through
00:59 - plus
01:00 - minus multiplication division
01:03 - and the order of operation so let's
01:06 - start with the plus
01:07 - or addition so let's type as question
01:13 - and it can be really long it doesn't
01:16 - matter
01:16 - no matter how long it is python will
01:19 - still give you the answer
01:20 - so let me type one over here
01:24 - and then i i usually like to
01:28 - skip space between it just so that it
01:30 - looks neat
01:31 - you can do that too if you want all
01:34 - right
01:34 - so here we go i typed a long number
01:37 - and another long number here that i want
01:39 - python to add
01:41 - so usually in english we type equal
01:45 - or a question mark but unfortunately if
01:49 - you do that on python
01:51 - it will give you an error and
01:55 - let's try it just so that you guys can
01:58 - understand what do i mean by error
02:02 - whoops they gave me syntax error invalid
02:04 - syntax
02:06 - so even though in our english language
02:10 - we usually put an equal sign to make the
02:13 - question
02:15 - full and just understandable
02:19 - python their language is different and
02:21 - they don't understand what's an equal
02:23 - sign
02:23 - because we usually store variables using
02:26 - them
02:27 - nor a question mark let me just type
02:30 - another one
02:31 - and use a question mark and let's see if
02:33 - it will work
02:42 - and here whoops another syntax error
02:46 - and you can notice that python
02:49 - highlighted the question mark
02:52 - they don't understand what does that
02:53 - mean okay
02:55 - now let's try typing a question without
02:58 - including that
03:00 - equal sign or the question mark
03:12 - and let's press let's press enter
03:16 - okay i got my answer so you should
03:20 - always
03:20 - obey python just so that they can obey
03:22 - you with whatever you need
03:25 - let's move on to um
03:28 - subtraction or minusing so it's
03:32 - exactly the same nothing is different
03:35 - so let me type in a question
03:42 - and press minus
03:46 - okay so here's my question
03:50 - i am going to be pressing enter and
03:53 - got it okay so now
03:57 - what do you think happen if i
04:00 - make the small number minus the big
04:03 - number
04:04 - do you think i'll get a positive sign or
04:07 - a negative sign
04:09 - let's try it out
04:23 - all right here i have a question and
04:29 - we are going to be pressing enter right
04:32 - now i have 98 minus 5
04:34 - 6170 that's not possible right so they
04:38 - have to give us a negative sign
04:40 - let's see if python is smart python
04:44 - is indeed smart they give us minus five
04:46 - five
04:47 - eight zero so if we type this normally
04:52 - like five six seven eight
04:56 - minus 98 they give us
05:00 - a positive 5 5 8 year well
05:03 - now that we have gone through negative
05:06 - and positive
05:07 - or um plus and minus or addition and
05:09 - subtraction
05:10 - it's time for us to move to
05:12 - multiplication and division
05:14 - so let's start with multiplication for
05:16 - multiplication we use an asterisk
05:19 - as the multiplication sign which is
05:22 - this you have to
05:25 - hold on shift and eight and you'll get
05:28 - it
05:29 - okay so let me type in in question
05:33 - and use my a fix
05:38 - multiply by and press
05:41 - enter and here it is you get your answer
05:44 - let's try it again
05:49 - and press enter and here it is
05:53 - moving on to the division we have to use
05:56 - a backslash
05:57 - as our division sign
06:00 - so let's type in another question for
06:03 - python to solve
06:08 - and press enter and here it is so you
06:11 - can see that it's 5 51 point something
06:14 - that's because all of these numbers are
06:17 - remainders
06:18 - and if you try to do it on a calculator
06:20 - they probably give you the same thing
06:22 - now let's do something that might be
06:24 - divisible by another thing
06:25 - so how about 6 divided by 3
06:31 - the answer is supposed to be 2. let's
06:33 - see if python will give us the answer
06:36 - python gave us 2.0 so
06:40 - they they just want to clear out that
06:43 - there are no remainders and this is why
06:45 - they add zero
06:47 - okay now let's move on to the order of
06:50 - operation
06:51 - so let me type in a question and
06:55 - let's see how can we solve it there
06:57 - might be a way
06:58 - to solving it in two ways so let me just
07:02 - type it in first
07:13 - okay here's my question five minus three
07:17 - plus seven so if you do it normally
07:19 - starting from the side and do
07:21 - five minus three you get two and plus
07:24 - seven
07:25 - is nine but if you want to start
07:29 - this by using um solving these two first
07:34 - it would be different so let's try
07:37 - by using three plus seven which is ten
07:41 - and then using 5
07:44 - minus 10. that gives that a negative
07:46 - number
07:48 - so i am going to go ahead and just press
07:51 - enter right now and the answer is 9.
07:53 - what python did is the 5-3
07:56 - first which is two and add is seven
07:59 - which is nine
08:00 - now what do you think will happen if i
08:04 - did this
08:11 - it might look the same and the only
08:13 - difference that i added a bracket
08:15 - but the answer would be completely
08:17 - different
08:18 - it's minus five because i told
08:22 - i added brackets python automatically
08:25 - notes
08:25 - notices that they should start by adding
08:29 - this
08:29 - and then using the extra information
08:33 - okay so whatever you see in brackets is
08:36 - the thing that happens
08:37 - first in python all right
08:41 - let's move on to using multiplication
08:44 - and addition or subtraction or division
08:48 - in a question let me type this
08:55 - okay so here's my question psi seven
08:58 - times nine
08:58 - plus five okay so seven
09:02 - times nine is 63 plus five
09:05 - is let's see what it is it's 68
09:09 - okay so this is my answer
09:12 - now what do you think happens if i do
09:15 - five
09:17 - plus seven times eight
09:22 - or times nine sorry do you think the
09:24 - answer might change
09:26 - let's change it doesn't change because
09:29 - in the order of operation multiplication
09:33 - and division happens before
09:37 - subtraction and addition well i hope you
09:40 - get the hang of it
09:42 - you're going to have to understand it
09:43 - before actually
09:45 - putting it on python now let's move on
09:48 - to exponent
09:49 - and exponent it actually means to the
09:51 - power off
09:52 - so for exponent we use double
09:56 - asterisks which is
09:59 - the multiplication sign okay
10:02 - so this is when you use double asterisks
10:06 - or double multiplication sign it
10:08 - actually means exponent
10:11 - which is the power of
10:17 - oh sorry
10:20 - so if i type 4 and add 2 asterisks
10:28 - 4 to the power of 2 the answer is
10:30 - supposed to be 16.
10:32 - yup python is smart what i mean by 4 to
10:36 - the power of 2 is 4
10:38 - times 4 which is 16. let me try a
10:41 - different
10:42 - big number so i'm probably not going to
10:46 - be able to do this in my brain
10:48 - but luckily python can help and i'm
10:51 - going to be doing it to the power of
10:54 - this now
11:00 - oh i don't know what happened
11:03 - they're giving me nothing
11:08 - it's probably because there's no more
11:10 - space to do it over here
11:13 - i'm not sure okay um
11:16 - plus the greater than signs are gone
11:19 - when i press enter they're not coming so
11:22 - let's open python
11:24 - again or let's just type three plus five
11:27 - here and let's see if this will work
11:29 - when there is no greater than signs
11:32 - nothing happens looks like there's an
11:36 - error in python well let me close this
11:38 - and open python again
11:43 - when you want to type a question do it
11:46 - greater than sign you'd always be aware
11:48 - okay now let's continue typing our
11:50 - question we were typing a massive number
11:53 - to
11:54 - the power off so double a streets
11:59 - and here whoa oh my gosh
12:03 - that is a massive number and i get
12:07 - why it wasn't breaking in the first
12:08 - place
12:10 - well let's try another number
12:17 - so i have 456 to the power off
12:22 - whoa this is going to be a lot
12:27 - looks like there's no more space again
12:29 - for this
12:31 - one question takes so much place
12:35 - let's open python again and let's type
12:38 - in a different question
12:48 - all right press enter
12:52 - oh my gosh it's squeezing text 456
12:56 - lines that means that the questions
13:00 - is too big to be filled on the python
13:02 - child
13:05 - way too big
13:08 - oh my gosh well guys i hope you enjoyed
13:12 - this video
13:14 - because it's really fun to get your
13:17 - answer
13:18 - by just typing it don't you think
13:22 - here i got this because it's pretty
13:24 - small but
13:25 - i hope you guys enjoyed this video and
13:28 - have
13:29 - fun getting your math homework done well
13:32 - keep programming and i'll see you guys
13:34 - next time on programming kids
13:36 - bye for now

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone welcome to programming kids my name is lynn and in today's video we will be applying the math rules that we learned in our past video so in our last video we learned all the rules that you shouldn't apply and that you should apply on python so that you can easily make python do your math homework well python can be as fast as a calculator and they can give you the answer no matter how complex the question might be so let's open up idle all right so usually in our videos we open a new file but because you probably want the answer to come fast and you don't want to waste your

and then i i usually like to skip space between it just so that it looks neat you can do that too if you want all right so here we go i typed a long number and another long number here that i want python to add so usually in english we type equal or a question mark but unfortunately if you do that on python it will give you an error and let's try it just so that you guys can understand what do

without including that equal sign or the question mark and let's press let's press enter okay i got my answer so you should always obey python just so that they can obey you with whatever you need let's move on to um subtraction or minusing so it's exactly the same nothing is different so let me type in a question and press minus okay so here's my question i am going to be pressing enter and got it okay so now what do you think happen if i make the small number minus the big number do you think i'll get a positive sign or a negative sign let's try it out all right here i have a question and we are going to be pressing enter right now i have 98 minus 5 6170 that's not possible right so they have to give us a negative sign let's see if python is smart python is indeed smart they give us minus five five eight zero so if we type this normally like five six seven eight minus 98 they give us a positive 5 5 8 year well now that we have gone through negative and positive or um plus and minus or addition and subtraction it's time for us to move to multiplication and division so let's start with multiplication for multiplication we use an asterisk as the multiplication sign which is this you have to hold on shift and eight and you'll get it okay so let me type in in question and use my a fix multiply by and press enter and here it is you get your answer let's try it again and press enter and here it is moving on to the division we have to use a backslash as our division sign so let's type in another question for python to solve and press enter and here it is so you can see that it's 5 51 point something that's because all of these numbers are remainders and if you try to do it on a calculator they probably give you the same thing now let's do something that might be

that they should start by adding this and then using the extra information okay so whatever you see in brackets is the thing that happens first in python all right let's move on to using multiplication and addition or subtraction or division in a question let me type this okay so here's my question psi seven times nine plus five okay so seven times nine is 63 plus five is let's see what it is it's 68 okay so this is my answer now what do you think happens if i do five plus seven times eight or times nine sorry do you think the answer might change let's change it doesn't change because in the order of operation multiplication and division happens before subtraction and addition well i hope you get the hang of it you're going to have to understand it before actually putting it on python now let's move on to exponent and exponent it actually means to the power off so for exponent we use double asterisks which is the multiplication sign okay so this is when you use double asterisks or double multiplication sign it actually means exponent which is the power of oh sorry so if i type 4 and add 2 asterisks 4 to the power of 2 the answer is supposed to be 16. yup python is smart what i mean by 4 to the power of 2 is 4 times 4 which is 16. let me try a different big number so i'm probably not going to be able to do this in my brain but luckily python can help and i'm going to be doing it to the power of this now oh i don't know what happened they're giving me nothing it's probably because there's no more space to do it over here i'm not sure okay um plus the greater than signs are gone when i press enter they're not coming so let's open python again or let's just type three plus five here and let's see if this will work when there is no greater than signs nothing happens looks like there's an error in python well let me close this and open python again when you want to type a question do it greater than sign you'd always be aware okay now let's continue typing our question we were typing a massive number to the power off so double a streets and here whoa oh my gosh that is a massive number and i get why it wasn't breaking in the first place well let's try another number so i have 456 to the power off whoa this is going to be a lot looks like there's no more space again for this one question takes so much place let's open python again and let's type in a different question all right press enter oh my gosh it's squeezing text 456 lines that means that the questions is too big to be filled on the python child way too big oh my gosh well guys i hope you enjoyed this video because it's really fun to get your answer by just typing it don't you think here i got this because it's pretty small but i hope you guys enjoyed this video and have fun getting your math homework done well keep programming and i'll see you guys next time on programming kids bye for now
