00:04 - hello everyone and welcome to
00:06 - programming kids my name is Lin and in
00:09 - today's video I'll be teaching you
00:10 - everything you have to know about
00:12 - variables in Python make sure to grab a
00:14 - notebook to take notes or a cup of tea
00:16 - and let's get started okay so first of
00:23 - all let's just clear out what does very
00:26 - well mean variable is a memory location
00:29 - that is used to store data values and
00:32 - the unique thing about Python is that it
00:36 - doesn't have a command for declaring
00:38 - variable it just creates a variable the
00:41 - second you enter a value in we'll talk
00:44 - more about this later on the video so
00:49 - now let's talk about types of variables
00:53 - variables might also be known as data
00:56 - types so okay here we go
00:59 - first of all data types are used to
01:01 - present a value that's although what a
01:04 - poetry can be performed in some kind of
01:07 - dare and types are numbers drinks lists
01:12 - tuples and dictionary so let's start
01:17 - we're gonna explain each one but before
01:21 - let's just go through the rules for
01:23 - naming the variables unfortunately you
01:26 - cannot name the variable whatever you
01:28 - want there is some rule that you have to
01:30 - follow first of all your variables
01:33 - cannot start with an with a number you
01:37 - can do an underscore a letter if you
01:39 - want though and notice that the Python
01:44 - is case sensitive so bully with a cap
01:47 - with an uppercase B at the beginning is
01:50 - different from boy with a lowercase B
01:57 - so if you try and turn the variable on
02:01 - them pressing enter and you regret with
02:03 - your roach and you want to delete it
02:04 - you'll often find Python not responding
02:08 - to you
02:09 - that's where dull funk should come in if
02:12 - you want to delete any variable that you
02:14 - should be using good cell function and
02:17 - if you want to add a variable you should
02:20 - use that append function so how are
02:28 - variables formed well variables are
02:32 - formed when you when some when you
02:35 - assign a value to them for instance if
02:38 - you have a test and you had a math test
02:43 - and you wanted to record all of your
02:46 - tests on Python so you make like a
02:48 - program on your phone to check all of
02:50 - your exams and say there's a friend's or
02:54 - something like that you will have to put
02:56 - a value for each test so if you got 57
03:00 - on your first exam then you should then
03:04 - the value of the first variable which is
03:06 - test one is 57 while the value for test
03:10 - 3 is 96 and you can see how you have
03:13 - improved so what are numbers numbers are
03:19 - used to store numeric values in Python
03:22 - and we have a lot of types of numbers
03:26 - when we have int known as integer then
03:31 - we have long integer floats and complex
03:34 - numbers okay so what are int int as we
03:40 - sent our integers there are usually
03:42 - positive or negative and they have no
03:44 - decimal point but if they should also be
03:47 - a whole number
03:49 - what our long integers so long integers
03:53 - are very long and they are usually
03:57 - unlimited they are infinite and usually
04:02 - you would use the L the letter L to tell
04:05 - Python
04:06 - a long number and now we're going to be
04:11 - talking about floats floats are real
04:14 - numbers represented with a decimal point
04:16 - dividing the integer and the fractional
04:18 - part and sometimes you would have to
04:21 - write fluids using the scientific
04:23 - notation so for example if you want to
04:28 - write six point seven times ten to the
04:30 - power of five in Python what you have to
04:33 - do is replace the 10 with an e and this
04:35 - is how Python will get it that you are
04:37 - trying to tell Python that you are
04:40 - entering the fluid using the scientific
04:42 - notation now let's talk about complex
04:47 - numbers complex the built-in function
04:49 - that returns a complex number with real
04:51 - and imaginary values it is usually used
04:54 - to convert a string or a number into a
04:56 - complex one so here are a few examples
05:01 - of each that we just learned right now
05:04 - so here we have integers you can see
05:08 - positive 10 positive 100 if you don't
05:11 - see a plus sign that means it's positive
05:13 - well if you see a negative sign then
05:14 - it's negative so we have minus 786
05:17 - positive 0 8 0 or positive 80 negative 0
05:23 - 4 9 0 and so on
05:26 - you can even add a letter like x over
05:29 - here then for long variables we have
05:32 - blang very long numbers letter L notice
05:36 - even here so here we have an upper tier
05:39 - L and here we have a lower key L it's
05:42 - your choice you can put whichever you
05:45 - need and then we have to the floats we
05:48 - have decimal points and negative
05:51 - positive here we have a notation and
05:54 - next to have complex more letters you
05:58 - can see they're kind of complicated
06:00 - letters in between negative sign
06:03 - decimals and let's move on now we will
06:08 - be talking about strings strings are
06:11 - Aries easily like let's explain that
06:16 - string is a word or sentence they are
06:19 - usually enclosed by double or single
06:20 - Cartesians if you want to know more
06:23 - about double and single quotations and
06:25 - placeholder then make sure to check out
06:27 - our last video where we showed you how
06:31 - to use the double and single could
06:34 - scopes
06:35 - I'll link that in the description box
06:39 - but sometimes you would often find to
06:42 - find people using triple codes and the
06:46 - reason is that when a string has many
06:49 - single codes or double codes the string
06:52 - extends over a multiple line as
06:54 - difficult so you'll have to use them
06:57 - okay so lists are variables that can
07:01 - hold a number of string in an organized
07:03 - set and fortunately there's also rules
07:07 - for lessons but they are really easy
07:10 - usually lists are written using square
07:14 - brackets and they contain a list of
07:16 - values obviously you can always change
07:19 - the size of the value which is a good
07:21 - thing and individual items are fruits
07:24 - too using the index number now let's
07:27 - talk a little bit about tuples tuple is
07:31 - a collection which is ordered and
07:32 - unchangeable written using round
07:34 - brackets called the parentheses and a
07:38 - tuple consists of a number of values
07:40 - separated by commas unlike lists so
07:45 - there are also rules for tuples
07:48 - you always enclose the tuples in
07:52 - parentheses if you don't know what
07:54 - parentheses are they're around kind of
07:58 - brackets they're also mentioned here and
08:02 - tuples usually contain a fixed list of
08:05 - values and they cannot be changed so
08:07 - size and values cannot be changed and
08:11 - Seema's lisps individual items are
08:15 - referred to using that index number so
08:18 - the difference between tuples and lists
08:20 - the main difference is that lists are
08:23 - enclosed in square brackets
08:26 - and their element and size can be
08:28 - changed while tuples are enclosed in
08:31 - parentheses and they have circled type
08:34 - of or curved type of brackets and they
08:37 - cannot be updated cannot be changed okay
08:41 - so let's talk a little bit more about
08:43 - dictionaries a dictionary is a
08:46 - collection which is unordered changeable
08:48 - and indexed so the difference between
08:51 - lists and dictionaries is that a list is
08:54 - an ordered sequence of objects where
08:57 - dictionaries are unordered and they're
08:58 - all over the place alright guys I hope
09:03 - this video was easier for you
09:05 - I think by the end of this by the end of
09:07 - this video you have understand what is
09:11 - all of these variables and I hope you
09:15 - guys enjoyed it and learn something you
09:17 - make sure to LIKE this video if you did
09:19 - and subscribe to our channel to become
09:23 - one of the members of our family and to
09:25 - be a young programmer make sure to also
09:28 - turn the notification Val on to get
09:30 - notified every time we upload a new
09:31 - video more videos will be coming for
09:34 - programming on Python keep programming
09:38 - and I'll see you guys next time on
09:39 - programming bye for now
