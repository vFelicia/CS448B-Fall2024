00:00 - [Music]
00:04 - hello everyone and welcome to
00:05 - programming kids
00:07 - my name is lynn and in today's video
00:09 - i'll be teaching you guys
00:11 - um squares and rectangles in python this
00:14 - is more like an introduction to
00:15 - animation which is just
00:16 - the best part but python being able to
00:19 - draw a girl for your app
00:21 - or draw a girl for something or a
00:24 - company
00:25 - or a logo this probably has to be the
00:28 - best part of a python
00:29 - you have the flexibility to create
00:31 - amazing things
00:32 - but in order to do that you have to
00:34 - learn the basic shapes like
00:36 - a circle squares triangle rectangles
00:39 - and um in our last video we did
00:42 - we did a whole video about circles so
00:44 - make sure to check it out i'll be
00:45 - linking it in the description box
00:48 - okay now let's
00:51 - um tell you the three main things that
00:53 - we'll be talking about
00:55 - first we will create a square and we
00:57 - will fill it with your favorite color
00:59 - then we will create a rectangle and we
01:01 - will also fill that with your favorite
01:02 - color
01:03 - and last but not least the most the best
01:06 - part
01:07 - we're going to be creating a matrix so
01:09 - if you don't know
01:10 - what's a matrix and keep on watching
01:13 - all right make sure to grab a notebook
01:15 - or a cup of tea and
01:16 - let's get into it first i'll be opening
01:19 - idle which is the main thing for coding
01:21 - on python
01:24 - then i i'll have to create a new file so
01:27 - file
01:28 - new file and then i'll have to name my
01:30 - file
01:32 - so i'll name it as hashtag square
01:36 - dot py then i have to import turtle
01:39 - turtle
01:40 - is just the main thing for making your
01:43 - graphics
01:44 - real so whatever code you do
01:48 - python actually opens the python
01:50 - launcher and there are the
01:52 - view the the graphic
01:55 - okay now we will have to name our
01:57 - material i'll just name it with
01:59 - ask t you can name it as bob
02:02 - and press equal but for me i'll just
02:04 - name it as
02:05 - t so t is equal to
02:09 - turtle dots
02:14 - just like that and i'll have to put
02:16 - brackets and press enter
02:18 - then we will have to choose a color
02:22 - so that our turtle will use so
02:25 - i'll type the dot full color
02:31 - and open the bracket and type
02:34 - orange i want my turtle to use arm
02:39 - okay so let's just type that properly
02:42 - and press enter
02:50 - okay next we want to
02:53 - oops what happened okay next
02:57 - i want to start i want my
03:01 - turtle to start feeling like whatever
03:04 - shape i draw from now on i want
03:05 - materials to fill it with that color
03:08 - okay so we have to type d dot
03:12 - begin underscore fill
03:16 - okay and press enter
03:19 - then we will have to start a loop so
03:22 - i'll just type four
03:24 - i in range
03:27 - four okay and
03:32 - because this is a loop you'll have to
03:34 - put on
03:36 - you will have to put columns and press
03:39 - enter
03:40 - okay because we put column it starts
03:42 - underneath the eye
03:43 - and what does this what does this loop
03:45 - actually mean it means that
03:48 - we want turtle to draw this
03:51 - four times you can type whatever you
03:53 - have to four times but this is quicker
03:56 - and the code looks smaller okay
03:59 - and okay now let's type
04:03 - how many steps we want our children to
04:05 - move
04:06 - so i think i'll go
04:11 - okay uh i think i'll go ahead and make
04:15 - it 200.
04:17 - you can experiment with it maybe you can
04:19 - try making it 500
04:21 - or maybe one or whatever you want
04:25 - okay and then i have to choose an angle
04:27 - because this is a
04:28 - square the angle is always 90 degrees
04:35 - right press enter and
04:38 - now we have to end the fold this is not
04:40 - part of the loop so i just started from
04:43 - the
04:43 - beginning
04:48 - [Music]
04:52 - and yeah
04:58 - okay and here it is i type d dot and
05:03 - underscore fill okay guys now let's
05:07 - save this and then run it i'll just save
05:10 - it on my desktop
05:11 - ask where
05:16 - and now let's run it
05:23 - whoa isn't that cool as
05:26 - perfect square with my favorite color
05:29 - how about we change it up a little bit
05:31 - how about i
05:32 - tie i make this
05:37 - thousand 6000 six thousand how about
05:38 - that
05:40 - let's see what happens
05:43 - whoa it's gigantic it doesn't even feel
05:46 - there
05:48 - oh look it doesn't work probably because
05:51 - our
05:52 - screen is too small and we're gonna have
05:54 - to maximize it
06:01 - oh my gosh it looks really long let's
06:04 - try making it smaller
06:06 - maybe type maybe type i should i think i
06:10 - should type
06:11 - one this time
06:15 - let me do 50 let's try 50 first then we
06:17 - can go smaller
06:19 - all right
06:24 - oh isn't that really small okay let's
06:28 - see what happens if i want to make my
06:30 - angle 60 degrees do you think this will
06:33 - look a square
06:36 - let's see whoops
06:39 - it is not a square and this is why you
06:41 - should always keep
06:43 - your um angle as 90 degrees if you're
06:45 - drawing a square
06:46 - rectangle all right let's try
06:50 - 10 and let's run this
06:54 - press enter and here it is
06:57 - oh my god that is so tiny
07:00 - okay guys that's it for this square
07:04 - program now let's move on to the next
07:06 - one i'm just gonna exit this and open it
07:08 - again
07:09 - and plus i always have my folder on my
07:11 - desktop in case i want to run this again
07:13 - and show it to my friends
07:15 - okay so we'll open idle again
07:19 - and start a new file oh
07:23 - okay then we'll have to name it
07:26 - and hashtag rectangle
07:31 - dot py and then oh i typed rectangle
07:35 - wrong
07:38 - all right then i have to import turtle
07:43 - okay let me just make this big
07:47 - okay then we will have to name
07:50 - our churches so i'll just name it as
07:54 - t
07:57 - turtle dot
08:01 - okay then i'll press enter
08:04 - and i'll pick the color i want my turtle
08:07 - to use
08:08 - so i think i'll put pink
08:21 - okay then i want her to begin fill
08:24 - right after i choose the color so begin
08:27 - underscore fill because it's a variable
08:32 - okay then i have to start my loop so
08:36 - for eyes
08:42 - i want her to repeat this whenever i'm
08:44 - writing right now
08:45 - two times and because this is a loop
08:48 - i will always put in columns and
08:52 - press enter okay and now
08:55 - i have to choose how many steps i wanted
08:58 - to move forward
09:01 - okay
09:05 - forward i want her to move
09:08 - 150
09:11 - let's make it 300 250 so make it more
09:15 - interesting
09:16 - okay then left 90 degrees because it has
09:19 - a right angle
09:23 - okay and forward
09:26 - again this time 200 this time 300.
09:34 - forward
09:38 - all right and last but not least left
09:40 - one more time
09:41 - 90 degrees okay and we're going to be
09:45 - ending the fill
09:46 - so t dot end underscore
09:52 - and here we go
09:56 - now let's run it but before we do that
09:58 - let's
09:59 - make sure to save it i'll save it as
10:02 - rectangle
10:07 - okay and on my desktop just beside the
10:11 - first one
10:15 - okay and
10:18 - here it is rectangle.py
10:23 - all right let's run this
10:30 - whoa isn't that nice
10:34 - this is really cool i really love the
10:36 - pink color
10:39 - it might look like a square but um
10:42 - this side is different from this side so
10:45 - they don't have equal side so
10:47 - this is just proof that it's not a
10:50 - square
10:51 - okay let's try changing it up a little
10:55 - bit
10:56 - so how about we make it
10:59 - we make this 150
11:03 - let's run this
11:10 - that looks more like a rectangle to me
11:13 - but how about i make this
11:14 - big how about i make this 400
11:20 - let's see what happens oh
11:24 - okay yeah that's a perfect rectangle to
11:26 - me
11:28 - well i really love the color of this
11:30 - rectangle
11:31 - and python has a really good job of
11:34 - choosing the colors
11:35 - like the orange one too from the square
11:38 - was really cool
11:39 - now let's exit and we can always go back
11:42 - to it from my desktop
11:43 - and show it to my friends and let's move
11:45 - on to the to the last
11:47 - program the matrix matrix
11:51 - so let's go ahead and open idle and
11:55 - get ready for this so we're going to be
11:57 - opening a new file and naming it
12:00 - so i'll just name it as hashtag
12:04 - um matrix and press enter
12:08 - okay now i'll have to um
12:11 - import turtle
12:15 - import
12:19 - and press enter then i'll have to
12:22 - name my character so i'll name it i'll
12:25 - name her as
12:25 - tv so turtle
12:29 - dots
12:33 - okay and this might be a little bit
12:36 - confusing
12:37 - but it's we're all just
12:41 - defining in the first part in the whole
12:44 - first part we're just defining every
12:45 - single thing
12:46 - because python won't understand if you
12:48 - don't define okay
12:50 - so we will start defining so dia
12:54 - means define so i'll enter my variable
12:57 - over here so it's
12:58 - joe underscore bill
13:02 - underscore rectangle so
13:05 - basically the matrix is small rectangles
13:09 - and they will be filled okay but i'm
13:12 - going to be defining
13:13 - what is going to be inside this over
13:16 - here
13:16 - okay one there will be my turtle
13:20 - there will be the x axis and the y-axis
13:24 - then i'll have my width i'll have a
13:28 - height
13:30 - i'll have a size
13:35 - a color and fill
13:39 - okay and then here put my columns and
13:42 - press enter
13:43 - okay so make sure that you included
13:47 - each of these okay
13:50 - [Music]
13:52 - so i had a t i have an x i have a y
13:55 - with height size color
13:58 - info so in total you're supposed to have
14:01 - one
14:02 - two three four five six seven and eight
14:09 - okay let's move on now i'll be
14:12 - typing in the full command
14:17 - and um i'll have to
14:21 - put the main thing from that command
14:23 - like
14:25 - i'll i'll type it in and hopefully you
14:26 - guys will understand so tdot
14:28 - fill color and
14:32 - t dot pen
14:35 - color and then um t dot
14:39 - pen size
14:42 - okay and then
14:46 - t dot set heading
14:52 - okay okay so
14:55 - now from the fill color the most
14:58 - important thing that i have
15:00 - that python should get me from here is
15:02 - the fill
15:05 - here it's the color
15:12 - okay color
15:15 - then here is the size
15:22 - and for the set heading just type zero
15:24 - you don't really have to worry about
15:25 - this decide 0
15:27 - okay and then we will continue um
15:33 - so t dot
15:36 - g dot again underscore film so i'm
15:40 - telling my churchill
15:41 - to begin their fell right now
15:44 - okay and then i want you to go up okay
15:46 - so t
15:48 - up then i want you to go
15:52 - on to x axis and the y axis so t
15:55 - does go to
15:59 - x comma y
16:03 - okay then i want you to go down so t dot
16:07 - down
16:10 - now we will be just um learning the
16:14 - first part about our
16:17 - rectangle so so t dot forward
16:23 - we're just going to specify what does
16:24 - that mean okay
16:26 - see the forward
16:32 - oh okay um the width
16:36 - this is the width i'm just telling
16:37 - python
16:39 - okay then um the right you'll be drawing
16:43 - the right now so
16:44 - t dot rise that should be at 90 degrees
16:46 - because this is a
16:48 - um rectangle okay and
16:53 - now over here we're drawing the right
16:54 - side okay
16:56 - so the right side of the rectangle so
16:58 - the angle is 90 degrees and the forward
17:02 - that so forward this is the height
17:05 - specifying that for python
17:09 - and for you guys also okay next
17:12 - we will be drawing the bottom part so
17:16 - t dot right
17:19 - and that is a 90 degrees then um
17:24 - that t dot t.4 rate is
17:28 - that's the width for the bottom part
17:34 - okay then i have the left side
17:38 - okay so t dot right
17:42 - 90 degrees okay then
17:46 - the um the forwards when it moves
17:48 - forward this
17:49 - will be the height
17:58 - height
18:00 - okay and then um i'm going to be ending
18:03 - my field right over here
18:06 - that's it turtle you don't have to color
18:08 - anything anymore
18:09 - okay and here we go
18:14 - yeah okay now i'm gonna be checking that
18:17 - my
18:18 - program over here is correct
18:21 - okay so
18:28 - okay let's move on now we will be
18:32 - just um creating another loop this is
18:35 - the end of the first loop this all was a
18:37 - loop
18:38 - probably why it was really um confusing
18:42 - now we're going to start a new one and
18:43 - this is for just the range for x and y
18:46 - and just defining the full the full
18:49 - rectangle
18:51 - just how many steps i wanted to move and
18:54 - then we're done
18:54 - okay so first let's type the range for
18:57 - axle for x
18:58 - for x and y i'll make the move range
19:00 - should be both the same
19:02 - so um for x
19:05 - in range
19:09 - one and eight
19:14 - okay i'm gonna put a column
19:18 - then four y
19:22 - in range that should be the same so
19:26 - one and eight
19:30 - okay and we'll put my column again
19:32 - because this is a loop
19:33 - then last but not least i'm just gonna
19:36 - um type in with a throw underscore fold
19:39 - underscore
19:41 - rectangle how many times i want that to
19:43 - be how wide the x and the y how much
19:46 - i want them to be so don't underscore
19:53 - underscore rectangle
19:57 - and i'll open up my brackets and type t
20:03 - minus 200 plus
20:09 - x times
20:12 - so this here is here this is for x times
20:15 - 20. this is how many
20:17 - steps i want my um
20:22 - accent b okay then for my y i wanted to
20:26 - move y
20:27 - times 20. that's it i'll just type some
20:30 - extra information so 20
20:33 - another 20 in a two
20:37 - and now i'll choose my colors so
20:40 - my colors i want them to be black and
20:42 - white because i believe that that would
20:44 - be the coolest you can go ahead and try
20:46 - red
20:46 - in like green or red and black or
20:49 - whatever you want
20:50 - okay so i'll type white
20:55 - white comma
21:00 - black
21:04 - all right and
21:07 - i'll have to close the brackets
21:13 - all right guys so we're probably done
21:18 - so i'll go ahead and type
21:22 - turtle dot done
21:25 - her job is finished she is done
21:28 - okay here it is
21:32 - so again let's check this but probably
21:35 - because it's complicated you'll always
21:37 - have feeling that there's something
21:38 - wrong with this
21:39 - so i'm just gonna check
21:47 - all right seems like everything is good
21:51 - let's try saving it and i'll just save
21:54 - it next to my three
21:56 - um to my other two so i'll save it as
21:59 - matrix
22:01 - on my desktop
22:04 - and we'll save it and here it is i have
22:07 - all my three
22:08 - things that i created today storage over
22:10 - here so i can show my
22:12 - friends all right guys now we're going
22:14 - to have to run this so here we go
22:16 - moment through
22:22 - okay this is starting up on flow but
22:24 - wait for the result
22:26 - let's wait
22:29 - whoa guys isn't this really cool i don't
22:32 - know why but i find it real really cool
22:34 - let's try to change up the colors how
22:36 - about red
22:40 - and black let's run this let's see how
22:43 - it looks
22:48 - whoa that's also really cool but i feel
22:50 - like white
22:52 - is probably my favorite at white and
22:53 - black because
22:55 - the screen the background is white so i
22:58 - just feel like it looks really cool but
22:59 - you can also make the background red if
23:01 - you want
23:04 - well guys that's it for today's video i
23:06 - hope you guys learned a lot about
23:08 - rectangles and triangle i mean
23:10 - rectangles and squares
23:12 - and i hope this wasn't as hard for you i
23:15 - just thought it would be a fun thing to
23:17 - include in today's video
23:19 - because it has something to do with
23:21 - rectangles
23:23 - so yeah i hope you guys enjoyed this
23:25 - keep programming and i'll see you guys
23:27 - next time on programming kids bye for
23:34 - now
23:36 - [Music]
23:38 - you

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone and welcome to programming kids my name is lynn and in today's video i'll be teaching you guys um squares and rectangles in python this is more like an introduction to animation which is just the best part but python being able to draw a girl for your app or draw a girl for something or a company or a logo this probably has to be the best part of a python you have the flexibility to create amazing things but in order to do that you have to learn the basic shapes like a circle squares triangle rectangles and um in our last video we did we did a whole video about circles so make sure to check it out i'll be linking it in the description box okay now let's um tell you the three main things that we'll be talking about first we will create a square and we will fill it with your favorite color then we will create a rectangle and we will also fill that with your favorite color and last but not least the most the best part we're going to be creating a matrix so if you don't know what's a matrix and keep on watching all right make sure to grab a notebook or a cup of tea and let's get into it first i'll be opening idle which is the main thing for coding on python then i i'll have to create a new file so file new file and then i'll have to name my file so i'll name it as hashtag square dot py then i have to import turtle turtle is just the main thing for making your graphics real so whatever code you do python actually opens the python launcher and there are the view the the graphic okay now we will have to name our material i'll just name it with ask t you can name it as bob and press equal but for me i'll just name it as t so t is equal to turtle dots just like that and i'll have to put brackets and press enter then we will have to choose a color so that our turtle will use so i'll type the dot full color and open the bracket and type orange i want my turtle to use arm okay so let's just type that properly and press enter okay next we want to oops what happened okay next i want to start i want my turtle to start feeling like whatever shape i draw from now on i want materials to fill it with that color okay so we have to type d dot begin underscore fill okay and press enter then we will have to start a loop so i'll just type four i in range four okay and because this is a loop you'll have to put on you will have to put columns and press enter okay because we put column it starts underneath the eye and what does this what does this loop actually mean it means that we want turtle to draw this four times you can type whatever you have to four times but this is quicker and the code looks smaller okay and okay now let's type how many steps we want our children to move so i think i'll go okay uh i think i'll go ahead and make it 200. you can experiment with it maybe you can try making it 500 or maybe one or whatever you want okay and then i have to choose an angle because this is a square the angle is always 90 degrees right press enter and now we have to end the fold this is not part of the loop so i just started from the beginning and yeah okay and here it is i type d dot and underscore fill okay guys now let's save this and then run it i'll just save it on my desktop ask where and now let's run it whoa isn't that cool as perfect square with my favorite color how about we change it up a little bit how about i tie i make this thousand 6000 six thousand how about that let's see what happens whoa it's gigantic it doesn't even feel there oh look it doesn't work probably because our screen is too small and we're gonna have to maximize it oh my gosh it looks really long let's try making it smaller maybe type maybe type i should i think i should type one this time let me do 50 let's try 50 first then we can go smaller all right oh isn't that really small okay let's see what happens if i want to make my angle 60 degrees do you think this will look a square let's see whoops it is not a square and this is why you should always keep your um angle as 90 degrees if you're drawing a square rectangle all right let's try 10 and let's run this press enter and here it is oh my god that is so tiny okay guys that's it for this square program now let's move on to the next one i'm just gonna exit this and open it again and plus i always have my folder on my desktop in case i want to run this again and show it to my friends okay so we'll open idle again and start a new file oh okay then we'll have to name it and hashtag rectangle dot py and then oh i typed rectangle wrong all right then i have to import turtle okay let me just make this big okay then we will have to name our churches so i'll just name it as t turtle dot okay then i'll press enter and i'll pick the color i want my turtle to use so i think i'll put pink okay then i want her to begin fill right after i choose the color so begin underscore fill because it's a variable okay then i have to start my loop so for eyes i want her to repeat this whenever i'm writing right now two times and because this is a loop i will always put in columns and press enter okay and now i have to choose how many steps i wanted to move forward okay forward i want her to move 150 let's make it 300 250 so make it more interesting okay then left 90 degrees because it has a right angle okay and forward again this time 200 this time 300. forward all right and last but not least left one more time 90 degrees okay and we're going to be ending the fill so t dot end underscore and here we go now let's run it but before we do that let's make sure to save it i'll save it as rectangle okay and on my desktop just beside the first one okay and here it is rectangle.py all right let's run this whoa isn't that nice this is really cool i really love the pink color it might look like a square but um this side is different from this side so they don't have equal side so this is just proof that it's not a square okay let's try changing it up a little bit so how about we make it we make this 150 let's run this that looks more like a rectangle to me but how about i make this big how about i make this 400 let's see what happens oh okay yeah that's a perfect rectangle to me well i really love the color of this rectangle and python has a really good job of choosing the colors like the orange one too from the square was really cool now let's exit and we can always go back to it from my desktop and show it to my friends and let's move on to the to the last program the matrix matrix so let's go ahead and open idle and get ready for this so we're going to be opening a new file and naming it so i'll just name it as hashtag um matrix and press enter okay now i'll have to um import turtle import and press enter then i'll have to name my character so i'll name it i'll name her as tv so turtle dots okay and this might be a little bit confusing but it's we're all just defining in the first part in the whole first part we're just defining every single thing because python won't understand if you don't define okay so we will start defining so dia means define so i'll enter my variable over here so it's joe underscore bill underscore rectangle so basically the matrix is small rectangles and they will be filled okay but i'm going to be defining what is going to be inside this over here okay one there will be my turtle there will be the x axis and the yaxis then i'll have my width i'll have a height i'll have a size a color and fill okay and then here put my columns and press enter okay so make sure that you included each of these okay so i had a t i have an x i have a y with height size color info so in total you're supposed to have one two three four five six seven and eight okay let's move on now i'll be typing in the full command and um i'll have to put the main thing from that command like i'll i'll type it in and hopefully you guys will understand so tdot fill color and t dot pen color and then um t dot pen size okay and then t dot set heading okay okay so now from the fill color the most important thing that i have that python should get me from here is the fill here it's the color okay color then here is the size and for the set heading just type zero you don't really have to worry about this decide 0 okay and then we will continue um so t dot g dot again underscore film so i'm telling my churchill to begin their fell right now okay and then i want you to go up okay so t up then i want you to go on to x axis and the y axis so t does go to x comma y okay then i want you to go down so t dot down now we will be just um learning the first part about our rectangle so so t dot forward we're just going to specify what does that mean okay see the forward oh okay um the width this is the width i'm just telling python okay then um the right you'll be drawing the right now so t dot rise that should be at 90 degrees because this is a um rectangle okay and now over here we're drawing the right side okay so the right side of the rectangle so the angle is 90 degrees and the forward that so forward this is the height specifying that for python and for you guys also okay next we will be drawing the bottom part so t dot right and that is a 90 degrees then um that t dot t.4 rate is that's the width for the bottom part okay then i have the left side okay so t dot right 90 degrees okay then the um the forwards when it moves forward this will be the height height okay and then um i'm going to be ending my field right over here that's it turtle you don't have to color anything anymore okay and here we go yeah okay now i'm gonna be checking that my program over here is correct okay so okay let's move on now we will be just um creating another loop this is the end of the first loop this all was a loop probably why it was really um confusing now we're going to start a new one and this is for just the range for x and y and just defining the full the full rectangle just how many steps i wanted to move and then we're done okay so first let's type the range for axle for x for x and y i'll make the move range should be both the same so um for x in range one and eight okay i'm gonna put a column then four y in range that should be the same so one and eight okay and we'll put my column again because this is a loop then last but not least i'm just gonna um type in with a throw underscore fold underscore rectangle how many times i want that to be how wide the x and the y how much i want them to be so don't underscore underscore rectangle and i'll open up my brackets and type t minus 200 plus x times so this here is here this is for x times 20. this is how many steps i want my um accent b okay then for my y i wanted to move y times 20. that's it i'll just type some extra information so 20 another 20 in a two and now i'll choose my colors so my colors i want them to be black and white because i believe that that would be the coolest you can go ahead and try red in like green or red and black or whatever you want okay so i'll type white white comma black all right and i'll have to close the brackets all right guys so we're probably done so i'll go ahead and type turtle dot done her job is finished she is done okay here it is so again let's check this but probably because it's complicated you'll always have feeling that there's something wrong with this so i'm just gonna check all right seems like everything is good let's try saving it and i'll just save it next to my three um to my other two so i'll save it as matrix on my desktop and we'll save it and here it is i have all my three things that i created today storage over here so i can show my friends all right guys now we're going to have to run this so here we go moment through okay this is starting up on flow but wait for the result let's wait whoa guys isn't this really cool i don't know why but i find it real really cool let's try to change up the colors how about red and black let's run this let's see how it looks whoa that's also really cool but i feel like white is probably my favorite at white and black because the screen the background is white so i just feel like it looks really cool but you can also make the background red if you want well guys that's it for today's video i hope you guys learned a lot about rectangles and triangle i mean rectangles and squares and i hope this wasn't as hard for you i just thought it would be a fun thing to include in today's video because it has something to do with rectangles so yeah i hope you guys enjoyed this keep programming and i'll see you guys next time on programming kids bye for now you
