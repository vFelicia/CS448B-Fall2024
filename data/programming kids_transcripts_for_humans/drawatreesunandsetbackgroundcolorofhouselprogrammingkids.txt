00:04 - hello everyone
00:05 - welcome to programming kids my name is
00:08 - lynn
00:09 - and in today's video we will be
00:12 - completing the look
00:13 - of our house from our last video
00:16 - so in today's video we will be creating
00:20 - our house to look a little bit cooler
00:23 - just maybe change the background color
00:26 - and
00:27 - add a little sun and also draw a little
00:30 - tree so
00:33 - i'm really excited for this and i hope
00:35 - you guys are
00:36 - so unfortunately we will not be showing
00:39 - the code from
00:40 - for the house you're going to have to
00:42 - click that link in the description box
00:43 - to go through
00:44 - our last video well
00:48 - let's start i'm going to be opening idle
00:52 - okay and
00:55 - oh let me close this first because if
00:57 - you don't close the file that you have
01:00 - that are open already it will never open
01:03 - all right
01:04 - and as you can see my house
01:07 - program found last week is here you
01:10 - should definitely go check out that
01:11 - video
01:12 - and now we're going to be creating a new
01:14 - file by pressing file
01:16 - you file just like that and i'm going to
01:19 - be pasting
01:20 - the code for the house okay so
01:25 - i'm just gonna paste it
01:30 - okay on my new file
01:33 - here so here's everything that i need
01:37 - for the house
01:39 - so that i can complete the new
01:42 - uh the complete look for that okay
01:45 - so
01:49 - we will be starting off with this korean
01:52 - background color
01:53 - and in order to do that
01:57 - all we have to do is um
02:00 - use the screen is equal to turtle dot
02:02 - screen parenthesis command
02:04 - so first i'm just going to name this for
02:06 - y'all just so you won't get confused
02:11 - all right so screen is equal to
02:16 - journal dot screen
02:19 - and don't forget to include the
02:21 - parentheses just so you won't get an
02:22 - error
02:25 - let me put here some space
02:31 - all right and now we're going to be
02:35 - choosing our color so it's korean
02:39 - dot bg color
02:42 - and parenthesis code
02:45 - creation marks and the color so you can
02:49 - use blue
02:50 - if you want but to me i feel like blue
02:52 - is way too dark so i like to use sky
02:54 - blue
02:56 - and thankfully python understand
02:59 - what does sky blue mean and they will
03:02 - hopefully respond
03:05 - all right now we will be
03:08 - um creating the tree base
03:13 - for our tree so i'm just gonna name this
03:16 - again
03:20 - and let's turn it i'm going to make my
03:23 - turtle
03:24 - get her pen ready get ready for drawing
03:27 - and put her pen up so
03:30 - usually the pen app goes to and pan down
03:33 - they don't draw anything
03:34 - it's just for us to tell python that
03:36 - here i don't want to draw anything
03:38 - i just want to move to specific place
03:41 - okay so first we will
03:44 - type pen up retelling python that i
03:47 - don't want you to draw
03:49 - anything over here i want you to go to a
03:51 - specific place
03:52 - okay so to go to
04:01 - so i want them to go to the 250
04:07 - it's somewhere around the screen so if
04:10 - you went to
04:10 - a specific place you might have to try
04:12 - it several times to find the place that
04:14 - you like
04:19 - and it's probably based on the accesses
04:21 - and the y-axis but you don't have to
04:23 - worry about them
04:24 - just find the place where you think the
04:26 - turtle or the sun
04:27 - would look i mean the tree or the sun
04:30 - will look
04:30 - good all right and i'm gonna tell python
04:33 - to
04:34 - put her pen or my turtle temperature pan
04:36 - down
04:37 - and you can start actually drawing from
04:40 - now on
04:41 - okay so we will choose a color that so
04:44 - that the tree base can be in
04:46 - and i was thinking of brown is probably
04:48 - most
04:49 - the most realistic color so fill color
04:53 - and brown and here we go
04:58 - include your creations your brackets and
05:01 - let's press enter and now i'm going to
05:04 - tell my turtle to begin
05:06 - filling whatever i draw from now on so t
05:08 - dot begin
05:12 - underscore fill and my brackets
05:16 - now i'm going to be moving backwards and
05:20 - putting in some angles so these can
05:22 - probably change
05:24 - depending on what length you want and
05:26 - what size or what angle
05:28 - but i'm going to be importing mine
06:03 - and finishing up i'm going to be ending
06:05 - with a tdot and fall
06:07 - telling python or turtle that over here
06:10 - i'm done filling whatever
06:12 - i had to fill and now i want you to stop
06:15 - it
06:16 - and yeah we are done with the tree base
06:20 - so let's now start the tree top
06:24 - and the tree top will be like two
06:26 - triangles
06:27 - so we're gonna have to create that again
06:29 - i'm gonna name this
06:31 - as hashtag treetop
06:35 - all right
06:39 - space okay so we we i'm going to be
06:42 - telling python
06:43 - to put or my turtle to put your pen up
06:47 - and
06:47 - stop um stop drawing for now just move
06:52 - where i want you to be
06:53 - exactly like we did over here in the top
06:56 - so
06:56 - t dot pen up
06:59 - and put in my parentheses and then t
07:03 - dot go to
07:07 - 250
07:10 - and minus 30.
07:14 - all right press enter and t dot pan down
07:21 - all right so now we're going to be
07:23 - choosing our color
07:25 - that we think would be the most
07:27 - realistic
07:28 - so you can go ahead and to choose any
07:31 - color that you love
07:33 - but i think for me i would want to go to
07:35 - a
07:36 - light green color i think that would
07:38 - look pretty fresh and
07:40 - nice so let's type it up fill
07:43 - color open up the brackets
07:46 - include the quotation marks and
07:50 - type light green
07:56 - and close okay we will be pressing enter
08:00 - and telling
08:01 - python to begin filling whatever we want
08:10 - so from now on python will be filling
08:13 - everything we draw
08:15 - all right so now
08:18 - i want to choose an angle
08:22 - perhaps 90 degrees would be good
08:25 - and move backwards and more angles i'm
08:28 - just going to go ahead and type them
08:30 - again you can be free to change them to
08:33 - something that you
08:34 - like or you prefer like the length and
08:37 - how big you want it to be
08:39 - in the directions in the angle size
08:43 - but this is what i'm doing
09:39 - all right finishing up i'm going to be
09:41 - and the fill
09:42 - meaning that i don't want nature to fill
09:45 - any more shapes
09:48 - here we go
09:51 - and enter so and now we will be
09:55 - filling in a white color and going
09:58 - over the tri that
10:02 - this triangle and the reason is if you
10:05 - don't do the following
10:06 - you will be getting a mix between the
10:10 - the color and it won't be colored
10:12 - properly
10:13 - so make sure to do this it's really
10:15 - important that you do or else
10:17 - you won't get a beautiful tree it will
10:19 - be the colors
10:21 - won't be clear and there would be like
10:23 - space where it's white or blue
10:25 - or whatever the background is so
10:28 - let's do this so dot fill color
10:38 - so you just have to use white
10:48 - all right we will also type in begin
10:50 - fill
10:51 - to just tell python that i want them to
10:53 - fill up
10:54 - now and i'm going to be
10:59 - moving forward 55 steps
11:06 - sorry i'm going to be for moving forward
11:08 - 90 steps and the
11:10 - angle should be 55.
11:14 - go left and 55 all right
11:17 - press enter and i'm going to end fill
11:19 - right now no more filling for me so now
11:28 - we have
11:29 - one triangle done and maybe if we
11:32 - make another one it should be looking
11:35 - better
11:36 - better than one triangle only so that's
11:39 - exactly what we will be doing
11:40 - i'm going to choose the color again
11:44 - and i'm going to be making it light
11:46 - green
11:47 - exactly like the first one
11:53 - right and i'm going to be beginning fill
11:58 - include the parentheses and press enter
12:01 - and
12:02 - just going to move backwards and
12:04 - forwards
12:06 - different steps and angles
12:46 - and lastly and underscore fill
12:49 - all right that was pretty easy now we're
12:52 - going to be drawing the sun
12:54 - and it's actually pretty simple we're
12:57 - just going to have to draw
12:59 - a circle with a specific radius and
13:02 - whatever color that we want so i'm just
13:05 - going to put the pen up again
13:06 - so that we can move freely without
13:08 - drawing anything so
13:10 - see that pen up and put in the brackets
13:14 - parentheses and i'm going to be typing t
13:17 - dot go to 150
13:23 - 250 again this is based on the axes
13:26 - and you can personally put it anywhere
13:29 - that you want anyway that you think
13:31 - looks good in
13:33 - and now we're going to be choosing the
13:35 - color so i think i would go with
13:38 - i want to go with orange because our my
13:41 - house is brown
13:42 - brown shade so i think orange will give
13:45 - a good pop
13:46 - and a good look okay
13:49 - so t dot felt color and
13:53 - orange parentheses ink
13:56 - um
14:00 - quotation marks okay here we go
14:05 - press enter and pan down
14:12 - telling python that from now on you can
14:14 - draw
14:15 - whatever you want whatever
14:18 - the code sell you okay let's begin phil
14:22 - first of all
14:26 - if you want to learn more about chips
14:29 - and python
14:30 - and intros animations make sure to check
14:33 - out
14:34 - our three intros to animations there are
14:38 - really easy steps and tutorials just for
14:41 - you guys
14:43 - i will be linking them in the
14:44 - description box down below
14:46 - all right now we will be typing to that
14:49 - circle and we will be giving our circle
14:51 - a radius
14:52 - so that python draws whatever we want so
14:55 - i'm going
14:56 - with 24.
14:59 - and i'm going to be ending file over
15:01 - here and
15:02 - on your score fill and
15:06 - include the brackets wow this looks
15:09 - pretty good to me let's uh
15:13 - save this so i'm going to save it next
15:15 - to the first one on my desktop
15:17 - and i'll save it
15:21 - as my house
15:24 - who knows maybe this can be my house in
15:26 - the future
15:28 - okay now that it's saved over here
15:31 - we're going to be running this so let's
15:33 - run all right
15:34 - so let's run press run
15:38 - and run module one two
15:41 - three the house is perfect
15:45 - the color is amazing and the tree is
15:48 - perfectly standing and the sun is
15:50 - shining
15:52 - isn't that cool guys i hope you guys
15:54 - enjoyed this video and had fun creating
15:56 - this
15:57 - as much as i did make sure to
16:00 - um check the description box to view all
16:03 - of our videos
16:05 - and check out our channel and check all
16:08 - the awesome videos that we do
16:10 - so keep programming and i'll see you
16:11 - guys next time on programming kids

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone welcome to programming kids my name is lynn and in today's video we will be completing the look of our house from our last video so in today's video we will be creating our house to look a little bit cooler just maybe change the background color and add a little sun and also draw a little tree so i'm really excited for this and i hope you guys are so unfortunately we will not be showing the code from for the house you're going to have to click that link in the description box to go through our last video well let's start i'm going to be opening idle okay and oh let me close this first because if you don't close the file that you have that are open already it will never open all right and as you can see my house program found last week is here you should definitely go check out that video and now we're going to be creating a new file by pressing file you file just like that and i'm going to be pasting the code for the house okay so i'm just gonna paste it okay on my new file here so here's everything that i need for the house so that i can complete the new uh the complete look for that okay so we will be starting off with this korean background color and in order to do that all we have to do is um use the screen is equal to turtle dot screen parenthesis command so first i'm just going to name this for y'all just so you won't get confused all right so screen is equal to journal dot screen and don't forget to include the parentheses just so you won't get an error let me put here some space all right and now we're going to be choosing our color so it's korean dot bg color and parenthesis code creation marks and the color so you can use blue if you want but to me i feel like blue is way too dark so i like to use sky blue and thankfully python understand what does sky blue mean and they will hopefully respond all right now we will be um creating the tree base for our tree so i'm just gonna name this again and let's turn it i'm going to make my turtle get her pen ready get ready for drawing and put her pen up so usually the pen app goes to and pan down they don't draw anything it's just for us to tell python that here i don't want to draw

the accesses and the yaxis but you don't have to worry about them just find the place where you think the turtle or the sun would look i mean the tree or the sun will look good all right and i'm gonna tell python to put her pen or my turtle temperature pan down and you can start actually drawing from now on okay so we will choose a color that so that the tree base can be in and i was thinking of brown is probably most the most realistic color so fill color and brown and here we go include your creations your brackets and let's press enter and now i'm going to tell my turtle to begin filling

gonna name this as hashtag treetop all right space okay so we we i'm going to be telling python to put or my turtle to put your pen up and stop um stop drawing for now just move where i want you to be exactly like we did over here in the top so t dot pen up and put in my parentheses and then t dot go to 250 and minus 30. all right press enter and t dot pan down all right so now we're going to be choosing our color that we think would be the most realistic so you can go ahead and to choose any color that you love but i think for me i would want to go to a light green color i think that would look pretty fresh and nice so let's type it up fill color open up the brackets include the quotation marks and type light green and close okay we will be pressing enter and telling python to begin filling whatever we want so from now on python will be filling everything we draw all right so now i want to choose an angle perhaps 90 degrees would be good and move backwards and more angles i'm just going to go ahead and type them again you can be free to change them to something that you like or you prefer like the length and how big you want it to be in the directions in the angle size but this is what i'm doing all right finishing up i'm going to be and the fill meaning that i don't want nature to fill any more shapes here we go and enter so and now we will be filling in a white color and going over the tri that this triangle and the reason is if you don't do the following you will be getting a mix between the the color and it won't be colored properly so make sure to do this it's really important that you do or else you won't get a beautiful tree it will be the colors won't be clear and there would be like space where it's white or blue or whatever the background is so let's do this so dot fill color so you just have to use white all right we will also type in begin fill to just tell python that i want them to fill up now and i'm going to be moving forward 55 steps sorry i'm going to be for moving forward 90 steps and the angle should be 55. go left and 55 all right press enter and i'm going to end fill right now no more filling for me so now we have one triangle done and maybe if we make another one it should be looking better better than one triangle only so that's exactly what we will be doing i'm going to choose the color again and i'm going to be making it light green exactly like the first one right and i'm going to be beginning fill include the parentheses and press enter and just going to move backwards and forwards different steps and angles and lastly and underscore fill all right that was pretty easy now we're going to be drawing the sun and it's actually pretty simple we're just going to have to draw a circle with a specific radius and whatever color that we want so i'm just going to put the pen up again so that we can move freely without drawing anything so see that pen up and put in the brackets parentheses and i'm going to be

learn more about chips and python and intros animations make sure to check out our three intros to animations there are really easy steps and tutorials just for you guys i will be linking them in the description box down below all right now we will be typing to that circle and we will be giving our circle a radius so that python draws whatever we want so i'm going with 24. and i'm going to be ending file over here and on your score fill and include the brackets wow this looks pretty good to me let's uh save this so i'm going to save it next to the first one on my desktop and i'll save it as my house who knows maybe this can be my house in the future okay now that it's saved over here we're going to be running this so let's run all right so let's run press run and run module one two three the house is perfect the color is amazing and the tree is perfectly standing and the sun is shining isn't that cool guys i hope you guys enjoyed this video and had fun creating this as much as i did make sure to um check the description box to view all of our videos and check out our channel and check all the awesome videos that we do so keep programming and i'll see you guys next time on
