00:04 - hello everyone and welcome to
00:06 - programming kids
00:07 - my name is lin and in today's video i'll
00:09 - be teaching you another cool graphic
00:12 - and if you haven't seen our other videos
00:14 - where we did
00:15 - so much fun creative graphics i make
00:18 - sure to try
00:18 - to check them out in the description box
00:21 - but for today we're going to be creating
00:23 - one of my favorite graphics which is a
00:26 - circle graphic
00:27 - on python obviously so
00:31 - make sure to grab a notebook or a cup of
00:32 - tea and let's get started
00:35 - so i'm right now and i'm on my desktop
00:38 - as you guys can see
00:40 - and i have to open idle which is the
00:42 - main thing for programming on python
00:45 - and first i have to search it on my
00:47 - spotlight search
00:48 - and just type i know and press
00:52 - enter and it will open okay and then i
00:55 - have to create a new file in order to do
00:57 - that you press
00:58 - file new file
01:01 - and here it is so
01:04 - first we have to name our program and
01:07 - this is not for python
01:09 - it's just for me to make everything
01:11 - clear to make everything
01:13 - um easy to identify okay so we always
01:17 - have to start with a hashtag this should
01:18 - be no spaces and whatever your name is
01:21 - at the end it should include the py okay
01:24 - so let's name it circle
01:28 - spiral dot
01:32 - py and press enter
01:37 - okay now i have to import turtle and
01:40 - turtle is just like a mini program in
01:43 - python
01:44 - for creating graphics and drawing
01:48 - so let's just type import journal
01:52 - and press enter and as you guys can see
01:54 - nothing happens
01:55 - that's because we didn't run it this is
01:58 - just the work just so everything can
02:00 - happen
02:01 - together at the same time okay now we i
02:04 - want my tear tools to hold your pen and
02:06 - get ready for
02:07 - drawing and let's just type that
02:10 - my turtle her name is t and we're just
02:14 - gonna press equal to turtle
02:17 - dot pen p should be capital or else
02:20 - they'll give you an error
02:23 - and here it is and let's press enter now
02:26 - i'm going to be
02:27 - starting a loop and this is probably the
02:29 - most confusing part about python
02:32 - but it's still really cool
02:36 - um once you understand it so first
02:39 - i'm going to type for x in range
02:45 - 100 okay and
02:55 - here we go let's close this and put
02:56 - kotlins and let me explain that
03:00 - okay so this is used
03:04 - for um
03:07 - to just see how big we want our circles
03:10 - or our
03:11 - program or or our graphic to look like
03:14 - so
03:15 - for x this can be a random number
03:18 - or anything so i just typed for x in
03:21 - range
03:22 - 100 this is how big i wanted to be
03:24 - usually you cannot pick more than a
03:26 - hundred so
03:27 - this is perfect and we add column
03:31 - at the end and as you guys can see
03:33 - because i added columns if i press
03:35 - enter it goes directly under the x but
03:38 - if i don't add crawl limbs like this it
03:41 - goes at the beginning
03:42 - this is how you can know if you're
03:44 - forming a correct loop or not
03:47 - it should be underneath the axe okay
03:50 - next we're going to be
03:51 - um just typing how wide we want it to be
03:56 - and i'm just going to type you know
03:58 - circle just ax for now
04:05 - and press enter and this is now we're
04:08 - going to
04:08 - choose the angle so because this is a
04:12 - circle
04:12 - i don't recommend to use a 90 degrees
04:16 - maybe use a 60 how about 60 i think that
04:19 - would be good
04:22 - left okay and 60 degrees
04:26 - just like that and press enter
04:29 - and now we have to save it because if
04:31 - you don't save it
04:33 - we don't have a chance to see a result
04:36 - i'm going to save it on my desk
04:41 - um i'll just save it on my
04:46 - desktop for now and save it as circle
04:49 - spiral
04:52 - circle dot spiral
04:56 - it's not necessary to put a dot but i
04:58 - just like to put it for fun
05:00 - okay let's save it and here it is
05:04 - it automatically saves it on my
05:07 - desktop and as you can see i never added
05:11 - dot py but python adds
05:13 - just so we know that the file is for
05:17 - python py python okay
05:20 - now let's run it my favorite part of the
05:24 - this all of graphics we have to press
05:27 - run and run module
05:35 - [Music]
05:36 - hmm
05:38 - so starting out really really small and
05:40 - tiny
05:48 - don't you think we should make it a
05:49 - little bit fast just so we can see the
05:52 - results quickly
05:53 - all right let me to make it as fast as
05:57 - you want
05:58 - underneath the turtle.pen just press
06:01 - enter
06:02 - and write t dot speed
06:07 - zero zero just for as fast as it can
06:11 - that's what it's mean
06:12 - and we're gonna file and save
06:17 - right and run
06:21 - you guys can see it shows also real
06:23 - start
06:24 - whoa that is really cool
06:28 - wow doesn't that look amazing
06:32 - this is what i love about python you can
06:34 - create magical stuff
06:36 - within a few codes
06:40 - i hope you guys enjoyed this as much as

hello everyone and welcome to programming kids my name is lin and in today's video i'll be teaching you another cool graphic and if you haven't seen our other videos where we did so much fun creative graphics i make sure to try to check them out in the description box but for today we're going to be creating one of my favorite graphics which is a circle graphic on python obviously so make sure to grab a notebook or a cup of tea and let's get started so i'm right now and i'm on my desktop as you guys can see and i have to open idle which is the main thing for programming on python and first i have to search it on my spotlight search and just type i know and press enter and it will open okay and then i have to create a new file in order to do that you press file new file and here it is so first we have to name our program and this is not for python it's just for me to make everything clear to make everything um easy to identify okay so we always have to start with a hashtag this should be no spaces and whatever your name is at the end it should include the py okay so let's name it circle spiral dot py and press enter okay now i have to import turtle and turtle is just like a mini program in python for creating graphics and drawing so let's just type import journal and press enter and as you guys can see nothing happens that's because we didn't run it this is just the work just so everything can happen together at the same time okay now we i want my tear tools to hold your pen and get ready for drawing and let's just type that my turtle her name is t and we're just gonna press equal to turtle dot pen p should be capital or else they'll give you an error and here it is and let's press enter now i'm going to be starting a loop and this is probably the most confusing part about python but it's still really cool um once you understand it so first i'm going to type for x in range 100 okay and here we go let's close this and put kotlins and let me explain that okay so this is used for um to just see how big we want our circles or our program or or our graphic to look like so for x this can be a random number or anything so i just typed for x in range 100 this is how big i wanted to be usually you cannot pick more than a hundred so this is perfect and we add column at the end and as you guys can see because i added columns if i press enter it goes directly under the x but if i don't add crawl limbs like this it goes at the beginning this is how you can know if you're forming a correct loop or not it should be underneath the axe okay next we're going to be um just typing how wide we want it to be and i'm just going to type you know circle just ax for now and press enter and this is now we're going to choose the angle so because this is a circle i don't recommend to use a 90 degrees maybe use a 60 how about 60 i think that would be good left okay and 60 degrees just like that and press enter and now we have to save it because if you don't save it we don't have a chance to see a result i'm going to save it on my desk um i'll just save it on my desktop for now and save it as circle spiral circle dot spiral it's not necessary to put a dot but i just like to put it for fun okay let's save it and here it is it automatically saves it on my desktop and as you can see i never added dot py but python adds just so we know that the file is for python py python okay now let's run it my favorite part of the this all of graphics we have to press run and run module hmm so starting out really really small and tiny don't you think we should make it a little bit fast just so we can see the results quickly all right let me to make it as fast as you want underneath the turtle.pen just press enter and write t dot speed zero zero just for as fast as it can that's what it's mean and we're gonna file and save right and run you guys can see it shows also real start whoa that is really cool wow doesn't that look amazing this is what i love about python you can create magical stuff within a few codes i hope you guys enjoyed this as much as i did and make sure to join our family by subscribing and liking this video as well as turning the notification bell on to get notified every time we upload a new video and if you want a shout out for your channel if you're new to python or to um if you have a new youtube channel and you want it to grow then make sure to comment down below if you want a shout out and we'll be happy to give it to you in our next video and that's it for today's video guys keep programming and i'll see you guys next time on programming kids bye for now
