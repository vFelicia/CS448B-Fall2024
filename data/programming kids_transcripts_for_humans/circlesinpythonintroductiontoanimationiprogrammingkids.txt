00:05 - hello everyone and welcome to
00:07 - programming kids
00:08 - my name is lynn and in today's video
00:10 - i'll be giving you guys an introduction
00:12 - to circles in python
00:14 - in our last videos we learned a lot
00:17 - about
00:18 - general information about programming
00:21 - language python
00:22 - variables facts and
00:25 - um we also learned how to draw plenty of
00:28 - graphics control link in the description
00:30 - box
00:32 - and now it's time for you guys to get
00:34 - ready for
00:35 - animations animation will probably have
00:37 - to be the best part about python
00:39 - creating your like a model or just
00:43 - drawing a girl or a panda or whatever
00:46 - you want can be the best part and the
00:48 - most fun part
00:50 - in order to do these you have to learn
00:53 - basic shapes like
00:54 - square circles triangles and more
00:58 - so in today's video as you guys
01:01 - might know we will be drawing circles
01:05 - and we will be going through three
01:07 - subheadings first
01:08 - a regular simple circle you will fill it
01:11 - with
01:12 - two of your favorite colors you will
01:14 - outline it with one
01:15 - and fill it with one then we will create
01:19 - a tangent circle
01:20 - and three we will create a spiral circle
01:24 - so what are you waiting for go grab a
01:26 - notebook or a cup of tea and
01:28 - let's get started first i will be
01:30 - opening idle by searching it on my
01:32 - pawley search
01:35 - i my role and press enter and it will
01:38 - automatically open
01:40 - then i'll be creating a new file by
01:42 - pressing file
01:44 - new file and here it is
01:47 - this is where i'll be doing my file
01:49 - program
01:50 - but first i have to name it just before
01:51 - i can identify easier
01:54 - so i'll name it as simple circle
01:58 - dot py because this is what our first
02:02 - program or code will be so
02:05 - we will be importing journal now
02:08 - importing turtle is
02:10 - just the main mini program in python for
02:13 - drawing right
02:14 - what is actually what actually happens
02:16 - is that when you import turtle
02:18 - python or idle opens the python launcher
02:22 - which is which just shows you the your
02:25 - code into real life
02:26 - so let's import it as you might tell
02:30 - nothing is happening and that's because
02:32 - we didn't run it if you do is on the
02:34 - python shell it might happen
02:36 - faster but on the
02:39 - uh the python file will help will just
02:42 - give you the flexibility to copy
02:44 - paste and do whatever you want on it
02:46 - okay
02:47 - now we will be naming our turtle if you
02:49 - want you can go ahead and name your
02:51 - your turtle anything but i will just
02:53 - stick with the t
02:55 - so t is equal to
02:58 - turtle dot
03:04 - and brackets oops
03:07 - okay and press enter if you try to run
03:10 - it right now
03:11 - you're going to have to save it and um
03:14 - i'll just save it on my desktop and i
03:17 - want to save it as
03:19 - circle
03:23 - and save and it saves over here so
03:27 - now that we pressed run it automatically
03:30 - runs it and this is turtle
03:32 - and if you guys want to this turtle to
03:35 - be an
03:35 - actual graphical turtle then make sure
03:38 - to comment that in the
03:39 - in the comment section and if you guys
03:42 - want to see it then i'll be happy to
03:44 - make it all you have to type is
03:46 - all you have to comment is make that
03:48 - video and i'll be happy to do that
03:51 - okay now we will uh get started with the
03:56 - coloring and the circle drawing and
03:58 - everything
03:59 - so first i just want to pick a color for
04:01 - my
04:02 - um circle so
04:05 - first i'll type t dot color
04:09 - and we will open the bracket
04:13 - to quotation marks and type your colors
04:15 - so i want python
04:16 - to um start
04:19 - like um i'm gonna choose two colors one
04:23 - is pink
04:24 - and the next one i want it to be like
04:27 - sky blue
04:28 - i think that would be really cool so
04:30 - i'll just type sky blue
04:32 - and let's see how smart is python do you
04:34 - think they'll get what
04:36 - is skype what does it mean or do you
04:37 - think they'll give us an error
04:39 - let's see anyways let's press enter and
04:43 - then we will have to
04:44 - just um choose a width for our circle
04:48 - so i was thinking of five you can try to
04:51 - make it as big as you want but i think
04:53 - five for me would be good so i'll just
04:56 - type 5
04:57 - and press enter then we i want my
05:00 - channel now to begin coloring my circle
05:03 - so
05:04 - i'll do that i'll type t dot begin
05:08 - underscore fill and
05:12 - open the brackets then the reason that
05:15 - we put an underscore over here because
05:17 - beginfill is actually a variable and
05:19 - python does not understand
05:22 - i won't understand what what is it if
05:25 - you don't put an underscore if you want
05:26 - to know more about variables make sure
05:28 - to check
05:29 - our video which will be linked in the
05:31 - description box
05:32 - and now i want to type my radius so i
05:36 - was thinking maybe i could do a hundred
05:40 - maybe that would be good not too big not
05:42 - too small
05:43 - and we will end the fill over here
05:45 - because there is nothing more
05:47 - and underscore fill again is a variable
05:51 - and here we go now we're going to have
05:53 - to save it so
05:54 - file save and now we can run it
05:59 - here we go
06:03 - wow i love that color whoa isn't that
06:07 - really cool guys
06:08 - i really love how the blue color is
06:11 - actually sky blue
06:12 - this is how smart python is you can tell
06:14 - them the name of any color that you want
06:16 - and they'll make it for you
06:19 - how about we experiment a little bit
06:21 - more what if i want the width to be
06:24 - 50 this time and the circle
06:29 - um radius maybe like a 150
06:33 - let's save and run save and run
06:40 - whoa that is so
06:43 - cool don't you think so this is really
06:46 - thick that reminds me of a donut
06:48 - if you make it maybe thicker it might
06:50 - look like a donut let's try
06:53 - so maybe make the width more like 150
06:56 - no maybe 100 actually and
06:59 - save it and run
07:04 - let's see oh i love that pink color
07:08 - don't you think so
07:10 - wow isn't that cool okay
07:13 - now let's move on to our next heading
07:15 - which will be at tangent circle i'm
07:17 - really excited for this
07:19 - so i'm just gonna exit this
07:22 - and as you guys can see we can always
07:24 - come back to this because we saved it on
07:26 - our desktop
07:27 - you can open it and here it is and run
07:29 - it whenever you want time for us to move
07:31 - the next program our next program will
07:33 - be a change in circle
07:34 - so let's open idle again press
07:37 - enter and it will open and i will be
07:39 - creating a new file
07:41 - and i'll name it so i think i'll name it
07:44 - um justine dot py okay so hashtag
07:49 - tangent dot p y
07:54 - and then i'll import the turtle
07:59 - and press enter again and name my turtle
08:01 - so i'll just name it as t
08:03 - because i'm just used to that and type
08:05 - turtle
08:07 - dot turtle and just
08:10 - open up the brackets and press enter
08:14 - then i'll start my loop so i'll just
08:16 - type it in
08:19 - for x in range i want the range to be 10
08:22 - and x is unknown okay
08:26 - and add the colon just so we inform
08:29 - python that this
08:30 - is over here this is a loop
08:33 - okay and
08:37 - i will be typing t dot circle
08:41 - this is how much how many times i want
08:44 - python to repeat this so
08:47 - 10 10
08:52 - times
08:55 - x okay and let's close the brackets
08:58 - and here we go
09:03 - let's run it
09:06 - first we will save it
09:09 - and i'll just save it on my desktop just
09:12 - beside
09:13 - the first one add tangent save it as
09:16 - team
09:18 - and save and
09:21 - here it is okay let's run
09:25 - and let's see if this works
09:29 - whoa that is really cool
09:33 - there are multiple of circles forming
09:35 - each with a different radius
09:38 - python is really smart
09:42 - whoa this is pretty cool to me
09:50 - okay this was such an easy code
09:53 - for um the tangent community is probably
09:57 - one of my favorites
09:58 - it's short and it's easy
10:01 - and it's fun let's move on to the next
10:06 - and final program
10:11 - now it's time for us to do the final
10:13 - program which is
10:14 - pirate circle let's just search idle
10:18 - again
10:20 - and press enter will open and i'll have
10:23 - to create a new file
10:25 - and name it so i'll just name it spyro
10:29 - hashtag spyro and press
10:34 - dot py okay and we'll press enter and
10:37 - i'll import my journal
10:41 - and name it so i'll name it again to see
10:44 - it
10:47 - is equal to turtle
10:52 - dot turtle
10:58 - whoops
11:00 - oh what's wrong with me
11:04 - okay finally turn them properly right
11:06 - now and don't forget to put your bracket
11:08 - and press enter okay now we will have to
11:12 - create a loop again and this time
11:14 - 4x in range
11:19 - 100 so let's open a bracket
11:24 - and oh all right
11:27 - 100 and close
11:31 - put your um colons
11:35 - to tell python this is a loop and we
11:37 - will type
11:38 - t dot circle open the bracket
11:42 - i want to type how many times i want
11:45 - python to repeat
11:46 - so i wanted to repeat it 10 times so 10
11:50 - plus this time so the plus sign
11:53 - plus x they will put a comma because now
11:57 - i have to
11:58 - choose my angle and i just want us to go
12:00 - for 45 i think 45 oh maybe
12:03 - maybe 65 that would be more interesting
12:05 - and let's press enter
12:08 - and nothing to fear off let's run
12:11 - this module but before we do that let's
12:13 - save it first
12:14 - now let's save it
12:18 - again on my desktop
12:21 - and just as spiral
12:26 - and save and let's run it the most
12:29 - interesting part
12:32 - it's drawing a circle a circle a circle
12:36 - that is really cool
12:40 - whoa
12:44 - i really love circles they make me
12:47 - dizzy but they're really fun
12:55 - wow
12:58 - isn't don't you think that's cool
13:02 - oh i'm getting dizzy
13:09 - whoa well guys circles are really fun
13:14 - and i'm pretty sure there will be more
13:16 - graphics coming up
13:18 - so if you want to see that make sure to
13:20 - subscribe
13:21 - and if you want to be one of the first
13:23 - people to see my videos
13:25 - then turn that notification bell on and
13:28 - like this video if you love circles and
13:31 - you love coding and
13:34 - i'll see you guys next time on
13:36 - programming kids keep programming
13:39 - [Music]
13:46 - bye

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone and welcome to programming kids my name is lynn and in today's video i'll be giving you guys an introduction to circles in python in our last videos we learned a lot about general information about programming language python variables facts and um we also learned how to draw plenty of graphics control link in the description box and now it's time for you guys to get ready for animations animation will probably have to be the best part about python creating your like a model or just drawing a girl or a panda or whatever you want can be the best part and the most fun part in order to do these you have to learn basic shapes like square circles triangles and more so in today's video as you guys might know we will be drawing circles and we will be going through three subheadings first a regular simple circle you will fill it with two of your favorite colors you will outline it with one and fill it with one then we will create a tangent circle and three we will create a spiral circle so what are you waiting for go grab a notebook or a cup of tea and let's get started first i will be opening idle by searching it on my pawley search i my role and press enter and it will automatically open then i'll be creating a new file by pressing file new file and here it is this is where i'll be doing my file program but first i have to name it just before i can identify easier so i'll name it as simple circle dot py because this is what our first program or code will be so we will be importing journal now importing turtle is just the main mini program in

let's import it as you might tell nothing is happening and that's because we didn't run it if you do is on the python shell it might happen faster but on the uh the python file will help will just give you the flexibility to copy paste and do whatever you want on it okay now we will be naming our turtle if you want you can go ahead and name your your turtle anything but i will just stick with the t so t is equal to turtle dot and brackets oops okay and press enter if you try to run it right now you're going to have to save it and um i'll just save it on my desktop and i want to save it as circle and save and it saves over here so now that we pressed run it automatically runs it and this is turtle and if you guys want to this turtle to be an actual graphical turtle then make sure to comment that in the in the comment section and if you guys want to see it then i'll be happy to make it all you have to type is all you have to comment is make that video and i'll be happy to do that okay now we will uh get started with the coloring and the circle drawing and everything so first i just want to pick a color for my um circle so first i'll type t dot color and we will open the bracket to quotation marks and type your colors so i want python to um start like um i'm gonna choose two colors one is pink and the next one i want it to be like sky blue i think that would be really

enter then we i want my channel now to begin coloring my circle so i'll do that i'll type t dot begin underscore fill and open the brackets then the reason that we put an underscore over here because beginfill is actually a variable and python does not understand i won't understand what what is it if you don't put an underscore if you want to know more about variables make sure to check our video which will be linked in the description box and now i want to type my radius so i was thinking maybe i could do a hundred maybe that would be good not too big not too small and we will end the fill over here because there is nothing more and underscore fill again is a variable and here we go now we're going to have to save it so file save and now we can run it here we go wow i love that color whoa isn't that really cool guys i really love how the blue color is actually sky blue this is how smart python is you can tell them the name of any color that you want and they'll make it for you how about we experiment a little bit more what if i want the width to be 50 this time and the circle um radius maybe like a 150 let's save and run save and run whoa that is so cool don't you think so this is really thick that reminds me of a donut if you make it maybe thicker it might look like a donut let's try so maybe make the width more like 150 no maybe 100 actually and save it and run let's see oh i love that pink color don't you think so wow isn't that cool okay now let's move on to our next heading which will be at tangent circle i'm really excited for this so i'm just gonna exit this and as you guys can see we can always come back to this because we saved it on our desktop you can open it and here it is and run it whenever you want time for us to move the next program our next program

create a loop again and this time 4x in range 100 so let's open a bracket and oh all right 100 and close put your um colons to tell python this is a loop and we will type t dot circle open the bracket i want to type how many times i want python to repeat so i wanted to repeat it 10 times so 10 plus this time so the plus sign plus x they will put a comma because now i have to choose my angle and i just want us to go for 45 i think 45 oh maybe maybe 65 that would be more interesting and let's press enter and nothing to fear off let's run this module but before we do that let's save it first now let's save it again on my desktop and just as spiral and save and let's run it the most interesting part it's drawing a circle a circle a circle that is really cool whoa i really love circles they make me dizzy but they're really fun wow isn't don't you think that's cool oh i'm getting dizzy whoa well guys circles are really fun and i'm pretty sure there will be more graphics coming up so if you want to see that make sure to subscribe and if you want to be one of the first people to see my videos then turn that notification bell on and like this video if you love circles and you love coding and i'll see you guys next time on programming kids keep programming bye
