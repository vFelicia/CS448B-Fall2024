00:00 - welcome to know your node this is a
00:02 - series of video game engine videos where
00:04 - we take a single node type and show how
00:06 - it's used maybe you never came across
00:08 - this particular node before and maybe
00:10 - you were just wondering what it's for
00:12 - but hopefully after this you'll have a
00:13 - new tool that you can use in making your
00:16 - own games this installment will be
00:18 - really short and sweet because we're
00:19 - talking about one of the simplest nodes
00:21 - there is the Y sort node so here we have
00:25 - a really common situation I've got a
00:27 - bunch of NPC sprites that I've made 12
00:30 - instances of and they just are walking
00:32 - around the map but it looks really
00:34 - unnatural when they cross in front of
00:37 - each other because the draw order they
00:40 - were always correct the draw order is
00:44 - just the order that they're listed here
00:47 - in the scene but for example when a
00:51 - sprite like that right there when the
00:52 - sprite is higher than another one it's
00:55 - you know has a lower Y value it should
00:59 - look like it's behind it by its feet
01:00 - should be on top of the other ones head
01:02 - and so what what you want to do is make
01:07 - a draw order respect the y coordinate of
01:10 - the sprite and draw it farther back the
01:15 - higher it gets and you could do that
01:17 - incurred and it's a really common
01:19 - situation you need to do if you don't
01:21 - have a great node already set up for you
01:25 - to use that and I have it right here
01:27 - and that's other scene called the Y
01:30 - sword and it couldn't be simpler
01:32 - why sort node has exactly one property
01:36 - enabled that you want to be on or not
01:38 - and I've just taken all these NPC's and
01:41 - I've made them children Y sort that's it
01:46 - no more configuration nothing else but
01:49 - if I run the scene you will see that
01:51 - none of that weird drawing happens
01:55 - whenever a sprite goes is above another
01:57 - one it's automatically behind it and
02:03 - that's it use this node it's your friend
02:07 - all right I'll see you next time
02:09 - you
02:16 - you
