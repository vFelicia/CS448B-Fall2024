00:00 - welcome back to the top-down tank battle
00:02 - tutorial game in this installment we're
00:06 - going to take our title screen we made
00:08 - in the last video and we're going to
00:10 - connect it up so that our game can and
00:13 - restart and transition between levels
00:17 - and this is part of kind of wrapping
00:21 - this game up I don't want this to become
00:24 - too complex a project because my goal
00:26 - was that it would be more of a starting
00:30 - point or a framework for everyone who's
00:34 - watching to get an idea of how to start
00:36 - building things but leave it generic
00:39 - enough that you can extend it yourself
00:41 - and add more and more things to it so I
00:44 - that's why I haven't done a lot of
00:45 - special effects on there I haven't made
00:48 - the tanks too complex with an upgrade
00:52 - path or different kinds of
00:55 - functionalities so hopefully that it's
00:58 - been helpful to you that way and perhaps
01:01 - in another future project we'll talk
01:03 - about how to do some of those additional
01:06 - extensions alright so let's get into the
01:09 - code so first we're going to add some
01:12 - code to our Global's script our autoload
01:16 - script that has data in it that's going
01:19 - to persist between screens so we're
01:21 - gonna make a variable called current
01:23 - level that's going to be keeping track
01:26 - of what level we're on in the game once
01:28 - we make multiple maps where you can
01:30 - transition from level to level we'll
01:32 - start on a little zero which is the
01:33 - title screen then I'm gonna make a list
01:37 - of levels and this is just gonna be a
01:40 - simple way to map what the order of the
01:44 - scenes is alright the first scene we
01:46 - want to go to is the title screen that's
01:50 - the first one and then when you leave
01:53 - the title screen you're gonna go to the
01:54 - first map so I'm going to throw that in
01:56 - there and then we would extend this
01:59 - array longer if we had a sequence of
02:02 - maps to go through
02:07 - so we're gonna add a function here
02:09 - called restart this is going to be
02:11 - called when we want to restart the game
02:13 - start everything all over again right we
02:15 - set current level zero and we're gonna
02:19 - change scene two whatever levels current
02:28 - level is and that's going to send us to
02:36 - levels zero which is the title screen
02:39 - but we also want to be able to
02:41 - transition so we're gonna make a next
02:46 - level function that's just going to
02:50 - increment our current level and if that
02:56 - is less enter levels dot size right we
03:00 - obviously can't advance to a level that
03:03 - doesn't exist then we're going to get
03:06 - tree change scene actually we're gonna
03:09 - just copy and paste this otherwise we're
03:16 - gonna just call restart so if we got to
03:19 - the end of the game we're just gonna go
03:20 - to the title screen and this is all we
03:24 - needed to do right now for our simple
03:27 - restart functionality you know more
03:29 - complex game you might have each map
03:33 - have a property called next level where
03:35 - the map tells you what its next level it
03:37 - goes to or potentially more than one if
03:40 - it has multiple exits things like that
03:41 - but that's a really just an extension of
03:44 - this and I want to keep it simple for
03:46 - for now alright so now we can go to the
03:51 - title screen scene and we're going to we
03:58 - need to capture pressing the spacebar so
04:00 - that they can start playing so we're
04:03 - going to add a script to the title
04:04 - screen
04:08 - and this script is going to just check
04:14 - for input we want action pressed UI
04:23 - select is the spacebar action then we're
04:28 - going to take Global's
04:30 - and call next level and that's it now we
04:36 - could actually check this if we play
04:38 - let's select the title screen as our
04:41 - main scene and when I press space it
04:45 - goes into the main level now we need to
04:51 - do something when the player dies all
04:54 - right because when the player dies we
04:55 - want the game to end so we have on the
05:00 - player if I open up the map scene here
05:02 - we have on the player its signals we
05:06 - have a dead signal and we're calling on
05:09 - player dead were reloading the current
05:12 - scene and instead we could call our
05:16 - restart function that we made in
05:18 - Global's so now let's check this out
05:24 - when I die and get in front of the
05:31 - missiles when I die I'm back to the
05:34 - title screen and I can play again ok so
05:39 - now we have our basic functionality for
05:41 - our title screen working and our game
05:43 - restart
05:51 - you

welcome back to the topdown tank battle tutorial game in this installment we're going to take our title screen we made in the last video and we're going to connect it up so that our game can and restart and transition between levels and this is part of kind of wrapping this game up I don't want this to become too complex a project because my goal was that it would be more of a starting point or a framework for everyone who's watching to get an idea of how to start building things but leave it generic enough that you can extend it yourself and add more and more things to it so I that's why I haven't done a lot of special effects on there I haven't made the tanks too complex with an upgrade path or different kinds of functionalities so hopefully that it's been helpful to you that way and perhaps in another future project we'll talk about how to do some of those additional extensions alright so let's get into the code so first we're going to add some code to our Global's script our autoload script that has data in it that's going to persist between screens so we're gonna make a variable called current level that's going to be keeping track of what level we're on in the game once we make multiple maps where you can transition from level to level we'll start on a little zero which is the title screen then I'm gonna make a list of levels and this is just gonna be a simple way to map what the order of the scenes is alright the first scene we want to go to is the title screen that's the first one and then when you leave the title screen you're gonna go to the first map so I'm going to throw that in there and then we would extend this array longer if we had a sequence of maps to go through so we're gonna add a function here called restart this is going to be called when we want to restart the game start everything all over again right we set current level zero and we're gonna change scene two whatever levels current level is and that's going to send us to levels zero which is the title screen but we also want to be able to transition so we're gonna make a next level function that's just going to increment our current level and if that is less enter levels dot size right we obviously can't advance to a level that doesn't exist then we're going to get tree change scene actually we're gonna just copy and paste this otherwise we're gonna just call restart so if we got to the end of the game we're just gonna go to the title screen and this is all we needed to do right now for our simple restart functionality you know more complex game you might have each map have a property called next level where the map tells you what its next level it goes to or potentially more than one if it has multiple exits things like that but that's a really just an extension of this and I want to keep it simple for for now alright so now we can go to the title screen scene and we're going to we need to capture pressing the spacebar so that they can start playing so we're going to add a script to the title screen and this script is going to just check for input we want action pressed UI select is the spacebar action then we're going to take Global's and call next level and that's it now we could actually check this if we play let's select the title screen as our main scene and when I press space it goes into the main level now we need to do something when the player dies all right because when the player dies we want the game to end so we have on the player if I open up the map scene here we have on the player its signals we have a dead signal and we're calling on player dead were reloading the current scene and instead we could call our restart function that we made in Global's so now let's check this out when I die and get in front of the missiles when I die I'm back to the title screen and I can play again ok so now we have our basic functionality for our title screen working and our game restart you
