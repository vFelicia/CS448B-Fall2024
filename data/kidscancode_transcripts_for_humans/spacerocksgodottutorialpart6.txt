00:00 - welcome back to space rocks the go-to
00:02 - game engine series where we're making a
00:04 - asteroids cloud in the last part we did
00:09 - work on making them asteroids explode
00:12 - when we hit them and split into smaller
00:14 - ones and so this time we're going to add
00:16 - some nice-looking explosion and sound
00:19 - effects to our asteroids okay now that
00:25 - we are shooting asteroids we want to add
00:28 - two nice looking explosions so I'm going
00:31 - to make a new scene flood that and we're
00:36 - going to use an animated sprite we
00:41 - handle this and I've added some art in
00:43 - here of an explosion of the eight frames
00:48 - of animation so make a new right frames
00:55 - I'm going to call this the regular
00:58 - explosion this is the normal sized one
01:03 - maybe we'll add some different sizes for
01:06 - the different sized explosions I started
01:09 - for the different sized asteroids after
01:15 - there we go okay for this one I think
01:21 - the FPS we have about ten we want the
01:26 - loop to be off I don't want it to repeat
01:30 - let's see we're going to start on zero
01:33 - it's not playing like it's playing to
01:35 - see it run through once that's all we
01:40 - need all right let's just name this
01:45 - explosion and save it in the scenes
01:51 - folder and add a script all right all
01:57 - we're going to do here with this script
01:59 - really we don't even need the ready
02:00 - function because what we're going to do
02:02 - is attach the event for finished
02:08 - I'm going to connect that and we're just
02:12 - going to say when it's finished we'll
02:16 - delete it so when we spawn one of these
02:18 - it's going to play out and then it's
02:20 - going to disappear now on our main we
02:23 - just want to instance one of these
02:24 - whenever we blow them and afterwards so
02:29 - explosion we're going to preload that
02:40 - and then down here is where we explode
02:47 - the asteroid so we just need to create
02:52 - an instance of this we need to add it as
02:58 - a child we need to set its position to
03:05 - position of B that's where we exploded
03:08 - and then we just need to tell it to play
03:11 - and that should be that let's go over
03:18 - here and shoot this guy comes on to the
03:21 - screen a little slow I think I'm gonna
03:29 - adjust to be speed a little bit maybe
03:35 - twelve things per second
03:42 - that'll be a little better yeah okay
03:48 - looking much nicer all right let's get
03:53 - some sound in here now so we're going to
03:55 - go to the players scene and we're going
03:57 - to add a sample player sample player
04:03 - with the little speaker icon next to it
04:05 - this is going to be the shoot shoot
04:09 - sounds and we have a little warning here
04:13 - because it needs a sample library well
04:17 - right here samples no we're going to
04:20 - make a new library go over here and add
04:24 - some stuff so in the audio folder I have
04:27 - some different wav files I'm going to
04:30 - use laser one and laser two these are
04:37 - one sound like this plays the two sounds
04:40 - like this so I have some options on how
04:45 - we can you know make our lasers sound as
04:47 - we have upgrades and things like that so
04:56 - playing a sound is super easy in your
04:59 - code you just have to tell it when you
05:02 - want to happen go over to our player
05:04 - script and let's get that node
05:18 - and we're going to use that down in our
05:21 - shoot function I'm shoot function here
05:25 - fires off when we are able to shoot so
05:33 - we're just going to say put this on the
05:38 - end shoot sound dot play and then you
05:45 - just put the name of the sound that you
05:51 - want to play actually I think I want to
05:54 - for this one and that should be it there
06:04 - go much gutter you know we just need to
06:07 - get a sound happening during explosion
06:10 - and we're going to do it the exact same
06:11 - way
06:12 - we're gets to in main I have just made
06:14 - another sample player called explosion
06:16 - sound expl sounds and I'm just playing
06:20 - explosion number one I've got three
06:22 - explosion sounds in here now which we
06:26 - could use for different things or even
06:28 - randomize but I'm giving it simple right
06:30 - now
06:31 - you know later we could even go in and
06:34 - make different explosions here that are
06:37 - named the same as the sizes right so big
06:40 - medium small and tiny and then have
06:43 - matching sounds so we would play and we
06:46 - would just use the size variable here to
06:49 - play the matching one and we can do that
06:51 - at some point but I'm not really really
06:53 - ready to do that yet this is good enough
06:55 - for us to be able to have a little bit
07:01 - of feedback it will fill up okay and
07:09 - finally we're going to do some music by
07:14 - adding a stream player node stream
07:20 - players what you use for background
07:21 - music because it just plays doesn't load
07:24 - the whole music file which might be a
07:27 - big song
07:28 - something like that and it streams it as
07:31 - it goes and just plays it in the
07:33 - background on its own thread and that is
07:35 - what we want so you need something in
07:38 - the stream property right and I happen
07:43 - to have an auxiliary and game art that
07:48 - works pretty well we put that in in
07:50 - there and we just have to tell it to
07:52 - play when we start the new game and so
07:57 - in our I'm just going to put this in our
07:59 - ready I'm just going to say get node
08:04 - music dot play that's all we have to do
08:14 - we go we have some background music and
08:17 - sound it back okay I'm going to get fun
08:22 - now in the next video I want to do some
08:26 - more work on the player and say I want
08:29 - to add a couple things here I'm going to
08:31 - add a sprite it's going to be our shield
08:38 - around the player ship because we have a
08:41 - nice shield graphic from our sprite
08:44 - sheet here there's actually where the
08:53 - there's there's actually three levels of
08:56 - shield I'm just going to grab the full
08:58 - one here and we need to resize that
09:01 - because just like we've scaled the ship
09:03 - to point 6 we're going to want to scale
09:06 - the shield the same I actually might
09:12 - make it even a little smaller yeah so it
09:17 - looks like it's around the ship and so
09:21 - the shield is going to just be the
09:23 - visual indication that we have our
09:25 - shields on and we'll be if we can just
09:29 - hide and show it the to make it look
09:31 - like this ship has a shield up shield
09:34 - down
09:36 - it's also pretty boring when we're
09:38 - flying around and so I'm going to add a
09:41 - little animated sprite here and this is
09:46 - going to be the exhaust from the ship's
09:49 - engine that is going to have a couple of
09:54 - frames in and one we're going to use our
09:59 - there's a bunch of different animations
10:01 - for different kinds of exhaust in here
10:05 - let's plow all-beef ones so we're just
10:08 - going to grab one of these blue ones
10:09 - here this one and we got this one and we
10:18 - need to move those down a bit take the
10:24 - position of the exhaust and I'm going to
10:28 - shift it let's see 30 a little more 35
10:35 - yeah so it looks like it's coming out
10:37 - the back of the sniffs I'm going to put
10:40 - playing alright using about that it's
10:45 - going to look like not quite what I
10:50 - wanted
10:53 - let's try this other one
11:03 - yeah it looks like kind of like it's
11:05 - pulsing okay so we want that to be on
11:10 - when we're thrusting and off when we're
11:12 - not so we're just going to add into our
11:14 - code to turn it to show and hide it
11:16 - right just set it to visible or not
11:18 - visible which is our can be a little
11:23 - property right here so we already have
11:26 - here in our script where we're thrusting
11:30 - or not thrusting and so this is where we
11:33 - just want to set that property to so
11:34 - we're going to say get node exhaust and
11:41 - we're going to if we're trusting we're
11:44 - going to set grants a show and then do
11:51 - the same thing take the same line and
11:57 - we're going to duplicate here and put
11:59 - hide and now when we want to when we
12:06 - thrust we have a little fire coming out
12:09 - the back and when we let go of the key
12:11 - it's not there okay give the ship a
12:15 - little bit more personality as always
12:19 - thanks for watching I hope you're
12:20 - enjoying this series and I will see you
12:22 - in the next video
12:31 - you

feedback it will fill up okay and finally we're going to do some music by adding a stream player node stream players what you use for background music because it just plays doesn't load the whole music file which might be a big song something like that and it streams it as it goes and just plays it in the background on its own thread and that is what we want so you need something in the stream property right and I happen to have an auxiliary and game art that works pretty well we put that in in there and we just have to tell it to play when we start the new game and so in our I'm just going to put this in our ready I'm just going to say get node music dot play that's all we have to do we go we have some background music and sound it back okay I'm going to get fun now in the next video I want to do some more work on the player and say I want to add a couple things here I'm going to add a sprite it's going to be our shield around the player ship because we have a nice shield graphic
