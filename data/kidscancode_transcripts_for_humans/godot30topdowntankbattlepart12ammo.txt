00:00 - welcome to part 12 of the top-down tank
00:03 - battle tutorial for Godot 3.0 this time
00:06 - we're going to talk about ammo we have
00:10 - added a pickup item that can restore
00:13 - health to our tank repair the damage and
00:16 - now we're gonna add limited ammo so that
00:19 - we can give our player the sense of
00:23 - urgency they've got to conserve their
00:24 - ammo they gotta find Emma crates to
00:26 - restore their ammo alright let's get
00:28 - started
00:28 - previously we made the health pickups so
00:31 - that we could recover some armor when
00:34 - we've been damaged and this time I want
00:36 - to add a different type of pickup that
00:38 - will give us ammo so that it's possible
00:41 - for us to give the player limited ammo
00:43 - and they have to go pick up crates to
00:45 - restore it now to do that we're gonna go
00:48 - over to our first over to our pickup
00:50 - object that we made and in the script we
00:54 - already made an enumerator listing the
00:57 - health and ammo types and so that means
01:01 - that all we need to do is make those
01:05 - both work so I want to use a different
01:09 - texture because you know when we when we
01:12 - run the game we have the little repair
01:17 - wrench hovering above the crate to let
01:19 - us know that's a repair crate so I want
01:22 - to equivalent ammo icon above the ammo
01:26 - crates so that means I'm going to need
01:29 - to load some different images into that
01:32 - icon sprite and we can list those in the
01:38 - code here and load the one we need
01:41 - depending on which one reload and so I'm
01:45 - gonna use in my assets folder I've got
01:50 - my wrench that's the one we were using
01:53 - for the health and then on the next line
01:57 - we will reload the ammo bullet icon so
02:04 - that we know that's what that one is
02:08 - okay so I have two icons and I listed
02:13 - them in this order so that you know
02:15 - health will be zero and that will match
02:18 - the that will match the first one it's
02:21 - the wrench and mo is the second one
02:23 - which would matches the second one and I
02:26 - forgot my equal sign here alright so we
02:31 - have our two images loaded and then in
02:34 - the ready we're just gonna set whichever
02:38 - one is appropriate for what we've chosen
02:42 - and so we'll set the icon texture equal
02:46 - to icon textures type so so now we can
02:55 - choose over here which type we want
02:57 - health or ammo and it'll choose the
03:00 - appropriate icon and then in the pick up
03:05 - we're doing nothing if you pick up a an
03:07 - ammo one so instead what we want to do
03:11 - is the body that picked it up we
03:14 - increase its ammo and this is gonna be
03:18 - the same I'm gonna include the same R
03:22 - and range so that we can have the option
03:29 - of making it random between two values
03:34 - we could also set this to 10 comma 11
03:37 - here and we'd be sure that you know it's
03:40 - always gonna give back 10 mo but that's
03:42 - okay for now so we're gonna so now we're
03:45 - we have our pickup item set up and ready
03:49 - to go for ammo we need to add ammo to
03:52 - the player tank okay here's our tank
03:54 - script and we're gonna add a signal just
03:57 - like we send out a signal when the
03:59 - health changed we want to send a signal
04:01 - out when the ammo change so that we can
04:04 - have the UI update and display the an
04:09 - accurate value for what our ammo is and
04:12 - then we're going to have a couple of new
04:16 - variables here so first we're going to
04:19 - have a
04:21 - max ammo that's how much how many shots
04:28 - it has that's the the maximum so when
04:30 - you are down that's how much you'll come
04:33 - back up to when you pick up a crate and
04:36 - we'll export that so that we can set
04:38 - that to whatever value we want and then
04:42 - we also need a variable that's going to
04:43 - track our current ammo how much we are
04:45 - currently holding and I'm going to use a
04:48 - negative one so that we can indicate
04:52 - negative one if it has negative one ammo
04:54 - that means it has infinite ammo that's
04:56 - the situation we're in right now where
04:58 - they can just unlimited unlimited ammo
05:00 - then keep firing remember this is the
05:02 - tank script this is inherited by our
05:04 - player and our enemies so this way what
05:07 - we can do is have the enemies stick with
05:09 - negative one they have unlimited ammo
05:11 - and then we can set this to some value
05:14 - say 10 for example for the player and
05:16 - then they will only have 10 shots and
05:19 - then when this whenever this changes
05:22 - we're going to use a setter function
05:25 - called set ammo to update it and have it
05:28 - change I have it do a couple of things
05:31 - whenever we pick up or use ammo let's
05:36 - see so in the ready we're gonna need two
05:38 - just like we did with the health we're
05:40 - gonna need to emit that signal the ammo
05:44 - change signal and what we're going to
05:46 - send out is ammo times 100 over a max
05:50 - ammo so we just send out the percentage
05:56 - of ammo we have left so that we can set
05:58 - the HUD to display that now in our shoot
06:04 - function we want to only allow you to
06:06 - shoot if you have ammo so if you if your
06:10 - can shoot flag is true then your gun
06:14 - cooldown has run out and that's okay but
06:17 - we also need to have ammo so if your
06:19 - ammo is not equal to zero so if you have
06:22 - a negative one you're fine and if you
06:24 - have a number greater than zero you're
06:27 - fine and we subtract one we subtract one
06:33 - from
06:35 - ammo so now every time you shoot we're
06:38 - gonna subtract one and yeah for the
06:40 - enemy tanks that's good means it's gonna
06:42 - be negative two negative three negative
06:43 - four or they're gonna keep going down
06:45 - and down every time they shoot but
06:47 - whatever I mean they're they're not
06:49 - going to shoot billions of times it's
06:52 - just gonna be an integer it doesn't
06:55 - really matter what size the integer is
07:00 - we could even use that for stats later
07:03 - we know how many times the enemy tanks
07:05 - shot might be interesting and we'll
07:09 - think about that later but that's good
07:10 - enough for now and then finally we're
07:13 - going to write that set ammo set our
07:17 - function so set ammo value so when we
07:25 - change our ammo that reminds me we're
07:28 - doing this locally so we have to say
07:32 - self dot ammo so that when we change
07:36 - this value it will call this function if
07:40 - the value is greater than the max ammo
07:45 - then the value equals max ammo yeah so
07:51 - then we cap it there we clamp it to that
07:54 - value set it and name it the signal and
08:01 - actually I can go back up here we're
08:03 - just gonna admit that same signal I
08:05 - admit that ammo change signal also when
08:10 - we set the ammo all right so that means
08:15 - now that we have all this code editing
08:17 - here if we go over to the player we will
08:22 - now have a max ammo in an ammo field and
08:24 - we can set this to 10 for example now my
08:28 - player has 10 shots so I should be able
08:32 - to fire 10 times 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and
08:41 - now I can't shoot anymore
08:42 - my ammo has depleted so that's working
08:47 - now we just need to worry about the
08:49 - why so that we can see how much ammo we
08:52 - have so for the HUD I've gone ahead and
08:56 - added a node here so I added a vertical
08:59 - separator just to give some space
09:02 - between these two and I'm using a
09:05 - texture progress just like we used for
09:07 - the bar the health bar except this time
09:11 - I'm setting it to clockwise instead of
09:14 - left to right which means it's going to
09:16 - do a circular progress bar and I'm using
09:20 - this I'm just using this white circular
09:23 - texture for now because again I think I
09:26 - think I said this one we did the health
09:28 - bar we're gonna do we're gonna come back
09:31 - and redo the graphics for this UI
09:33 - because I'm sort of grabbing grabbing
09:35 - pieces from here or there wherever I
09:37 - find them just to sort of build it for
09:39 - now and we can swap in some other
09:42 - textures when we get something that when
09:44 - we have a good idea of exactly all the
09:46 - pieces that we've placed and where we
09:48 - have them and and make them look like a
09:50 - more coherent whole so but so I have a
09:54 - circular texture progress and I've set
09:57 - the filled degrees to 180 that means
09:59 - it's not gonna fill all the way around
10:00 - the whole circle it's only gonna use 180
10:03 - of it which means so that for example if
10:05 - my value is set to 60% right now you see
10:10 - where the you see where the percentage
10:14 - is and if we were at 10% we'd be there
10:19 - 50% is halfway 100% is the full
10:22 - semicircle whatever we have it set to so
10:28 - that's going to just show us and that
10:29 - that will go down as we fire as we
10:33 - update the HUD so we need to go into our
10:35 - HUD script and add a function to update
10:39 - the ammo gauge just like we update the
10:43 - health bar so that is going to be here
10:48 - we'll say update ammo
10:52 - with whatever value we passed and we'll
10:57 - take the mo gauge dot value equals value
11:00 - and that's all we need to do there and
11:04 - then in our map we have the player's
11:11 - health changed linked to HUD we're also
11:15 - going to connect the connect it to the
11:19 - HUD update mo function all right so
11:33 - let's give that a try and we should see
11:38 - yeah see I said it I set Maximo to 20
11:40 - and the current mo is 10 so I'm 50% and
11:43 - you can see it going down oh and then we
11:47 - need to last little thing to test here
11:50 - let's make this mo create a or make this
11:56 - create an ammo pickup so we'll make that
11:58 - an ammo pickup and that should show us
12:01 - the right see it has the little bullet
12:05 - over it and if I go pick it up I am now
12:08 - at 20 shots and this is gonna give you
12:15 - some more flexibility with your ammo
12:16 - deserve sorry with your level design
12:18 - because you can you know make the ammo
12:22 - crates rare and then the player has to
12:24 - be really careful about what mo they use
12:27 - maybe the ammo crates are dropped by the
12:31 - enemy tanks when you blow them up so
12:33 - that's where you're gonna get your extra
12:35 - ammo from that kind of thing so it gives
12:38 - you some more flexibility and again you
12:39 - can just set the players ammo to
12:41 - negative 1 and you will have unlimited
12:46 - that'll do it for this episode I'll see
12:48 - you in the next one please feel free to
12:50 - comment in the comments below and let me
12:53 - know if you have anything in particular
12:54 - you'd like to see added to the game next
12:56 - there's a lot of different ways we could
12:58 - go from here so I'd love to hear your
13:01 - ideas
13:09 - you

Cleaned transcript:

welcome to part 12 of the topdown tank battle tutorial for Godot 3.0 this time we're going to talk about ammo we have added a pickup item that can restore health to our tank repair the damage and now we're gonna add limited ammo so that we can give our player the sense of urgency they've got to conserve their ammo they gotta find Emma crates to restore their ammo alright let's get started previously we made the health pickups so that we could recover some armor when we've been damaged and this time I want to add a different type of pickup that will give us ammo so that it's possible for us to give the player limited ammo and they have to go pick up crates to restore it now to do that we're gonna go over to our first over to our pickup object that we made and in the script we already made an enumerator listing the health and ammo types and so that means that all we need to do is make those both work so I want to use a different texture because you know when we when we run the game we have the little repair wrench hovering above the crate to let us know that's a repair crate so I want to equivalent ammo icon above the ammo crates so that means I'm going to need to load some different images into that icon sprite and we can list those in the code here and load the one we need depending on which one reload and so I'm gonna use in my assets folder I've got my wrench that's the one we were using for the health and then on the next line we will reload the ammo bullet icon so that we know that's what that one is okay so I have two icons and I listed them in this order so that you know health will be zero and that will match the that will match the first one it's the wrench and mo is the second one which would matches the second one and I forgot my equal sign here alright so we have our two images loaded and then in the ready we're just gonna set whichever one is appropriate for what we've chosen and so we'll set the icon texture equal to icon textures type so so now we can choose over here which type we want health or ammo and it'll choose the appropriate icon and then in the pick up we're doing nothing if you pick up a an ammo one so instead what we want to do is the body that picked it up we increase its ammo and this is gonna be the same I'm gonna include the same R and range so that we can have the option of making it random between two values we could also set this to 10 comma 11 here and we'd be sure that you know it's always gonna give back 10 mo but that's okay for now so we're gonna so now we're we have our pickup item set up and ready to go for ammo we need to add ammo to the player tank okay here's our tank script and we're gonna add a signal just like we send out a signal when the health changed we want to send a signal out when the ammo change so that we can have the UI update and display the an accurate value for what our ammo is and then we're going to have a couple of new variables here so first we're going to

set that to whatever value we want and then we also need a variable that's going to track our current ammo how much we are currently holding and I'm going to use a negative one so that we can indicate negative one if it has negative one ammo that means it has infinite ammo that's the situation we're in right now where they can just unlimited unlimited ammo then keep firing remember this is the tank script this is inherited by our player and our enemies so this way what we can do is have the enemies stick with negative one they have unlimited ammo and then we can set this to some value say 10 for example for the player and then they will only have 10 shots and then when this whenever this changes we're going to use a setter function called set ammo to update it and have it change I have it do a couple of things whenever we pick up or use ammo let's see so in the ready we're gonna need two just like we did with the health we're gonna need to emit that signal the ammo change signal and what we're going to send out is ammo times 100 over a max ammo so we just send out the percentage of ammo we have left so that we can set the HUD to display that now in our shoot function we want to only allow you to shoot if you have ammo so if you if your can shoot flag is true then your gun cooldown has run out and that's okay but we also need to have ammo so if your ammo is not equal to zero so if you have a negative one you're fine and if you have a number greater than zero you're fine and we subtract one we subtract one from ammo so now every time you shoot we're gonna subtract one and yeah for the enemy tanks that's good means it's gonna be negative two negative three negative four or they're gonna keep going down and down every time they shoot but whatever I mean they're they're not going to shoot billions of times it's just gonna be an integer it doesn't really matter what size the integer is we could even use that for stats later we know how many times the enemy tanks shot might be interesting and we'll think about that later but that's good enough for now and then finally we're going to write that set ammo set our function so set ammo value so when we change our ammo

next one please feel free to comment in the comments below and let me know if you have anything in particular you'd like to see added to the game next there's a lot of different ways we could go from here so I'd love to hear your ideas you
