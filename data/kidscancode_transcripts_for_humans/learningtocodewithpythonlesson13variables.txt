00:00 - hi welcome to learning to code with
00:02 - Python lesson 3 variables variables are
00:07 - a really important concept in
00:08 - programming variables like a label it's
00:11 - a shortcut for pointing at something
00:12 - that we want to save here are some
00:14 - examples so I've set apples equal to 10
00:22 - so now if I say print apples I see that
00:28 - apples now is equal to the number 10 if
00:31 - I want to change what apples points to I
00:34 - can say now make apples equal to 15 you
00:43 - can also store other things than numbers
00:45 - in a variable for example variables can
00:55 - be named just about anything you can
00:56 - think of it's usually a good idea to
00:58 - pick a name that makes it clear what the
01:00 - value means for example if we were
01:02 - making a game where your goal was to
01:04 - collect flowers that might be a good
01:05 - name for the variable like this if you
01:10 - name it bubbles then later when you want
01:12 - to print out the score you're going to
01:13 - be confused by why the number of flowers
01:15 - you've collected is called bubbles so
01:18 - now that we know what variables are
01:19 - let's talk about what kinds of things we
01:21 - can store in them information inside the
01:23 - computer is called data and there are
01:25 - lots of different types of data that the
01:27 - computer can remember let's start with
01:29 - numbers we've used those a few times
01:31 - already did you know you can use the
01:33 - Python shell like a calculator try this
01:36 - out we can add numbers you can subtract
01:42 - numbers we can multiply
01:52 - that asterisk there is the symbol for
01:55 - multiplication it's the number above the
01:57 - eight on your keyboard so press Shift +
01:59 - 8 to get it and last you can of course
02:02 - divide
02:14 - you can also calculate with variables
02:16 - you remember we have our apples variable
02:20 - well apples times 2 is 30
02:29 - another type of data we can work with is
02:31 - text remember our first program we
02:35 - printed hello world to the screen the
02:40 - stuff inside the quotation marks is
02:41 - called a string a string just means a
02:44 - bunch of characters those characters can
02:46 - be letters numbers whatever we can type
02:48 - we put them inside quotes so the
02:50 - computer knows that they're not commands
02:52 - here's an example see I put the word our
03:00 - engine quotes so now fruit is equal to
03:03 - orange what if I left the quotes out I
03:09 - get an error message right because it
03:12 - thinks orange is a variable so orange
03:14 - should be pointing at something but we
03:15 - never told orange to point at anything
03:17 - so the computer doesn't know what we
03:19 - mean let's see a little more about how
03:22 - strings work strings can be added
03:25 - together
03:33 - you
03:36 - see how adding those two strings
03:38 - together just push them together I
03:39 - didn't include a space so the computer
03:41 - didn't put one there either in fact
03:44 - every string is just a bunch of
03:45 - individual characters added together
04:01 - that's why they're called strings will
04:03 - work more with strings later in the
04:04 - class
04:07 - all right I've reset my window just so
04:09 - it won't be so cluttered you don't have
04:11 - to do that if you don't want to so the
04:14 - last type of data I'd like to talk about
04:15 - is a list lists are really useful if you
04:18 - need to keep track of a bunch of things
04:20 - this is what a list looks like we use a
04:23 - square bracket and then any number of
04:26 - items can go inside it separated by
04:29 - commas you can also make lists that are
04:34 - lists of strings so for example my
04:39 - friends are Bob to add Alex that's a
04:46 - list now how would we use these let's
04:49 - imagine that we're building a game about
04:51 - wizards and the player has to collect a
04:54 - bunch of items to make a magic potion
04:55 - with a list we can keep track of what's
04:58 - in their backpack and let's say they've
05:02 - collected a bat I some slug slime and a
05:09 - lizard gizzard okay and that's their
05:14 - list of items inside their backpack now
05:18 - when the computer has items in a list it
05:20 - keeps track of them by numbering them
05:22 - however when a computer counts it counts
05:24 - a little differently from how you or I
05:26 - might do it it always starts counting at
05:29 - the number zero these numbers are how it
05:31 - keeps track of what place in the list
05:34 - each item is and that's called an index
05:36 - let's see how we would use indexes
05:40 - backpack number zero is the first item
05:44 - in the list backpack number one item
05:48 - number one is the slug slime but what if
05:52 - we say we want backpack item number
05:55 - three well we get an error message all
05:58 - right it says the index is out of range
06:00 - that's because the list only has an item
06:04 - number zero on item number one and an
06:07 - item number two there is no item number
06:09 - three
06:12 - it takes a little getting used to to
06:14 - remember to start counting with zero but
06:16 - with practice you'll get used to it in
06:18 - no time now lists are useful because if
06:22 - we want to change something we don't
06:24 - have to retype the whole list let's say
06:26 - that instead of slug slime the wizard
06:28 - actually has red slug slime well we can
06:31 - just change that one item I want to
06:34 - change backpack item number one to be
06:36 - red slug slime now if I print out the
06:40 - whole backpack only that item has
06:44 - changed we didn't have to worry about
06:46 - changing any of the other items in the
06:48 - list
06:56 - you
