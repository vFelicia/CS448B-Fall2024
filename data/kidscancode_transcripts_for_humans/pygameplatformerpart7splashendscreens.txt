00:00 - welcome back to game development a game
00:01 - we're continuing development on our
00:05 - platformer game and in this video this
00:08 - will be a pretty quick one we're going
00:09 - to add a splash or Start screen and then
00:12 - a game over screen for when the player
00:14 - loses in this video I'm ready to go down
00:19 - and start filling in the start and game
00:22 - over screens although one quick change
00:25 - that I did make that I'll go back over
00:27 - here to it so I went ahead and made a
00:29 - setting variable called BG color so I
00:32 - could use this nice light blue as my
00:34 - background color so over here in my draw
00:37 - section I'm just filling with the
00:38 - background color just because this light
00:41 - blue looks a little more sky like so
00:45 - that when we do start putting some
00:47 - graphics in there it's a little nicer to
00:50 - look at them the plain black background
00:52 - okay so so what we want to do we already
00:56 - have it set up so that when the game
00:59 - first starts it's going to show the
01:02 - start screen and whenever the game ends
01:06 - you're gonna see the game over screen so
01:08 - we just need to fill in what we want to
01:10 - display in those sections so we'll start
01:15 - with the start screen so we want to we
01:17 - want to draw some things to the screen
01:18 - well what do we want to show well we can
01:20 - we can also fill in the screen with that
01:24 - BG color and then we can draw some text
01:28 - we added the draw text function last
01:32 - time so we have that already and we can
01:35 - just put what we want our thing to be
01:38 - titled although I do have that over here
01:40 - in the settings do I not yes we just use
01:43 - title there we'll just use title for the
01:49 - text we want to display and then for the
01:52 - font size we want a good large size font
01:55 - I'm going to stick with white for now
01:59 - and then I'm going to Center on the
02:04 - screen and put it at the top quarter
02:11 - then I want to give a little bit of
02:14 - instructions so arrows to move and space
02:20 - to jump just so the players know what
02:25 - the controls are when the game first
02:27 - starts up and we'll put that at will
02:31 - Center it horizontally and we'll Center
02:34 - it vertically and then the last thing we
02:39 - want to stay on there is press a key to
02:44 - play so they know so they know what to
02:49 - hit to play and we want that to be white
02:52 - and we want to put this at width over 2
02:56 - and height times 3 over 4 then I see I
03:02 - left out of Y there so those are the
03:05 - that's the text I want to display on the
03:07 - screen so we can just do display dot
03:10 - flip and it'll draw it now if I run this
03:13 - right now
03:15 - this is gonna happen but you can
03:17 - probably see that we have a small
03:18 - problem because it's gonna flash up
03:22 - there instantly and then the game is
03:23 - gonna start because we're not waiting
03:26 - after this what we want to do after the
03:29 - start screen it ends as we are meaning
03:31 - after the start screen displays is we
03:32 - want to wait for the player to press the
03:33 - key and since we're also going to want
03:37 - to do that in the game over screen we
03:41 - should probably go ahead and define wait
03:44 - for key which is a function that will
03:48 - just pause waiting for the key event for
03:53 - the person the person is ready to
03:55 - continue so we'll have a little loop
03:58 - here just running as long as this
04:00 - waiting variable is true so as long as
04:04 - that's true what are we gonna do well
04:05 - we'll use our clock to tick and and and
04:14 - run the loop at a certain speed which is
04:16 - the same thing we do with our main loop
04:19 - up here right
04:23 - and in fact you could even put that to a
04:26 - lower number you know because your your
04:29 - game over screen doesn't need to run at
04:32 - a really high frame rate there's no
04:34 - action going on it doesn't really matter
04:36 - we'll stick that because you may
04:38 - eventually want to add some animation on
04:40 - your Start screen maybe there's a clouds
04:43 - floating by little little characters
04:48 - jumping around something like that you
04:49 - can you can add that in there but for
04:52 - now all we want to do in the wait for
04:54 - key is check the events and then there's
05:02 - two events we want to check for if the
05:07 - event is a PG quit that means the person
05:12 - click the X on the window we definitely
05:14 - want this to we want the whole thing to
05:17 - close so we're gonna say waiting equals
05:19 - false and then because we want our whole
05:25 - our whole program to end we also want to
05:28 - set running equal to false as well so
05:32 - this will this will stop two and then
05:37 - the other event that we want to check
05:39 - for is the PG opt event meaning the
05:43 - person pressed to any other key or any
05:46 - key on the keyboard and for that we just
05:48 - set waiting equal to false and then our
05:52 - wait for key loop will end so that's
05:54 - what wait for key needs to do check for
05:59 - the events and then exit if they press
06:02 - the X so let's run it we should see oops
06:06 - that we need to now say in here and the
06:09 - start screen wait for key then we can
06:15 - run this now we have our title screen
06:18 - pops up we get some instructions and we
06:21 - press the key and now we can play now
06:23 - when we die we just need to have the
06:27 - game over screen filled in as well and
06:31 - we can do that really quick
06:36 - so on the game over screen I'm going to
06:39 - also fill the screen with the BG color
06:45 - and then we want to draw a couple of
06:48 - other things right and in fact what we
06:51 - can do is there's a few things we want
06:53 - to show I'm gonna just copy these three
06:58 - draw text lines and I'm going to change
07:01 - this to now I want this to say game over
07:04 - the middle one I want to show I want to
07:08 - show what your score was so you can see
07:11 - what your score was so we're gonna say
07:13 - we're going to show the score plus
07:18 - whatever the value of score was in the
07:22 - middle and then and then we can say to
07:24 - play again here PG displayed up flip and
07:32 - we wait for a key now now if we run we
07:41 - can up here and right there's our game
07:44 - over screen shows what my score was and
07:47 - I can play again but there's one small
07:49 - problem now and that is in the middle of
07:51 - the game if I press the X up here the
07:55 - program doesn't close I go to the game
07:57 - over screen and the reason for that is
08:00 - while we're running the game by pressing
08:03 - the X on the window sets running equal
08:07 - to false all right and here's the loop
08:09 - that that controls well during the game
08:12 - if we set running equal to false we drop
08:14 - to this command so this loop hasn't
08:17 - ended yet because it hasn't gotten to
08:18 - the end of the loop the even though you
08:22 - set a variable a loop variable to false
08:24 - the loop doesn't check that variable
08:27 - until it finishes one run-through so we
08:31 - have running equal to false but we still
08:33 - go to the game over screen and then when
08:36 - we came out of the game over screen it
08:37 - would quit so what we want to do in our
08:39 - game over screen is just check to see if
08:42 - running has been set to false and just
08:45 - basically ignore or ignore the game over
08:48 - screen pass through
08:49 - if not self dot running meaning if
08:53 - running has been set to false then we're
08:55 - just going to return which means end
08:57 - this function so what happens is now
09:02 - when I'm playing the game if I press the
09:05 - X it just exits which is a more more of
09:10 - an expected behavior all right that'll
09:15 - do it for this video go ahead and if you
09:18 - want to make your start and game over
09:21 - screens a little more interesting you
09:23 - can go in here and change change your
09:25 - fonts change your colors you can even
09:30 - some graphics on there although we
09:32 - haven't gotten into adding any graphics
09:33 - yet so we'll probably hold off on that
09:35 - until we have the the game graphics in
09:37 - then we can use some of those in the
09:39 - Start screen but go ahead and knock
09:42 - yourself out you can have a lot of fun
09:44 - with making your especially your splash
09:45 - screen really interesting and fun to
09:48 - look at ok I'll see you next time thanks
09:51 - for watching
09:58 - you

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back to game development a game we're continuing development on our platformer game and in this video this will be a pretty quick one we're going to add a splash or Start screen and then a game over screen for when the player loses in this video I'm ready to go down and start filling in the start and game over screens although one quick change that I did make that I'll go back over here to it so I went ahead and made a setting variable called BG color so I could use this nice light blue as my background color so over here in my draw section I'm just filling with the background color just because this light blue looks a little more sky like so that when we do start putting some graphics in there it's a little nicer to look at them the plain black background okay so so what we want to do we already have it set up so that when the game first starts it's going to show the start screen and whenever the game ends you're gonna see the game over screen so we just need to fill in what we want to display in those sections so we'll start with the start screen so we want to we want to draw some things to the screen well what do we want to show well we can we can also fill in the screen with that BG color and then we can draw some text we added the draw text function last time so we have that already and we can just put what we want our thing to be titled although I do have that over here in the settings do I not yes we just use title there we'll just use title for the text we want to display and then for the font size we want a good large size font I'm going to stick with white for now and then I'm going to Center on the screen and put it at the top quarter then I want to give a little bit of instructions so arrows to move and space to jump just so the players know what the controls are when the game first starts up and we'll put that at will Center it horizontally and we'll Center it vertically and then the last thing we want to stay on there is press a key to play so they know so they know what to hit to play and we want that to be white and we want to put this at width over 2 and height times 3 over 4 then I see I left out of Y there so those are the that's the text I want to display on the screen so we can just do display dot flip and it'll draw it now if I run this right now this is gonna happen but you can probably see that we have a small problem because it's gonna flash up there instantly and then the game is gonna start because we're not waiting after this what we want to do after the start screen it ends as we are meaning after the start screen displays is we want to wait for the player to press the key and since we're also going to want to do that in the game over screen we should probably go ahead and define wait for key which is a function that will just pause waiting for the key event for the person the person is ready to continue so we'll have a little loop here just running as long as this waiting variable is true so as long as that's true what are we gonna do well we'll use our clock to tick and and and run the loop at a certain speed which is the same thing we do with our main loop up here right and in fact you could even put that to a lower number you know because your your game over screen doesn't need to run at a really high frame rate there's no action going on it doesn't really matter we'll stick that because you may eventually want to add some animation on your Start screen maybe there's a clouds floating by little little characters jumping around something like that you can you can add that in there but for now all we want to do in the wait for key is check the events and then there's two events we want to check for if the event is a PG quit that means the person click the X on the window we definitely want this to we want the whole thing to close so we're gonna say waiting equals false and then because we want our whole our whole program to end we also want to set running equal to false as well so this will this will stop two and then the other event that we want to check for is the PG opt event meaning the person pressed to any other key or any key on the keyboard and for that we just set waiting equal to false and then our wait for key loop will end so that's what wait for key needs to do check for the events and then exit if they press the X so let's run it we should see oops that we need to now say in here and the start screen wait for key then we can run this now we have our title screen pops up we get some instructions and we press the key and now we can play now when we die we just need to have the game over screen filled in as well and we can do that really quick so on the game over screen I'm going to also fill the screen with the BG color and then we want to draw a couple of other things right and in fact what we can do is there's a few things we want to show I'm gonna just copy these three draw text lines and I'm going to change this to now I want this to say game over the middle one I want to show I want to show what your score was so you can see what your score was so we're gonna say we're going to show the score plus whatever the value of score was in the middle and then and then we can say to play again here PG displayed up flip and we wait for a key now now if we run we can up here and right there's our game over screen shows what my score was and I can play again but there's one small problem now and that is in the middle of the game if I press the X up here the program doesn't close I go to the game over screen and the reason for that is while we're running the game by pressing the X on the window sets running equal to false all right and here's the loop that that controls well during the game if we set running equal to false we drop to this command so this loop hasn't ended yet because it hasn't gotten to the end of the loop the even though you set a variable a loop variable to false the loop doesn't check that variable until it finishes one runthrough so we have running equal to false but we still go to the game over screen and then when we came out of the game over screen it would quit so what we want to do in our game over screen is just check to see if running has been set to false and just basically ignore or ignore the game over screen pass through if not self dot running meaning if running has been set to false then we're just going to return which means end this function so what happens is now when I'm playing the game if I press the X it just exits which is a more more of an expected behavior all right that'll do it for this video go ahead and if you want to make your start and game over screens a little more interesting you can go in here and change change your fonts change your colors you can even some graphics on there although we haven't gotten into adding any graphics yet so we'll probably hold off on that until we have the the game graphics in then we can use some of those in the Start screen but go ahead and knock yourself out you can have a lot of fun with making your especially your splash screen really interesting and fun to look at ok I'll see you next time thanks for watching you
