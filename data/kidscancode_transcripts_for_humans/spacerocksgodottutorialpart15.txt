00:00 - hi welcome back to space rocks the
00:02 - ongoing Godot game development tutorial
00:05 - series in this video we're going to add
00:08 - some upgrades or some some money
00:12 - collecting so that we can purchase
00:13 - upgrades to the ship and we're going to
00:16 - talk a little bit about the new particle
00:17 - 2d feature in good of 3.0 so this time
00:21 - around I've added a couple of small
00:23 - things I'm going to start with the
00:25 - simplest ones which is on the player
00:29 - ship I have added two more position two
00:32 - DS
00:33 - I'm calling the muzzle left and muzzle
00:35 - right and the idea is that this is a
00:38 - potential upgrade that you can get for
00:40 - your ship that will allow you to do that
00:45 - instead for the code I just did this I
00:51 - added a shoot to function which just
00:54 - spawns two bullets I think the the end
00:58 - goal is gonna be that this will become
01:00 - one function and we'll pass in some
01:02 - arguments to say how many bullets we
01:05 - want to fire but I still haven't decided
01:06 - what all the different weapon upgrades
01:09 - might be so I don't want to go too far
01:11 - into that until I've decided how that's
01:15 - gonna work so just for now I just going
01:17 - to use this other function now part of
01:20 - the reason I added that now is that I've
01:24 - added a we need to start developing the
01:27 - upgrade process and to do that I've
01:30 - created a drop object which is this
01:33 - little yellow star which is a very
01:36 - uncomplicated object it just spawns
01:38 - somewhere and it moves in a straight
01:40 - line at a in a random direction and it
01:44 - disappears after a certain amount of
01:45 - time and this is basically gonna be the
01:47 - currency in the global I've created a
01:52 - drop percentage here so it has a 5%
01:57 - chance of dropping when an asteroid is
01:59 - destroyed it'll also drop when a enemy
02:03 - is destroyed so what that means is I've
02:06 - got a new UI up here it's going to show
02:09 - you how many stars you've collected
02:12 - and if we blow up some stuff here there
02:18 - is our well pick up sound and our UI
02:23 - telling us how many stars we've
02:24 - collected so those are a couple minor
02:27 - changes but the main thing that I want
02:30 - to talk about this time around is I've
02:33 - been really interested in experimenting
02:36 - with the new particle 2d engine in Godot
02:39 - 3.0 and so I thought that I would
02:42 - replace this little blue simple little
02:46 - blue flame with something particle based
02:49 - for the exhaust of our ships engine so
02:52 - what I've done is created a exhaust
02:55 - flame particle to denote so I'm going to
02:57 - disable this one and if I run the ship
03:01 - scene you can see what that looks like
03:04 - so we have some orange fading to red
03:12 - particles coming out to look kind of
03:13 - flame like and so I want to go a little
03:19 - deeper into how we're doing that using
03:23 - the particle to denote so let's look at
03:25 - some of the settings here emitting just
03:28 - turns out whether it's on or off and
03:31 - something you'll notice here is that
03:33 - because the particles are very
03:37 - short-lived they don't they don't last
03:39 - for very long the preview here in the
03:43 - inspector doesn't look like what you saw
03:45 - in the game because it's not able to
03:48 - actually show the whole process it's a
03:50 - preview it's a preview of the particle
03:53 - animation so you don't see the actual
03:56 - final result now normally you will if
03:58 - you have a if you have slower moving
04:00 - particles or long longer living
04:01 - particles but because I have my lifetime
04:03 - here set to 0.1 these particles last for
04:08 - a very short amount of time so it
04:10 - doesn't look quite like what you're
04:11 - going to see in the running game the
04:16 - only other thing that I've changed here
04:19 - outside of the defaults for the particle
04:22 - 2d node is I've added a texture here and
04:25 - this texture is just a it's an animation
04:28 - actually it has a whole bunch of frames
04:30 - of a little fireball animated fireball
04:34 - I'm not actually using the animation
04:36 - because for this the particles are also
04:38 - very small so you wouldn't be able to
04:40 - see them but I just added the texture
04:43 - here mark that it's eight by four frames
04:47 - so that's just gonna use the first frame
04:49 - of this and so whatever particle sheet
04:52 - you have might have a similar grid
04:56 - layout you can just grab whichever frame
04:58 - you want that way or actually have the
05:01 - particles be animated and running an
05:03 - animation as they go so that's pretty
05:07 - much it I've moved the location so that
05:11 - it's going to appear from the back of
05:14 - the ship and I've also rotated it 180
05:18 - degrees because the default so the
05:21 - default direction that the particles
05:23 - come out is just going to be rearward
05:26 - and that is all the settings that go
05:29 - into the particle 2d all the magic
05:33 - happens all this appearance stuff
05:34 - happens with a process material and when
05:38 - you click this down arrow you can make a
05:39 - shader material that's if you want to
05:42 - write a shader to do all of your
05:43 - particle processing or you can add a
05:45 - particles material and a particles
05:48 - material is where you're going to set
05:49 - all the properties for how you want
05:51 - those particles to move look change over
05:55 - time all those kind of things if I click
05:58 - on the material here you'll be able to
06:01 - see all of the properties that you can
06:04 - set now there's way too much for me to
06:06 - go into here
06:07 - I actually am planning on doing a an
06:10 - in-depth tutorial that's all about how
06:15 - to use the particles material and how
06:17 - all these different settings work but
06:19 - for this one I'm just gonna go briefly
06:20 - through and talk about the ones that I
06:23 - have changed to create the little flame
06:25 - effect the emission shape the default is
06:30 - a point all the particles fun at the
06:31 - same point I have changed this to box so
06:35 - that I can could expand the Y extents a
06:38 - little bit so that
06:39 - the the particles spawn over a small
06:42 - range of Y values so it looks like
06:44 - they're coming out of the little back
06:46 - exhaust here I've set the spread to zero
06:53 - changing the spread makes the particles
06:55 - spread out more so they have more
06:57 - angular spread as they come out of the
07:02 - emission point let's see gravity I have
07:07 - turned off gravity gravity is on by
07:08 - default and that's gonna make all of the
07:10 - particles fall we don't want that in
07:13 - space initial velocity it's how fast you
07:16 - want those particles moving I said this
07:18 - fairly high because I want it to look
07:19 - like flames shooting out other
07:24 - properties about movement I didn't
07:26 - change any of you know what angle angle
07:30 - lets you rotate the particles themselves
07:32 - scale I've scaled these way down and
07:37 - these start out as a pretty large shape
07:40 - so but I've also added a scale curve and
07:43 - this is something you're gonna see
07:44 - cropping up a lot and the particles
07:47 - material is allowing you to create
07:50 - curves that describe how a property
07:52 - changes over time and so the scale curve
07:54 - here if you click on it there's this
07:57 - interface here for drawing this curve
08:00 - and so you have your starting value and
08:04 - then over time and this this is from the
08:08 - beginning to the end of the lifetime
08:09 - whatever the lifetime is I have the
08:11 - particle starting out zero really
08:13 - rapidly becoming large and then
08:17 - shrinking down again like they're fading
08:20 - away and you can grab these points and
08:23 - adjust them and it'll change what
08:26 - happens and you can grab these little
08:28 - handles to change the shape of the curve
08:31 - and so you can get a lot of different
08:34 - effects that way what else did we do
08:38 - here so we have our scale changing we
08:41 - also have a color a color ramp if you've
08:44 - used the color ramp in good o2 it works
08:49 - pretty much the same way I'm starting
08:51 - out at the
08:53 - white to the natural color and slowly
08:57 - transitioning to red so it looks like
08:59 - the flame particles are cooling as they
09:02 - get farther away from the engine and
09:06 - then if if you have some animation to
09:10 - happen if you have animated particles
09:12 - this is where you would set those I
09:13 - don't have any of that happening that is
09:17 - essentially how I got this flame effect
09:23 - and there's obviously a lot of different
09:27 - things you could do once you start
09:29 - playing around with it I highly
09:31 - encourage you just create a particle
09:33 - node and experiment with all the
09:36 - settings it's the best way to get a feel
09:37 - for what each of them does and how they
09:40 - combine and the possibilities are really
09:43 - pretty
09:44 - limitless once you have your particle 2d
09:48 - in the code all we're doing is that
09:51 - instead of when we look at the player
09:55 - script instead of when we when we thrust
09:59 - showing and hiding that sprite we're
10:04 - going to set emitting to true or
10:06 - emitting to false on the particle 2d
10:09 - node and then I also added a sound
10:14 - called the thrust sound we want to stop
10:17 - it when we let go of the key but when we
10:19 - hit play we don't want to or when we hit
10:21 - up arrow and thrust we don't want to
10:23 - start playing because then every frame
10:24 - it would restart playing the sound it
10:26 - would sound very very bad so if it's not
10:29 - playing we play it so that way on the
10:32 - subsequent frames if it's already
10:33 - playing it lets it keep going and so you
10:35 - just want to use a sound that can loop
10:37 - so that it sounds like it keeps going as
10:40 - it as it repeats all right that's all
10:44 - the changes so far the next video we're
10:48 - gonna start adding the UI for the
10:51 - upgrade screen so that after a after a
10:54 - wave finishes the upgrade screen will
10:57 - pop up and you'll be able to see how
10:58 - much money you have and what things you
11:00 - can buy to upgrade all those different
11:03 - options on your ship and maybe we'll
11:05 - come up with a few more
11:07 - the way all right thanks for watching
11:08 - I'll see you next time
11:17 - you

Cleaned transcript:

hi welcome back to space rocks the ongoing Godot game development tutorial series in this video we're going to add some upgrades or some some money collecting so that we can purchase upgrades to the ship and we're going to talk a little bit about the new particle 2d feature in good of 3.0 so this time around I've added a couple of small things I'm going to start with the simplest ones which is on the player ship I have added two more position two DS I'm calling the muzzle left and muzzle right and the idea is that this is a potential upgrade that you can get for your ship that will allow you to do that instead for the code I just did this I added a shoot to function which just spawns two bullets I think the the end goal is gonna be that this will become one function and we'll pass in some arguments to say how many bullets we want to fire but I still haven't decided what all the different weapon upgrades might be so I don't want to go too far into that until I've decided how that's gonna work so just for now I just going to use this other function now part of the reason I added that now is that I've added a we need to start developing the upgrade process and to do that I've created a drop object which is this little yellow star which is a very uncomplicated object it just spawns somewhere and it moves in a straight line at a in a random direction and it disappears after a certain amount of time and this is basically gonna be the currency in the global I've created a drop percentage here so it has a 5% chance of dropping when an asteroid is destroyed it'll also drop when a enemy is destroyed so what that means is I've got a new UI up here it's going to show you how many stars you've collected and if we blow up some stuff here there is our well pick up sound and our UI telling us how many stars we've collected so those are a couple minor changes but the main thing that I want to talk about this time around is I've been really interested in experimenting with the new particle 2d engine in Godot 3.0 and so I thought that I would replace this little blue simple little blue flame with something particle based for the exhaust of our ships engine so what I've done is created a exhaust flame particle to denote so I'm going to disable this one and if I run the ship scene you can see what that looks like so we have some orange fading to red particles coming out to look kind of flame like and so I want to go a little deeper into how we're doing that using the particle to denote so let's look at some of the settings here emitting just turns out whether it's on or off and something you'll notice here is that because the particles are very shortlived they don't they don't last for very long the preview here in the inspector doesn't look like what you saw in the game because it's not able to actually show the whole process it's a preview it's a preview of the particle animation so you don't see the actual final result now normally you will if you have a if you have slower moving particles or long longer living particles but because I have my lifetime here set to 0.1 these particles last for a very short amount of time so it doesn't look quite like what you're going to see in the running game the only other thing that I've changed here outside of the defaults for the particle 2d node is I've added a texture here and this texture is just a it's an animation actually it has a whole bunch of frames of a little fireball animated fireball I'm not actually using the animation because for this the particles are also very small so you wouldn't be able to see them but I just added the texture here mark that it's eight by four frames so that's just gonna use the first frame of this and so whatever particle sheet you have might have a similar grid layout you can just grab whichever frame you want that way or actually have the particles be animated and running an animation as they go so that's pretty much it I've moved the location so that it's going to appear from the back of the ship and I've also rotated it 180 degrees because the default so the default direction that the particles come out is just going to be rearward and that is all the settings that go into the particle 2d all the magic happens all this appearance stuff happens with a process material and when you click this down arrow you can make a shader material that's if you want to write a shader to do all of your particle processing or you can add a particles material and a particles material is where you're going to set all the properties for how you want those particles to move look change over time all those kind of things if I click on the material here you'll be able to see all of the properties that you can set now there's way too much for me to go into here I actually am planning on doing a an indepth tutorial that's all about how to use the particles material and how all these different settings work but for this one I'm just gonna go briefly through and talk about the ones that I have changed to create the little flame effect the emission shape the default is a point all the particles fun at the same point I have changed this to box so that I can could expand the Y extents a little bit so that the the particles spawn over a small range of Y values so it looks like they're coming out of the little back exhaust here I've set the spread to zero changing the spread makes the particles spread out more so they have more angular spread as they come out of the emission point let's see gravity I have turned off gravity gravity is on by default and that's gonna make all of the particles fall we don't want that in space initial velocity it's how fast you want those particles moving I said this fairly high because I want it to look like flames shooting out other properties about movement I didn't change any of you know what angle angle lets you rotate the particles themselves scale I've scaled these way down and these start out as a pretty large shape so but I've also added a scale curve and this is something you're gonna see cropping up a lot and the particles material is allowing you to create curves that describe how a property changes over time and so the scale curve here if you click on it there's this interface here for drawing this curve and so you have your starting value and then over time and this this is from the beginning to the end of the lifetime whatever the lifetime is I have the particle starting out zero really rapidly becoming large and then shrinking down again like they're fading away and you can grab these points and adjust them and it'll change what happens and you can grab these little handles to change the shape of the curve and so you can get a lot of different effects that way what else did we do here so we have our scale changing we also have a color a color ramp if you've used the color ramp in good o2 it works pretty much the same way I'm starting out at the white to the natural color and slowly transitioning to red so it looks like the flame particles are cooling as they get farther away from the engine and then if if you have some animation to happen if you have animated particles this is where you would set those I don't have any of that happening that is essentially how I got this flame effect and there's obviously a lot of different things you could do

thrust showing and hiding that sprite we're going to set emitting to true or emitting to false on the particle 2d node and then I also added a sound called the thrust sound we want to stop it when we let go of the key but when we hit play we don't want to or when we hit up arrow and thrust we don't want to start playing because then every frame it would restart playing the sound it would sound very very bad so if it's not playing we play it so that way on the subsequent frames if it's already playing it lets it keep going and so you just want to use a sound that can loop so that it sounds
