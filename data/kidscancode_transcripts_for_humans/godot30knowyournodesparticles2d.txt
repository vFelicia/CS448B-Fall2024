00:00 - welcome to know your nodes where we pick
00:02 - an individual node in Godot and talk
00:04 - about how it's used this time we're
00:06 - looking at Godot 3.0 is particles 2d
00:08 - node which you can use to make all sorts
00:10 - of particle based visual effects on the
00:13 - screen are a few examples that we'll be
00:14 - looking at later in the video if you're
00:17 - new to Godot hopefully this will help
00:18 - you get started with particles and if
00:21 - you're familiar with go 2.1 you're gonna
00:24 - see that things are working quite a bit
00:26 - differently in 3.0 alright let's get
00:29 - started so we're starting with this
00:31 - torch image it's just a sprite and we've
00:35 - added a particles 2d node to it and the
00:38 - first thing you'll notice is you get a
00:40 - warning and that warning is telling you
00:42 - that a material needs to be assigned and
00:46 - so we're going to do that go to process
00:49 - material and you have two choices here
00:51 - you can use a shader material which
00:54 - means you're going to write shader code
00:55 - to handle the to handle the particles or
00:59 - you can use a particles material and
01:01 - that's what we're actually going to use
01:02 - and now you can see actually we have
01:04 - some basic white square particles being
01:09 - generated and they're falling down from
01:11 - the spot so what do we want to do well
01:14 - one thing we want to do is move this so
01:16 - that we're gonna want it to look like
01:18 - it's coming from inside the torch not
01:21 - outside it so we're gonna Center that
01:23 - over that and in the visibility section
01:27 - we're gonna check show behind parent
01:29 - because I want the particles to look
01:30 - like they're coming from inside the
01:32 - torch not on top of it
01:33 - okay we're emitting we're gonna take the
01:36 - time and I'm gonna increase that to two
01:39 - seconds on the lifetime and I think we
01:44 - are done there so now we need to go into
01:46 - this particles material and this is
01:49 - where all of your crazy number of
01:52 - settings are for all the different
01:54 - things you can have your particles do
01:55 - and we're gonna change a few things here
01:59 - starting with gravity I want these
02:01 - things to be going upwards not downwards
02:03 - and so I could go in and I could change
02:06 - the gravity which right now is set to
02:10 - positive in the y-direction but I'm
02:12 - going to set that to zero
02:13 - so we're gonna do this a little bit
02:16 - differently than the gravity is gonna
02:19 - make these move so we're gonna turn that
02:21 - off now we want to look at the emission
02:27 - shape here the mission shape is where
02:29 - the particles initially spawn and by
02:32 - default it's set to point so they're all
02:34 - going to spawn at the same point but
02:36 - we're gonna spread that out and we're
02:37 - gonna use a box and in here we're gonna
02:42 - set what the extents of the box are
02:44 - going to be and so we want to spread
02:46 - them out a little bit in X remember this
02:49 - is extents so it's five in either
02:51 - direction so it'll be a total of ten in
02:53 - width and then the Y we're gonna do
02:56 - about 18 so now these guys are spawning
03:02 - and all sorts of little places inside
03:05 - this box okay but our initial velocity
03:10 - which is right here is very small so if
03:14 - we were to increase that a bit let's try
03:18 - 25 you're gonna see that they're all
03:21 - flying out to the right but sort of
03:25 - spread out and part of that is because
03:27 - spread is set to 45 degrees so let's
03:30 - make that zero and now they're gonna be
03:33 - going in a straight line from wherever
03:35 - they spawn but they're going to the
03:38 - right and initial velocity is just a
03:40 - scalar value we can't set a direction so
03:43 - the way you have to solve that is back
03:45 - on your particles 2d you want to rotate
03:47 - it so let's rotate that - 90 degrees now
03:52 - they're spawning and going upwards so
03:55 - let's increase that velocity to 50 fire
03:58 - should be fairly quick and then we're
04:01 - going to talk about scale this is the
04:03 - size that you want the particles to be
04:05 - so if we increase that to say 25 we get
04:08 - much bigger colored squares for our
04:10 - particles but you can also use a scale
04:13 - curve to change the scale of the
04:15 - particle over its lifetime so if we
04:18 - click new curve texture and then click
04:21 - on that new curve we've made we get a
04:24 - new panel opened up here at the bottom
04:25 - where we can alter the
04:26 - so let's say we wanted to start it
04:30 - around there and then scale down to say
04:34 - just under halfway so this goes between
04:38 - zero and one it's a multiplier to that
04:41 - scale property you have back to
04:44 - properties we can look at the angle this
04:50 - is what angle they'll be rotated out
04:52 - we're going to make that 45 so they're
04:53 - more like diamond shapes instead of
04:55 - squares and then we're going to talk
05:00 - about speeding these things up so
05:03 - there's they're starting out at a
05:05 - certain speed but we want them to sort
05:07 - of accelerate as they're going upwards
05:09 - and we can do that with the linear
05:12 - acceleration so that's going to
05:14 - accelerate in whatever direction we're
05:16 - going so if we make that about 25 you'll
05:20 - see now we are accelerating upward as we
05:25 - go and you can see them moving upward
05:29 - that's good
05:30 - and let's go back to the particles 2d
05:34 - properties right now we're only spawning
05:37 - eight of these that's not very many so
05:40 - we're gonna take that and make that a
05:42 - much bigger number and now we need to
05:48 - talk about color just like we can change
05:51 - the scale over the course of the
05:53 - lifetime we can also change the color go
05:56 - down to color here and we're gonna add a
05:58 - color ramp which is a new gradient
06:00 - texture you click on that and we want a
06:05 - new gradient the gradients start out
06:08 - from black to white but we don't want
06:12 - that we want the initial color to
06:15 - actually be a bright white like it's
06:18 - super hot right at the beginning and
06:21 - then we want to end up at the end
06:25 - somewhere in the red we're also going to
06:28 - drop the Alpha a bit so it like it's
06:31 - fading out and then in the middle we're
06:36 - gonna add some orange
06:40 - so it passes through from white to
06:42 - orange to red as it goes so already
06:50 - looking much more fire-like now another
06:52 - thing we can do is look at the angular
06:58 - velocity and that's gonna give it some
07:00 - rotation and we're going to make that
07:03 - about 350 so you see them all spinning
07:08 - now right so they have a angular
07:09 - velocity of 360 but that's not as good
07:14 - when they're all going the same so if we
07:16 - add in some randomness here we can put a
07:18 - 1 in here and that'll randomize them in
07:20 - different directions so they're all
07:22 - spinning independently and that's good
07:27 - enough pretty close to the sample I
07:29 - showed you at the beginning the only
07:31 - thing that I had done differently was if
07:33 - you go back to particles 2d there is a
07:36 - speed scale and if you double that it'll
07:40 - just do everything twice as fast and
07:44 - there we have it a little flame from our
07:47 - torch here's the original one that I
07:50 - made beforehand pretty close to the same
07:56 - you can see there's all sorts of little
07:58 - tweaking you can do to get everything
08:00 - just the way you want it
08:02 - that's part of the fun of messing around
08:05 - with particles is is you know endlessly
08:09 - twiddling all these little knobs and
08:10 - getting them to do different things for
08:11 - you but that was the main example I
08:14 - wanted to show you now let's look at
08:15 - some other examples of some different
08:18 - kinds of effects you can get from
08:19 - particles here's another example this is
08:22 - almost the same setup almost exactly the
08:26 - same particle material settings with the
08:30 - scale and the color ramp going to a low
08:35 - alpha so it looks like it's fading out
08:36 - the reason it looks so realistically
08:39 - like smoke is that we're using a texture
08:41 - this time it's over here on the
08:43 - particles 2d you can set a texture and
08:46 - we're using this white smoke puffs on
08:50 - there and you can see it looks pretty
08:52 - good looks like
08:53 - smoke coming out and we can even put it
08:56 - to see what it looks like in a scene
08:58 - there we attach it to the little house
09:01 - sprite and it looks like you've got
09:03 - smoke coming out of the chimney
09:07 - something that you normally do is
09:09 - something like this is if you look at
09:10 - the house
09:13 - we took the smoke and made it a child
09:17 - like this and then in the visibility
09:22 - section check the show behind parent
09:25 - that way it looks like it's coming out
09:26 - of the chimney instead of on top of it
09:31 - but that gives you a pretty good effect
09:36 - and there you see it in context of a
09:42 - scene pretty good now another thing you
09:46 - can do with something like this smoke is
09:49 - attach it to a moving object so here's a
09:53 - train sprite and we've attached the
09:55 - smoke the same smoke particles to the
10:00 - smokestack but the problem is when you
10:02 - move the train that smoke stays right
10:05 - there with the Train and that's not
10:07 - going to look natural when the Train
10:08 - moves so what you want to do is in the
10:12 - particle settings you go down here to
10:15 - drawing and there's a checkbox by
10:17 - default it's on called local coordinates
10:19 - and that means the particles stay
10:23 - attached to the local coordinates of
10:24 - their parent now if you uncheck that
10:27 - they become global coordinates and that
10:29 - means that when you move the sprite the
10:33 - ones that have already been emitted are
10:35 - not affected by that movement all right
10:38 - they just come out wherever they are and
10:41 - that means that by adjusting some of the
10:43 - settings with speed and things like that
10:45 - we can get this result and actually in a
10:52 - running scene with the train moving
10:54 - you'll see it looks pretty good
10:59 - leaving the trail behind it as it goes
11:02 - and you could add in some more stuff to
11:04 - make it look more like it's chuck
11:06 - jugging and there's little gaps in the
11:09 - in the flow and all that kind of stuff
11:12 - and this acceleration this is the radial
11:16 - acceleration but we're also doing some
11:18 - tangential acceleration in the you know
11:22 - perpendicular direction of movement so
11:24 - that it streams out behind and you can
11:26 - increase or decrease that based on what
11:28 - your speed of your sprite is I'm going
11:33 - to go through a couple other examples so
11:34 - here we have a chest which is just an
11:37 - area 2d you that has a collision shape
11:39 - on it so that we can detect clicks and
11:42 - you're gonna click on this to collect
11:45 - coins and I'll show you what it looks
11:47 - like and then we'll talk about how this
11:48 - is done so there's our chest when we
11:51 - click on it we get the little shower of
11:52 - coins that comes up from it each time we
11:56 - each time we do it and so what we're
11:59 - doing there is we have our coin emitter
12:04 - and it's set to one shot one shot means
12:09 - it's only gonna happen once when you
12:11 - turn it to emitting the amount of
12:14 - particles is 10 when those 10 particles
12:15 - have have done it doesn't happen again
12:18 - right if we uncheck one shot that would
12:21 - be a constant stream and the reason
12:24 - there's that gap there is because we're
12:25 - using explosiveness explosiveness is how
12:28 - many of those ten to emit at once right
12:32 - for example if I put one on there all 10
12:35 - are emitted at once the default value is
12:37 - zero which means you get the steady
12:40 - stream so we wanted to just have a
12:44 - little burst of them and we wanted it to
12:47 - be one shot and then if you notice the
12:54 - animation of the coins the animation of
12:57 - the coins is accomplished by the texture
12:59 - the coin texture looks like this so this
13:03 - is a series of animation frames of the
13:05 - rotating coin and we set that as our
13:07 - texture and then we set the each frames
13:11 - to eight because there are eight
13:13 - frames to this animation and then to
13:16 - make that work in the particle material
13:20 - there is an animation section where you
13:24 - can set the speed and tweak it and all
13:27 - sorts of ways to make it run the way you
13:28 - want for a little bit more involved
13:31 - example of this I have this animation of
13:34 - a slime droplet coming off the ceiling
13:37 - and so this is the final frame this is
13:40 - where we want it to stop so we don't
13:42 - want it to loop and so I've set up a
13:45 - little slime dripping from the ceiling
13:50 - particle emitter here and so what's
13:54 - going on here is we've got seven frames
13:56 - of animation and in the particles
14:00 - material we're setting the initial we're
14:05 - setting the speed here but we've
14:06 - unchecked a loop so that when it reaches
14:08 - the drop it stays there but we've also
14:12 - added an acceleration curve and so this
14:15 - curve stays flat for the first part of
14:18 - the lifetime so the drop at the top
14:22 - doesn't move while it's there then the
14:25 - speed ramps up from there so that it
14:28 - starts falling and that's what gives us
14:31 - the following effect and just a couple
14:37 - other examples to give you some ideas
14:39 - here's a little one where whenever we
14:41 - drop the bombs they explode upon hitting
14:44 - so these are rigidbody
14:45 - two DS that delete themselves when they
14:51 - contact an object but they send out a
14:54 - signal to the scene to the parent scene
14:57 - so that it will spawn a particle emitter
15:01 - now a couple of limitations that
15:03 - particle emitters have one of them is so
15:06 - for the explosion you probably want to
15:08 - be you probably want to have it on one
15:11 - shot so that the explosion goes and then
15:13 - it's done but the problem is that when
15:17 - an explosion is or sorry went in it
15:19 - emitter is set to one shot when it
15:21 - finishes so see if I start it if I set
15:24 - it to one shot and let's set it to emit
15:26 - right it finishes the emitting the
15:29 - explosions done the emitting the
15:32 - property is still true so there's no way
15:35 - for us to tell in our code that this
15:39 - particle emissions is actually finished
15:42 - so what we had to do was just create a
15:45 - little timer and delete the particle
15:49 - emitter after enough time has gone by
15:52 - now there's an open issue for this on
15:54 - github so hopefully that gets resolved
15:57 - one way or another either with a mission
16:00 - complete signal or the emission property
16:04 - getting set back to false so you can
16:06 - check for that and you know we'll see
16:08 - how that goes but in the meantime if
16:09 - you're doing something like this and you
16:11 - need to get rid of your particle emitter
16:14 - after it's finished use a timer and you
16:17 - free it when that timer finishes another
16:21 - example is your classic space warp
16:23 - particle emitter where you have the
16:25 - particles coming out from the center of
16:27 - the screen like you're going into
16:28 - hyperspace which can be a lot of fun to
16:31 - play around with and make all sorts of
16:34 - different color effects and glow effects
16:37 - and things like that to give you that
16:40 - impression number of particles can make
16:42 - a huge difference here the key here to
16:46 - getting this effect is taking our
16:49 - texture which kind of an a glow an oval
16:51 - glow shape and in the material setting
16:55 - the align Y property because if we don't
16:58 - set that then the texture is oriented
17:02 - the same way just up and down but by
17:05 - checking a line Y it will align the
17:08 - y-axis of the particle with or the
17:13 - texture I should say with the particles
17:14 - direction and that will give you that
17:17 - much better streaming effect particles
17:21 - can really add atmosphere for example if
17:23 - I turn on the rain here we get one
17:25 - effect or if I turn it off and turn on
17:29 - this other one which I called upside
17:31 - down where we have all these little
17:32 - floaty particles that must mean
17:35 - something's not right
17:36 - and you want to be careful so I hope
17:38 - that gives you ideas for things you can
17:40 - try
17:40 - make on your own when it comes to
17:42 - particles the fun really is in tinkering
17:44 - and trying different things whenever you
17:46 - find something really cool save it
17:48 - somewhere because you never know when
17:49 - you'll need that effect in a game I'll
17:52 - post a link to this project below so you
17:54 - can download and play with it yourself
17:55 - make sure you have Godot 3.0 beta 1 or
17:58 - later thanks for watching and I'll see
18:01 - you next time
18:09 - you

Cleaned transcript:

welcome to know your nodes where we pick an individual node in Godot and talk about how it's used this time we're looking at Godot 3.0 is particles 2d node which you can use to make all sorts of particle based visual effects on the screen are a few examples that we'll be looking at later in the video if you're new to Godot hopefully this will help you get started with particles and if you're familiar with go 2.1 you're gonna see that things are working quite a bit differently in 3.0 alright let's get started so we're starting with this torch image it's just a sprite and we've added a particles 2d node to it and the first thing you'll notice is you get a warning and that warning is telling you that a material needs to be assigned and so we're going to do that go to process material and you have two choices here you can use a shader material which means you're going to write shader code to handle the to handle the particles or you can use a particles material and that's what we're actually going to use and now you can see actually we have some basic white square particles being generated and they're falling down from the spot so what do we want to do well one thing we want to do is move this so that we're gonna want it to look like it's coming from inside the torch not outside it so we're gonna Center that over that and in the visibility section we're gonna check show behind parent because I want the particles to look like they're coming from inside the torch not on top of it okay we're emitting we're gonna take the time and I'm gonna increase that to two seconds on the lifetime and I think we are done there so now we need to go into this particles material and this is where all of your crazy number of settings are for all the different things you can have your particles do and we're gonna change a few things here starting with gravity I want these things to be going upwards not downwards and so I could go in and I could change the gravity which right now is set to positive in the ydirection but I'm going to set that to zero so we're gonna do this a little bit differently than the gravity is gonna make these move so we're gonna turn that off now we want to look at the emission shape here the mission shape is where the particles initially spawn and by default it's set to point so they're all going to spawn at the same point but we're gonna spread that out and we're gonna use a box and in here we're gonna set what the extents of the box are going to be and so we want to spread them out a little bit in X remember this is extents so it's five in either direction so it'll be a total of ten in width and then the Y we're gonna do about 18 so now these guys are spawning and all sorts of little places inside this box okay but our initial velocity which is right here is very small so if we were to increase that a bit let's try 25 you're gonna see that they're all flying out to the right but sort of spread out and part of that is because spread is set to 45 degrees so let's make that zero and now they're gonna be going in a straight line from wherever they spawn but they're going to the right and initial velocity is just a scalar value we can't set a direction so the way you have to solve that is back on your particles 2d you want to rotate it so let's rotate that 90 degrees now they're spawning and going upwards so let's increase that velocity to 50 fire should be fairly quick and then we're going to talk about scale this is the size that you want the particles to be so if we increase that to say 25 we get much bigger colored squares for our particles but you can also use a scale curve to change the scale of the particle over its lifetime so if we click new curve texture and then click on that new curve we've made we get a new panel opened up here at the bottom where we can alter the so let's say we wanted to start it around there and then scale down to say just under halfway so this goes between zero and one it's a multiplier to that scale property you have back to properties we can look at the angle this is what angle they'll be rotated out we're going to make that 45 so they're more like diamond shapes instead of squares and then we're going to talk about speeding these things up so there's they're starting out at a certain speed but we want them to sort of accelerate as they're going upwards and we can do that with the linear acceleration so that's going to accelerate in whatever direction we're going so if we make that about 25 you'll see now we are accelerating upward as we go and you can see them moving upward that's good and let's go back to the particles 2d properties right now we're only spawning eight of these that's not very many so we're gonna take that and make that a much bigger number and now we need to talk about color just like we can change the scale over the course of the lifetime we can also change the color go down to color here and we're gonna add a color ramp which is a new gradient texture you click on that and we want a new gradient the gradients start out from black to white but we don't want that we want the initial color to actually be a bright white like it's super hot right at the beginning and then we want to end up at the end somewhere in the red we're also going to drop the Alpha a bit so it like it's fading out and then in the middle we're gonna add some orange so it passes through from white to orange to red as it goes so already looking much more firelike now another thing we can do is look at the angular velocity and that's gonna give it some rotation and we're going to make that about 350 so you see them all spinning now right so they have a angular velocity of 360 but that's not as good when they're all going the same so if we add in some randomness here we can put a 1 in here and that'll randomize them in different directions so they're all spinning independently and that's good enough pretty close to the sample I showed you at the beginning the only thing that I had done differently was if you go back to particles 2d there is a speed scale and if you double that it'll just do everything twice as fast and there we have it a little flame from our torch here's the original one that I made beforehand pretty close to the same you can see there's all sorts of little tweaking you can do to get everything just the way you want it that's part of the fun of messing around with particles is is you know endlessly twiddling all these little knobs and getting them to do different things for you but that was the main example I wanted to show you now let's look at some other examples of some different kinds of effects you can get from particles here's another example this is almost the same setup almost exactly the same particle material settings with the scale and the color ramp going to a low alpha so it looks like it's fading out the reason it looks so realistically like smoke is that we're using a texture this time it's over here on the particles 2d you can set a texture and we're using this white smoke puffs on there and you can see it looks pretty good looks like smoke coming out and we can even put it to see what it looks like in a scene there we attach it to the little house sprite and it looks like you've got smoke coming out of the chimney something that you normally do is something like this is if you look at the house we took the smoke and made it a child like this and then in the visibility section check the show behind parent that way it looks like it's coming out of the chimney instead of on top of it but that gives you a pretty good effect and there you see it in context of a scene pretty good now another thing you can do with something like this smoke is attach it to a moving object so here's a train sprite and we've attached the smoke the same smoke particles to the smokestack but the problem is when you move the train that smoke stays right there with the Train and that's not going to look natural when the Train moves so what you want to do is in the particle settings you go down here to drawing and there's a checkbox by default it's on called local coordinates and that means the particles stay attached to the local coordinates of their parent now if you uncheck that they become global coordinates and that means that when you move the sprite the ones that have already been emitted are not affected by that movement all right they just come out wherever they are and that means that by adjusting some of the settings with speed and things like that we can get this result and actually in a running scene with the train moving you'll see it looks pretty good leaving the trail behind it as it goes and you could add in some more stuff to make it look more like it's chuck jugging and there's little gaps in the in the flow and all that kind of stuff and this acceleration this is the radial acceleration but we're also doing some tangential acceleration in the you know perpendicular direction of movement so that it streams out behind and you can increase or decrease that based on what your speed of your sprite is I'm going to go through a couple other examples so here we have a chest which is just an area 2d you that has a collision shape on it so that we can detect clicks and you're gonna click on this to collect coins and I'll show you what it looks like and then we'll talk about how this is done so there's our chest when we click on it we get the little shower of coins that comes up from it each time we each time we do it and so what we're doing there is we have our coin emitter and it's set to one shot one shot means it's only gonna happen once when you turn it to emitting the amount of particles is 10 when those 10 particles have have done it doesn't happen again right if we uncheck one shot that would be a constant stream and the reason there's that gap there is because we're using explosiveness explosiveness is how many of those ten to emit at once right for example if I put one on there all 10 are emitted at once the default value is zero which means you get the steady stream so we wanted to just have a little burst of them and we wanted it to be one shot and then if you notice the animation of the coins the animation of the coins is accomplished by the texture the coin texture looks like this so this is a series of animation frames of the rotating coin and we set that as our texture and then we set the each frames to eight because there are eight frames to this animation and then to make that work in the particle material there is an animation section where you can set the speed and tweak it and all sorts of ways to make it run the way you want for a little bit more involved example of this I have this animation of a slime droplet coming off the ceiling and so this is the final frame this is where we want it to stop so we don't want it to loop and so I've set up a little slime dripping from the ceiling particle emitter here and so what's going on here is we've got seven frames of animation and in the particles material we're setting the initial we're setting the speed here but we've unchecked a loop so that when it reaches the drop it stays there but we've also added an acceleration curve and so this curve stays flat for the first part of the lifetime so the drop at the top doesn't move while it's there then the speed ramps up from there so that it starts falling and that's what gives us the following effect and just a couple other examples to give you some ideas here's a little one where whenever we drop the bombs they explode upon hitting so these are rigidbody two DS that delete themselves when they contact an object but they send out a signal to the scene to the parent scene so that it will spawn a particle emitter now a couple of limitations that particle emitters have one of them is so for the explosion you probably want to be you probably want to have it on one shot so that the explosion goes and then it's done but the problem is that when an explosion is or sorry went in it emitter is set to one shot when it finishes so see if I start it if I set it to one shot and let's set it to emit right it finishes the emitting the explosions done the emitting the property is still true so there's no way for us to tell in our code that this particle emissions is actually finished so what we had to do was just create a little timer and delete the particle emitter after enough time has gone by now there's an open issue for this on github so hopefully that gets resolved one way or another either with a mission complete signal or the emission property getting set back to false so you can check for that and you know we'll see how that goes but in the meantime if you're doing something like this and you need to get rid of your particle emitter after it's finished use a timer and you free it when that timer finishes another example is your classic space warp particle emitter where you have the particles coming out from the center of the screen like you're going into hyperspace which can be a lot of fun to play around with and make all sorts of different color effects and glow effects and things like that to give you that impression number of particles can make a huge difference here the key here to getting this effect is taking our texture which kind of an a glow an oval glow shape and in the material setting the align Y property because if we don't set that then the texture is oriented the same way just up and down but by checking a line Y it will align the yaxis of the particle with or the texture I should say with the particles direction and that will give you that much better streaming effect particles can really add atmosphere for example if I turn on the rain here we get one effect or if I turn it off and turn on this other one which I called upside down where we have all these little floaty particles that must mean something's not right and you want to be careful so I hope that gives you ideas for things you can try make on your own when it comes to particles the fun really is in tinkering and trying different things whenever you find something really cool save it somewhere because you never know when you'll need that effect in a game I'll post a link to this project below so you can download and play with it yourself make sure you have Godot 3.0 beta 1 or later thanks for watching and I'll see you next time you
