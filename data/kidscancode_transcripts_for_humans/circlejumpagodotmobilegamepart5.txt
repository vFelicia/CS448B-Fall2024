00:00 - welcome back to part five in the last
00:03 - part we added our UI for our game
00:06 - screens and in this one we're gonna do a
00:09 - little more UI work adding a HUD a
00:11 - heads-up display for displaying our
00:14 - score and other information during
00:16 - gameplay
00:17 - okay we're also going to start with a
00:19 - canvas layer and this is going to be our
00:23 - HUD and our HUD needs to show two pieces
00:26 - of information our score which is going
00:30 - to be in we're going to use another
00:32 - margin container which I'm going to set
00:35 - to bottom wide and we'll set our custom
00:42 - constants again and inside of there I'm
00:45 - gonna put an H box with this is the this
00:52 - is the score box I'm going to call this
00:53 - so we have it labeled and inside of here
00:56 - are going to be two labels one to show
01:00 - the score which will use the font that
01:04 - we use before let's put some text in
01:07 - there just to have an example and we'll
01:13 - load the font
01:17 - we're gonna put it on the right I'm
01:24 - gonna add a second label I want this one
01:28 - on the left this is gonna say the word
01:30 - score and I want to load the same font
01:37 - except I want to change this size so I'm
01:40 - gonna go in here and grab the font and
01:43 - I'm gonna change the size by saying make
01:48 - unique all right let's fix the layout
01:56 - here so we'll set the size flags make
02:00 - sure the vertical side so I except to
02:01 - fill and that should line everything up
02:05 - just right okay the other thing we want
02:08 - our head to show is a message that's
02:10 - going to tell us when we go up a level
02:12 - and that kind of thing I'm gonna use the
02:15 - same font let's put some text in there
02:23 - and Center I'm gonna keep it centered
02:28 - [Music]
02:30 - I want to clip the text in case it goes
02:32 - bigger see why in a second and then
02:36 - we're gonna set it to Center wide like
02:39 - that
02:40 - and what I want to do with this message
02:43 - is I want to animate it I want it to
02:45 - look like it's growing and fading out so
02:47 - we're going to be in the animation
02:48 - player for that now two animations I
02:54 - want to add in here one that sets it to
02:55 - its starting values and one that will
02:58 - perform the animation so make our init
03:03 - one which is our starting one which can
03:06 - be very short it's going to set the
03:11 - messages font values so we need to make
03:15 - this unique as well it's going to set
03:18 - the size to our starting value and it's
03:25 - going to set the visible
03:31 - off so that it is invisible when it
03:34 - starts and then the second animation is
03:48 - going to do the animation let's make the
03:58 - length of this about 0.75 so I'm in a
04:04 - bit now we want to first thing we want
04:07 - to do is set the visibility on at time
04:11 - zero we're going to take the font size
04:17 - and we're going to animate that from
04:21 - there up to some really large value we
04:28 - want that to be continuous and then we
04:34 - also want it to fade out so we're going
04:35 - to take the modulate and we're going to
04:36 - keyframe that there and at the end with
04:43 - the Alpha down at zero so now our
04:47 - animation does that the message expands
04:51 - and fades out okay let's add a script to
04:54 - the HUD and this is going to do a couple
04:58 - of things we're going to have a show
04:59 - message function that will let us call
05:04 - that so we set the message text and we
05:09 - play the animation we're going to have a
05:19 - hide and show so that we can because the
05:27 - HUD itself is a canvas layer so it
05:29 - doesn't have its own show and hide
05:33 - methods but we can we just want to show
05:36 - and hide the score box when we're when
05:39 - the game ends and then the last one is
05:41 - we need to update this
05:42 - or and that is going to set the value
05:52 - into the score box now we can go back
05:54 - over to our mean and we can instance
05:56 - that HUD seen I had seen is there and
06:03 - now in our mean script we want to call
06:09 - Hyde on the hood when we start the game
06:12 - when we have a new game we're going to
06:17 - show it and also show a message and then
06:26 - we're gonna hide the HUD on game over
06:30 - which is here let's see what that looks
06:36 - like
06:40 - there's our go it's moving downwards
06:43 - instead of going straight so what's
06:46 - going on with that let's check our
06:50 - animation here so I think what we want
06:52 - to change here is on the message the
06:56 - yeah the grow direction should be both
07:03 - yeah that's what we want all right so we
07:07 - should be good to go there now we get go
07:12 - die play again yeah that looks good now
07:17 - that message is also going to show
07:18 - things like when we level up it's gonna
07:20 - it's gonna put level 3 a little for
07:23 - whatever maybe later when we have
07:25 - bonuses or things like that it can show
07:27 - messages like that all right now we need
07:29 - to just hook up that score so we're
07:32 - going to need a variable for that we're
07:35 - going to set it to 0 when we starting a
07:38 - game and call HUD update score and then
07:46 - we need to do the same thing when the
07:49 - jumper is captured we're just going to
07:52 - increment the score
07:54 - by one alright that'll do it for this
08:06 - part don't forget to subscribe below so
08:09 - you can get notified when the next part
08:11 - comes out and I'll see you then
08:19 - you
