00:00 - welcome to part 18 of our tile-based
00:04 - pygame project in this episode we're
00:08 - going to be adding sound effects to the
00:10 - game so one change I want to make real
00:13 - quick before we do anything else is I've
00:16 - added this detect radius variable to our
00:20 - settings and what this is going to
00:21 - represent is how far the zombies can see
00:23 - so if the player is within 400 pixels of
00:28 - them they will chase him but if he's
00:30 - more than 400 pixels away they won't
00:33 - chase right now the zombies can you know
00:36 - head towards you from all the way across
00:38 - the map no matter how far away they are
00:40 - they're gonna be coming towards you I
00:42 - want to make it so that they they can't
00:43 - see forever so all we need to do is we
00:47 - have that value is go over here to our
00:48 - mob and you know here we're calculating
00:52 - how far away we are here so we're gonna
00:56 - make this a little more flexible and a
00:58 - little simplified by just adding a self
01:00 - dot target and that's just going to be
01:03 - the player okay so our mobs target is
01:06 - the player and then we're gonna just go
01:10 - down here and in our update instead of
01:13 - calculating the distance here in the
01:16 - rotation calculation we're going to do
01:17 - it separately so the target will just
01:21 - say dist for short the target distance
01:23 - is the target position minus our
01:31 - position right this same calculation we
01:33 - did just calling it target instead of
01:35 - player so rotation becomes just that
01:42 - okay but now we have this we can use
01:45 - that to tell if we're close enough so we
01:50 - want to say target distance is a vector
01:53 - so we need to know what the length is
01:55 - and so we could say length if the length
01:59 - of the vector is less than the detect
02:04 - radius then we'll do something right but
02:06 - the problem with that is the way we
02:10 - calculate the length of a vector is
02:12 - using the
02:13 - Pythagorean theorem right a squared plus
02:15 - B squared equals C squared so the length
02:17 - is the square root of the X component
02:22 - squared plus the Y component squared and
02:25 - it turns out that for computers
02:28 - calculating square roots is relatively
02:32 - slow I mean compared to compared to
02:34 - arithmetic and multiplication and
02:36 - division and things like that it's
02:37 - really slow so what a lot of vector
02:42 - libraries let you do including PI games
02:45 - is calculate the length squared I just
02:49 - want to know what x squared plus y
02:51 - squared is and leave it there and not
02:54 - take the square root which means we just
02:56 - have to compare it to the detect radius
02:59 - squared and this will be a much faster
03:01 - calculation and since we're doing it
03:04 - every frame for every zombie this will
03:09 - save a little bit of time it may not be
03:10 - significant but it's just as easy to
03:12 - type so what we want to do is say if
03:15 - that so if the distance is less than the
03:18 - rate the TEC radius then all of this
03:21 - stuff here
03:21 - all of the movement code will happen but
03:25 - otherwise it won't so if we check that
03:29 - out we should be able to go over here
03:31 - and see yeah I'll go by the big group
03:35 - see how those zombies are not chasing me
03:37 - right but if I get closer they're gonna
03:40 - start coming after me and if I get far
03:44 - enough away from them again they should
03:45 - stop chasing yep so later on we can go
03:50 - back and add some code to make the
03:53 - zombies wander around when they're not
03:55 - when they're not chasing us but we'll
03:58 - come back to that later this is good
04:00 - enough for now oops and there's one
04:03 - other quick thing we got to talk about
04:05 - there is a bug that started appearing
04:09 - when we just added that detect radius
04:12 - code that I thought be interesting to
04:14 - look real quickly at how to fix it it's
04:16 - a quick fix but it might be a weird one
04:19 - if you don't understand what's happening
04:21 - so let's run and see what this bug is so
04:25 - there I am there's a
04:27 - zombi who can't see me so he's not
04:28 - chasing me yet he's just sitting still
04:30 - so are all the other zombies on the map
04:32 - so if I shoot him boom he's now taken
04:37 - some damage and his health bar has gone
04:38 - down just a little bit right and that
04:41 - all seems fine but watch what happens
04:43 - when I start moving around all the
04:49 - zombies have green bars on them that
04:51 - aren't their health bars right if I
04:54 - start shooting them you know they have
04:56 - their own health bars but they have that
04:57 - green bar on them why is that happening
05:01 - well if we look at how we did our mob
05:04 - when we spawned the mob we set its image
05:07 - equal to the games image when the mob
05:13 - gets hit we draw the health bar on it
05:17 - so we draw the health bar on its image
05:20 - but it's image is the game's image which
05:25 - every mob is using so now the game's
05:28 - image has a green bar on it now when
05:32 - every mob starts moving we rotate the
05:37 - game's mob image which already has that
05:40 - green bar on it and make it its own so
05:42 - so that green bar is getting written to
05:45 - the original image which should be clean
05:48 - and not have anything on it so to fix
05:50 - this very simple all we need to do is
05:53 - make sure that when we spawn the mob we
05:55 - use a copy of the game image and that
06:01 - way we won't be going and drawing this
06:03 - mobs green bar on every mobs image and
06:07 - now you can see this will work much
06:09 - better that mob doesn't affect the other
06:15 - mobs whether they're moving or not all
06:22 - right bug fixed all right let's talk
06:25 - about sounds so I have added over here
06:27 - in the settings file a list of a bunch
06:30 - of different sounds for us to use so
06:32 - I've got some background music that is
06:35 - going to give us some atmosphere and
06:38 - make things sound a little better and
06:41 - then we've got some sound effects for a
06:42 - lot of different things so the player
06:44 - hit sounds are gonna be the sounds that
06:46 - the player makes when a zombie hits them
06:48 - like kind of grunts of pain the zombie
06:51 - moan sounds are pretty obvious these are
06:53 - all a list of various sounds that
06:55 - zombies can make just stuck all in a
06:59 - list because we can randomize them I've
07:02 - got a sound I found that I liked for the
07:05 - zombie getting hit this is when it
07:07 - killed a zombie it just caught it goes
07:08 - splat we've got a sound for the firing
07:11 - of the gun and let me see I made this a
07:14 - list even though there's only one thing
07:16 - in it because eventually we're probably
07:19 - going to want to add a couple more in
07:22 - here and make some variety but I haven't
07:24 - found haven't really found the perfect
07:26 - gun sound yet I'm still looking for one
07:30 - I really like or a set of them that I
07:31 - really like this will be good enough for
07:34 - now and then I have some various sound
07:36 - effects for different for different
07:38 - things happening like picking up the
07:40 - health pack and I found a really cool
07:42 - sound you'll hear when we play it to
07:43 - play at the beginning of the level when
07:45 - the level first starts so these are all
07:48 - the sounds we've got so far for all the
07:50 - stuff that we have going on in the game
07:52 - so we just need to load those things in
07:55 - our in our game now so if we go over to
08:00 - our load data section we have a couple
08:05 - other folders that we're going to need
08:08 - to load so I'm going to make a duplicate
08:11 - of this here and we're gonna load the
08:13 - all the sounds are in the snd folder I
08:17 - just abbreviated it like I did for image
08:20 - and then all of the music is going to be
08:25 - in a music folder okay so we load those
08:30 - up so or we define those as we can load
08:32 - our or our thing so let's start with the
08:35 - music since that's gonna be super simple
08:39 - then the music let's go to the end of
08:42 - the file or sorry the end of the
08:47 - function here and we're gonna add all
08:49 - the sound
08:51 - sound loading stuff first thing we're
08:55 - gonna do is load the sound sub PG mixer
08:58 - music load that's how we load the music
09:03 - we want to use you tell it that we're
09:06 - gonna use the music folder and we're
09:10 - loading the BG music variable so that
09:15 - loads the sound we're sorry that loads
09:17 - the music now we're gonna just play it
09:20 - when we start the game so I'm going to
09:24 - put it right here and def run before we
09:27 - start the game loop PG mixer music play
09:33 - and we're gonna put loops equals
09:35 - negative one cuz we need one because we
09:37 - just want it to loop around and repeat
09:39 - let's see how that sounds
09:45 - you see got a little very cinematic
09:51 - sounding creepy sneaking around kind of
09:56 - music alright let's start adding some
10:05 - sound effects so I'm gonna do these in
10:10 - kind of order from the simplest to the
10:13 - most complicated none of them are gonna
10:15 - be that hard but let's talk start with
10:18 - the effects sounds so we're gonna have
10:20 - sounds for all sorts of different
10:21 - effects we're going to make this a
10:23 - dictionary so that we can name them and
10:26 - have a name map to a sound so we're
10:30 - gonna just go through that effects
10:32 - sounds list that we made or started
10:35 - dictionary that we made in here alright
10:39 - we're gonna look at each one of these
10:40 - I'm going to make one for a little start
10:41 - one of our health up
10:46 - let's call this effects sounds because
10:53 - that's what it is so so the effect
10:58 - sounds for that type is going to be
11:00 - equal to PG that mixer dot sound in the
11:07 - sound folder effects sounds whatever
11:13 - type so that's going to load so at the
11:14 - end of this we'll have a dictionary of
11:16 - effects sounds it has both of those
11:17 - sounds in it and then we can play them
11:21 - you know we want into play so I want the
11:25 - new level start thing to play here right
11:30 - when it get when def new happens when we
11:33 - start a new level so we want to play the
11:38 - level start sound stop play when that
11:45 - starts and then the other sound effect
11:48 - that we want to play is when we pick up
11:50 - the health pack so that's here where is
11:56 - it right here
11:57 - so if we hit a health item then we're
12:00 - going to add health to the player and
12:03 - we're gonna play the effect sounds of
12:06 - the level or sorry level start of the
12:08 - health pack which we called health up
12:13 - okay so let's try those out there's the
12:20 - little level start and then let's go
12:23 - pick up the health pack I need to take a
12:25 - couple of hits and then there we go just
12:30 - a little sound little chime for that
12:33 - alright now we're ready to move on to
12:36 - the next one
12:41 - all right so next let's start on the
12:43 - weapons sounds now we're gonna start
12:44 - building up a list of a dictionary of
12:47 - different weapon sounds we only have one
12:51 - weapon in the game at the moment but
12:53 - we're definitely planning on adding some
12:55 - more so weapon sounds gun is just going
13:02 - to be a list of the sounds that we're
13:04 - gonna play when you shoot the gun
13:06 - alright remember we only have one in
13:08 - that list at the moment but we'll get
13:11 - there so so if we go through that list
13:17 - that we put in settings I get that one
13:20 - right there then we're going to just
13:23 - append it to it so what them sounds gun
13:29 - dot append and then we're just gonna do
13:34 - PG mixer that sound again you can copy
13:39 - and paste that with whatever the sound
13:42 - that we're loading is alright oops
13:48 - forgot a parenthesis there okay so now
13:51 - we've got the sounds loaded and we can
13:58 - play the gun sound when we shoot now
14:00 - when we shoot is over in the class
14:03 - player right we have here that when you
14:07 - press the space you're going to shoot so
14:10 - we want to play the sound too so let's
14:12 - just stick that in there so we want to
14:16 - make a random choice out of that list
14:19 - alright because it's a list so the game
14:24 - weapon sounds gun dot play
14:32 - all right let's go here that is our gun
14:39 - sound not super great I'm not super
14:43 - thrilled with it but it's good enough
14:45 - for now we'll keep looking and see if we
14:48 - find some better weapon sounds good
14:51 - feel free to post your suggestions in
14:53 - the comments below as well we find it
14:56 - good pistol sounds I did find a good
14:59 - shotgun sound but we haven't made a
15:00 - shotgun yet
15:04 - alright now let's see we've got the
15:07 - we've got the weapon sounds let's add
15:11 - the zombie sounds now so now we have see
15:16 - we have sort of a pattern going on here
15:18 - we're gonna have these zombie bone
15:21 - sounds OOP sounds and that's going to be
15:28 - another list of sounds that we can that
15:33 - we can use so we're just going to take
15:38 - all the ones we listed and go through
15:39 - them and we're just going to append them
15:41 - to the list so
15:51 - and and we can just append that same
15:58 - thing here and now we have a list of all
16:03 - the zombie moan sounds now when do we
16:07 - want to play those well we want to play
16:09 - those occasionally right we don't want
16:12 - to play them all the time we don't wanna
16:15 - play them too often we don't want to
16:16 - play them too rarely we want it sort of
16:20 - random and each zombie can occasionally
16:21 - make a sound so we'll go over to that to
16:25 - our mob here and I'm only gonna how the
16:29 - zombies make sounds if they're chasing
16:30 - after the player right there they're
16:32 - hungry they're coming up to the player
16:34 - we're gonna have it make sounds then so
16:38 - what we need to do is we need to pick a
16:40 - random number so the random picks a
16:44 - random number between zero and one right
16:48 - and if that is a very small number
16:52 - because remember that we're doing this
16:53 - every frame for every mob so if we make
16:56 - this happen too frequently
16:58 - we're gonna have a constant bunch of
17:01 - sounds just all playing at once so we
17:04 - want it to be really rare so this is
17:07 - what I played around with and we can see
17:10 - if that's too often or too rare and
17:14 - adjust it so now we want to make a
17:16 - random choice out of that list it's a
17:22 - random choice from that list and play it
17:29 - alright so here we go now they're not
17:32 - going to make this down unless they're
17:33 - chasing me so let's go get a bunch of
17:35 - them to chase me
17:49 - so you can see is it too often is it too
17:59 - rare I'm not really sure yet it's gonna
18:04 - depend really on where we go with the
18:06 - game with how big a crowd how big the
18:08 - crowds of zombies are gonna get how much
18:11 - we want them making noise but it doesn't
18:15 - leave give them a little bit of
18:16 - personality especially when they
18:18 - occasionally say brains okay
18:25 - oh but something you else you might have
18:28 - noticed let me run this again is that
18:34 - the zombie sounds are pretty loud all
18:40 - right they're kind of overpowering that
18:45 - is so we probably want to adjust the
18:48 - sound and this is something that happens
18:50 - a lot when you start bringing in sound
18:51 - effects different sounds were created at
18:54 - different volume levels and they might
18:56 - not be the volume level you want for
18:58 - your particular application relative to
19:03 - the other sounds right we could
19:04 - obviously lower the volume of the whole
19:06 - game but I don't want the zombie sounds
19:09 - to be so overpowering I want them to be
19:11 - quieter and so when we load the sound we
19:13 - can adjust the sounds volume in our
19:18 - program so so what we want to do is
19:22 - before we put the sound into the list
19:25 - okay we're gonna just gonna give it a
19:29 - temporary variable called s just so we
19:32 - can load the sound and set the volume
19:35 - and the set volume command lets you put
19:41 - anywhere between 0 and 1 so 1 is the
19:43 - volume that it's at right now so you can
19:45 - reduce it as much as you want all the
19:48 - way down to 0 right and I'm actually
19:52 - going to drop it quite a bit they're
19:54 - pretty loud sounds actually
19:57 - and you'll see that this will work a
19:59 - little bit better and then we append it
20:01 - into the list once it's been once it's
20:06 - been decreased in volume alright let's
20:09 - go over there and get zombies to chase
20:13 - us now
20:17 - alright see it's a little better to have
20:20 - it more often if they're not as loud and
20:23 - overpowering so maybe point maybe point
20:30 - two you know you can play around with
20:33 - what you think is a good volume and as
20:37 - we get more and more sounds in we'll
20:39 - probably adjust that more and make it a
20:42 - little more or a little easier to change
20:45 - but this will be good enough for now
20:54 - okay okay I'm just gonna skip to the end
20:58 - here and I went ahead and paste it in
21:00 - just doing the same thing with the
21:02 - player hit sounds and the zombie hit
21:05 - sounds alright same process loading them
21:07 - up and now we want to play the player
21:09 - hit sounds when a mob hits a player
21:11 - which we have down here
21:13 - mobs hit player and so I'm going to play
21:16 - a random sound out of that list but I'm
21:18 - only doing it a random yeah I'm only
21:22 - doing it sometimes not every time and
21:25 - that's just because when there's a whole
21:26 - bunch of mobs around you all hitting you
21:27 - if every single one of them makes a
21:30 - sound that'll be too much so there's
21:32 - where we play the hit sounds and then
21:35 - for the zombies we go down here to their
21:38 - update when their health is less than
21:40 - zero and we delete them we're also going
21:42 - to play the zombie hit sound okay so
21:47 - let's see how those work out so I'll let
21:51 - this zombie hit me
21:57 - all right so I make some grunting noises
22:00 - and then I'll go ahead and kill this guy
22:03 - and you can see we get a splat sound
22:06 - when he goes away which is gonna be good
22:09 - for us when we add a nice little effect
22:12 - for the zombie dying all right so
22:16 - that'll do it for the sounds hopefully
22:19 - enjoyed this it feels a lot nicer to
22:20 - play now you've got now it's not purely
22:23 - silent will obviously be adjusting that
22:28 - as we go as we add more features and as
22:30 - we adjust how things behave will
22:33 - definitely be changing the shooting
22:36 - sound will be adding some some may be
22:39 - adjusting the volume down some of them
22:41 - to get the balance just right but I feel
22:43 - pretty good about it so far so hopefully
22:45 - you enjoyed this down below I will link
22:49 - to where you can download all the sounds
22:51 - I used feel free to go ahead and find
22:54 - your own use your own sounds and I will
22:58 - see you in the next video thanks for
23:00 - watching
23:09 - you

Cleaned transcript:

welcome to part 18 of our tilebased pygame project in this episode we're going to be adding sound effects to the game so one change I want to make real quick before we do anything else is I've added this detect radius variable to our settings and what this is going to represent is how far the zombies can see so if the player is within 400 pixels of them they will chase him but if he's more than 400 pixels away they won't chase right now the zombies can you know head towards you from all the way across the map no matter how far away they are they're gonna be coming towards you I want to make it so that they they can't see forever so all we need to do is we have that value is go over here to our mob and you know here we're calculating how far away we are here so we're gonna make this a little more flexible and a little simplified by just adding a self dot target and that's just going to be the player okay so our mobs target is the player and then we're gonna just go down here and in our update instead of calculating the distance here in the rotation calculation we're going to do it separately so the target will just say dist for short the target distance is the target position minus our position right this same calculation we did just calling it target instead of player so rotation becomes just that okay but now we have this we can use that to tell if we're close enough so we want to say target distance is a vector so we need to know what the length is and so we could say length if the length of the vector is less than the detect radius then we'll do something right but the problem with that is the way we calculate the length of a vector is using the Pythagorean theorem right a squared plus B squared equals C squared so the length is the square root of the X component squared plus the Y component squared and it turns out that for computers calculating square roots is relatively slow I mean compared to compared to arithmetic and multiplication and division and things like that it's really slow so what a lot of vector libraries let you do including PI games is calculate the length squared I just want to know what x squared plus y squared is and leave it there and not take the square root which means we just have to compare it to the detect radius squared and this will be a much faster calculation and since we're doing it every frame for every zombie this will save a little bit of time it may not be significant but it's just as easy to type so what we want to do is say if that so if the distance is less than the rate the TEC radius then all of this stuff here all of the movement code will happen but otherwise it won't so if we check that out we should be able to go over here and see yeah I'll go by the big group see how those zombies are not chasing me right but if I get closer they're gonna start coming after me and if I get far enough away from them again they should stop chasing yep so later on we can go back and add some code to make the zombies wander around when they're not when they're not chasing us but we'll come back to that later this is good enough for now oops and there's one other quick thing we got to talk about there is a bug that started appearing when we just added that detect radius code that I thought be interesting to look real quickly at how to fix it it's a quick fix but it might be a weird one if you don't understand what's happening so let's run and see what this bug is so there I am there's a zombi who can't see me so he's not chasing me yet he's just sitting still so are all the other zombies on the map so if I shoot him boom he's now taken some damage and his health bar has gone down just a little bit right and that all seems fine but watch what happens when I start moving around all the zombies have green bars on them that aren't their health bars right if I start shooting them you know they have their own health bars but they have that green bar on them why is that happening well if we look at how we did our mob when we spawned the mob we set its image equal to the games image when the mob gets hit we draw the health bar on it so we draw the health bar on its image but it's image is the game's image which every mob is using so now the game's image has a green bar on it now when every mob starts moving we rotate the game's mob image which already has that green bar on it and make it its own so so that green bar is getting written to the original image which should be clean and not have anything on it so to fix this very simple all we need to do is make sure that when we spawn the mob we use a copy of the game image and that way we won't be going and drawing this mobs green bar on every mobs image and now you can see this will work much better that mob doesn't affect the other mobs whether they're moving or not all right bug fixed all right let's talk about sounds so I have added over here in the settings file a list of a bunch of different sounds for us to use so I've got some background music that is going to give us some atmosphere and make things sound a little better and then we've got some sound effects for a lot of different things so the player hit sounds are gonna be the sounds that the player makes when a zombie hits them like kind of grunts of pain the zombie moan sounds are pretty obvious these are all a list of various sounds that zombies can make just stuck all in a list because we can randomize them I've got a sound I found that I liked for the zombie getting hit this is when it killed a zombie it just caught it goes splat we've got a sound for the firing of the gun and let me see I made this a list even though there's only one thing in it because eventually we're probably going to want to add a couple more in here and make some variety but I haven't found haven't really found the perfect gun sound yet I'm still looking for one I really like or a set of them that I really like this will be good enough for now and then I have some various sound effects for different for different things happening like picking up the health pack and I found a really cool sound you'll hear when we play it to play at the beginning of the level when the level first starts so these are all the sounds we've got so far for all the stuff that we have going on in the game so we just need to load those things in our in our game now so if we go over to our load data section we have a couple other folders that we're going to need to load so I'm going to make a duplicate of this here and we're gonna load the all the sounds are in the snd folder I just abbreviated it like I did for image and then all of the music is going to be in a music folder okay so we load those up so or we define those as we can load our or our thing so let's start with the music since that's gonna be super simple then the music let's go to the end of the file or sorry the end of the function here and we're gonna add all the sound sound loading stuff first thing we're gonna do is load the sound sub PG mixer music load that's how we load the music we want to use you tell it that we're gonna use the music folder and we're loading the BG music variable so that loads the sound we're sorry that loads the music now we're gonna just play it when we start the game so I'm going to put it right here and def run before we start the game loop PG mixer music play and we're gonna put loops equals negative one cuz we need one because we just want it to loop around and repeat let's see how that sounds you see got a little very cinematic sounding creepy sneaking around kind of music alright let's start adding some sound effects so I'm gonna do these in kind of order from the simplest to the most complicated none of them are gonna be that hard but let's talk start with the effects sounds so we're gonna have sounds for all sorts of different effects we're going to make this a dictionary so that we can name them and have a name map to a sound so we're gonna just go through that effects sounds list that we made or started dictionary that we made in here alright we're gonna look at each one of these I'm going to make one for a little start one of our health up let's call this effects sounds because that's what it is so so the effect sounds for that type is going to be equal to PG that mixer dot sound in the sound folder effects sounds whatever type so that's going to load so at the end of this we'll have a dictionary of effects sounds it has both of those sounds in it and then we can play them you know we want into play so I want the new level start thing to play here right when it get when def new happens when we start a new level so we want to play the level start sound stop play when that starts and then the other sound effect that we want to play is when we pick up the health pack so that's here where is it right here so if we hit a health item then we're going to add health to the player and we're gonna play the effect sounds of the level or sorry level start of the health pack which we called health up okay so let's try those out there's the little level start and then let's go pick up the health pack I need to take a couple of hits and then there we go just a little sound little chime for that alright now we're ready to move on to the next one all right so next let's start on the weapons sounds now we're gonna start building up a list of a dictionary of different weapon sounds we only have one weapon in the game at the moment but we're definitely planning on adding some more so weapon sounds gun is just going to be a list of the sounds that we're gonna play when you shoot the gun alright remember we only have one in that list at the moment but we'll get there so so if we go through that list that we put in settings I get that one right there then we're going to just append it to it so what them sounds gun dot append and then we're just gonna do PG mixer that sound again you can copy and paste that with whatever the sound that we're loading is alright oops forgot a parenthesis there okay so now we've got the sounds loaded and we can play the gun sound when we shoot now when we shoot is over in the class player right we have here that when you press the space you're going to shoot so we want to play the sound too so let's just stick that in there so we want to make a random choice out of that list alright because it's a list so the game weapon sounds gun dot play all right let's go here that is our gun sound not super great I'm not super thrilled with it but it's good enough for now we'll keep looking and see if we find some better weapon sounds good feel free to post your suggestions in the comments below as well we find it good pistol sounds I did find a good shotgun sound but we haven't made a shotgun yet alright now let's see we've got the we've got the weapon sounds let's add the zombie sounds now so now we have see we have sort of a pattern going on here we're gonna have these zombie bone sounds OOP sounds and that's going to be another list of sounds that we can that we can use so we're just going to take all the ones we listed and go through them and we're just going to append them to the list so and and we can just append that same thing here and now we have a list of all the zombie moan sounds now when do we want to play those well we want to play those occasionally right we don't want to play them all the time we don't wanna play them too often we don't want to play them too rarely we want it sort of random and each zombie can occasionally make a sound so we'll go over to that to our mob here and I'm only gonna how the zombies make sounds if they're chasing after the player right there they're hungry they're coming up to the player we're gonna have it make sounds then so what we need to do is we need to pick a random number so the random picks a random number between zero and one right and if that is a very small number because remember that we're doing this every frame for every mob so if we make this happen too frequently we're gonna have a constant bunch of sounds just all playing at once so we want it to be really rare so this is what I played around with and we can see if that's too often or too rare and adjust it so now we want to make a random choice out of that list it's a random choice from that list and play it alright so here we go now they're not going to make this down unless they're chasing me so let's go get a bunch of them to chase me so you can see is it too often is it too rare I'm not really sure yet it's gonna depend really on where we go with the game with how big a crowd how big the crowds of zombies are gonna get how much we want them making noise but it doesn't leave give them a little bit of personality especially when they occasionally say brains okay oh but something you else you might have noticed let me run this again is that the zombie sounds are pretty loud all right they're kind of overpowering that is so we probably want to adjust the sound and this is something that happens a lot when you start bringing in sound effects different sounds were created at different volume levels and they might not be the volume level you want for your particular application relative to the other sounds right we could obviously lower the volume of the whole game but I don't want the zombie sounds to be so overpowering I want them to be quieter and so when we load the sound we can adjust the sounds volume in our program so so what we want to do is before we put the sound into the list okay we're gonna just gonna give it a temporary variable called s just so we can load the sound and set the volume and the set volume command lets you put anywhere between 0 and 1 so 1 is the volume that it's at right now so you can reduce it as much as you want all the way down to 0 right and I'm actually going to drop it quite a bit they're pretty loud sounds actually and you'll see that this will work a little bit better and then we append it into the list once it's been once it's been decreased in volume alright let's go over there and get zombies to chase us now alright see it's a little better to have it more often if they're not as loud and overpowering so maybe point maybe point two you know you can play around with what you think is a good volume and as we get more and more sounds in we'll probably adjust that more and make it a little more or a little easier to change but this will be good enough for now okay okay I'm just gonna skip to the end here and I went ahead and paste it in just doing the same thing with the player hit sounds and the zombie hit sounds alright same process loading them up and now we want to play the player hit sounds when a mob hits a player which we have down here mobs hit player and so I'm going to play a random sound out of that list but I'm only doing it a random yeah I'm only doing it sometimes not every time and that's just because when there's a whole bunch of mobs around you all hitting you if every single one of them makes a sound that'll be too much so there's where we play the hit sounds and then for the zombies we go down here to their update when their health is less than zero and we delete them we're also going to play the zombie hit sound okay so let's see how those work out so I'll let this zombie hit me all right so I make some grunting noises and then I'll go ahead and kill this guy and you can see we get a splat sound when he goes away which is gonna be good for us when we add a nice little effect for the zombie dying all right so that'll do it for the sounds hopefully enjoyed this it feels a lot nicer to play now you've got now it's not purely silent will obviously be adjusting that as we go as we add more features and as we adjust how things behave will definitely be changing the shooting sound will be adding some some may be adjusting the volume down some of them to get the balance just right but I feel pretty good about it so far so hopefully you enjoyed this down below I will link to where you can download all the sounds I used feel free to go ahead and find your own use your own sounds and I will see you in the next video thanks for watching you
