00:00 - welcome back this is part three of
00:01 - learning Godot making your first game if
00:04 - you haven't watched the other parts
00:06 - please go back to part one to start and
00:08 - let's get started
00:09 - in this video we'll be making the
00:11 - enemies that the player will have to
00:13 - dodge we have the player scene complete
00:16 - so we're gonna make a new scene to
00:19 - contain the enemies and the root node
00:23 - for this will be a rigidbody 2d which
00:29 - we're gonna rename to mob and the
00:34 - children of this node are going to be an
00:36 - animated sprite a collision shape 2d
00:41 - which is just how we set up the player
00:44 - and we're also going to add a visibility
00:47 - notifier 2d because what we're gonna
00:51 - have these mobs do is they're gonna
00:54 - spawn at a random spot around the edge
00:55 - of the screen they're gonna travel in a
00:57 - straight line and then when they exit
00:58 - the screen they're going to be deleted
01:00 - and so that's what this notes gonna help
01:03 - us do so let's save this scene mob scene
01:08 - and start talking about the properties
01:09 - now the rigidbody 2d has a lot of
01:12 - properties but the one we're concerned
01:14 - with is the gravity scale we want to set
01:17 - that to zero because we don't want our
01:18 - mobs falling down the screen like
01:20 - gravity is acting on them and we also
01:22 - don't want them to run into each other
01:24 - so if you scroll down to the physics
01:26 - body 2d section there's a layer and a
01:29 - mask and this is how you determine what
01:32 - bodies can hit what other bodies and so
01:35 - the layer says that these mobs are going
01:38 - to be in layer 1 so we want to take the
01:41 - mask and uncheck layer 1 and so now they
01:45 - won't hit anything that's in layer 1 now
01:47 - what we want to do is set up the
01:48 - animated sprite and we make a new sprite
01:51 - frames resource and we need to start
01:54 - adding the art for the animations in the
01:57 - art folder here we have three different
01:59 - enemy types and we're going to use those
02:01 - each as a separate animation so I'm
02:04 - going to name them after the file names
02:06 - one's gonna be named fly one is going to
02:10 - be named walk
02:12 - and one's gonna be named swim and so
02:19 - I've dragged the two frames into each of
02:21 - the animations and if we want to see how
02:23 - they look we can click on animated
02:25 - sprite and in its properties there's a
02:27 - there's one called playing if we check
02:30 - that on we can see the animation going
02:33 - and we can choose which animation we
02:35 - want right here and the only issue we
02:39 - have here is they're a little too fast
02:42 - so we're going to go back over into the
02:44 - animation frames and change the speed
02:46 - for fly three works well and for swim
02:51 - and walk we're gonna set both of those
02:53 - to four and now this art is also pretty
02:58 - large if i zoom out here you can see the
03:01 - mob takes up a pretty large chunk of the
03:03 - screen so what we're gonna do is resize
03:07 - them again on the animated sprite under
03:11 - the transform is a scale and I'm going
03:13 - to set that to 0.75 so we just want to
03:18 - shrink it down a little bit
03:19 - three-quarters of its size and then
03:21 - we'll be ready to add the collision
03:24 - shape and just like with the player
03:26 - we're gonna use a capsule but you can
03:29 - see the capsule is oriented the wrong
03:33 - way so in the same place under transform
03:36 - again we're on the collision shape now
03:38 - we're gonna rotate that 90 degrees and
03:41 - that way we will be pointing in the
03:44 - right direction and once again we're not
03:46 - going to stretch the shape we're gonna
03:49 - use the size handles don't forget you
03:54 - can go over here and lock the children
03:58 - from being selected if you if it helps
04:00 - you not accidentally drag the collision
04:03 - shape away now let's add a script to the
04:06 - mob we're gonna use the defaults again
04:08 - this time under template I'm going to
04:11 - choose empty that way I don't get any
04:14 - comments so I hit create and I just get
04:18 - extends rigidbody2d and that's it now
04:21 - for our variables we're going to make to
04:24 - export variables
04:26 - and these are going to be to set the min
04:28 - and Max speed of the mob we don't want
04:34 - all the mobs traveling the exact same
04:35 - speed that'll be a little boring so
04:37 - these will be the two the minimum and
04:40 - the maximum that the random speed
04:42 - valuably will be calculated between so
04:44 - just go ahead and click on mob and we
04:46 - can set these I'm going to set the
04:47 - minimum to 150 and the maximum to 250
04:52 - back to the script we're going to make
04:54 - one more variable this is going to be a
04:57 - list of the three types fly swim and
05:04 - walk that we can use to make a random
05:07 - choice for our mob each time we spawn
05:11 - one now what we want to do in the ready
05:13 - function is we want to set the animation
05:15 - of the animated sprite equal to a random
05:20 - choice out of the mob types list so we
05:24 - want it to pick either 0 or 1 or 2 to do
05:28 - that we can pick a random number R and I
05:31 - fix a random integer any value and we
05:35 - use the percent function to find the
05:38 - remainder when you divide by how many
05:40 - mob types there are we want to divide by
05:43 - mob types dot size and the remainder of
05:48 - that will be 0 1 or 2 and so we'll have
05:52 - a random animation assigned we don't
05:57 - need anything in the process function
05:59 - we're gonna see how the rigidbody works
06:01 - in a minute but we do need to delete the
06:04 - mob when it goes off the screen that's
06:06 - what the visibility notifier is for if
06:09 - you click on node it has a screen exited
06:13 - signal that's the signal we want we're
06:16 - going to connect that and if the mob
06:20 - goes off the screen we're going to
06:23 - delete it which we do using Q free that
06:29 - completes the mob scene now we're going
06:31 - to make one more new scene to be our
06:33 - main
06:35 - and the main scenes root node we're just
06:40 - going to use node which is the top of
06:43 - the list here it's the simplest node it
06:45 - has very few properties it's really just
06:47 - a container we can put the other nodes
06:49 - inside of we're gonna call this main and
06:52 - save this scene first thing we want to
06:56 - add to the main scene is a player so
06:59 - we're gonna click the instance a scene
07:02 - button here which will add an existing
07:05 - scene we're going to choose player and
07:09 - now if I switch back over to 2d now we
07:13 - have our player in our main scene and
07:15 - one of the first things you'll notice is
07:17 - the player is probably a bit too much on
07:20 - the big side too so over on our players
07:23 - scene I'm going to click on the animated
07:27 - sprite and I'm going to shrink this one
07:29 - down to 0.5 X & Y which is going to make
07:35 - us have to resize our collision shape a
07:38 - little bit to save that go back to main
07:43 - and now you see our player a much more
07:45 - reasonable size on the screen now the
07:49 - next nodes we need our timer nodes so
07:53 - we're gonna find the timer node and I
07:56 - want three of them so instead of adding
07:59 - another I'm gonna duplicate them by
08:01 - clicking command D you would click ctrl
08:04 - D if you're on Windows or Linux now I
08:07 - have three timers one is gonna be named
08:10 - the mob timer one is going to be named
08:14 - the score timer and one is gonna be
08:18 - named the start timer and we're gonna
08:22 - use these to control a few different
08:26 - properties the mob timer is gonna be how
08:28 - quickly the mobs spawn so in the mob
08:33 - timers wait time we're gonna set that to
08:35 - 0.5 and the score timer is going to
08:42 - indicate that it's time to add a point
08:44 - to the player score and since your score
08:47 - is how long you're staying alive
08:49 - we're gonna we're gonna keep that set at
08:51 - 1 and then the start timer is gives you
08:56 - a little bit of start time after you hit
08:57 - the this the play button and so we're
09:00 - gonna set that to 2 seconds and we're
09:04 - also gonna set it to one shot one shot
09:07 - means the timer will tick down and then
09:08 - stop when it ends the others if they're
09:12 - not set to one shot will repeat when
09:14 - they when they reach the end of their
09:16 - time period they will restart again and
09:18 - then we're going to add a node called a
09:21 - position to D position to D is a helpful
09:25 - little utility know that it helped lets
09:27 - you mark a position in the in the game
09:30 - space and so we're gonna set this
09:33 - manually to 240 for 50 and that's going
09:40 - to be the players start position so we
09:44 - got to make sure when you start a new
09:45 - game we move the player to that spot and
09:48 - that completes the setup of the main
09:50 - scene in the next video we will write
09:53 - the script for the main scene and tie
09:55 - everything together to finish this game
09:57 - up

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back this is part three of learning Godot making your first game if you haven't watched the other parts please go back to part one to start and let's get started in this video we'll be making the enemies that the player will have to dodge we have the player scene complete so we're gonna make a new scene to contain the enemies and the root node for this will be a rigidbody 2d which we're gonna rename to mob and the children of this node are going to be an animated sprite a collision shape 2d which is just how we set up the player and we're also going to add a visibility notifier 2d because what we're gonna have these mobs do is they're gonna spawn at a random spot around the edge of the screen they're gonna travel in a straight line and then when they exit the screen they're going to be deleted and so that's what this notes gonna help us do so let's save this scene mob scene and start talking about the properties now the rigidbody 2d has a lot of properties but the one we're concerned with is the gravity scale we want to set that to zero because we don't want our mobs falling down the screen like gravity is acting on them and we also don't want them to run into each other so if you scroll down to the physics body 2d section there's a layer and a mask and this is how you determine what bodies can hit what other bodies and so the layer says that these mobs are going to be in layer 1 so we want to take the mask and uncheck layer 1 and so now they won't hit anything that's in layer 1 now what we want to do is set up the animated sprite and we make a new sprite frames resource and we need to start adding the art for the animations in the art folder here we have three different enemy types and we're going to use those each as a separate animation so I'm going to name them after the file names one's gonna be named fly one is going to be named walk and one's gonna be named swim and so I've dragged the two frames into each of the animations and if we want to see how they look we can click on animated sprite and in its properties there's a there's one called playing if we check that on we can see the animation going and we can choose which animation we want right here and the only issue we have here is they're a little too fast so we're going to go back over into the animation frames and change the speed for fly three works well and for swim and walk we're gonna set both of those to four and now this art is also pretty large if i zoom out here you can see the mob takes up a pretty large chunk of the screen so what we're gonna do is resize them again on the animated sprite under the transform is a scale and I'm going to set that to 0.75 so we just want to shrink it down a little bit threequarters of its size and then we'll be ready to add the collision shape and just like with the player we're gonna use a capsule but you can see the capsule is oriented the wrong way so in the same place under transform again we're on the collision shape now we're gonna rotate that 90 degrees and that way we will be pointing in the right direction and once again we're not going to stretch the shape we're gonna use the size handles don't forget you can go over here and lock the children from being selected if you if it helps you not accidentally drag the collision shape away now let's add a script to the mob we're gonna use the defaults again this time under template I'm going to choose empty that way I don't get any comments so I hit create and I just get extends rigidbody2d and that's it now for our variables we're going

250 back to the script we're going to make one more variable this is going to be a list of the three types fly swim and walk that we can use to make a random choice for our mob each time we spawn one now what we want to do in the ready function is we want to set the animation of the animated sprite equal to a random choice out of the mob types list so we want it to pick either 0 or 1 or 2 to do that we can pick a random number R and I fix a random integer any value and we use the percent function to find the remainder when you divide by how many mob types there are we want to divide by mob types dot size and the remainder of that will be 0 1 or 2 and so we'll have a random animation assigned we don't need anything in the process function we're gonna see how the rigidbody works in a minute but we do need to delete the mob when it goes off the screen that's what the visibility notifier is for if you click on node it has a screen exited signal that's the signal we want we're going to connect that and if the mob goes off the screen we're going to delete it which we do using Q free that completes the mob scene now we're going to make one more new scene to be our main and the main scenes root node we're just going to use node which is the top of the list here it's the simplest node it has very few properties it's really just a container we can put the other nodes inside of we're gonna call this main and save this scene first thing we want to add to the main scene is a player so we're gonna click the instance a scene button here which will add an existing scene we're going to choose player and now if I switch back over to 2d now we have our player in our main scene and one of the first things you'll notice is the player is probably a bit too much on the big side too so over on our players scene I'm going to click on the animated sprite and I'm going to shrink this one down to 0.5 X & Y which is going to make us have to resize our collision shape a little bit to save that go back to main and now you see our player a much more reasonable size on the screen now the next nodes we need our timer nodes so we're gonna find the timer node and I want three of them so instead of adding another I'm gonna duplicate them by clicking command D you would click ctrl D if you're on Windows or Linux now I have three timers one is gonna be named the mob timer one is going to be named the score timer and one is gonna be named the start timer and we're gonna use these to control a few different properties the mob timer is gonna be how quickly the mobs spawn so in the mob timers wait time we're gonna set that to 0.5 and the score timer is going to indicate that it's time to add a point to the player score and since your score is how long you're staying alive

also gonna set it to one shot one shot means the timer will tick down and then stop when it ends the others if they're not set to one shot will repeat when they when they reach the end of their time period they will restart again and then we're going to add a node called a position to D position to D is a helpful little utility know that it helped lets you mark a position in the in the game space and so we're gonna set this manually to 240 for 50 and that's going to be the players start position so we got to make sure when you start a new game we move the player to that spot and that completes the setup of the main scene in the next video we will write the script for the main scene and tie everything together to finish this game up
