00:03 - so it's been a little while since we've
00:05 - done any additional work on the space
00:08 - rocks game and it's been other things
00:11 - that I've had to be working on instead
00:13 - but I'm ready to get back in here and
00:15 - add some more features so in this video
00:18 - we're just going to go over a couple of
00:20 - small changes that I've made ahead of
00:24 - time to prepare for the next features
00:25 - that we're going to add to the game so
00:28 - first a couple of small changes on the
00:31 - enemy last time we made a little timer
00:33 - so the enemy could shoot pulses and I've
00:37 - changed I actually removed a little bit
00:40 - of code to streamline that a little bit
00:42 - and the other main thing I did was in
00:47 - the player bullet and the enemy bullet
00:49 - there was a lot of common code so I made
00:52 - this script called bullet GD which has
00:54 - in it the basic where to start and how
00:57 - to move and then player bullet just
01:01 - extends that script and adds its its own
01:06 - unique things and the enemy bullet does
01:09 - the same it extends the bullet scripts
01:11 - so that'll make it a little more
01:12 - flexible down the road and I'm probably
01:14 - going to do that with a couple other
01:15 - things too as we get further into the
01:18 - project now the next major change is I'm
01:22 - going to start implementing some
01:25 - upgrades for the player so I have a
01:29 - dictionary here called the upgrade level
01:31 - and I decided on five things that the
01:35 - player will be able to upgrade the
01:38 - thrust power of his ship so it can
01:42 - accelerate faster the fire rate that's
01:44 - how quickly the bullets are fired the
01:48 - rotation speed of the ship the shield
01:50 - regeneration speed and the guns are
01:54 - going to have some sort of upgrade I
01:55 - haven't quite decided exactly what I
01:57 - want to do for that yet and then these
02:00 - are the settings for the various levels
02:02 - so when you're on level one alright so
02:05 - if your shield regen is one then it's
02:07 - going to be five if your shield regen is
02:12 - level two it'll go up and up and up okay
02:14 - and so each of these I've just
02:17 - I've just thrown some numbers in here
02:19 - we'll have to do some testing and decide
02:21 - you know exactly how we want these to
02:25 - progress but I just wanted to be
02:27 - somewhere so we can see a range of them
02:29 - and now over on the player script what
02:32 - we need to do is set our rotation speed
02:35 - and our thrust based on those values the
02:42 - rotation level is going to be whatever
02:46 - our upgrade level is and whatever the
02:49 - rotation level is for that and the same
02:51 - thing with the thrust we use the fire
02:54 - rate here we're going to set the wait
02:58 - time on the gun timer to that and then
03:02 - in the shield level we're going to use
03:06 - here when we add back to the shield
03:09 - we're going to use whatever level that
03:11 - is at so if we try this out everything's
03:14 - going to be at level one you can see the
03:16 - shield is regenerating quite slowly the
03:19 - ship rotates slowly and it is been
03:22 - firing very quickly either okay and then
03:27 - if we for example where to start
03:30 - let's go over here and change these to
03:33 - level four so we can see what would
03:36 - happen if we're on level four so I don't
03:40 - want to just run the player if we're on
03:43 - level four then right I can a much
03:47 - higher acceleration if I hit something
03:52 - the shield regeneration is much much
03:55 - faster all right so this is what you
03:57 - would get to if you were able to achieve
04:01 - all the upgrades and so how is the
04:05 - player going to be able to purchase
04:06 - these upgrades
04:08 - we're going back to level one there's
04:10 - going to be some sort of there's going
04:14 - to be some sort of money that they can
04:16 - accumulate during the level I think I'm
04:20 - going to have the asteroids when you
04:22 - blow them up will drop some resources
04:25 - and you can pick those up and the more
04:28 - of them you get the
04:29 - and you know you can spend those on the
04:32 - upgrades so in the next video we're
04:36 - going to start building that UI we're
04:38 - going to need a purchase screen so that
04:40 - you can spend your money on the various
04:43 - upgrades see what level they're each at
04:45 - and decide what you want to upgrade
04:49 - alright thanks for watching and I'll see
04:52 - you in the next video
05:01 - you
