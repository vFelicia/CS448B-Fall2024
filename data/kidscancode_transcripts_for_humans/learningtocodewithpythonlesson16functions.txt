00:00 - welcome back to learning to code with
00:01 - Python less than six today we'll be
00:04 - talking about functions okay to get
00:08 - started I've got a small program here
00:10 - that will draw a square using the loop
00:12 - we learned before if you need to pause
00:15 - the video to catch up go ahead and do
00:17 - that now all right let's run the program
00:20 - so we're all sure we're on the same page
00:22 - but before I do that I'm going to move
00:24 - the Python shell window down here to the
00:26 - corner we only really need this window
00:29 - now to tell us if we have an error
00:31 - otherwise it's just in the way so I'm
00:34 - going to put it there and leave us
00:36 - plenty of room for our program so let's
00:38 - go ahead and run it good it's drawing a
00:46 - square but what if we want to draw more
00:52 - than one square well we could tell the
00:55 - turtle to move some distance and then
00:59 - repeat this loop draw the square again
01:04 - all right if we run that you'll see now
01:09 - we are moving and drawing a second
01:11 - square but what if we wanted to draw a
01:17 - lot of squares it would be kind of a
01:20 - pain to have to copy and paste this loop
01:22 - over and over again wouldn't it be nice
01:24 - if we could just have a command called
01:26 - square and then any time we wanted to
01:29 - draw a square we could just give that
01:30 - command well we can by making something
01:33 - called a function you can think of a
01:35 - function as a way to define your own
01:37 - commands that you can use anytime you
01:39 - want so let's get rid of these loops and
01:44 - let's define our square function we
01:48 - start by saying def which is short for
01:51 - define and then what we want our
01:53 - function to be named well let's just
01:55 - name it square that makes sense right
01:56 - and remember we're defining a command
01:59 - and commands always have the parentheses
02:02 - and then we have a colon and now we're
02:05 - going to type what the definition of the
02:07 - square should be well we know what the
02:09 - definition of the square should be right
02:10 - it should be a loop
02:23 - so that would be the definition of a
02:25 - square now if we run this program you'll
02:35 - notice that nothing happens why is that
02:38 - well we defined what Square should be
02:41 - but we never told the computer to
02:43 - actually draw a square we just gave it
02:46 - the definition so now that we've defined
02:48 - our command we can use our command so we
02:50 - can say Square and then we could have
02:54 - Fred move some distance and draw another
02:59 - square
03:10 - but there's another problem with our
03:12 - square command every square that we draw
03:15 - is the same size what if I want to draw
03:17 - squares that are bigger or smaller
03:20 - I'd like the square command to work like
03:25 - this or I put a number inside the
03:27 - parentheses and that's how big the
03:30 - square would be so how do I do that well
03:35 - in our definition of the square we need
03:37 - to add to the definition that something
03:39 - will be inside the parentheses and that
03:42 - something will be some number for the
03:44 - size so let's call it size so now
03:48 - whenever we give the square command the
03:51 - number that we put in the parentheses
03:53 - will be inserted here and called size
03:56 - and now instead of going always going
04:00 - forward 100 we should go forward sighs
04:05 - let's see what that looks like Square
04:11 - that's 100 and a square that's 150 so
04:16 - now our square command is finished we
04:18 - can draw a square any size we want
04:20 - anywhere we want so let's do something
04:23 - fun let's draw squares all over the
04:26 - screen so instead of just drawing these
04:29 - two squares I want to draw a whole bunch
04:32 - of them so let's make a loop and let's
04:37 - actually count to a hundred this time
04:40 - before we go any further let's talk
04:42 - about coordinates you've probably seen
04:44 - this in math class but even if you
04:46 - haven't don't worry it's not too
04:47 - complicated if you imagine that this big
04:50 - rectangle is the turtle window and
04:52 - here's the turtle here in the center
04:54 - then every spot on the screen where the
04:57 - turtle can be can be described by two
04:59 - numbers called its coordinates the first
05:03 - number which is called X is where the
05:07 - turtle is horizontally to the left or
05:09 - right as that X number gets bigger the
05:12 - turtle moves to the right as that X
05:15 - number gets smaller the turtle moves to
05:17 - the left and the second number which we
05:20 - call Y describes the vertical or
05:24 - up and down position of the turtle and
05:26 - why gets bigger as the turtle goes up
05:28 - the screen and why gets smaller as the
05:31 - turtle goes down the screen so knowing
05:35 - that we can tell the turtle to go to any
05:37 - spot on the screen by giving it those
05:40 - two numbers of where we want it to be
05:41 - for example if we wanted it to go to 100
05:45 - comma 50 that would be 100 pixels over
05:48 - this way and 50 pixels up and the turtle
05:51 - would wind up somewhere over here okay
05:54 - so to make our random squares that we
05:56 - want to have anywhere all over the
05:58 - screen we need to pick two numbers tell
06:02 - the turtle to go there and then draw the
06:04 - square in that spot in order to pick
06:09 - those two numbers for where we want the
06:10 - turtle to go we want them to be random
06:13 - so we're going to need to learn some new
06:15 - commands first thing we'll do is up at
06:18 - the top of our program we're going to
06:20 - also import random this tells the
06:23 - computer that we need access to the
06:25 - random commands and now let's pick a
06:29 - number for the X the command for picking
06:33 - a random number is random dot R and
06:36 - range and then inside of the parentheses
06:40 - of R and range you put two numbers the
06:43 - start and the end for the two numbers
06:45 - you want to pick a random number between
06:47 - so let's put - 200 - 200 so that way in
06:54 - our turtle window it'll pick something
06:56 - to the left or to the right and then we
07:01 - need to do the same thing for y okay so
07:08 - now we have a random number for X and a
07:10 - random number for Y and now we'd like to
07:13 - tell the turtle to go to that coordinate
07:17 - the command to tell the turtle to move
07:20 - to a certain coordinate is go to and
07:23 - then you just tell it the X and the y so
07:25 - we'll say go to that random X&Y that we
07:28 - picked and when you get there
07:32 - draw a square and let's just put 100 for
07:36 - the size of the square right
07:38 - now when we run this program the
07:41 - computers going to count to a hundred
07:42 - and loop around and do these four
07:45 - commands a hundred times pick a random X
07:49 - pick a random Y go to that spot and draw
07:53 - a square let's see what happens we have
08:00 - a problem every time we say go to the
08:05 - turtle still leaving a trail behind it
08:06 - we probably want to pick the pin up in
08:09 - between each square don't we we're also
08:12 - moving kind of slow so the squares are
08:14 - going to take a long time to draw so I'm
08:16 - going to go ahead and close it so let's
08:20 - add a command up at the top to set the
08:24 - speed to something fast remember zero is
08:27 - the fastest it means move instantly
08:29 - without animating and then before we go
08:33 - to we need to tell Fred to pick the pen
08:36 - up so that's no longer touching the
08:38 - paper and then we better remember to put
08:41 - it back down again before we draw the
08:43 - square that's better let's see what
08:46 - happens now much better that's exactly
08:54 - what I wanted to happen
09:09 - and there it's done 100 squares now
09:13 - let's make one more change I'd like it
09:16 - if the squares were all different sizes
09:17 - so instead of every square of being a
09:20 - hundred let's pick a random number for
09:23 - that too now there's two ways we could
09:26 - do this we could pick a random number
09:29 - and let's call it size we'll just make a
09:33 - variable called size and we'll put
09:34 - random dot R and range and let's make
09:38 - the squares anywhere between 10 and 200
09:43 - in size and then we draw the square
09:47 - we'll just use that size let's see how
09:51 - that goes
09:59 - now we have squares that are all
10:00 - different sizes
10:09 - now the other way we could do it is
10:11 - instead of picking this random number
10:14 - putting it in a variable and then using
10:16 - that variable for square we could skip a
10:19 - step and just put that random dot R and
10:23 - range command inside the parentheses of
10:27 - square so it would look like that
10:31 - so we're saying make a square and inside
10:33 - the parentheses of square we're saying
10:36 - pick a random number between 10 and 200
10:39 - you can do it either way both will work
10:43 - the same and it really depends on which
10:46 - one is easier for you to read and
10:48 - understand so it works exactly the same
10:58 - but I will point out it's easy to make a
11:02 - mistake especially when you're first
11:03 - starting out when you do it this way and
11:06 - the reason is that a lot of beginners
11:09 - tend to forget to count their
11:11 - parentheses there always need to be the
11:14 - same number of left and right
11:16 - parentheses they may look odd to you to
11:18 - see two parentheses at the end here
11:20 - that's because they're separate pairs
11:23 - these two parentheses go with random dot
11:25 - R and range and these two parentheses go
11:28 - with the square command I see a lot of
11:32 - students typing this and then wondering
11:35 - why they're getting an error in their
11:37 - program and it's because they left off
11:39 - that last parenthesis so this
11:40 - parenthesis has no match okay let's add
11:47 - one more thing to this program before
11:48 - we're done we have the squares going in
11:52 - at random location and we have the
11:54 - squares being a random size but let's
11:58 - also change the colors to be nice if
12:00 - every square was a different color well
12:02 - we can't pick a random number for color
12:07 - but we can do this
12:09 - at the top of our program we can make a
12:12 - variable called color list and this will
12:15 - just be a list of different colors you
12:18 - can use as many as you like I'll put a
12:21 - few in here
12:25 - okay remember how lists work they have
12:30 - square brackets on the end and each item
12:34 - inside the list is separated by a comma
12:36 - now we have a variable called color list
12:39 - it's just a list of different colors so
12:43 - before we draw the square each time we
12:47 - want to pick a random color and tell
12:49 - Fred to change his color to that well
12:53 - instead of using the random dot Rand
12:55 - range command we're going to use a
12:57 - different one so let's make a variable
12:59 - called Col which is short for color and
13:04 - we're going to pick a random color out
13:07 - of that list the command is random dot
13:09 - choice color lists the random dot choice
13:15 - command says inside the parentheses tell
13:19 - me a list and I'll pick a random one out
13:22 - of it so now this variable is equal to
13:26 - one of these colors red blue whatever
13:31 - now we can tell Fred to set his color to
13:34 - that red color and that should do it
13:41 - let's try it out
14:10 - all right let's stop there go ahead and
14:16 - experiment with this try changing some
14:18 - of the things around instead of a square
14:20 - try defining your own shapes like the
14:23 - star that we made before and I'll see
14:27 - you next time
14:35 - you

welcome back to learning to code with Python less than six today we'll be talking about functions okay to get started I've got a small program here that will draw a square using the loop we learned before if you need to pause the video to catch up go ahead and do that now all right let's run the program so we're all sure we're on the same page but before I do that I'm going to move the Python shell window down here to the corner we only really need this window now to tell us if we have an error otherwise it's just in the way so I'm going to put it there and leave us plenty of room for our program so let's go ahead and run it good it's drawing a square but what if we want to draw more than one square well we could tell the turtle to move some distance and then repeat this loop draw the square again all right if we run that you'll see now we are moving and drawing a second square but what if we wanted to draw a lot of squares it would be kind of a pain to have to copy and paste this loop over and over again wouldn't it be nice if we could just have a command called square and then any time we wanted to draw a square we could just give that command well we can by making something called a function you can think of a function as a way to define your own commands that you can use anytime you want so let's get rid of these loops and let's define our square function we start by saying def which is short for define and then what we want our function to be named well let's just name it square that makes sense right and remember we're defining a command and commands always have

that would be the definition of a square now if we run this program you'll notice that nothing happens why is that well we defined what Square should be but we never told the computer to actually draw a square we just gave it the definition so now that we've defined our command we can use our command so we can say Square and then we could have Fred move some distance and draw another square but there's another problem with our square command every square that we draw is the same size what if I want to draw squares that are bigger or smaller I'd like the square command to work like this or I put a number inside the parentheses and that's how big the square would be so how do I do that well in our definition of the square we need to add to the definition that something will be inside the parentheses and that something will be some number for the size so let's call it size so now whenever we give the square command the number that we put in the parentheses will be inserted here and called size and now instead of going always going forward 100 we should go forward sighs let's see what that looks like Square that's 100 and a square that's 150 so now our square command is finished we can draw a square any size we want anywhere we want so let's do something fun let's draw squares all over the screen so instead of just drawing these two squares I want to draw a whole bunch of them so let's make a loop and let's actually count to a hundred this time before we go any further let's talk about coordinates you've probably seen this in math class but even if you haven't don't worry it's not too complicated if you imagine that this big rectangle is the turtle window and here's the turtle here in the center then every spot on the screen where the turtle can be can be described by two numbers called its coordinates the first number which is called X is where the turtle is horizontally to the left or right as that X number gets bigger the turtle moves to the right as that X number gets smaller the turtle moves to the left and the second number which we call Y describes the vertical or up and down position of the turtle and why gets bigger as the turtle goes up the screen and why gets smaller as the turtle goes down the screen so knowing that we can tell the turtle to go to any spot on the screen by giving it those two numbers of where we want it to be for example if we wanted it to go to 100 comma 50 that would be 100 pixels over this way and 50 pixels up and the turtle would wind up somewhere over here okay so to make our random squares that we want

then we need to do the same thing for y okay so now we have a random number for X and a random number for Y and now we'd like to tell the turtle to go to that coordinate the command to tell the turtle to move to a certain coordinate is go to and then you just tell it the X and the y so we'll say go to that random X&Y that we picked and when you get there draw a square and let's just put 100 for the size of the square right now when we run this program the computers going to count to a hundred and loop around and do these four commands a hundred times pick a random X pick a random Y go to that

the star that we made before and I'll see you next time you
