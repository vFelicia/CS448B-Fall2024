00:01 - welcome to another good Oh recipe in
00:03 - this video we're gonna look at the
00:05 - basics of kinematic body movement in 3d
00:08 - for this demo we're going to use this
00:10 - mini tank model which I found on each
00:13 - dot IO and you can get the link for that
00:16 - below just download this and unzip it in
00:19 - your project folder and when you do
00:23 - you're gonna see it contains some
00:25 - materials and an obj file now I'm going
00:28 - to click import I'm going to change it
00:30 - to import it as a scene and make the
00:32 - route type kinematic body so this is
00:35 - kinematic body and then click re import
00:37 - and that way when you click on the obj
00:39 - it'll say do you want to make an
00:41 - inherited scene yes we do alright now we
00:46 - have our tank now the only problem we
00:48 - have currently is that the tank model
00:53 - was saved with all of the meshes
00:56 - pointing in the positive Z direction but
01:00 - forward in Godot is the negative Z
01:02 - direction so so forward for our
01:05 - kinematic body is this way and I don't
01:09 - want everything to be backwards so I'm
01:11 - just gonna take each of these meshes
01:13 - there's three meshes that make up the
01:15 - tank there's the head or the turret
01:18 - there's the cannon and then there's the
01:21 - body there's also this extra mission
01:24 - since I'm not sure why that's there
01:26 - something from the obj so that one
01:29 - doesn't matter but these three all need
01:31 - to be transformed to rotate 180 degrees
01:35 - around Y so you do that to all three we
01:39 - will be pointing in the right direction
01:41 - relative to our kinematic bodies
01:44 - orientation okay and you can go ahead
01:49 - and save this
01:52 - and we're almost ready to go we're going
01:57 - to need a couple other nodes we're going
02:00 - to need a collision shape and for this
02:04 - I'm just going to use a box shape and
02:07 - we're just gonna size it to go on the
02:12 - turnoff snapping here we're gonna size
02:15 - this for the set for the part of the
02:17 - treads that touch the ground don't
02:21 - really care about the rest of it right
02:23 - now matching the body we could add
02:26 - another collision shape for you know
02:28 - collisions with walls and things like
02:30 - that but we're may only worried about
02:31 - movement so I just want to worry about
02:33 - the part that's on the ground we can
02:35 - actually make this you can make this
02:37 - thinner and drop it down but we want
02:41 - this to cover the ground part of the
02:44 - treads okay then the other thing we're
02:48 - going to add is we're gonna add a
02:51 - position 3d and this position 3d we're
02:55 - gonna call this cam pause this is gonna
02:57 - be a marker for where we want our camera
03:00 - to be and the easiest way to set this up
03:04 - is going to be to temporarily let's add
03:07 - a camera camera to this to this node and
03:11 - we will switch to two viewports set the
03:16 - camera to preview and then in this scene
03:23 - or in this view we can raise the camera
03:25 - up and put it behind see I'm moving the
03:28 - camera position not the camera because
03:30 - we're gonna delete that camera but I
03:32 - just want to put this somewhere up here
03:35 - where it's looking down and behind the
03:39 - tank this is the spot that we're gonna
03:41 - have our chase camera follow the tank
03:44 - and now we can go back to one of you
03:48 - port and delete this camera all right so
03:52 - that's our tank ready to go now we're
03:55 - ready to start working on the code all
03:58 - right so I've attached a script to the
03:59 - tank and I've started by defining some
04:02 - properties we've got gravity so that's
04:05 - how
04:06 - much is gonna be pulled downwards right
04:08 - so we want that pointing downwards and I
04:10 - gave it a scale of 10 we have speed this
04:13 - is how quickly the tank will move
04:15 - forward and back and rotation speed is
04:19 - how fast it's going to rotate when we
04:20 - press left and right the tank is going
04:22 - to rotate around its center by the
04:25 - treads moving in opposite directions and
04:26 - then we have a velocity which is our is
04:30 - going to be our movement vector and I've
04:32 - declared these with export because that
04:34 - makes them easy to edit in the inspector
04:38 - if you ever want to change these things
04:40 - export makes that convenient right a
04:43 - movement code is very simple and if
04:47 - you've used 2d kinematic bodies it's
04:49 - gonna look pretty much identical we're
04:53 - gonna add gravity to our down to our
04:56 - velocity gravity points downwards so
04:58 - that's gonna pull us downwards and then
05:00 - we're gonna call the kinematic bodies
05:03 - move and slide with an up vector defined
05:07 - and again we're using just like we did
05:09 - with down we're using the predefined
05:11 - constant for 0 comma 1 comma 0 now the
05:17 - only thing we need after this is we need
05:19 - to check which keys the player is
05:22 - pressing so we're gonna add a get input
05:26 - method which Renee to define and what
05:34 - this method does is going to check what
05:35 - Keys you're pressing now we want the
05:40 - tank to stop moving when we are not
05:44 - pressing any keys but that doesn't apply
05:47 - to gravity right gravity should always
05:48 - be accelerating us downwards if we go
05:50 - off a a ledge will fall downwards that
05:53 - kind of thing so we don't want to reset
05:56 - our velocity every frame right we're
05:58 - continuing it and maintaining it from
06:01 - frame to frame so that it can increase
06:03 - if it needs to but we do want to zero
06:06 - out the X and the Z directions because
06:09 - those are going to be what come from
06:10 - input so if we take the velocities out Y
06:16 - and we store it in a variable
06:19 - at the end we can set it back unchanged
06:24 - and then we can just zero out our
06:27 - velocity to vector 3.0 and worry about
06:34 - changing the x and z directions based on
06:38 - input so we're gonna have four possible
06:42 - inputs and here those are I've defined
06:45 - those in the input map forward back
06:48 - right and left which are going to be W
06:51 - and s a and D now what do we want to do
06:55 - when we press each of them when we press
06:56 - forward we want to move forward it
06:59 - doesn't mean we want to move in the
07:01 - negative Z globalaccess we want to move
07:04 - in the kinematic bodies negative z-axis
07:07 - so we want to take our velocity and we
07:10 - want to add the negative transform basis
07:16 - does e which is the local forward vector
07:20 - times speed and we do the same thing
07:24 - with back except it's not the negative
07:29 - direction and just in case that's not
07:31 - clear to you let's jump over to the 3d
07:33 - view again for a second now put us in
07:36 - global space mode now when the tank is
07:39 - pointing along the z axis then the tank
07:42 - moving forward is the same as moving
07:45 - along z axis but if the tank were to
07:48 - rotate and point this way we don't want
07:51 - to press forward and move this way right
07:55 - we want to move straight ahead and so
07:59 - you can visualize this if you turn on
08:01 - this button which local space local
08:03 - space shows you the tanks basis which is
08:08 - its Y X and z axes and now you can see
08:12 - even though we've turned 45 degrees to
08:14 - the right forward for the tank is still
08:18 - its negative z-axis it doesn't matter
08:21 - what direction I turn the tank in its
08:24 - local z-axis is going to be pointing the
08:26 - way we want it to point
08:32 - okay that's what we're doing in the code
08:35 - by using transform dub basis stud Z and
08:39 - then right on the left are going to be
08:41 - about rotating so we want to rotate
08:46 - around the y axis by our rotation speed
08:52 - now our rotation speed just positive or
08:57 - negative depending on which direction
08:58 - but just like with any other kind of
09:02 - movement it's always a good idea to use
09:06 - Delta here so that you will rotate at a
09:09 - consistent speed in frames depending on
09:13 - the frame rate but the problem is that
09:15 - Delta is not going to be defined in the
09:20 - input so when we call it we need to pass
09:24 - it all right then we can do this for
09:28 - both left and right which will be the
09:34 - opposite okay so now we have all four
09:37 - directions and that's all we need for
09:39 - our kinematic movement all right here's
09:42 - our test scene to try it out so I've
09:45 - made a mesh instance with a plain mesh
09:49 - and then used the create static body to
09:53 - give it a static body so it'll be solid
09:55 - then I've added a directional light just
09:58 - to give us a little bit of lighting in
09:59 - the scene so that's not so bland
10:01 - looking's without the light it looks
10:04 - pretty dull and then I've added an
10:06 - interpolated camera and the way the
10:09 - interpolated camera works is if we set
10:11 - its target and click here and choose the
10:14 - can pause and enable it then as this cam
10:19 - paws moves around right it's attached to
10:21 - the tank so the cam pause is gonna move
10:24 - it's gonna move with it and always be
10:26 - above and behind it the interpolated
10:30 - camera will move smoothly move to match
10:34 - that point if you move fast it'll slowly
10:38 - catch up if you move slowly it'll stay
10:40 - with it and that'll make it easy for us
10:42 - to see
10:43 - we're going so let's give it a shot if
10:45 - we run this scene
10:46 - there's our tank press forward the tank
10:49 - goes forward right and left tank rotates
10:53 - and you can see forward does what we
10:56 - want so that's all there is to it to
11:00 - making a simple basic starter kinematic
11:05 - controller in 3d and like I said before
11:10 - if you've done this in 2d you can see
11:12 - it's very very similar feel free to take
11:15 - a look there's some other recipes on the
11:18 - way of doing more with this tank like
11:21 - turning it into an actual tank that can
11:23 - rotate its turret and shoot being able
11:25 - to climb up and down terrain not just
11:30 - flat surfaces and things like that but
11:32 - those will be for other videos in the
11:35 - meantime thanks for watching I hope this
11:37 - was helpful and I'll see you in a future
11:38 - video this tutorial is part of my new
11:40 - Godot recipes website the goal is to
11:43 - collect all the best tips and lessons to
11:45 - help make you a better at Godot

for us to see we're going so let's give it a shot if we run this scene there's our tank press forward the tank goes forward right and left tank rotates and you can see forward does what we want so that's all there is to it to making a simple basic starter kinematic controller in 3d and like I said before if you've done this in 2d you can see it's very very similar feel free to take a look
