00:00 - welcome back to Godot 101 this is part
00:02 - 12 and in this video we're going to
00:04 - explore how to add a scrolling camera
00:08 - that follows your player and also make a
00:10 - scrolling background alright let's get
00:13 - started so here we have our simple
00:16 - platformer setup and so now I want to
00:19 - take a look at what would happen if we
00:21 - had our screen laid out like this I'm
00:23 - going to duplicate this platform a
00:25 - couple more times and I'm going to move
00:28 - them and just sort of arrange them kind
00:31 - of like this all right so now my I want
00:35 - my character to be able to run along and
00:37 - jump on all four of these platforms but
00:39 - of course these are going to be off the
00:40 - screen right when we run it we can't see
00:42 - those and I would just go off the screen
00:47 - and that's no good so I want to have a
00:51 - camera that will follow the player
00:54 - wherever it goes in the game world and
00:57 - that's really easy to do with Godot
01:00 - because we have a camera node here's our
01:02 - player scene we're going to hit add and
01:05 - we're going to add a camera 2d this is
01:08 - the camera to denote the camera 2d we're
01:11 - going to rename it to camera and all we
01:15 - need to do on this node to get it to
01:17 - work is go down here and check the box
01:20 - next to it that says current current to
01:23 - be on and you could have multiple
01:26 - cameras in your scene but only one of
01:30 - them can be the current one and that's
01:32 - the one that you know the View window
01:33 - will track so if we hit play now you can
01:39 - already see but now the screen is
01:43 - scrolling as we move along couldn't get
01:49 - easier all right so it's very simple to
01:51 - just set up and and use the camera now
01:55 - there's lots of settings on the camera
01:57 - things like dragging and things like
02:00 - that and that's sort of how how you want
02:03 - the camera to act right so for example
02:04 - if I turn on smoothing here alright so
02:08 - now instead of the camera tracking my
02:11 - player
02:13 - instantly it's going to slowly catch up
02:16 - to see when I move the camera just sort
02:18 - of panned along and catches up to me so
02:21 - just smooth smooth that movement out and
02:23 - you can set the speed for how quickly
02:26 - that movement happens and and all that
02:28 - kind of stuff you can in the drag margin
02:32 - here you can set how far from the edges
02:35 - you want the character to be able to
02:39 - walk before the camera starts scrolling
02:41 - right and you can set those to zero and
02:46 - have it not even work right you could
02:47 - have it only scroll so I decide not to
02:49 - not do the up-and-down scrolling like
02:51 - this a lot of things you can play with
02:53 - and I recommend you you you mess around
02:56 - with these right you can turn on and off
02:57 - these things tries try changing the
02:59 - different settings around and see how it
03:01 - works and how you can customize it to
03:03 - give you the look that you want for your
03:06 - game once you have the camera working
03:08 - the way you want it now we need to talk
03:10 - about what do we do about the background
03:12 - if you can see obviously we scroll far
03:15 - enough we get past the edges of the
03:17 - background and we don't see it anymore
03:19 - so if we look at our main scene here our
03:23 - background image is this this is the
03:26 - size of it so if we want it to extend we
03:30 - can a couple things we could do you
03:32 - could obviously take another pic of
03:34 - sprite and duplicate it and put another
03:36 - one next to it right and then you would
03:39 - see it but rather than do that we're
03:40 - going to take advantage of the fact that
03:42 - this this piece of art was drawn in such
03:46 - a way that it is tigh leveled at the the
03:48 - left-hand edge and the right-hand edge
03:49 - if you put them right next to each other
03:51 - there's no transition and they meet up
03:55 - well so it's designed to be to be tiled
03:58 - horizontally so if we look at our
04:01 - texture here we can go we can click the
04:04 - little right arrow and go to the flag
04:06 - section and if we go down here we make
04:09 - sure we have repeat selected you might
04:13 - not on yours if you have repeat selected
04:15 - that tells it that this is a repeatable
04:17 - texture and now if we go back here and
04:22 - turn region to on right now my back
04:26 - under
04:26 - here because it became really small
04:28 - because the region rectangle by default
04:30 - is set to zero width and zero height so
04:33 - what I'm going to do is I'm going to set
04:34 - the height to the height of the image
04:37 - which is 1536
04:40 - that's how I'll call the original
04:42 - texture is and for the width the width
04:45 - is 307 - all right so if I set that
04:49 - there we have our original image back if
04:53 - I wanted to tile further I can just make
04:55 - this with larger right if I multiply it
04:58 - by 4 then the image is going to become 4
05:03 - times wider and because the repeat flag
05:06 - is on we will see the image just
05:10 - repeating over and over again all right
05:13 - and then you can also drag that to where
05:15 - you want it to be if we want to place it
05:17 - so that there's plenty of image to the
05:22 - left so you don't see any gray when the
05:25 - player is all the way on the left-hand
05:26 - side of the platform here but also when
05:29 - they get over here to the right they
05:32 - still will see the background and that's
05:36 - going to look fine but there's one more
05:40 - improvement we can make right as well as
05:43 - having the background scrolling back
05:46 - there it would look even cooler if it
05:49 - scrolled at a slightly slower speed than
05:52 - our player moves and this is called
05:56 - parallax scrolling it makes it look like
06:00 - the things in the background are a much
06:02 - farther distance away so they'll only
06:04 - scroll a little bit as you move from
06:08 - side to side so if I go back here and go
06:12 - to add node and I search for parallax
06:15 - you can see we have two different nodes
06:18 - that come up the parallax background and
06:21 - the parallax layer and so what you do to
06:25 - set this up is you use the parallax
06:27 - background so we're going to add that
06:30 - and to that parallax background we're
06:35 - going to add a parallax layer now
06:38 - parallax backgrounds can
06:39 - multiple layers because what that lets
06:41 - you do is have different different
06:44 - layers scrolling at different speeds and
06:46 - things like that to get really really
06:48 - advanced looking effects but we will put
06:51 - the background now into that parallax
06:53 - layer okay so now our background is part
06:56 - of the parallax layer and we can go here
07:01 - and say what we how we want it to move
07:04 - right how we want it to change and for
07:09 - example under motion we can choose what
07:12 - scale we want to use right if we put
07:15 - this to zero the pop-up tells us right
07:19 - here if the axis fit to zero it will not
07:21 - move at all it'll stick with the camera
07:22 - so it won't change but right now we have
07:26 - it set to one so let's see what happens
07:28 - when we run it it looks pretty much the
07:35 - same right but if we set this to half
07:44 - now the motion is scaled at half the
07:47 - speed but the camera moves now do you
07:51 - see that see how the the background is
07:53 - scrolling much slower all right very
07:59 - nice looking effect very easy to create
08:03 - well looks really cool that's it so feel
08:09 - free to play around with this you know
08:11 - if you change the change the scale and
08:13 - and how it runs if we change to point
08:16 - two here
08:17 - right and then it looks like it's hardly
08:19 - moving at all
08:20 - running all the way across all four
08:24 - platforms barely moves that background
08:25 - very much so it makes it feel like it's
08:28 - much farther away in the distance
08:31 - and if you want to wanted to add another
08:33 - parallax layer in between you could have
08:36 - that scroll by at a still different
08:39 - speed feel free to experiment I hope it
08:43 - all made sense to you please post in the
08:45 - comments below if you have any questions
08:47 - and I'll see you next time
08:56 - you

welcome back to Godot 101 this is part 12 and in this video we're going to explore how to add a scrolling camera that follows your player and also make a scrolling background alright let's get started so here we have our simple platformer setup and so now I want to take a look at what would happen if we had our screen laid out like this I'm going to duplicate this platform a couple more times and

be to be tiled horizontally so if we look at our texture here we can go we can click the little right arrow and go to the flag section and if we go down here we make sure we have repeat selected you might not on yours if you have repeat selected that tells it that this is a repeatable texture and now if we go back here and turn region to on right now my back under here because it became really small because the region rectangle by default is set to zero width and zero height so what I'm going to do is I'm going to set the height to the height of the image which is 1536 that's how I'll call the original texture is and for the width the width is 307 all right so if I set that there we have our original image back if I wanted to tile further I can just make this with larger right if I multiply it by 4 then the image is going to become 4 times wider and because the repeat flag is on we will see the image just repeating over and over again all right and then you can also drag that to where you want it to be if we want to place it so that there's plenty of image to the left so you don't see any gray when the player is all the way on the lefthand side of the platform here but also when they get over here to the right they still will see the background and that's going to look fine but there's one more improvement we can make right as well as having the background scrolling back there it would look even cooler if it scrolled at a slightly slower speed than our player moves and this is called parallax scrolling it makes it look like the things in the background are a much
