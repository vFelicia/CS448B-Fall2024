00:00 - welcome back to good old recipes this
00:02 - time we're gonna be addressing a very
00:04 - common question which is how to attach
00:08 - 2d textures and objects like health bars
00:12 - and things to 3d objects in a 3d space
00:17 - alright let's get started to start with
00:20 - I have a regular old 2d health bar here
00:22 - made with a progress texture that's just
00:25 - configured to change color as it gets
00:29 - smaller as some value decreases and I've
00:34 - demonstrated making 2d health bars
00:35 - before you can check the links in the
00:38 - description below so I'm not going to
00:40 - spend any more time on that but what we
00:42 - want to do for this tutorial is see how
00:44 - we can add this kind of health bar above
00:48 - a unit in 3d so to demonstrate this I've
00:52 - mocked up a 3d mob that spawns and walks
00:56 - in a random direction and when you click
00:58 - on it ten times it will disappear so
01:01 - that health that value is what we want
01:04 - to display in a little bar above the mob
01:07 - to begin our 3d health bar we're going
01:09 - to start with a sprite 3d now sprite 3d
01:12 - displays a texture just like a 2d one
01:14 - does I'll call this health bar 3d and we
01:18 - will drag our texture into its texture
01:21 - property and just like any 3d node as
01:26 - you pan the camera around you're gonna
01:28 - see it from different angles and we
01:31 - don't want that we don't want to see our
01:32 - texture on edge like this we want it to
01:34 - always be facing us no matter how we
01:38 - rotate the camera and you can do that
01:41 - you could do that with some ray casting
01:43 - and rotating the node but there's a an
01:45 - easier way to do that called billboard
01:47 - mode we can enable billboard mode by
01:51 - adding a material and so go over to
01:54 - geometry instance under geometry under
01:58 - material override expand this a little
02:01 - bit material override we're gonna add a
02:03 - new spatial material and in that spatial
02:08 - material under flags we're going to set
02:11 - transparent to on
02:13 - that way our the transparency that's
02:17 - part of our texture will apply we're
02:21 - gonna set it to unshaded we don't want
02:24 - shadows and things like that to apply to
02:27 - this and then we're going to go down to
02:30 - parameters and set billboard mode
02:34 - enabled now when we move the camera you
02:39 - see how our texture is always facing the
02:42 - camera so that part is now working the
02:47 - way we want it to so now on our mob we
02:49 - can go over here and we can attach the
02:51 - health bar 3d to our mob move it up so
02:56 - it's above the mob and an appropriate
02:59 - place you want it and now we have a
03:01 - health bar that displays when we play
03:04 - the game will see our mobs have health
03:10 - bars above them and you can see as we
03:13 - rotate the camera around that billboard
03:14 - mode is now making sure that those
03:18 - health bars are always facing us now we
03:21 - don't actually want our health bar to
03:22 - display the static green bar we want it
03:25 - to display our 2d health bar which can
03:29 - reduce in size and change in color so
03:32 - we're going to render that 2d scene in
03:36 - our health bars texture in order to do
03:40 - that we're going to add a viewport so at
03:44 - a viewport as a child of the health bar
03:46 - 3d and then under it we're going to
03:49 - instance our 2d health bar in our
03:53 - viewport settings we're going to set the
03:55 - size of the viewport to match the size
03:57 - of that texture and so that's 200 by 26
04:03 - and then we're gonna set transparent to
04:06 - on under rendering or it's going to set
04:08 - usage to 2d this is important if you're
04:11 - if you have a view ports only rendering
04:13 - in 2d setting it to 2d can be a big
04:16 - performance benefit letting the renderer
04:20 - know that it doesn't have to do any 3d
04:22 - calculations into that viewport and then
04:24 - also on render target when you said
04:27 - flipped on that is because by default if
04:32 - we didn't hit this all of our textures
04:34 - rendering our viewport would be upside
04:36 - down so it just flips it vertically so
04:38 - now we have our viewport configured and
04:41 - it's going to render whatever is a child
04:44 - of it which is our health bar 2d and we
04:46 - want that viewports texture to be our
04:49 - health bar texture here in our sprite 3d
04:53 - now we could do that manually right here
04:58 - by adding a viewport texture however
05:01 - that will give us an error because
05:03 - because the viewport is a child of the
05:06 - sprite it won't be ready yet at runtime
05:09 - to be able to be used for the texture so
05:12 - we're gonna need to set it in code so
05:15 - add a script to your health bar 3d and
05:17 - in ready we're gonna set texture texture
05:21 - property of the sprite 3d equal to the
05:22 - viewports texture and that's all there
05:25 - is to it now it'll do it when the sprite
05:29 - 3d is ready which is going to happen
05:31 - after the viewport is ready so now we
05:34 - need to connect this up so that clicking
05:37 - on the mob updates tells this health bar
05:40 - to update so we're also going to add a
05:42 - little bit of code to pass that update
05:46 - notification down to the 2d health bar
05:49 - and the 2d health bar has an update bar
05:53 - function where you just send it the
05:55 - amount and the max and it will fill in
06:00 - the health bar appropriately and so on
06:03 - our health bar 3d we're gonna do the
06:05 - same thing we're gonna call give it an
06:08 - update call so that our mob can say hey
06:10 - 3d health bar update yourself and it
06:13 - will pass that through to the health bar
06:15 - 2d and it's update method all that
06:21 - remains after that is on the mob to tell
06:24 - it when it takes damage tell that 3d
06:27 - health bar to update and that is all
06:30 - there is to it now if we run we should
06:33 - be able to see this all working the way
06:35 - we want
06:36 - there's our bar when I click on my mob
06:39 - it goes
06:40 - down and everything is working the way
06:45 - we want so you can use this technique
06:48 - with any kind of 2d texture or object
06:52 - that you want to render above or around
06:54 - or in your 3d space alright this could
06:56 - be a label displaying some text like a
06:59 - name tag this could be a radial texture
07:03 - this could be any kind of control node
07:07 - or 2d know that you want to use this
07:10 - tutorial is part of my nugudo recipes
07:12 - website the goal is to collect all the
07:14 - best tips and lessons to help make you a

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back to good old recipes this time we're gonna be addressing a very common question which is how to attach 2d textures and objects like health bars and things to 3d objects in a 3d space alright let's get started to start with I have a regular old 2d health bar here made with a progress texture that's just configured to change color as it gets smaller as some value decreases and I've demonstrated making 2d health bars before you can check the links in the description below so I'm not going to spend any more time on that but what we want to do for this tutorial is see how we can add this kind of health bar above a unit in 3d so to demonstrate this I've mocked up a 3d mob that spawns and walks in a random direction and when you click on it ten times it will disappear so that health that value is what we want to display in a little bar above the mob to begin our 3d health bar we're going to start with a sprite 3d now sprite 3d displays a texture just like a 2d one does I'll call this health bar 3d and we will drag our texture into its texture property and just like any 3d node as you pan the camera around you're gonna see it from different angles and we don't want that we don't want to see our texture on edge like this we want it to always be facing us no matter how we rotate the camera and you can do that you could do that with some ray casting and rotating the node but there's a an easier way to do that called billboard mode we can enable billboard mode by adding a material and so go over to geometry instance under geometry under material override expand this a little bit material override we're gonna add a new spatial material and in that spatial material under flags we're going to set transparent to on that way our the transparency that's part of our texture will apply we're gonna set it to unshaded we don't want shadows and things like that to apply to this and then we're going to go down to parameters and set billboard mode enabled now when we move the camera you see how our texture is always facing the camera so that part is now working the way we want it to so now on our mob we can go over here and we can attach the health bar 3d to our mob move it up so it's above the mob and an appropriate place you want it and now we have a health bar that displays when we play the game will see our mobs have health bars above them and you can see as we rotate the camera around that billboard mode is now making sure that those health bars are always facing us now we don't actually want our health bar to display the static green bar we want it to display our 2d health bar which can reduce in size and change in color so we're going to render that 2d scene in our health bars texture in order to do that we're going to add a viewport
