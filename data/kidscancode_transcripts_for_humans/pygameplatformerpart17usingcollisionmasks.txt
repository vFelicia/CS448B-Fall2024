00:00 - welcome back to game development with
00:02 - pame this is part 17 of our platformer
00:06 - game and in this video we're going to
00:09 - talk
00:10 - about how to use masks to do what's
00:14 - called Pixel Perfect
00:17 - Collision okay in the last video we
00:20 - added some enemies to our game and if
00:22 - you've played it very much you've
00:24 - probably noticed that the enemy
00:27 - collisions don't work quite right if I
00:30 - can get an example here I'll see if I
00:32 - can get
00:34 - the a collision to happen like I'm
00:37 - talking
00:42 - about
00:43 - maybe yeah there was one let's try
00:49 - again there we go did you see that so
00:53 - looked like I died even though the two
00:55 - Sprites didn't
00:57 - touch and the reason that's happening is
01:00 - because of the type of collision we're
01:03 - doing you might remember this slide if
01:05 - you watched the video where we made the
01:08 - shooter game the standard Collision in
01:11 - pame is called an AABB Collision axis
01:15 - align bounding box we use the bounding
01:17 - box of the Sprite Which is the rectangle
01:20 - that encloses the entire Sprite and we
01:23 - just see if those two rectangles overlap
01:27 - and this is great because it's really
01:30 - fast so the computer can do a lot of
01:33 - these
01:34 - comparisons really fast without
01:36 - introducing any lag or uh or slowing
01:39 - down your game and that's fine but like
01:43 - in our jumper game you get this
01:44 - situation where the player
01:47 - dies and they feel bad because it
01:50 - doesn't look like they got
01:52 - hit and so one solution to that which is
01:55 - what we did in our shooter game was we
01:58 - used um circular bounding boxes and so
02:02 - it's a collision if the two circles
02:05 - intersect and you can set the size of
02:06 - the circle to be something
02:10 - reasonable and um and get collisions
02:12 - that look a little
02:14 - better but this also has a problem
02:16 - because not every not every Sprite fits
02:19 - well inside a rectangle or a circle so
02:23 - you need some more options so one option
02:26 - you can do is you can use
02:30 - another type of collision which is uh a
02:33 - ratio so you can take the rectangle or
02:35 - the circle ratio I mean the rectangle or
02:38 - the circle Collision function and you
02:40 - can pass in a
02:42 - ratio and what this does is just scale
02:45 - the circle or the Box by whatever number
02:48 - you pick and and you know 7even 7 here
02:51 - would be 70% and so you can see the
02:54 - boxes got smaller the circles got
02:57 - smaller and that can work
03:00 - but you're still having to deal with
03:03 - things like the Box being centered on
03:04 - the Sprite Which might not align it
03:06 - right you don't get a lot of
03:10 - control so in the cases where this isn't
03:14 - enough then we have a third option and
03:17 - that third option is something called a
03:23 - mask okay to demonstrate the mask I've
03:26 - made a little example program here so we
03:28 - have our player
03:30 - the bunny and we have the the enemy and
03:33 - I've shown the bounding Boxes by these
03:36 - little white rectangles so right now our
03:38 - problem is if I move this over that this
03:40 - is a collision in our current setup this
03:45 - is a collision so you're hit even if you
03:49 - have this much space in between and we
03:51 - don't want that
03:52 - so to do what's called Pixel Perfect
03:56 - Collision meaning I want to know if
03:59 - exact this bunny shape hits exactly this
04:03 - enemy shape we can create something
04:05 - called a mask and a mask looks like
04:09 - this so when we tell pame to create a
04:12 - mask it looks at the pixels of the of
04:17 - the object and it ignores the background
04:19 - so remember we said set the color key to
04:21 - Black so it's ignoring this black
04:23 - background and it's just keeping track
04:26 - of
04:27 - where the pixels are
04:30 - in the
04:31 - shape okay and
04:34 - so I'm actually going to turn that off
04:36 - and I'm just going to put on I'm just
04:38 - going to show the outline of the Mask so
04:40 - this is the outline of each sprite's
04:44 - mask and now you can see if you look up
04:47 - here where it says whether we've hit or
04:49 - not we're not going to detect a hit
04:52 - until those two masks intersect like
04:58 - that and so now this is a hit if I were
05:02 - to be down
05:04 - lower this would be a hit
05:08 - there and so what the computer is doing
05:10 - is it's going along and looking at the
05:12 - bunny and
05:13 - saying where's the first point where I
05:19 - see the bunny pixels overlap with or the
05:23 - bunny's mask overlap with the enemy's
05:26 - mask and that's what this point is here
05:28 - and it can even tell us what point that
05:30 - was this is the coordinates on the bunny
05:34 - uh Sprite so it's 10 pixels over and 83
05:37 - pixels down now we don't really need to
05:39 - know this location but you can imagine
05:42 - sometimes if you have things hitting you
05:43 - might want a little explosion to to show
05:45 - over here or something to happen at the
05:47 - location of the hit we don't really need
05:49 - that we just want to know that we
05:51 - actually had these two Sprites run into
05:53 - each other okay and so that's what we're
05:55 - going to set up on our game right now
05:59 - the only other thing you need to know
06:01 - about mask collisions is compared to the
06:05 - rectangle they are very expensive and
06:08 - what I mean by expensive is they take a
06:11 - lot longer for the computer to calculate
06:15 - so it's having to do a lot more checking
06:17 - now in our case for this uh jumper game
06:19 - we're never going to have more than one
06:22 - or two enemies on the screen at the same
06:24 - time so checking the the player against
06:28 - two of these enemies we're never going
06:30 - to notice any kind of slowdown but if
06:33 - you had a game where you had hundreds of
06:34 - bullets flying around and enemies and
06:36 - lots of stuff going on uh you could
06:38 - start to have this create lag really
06:41 - fast so the way that uh people typically
06:44 - solve that problem when they they want
06:48 - Pixel Perfect Collision but they also
06:49 - want it to be fast is you do rectangle
06:52 - collisions first so in case of here
06:55 - there was no Collision we just move on
06:58 - if there was a rectangle Collision
07:00 - then you do a mask Collision so that way
07:03 - if this situation happens you'll find it
07:07 - but you're not doing any mask testing
07:10 - when things are way out here like this
07:13 - so you get to you get the speed of the
07:15 - rectangle Collision kind of narrowing
07:17 - down your options and then you if two
07:20 - things are close to each other like this
07:22 - then you check to see if they actually
07:24 - collided um we don't need to do that in
07:26 - this program because we're not going to
07:28 - have that performance problem but it's
07:29 - something to keep in mind if you decide
07:31 - to do any mask style collisions like
07:35 - this okay so let's go and add this to
07:37 - our
07:39 - code so you'll see this is going to be
07:42 - really easy we just need to go over to
07:44 - our Sprites and we're going to go to the
07:47 - player
07:48 - Sprite and now the player Sprites the
07:50 - player sprite's image changes all the
07:52 - time right so depending on what we are
07:56 - doing as we're moving so I'm going to go
07:58 - down to where we do the anim
08:00 - right so here is where we pick
08:05 - which image we're going to use right we
08:08 - either load the walking frames or the
08:12 - standing frames do the idle animation
08:14 - and we pick whichever one of those that
08:16 - is and we set our image to that so since
08:21 - we've changed our image I'm just going
08:23 - to put at the end here we're going to
08:25 - set our mask and it just has to be
08:26 - called self. mask if it's called self.
08:28 - mask the Collide function will find
08:32 - it and so you can create the mask in a
08:35 - couple of different ways but the easiest
08:39 - way is to just say create it from
08:42 - surface and tell it to use the self.
08:45 - image okay and we don't need the
08:47 - threshold option we can go into that
08:50 - later so this is just going to make a
08:52 - mask from whatever our image is which
08:55 - we've Now set to whichever frame we're
08:57 - on so we do that that with the player
09:01 - and then we're actually going to do the
09:02 - same thing with the
09:05 - mob uh it has the same issue because
09:08 - we're changing the the the image it only
09:11 - has two but we are changing them so
09:13 - we're going to make our
09:14 - mask update to match the frame we're
09:19 - on this is the same thing from
09:22 - surface from our image and I don't need
09:25 - that okay so now both of these Sprites
09:28 - have masks and all we have to do is go
09:31 - over to our
09:34 - Collision here in the update to see if
09:36 - we hit a mob and say now we want to
09:40 - collide the player with the mobs but we
09:42 - want to
09:44 - use the pg. sprite. Collide
09:49 - mask um we want to use the Collide mask
09:53 - function okay and now if we run this we
09:56 - will see what happens
09:59 - [Music]
10:00 - okay so let's wait for a mob to spawn
10:04 - that I
10:05 - can run into there we go you see how it
10:08 - overlapped so let's try a couple
10:11 - more so our collisions are
10:15 - working H did you see how close I got
10:17 - there so I was really close I was inside
10:19 - the bounding box for sure on that one
10:21 - but it didn't count as a
10:24 - Collide yeah see I'm not colliding until
10:26 - I
10:28 - actually M intersecting so that's all
10:31 - there is to mass
10:33 - collisions so hopefully you're thinking
10:35 - to yourself that was pretty easy all we
10:37 - did
10:38 - was really three lines of code adding a
10:41 - mask on each Sprite was one was one
10:44 - command and then we just use the Collide
10:46 - mask function and we instantly get that
10:49 - much better Collision so if you want to
10:52 - try this out and do this on your game if
10:54 - you're making something else uh just
10:55 - remember to keep in mind that
10:57 - performance issue if you have tons of
10:59 - Sprites flying around the screen uh this
11:01 - can start to get slow and really hurt
11:04 - your frame rate so uh if you if you do
11:07 - have that problem remember to just do go
11:10 - back to doing a a rectangle Collision if
11:13 - you have a rectangle Collision then do a
11:16 - mask collision and that should help
11:18 - quite a bit with your performance all
11:20 - right I hope you enjoyed the video I
11:22 - hope you learned something uh please
11:24 - like the video below that helps other
11:26 - people find it and make sure you
11:28 - subscribe so you can see the next video
11:30 - when it comes out all right thanks for

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back to game development with pame this is part 17 of our platformer game and in this video we're going to talk about how to use masks to do what's called Pixel Perfect Collision okay in the last video we added some enemies to our game and if you've played it very much you've probably noticed that the enemy collisions don't work quite right if I can get an example here I'll see if I can get the a collision to happen like I'm talking about maybe yeah there was one let's try again there we go did you see that so looked like I died even though the two Sprites didn't touch and the reason that's happening is because of the type of collision we're doing you might remember this slide if you watched the video where we made the shooter game the standard Collision in pame is called an AABB

it's really fast so the computer can do a lot of these comparisons really fast without introducing any lag or uh or slowing down your game and that's fine but like in our jumper game you get this situation where the player dies and they feel bad because it doesn't look like they got hit and so one solution to that which is what we did in our shooter game was we used um circular bounding boxes and so it's a collision if the two circles intersect and you can set the size of the circle to be something reasonable and um and get collisions that look a little better but this also has a problem because not every not every Sprite fits well inside a rectangle or a circle so you need some more options so one option you can do is you can use another type of collision which is uh a ratio so you can take the rectangle or the circle ratio I mean the rectangle or the circle Collision function and you can pass in a ratio and what this does is just scale the circle or the Box by whatever number you pick and and you know 7even 7 here would be 70% and so you can see the boxes got smaller the circles got smaller and that can work but you're still having to deal with things like the Box being centered on the Sprite Which might not align it right you don't get a lot of control so in the cases where this isn't enough then we have a third option and that third option is something called a

pame to create a mask it looks at the pixels of the of the object and it ignores the background so remember we said set the color key to Black so it's ignoring this black background and it's just keeping track of where the pixels are in the shape okay and so I'm actually going to turn that off and I'm just going to put on I'm just going to show the outline of the Mask so this is the outline of each sprite's mask and now you can see if you look up here where it says whether we've hit or not we're not going to detect a hit until those two masks intersect like that and so now this is a hit if I were to be down lower this would be a hit there and so what the computer is doing is it's going along and looking at the bunny and saying where's the first point where I see the bunny pixels overlap with or the bunny's mask overlap with the enemy's mask and that's what this point is here and it can even tell us what point that was this is the coordinates on the bunny uh Sprite so it's 10 pixels over and 83 pixels down now we don't really need to know this location but you can imagine sometimes if you have things hitting you might want a little explosion to to show over here or something to happen at the location of the hit we don't really need that we just want to know that we actually had these two Sprites run into each other okay and so that's what we're going to set up on our game
