00:00 - hey welcome back to game development PI
00:02 - game this is part 13 of our shmups game
00:05 - series and we're continuing to work on
00:08 - our power-ups the last time we added
00:14 - some power-ups that would randomly drop
00:17 - from the mobs when we shoot them and we
00:20 - have the shield powerup adding back to
00:23 - our shield when we pick it up but the
00:26 - gun powerup the little lightning bolt
00:27 - doesn't do anything right now so we're
00:30 - gonna fix that so if we look at the game
00:35 - right now when we shoot we're shooting a
00:38 - single bullet so there's a lot of
00:41 - different things we could do with the
00:42 - powerup but one of them could be that
00:44 - when we pick it up we've switched to
00:46 - firing - bullets one out of each of the
00:49 - little wing tips so we need to spawn two
00:51 - bullets when we get a gun powerup so I'm
00:58 - just gonna put here that when we pick up
00:59 - the gun powerup we're just gonna do a
01:01 - player dot powerup and then we'll be
01:04 - able to define that to be whatever we
01:06 - want it to be and that'll make it easy
01:07 - for us to customize it change it later
01:09 - if we want so we're gonna go up to the
01:12 - player so here's my player and we're
01:17 - gonna need to define that powerup now
01:19 - what does that mean well we're gonna
01:21 - need a couple of variables as well
01:22 - because I want my power level so we're
01:29 - gonna have a self dot power and that
01:31 - power level is going to start out being
01:32 - level one that's where we started
01:34 - shooting the one bullet when we pick up
01:38 - the powerup it can add one to that and
01:40 - we go up to power level two which means
01:42 - we're gonna shoot two bullets so that's
01:44 - this is what's going to determine what
01:46 - power level we're on we're also gonna
01:48 - have a power timer so that we can keep
01:51 - track of when we picked up the powerup
01:57 - so that we can drop back down to level
01:59 - one when the power when the powerup runs
02:01 - out so it's just a little timer on the
02:03 - powerup okay so we have those two and
02:07 - then we're gonna go down here I'm going
02:10 - to do it in your shoot because it's
02:11 - going to be related
02:13 - so we're gonna define power up and what
02:19 - power up is going to do is it's going to
02:24 - add 1 to the power level and it's going
02:27 - to set the power time we're gonna get
02:37 - tix and we're gonna set them so we're
02:40 - gonna set the power time so we know what
02:42 - time we powered up and now we just need
02:45 - to go to our shoot here and instead of
02:50 - instead of doing just one bullet we're
02:54 - going to do one bullet if we're on power
02:55 - level 1 and we're going to do two
02:57 - bullets if we're on power level 2 so
03:00 - this would be if self dot power equals 1
03:07 - alright we would do that stuff but if
03:14 - power level is 2 then we're gonna spawn
03:18 - 2 bullets
03:21 - okay now that means we want to set 2
03:25 - different bullets at two different
03:26 - locations so bullet and here we'll just
03:31 - copy and paste this and you're gonna see
03:33 - this is gonna be a little bit repetitive
03:35 - and we're gonna clean that up later so
03:37 - don't worry about it right now but so we
03:40 - want to take this bullet right and we
03:43 - want to spawn two of them one of them is
03:47 - going to be at the left of our player
03:54 - spray and one of them is going to be at
03:56 - the right of the player sprite and then
03:59 - where is it gonna spawn we need to spawn
04:02 - it a little lower and turns out if we
04:05 - spawn it at the center Y then it'll look
04:09 - like it's about the right spot and
04:11 - you'll see when we you'll see when we do
04:15 - it how that works so we're gonna have to
04:17 - add both of these so we're gonna add
04:20 - bullet one and bullet two to the
04:23 - appropriate groups
04:27 - okay so now for an entire level one
04:29 - we're going to do this we run parallel
04:30 - to we're going to do this now currently
04:33 - if we are on power level two and another
04:37 - lightning bolt drops we're gonna add one
04:40 - to it so we'd be on power level three we
04:43 - don't really define anything for that
04:44 - and it's up to us to decide whether we
04:47 - want to keep going up with that so I'm
04:49 - gonna just put here greater than or
04:51 - equal to so that way we don't have a
04:56 - power level that's not defined because
04:58 - otherwise we wouldn't be shooting at all
05:00 - if we were on towel three so this way we
05:02 - can just sort of stick to two for now
05:04 - okay so the only other thing we have to
05:07 - do is in our update we just need to
05:09 - check if it's time to drop back down
05:14 - because the timer has run out okay so in
05:19 - the update I'm going to do this time out
05:23 - for power-ups okay we're just gonna say
05:28 - if our power level is greater than level
05:34 - one that's when we care about dropping
05:36 - down right and we get what we get what
05:42 - time it is if that - the self dot power
05:47 - time right the less so however long it's
05:50 - been since the last time we or since we
05:53 - picked up the powerup I should say is
05:55 - greater than some power power uptime
06:00 - variable that we're gonna configure then
06:04 - your power level should drop by one and
06:08 - your power time can reset that way later
06:16 - on if we decide to have three power
06:18 - levels or four or whatever if you're on
06:21 - power level three and it's been that
06:24 - certain amount of time then you're gonna
06:26 - drop down to parallel to and you'll
06:30 - stick it to our level two for a while or
06:32 - for however long that time is okay so we
06:35 - need to define that up here our power
06:38 - our power
06:39 - time let's set that to five seconds so
06:47 - five thousand milliseconds for now okay
06:50 - now let's take a look and see what we
06:53 - see we just need to get a lightning bolt
07:01 - to drop there it is okay so now I'm
07:05 - shooting two bullets at a time and now
07:09 - if we wait for five seconds to go by we
07:11 - should see it drop that to there being
07:14 - one bullet there we go
07:18 - drop back okay
07:22 - so a couple other things to do and one I
07:24 - said I was gonna take the power up and
07:27 - speed them up and maybe I'm gonna put
07:28 - that at O let's try four or maybe even
07:32 - five I just want them to fall a bit
07:35 - faster they were going way too slow and
07:38 - then we also don't have currently a any
07:41 - kind of sound associated with picking up
07:44 - the power ups and that's a little boring
07:47 - you'd be a little more interesting if we
07:49 - could hear a little sound so I'm going
07:52 - to also add some sounds so I added a
07:56 - couple of sounds one for each of the
07:59 - power-ups so I'm gonna go to this
08:04 - section here where we're loading all of
08:05 - our game sounds and we need to load a
08:07 - couple more so I'm just gonna quickly
08:10 - duplicate that and we're gonna call this
08:12 - the shield sound and then we're also
08:15 - going to have the the power sound okay
08:21 - and this one is called
08:23 - POW for dot wave and this one is called
08:29 - v dot wave okay so we just want to play
08:32 - those whenever either those events
08:35 - happen right and so the shield powerup
08:39 - happens when we pick up the shield so we
08:41 - can just right here we power up the
08:47 - shield we play the shield sound
08:53 - when we power up the player we're gonna
08:56 - play the power sound oops power sound
09:03 - play okay let's try that out real quick
09:07 - and see how that sounds good there we go
09:25 - okay okay that's about it for basic
09:35 - power ups obviously there's a lot more
09:38 - things we could do with them the gun
09:40 - powerup could increase your fire speed
09:43 - as well as how many bullet two you do we
09:45 - could have a level three a little four
09:47 - we could even even have different types
09:49 - of gun power ups that do different
09:51 - things and combine in different ways you
09:53 - can get as complex as you want to get
09:55 - with it we could also have other
09:58 - power-ups that give us some lives back
10:01 - since we can lose lives now we could
10:03 - also have something that gives us lives
10:06 - back basically there's a lot of
10:08 - different things we could do and if we
10:10 - think about our game right now we've
10:12 - reached you know about 350 lines of code
10:16 - and we have a lot of features going on
10:18 - there's a lot of things going on you
10:20 - scroll through here there's a lot of
10:21 - code there's a lot of things to keep
10:24 - track of and remember where they are so
10:27 - this is kind of a point you reach in
10:31 - most projects where it's starting to get
10:35 - complex and as you add more things it
10:39 - starts to get complicated to keep track
10:41 - of of everything that's going on and so
10:45 - in our next video we're gonna talk about
10:47 - kind of what should we do at this point
10:50 - to deal with the complexity issue and
10:52 - how can we keep this from getting out of
10:56 - control if we keep adding more things to
10:58 - it all right now I'll see you next time
11:09 - you

hey welcome back to game development PI game this is part 13 of our shmups game series and we're continuing to work on our powerups the last time we added some powerups that would randomly drop from
