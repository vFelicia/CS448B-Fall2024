00:00 - welcome back to game development with
00:01 - pygame this is part 15 of our platformer
00:05 - game and in this video we will be adding
00:08 - power-ups okay so before we go too far
00:14 - into the power-ups there's one thing I
00:17 - wanted to do to talk about about the
00:20 - platform collisions now you may have
00:22 - noticed this and it's kind of should be
00:26 - obvious why it's happening but if you
00:27 - stand over here on the edge you can look
00:29 - like you are floating in space right
00:32 - because there we go so the hitbox of my
00:36 - player is just still barely touching the
00:41 - hitbox of the platform so the you know
00:45 - our code is seeing this as a collision
00:47 - and of course it happens over here too
00:49 - and you know that's a little weird we
00:52 - shouldn't be able to jump when we're
00:54 - standing in them in midair like that so
00:57 - fortunately there's an easy solution to
00:59 - this and since we're using the X the
01:02 - center here as our position for our
01:03 - player we can just say when that
01:05 - position if that position extends past
01:10 - the edge of the platform on either side
01:13 - then we won't collide we won't stop
01:16 - falling okay so we can go down to our
01:20 - platform collision code right and this
01:22 - little this if statement here is what
01:25 - puts us on the top of the platform stops
01:28 - us from falling so basically we'll only
01:30 - want to do that if our player is between
01:34 - the the left and right edge of the
01:37 - platform so we can say if the players
01:42 - pause X is less than the platform that
01:48 - we're hitting right and the player
01:54 - pause X is greater than the lowest rect
02:00 - left now you'll notice this line is
02:04 - getting pretty long right that's a
02:06 - really long line and long long lines are
02:10 - kind of a pain there's a couple
02:12 - things you can do to solve that I mean
02:14 - Python does let you do this if you put a
02:16 - backslash and you continue around then
02:20 - you can you can say this it sees this as
02:26 - one line right so it doesn't count as
02:29 - two separate lines we do want to indent
02:32 - the F now that's not super pretty but
02:35 - it's good enough for now so let's see
02:37 - what this looks like
02:40 - okay so I'm hitting this platform
02:43 - because my exposition is less than this
02:47 - spot and it's greater than this spot so
02:50 - let's go over to a platform where we can
02:52 - fall off now watch as I reach the edge
02:55 - there we go see how so that is not
02:59 - counting as a collision right I'm
03:02 - falling right off the side as soon as my
03:04 - Center gets that site but that doesn't
03:08 - quite look right because my foot should
03:10 - still be touching so we want to give
03:12 - that a little bit extra space so we're
03:16 - gonna say I'm just gonna add a little
03:18 - bit to the little extra ten pixels on
03:22 - either side and I just picked 10 out of
03:26 - thin air just to see what it looks like
03:29 - so let's get up to one where we can fall
03:31 - so now I can walk to there my foot still
03:35 - touching oh and it I fall okay so
03:40 - you can see that looks much better it
03:43 - looks much more natural especially when
03:45 - we walk off the edge that we fall when
03:49 - our feet aren't on the edge supporting
03:52 - us okay on to power ups now power ups
03:59 - are gonna be objects that are gonna that
04:01 - are gonna spawn on the screen and for
04:06 - these I want these power-ups to spawn
04:09 - attached to a platform so I don't want
04:12 - them floating in mid-air or or kind of
04:14 - half overlapping a platform I want them
04:16 - to be resting on platforms like their
04:18 - objects that are sitting there that
04:20 - we'll go find so so when we make the new
04:23 - sprite and I'm just gonna go ahead and
04:24 - I'm gonna copy some of this stuff so I
04:29 - don't have to retype it alright bad
04:35 - indenting there we go
04:39 - okay so so what we want to do is we're
04:44 - gonna call this I'm just gonna call this
04:46 - a pal for powerup okay now when we spawn
04:50 - a powerup we're just gonna pass it a
04:53 - platform that you know we're gonna so
04:56 - we're gonna pass it what platform it
04:58 - needs to be sitting on so that way it'll
05:00 - know where it needs to be and so we're
05:05 - gonna do in itself game will keep track
05:12 - of that platform we don't have a list of
05:16 - images I don't need that but we do need
05:21 - our image sorry so first of all we are
05:24 - gonna have multiple types of platforms
05:26 - now to start with I'm going to do we
05:32 - import yes we imported choice okay
05:37 - I'm gonna just have one platform or I
05:41 - mean I'm sorry one type of power up to
05:44 - start with and that's a boost one that
05:45 - shoots you upwards later we can have
05:49 - more and we can improve this randomness
05:52 - here and choose different random ones
05:53 - what
05:54 - we want to do but for now we're just
05:58 - gonna stick with one and the boost image
06:02 - is going to be over here in our
06:06 - spreadsheet it's this little jetpack so
06:13 - we're gonna use that set the color key
06:15 - to black get the rectangle in our
06:17 - location so our where we place the where
06:25 - we place the powerup sprite is just
06:27 - going to be at the center of the
06:31 - platform and then the bottom of the
06:35 - sprite will be at the top and a little
06:42 - bit up so I just want to look like it's
06:44 - sort of just barely floating right there
06:46 - above it now as far as the update for
06:53 - our sprite we're gonna just make sure we
06:58 - keep we just want to keep the bottom of
07:01 - the sprite at that point right so that
07:06 - way if the put when the platform moves
07:08 - so will the power and if now if we want
07:17 - to delete these these power-ups when the
07:21 - platform disappears right and the
07:22 - platform so the platform's go off the
07:24 - bottom and then they disappear right
07:25 - that means this self dot plat won't
07:29 - exist anymore so we get an error message
07:31 - so we want to make sure we delete the
07:33 - sprite whenever our the powerup sprite
07:37 - whenever the platform sprite gets
07:38 - deleted
07:39 - so we can do that by using the self dot
07:43 - game dot platform's group right that
07:45 - group has a list of all the platform's
07:48 - right and they get removed from that
07:49 - group when they go off the bottom and
07:53 - get deleted so in PI game with groups
07:57 - you can do you can do the halves command
08:00 - and this will return true or false so
08:04 - this this command will be true or false
08:05 - whether the platform
08:08 - in the platform group and if it doesn't
08:10 - so if this is false then we will delete
08:16 - the powerup sprite as well okay so
08:19 - that's our powerup sprite now we have to
08:23 - talk a little bit about groups some more
08:26 - so you recall if I go back over here to
08:30 - our new we have these we have these
08:33 - groups where we are placing the
08:37 - different sprites in right we add the
08:39 - player to the all sprites group when we
08:42 - spawn a platform we added to both groups
08:44 - that starts to get tedious having to do
08:47 - this right we had to do that here down
08:48 - here when we spawn some new platforms we
08:51 - also have to add it to both right well
08:54 - there's an easier way to handle groups
08:58 - and that way is if we go over here
09:02 - actually real quick let me make a we're
09:06 - gonna need a group for power-ups so that
09:07 - we can do the collision so I'm gonna say
09:13 - power-ups is a PG sprite group right now
09:18 - so the game has these three groups and
09:21 - we know we're gonna be wanting to add
09:23 - different sprites to them so we can do
09:24 - that instead of doing it as a separate
09:28 - command every time we spawn the sprite
09:30 - we can do it when the sprite is actually
09:34 - initiated so let's see here so we'll
09:38 - start with our power up here so if we
09:40 - make a list here right when right before
09:46 - and it's important we do this before the
09:48 - sprite class in it okay we name a list
09:54 - of groups so in this case we want game
09:56 - dot all sprites and game dot power-ups
10:00 - right those are the two groups that I
10:03 - want the powerup sprites to be in then I
10:07 - can just adhere to the init that it
10:12 - should do that now if I do that I can do
10:15 - the same thing with the platform's right
10:20 - soft out-groups equals so this is gonna
10:24 - be a game dot all sprites and game dot
10:27 - platforms this makes it a lot easier if
10:34 - later on as your as you're changing
10:38 - things and you add different groups for
10:41 - different kinds of effects or different
10:44 - different code that you want to add that
10:48 - needs more groups you can easily just
10:50 - add here in the sprite a list of which
10:55 - which groups it needs to be a part of
10:57 - okay so if we do that then over here we
11:02 - no longer need this line oops we no
11:08 - longer need that line we no longer need
11:11 - either of these lines and in fact we
11:15 - don't need when we spawn a platform we
11:18 - don't even need to assign it to a
11:19 - variable because it's going to get added
11:21 - to the group so I can do that there and
11:24 - I can do it here as well okay and now
11:34 - everything should still work the same
11:37 - right we're still spawning and the other
11:42 - group collisions and stuff is still
11:43 - working but we've simplified some of our
11:47 - sprite creation and we're ready to do
11:51 - the powerup spawning
11:55 - okay so let's add a couple more game
11:57 - settings over here we're going to add
12:09 - a couple of things here I'm going to add
12:11 - a boost power that we're gonna use for
12:14 - when we how how fast the boost shoots us
12:20 - upwards and we're also going to add a
12:26 - number for how frequently we want these
12:30 - power-ups to spawn so I'm gonna put
12:35 - about something less than ten right so
12:40 - this is how likely every time a platform
12:43 - spawns that it will have it how like it
12:45 - is to have a tower up on it all right
12:48 - so in the platform in it right here when
12:51 - the platform spawns we're just going to
12:54 - give it a chance to have a powerup on it
12:59 - and all we need to do for that is we
13:02 - could pick a random number between 1 and
13:05 - 100 or 0 to 99 technically and if it's
13:09 - less than the power of spawn percentage
13:11 - then we'll spawn a powerup we pass it a
13:15 - copy of self game and we pass it a copy
13:19 - of the platform itself ok and then we
13:28 - are going to need Rand range up here and
13:32 - let's see how that works up there we go
13:37 - so that one spawned and has a plot a
13:39 - powerup on it so now we can see that
13:45 - most of the platforms aren't having
13:47 - power ups on them but every once in a
13:49 - while we got a dry spell here hope
13:52 - there's another one
13:54 - and again once we start responding
13:58 - different kinds of power-ups we can
14:00 - change that percentage around very
14:02 - easily so all that's left is here in our
14:08 - update to just check for collisions with
14:12 - the platform's I mean with the power-ups
14:14 - so we can stick this in here this is
14:24 - going to be if player
14:27 - it's a powerup okay so much like we've
14:34 - done before we're gonna do a sprite
14:36 - collide between the player and the
14:42 - power-ups and we want the power-ups to
14:46 - disappear
14:50 - we might conceivably hit more than one
14:55 - so if the powerup type is Boost remember
15:01 - we might have other types of power-ups
15:03 - later then we are going to take our
15:07 - players Y velocity and we're gonna just
15:12 - shoot upwards at whatever the boost
15:16 - power was and we're also gonna set our
15:19 - jumping equal to false because we don't
15:25 - want to have the jump cut stop our stop
15:30 - our boost in the middle okay so let's
15:34 - see how that works now I'll go find a
15:38 - boost power up spawn for us
15:45 - there we go OOP OOP self dot player
15:50 - player velocity game doesn't have a
15:53 - velocity oh there's a couple alright
15:56 - there we go so now we're getting some
16:02 - all right we can get pretty high scores
16:07 - now up unless that happens what a bummer
16:11 - anyway you can see the power-ups are
16:13 - working and now we have a chance to
16:18 - boost if we had another one along the
16:20 - way it's gonna boost us again so we can
16:22 - chain them together my maybe we will
16:28 - update or increase that spawn percentage
16:32 - because they're not coming up very often
16:34 - I thought 7% would be plenty but that's
16:42 - good and so that'll about do it except I
16:47 - do want to add one more thing which is
16:49 - it would be nice to have a sound play
16:54 - when we hit the powerup so let's go and
16:57 - add a sound here so I am going to
17:07 - duplicate that line and made it make a
17:09 - boost sound and the sound I have for
17:12 - that I got this one so I'm just going to
17:26 - I'm gonna duplicate this line it would
17:30 - be a boost sound and this was the sound
17:35 - I have is boost 16 another one I just
17:39 - created you can use sound effects there
17:42 - again like we did in the previous one
17:45 - and then we're just gonna want to play
17:46 - this boost sound right here where we
17:49 - just added alright
17:56 - I'll give us some good feedback when we
17:59 - get boosted let's find one first when
18:07 - you're trying to find one to test it out
18:09 - the random number generator doesn't
18:13 - cooperate with you there we go
18:23 - perfect nice okay this video has gone a
18:30 - little bit long I apologize for that
18:33 - it seemed to go by fast as I was doing
18:35 - it but suddenly we were way over ten
18:37 - minutes so we will stop there for this
18:40 - time and as always please click like

welcome back to game development with pygame this is part 15 of our platformer game and in this video we will be adding powerups okay so before we go too far into the powerups there's one thing I

done before we're gonna do a sprite collide between the player and the powerups and we want the powerups to disappear we might conceivably hit more than one so if the powerup type is Boost remember we might have other types of powerups later then we are going to take our players Y velocity and we're gonna just shoot upwards at whatever the boost power was and we're also gonna set our jumping equal to false because we don't want to have the jump cut stop our stop our boost in the middle okay so let's see how that works now I'll go find a boost power up spawn for us there we go OOP OOP self dot player player velocity game doesn't have a velocity oh there's a couple alright there we go so now we're getting some all right we can get pretty high scores now up unless that happens what a bummer anyway you can see the powerups are working and now we have a chance to boost if we had another one along the way it's gonna boost us again so we can chain them together my maybe we will update or increase that spawn percentage because they're not coming up very often I thought 7% would be plenty but that's good and so that'll about do it except I do want to add one more thing which is it would be nice to have a sound play when we hit the powerup so let's go and add a sound here so I am going to duplicate that line and made it make a boost sound and the sound I have for that I got this one so I'm just going to I'm gonna duplicate this line it would be a boost sound and this was the sound I have is boost 16 another one I just created you can use sound effects there again like we did in
