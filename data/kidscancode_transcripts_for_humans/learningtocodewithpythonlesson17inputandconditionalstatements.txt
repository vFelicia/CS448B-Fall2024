00:01 - welcome back to learning to code with
00:02 - Python lesson number seven input and
00:06 - conditional statements so up to now all
00:10 - of our programs have been non
00:11 - interactive we just run them and sit
00:13 - back to watch what happens but what if
00:15 - you want to be able to ask a question in
00:17 - your program and have the person running
00:18 - it be able to answer well let's find out
00:21 - so I'm starting a new program here and
00:23 - we're gonna leave Fred the turtle behind
00:25 - for now because we won't need him for
00:26 - this
00:27 - so first let's ask the person running
00:30 - the program the user to tell us their
00:33 - name to do that I'm going to use the
00:35 - input function so the way the input
00:44 - function works is in the parenthesis you
00:46 - put the question that you want to ask so
00:49 - this is what the user will see when they
00:50 - run the program and then it will wait
00:53 - for them to type in a response and
00:55 - whatever response they type in will get
00:57 - saved into the variable name so now that
01:02 - we have the user's name saved in the
01:04 - variable name we can say hello the print
01:16 - is pretty neat it lets you put more than
01:18 - one item inside the parenthesis if you
01:20 - want and it'll print all of them out you
01:22 - just have to put a comma between them so
01:24 - I'm gonna print out this part in quotes
01:26 - saying hello and then whatever the
01:29 - variable name is equal to so let's run
01:33 - it and see what happens
01:45 - what's your name there we go at this
01:51 - point we need to talk about something
01:52 - that the input function does that you
01:54 - need to watch out for here's an example
01:57 - let's say in our program we're gonna ask
01:59 - the user what their age is so we ask
02:04 - them how old are you
02:08 - okay and when it ask you a question
02:11 - let's say we type in a number okay I'll
02:14 - say a number okay so now that number 30
02:18 - has been stored in the variable age and
02:22 - we could print out age but here's
02:26 - something that you may not expect what
02:29 - if we said next year you will be and
02:35 - we'll put age plus 1 now you would
02:40 - expect it would print out 30 plus 1 but
02:44 - instead you get an error message the
02:46 - error message says it can't convert int
02:50 - to string what does that mean well the
02:55 - variable age if we look at what type it
02:57 - is and type is a way to tell you what
03:01 - kind of data is stored in that variable
03:03 - it's a string
03:05 - anytime you type in something with input
03:07 - it saves it as a string meaning it
03:10 - doesn't think of it as a number it just
03:11 - thinks of it as some string like this
03:16 - but that means that we can't add to it
03:18 - right because that's an error message so
03:22 - we need a way to tell the computer that
03:23 - we want this data that we input to be
03:26 - treated as a number so that we can add 1
03:28 - to it
03:29 - we can do that with a function called
03:31 - int int basically takes a string and
03:34 - we'll convert it into a number so if we
03:36 - say int age plus 1 that's what we wanted
03:40 - so if we were to try our print statement
03:43 - again we need to make sure we just put
03:46 - int before age and that's what we wanted
03:54 - for a different number now in our
03:55 - program we're gonna ask how many ninjas
04:01 - are attacking and remember we want this
04:06 - to be a number so I want to make sure
04:08 - and put the int function around that now
04:15 - I want my program to do something
04:15 - different depending on how many ninjas
04:18 - are attacking if there's more than 50 I
04:22 - want to print out that's too many
04:25 - otherwise we can print out something
04:27 - like we can take them but here's the
04:31 - thing that requires us to do something
04:32 - called a branch or a conditional
04:34 - statement that means we want different
04:36 - commands to run depending on the
04:40 - different circumstance so for example so
04:45 - here's what that looks like we use the
04:47 - command if to indicate we're gonna do a
04:50 - branch so this conditional statement
04:53 - will say if ninjas is greater than 50 so
05:00 - the computer is going to make that
05:01 - comparison it's going to compare
05:02 - whatever ninjas the value of ninjas is
05:05 - and if it's greater than 50 then it's
05:08 - going to execute this block of code that
05:10 - comes after remember just like we did in
05:13 - our for loops we have a block of code
05:15 - that's indented underneath the for loop
05:18 - for what commands we wanted it to repeat
05:20 - same thing here so this command print
05:23 - that's too many
05:25 - will only execute if ninjas is greater
05:29 - than 50 if if this comparison right here
05:32 - is false then this command does not get
05:35 - executed so let's try that out
05:48 - so if I say let's put a bigger number
05:51 - first if I say 51 then it prints out
05:54 - that's too many what about if I run it
05:57 - again and this time I'm gonna say that
06:01 - there's fewer so there's only 24
06:02 - attacking let's see nothing happened so
06:06 - how do we add a second option well we
06:10 - can use the keyword else so this gives
06:13 - us another block of code that's the
06:16 - alternative case so if ninja's is
06:19 - greater than 50 you should do this but
06:23 - if it's not you're gonna do this which
06:25 - is print we can take them so now our
06:33 - program has two paths it can follow
06:35 - depending on the value of ninjas you
06:38 - will either run this print statement or
06:42 - this print statement but only one let's
06:49 - add one more option let's say that we
06:51 - have three branches that we want this
06:53 - program to take if it's greater than 50
06:56 - that's fine but what about maybe
06:58 - somewhere in between well we can add a
07:02 - third choice by adding L if now L if you
07:06 - can think of as short for else if so
07:10 - it's basically gonna do another test
07:11 - we're gonna say L if ninjas is greater
07:16 - than 20 and if that's the case then
07:22 - we're gonna print maybe we can do it
07:26 - okay so now we have three different
07:29 - paths
07:29 - if ninjas is greater than 50 this
07:32 - happens none of the rest does if ninjas
07:36 - is not greater than 50 then it goes to
07:38 - the next option
07:39 - is it greater than 20 if it is do this
07:42 - and if it wasn't either of these then
07:46 - the last case is this one so let's try
07:50 - that out
07:57 - let's try 18 18 is not greater than 20
08:03 - so we can take them and we'll try one
08:09 - more and let's say we're somewhere in
08:11 - the middle branching is a key concept in
08:16 - programming and we'll make use of it
08:18 - quite a lot as we go through this series
08:21 - in our next lesson
08:23 - we'll use some if statements to make a
08:25 - simple game

welcome back to learning to code with Python lesson number seven input and conditional statements so up to now all of our programs have been non interactive we just run them and sit back to watch what happens but what if you want to be able to ask a question in your program and have the person running it be able to answer well let's find out so I'm starting a new program here and we're gonna leave Fred the turtle behind for now because we won't need him for this so first let's ask the person running the program the user to tell us their name to do that I'm going to use the input function so the way the input function works is in the parenthesis you put the question that you want to ask so this is what the user will see when they run the program and then it will wait for them to type in a response and whatever response they type in will get saved into the variable name so now that we have the user's name saved in the variable name we can say hello the print is pretty neat it lets you put more than one item inside the parenthesis if you want and it'll print all of them out you just have to put a comma between them so I'm gonna print out this part in quotes saying hello and then whatever the variable name is equal to so let's run it and see what happens what's your name there we go at this point we need to talk about something that the input function does that you need to watch out for here's an example let's say in our program we're gonna ask the user what their age is so we ask them how old are you okay and when it ask you a question let's say we type in a number okay I'll say a number okay so now that number 30 has been stored in the variable age and we could print out age but here's something that you may not expect what if we said next year you will be and we'll put age plus 1 now you would expect it would print out 30 plus 1 but instead you get an error message the error message says it can't convert int to string what does that mean well the variable age if we look at what type it is and type is a way to tell you what kind of data is stored in that variable it's a string anytime you type in something with input it saves it as a string meaning it doesn't think of it as a number it just thinks of it as some string like this but that means that we can't add to it right because that's an error message so we need a way to tell the computer that we want this data that we input to be treated as a number so that we can add 1 to it we can do that with a function called int int basically takes a string and we'll convert it into a number so if we say int age plus 1 that's what we wanted so if we were to try our print statement again we need to make sure we just put int before age and that's what we wanted for a different number now in our program we're gonna ask how many ninjas are attacking and remember we want this to be a number so I want to make sure and put the int function around that now I want my program to do something different depending on how many ninjas are attacking if there's more than 50 I want to print out that's too many otherwise we can print out something like we can take them but here's the thing that requires us to do something called a branch or a conditional statement that means we want different commands to run depending on the different circumstance so for example so here's what that looks like we use the command if to indicate we're gonna do a branch so this conditional statement will say if ninjas is greater than 50 so the computer is going to make that comparison it's going to compare whatever ninjas the value of ninjas is and if it's greater than 50 then it's going to execute this block of code that comes after remember just like we did in our for loops we have a block of code that's

right here is false then this command does not get executed so let's try that out so if I say let's put a bigger number first if I say 51 then it prints out that's too many what about if I run it again and this time I'm gonna say that there's fewer so there's only 24 attacking let's see nothing happened so how do we add a second option well we can use the keyword else so this gives us another

last case is this one so let's try that out let's try 18 18 is not greater than 20 so we can take them and we'll try one more and let's say we're somewhere in the middle branching is a key concept in
