00:01 - okay welcome back to the top-down tank
00:03 - battle game in Godot 3 this time around
00:07 - we're gonna add a couple of small quick
00:10 - features one one about the tank and one
00:13 - visual effect stay tuned to the end
00:15 - because I do have a little bit of an
00:18 - announcement about the upcoming Godot
00:20 - 3.1 release and I'd love to hear all of
00:24 - your opinions about it but for now let's
00:28 - dive into the code so the first small
00:30 - feature I want to add is I want the
00:32 - driving to be a little faster when your
00:36 - tank is on the road or to put that the
00:39 - opposite way it's slower when you're off
00:41 - road so that way when you drive along
00:43 - the roads you'll be you know you'll be
00:44 - encouraged to drive along the road
00:46 - because you'll get there faster so the
00:48 - way we're going to do that is by
00:50 - checking what tile is underneath our
00:53 - position if the tile that's underneath
00:55 - our position is one of these terrain
00:59 - tiles actually I decided to do it this
01:02 - way because there's fewer terrain tiles
01:03 - then there are Road tiles because of all
01:06 - the curves and everything like that so
01:08 - if we're on one of these non road tiles
01:11 - our speed is going to be lowered
01:15 - otherwise we'll go our current higher
01:18 - speed so we need a list of those tiles
01:21 - so I'm gonna go in my script tab here
01:24 - and I'm gonna create a new script and
01:27 - I'm gonna call this Global's
01:31 - this is going to hold global variables
01:35 - of which we're probably gonna need more
01:37 - later this will just be the first so
01:40 - we're gonna make this script and it's
01:42 - going to have in it a variable called
01:47 - slow terrain and this is a list which
01:52 - I've already made of the tiles that are
01:56 - the terrain so we go back over to 2d
01:59 - here and we're in the tile map you can
02:02 - see right number zero not number one
02:06 - number ten etc alright so I just made a
02:08 - list of the ones that are terrain and
02:10 - like I said there's a lot more Road ones
02:13 - so
02:14 - easier this way so we're gonna save that
02:19 - script and we're gonna add it in the
02:24 - project settings as an auto load so we
02:28 - want to go and pick that script Global's
02:31 - and we want to add it and for the name
02:36 - I'm gonna put this in all caps mainly so
02:41 - that when I'm using it in scripts it
02:44 - stands out it's just a visibility thing
02:47 - personal preference so okay so now what
02:51 - happens is that auto load will be
02:54 - automatically loaded in every scene so
02:57 - whatever script you're using will have
02:58 - access via that Global's
03:00 - name to whatever functions or data is in
03:06 - this script so in our tank I'm gonna go
03:10 - over a tank script now and we're going
03:13 - to add a couple more configuration
03:15 - variables we're gonna add we're gonna
03:20 - add a let's call it off-road friction
03:24 - that's gonna be how how much does being
03:28 - offered slow you down right and that way
03:31 - we can make tanks have different values
03:33 - for that and let's see on the tank here
03:37 - let's set the default for that to 1.5 so
03:43 - basically you'll be doing 50% slower now
03:49 - in the script also what we need to do is
03:53 - we need a reference to the map so that
03:56 - we can access what tile is underneath us
04:03 - okay and the main scene will we'll set
04:08 - that value when the player spawns so
04:12 - down here in our process function or
04:16 - sorry physics process function right if
04:19 - here after we've checked the controls if
04:23 - we have a map set its that variable set
04:26 - then we need to figure out which tile is
04:29 - underneath us so the tile that's
04:31 - underneath us will get the cell for our
04:36 - position using the world to map so we
04:43 - convert our position into map
04:46 - coordinates and then get the cell that's
04:49 - there which is going to be an integer
04:50 - value the number so if that tile is in
04:56 - Global's dot slow terrain then we want
05:01 - to make our velocity and we're gonna
05:03 - just going to divide it by off-road
05:06 - friction actually come to think of it
05:08 - why would I want to do it that way let's
05:10 - multiply it by off-road friction and
05:12 - let's just set the off-road friction to
05:18 - 3/4 all right so so you go 3/4 speed
05:23 - when you are off-road ok so now how do
05:27 - we set that map value well that's going
05:30 - to be in our mean our map script here in
05:35 - the map script we're going to set that
05:39 - in ready
05:42 - so in ready we're going to say set the
05:47 - player's map variable a equal to and I
05:52 - want to set it to the ground tile map
05:57 - all right let's give this a try
06:07 - okay so now I'm driving along going kind
06:11 - of slowly but when I get on the road
06:14 - yeah I'm faster so let's see if I just
06:17 - go in a straight line I speed up when I
06:20 - go across there so now we can set that
06:24 - for different tanks to different values
06:27 - and you'll be able to go a lot faster or
06:31 - a lot slower whether you're on the road
06:34 - or not okay so another small effect I
06:39 - want to make is I want an indicator when
06:41 - a tank's damage is getting a low that
06:46 - will show that it's almost dead right so
06:48 - the or that it's damaged so it has some
06:50 - smoke coming off and so we're gonna use
06:53 - a particle 2d node for that so I'm going
06:56 - to make a new actually I'm going to make
06:58 - a new scene and we're gonna use a
07:01 - particles 2d I'm gonna call this smoke
07:06 - and I'm going to save it in the effects
07:11 - folder so we can attach this to any of
07:16 - the tanks we'll attach it to the to the
07:18 - route tank script or the route tank
07:20 - scene so what do we want this to do so
07:26 - to get started we don't have to get too
07:29 - fancy with this we can really just use
07:31 - the default
07:33 - particle shapes and things and we can
07:36 - always come back and adjust it when we
07:37 - see what it looks like so let's see here
07:39 - I want more than eight particles let's
07:42 - try 50 and see if that's too many or not
07:47 - lifetime we'll see how we feel about
07:52 - that one what do we want explosiveness
07:55 - now we can keep that those are all fine
08:01 - what else do we want to change on here
08:07 - position I'll adjust that when we add it
08:10 - to the tank
08:17 - yeah we'll see about that one these only
08:20 - added to tank but for process material
08:21 - we want to add a new particles material
08:24 - right which generates the default
08:26 - particles which are little square ones
08:29 - just dropping off the screen so we go
08:33 - into that particles material and this is
08:34 - where we're gonna set lots of these
08:37 - flags so let's see let's go through them
08:41 - one by one so for the emission shape I
08:45 - want to use a box so I want them to
08:48 - spawn you know in an area not in one
08:51 - spot so let's make the extents of the
08:55 - Box wider okay let's make gravity V zero
09:05 - because we don't want that all right so
09:16 - now they're spawning first let's see
09:18 - what's spread spread probably want that
09:23 - to be a little bit smaller and we'll
09:28 - mess around with the velocity and stuff
09:30 - let's get the appearance going so for
09:33 - this scale right I want these to be
09:39 - larger but then I also want there to be
09:43 - a scale curve meaning when they spawn
09:48 - well maybe not
09:50 - let's just let's see what it looks like
09:51 - with the color I'm going sort of doing
09:53 - this as we go so for the color we're
09:55 - gonna use a color ramp which is a
10:00 - gradient from one color to another let's
10:06 - make a new gradient let's edit that now
10:10 - we want it to start out as kind of a
10:14 - maybe a grayish color
10:20 - and then I wanted to fade towards black
10:24 - but also with a low alpha yeah that's
10:34 - pretty good now they're all spawning in
10:38 - the same spot and not moving so we can
10:40 - also go to our velocity settings and
10:43 - give it a little bit of a initial
10:48 - velocity because I think that is set
10:51 - very small there we go although why is
11:02 - it going we have our color ramp going
11:09 - the wrong way
11:15 - I wanted this one to be the solid color
11:22 - and then this one over here to be the
11:29 - black lo alpha there we go yeah let's
11:41 - make this one a little lighter okay and
11:54 - let's give it a little tangential
11:58 - acceleration that will make it sort of
12:04 - flow off to the side if it's looking
12:07 - choppy to you and this is from the
12:09 - screen capture it'll be better once we
12:12 - get it all going so there's that so I'm
12:17 - gonna save that and then over in the
12:20 - tank script we're going to attach this
12:23 - to the tank so we're gonna add an
12:28 - instance of the smoke so let's take that
12:32 - smoke and let's flip it 180 degrees I
12:36 - want it to be going off in that
12:38 - direction and let's shift it back
12:41 - towards the back of the tank a little
12:42 - bit okay
12:49 - save that let's look what that looks
12:52 - like on the player there we go so a
12:55 - little bit of smoke looking at these
12:57 - coming out of the back of the engine
12:59 - there that's a good start we'll come
13:02 - back and tweak it later but now we want
13:04 - that to either turn on or off depending
13:06 - on the tanks health so in the tanks
13:10 - script when it's ready we're going to
13:17 - let's see in the hell yeah so when it's
13:24 - ready we're just going to turn it off
13:31 - all right we set the emitting to false
13:34 - because we don't want it to be showing
13:36 - and then it turns on or off depending on
13:39 - your health right so when you take
13:41 - damage we want to turn it on so so let's
13:53 - put that here if health is less than max
13:57 - health
14:00 - let's save your below half then I want
14:06 - to set emitting to true and then when
14:09 - you heal I want to do the opposite all
14:24 - right let's see what that looks like
14:25 - when we run this okay
14:33 - so I haven't taken any damage let's go
14:36 - up here and get hits um when my health
14:39 - gets low
14:40 - oh I'm smoking up did you notice what I
14:43 - forgot so on the smoke our problem is
14:48 - that we are stuck on local coordinates
14:51 - so in the drawing we want to turn off
14:55 - local coordinates local coordinates
14:58 - makes the particles stay attached to the
15:01 - emitter so that when the tank is turning
15:03 - all the smoke turns with it but we want
15:05 - it to trail off and not be attached to
15:08 - the tank anymore let's try that again
15:21 - there we go
15:23 - all right so now I'm leaving off that
15:26 - trail of smoke I probably am gonna play
15:31 - around with this some more and fiddle
15:33 - around with the emission time right how
15:37 - long the particles last maybe the speed
15:39 - they go at but you get the idea right
15:43 - particles you can have a lot of fun just
15:44 - playing around with them and trying a
15:46 - bunch of different settings so I'm going
15:48 - to tweak that off-camera and we can move
15:53 - on to the next step so one other thing I
15:58 - want to do oh we should probably put
15:59 - that below the turret - huh let's do
16:04 - that real quick so we want the smoke to
16:07 - be rendering before the turret alright
16:17 - so one of the reasons that it's been a
16:22 - little slower making these is because of
16:25 - the upcoming release of Godot 3.1 and
16:29 - now that 3.1 is in beta I've been
16:32 - spending some time taking a look at the
16:34 - features and I'm trying to decide
16:37 - whether I want to shift this project
16:40 - over to 3.1 right once 3.1 comes out
16:44 - people are going to want to toriel's and
16:46 - examples and things that are targeted
16:49 - towards that now the good news is that
16:51 - the move from 3.0 3.1 isn't going to
16:54 - change a lot about this project the
16:59 - obviously the older videos are going to
17:02 - look different because the UI has
17:04 - changed a little bit the inspector looks
17:06 - a little bit different so I think what
17:08 - I'm gonna do is do an example video of
17:13 - that of 3.1 and sort of get everybody's
17:16 - opinion on what they want me to do if
17:19 - they want me to start working on
17:20 - shifting this over to 3.1 or if you want
17:23 - to stick 3.0 for now and deal with that
17:26 - later feel free to leave your comments
17:29 - in the comments
17:32 - you know let me know what you think what
17:34 - you want me to do about this upcoming
17:38 - new version of Godot
17:39 - thanks for watching and I'll see you
17:41 - next time here I'm just tacking out the
17:45 - end if you want to see a different way
17:46 - to do the particles I added a little red
17:50 - orange there to make it look like
17:52 - there's fire before the smoke comes out
17:55 - again a lot of different ways you can do
17:57 - this I encourage you to play around with
17:59 - the particle nodes yourself and make
18:01 - something that you think looks good
18:10 - you

Cleaned transcript:

okay welcome back to the topdown tank battle game in Godot 3 this time around we're gonna add a couple of small quick features one one about the tank and one visual effect stay tuned to the end because I do have a little bit of an announcement about the upcoming Godot 3.1 release and I'd love to hear all of your opinions about it but for now let's dive into the code so the first small feature I want to add is I want the driving to be a little faster when your tank is on the road or to put that the opposite way it's slower when you're off road so that way when you drive along the roads you'll be you know you'll be encouraged to drive along the road because you'll get there faster so the way we're going to do that is by checking what tile is underneath our position if the tile that's underneath our position is one of these terrain tiles actually I decided to do it this way because there's fewer terrain tiles then there are Road tiles because of all the curves and everything like that so if we're on one of these non road tiles our speed is going to be lowered otherwise we'll go our current higher speed so we need a list of those tiles so I'm gonna go in my script tab here and I'm gonna create a new script and I'm gonna call this Global's this is going to hold global variables of which we're probably gonna need more later this will just be the first so we're gonna make this script and it's going to have in it a variable called slow terrain and this is a list which I've already made of the tiles that are the terrain so we go back over to 2d here and we're in the tile map you can see right number zero not number one number ten etc alright so I just made a list of the ones that are terrain and like I said there's a lot more Road ones so easier this way so we're gonna save that script and we're gonna add it in the project settings as an auto load so we want to go and pick that script Global's and we want to add it and for the name I'm gonna put this in all caps mainly so that when I'm using it in scripts it stands out it's just a visibility thing personal preference so okay so now what happens is that auto load will be automatically loaded in every scene so whatever script you're using will have access via that Global's name to whatever functions or data is in this script so in our tank I'm gonna go over a tank script now and we're going to add a couple more configuration variables we're gonna add we're gonna add a let's call it offroad friction that's gonna be how how much does being offered slow you down right and that way we can make tanks have different values for that and let's see on the tank here let's set the default for that to 1.5 so basically you'll be doing 50% slower now in the script also what we need to do is we need a reference to the map so that we can access what tile is underneath us okay and the main scene will we'll set that value when the player spawns so down here in our process function or sorry physics process function right if here after we've checked the controls if we have a map set its that variable set then we need to figure out which tile is underneath us so the tile that's underneath us will get the cell for our position using the world to map so we convert our position into map coordinates and then get the cell that's there which is going to be an integer value the number so if that tile is in Global's dot slow terrain then we want to make our velocity and we're gonna just going to divide it by offroad friction actually come to think of it why would I want to do it that way let's multiply it by offroad friction and let's just set the offroad friction to 3/4 all right so so you go 3/4 speed when you are offroad ok so now how do we set that map value well that's going to be in our mean our map script here in the map script we're going to set that in ready so in ready we're going to say set the player's map variable a equal to and I want to set it to the ground tile map all right let's give this a try okay so now I'm driving along going kind of slowly but when I get on the road yeah I'm faster so let's see if I just go in a straight line I speed up when I go across there so now we can set that for different tanks to different values and you'll be able to go a lot faster or a lot slower whether you're on the road or not okay so another small effect I want to make is I want an indicator when a tank's damage is getting a low that will show that it's almost dead right so the or that it's damaged so it has some smoke coming off and so we're gonna use a particle 2d node for that so I'm going to make a new actually I'm going to make a new scene and we're gonna use a particles 2d I'm gonna call this smoke and I'm going to save it in the effects folder so we can attach this to any of the tanks we'll attach it to the to the route tank script or the route tank scene so what do we want this to do so to get started we don't have to get too fancy with this we can really just use the default particle shapes and things and we can always come back and adjust it when we see what it looks like so let's see here I want more than eight particles let's try 50 and see if that's too many or not lifetime we'll see how we feel about that one what do we want explosiveness now we can keep that those are all fine what else do we want to change on here position I'll adjust that when we add it to the tank yeah we'll see about that one these only added to tank but for process material we want to add a new particles material right which generates the default particles which are little square ones just dropping off the screen so we go into that particles material and this is where we're gonna set lots of these flags so let's see let's go through them one by one so for the emission shape I want to use a box so I want them to spawn you know in an area not in one spot so let's make the extents of the Box wider okay let's make gravity V zero because we don't want

kind of a maybe a grayish color and then I wanted to fade towards black but also with a low alpha yeah that's pretty good now they're all spawning in the same spot and not moving so we can also go to our velocity settings and give it a little bit of a initial velocity because I think that is set very small there we go although why is it going we have our color ramp going the wrong way I wanted this one to be the solid color and then this one over here to be the black lo alpha there we go yeah let's make this one a little lighter okay and let's give it a little tangential acceleration that will make it sort of flow off to the side if it's looking choppy to you and this is from the screen capture it'll be better once we get it all going so there's that so I'm gonna save that and then

out of the back of the engine there that's a good start we'll come back and tweak it later but now we want that to either turn on or off depending on the tanks health so in the tanks script when it's

this upcoming new version of Godot thanks for watching and I'll see you next time here I'm just tacking out the end if you want to see a different way to do the particles I added a little red orange there to make it look like there's fire before the smoke comes out again a lot of different ways you can do this I encourage you to play around with the particle nodes yourself and make something that you think looks good you
