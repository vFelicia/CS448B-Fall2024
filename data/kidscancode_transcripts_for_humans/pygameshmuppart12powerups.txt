00:00 - welcome back to game development with
00:01 - pygame in this episode we will be adding
00:04 - power-ups to our mouth game so we're
00:09 - getting pretty close to having a
00:10 - complete game but one thing that we're
00:13 - definitely missing is power-ups and
00:16 - there's a couple kind of power-ups we
00:18 - can do we can do power-ups that give you
00:21 - shields so there's a way to get some
00:22 - shield points back and then we can also
00:25 - do some power-ups that will increase
00:27 - your or improve your guns now what I'm
00:31 - gonna do is I'm gonna copy this class
00:34 - bullet just so that I can use that to
00:38 - make my class power and we'll just call
00:40 - it a POW for short now power-ups when we
00:44 - spawn them we're going to just give past
00:48 - them the center of the mob that we just
00:54 - blew up so when I shoot a meteor and it
00:56 - explodes that will it'll have a chance
00:58 - of dropping a powerup
00:59 - so the center so we're just gonna set
01:02 - the wrecks Center to the center and then
01:07 - we also are going to have different
01:09 - kinds of power-ups so what I have here
01:12 - is for the art is I've got a little
01:15 - lightning bolt icon and that's going to
01:18 - be the gun powerup and then I have a
01:21 - little shield symbol here these are also
01:25 - from the Kinney game art and those will
01:28 - be my two powerup images so what we're
01:32 - gonna do is choose randomly which kind
01:34 - it is so we'll make a variable called
01:38 - type and it's going to be a random
01:39 - choice between shield and gun so it'll
01:47 - be a shield powerup or a gun thora and
01:49 - then which one do we use well let's go
01:52 - down to our loading image loading code
01:55 - and we're gonna add one more thing here
01:59 - after all the explosions we need to have
02:02 - two types of images so powerup images is
02:07 - going to be a dictionary dictionary lets
02:10 - you do is kind of like a list except
02:13 - item instead of being numbered zero one
02:15 - two three it can have a name so power up
02:19 - images shield will be we're gonna load
02:30 - the image derp and the file name will be
02:35 - is shield gold PNG and then we will just
02:50 - replace for the second one for the gun
02:53 - will be bolt underscore gold now when
03:02 - our class we can just choose randomly
03:05 - between using the shield or the gun
03:07 - image our image is going to be power up
03:14 - images self-taught type so whichever
03:17 - type would you chose shielder or gun and
03:21 - then when we when this spawns on the
03:23 - screen when our player runs into it we
03:26 - can say what type did they run into and
03:27 - do the appropriate action now the speed
03:33 - we're gonna want it to spawn somewhere
03:34 - and then start going downwards and we
03:37 - probably don't want it to be too fast so
03:40 - let's just set that at five right now
03:42 - and we'll see how it goes and we want to
03:45 - kill it if it goes off the bottom of the
03:49 - screen so if the top is greater than the
03:54 - height and that will be our powerup
03:57 - sprite now we just need to spawn them so
04:04 - we'll go down here and like we did with
04:08 - the other different sprite types we're
04:10 - gonna add a power-ups group to put them
04:15 - in so we can simply do the collisions
04:18 - and we're gonna spawn a sprite right
04:23 - here if a bullet hit a mob
04:26 - so what we're gonna do is if the bullet
04:28 - hit the mob we want to pick a random
04:33 - number right we want to have it we want
04:35 - to have a chance of spawning a powerup
04:38 - but not necessarily always spawn one
04:41 - so if random dot random random dot
04:47 - random just gives you a number a decimal
04:50 - number between zero and one so if it's
04:53 - greater than 0.9 that means we're gonna
04:56 - have a 10% chance of dropping a powerup
05:00 - and again we can play around with it and
05:03 - see if that's too much too little you
05:06 - know or just right so we're gonna make a
05:09 - POW at the hit dot center we're gonna
05:17 - add it to the all sprites and we're
05:21 - gonna add it to the power-ups okay and
05:27 - then we should be ready to try it out so
05:34 - let's see what happens
05:37 - oops hit dot center hit dot rect
05:41 - dot Center all right so let's see if
05:48 - there went one but it was kind of fast
05:50 - wasn't it 10% might be a little too rare
06:00 - maybe not but they definitely move a
06:03 - little too fast so let's change that
06:08 - we'll go up here and change that speed
06:11 - let's make it nice and slow and so that
06:15 - we have a good chances of catching them
06:16 - especially while we're testing we want
06:19 - these things to be easy to grab so we
06:21 - can make sure they work so if we have
06:24 - these fright the the power-ups spawning
06:27 - and they're coming down we are going to
06:29 - need to see if we hit one so we'll add
06:32 - another little collision check here
06:38 - if the player it hit a power up okay so
06:46 - this time the hits check is going to be
06:50 - a sprite collide between the player and
06:55 - the power-ups and we're gonna say it
06:59 - true here because we want the powerup to
07:00 - disappear now it's very unlikely that we
07:06 - will have two of them on the screen at
07:09 - the same time but I suppose it's
07:10 - possible
07:11 - so we need to say what happens if we
07:14 - catch each kind so let's start with the
07:17 - shield one that's really simple so if we
07:22 - hit a shield powerup so we're gonna say
07:24 - if hit dot type is shield then we want
07:29 - to give some shield back
07:31 - so player dot shield plus equals let's
07:38 - say 20 so the shield gives us back 20
07:42 - the shield powerup gives us back 20 and
07:45 - if the shield is greater than or equal
07:48 - to greater than equal to 100 we will cap
07:52 - it at 100 we don't want that to go above
07:57 - so now let's make them spawn temporarily
08:02 - let's make them spawn very often so that
08:07 - we can make sure that this is working so
08:12 - that we can see what the shield one does
08:14 - okay so I need to take some hits here
08:17 - and then I'll go grab a shield there you
08:20 - see my shield go back up let's grab
08:23 - another one just so you can see yeah
08:26 - perfect
08:30 - all right so let's change that back to
08:34 - the 90% or the 10% chance of spawning
08:38 - and what I thought I would do is instead
08:43 - of the player dot shield and instead of
08:46 - the shield always giving you back
08:47 - exactly 20 we could make it a random
08:51 - amount
08:52 - so that you never know exactly how much
08:53 - you're gonna get back so we could just
08:56 - put this as anywhere it gives you
08:59 - anywhere between 10 and say 30 so some
09:06 - of the power-ups will give you a bunch
09:07 - you know a third of your shield back
09:09 - almost and then some of them only give
09:11 - you a little bit so you're you want to
09:14 - catch as many of these as you can get to
09:16 - get your shields back to full okay then
09:19 - that'll do it for the shield powerup
09:20 - that's all we need to do now for the gun
09:23 - powerup we have a little bit more to
09:26 - talk about
09:26 - right if hit type equals gun then what
09:32 - are we gonna do well there's several
09:34 - things we have to do and because of that
09:36 - and because our last video went way too
09:40 - long I'm gonna go ahead and stop it here
09:43 - if you want to go ahead before watching
09:47 - the next video and see if you can start
09:49 - figuring out how we're gonna implement
09:51 - the gun powerup I recommend you try that
09:55 - and then you can watch the next video
09:57 - and see if we were thinking the same
10:00 - thing
10:00 - alright and I'll see you next time
10:10 - you
