00:00 - welcome to part 8 of the Godot top-down
00:03 - tank battle tutorial game this time
00:05 - we're gonna finish up with the
00:07 - explosions make the enemy tanks explode
00:09 - when we kill them and add a little bit
00:12 - of visual effects to the shooting with a
00:15 - muzzle flash animation alright let's get
00:18 - started so I started out this time by
00:21 - going to the tank master scene and I've
00:25 - added a couple of things I've added a
00:26 - sprite attached to the turret called
00:29 - flash this is gonna be a muzzle flash
00:32 - effect that is going to play when the
00:35 - tank fires look like you know flame
00:38 - coming out of the muzzle of the tank
00:40 - when the bullet comes out and I've also
00:42 - added an animation player to make that
00:45 - animation effect happen and then I've
00:48 - also attached an explosion scene I've
00:51 - taken the explosion scene in instance it
00:53 - here because I want to have the tanks
00:55 - explode when they are destroyed just
00:58 - like the bullets do and a couple of
01:01 - things here so on the explosion I've
01:03 - chosen the fire animation instead of the
01:05 - smoked one so we have a different one
01:08 - for that also on the flash go ahead and
01:11 - set the region to enabled so that when
01:13 - you customize this on the individual
01:16 - tanks you won't have to go and choose
01:18 - that each time so this is going to apply
01:21 - to all tanks so the animations that we
01:24 - make are gonna do the same thing with
01:27 - the flash sprite we can just use a
01:29 - different image on them to get a
01:30 - different visual effect to new
01:33 - animations here the first one I'm gonna
01:35 - call init and this one we're gonna set
01:39 - it to auto play and what that means is
01:41 - this is the this animation is gonna be
01:43 - used to set the any of the properties
01:46 - that were animating to their initial
01:49 - state so for example on the flash sprite
01:54 - we're gonna take its modulate property
01:56 - and put the Alpha all the way to zero so
01:59 - that the flash can't be seen and then we
02:03 - will add that as a keyframe and that's
02:06 - all we need in there for now when we add
02:08 - other effects and things we might have
02:10 - other properties that we need to add
02:13 - okay and now we're gonna add another
02:14 - animation this one is going to be the
02:17 - muzzle flash effect and I don't want
02:21 - this to take one second I only want it
02:23 - to take 0.15 seconds it's gonna be a
02:26 - nice short animation and I'm going to
02:28 - set the steps to 0.01 so we have a
02:31 - little bit more of a control over where
02:34 - we can set the keyframes and let me zoom
02:37 - this out so we can see the whole thing
02:38 - so this is going to have two tracks on
02:42 - it first we're going to set the modulate
02:45 - so let's set the Alpha back to maximum
02:49 - and add that as a keyframe then we're
02:53 - going to move out to around here almost
02:59 - all the way to the end and we're going
03:00 - to hit another keyframe so it's going to
03:02 - stay with a full alpha there and then at
03:07 - the end we're going to quickly ramp down
03:11 - to invisible again so it'll be visible
03:15 - and then become invisible and then the
03:19 - other thing we're gonna do is we're
03:20 - going to change it to change its scale
03:22 - so in the transform scale I want to do a
03:26 - couple of things here I want it to look
03:28 - like it's flame that's exploding out of
03:30 - the turret and then shrinks down so
03:33 - we're gonna start with the scale being
03:37 - small it's gonna get big and then it's
03:41 - gonna shrink again so I'm gonna set the
03:44 - scale to 0.5 and start that on my first
03:52 - keyframe and then somewhere about here
03:56 - about there we're gonna set the scale to
04:02 - 1.5 and that will be that and then about
04:10 - here where we are shrinking down again
04:15 - we're going to set it to 1 and then it
04:20 - can remain that size during the end of
04:24 - it
04:25 - okay so it's really hard to tell what
04:28 - that's going to do so we need to add a
04:30 - an actual image there and play the
04:32 - animation so you can see what it look
04:34 - like okay so now if we go over to our
04:37 - player tank we can add the image here
04:40 - and choose the texture region I'm using
04:44 - this orange one let me zoom over here
04:48 - I'm using this orange one here make sure
04:51 - that you use pixel snap so you don't get
04:53 - any of the pixels from the adjacent
04:55 - shapes they're all pecked in there
04:57 - pretty tight so now we can see the image
05:00 - there now we need to move it so that
05:02 - it's going to be at the tip of the of
05:04 - the muzzle but we also need to change
05:07 - its offset and the reason for that is
05:08 - because we're scaling when we scale it
05:11 - in the animation it's going to scale
05:13 - centered on the center of the sprite so
05:16 - it's going to scale in equally in all
05:18 - four directions I want it to scale from
05:20 - here like it's coming out from the end
05:22 - so we're gonna change the offset about
05:28 - like that and then we're gonna change
05:31 - the position maybe 60 pixels iosys yeah
05:42 - maybe a little bit smaller than that
05:45 - 55 okay so now it's at the tip of the
05:50 - cannon and if we shoot we should see it
05:53 - play okay that's the effect we're going
05:57 - for so when I shoot you can see it's
06:00 - scaling upwards and then back down again
06:01 - and fading out at the end now the other
06:07 - thing we added to this tank scene was
06:11 - the explosion and so I want this
06:13 - explosion to play when the tank is it
06:17 - when it dies when it runs out of health
06:18 - right now when it runs out of Health
06:19 - we're just doing Q free but we created
06:23 - this explode function this is where
06:24 - we're gonna put the code to do that so
06:27 - what do we want to happen when it
06:28 - explodes well there's a few things we
06:31 - need to do we need to take its collision
06:33 - shape and disable it because we don't
06:37 - want more additional bullets
06:39 - hitting the additional bullets hitting
06:42 - the explosion while it's playing will
06:45 - set alive equal to false which makes the
06:50 - physics process stop running so it won't
06:53 - move anymore we're going to hide the
06:58 - turret and the body and body thanks we
07:07 - don't want to see them or you can see
07:08 - the explosion and then we're gonna
07:10 - exploit play the explosion so we need to
07:12 - do two things we need to show the
07:14 - explosion because it's hidden right now
07:16 - and we need to explosion dot play now
07:21 - that will play the explosion and then
07:23 - when the explosion finishes is when we
07:25 - want the tank to actually be destroyed
07:27 - so we will connect the animation is
07:30 - finished signal here and when the
07:33 - explosion animation finishes that's when
07:37 - we're gonna cue free so let's go over to
07:39 - the map scene and try and blow up an
07:41 - enemy tank and see if that works you
07:45 - notice I already added the muzzle flash
07:47 - to the enemy tanks as well which was the
07:50 - same there we go same process is adding
07:53 - it to the player I just used a different
07:56 - image I'll use the yellow one instead of
07:57 - the orange one if you want to you can go
08:00 - over to the enemy tank and you can scale
08:03 - the explosion to whatever size you feel
08:06 - is gonna be good for the size of the
08:09 - tank you can unhide it here and see
08:11 - that's what it's gonna look like when it
08:14 - explodes so I think that'll be alright a
08:21 - little bit bigger 1.5 that'll do it for
08:25 - this time it's a little bit shorter this
08:27 - time around I've been really busy with
08:29 - the end of the school year happening so
08:32 - I'll hopefully be able to ramp back up
08:34 - in speed in the next couple of weeks so
08:37 - I hope you enjoyed it and learn a little
08:39 - bit about how to do some basic animation
08:42 - effects we'll be doing a lot more of
08:43 - those as time goes on to give some other
08:46 - visual effects as well and coming up
08:50 - we're going to talk about adding
08:51 - obstacles and
08:52 - pick up items to the game thanks for
08:54 - watching see you next time
09:03 - you

welcome to part 8 of the Godot topdown tank battle tutorial game this time we're gonna finish up with the explosions make the enemy tanks explode when we kill them and add a little bit of visual effects to the shooting with a muzzle flash animation alright let's get started so I started out this time by going to the tank master scene and I've added a couple of things I've added a sprite

iosys yeah maybe a little bit smaller than that 55 okay so now it's at the tip of the cannon and if we shoot we should see it play okay that's the effect we're going for so when I shoot you can see it's scaling upwards and then back down again and fading out at the end now the other thing we added to this tank scene was the explosion and so I want this explosion to play when the tank is it when
