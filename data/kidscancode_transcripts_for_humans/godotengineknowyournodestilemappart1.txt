00:00 - welcome back to know your nodes this is
00:02 - the series of Godot game engine videos
00:03 - where we take a single node type and
00:05 - show how it's used this time around
00:07 - we're going to be talking about a very
00:09 - popular node that a lot of people have
00:13 - trouble with it's the tile map node time
00:17 - app games are really common they're used
00:18 - for all kinds of styles of games like
00:21 - dungeon crawlers Legend of Zelda style
00:23 - RPGs strategy games even side-scrolling
00:27 - platformers like Megaman use tiles to
00:30 - design their levels sometimes it's
00:32 - obvious that the game is using tiles and
00:35 - sometimes they're not very visible at
00:37 - all but they're still being used behind
00:39 - the scenes basically all it means is
00:41 - that a grid of tiles is being used to
00:44 - layout the game world the graphics the
00:47 - map the movement of this price
00:48 - everything is based on an underlying
00:50 - grid and Godot has all sorts of tools to
00:54 - help you build out your tile map and
00:56 - interact with it as you're making your
00:59 - game so let's get started the first
01:03 - thing you need for your tile map is you
01:05 - need a tile set a tile set is a
01:07 - collection of the images that you're
01:09 - going to use to draw your map with so I
01:11 - have here a art pack for a top-down
01:15 - tower-defense
01:16 - style game that's made up of 64 by 64
01:19 - tiles and also two different colors and
01:22 - that's what we're going to use to make
01:24 - our map with Sol so start a new scene
01:28 - and just add a node 2d for your root
01:31 - node I'm just calling this tile fit top
01:33 - down and then you're going to add a
01:36 - sprite and this sprite is going to be a
01:39 - tile so we're going to drop the texture
01:44 - in there turn on regen and then the
01:48 - texture region region that we want to
01:50 - use is going to be one of these 64 by 64
01:53 - sections and so it's very useful to turn
01:56 - on the grid snap so that you can only
02:00 - select exactly 64 by 64 segments and you
02:06 - will make sure you get the tile sliced
02:08 - out correctly so there we go there's our
02:13 - is our first tile we're going to turn on
02:17 - snapping and the grid on the screen here
02:20 - too just because it's easier to place
02:22 - things around so this grid is very
02:25 - useful you can you just turn on the snap
02:28 - turn on the show and under configure you
02:30 - can set how you want it to look alright
02:33 - so here's our first tile and you're just
02:36 - going to do that with all the tiles you
02:38 - want to use now I'm going to skip that
02:42 - part because this can get kind of
02:43 - repetitive but you can just going to add
02:45 - another sprite like if i duplicate it
02:47 - throw another one over here
02:49 - we're going to just change the texture
02:52 - region and say we were using that one
02:54 - for example and you just keep doing that
02:58 - process for all the tiles that you want
03:00 - to use okay here's our top set after
03:03 - I've sliced out a bunch of the tiles and
03:05 - I'm just using the ones for creating the
03:08 - the roads and things and and leaving out
03:11 - a lot of the other ones because I didn't
03:12 - feel like doing them but here's my pal
03:15 - set and I've just kind of grouped them
03:17 - together together visually the order
03:20 - that they are in in the inspector here
03:25 - is the order they're going to show up in
03:27 - your tile map as well so when you're
03:31 - drawing with them if you place them in
03:32 - some sort of order they'll remain
03:34 - organized in that in that order as well
03:37 - so so this scene now has just a bunch of
03:40 - sprites in it that define the tiles that
03:42 - I want to use for my map so then you're
03:44 - going to click on scene and you can say
03:46 - convert to tile set and when you do that
03:51 - you're going to save it as a TR es or a
03:56 - text resource file and you can place
04:00 - that wherever you want to place it and
04:02 - then you just hit save now we're ready
04:05 - to start making a tile map so I'm adding
04:07 - a new scene here and I'm going to add a
04:09 - tile map node okay and then this time
04:13 - I've node you see we'll have a bunch of
04:15 - properties the most important one is
04:17 - what mode you want so if you see here
04:20 - you can have a square map which is a
04:23 - bunch of squares you can have isometric
04:25 - which means you're going to have that
04:27 - skewed perspective where you're looking
04:29 - down at things from the side and then
04:31 - you can also put custom here and
04:33 - customize how you want your map to be
04:36 - deformed from square we're going to
04:38 - leave this as square for our top down
04:40 - because that's the format the tiles are
04:42 - in make sure you set your cell size to
04:45 - the same size as your tiles quadrants
04:49 - size we don't need to worry about that
04:50 - the performance that the performance
04:52 - setting it just breaks up large maps
04:55 - into quadrants and only load them a bit
04:57 - at a time and then we can talk about
05:02 - these other ones after we have started
05:06 - drawing so we just need to set our tile
05:08 - set here so click load and select that
05:12 - tough that you just made and now over
05:14 - here on the side you will see all of
05:15 - your tiles showing up and you can you
05:18 - can zoom them in and out make them
05:20 - whatever size you want to look at them
05:22 - in and this pane will drag side to side
05:25 - as well if you want it to be a bunch of
05:27 - tiles at once and you're ready to start
05:30 - drawing so select a tile you want click
05:35 - out here and start drawing and then
05:36 - there you go you have some tiles and
05:39 - there's a couple of useful shortcuts as
05:42 - well these buttons over here are mirror
05:46 - in the X in the y-direction the
05:48 - shortcuts for those are a and F so for
05:50 - example if I've got this one here if I
05:53 - click a do the tile it's flipping back
05:57 - and forth when if I click S its flipping
05:59 - up and down these four buttons here will
06:02 - rotate the tile by 90 degrees so rotate
06:05 - rotate rotate and you can then go along
06:13 - and draw things however you want to draw
06:14 - them you probably want this one here
06:18 - let's rotate this that way there's some
06:25 - shortcuts here under the top menu here
06:28 - the bucket tool is useful you want to
06:31 - fill in some empty space you click that
06:35 - and it will fill in in paint bucket
06:39 - style that area
06:42 - you can the control is a shortcut for
06:46 - pick tile so if you want to draw some
06:48 - more of this tile for example and you
06:50 - don't want to go over here and find it
06:51 - in your time app just hold down ctrl and
06:53 - click on it and you'll pick up that tile
06:55 - again notice as I'm moving around up
06:59 - here is showing what my tile coordinates
07:02 - are right the origin right here is zero
07:05 - zero and you see the X increasing in
07:07 - this direction the Y increasing in this
07:09 - direction and when you hover over a tile
07:12 - it'll also tell you what tile number
07:14 - that is so that's tile number eight
07:16 - right here Tom number eight a couple of
07:20 - other things if you want to erase tiles
07:22 - just use the right mouse button and that
07:24 - will delete the tile if you have drawn a
07:29 - particular shape and you're wanting to
07:32 - duplicate it you can click on Tom up
07:36 - here and say select and that will let
07:38 - you drag a selection box around a group
07:41 - of tiles and then duplicate selection
07:44 - will duplicate that and the shortcuts
07:48 - for those are listed right next to the
07:51 - commands so here's a simple map maybe
07:55 - for a tower defense game where you have
07:57 - some mobs coming in and let's say you
07:59 - want to play some objects on this so
08:02 - I've got another house idea that has
08:05 - some rocks and trees and things and I
08:07 - want to place those in my map and I
08:10 - didn't make them part of the original
08:11 - tile set because I want them to be laid
08:15 - on top and so if you want to have layers
08:17 - of Tom Maps you can have as many as you
08:20 - want you can just add another tile map
08:22 - this might be for objects and then we're
08:27 - just going to load that tile set so
08:30 - we're going to load that tile set here
08:31 - the objects tile set and then you can
08:34 - just kind of sprinkle these around
08:36 - wherever you want there to be some trees
08:41 - and rocks and things
08:45 - and that's how you would do your various
08:53 - decorations and things and that's the
08:56 - basics of using a tile map but what if
08:58 - you want some of these tiles to be
09:00 - interactive you want the them to be part
09:03 - of the environment and when the player
09:04 - moves around or other objects move
09:07 - around you want them to be we want them
09:10 - to have collision on them or various
09:13 - other things well you have a few options
09:15 - there so when you're creating your tiles
09:20 - you can attach to these sprites three
09:26 - different things you can cut you can
09:28 - attach a static body which means it's
09:30 - going to have a collision shape so you
09:34 - can define that you can use a collision
09:36 - shape or a collision polygon which we'll
09:37 - see in a second you can attach a
09:40 - navigation polygon which will allow it
09:44 - to be part of a navigation layer if you
09:48 - want to use pathfinding on your map and
09:50 - you can also attach a light occluder 2d
09:54 - so that you can make all or part of your
09:56 - tile block light when you have lighting
09:59 - on your 2d map so the most common one is
10:04 - to put collisions on right very often
10:07 - need to do that and to do that let's
10:09 - take a look at making a 2d platformer
10:12 - out of tiles okay for this example I'm
10:15 - going to be using this sprite sheet
10:18 - which has buncha tiles for making
10:20 - different types of platforms and ramps
10:22 - and things for a 2d platformer so here's
10:26 - my sprite that I've made using one of
10:28 - those tiles and I'm going to attach to
10:31 - that sprite a static body 2d and this
10:36 - static body 2d is going to have a
10:39 - collision we can use a collision shape
10:42 - where we can use a Cochin polygon I'm
10:44 - going to use a collision polygon and
10:45 - I'll show you why so if we zoom in on
10:47 - this right and we set use pixel snap I
10:54 - want to make sure I'm snapping to the
10:56 - pixel as I draw the polygon
10:58 - okay drawing a polygon is very easy you
11:00 - click on the little pencil here and you
11:03 - just start clicking locations where you
11:06 - want corners and then when you click
11:09 - back you have now connected up and made
11:11 - a polygon if we zoom in you can click on
11:14 - this button right here to adjust the
11:20 - positioning of your polygon and this is
11:23 - this is just a plain old square tile so
11:25 - you see I was off down here in the
11:26 - corner a little bit so I'll move that
11:28 - one over this is a plain old square tile
11:29 - so we're just going to have a square
11:31 - collision now you want to make sure that
11:35 - you're very careful about getting the
11:38 - edges of your collision polygon lined up
11:42 - with the edges of the tile so that when
11:45 - you place these in the map there won't
11:47 - be there won't be gaps if you have
11:49 - another tile next to it and you had a
11:51 - problem like this then the next tile
11:54 - over would not connect up exactly and
11:57 - when your player walks along you're
11:59 - going to get stuck on little corners and
12:02 - have all sorts of strange collisions
12:05 - happening so make sure you have
12:07 - everything lined up just right so here's
12:11 - a bunch of other tiles that I've added
12:13 - and some of these tiles have curved
12:17 - corners so we can see if we look at this
12:20 - one this collision polygon I've added
12:23 - some corners here to give it a little
12:26 - bit of a rounded edge and you can do
12:29 - that we've got triangular ones here
12:34 - here's kind of like the top of a column
12:36 - that has two rounded sides and I've just
12:40 - sort of rounded those out a little bit
12:42 - so now this is my tile set and I just
12:47 - save this as a tile set to use in my map
12:49 - and when you draw your map you're going
12:51 - to draw it out the same way we did with
12:53 - the top-down map place the tiles where
12:55 - you want them rotate them around
12:57 - whatever and then just to show you what
13:00 - it looks like with a in action with a
13:04 - player I've just made a little level
13:07 - here with the map and a player sprite
13:09 - that I've made from another project
13:12 - and if we hit play on this you'll see
13:16 - that there's the sprite and I can move
13:18 - around and I have collision everywhere
13:23 - that I drew it on each tile if you look
13:33 - at if you turn on collision shapes you
13:35 - can see that each of these polygons is
13:41 - being blended together and we don't see
13:43 - any gaps which is which is good that's
13:45 - what we wanted to see so I hope this
13:47 - video helps you when you're making your
13:49 - own tile maps in Godot there's actually
13:52 - a lot more that you can do with time
13:55 - apps this video is getting kind of long
13:57 - so I'm going to break this into a second
13:59 - installment and in the next one I will
14:01 - talk about how you can interact with
14:05 - tile Maps through GD script so that you
14:09 - can make dynamic maps you can make
14:11 - animated tiles lots of different things
14:14 - thanks for watching and I'll see you
14:17 - next time
14:25 - you

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back to know your nodes this is the series of Godot game engine videos where we take a single node type and show how it's used this time around we're going to be talking about a very popular node that a lot of people have trouble with it's the tile map node time app games are really common they're used for all kinds of styles of games like dungeon crawlers Legend of Zelda style RPGs strategy games even sidescrolling platformers like Megaman use tiles to design their levels sometimes it's obvious that the game is using tiles and sometimes they're not very visible at all but they're still being used behind the scenes basically all it means is that a grid of tiles is being used to layout the game world the graphics the map the movement of this price everything is based on an underlying grid and Godot has all sorts of tools to help you build out your tile map and interact with it as you're making your game so let's get started the first thing you need for your tile map is you need a tile set a tile set is a collection of the images that you're going to use to draw your map with so I have here a art pack for a topdown towerdefense style game that's made up of 64 by 64 tiles and also two different colors and that's what we're going to use to make our map with Sol so start a new scene and just add a node 2d for your root node I'm just calling this tile fit top down and then you're going to add a sprite and this sprite is going to be a tile so we're going to drop the texture in there turn on regen and then the texture region region that we want to use is going to be one of these 64 by 64 sections and so it's very useful to turn on the grid snap so that you can only select exactly 64 by 64 segments and you will make sure you get the tile sliced out correctly so there we go there's our is our first tile we're going to turn on snapping and the grid on the screen here too just because it's easier to place things around so this grid is very useful you can you just turn on the snap turn on the show and under configure you can set how you want it to look alright so here's our first tile and you're just going to do that with all the tiles you want to use now I'm going to skip that part because this can get kind of repetitive but you can just going to add another sprite like if i duplicate it throw another one over here we're going to just change the texture region and say we were using that one for example and you just keep doing that process for all the tiles that you want to use okay here's our top set after I've sliced out a bunch of the tiles and I'm just using the ones for creating the the roads and things and and leaving out a lot of the other ones because I didn't feel like doing them but here's my pal set and I've just kind of grouped them together together visually the order that they are in in the inspector here is the order they're going to show up in your tile map as well so when you're drawing with them if you place them in some sort of order they'll remain organized in that in that order as well so so this scene now has just a bunch of sprites in it that define the tiles that I want to use for my map so then you're going to click on scene and you can say convert to tile set and when you do that you're going to save it as a TR es or a text resource file and you can place that wherever you want to place it and then you just hit save now we're ready to start making a tile map so I'm adding a new scene here and I'm going to add a tile map node okay and then this time I've node you see we'll have a bunch of properties the most important one is what mode you want so if you see here you can have a square map which is a bunch of squares you can have isometric which means you're going to have that skewed perspective where you're looking down at things from the side and then you can also put custom here and customize how you want your map to be deformed from square we're going to leave this as square for our top down because that's the format the tiles are in make sure you set your cell size to the same size as your tiles quadrants size we don't need to worry about that the performance that the performance setting it just breaks up large maps into quadrants and only load them a bit at a time and then we can talk about these other ones after we have started drawing so we just need to set our tile set here so click load and select that tough that you just made and now over here on the side you will see all of your tiles showing up and you can you can zoom them in and out make them whatever size you want to look at them in and this pane will drag side to side as well if you want it to be a bunch of tiles at once and you're ready to start drawing so select a tile you want click out here and start drawing and then there you go you have some tiles and there's a couple of useful shortcuts as well these buttons over here are mirror in the X in the ydirection the shortcuts for those are a and F so for example if I've got this one here if I click a do the tile it's flipping back and forth when if I click S its flipping up and down these four buttons here will rotate the tile by 90 degrees so rotate rotate rotate and you can then go along and draw things however you want to draw them you probably want this one here let's rotate this that way there's some shortcuts here under the top menu here the bucket tool is useful you want to fill in some empty space you click that and it will fill in in paint bucket style that area you can the control is a shortcut for pick tile so if you want to draw some more of this tile for example and you don't want to go over here and find it in your time app just hold down ctrl and click on it and you'll pick up that tile again notice as I'm moving around up here is showing what my tile coordinates are right the origin right here is zero zero and you see the X increasing in this direction the Y increasing in this direction and when you hover over a tile it'll also tell you what tile number that is so that's tile number eight right here Tom number eight a couple of other things if you want to erase tiles just use the right mouse button and that will delete the tile if you have drawn a particular shape and you're wanting to duplicate it you can click on Tom up here and say select and that will let you drag a selection box around a group of tiles and then duplicate selection will duplicate that and the shortcuts for those are listed right next to the commands so here's a simple map maybe for a tower defense game where you have some mobs coming in and let's say you want to play some objects on this so I've got another house idea that has some rocks and trees and things and I want to place those in my map and I didn't make them part of the original tile set because I want them to be laid on top and so if you want to have layers of Tom Maps you can have as many as you want you can just add another tile map this might be for objects and then we're just going to load that tile set so we're going to load that tile set here the objects tile set and then you can just kind of sprinkle these around wherever you want there to be some trees and rocks and things and that's how you would do your various decorations and things and that's the basics of using a tile map but what if you want some of these tiles to be interactive you want the them to be part of the environment and when the player moves around or other objects move around you want them to be we want them to have collision on them or various other things well you have a few options there so when you're creating your tiles you can attach to these sprites three different things you can cut you can attach a static body which means it's going to have a collision shape so you can define that you can use a collision shape or a collision polygon which we'll see in a second you can attach a navigation polygon which will allow it to be part of a navigation layer if you want to use pathfinding on your map and you can also attach a light occluder 2d so that you can make all or part of your tile block light when you have lighting on your 2d map so the most common one is to put collisions on right very often need to do that and to do that let's take a look at making a 2d platformer out of tiles okay for this example I'm going to be using this sprite sheet which has buncha tiles for making different types of platforms and ramps and things for a 2d platformer so here's my sprite that I've made using one of those tiles and I'm going to attach to that sprite a static body 2d and this static body 2d is going to have a collision we can use a collision shape where we can use a Cochin polygon I'm going to use a collision polygon and I'll show you why so if we zoom in on this right and we set use pixel snap I want to make sure I'm snapping to the pixel as I draw the polygon okay drawing a polygon is very easy you click on the little pencil here and you just start clicking locations where you want corners and then when you click back you have now connected up and made a polygon if we zoom in you can click on this button right here to adjust the positioning of your polygon and this is this is just a plain old square tile so you see I was off down here in the corner a little bit so I'll move that one over this is a plain old square tile so we're just going to have a square collision now you want to make sure that you're very careful about getting the edges of your collision polygon lined up with the edges of the tile so that when you place these in the map there won't be there won't be gaps if you have another tile next to it and you had a problem like this then the next tile over would not connect up exactly and when your player walks along you're going to get stuck on little corners and have all sorts of strange collisions happening so make sure you have everything lined up just right so here's a bunch of other tiles that I've added and some of these tiles have curved corners so we can see if we look at this one this collision polygon I've added some corners here to give it a little bit of a rounded edge and you can do that we've got triangular ones here here's kind of like the top of a column that has two rounded sides and I've just sort of rounded those out a little bit so now this is my tile set and I just save this as a tile set to use in my map and when you draw your map you're going to draw it out the same way we did with the topdown map place the tiles where you want them rotate them around whatever and then just to show you what it looks like with a in action with a player I've just made a little level here with the map and a player sprite that I've made from another project and if we hit play on this you'll see that there's the sprite and I can move around and I have collision everywhere that I drew it on each tile if you look at if you turn on collision shapes you can see that each of these polygons is being blended together and we don't see any gaps which is which is good that's what we wanted to see so I hope this video helps you when you're making your own tile maps in Godot there's actually a lot more that you can do with time apps this video is getting kind of long so I'm going to break this into a second installment and in the next one I will talk about how you can interact with tile Maps through GD script so that you can make dynamic maps you can make animated tiles lots of different things thanks for watching and I'll see you next time you
