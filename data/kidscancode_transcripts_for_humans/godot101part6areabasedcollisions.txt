00:00 - welcome back to judo 101 series where I
00:03 - teach you the basics of the judo game
00:06 - engine this is lesson number six we're
00:09 - going to talk about how to detect when
00:11 - two areas collide or overlap and
00:14 - specifically we're going to make our
00:16 - player walk around and collect gems that
00:19 - are scattered around the screen okay
00:21 - let's get started so to start things off
00:23 - I've made a new scene called gem and
00:26 - it's just an area to be node with a
00:31 - sprite and a rectangular collision shape
00:35 - and so I went ahead and save that as Jim
00:38 - and this will be the scene that will
00:40 - spawn the gems that our character is
00:41 - going to walk around and collect so over
00:44 - on our main scene we just need to link
00:48 - the player so we're going to instance a
00:50 - player in there and then we're going to
00:53 - add a script for the main scene okay so
01:00 - we're going to have a score variable to
01:02 - keep track of how many we have collected
01:05 - in there ready we're going to set
01:08 - process to true and we're going to write
01:14 - a new function called spawn gem and the
01:22 - spawn gems function is just going to
01:24 - take a number for how many gems we want
01:28 - to spawn so we're just going to count to
01:31 - num and we're going to spawn a bunch of
01:35 - gem and to keep things organized what
01:39 - we're going to do is add a node here and
01:42 - we're going to call this Jim container
01:45 - so this is just a node that's going to
01:48 - hold all of our gems organized
01:50 - underneath it so we'll be they'll help
01:52 - us keep track of how many gems are left
01:55 - on the screen all that kind of thing so
01:58 - up here I'm going to say just get a
02:03 - reference to the to that node so I don't
02:07 - have to type get node all the time
02:09 - [Music]
02:10 - and so here what we're going to do is we
02:14 - are going to say so we're going to need
02:16 - to spawn gems so we need to actually
02:19 - load the team to you preload for this
02:29 - and we want to get the gem seen so if we
02:33 - go over here you can right click on this
02:36 - and choose copy path and then you can
02:39 - just paste it right in there
02:41 - if you have it inside of folders and
02:43 - things you want to type out the whole
02:44 - path okay so we're just going to make a
02:50 - gem we're going to add it as a child to
02:56 - the gym container and then we need to
03:03 - set its location to somewhere random and
03:07 - to do that we need to know the screen
03:09 - size just like we did on the player
03:14 - we're going to say screen size get view
03:19 - for it correct size and then our random
03:26 - location we're going to just say G dot
03:30 - set pause
03:38 - you
03:41 - so now if we if we do spawn gems 10 and
03:43 - are ready function then we are going to
03:46 - see and jump pop up in random locations
03:51 - which we forgot to do randomized
03:56 - obviously we don't want the random
04:01 - locations always be the same okay so
04:03 - there's our gems now well all we want is
04:05 - we want to know when the player I'll
04:08 - tend to one so that we can make it
04:10 - disappear like it's been picked up now
04:12 - that means that we want to know when the
04:15 - player's collision rectangle has overlap
04:19 - the gems collision rectangle
04:22 - they are both area 2 DS we're going to
04:25 - go over to our gem team and we're going
04:28 - to add a script to it gem and all we
04:36 - want to do in this gem script is tell it
04:38 - to disappear when the player will
04:43 - collapse it so you don't actually need
04:45 - anything in our ready because we're
04:47 - going to use a signal on the gem on any
04:51 - node to click over here on node you can
04:54 - see what signals that body you can or
04:59 - that object can produce and so on the
05:03 - area to D it can detect when other areas
05:07 - enter or exit it and it can also detect
05:10 - when other bodies enter it will exit it
05:14 - since the player is also an area area
05:17 - enter is the one we're going to want as
05:20 - soon as the players rectangle enters the
05:23 - gems rectangle this signal is going to
05:26 - be produced and a signal is something
05:28 - that you can listen for and do something
05:30 - whenever it happens and it's going to
05:33 - tell us the area that that it was so so
05:39 - we're going to take that signal we're
05:40 - going to click connect and then you can
05:42 - choose a node you want to connect that
05:44 - to you want to do something to one of
05:47 - the other nodes you can we're going to
05:48 - leave it on gem we're going to leave the
05:51 - name default name as it is
05:54 - now it's going to create the function
05:55 - for us so on Jim area enter we can say
06:02 - to actually just start with let's just
06:06 - print area we're going to print out what
06:09 - happens when they overlap so going to
06:11 - print out what area it's all so you can
06:13 - see what happens when we run it this is
06:15 - a good way to troubleshoot see when I
06:18 - entered that one it printed out area if
06:20 - you notice that it already printed out
06:21 - some other areas that's because some of
06:24 - these gems are overlapping if all we did
06:28 - was delete the gem when another area
06:31 - entered it these gems would have deleted
06:33 - each other right and we don't want that
06:35 - we want it to only do it when the player
06:37 - enters so we can do that if we look at
06:42 - the name so if we say area get name
06:44 - that's going to tell us the name of the
06:46 - area that overlaps so to try this and
06:49 - see here now when I go on the gem to
06:53 - print player so new the area of the
06:55 - entered was player and in the case of a
06:58 - gem overlapping if we can get that to
07:01 - happen there we go we a couple of gems
07:06 - overlaps so we get the name of them and
07:09 - because there doesent responding a bunch
07:11 - of things named gem good all times these
07:13 - unique names to them just because every
07:15 - every node has to have a unique name in
07:18 - the tree that is in so these gems
07:21 - triggers but we don't care about those
07:23 - all we care about is this is the player
07:25 - so we're just going to say if area dot
07:30 - get name is player and if it is then
07:37 - we're going to queue tree so now when
07:42 - the gems overlap they won't bleed each
07:43 - other but if we hit one it is gone okay
07:50 - now over here in our main we can't well
07:53 - when we have picked up all the gems
07:55 - because the gem container is going to be
07:58 - empty all right when Jim container is
08:01 - empty
08:03 - I want to spawn some more gems so I'm
08:06 - going to make a going to make a level
08:11 - variable here and we're going to tell it
08:15 - to increment that level every time we
08:19 - gobble up all the gems so in the process
08:24 - function what we're going to do is we're
08:32 - going to say if gem container get child
08:38 - count so tell us how many children it
08:41 - has so if the child count is zero
08:42 - the gem container is empty so we're
08:45 - going to increment our level to the next
08:47 - one and we're going to spawn level times
08:51 - ten gems so we'll spawned 20 of them on
08:54 - level two and so on that should let us
08:58 - run around and clear the screen and then
09:01 - have some more to go pick up okay now
09:06 - the next step is what we'd like to do is
09:09 - have you get some points when you select
09:13 - a gem so that means when the gem gets
09:16 - deleted we want to add to the score
09:18 - here's the thing the code that's
09:20 - deleting the gem is over here on the gem
09:23 - itself in the script that runs on the
09:25 - gem and the score is in this script
09:28 - which is on main so if we look at the
09:31 - tree the gem is going to be underneath
09:33 - the gem container and that's where the
09:37 - script that is going to detect that the
09:40 - collision and delete the gem but the
09:43 - score is up here on the main and that's
09:46 - where we're keeping track of the score
09:48 - and where we're going to show the score
09:49 - so we need to we need a way for the node
09:52 - script it's running on a node down here
09:54 - farther down the tree to talk to a node
09:58 - that is farther up and this is a really
10:03 - common thing that you need to do and
10:04 - and there are two different ways to do
10:08 - it one of them is kind of the obvious
10:11 - way that a lot of beginners do it which
10:14 - is wrong and then there is the right way
10:18 - which might not be obvious at first but
10:22 - hopefully I can explain it too clearly
10:25 - enough that you will understand it and
10:27 - start doing it this is a really
10:29 - important concept to get right so I am
10:32 - going to get a Kate the next video
10:33 - talking about doing proper communication
10:37 - between nodes so I will save that for
10:40 - the next video and we will call this one
10:43 - complete thanks for watching and I'll
10:48 - see you next time
10:56 - you

welcome back to judo 101 series where I teach you the basics of the judo game engine this is lesson number six we're going to talk about how to detect when two areas collide or overlap and

have a score variable to keep track of how many we have collected in there ready we're going to set process to true and we're going to write a new function called spawn gem and the spawn gems function is just going to take a number for how many gems we want to spawn so we're just going to count to num and we're going to spawn a bunch of gem and to keep things organized what we're going to do is add
