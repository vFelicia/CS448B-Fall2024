00:00 - welcome back to part 9 of the circle
00:02 - jump game development series in this
00:05 - installment we're going to test the game
00:07 - out on my phone
00:08 - fix a couple of bugs and add a little
00:11 - bit more visual flair alright let's get
00:14 - started so before going any further in
00:16 - the game I thought that it would be a
00:18 - good time to do a little Android testing
00:20 - so I exported the project onto my
00:24 - Android phone
00:25 - I've had Samsung Galaxy s8 and I
00:29 - realized also as I'm recording this that
00:31 - I don't have a good camera to show you
00:33 - what it looks like on the phone but the
00:36 - project exported fine and it ran but
00:39 - there was a problem and it had to do
00:42 - with the HUD and I'm gonna show you in
00:46 - the HTML export has a similar problem so
00:50 - I'll show you what it looks like and
00:51 - then we'll look at how we can try fixing
00:54 - it so here's the game running in an HTML
00:58 - export and watch what happens when I hit
01:01 - play just yet stuttering let's go there
01:08 - there did you see that so it seems that
01:11 - whenever we play this animation on the
01:17 - HUD the one that shows the message this
01:19 - animation is lagging like crazy and on
01:23 - the phone it's very very bad and so I
01:27 - did some experimentation one thing I
01:29 - thought was that might be GL es 3 so I
01:33 - switched over to GL ES 2 and I exported
01:35 - on that phone and it was a little better
01:37 - but it wasn't still wasn't working right
01:39 - so it wasn't smooth and so I was about
01:42 - to give up and thinking that maybe we
01:44 - would have to go with you know do this
01:46 - message in a different way when I
01:48 - realized that if I go over here into the
01:50 - project settings under rendering quality
01:53 - there's an option called use over
01:55 - sampling for dynamic fonts and guess
01:58 - what we're using for our message we're
02:00 - using a dynamic font so if I turn that
02:02 - off
02:03 - it becomes silky smooth on the phone so
02:08 - for now I'm going to stick to GL es 3
02:10 - again we're still I'm reserving that
02:13 - decision
02:13 - until we get some more testing done but
02:16 - for right now it works fine with either
02:18 - so let's talk about exporting real quick
02:21 - the best place for you to go if you want
02:24 - to learn how to export your project is
02:26 - on the Godot Doc's there is an exporting
02:29 - tutorial and it talks about exporting
02:32 - the dodge the creeps tutorial game but
02:35 - the process is pretty much the same you
02:38 - have to download the export templates
02:40 - for the version of Godot you're using
02:42 - and then you can set up presets for
02:46 - whatever platforms you want to exports
02:48 - project to and in the case of Android
02:51 - you're also going to need to download
02:53 - the Android SDK and the Java JDK and
02:59 - that will install all the tools you need
03:03 - to have your computer talk directly to
03:05 - the phone and or whatever device you
03:08 - have and let you generate your keystore
03:11 - which you need in order to compile the
03:15 - project and when you do that it's really
03:18 - nice I when I plug in my phone to the
03:21 - usb I get this window this little button
03:24 - appears right here which lets me export
03:26 - if I click on the little robot I can
03:29 - choose my phone and it will compile the
03:32 - project upload it to my phone and launch
03:35 - it all with one click if you're curious
03:38 - how to do it for iOS it's a bit more
03:40 - cumbersome you have to have Xcode
03:43 - installed which means you have to be on
03:44 - a Mac and there's a few more steps you
03:46 - got to go through to get the project
03:49 - exported so we're gonna stick to Android
03:52 - to begin with because it's a lot more
03:54 - frictionless once we're ready and we're
03:58 - pretty confident that we're done with
04:01 - the project we're ready to put it on the
04:03 - App Store we can deal with the iOS
04:05 - exporting then alright let's get on to
04:09 - the next feature we're gonna add I'm
04:11 - gonna make a new scene here and I'm
04:13 - going to use a canvas layer this is
04:17 - gonna be my background
04:21 - this is gonna sit behind the game and
04:24 - give me something besides this boring
04:27 - gray nothingness and so this is a canvas
04:30 - layer which means I wanted to I want to
04:33 - use the X I wanted to be behind
04:34 - everything else so I'm gonna put it on
04:35 - layer negative one so that it'll be
04:39 - behind everything let's save that and
04:43 - then it's going to have a color rect set
04:51 - to full rect that's going to be our
04:55 - background let's just stick that to
04:57 - black to start with and already over
05:01 - here if we add this to our main like
05:04 - instance this in here and we have a nice
05:07 - black background and now we have a nice
05:16 - black background and then I also this is
05:21 - another thing that's gonna require some
05:23 - testing I like the way it looks but it
05:26 - also could be problematic with our phone
05:30 - export which is I want to add a world
05:33 - environment and we're going to say new
05:41 - environment and background mode we're
05:44 - going to set to canvas that's what this
05:48 - is going to produce and I want to turn
05:51 - on glow depending on how you have the
05:56 - settings the glow can be a little
05:58 - overdone but if you use it subtly it can
06:01 - look pretty good here are the glow
06:03 - settings I have settled on intensity
06:06 - 0.37 threshold point six four and
06:10 - additive mode and that's gonna look
06:13 - pretty Goods going to give the circle as
06:15 - a nice glow little neon effect and the
06:20 - drawback to this is glow does not work
06:23 - in GL es too so if we wanted the effect
06:26 - in GL ES 2 we would have to write a
06:29 - shader so depending on what we finally
06:32 - decide this might go back out the window
06:34 - again
06:35 - but until then I'm gonna keep it in
06:37 - there it was easy enough to add and it's
06:38 - easy enough to disable if it isn't
06:41 - working okay the other thing I'm going
06:43 - to add to the background here is I'm
06:44 - going to add a CPU particles to D and
06:48 - this is just like a particle to denote
06:50 - it just uses the CPU instead of the GPU
06:53 - to do its animation and it is a little
06:58 - more mobile friendly against our game is
07:01 - not going to be at all taxing on the
07:04 - phone CPU we have only a few objects on
07:07 - the screen at a time not a lot of not a
07:09 - lot going on it's not 3d CPU particles
07:12 - we can be fine with now if you've done
07:16 - particles before you know there's a lot
07:19 - of settings that you can play around
07:23 - with and what I want this to do is to
07:25 - make a sort of background of floating
07:29 - circles as if they're off in the
07:31 - distance so smaller circles that are
07:33 - just sort of coasting down so I'll put
07:36 - in all the settings then I'll just go
07:37 - over them rather than have you watch me
07:39 - do everything okay so here the particles
07:42 - doing their things they're just sort of
07:43 - coasting down in the background so I set
07:47 - the amount of for the lifetime to 20
07:50 - that's how long they're gonna stay alive
07:52 - pre-processing 210 that's so that when
07:55 - we first hit run it's not going to be
07:59 - empty and we'll see the first one come
08:00 - on though it'll pre run some of the
08:03 - anime or some of the particles so that
08:05 - they look like they've been running for
08:07 - some time already in the draw section
08:10 - I've put the circle texture same one we
08:12 - used for our circle in the game I change
08:16 - the emission shape to a box which means
08:19 - that's where these will spawn so I've
08:22 - increased it to 240 in Y you notice it's
08:27 - going x and y and you'll see why in a
08:28 - minute
08:29 - spread I set to zero gravity I set to
08:32 - zero initial velocity is 75 with a
08:36 - random factor of 0.6 that's why some of
08:38 - them are going a little faster and some
08:40 - a little slower scale I set to 0.2
08:43 - because you know the full full scale is
08:45 - way too big
08:48 - and then I have a little bit of
08:49 - randomness on that too so that they're
08:51 - not all exactly the same size hue
08:55 - variation is how we're getting the
08:56 - different colors and then it's just
09:00 - centered above the top of the screen and
09:03 - I rotated at 90 degrees because the
09:06 - orientation of the particle node
09:09 - determines which direction this initial
09:12 - velocity is pointing so by default it's
09:15 - pointing along the x-axis so they were
09:17 - all emitting in this direction so since
09:19 - we rotated it 90 degrees that's why the
09:23 - variation in the box size is why because
09:25 - we're rotated 90 degrees but there we go
09:28 - so that looks pretty nice I think and
09:30 - will give us a little bit of something
09:33 - interesting to look at instead of a
09:35 - featureless nothing in the background
09:38 - and they're on a different layer from
09:41 - the circles so the glow does not apply
09:43 - to them all right that's going to do it
09:46 - for this one I'm going to put a copy of
09:51 - the android apk in the notes section
09:56 - below
09:56 - it'd be great if any of you out there
09:58 - with android devices could throw it on
10:01 - there or export it yourself and give it
10:04 - a shot and let me know how things work
10:06 - and we can try and get a handle on any
10:08 - other mobile issues that might be
10:10 - cropping up before we get too much
10:12 - further along in development all right

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back to part 9 of the circle jump game development series in this installment we're going to test the game out on my phone fix a couple of bugs and add a little bit more visual flair alright let's get started so before going any further in the game I thought that it would be a good time to do a little Android testing so I exported the project onto my Android phone I've had Samsung Galaxy s8 and I realized also as I'm recording this that I don't have a good camera to show you what it looks like on the phone but the project exported fine and it ran but there was a problem and it had to do with the HUD and I'm gonna show you in the HTML export has a similar problem so I'll show you what it looks like and then we'll look at how we can try fixing it so here's the game running in an HTML export and watch what happens when I hit play just yet stuttering let's go there there did you see that so it seems that whenever we play this animation on the HUD the one that shows the message this animation is lagging like crazy and on the phone it's very very bad and so I did some experimentation one thing I thought was that might be GL es 3 so I switched over to GL ES 2 and I exported on

we get some more testing done but for right now it works fine with either so let's talk about exporting real quick the best place for you to go if you want to learn how to export your project is on
