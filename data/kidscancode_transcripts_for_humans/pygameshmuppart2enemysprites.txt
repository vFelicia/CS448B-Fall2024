00:01 - welcome back to our PI game tutorial
00:03 - series we're working on our up game and
00:06 - in this video we're going to learn how
00:09 - to add some enemy sprites please check
00:12 - the links below if you're missing any of
00:14 - the code samples where you need to catch
00:16 - up on previous videos okay the next
00:21 - thing we want to add to our game is the
00:23 - enemies or at least the things that
00:26 - we're shooting at we might eventually
00:28 - decide to make them alien spaceships or
00:31 - meteors floating around in space or you
00:35 - might even decide that your I don't know
00:37 - a unicorn shooting rainbows at squirrels
00:39 - I don't know what the enemies are going
00:41 - to look like yet but we so we want to
00:44 - name it something generic something that
00:46 - we won't have to be too specific about
00:49 - and the generic word for an object in a
00:52 - game that moves around is mob which you
00:55 - might have heard before and so we're
00:57 - going to set up a sprite for the mobs
01:01 - and then later on we can make them look
01:05 - like whatever we want them to look like
01:06 - and we're gonna start by creating a
01:10 - sprite just like we did
01:13 - forgot my underlines there just like we
01:15 - did when we set up the player we have to
01:19 - do the initial part of the required
01:23 - things that you need when you're making
01:25 - a sprite the init the image and for
01:33 - these I'm going to make these we're also
01:36 - you're just going to use rectangles for
01:37 - now just because we just need something
01:41 - specific or something generic to put in
01:43 - there till we decide what we want them
01:44 - to be and I'm going to fill those with
01:49 - red okay and then the rect will just be
01:59 - okay now how do we want to place these
02:03 - on the screen well there's going to be
02:05 - potentially a lot of these so every time
02:08 - they spawn we want them to appear and
02:11 - then start coming down the screen
02:14 - towards us well if we just make them pop
02:18 - into existence up here at the top of the
02:20 - screen that's going to look kind of
02:21 - weird like they just appeared so instead
02:24 - what we want them to do is we want them
02:25 - to spawn somewhere off the top of the
02:28 - screen above the window so that they
02:30 - will come moving onto it like they came
02:33 - from you know somewhere off screen so we
02:36 - want to pick a couple of random numbers
02:38 - for the location so the x-coordinate for
02:43 - where it's going to spawn is just going
02:45 - to be a random number between 0 and
02:51 - width minus however wide our sprite is
02:57 - right that way if our sprite is in this
03:02 - case right now it's 30 pixels wide so
03:05 - it'll be anywhere between 0 and with
03:09 - minus 30 so it'll pop up here and won't
03:12 - be sticking off the screen this just
03:14 - ensures that it will always appear
03:16 - somewhere between the left and the right
03:19 - and you can write 0 there number between
03:23 - 0 and width but if you leave that out I
03:25 - am just I mean a Python just assumes
03:27 - it's a zero okay self dot recta y we
03:32 - just want to make it spawn somewhere up
03:34 - above the screen and I'm gonna randomize
03:37 - that too so that we get them more spread
03:41 - out so that they don't all start at the
03:42 - exact same spot so we're just going to
03:45 - make that somewhere between oh say minus
03:49 - 100 and minus 40 say and then the last
03:57 - thing we need is we need to randomize
03:58 - their speed because we don't want them
04:01 - to all be moving the exact same speed
04:03 - they're gonna be they'd be all in a
04:05 - group and a clump just moving at the
04:06 - same speed so we're gonna randomize that
04:09 - so that we have some slow ones and we
04:12 - have some fast ones okay and then the
04:17 - update for this sprite will just be to
04:20 - move
04:23 - - dot y + equals speed y okay so it's
04:30 - just gonna move downwards and that's
04:32 - fine but what do we do when it moves all
04:34 - the way down and it goes off the bottom
04:35 - of the screen well we could delete the
04:40 - sprites whenever they go off the bottom
04:41 - and then spawn new ones again up at the
04:44 - top or even simpler if it goes off the
04:48 - bottom we could just move it back
04:52 - somewhere up at the top but we don't
04:54 - want to just move it straight to the top
04:55 - because then if you don't then you'll
04:56 - know that if you miss one it's going to
04:58 - come right back in the same place again
04:59 - so we probably want to randomize that
05:03 - again so what I'm gonna do is I'm going
05:05 - to copy this stuff here and I'm going to
05:09 - say if the rect dot top is greater than
05:15 - height and I'm just gonna put plus ten
05:19 - here just a little bit so we make sure
05:20 - we leave some extra space and I'm gonna
05:22 - paste that stuff there so if it ever
05:25 - goes off the bottom we basically just
05:27 - reran demise its location up at the top
05:30 - okay and that's going to do it that's
05:33 - our mob sprite so all we have to do down
05:35 - here is now spawn a bunch of them but
05:39 - there's something else we want to do
05:41 - first the other thing we want to do is
05:46 - we want to create a group to hold all
05:49 - the mobs and the reason we're going to
05:53 - do this is you know we have the all
05:56 - sprites group and that's fine that's the
05:58 - thing that makes them all update and
06:00 - them all draw so being in the all
06:02 - sprites group will make our mob sprites
06:06 - work but we're gonna make a mobs group
06:08 - as well because later on in the next
06:13 - step or two we're gonna get to the point
06:16 - where we want to see if the player runs
06:18 - into any of the mobs and if the mobs are
06:21 - just in a group then it's very easy to
06:24 - just say did the player hit any of the
06:27 - mobs and you'll see that in a little bit
06:29 - when we start doing that part of the
06:32 - game but first let's spawn some mobs so
06:34 - we've got a group to put them in now
06:37 - and so we're just gonna say for I in
06:40 - range eight let's say so we'll start out
06:43 - with eight mobs and see if that's a good
06:45 - amount okay and I'm just gonna spawn a
06:47 - new one and I'm just going to call it M
06:50 - cuz this is just a temporary name just
06:53 - so that we can add it all sprites dad
06:57 - and mobs dad okay so we're gonna add
07:03 - that mob to the all sprites group and to
07:06 - the mobs group and now once they're in
07:08 - the all sprites they are gonna get
07:09 - updated and all that stuff so let's see
07:14 - what happens
07:16 - oops we have a typo that tends to happen
07:20 - a lot when you're talking while you're
07:23 - typing some of you probably saw this as
07:24 - we were going through it and fixed it
07:28 - yourself but I left off my underlines
07:30 - there which I tend to do sometimes when
07:32 - I'm typing and talking at the same time
07:35 - but there will fix that error and now we
07:38 - should have some mobs streaming down the
07:41 - screen and see some of them are fast
07:43 - some of them are slow and they come in
07:48 - and out of the screen that's something
07:59 - else we could do is we could randomize
08:01 - the movement a little bit more and make
08:05 - the mobs have a little bit of diagonal
08:09 - movement so if we have a random speed in
08:11 - the x-direction then they'll sometimes
08:15 - be moving side-to-side so they'll be
08:16 - diagonally going across the screen so we
08:19 - just need to tell the update to use that
08:22 - speed X Y our speed X as well and then
08:29 - let's see what that looks like so now we
08:31 - have some running diagonally across now
08:36 - the main problem here is that sometimes
08:39 - they're going to start up here and go
08:41 - diagonally this way which means they're
08:42 - going to go off here and then it's going
08:44 - to take them a long time before they get
08:45 - all the way down greater than height and
08:48 - respawn again so it's a little bit on
08:51 - predictable so we could respawn them
08:52 - when they go off as well
08:55 - so we could say for left is less than
09:02 - zero actually let's let them go off a
09:05 - little bit let's say just a little bit
09:10 - or self-direct outright it's greater
09:13 - than with plus twenty and this line is
09:18 - getting kinda long so I probably gonna
09:20 - want to change that at some point to
09:23 - have to resize that a little so you can
09:26 - see the whole line and then we're gonna
09:29 - see them on the screen more often so we
09:34 - don't have to wait as long for them to
09:35 - show back up again if they are going
09:37 - sideways
09:42 - one really slow one right there okay

welcome back to our PI game tutorial series we're working on our up game and in this video we're going to learn how to add some enemy sprites please check the links below if you're missing any of the code samples where you need to catch up on previous videos okay the next thing we want to add to our game is the enemies or at least the things that we're shooting at we might eventually decide to
