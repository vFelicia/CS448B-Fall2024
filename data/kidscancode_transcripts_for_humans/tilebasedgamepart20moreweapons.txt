00:00 - all right welcome back to a game
00:01 - development with PI game this is part 20
00:04 - of our tile-based top-down zombie
00:07 - shooter and first of all if you have
00:09 - been following along I want to thank you
00:11 - for sticking with it this long the games
00:14 - really starting to shape up and one
00:17 - popular feature that's been requested
00:20 - that I decided it was time to start
00:22 - talking about was adding more weapons
00:25 - into the game so this time around we're
00:28 - gonna take our little
00:29 - pistol that the player has right now and
00:32 - we're gonna also add a shotgun very
00:34 - popular zombie fighting weapon alright
00:38 - so let's get started okay
00:41 - so in the settings right now we have all
00:44 - this information about how we want our
00:46 - gun to work but if we're gonna have
00:50 - multiple weapons we're gonna have one of
00:52 - different settings for each weapon
00:54 - alright the fire rate might be different
00:56 - for one gun versus another you know big
00:59 - gun will have a bigger kickback that
01:01 - kind of thing so we're gonna need a way
01:04 - to organize all this stuff so that we
01:06 - don't have
01:08 - you know so we have it easy to change
01:10 - and it's and it's organized and it's
01:12 - logically laid out so we're gonna with
01:17 - if we have the concept of having
01:18 - multiple weapons then we should just
01:20 - group all the data for those weapons
01:22 - together right so this is going to
01:23 - become our weapon settings category of
01:26 - our settings file for now I'm going to
01:29 - use the same image for all of the
01:33 - bullets
01:33 - we will talk about changing that later
01:37 - so what we're gonna do is we're gonna
01:39 - make a dictionary
01:41 - called weapons that's going to hold each
01:43 - of the different kinds of weapon okay so
01:46 - to start with well so so we have the
01:49 - pistol right that's the one that we
01:51 - currently are using okay and this is
01:55 - just going to have all the data of that
01:58 - okay so
02:00 - let's see we want to have
02:06 - so each of these keys in the dictionary
02:09 - is going to be one of the settings for
02:11 - the bullet right so
02:13 - let's feed is 500
02:15 - let's get this over here
02:19 - the bullet lifetime is a thousand I'm
02:23 - gonna keep the settings the same on the
02:25 - gun
02:27 - oops capitalize that bullet let's just
02:31 - call this rate this is the rate of fire
02:33 - of the gun the rate is
02:36 - actually gonna make that slightly bigger
02:38 - I think our gun was shooting too fast as
02:41 - it was and this is gonna be the pistol
02:42 - it's a small
02:44 - start a starting weapon so the kickback
02:48 - we've got the spread
02:51 - which we were using five we've got the
02:55 - damage very important how much damage it
02:59 - does and then I'm also going to
03:03 - have a bullet size here and for now I'm
03:07 - just gonna deal with having large and
03:09 - small large will be the size we're using
03:11 - right now the shotgun we're gonna want
03:14 - to have spray out a bunch of tiny little
03:18 - bullets so tiny pellets so we're gonna
03:20 - use a small size image for those but
03:23 - there we go what else do we need oh
03:26 - I know and one other thing is the bullet
03:30 - count so this is how many bullets does
03:33 - this gun fire right the shotgun is gonna
03:36 - spray out a bunch of small pellets so
03:38 - that number will be bigger but this is
03:39 - this is what the pistol will look like
03:41 - okay and so now I can just duplicate
03:44 - this whole thing I'm just going to
03:46 - duplicate this to make the
03:49 - shotgun
03:51 - okay and
03:53 - so let's see we need to
03:57 - what we need to do oh we have an extra
04:00 - space here so all we're going to do for
04:03 - the shotgun has just changed the values
04:05 - for these
04:06 - okay the shotgun bullets I think you're
04:09 - gonna travel a little bit slower
04:12 - they're going to last less time
04:16 - right it's not as a long-range a weapon
04:20 - the bullet count though is going to be a
04:23 - lot bunch of these little bullets are
04:24 - going to spray out
04:26 - gonna be small
04:27 - the shotgun is gonna have a little bit
04:30 - bigger kickback and a slower
04:34 - rate of fire right you can't shoot it as
04:37 - quickly it does more damage sprays out
04:40 - but you can't repeat fire it as fast the
04:44 - spread is going to be a lot larger
04:45 - because the bullets are going to
04:47 - fly out ahead of the gun and spread out
04:50 - so we want them to spread out and then
04:52 - each bullet itself is going to do a
04:55 - smaller amount of damage right but we're
04:58 - firing 12 of them so we're actually
05:00 - going to be doing six you know one shot
05:02 - can do 60 total damage in theory which
05:05 - is great when you're up close to a
05:07 - zombie you hit it with the full blast of
05:09 - the shotgun it'll do a lot if they're
05:10 - farther away from you they spread out
05:12 - maybe you'll hit a couple of them at the
05:13 - same time
05:14 - that's how we want our
05:17 - shotgun to work so we don't need these
05:19 - individual variables anymore so there we
05:22 - go so we have our Dictionary of settings
05:24 - for all of our different for two
05:26 - different weapons that we are going to
05:28 - be using to begin with now we also need
05:32 - to deal with the sounds
05:34 - and instead of having right this
05:37 - individual
05:39 - this individual sounds where our weapon
05:44 - sounds our weapon sounds is also going
05:48 - to be a dictionary and in this case what
05:52 - we're gonna do is for each type of
05:54 - weapon
05:56 - there's gonna be a list
06:00 - okay right now we're keeping that list
06:03 - just having one in it but if you
06:07 - remember when we first set up the pistol
06:09 - we were talking about having multiple
06:12 - sounds and then you randomly
06:15 - need the shotgun and then you randomly
06:19 - select from them and that lets your
06:21 - makes you're gonna have a little bit
06:22 - more variety and when we get to really
06:24 - polishing up we can do we can add some
06:27 - more things into this these lists
06:30 - okay so we have all our settings we have
06:33 - a sound assigned for each type of gun
06:35 - and we have a bunch of settings
06:39 - each kind of gun
06:41 - so now we just need to over in our load
06:45 - section make sure we're loading those
06:46 - sounds right so we don't get an error
06:48 - message
06:52 - okay so what we're gonna do here is
06:54 - we're gonna fill this in a little
06:57 - differently
06:59 - we're just gonna read through that
07:01 - dictionary we made in the settings so
07:04 - for each weapon and
07:06 - the weapon sounds
07:09 - list there
07:12 - then we're gonna take our dictionary and
07:15 - add an item for it
07:17 - we'll add a key for it and that's going
07:20 - to hold the list and then for each sound
07:23 - in
07:26 - weapons sounds for each sound in that
07:30 - dictionary for each one right because it
07:33 - could be a list we're going to load the
07:34 - sound
07:37 - sound
07:43 - and we're going to set the volume
07:48 - and we're going to add it
07:57 - dot append
07:59 - okay
08:01 - there we go so now we have all of our
08:06 - data created we have all of our sounds
08:09 - loaded for weapons and we're ready to
08:12 - start using them
08:14 - all right and the other thing OOP I just
08:17 - noticed there's an S on there okay so
08:20 - the other thing too is the image right
08:22 - so this bullet image we actually want
08:24 - two of them we want a large and a small
08:26 - so we're going to have bullet images
08:30 - also be a dictionary dictionaries are so
08:33 - useful and
08:37 - bullet images large will be this one
08:43 - that we have been using and
08:46 - bullet images small
08:51 - why did I put curly brackets there
08:56 - bullet images large and bullet images
08:59 - small small is just going to be the same
09:02 - image
09:04 - we're just gonna scale it down
09:08 - so we want bullet images large and we're
09:13 - going to scale it to
09:16 - ten by ten
09:19 - okay and that way we will have both
09:23 - sides
09:24 - bullets ready to go okay now if you run
09:28 - it you should be able to load but when
09:30 - you try and shoot you're gonna get an
09:31 - error message because we've changed
09:33 - around all the weapon data so we can't
09:36 - shoot yet so we need to go over here to
09:38 - our player and the one thing we need to
09:41 - add to the player when it starts is we
09:43 - need to
09:44 - add a variable here to hold what weapon
09:47 - he's carrying so we're gonna say he
09:50 - starts out with the pistol
09:52 - and that's the weapon you start with and
09:55 - now what we'll have to do is we're gonna
09:58 - have to redo our shoot code right right
10:02 - now when we press the spacebar we do all
10:05 - of this stuff but we're gonna have to do
10:07 - some different things for different
10:10 - weapons or and we're going to detect
10:12 - which weapon we have and all that kind
10:14 - of stuff so what we're going to do is
10:16 - we're gonna make a separate function for
10:18 - shooting okay so all pressing the
10:21 - spacebar is going to do is
10:26 - self touch shoot
10:29 - okay and then this stuff here is
10:35 - going to be
10:37 - what it does now we are going to change
10:40 - this around a bit let's undo that a
10:44 - little bit so we still need to match the
10:48 - weapon right but now instead of using
10:50 - this variable it's going to depend on
10:52 - which weapon we have
10:53 - so from our weapons dictionary we're
10:57 - gonna say whichever weapon we have and
10:59 - the key we want to look at is the rate
11:03 - alright so if we've
11:05 - that amount of time then we're gonna do
11:06 - it and
11:08 - the this will stay the same we have a
11:12 - barrel offset but we're keeping the same
11:14 - one we're not changing the players image
11:15 - for different weapons just yet but we
11:18 - can we can do that later
11:20 - but here we don't want to spawn we don't
11:24 - necessarily want to spawn just one
11:25 - bullet
11:26 - right and we also need to kick back so
11:30 - actually let's move the kick back
11:33 - line up here and the amount it kicks you
11:38 - back is going to be
11:40 - dependent on the weapon
11:45 - and we're going to use the
11:47 - whatever the kickback setting is and now
11:51 - because each bolt or each gun can shoot
11:54 - multiple bullets we need to do a little
11:57 - loop here and we're gonna count to
12:01 - whatever the
12:04 - weapon we're holding
12:07 - has in these count bullet count setting
12:13 - and we don't need
12:16 - just don't need these options
12:19 - autocomplete alright so now we're
12:23 - counting to how many there are okay and
12:27 - the spread is going to be different as
12:29 - well right now in the in our bullet when
12:33 - we
12:34 - spawn the bullet figuring out the spread
12:37 - but our problem is different weapons are
12:41 - going to have different spreads so we're
12:42 - gonna calculate the spread before we
12:44 - spawn the bullet
12:47 - and that's going to be just a uniform
12:50 - between
12:57 - whatever weapon we have and it's spread
13:03 - value and we're gonna just copy and
13:06 - paste that here because we want it to be
13:08 - positive or negative
13:10 - so now the bullet now we're going to
13:13 - spawn a bullet
13:17 - slope that game
13:20 - position
13:22 - that we calculated and instead of giving
13:25 - the direction here it's the direction
13:28 - rotated by whatever the spread we just
13:31 - calculated was okay
13:34 - we're gonna play a
13:40 - sound but it's gonna be from the game
13:43 - weapon sounds
13:46 - self dot weapon
13:49 - and then we're gonna spawn a muzzle
13:52 - flash just once we don't need to spawn a
13:54 - muzzle flash for each bullet because
13:57 - when we spawn the twelve bullets for the
13:58 - shotgun that's not going to be good
14:00 - okay so now we've added that when we
14:05 - spawn the bullet we're passing the
14:08 - direction now and we don't need to add
14:09 - the spread so on the bullet down below
14:12 - when we spawn the bullet what we're
14:14 - gonna do is
14:16 - go down to our bullet here
14:19 - we don't need
14:21 - that
14:24 - we don't need let's see the velocity was
14:28 - dirt we're not going to rotate it
14:30 - because we already did rotate it
14:32 - so it's just that and then we also are
14:35 - the bullet speed could be different
14:39 - so we've got to look at
14:44 - whatever weapon the player is holding
14:48 - and look at its
14:51 - bullet speed
14:52 - setting
14:55 - alright and I think oh
14:59 - one other thing the image here so here
15:02 - we've got to use bullet images
15:05 - whichever
15:11 - weapon
15:16 - whichever weapon we have bullet size
15:22 - okay let's give this a shot so we're
15:27 - going to run it up
15:30 - and we forgot over here one other thing
15:34 - is the bullet we have to know when to
15:36 - delete the bullet so we have to check
15:38 - the whoop the bullet lifetime
15:46 - whatever weapon the
15:50 - players holding
15:54 - at lifetime
15:57 - there we go
16:00 - alright
16:02 - and now when we hit the mobs they need
16:06 - to subtract however much the damage the
16:10 - particular bullet does all right so
16:13 - that's in our update over here
16:16 - bullet damage so we have to subtract
16:21 - from whatever weapons of the player
16:24 - whatever weapon the players holding
16:29 - damage
16:33 - there we go all right
16:38 - okay
16:41 - okay so the pistol is working again just
16:46 - like it was before
16:49 - there's a little sound issue happening
16:52 - but I'm going to talk about how to fix
16:54 - that in a minute because first what we
16:57 - want to do is let's just go and see if
17:00 - we go up here to the player again what
17:03 - happens if we have
17:07 - them holding a
17:09 - shotgun instead
17:14 - there we go nice okay so you see the
17:17 - spread of bullets come flying out
17:21 - but notice I'm not doing very much
17:23 - damage right and that's because
17:26 - we're only taking away one bullets worth
17:29 - of damage because in the collision code
17:34 - when we
17:35 - when we had the bullet hit the mob we
17:39 - were only checking
17:41 - if it got hit
17:47 - right so let's see bullet mobs no that's
17:52 - right oh
17:54 - right so when we're doing a
18:00 - group collide here
18:02 - so this hits list then it gives you back
18:06 - is actually not a list it's actually a
18:07 - dictionary and it shows for each mob
18:10 - that got hit a list of the bullets that
18:13 - hit it so we're going through each mob
18:16 - that gets hit and only subtracting once
18:18 - for each mob that got hit but if that
18:20 - mob got hit by more than one bullet we
18:23 - have to multiply this by the length of
18:29 - that mobs
18:31 - list of bullets that hit it
18:35 - right so I'll go through it again it
18:37 - might be a little bit confusing so hits
18:38 - is going to be a dictionary each key of
18:42 - the dictionary will be a
18:44 - mob that got hit
18:47 - right and each piece of data in the
18:50 - dictionary for each key is a list of the
18:53 - bullets that hit that mom so mob number
18:56 - one you know I mean we shoot the shotgun
18:59 - we might hit multiple mobs right and the
19:00 - first mob might get hit with two bullets
19:02 - the second mob gets hit with four
19:04 - bullets right so each so this list is
19:07 - going to go through each mob so each key
19:10 - in the dictionary
19:11 - so for each mob that got hit we need to
19:15 - subtract its health
19:17 - by the damage of each bullet times the
19:21 - number of bullets that hit it so how
19:23 - long that list of bullets that hit it
19:25 - was okay that way it'll take away the
19:28 - right amount of damage for each okay so
19:31 - if I shoot this guy up close with the
19:33 - shotgun yeah see his health went right
19:34 - down and two shots I can get rid of him
19:41 - okay and
19:45 - that's good
19:47 - and the last thing I want to deal with
19:50 - is this little sound issue so if we run
19:53 - this
19:54 - see if I can
19:56 - demonstrate here I'm gonna hold down the
19:59 - spacebar to shoot the shot gun
20:02 - repeatedly okay
20:05 - all right you see how it's not it's not
20:08 - playing every time I shoot and part of
20:11 - that is because the previous you know
20:14 - the previous sound hasn't finished
20:16 - playing you might be able to see this
20:19 - with the pistol as well let's go back to
20:21 - the pistol for a second
20:28 - see how I'm not shooting
20:32 - it's nothing the sound every time it's a
20:34 - little bit erratic okay and that just
20:37 - has to do with you're trying to play a
20:39 - sound and you haven't finished playing
20:41 - that sound and you've already started
20:42 - telling the computer to play another one
20:44 - and it starts to
20:47 - and it starts to be a problem you also
20:50 - might have been noticing this may or may
20:53 - not be happening to you
20:55 - a little bit of lag between the sounds
20:57 - you know when the code says to play the
20:59 - sound and when it actually happens and
21:01 - usually that has to do with
21:03 - the way that PI game buffers sound
21:08 - before it plays it right it tries to
21:10 - make sure it can load the whole sound
21:12 - before it plays it but sometimes that
21:14 - takes too long and so if you if you
21:18 - google this online you'll see there's a
21:19 - lot of
21:21 - tricks that you can do to improve it and
21:25 - one of those is before the PI game in it
21:29 - there is a pre init setting that you can
21:32 - do on the mixer to
21:35 - customize the sound settings and these
21:40 - are the defaults except for this last
21:42 - one which is the buffer size if we make
21:45 - the buffer a bit bigger than the default
21:48 - we can get a better
21:50 - we can get less lag whenever we want to
21:53 - play the sound because the sound will
21:54 - already be in memory and it can just
21:56 - fire it off okay so the other thing we
21:59 - want to do is we want to make sure we're
22:01 - not playing if we're shooting really
22:02 - fast we don't need to we don't want to
22:07 - drop the sounds that we play it right so
22:09 - you're in the shoot before we play the
22:11 - sound okay I'm gonna choose the sound
22:17 - before I play it okay I'm going to
22:19 - choose whichever sound I want to play
22:21 - and if that sound
22:26 - right we can see how many times how many
22:28 - channels is that sound playing on right
22:30 - now and it's already playing on more
22:33 - than two channels
22:34 - then we're gonna stop
22:37 - one of them then we'll play the sound
22:40 - and what that'll do is let it not have
22:42 - too many overlapping
22:44 - copies of the sound playing let's see if
22:47 - you can hear the difference with this
22:53 - it's much more consistent
22:57 - let's go back to the shotgun here
23:01 - we'll go back to the shotgun on the
23:04 - player and
23:13 - see
23:18 - much better and the splat when the
23:20 - zombie dies we'll be yeah see that so
23:24 - between those two things between
23:25 - limiting the number of multiple copies
23:27 - of the sound you play at once and by
23:30 - tweaking that buffer setting which you
23:34 - may need to tweak a little bit more
23:35 - yourself it depends on your particular
23:38 - system you might be able to get get away
23:41 - with 1024 it has to be powers of two by
23:43 - the way
23:44 - and I'll put a little link below you can
23:47 - go look at the documentation for it on
23:49 - the poem documentation if you're curious
23:52 - more about what that means
23:54 - but I think that'll do it for this video
23:56 - we've gone
23:58 - pretty long already
24:00 - but now we've done a lot of work we've
24:02 - got two different kinds of weapons now
24:06 - in the next video we can start getting a
24:10 - way to pick them up because you probably
24:11 - want to start you know the player with
24:13 - the pistol and the shotgun is gonna be
24:14 - one we can find somewhere and maybe you
24:17 - have a way to switch in between them
24:20 - that will have to come a little bit
24:23 - later when we add another item on the
24:26 - map like we did with the health pack
24:29 - right another one of these items we can
24:32 - make a shotgun pickup and I'll let you
24:35 - switch to the to the shotgun item okay
24:39 - as always thanks for watching I hope
24:41 - that this all made sense to you and
24:44 - you're starting to get a good handle on
24:46 - some of the usefulness of Python
24:49 - dictionaries
24:51 - they're really useful you can see by
24:54 - said all this up especially like when we
24:56 - did the the shoot code right we didn't
24:59 - have to have a whole bunch of ifs here
25:00 - saying if they're using the gun use this
25:03 - if they're using the shotgun use this
25:04 - it's all just
25:05 - loading whatever settings each
25:08 - particular weapon has okay I know
25:10 - that'll be really useful we add three
25:13 - more weapons you know three different
25:15 - kinds and this code won't even change a
25:17 - little bit right it'll all be ready to
25:19 - go already and we can just drop in more
25:21 - weapons whenever we want to all right
25:24 - thanks for watching I hope you enjoyed
25:26 - the video please hit the like button
25:27 - below and subscribe if you haven't
25:29 - already and I will see you next time bye
25:40 - you

Cleaned transcript:

all right welcome back to a game development with PI game this is part 20 of our tilebased topdown zombie shooter and first of all if you have been following along I want to thank you for sticking with it this long the games really starting to shape up and one popular feature that's been requested that I decided it was time to start talking about was adding more weapons into the game so this time around we're gonna take our little pistol that the player has right now and we're gonna also add a shotgun very popular zombie fighting weapon alright so let's get started okay so in the settings right now we have all this information about how we want our gun to work but if we're gonna have multiple weapons we're gonna have one of different settings for each weapon alright the fire rate might be different for one gun versus another you know big gun will have a bigger kickback that kind of thing so we're gonna need a way to organize all this stuff so that we don't have you know so we have it easy to change and it's and it's organized and it's logically laid out so we're gonna with if we have the concept of having multiple weapons then we should just group all the data for those weapons together right so this is going to become our weapon settings category of our settings file for now I'm going to use the same image for all of the bullets we will talk about changing that later so what we're gonna do is we're gonna make a dictionary called weapons that's going to hold each of the different kinds of weapon okay so to start with well so so we have the pistol right that's the one that we currently are using okay and this is just going to have all the data of that okay so let's see we want to have so each of these keys in the dictionary is going to be one of the settings for the bullet right so let's feed is 500 let's get this over here the bullet lifetime is a thousand I'm gonna keep the settings the same on the gun oops capitalize that bullet let's just call this rate this is the rate of fire of the gun the rate is actually gonna make that slightly bigger I think our gun was shooting too fast as it was and this is gonna be the pistol it's a small start a starting weapon so the kickback we've got the spread which we were using five we've got the damage very important how much damage it does and then I'm also going to have a bullet size here and for now I'm just gonna deal with having large and small large will be the size we're using right now the shotgun we're gonna want to have spray out a bunch of tiny little bullets so tiny pellets so we're gonna use a small size image for those but there we go what else do we need oh I know and one other thing is the bullet count so this is how many bullets does this gun fire right the shotgun is gonna spray out a bunch of small pellets so that number will be bigger but this is this is what the pistol will look like okay and so now I can just duplicate this whole thing I'm just going to duplicate this to make the shotgun okay and so let's see we need to what we need to do oh we have an extra space here so all we're going to do for the shotgun has just changed the values for these okay the shotgun bullets I think you're gonna travel a little bit slower they're going to last less time right it's not as a longrange a weapon the bullet count though is going to be a lot bunch of these little bullets are going to spray out gonna be small the shotgun is gonna have a little bit bigger kickback and a slower rate of fire right you can't shoot it as quickly it does more damage sprays out but you can't repeat fire it as fast the spread is going to be a lot larger because the bullets are going to fly out ahead of the gun and spread out so we want them to spread out and then each bullet itself is going to do a smaller amount of damage right but we're firing 12 of them so we're actually going to be doing six you know one shot can do 60 total damage in theory which is great when you're up close to a zombie you hit it with the full blast of the shotgun it'll do a lot if they're farther away from you they spread out maybe you'll hit a couple of them at the same time that's how we want our shotgun to work so we don't need these individual variables anymore so there we go so we have our Dictionary of settings for all of our different for two different weapons that we are going to be using to begin with now we also need to deal with the sounds and instead of having right this individual this individual sounds where our weapon sounds our weapon sounds is also going to be a dictionary and in this case what we're gonna do is for each type of weapon there's gonna be a list okay right now we're keeping that list just having one in it but if you remember when we first set up the pistol we were talking about having multiple sounds and then you randomly need the shotgun and then you randomly select from them and that lets your makes you're gonna have a little bit more variety and when we get to really polishing up we can do we can add some more things into this these lists okay so we have all our settings we have a sound assigned for each type of gun and we have a bunch of settings each kind of gun so now we just need to over in our load section make sure we're loading those sounds right so we don't get an error message okay so what we're gonna do here is we're gonna fill this in a little differently we're just gonna read through that dictionary we made in the settings so for each weapon and the weapon sounds list there then we're gonna take our dictionary and add an item for it we'll add a key for it and that's going to hold the list and then for each sound in weapons sounds for each sound in that dictionary for each one right because it could be a list we're going to load the sound sound and we're going to set the volume and we're going to add it dot append okay there we go so now we have all of our data created we have all of our sounds loaded for weapons and we're ready to start using them all right and the other thing OOP I just noticed there's an S on there okay so the other thing too is the image right so this bullet image we actually want two of them we want a large and a small so we're going to have bullet images also be a dictionary dictionaries are so useful and bullet images large will be this one that we have been using and bullet images small why did I put curly brackets there bullet images large and bullet images small small is just going to be the same image we're just gonna scale it down so we want bullet images large and we're going to scale it to ten by ten okay and that way we will have both sides bullets ready to go okay now if you run it you should be able to load but when you try and shoot you're gonna get an error message because we've changed around all the weapon data so we can't shoot yet so we need to go over here to our player and the one thing we need to add to the player when it starts is we need to add a variable here to hold what weapon he's carrying so we're gonna say he starts out with the pistol and that's the weapon you start with and now what we'll have to do is we're gonna have to redo our shoot code right right now when we press the spacebar we do all of this stuff but we're gonna have to do some different things for different weapons or and we're going to detect which weapon we have and all that kind of stuff so what we're going to do is we're gonna make a separate function for shooting okay so all pressing the spacebar is going to do is self touch shoot okay and then this stuff here is going to be what it does now we are going to change this around a bit let's undo that a little bit so we still need to match the weapon right but now instead of using this variable it's going to depend on which weapon we have so from our weapons dictionary we're gonna say whichever weapon we have and the key we want to look at is the rate alright so if we've that amount of time then we're gonna do it and the this will stay the same we have a barrel offset but we're keeping the same one we're not changing the players image for different weapons just yet but we can we can do that later but here we don't want to spawn we don't necessarily want to spawn just one bullet right and we also need to kick back so actually let's move the kick back line up here and the amount it kicks you back is going to be dependent on the weapon and we're going to use the whatever the kickback setting is and now because each bolt or each gun can shoot multiple bullets we need to do a little loop here and we're gonna count to whatever the weapon we're holding has in these count bullet count setting and we don't need just don't need these options autocomplete alright so now we're counting to how many there are okay and the spread is going to be different as well right now in the in our bullet when we spawn the bullet figuring out the spread but our problem is different weapons are going to have different spreads so we're gonna calculate the spread before we spawn the bullet and that's going to be just a uniform between whatever weapon we have and it's spread value and we're gonna just copy and paste that here because we want it to be positive or negative so now the bullet now we're going to spawn a bullet slope that game position that we calculated and instead of giving the direction here it's the direction rotated by whatever the spread we just calculated was okay we're gonna play a sound but it's gonna be from the game weapon sounds self dot weapon and then we're gonna spawn a muzzle flash just once we don't need to spawn a muzzle flash for each bullet because when we spawn the twelve bullets for the shotgun that's not going to be good okay so now we've added that when we spawn the bullet we're passing the direction now and we don't need to add the spread so on the bullet down below when we spawn the bullet what we're gonna do is go down to our bullet here we don't need that we don't need let's see the velocity was dirt we're not going to rotate it because we already did rotate it so it's just that and then we also are the bullet speed could be different so we've got to look at whatever weapon the player is holding and look at its bullet speed setting alright and I think oh one other thing the image here so here we've got to use bullet images whichever weapon whichever weapon we have bullet size okay let's give this a shot so we're going to run it up and we forgot over here one other thing is the bullet we have to know when to delete the bullet so we have to check the whoop the bullet lifetime whatever weapon the players holding at lifetime there we go alright and now when we hit the mobs they need to subtract however much the damage the particular bullet does all right so that's in our update over here bullet damage so we have to subtract from whatever weapons of the player whatever weapon the players holding damage there we go all right okay okay so the pistol is working again just like it was before there's a little sound issue happening but I'm going to talk about how to fix that in a minute because first what we want to do is let's just go and see if we go up here to the player again what happens if we have them holding a shotgun instead there we go nice okay so you see the spread of bullets come flying out but notice I'm not doing very much damage right and that's because we're only taking away one bullets worth of damage because in the collision code when we when we had the bullet hit the mob we were only checking if it got hit right so let's see bullet mobs no that's right oh right so when we're doing a group collide here so this hits list then it gives you back is actually not a list it's actually a dictionary and it shows for each mob that got hit a list of the bullets that hit it so we're going through each mob that gets hit and only subtracting once for each mob that got hit but if that mob got hit by more than one bullet we have to multiply this by the length of that mobs list of bullets that hit it right so I'll go through it again it might be a little bit confusing so hits is going to be a dictionary each key of the dictionary will be a mob that got hit right and each piece of data in the dictionary for each key is a list of the bullets that hit that mom so mob number one you know I mean we shoot the shotgun we might hit multiple mobs right and the first mob might get hit with two bullets the second mob gets hit with four bullets right so each so this list is going to go through each mob so each key in the dictionary so for each mob that got hit we need to subtract its health by the damage of each bullet times the number of bullets that hit it so how long that list of bullets that hit it was okay that way it'll take away the right amount of damage for each okay so if I shoot this guy up close with the shotgun yeah see his health went right down and two shots I can get rid of him okay and that's good and the last thing I want to deal with is this little sound issue so if we run this see if I can demonstrate here I'm gonna hold down the spacebar to shoot the shot gun repeatedly okay all right you see how it's not it's not playing every time I shoot and part of that is because the previous you know the previous sound hasn't finished playing you might be able to see this with the pistol as well let's go back to the pistol for a second see how I'm not shooting it's nothing the sound every time it's a little bit erratic okay and that just has to do with you're trying to play a sound and you haven't finished playing that sound and you've already started telling the computer to play another one and it starts to and it starts to be a problem you also might have been noticing this may or may not be happening to you a little bit of lag between the sounds you know when the code says to play the sound and when it actually happens and usually that has to do with the way that PI game buffers sound before it plays it right it tries to make sure it can load the whole sound before it plays it but sometimes that takes too long and so if you if you google this online you'll see there's a lot of tricks that you can do to improve it and one of those is before the PI game in it there is a pre init setting that you can do on the mixer to customize the sound settings and these are the defaults except for this last one which is the buffer size if we make the buffer a bit bigger than the default we can get a better we can get less lag whenever we want to play the sound because the sound will already be in memory and it can just fire it off okay so the other thing we want to do is we want to make sure we're not playing if we're shooting really fast we don't need to we don't want to drop the sounds that we play it right so you're in the shoot before we play the sound okay I'm gonna choose the sound before I play it okay I'm going to choose whichever sound I want to play and if that sound right we can see how many times how many channels is that sound playing on right now and it's already playing on more than two channels then we're gonna stop one of them then we'll play the sound and what that'll do is let it not have too many overlapping copies of the sound playing let's see if you can hear the difference with this it's much more consistent let's go back to the shotgun here we'll go back to the shotgun on the player and see much better and the splat when the zombie dies we'll be yeah see that so between those two things between limiting the number of multiple copies of the sound you play at once and by tweaking that buffer setting which you may need to tweak a little bit more yourself it depends on your particular system you might be able to get get away with 1024 it has to be powers of two by the way and I'll put a little link below you can go look at the documentation for it on the poem documentation if you're curious more about what that means but I think that'll do it for this video we've gone pretty long already but now we've done a lot of work we've got two different kinds of weapons now in the next video we can start getting a way to pick them up because you probably want to start you know the player with the pistol and the shotgun is gonna be one we can find somewhere and maybe you have a way to switch in between them that will have to come a little bit later when we add another item on the map like we did with the health pack right another one of these items we can make a shotgun pickup and I'll let you switch to the to the shotgun item okay as always thanks for watching I hope that this all made sense to you and you're starting to get a good handle on some of the usefulness of Python dictionaries they're really useful you can see by said all this up especially like when we did the the shoot code right we didn't have to have a whole bunch of ifs here saying if they're using the gun use this if they're using the shotgun use this it's all just loading whatever settings each particular weapon has okay I know that'll be really useful we add three more weapons you know three different kinds and this code won't even change a little bit right it'll all be ready to go already and we can just drop in more weapons whenever we want to all right thanks for watching I hope
