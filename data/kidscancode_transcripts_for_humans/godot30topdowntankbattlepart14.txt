00:00 - welcome back to the top-down tank battle
00:02 - Godot engine game series today we're
00:05 - gonna start working on some of the UI
00:07 - for our game starting with the title
00:09 - screen I'm gonna make a new scene here
00:12 - and I'm gonna start it with a control
00:14 - node this is going to be my title screen
00:19 - root node I'm gonna save this in my UI
00:23 - folder and now we need to just set up
00:29 - our layout for our title screen I'm
00:31 - gonna make this full rect so the control
00:35 - node fills the whole screen and then I'm
00:40 - gonna start simple just with a couple of
00:43 - label nodes so let's put in a label this
00:49 - will be the title this is gonna contain
00:54 - the title which again keeping it simple
00:57 - I'm just gonna call this tank battle for
00:58 - now and I want to set the font on this
01:04 - now here's a quick tip to if you set the
01:06 - layout first like say you wanted it to
01:08 - be I don't know
01:10 - aligned on the right right and then you
01:13 - change the font you're gonna find that
01:16 - alignment doesn't work and I'll have to
01:17 - do the alignment again so go ahead and
01:19 - make sure you do the font first so I'm
01:22 - gonna load my font here from my assets
01:26 - folder and I'm gonna set the font size
01:33 - to let's see maybe 6 that's pretty good
01:43 - we'll stick with that for now now where
01:45 - do I want this to be I want this to be
01:47 - centered so I can do like that right set
01:52 - the text to be aligned Center and then I
01:57 - think I want it go on it up a bit so I'm
02:01 - just gonna hit the up arrow shift up
02:04 - arrow a couple times to jump it up a
02:06 - little bit so I want it slightly above
02:08 - center and then the second
02:13 - one here is going to be the call this
02:17 - play message this is the gonna be the
02:19 - one that says press space to play okay
02:26 - now this one I want the font to be a
02:29 - little smaller now since I duplicated
02:31 - they're sharing the same dynamic font so
02:34 - it's a good idea to click make unique
02:36 - here so that when I go in here and
02:38 - change the font size on this one to make
02:41 - it smaller it's not going to be the same
02:43 - so let's set this one to bottom wide and
02:46 - then do the same thing we'll bring it up
02:48 - a little bit and put it about there
02:53 - actually maybe even a slightly smaller
02:57 - font yeah okay so there's my simple
03:07 - starter layout for the text on the
03:11 - screen now I want some kind of
03:13 - background and since we already have our
03:15 - tile map set up I'm just gonna use the
03:18 - tile map and the tile set that we've
03:20 - already made to be my background that
03:24 - above the title and the play message so
03:27 - that it won't cover them up and then we
03:30 - need to load our tile set which is in
03:35 - our terrain section set the cell size to
03:41 - the right size and now I could you know
03:45 - fill this in now the only thing about
03:49 - this is I think for the title screen
03:53 - this is gonna be a little bit on the
03:56 - large side like what like when we have
03:59 - roads in there like for example so I was
04:02 - thinking maybe I will zoom this out a
04:04 - little bit or shrink it so I'm going to
04:06 - hit transform scale on the tile map and
04:12 - I'm going to set it to half the size
04:17 - yeah there we go and now we can just
04:22 - draw out the map we want fill this in
04:34 - okay and then draw maybe some roads
04:37 - going around and I'll skip over that
04:40 - part real quick okay so I just drew some
04:43 - quick roads winding around through here
04:46 - around the labels and I'm thinking that
04:52 - the brightness of this of these
04:55 - background todd's is a little too high
04:56 - for the contrast with the orea kind of
05:00 - washes out the text so I'm gonna take
05:02 - the tile map and I'm gonna put its
05:05 - modulate I'm gonna put its modulate I'm
05:10 - gonna put it to modulate down a little
05:11 - bit say round there yeah just make it a
05:19 - little darker and then on the these two
05:23 - labels I'm going to set some shadow
05:27 - offset let's see let's try five and five
05:34 - and then under the color is the font
05:36 - color shadow there we go and it might be
05:39 - a little too much yeah I just want a
05:45 - little bit of drop shadow underneath
05:47 - there to make the letters pop let's hit
05:50 - play here okay so that's what our that's
05:55 - what our title screen is gonna look like
05:57 - and now I'm going to add an animation
06:00 - player here so that I can animate these
06:05 - labels to make them pop a little bit
06:08 - more give a little bit of animation when
06:11 - we start the title screen let's make a
06:15 - new animation or they'll call it start
06:18 - I'm gonna set it to auto play and then
06:22 - I'm going to animate two things first
06:24 - I'm going to take the title and I'm
06:27 - gonna go to it's wrecked position and
06:29 - I'm gonna keyframe that
06:31 - that's actually where I wanted to end so
06:33 - I'm going to put that out over say here
06:37 - around the halfway point maybe a little
06:41 - closer not quite sure how fast I want
06:45 - this to be yet and then I'm also and
06:48 - then I'm just going to move it up again
06:50 - using the shift up arrow just move it
06:52 - straight up that's where I want it to
06:54 - start let's just keyframe that and so
06:56 - now the animation will drop that in and
07:00 - then the other thing that I want to
07:02 - animate is this press space to play I
07:05 - don't want that to appear yet at the
07:06 - beginning so the play message visibility
07:09 - is gonna be off keyframe that so it's
07:13 - going to start off we're gonna wait
07:15 - until after we have dropped in the title
07:22 - and we're gonna keep frame it again it's
07:24 - still off and then I'm going to step one
07:27 - more time and turn it on and then that
07:32 - way we get we hit play drops in and then
07:37 - press space to play appears and actually
07:43 - I think maybe we'll space this out a
07:49 - little bit more make it a little bit
07:53 - slower yeah I actually want to move this
08:04 - maybe there yeah perfect okay that's
08:10 - what I want
08:10 - okay now skipping ahead a little bit in
08:12 - time I've added a path to D and I drew a
08:16 - convoluted path kind of drives around
08:18 - through the roads goes off the screen
08:20 - and then comes on again because what I
08:23 - can do now is I can attach a path follow
08:26 - and an instance of the enemy tank and
08:33 - because the enemy tank which we need to
08:35 - scale down as well because remember we
08:37 - scaled the top down so
08:42 - but the enemy tank will automatically
08:44 - follow this path so now when we play our
08:46 - title screen the enemy tank is going to
08:51 - drive along this road and we can
08:56 - actually add we could add multiple tanks
08:58 - we could do a lot of different things
09:00 - but that gives us a little activity
09:03 - happening while we're watching our while
09:06 - we're looking at our title screen then
09:14 - just throw a few obstacles in there and
09:16 - we have a nice-looking starter title
09:21 - screen for us to work from again this
09:24 - will change over time
09:26 - it will add some more effects to it and
09:27 - in the next video we'll talk about how
09:29 - to do the transitions to and from the
09:31 - title screen to playing the game thanks
09:35 - for watching I'll see you in the next
09:36 - video
09:44 - you
