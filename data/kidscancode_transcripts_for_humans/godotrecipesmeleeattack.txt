00:00 - here's your problem you have an animated
00:01 - character and you want to make a melee
00:03 - attacks which is swinging a sword or
00:05 - punching and this could be in 2d or 3d
00:08 - our solution here will be in 2d but the
00:11 - process will be the same for 3d here's
00:14 - how to make it work so we're starting
00:16 - here with a character who has an attack
00:18 - animation and whenever the sword goes
00:21 - out we want to detect that it hit
00:23 - something and we'll want to do that with
00:25 - an area 2d but we only want it to be
00:27 - active during the frame when the sword
00:30 - is swinging right there but not after so
00:34 - we're gonna do that with our animation
00:35 - player so we can make sure that that
00:37 - enabling and disabling of the area will
00:39 - match the frames of the animation and we
00:43 - can also do that with the second attack
00:44 - here which has a slightly different
00:45 - pattern so what we're going to do is as
00:50 - a child of the sprite I'm going to add
00:53 - an area 2d and I'm adding the area 2d as
00:56 - a child of sprite because when we move
00:57 - the sprite we're using the scale and
01:00 - setting it to negative 1 to reverse
01:04 - direction when we move to the left so
01:07 - this way our hitbox for our sword will
01:12 - flip also when we flip the character and
01:15 - so we're going to add a collision shape
01:18 - to this and we're going to use a
01:22 - rectangle and so this is the hitbox for
01:25 - our sword which is obviously going to
01:28 - need to be a bit smaller and we can
01:29 - advance the there we go we can advance
01:35 - the animation player until we see it
01:38 - where we want it to be right and so we
01:41 - can see it kind of starts coming out and
01:43 - maybe we'll pull this back here yeah and
01:47 - so that's the area something will need
01:51 - to be in for the sword to damage it and
01:54 - then over here on the very first frame
01:57 - we want to make this make sure that this
01:59 - collision shape is disabled and we'll
02:02 - keyframe that and then we'll advance to
02:05 - the attack frame and turn disabled back
02:10 - off and we'll keyframe it then we'll
02:13 - leave
02:13 - it active until we get to here and then
02:18 - we'll disable it again and so now when
02:20 - we play the animation you can see it get
02:23 - enabled while the sword is going forward
02:26 - now need to connect this up so I'm going
02:28 - to rename this area to D this sword hit
02:31 - and I'm going to connect its area
02:34 - entered signal and so this is going to
02:39 - go to our player script which already
02:41 - has the code to do its movement which
02:44 - I'm not going to go into you can see a
02:46 - another one of my tutorials for that but
02:49 - in our area entered all we want to do is
02:52 - see if the thing that the sword hit is a
02:55 - hurt box a Hurt box is an area that I
02:57 - can add to any object that will cause it
03:01 - to take damage and that should be all
03:03 - that we need to do to test out if this
03:07 - sword hit works and so here's a test
03:09 - scene I set up there's a barrel here
03:11 - that has a hurt box on it that's this
03:14 - rectangle right here and I've turned on
03:16 - visible collision shape so that we can
03:17 - see them so you can see when I hit my
03:20 - attack you can see that sword area
03:22 - becoming active so if I run over there
03:26 - to the barrel when I hit it it does
03:29 - damage and is destroyed now the other
03:33 - thing is that our two attacks are a
03:34 - little bit different right we've been
03:36 - working on attack - which does that area
03:38 - but on attack one attack one start slow
03:43 - and sweeps upwards so we can see here
03:46 - the area isn't totally covering the
03:49 - sword and on the upswing it's not
03:51 - covering up here on the sword either so
03:54 - the way we can fix that is let me switch
03:56 - back to attack to here and at the first
03:59 - frame on the collision shape we're going
04:03 - to keyframe its shape extents and so
04:10 - we'll create a keyframe for that and
04:13 - then that way on attack 1 we can resize
04:17 - that so we're gonna want it to go taller
04:20 - like this so that that whole area is
04:24 - caught in the sweeping attack
04:27 - and then so we can keyframe the extent
04:31 - for that as well
04:32 - and then do the same thing we did with
04:35 - the other one where we started out being
04:38 - disabled create a track for that and
04:41 - then when the upswing starts we'll
04:45 - enable it keep it enabled until the
04:48 - upswing finishes and then we'll disable
04:54 - it and then back to our test scene we
04:57 - can try this out with both attacks
04:59 - there's the one and then there's the
05:02 - other one this tutorial is part of my
