00:00 - hello this is part one of a new video on
00:04 - the goo game engine this is going to be
00:07 - a complete endtoend Game project I have
00:11 - no idea how many parts it's going to
00:12 - take yet we're going to be building it
00:14 - as we go I've given at the Super
00:17 - Creative name space rocks because I was
00:20 - such a big fan of asteroids when I was a
00:22 - kid love that game so we're going to
00:24 - make a updated version of that in the G
00:27 - game
00:28 - engine now if you're new to gdau or
00:31 - you're new to game development and
00:33 - coding in general this might not be the
00:36 - best place for you to start because well
00:39 - I'm going to be explaining some of the
00:40 - things I'm doing as far as they relate
00:42 - to the gdau engine I'm not necessarily
00:45 - going to explain every little thing so I
00:48 - if you want to I have a gdo 101 beginner
00:52 - series that might be a good place for
00:53 - you to start and then once you've got a
00:55 - little experience under your belt you
00:56 - can come back to this video and continue
00:59 - on on from
01:01 - there all right before we start making
01:03 - anything let's talk about the art we're
01:05 - going to use I've chosen this uh package
01:09 - from open game art it's by an artist
01:11 - named Kenny uh and it's a space shooter
01:14 - pack that has all sorts of useful images
01:17 - in it for meteors and spaceships and
01:22 - lasers and all sorts of fun stuff like
01:24 - that that we'll be able to use so if you
01:27 - go to open gameart you can download that
01:30 - from there when you do it's going to
01:34 - come with a bunch of folders uh an
01:38 - individual folder that's got all the the
01:40 - files in it but it also has a Sprite
01:43 - sheet and if you look here the Sprite
01:46 - sheet looks like this it's got all of
01:48 - the graphics packed in there very
01:51 - tightly in one big image and it also
01:54 - comes along with an XML file that
01:56 - describes where those images are in
02:00 - this Sprite sheet or Atlas which is
02:03 - another word for that so if you want
02:05 - this gray meteor you know it'll tell you
02:07 - the cordinates and the width and height
02:09 - of that
02:11 - image and to make it easy to read
02:16 - this to read all these Graphics in we're
02:19 - going to install a plug-in so if you go
02:22 - to the asset library right
02:25 - here I'm going to type in Atlas and and
02:30 - hit search and there is the Atlas
02:33 - importer all right if you click on that
02:36 - you can see this is designed to
02:39 - import atlases made with texture Packer
02:43 - uh a program named Atilla which I've
02:44 - never used before but it also knows how
02:47 - to read the Kenny assets XML which is
02:50 - going to make it really convenient for
02:51 - us so you click on install which really
02:54 - should be called download because it
02:57 - downloads the package here and then when
02:59 - you click install it's going to ask you
03:03 - where to put it so it's going to create
03:05 - an add-ons folder and that's fine uh I'm
03:08 - going to uncheck license and the readme
03:10 - I don't need those in my resource root
03:13 - folder and I'm going to hit
03:15 - install package installed
03:17 - successfully okay now to use this and or
03:21 - any other add-on that you install you
03:24 - also have to go to the project settings
03:26 - and you have to enable it here so
03:28 - there's the outlet import
03:30 - it's set to inactive so we're going to
03:32 - set it to
03:33 - active hit close and now if we click on
03:37 - the import menu we have a
03:39 - new Option here 2D Atlas yes it's
03:44 - misspelled send in a poll request to him
03:48 - uh import the 2D outlas from other tools
03:51 - you go here and you can choose Kenny
03:54 - spreadsheet from the
03:56 - options okay we need to choose where the
03:59 - meta file is which is the XML we're
04:01 - going to click on here we're going to
04:03 - browse to the folder where we downloaded
04:05 - the art pack and in the Sprite sheeet
04:07 - folder is the sheet. XML open that and
04:13 - there in the preview we can see all of
04:15 - the
04:16 - individual Sprite images ready to go
04:19 - very nice they have their these are the
04:21 - names that were assigned to them in the
04:25 - XML file that Kenny provided now we just
04:28 - need to pick the target texture
04:30 - file and I'm going to click on there and
04:32 - I'm going to hit create folder so I'm
04:35 - going to make an art folder just to put
04:39 - all of my stuff
04:41 - in uh we'll keep it named sheet. teex
04:45 - this is a texture file that good
04:49 - recognizes and we hit save and so now we
04:52 - have all of
04:53 - our settings the way we want them and
04:56 - we're going to hit
04:58 - import okay now if we look in the art
05:01 - folder now you're going to see all of
05:04 - the textures in here and you see they're
05:06 - all aex files
05:09 - atex what that means is they are really
05:11 - just references what Kudo is doing is
05:14 - it's keeping them all in the large
05:17 - texture file but these are all
05:19 - individual references to where they are
05:23 - in the full sheet see there's the sheet
05:26 - texture so all the data is in there
05:29 - these are IND idual files that point
05:31 - into the pieces this of this that we're
05:33 - going to cut out so that we can just
05:34 - grab them and use them all right so
05:36 - let's start making our player spaceship
05:39 - that's going to be the first thing we're
05:42 - going to work on in the
05:44 - game all right there's a lot of ways we
05:46 - could set up our players scene uh what
05:49 - I'm going to do is for its root node I'm
05:52 - going to choose an area
05:55 - 2D and area 2D will let us do the
05:59 - Collision detection so we can tell when
06:01 - anything enters it so we can tell uh if
06:03 - a meteor runs into it a bullet hits it
06:06 - or if you go over a power up we don't
06:08 - need any of the fancier physics because
06:11 - we're not going to have the player um
06:14 - bounce off of things or push things I
06:16 - just want to tell when something has run
06:18 - into it so we're going to grab that
06:20 - that's going to be our player so I'm
06:22 - going to name that
06:24 - player let's save this so we're also
06:28 - going to make a scenes
06:31 - folder we're going to keep all of our
06:33 - scenes in there just starting to get
06:36 - little organized here grab this and get
06:39 - this in the middle for the moment and
06:41 - now under this to this area 3D let's add
06:44 - a
06:46 - Sprite okay and the texture we're going
06:48 - to use is one of these spaceships where
06:53 - are all the spaceships here we go this
06:56 - is the one I like so I'm going to grab
06:58 - this one and drop it on the texture and
07:02 - there is my ler
07:04 - ship all right let's zoom in on this so
07:07 - we can see it a little
07:09 - better and we're going to name
07:12 - this ship I like to give names to all of
07:14 - my nodes not leave them the default
07:17 - names and now to this area 2D we need to
07:20 - add a collision shape
07:23 - 2D and the shape we're going to make
07:25 - that is a circle
07:28 - shape call this the
07:32 - collision and now make sure that when
07:36 - you're using a collision shape you never
07:39 - never grab these handles and resize it
07:41 - that will be a problem we're going to
07:43 - grab this handle on the inside here to
07:45 - change it its extents and we're going to
07:47 - just make
07:50 - this fit over the
07:53 - spaceship okay and we can tweak this a
07:56 - little bit later as we as we get there I
07:59 - think maybe I want it a little bit lower
08:03 - so I'm going to take the Y maybe
08:06 - add a little bit
08:10 - maybe
08:12 - eight and let's call it five
08:16 - okay so there we go so now our cion
08:19 - shape is nice and centered now the
08:22 - problem what will happen is you're
08:24 - you're going along you're doing things
08:25 - and you grab this and you move it and oh
08:27 - you didn't want that right so what I
08:29 - usually like to do is on the root node
08:31 - of
08:32 - your object click this button right here
08:35 - what this button does is make sure
08:36 - children are not selectable so when you
08:39 - click that doesn't matter what node you
08:41 - have selected over here whatever you
08:44 - grab you're going to
08:45 - grab the root node and only that will
08:48 - move and since everything is attached to
08:50 - it everything stays
08:53 - connected
08:56 - okay all right let's hit play and just
08:59 - see what this looks
09:00 - like so there's what we're going to have
09:04 - with our ship
09:06 - now the size here is a little bit big I
09:10 - don't want it taking up this much of the
09:12 - screen I want to feel like I have more
09:13 - room to fly around so I'm going to go to
09:16 - the ship here and I think I'm going to
09:18 - shrink this down a little
09:20 - to 60% of the size which of course is
09:24 - going to mean my Collision shape is
09:26 - going to need to be a little bit smaller
09:31 - like
09:32 - that all right well there we go for that
09:35 - now let's add a script to this so we can
09:38 - start flying it around so we're going to
09:40 - add
09:42 - script this is fine the path I don't
09:44 - want it in the scenes folder I'm going
09:46 - to go here and I'm going to make a
09:49 - scripts folder player. GD is fine goes
09:52 - with the player
09:53 - scene it's going to inherit area 2D and
09:57 - create all right so so our controls for
09:59 - the ship are going to be left and right
10:01 - or A and D for rotation and then we're
10:04 - going to use up arrow and W to thrust so
10:07 - we need to set a couple of variables I'm
10:09 - going to
10:10 - make these exportable so we can edit
10:14 - them in the
10:15 - inspector so the rotation speed is going
10:18 - to be how fast the ship spins and we can
10:21 - do this in degrees or we can do this in
10:23 - radians I tend to prefer doing things in
10:26 - radians so I'm going to call this about
10:29 - 2.6 so not quite
10:33 - 180° and then our thrust That's How
10:36 - Strong the thrust of the engines is
10:39 - going to be we're going to set that to
10:42 - uh let's see let's try 500 and see how
10:45 - that
10:46 - goes and then we're going to have a
10:50 - Max let's export
10:53 - this a Max velocity that's going to be
10:56 - the maximum speed that the ship will
10:58 - travel so we don't go flying off and I'm
11:01 - also going
11:05 - to add some friction yes in space
11:09 - there's no friction but this isn't a
11:10 - realistic game this is an arcade style
11:13 - game so I do want the ship to Coast to a
11:15 - stop if we let go of the thrust
11:18 - button okay now these are export vars so
11:22 - that over here will be able to adjust
11:25 - them however we want as we're tweaking
11:27 - this and making it IM making it work
11:30 - right okay I'm going to do screen
11:33 - wrapping so when we hit the edges of the
11:34 - screen we're going to wrap around to the
11:36 - other side so we're going to need to
11:39 - know the screen size we're going to have
11:41 - a variable to track our position and
11:43 - we're going to have a variable to track
11:44 - our
11:45 - velocity both of these and our
11:49 - acceleration right our three values we
11:51 - need for
11:53 - the normal equations of
11:55 - motion and we're also going to track the
12:00 - rotation okay now these are all
12:03 - variables that we're going to adjust as
12:05 - we move
12:07 - around and what some people like to do
12:10 - is just to indicate that these are going
12:12 - to be what type these are going to
12:15 - be we just set these to Vector
12:23 - twos this is also going to be
12:26 - a vector two just so you get an idea of
12:30 - what those will be when you set them
12:32 - later and in the ready we're going to
12:35 - start filling these in so first of all
12:37 - the screen size the screen size we can
12:39 - get at
12:42 - runtime by using the get viewport
12:48 - size sorry get viewport
12:51 - wed dot
12:54 - size and then the position that I want
12:57 - my shift to start at is going to just be
13:01 - screen size over
13:03 - two and then we're going to
13:06 - set uh the position of the ship to that
13:10 - position okay so that should make us pop
13:13 - up at the center of the screen when we
13:15 - start there we go we're centered at the
13:18 - center of the screen where we want to
13:20 - start all right now I've gone ahead and
13:23 - in the project settings I've gone I've
13:25 - added to the input map the keys we want
13:28 - to use for left and right I'm using WD
13:33 - and the arrow keys left right and thrust
13:37 - and then I also added in here shoot
13:39 - we're going to use space or the left
13:41 - Mouse button we'll see how we like that
13:44 - when we get to the point where we're
13:45 - ready to start
13:46 - shooting so let's make this let's make
13:49 - this ship move so we need
13:52 - to use a set process to
13:56 - true and we're going to do the the
13:59 - process
14:00 - function and so in this one we're just
14:02 - going to check the inputs okay so first
14:05 - we're going to see um you need to do
14:08 - rotate left and rotate
14:10 - right so is action pressed we're going
14:13 - to look for player
14:16 - left and if they press player left then
14:19 - we're going to take our rotation and
14:21 - we're going to add our rot speed times
14:27 - Delta
14:29 - and then we need to do the same thing
14:33 - here
14:34 - for is action press player
14:42 - right player right we're going to
14:45 - just
14:48 - subtract so we've increased our rotation
14:51 - variable we've incremented it and now we
14:54 - just need to update the
14:56 - rotation so we need to set
14:59 - rotation
15:01 - to whatever rotation we
15:03 - did by the way you know all the angles
15:06 - are done in radians if you really want
15:07 - to do degrees there is a rot
15:11 - D function that that does do
15:14 - degrees uh it's up to you you are just
15:17 - sometimes going to have to do convert
15:19 - from degrees to radians and back and
15:21 - forth to get everything to uh to talk
15:23 - the same thing for example vectors
15:25 - vectors do everything in radians you
15:27 - can't choose degrees so you're going to
15:29 - have to change it somewhere but that's
15:32 - good enough for now let's check it out
15:33 - and make sure it works play the scene
15:36 - and I'm turning to the right I'm turning
15:38 - to the
15:39 - left W ASD are both
15:42 - working sorry A and D left and right
15:47 - perfect okay now for the thrust we're
15:50 - going
15:51 - to duplicate this one more time and
15:54 - we're going to use the
15:57 - thrust in put and what we want to change
16:02 - here is we want to change the
16:05 - acceleration okay acceleration is just
16:07 - going to be a vector
16:11 - two and we're going to have it be our
16:16 - thrust
16:18 - variable and we're going to rotate
16:22 - that to whatever direction we're
16:26 - pointing in right which is our rotation
16:28 - Vari
16:33 - okay so that's what the acceleration is
16:34 - if we have the arrow key down otherwise
16:38 - our acceleration is going to be zero so
16:40 - our acceleration we're going to make
16:41 - that to Vector
16:43 - 2 Z Z so we
16:47 - have thrust when we press it no thrust
16:51 - when we
16:52 - don't and now we're also going
16:56 - to so we're going to take our velocity
16:59 - and that's just going to
17:01 - be acceleration time
17:04 - Delta whatever our current velocity is
17:06 - we'll have the acceleration added to it
17:09 - and whatever our position is is just
17:11 - going to be velocity times
17:13 - Delta so now if we set pause to whatever
17:18 - position is let's see what we
17:22 - see now look at that I am going sideways
17:27 - right and the reason for that is that
17:31 - our ship started out pointing upwards
17:33 - because that's the orientation that the
17:35 - image was in but a zero rotation is
17:38 - pointing to the right so we need to
17:41 - account for that and shift our Rotation
17:44 - by 90 Dees or pi over two and that's
17:49 - going to have it now pointing the right
17:51 - way so now our
17:52 - thrust is out of the back of the ship
17:55 - and we go in whatever direction we're
17:56 - pointing so now it's let's just add in
17:59 - that friction so that we don't go to or
18:02 - we we will Coast to a stop when we let
18:04 - go and then we'll also add the cap the
18:07 - velocity at the maximum
18:10 - velocity so what we need to do here is
18:13 - when we've gotten our acceleration from
18:15 - our thrust we're going to adjust
18:18 - it by
18:21 - adding negative friction right it goes
18:24 - in the opposite friction points in the
18:25 - opposite direction and it scales by
18:27 - velocity the fast you're going the
18:29 - stronger the friction force is okay and
18:32 - that's going to make
18:34 - it Coast to a stop so I have let go of
18:36 - the key I'm coasting to a
18:42 - stop and that's pretty
18:45 - good all right I know we're running long
18:48 - but I want to do one more thing which is
18:50 - keep us from going around going off the
18:52 - screen and make us wrap around the sides
18:54 - so we're going to just check if our
18:57 - position
18:58 - X is greater
19:01 - than the screen screen size
19:08 - width then we're going to set it we're
19:11 - going to set our position X to
19:14 - Zero okay so we go off the right we go
19:18 - back in on the other side and then I'm
19:19 - just going to duplicate that for the
19:21 - other ones okay so there I've just
19:23 - duplicated these real quick and so what
19:27 - that's going to do is let
19:29 - us Zoom along and wrap around the
19:34 - screen all right and that'll do it for
19:37 - this time around in the next video we
19:41 - will add some weapons to our ship and
19:44 - make the shooting work and then it'll be
19:47 - time to start talking about the pesky
19:49 - asteroids that we've got to hunt down
19:51 - and
19:51 - Destroy thanks for watching and I hope
19:55 - you will like the video and subscribe so
19:57 - you can see the next
19:59 - installment and I'll see you next time

hello this is part one of a new video on the goo game engine this is going to be a complete endtoend Game project I have no idea how many parts it's going to take yet we're going to be building it as we go I've given at the Super Creative name space rocks because I was such a big fan of asteroids when I was a kid love that game so we're going to make a updated version of that in the G game engine now if you're new to gdau or you're new to game development and coding in general this might not be the best place for you to start because well I'm going to be explaining some of the things I'm doing as far as they relate to the gdau engine I'm not necessarily going to explain every little thing so I if you want to I have a gdo 101 beginner series that might be a good place for you to start and then once you've got a little experience under your belt you can come back to this video and continue on on from there all right before we start making anything let's talk about the art we're going to use I've chosen this uh package from open game art it's by an artist named Kenny uh and it's a space shooter pack that has all sorts of useful images in it for meteors and spaceships and lasers and all sorts of fun stuff like that that we'll be able to use so if you go to open gameart you can download that from there when you do it's going to come with a bunch of folders uh an individual folder that's got all the the files in it but it also has a Sprite sheet and if you look here the Sprite sheet looks like this it's got all of the graphics packed in there very tightly in one big image and it also comes along with an XML file that describes where those images are in this Sprite sheet or Atlas which is another word for that so if you want this gray meteor you know it'll tell you the cordinates and the width and height of that image and to make it easy to read this to read all these Graphics in we're going to install a plugin so if you go to the asset library right here I'm going to type in Atlas and and hit search and there is the Atlas importer all right if you click on that you can see this is designed to import atlases made with texture Packer uh a program named Atilla which I've never used before but it also knows how to read the Kenny assets XML which is going to make it really convenient for us so you click on install which really should be called download because it downloads the package here and then when you click install it's going to ask you where to put it so it's going to create an addons folder and that's fine uh I'm going to uncheck license and the readme I don't need those in my resource root folder and I'm going to hit install package installed successfully okay now to use this and or any other addon that you install you also have to go to the project settings and you have to enable it here so there's the outlet import it's set to inactive so we're going to set it to active hit close and now if we click on the import menu we have a new Option here 2D Atlas yes it's misspelled send in a poll request to him uh import the 2D outlas from other tools you go here and you can choose Kenny spreadsheet from the options okay we need to choose where the meta file is which is the XML we're going to click on here we're going to browse to the folder where we downloaded the art pack and in the Sprite sheeet folder is the sheet. XML open that and there in the preview we can see all of the individual Sprite images ready to go very nice they have their these are the names that were assigned to them in the XML file that Kenny provided now we just need to pick the target texture file and I'm going to click on there and I'm going to hit create folder so I'm going to make an art folder just to put all of my stuff in uh we'll keep it named sheet. teex this is a texture file that good recognizes and we hit save and so now we have all of our settings the way we want them and we're going to hit import okay now if we look in the art folder now you're going to see all of the textures in here and you see they're all aex files atex what that means is they are really just references what Kudo is doing is it's keeping them all in the large texture file but these are all individual references to where they are in the full sheet see there's the sheet texture so all the data is in there these are IND idual files that point into the pieces this of this that we're going to cut out so that we can just grab them and use them all right so let's start making our player spaceship that's going to be the first thing we're going to work on in the game all right there's a lot of ways we could set up our players scene uh what I'm going to do is for its root node I'm going to choose an area 2D and area 2D will let us do the Collision detection so we can tell when anything enters it so we can tell uh if a meteor runs into it a bullet hits it or if you go over a power up we don't need any of the fancier physics because we're not going to have the player um bounce off of things or push things I just want to tell when something has run into it so we're going to grab that that's going to be our player so I'm going to name that player let's save this so we're also going to make a scenes folder we're going to keep all of our scenes in there just starting to get little organized here grab this and get this in the middle for the moment and now under this to this area 3D let's add a Sprite okay and the texture we're going to use is one of these spaceships where are all the spaceships here we go this is the one I like so I'm going to grab this one and drop it on the texture and there is my ler ship all right let's zoom in on this so we can see it a little better and we're going to name this ship I like to give names to all of my nodes not leave them the default names and now to this area 2D we need to add a collision shape 2D and the shape we're going to make that is a circle shape call this the collision and now make sure that when you're using a collision shape you never never grab these handles and resize it that will be a problem we're going to grab this handle on the inside here to change it its extents and we're going to just make this fit over the spaceship okay and we can tweak this a little bit later as we as we get there I think maybe I want it a little bit lower so I'm going to take the Y maybe add a little bit maybe eight and let's call it five okay so there we go so now our cion shape is nice and centered now the problem what will happen is you're you're going along you're doing things and you grab this and you move it and oh you didn't want that right so what I usually like to do is on the root node of your object click this button right here what this button does is make sure children are not selectable so when you click that doesn't matter what node you have selected over here whatever you grab you're going to grab the root node and only that will move and since everything is attached to it everything stays connected okay all right let's hit play and just see what this looks like so there's what we're going to have with our ship now the size here is a little bit big I don't want it taking up this much of the screen I want to feel like I have more room to fly around so I'm going to go to the ship here and I think I'm going to shrink this down a little to 60% of the size which of course is going to mean my Collision shape is going to need to be a little bit smaller like that all right well there we go for that now let's add a script to this so we can start flying it around so we're going to add script this is fine the path I don't want it in the scenes folder I'm going to go here and I'm going to make a scripts folder player. GD is fine goes with the player scene it's going to inherit area 2D and create all right so so our controls for the ship are going to be left and right or A and D for rotation and then we're going to use up arrow and W to thrust so we need to set a couple of variables I'm going to make these exportable so we can edit them in the inspector so the rotation speed is going to be how fast the ship spins and we can do this in degrees or we can do this in radians I tend to prefer doing things in radians so I'm going to call this about 2.6 so not quite 180° and then our thrust That's How Strong the thrust of the engines is going to be we're going to set that to uh let's see let's try 500 and see how that goes and then we're going to have a Max let's export this a Max velocity that's going to be the maximum speed that the ship will travel so we don't go flying off and I'm also going to add some friction yes in space there's no friction but this isn't a realistic game this is an arcade style game so I do want the ship to Coast to a stop if we let go of the thrust button okay now these are export vars so that over here will be able to adjust them however we want as we're tweaking this and making it IM making it work right okay I'm going to do screen wrapping so when we hit the edges of the screen we're going to wrap around to the other side so we're going to need to know the screen size we're going to have a variable to track our position and we're going to have a variable to track our velocity both of these and our acceleration right our three values we need for the normal equations of motion and we're also going to track the rotation okay now these are all variables that we're going to adjust as we move around and what some people like to do is just to indicate that these are going to be what type these are going to be we just set these to Vector twos this is also going to be a vector two just so you get an idea of what those will be when you set them later and in the ready we're going to start filling these in so first of all the screen size the screen size we can get at runtime by using the get viewport size sorry get viewport wed dot size and then the position that I want my shift to start at is going to just be screen size over two and then we're going to set uh the position of the ship to that position okay so that should make us pop up at the center of the screen when we start there we go we're centered at the center of the screen where we want to start all right now I've gone ahead and in the project settings I've gone I've added to the input map the keys we want to use for left and right I'm using WD and the arrow keys left right and thrust and then I also added in here shoot we're going to use space or the left Mouse button we'll see how we like that when we get to the point where we're ready to start shooting so let's make this let's make this ship move so we need to use a set process to true and we're going to do the the process function and so in this one we're just going to check the inputs okay so first we're going to see um you need to do rotate left and rotate right so is action pressed we're going to look for player left and if they press player left then we're going to take our rotation and we're going to add our rot speed times Delta and then we need to do the same thing here for is action press player right player right we're going to just subtract so we've increased our rotation variable we've incremented it and now we just need to update the rotation so we need to set rotation to whatever rotation we did by the way you know all the angles are done in radians if you really want to do degrees there is a rot D function that that does do degrees uh it's up to you you are just sometimes going to have to do convert from degrees to radians and back and forth to get everything to uh to talk the same thing for example vectors vectors do everything in radians you can't choose degrees so you're going to have to change it somewhere but that's good enough for now let's check it out and make sure it works play the scene and I'm turning to the right I'm turning to the left W ASD are both working sorry A and D left and right perfect okay now for the thrust we're going to duplicate this one more time and we're going to use the thrust in put and what we want to change here is we want to change the acceleration okay acceleration is just going to be a vector two and we're going to have it be our thrust variable and we're going to rotate that to whatever direction we're pointing in right which is our rotation Vari okay so that's what the acceleration is if we have the arrow key down otherwise our acceleration is going to be zero so our acceleration we're going to make that to Vector 2 Z Z so we have thrust when we press it no thrust when we don't and now we're also going to so we're going to take our velocity and that's just going to be acceleration time Delta whatever our current velocity is we'll have the acceleration added to it and whatever our position is is just going to be velocity times Delta so now if we set pause to whatever position is let's see what we see now look at that I am going sideways right and the reason for that is that our ship started out pointing upwards because that's the orientation that the image was in but a zero rotation is pointing to the right so we need to account for that and shift our Rotation by 90 Dees or pi over two and that's going to have it now pointing the right way so now our thrust is out of the back of the ship and we go in whatever direction we're pointing so now it's let's just add in that friction so that we don't go to or we we will Coast to a stop when we let go and then we'll also add the cap the velocity at the maximum velocity so what we need to do here is when we've gotten our acceleration from our thrust we're going to adjust it by adding negative friction right it goes in the opposite friction points in the opposite direction and it scales by velocity the fast you're going the stronger the friction force is okay and that's going to make it Coast to a stop so I have let go of the key I'm coasting to a stop and that's pretty good all right I know we're running long but I want to do one more thing which is keep us from going around going off the screen and make us wrap around the sides so we're going to just check if our position X is greater than the screen screen size width then we're going to set it we're going to set our position X to Zero okay so we go off the right we go back in on the other side and then I'm just going to duplicate that for the other ones okay so there I've just duplicated these real quick and so what that's going to do is let us Zoom along and wrap around the screen all right and that'll do it for this time around in the next video we will add some weapons to our ship and make the shooting work and then it'll be time to start talking about the pesky asteroids that we've got to hunt down and Destroy thanks for watching and I hope you will like the video and subscribe so you can see the next installment and I'll see you next time bye
