00:00 - welcome back this is part six of the
00:01 - circle jump Godot mobile game in this
00:04 - video we're gonna add sound to the game
00:07 - and also start working on the system for
00:09 - doing color schemes alright let's get
00:11 - started okay to start with this time
00:13 - around we're gonna add a new script that
00:16 - we're gonna use as an auto loads I'm
00:18 - gonna say new script here I'm going to
00:20 - call this settings this is where we're
00:24 - gonna put all of our settings code for
00:27 - things that we want to enable it startup
00:31 - things like that configuration so since
00:36 - we're gonna be adding some audio we want
00:38 - to be able to enable and disable sound
00:41 - and music and then we're gonna have some
00:50 - gameplay stuff like circles circles per
00:57 - level so you're gonna go up a level
00:58 - every five circles level is basically
01:01 - going to take care of the increasing
01:05 - difficulty so the higher level you get
01:07 - the more often you're gonna get limited
01:10 - circles or removing circles or things
01:11 - like that so let's add some sounds so
01:14 - over here in main we're gonna have an
01:16 - audio stream player I'm gonna call this
01:20 - one music and the asset for that one in
01:24 - the sounds folder I've got a bunch of
01:25 - sound clips in the assets folder for
01:28 - various things some of them we may not
01:30 - use I just grabbed a bunch of likely
01:33 - sounding ones to start with but we're
01:36 - gonna use this music drop that in the
01:38 - stream there and then on the menu
01:44 - screens we're gonna have a another one
01:48 - and this is gonna be a click sound
01:51 - that'll happen when we tap on buttons
01:53 - and the sound for that one is this menu
01:55 - click wave drop that in there it sounds
01:59 - like just a little click and then on the
02:03 - circle I want it to make a sound when
02:06 - the as when the limited timer ticks down
02:09 - right every time the we wrap around one
02:12 - orbit
02:13 - so it's just gonna make a beep sound and
02:15 - that's using this 89 number 89 I can I
02:20 - got these all from a sound pack so they
02:22 - have numbers on them and we're gonna
02:24 - come back we will come back and discard
02:25 - the ones we don't want later okay and
02:28 - then on the jumper I've got some sounds
02:31 - that I want for this one two actually
02:33 - two of them one is gonna be the jump
02:36 - sound when we press the jump button and
02:39 - one is going to be the capture sound
02:42 - okay and the capture sound is 88 that's
02:47 - this okay and the and believe number 70
02:54 - is the one we want for the jump yeah
03:02 - okay so we have those in there and then
03:06 - this in our settings here these are
03:09 - gonna determine whether the sounds
03:12 - should play or not so we need to put
03:14 - that in our project settings as on
03:16 - autoload which i've done right here
03:18 - already and then we can go into our code
03:24 - so in main when we have a new game we're
03:27 - gonna say if settings dot enable music
03:32 - music play and then we're actually going
03:36 - to do the same thing when the game ends
03:41 - we're going to stop the music
03:43 - and then we can go through our other
03:45 - ones and then when we press a button we
03:49 - just want to say if settings enable
03:54 - sound will play the click sound on our
03:59 - menu on our circle we're gonna play the
04:03 - beep when we tick down an orbit here I'm
04:11 - able to sound we will beep duck play
04:14 - and then grab that and over here on the
04:19 - jumper we're gonna play the jump sound
04:21 - here when we jump and then on the
04:30 - capture when we get captured here we'll
04:34 - play that capture sound so let's try
04:40 - that out and see if we hear our sounds
04:42 - so here in our menu we're hearing the
04:47 - click when we play we've got music we've
04:51 - got the beep ticking down we've got the
04:55 - jump sound ok now we need to connect up
04:59 - those buttons on the settings screen so
05:01 - we can turn on and off the sound so on
05:04 - our screens script we're going to need
05:07 - to change the button appearance because
05:10 - we in our assets folder we've got an
05:12 - appearance on the buttons audio on audio
05:17 - off and music on music off so we're
05:22 - going to want to alternate between those
05:24 - pictures so let's go ahead and load
05:25 - those into a pair of dictionaries so
05:32 - that I will have a link between the
05:36 - state which is true and the button which
05:40 - I can preload the image of easiest way
05:43 - to do that when it's true audio should
05:46 - be on so I'll drag that path in and then
05:53 - do the same for the other ones so I have
05:55 - my sound buttons on my music buttons
05:56 - defined for true and false loading the
05:59 - appropriate texture and then down here
06:04 - when we check our button we're gonna
06:07 - want to tell it to change so right now
06:08 - we're just passing the button name which
06:10 - would make me have to then go and search
06:12 - for the node with that name so I think
06:14 - when we connect up the buttons we're
06:18 - gonna pass the button itself
06:23 - which technically that means we don't
06:25 - have to pass the name right because we
06:27 - pass the button then we get a button and
06:32 - we will match button name and then we
06:39 - need our to button type so if we press
06:43 - the sound button then we want to toggle
06:46 - that so in the settings we're going to
06:51 - change enable sound to not enable sound
07:00 - which will turn it on and off and then
07:03 - we need to change the button so button
07:06 - dot texture normal is going to be equal
07:12 - to sound buttons and then the value of
07:17 - true or false and then we're going to do
07:20 - the same thing for music so I can
07:24 - probably copy and paste this and make
07:29 - this the music button there we go
07:34 - so let's try that out so now if I go
07:38 - into settings I should be able to toggle
07:42 - these things on and off see when I'm off
07:45 - I'm not getting any clicks so that's
07:48 - good alright let's turn off music and
07:51 - play yeah I've got sound effects now but
07:57 - no music so the other thing I'm gonna do
07:59 - is want to start setting up a way for us
08:00 - to do color schemes and so I've added
08:03 - here to the setting script a dictionary
08:06 - with a name for each color scheme and
08:09 - each color scheme is going to be a list
08:10 - of colors for what thing that they're
08:12 - gonna color and so we're gonna have a
08:14 - background color of the game window the
08:18 - players body the players trail and then
08:20 - for the circles Phil is that piyah color
08:24 - that fills in the center and then static
08:27 - circles can be a different color from
08:29 - limited circles so you have a visual
08:31 - distinction and so I've just put some
08:34 - different colors in here
08:36 - and then we'll have a variable that will
08:40 - track what theme we have selected and
08:43 - I'm not gonna worry too much about the
08:46 - UI for that yet let's just get it
08:51 - working first so let's start with we'll
08:54 - just people use that neon 1 1 to start
08:57 - with so now we can go to each object and
09:00 - set its color based on what the theme is
09:03 - set to so on the circle our problem is
09:07 - that the circles are all using the same
09:09 - material which means if we change the
09:11 - color on the material it's going to
09:15 - change on every circle at the same time
09:17 - so we need to make the material unique
09:19 - so we'll do that here we can say sprite
09:24 - material equals sprite material dot
09:30 - duplicate so now it has its own unique
09:33 - copy and then we also want to set the
09:36 - sprite effect to match make sure it uses
09:43 - the same material as the sprite does and
09:45 - then we can set its color and we're
09:48 - gonna set its color based on what mode
09:50 - it's set to so in mode static so let's
09:56 - make of our color here so we select the
09:59 - color based on what mode we're in so
10:02 - color will be settings dot theme and
10:08 - then what category we want which is
10:11 - circle static but if we're unlimited
10:19 - then we want it to pick circle limited
10:23 - and then in our material we can set a
10:31 - shader per am color to that variable and
10:37 - then we also want to use in our draw
10:42 - where we're filling in the circle arc
10:44 - and then down here this this color
10:47 - should be
10:50 - whatever the setting for circle fill is
10:55 - and then on the jumper we have a similar
11:00 - situation where we're going to set it in
11:02 - the ready
11:12 - and then we also want to set the trail
11:15 - so the trail points default color that's
11:18 - the line to D equals player trail okay
11:27 - let's make sure that works so we go in
11:30 - and now I've got a different color
11:33 - scheme going and you can go into
11:36 - settings and change it to neon 2 or neon
11:38 - 3 and you'll see the different color
11:40 - schemes showing up so that'll do it for
11:42 - this time around thanks again for
11:45 - watching make sure to subscribe so you
11:47 - can get the next video next time we're
11:49 - going to start working on the level
11:50 - progression so we can select different
11:52 - types of circles as you advance I'll see
11:55 - you then
12:03 - you

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back this is part six of the circle jump Godot mobile game in this video we're gonna add sound to the game and also start working on the system for doing color schemes alright let's get started okay to start with this time around we're gonna add a new script that we're gonna use as an auto loads I'm gonna say new script here I'm going to call this settings this is where we're gonna put all of our settings code for things that we want to enable it startup things like that configuration so since we're gonna be adding some audio we want to be able to enable and disable sound and music and then we're gonna have some gameplay stuff like circles circles per level so you're gonna go up a level every five circles level is basically going to take care of the increasing difficulty so the higher level you get the more often you're gonna get limited circles or removing circles or things like that so let's add some sounds so over here in main we're gonna have an audio stream player I'm gonna call this one music and the asset for that one in the sounds folder I've got a bunch of sound clips in the assets folder for various things some of them we may not use I just grabbed a bunch of likely sounding ones to start with but we're gonna use this music drop that in the stream there and then on the menu screens we're gonna have a another one and this is gonna be a click sound that'll happen when we tap on buttons and the sound for that one is this menu click wave drop that in there it sounds like just a little click and then on the circle I want it to make a sound when the as when the limited timer ticks down right every time the we wrap around one orbit so it's just gonna make a beep sound and that's using this 89 number 89 I can I got these all from a sound pack so they have numbers on them and we're gonna come back we will come back and discard the ones we don't want later okay and then on the jumper I've got some sounds that I want for this one two actually two of them one is gonna be the jump sound when we press the jump button and one is going to be the capture sound okay and the capture sound is 88 that's this okay and the and believe number 70 is the one we want for the jump yeah okay so we have those in there and then this in our settings here these are gonna determine whether the sounds should play or not so we need to put that in our project settings as on autoload which i've done right here already and then we can go into our code so in main when we have a new game we're gonna say if settings dot enable music music play and then we're actually going to do the same thing when the game ends we're going to stop the music and then we can go through our other ones and then when we press a button we just want to say if settings enable sound will play the click sound on our menu on our circle we're gonna play the beep when we tick down an orbit here I'm able to sound we will beep duck play and then grab that and over here on the jumper we're gonna play the jump sound here when we jump and then on the capture when we get captured here we'll play that capture sound so let's try that out and see if we hear our sounds so here in our menu we're hearing the click when we play we've got music we've got the beep ticking down we've got the jump sound ok now we need to connect up those buttons on the settings screen so we can turn on and off the sound so on our screens script we're going to need to change the button appearance because we in our assets folder we've got an appearance on the buttons audio on audio off and music on music off so we're going to want to alternate between those pictures so let's go ahead and load those into a pair of dictionaries so that I will have a link between the state which is true and the button which I can preload the image of easiest way to do that when it's true audio should be on so I'll drag that path in and then do the same for the other ones so I have my sound buttons on my music buttons defined for true and false loading the appropriate texture and then down here when we check our button we're gonna want to tell it to change so right now we're just passing the button

to pass the name right because we pass the button then we get a button and we will match button name and then we need our to button type so if we press the sound button then we want to toggle that so in the settings we're going to change enable sound to not enable sound which will turn it on and off and then we need to change the button so button dot texture normal is going to be equal to sound buttons and then the value of true or false and then we're going to do the same thing for music so I can probably copy and paste this and make this the music button there we go so let's try that out so now if I go into settings I should be able to toggle these things on and off see when I'm off I'm not getting any clicks so that's good alright let's turn off music and play yeah I've got sound effects now but no music so the other thing I'm gonna do is want to start setting up a way for us to do color schemes and so I've added here to the setting script a dictionary with a name for each color scheme and each color scheme is going to be a list of colors for what thing that they're gonna color and so we're gonna have a background color of the game window the players body the players

so we can select different types of circles as you advance I'll see you then you
