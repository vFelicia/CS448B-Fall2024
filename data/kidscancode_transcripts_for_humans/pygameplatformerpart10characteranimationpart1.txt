00:00 - welcome back to game development of
00:01 - plugin we're continuing work on our
00:04 - platformer game and in this video we
00:06 - will start talking about how to animate
00:09 - our little rabbit character that we
00:11 - added in the previous video okay in the
00:15 - last video we added graphics for our
00:18 - player so I'm using the little rabbit
00:22 - sprite here and so now we have the
00:26 - rabbit just standing still is our is our
00:31 - sprite right which is fine and it looks
00:33 - okay but obviously we could add some
00:36 - more personality and some more and make
00:39 - it look a little better if it had a
00:41 - little bit of animation to it and if we
00:45 - look at the we go over here and look at
00:48 - the sprite sheet there are a bunch of
00:51 - different frames of animation for this
00:55 - rabbit alright so we have the walking
00:57 - which is in two parts which is this one
01:01 - and this one
01:02 - alright so stepping so if you animated
01:06 - but if you were to animate between these
01:08 - two would look like the rabbit is
01:10 - walking and then you flip them in the
01:12 - other direction if you're walking in the
01:13 - other direction we also have the idle
01:16 - animations we're using this one right
01:18 - here right now for standing there's also
01:20 - this one right here so the ears come
01:22 - together and the feet go up a little
01:24 - higher so then it looks like it's sort
01:27 - of bobbing in place and that's your idle
01:29 - animation meaning what happens when
01:31 - you're sitting still and not moving and
01:33 - then we also have this one here which is
01:37 - what we you would use when you jump up
01:40 - in the air and they're all listed over
01:43 - here in the XML under the bunny one
01:46 - names they're two frames of walking we
01:50 - have our jumping ready and stand and so
01:55 - we want to add all of these different
01:57 - frames in and basically just switch the
02:00 - image of our sprite at the appropriate
02:02 - time to the correct frame so
02:09 - here's our player sprite and this is
02:11 - where we're going to want to start
02:13 - changing all of our image codes so first
02:19 - thing we're going to need a few
02:20 - variables to keep track of things so we
02:22 - know what frame to use at a given time
02:24 - so we're going to make a couple of
02:27 - variables here one called walking so
02:30 - that we know whether we should be
02:31 - showing the walking animation or not
02:33 - when we're moving
02:34 - we'll make one called jumping so that we
02:37 - know whether to show the jumping frame
02:40 - of animation and then we're also going
02:44 - to need a variable to keep track of what
02:47 - frame we are on for those animations
02:50 - that have more than one frame like the
02:52 - walking animation has two frames so this
02:55 - will be 0 or 1 if you have an animation
02:59 - that you're using has more frames of
03:01 - animation 4 or 5 or whatever this will
03:03 - work the exact same way this will just
03:05 - keep track of which one it's on and the
03:08 - last thing we'll need here is we're also
03:10 - going to need a variable to keep track
03:13 - of what time we made the last change and
03:18 - that will allow us to set the animation
03:21 - speed right we don't want to change the
03:24 - walking frame every frame of the game
03:26 - because that would be one sixtieth of a
03:28 - second and it will be too fast so we
03:31 - want to space out the frame rate of the
03:36 - walking animation so that it looks so it
03:39 - looks right so if we keep track of when
03:41 - we last made a change we'll know whether
03:42 - it's time to make a change to the next
03:45 - one okay and so now we have to load all
03:51 - the images just like we did here to get
03:53 - the one we're going to have to get all
03:55 - these images out of the sprite sheet and
03:56 - there's going to be a bunch of them so
03:59 - what we're going to do is we're going to
04:00 - just group those all together in a new
04:03 - method called load images okay that way
04:09 - everything's a little bit more organized
04:12 - and we don't have to clutter up our in
04:17 - it anymore with a lot more things
04:22 - so now we want to load all these frames
04:24 - and so we have basically three
04:29 - animations we have the standing
04:30 - animation which has two frames in it we
04:33 - have the walking animation which has two
04:34 - frames in it and we have the jumping
04:37 - animation which has one now if you're
04:42 - using a different set of graphics you
04:45 - went and found a different character
04:46 - with more frames of animation you might
04:48 - have more than that plus the the walking
04:52 - one needs to have the opposite direction
04:54 - as well we have right or left so we need
04:57 - to load all of those things okay let's
05:01 - start with the two standing frame so so
05:08 - we'll make those that's going to be a
05:10 - list because we have two of them right
05:13 - one of them is this one so we're going
05:17 - to put that in the list and then the
05:21 - second one which we'll also put in here
05:25 - just has some different numbers so stand
05:31 - is the one at 614 1063 so we want the
05:40 - one at this one so we're going to grab
05:44 - this one and put this one as the other
05:49 - sprite that we're going to load like
05:54 - that a comma
06:02 - okay so those are our standing frames
06:05 - and now we need to assign the walking
06:10 - frames now we have two of our two
06:13 - directions right so we need to look at
06:15 - this sprite sheet again the walking
06:18 - frames in the picture here are going to
06:21 - the right so those are the ones we're
06:22 - going to use without any changes so
06:26 - we're going to use we'll call this
06:31 - frames are I've left as well we're going
06:35 - to we're going to paste in a get image
06:39 - command so I'll just copy that from here
06:41 - and then we know we're going to want to
06:44 - just change the locations so walk one is
06:51 - this one
07:01 - and then we also have block 2 which is
07:08 - going to go here and we can again grab
07:18 - block twos and actually grab the numbers
07:23 - for that one and then we'll have those
07:26 - two so now we have the two walking
07:29 - frames for going to the right going to
07:32 - the left is basically going to be the
07:35 - same thing we just want to flip them
07:36 - right so what we want to do is take each
07:39 - of these two images and apply the flip
07:43 - transform to them okay
07:48 - so we'll make a walk frames l okay
07:55 - that's going to be a list and then let's
07:57 - just look at the ones in the walk frames
08:01 - our forgot my in so we're going to just
08:07 - go through each of them and then we're
08:09 - going to append the flipped one to the
08:12 - left facing list so what we want to do
08:18 - is say
08:26 - wall frames L dot append a game dot
08:32 - transform dot flip want to flip that
08:39 - frame and then the way the flip command
08:42 - works is you can flip something either
08:44 - horizontally or vertically we don't want
08:46 - to flip horizontally and not vertically
08:51 - so depending on which one of these you
08:54 - said to true or false the first one is
08:55 - the horizontal flip the second one is
08:57 - the vertical flip so now we'll have the
09:00 - two I just notice I spelled transform
09:04 - wrong we'll have the two frames stuck in
09:07 - there and the left list and then the
09:11 - last one we need to load is the jumping
09:14 - one and the jumping one is not an
09:16 - animation we only have one oops we only
09:19 - have one frame for sort of jumping if
09:22 - you had an animation that had more than
09:24 - one frame you could load that here just
09:25 - the same way but we're just going to
09:29 - grab the jump one here maybe we'll come
09:35 - back and add the hurt one later if we if
09:37 - we add that so this is going to be jump
09:46 - frame and this is going to need to have
09:49 - a get image command and fix the
09:59 - formatting
10:03 - and there we go so now we've got all of
10:06 - our images loaded that we want for our
10:10 - character now we can go back over here
10:14 - and our starting image we can set that
10:16 - to the standing frames number zero
10:20 - that'll be loaded because we call load
10:22 - images first which goes down here and
10:24 - does this oh and I just noticed I left
10:27 - out itself there okay
10:30 - so when we run this we should just see
10:34 - the exact same thing we should just load
10:37 - our normal guy oops
10:41 - of course I typed hi game didn't I PG
10:51 - and so now we're going to load that
10:54 - first image right and we have this
10:56 - standing right now so now what we need
10:59 - to do is if we're standing still like
11:01 - this we need to alternate between the
11:03 - two standing frames and then if we start
11:06 - moving left or right we're going to
11:08 - alternate between the walking frames for
11:10 - that direction so let's just get the
11:16 - idle animation the standing animation
11:19 - working first so here's our update and
11:22 - our update we're going to want to go
11:24 - through this you know handles all our
11:26 - movement we're going to want to go
11:27 - through and figure out what frame we
11:28 - need to be on now that can be kind of
11:32 - messy too so what we're going to do is
11:35 - we're going to make another method
11:39 - called animate and we'll let that handle
11:44 - which frame we want to use that'll just
11:48 - go through and pick out you know
11:49 - depending on what we're using now
11:50 - remember I said we had this last update
11:55 - right that's going to be keeping track
11:58 - of what time it was that we changed and
11:59 - that's how we're going to know whether
12:01 - it's time to change to the next one in
12:03 - the list so the first thing we need to
12:07 - do is figure out what time it is right
12:08 - now okay and that will get us
12:14 - how many ticks of the clock it's been
12:16 - since the game started since we
12:18 - initialized everything and now we need
12:22 - to know if we're going to show the idle
12:25 - animation that means we're not walking
12:27 - and we're not jumping so we'll just say
12:31 - if not jumping and not walking and those
12:37 - are both false right now because we set
12:40 - them to false to start with so those
12:42 - will be true at the moment anyway so if
12:47 - now - the last update right if that
12:52 - amount of that will tell us how long
12:54 - it's been since whatever timestamp last
12:56 - update is if that time has been greater
12:59 - than and we're going to try 200
13:03 - milliseconds this is in milliseconds
13:05 - here and we'll see if that works and
13:07 - then we'll play around with it once we
13:08 - see but anyway if 200 milliseconds have
13:11 - gone by since the last update then we
13:15 - want to update so we're going to set the
13:17 - last update equal to now and we're going
13:20 - to loop and we're going to set the
13:21 - current frame equal to right we started
13:27 - on loops scroll up here we started with
13:31 - current frame set equal to 0 right so we
13:33 - want to add 1 which should get us to 1
13:36 - but if we were on 1 and we add 1 we
13:38 - don't want to go to 2 we want to wrap
13:40 - around so what we want to do is say self
13:46 - dot current frame is equal to self dot
13:48 - current frame plus 1 and then we use
13:54 - that the remainder function and then we
13:59 - say whatever the length of standing
14:04 - frames is so if you have two frames in
14:08 - there it's going to get you the
14:10 - remainder when dividing by two if you
14:12 - have three if you have 4 so on so now we
14:16 - can set our image equal to standing
14:21 - frames whatever frame we're supposed to
14:25 - be on
14:26 - okay and that should let us animate our
14:30 - character so let's see what happens
14:38 - oops
14:40 - and once again I'm defeating the purpose
14:42 - of us abbreviating things if I'm going
14:45 - to keep typing out by game when I say it
14:49 - out loud so let's fix that now we can
14:53 - run again and see okay now we're almost
15:00 - there but look what happens we have two
15:01 - things we still have to fix one is we
15:05 - did not set the color key on the frames
15:08 - but the other is you see how the feet
15:10 - are sticking downwards so it's not going
15:12 - to look like our character is jumping up
15:15 - and down it's going to look like it's
15:16 - centered and then the frame is the feet
15:20 - are just poking downwards so we actually
15:22 - need to relocate our rectangle a little
15:28 - bit so that the whenever it alternates
15:30 - frames the rectangle bottom stays the
15:33 - same I also think we can slow down the
15:35 - animation a little bit too that's a
15:37 - little too fast okay so let's go over
15:41 - here and change this to oh let's say 350
15:46 - and then up here in our loading right
15:50 - we're setting the color key we had set
15:53 - the kaki originally to the first one but
15:58 - we need to do it to all of them right so
16:01 - let's do let's take that out and in our
16:08 - each of our frames we can just say we
16:12 - can just say
16:22 - and then we just set frame okay and
16:28 - we'll do the same thing with the
16:32 - frames are and then we won't have to we
16:39 - won't have to do it with actually we
16:40 - already have a loop we can do use we
16:42 - could do with this loop we could just
16:45 - say we could just copy this and do that
16:55 - okay and then we need to just do it with
16:58 - the jump frame so there we go alright
17:06 - now let's take a look and then maybe you
17:08 - can see what I was talking about with
17:09 - the feet there we go so see how my feet
17:16 - are going down into the ground so it
17:19 - doesn't look like I'm standing on the
17:22 - ground I need to look like I'm bouncing
17:23 - up and down a little bit so whenever we
17:29 - change
17:31 - oops we're going to sprites whenever we
17:33 - change which frame were on we're picking
17:37 - the new image we need to change our
17:40 - rectangle okay so we need to take our
17:44 - current we basically need to keep track
17:47 - of where the bottom of our rectangle is
17:49 - okay so bottom is equal to self dot dot
17:55 - bottom and then we need to get a new
17:59 - rectangle we just get the new rectangle
18:05 - for the new frame we switch to and we
18:09 - set the bottom equal to that bottom that
18:10 - we hung on to from the last time and
18:14 - that will look like this there we go so
18:20 - there my guy looks like he's idling and
18:24 - just standing in place while I'm not
18:26 - moving
18:27 - now obviously he's going to keep doing
18:29 - that no matter what I do at the moment
18:30 - because we haven't done the jumping or
18:33 - the walking frames yet
18:35 - but you get the idea we'll do the same
18:38 - thing with walking and standing still so
18:44 - let's stop the video here we've been a
18:46 - little over we've been over 15 minutes
18:48 - here so and in the next video we'll
18:51 - finish up the character animation by
18:54 - adding the adding in the jumping the
18:58 - jumping animation and the walking
18:59 - animation for when we move alright
19:01 - thanks for watching
19:09 - you

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back to game development of plugin we're continuing work on our platformer game and in this video we will start talking about how to animate our little rabbit character that we added in the previous video okay in the last video we added graphics for our player so I'm using the little rabbit sprite here and so now we have the rabbit just standing still is our is our sprite right which is fine and it looks okay but obviously we could add some more personality and some more and make it look a little better if it had a little bit of animation to it and if we look at the we go over here and look at the sprite sheet there are a bunch of different frames of animation for this rabbit alright so we have the walking which is in two parts which is this one and this one alright so stepping so if you animated but if you were to animate between these two would look like the rabbit is walking and then you flip them in the other direction if you're walking in the other direction we also have the idle animations we're using this one right here right now for standing there's also this one right here so the ears come together and the feet go up a little higher so then it looks like it's sort of bobbing in place and that's your idle animation meaning what happens when you're sitting still and not moving and then we also have this one here which is what we you would use when you jump up in the air and they're all listed over here in the XML under the bunny one names they're two frames of walking we have our jumping ready and stand and so we want to add all of these different frames in and basically just switch the image of our sprite at the appropriate time to the correct frame so here's our player sprite and this is where we're going to want to start changing all of our image codes so first thing we're going to need a few variables to keep track of things so we know what frame to use at a given time so we're going to make a couple of variables here one called walking so that we know whether we should be showing the walking animation or not when we're moving we'll make one called jumping so that we know whether to show the jumping frame of animation and then we're also going to need a variable to keep track of what frame we are on for those animations that have more than one frame like the walking animation has two frames so this will be 0 or 1 if you have an animation that you're using has more frames of animation 4 or 5 or whatever this will work the exact same way this will just keep track of which one it's on and the last thing we'll need here is we're also going to need a variable to keep track of what time we made the last change and that will allow us to set the animation speed right we don't want to change the walking frame every frame of the game because that would be one sixtieth of a second and it will be too fast so we want to space out the frame rate of the walking animation so that it looks so it looks right so if we keep track of when we last made a change we'll know whether it's time to make a change to the next one okay and so now we have to load all the images just like we did here to get the one we're going to have to get all these images out of the sprite sheet and there's going to be a bunch of them so what we're going to do is we're going to just group those all together in a new method called load images okay that way everything's a little bit more organized and we don't have to clutter up our in it anymore with a lot more things so now we want to load all these frames and so we have basically three animations we have the standing animation which has two frames in it we have the walking animation which has two frames in it and we have the jumping animation which has one now if you're using a different set of graphics you went and found a different character with more frames of animation you might have more than that plus the the walking one needs to have the opposite direction as well we have right or left so we need to load all of those things okay let's start with the two standing frame so so we'll make those that's going to be a list because we have two of them right one of them is this one so we're going to put that in the list and then the second one which we'll also put in here just has some different numbers so stand is the one at 614 1063 so we want the one at this one so we're going to grab this one and put this one as the other sprite that we're going to load like that a comma okay so those are our standing frames and now we need to assign the walking frames now we have two of our two directions right so we need to look at this sprite sheet again the walking frames in the picture here are going to the right so those are the ones we're going to use without any changes so we're going to use we'll call this frames are I've left as well we're going to we're going to paste in a get image command so I'll just copy that from here and then we know we're going to want to just change the locations so walk one is this one and then we also have block 2 which is going to go here and we can again grab block twos and actually grab the numbers for that one and then we'll have those two so now we have the two walking frames for going to the right going to the left is basically going to be the same thing we just want to flip them right so what we want to do is take each of these two images and apply the flip transform to them okay so we'll make a walk frames l okay that's going to be a list and then let's just look at the ones in the walk frames our forgot my in so we're going to just go through each of them and then we're going to append the flipped one to the left facing list so what we want to do is say wall frames L dot append a game dot transform dot flip want to flip that frame and then the way the flip command works is you can flip something either horizontally or vertically we don't want to flip horizontally and not vertically so depending on which one of these you said to true or false the first one is the horizontal flip the second one is the vertical flip so now we'll have the two I just notice I spelled transform wrong we'll have the two frames stuck in there and the left list and then the last one we need to load is the jumping one and the jumping one is not an animation we only have one oops we only have one frame for sort of jumping if you had an animation that had more than one frame you could load that here just the same way but we're just going to grab the jump one here maybe we'll come back and add the hurt one later if we if we add that so this is going to be jump frame and this is going to need to have a get image command and fix the formatting and there we go so now we've got all of our images loaded that we want for our character now we can go back over here and our starting image we can set that to the standing frames number zero that'll be loaded because we call load images first which goes down here and does this oh and I just noticed I left out itself there okay so when we run this we should just see the exact same thing we should just load our normal guy oops of course I typed hi game didn't I PG and so now we're going to load that first image right and we have this standing right now so now what we need to do is if we're standing still like this we need to alternate between the two standing frames and then if we start moving left or right we're going to alternate between the walking frames for that direction so let's just get the idle animation the standing animation working first so here's our update and our update we're going to want to go through this you know handles all our movement we're going to want to go through and figure out what frame we need to be on now that can be kind of messy too so what we're going to do is we're going to make another method called animate and we'll let that handle which frame we want to use that'll just go through and pick out you know depending on what we're using now remember I said we had this last update right that's going to be keeping track of what time it was that we changed and that's how we're going to know whether it's time to change to the next one in the list so the first thing we need to do is figure out what time it is right now okay and that will get us how many ticks of the clock it's been since the game started since we initialized everything and now we need to know if we're going to show the idle animation that means we're not walking and we're not jumping so we'll just say if not jumping and not walking and those are both false right now because we set them to false to start with so those will be true at the moment anyway so if now the last update right if that amount of that will tell us how long it's been since whatever timestamp last update is if that time has been greater than and we're going to try 200 milliseconds this is in milliseconds here and we'll see if that works and then we'll play around with it once we see but anyway if 200 milliseconds have gone by since the last update then we want to update so we're going to set the last update equal to now and we're going to loop and we're going to set the current frame equal to right we started on loops scroll up here we started with current frame set equal to 0 right so we want to add 1 which should get us to 1 but if we were on 1 and we add 1 we don't want to go to 2 we want to wrap around so what we want to do is say self dot current frame is equal to self dot current frame plus 1 and then we use that the remainder function and then we say whatever the length of standing frames is so if you have two frames in there it's going to get you the remainder when dividing by two if you have three if you have 4 so on so now we can set our image equal to standing frames whatever frame we're supposed to be on okay and that should let us animate our character so let's see what happens oops and once again I'm defeating the purpose of us abbreviating things if I'm going to keep typing out by game when I say it out loud so let's fix that now we can run again and see okay now we're almost there but look what happens we have two things we still have to fix one is we did not set the color key on the frames but the other is you see how the feet are sticking downwards so it's not going to look like our character is jumping up and down it's going to look like it's centered and then the frame is the feet are just poking downwards so we actually need to relocate our rectangle a little bit so that the whenever it alternates frames the rectangle bottom stays the same I also think we can slow down the animation a little bit too that's a little too fast okay so let's go over here and change this to oh let's say 350 and then up here in our loading right we're setting the color key we had set the kaki originally to the first one but we need to do it to all of them right so let's do let's take that out and in our each of our frames we can just say we can just say and then we just set frame okay and we'll do the same thing with the frames are and then we won't have to we won't have to do it with actually we already have a loop we can do use we could do with this loop we could just say we could just copy this and do that okay and then we need to just do it with the jump frame so there we go alright now let's take a look and then maybe you can see what I was talking about with the feet there we go so see how my feet are going down into the ground so it doesn't look like I'm standing on the ground I need to look like I'm bouncing up and down a little bit so whenever we change oops we're going to sprites whenever we change which frame were on we're picking the new image we need to change our rectangle okay so we need to take our current we basically need to keep track of where the bottom of our rectangle is okay so bottom is equal to self dot dot bottom and then we need to get a new rectangle we just get the new rectangle for the new frame we switch to and we set the bottom equal to that bottom that we hung on to from the last time and that will look like this there we go so there my guy looks like he's idling and just standing in place while I'm not moving now obviously he's going to keep doing that no matter what I do at the moment because we haven't done the jumping or the walking frames yet but you get the idea we'll do the same thing with walking and standing still so let's stop the video here we've been a little over we've been over 15 minutes here so and in the next video we'll finish up the character animation by adding the adding in the jumping the jumping animation and the walking animation for when we move alright thanks for watching you
