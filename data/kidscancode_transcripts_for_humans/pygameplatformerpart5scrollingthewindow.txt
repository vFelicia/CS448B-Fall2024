00:00 - welcome back to game development with
00:02 - pygame this is part 5 of our platformer
00:05 - game we're going to talk about scrolling
00:09 - the window so that we can keep moving as
00:12 - we hit the edges of the screen all right
00:17 - at this point we have a game where we
00:20 - can jump around on platforms and all the
00:24 - mechanics are working well but if we're
00:27 - gonna continue along the direction of
00:29 - making this a doodle jump style game
00:31 - then we want to be able to continue
00:33 - jumping higher and higher that's the
00:36 - goal is to see how how long you can keep
00:39 - going upwards so we want well there's a
00:43 - couple ways you can look at it we want
00:44 - the camera to move up although
00:47 - technically we don't really have a
00:49 - camera in this game we just have the the
00:51 - game window here the other way to look
00:54 - at it is we want everything on the
00:55 - screen to move downwards right that's
00:58 - what would happen if the camera went up
01:00 - then everything would look like it moved
01:02 - down so we want to move everything on
01:03 - the screen downwards and then have new
01:07 - platforms that are up above the top of
01:10 - the screen move into the window ok so
01:14 - typically you want to do that somewhere
01:17 - you know around the middle point of I
01:19 - mean a around a quarter of the way from
01:21 - the top right about here when our player
01:24 - reaches this height is when we want to
01:26 - scroll the screen so let's go down here
01:32 - to our update section of our game loop
01:35 - and I'm gonna actually collapse some of
01:38 - these other ones that we don't need to
01:39 - look at right now to keep us from being
01:41 - distracted all right we're looking at
01:44 - the update section of our game loop and
01:46 - what we want to do here is we want to
01:49 - check for when the player reaches the
01:50 - top that line that we that we marked off
01:55 - which is the top quarter of the screen
01:58 - right so if player reaches top 1/4 of
02:05 - screen so what that means is if the
02:10 - player rect
02:13 - dot top is less than or equal to height
02:16 - over four right if that happens then we
02:21 - want to move everything down right and
02:24 - that includes the platform and the
02:27 - player or all the platforms and the
02:29 - player so we're gonna take the player
02:33 - position right because that's the the
02:35 - pause dot why is the variable that's
02:39 - actually tracking where the player is
02:40 - okay and we're gonna add the player
02:44 - velocity now we're moving upwards right
02:49 - so our velocity is negative so we're
02:53 - just gonna take the absolute value of it
02:55 - which means taking out the sign right so
02:59 - move at whatever speed the player is
03:01 - moving at right because if you think of
03:03 - it as a camera that's scrolling we
03:05 - wouldn't want it to move at a different
03:07 - speed than the player is because then
03:08 - it's gonna be it's not gonna be smooth
03:12 - then we need to take all the platforms
03:18 - so we'll go through each platform in the
03:21 - self dot platforms take the platform's
03:25 - rectangle and add also add the player
03:28 - velocity to it okay so for each platform
03:34 - we're moving the platform down at
03:38 - whatever the speed the player is so what
03:41 - that should mean oops where did I put
03:46 - self dot player all right so when we get
03:51 - up here see things start scrolling down
03:54 - when we hit that line all right I'll run
03:57 - it again one more time so you can see it
04:01 - right so they'll put my mouse right here
04:04 - right about when we get here right we
04:06 - push downwards right and now of course
04:09 - there's nowhere else to go because
04:11 - there's no more platforms
04:18 - well we have two things we need to worry
04:20 - about now when I jump upwards these
04:25 - existing platforms they're scrolling
04:27 - down off the bottom right so they're
04:28 - down here somewhere there their
04:30 - y-coordinate is greater than the height
04:33 - of the screen so they're down here
04:35 - somewhere and if we were to keep
04:37 - spawning new platforms and keep
04:39 - scrolling them off the bottom eventually
04:41 - we're gonna have lots of platforms down
04:43 - here more and more right and remember
04:46 - that the collisions the way the
04:50 - collisions work is we check if the
04:52 - player collides with any platforms so if
04:55 - that if this platforms group just keeps
04:57 - getting bigger and bigger
04:58 - we're wasting we're wasting processing
05:03 - power and we're wasting time
05:05 - checking for collisions with things that
05:07 - are way way off the screen down below
05:09 - and eventually if you were really good
05:12 - at the game and you got really high then
05:14 - that would start causing a lag because
05:15 - we're trying to collide with thousands
05:18 - of platforms but there's only you know
05:19 - five or six on the screen so what we
05:21 - want to do is we want to delete the
05:23 - platforms that go off the bottom so when
05:25 - we move the platform here we're just
05:28 - gonna say if the plat top is greater
05:33 - than equal to height so if the top of
05:34 - the platform goes off the bottom of the
05:36 - screen then we're just gonna kill the
05:38 - platform that way we're only worried
05:41 - about the ones that are on the screen
05:43 - right and that won't look any different
05:45 - because we're they're gonna go off
05:46 - before we delete them but it does mean
05:49 - that there's nothing there anymore when
05:51 - we fall down and that's fine because we
05:59 - don't want to go down or do we want to
06:00 - go upwards so we need to think about
06:02 - spawning some new platforms well if we
06:06 - have been killing the ones that go off
06:08 - the bottom then our group is getting
06:10 - smaller so what we could do is respawn
06:13 - new ones to replace the ones that are
06:16 - gone that way we'll keep you know a
06:20 - similar amount of platforms on the
06:22 - screen on average because we don't want
06:25 - there to be too many and we don't want
06:27 - there to be too few so remember we're
06:30 - making five
06:32 - forms here right to start with those are
06:35 - the ones we see on the screen at the
06:36 - beginning and whenever we jump up we
06:40 - might be in this frame when we jump
06:42 - upwards we might be deleting one or two
06:44 - or even three however many scrolled off
06:46 - right so we need to spawn new platforms
06:50 - to keep the same average number of
06:55 - platforms so what we'll do is we'll make
06:59 - a little while loop and as long as the
07:00 - length of the platform's group is less
07:06 - than six I'm going to say six we have
07:09 - five starting so we'll actually be
07:11 - spawning another one up above then we
07:13 - want to spawn a new platform and the
07:15 - place we want to spawn it is above the
07:17 - top right so that we see it scroll in as
07:19 - we jump up so we're gonna spawn a new
07:22 - platform okay let's call it P for short
07:24 - because there's gonna be a long line
07:25 - this is gonna be a platform and we're
07:29 - going to randomize this a bit okay and
07:34 - actually we need to randomize first we
07:36 - need to randomize what the width is so
07:38 - let's grab a a width real quick and this
07:41 - is gonna be a random number for how wide
07:44 - you want this new platform responding to
07:48 - be right and so I'll put like 50 to 100
07:53 - okay and then when we spawn the platform
07:56 - we need to say what X we were gonna use
07:58 - well we're gonna use random dot R and
08:00 - range and we're going to choose a number
08:03 - between 0 so this is the X right so it's
08:06 - going to be either right on this side or
08:09 - right on this side minus however wide we
08:14 - decide to make it okay and then the
08:18 - second category is the why well why we
08:24 - want it to be above the top of the
08:26 - screen so we want to spawn somewhere up
08:29 - above the top so we'll put it between
08:31 - say minus 75 and minus 30 we're gonna
08:38 - make the platform's
08:38 - we're making our platforms 20 pixels
08:41 - thick so we don't want to spawn it
08:42 - somewhere where it's going to already be
08:44 - sticking below so
08:45 - this is up above the top of the plot of
08:48 - the window okay
08:51 - the width is going to be whatever width
08:53 - we decided to use and the height is
08:55 - going to be 20 okay so that's our new
08:58 - platform we need to add this to the
09:06 - group's all sprites okay and now we
09:13 - should be seeing some new platforms
09:14 - start spawning let's see what happens
09:16 - okay
09:18 - there we go so now these are random
09:21 - right so there's gonna be times so I
09:23 - could barely make that jump when you
09:25 - might not be able to make the jump
09:27 - although remember you can go in both
09:29 - directions so you can always jump off
09:30 - this way and land on one over there
09:32 - which is a nice trick okay
09:34 - now this is working and we can go pretty
09:38 - far although I might have hit a spot
09:41 - here where I can't get any further and
09:44 - that's gonna be possible too
09:46 - but that's okay at this point we're not
09:48 - trying to make this perfect yet we just
09:51 - want to make sure that we are spawning
09:52 - new platforms and they're showing up and
09:55 - we can go from one to the next and there
09:58 - you see when your random sometimes
09:59 - they're gonna be right on top of each
10:01 - other but this is a fast-paced game it's
10:03 - gonna keep going so we're gonna be yeah
10:06 - see there that's a little problem we're
10:08 - gonna have to deal with at some point
10:12 - and it's kind of fun already even though
10:15 - there's no real challenge yet okay okay
10:26 - I'm gonna stop here and leave this for
10:28 - you to play around with at this point
10:31 - play around with this number how many
10:34 - platforms you want to have on the screen
10:37 - or have an existence at any given time
10:41 - play around with how you're randomizing
10:44 - the new platforms right maybe you want
10:47 - to make more skinnier ones maybe you
10:50 - want to make fewer wide ones maybe you
10:53 - want to try different locations for them
10:55 - you want them not so close to the edges
10:58 - things like that play
10:59 - with that also you can adjust how it
11:02 - works by changing over in your sprite
11:05 - how how fast or how powerful the jump is
11:10 - right by changing this and this player
11:14 - acceleration right we we talked about
11:16 - this before the player acceleration and
11:18 - the player friction are gonna affect how
11:20 - the player moves so you can adjust how
11:24 - far they can jump horizontally as well
11:28 - as how far they can jump vertically so
11:30 - play around with that find it find it
11:32 - you know find a setting that you like
11:34 - see if you can see if you can play it
11:36 - for a little while and then in the next
11:38 - video we will move on and start talking
11:42 - about improving our graphics
11:53 - you

welcome back to game development with pygame this is part 5 of our platformer game we're going to talk about scrolling the window so that we can keep moving as we hit the edges of the screen all right at this point we have a game where we can jump around on platforms and all the mechanics are working well but if we're gonna continue along the direction of making this a doodle jump style game then we want to be able to continue jumping higher and higher that's the goal is to see how how long you can keep going upwards so we want well there's a couple ways you can look at it we want the camera to move up although technically we don't really have a camera in this game we just have the the game window here the other way to look at it is we want everything on the screen to move downwards right that's what would happen if the camera went up then everything would look like it moved down so we want to move everything on the screen downwards and then have new platforms that are up above the top of the screen move into the window ok so typically you want to do that somewhere you know around the middle point of I mean a around a quarter of the way from the top right about here when our player reaches this height is when we want to scroll the screen so let's go down here to our update section of our game loop and I'm gonna actually collapse some of these other ones that we don't need to look at right now to keep us from being distracted all right we're looking at the update section of our game loop and what we want to do here is we want to check for when the player reaches the top that line that we that we marked off which is the top quarter of the screen right so if player reaches top 1/4 of screen so what that means is if the player rect dot top is less than or equal to

platforms well we have two things we need to worry about now when I jump upwards these existing platforms they're scrolling down off the bottom right so they're down here somewhere there their ycoordinate is greater than the height of the screen so they're down here somewhere and if we were to keep spawning new platforms and keep scrolling them off the bottom eventually we're gonna have lots of platforms down here more and more right and remember that the collisions the way the collisions work is we check if the player collides with any platforms so if that if this platforms group just keeps getting bigger and bigger we're wasting we're wasting processing power and we're wasting time checking for collisions with things that are way way off the screen down below and eventually if you were really good at the game and you got really high then that would start causing a lag because we're trying to collide with thousands of platforms but there's only you know five or six on the screen so what we want to do is we want to delete the platforms that go off the bottom so when we move the platform here we're just gonna say if the plat top is greater than equal to height so if the top of the platform goes off the bottom of the screen then we're just gonna kill the platform that way we're only worried about the ones that are on the screen right and that won't look any different because we're they're gonna go off before we delete them but it does mean that there's nothing there anymore when we fall down and that's fine because we don't want to go down or do we want to go upwards so we need to think about spawning some new platforms well if we have been killing the ones that go off the bottom then our group is getting smaller so what we could do is respawn new ones to
