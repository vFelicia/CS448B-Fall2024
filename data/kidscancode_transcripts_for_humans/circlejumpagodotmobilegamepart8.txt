00:00 - hi welcome to part 8 of circle jump the
00:02 - Godot mobile game development series in
00:04 - this installment we're going to talk
00:06 - about implementing a difficulty curve
00:08 - making the game get more and more
00:10 - challenging the farther you progress to
00:13 - begin we're going to use the level to
00:15 - determine what type of circles are
00:17 - spawned so in the main script here when
00:20 - we initialize the circle we're gonna
00:23 - pass the level and then on the circle
00:27 - script instead of passing in these
00:29 - things we're just gonna pass in level
00:32 - with a default value of 1 and that's
00:34 - going to determine what type of circles
00:38 - whether it's moving all that kind of
00:40 - stuff now to set the mode we're gonna
00:42 - want to randomly choose between static
00:45 - and limited or other ones when we add
00:47 - more but I want them to be weighted I
00:49 - want it to be much more likely to pick
00:51 - static early on in fact it should be a
00:54 - hundred percent chance of picking static
00:55 - at level one but then as you get to
00:58 - higher and higher levels limited becomes
01:00 - more often and so we want a weighted
01:04 - random number and to do a weighted
01:06 - random number we need a we need to
01:09 - define some weights so the mode the way
01:16 - we would define the weights would be
01:17 - something like this for example this is
01:20 - just an example but so I have a 10 to 1
01:23 - chance of choosing static over limited
01:25 - so the total number of chances here is
01:28 - 11 so 10 out of those 11 will be static
01:30 - one of those 11 would be limited and to
01:34 - choose a weighted method like this we
01:39 - need a function I'm going to put that in
01:40 - settings we're just going to make a
01:42 - static function for this so you pass it
01:49 - an array of weights and it's going to
01:51 - return to you which one it picked so the
01:55 - first thing you do is you need to sum up
01:56 - the weights
02:08 - now we have a sum of weights we're gonna
02:11 - pick a random number between that range
02:18 - and then we go through each of the
02:23 - weights in the array and if our number
02:30 - we picked is less than that one we're on
02:35 - then we're gonna return that one
02:39 - but if it's not then we will subtract it
02:43 - from num and try again till either
02:50 - picked one or reach the last one this is
02:54 - a pretty common algorithm for choosing a
02:56 - weighted random number in case it's not
02:58 - clear you haven't run into this before
03:00 - let's consider our example one where our
03:03 - weights array was 10 comma 1 so we sum
03:07 - it up the total is 11 so we pick a
03:10 - random number between 0 and 10 let's say
03:14 - that we picked 7 it picked or 7.32 8 you
03:19 - know it's gonna be some number 7 we go
03:22 - through each of the index indices of the
03:26 - weights and it's 7 less than the first
03:30 - weight well the first weight was 10 so
03:31 - it is so we would return 0 and so 0 is
03:35 - the first item so we picked the first
03:36 - item but let's say our random number was
03:39 - ten point four well ten point four is
03:42 - not less than the first item which is
03:45 - ten so we instead subtract ten so ten
03:50 - point four becomes 0.4 and then we
03:53 - compared to the last next one is 0.4
03:55 - less than one yes so we're going to
03:58 - return index number one so now we can go
04:01 - back over to the circle and here for our
04:04 - weights we'll call settings ran weighted
04:10 - and pass it this array of weights and
04:13 - I'm going to make the second
04:14 - 1v level -1 because that way at level 1
04:19 - we'll have a 0% chance of a limited
04:21 - circle appearing okay so next we have
04:24 - the move range which I'm going to want
04:26 - to have progressive as well and the
04:29 - radius I want them as you get up in
04:31 - level 2 start shrinking as well so to
04:35 - set the move we're gonna have a chance
04:39 - move chance is going to be what the odds
04:42 - are that you will spawn a moving circle
04:46 - and I'm gonna make that level minus 10
04:52 - I'm going to clamp it between 0 and 9
04:54 - and divide by 10 so that's gonna give me
04:58 - a percentage chance but for the first 10
05:01 - levels we'll have 0 so there won't be
05:04 - any moving circles the first 10 levels
05:06 - and then once we have that move chance
05:10 - we can just pick a random number and if
05:14 - that number is less than the move chance
05:15 - then we have a moving circle and then we
05:19 - need to randomize the move range and we
05:23 - also need to memorize the move speed
05:25 - because as you get higher and higher
05:27 - they get more difficult they might move
05:30 - faster and the Ranger should get larger
05:34 - so to figure this out there's a there's
05:39 - a few different ways you can do it in
05:40 - one way that I like to do it is to use a
05:44 - tool called desmos desmos is a graphing
05:49 - tool and so here's a little formula I
05:51 - put in here to take X is the level so I
05:57 - want it to be flat up to level 10 ramped
06:00 - up and then cap out somewhere close to 1
06:04 - all right basically 0.95 once you get to
06:08 - Oh what is this at level 29 and so you
06:13 - can play around with these numbers and
06:15 - see how it's going to change your curve
06:20 - and obviously this is going to take a
06:23 - lot of play testing and and
06:26 - experimentation to figure out
06:28 - the best progression curve is but these
06:30 - give us some starting points where we
06:32 - can we have something to start with so
06:35 - I've done that for the move range I
06:37 - picked a couple of formulas I think will
06:38 - work
06:49 - okay so that gives us our move range
06:52 - just gonna get smaller as the I'm sorry
06:56 - get larger as the level goes up but has
06:59 - a minimum amount because we don't want
07:02 - too little vibration will look weird and
07:05 - then the move speed is also going to be
07:10 - based on the level this is the amount of
07:14 - time for the tween to execute so it's
07:16 - number of seconds
07:22 - so now we've set our move range and our
07:25 - move speed and the last one is going to
07:28 - be this size and this is also going to
07:33 - be a chance we have a chance that the
07:35 - circle will be smaller than average
07:44 - and then if we do have it then we will
07:48 - randomize the radius
07:55 - and now to give me a way to test this
07:58 - out without having to play a successful
08:01 - game a whole bunch of times I'm going to
08:03 - test it out by spawning a bunch of
08:04 - circles
08:05 - and I made a little test scene to do
08:09 - that with I'm not going to go too much
08:10 - through the script but what it does is
08:12 - spawns a hundred circles calling the
08:15 - same spawn circle code we use in Maine
08:17 - and then it just keeps track of some
08:19 - stuff so that I can scroll the camera up
08:22 - and down and see what level I'm on so
08:24 - let's try it out and see what it looks
08:25 - like so here is four sequence of circles
08:33 - getting to level to get to level three
08:37 - we get our first limited circle and
08:42 - hopefully as we go we should see more
08:46 - limited circle showing up they're
08:50 - becoming a little more common our at
08:56 - level 10 and then now we should soon we
09:01 - should start seeing some moving circles
09:04 - appear there's one with a little bit
09:07 - smaller radius there's some moving one
09:12 - there's a small one you can see as we're
09:18 - going up now we're getting more moving
09:21 - ones right so this way we can test our
09:25 - progression and see if it's going the
09:28 - way we want it to go and I'm not
09:31 - intending for this to be balanced yet
09:32 - just to be something that we can test
09:36 - out and adjust okay and another bug that
09:40 - I noticed that I missed last time was
09:42 - when we were setting the colors this is
09:45 - not doing anything because we have our
09:47 - line 2d using a gradient so default
09:49 - color isn't used so what we want to do
09:52 - with the player trail here
09:55 - is I'm going to stick it in a variable
09:57 - and then on the gradient we need to say
10:04 - set color and we want the end color to
10:09 - be that then I'm going to take the trail
10:14 - color and set the Alpha to zero for
10:17 - transparent to fade out and then and
10:19 - then trail gradient set color zero to
10:27 - that and that will do the trail
10:31 - correctly which you can see here since
10:34 - we're on a particular theme see the
10:37 - purple fading on okay will that'll do it
10:43 - for this part in the next installment
10:45 - we're gonna look at some visual effects
10:47 - and maybe some particles start making
10:50 - things look a little juicier and thanks

Cleaned transcript:

hi welcome to part 8 of circle jump the Godot mobile game development series in this installment we're going to talk about implementing a difficulty curve making the game get more and more challenging the farther you progress to begin we're going to use the level to determine what type of circles are spawned so in the main script here when we initialize the circle we're gonna pass the level and then on the circle script instead of passing in these things we're just gonna pass in level with a default value of 1 and that's going to determine what type of circles whether it's moving all that kind of stuff now to set the mode we're gonna want to randomly choose between static and limited or other ones when we add more but I want them to be weighted I want it to be much more likely to pick static early on in fact it should be a hundred percent chance of picking static at level one but then as you get to higher and higher levels limited becomes more often and so we want a weighted random number and to do a weighted random number we need a we need to define some weights so the mode the way we would define the weights would be something like this for example this is just an example but so I have a 10 to 1 chance of choosing static over limited so the total number of chances here is 11 so 10 out of those 11 will be static one of those 11 would be limited and to choose a weighted method like this we need a function I'm going to put that in settings we're just going to make a static function for this so you pass it an array of weights and it's going to return to you which one

number was ten point four well ten point four is not less than the first item which is ten so we instead subtract ten so ten point four becomes 0.4 and then we compared to the last next one is 0.4 less than one yes so we're going to return index number one so now we can go back over to the circle and here for our weights we'll call settings ran weighted and pass it this array of weights and I'm
