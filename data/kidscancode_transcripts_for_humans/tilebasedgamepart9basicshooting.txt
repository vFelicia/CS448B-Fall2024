00:00 - welcome back to game development pi
00:02 - games this is part 9 of our tile-based
00:04 - top-down shooter game and in this video
00:08 - we're gonna actually start adding
00:11 - shooting so now that our Dom bees can
00:16 - chase us we need to give the player a
00:17 - way to fight back so we're going to add
00:20 - a bullet so over here in the settings
00:24 - I'm going to make some variables for the
00:28 - properties of our gun and so first we're
00:34 - gonna set up a bullet image and there is
00:38 - a bullet PNG that I pull it out of the
00:42 - kennyart pack which you can get at the
00:44 - link below it's just a little circular
00:47 - bullet and we're gonna set the bullet
00:51 - speed it's how fast the bullet will
00:55 - travel a little bit much faster than the
00:58 - player which moves at 300 and we're also
01:01 - gonna put a bullet lifetime and that's
01:05 - is this is gonna be how long the bullet
01:06 - lasts so if you fire a bullet it doesn't
01:09 - keep going forever it's going to
01:12 - disappear after 1000 milliseconds one
01:16 - second so now we can go over here to our
01:20 - sprites and we can start defining the
01:23 - sprite and I'm gonna make a little
01:27 - shortcut here I've created a shortcut to
01:30 - pasted in here we're gonna make a bullet
01:32 - and the bullet is going to need some
01:35 - information when it spawns we need to
01:37 - tell it where we want it to be position
01:39 - and what direction it needs to travel in
01:42 - and both of those will be vectors local
01:46 - location for where it will spawn and the
01:48 - direction that it will travel in and
01:51 - then the image is just going to be game
01:57 - dot bullet image which we need to load
01:59 - over in our load data there we are
02:06 - we'll just
02:08 - duplicate this and we will load the
02:12 - bullet image and that's going to be
02:26 - that's going to be the bullet image okay
02:31 - and while we're over here we'll also add
02:34 - a group we're going to want another
02:38 - group to put all of our bullets in okay
02:44 - so now okay so we have our bullets
02:53 - spawning our position is going to be
02:57 - that position that we passed in and
03:01 - we're gonna put our rectangle there our
03:05 - velocity is going to be that direction
03:07 - vector that we passed in which is going
03:09 - to be a direction vector is just a
03:11 - vector with a length of one alright just
03:13 - going to be a unit vector pointing the
03:15 - direction we want the bullet to travel
03:16 - so we need to multiply that by the
03:19 - bullet speed so we know which way to go
03:23 - and then we also need to track our spawn
03:25 - time that way we know when to delete the
03:31 - bullet okay and then the update is just
03:35 - going to be to move
03:43 - move at our velocity update our
03:48 - rectangle to that location and then if
03:56 - it's going to take get ticks - spawn
04:00 - time if that is greater than the bullet
04:07 - life time then we delete the bullet okay
04:13 - so that's good enough for now let me fix
04:15 - this capital B here all right so there's
04:19 - our bullet all we need to know about our
04:21 - sprite it's gonna spawn and now we need
04:25 - to spawn it now we have all our key
04:28 - controls up here on our player for when
04:29 - the player is moving so we're just going
04:34 - to add another one here for K space oh
04:48 - and we need one more setting here
04:51 - actually we need a bullet rate this is
04:57 - going to be how often how fast we can
05:00 - shoot if we hold the spacebar down how
05:01 - fast did the bullets get produced we can
05:07 - make that faster slower for a machine
05:09 - gun effect and so on so we need to use
05:11 - that over here to tell whether it's time
05:17 - to shoot or not so we're gonna keep
05:23 - track of them when the last time we shot
05:25 - was
05:32 - all right if that's been long enough
05:38 - then we can spawn a bullet so we need to
05:41 - figure out what direction we're pointing
05:44 - in so we make a unit vector and we just
05:46 - rotate it at the players rotation and
05:51 - then we can spawn a bullet okay
05:55 - and we just pass it the game we pass it
06:00 - the position of the player and we pass
06:06 - it that direction that we just figured
06:07 - out and then we just need to go here and
06:11 - say last shot equals zero so we haven't
06:17 - shot yet when we spawn the player okay
06:22 - so let's try this out we're gonna shoot
06:25 - we have a small typo in our bullet we
06:32 - need to store our game reference so that
06:35 - we can use it down here all right now
06:38 - we're gonna try this out now watch what
06:40 - happens when I shoot well my player is
06:44 - flying right so I'm spawning a bullet
06:46 - but my player is flying at the bullet
06:49 - speed what is going on well here's
06:53 - what's happening so when we shoot when
06:58 - we fire
06:59 - we're telling we're sending our player's
07:02 - position to the bullet right and then
07:07 - the bullet is taking that position and
07:11 - changing it so we're basically using the
07:14 - same position for our player and our
07:17 - bullet so when we update our bullets
07:19 - position it also updates the player's
07:21 - position and that's no good we don't
07:23 - want to do that what we want to do is we
07:25 - want this to be a copy so the vector
07:30 - class you can just if you pass a vector
07:33 - into the vet command it makes a new
07:35 - vector that has the same that's equal to
07:39 - that but isn't the same vector right so
07:41 - if we run this now
07:44 - right now I can shoot I'm holding the
07:46 - button down I'm and you can see how the
07:49 - you can see how the bullets are timing
07:53 - out when they have gone traveled for one
07:56 - whole second right they don't go further
07:58 - than that but we probably don't want
08:01 - them to go through the walls either all
08:05 - right we probably want them to stop when
08:08 - they hit the walls so let's also put
08:11 - here in the bullets update we can use
08:17 - the sprite collide any function because
08:21 - I don't care what wall it hits if it
08:23 - hits any wall all right if it hits any
08:28 - wall then it should just get deleted
08:32 - so that's going to look like this okay
08:36 - so the bullet hits the wall it stops
08:41 - okay now what about making it well
08:47 - before we have it hit the zombie let's
08:49 - have a look at where the bullets
08:51 - spawning right the bullet it's coming
08:52 - out of the center of the player but I'd
08:55 - really like it to look like it's coming
08:56 - out of the gun so that means we need to
08:58 - offset the spawn of the bullet to where
09:03 - the barrel of the gun is relative to the
09:06 - center of the player right so as it
09:08 - turns it's always at the same position
09:11 - relative to the player it's to the
09:14 - player's right a little bit and forward
09:15 - from the center okay so I'm gonna go
09:23 - over here did the settings and I'm gonna
09:25 - make an offset so on the players sprite
09:28 - there's gonna be a barrel offset and
09:33 - this is gonna be a vector representing
09:35 - how far from the center of the sprite
09:37 - the barrel of the gun is and so this is
09:43 - gonna be a vector now we need to figure
09:46 - out exactly where that is and where it's
09:48 - going to look good right and so this is
09:51 - relative to the center so if we imagine
09:54 - the player is before the player rotates
09:57 - he's facing to the right
09:58 - so that means we're gonna want to move
10:00 - some positive number of pixels in the
10:05 - x-direction right just the bullet is
10:08 - forward of the player and it's also down
10:12 - some amount right so let's just move it
10:17 - 20 pixels forward and 20 pixels down or
10:21 - 20 pixels forward and twinkles to the
10:22 - right of the player and and we'll see if
10:25 - that's good enough we'll adjust it once
10:27 - we have it working okay
10:30 - but that also means that if I'm gonna
10:33 - have a vector in my in my settings file
10:39 - I'm going to have to define it here like
10:46 - we've done in the other files okay
10:48 - so we have our so we have our offset and
10:56 - we're going to adjust that but we need
10:59 - to use that over here when we spawn the
11:01 - bullet now what we're gonna do is we're
11:04 - gonna do it in our code where we shoot
11:06 - which was right here okay so when we
11:10 - spawn the bullet instead of sending the
11:13 - position of the player itself we need to
11:16 - add we need to add that offset so we're
11:22 - gonna say the position where we that we
11:24 - want is the player's position it's
11:28 - whatever the player's position is plus
11:31 - the barrel offset rotated to match the
11:38 - players rotation right that way it will
11:42 - be pointing in the direct right
11:43 - direction and then we send that that's
11:46 - the position that we're going to send to
11:48 - the bullet so let's see what that looks
11:49 - like and if we guess some good values
11:52 - for where a bullet will spawn well let's
11:55 - get out of the way of some of these
11:56 - looks like we're too far to the right
11:58 - and we could maybe go a little more
12:00 - forward right notice how it rotates as I
12:03 - move around and it'll always spawns 20
12:08 - pixels over and 20 pixels forward
12:11 - so let's move it a little bit more let's
12:16 - move it a little bit more forward and a
12:20 - little bit less to the right let's see
12:26 - what that looks like
12:29 - well that looks much better
12:31 - okay so now it looks like the bullets
12:34 - are coming out of the gun when I shoot
12:37 - them and not spawning in midair or
12:41 - coming out of the player alright let's
12:46 - add one other thing to the bullets and
12:49 - that is I would like them to have I
12:51 - would like it to have a little bit of
12:52 - kickback and that means it's when you
12:55 - fire the gun it's gonna push the player
12:57 - back a little bit okay
13:00 - and the kickback is gonna be a speed
13:03 - that it's gonna push us backwards so
13:05 - let's make that let's try 200 and see
13:10 - how that looks so that means when we
13:13 - spawn the bullet here we also want to
13:18 - add we also want to modify the player's
13:20 - velocity so we spawn the bullet and we
13:23 - set the velocity equal to the kickback
13:29 - right in the negative direction also
13:32 - rotated at whatever the player is so now
13:38 - when I fire the gun it should push me
13:40 - backwards I'm gonna get out of the way
13:41 - of these zombies so we have a chance to
13:43 - see it yeah see how I get a little bit
13:46 - of zombies are annoying when you can't
13:49 - get rid of them
13:50 - get over here where they can't chase me
13:52 - let's see I get a little bit of a push
13:54 - backwards when I fire my gun okay so one
14:04 - other thing that would make the shooting
14:05 - look a little nicer is to give the gun a
14:09 - little bit of inaccuracy okay and what
14:12 - that means is every bullet isn't going
14:15 - to come out in a perfectly straight line
14:16 - there's going to be a spread some will
14:19 - go a little bit to the left a little bit
14:20 - to the right and this number will
14:22 - represent how many degrees to the left
14:24 - or right
14:25 - of straight that the bullet will travel
14:29 - so that means when we go over here to
14:32 - our sprites when we spawn the bullet we
14:34 - want to pick a random number between -5
14:38 - and 5 and add that to our direction okay
14:43 - and so we're gonna take and we're gonna
14:48 - pick a random value and for this I don't
14:53 - want a random value that's an integer I
14:56 - don't want it to just be -5 - 4 - 3 - 2
15:00 - and so on I want any number between
15:03 - minus 5 and plus 5 including any kind of
15:06 - real number so that means I can go up
15:09 - here and at the top from random I'm
15:13 - gonna import uniform and that's exactly
15:17 - what the uniform random command does is
15:19 - it gives you a real number back that's
15:21 - between your two bounds okay so spread
15:25 - is going to be a uniform between minus
15:28 - the gun spread and the gun spread okay
15:33 - so we go so we now have a random number
15:36 - somewhere between minus 5 and plus 5 so
15:39 - we just take our direction vector and we
15:41 - rotate it by that spread so it'll rotate
15:47 - a little bit to the left or a little bit
15:49 - to the right okay and what that's gonna
15:52 - do is let us see some spread let's see
15:58 - how the bullets are not all going in the
16:01 - same direction just to see it even more
16:04 - and we probably wouldn't want to do this
16:06 - but if you had a really bad inaccurate
16:08 - gun right you can see they're spraying
16:15 - out in all directions okay so that's
16:18 - perfect that's what we want to do so
16:21 - we're going to leave that at 5 so it's
16:22 - just a little bit of variety in there
16:27 - okay last but not least we want these
16:31 - bullets to kill the zombies now just to
16:35 - keep it simple right now we're gonna add
16:39 - in our update section we're just going
16:41 - to do a PG dot sprite that group collide
16:47 - all right we want to collide two groups
16:50 - the mobs group and the bullets group and
16:55 - what do we want to do well we want the
16:58 - we want the mobs that get hit we're
17:03 - going to put false and the bullets they
17:05 - get hit we're gonna put true so the
17:08 - bullets disappear when they into the
17:09 - zombie and the zombie does not disappear
17:12 - but what we're gonna do is for each of
17:17 - those hits we are just gonna say hit
17:19 - kill just for the moment because the
17:22 - mobs don't have a health and the bullets
17:24 - don't have a damage or anything like
17:25 - that yet we're just gonna have one shot
17:27 - kills them just good enough to start
17:30 - with okay and sure enough now the
17:35 - bullets killed a zombie
17:38 - okay well this video is gone really long
17:41 - it's getting harder and harder to keep
17:45 - them to my ten to fifteen minute limit I
17:48 - originally set because there's just so
17:50 - many things I want to do I got excited
17:51 - about doing the the shooting and I have
17:55 - more stuff that I didn't get a chance to
17:58 - yet that we'll do in the next video
17:59 - so hopefully you're enjoying it post
18:03 - your questions below please hit like on
18:05 - the video and subscribe and I will see
18:08 - you in the next one thanks
18:18 - you

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back to game development pi games this is part 9 of our tilebased topdown shooter game and in this video we're gonna actually start adding shooting so now that our Dom bees can chase us we need to give the player a way to fight back so we're going to add a bullet so over here in the settings I'm going to make some variables for the properties of our gun and so first we're gonna set up a bullet image and there is a bullet PNG that I pull it out of the kennyart pack which you can get at the link below it's just a little circular bullet and we're gonna set the bullet speed it's how fast the bullet will travel a little bit much faster than the player which moves at 300 and we're also gonna put a bullet lifetime and that's is this is gonna be how long the bullet lasts so if you fire a bullet it doesn't keep going forever it's going to disappear after 1000 milliseconds one second so now we can go over here to our sprites and we can start defining the sprite and I'm gonna make a little shortcut here I've created a shortcut to pasted in here we're gonna make a bullet and the bullet is going to need some information when it spawns we need to tell it where we want it to be position and what direction it needs to travel in and both of those will be vectors local location for where it will spawn and the direction that it will travel in and then the image is just going to be game dot bullet image which we need to load over in our load data there we are we'll just duplicate this and we will load the bullet image and that's going to be that's going to be the bullet image okay and while we're over here we'll also add a group we're going to want another group to put all of our bullets in okay so now okay so we have our bullets spawning our position is going to be that position that we passed in and we're gonna put our rectangle there our velocity is going to be that direction vector that we passed in which is going to be a direction vector is just a vector with a length of one alright just going to be a unit vector pointing the direction we want the bullet to travel so we need to multiply that by the bullet speed so we know which way to go and then we also need to track our spawn time that way we know when to delete the bullet okay and then the update is just going to be to move move at our velocity update our rectangle to that location and then if it's going to take get ticks spawn time if that is greater than the bullet life time then we delete the bullet okay so that's good enough for now let me fix this capital B here all right so there's our bullet all we need to know about our sprite it's gonna spawn and now we need to spawn it now we have all our key controls up here on our player for when the player is moving so we're just going to add another one here for K space oh and we need one more setting here actually we need a bullet rate this is going to be how often how fast we can shoot if we hold the spacebar down how fast did the bullets get produced we can make that faster slower for a machine gun effect and so on so we need to use that over here to tell whether it's time to shoot or not so we're gonna keep track of them when the last time we shot was all right if that's been long enough then we can spawn a bullet so we need to figure out what direction we're pointing in so we make a unit vector and we just rotate it at the players rotation and then we can spawn a bullet okay and we just pass it the game we pass it the position of the player and we pass it that direction that we just figured out and then we just need to go here and say last shot equals zero so we haven't shot yet when we spawn the player okay so let's try this out we're gonna shoot we have a small typo in our bullet we need to store our game reference so that we can use it down here all right now we're gonna try this out now watch what happens when I shoot well my player is flying right so I'm spawning a bullet but my player is flying at the bullet speed what is going on well here's what's happening so when we shoot when we fire we're telling we're sending our player's position to the bullet right and then the bullet is taking that position and changing it so we're basically using the same position for our player and our bullet so when we update our bullets position it also updates the player's position and that's no good we don't want to do that what we want to do is we want this to be a copy so the vector class you can just if you pass a vector into the vet command it makes a new vector that has the same that's equal to that but isn't the same vector right so if we run this now right now I can shoot I'm holding the button down I'm and you can see how the you can see how the bullets are timing out when they have gone traveled for one whole second right they don't go further than that but we probably don't want them to go through the walls either all right we probably want them to stop when they hit the walls so let's also put here in the bullets update we can use the sprite collide any function because I don't care what wall it hits if it hits any wall all right if it hits any wall then it should just get deleted so that's going to look like this okay so the bullet hits the wall it stops okay now what about making it well before we have it hit the zombie let's have a look at where the bullets spawning right the bullet it's coming out of the center of the player but I'd really like it to look like it's coming out of the gun so that means we need to offset the spawn of the bullet to where the barrel of the gun is relative to the center of the player right so as it turns it's always at the same position relative to the player it's to the player's right a little bit and forward from the center okay so I'm gonna go over here did the settings and I'm gonna make an offset so on the players sprite there's gonna be a barrel offset and this is gonna be a vector representing how far from the center of the sprite the barrel of the gun is and so this is gonna be a vector now we need to figure out exactly where that is and where it's going to look good right and so this is relative to the center so if we imagine the player is before the player rotates he's facing to the right so that means we're gonna want to move some positive number of pixels in the xdirection right just the bullet is forward of the player and it's also down some amount right so let's just move it 20 pixels forward and 20 pixels down or 20 pixels forward and twinkles to the right of the player and and we'll see if that's good enough we'll adjust it once we have it working okay but that also means that if I'm gonna have a vector in my in my settings file I'm going to have to define it here like we've done in the other files okay so we have our so we have our offset and we're going to adjust that but we need to use that over here when we spawn the bullet now what we're gonna do is we're gonna do it in our code where we shoot which was right here okay so when we spawn the bullet instead of sending the position of the player itself we need to add we need to add that offset so we're gonna say the position where we that we want is the player's position it's whatever the player's position is plus the barrel offset rotated to match the players rotation right that way it will be pointing in the direct right direction and then we send that that's the position that we're going to send to the bullet so let's see what that looks like and if we guess some good values for where a bullet will spawn well let's get out of the way of some of these looks like we're too far to the right and we could maybe go a little more forward right notice how it rotates as I move around and it'll always spawns 20 pixels over and 20 pixels forward so let's move it a little bit more let's move it a little bit more forward and a little bit less to the right let's see what that looks like well that looks much better okay so now it looks like the bullets are coming out of the gun when I shoot them and not spawning in midair or coming out of the player alright let's add one other thing to the bullets and that is I would like them to have I would like it to have a little bit of kickback and that means it's when you fire the gun it's gonna push the player back a little bit okay and the kickback is gonna be a speed that it's gonna push us backwards so let's make that let's try 200 and see how that looks so that means when we spawn the bullet here we also want to add we also want to modify the player's velocity so we spawn the bullet and we set the velocity equal to the kickback right in the negative direction also rotated at whatever the player is so now when I fire the gun it should push me backwards I'm gonna get out of the way of these zombies so we have a chance to see it yeah see how I get a little bit of zombies are annoying when you can't get rid of them get over here where they can't chase me let's see I get a little bit of a push backwards when I fire my gun okay so one other thing that would make the shooting look a little nicer is to give the gun a little bit of inaccuracy okay and what that means is every bullet isn't going to come out in a perfectly straight line there's going to be a spread some will go a little bit to the left a little bit to the right and this number will represent how many degrees to the left or right of straight that the bullet will travel so that means when we go over here to our sprites when we spawn the bullet we want to pick a random number between 5 and 5 and add that to our direction okay and so we're gonna take and we're gonna pick a random value and for this I don't want a random value that's an integer I don't want it to just be 5 4 3 2 and so on I want any number between minus 5 and plus 5 including any kind of real number so that means I can go up here and at the top from random I'm gonna import uniform and that's exactly what the uniform random command does is it gives you a real number back that's between your two bounds okay so spread is going to be a uniform between minus the gun spread and the gun spread okay so we go so we now have a random number somewhere between minus 5 and plus 5 so we just take our direction vector and we rotate it by that spread so it'll rotate a little bit to the left or a little bit to the right okay and what that's gonna do is let us see some spread let's see how the bullets are not all going in the same direction just to see it even more and we probably wouldn't want to do this but if you had a really bad inaccurate gun right you can see they're spraying out in all directions okay so that's perfect that's what we want to do so we're going to leave that at 5 so it's just a little bit of variety in there okay last but not least we want these bullets to kill the zombies now just to keep it simple right now we're gonna add in our update section we're just going to do a PG dot sprite that group collide all right we want to collide two groups the mobs group and the bullets group and what do we want to do well we want the we want the mobs that get hit we're going to put false and the bullets they get hit we're gonna put true so the bullets disappear when they into the zombie and the zombie does not disappear but what we're gonna do is for each of those hits we are just gonna say hit kill just for the moment because the mobs don't have a health and the bullets don't have a damage or anything like that yet we're just gonna have one shot kills them just good enough to start with okay and sure enough now the bullets killed a zombie okay well this video is gone really long it's getting harder and harder to keep them to my ten to fifteen minute limit I originally set because there's just so many things I want to do I got excited about doing the the shooting and I have more stuff that I didn't get a chance to yet that we'll do in the next video so hopefully you're enjoying it post your questions below please hit like on the video and subscribe and I will see you in the next one thanks you
