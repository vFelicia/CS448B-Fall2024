00:00 - welcome back to game development with
00:01 - pygame this is part 12 of our platformer
00:05 - development series and in this video we
00:08 - will be adding platformer graphics so
00:12 - now we're ready to change our platform
00:14 - to start using some of these graphics
00:16 - and I'm going to use this dirt and grass
00:20 - one and I'm gonna use both of the sizes
00:25 - there's a wide one and a narrow one so
00:29 - that means we're gonna have to make some
00:30 - changes to our platform sprite one of
00:34 - the changes is we are not going to need
00:36 - the width and height to be specified but
00:40 - we are going to pass a copy of the game
00:43 - like we did up here in class player so
00:47 - that we can reference the sprite sheet
00:48 - so we're gonna say soft a game of this
00:52 - game okay and then I'm gonna make a list
00:56 - of the two images that I want to use and
01:00 - I'm actually gonna I'm going to paste
01:03 - this in here cuz I've already gone and
01:04 - looked up these are the coordinates from
01:06 - the XML file if you want to use some
01:10 - different ones here or you even want to
01:12 - use more of them you can put more of
01:15 - them into this list because our image is
01:17 - just going to be a random choice from
01:21 - that list of images which means we're
01:23 - going to need to go up here I'm going to
01:24 - be important random so that we can say
01:28 - random dot choice images now since we're
01:34 - actually only using choice another way
01:36 - we could do this and you'll see this a
01:39 - lot in Python is we can just say from
01:42 - random import choice so that since
01:46 - that's the only command we're gonna be
01:47 - using
01:47 - we can just say choice and then we're
01:53 - not going to fill with green anymore but
01:55 - we do need to set the color key to black
02:00 - just like we did with the other sprites
02:02 - so that will do it for class platform
02:06 - but now our problem is going to be over
02:09 - here where we
02:12 - and knew where we spawn the platform's
02:17 - okay so we know we're gonna need to pass
02:19 - a copy of the game but now we're getting
02:23 - our list of coordinates from our
02:26 - platform list here which has X Y width
02:30 - and height nip the width and height are
02:32 - going to be invalid now because we don't
02:35 - have that many options in our sprite so
02:41 - I'm gonna take out these width and
02:43 - Heights so that we don't have them in
02:49 - there okay now if we go over here we
02:52 - should see oh I forgot there's one other
02:58 - place where we spawn platforms and
03:00 - that's if there's any of the need to be
03:02 - spawned up above the top so that one
03:05 - again we're also going to take out the
03:08 - width and height and we are gonna add in
03:12 - that we want to pass the game so now I
03:17 - should see this yes and now we're
03:19 - spawning some new platforms that we can
03:26 - see so much nicer now now notice how
03:35 - when I'm up here I jump to a higher
03:39 - platform the screen isn't always
03:43 - scrolling the way I wanted to see if I
03:46 - can get that to happen a good example
03:50 - there we go see I was on this platform
03:55 - and I snapped up to this one but the
03:59 - screen isn't scrolling because my
04:01 - velocity right now is zero if I jump a
04:04 - little bit it's gonna snap down there so
04:06 - we'd like to make that a little more
04:07 - smooth so what we can do here is in this
04:13 - section right here where we detect
04:15 - whether we need to scroll the screen
04:17 - we're moving everything at the players
04:20 - velocity but since I snapped up to that
04:22 - platform at my velocity is zero so
04:25 - that's why we're not screw
04:27 - so what we're gonna do is we're going to
04:29 - say use the max function and I'm gonna
04:33 - say use either that or the number two so
04:38 - whichever number is bigger the players
04:40 - velocity or two it's going to scroll at
04:44 - and we can do that here for the moving
04:50 - of the platforms too and what that's
04:52 - gonna do is give us a little let's get a
04:56 - little snap to happen so you might
05:03 - notice even when the player snaps up
05:07 - there and the players not moving anymore
05:09 - the screen will scroll for us at a nice
05:17 - little steady pace and I think that's
05:21 - okay for now we can definitely improve
05:24 - that but that can wait all right a
05:30 - couple of other things you might be
05:32 - noticing one is responding up here at
05:36 - the top and I'd like to spawn down here
05:38 - at my first platform which might be a
05:41 - big one might be a small one I actually
05:44 - want to move it up a little bit too
05:45 - because they can't see the bottom of it
05:46 - so what we're gonna do is we're gonna go
05:49 - over here to our settings we're gonna
05:51 - change this first platform to move it up
05:56 - just a little bit - 50 let's see what
06:00 - that looks like yeah there may be
06:04 - slightly more
06:14 - there we go okay so I'd like the player
06:17 - I like the player to spawn on that
06:22 - platform down here so I just want to
06:26 - change the player sprites spawn location
06:30 - so in here we're spawning at the center
06:33 - of the screen right now so we're gonna
06:36 - make this I'm just picking what I think
06:42 - is going to be a reasonable number we'll
06:47 - see what that looks like when I run it
06:56 - what do we do there oh right I need to
07:04 - do that in the position not because the
07:12 - position is where we're gonna get set to
07:14 - anyway so there we go so a we spawn down
07:20 - here on top of things and that's okay
07:23 - now another thing you might notice if
07:26 - you're playing around is occasionally
07:27 - the jump doesn't seem to work you'll
07:31 - press it and a jump won't happen and the
07:35 - reason that's happening is well there's
07:40 - a couple of things that have to do with
07:41 - it but one thing we can do to make that
07:43 - a little more reliable is if we go to
07:45 - our players jump method here I'm gonna
07:51 - change these numbers to two so instead
07:55 - of checking the pixel right below us
07:58 - we're gonna check two pixels below us
08:01 - before we jump and that's gonna make it
08:02 - a little more reliable reliably detect
08:06 - the platform underneath the players feet
08:09 - okay now we are still snapping to these
08:16 - platforms quite a lot especially you
08:21 - might have noticed
08:25 - also sometimes we're behind the
08:27 - platforms there's a lot of little things
08:29 - to clean up now that we've changed
08:30 - things so let's clean up a couple of
08:32 - them and then we'll be done for this
08:34 - video one thing I want to do is here in
08:39 - my draw section so I'm actually going to
08:42 - make sure I want to make sure the player
08:44 - is on top so I'm gonna actually blitt
08:48 - the player on top of the rest of the
08:56 - sprites that way the the player will
08:58 - always be in the front okay so we should
09:03 - never see the player disappear or hide
09:07 - behind a platform okay now we have we're
09:16 - gonna have to decide what to do about
09:18 - some of this interaction with the booth
09:21 - platforms right I mean like this example
09:23 - if I walked to the right and I snap up
09:26 - to the top of it that's okay but some of
09:29 - these situations like should I snap to
09:33 - the top there or should I not go until I
09:36 - jump and what about when the platforms
09:39 - are right on top of each other like this
09:40 - you know you're gonna get it sometimes I
09:43 - snap something they don't it's a little
09:45 - bit inconsistent wasn't so much a
09:49 - problem when they were a little
09:50 - rectangles because it's hard to tell
09:58 - but sometimes it looks a little weird
10:00 - okay and that's okay because we can fix
10:06 - that and we can do some more smarter
10:12 - things about our collisions but that's
10:14 - going to wait for a later video we've
10:17 - already gone over a little over ten
10:19 - minutes so we're gonna stop there for
10:22 - today
10:22 - and I will see you in the next video if
10:27 - you have any questions or comments
10:29 - please post them in the discussion area
10:30 - below and also please click like on the
10:34 - video that actually helps other people
10:36 - find it and get the word out
10:38 - thanks a lot and I'll see you next time
10:47 - you
