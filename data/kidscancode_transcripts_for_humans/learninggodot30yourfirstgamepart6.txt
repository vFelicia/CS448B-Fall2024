00:00 - welcome to part 6 of learning Godot in
00:03 - this video we're gonna look at a few
00:05 - extra things you might want to add to
00:06 - the game to make it a little bit more
00:08 - appealing if you followed along with the
00:10 - previous steps you have a working game
00:12 - and you can dodge the enemies staying
00:16 - alive as long as you can until one hits
00:19 - you and everything works great but it's
00:22 - a little drab and not very exciting and
00:25 - so this video is going to cover some
00:27 - things you can do to spice it up a
00:28 - little bit and make the game look nicer
00:30 - and the first thing we could do is
00:32 - replace this default gray background
00:35 - which is kind of drab and one way we
00:38 - could do that is by adding a color rect
00:42 - that's a rectangle that will display a
00:46 - solid color pretty straightforward we're
00:48 - gonna drag that and cover up everything
00:50 - now if we leave it here the nodes are
00:53 - drawn in order so that means the color
00:55 - Rictor is gonna be drawn on top of our
00:57 - player so we won't be able to see them
00:59 - so we're gonna put that at the top of
01:01 - the stack so that we can see the player
01:04 - and I'm going to name this background
01:07 - and in the color Rex
01:10 - inspector properties you just click here
01:12 - to pick a color so let's see let's pick
01:14 - a maybe we're underwater we'll take a
01:17 - bluish color let's see how that looks
01:27 - and there we go
01:32 - if instead you had a texture an image
01:35 - that you wanted to use there you could
01:37 - use a texture rect which does the same
01:40 - kind of thing as the color rect it just
01:43 - displays a texture and it can do things
01:46 - like tiling and stretching and things
01:47 - like that if you have a particular image
01:49 - you want to use and you want to make it
01:51 - fit on the screen so that's the
01:53 - background the next big thing we could
01:55 - do is add some sound to this game in
01:58 - your art folder there are two sounds
02:02 - that we can use there's a game over WAV
02:04 - file that's something we want to play
02:06 - when the player dies and then there's an
02:08 - OGG file that's a bit of background
02:10 - music we can play during gameplay to
02:13 - give us an atmosphere so what we want to
02:15 - do is have those working in our main so
02:19 - in main we're gonna add two audio stream
02:22 - player nodes so I'm just gonna add one
02:28 - and then duplicate it now this first one
02:31 - is going to be our game over sound I'm
02:34 - gonna call it the death sound and right
02:38 - here for stream we want to load from our
02:44 - art file the GAMEOVER wav file and you
02:49 - can try it out if you hit playing
02:52 - you can hear it play and so we want to
02:55 - trigger that playing when the game is
02:56 - over so if we go to our mains script
03:00 - then on game over that's where we want
03:04 - to have it happen
03:06 - so we can just add here death sound dot
03:11 - play and that should make it play that
03:15 - sound when we run into something
03:24 - okay and then the second audio stream
03:28 - player is going to be our music and
03:31 - we'll load that OGG file and now we want
03:37 - to go back to our script and we want to
03:39 - start playing that music when the game
03:41 - starts so in the new game function we're
03:44 - going to tell it to play the music and
03:49 - in the game over we're going to add that
03:55 - we want it to stop so we want to stop
03:57 - playing the music when the game ends now
04:01 - when you import an OGG file I click on
04:05 - this and go up to the import tab it
04:08 - should be set to loop automatically make
04:11 - sure that's set because that way when it
04:12 - reaches the end of the music clip it'll
04:14 - automatically start playing it again so
04:16 - let's try that out now and there's our
04:26 - background music playing and when I get
04:29 - hit it stops the next effect we're going
04:34 - to add is I would like the player to
04:37 - have a bit of a trail behind him when he
04:40 - moves and to do that we're going to use
04:42 - a particle node so it's called the
04:44 - particles 2d and I'm going to name that
04:49 - trail now when you create a particle 2d
04:53 - you get an error message because it
04:55 - needs a material attached to a process
04:58 - of particles and we'll get to that in a
05:00 - second but first we're gonna look at the
05:02 - properties here in the inspector
05:04 - emitting whether or not the particles
05:07 - are coming out the number that you want
05:10 - I'm gonna set that to 10 under time
05:16 - we're gonna leave these as they are
05:21 - actually we might up the speed scale a
05:24 - little bit we'll see how it looks
05:25 - setting up particles also requires a bit
05:28 - of trial and error there's a lot of
05:29 - settings a lot of different ways you can
05:30 - make it look and so you can experiment
05:32 - and get a huge number of different
05:35 - effects out of it now here under
05:39 - textures we're gonna use the player's
05:40 - texture so I'm gonna grab the player
05:44 - texture and I'm gonna stick it there now
05:46 - it's showing up there because our
05:48 - remember our texture is really big we
05:51 - when we drew the player we shrunk him
05:54 - down and we're gonna take care of that
05:56 - in the particles material but here it's
05:59 - also showing on top of my player so I'm
06:02 - gonna go down to the visibility and I'm
06:05 - gonna check the show behind parent that
06:09 - way the trail will look like it's coming
06:10 - up from behind the player not from on
06:12 - top of it all right now we need to
06:15 - animate these particles and have them do
06:17 - something and that's done with this
06:20 - process material so if you click the
06:23 - arrow here you can create a shader if
06:25 - you're familiar with writing shaders you
06:27 - can write a shader to do this but we're
06:29 - gonna use a particles material and now
06:32 - all of a sudden we've got some particles
06:34 - dropping down because by default the
06:36 - particles have gravity on them and they
06:38 - just fall down so
06:39 - we're gonna have to change that around
06:40 - so click on the material and now you
06:43 - have a huge list of properties that you
06:48 - can tweak and adjust for this but we
06:51 - definitely want to take gravity and set
06:53 - it to zero so that those things stop
06:56 - falling we want to take our scale and
07:01 - the scale is what we're going to want to
07:02 - change we want it to we want them to
07:04 - start out the size of the player or
07:07 - maybe a little bit smaller and then
07:08 - shrink from there so what we're gonna do
07:11 - is make a scale curve so I'm gonna click
07:13 - down here here arrow here and say new
07:15 - curve texture click on that and now I
07:18 - have this curve that I can draw and I
07:21 - want it to start around just under 0.5
07:24 - because that's the scale that we set our
07:26 - player to and I want it to end up down
07:30 - around 0 or so okay and now we can't see
07:37 - them because they're appearing behind
07:38 - the player and then shrinking but that's
07:42 - ok we're gonna make them show they're
07:44 - gonna show up when we move now I'm gonna
07:46 - hit the back arrow here to get back to
07:48 - the particles material I also want them
07:51 - to fade out so I'm gonna make a color
07:54 - ramp here so a new gradient texture I
07:58 - click on that for the gradient I want a
08:01 - new gradient and I click on that and now
08:04 - down here are the colors that we're
08:08 - gonna go between so it's starting with
08:11 - black and going to white well what I
08:14 - want to do is click on that first square
08:16 - I don't need to move it and I'm gonna
08:19 - click on what color and I want to start
08:21 - out white that starts out being the
08:24 - original color no change to the color
08:27 - but we are gonna fade it a little bit so
08:29 - we're going to start it around there say
08:32 - and then the ending color is going to be
08:39 - also white but with the Alpha all the
08:42 - way down because we want to basically
08:45 - look like it's fading out and so now
08:49 - we're ready to try it out let's see
08:53 - we have all the settings the way we want
08:55 - them well let's try it out and see what
08:58 - happens
08:59 - oh I know what happened we don't see
09:08 - them because we have to let them stream
09:11 - out behind the player so we're gonna go
09:13 - to the trail and in drawing we're gonna
09:18 - uncheck local coordinates we don't want
09:21 - the part of us to stay attached to the
09:23 - player we want them to stream out behind
09:25 - him so if I move the player around
09:26 - actually you can see the trail right
09:30 - there and the editor going behind it as
09:31 - it moves all right now that should do
09:35 - better there we go now we have a little
09:43 - trail coming out behind us now if you
09:47 - want to get fancier with this we're
09:50 - always using the same texture so it does
09:52 - look a little odd that the facing to the
09:55 - right texture comes out when we move in
09:57 - other directions it also continues to
10:00 - emit when we're standing still so if we
10:03 - happen to stand still on a frame where
10:05 - our
10:07 - pose isn't the same we're gonna see it
10:10 - and so a couple things we can do about
10:12 - that I've just gone into the players
10:14 - script and I've added two commands here
10:17 - I've added two set emitting to true when
10:21 - we're moving and set emitting to false
10:23 - when we stop moving on the trail and
10:26 - that's gonna look a little better when
10:28 - you let go the key and stop moving if I
10:34 - stop for example like that you don't see
10:37 - any particles coming out behind the
10:40 - character the possibilities for
10:42 - particles are pretty much endless and
10:45 - way more than we could go into for this
10:48 - video but hopefully that inspires you
10:50 - with some ideas you could also do things
10:52 - like bubbles coming up from the bottom
10:54 - if you want to continue the underwater
10:56 - theme you could put it in space and have
10:59 - flickering stars in the background you
11:03 - could add some trails or effects to the
11:05 - enemies as well hopefully that gives you
11:08 - some ideas as well thank you for
11:10 - watching and good luck in your future
11:12 - good-o projects

just displays a texture and it can do things like tiling and stretching and things like that if you have a particular image you want to use and you want to make it fit on the screen so that's the background the next big thing we could do is add some sound to this game in your art folder there are two sounds that we can use there's a game over WAV file that's something we want to play when the player dies and then there's an OGG file that's a bit of background music we can play during gameplay to give us an atmosphere so what we want to do is have those working in our main so in main we're gonna add two audio stream player nodes so I'm just gonna add one and then duplicate it now this first one is going to be our game over sound I'm gonna call it the death sound and right here for stream we want to load from our art file the GAMEOVER wav file and you can try it out if you hit playing you can hear it play and so we want to trigger that playing when the game is over so if we go to our mains script then on game over that's where we want to have it happen so we can just add here death sound dot play and that should make it play that sound when we run into something okay and then the second audio stream player is going to be our music and we'll load that OGG file and now we want to go back to our script and we want to start playing that music when the game starts so in the new game function we're going to tell it to play the music and in the game over we're going to add that we want it to stop so we want to stop playing the music when the game ends now when you import an OGG file I click on this and go up to the import tab it should be set to loop automatically make sure that's set because that way when it reaches the end of the music clip it'll automatically start playing it again so let's try that out now and there's our background music playing and when I get hit it stops the next effect we're going to add is I would like the player to have a bit of a trail behind him when he moves and to do that we're going to use a particle node so it's called the particles 2d and I'm going to name that trail now when you create a particle 2d you
