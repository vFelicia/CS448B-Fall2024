00:00 - welcome to learning to code with Python
00:01 - I'm Chris Bradfield and I'll be your
00:03 - instructor for this series these videos
00:06 - are intended for students ages 11 to 14
00:08 - or about grades 5 to 8 if you're younger
00:11 - than that you can still give it a try
00:12 - but you might want to get help from an
00:14 - adult we're going to be doing a lot of
00:15 - typing before we get started make sure
00:19 - you've already installed Python on your
00:20 - computer if you haven't stopped the
00:23 - video now and click on the link below
00:24 - for instructions you will probably need
00:27 - to get your parents help for that part
00:28 - if you have any questions about this
00:31 - lesson or any other lessons click on
00:33 - asking for help under the video that's
00:35 - the best way if you leave a comment on
00:37 - youtube I might not see it or you might
00:40 - not see my answer before we start coding
00:43 - let's talk a little bit about what it
00:44 - means what is a program what do computer
00:47 - programmers do well put simply a program
00:52 - is just a detailed set of instructions
00:54 - telling the computer what you want it to
00:56 - do many people think of computers is
00:58 - being smart but really they're very dumb
01:00 - when you see a computer doing something
01:02 - that seems really smart it's because a
01:04 - smart programmer wrote the code to make
01:06 - the computer act that way without any
01:08 - programs all of our fancy phones and
01:10 - tablets and even Mars exploring robots
01:12 - would just sit there and do nothing so
01:16 - now we know we're going to be giving
01:17 - instructions to the computer but how do
01:19 - we do that well just like people around
01:21 - the world speak many different languages
01:23 - there are lots of different programming
01:24 - languages you can use to talk to the
01:26 - computer these are just a few popular
01:28 - ones you may have heard of some of them
01:31 - the language we're going to use in this
01:33 - class is called Python some languages
01:36 - are more difficult to learn than others
01:38 - and I really like Python is a good one
01:40 - to learn for beginners you can think
01:42 - about programming languages like tools
01:44 - in a toolbox some tools are good for
01:46 - some jobs like a hammer is good for
01:48 - driving nails but not so good at other
01:50 - jobs you wouldn't use the hammer to cut
01:52 - a piece of wood python is what's called
01:55 - a general-purpose language that means
01:57 - you can make all kinds of different
01:58 - programs with it python is used to make
02:01 - websites to program robots to do science
02:04 - experiments and to build games all right
02:07 - let's open up the program called idle
02:09 - that installed on our computer when we
02:11 - installed Python
02:13 - you should see a window that looks like
02:14 - this this is called the Python shell a
02:17 - shell is just a window where you can
02:20 - type commands and then see what happens
02:22 - do you see these greater than signs
02:25 - that's called the prompt that means
02:28 - that's where the computer is waiting for
02:30 - you to type something so let's go ahead
02:33 - and try our first Python command when
02:40 - you're finished typing the command press
02:42 - Enter
02:43 - to see what happens now remember you
02:47 - need to type exactly what you see the
02:49 - computer is not smart and it can't
02:51 - figure out what you meant to type so if
02:53 - you make a mistake the computer is just
02:55 - going to be confused so what did we just
02:58 - do here we gave the computer a command
03:01 - called print that means that we want it
03:05 - to print something to the screen and
03:06 - then we gave it some stuff in
03:08 - parenthesis which is what we wanted it
03:11 - to print the technical term for the
03:14 - stuff in the parenthesis is arguments
03:17 - most of our commands are going to look
03:19 - something like this a command and then
03:21 - some arguments and parentheses
03:30 - congratulations you're now a computer
03:32 - programmer everything from here on is
03:35 - going to be about learning more commands
03:37 - and how to combine them to create
03:40 - programs to do what we want the computer
03:42 - to do now before we go on I want to talk
03:47 - a little bit more about working in the
03:48 - Python shell what happens if we make a
03:51 - mistake you see I spelled print wrong
03:59 - what do you think is going to happen
04:00 - some of you might have seen this already
04:04 - we get some scary red text complaining
04:08 - about an error don't get too worried
04:12 - when you see red text like this
04:14 - Computers just trying to tell you that
04:16 - it's confused because you told it to do
04:18 - something it doesn't understand now at
04:23 - this
04:23 - right you might want to go back up here
04:25 - and try changing what you typed before
04:27 - to fix your problem and you'll find that
04:30 - you can't that's because you can think
04:32 - of these lines up here as the past
04:35 - they're the things that you've done
04:37 - already and the computer is done with
04:39 - them we can only type down here at our
04:42 - last prompt where the computer is ready
04:45 - to see what we want to do next all right
04:52 - that's it for lesson one in the next
04:55 - lesson we'll learn some commands to draw
04:56 - graphics on the screen see you next time
