00:00 - welcome back to game development with
00:02 - pygame this is part 8 of our mop game
00:06 - and in this video we're going to learn
00:08 - how to add sound effects and music so if
00:15 - we want to add sounds to our game we
00:16 - need to find some sounds that we would
00:19 - like to use there's all sorts of ways to
00:21 - get sounds open game art is a great
00:25 - place for all sorts of different sound
00:26 - effects just like it is for art but what
00:30 - I'm going to show you today is this
00:33 - website called bfx are.net now this is a
00:36 - really awesome tool for generating your
00:38 - own sound effects it looks a little
00:41 - scary at first don't worry about all
00:43 - these sliders and things because we
00:44 - don't really need to do much with them
00:46 - or we can play around with them later
00:48 - but what we can do is with these buttons
00:50 - over here by clicking them you'll
00:53 - generate a random sound of that type so
00:56 - for example this shoot one every time I
01:00 - click it it's gonna get another random
01:03 - shooting kind of sound so like this
01:07 - first one that I did see how it lists
01:09 - them down here so it just keeps adding
01:10 - to this list so you can go back and find
01:11 - the ones I made so if you don't like one
01:14 - you can get rid of it if you like one
01:16 - you can keep it here in your in your
01:17 - list to use later you can even change
01:21 - its name here okay
01:24 - and so clicking over here you can play
01:28 - it again and all these little sliders
01:31 - are just different ways to modify that
01:33 - sound you know maybe the frequency you
01:37 - want it higher pixel now it's higher
01:40 - pitched or you want it lower pitched
01:42 - that's too low you know and you can play
01:47 - around with all sorts of different
01:50 - settings do you get it the way you like
01:52 - it we are going to need a shooting sound
01:58 - for our ship when it shoots its laser
02:00 - and we're also going to need an
02:02 - explosion kind of sound for when the
02:06 - meteor gets blown up so as you hear
02:09 - there's also two different kinds of
02:11 - explosions you can get
02:13 - and this can be endless fun you can play
02:15 - around to this for a long time when you
02:19 - have found a sound you like that you
02:22 - want to keep like so for example this
02:25 - laser you just click on export wave
02:29 - don't click on save to disk it's not
02:31 - going to save it in the right file
02:33 - format for pygame to be able to use but
02:36 - if we do export WAV WAV is a file format
02:42 - a way of saving the file that pygame
02:44 - will be able to read so you just click
02:46 - on export wave and save it however you
02:49 - like with whatever name you like don't
02:52 - forget the name because you're gonna
02:53 - need to use that name to load it into
02:55 - your game so I've done that and I have
03:00 - created in my folder just like we
03:03 - created the IMG folder to hold the
03:05 - images I've created an snd folder to
03:08 - hold the sound and I've put in there two
03:12 - different explosion sounds I found two
03:14 - that I liked that one and that one which
03:18 - is a little deeper and I'm gonna have
03:20 - just to have a little variety
03:22 - every time I meteor blows up it's going
03:24 - to randomly pick one of these sounds
03:27 - okay and then I also have a pew pew
03:31 - sound for shooting my gun that's nice
03:34 - and short and then I have this this is
03:38 - something different this is music so
03:41 - this is a some background music that I
03:44 - want to play be playing in the
03:47 - background of my game and I got this
03:49 - song off of open game art and you can
03:52 - find the link below if you look for it
03:56 - or if you want to use a different piece
03:58 - of music you'll be able to do that as
04:00 - well now we can start working on the
04:05 - code to get the sound working and the
04:08 - first thing I wanted to discuss was if
04:11 - you go over to the open game art page
04:15 - for this piece of music this is the one
04:17 - that I had downloaded the
04:20 - artist has placed in the description
04:24 - here something called attribution
04:26 - instructions and that means he's asking
04:29 - that in exchange for using his music for
04:32 - free that you follow these instructions
04:34 - which are he would like this little bit
04:37 - of text saying that he's the one who
04:40 - made it to be placed somewhere in your
04:43 - game so I'm gonna just copy that and
04:45 - paste it up here at the top as he asked
04:51 - now for the art we used Kenny didn't
04:54 - actually doesn't actually require you to
04:56 - do anything he actually says you can do
04:58 - whatever you want with my art it doesn't
05:00 - hurt though to be friendly and put that
05:05 - it's from Kenny and I'm gonna go ahead
05:08 - and put that there since we're doing
05:10 - attributions right now okay so now we
05:16 - need to add a little bit to use our
05:21 - sound folder just like we did with the
05:24 - image folder we're gonna just figure out
05:27 - the path to that so we'll be able to
05:30 - reference or look up those files that
05:33 - are in that SMD folder so let's start by
05:39 - going down to our here where we're
05:46 - loading all the game graphics well we
05:48 - also need to load all the game sounds
05:52 - okay oh and by the way remember if you
05:57 - remember back when we first made this
05:59 - template we put PI game mixer dot init
06:02 - in here this is the thing that starts
06:03 - the sound sound system if you don't have
06:05 - this line then you will not be able to
06:08 - play sound so we put that in ahead of
06:11 - time if you don't have that make sure
06:13 - you add that back in right after PI game
06:15 - dot in it okay so we're gonna load our
06:19 - game sounds now we want to do that by
06:21 - using the same basically that's the same
06:24 - kind of process as when you load
06:26 - graphics there's a command to load that
06:29 - graphics or that sound file and then
06:31 - there's going to be a command to play
06:32 - that sound file whenever we
06:34 - so for example for a pew pew sound our
06:40 - oops our shoot our shoot sound okay
06:45 - that's gonna be PI game dot mixer dot
06:50 - sound with a capital S and then you just
06:54 - put what file you want to look at so
06:56 - we're gonna say path that join sound snd
07:02 - comma and I called my in peww a V so you
07:07 - can put whatever the file name of your
07:08 - sound you want is and that's our shoot
07:11 - sound and if we go up to our player in
07:16 - our def shoot is when we spawn a bullet
07:19 - so if we want to make play the sound
07:24 - whenever we spawn a bullet then we're
07:26 - just gonna say shoot sound dot play as
07:32 - simple as that
07:33 - let's give it a try now I've got some
07:39 - nice few sounds whenever I shoot now
07:53 - that we know that works we can add our
07:54 - explosion sounds and for the explosions
07:58 - remember I had two different explosion
08:02 - sounds that I wanted to use so I'm gonna
08:05 - make a list called explosion sounds
08:09 - that's going to hold all of them and
08:13 - then I'm just going to say for I'm just
08:16 - going to do a list of both of these the
08:18 - xpl 3 wav and expl expl 6 WAV or what
08:29 - those happen to be named okay so for
08:33 - each of those I'm just going to load
08:36 - them and stick them into that list so
08:39 - dot append and what I'm appending is
08:43 - pygame mixer dot sound path join
08:50 - each of these things so then I'll have a
08:53 - list of just both of those and then I
08:56 - have so then I have that explosion sound
08:59 - so now up here or sorry down here when
09:01 - we actually destroy a mob when we
09:06 - destroy the mob we want to play a random
09:10 - sound out of that list so we can just
09:15 - say random dot choice expl sounds make a
09:23 - random choice of the explosion sounds
09:25 - and play it and that should let us see
09:29 - or sorry hear that's gonna work really
09:43 - well when we have explosions and not
09:46 - just disappearing meteors last but not
09:53 - least we need our background music I'm
09:57 - just gonna add a whole lot of
09:58 - personality to the game and we do that
10:01 - by it's slightly different than the way
10:03 - sounds work because this is music that
10:05 - we want playing continuously in the
10:06 - background so we say mixer music load
10:11 - and then we have to say what what file
10:15 - we want so path join sound sound folder
10:22 - and then the file name which happens to
10:24 - be kind of long if you recall so I'm
10:28 - just going to copy and paste that in
10:33 - there that's the name of the file now it
10:38 - just so happens that when I first tried
10:41 - this sound out the music was pretty loud
10:43 - and it was a lot louder than the sound
10:45 - of the other sound effects so I'm gonna
10:49 - take the music and also do a command
10:53 - called set dot music set volume and
10:59 - lets us set the volume to a lower level
11:02 - so I'm going to set it to point four so
11:04 - I wanted to be background music and I
11:05 - want to be able to hear it but I don't
11:06 - want it to be louder than everything
11:09 - else in the game later on when we have a
11:13 - menu we can have the players can choose
11:16 - what setting they want and then we'll be
11:18 - able to change it there so now we've
11:20 - loaded the music we want to start
11:23 - playing it we want to start playing it
11:24 - right before the game loop starts so we
11:28 - could put that right here right before
11:30 - the game loop starts and just say PI
11:34 - game mixer music dot play and then the
11:40 - parentheses you can set things like
11:42 - whether you want if you add for example
11:46 - a playlist you wanted to play one time
11:48 - then play a different song whether you
11:50 - want it to loop and how many times you
11:52 - want it to loop and so on I'm gonna say
11:55 - we want to put loops equal negative one
11:58 - and that is an option that that tells PI
12:03 - game to loop it every time it reaches
12:05 - the end of the of the music it's going
12:07 - to loop around to the start again
12:08 - and it's just going to keep doing that
12:09 - over and over again so however long we
12:12 - play the music will continue to loop
12:14 - okay and now you should have some nice
12:23 - you
12:35 - you
