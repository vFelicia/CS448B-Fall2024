00:00 - welcome back this is part 2 of the Godot
00:02 - top-down tank battle game in part 1 we
00:05 - made the player tank and added some
00:07 - controls to it and in this part we're
00:09 - going to talk about making the terrain
00:11 - that we will drive around on top of in
00:16 - the last video we created the player
00:18 - tank which can drive around using the
00:20 - WASD keys and has a turret that points
00:24 - towards the mouse pointer at all times
00:27 - this time what we're going to talk about
00:29 - is how to make the map the the level
00:32 - that the tank is going to drive around
00:33 - on in your assets folder there is a
00:36 - terrain tile set which looks like this
00:39 - that's made up of a bunch of 128 by 128
00:43 - tiles that are just laid out in a grid
00:46 - like this and we want to use these in a
00:50 - tile map node so that we can draw our
00:53 - level however we want to draw it using
00:55 - these individual tiles now if you know
01:00 - how tile maps work you have to create
01:02 - individual sprites out of each of these
01:04 - squares and you can optionally attach
01:07 - collisions to them which we don't need
01:09 - for the ground but you put those all
01:11 - together and then you convert that into
01:14 - a tile set which is a good resource
01:17 - object and then you use that in your
01:19 - tile map to draw everything now since
01:23 - these are all pretty much identical
01:25 - they're all squares and they're laid out
01:28 - in a regular grid rather than cut them
01:32 - up one by one and make these one by one
01:34 - which is going to be kind of tedious I
01:36 - thought that I would make a script that
01:38 - will just parse this image and convert
01:43 - it into a tile set directly so how do we
01:45 - do that well I'm going to make a new
01:46 - scene and I'm just gonna get a node as
01:50 - its root I'm just going to call this
01:53 - tile set maker and I'm going to save
01:57 - this in a terrain folder
02:02 - now to the scene I'm gonna add a sprite
02:08 - and in the texture I'm going to put the
02:12 - asset image now this I'm doing it this
02:18 - way because this scene I can reuse this
02:21 - in any texture I put in the sprite node
02:23 - he's gonna get sliced up by the script
02:25 - so I suspect later on we'll have some
02:29 - more images that we want to add or some
02:32 - more details we want to add to the map
02:33 - and we might need to use another tile
02:36 - set in here so we can reuse this script
02:39 - so we're gonna add a script to the tile
02:41 - set maker node and what this is gonna do
02:48 - is look at that texture slice it up into
02:52 - 128 528 chunks and stick them into a
02:55 - tile set object and then save that so
03:00 - what we need to do is we need to
03:01 - configure the tile size so that we know
03:04 - what size we need 2 slice this up into
03:08 - so 128 528 is the size of the drawings
03:12 - and the texture that we're going to use
03:17 - is the sprites texture and then we can
03:23 - just do everything in the ready so that
03:25 - when we run the scene it'll do it and
03:27 - we'll be done so first we need to get
03:30 - the size of the image so the texture
03:35 - width is going to be the get width and
03:41 - then we're going to divide by the tile
03:44 - size X so that means if I'm you know 10
03:48 - tiles wide it'll be the texture size of
03:52 - the texture divided by 128 should come
03:54 - out to 10 and then text height is the
03:56 - same get height over a tile size dot Y
04:08 - then we need to make a new tileset image
04:11 - or it's sorry a new tileset object we do
04:15 - that with the new constructor so now I
04:17 - have a new tileset called TS and now I
04:19 - just need to iterate through however
04:22 - many tiles there are so I count two text
04:26 - width and I run Y from zero to text
04:33 - height and then I'll have a loop to go
04:39 - through everything now the region we
04:41 - want to split up that we're sorry we
04:44 - want to slice out of that texture is the
04:46 - rectangle from x times tile size X comma
04:56 - Y times tile size dot Y and then the
05:01 - width is put this over here tile size
05:07 - dot X so I'll size dot Y so then we have
05:15 - our region that we are cutting out of
05:17 - the texture now when we put this into
05:21 - the tile set it needs to be assigned an
05:23 - ID an ID is just a unique number an
05:26 - integer assigned to each tile so we need
05:29 - to come up with a unique ID and I'm just
05:33 - going to do X plus y times 10 and
05:35 - that'll be that'll make sure every tiles
05:38 - ID is unique to its position so then on
05:42 - our tile set we create a tile with that
05:44 - ID and then we say tile set texture of
05:52 - that ID to the texture and then tile set
05:57 - region will use the rectangle okay and
06:06 - so now when this loop is done I will
06:08 - have every tile created so at the end we
06:13 - can use resource saver to save the image
06:17 - and we're going to save it
06:19 - in the terrains sorry terrain folder I'm
06:24 - gonna call it terrain tiles GREs we save
06:30 - that that object so this saves resource
06:34 - saver will save any kind of any resource
06:36 - type object which tileset is and you
06:40 - just give it the location and filename
06:42 - so that's it so now when we open up the
06:45 - terrain folder here so you can see if I
06:47 - run this script when I close it I now
06:52 - have a Chow resource here in my terrains
06:55 - folder so I'll close that we can use
06:58 - that again later if we ever need it to
07:00 - slice up another image and we're gonna
07:03 - make a new folder now to be our level
07:07 - the the map that we're going to start
07:10 - with now eventually we might make more
07:11 - but we're gonna start with just one so
07:13 - I'm gonna use a node 2d for the root and
07:17 - I'm just gonna call this map oh one just
07:23 - since it's gonna be the first one we'll
07:25 - see how it goes I still not a hundred
07:27 - percent finalized on how I'm gonna
07:29 - design these maps so I'm kind of playing
07:32 - it by ear right now I know I'm going to
07:33 - use a tile map node to be the terrain so
07:39 - in that time app node we need to put our
07:41 - resource that we made and there's all
07:43 - our tiles showing up alright soo mout so
07:47 - I'm here we need to change the cell size
07:50 - defaults to 64 and these tiles are 128
07:54 - and now we've got our tile set working
08:00 - and we can you know go out here and draw
08:03 - stuff and everything looks fine
08:06 - so we want to draw some kind of level
08:08 - don't worry about this size right this
08:11 - is the the game window is showing right
08:13 - here so the map can be much larger than
08:16 - the game window because we'll we'll
08:18 - attach a camera to the player so that
08:20 - they can scroll them up as they run
08:22 - around so feel free to draw your map out
08:24 - however you want I'm gonna put some
08:25 - roads some various roads going around
08:27 - different places and I'll skip over the
08:31 - boring drawing part
08:32 - okay so here's a quick map I drew up
08:34 - just made some roads going around got a
08:36 - highway running down in the middle I
08:39 - used a little bit of the sand tiles I'm
08:43 - a little bit of the grass because we
08:44 - have the nice transition tiles between
08:46 - them and you know that's fine for now I
08:49 - named this ground because one of the
08:51 - useful things you can do with time apps
08:53 - is you can layer them and have
08:55 - additional tile maps on top of this one
08:57 - that you know place your trees or rocks
09:00 - or buildings or whatever and we'll
09:03 - probably do that later so I'm going to
09:04 - call this one ground and so now we're
09:06 - gonna save this and we're going to put
09:08 - this in a go up a level and make a
09:12 - folder called Maps I'm gonna save our
09:14 - maps in there and that will give us
09:19 - enough to get started now to our map
09:23 - here we want to add our player so I'm
09:25 - gonna instance from the tanks folder my
09:29 - player in there and there's my player
09:31 - over here in the corner and if I were to
09:34 - run the scene my player would start out
09:36 - here and I can only see a little bit of
09:39 - the map so what we want to do is we want
09:42 - to take our player scene and add a
09:45 - camera to it so I'm going to add a cam
09:48 - 2d set the current to on and then I'm
09:55 - also gonna zoom out a little bit
09:56 - let's try 1.4 see how that goes and then
10:04 - if I run my map I should have there we
10:08 - go there's my tank I can zoom around and
10:12 - see my level now one of the things we
10:16 - want to do is we need to put some limits
10:18 - on this camera because when I reach the
10:21 - edge of the map I wanted to stop
10:23 - scrolling right I actually wanted to
10:25 - stop scrolling when it reached about or
10:28 - exactly there right now if I go down any
10:31 - further then that map won't scroll
10:35 - anymore and the camera limits are set if
10:38 - we go back over to our camera here there
10:41 - the limits are set left top right and
10:44 - bottom these are your
10:46 - maximum and minimum x and y values for
10:50 - the the camera and so if I scroll out to
10:54 - to show you so this this purple
10:56 - rectangle here shows the camera what the
10:59 - camera sees right so if I were to move
11:01 - it around which I don't want to move it
11:02 - around separately if I were to move the
11:05 - player around you would see the camera
11:07 - moved to now let's say I didn't want the
11:10 - camera to go past the zero zero point
11:12 - I'm just going to do this temporarily to
11:14 - show you so if I were on the camera set
11:16 - I wanted the left limit to be zero and I
11:19 - wanted the top limit to be zero then
11:22 - when I move my player around see how
11:25 - that rectangle stops scrolling when it
11:27 - hits those limits and so we want our
11:30 - camera to do that as well but we wanted
11:33 - to do it automatically based on the size
11:35 - of the map you drew depending on how big
11:38 - the map was that's how big we want it to
11:41 - be so I'm gonna make a script for this
11:44 - map I'm gonna name it just map GD
11:48 - instead of map a1 because all our
11:51 - different maps are actually gonna use
11:52 - the same script which is just going to
11:55 - tell them how to populate themselves how
11:58 - to set them out the camera limits etc so
12:01 - here's our script for that now this is
12:05 - going to happen in the ready function
12:08 - we're going to want to say set camera
12:11 - limits and then we're going to define
12:14 - what that what that function does here
12:21 - now I'll zoom in a little bit
12:23 - alright so to set the camera limits we
12:26 - need to find out how much of the map is
12:28 - being used so we can use do that by
12:32 - using the ground get used rect and that
12:37 - gets a rectangle telling you how much
12:39 - space your map is taking up right go
12:43 - back over here that'll be this rectangle
12:46 - right if I were to place another tile
12:48 - like for some reason I place the tile
12:50 - over here now that rectangle would be
12:52 - would extend over to there but I don't
12:55 - want that so that means
12:59 - we now know how big our map total is so
13:05 - we also want to know how big the cells
13:10 - of the map are so that we know how that
13:14 - combines all right so we get the cell
13:18 - size from the ground so now we know now
13:21 - we'll know from here that our map is say
13:24 - 200 tiles wide the cell size is 128 so
13:30 - the full width of the map is 200 times
13:33 - 128 and so that's how we can find out
13:37 - what to set our map limits to so on the
13:39 - player camera we want to set the limit
13:44 - left equal to map limits position x
13:53 - times the map cell size dot X and we
14:00 - just do that again for the other three
14:02 - sides okay and there I've duplicated
14:04 - that three more times and set the four
14:07 - limits so now if we run our script again
14:10 - we should see the camera see the camera
14:15 - does not scroll past the edges of the
14:17 - map no matter how close we get to them
14:21 - and we'll go down to the bottom just to
14:22 - show you that the bottom works - there's
14:27 - the bottom of the map and I can't go any
14:29 - further so setting your camera limits
14:34 - like that is super useful when you want
14:36 - to avoid having those ugly grey voids
14:39 - around the edges of your level as you
14:41 - move around all right I think that's
14:44 - gonna do it for this installment in the
14:46 - next video we will talk about adding
14:49 - some enemy tanks to this level that will
14:52 - drive around and give us something to
14:55 - avoid thanks for watching and I'll see
14:58 - you next time
15:06 - you

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back this is part 2 of the Godot topdown tank battle game in part 1 we made the player tank and added some controls to it and in this part we're going to talk about making the terrain that we will drive around on top of in the last video we created the player tank which can drive around using the WASD keys and has a turret that points towards the mouse pointer at all times this time what we're going to talk about is how to make the map the the level that the tank is going to drive around on in your assets folder there is a terrain tile set which looks like this that's made up of a bunch of 128 by 128 tiles that are just laid out in a grid like this and we want to use these in a tile map node so that we can draw our level however we want to draw it using these individual tiles now if you know how tile maps work you have to create individual sprites out of each of these squares and you can optionally attach collisions to them which we don't need for the ground but you put those all together and then you convert that into a tile set which is a good resource object and then you use that in your tile map to draw everything now since these are all pretty much identical they're all squares and they're laid out in a regular grid rather than cut them up one by one and make these one by one which is going to be kind of tedious I thought that I would make a script that will just parse this image and convert it into a tile set directly so how do we do that well I'm going to make a new scene and I'm just gonna get a node as its root I'm just going to call this tile set maker and I'm going to save this in a terrain folder now to the scene I'm gonna add a sprite and in the texture I'm going to put the asset image now this I'm doing it this way because this scene I can reuse this in any texture I put in the sprite node he's gonna get sliced up by the script so I suspect later on we'll have some more images that we want to add or some more details we want to add to the map and we might need to use another tile set in here so we can reuse this script so we're gonna add a script to the tile set maker node and what this is gonna do is look at that texture slice it up into 128 528 chunks and stick them into a tile set object and then save that so what we need to do is we need to configure the tile size so that we know what size we need 2 slice this up into so 128 528 is the size of the drawings and the texture that we're going to use is the sprites texture and then we can just do everything in the ready so that when we run the scene it'll do it and we'll be done so first we need to get the size of the image so the texture width is going to be the get width and then we're going to divide by the tile size X so that means if I'm you know 10 tiles wide it'll be the texture size of the texture divided by 128 should come out to 10 and then text height is the same get height over a tile size dot Y then we need to make a new tileset image or it's sorry a new tileset object we do that with the new constructor so now I have a new tileset called TS and now I just need to iterate through however many tiles there are so I count two text width and I run Y from zero to text height and then I'll have a loop to go through everything now the region we want to split up that we're sorry we want to slice out of that texture is the rectangle from x times tile size X comma Y times tile size dot Y and then the width is put this over here tile size dot X so I'll size dot Y so then we have our region that we are cutting out of the texture now when we put this into the tile set it needs to be assigned an ID an ID is just a unique number an integer assigned to each tile so we need to come up with a unique ID and I'm just going to do X plus y times 10 and that'll be that'll make sure every tiles ID is unique to its position so then on our tile set we create a tile with that ID and then we say tile set texture of that ID to the texture and then tile set region will use the rectangle okay and so now when this loop is done I will have every tile created so at the end we can use resource saver to save the image and we're going to save it in the terrains sorry terrain folder I'm gonna call it terrain tiles GREs we save that that object so this saves resource saver will save any kind of any resource type object which tileset is and you just give it the location and filename so that's it so now when we open up the terrain folder here so you can see if I run this script when I close it I now have a Chow resource here in my terrains folder so I'll close that we can use that again later if we ever need it to slice up another image and we're gonna make a new folder now to be our level the the map that we're going to start with now eventually we

to put our resource that we made and there's all our tiles showing up alright soo mout so I'm here we need to change the cell size defaults to 64 and these tiles are 128 and now we've got our tile set working and we can you know go out here and draw stuff and everything looks fine so we want to draw some kind of level don't worry about this size right this is the the game window is showing right here so the map can be much larger than the game window because we'll we'll attach a camera to the player so that they can scroll them up as they run around so feel free to draw your map out however you want I'm gonna put some roads some various roads going around different places and I'll skip over the boring drawing part okay so here's a quick map I drew up just made some roads going around got a highway running down in the middle I used a little bit of the sand tiles I'm a little bit of the grass because we have the nice transition tiles between them and you know that's fine for now I named this ground because one of the useful things you can do with time apps is you can layer them and have additional tile maps on top of this one that you know place your trees or rocks or buildings or

save our maps in there and that will give us enough to get started now to our map here we want to add our player so I'm gonna instance from the tanks folder my player in there and there's my player over here in the corner and if I were to run the scene my player would start out here and I can only see a little bit of the map so what we want to do is we want to take our player scene and add a camera to it so I'm going to add a cam 2d set the current to on and then I'm also gonna zoom out a little bit let's try 1.4 see how that goes and then if I run my map I should have there we go there's my tank I can zoom around and see my level now one of the things we want to do is we need to put some limits on this camera because when I reach the edge of the map I wanted to stop scrolling right I actually wanted to stop scrolling when it reached about or exactly there right now if I go down any further then that map won't scroll anymore and the camera limits are set if we go back over to our camera here there the limits are set left top right and bottom these are your maximum and minimum x and y values for the the camera and so if I scroll out to to show you so this this purple rectangle here shows the camera what the camera sees right so if I were to move it around which I don't want to move it around separately if I were to move the player around you would see the camera moved to now let's say I didn't want the camera to go past the zero zero point I'm just going to do this temporarily to show you so if I were on the camera set I wanted the left limit to be zero and I wanted the top limit to be zero then when I move my player around see how that rectangle stops scrolling when it hits those limits and so we want our camera to do that as well but we wanted to do it

find out what to set our map limits to so on the player camera we want to set the limit left equal to map limits position x times the map cell size dot X and we just do that again for the other three

that is super useful when you want to avoid having those ugly grey voids around the edges of your level as you move around all right I think that's gonna do it for this installment in the next video we will talk about adding some enemy tanks to this level that will drive around and give us something to avoid thanks for watching and I'll see you next time you
