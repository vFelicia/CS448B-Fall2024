00:00 - welcome back to goodo recipes in this
00:02 - video we're going to look at how to set
00:03 - up animation for our 3D character in
00:07 - this video we're going to assume you've
00:08 - already imported all of your 3D assets
00:10 - if you haven't done that already I have
00:13 - a video on that which I'll link in the
00:14 - comments below and when you've got your
00:17 - assets imported come back here where we
00:19 - have our character and our animation
00:22 - player showing all the animations that
00:24 - were included with this particular
00:27 - character and we want to Now set this up
00:30 - so that we can use it in our game
00:33 - and for all these animations would be
00:34 - really really hard to
00:37 - keep track of and manage in your code
00:40 - imagine if you had an if statement for
00:43 - every single possible situation where
00:45 - you might want to choose a different
00:47 - animation it's going to get unmanageable
00:49 - really quick and for this example we're
00:52 - not going to do all of these animations
00:53 - but we are going to set up a system for
00:55 - using several of them and we're going to
00:58 - do that by using something called the
00:59 - animation tree
01:02 - the animation tree is going to do a lot
01:03 - of things for us including help us
01:05 - choose which animation to play but also
01:08 - how to transition between those
01:10 - animations it's also going to handle
01:12 - something called animation blending you
01:14 - can see I'm running the animation called
01:16 - running a right now but there's also an
01:20 - idle animation that we would want to
01:21 - play when we're standing still
01:24 - and if we're standing still and we press
01:26 - forward we want to change from
01:28 - this the idle animation to that Running
01:30 - Animation but we don't want to do it
01:32 - instantaneously because that's going to
01:34 - look really really jarring and so what
01:37 - we want to actually do is something
01:38 - called blending between the two
01:40 - animations and that's something
01:41 - animation tree is going to help us do
01:42 - too so let's get started by adding an
01:45 - animation tree
01:48 - to our scene here
01:51 - okay when we add the animation tree
01:52 - we'll see its settings over here and one
01:54 - of them is an in player because what an
01:57 - animation tree does is it controls an
01:59 - animation player so we want to assign
02:01 - the animation player from our scene
02:03 - there so it has a reference to that for
02:07 - what it's going to control and then we
02:09 - want to decide what our tree root is
02:11 - going to be we're going to go through
02:12 - what these various things mean but for
02:14 - right now choose animation node State
02:17 - machine as our tree root
02:21 - and then you'll see the window changes a
02:23 - little bit down here and the last
02:25 - warning we have here is the animation
02:26 - tree is inactive activate to
02:29 - make it work and if we press active here
02:32 - you're going to see the character is
02:34 - going to reset
02:35 - because now our animation tree is
02:38 - controlling what animations it plays and
02:40 - actually if you go over to the animation
02:42 - player you'll see it's still running but
02:43 - it's not showing anything because when
02:45 - you are when the animation tree is
02:47 - active it's in control the animation
02:50 - player node is not
02:53 - all right so let's look at the animation
02:55 - tree panel here so we've got a few
02:57 - buttons over here this little arrow
02:59 - stands for the select this little plus
03:02 - creates new nodes and this little arrow
03:05 - connects nodes and we're talking about
03:07 - nodes here we're talking about nodes in
03:09 - the
03:10 - State machine here not nodes in the tree
03:14 - so what we can do is if we right click
03:17 - out here we can add an animation and
03:19 - there we see the list of all the
03:20 - animations are animation player has in
03:22 - them so I'm going to choose the idle
03:28 - and if I hit play on here well now we'll
03:30 - see that idle playing
03:33 - and I'm also going to for this quick
03:35 - example just pick one more let's just
03:38 - say the
03:39 - melee attack
03:41 - and we want to
03:43 - look at how we would connect these
03:44 - together so if we go to the
03:47 - transition mode we can drag connections
03:50 - between these so for example dragging
03:52 - from start to idle means idle is going
03:55 - to play when we start the scene this is
03:58 - kind of like unready
04:00 - we can drag from here to here and it's
04:01 - going to immediately jump to there
04:04 - but we also want to be able to after the
04:06 - attack has animation is finished come
04:09 - back to idle so if I drag another arrow
04:11 - going back this way you're going to see
04:13 - it's just instantaneously going to be
04:15 - flickering back and forth between them
04:16 - and that's obviously not ideal so what
04:19 - we want to do is
04:22 - go back to select here and we can
04:24 - determine how we want these transitions
04:27 - to happen
04:28 - so the transition from idle to melee
04:31 - here is set to Auto we don't want that
04:33 - to be Auto we want it to be enabled so
04:35 - you can transition from here to here but
04:37 - it doesn't happen automatically
04:39 - in the transition back we can change
04:42 - switch mode here to at end meaning don't
04:46 - switch back until
04:48 - the animation finishes so now we're
04:51 - playing the idle animation and if we
04:53 - ever trigger the attack animation like
04:56 - this
04:57 - it will play and then immediately go
05:00 - back to
05:01 - idle you can see which one is active by
05:03 - the red outline around them
05:08 - and this is basically how the animation
05:10 - node State Machine Works you set up a
05:13 - sequence of animations and the
05:16 - transitions between them how you get
05:18 - from one to the next
05:20 - now this was just an example
05:22 - and so I'm going to delete these
05:24 - because what we really want to do
05:27 - what we really want to do is set up that
05:30 - idle walk run cycle
05:34 - all right let's start by right clicking
05:36 - and adding a blend space 2D
05:38 - and
05:40 - I'm going to click here to change the
05:41 - name of it call it iwr because this will
05:44 - be our idle walk run
05:47 - Loop and then we'll go ahead and do our
05:50 - transition from start because we do want
05:51 - to play this one right away
05:54 - and now when we're ready to configure
05:56 - this
05:57 - blend space 2D we click the pencil icon
05:59 - here and we will kind of go inside of it
06:03 - need to be in select mode and we go
06:06 - inside of it and now you see in root
06:08 - we're inside the iwr and we see this 2D
06:11 - grid
06:13 - and this 2D grid represents is going to
06:15 - represent our character's horizontal
06:17 - movement so up here when we're going
06:20 - forward down here when we're going
06:22 - backwards when we're moving to the left
06:24 - when we're moving to the right so
06:27 - whatever our characters horizontal
06:29 - movement Vector is
06:31 - is going to match this space here
06:34 - and we have some controls over here this
06:36 - one that I'm on right now sits the
06:38 - blending position which is this little
06:39 - Crosshair and we'll see what that does
06:41 - in a minute
06:42 - this
06:44 - Arrow here is for selecting and moving
06:46 - points and this one is for creating
06:49 - points and so we want to Define our
06:52 - grid and the first one we want to add is
06:54 - right here at the center I'm going to
06:56 - click and I say add an animation
06:58 - and that's going to be the idle because
07:00 - idle is what I want to play when my
07:03 - x velocity is 0 and my y velocity is
07:06 - zero or my forward and back velocity is
07:09 - R of zero and
07:12 - so that's there enough up here at the
07:14 - top
07:15 - I'm going to want to add the running a
07:18 - animation
07:20 - down here at the bottom I'm going to add
07:23 - the walking backwards animation
07:26 - and then on the right we can use
07:30 - running strafe right and on the left
07:34 - we can use running
07:37 - strafe left and now you see those lines
07:40 - have been connected and we have this
07:42 - little diamond shape
07:44 - and so if I go back to root here for a
07:46 - second and hit play on this iwr then go
07:50 - back in
07:52 - if I select the Crosshair here I can now
07:55 - control the blending so see as I move
07:57 - forward you see we're transitioning to
07:59 - the Running Animation and when I get all
08:01 - the way here we're fully playing the
08:03 - Running Animation
08:06 - as I scale back so you see and as I go
08:09 - all the way down to the bottom we start
08:10 - playing that walking backwards we have
08:13 - strafing to the right we have strafing
08:16 - to the left
08:17 - and anywhere in between
08:21 - take a little time to play around with
08:23 - this it's really fun to see how the
08:25 - animations blend together and when
08:28 - you're done we'll head back
08:30 - to the root node
08:32 - so now this
08:34 - kind of becomes the Hub of our
08:36 - character's animations this is where
08:38 - we're ordinarily going to be unless
08:40 - we're doing something specific
08:43 - and for the other animations that we're
08:45 - going to add in this example we're going
08:47 - to add some attack animations we're
08:49 - going to add death animation and jumping
08:53 - and but jumping is a little special so
08:55 - we're going to do that one last so first
08:57 - I'm just going to add a few more
08:58 - animations like we did in the earlier
09:02 - example
09:17 - okay so now I've set these all up just
09:19 - like we did the
09:21 - earlier example with the transition set
09:24 - the way we want them so when we're in
09:26 - idle walk run we can trigger one of the
09:29 - attacks and it'll transition back to
09:32 - idle
09:33 - we can trigger the interact
09:36 - which is to push a button or a door and
09:39 - then we have the death animation which
09:40 - does not have a transition back so when
09:42 - it happens
09:45 - that's when the game's over
09:47 - and so this is all just like the example
09:51 - before and now we want to set up jump
09:53 - and jump is going to work a little
09:55 - different because the jump animation
09:56 - comes in three parts
09:59 - so let's add those nodes and take a look
10:01 - at how they look
10:05 - all right so the animation for jump
10:07 - comes in three parts there's the jump
10:09 - start which is the launching off of the
10:11 - ground and there's the jump land which
10:13 - is when you hit the ground but jump idle
10:17 - is a looping animation that's designed
10:19 - to play as long as you are in the air
10:21 - so maybe you
10:23 - step off a cliff you're gonna play Jump
10:26 - Idol until you hit the ground
10:28 - so the transitions between these are not
10:30 - necessarily going to be always the same
10:34 - so we are going to want to transition
10:36 - from
10:38 - idling to jump start
10:40 - and that the way that transition is
10:42 - going to work is
10:45 - we're going to want to do it immediately
10:47 - but what we're going to do is instead of
10:49 - being automatic
10:51 - we're going to have the condition here
10:54 - jumping
10:56 - and that's going to be a condition that
10:58 - we can set in our code
11:00 - go back to
11:02 - I don't hear so now you see it's not
11:03 - even though it says Auto it's not
11:05 - transitioning into there because until
11:06 - this jumping condition becomes true
11:09 - the transition won't happen
11:12 - going from let's make a connection here
11:15 - from start to idle
11:18 - okay that's going to happen
11:21 - at end so if you trigger the jump start
11:24 - it will play and then go to jump idle
11:29 - if the transition from jump idle to jump
11:31 - land
11:35 - is also going to be Auto
11:37 - but it's going to have a
11:40 - grounded condition
11:42 - so however we will stay in the jump idle
11:45 - train uh
11:46 - we'll stay in the jump idle animation as
11:49 - long as we need to but as soon as
11:50 - grounded becomes true we're going to
11:52 - transition to jump land
11:54 - and then that transition goes back to
11:57 - iwr
12:00 - when it's finished playing
12:02 - and then lastly we're going to have one
12:04 - more transition here to go straight to
12:06 - jump idle and there you see the jump
12:07 - idle playing but that we're just going
12:10 - to set to enabled
12:14 - and we want that so that if we're
12:15 - walking along and we just step off a
12:18 - cliff we can transition to
12:20 - jump idle
12:22 - if I go back here to
12:25 - playing the idol now when a jump starts
12:29 - it will transition to this
12:32 - you see we left up we're in Jump idle
12:34 - and when grounded becomes true we'll
12:36 - transition to that
12:38 - now if you notice here let me jump back
12:40 - to here
12:42 - take a look at this a little closer
12:45 - so we're following through the air we're
12:46 - falling through the air and when I play
12:47 - Jump land
12:49 - watch the transition from jump land to
12:51 - iwr
12:53 - see there's a little jump there or a
12:55 - little stutter because those two
12:56 - animations the end of the jump land and
12:59 - the beginning of idle don't quite match
13:01 - up
13:01 - so what we can do here is in this
13:04 - transition
13:05 - add a small Crossfade time of 0.1
13:08 - seconds
13:09 - and let's watch what happens watch how
13:11 - this looks different I'm going to press
13:13 - jump land
13:14 - and then it just looks like his feet
13:16 - spread out naturally
13:18 - instead of
13:20 - that jarring effect
13:22 - all right so now we've set up all of the
13:24 - animations that we want to use
13:27 - and for most of the others if you want
13:28 - to use any of those you're going to set
13:30 - them up in a very similar way
13:32 - but these are what we're going to do for
13:33 - this demo and so in the next
13:36 - video we'll talk about how to combine
13:39 - this with code so when we start doing
13:41 - our character controller and moving
13:43 - around this screen how do we access this
13:47 - animation tree and make sure we're
13:48 - playing the right animation depending on
13:51 - what we're doing
13:52 - so if you haven't already liked the

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back to goodo recipes in this video we're going to look at how to set up animation for our 3D character in this video we're going to assume you've already imported all of your 3D assets if you haven't done that already I have a video on that which I'll link in the comments below and when you've got your assets imported come back here where we have our character and our animation player showing all the animations that were included with this particular character and we want to Now set this up so that we can use it in our game and for all these animations would be really really hard to keep track of and manage in your code imagine if you had an if statement for every single possible situation where you might want to choose a different animation it's going to get unmanageable really quick and for this example we're not going to do all of these animations but we are going to set up a system for using several of them and we're going to do that by using something called the animation tree the animation tree is going to do a lot of things for us including help us choose which animation to play but also how to transition between those animations it's also going to handle something called animation blending you can see I'm running the animation called running a right now but there's also an idle animation that we would want to play when we're standing still and if we're standing still and we press forward we want to change from this the idle animation to that Running Animation but we don't want to do it instantaneously because that's going to look really really jarring and so what we want to actually do is something called blending between the two animations and that's something animation tree is going to help us do too so let's get started by adding an animation tree to our scene here okay when we add the animation tree we'll see its settings over here and one of them is an in player because what an animation tree does is it controls an animation player so we want to assign the animation player from our scene there so it has a reference to that for what it's going to control and then we want to decide what our tree root is going to be we're going to go through what these various things mean but for right now choose animation node State machine as our tree root and then you'll see the window changes a little bit down here and the last warning we have here is the animation tree is inactive activate to make it work and if we press active here you're going to see the character is going to reset because now our animation tree is controlling what animations it plays and actually if you go over to the animation player you'll see it's still running but it's not showing anything because when you are when the animation tree is active it's in control the animation player node is not all right so let's look at the animation tree panel here so we've got a few buttons over here this little arrow stands for the select this little plus creates new nodes and this little arrow connects nodes and we're talking about nodes here we're talking about nodes in the State machine here not nodes in the tree so what we can do is if we right click out here we can add an animation and there we see the list of all the animations are animation player has in them so I'm going to choose the idle and if I hit play on here well now we'll see that idle playing and I'm also going to for this quick example just pick one more let's just say the melee attack and we want to look at how we would connect these together so if we go to the transition mode we can drag connections between these so for example dragging from start to idle means idle is going to play when we start the scene this is kind of like unready we can drag from here to here and it's going to immediately jump to there but we also want to be able to after the attack has animation is finished come back to idle so if I drag another arrow going back this way you're going to see it's just instantaneously going to be flickering back and forth between them and that's obviously not ideal so what we want to do is go back to select here and we can determine how we want these transitions to happen so the transition from idle to melee here is set to Auto we don't want that to be Auto we want it to be enabled so you can transition from here to here but it doesn't happen automatically in the transition back we can change switch mode here to at end meaning don't switch back until the animation finishes so now we're playing the idle animation and if we ever trigger the attack animation like this it will play and then immediately go back to idle you can see which one is active by the red outline around them and this is basically how the animation node State Machine Works you set up a sequence of animations and the transitions between them how you get from one to the next now this was just an example and so I'm going to delete these because what we really want to do what we really want to do is set up that idle walk run cycle all right let's start by right clicking and adding a blend space 2D and I'm going to click here to change the name of it call it iwr because this will be our idle walk run Loop and then we'll go ahead and do our transition from start because we do want to play this one right away and now when we're ready to configure this blend space 2D we click the pencil icon here and we will kind of go inside of it need to be in select mode and we go inside of it and now you see in root we're inside the iwr and we see this 2D grid and this 2D grid represents is going to represent our character's horizontal movement so up here when we're going forward down here when we're going backwards when we're moving to the left when we're moving to the right so whatever our characters horizontal movement Vector is is going to match this space here and we have some controls over here this one that I'm on right now sits the blending position which is this little Crosshair and we'll see what that does in a minute this Arrow here is for selecting and moving points and this one is for creating points and so we want to Define our grid and the first one we want to add is right here at the center I'm going to click and I say add an animation and that's going to be the idle because idle is what I want to play when my x velocity is 0 and my y velocity is zero or my forward and back velocity is R of zero and so that's there enough up here at the top I'm going to want to add the running a animation down here at the bottom I'm going to add the walking backwards animation and then on the right we can use running strafe right and on the left we can use running strafe left and now you see those lines have been connected and we have this little diamond shape and so if I go back to root here for a second and hit play on this iwr then go back in if I select the Crosshair here I can now control the blending so see as I move forward you see we're transitioning to the Running Animation and when I get all the way here we're fully playing the Running Animation as I scale back so you see and as I go all the way down to the bottom we start playing that walking backwards we have strafing to the right we have strafing to the left and anywhere in between take a little time to play around with this it's really fun to see how the animations blend together and when you're done we'll head back to the root node so now this kind of becomes the Hub of our character's animations this is where we're ordinarily going to be unless we're doing something specific and for the other animations that we're going to add in this example we're going to add some attack animations we're going to add death animation and jumping and but jumping is a little special so we're going to do that one last so first I'm just going to add a few more animations like we did in the earlier example okay so now I've set these all up just like we did the earlier example with the transition set the way we want them so when we're in idle walk run we can trigger one of the attacks and it'll transition back to idle we can trigger the interact which is to push a button or a door and then we have the death animation which does not have a transition back so when it happens that's when the game's over and so this is all just like the example before and now we want to set up jump and jump is going to work a little different because the jump animation comes in three parts so let's add those nodes and take a look at how they look all right so the animation for jump comes in three parts there's the jump start which is the launching off of the ground and there's the jump land which is when you hit the ground but jump idle is a looping animation that's designed to play as long as you are in the air so maybe you step off a cliff you're gonna play Jump Idol until you hit the ground so the transitions between these are not necessarily going to be always the same so we are going to want to transition from idling to jump start and that the way that transition is going to work is we're going to want to do it immediately but what we're going to do is instead of being automatic we're going to have the condition here jumping and that's going to be a condition that we can set in our code go back to I don't hear so now you see it's not even though it says Auto it's not transitioning into there because until this jumping condition becomes true the transition won't happen going from let's make a connection here from start to idle okay that's going to happen at end so if you trigger the jump start it will play and then go to jump idle if the transition from jump idle to jump land is also going to be Auto but it's going to have a grounded condition so however we will stay in the jump idle train uh we'll stay in the jump idle animation as long as we need to but as soon as grounded becomes true we're going to transition to jump land and then that transition goes back to iwr when it's finished playing and then lastly we're going to have one more transition here to go straight to jump idle and there you see the jump idle playing but that we're just going to set to enabled and we want that so that if we're walking along and we just step off a cliff we can transition to jump idle if I go back here to playing the idol now when a jump starts it will transition to this you see we left up we're in Jump idle and when grounded becomes true we'll transition to that now if you notice here let me jump back to here take a look at this a little closer so we're following through the air we're falling through the air and when I play Jump land watch the transition from jump land to iwr see there's a little jump there or a little stutter because those two animations the end of the jump land and the beginning of idle don't quite match up so what we can do here is in this transition add a small Crossfade time of 0.1 seconds and let's watch what happens watch how this looks different I'm going to press jump land and then it just looks like his feet spread out naturally instead of that jarring effect all right so now we've set up all of the animations that we want to use and for most of the others if you want to use any of those you're going to set them up in a very similar way but these are what we're going to do for this demo and so in the next video we'll talk about how to combine this with code so when we start doing our character controller and moving around this screen how do we access this animation tree and make sure we're playing the right animation depending on what we're doing so if you haven't already liked the video and subscribed so you can see the next one when it comes out
