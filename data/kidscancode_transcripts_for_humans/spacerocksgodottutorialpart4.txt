00:00 - welcome back to space rocks to go to
00:02 - game engine tutorial series this is part
00:05 - 4 we're going to continue with the
00:07 - asteroids we made in the last video and
00:10 - update them to allow us to spawn them
00:12 - into that sizes different quantities and
00:15 - in different locations okay let's get
00:17 - started
00:18 - okay so the first thing we're going to
00:20 - do is we're going to update our main
00:21 - team we're going to delete all these
00:23 - asteroid instances because I don't want
00:25 - to manually have to instance them here
00:28 - what I want to happen is we're going to
00:31 - different different levels different
00:33 - ways and different numbers of meteors
00:34 - are going to spawn so we're going to
00:36 - have our main node in charge of that so
00:39 - we're going to delete these okay now
00:43 - we're just going to add a script to our
00:45 - main node we want to make sure that in
00:48 - the scripts folder and this script is
00:52 - going to control the game or it's going
00:56 - to manage all of the objects in the
00:58 - scene so it's going to spawn meteors
00:59 - however many we want for whatever level
01:01 - we're on going to keep track of the
01:03 - score it's going to display the display
01:06 - to score and whatever HUD information we
01:08 - want to show all that kind of thing so
01:11 - the first little bit our asteroid here
01:13 - and we have all of this art over here
01:16 - and you have a bunch of different sizes
01:18 - of the asteroids the brown ones and grey
01:23 - ones I'm going to use the grey ones but
01:25 - there are big medium small and tiny
01:29 - switch for different sizes and what I'm
01:32 - going to want to happen is when we blow
01:34 - up a big one it's going to split into
01:37 - multiple medium ones and medium ones
01:40 - will break into small ones and so forth
01:41 - so you want to be able to let me spawn
01:45 - the asteroid tell it what texture to use
01:49 - and by that you know in relation to that
01:53 - out big to be okay save you watching me
01:57 - type them out I just skipped ahead to I
02:00 - made this textures which is a dictionary
02:04 - and the keys are just the four different
02:08 - sizes and each key is pointing to the
02:12 - list
02:13 - here's a list of the different textures
02:17 - so what we're going to do is only
02:19 - spawned the asteroid we're going to tell
02:21 - it what size we want and whichever size
02:25 - we pick is going to pick a random
02:27 - texture out of that category okay so now
02:33 - we want to take out this line because we
02:35 - don't want to you don't know the size
02:38 - yet when we first run the script so we
02:42 - haven't chosen the texture yet so we
02:44 - can't set the extent so we're going to
02:46 - make a function called in it and we're
02:48 - going to what we're going to pass to
02:49 - this is the size that we want and each
02:55 - position where we want it to spawn
02:58 - because we don't want them all to spawn
02:59 - on top of each other in the same
03:00 - location okay and so we're going to have
03:05 - to pick what texture to use this is
03:10 - going to be a random choice out of the
03:14 - particular category of whatever size we
03:16 - chose so we're going to load from the
03:21 - textures dictionary keep the queue size
03:26 - and then the item we wanted to random
03:29 - one out of the list so we're going to
03:30 - pick a random number and we use the
03:35 - modulus to make sure we pick between
03:37 - like if they're three we'll pick zero
03:40 - one or two you want to just take
03:42 - whatever the textures size category is
03:46 - dot size so if there's three this will
03:50 - be equal to three so we're taking a
03:52 - random integer modulo 3 which can only
03:55 - give us 0 1 or 2
03:57 - ok so we've got the texture now we need
04:01 - to just set our sprite mode you get node
04:06 - sprites set texture to that texture and
04:13 - then we can use the then we can get the
04:17 - extents like we did before that's just
04:21 - the texture
04:23 - getsize bye-bye - we're going to set
04:28 - position to let it additionally
04:30 - specified and that's it so let's let's
04:33 - just try this out by calling in it with
04:37 - a big meteor at screen we'll put it at
04:43 - screen size over to center the screen
04:45 - just to try this out let's hit run scene
04:49 - and there we've got a big asteroid we've
04:55 - run it again you might see we got a
04:58 - different texture and we can even try it
05:01 - if we put small in there we should see a
05:05 - small one there's a small one now our
05:09 - only problem now is that if I turn on
05:14 - collision shapes we are going to see
05:17 - that when we find a small one it's still
05:20 - going to have this big collision circle
05:22 - because we set our collision size to
05:26 - that size and now we'll have the problem
05:30 - that we need the size of this collision
05:32 - object to be the collision shape to be
05:35 - the radius of whatever texture we're
05:37 - using all right we don't want it to be
05:40 - the same size when the meet limit
05:42 - picture is smaller so what we're going
05:44 - to do is we're going to delete this you
05:47 - can delete that collision shape and
05:48 - we're going to make the collision shape
05:51 - when we choose our texture so what we
05:56 - can do is after we've set the texture
06:01 - we're just going to say we're going to
06:05 - make a new circle shape to be objects
06:10 - that's what we want and we're going to
06:13 - take that shape and we're going to set
06:15 - its radius when I said it's radius -
06:19 - well we want to know how wide the
06:23 - texture is but some of these some of
06:25 - these images are wider than they are
06:28 - tall and vice versa so I don't want the
06:32 - circle to be set by this distance
06:35 - the distance across it's the distance if
06:38 - the height is smaller so so we're going
06:40 - to choose the minimum of the texture dot
06:46 - get with / - for the texture get height
06:54 - / - so whichever one is smaller we'll
06:59 - use that as the radius and then we just
07:03 - have to say add shape and that adds the
07:07 - shape to our cinematic body so now we'll
07:12 - have the right size shapes for whatever
07:15 - size after it responding I'm going to
07:18 - get rid of this this is just a test
07:20 - alright let's go over to our main scene
07:22 - and start out by wanting somebody so we
07:26 - need a you need to load that after I
07:29 - team so we can instance it so we're
07:34 - going to use preload to do that and we
07:37 - want the asteroids scene so I'm just
07:42 - going to copy the path there and paste
07:47 - that in and now we have that and now
07:51 - what we want to do is when the game
07:58 - starts we're going to spawn say five of
08:01 - these so we need to pick where to spawn
08:02 - them and to do that I'm going to use
08:05 - that handy position 2d like we used on
08:11 - the ship and I'm going to set some spawn
08:14 - locations around the screen so I'm going
08:18 - to do that real quick and skip the
08:21 - videos me clicking on all of them okay
08:23 - so I've just made eight of these
08:25 - position to dinos labeled one through
08:27 - eight and I've put them in a container
08:29 - called spawn locations so that they're
08:31 - organized and we can hide them and these
08:35 - are the spots where the asteroids can
08:37 - spawn when we restart that way we know
08:40 - since we're cleaning this ship at the
08:41 - middle the beginning they're going to
08:44 - spawn out here on the edges and not be
08:46 - right on top of the player
08:49 - okay so on our script list that just put
08:52 - in the ready that we want to spawn five
08:55 - of these so we're going to count to five
09:00 - and we're going to say we're going to
09:02 - make a new asteroid instance we're going
09:10 - to take that instance and we're going to
09:11 - add it as a child and then we're going
09:15 - to take that instance we're going to use
09:16 - the in it that we made to say I want
09:20 - them to be big and I want the position
09:22 - to be we need to use the spawn locations
09:27 - so we're going to say I'm going to make
09:28 - another variable here we call it spawns
09:36 - equals get node spawn locations
09:48 - and I just want to say spawns dot get
09:52 - child and the name of the names of the
09:58 - children are so so we can just use I all
10:03 - the children of an odor just are
10:04 - numbered zero one two three four right
10:06 - so we can just get whatever one we're on
10:09 - and it'll take one through five for the
10:10 - places to spawn them we just need to get
10:14 - that position okay so let's try that
10:20 - there we go we want some back ten in the
10:23 - corners and they come on to the screen
10:24 - now fine let's randomize it again okay
10:30 - the player has a little time to react to
10:32 - see where they are coming from before we
10:36 - start to shoot and if we want to spawn a
10:38 - bunch of a medium ones then we can do
10:43 - that too okay so now we have that
10:50 - working away we want we can spawn them
10:53 - now we'll be able to do the shooting
10:55 - this is when the bullet hits the
10:57 - asteroid I want it to break apart into
11:01 - multiple smaller ones so we'll be able
11:04 - to you know when I hit the medium one
11:07 - destroy it an instance two small ones
11:11 - there when I shoot a small one I can
11:14 - destroy it in instance two tiny ones
11:17 - there and we'll do that in the next
11:20 - video thanks for watching and I'll see
11:24 - you next time
11:31 - you

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back to space rocks to go to game engine tutorial series this is part 4 we're going to continue with the asteroids we made in the last video and update them to allow us to spawn them into that sizes different quantities and in different locations okay let's get started okay so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to update our main team we're going to delete all these asteroid instances because I don't want to manually have to instance them here what I want to happen is we're going to different different levels different ways and different numbers of meteors are going to spawn so we're going to have our main node in charge of that so we're going to delete these okay now we're just going to add a script to our main node we want to make sure that in the scripts folder and this script is going to control the game or it's going to manage all of the objects in the scene so it's going to spawn meteors however many we want for whatever level we're on going to keep track of the score it's going to display the display to score and whatever HUD information we want to show all that kind of thing so the first little bit our asteroid here and we have all of this art over here and you have a bunch of different sizes of the asteroids the brown ones and grey ones I'm going to use the grey ones but there are big medium small and tiny switch for different sizes and what I'm going to want to happen is when we blow up a big one it's going to split into multiple medium ones and medium ones will break into small ones and so forth so you want to be able to let me spawn the asteroid tell it what texture to use and by that you know in relation to that out big to be okay save you watching me type them out I just skipped ahead to I made this textures which is a dictionary and the keys are just the four different sizes and each key is pointing to the list here's a list of the different textures so what we're going to do is only spawned the asteroid we're going to tell it what size we want and whichever size we pick is going to pick a random texture out of that category okay so now we want to take out this line because we don't want to you don't know the size yet when we first run the script so we haven't chosen the texture yet so we can't set the extent so we're going to make a function called in it and we're going to what we're going to pass to this is the size that we want and each position where we want it to spawn because we don't want them all to spawn on top of each other in the same location okay and so we're going to have to pick what texture to use this is going to be a random choice out of the particular category of whatever size we chose so we're going to load from the textures dictionary keep the queue size and then the item we wanted to random one out of the list so we're going to pick a random number and we use the modulus to make sure we pick between like if they're three we'll pick zero one or two you want to just take whatever the textures size category is dot size so if there's three this will be equal to three so we're taking a random integer modulo 3 which can only give us 0 1 or 2 ok so we've got the texture now we need to just set our sprite mode you get node sprites set texture to that texture and then we can use the then we can get the extents like we did before that's just the texture getsize byebye we're going to set position to let it additionally specified and that's it so let's let's just try this out by calling in it with a big meteor at screen we'll put it at screen size over to center the screen just to try this out let's hit run scene and there we've got a big asteroid we've run it again you might see we got a different texture and we can even try it if we put small in there we should see a small one there's a small one now our only problem now is that if I turn on collision shapes we are going to see that when we find a small one it's still going to have this big collision circle because we set our collision size to that size and now we'll have the problem that we need the size of this collision object to be the collision shape to be the radius of whatever texture we're using all right we don't want it to be the same size when the meet limit picture is smaller so what we're going to do is we're going to delete this you can delete that collision shape and we're going to make the collision shape when we choose our texture so what we can do is after we've set the texture we're just going to say we're going to make a new circle shape to be objects that's what we want and we're going to take that shape and we're going to set its radius when I said it's radius well we want to know how wide the texture is but some of these some of these images are wider than they are tall and vice versa so I don't want the circle to be set by this distance the distance across it's the distance if the height is smaller so so we're going to choose the minimum of the texture dot get with / for the texture get height / so whichever one is smaller we'll use that as the radius and then we just have to say add shape and that adds the shape to our cinematic body so now we'll have the
