00:00 - welcome to another recipe in this video
00:04 - we're gonna look at how to make a touch
00:06 - screen controlled camera with pan and
00:09 - zoom features alright let's get started
00:11 - okay start here I've got a little
00:13 - top-down 2d game that I want to put on
00:15 - mobile and you know my player can walk
00:17 - around and I can see all the map but I
00:20 - want to have some control of the camera
00:23 - on mobile I want to be able to pan the
00:26 - camera around by dragging my finger on
00:27 - the screen and I want to be able to
00:29 - pinch and zoom the camera in and out all
00:32 - right we're gonna start with a new scene
00:34 - with a camera 2d which I'm going to call
00:37 - touch screen camera and let's go ahead
00:43 - and save that so this is gonna extend
00:45 - the camera so we're gonna add a script
00:47 - to it it extends camera to T's we're
00:49 - basically taking the camera to D and
00:51 - adding some additional functionality to
00:54 - it okay we're gonna add a just follow a
00:58 - little bigger we're gonna add a node
01:00 - path variable so that we can set the
01:03 - target that's the thing that the camera
01:05 - is going to be following and then we
01:08 - have a few variables that we need to set
01:11 - for how we want the speed that we wanted
01:14 - to move and things like that so there's
01:17 - a couple things when we drag the camera
01:19 - we want it to return to the target all
01:22 - right if I pan over to the side a lot
01:24 - and when I let go the screen I want it
01:26 - to pan back to the player and stay
01:28 - centered on them so target return
01:32 - enabled we're gonna set that to true and
01:35 - we can set that to false if we don't
01:37 - want that to happen if we want to force
01:38 - the player to drag the camera themselves
01:40 - if they want to go back to where the
01:42 - player is target return rate is how fast
01:46 - it's gonna do that and we're gonna do
01:50 - that relatively slow so we can see the
01:52 - effect we're gonna have a min and a max
01:55 - zoom level that we can go to and this
01:58 - will depend on your particular scale and
02:04 - how much of the map you want to the
02:05 - player to be able to see it once and
02:07 - that's supposed to be Max and we're also
02:11 - going to have a
02:12 - speed that's how fast the zoom will
02:16 - happen and oh and then the last one is
02:22 - we need to zoom sensitivity that's gonna
02:26 - be how sensitive the zoom is to your
02:29 - pinch gestures how much do you need to
02:33 - move your finger to make it zoom all
02:37 - right
02:37 - and then we're gonna need a couple
02:38 - variables events is gonna be a
02:41 - dictionary that keeps track of the touch
02:43 - events that happen in the input system
02:46 - and finally last drag distance is gonna
02:51 - be a variable to keep track of as we're
02:54 - doing the pinching how much we moved the
02:57 - two pinch points the two touch points to
03:02 - each other all right in the process
03:07 - function we're going to move the camera
03:10 - towards the target
03:12 - if target return is enabled so if
03:14 - there's a target and target return
03:17 - enabled is true and event size equals
03:23 - zero that means there's no drag events
03:25 - happening so all those things are true
03:28 - then we're going to take our cameras
03:31 - position and we're gonna alert it back
03:34 - to the target to the targets position at
03:43 - the target return rate all right now we
03:47 - can start programming the gestures and
03:49 - we're going to start with the pan
03:50 - gesture so we're gonna capture this in
03:53 - unhandled input and if the event is an
03:58 - input event screen touch that's what
04:02 - we're looking for then either it's going
04:04 - to be pressed meaning we started a touch
04:07 - or it's going to be released which means
04:09 - we let go so if it's pressed that means
04:13 - we started a new event so in the events
04:17 - we're going to use the event index as
04:19 - the key and we're going to store the
04:22 - event in that dictionary
04:24 - we're doing this because there can be
04:25 - multiple events at once right when
04:27 - you're doing a pinch there's two touches
04:29 - happening at the same time and if we got
04:34 - a event that wasn't pressed then we need
04:39 - to do the opposite and we need to erase
04:42 - the event index out of that dictionary
04:44 - okay so that detected a touch but now we
04:47 - need to detect if it was a drag so if we
04:54 - get a screen drag event then we're gonna
04:58 - also put that into the into the
05:03 - dictionary and note that if the index
05:07 - was the same meaning if we just did one
05:09 - touch it's gonna be index zero and then
05:11 - we start dragging that same touch index
05:14 - zero is gonna get updated to be that new
05:16 - event if event size is one so if we only
05:22 - have one event when we have a drag that
05:25 - means we're doing a single finger drag
05:27 - so we're gonna update the position of
05:29 - the camera and we'll use event are
05:32 - relative to get the direction we moved
05:34 - in and we'll multiply it by our zoom
05:39 - level which right now is one so we're
05:42 - multiplying by one but as we zoom in or
05:44 - out we're gonna want to change the speed
05:45 - of our drag okay so let's take a look at
05:50 - what that looks like so I've added a
05:52 - couple of debug draw commands here so
05:53 - that we can see this is just displaying
05:56 - the size of that events dictionary and
05:59 - the zoom level of the camera and then
06:02 - when I detect a touch event I'm going to
06:04 - draw a circle there so now we can see if
06:07 - this was our finger we can drag it and
06:10 - the camera will pan around wherever we
06:12 - go and when we let go it will slowly
06:16 - come back to the target at that return
06:20 - rate speed and so we've made it a little
06:23 - since we're doing lerp there it will go
06:27 - fast when it's far away and then
06:29 - gradually slow down as it gets back to
06:31 - the player so that's working pretty good
06:35 - and as you can see we can test it on the
06:37 - PC
06:38 - with our mouse but unfortunately to test
06:41 - the pinch and zoom we need to touch
06:45 - events and we can't emulate that with
06:47 - the mouse so we are going to have to
06:48 - test on the phone
06:50 - alright so fortunately I have an Android
06:53 - device which means it's as easy for me
06:55 - as pressing the Android deploy button
06:57 - here to launch the application on my
07:00 - device which I have capturing in an app
07:03 - here so now we can see the app here and
07:06 - I'm going to go and I'm going to touch
07:07 - the screen on my phone and you can see
07:09 - the pan is still working and now if we
07:11 - want to do the zoom I'm going to see the
07:14 - two touch events occur and then as I
07:17 - pinch in and out you see the camera
07:20 - zooming so that is all working like we
07:25 - want and see how the pan speed is
07:27 - affected by the zoom level so that we
07:29 - don't pan too fast when we're zoomed in
07:32 - and too slow when we're zoomed out so
07:35 - that's it a fairly basic starter drag
07:39 - camera that you can add to your mobile
07:42 - apps some ways you could extend this you
07:44 - could return the zoom to the original
07:48 - level after zooming you could use a
07:50 - double tap to reset all of the camera
07:53 - settings to zoom back out on a double
07:55 - tap you can add more gestures right if
07:58 - event size is 3 then you have a three
08:00 - finger drag happening and you could do
08:01 - another behavior when that occurs all
08:05 - right thanks for watching and I'll see
08:07 - you in the next recipe this tutorial is
08:09 - part of my nugudo recipes website the
08:12 - goal is to collect all the best tips and
08:13 - lessons to help make you a better at
