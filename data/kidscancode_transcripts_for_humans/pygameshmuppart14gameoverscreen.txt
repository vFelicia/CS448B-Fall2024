00:00 - hi this is game development with pygame
00:02 - and in this video we're going to wrap up
00:06 - our shmoop game by adding a game over
00:09 - screen and giving us the ability to play
00:12 - again in this video we're going to add a
00:19 - simple game over or title screen to our
00:22 - game so that when you start it up you
00:25 - know it doesn't start immediately like
00:27 - this immediately start playing and then
00:29 - also so that when we die and here I'll
00:33 - show you what happens so that you can be
00:37 - clear what I'm talking about one more
00:40 - life left okay and the game just exits
00:48 - right we'd like to be able to say game
00:50 - over press the key to play again
00:52 - something like that so that's what we're
00:54 - going to do this time around so if we go
00:58 - down here we have our game loop right
01:02 - this while running as long as running is
01:04 - true the game loop runs and when our
01:07 - lives run out we set running to false
01:10 - and the game is over so what we can do
01:15 - is basically we want the game to have
01:18 - two states either while this game loop
01:22 - is running it's either showing the game
01:23 - over screen or or it's playing the game
01:26 - one or the other
01:27 - okay so what I'm gonna do is make
01:30 - another variable for that called game
01:32 - over and that's going to determine
01:39 - whether we should show the game over
01:41 - screen or not okay
01:42 - and in this while running loop I'm just
01:47 - going to say if game over so what should
01:50 - we do if the game is over well we should
01:53 - show the game over screen and it should
01:55 - sit there and wait for the player to
01:59 - press a key to start the game so what
02:03 - I'm going to do is I'm just gonna say
02:04 - show game over screen and we'll define
02:07 - that in a second that's going to do the
02:10 - the waiting right so when they do
02:13 - Sakhi and the game over screen ends and
02:16 - we come back to right here we're gonna
02:17 - say the game game over is false that way
02:22 - we won't be showing it the next time
02:24 - through the loop but we have one other
02:26 - problem and that is that when the game
02:30 - ends say I'm playing the game and I run
02:32 - out of live so my score is something and
02:35 - my lives are zero well if I go to the
02:37 - game over screen that's fine but if I
02:39 - press the start again and I just switch
02:41 - game over to false then it's gonna try
02:43 - to run the loop but my lives are still
02:44 - going to be zero and my score is still
02:47 - going to be whatever it was I have to
02:48 - reset everything that's basically all of
02:51 - this stuff from here to there so setting
02:56 - up the empty groups for for all our
02:58 - different types of sprites spawning the
03:00 - player and spawning the starting mobs
03:02 - and setting the score 2:0 are all the
03:05 - things that we do when we start a new
03:07 - game so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
03:10 - cut that and I'm gonna paste it right
03:12 - here so when we come back from the game
03:16 - over screen we're gonna do all of these
03:20 - things that that start a new game okay
03:26 - and then down here when we die when our
03:29 - lives run out right when our lives run
03:33 - out we want to set game over to true now
03:38 - because the game is over but not running
03:41 - equals false because that would make the
03:43 - whole program end okay so that's really
03:48 - all we need to make this happen
03:50 - except now that we need to define what
03:52 - show game over screen does well the
03:55 - shame show game over screen is just
03:56 - gonna have some some text on it and
03:58 - things so I'm gonna define that I'll go
04:01 - up here to where I have my other
04:03 - definitions and we'll go show game over
04:08 - screen okay so what are we gonna do on
04:11 - this screen well we're gonna draw some
04:14 - text so let's draw on to the screen the
04:18 - text we want to draw is will draw the
04:21 - title of our of our game and I think
04:25 - I'll make it LR
04:27 - font size so it stands out and I'm gonna
04:30 - put that at with over two so it's
04:32 - centered on the screen horizontally and
04:35 - I'm loaded at height over four so it's
04:38 - up here at the guy the top quarter of
04:41 - the screen
04:43 - okay then I'm also going to put a here
04:49 - some instructions right because when you
04:51 - start up a game you want to know what
04:58 - the controls are right so we'll tell him
05:00 - that tell the player what they need to
05:02 - do we can make this a little smaller and
05:05 - we're gonna put this at with over two as
05:07 - well but we're going to put the height
05:10 - over two so it's gonna be at the center
05:12 - of the screen here let me do that so you
05:14 - can see the whole line without getting
05:19 - too long and then the last thing that I
05:23 - want to put on the screen is I want to
05:27 - say press a key to begin and that we can
05:33 - make a little smaller even it's still
05:35 - centered but this is going to be at
05:38 - height times three three quarters all
05:43 - right so that way it's towards the
05:46 - bottom of the screen we'll flip the
05:52 - screen so that they can see it and now
05:55 - we need to just wait for them to press a
05:57 - key which means we want to start an
05:59 - infinite loop or I should say a while
06:02 - loop which continues until they press a
06:06 - key so let's set waiting equals true and
06:11 - say while waiting so as long as they're
06:16 - waiting we're gonna go ahead and and use
06:20 - our we'll just use our FPS clock to to
06:24 - control the speed of this loop and then
06:28 - we're just going to check what events
06:32 - have happened okay and the the events we
06:35 - want to check for there's actually two
06:37 - yes we want to wait for the player to
06:38 - press the key but we don't want to
06:41 - nor the clicking the X up in the corner
06:43 - of the window right but otherwise the
06:45 - player is trapped playing this game
06:47 - right down in our original loop we check
06:51 - for the quit event to let you quit out
06:55 - of the game we also want to check for
06:57 - the quit event in our on our game over
07:01 - screen so if the event dot type is PI
07:08 - game dot quit then we want to actually
07:11 - just quit the whole program we don't
07:14 - want to just end the loop and go back
07:16 - into our game ok and now we want the key
07:20 - so now there's a little trick here to
07:23 - now I could do key down like this to say
07:27 - yeah they pressed a key but here's the
07:29 - problem with that let's say that it I
07:31 - can press any key right so if let's say
07:34 - that the key that I pressed down was one
07:37 - of the arrow keys or the space key then
07:39 - I'm gonna push it down this loop is
07:43 - gonna end and the game is gonna start
07:45 - but that's gonna happen pretty quickly
07:48 - and I probably still have the key down
07:49 - so basically my game has started and my
07:53 - key is down so if this is the spacebar
07:55 - I'd already be shooting and what we
07:58 - really like to do is let the player
08:00 - start the controls when they're ready to
08:03 - do it so if we do it on a key up event
08:06 - then when it says press any key to
08:07 - continue and you tap the key we start
08:10 - the game or we end the game over screen
08:12 - I should say by the key going up not the
08:14 - key going down ok so we'll stay waiting
08:18 - equals false ok so let's see how that
08:22 - looks so when we start our game there's
08:25 - our title screen ok we press a key and
08:28 - it begins ok now I'm going to die here
08:33 - so we can make sure that it goes back to
08:36 - the new game properly and resets
08:40 - everything ok
08:46 - game over now notice that I didn't wipe
08:50 - the screen when we when we died and now
08:55 - we have the shmoop title screen and
08:58 - everything on top of the background if
09:00 - we hit start it'll clear again now that
09:02 - is we have an option we could do a
09:05 - couple of things one is we could go down
09:10 - here and we could fill the screen with
09:13 - black but it might look nice
09:16 - if we were to just in our game over
09:21 - screen we were just to blit that
09:23 - background image on there so that when
09:26 - we first start we have the nice starry
09:31 - background and then when we also when we
09:34 - die we'll see that as well
09:45 - always a little hard hard to die when
09:47 - you want to okay there we go now see it
09:53 - drew the background and then the word so
09:56 - that erases whatever sprites were left
09:58 - around there okay so that's our game
10:05 - over screen so this is a pretty simple
10:07 - implementation of the game over screen
10:10 - but it's good enough for our purposes
10:12 - right now so at this point our Moop game
10:17 - is pretty much complete it has all the
10:20 - pieces all the basic pieces it needs to
10:23 - do everything we wanted it to do from
10:25 - the beginning if we look we're at about
10:29 - 373 lines of code not too bad for all
10:33 - the functionality we have there's lots
10:36 - more you could add we haven't made the
10:39 - game very hard yet you could speed up
10:41 - the the meteors or add more of them you
10:46 - can slow the ship down or make the
10:49 - bullets smaller you could add some
10:52 - different kinds of power-ups that do
10:55 - they do different things you could add
10:58 - additional kinds of enemies we can have
11:02 - we could have a high score system where
11:04 - you keep track of the highest score that
11:06 - people have achieved and see whether you
11:08 - beat it or not you could have a you know
11:12 - a boss fight so that after a certain
11:14 - amount of time all the meteors disappear
11:16 - and another new type of sprite that's a
11:19 - big giant you know alien spaceship shows
11:22 - up and shoots back at you
11:24 - you could go pretty far with this and
11:27 - I'll leave that to you if you want to
11:29 - add you know try and add some of that
11:31 - stuff I'm going to call this game
11:34 - complete for now at least for the
11:35 - purposes of our of our tutorial here
11:38 - because what I like to do with the next
11:40 - set of videos is start making a
11:43 - different kind of game and then also
11:47 - cover some different techniques that we
11:49 - haven't covered yet in this one that you
11:52 - can always go back and apply to them one
11:54 - of them being to to clean up our code
11:57 - and make it a little more organized
11:59 - and you know break it up into parts that
12:01 - we don't have to scroll through all this
12:03 - graphics loading stuff and and things
12:06 - like that and we'll we'll cover those
12:08 - and you can always come back and once
12:11 - you see how they work
12:12 - add them back into your shmoop game as
12:14 - well alright thanks for watching
12:23 - you

hi this is game development with pygame and in this video we're going to wrap up our shmoop game by adding a game over screen and giving us the ability to play again in this video we're going to add a simple game over or title screen to our game so that when you start it up you know it doesn't start immediately like this immediately start playing and then also so that when we die and here I'll show you what happens so that you can be clear what I'm talking about one more life left okay and the game just exits right we'd like to be able to say game over press the key to play again something like that so that's what we're going to do this time around so if we go down here we have our game loop right this while running as long as running is true the game loop runs and when our lives run out we set running to false and the game is over so what we can do is basically we want the game to have two states either while this game loop is running it's either showing the game over screen or or it's playing the game one or the other okay so what I'm gonna do is make another variable for that called game over and that's going to determine whether we should show the game over screen or not okay and in this while running loop I'm just going to say if game over so what should we do if the game is over well we should show the game over screen and it should sit there and wait for the player to press a key to start the game so what I'm going to do is I'm just gonna say show game over screen and we'll define that in a second that's going to do the the waiting right so when they do Sakhi and the game over screen ends and we come back to right here we're gonna say the game game over is false that way we won't be showing it the next time through the loop but we have one other problem and that is that when the game ends say I'm playing the game and I run out of live so my score is something and my lives are zero well if I go to the game over screen that's fine but if I press the start again and I just switch game over to false then it's gonna try to run the loop but my lives are still going to be zero and my score is still going to be whatever it was I have to reset everything that's basically all of this stuff from here to there so setting up the empty groups for for all our different types of sprites spawning the player and spawning the starting mobs and setting the score 20 are all the things that we do when we start a new game so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna cut that and I'm gonna paste it right here so when we come back from the game over screen we're gonna do all of these things that that start a new game okay and then down here when we die when our lives run out right when our lives run out we want to set game over to true now because the game is over but not running equals false because that would make the whole program end okay so that's really all we need to make this happen except now that we need to define what show game over screen does well the shame show game over screen is just gonna have some some text on it and things so I'm gonna define that I'll go up here to where I have my other definitions and we'll go show game over screen okay so what are we gonna do on this screen well we're gonna draw some text so let's draw on to the screen the text we want to draw is will draw the title of our of our game and I think I'll make it LR font size so it stands out and I'm gonna put that at with over two so it's centered on the screen horizontally and I'm loaded at height over four so it's up here at the guy the top quarter of the screen okay then I'm also going to put a here some instructions right because when you start up a game you want to know what the controls are right so we'll tell him that tell the player what they need to do we can make this a little smaller and we're gonna put this at with over two as well but we're going to put the height over two so it's gonna be at the center of the screen here let me do that so you can see the whole line without getting too long and then the last thing that I want to put on the screen is I want to say press a key to begin and that we can make a little smaller even it's still centered but this is going to be at height times three three quarters all right so that way it's towards the bottom of the screen we'll flip the screen so that they can see it and now we need to just wait for them to press a key which means we want to start an infinite loop or I should say a while loop which continues until they press a key so let's set waiting equals true and say while waiting so as long as they're waiting we're gonna go ahead and and use our we'll just use our FPS clock to to control the speed of this loop and then we're just going to check what events have happened okay and the the events we want to check for there's actually two yes we want to wait for the player to press the key but we don't want to nor the clicking the X up in the corner of the window right but otherwise the player is trapped playing this game right down in our original loop we check for the quit event to let you quit out of the game we also want to check for the quit event in our on our game over screen so if the event dot type is PI game dot quit then we want to actually just quit the whole program we don't want to just end the loop and go back into our game ok and now we want the key so now there's a little trick here to now I could do key down like this to say yeah they pressed a key but here's the problem with that let's say that it I can press any key right so if let's say that the key that I pressed down was one of the arrow keys or the space key then I'm gonna push it down this loop is gonna end and the game is gonna start but that's gonna happen pretty quickly and I

I'm going to die here so we can make sure that it goes back to the new game properly and resets everything ok game over now notice that I didn't wipe the screen when we when we died and now we have

and add some of that stuff I'm going to call this game complete for now at least for the purposes of our of our tutorial here because what I like to do with the next set of videos is start making a different kind of game and then also cover some different techniques that we haven't covered yet in this one that you can always go back and apply to them one of them being to to clean up our code and make it a little more organized and you know break it up into parts that we don't have to scroll through all this graphics loading stuff and and things like that and we'll we'll cover those and you can always come back and once you see how they work add them back into your shmoop game as well alright thanks for watching you
