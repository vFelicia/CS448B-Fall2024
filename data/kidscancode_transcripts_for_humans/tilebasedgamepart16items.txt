00:00 - welcome back to game development with
00:02 - pygame this is part 16 of our zombie
00:06 - top-down shooter game and in this video
00:10 - we're going to be adding items to the
00:12 - game okay so we're gonna start adding
00:14 - some items that we can pick up and so I
00:18 - went on to open game art and I found
00:20 - this this tileset which has some really
00:25 - nice icons for various zombie related
00:28 - things I don't think we'll use all of
00:31 - these probably but I do I did like this
00:33 - little health kit here for this can be
00:37 - our health pickup so this is what this
00:39 - so this image is what we're gonna use
00:41 - for our health item that we're going to
00:44 - spawn okay so we just need to load that
00:49 - picture and so we're gonna go over here
00:53 - to our settings file and we're going to
00:55 - start defining some item properties now
01:03 - eventually you're gonna have different
01:05 - kinds of items that we're gonna spawn so
01:08 - planning ahead for that I'm gonna make a
01:11 - just a dictionary that's gonna list all
01:13 - the different item images that mean we
01:16 - might have so the one for health is
01:18 - going to be a health pack PNG okay and
01:22 - I've put that in the images folder so
01:26 - that we can load it and later we can add
01:28 - other types of item images here and so
01:31 - now we just need to go over into our
01:33 - load data and make sure we load that so
01:37 - we will go and add to our load data here
01:40 - we're gonna say for item in item images
01:46 - oh we need a list to hold them in so
01:58 - this is going to be a dictionary as well
02:01 - okay so we're gonna say item image is
02:08 - item is going to be load and then we're
02:16 - going to paths that join the image
02:19 - folder with the item or sorry with the
02:27 - item name which is in that dictionary .
02:33 - convert okay and then we have what we
02:39 - need okay now we need to go over and
02:44 - define the sprite for this okay we'll
02:48 - start with a generic sprite called item
02:53 - and if you're wondering how I did this
02:56 - this is an atom feature it's just
02:58 - basically got a snippet you can set up
03:01 - little shortcuts that will automatically
03:03 - paste in a chunk of code for you if you
03:08 - ever want to see how that works if you
03:10 - go up to your menu you can look at your
03:12 - snippets and here is where I've defined
03:17 - snippets this just says if I type in the
03:20 - word sprite it's gonna replace it with
03:23 - this code and I'll include a link below
03:28 - to the documentation for how you set up
03:30 - a an atom snippet if you're interested
03:33 - but I'm not going to spend this video
03:36 - talking about that but so we have a so
03:40 - we have an item class and we want that
03:44 - item to let's see we're going to pass it
03:50 - a position so when it finds it in the
03:53 - map file it knows where to spawn it and
03:55 - we're gonna have a type what type of
03:58 - item this is alright is it a health pack
03:59 - is it a weapon something like that and
04:02 - then the groups we're gonna have and
04:05 - game items group which we better go
04:09 - ahead and add while we're thinking about
04:11 - it so in def new we can create our items
04:18 - group
04:20 - oops and then now we can set our image
04:26 - and our image is just going to be the
04:34 - matching image for whatever type we're
04:38 - using we're gonna store what type we
04:45 - have so we can keep that handy hope I
04:49 - just noticed I didn't do let's see where
04:52 - do I want to put this except a game
04:56 - whose game I want to have that there all
05:02 - right we've got our type we're gonna set
05:04 - our rec center at the position that we
05:08 - said to put it out and I think that is
05:13 - it to start with okay so now we can go
05:21 - over to our tile map loading code and
05:24 - create one of these things whenever we
05:28 - detect one of them in the tile map so if
05:34 - we go over to there so here's where
05:37 - we're finding our players and our walls
05:40 - and our obstacles and so on and actually
05:44 - let's go over to our town map our tiled
05:47 - map for a second first so here we're
05:50 - just going to add another object to our
05:54 - obstacles layer and we're gonna make
05:58 - that be where we want our health pack to
06:00 - spawn so I'm just gonna copy this player
06:03 - one for the moment I just want to make
06:06 - my I'm just gonna make the health pack
06:07 - spawn right here right by where we we
06:09 - spawn because I want to be able to test
06:11 - out and this isn't gonna be a good
06:13 - permanent location for it but it's good
06:15 - enough so we're gonna call this health
06:19 - so now we know we're going to spawn a
06:21 - health right here in this square so now
06:26 - we can go back over to here and we can
06:32 - look for spawning it but before we do
06:36 - that I want to point out one other thing
06:37 - if you notice when we run this game see
06:41 - how the player is spawning right there
06:43 - but in the map I have them centered on
06:47 - this square that's because when we read
06:51 - the map file we're defining the x and y
06:54 - of the object that's this corner right
06:56 - here right so if I want the player
06:59 - centered in the square I can do that
07:02 - right or to be a little bit cleaner we
07:07 - can say use we can change it so we're
07:09 - using the center of the box like when we
07:13 - spawn the zombie over here and anything
07:15 - else that way I can know that I'm going
07:18 - to be standing where I expect it to be
07:20 - or where it looks like I am when it's
07:21 - drawn on the map so let's go over here
07:25 - and set our we're gonna calculate the
07:28 - object center okay and that's just going
07:31 - to be the tile object x plus its width
07:39 - divided by two and then the tile objects
07:43 - y plus the height divided by two okay so
07:51 - we do that and let's make this a little
07:55 - cleaner there we go now we can just
07:59 - spawn it at the object center instead of
08:05 - right so it just follow this at the
08:07 - object center X&Y and we spawn the
08:11 - zombie at the object center dot Y okay x
08:18 - and y I mean so that's a little better
08:20 - so now when we run it yeah see I'm
08:23 - standing at the center of the square
08:26 - okay so let's spawn our health item
08:31 - so here if it's a tile object name and
08:37 - I'm going to list in here it's it's in
08:41 - this list of items that it could be so
08:44 - we'll just add other types of items that
08:46 - we might find okay so but if it's a
08:49 - health then we're gonna spawn an item
08:51 - and pass it the game the position is
08:57 - just going to be objects enter and the
09:02 - type is going to be Talib duck named
09:06 - right so the name is health it's going
09:09 - to pass it health as the type and when
09:13 - it spawns the item over here type will
09:15 - be set to health it'll load the health
09:17 - picture so there we go
09:22 - okay so there's the little health pack
09:25 - ready for us to go and pick up so I just
09:33 - noticed one other things we want to do
09:34 - is let's add an items layer for where
09:39 - we're gonna draw the items so we make
09:41 - sure that they're being drawn below the
09:43 - player so we can go here to our class
09:47 - item another little thing that I need to
09:50 - so layer you those items layer okay so
09:57 - that way we're sure that when we draw
10:02 - things the player will be above the item
10:06 - and so will the zombies nothing that we
10:08 - cover it up by the items okay let's pick
10:14 - it up so down here we're going to add a
10:18 - collision check player hits items so
10:27 - we're going to use sprite collide here
10:28 - between the self dot player
10:33 - items and now should we do true or false
10:37 - well you'd think we might want to do
10:40 - true here because when we run over the
10:42 - sprite we want to pick it up so we're
10:46 - gonna want to delete it but what if our
10:49 - health is full your health is full I
10:51 - don't want to pick up the health pack I
10:55 - wanted to stay there so if I have health
10:58 - lesson zero I'm going to leave it so
10:59 - let's not delete it here what we'll do
11:01 - is say if we hit one so if hit dot type
11:08 - equals health so if we hit a health pack
11:11 - and our and the players health is less
11:16 - than whatever its maximum is okay so if
11:21 - we have less than maximum health
11:22 - then we'll delete it and we will add to
11:29 - the players health so I'm gonna make a
11:32 - function in the player called add health
11:34 - and it's going to add however much a
11:36 - health pack is worth health pack amount
11:45 - so we go over here and set that let's
11:55 - say 20 ok so we're going to add health
11:59 - 20 so we'll go over to sprites here and
12:01 - in the player we're going to add a
12:06 - function for that for whatever amount so
12:13 - we're going to take our health plus
12:16 - equals amount but if health is greater
12:24 - than our maximum health then we're going
12:27 - to cap it at that
12:32 - okay so if we get too much that way now
12:35 - oops
12:35 - gonna go over to the main my health is
12:40 - full I should not be able to pick it up
12:42 - but I'll let the zombie hit me a couple
12:44 - of times now I picked it up and I'm
12:47 - healed okay very nice let's look at that
12:52 - again now one thing we might want to do
12:56 - or one thing else that we might want to
12:58 - do with items is make them stand out a
13:00 - little bit more right now they're sort
13:03 - of they could blend into the background
13:05 - depending on where they are if they're
13:06 - in a busy room or something they might
13:08 - be hard to spot that they're not part of
13:11 - the background so what I'd like to do is
13:13 - make the health items just Bob up and
13:17 - down a little bit but for that we need
13:22 - to tackle a new topic called easing and
13:27 - we're already getting kind of long for
13:28 - this video so I will take that to the
13:31 - next video as always thanks so much for
13:35 - watching and subscribing if you hit the
13:39 - like button below I'd really appreciate
13:40 - it and helps us find more subscribers
13:42 - and get more people learning PI game
13:45 - thanks and I'll see you in the next
13:47 - video
13:55 - you
