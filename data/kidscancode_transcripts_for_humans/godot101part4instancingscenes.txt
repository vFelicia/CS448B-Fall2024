00:00 - welcome to part four of good
00:03 - 101 in this video we will be talking
00:06 - about taking a scene that you have
00:07 - created and showing you how to instance
00:11 - it or create multiple instances of it as
00:14 - always if you haven't watched the
00:15 - previous videos please go back and do
00:17 - that before watching this one because we
00:19 - are building on the things we've made
00:21 - before all right let's get
00:24 - started okay here's our bouncing
00:26 - Sprite and it's all working well but now
00:30 - the question is what if we want to make
00:32 - a bunch of these what if I want to spawn
00:34 - multiple of these Sprites and have them
00:37 - all bouncing around the
00:39 - screen well you might think you could go
00:41 - over here and just duplicate this node
00:44 - right so if I right click on this and
00:46 - say
00:47 - duplicate oh now I'm going to get this
00:49 - error and I'll zoom in a bit so you can
00:51 - read
00:52 - it the problem is that a scene is a tree
00:57 - right and there can only be one node
01:00 - that's the root of the tree or the one
01:01 - at the top this this node can have
01:04 - children things that are underneath it
01:06 - that are attached to it but it can't
01:08 - have something at the same level as it
01:11 - and we don't want to make another Sprite
01:14 - that's a child of this Sprite because
01:16 - then they would be joined together right
01:19 - the the child of this Sprite would use
01:21 - its position and all that kind of stuff
01:22 - I want another unique Sprite that is
01:25 - equivalent to this one but I don't want
01:27 - to go and make a bunch more Sprite
01:30 - scenes and and duplicate my code and all
01:32 - that kind of
01:33 - stuff well one of the powerful things
01:36 - about scenes and remember a scene is
01:38 - just a collection of nodes our scene
01:40 - here just has this one node but you
01:43 - could have a scene that could have you
01:45 - know multiple nodes in it and those
01:48 - those nodes together with any scripts
01:50 - that are attached to them can be thought
01:53 - of and actually are an object and if
01:56 - you've done objectoriented programming
01:58 - before you know that that allows you
02:01 - to create multiple of the same object to
02:05 - use that object as a definition for
02:06 - creating more and more objects of the
02:08 - same
02:09 - type and that's what we're going to do
02:10 - with this Sprite scene I'm going to
02:13 - write some code to have gdau just spawn
02:15 - a bunch of these Sprite scenes okay so
02:18 - to do that we're going to start by
02:19 - making another new
02:21 - scene I just click on scene new
02:24 - scene and to this scene I'm going to add
02:27 - a node and I'm just going to add the
02:30 - simplest node possible just a
02:33 - node node that's all I care about I just
02:35 - want this this is just a generic node
02:37 - has almost no properties at all but it's
02:40 - just there to serve as the root of my
02:43 - scene and I'm going to click on the name
02:45 - here and I'm going to call this main
02:47 - this is going to be my main scene so if
02:51 - I save it I'm going to save it with the
02:54 - name
02:55 - Main and then I'm going to hit not the
02:58 - play scene button but I'm going to hit
03:00 - this button this is to play the whole
03:02 - project and when you click on this it's
03:04 - going to say you haven't de defined a
03:07 - main
03:08 - scene which scene is the one that starts
03:11 - when you start the project so I'm going
03:14 - to say I want to do that right now so
03:16 - I'm going to click select and I'm going
03:17 - to select the main
03:19 - scene for that so now when I hit Play
03:23 - and play the project my main scene will
03:25 - open of course there's nothing in here
03:28 - just yet
03:30 - so now let's add a script to this right
03:33 - so we're going to add a script we're
03:35 - going to call it main. GD that's fine
03:40 - okay as usual let's remove our comments
03:44 - and we're ready to start coding okay and
03:47 - in this script we can have just like in
03:49 - our Sprite script we could have things
03:52 - that we can have variables we can have
03:54 - uh things that happen when the scene
03:57 - comes into existence
04:00 - in the ready and we could have the
04:03 - underscore process function do things
04:05 - every frame any of that stuff what we
04:08 - want to do is we want to have we want to
04:11 - have a reference to that Sprite scene
04:15 - let's save this sprite. tscn okay now I
04:18 - could do this I'm going to show you what
04:20 - we're going to do let's call this we'll
04:22 - just call this Sprite we want to load
04:25 - this Sprite scene that's saved this one
04:27 - over here as the file we're going to use
04:30 - the preload
04:31 - function okay and what the preload
04:34 - function does is it lets you name some
04:37 - resource and this is the one we want and
04:41 - so I could rightclick on this and choose
04:43 - copy
04:44 - path and then if I go over here and hit
04:47 - paste this is the path to that Sprite
04:51 - scene
04:52 - file and all the resources that you have
04:55 - in your in your gido project are going
04:57 - to be listed like this starts out with
05:00 - Rees which stands for
05:01 - resource uh and just like a URL on the
05:04 - web colon SL slash and then the path to
05:07 - the object in a more complicated project
05:11 - we might have lots and lots of files so
05:13 - we're going to have we would organize
05:15 - them into folders and you would just
05:18 - right if you had a a scenes folder you
05:22 - know you would put it like that but this
05:24 - will be the
05:26 - the this will load our scene
05:30 - and put it in this
05:32 - variable now the problem too that
05:34 - happens is
05:36 - that what order things happen in is
05:39 - important and you want to make sure that
05:41 - if you do something in the ready
05:43 - function that it is actually that it's
05:46 - actually been loaded and is ready to go
05:49 - and so we're going to put on ready
05:52 - here and what on ready
05:54 - does that's going to ensure that this
05:58 - variable is ready and has been loaded
06:00 - off the dis when we're in the ready
06:03 - function and it's not going to give us
06:05 - an error because it hasn't gotten around
06:06 - to doing it yet so in our ready function
06:10 - we just want to spawn a bunch of these
06:12 - and so to spawn one of these Sprites we
06:15 - would just
06:19 - say instance okay that's going to take
06:22 - this Sprite scene and create an instance
06:25 - of it if I hit play oh we don't see
06:29 - anything why is that well that's because
06:32 - we have created this Sprite instance so
06:35 - we've made one
06:36 - of these but we need to add it
06:40 - to our tree so we're going to say add
06:45 - child and that because we're running
06:48 - this on Main that's going to add it as a
06:49 - child of the main
06:52 - node and when we hit play now we have
06:56 - one
06:58 - Sprite and if you want to look we can go
07:01 - over here to the debugger you can
07:03 - actually see if you look at the remote
07:05 - inspector the remote inspector lets you
07:08 - look at the scenes and the nodes that
07:10 - are currently live that are running
07:12 - right now so if we look under here we
07:15 - have there's our main node and
07:17 - underneath of it is a Sprite if I click
07:19 - on Sprite you can
07:21 - see look at that as the position is
07:24 - changing and the rotation is changing as
07:27 - it runs around
07:30 - screen so now if we want to spawn more
07:33 - of these we can just put this in a loop
07:35 - so if I just say for I in range let's
07:38 - just count to 10 and I'm going to put
07:41 - this in a loop so we're just going to
07:43 - count to 10 and
07:45 - add a bunch of sprite nodes to
07:49 - the scene and there you go it just
07:51 - spawned 10 of them and they're all going
07:54 - to do what they're supposed to do and we
07:57 - can look real quick here just to show
07:59 - show you what happens in the tree now if
08:02 - we look at our tree we can see we've got
08:05 - make this a little bigger we've got
08:08 - 10 Sprite
08:11 - children and gdau went ahead and auton
08:14 - named them because they all have to have
08:16 - unique
08:18 - names but they're all and we can click
08:20 - on them and inspect them and see what
08:22 - they're all
08:24 - doing and what's cool is we can actually
08:27 - do that with
08:30 - quite a lot of
08:32 - them right it'll work totally
08:36 - fine and that's it and as we get further
08:40 - into good development that's how you're
08:42 - going to see we're going to do things
08:44 - like bullets and mobs and things like
08:47 - that where you're just going to set up a
08:49 - scene that describes all the
08:51 - functionality of how any particular
08:54 - object in your game works and then in
08:58 - whatever scene you want them to appear
09:00 - you're just going to instance them as
09:03 - you need
09:04 - them do various things with them
09:06 - whatever you want to
09:08 - do that'll do it for this video in the
09:10 - next one we will start looking at some
09:12 - of the other node types and some of the
09:15 - things you can do with them so I'll see
09:17 - you next time thanks for
09:28 - watching

Cleaned transcript:

welcome to part four of good 101 in this video we will be talking about taking a scene that you have created and showing you how to instance it or create multiple instances of it as always if you haven't watched the previous videos please go back and do that before watching this one because we are building on the things we've made before all right let's get started okay here's our bouncing Sprite and it's all working well but now the question is what if we want to make a bunch of these what if I want to spawn multiple of these Sprites and have them all bouncing around the screen well you might think you could go over here and just duplicate this node right so if I right click on this and say duplicate oh now I'm going to get this error and I'll zoom in a bit so you can read it the problem is that a scene is a tree right and there can only be one node that's the root of the tree or the one at the top this this node can have children things that are underneath it that are attached to it but it can't have something at the same level as it and we don't want to make another Sprite that's a child of this Sprite because then they would be joined together right the the child of this Sprite would use its position and all that kind of stuff I want another unique Sprite that is equivalent to this one but I don't want to go and make a bunch more Sprite scenes and and duplicate my code and all that kind of stuff well one of the powerful things about scenes and remember a scene is just a collection of nodes our scene here just has this one node but you could have a scene that could have you know multiple nodes in it and those those nodes together with any scripts that are attached to them can be thought of and actually are an object and if you've done objectoriented programming before you know that that allows you to create multiple of the same object to use that object as a definition for creating more and more objects of the same type and that's what we're going to do with this Sprite scene I'm going to write some code to have gdau just spawn a bunch of these Sprite scenes okay so to do that we're going to start by making another new scene I just click on scene new scene and to this scene I'm going to add a node and I'm just going to add the simplest node possible just a node node that's all I care about I just want this this is just a generic node has almost no properties at all but it's just there to serve as the root of my scene and I'm going to click on the name here and I'm going to call this main this is going to be my main scene so if I save it I'm going to save it with the name Main and then I'm going to hit not the play scene button but I'm going to hit this button this is to play the whole project and when you click on this it's going to say you haven't de defined a main scene which scene is the one that starts when you start the project so I'm going to say I want to do that right now so I'm going to click select and I'm going to select the main scene for that so now when I hit Play and play the project my main scene will open of course there's nothing in here just yet so now let's add a script to this right so we're going to add a script we're going to call it main. GD that's fine okay as usual let's remove our comments and we're ready to start coding okay and in this script we can have just like in our Sprite script we could have things that we can have variables we can have uh things that happen when the scene comes into existence in the ready and we could have the underscore process function do things every frame any of that stuff what we want to do is we want to have we want to have a reference to that Sprite scene let's save this sprite. tscn okay now I could do this I'm going to show you what we're going to do let's call this we'll just call this Sprite we want to load this Sprite scene that's saved this one over here as the file we're going to use the preload function okay and what the preload function does is it lets you name some resource and this is the one we want and so I could rightclick on this and choose copy path and then if I go over here and hit paste this is the path to that Sprite scene file and all the resources that you have in your in your gido project are going to be listed like this starts out with Rees which stands for resource uh and just like a URL on the web colon SL slash and then the path to the object in a more complicated project we might have lots and lots of files so we're going to have we would organize them into folders and you would just right if you had a a scenes folder you know you would put it like that but this will be the the this will load our scene and put it in this variable now the problem too that happens is that what order things happen in is important and you want to make sure that if you do something in the ready function that it is actually that it's actually been loaded and is ready to go and so we're going to put on ready here and what on ready does that's going to ensure that this variable is ready and has been loaded off the dis when we're in the ready function and it's not going to give us an error because it hasn't gotten around to doing it yet so in our ready function we just want to spawn a bunch of these and so to spawn one of these Sprites we would just say instance okay that's going to take this Sprite scene and create an instance of it if I hit play oh we don't see anything why is that well that's because we have created this Sprite instance so we've made one of these but we need to add it to our tree so we're going to say add child and that because we're running this on Main that's going to add it as a child of the main node and when we hit play now we have one Sprite and if you want to look we can go over here to the debugger you can actually see if you look at the remote inspector the remote inspector lets you look at the scenes and the nodes that are currently live that are running right now so if we look under here we have there's our main node and underneath of it is a Sprite if I click on Sprite you can see look at that as the position is changing and the rotation is changing as it runs around screen so now if we want to spawn more of these we can just put this in a loop so if I just say for I in range let's just count to 10 and I'm going to put this in a loop so we're just going to count to 10 and add a bunch of sprite nodes to the scene and there you go it just spawned 10 of them and they're all going to do what they're supposed to do and we can look real quick here just to show show you what happens in the tree now if we look at our tree we can see we've got make this a little bigger we've got 10 Sprite children and gdau went ahead and auton named them because they all have to have unique names but they're all and we can click on them and inspect them and see what they're all doing and what's cool is we can actually do that with quite a lot of them right it'll work totally fine and that's it and as we get further into good development that's how you're going to see we're going to do things like bullets and mobs and things like that where you're just going to set up a scene that describes all the functionality of how any particular object in your game works and then in whatever scene you want them to appear you're just going to instance them as you need them do various things with them whatever you want to do that'll do it for this video in the next one we will start looking at some of the other node types and some of the things you can do with them so I'll see you next time thanks for watching
