00:00 - welcome back to game development with
00:02 - pygame this is part 7 of our tile based
00:05 - game and in this episode we're going to
00:08 - add mobs some zombies to chase our
00:11 - player around all right in the last
00:16 - video we made our character be able to
00:20 - run around the screen using the arrow
00:23 - keys to turn and the up arrow to move
00:25 - forward and we can also walk backwards
00:28 - and we can run around our map colliding
00:32 - with the walls and it's all working good
00:35 - it's nice and responsive and I think for
00:40 - the next step the first thing we're
00:42 - gonna do is just make this look a little
00:44 - better the grid is a little distracting
00:49 - to look at right now so let's paint the
00:50 - ground and let's change the walls and
00:53 - just use some placeholder graphics for
00:55 - the walls that'll make them a little
00:57 - more interesting than this plain old
00:59 - filled green square alright and also
01:04 - when I mentioned that it's responsive
01:07 - something that you run into a lot when
01:09 - you're building a game is you start
01:12 - adding features and adding features and
01:13 - you add things that you had things and
01:14 - then suddenly things start getting slow
01:17 - and it's a really good idea to keep an
01:20 - eye on while you're while you're
01:24 - developing keep an eye on how the
01:26 - performance is going and one way you can
01:27 - do that is to just keep track of your
01:29 - FPS so what I like to do is just in my
01:34 - loop and we'll stick it in the draw
01:36 - section just for a while we're
01:39 - developing you're going to take this out
01:40 - when you're done we're just going to set
01:43 - the caption of the window to be the
01:46 - frame rate now the frame rate is going
01:48 - to be a decimal number so we want to
01:52 - format this so we don't have to see you
01:55 - know 80 digits after the decimal point
01:59 - and then so we're going to format that
02:02 - to be just two digits and the command to
02:06 - get the FPS is get FPS
02:12 - all right so that lets us just keep
02:14 - track as we're running and see that we
02:17 - are averaging around 60 frames per
02:20 - second still which is good that's what
02:21 - we want to see and we can see that if we
02:24 - add a feature and it suddenly starts
02:26 - dropping that then we'll know we'll at
02:29 - least have an idea what to look at at
02:31 - the beginning before we get fancier with
02:35 - optimizing and everything like that all
02:37 - right so let's do the graphics so I'm
02:43 - going to go over here to my settings
02:45 - file and just how just like we're
02:49 - listing what image we're going to use
02:52 - for the for the player I'm just going to
02:56 - keep all of this stuff in the same kind
02:59 - of format we're going to say the wall
03:02 - sorry wall image is going to be tile
03:07 - green 39 dot PNG and what's that well
03:12 - that's just a picture picture I went and
03:15 - found I'll show you what it looks like
03:18 - it's just a little square I think it's
03:20 - from the Kenney puzzle pack for making
03:24 - puzzle games and things but this will
03:25 - look nice and at least look better than
03:29 - our plain green squares but what you'll
03:32 - notice is that this image is a hundred
03:35 - and eight pixels by a hundred and eight
03:36 - pixels which is not the right size for
03:38 - our wall so when we go over here to our
03:43 - main we're going to load the image so
03:48 - we're going to duplicate this line and
03:50 - we're gonna make this the wall image and
03:54 - we're gonna use the wall image and then
03:59 - we're going to take that wall image and
04:02 - we're going to resize it
04:11 - we're just going to say scale the wall
04:15 - image and the size we want to scale it
04:18 - to is tile size by a tile size okay then
04:24 - we can go into our sprites here and in
04:28 - our wall sprite we can get rid of our
04:32 - green fill and here we can change this
04:40 - to wall image and that's gonna look a
04:45 - little bit nicer yeah so now our walls
04:50 - or at least something interesting to
04:52 - look at and now you notice also that we
04:56 - have that layering problem you know some
04:58 - of the walls are drawn above my player
05:02 - and some of them are drawn below it I
05:05 - think I would like for them all to be
05:07 - drawn below it like this doesn't look
05:10 - right all right so we can set up some
05:14 - layering for that as well and I think
05:17 - we'll also go over here to the main and
05:19 - we're sorry we'll go to the settings and
05:22 - we're gonna make the background color
05:25 - something a little nicer I'm gonna put a
05:30 - brown color in here and by the way if
05:36 - you're wondering where I got that where
05:39 - I got those numbers for the color RGB
05:40 - for the colour there is a colour picker
05:45 - plug-in for for Adam that's really nice
05:50 - it'll just go ahead and let you go and
05:53 - grab whatever image or sorry whatever
05:55 - color you want and show you what the RGB
05:59 - is for that and you can even insert it
06:00 - right into your code super handy so
06:04 - we're just gonna make the background
06:06 - color be brown just so we have a ground
06:10 - oh and then I also wanted to I'm just
06:14 - going to temporarily comment this out
06:18 - just in case we want to see the grid
06:20 - again sometime we can we can turn that
06:22 - back on so we can make sure you know
06:25 - things are working right but this looks
06:27 - a little better at least we have a plain
06:30 - background to run around on all right
06:43 - you
06:56 - okay so now we are ready let's add some
07:00 - mobs to this game so we're gonna go over
07:03 - to our classes over here and we're gonna
07:06 - add a class mob okay now I'm gonna grab
07:12 - just gonna copy some of this code here
07:16 - alright now when we spawn our mob we're
07:26 - gonna just like we do with everything
07:27 - else tell it the XY where it's going to
07:29 - be spawned we're gonna add it to a mobs
07:36 - group and then we need an image and we
07:40 - have an image for the mob it comes in
07:42 - the same art pack as the player it's a
07:44 - little zombie so we're going to use this
07:47 - little zombie guy back over here to our
07:50 - settings we're going to have a lot of
07:54 - different settings for our mobs so
08:00 - starting with the mob image zombie one
08:07 - underscore hold dot PNG that's an
08:11 - underscore alright and other stuff that
08:17 - we will put in there later so our image
08:23 - is going to be mob image get rekt and
08:32 - our location is just going to be where
08:39 - we are x tosses
08:45 - alright so that's going to be enough to
08:48 - spawn our mob so let's go over here and
08:52 - make sure we have our in our new that we
08:58 - have our mobs group
09:01 - and we can open up our map and let's
09:08 - just spawn a mob right here by the
09:11 - player all right so we need to load our
09:18 - mob image so we will just duplicate that
09:24 - we'll change this to mob image and we
09:32 - need to say here that when we when we
09:36 - find an M when we find the tile with an
09:38 - M in it we're gonna spawn a mob all
09:44 - right I think that's everything
09:46 - oh I just realized we forgot one other
09:48 - thing which is we figured out where we
09:50 - were we need to put our rectangle there
09:54 - all right just put ourselves at the
09:56 - location or but the pazham be I should
09:59 - say all right so there is our zombie
10:03 - okay ready to chase us around the screen
10:12 - now there's all sorts of ways to get
10:15 - this you know that we could decide to
10:18 - have this mob behave right does it chase
10:21 - after the player does it walk around
10:23 - randomly do we you know pac-man style
10:26 - assign a a path to it that is gonna walk
10:29 - that if you can avoid it you can avoid
10:31 - it all sorts of things we can do and at
10:35 - some point we'll get to a few of those
10:39 - and talk about how we do them but to
10:41 - start with right now with the time we
10:43 - have left for this video let's just make
10:46 - the zombie before we make a move let's
10:48 - just make it turn and always point at
10:50 - the player okay so that means we want
10:52 - the zombie to rotate so we're going to
10:55 - give it a rotation value right starts
10:58 - out zero degrees it's pointing to the
11:00 - right just like our player was when it
11:02 - started all right and what we need to do
11:06 - is when the mob updates it needs to see
11:10 - where the player is and figure out what
11:12 - angle it needs to rotate to
11:15 - to point at the player so let's look at
11:18 - a little picture so let's look at this
11:21 - diagram so we have a mob and a player
11:24 - each sprite has a position vector that
11:28 - position vector is its location on the
11:30 - screen right this this position vector
11:32 - is pointing from the origin right
11:35 - because if the mob is at an X of 5 and a
11:39 - Y of 1 then he's 5 over and 1 down right
11:43 - so this vector is pointing at the mobs
11:44 - location and the player's position
11:46 - vector is pointing at the players
11:48 - position so if we take player position
11:52 - and we subtract mob position what we get
11:56 - is we will get the vector that connects
11:59 - those two locations if I had done it the
12:03 - other way around mob pause - player
12:05 - pause then we would have the arrow
12:07 - pointing in this direction we would find
12:09 - the direction vector from the player to
12:12 - the mob but this is the one we want
12:13 - right we want the vector pointing from
12:15 - the mob to the player so once we have
12:20 - that direction vector just by
12:22 - subtracting these two we have that
12:23 - vector what we want to know is what is
12:26 - this angle what is this angle from the x
12:30 - axis then we know how far to turn our
12:33 - zombie and as our player moves around
12:36 - this angle will change and will change
12:37 - how our zombie is facing so the way we
12:42 - do that is we need to find the angle to
12:44 - the x axis and then another way to look
12:46 - at the x axis is it's a vector just
12:49 - pointing in the X direction so it has an
12:52 - X component and no y component so the
12:55 - angle between two vectors is very easy
12:57 - to find there is a vector command to
13:00 - just tell you what it is you give it two
13:02 - vectors it tells you what the angle
13:03 - between them is so we have a way to find
13:06 - out how to point at our player okay so
13:11 - let's just update our angle our rotation
13:14 - angle is going to be that direction
13:16 - vector so the players position minus our
13:22 - position oops
13:25 - and I just notice we did not
13:30 - so to save our game there we go alright
13:36 - so there's our direction vector right
13:38 - player position - mob position and now
13:43 - we to find out the angle we have we take
13:45 - our direction vector and we save dot
13:47 - angle - and then we say what vector we
13:50 - want want to find the angle - well we
13:51 - want to find the angle to that x-axis
13:55 - Direction vector right and so that will
13:59 - now tell us our angle and we just like
14:02 - we did with our player we can now just
14:04 - rotate we can just rotate that vector or
14:11 - that image the mob image by the rotation
14:17 - vector we get our new rectangle and we
14:23 - make sure we update our center of our
14:27 - rectangle to stay at our position all
14:31 - right let's try it
14:34 - there's my mob look he's pointing at me
14:37 - and as I move around he is always going
14:40 - to point at me right so as my player
14:47 - moves that direction vector is changing
14:50 - and we're calculating at every frame
14:53 - which means when I run by him he's going
14:56 - to turn really fast but that's ok
14:59 - because we're gonna be running away soon
15:05 - all right and now you'll see we could
15:08 - even go into our map and add some more
15:13 - mobs let's add a couple more just so
15:19 - that we can see how they are all going
15:24 - to track the player oops I made that one
15:28 - spawn inside the wall because he's
15:30 - centered
15:34 - I'm sorry he's not centered but his
15:37 - position is using the corner of the wall
15:39 - which will have to change soon but there
15:44 - we go so now you can see how wherever I
15:48 - go every mob is always chasing me very
15:53 - spooky
15:55 - these are some perceptive zombies okay
16:06 - so we're gonna stop there for this video
16:08 - and in the next video we can start
16:11 - having the mobs actually move and chase
16:15 - our player around as always please hit
16:18 - the like button below it helps a lot and
16:22 - subscribe if you haven't already and
16:24 - I'll see you in the next video thanks
16:35 - you

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back to game development with pygame this is part 7 of our tile based game and in this episode we're going to add mobs some zombies to chase our player around all right in the last video we made our character be able to run around the screen using the arrow keys to turn and the up arrow to move forward and we can also walk backwards and we can run around our map colliding with the walls and it's all working good it's nice and responsive and I think for the next step the first thing we're gonna do is just make this look a little better the grid is a little distracting to look at right now so let's paint the ground and let's change the walls and just use some placeholder graphics for the walls that'll make them a little more interesting than this plain old filled green square alright and also when I mentioned that it's responsive something that you run into a lot when you're building a game is you start adding features and adding features and you add things that you had things and then suddenly things start getting slow and it's a really good idea to keep an eye on while you're while you're developing keep an eye on how the performance is going and one way you can do that is to just keep track of your FPS so what I like to do is just in my loop and we'll stick it in the draw section just for a while we're developing you're going to take this out when you're done we're just going to set the caption of the window to be the frame rate now the frame rate is going to be a decimal number so we want to format this so we don't have to see you know 80 digits after the decimal point and then so we're going to format that to be just two digits and the command to get the FPS is get FPS all right so that lets us just keep track as we're running and see that we are averaging around 60 frames per second still which is good that's what we want to see and we can see that if we add a feature and it suddenly starts dropping that then we'll know we'll at least have an idea what to look at at the beginning before we get fancier with optimizing and everything like that all right so let's do the graphics so I'm going to go over here to my settings file and just how just like we're listing what image we're going to use for the for the player I'm just going to keep all of this stuff in the same kind of format we're going to say the wall sorry wall image is going to be tile green 39 dot PNG and what's that well that's just a picture picture I went and found I'll show you what it looks like it's just a little square I think it's from the Kenney puzzle pack for making puzzle games and things but this will look nice and at least look better than our plain green squares but what you'll notice is that this image is a hundred and eight pixels by a hundred and eight pixels which is not the right size for our wall so when we go over here to our main we're going to load the image so we're going to duplicate this line and we're gonna make this the wall image and we're gonna use the wall image and then we're going to take that wall image and we're going to resize it we're just going to say scale the wall image and the size we want to scale it to is tile size by a tile size okay then we can go into our sprites here and in our wall sprite we can get rid of our green fill and here we can change this to wall image and that's gonna look a little bit nicer yeah so now our walls or at least something interesting to look at and now you notice also that we have that layering problem you know some of the walls are drawn above my player and some of them are drawn below it I think I would like for them all to be drawn below it like this doesn't look right all right so we can set up some layering for that as well and I think we'll also go over here to the main and we're sorry we'll go to the settings and we're gonna make the background color something a little nicer I'm gonna put a brown color in here and by the way if you're wondering where I got that where I got those numbers for the color RGB for the colour there is a colour picker plugin for for Adam that's really nice it'll just go ahead and let you go and grab whatever image or sorry whatever color you want and show you what the RGB is for that and you can even insert it right into your code super handy so we're just gonna make the background color be brown just so we have a ground oh and then I also wanted to I'm just going to temporarily comment this out just in case we want to see the grid again sometime we can we can turn that back on so we can make sure you know things are working right but this looks a little better at least we have a plain background to run around on all right you okay so now we are ready let's add some mobs to this game so we're gonna go over to our classes over here and we're gonna add a class mob okay now I'm gonna grab just gonna copy some of this code here alright now when we spawn our mob we're gonna just like we do with everything else tell it the XY where it's going to be spawned we're gonna add it to a mobs group and then we need an image and we have an image for the mob it comes in the same art pack as the player it's a little zombie so we're going to use this little zombie guy back over here to our settings we're going to have a lot of different settings for our mobs so starting with the mob image zombie one underscore hold dot PNG that's an underscore alright and other stuff that we will put in there later so our image is going to be mob image get rekt and our location is just going to be where we are x tosses alright so that's going to be enough to spawn our mob so let's go over here and make sure we have our in our new that we have our mobs group and we can open up our map and let's just spawn a mob right here by the player all right so we need to load our mob image so we will just duplicate that we'll change this to mob image and we need to say here that when we when we find an M when we find the tile with an M in it we're gonna spawn a mob all right I think that's everything oh I just realized we forgot one other thing which is we figured out where we were we need to put our rectangle there all right just put ourselves at the location or but the pazham be I should say all right so there is our zombie okay ready to chase us around the screen now there's all sorts of ways to get this you know that we could decide to have this mob behave right does it chase after the player does it walk around randomly do we you know pacman style assign a a path to it that is gonna walk that if you can avoid it you can avoid it all sorts of things we can do and at some point we'll get to a few of those and talk about how we do them but to start with right now with the time we have left for this video let's just make the zombie before we make a move let's just make it turn and always point at the player okay so that means we want the zombie to rotate so we're going to give it a rotation value right starts out zero degrees it's pointing to the right just like our player was when it started all right and what we need to do is when the mob updates it needs to see where the player is and figure out what angle it needs to rotate to to point at the player so let's look at a little picture so let's look at this diagram so we have a mob and a player each sprite has a position vector that position vector is its location on the screen right this this position vector is pointing from the origin right because if the mob is at an X of 5 and a Y of 1 then he's 5 over and 1 down right so this vector is pointing at the mobs location and the player's position vector is pointing at the players position so if we take player position and we subtract mob position what we get is we will get the vector that connects those two locations if I had done it the other way around mob pause player pause then we would have the arrow pointing in this direction we would find the direction vector from the player to the mob but this is the one we want right we want the vector pointing from the mob to the player so once we have that direction vector just by subtracting these two we have that vector what we want to know is what is this angle what is this angle from the x axis then we know how far to turn our zombie and as our player moves around this angle will change and will change how our zombie is facing so the way we do that is we need to find the angle to the x axis and then another way to look at the x axis is it's a vector just pointing in the X direction so it has an X component and no y component so the angle between two vectors is very easy to find there is a vector command to just tell you what it is you give it two vectors it tells you what the angle between them is so we have a way to find out how to point at our player okay so let's just update our angle our rotation angle is going to be that direction vector so the players position minus our position oops and I just notice we did not so to save our game there we go alright so there's our direction vector right player position mob position and now we to find out the angle we have we take our direction vector and we save dot angle and then we say what vector we want want to find the angle well we want to find the angle to that xaxis Direction vector right and so that will now tell us our angle and we just like we did with our player we can now just rotate we can just rotate that vector or that image the mob image by the rotation vector we get our new rectangle and we make sure we update our center of our rectangle to stay at our position all right let's try it there's my mob look he's pointing at me and as I move around he is always going to point at me right so as my player moves that direction vector is changing and we're calculating at every frame which means when I run by him he's going to turn really fast but that's ok because we're gonna be running away soon all right and now you'll see we could even go into our map and add some more mobs let's add a couple more just so that we can see how they are all going to track the player oops I made that one spawn inside the wall because he's centered I'm sorry he's not centered but his position is using the corner of the wall which will have to change soon but there we go so now you can see how wherever I go every mob is always chasing me very spooky these
