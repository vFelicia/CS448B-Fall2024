00:00 - welcome back this is part three of our
00:02 - look at the Godot tile map node this
00:07 - time around we're going to be looking at
00:09 - how to do animated tiles which is
00:11 - something a lot of people have requested
00:13 - and also how to work with isometric tile
00:17 - Maps okay
00:19 - let's get started so to start with I've
00:22 - selected this tile set from open game
00:26 - art which have some animated tiles to do
00:30 - some shimmering water effects I'm not
00:33 - going to bother with the waterfalls too
00:35 - many top to deal with so we're just
00:36 - going to make a little island with some
00:39 - shimmering water around it so go ahead
00:42 - and grab this from open game art I'll
00:44 - have the link below now I've actually
00:46 - gone ahead and sliced all these into
00:49 - individual tiles you don't have to do
00:52 - that you can use you can use the region
00:55 - rectangle to define which parts you want
00:58 - in your sprites I did that because I
00:59 - wanted some flexibility to show you some
01:01 - different things to do so I just thought
01:04 - it was gonna be useful to have some
01:05 - different tiles so I basically took all
01:08 - these sprites and I just drag them into
01:11 - the window here to get my start making
01:14 - my tile set so these are all the island
01:17 - ones I don't care about those but this
01:19 - one water one or two and water three
01:23 - these two these three are the ones that
01:25 - I'm going to animate so in the folder I
01:30 - have water one has five frames of
01:33 - animation what or two has five frames of
01:35 - animation and what it three has five
01:36 - frames of animation so each of these is
01:38 - the first frame of its animation okay so
01:44 - just save that and convert it into a
01:48 - tile set like normal and then we'll be
01:51 - able to go over and make our tile map
01:54 - okay here's a tile map and I've just
01:56 - drawn out a little island and then you
01:59 - see I've used the water one water too
02:01 - and water three tiles and place them in
02:03 - a few places around the island where I
02:06 - want the shimmering water to appear now
02:10 - I've also added if you notice when we
02:12 - run this these
02:13 - files are fairly small so the picture is
02:15 - going to be small so I've added a camera
02:17 - to D just so that we will zoom in use
02:22 - that to zoom in a little so we can see
02:23 - the map a little bit better when we run
02:26 - it now we're going to add an animation
02:29 - player to our scene and this is what
02:34 - we're going to use animator tiles so
02:37 - we're going to create a new animation
02:40 - I'm just going to call it water and then
02:43 - we need to start adding tracks and I'm
02:45 - going to add a track for each of the
02:47 - three water tile animations that I want
02:51 - to do so let's do the first one so we go
02:54 - to our tile map and right here is where
02:58 - we've chosen our tile set that we're
03:00 - using and what our one is tile number
03:04 - zero in the set so if I click the right
03:07 - arrow here I can see all the individual
03:10 - tiles in the tile set and their
03:12 - properties and so for tile number zero
03:16 - its texture is what I want to animate so
03:18 - I'm going to click the key next to it to
03:20 - make a keyframe and now we have our
03:23 - first frame set now the length of our
03:27 - animation right now is one and our
03:31 - animation has five tiles so we should be
03:33 - fine I think if we just do two steps in
03:37 - between each one so now the second frame
03:41 - we want to go into our animated water
03:43 - and find what our one frame number two
03:48 - drop that in the texture hit a keyframe
03:53 - repeat again for the third one and
04:01 - repeat again for the fourth one don't
04:07 - forget to hit the key each time after
04:09 - you change the image and hit the key
04:14 - okay so there is our animation let's
04:17 - make it loop and hit play and there we
04:22 - go
04:22 - the places that I've put a
04:25 - water one tile are now showing the
04:29 - little animation and we're just going to
04:32 - repeat that for the other three and so
04:35 - here I've just done the same thing with
04:37 - the other two animated tiles and you can
04:41 - see they're each playing their animation
04:43 - if you anytime you add more of these
04:48 - you're going to see the animation on
04:50 - that tile because we're animating that
04:53 - tile in the tile set so it will be
04:55 - animated wherever it is so hopefully
04:58 - that helps you go and make some animated
05:00 - tiles in your tile map just for your
05:03 - information there is a second technique
05:06 - for doing this that uses a shader
05:09 - instead of the animation player I will
05:13 - probably be doing a video separately for
05:15 - that shaders are a whole separate topic
05:18 - of conversation so whenever that gets
05:21 - done I'll try and remember to link that
05:23 - below so you can check that out as well
05:26 - all right let's go on to isometric Maps
05:29 - the most complicated thing about an
05:31 - isometric map can be the art itself if
05:35 - you don't have a good art pack that
05:37 - hasn't been drawn in a consistent style
05:41 - and perspective it can get really
05:43 - difficult to to use it properly so for
05:47 - this demo I've selected Kenny's
05:50 - isometric tower descents art pack so all
05:54 - the tiles are now in the folder here and
05:57 - we just want to make our tile set and we
06:00 - can do that same way we've done our top
06:02 - sets before we're just going to drag all
06:07 - the sprites into the scene and they will
06:12 - get created with their correct names
06:15 - taken from the file name so they're easy
06:17 - to keep track of and that's all you got
06:19 - to do don't worry about anything else
06:21 - now one thing I will point out here is
06:24 - if we take a look at one of these tiles
06:26 - if you look at the texture the texture
06:29 - is 124 pixels wide and 123 pixels tall
06:34 - and that's how much
06:37 - the whole tile takes up and this is
06:40 - actually going to be true for all the
06:43 - tiles even the flat ones like this
06:45 - they're all the same size but the size
06:51 - of our grid is going to be based on this
06:54 - diamond-shaped portion here that's
06:57 - that's the grid part of your tile map
07:00 - and so you have to get the right setting
07:03 - on your tile map and we're going to talk
07:06 - about how to do that next so if we go
07:08 - over to our new scene and we add a tile
07:11 - map to it so we're going to change the
07:14 - mode to isometric and if you look at it
07:20 - now it doesn't look guy symmetric it
07:21 - looks like it's just top-down because we
07:24 - need to change the size well let's load
07:28 - our tile set so we can see what's going
07:29 - to happen when we use it so I'm going to
07:34 - go and grab my top-down tile set okay
07:37 - and here's my tiles let's just grab a
07:40 - plain ground one and you can see we're
07:44 - not placing these at all lined up
07:48 - because we don't have our tile size step
07:51 - correctly and that's because it's set to
07:55 - 64 by 64 now when you're doing isometric
07:58 - there's a lot of different ways of doing
08:01 - isometric some artists will draw pure
08:05 - isometric tiles which means that the
08:07 - width is twice the height like that so
08:12 - if your tile is 64 pixels across
08:15 - it remains sorry 120 pixels across it's
08:17 - 64 tall that does not match these tiles
08:23 - quite as you can see they don't line up
08:27 - when you place them and that's because
08:30 - of again the size now if you look at
08:33 - Kenny's art pack when he released it he
08:37 - included in the download a file listing
08:42 - the proper size for the grid
08:46 - and this is what that file had in it 124
08:51 - by 123 is the size of the images and 120
08:56 - by 98 should be the size of the tiles
09:00 - well I think that that is not correct
09:03 - because if we put in here 120 by 98 oops
09:09 - 98 then you're going to see that these
09:12 - tiles don't quite don't line up at all
09:16 - with that size so you can see when we
09:20 - demand that tile shape is no it's not
09:24 - very close at all to matching the size
09:26 - of the tile image so you can experiment
09:31 - with this and this is what I did was
09:33 - play around with getting things closer
09:38 - by changing the Y size see 16 8 it too
09:43 - far and it turns out that 120 by 70
09:47 - makes things line up just right and this
09:50 - is actually a pretty common hassle that
09:52 - you have to go through when you're
09:54 - getting isometric art off the internet
09:59 - and you're not quite sure or there's
10:01 - some mistake in the size and you have to
10:04 - play around with it for a while until
10:06 - you get things working correctly
10:10 - now our tiles are lining up right but
10:13 - you might have noticed that the
10:15 - highlight box where them where the tiles
10:20 - being placed is kind of above where the
10:22 - tile actually goes and we can fix that
10:26 - by just telling it to use the center of
10:28 - the tile as the origin then everything
10:31 - is lined up just right on the correct
10:36 - perspective
10:38 - so now we have our town maps set up and
10:41 - ready to go and I'm going to name this
10:43 - tile map level 1 this is the ground
10:48 - level because we want to have taller
10:52 - structures that rise up above this like
10:55 - towers and things like that okay so
10:57 - let's say you have some tiles here on
11:00 - the ground and you want to place some
11:03 - towers all right we have all of these
11:07 - tiles for making towers that would rise
11:10 - up above the ground we obviously don't
11:13 - want to place them here because that's
11:14 - going to replace the tile that you're
11:18 - clicking on right and I want the ground
11:20 - to stay there so we want to have a
11:21 - second tile map that is on top of the
11:26 - first one so the easiest way to do that
11:29 - is to duplicate this I'm going to hit
11:31 - command D or ctrl D and now we made a
11:35 - second map that map also has the same
11:39 - tiles on it so if I hide level one you
11:41 - can see we need to erase all of these on
11:43 - level two okay now I want to place this
11:47 - tower now if I click it it's just going
11:50 - to sort of be on top of the other one
11:53 - because it's being drawn on top it's
11:55 - higher in the node right if it was
11:57 - disorder you wouldn't see it because
11:59 - level one would be getting drawn on top
12:01 - but I need to change its location
12:03 - because it's higher it should look like
12:06 - it's shifted you know onto this tile not
12:09 - inside the tile and so we want to take
12:12 - our second level tile map and we want to
12:15 - offset it a little bit and we can do
12:19 - that because a tile map is just a node
12:21 - to D it has position information so we
12:26 - can shift this now I want to shift it
12:28 - upward so that's a negative amount and
12:31 - again from experimentation
12:33 - I found that about twenty eight pixels
12:35 - makes it shift just enough to look like
12:38 - it is centered on that tile so you can
12:41 - see it looks like that Tower is right
12:43 - there so basically each level that you
12:46 - add if we duplicate this and add another
12:49 - one
12:50 - because we want another layer on our
12:52 - tower then we need to take that one and
12:56 - we need to shift level three negative
13:00 - twenty eight times two and then that
13:03 - will let us draw on here and look like
13:07 - we're stacking on top show you one more
13:11 - we'll take this one and this will be
13:13 - negative twenty-eight times three and
13:17 - we'll put the top on the top of the
13:20 - tower there and now we have a nice
13:24 - stacked up tower looking like it is in
13:28 - the right location and this can be all
13:31 - sorts of fun to play around with so
13:33 - here's a map that I went ahead and made
13:35 - because I was enjoying myself made it
13:38 - cover the whole screen I have made four
13:42 - additional levels of towers sticking up
13:44 - in various places and it looks when you
13:48 - run it it looks like this and I even did
13:51 - a little animation on one of the tiles
13:53 - like in the previous section just so you
13:56 - could see what it looks like with a
13:59 - different kind of tile and the important
14:01 - thing to remember about an isometric tom
14:03 - map is there's nothing different about
14:07 - the tile map from an orthogonal one the
14:12 - only difference is in how its drawn and
14:14 - the perspective of the tiles the way
14:18 - that the map works is exactly the same
14:20 - for example if we run this we use the
14:23 - code that we put in the previous example
14:26 - to tell us what tile we're on when we
14:28 - click you'll see that when I click over
14:29 - here in the corner this is zero zero
14:31 - this is the zero zero tile so this is X
14:36 - increasing as I go along the tiles and
14:40 - this is y decreasing as I go upwards so
14:44 - if you imagine it was just a square grid
14:46 - that was rotated you're still moving in
14:49 - XY coordinates and so if you have a
14:53 - character on the map and you have them
14:56 - at a certain tile say they're right here
14:58 - at eight zero and you tell them to move
15:01 - one
15:03 - Kyle to the right they will move to
15:06 - there to square number nine zero and
15:10 - it'll work exactly the same your code
15:12 - doesn't even need to know that you're on
15:15 - an isometric map so I hope you enjoy it
15:18 - going through this three-part
15:20 - examination of the tom map node it's
15:23 - very powerful can be used for a lot of
15:25 - things we've only really barely
15:27 - scratched the surface at this point but
15:30 - I encourage you to open it up an
15:33 - experiment with it and see what you can
15:35 - make it do thanks for watching and I'll
15:38 - see you in the next video
15:47 - you

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back this is part three of our look at the Godot tile map node this time around we're going to be looking at how to do animated tiles which is something a lot of people have requested and also how to work with isometric tile Maps okay let's get started so to start with I've selected this tile set from open game art which have some animated tiles to do some shimmering water effects I'm not going to bother with the waterfalls too many top to deal with so we're just going to make a little island with some shimmering water around it so go ahead and grab this from open game art I'll have the link below now I've actually gone ahead and sliced all these into individual tiles you don't have to do that you can use you can use the region rectangle to define which parts you want in your sprites I did that because I wanted some flexibility to show you some different things to do so I just thought it was gonna be useful to have some different tiles so I basically took all these sprites and I just drag them into the window here to get my start making my tile set so these are all the island ones I don't care about those but this one water one or two and water three these two these three are the ones that I'm going to animate so in the folder I have water one has five frames of animation what or two has five frames of animation and what it three has five frames of animation so each of these is the first frame of its animation okay so just save that and convert it into a tile set like normal and then we'll be able to go over and make our tile map okay here's a tile map and I've just drawn out a little island and then you see I've used the water one water too and water three tiles and place them in a few places around the island where I want the shimmering water to appear now I've also added if you notice when we run this these files are fairly small so the picture is going to be small so I've added a camera to D just so that we will zoom in use that to zoom in a little so we can see the map a little bit better when we run it now we're going to add an animation player to our scene and this is what we're going to use animator tiles so we're going to create a new animation I'm just going to call it water and then we need to start adding tracks and I'm going to add a track for each of the three water tile animations that I want to do so let's do the first one so we go to our tile map and right here is where we've chosen our tile set that we're using and what our one is tile number zero in the set so if I click the right arrow here I can see all the individual tiles in the tile set and their properties and so for tile number zero its texture is what I want to animate so I'm going to click the key next to it to make a keyframe and now we have our first frame set now the length of our animation right now is one and our animation has five tiles so we should be fine I think if we just do two steps in between each one so now the second frame we want to go into our animated water and find what our one frame number two drop that in the texture hit a keyframe repeat again for the third one and repeat again for the fourth one don't forget to hit the key each time after you change the image and hit the key okay so there is our animation let's make it loop and hit play and there we go the places that I've put a water one tile are now showing the little animation and we're just going to repeat that for the other three and so here I've just done the same thing with the other two animated tiles and you can see they're each playing their animation if you anytime you add more of these you're going to see the animation on that tile because we're animating that tile in the tile set so it will be animated wherever it is so hopefully that helps you go and make some animated tiles in your tile map just for your information there is a second technique for doing this that uses a shader instead of the animation player I will probably be doing a video separately for that shaders are a whole separate topic of conversation so whenever that gets done I'll try and remember to link that below so you can check that out as well all right let's go on to isometric Maps the most complicated thing about an isometric map can be the art itself if you don't have a good art pack that hasn't been drawn in a consistent style and perspective it can get really difficult to to use it properly so for this demo I've selected Kenny's isometric tower descents art pack so all the tiles are now in the folder here and we just want to make our tile set and we can do that same way we've done our top sets before we're just going to drag all the sprites into the scene and they will get created with their correct names taken from the file name so they're easy to keep track of and that's all you got to do don't worry about anything else now one thing I will point out here is if we take a look at one of these tiles if you look at the texture the texture is 124 pixels wide and 123 pixels tall and that's how much the whole tile takes up and this is actually going to be true for all the tiles even the flat ones like this they're all the same size but the size of our grid is going to be based on this diamondshaped portion here that's that's the grid part of your tile map and so you have to get the right setting on your tile map and we're going to talk about how to do that next so if we go over to our new scene and we add a tile map to it so we're going to change the mode to isometric and if you look at it now it doesn't look guy symmetric it looks like it's just topdown because we need to change the size well let's load our tile set so we can see what's going to happen when we use it so I'm going to go and grab my topdown tile set okay and here's my tiles let's just grab a plain ground one and you can see we're not placing these at all lined up because we don't have our tile size step correctly and that's because it's set to 64 by 64 now when you're doing isometric there's a lot of different ways of doing isometric some artists will draw pure isometric tiles which means that the width is twice the height like that so if your tile is 64 pixels across it remains sorry 120 pixels across it's 64 tall that does not match these tiles quite as you can see they don't line up when you place them and that's because of again the size now if you look at Kenny's art pack when he released it he included in the download a file listing the proper size for the grid and this is what that file had in it 124 by 123 is the size of the images and 120 by 98 should be the size of the tiles well I think that that is not correct because if we put in here 120 by 98 oops 98 then you're going to see that these tiles don't quite don't line up at all with that size so you can see when we demand that tile shape is no it's not very close at all to matching the size of the tile image so you can experiment with this and this is what I did was play around with getting things closer by changing the Y size see 16 8 it too far and it turns out that 120 by 70 makes things line up just right and this is actually a pretty common hassle that you have to go through when you're getting isometric art off the internet and you're not quite sure or there's some mistake in the size and you have to play around with it for a while until you get things working correctly now our tiles are lining up right but you might have noticed that the highlight box where them where the tiles being placed is kind of above where the tile actually goes and we can fix that by just telling it to use the center of the tile as the origin then everything is lined up just right on the correct perspective so now we have our town maps set up and ready to go and I'm going to name this tile map level 1 this is the ground level because we want to have taller structures that rise up above this like towers and things like that okay so let's say you have some tiles here on the ground and you want to place some towers all right we have all of these tiles for making towers that would rise up above the ground we obviously don't want to place them here because that's going to replace the tile that you're clicking on right and I want the ground to stay there so we want to have a second tile map that is on top of the first one so the easiest way to do that is to duplicate this I'm going to hit command D or ctrl D and now we made a second map that map also has the same tiles on it so if I hide level one you can see we need to erase all of these on level two okay now I want to place this tower now if I click it it's just going to sort of be on top of the other one because it's being drawn on top it's higher in the node right if it was disorder you wouldn't see it because level one would be getting drawn on top but I need to change its location because it's higher it should look like it's shifted you know onto this tile not inside the tile and so we want to take our second level tile map and we want to offset it a little bit and we can do that because a tile map is just a node to D it has position information so we can shift this now I want to shift it upward so that's a negative amount and again from experimentation I found that about twenty eight pixels makes it shift just enough to look like it is centered on that tile so you can see it looks like that Tower is right there so basically each level that you add if we duplicate this and add another one because we want another layer on our tower then we need to take that one and we need to shift level three negative twenty eight times two and then that will let us draw on here and look like we're stacking on top show you one more we'll take this one and this will be negative twentyeight times three and we'll put the top on the top of the tower there and now we have a nice stacked up tower looking like it is in the right location and this can be all sorts of fun to play around with so here's a map that I went ahead and made because I was enjoying myself made it cover the whole screen I have made four additional levels of towers sticking up in various places and it looks when you run it it looks like this and I even did a little animation on one of the tiles like in the previous section just so you could see what it looks like with a different kind of tile and the important thing to remember about an isometric tom map is there's nothing different about the tile map from an orthogonal one the only difference is in how its drawn and the perspective of the tiles the way that the map works is exactly the same for example if we run this we use the code that we put in the previous example to tell us what tile we're on when we click you'll see that when I click over here in the corner this is zero zero this is the zero zero tile so this is X increasing as I go along the tiles and this is y decreasing as I go upwards so if you imagine it was just a square grid that was rotated you're still moving in XY coordinates and so if you have a character on the map and you have them at a certain tile say they're right here at eight zero and you tell them to move one Kyle to the right they will move to there to square number nine zero and it'll work exactly the same your code doesn't even need to know that you're on an isometric map so I hope you enjoy it going through this threepart examination of the tom map node it's very powerful can be used for a lot of things we've only really barely scratched the surface at this point
