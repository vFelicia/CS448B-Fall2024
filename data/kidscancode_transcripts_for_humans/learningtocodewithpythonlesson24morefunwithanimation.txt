00:00 - welcome back to learning to code with
00:02 - python today we're going to have some
00:04 - fun by extending the animation example
00:06 - we made last
00:10 - time in our last video we learned how to
00:13 - create a ball object and use that ball
00:16 - object definition to create multiple
00:19 - balls that will bounce around the
00:23 - screen my question at the end of the
00:25 - last video was what if we wanted to not
00:28 - have three balls but we wanted to have
00:29 - one 100 Balls bouncing around the
00:32 - screen well of course we could say new
00:35 - ball four new ball five new ball six and
00:37 - so on and also remember to do them in
00:40 - the animation Loop but that would be a
00:42 - lot of typing and a lot of repetition so
00:45 - there's definitely a better way the
00:47 - better way is to use a property of
00:49 - objects in Python objects can be treated
00:52 - just the same as any other kind of
00:53 - variable which means that just like with
00:57 - a string variable or a integer variable
01:01 - for example we could put them in a list
01:04 - so why don't we make a
01:06 - list and add all of our balls to that
01:08 - list so we could make a list called
01:14 - balls and that's going to start out
01:16 - being an empty list nothing in
01:19 - it and now instead of
01:21 - creating balls individually what we're
01:24 - going to do is make a
01:26 - loop let's count to 100 and each time
01:30 - through this Loop we want to make a new
01:33 - ball and add it to the
01:35 - list well the command to add something
01:38 - to a list is take the list and you say
01:42 - do append append means add to the end of
01:46 - the list so what do we want to append we
01:48 - want to append a ball with and we'll
01:51 - start out just making them all be
01:54 - red and size
01:58 - 50 okay so now instead of creating these
02:02 - balls individually we've now got at the
02:05 - end of this Loop we've got a list called
02:07 - balls that has 100 individual ball
02:11 - objects in
02:12 - it so now all we need to do in here is
02:16 - tell our program that we want to move
02:19 - all 100 of those ball objects so we can
02:22 - use a loop for that as
02:23 - well and we can say for each ball in the
02:27 - ball
02:28 - list ball.
02:31 - move so we're going through we're doing
02:35 - a loop through the list of
02:37 - balls one at a
02:39 - time and we're using the variable ball
02:42 - to stand for each ball and then we're
02:44 - saying take that ball and move it now
02:47 - let's see what
02:55 - happens now the first thing you might
02:57 - notice is that doesn't look like 100
02:59 - Balls
03:00 - and they're all very clumped together
03:02 - right they're not spread out can you
03:04 - figure out
03:07 - why the answer is that each ball when
03:10 - it's created we give it a random X speed
03:13 - and a random YP speed but our choices
03:16 - for what those speeds could be is very
03:19 - small it's only between one and seven so
03:22 - out of the 100 Balls a lot of them are
03:24 - going to have the same speeds so they're
03:26 - all right on top of each
03:28 - other so let's make it spread out a
03:30 - little bit more and have a little bit
03:32 - more
03:33 - action so one thing we could do is we
03:36 - could increase this this number right to
03:40 - spread out the ball some more how about
03:43 - we go
03:45 - between positive and negative numbers so
03:48 - sometimes they'll be going to the left
03:50 - sometimes they'll be going
03:53 - up so let's see how much difference that
03:58 - makes there we go now now we have them
04:00 - much more spread
04:03 - out there's still a little bit of
04:05 - clumping because there's still not that
04:06 - many differences
04:08 - in the speeds so another thing we could
04:12 - do is we could change the sizes they
04:14 - don't all have to be the same
04:16 - size instead of having 50 here for every
04:19 - ball being the same size we could change
04:22 - that to a random number so let's say we
04:23 - wanted to make this
04:25 - random between 50 and
04:28 - 100
04:30 - right I just replaced that the number
04:34 - 50 with this command to pick a random
04:36 - number so now I'll
04:38 - have objects that are all different
04:42 - sizes there we
04:45 - go so some of them are fast some of them
04:48 - are slow some are bigger than others and
04:51 - here's a little question for you do you
04:52 - know why this one isn't moving at
04:56 - all well in our random speeds
05:00 - the X speed is anything between minus 10
05:02 - and 10 well zero is in between there and
05:05 - the YP speed is also between Min - 10
05:07 - and 10 and zero is between there so it's
05:09 - possible to get a random speed of zero
05:12 - and
05:15 - zero now how about the
05:18 - color well if you remember when we did
05:21 - our random colors in the turtle
05:24 - exercises we can do a random color by
05:28 - having a list and I've already
05:30 - typed one here with a bunch of bunch of
05:33 - colors in it and instead of them all
05:36 - being red I want to pick a random.
05:39 - choice of
05:43 - colors right remember the random. choice
05:46 - command tells the computer to pick
05:48 - something out of a
05:51 - list I've got a lot more
05:56 - color and you can play around with that
05:59 - change things things around try making
06:00 - the balls all be
06:03 - bigger maybe you want enormous um shapes
06:07 - bouncing
06:08 - around right they don't have to be
06:14 - circles you can get some pretty cool
06:16 - effects you want to change this
06:19 - into re
06:21 - rectangle now instead of creating ovals
06:24 - are balls are all rectangle
06:28 - shapes
06:36 - the last thing I want to point out and
06:37 - some of you might have already gone and
06:40 - tried this out is this number right here
06:43 - how many balls we're animating around on
06:45 - the
06:46 - screen well eventually remember your
06:51 - animation is happening in this Loop and
06:53 - the computer is going through this Loop
06:55 - and it's going through each object in
06:58 - the list and moving it
07:00 - each object in the list and moving it
07:02 - and then updating the screen and then
07:03 - trying to do it again the bigger this
07:06 - list gets the longer it's going to take
07:10 - the computer to do this step and the
07:14 - longer it's going to take to do this
07:16 - whole Loop which means that at a certain
07:19 - point things will start to slow down now
07:23 - where the Slowdown happens depends on
07:25 - how fast your computer is but for
07:28 - example and I'm going to sh these down
07:29 - again just so we can see it go back to a
07:32 - small size for example if I increase the
07:35 - number up to 500 now there's five times
07:37 - as many objects on the
07:41 - screen and it's still pretty
07:46 - smooth but what happens if I made
07:48 - it a
07:51 - thousand and double it
07:55 - again do you see how it's starting to
07:57 - get kind of
07:58 - choppy
08:01 - the computer can't move that many
08:02 - objects fast enough for the animation to
08:05 - still be
08:08 - smooth so that's about it for this
08:11 - program go ahead and experiment with it
08:14 - try making changes see what kind of
08:16 - effects you can get to
08:19 - happen have fun with it and
08:21 - see what you can make and I'll see you
08:24 - in the next
08:28 - lesson

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back to learning to code with python today we're going to have some fun by extending the animation example we made last time in our last video we learned how to create a ball object and use that ball object definition to create multiple balls that will bounce around the screen my question at the end of the last video was what if we wanted to not have three balls but we wanted to have one 100 Balls bouncing around the screen well of course we could say new ball four new ball five new ball six and so on and also remember to do them in the animation Loop but that would be a lot of typing and a lot of repetition so there's definitely a better way the better way is to use a property of objects in Python objects can be treated just the same as any other kind of variable which means that just like with a string variable or a integer variable for example we could put them in a list so why don't we make a list and add all of our balls to that list so we could make a list called balls and that's going to start out being an empty list nothing in it and now instead of creating balls individually what we're going to do is make a loop let's count to 100 and each time through this Loop we want to make a new ball and add it to the list well the command to add something to a list is take the list and you say do append append means add to the end of the list so what do we want to append we want to append a ball with and we'll start out just making them all be red and size 50 okay so now instead of creating these balls individually we've now got at the end of this Loop we've got a list called balls that has 100 individual ball objects in it so now all we need to do in here is tell our program that we want to move all 100 of those ball objects so we can use a loop for that as well and we can say for each ball in the ball list ball. move so we're going through we're doing a loop through the list of balls one at a time and we're using the variable ball to stand for each ball and then we're saying take that ball and move it now let's see what happens now the first thing you might notice is that doesn't look like 100 Balls and they're all very clumped together right they're not spread out can you figure out why the answer is that each ball when it's created we give it a random X speed and a random YP speed but our choices for what those speeds could be is very small it's only between one and seven so out of the 100 Balls a lot of them are going to have the same speeds so they're all right on top of each other so let's make it spread out a little bit more and have a little bit more action so one thing we could do is we could increase this this number right to spread out the ball some more how about we go between positive and negative numbers so sometimes they'll be going to the left sometimes they'll be going up so let's see how much difference that makes there we go now now we have them much more spread out there's still a little bit of clumping because there's still not that many differences in the speeds so another thing we could do is we could change the sizes they don't all have to be the same size instead of having 50 here for every ball being the same size we could change that to a random number so let's say we wanted to make this random between 50 and 100 right I just replaced that the number 50 with this command to pick a random number so now I'll have objects that are all different sizes there we go so some of them are fast some of them are slow some are bigger than others and here's a little question for you do you know why this one isn't moving at all well in our random speeds the X speed is anything between minus 10 and 10 well zero is in between there and the YP speed is also between Min 10 and 10 and zero is between there so it's possible to get a random speed of zero and zero now how about the color well if you remember when we did our random colors in the turtle exercises we can do a random color by having a list and I've already typed one here with a bunch of bunch of colors in it and instead of them all being red I want to pick a random. choice of colors right remember the random. choice command tells the computer to pick something out of a list I've got a lot more color and you can play around with that change things things around try making the balls all be bigger maybe you want enormous um shapes bouncing around right they don't have to be circles you can get some pretty cool effects you want to change this into re rectangle now instead of creating ovals are balls are all rectangle shapes the last thing I want to point out and some of you might have already gone and tried this out is this number right here how many balls we're animating around on the screen well eventually remember your animation is happening in this Loop and the computer is going through this Loop and it's going through each object in the list and moving it each object in the list and moving it and then updating the screen and then trying to do it again the bigger this list gets the longer it's going to take the computer to do this step and the longer it's going to take to do this whole Loop which means that at a certain point things will start to slow down now where the Slowdown happens depends on how fast your computer is but for example and I'm going to sh these down again just so we can see it go back to a small size for example if I increase the number up to 500 now there's five times as many objects on the screen and it's still pretty smooth but what happens if I made it a thousand and double it again do you see how it's starting to get kind of choppy the computer can't move that many objects fast enough for the animation to still be smooth so that's about it for this program go ahead and experiment with it try making changes see what kind of effects you can get to happen have fun with it and see what you can make and I'll see you in the next lesson
