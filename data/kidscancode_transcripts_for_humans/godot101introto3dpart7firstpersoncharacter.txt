00:00 - welcome back this is part 7 of the intro
00:04 - to 3d series for Godot in this
00:07 - installment we're gonna learn how to
00:08 - make a first person character we're
00:11 - gonna start with our same CSG scene we
00:13 - built in the last part so that we have
00:16 - somewhere for our character to walk
00:17 - around in and now for a first person
00:20 - character we don't so much need a model
00:25 - for the character because the player is
00:27 - going to be looking out from the
00:28 - character's eyes so really we just need
00:30 - a camera that moves around based on the
00:33 - players input but it also needs to
00:36 - collide with walls and not fall through
00:37 - the floor and all that kind of stuff so
00:39 - we're gonna start with a kinematic body
00:41 - so let's go over here and add a
00:43 - kinematic body this is gonna be our I'm
00:47 - gonna call this an FPS character now
00:51 - we're gonna add two collision shapes to
00:53 - this and I'll explain why in a second
00:56 - but one of them is going to be called
00:58 - the body and one of them is going to be
01:00 - called the feet and then we need to add
01:05 - the camera now the thing is the way that
01:07 - the control scheme is gonna work is you
01:09 - look left and right when you pan the
01:11 - mouse left and right and you look up and
01:13 - down when you pan the mouse up and down
01:15 - but we don't want to rotate the
01:17 - kinematic character up and down when you
01:20 - look up and down because then you'd be
01:22 - falling on your back or falling on your
01:24 - face so we need the camera to rotate up
01:27 - and down independently of the body so
01:31 - we're going to add a spatial here and
01:33 - I'm going to call this the rotation
01:37 - pivot or actually let's just call this
01:41 - the pivot keep the name short and then
01:44 - we're gonna add the camera to that the
01:47 - camera will live in there so that way
01:49 - let's switch to the local mode here that
01:51 - way when the character so the FPS
01:55 - character is going to turn left and
01:57 - right and of course the camera goes with
01:58 - it but the camera pivot will be what
02:04 - rotates up and down so the camera will
02:07 - now be pointing up but the character is
02:09 - still pointing forward okay now
02:13 - now these collision shapes are going to
02:15 - represent our character's body and for
02:19 - that we're going to use a capsule shape
02:21 - which we need to rotate 90 degrees in X
02:25 - so it's pointing up and to give it a
02:29 - size that's appropriate we're gonna
02:31 - change the radius to 0.5 to make it a
02:35 - little narrower and we can leave the
02:37 - height at 1 that gives us about a 2
02:40 - meter high box which is pretty good now
02:45 - a capsule character is nice because if
02:49 - there are small bumps on the ground or
02:51 - things like that you will sort of roll
02:54 - right over them because of the rounded
02:56 - bottom but it also causes a problem when
02:59 - you're when you walk up to ledges or
03:01 - things like that if you stand on a Ledge
03:02 - you will just gravity will sort of slide
03:06 - you off of the edge which is not good so
03:09 - that's why we're gonna have a collision
03:11 - shape for the feet and that's gonna be a
03:13 - box we're gonna set the box size fairly
03:17 - small I'm going to use point four point
03:20 - one and point four and then we're going
03:24 - to move that down and we want that to be
03:26 - down near the bottom of the down near
03:29 - the bottom of the capsule shape but not
03:32 - all the way to the bottom because that
03:34 - way if we have a little bit of the
03:36 - rounded capsule shape sticking out below
03:38 - we'll still get that effect where when
03:41 - we go forward and we hit a small
03:44 - obstacle we kind of walk over it but if
03:48 - we're at the edge of the ledge we won't
03:50 - slide down it because the box will stop
03:52 - us ok so that's how we're gonna set up
03:55 - our collision shape and now the pivot we
03:59 - don't want to be looking out the center
04:00 - of our body so we probably want to move
04:03 - this up a bit I'm thinking probably
04:08 - about probably about there will a jet we
04:13 - can adjust it as we go but you're
04:14 - looking out of almost the top of the
04:17 - character so that's all we need to get
04:19 - started let's go ahead and add a script
04:22 - to make it move around
04:27 - okay we're gonna have a gravity this is
04:30 - gonna be 30 we're gonna have a max speed
04:35 - this is how fast we move and we're gonna
04:39 - have a mouse sensitivity this is how
04:42 - sensitive the mouse is when you move it
04:45 - side to side and it translates into
04:47 - rotating the character now in the case
04:51 - of the mouse when you move the mouse you
04:53 - get a value in pixels and we want to
04:56 - translate that into a value in radians
04:59 - that we can rotate the node by so I'm
05:03 - going to use point zero two and then
05:05 - again this is in radians per pixel and
05:09 - so for each pixel that we move the mouse
05:13 - we will rotate by 0.02 radians which is
05:19 - about a tenth of a degree
05:22 - all right we're also going to have a
05:24 - velocity this is for our movement and
05:29 - that I think should be all we need
05:31 - so now we need to get get our input all
05:35 - right so we want our input to be in the
05:38 - direction that we are facing with the
05:41 - camera so if we've turn to the right and
05:43 - we press forward we want to move that
05:44 - direction but we might already be moving
05:48 - we might already be moving in a certain
05:51 - direction then we turn and want to move
05:54 - in that direction and if we want to have
05:56 - friction or acceleration or have you
05:59 - know be able to have an effect where we
06:00 - have a slippery ground or something like
06:02 - that you can't necessarily change
06:03 - direction instantly so our direction of
06:07 - input might not be the same as our
06:10 - direction of movement so we're not going
06:12 - to change the velocity directly we're
06:14 - going to figure out what direction we're
06:15 - trying to move in so we're gonna call
06:18 - this the input direction and that's a
06:21 - vector and it's going to be based on the
06:24 - direction that the camera is facing so
06:27 - I'm going to grab a reference to the
06:29 - camera so let's make an unready of our
06:33 - camera equals two pivot
06:38 - camera and then that way we can just
06:40 - write camera now the code for this is
06:42 - gonna be the same as we used for the
06:44 - third person character where we check
06:47 - the four inputs and map the input dur to
06:52 - that transform so I'm just gonna paste
06:54 - that here so this is just directly from
07:00 - our third person character I just
07:02 - changed it to use the cameras global
07:04 - transform and we're adding that to the
07:09 - input direction and now you might be
07:12 - holding down more than one of these at
07:13 - once
07:14 - so we probably want to normalize this
07:21 - otherwise we would move faster when we
07:23 - try and go diagonally and I'm gonna
07:25 - return input dur so the result of Maya
07:30 - get input is I have what direction we
07:33 - want to move in okay now for our
07:36 - rotation we're gonna capture one handle
07:39 - input if we get an input event mouse
07:42 - motion and we want to check that the
07:51 - mouse mode equals captured right only
07:56 - when the mouse is captured do we care
07:58 - about this we want to rotate the whole
08:01 - body around Y based on the event
08:06 - relative x times the mouse sensitivity
08:12 - so that will rotate us side-to-side and
08:15 - then we want to rotate the pivot around
08:20 - X based on the event dot relative dot y
08:29 - times the mouse sensitivity now before
08:33 - we test the movement why don't we go
08:34 - ahead and test the rotation so if we go
08:37 - over to our room scene we can add an
08:40 - instance of our FPS character here and
08:44 - let's place them in this room over here
08:48 - so we're not
08:50 - make sure you're not inside the floor so
08:54 - let's test this out and see what the
08:57 - rotation looks like all right so I'm
09:00 - moving the mouse left and right I'm
09:01 - moving the mouse up and down that is all
09:05 - good the sensitivity is pretty good for
09:08 - me if you want to adjust it remember the
09:11 - smaller you make the number the less
09:14 - sensitive it'll be so the more you have
09:15 - to move the mouse to get it to turn okay
09:20 - oh and one problem we're gonna have is
09:22 - let's say I start looking up well I can
09:25 - keep looking up and now my head has
09:27 - completely turned upside down which is a
09:30 - little bit wrong so we need to clamp
09:34 - this up-and-down rotation to a
09:38 - reasonable limit
09:39 - okay so let's clamp the pivots rotation
09:42 - dot X which is what all right that's
09:45 - what we're changing on the pivot let's
09:47 - clamp that to a reasonable amount and
09:54 - I'm gonna use 1.2 that should be pretty
09:59 - good let's try that out and now if I
10:03 - look up now I'm stopping there at the
10:06 - ceiling if I look down I'm stopping at
10:09 - the floor and I can't look down any
10:11 - further so that's good now we can do our
10:17 - movement so in the physics process we
10:19 - want to increase our velocity Y by
10:24 - gravity we want to get the input so I'm
10:31 - gonna call this the desired velocity and
10:34 - that's gonna be get input whatever
10:37 - direction we get from the input times
10:39 - our max speed that's what we want to go
10:42 - and I'm not going to do the friction
10:45 - stuff yet so we'll leave this part out
10:47 - but we need to set our velocity X equal
10:51 - to the desired velocity dot X and our
10:54 - velocity Z to the desired velocity dot Z
10:59 - so that we get moving in the direction
11:01 - we want but we don't ruin the y
11:04 - that's already been set by gravity and
11:06 - now velocity equals move and slide
11:11 - velocity and then we want to say vector
11:16 - three dot up is our ground normal and
11:21 - then I want a true here for the stop on
11:26 - slope parameter because when we walk up
11:28 - our ramp we don't want it to just sort
11:31 - of slide back down the ramp all right
11:35 - let's try that now all right so now here
11:40 - I am
11:40 - walk forward back and left and right and
11:43 - go through there walk up the ramp all
11:48 - right I hit the crates everything looks
11:51 - pretty good
11:52 - I even made the openings for my doors
11:58 - just tall enough for us to fit through
12:00 - which is a happy coincidence I wasn't
12:02 - planning on that in the last video now
12:05 - for jumping we can use the same code we
12:07 - used in our other character we have our
12:09 - jump we have a jump property jump speed
12:16 - which we can set to how fast we want to
12:19 - go upwards let's say 12 and then we're
12:23 - gonna have a jump property which is
12:26 - whether you've pressed jump or not so
12:31 - jump is going to be false most of the
12:34 - time but if we actually want to use just
12:43 - pressed but if we press the jump key
12:49 - we're going to set jump equal to true
12:53 - and then down in our physics process
12:57 - after moving slide we can test if jump
13:01 - and is on floor velocity that Y is equal
13:08 - to the jump speed and that should really
13:11 - all we need to do to get jumping working
13:16 - good enough okay most first-person
13:19 - characters have some sort of object in
13:21 - their hand so I've downloaded from Kenny
13:24 - a shotgun model we're gonna add a mesh
13:30 - instance we want this to be part of the
13:32 - pivot as well because we want it
13:34 - pointing out through the camera and
13:36 - we're gonna use this shotgun mesh now
13:40 - the only issue with this shotgun pitch
13:42 - that you're gonna notice is it is
13:44 - ridiculously small and so we need to
13:48 - scale it up to match the scale of our
13:49 - character so on the mesh we're gonna
13:52 - scale by about 8 times and then we're
14:01 - going to flip it around and why by about
14:06 - 180 degrees and then we want to position
14:10 - it so that it's sticking out through our
14:11 - camera and that can be kind of hard to
14:13 - do and this is where it's easier if you
14:18 - take the view and split it into two
14:20 - viewports and then on the bottom
14:23 - viewport I'm gonna pick the camera and
14:25 - go preview mode so now I'm seeing what
14:27 - the camera sees and then in the top up
14:30 - here I can grab this shotgun and I can
14:35 - position it and see how it's gonna look
14:37 - when it's in the camera so I want it
14:43 - down into the right a little bit like
14:44 - it's sticking out ahead of me that's not
14:47 - too bad let's see how that looks when we
14:49 - run the scene so there's our shotgun
14:57 - pointing ahead of us and that's okay but
15:02 - you might want to come in here and tweak
15:03 - this and maybe rotate it so it's
15:06 - pointing a little bit at an angle so it
15:08 - looks more like it's coming you know
15:10 - from your from your side where your arm
15:14 - is not directly a straight ahead and
15:18 - obviously we don't have any arm or hand
15:21 - models here that we can attach to this
15:24 - yet but all of that we'll have to wait
15:27 - for a later day
15:29 - this will do it for this video hopefully
15:31 - this helped you in getting started and
15:33 - creating your own first person character
15:36 - if you like these videos please don't
15:38 - forget to Like and subscribe and I will
15:41 - see you in the next one
15:50 - you

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back this is part 7 of the intro to 3d series for Godot in this installment we're gonna learn how to make a first person character we're gonna start with our same CSG scene we built in the last part so that we have somewhere for our character to walk around in and now for a first person character we don't so much need a model for the character because the player is going to be looking out from the character's eyes so really we just need a camera that moves around based on the players input but it also needs to collide with walls and not fall through the floor and all that kind of stuff so we're gonna start with a kinematic body so let's go over here and add a kinematic body this is gonna be our I'm gonna call this an FPS character now we're gonna add two collision shapes to this and I'll explain why in a second but one of them is going to be called the body and one of them is going to be called the feet and then we need to add the camera now the thing is the way that the control scheme is gonna work is you look left and right when you pan the mouse left and right and you look up and down when you pan the mouse up and down but we don't want to rotate the kinematic character up and down when you look up and down because then you'd be falling on your back or falling on your face so we need the camera to rotate up and down independently of the body so we're going to add a spatial here and I'm going to call this the rotation pivot or actually let's just call this the pivot keep the name short and then we're gonna add the camera to that the camera will live in there so that way let's switch to the local mode here that way when the character so the FPS character is going to turn left and right and of course the camera goes with it but the camera pivot will be what rotates up and down so the camera will now be pointing up but the character is still pointing forward okay now now these collision shapes are going to represent our character's body and for that we're going to use a capsule shape which we need to rotate 90 degrees in X so it's pointing up and to give it a size that's appropriate we're gonna change the radius to 0.5 to make it a little narrower and we can leave the height at 1 that gives us about a 2 meter high box which is pretty good now a capsule character is nice because if there are small bumps on the ground or things like that you will sort of roll right over them because of the rounded bottom but it also causes a problem when you're when you walk up to ledges or things like that if you stand on a Ledge you will just gravity will sort of slide you off of the edge which is not good so that's why we're gonna have a collision shape for the feet and that's gonna be a box we're gonna set the box size fairly small I'm going to use point four point one and point four and then we're going to move that down and we want that to be down near the bottom of the down near the bottom of the capsule shape but not all the way to the bottom because that way if we have a little bit of the rounded capsule shape sticking out below we'll still get that effect where when we go forward and we hit a small obstacle we kind of walk over it but if we're at the edge of the ledge we won't slide down it because the box will stop us ok so that's how we're gonna set up our collision shape and now the pivot we don't want to be looking out the center of our body so we probably want to move this up a bit I'm thinking probably about probably about there will a jet we can adjust it as we go but you're looking out of almost the top of the character so that's all we need to get started let's go ahead and add a script to make it move around okay we're gonna have a gravity this is gonna be 30 we're gonna have a max speed this is how fast we move and we're gonna have a mouse sensitivity this is how sensitive the mouse is when you move it side to side and it translates into rotating the character now in the case of the mouse when you move the mouse you get a value in pixels and we want to translate that into a value in radians that we can rotate the node by so I'm going to use point zero two and then again this is in radians per pixel and so for each pixel that we move the mouse we will rotate by 0.02 radians which is about a tenth of a degree all right we're also going to have a velocity this is for our movement and that I think should be all we need so now we need to get get our input all right so we want our input to be in the direction that we are facing with the camera so if we've turn to the right and we press forward we want to move that direction but we might already be moving we might already be moving in a certain direction then we turn and want to move in that direction and if we want to have friction or acceleration or have you know be able to have an effect where we have a slippery ground or something like that you can't necessarily change direction instantly so our direction of input might not be the same as our direction of movement so we're not going to change the velocity directly we're going to figure out what direction we're trying to move in so we're gonna call this the input direction and that's a vector and it's going to be based on the direction that the camera is facing so I'm going to grab a reference to the camera so let's make an unready of our camera equals two pivot camera and then that way we can just write camera now the code for this is gonna be the same as we used for the third person character where we check the four inputs and map the input dur to that transform so I'm just gonna paste that here so this is just directly from our third person character I just changed it to use the cameras global transform and we're adding that to the input direction and now you might be holding down more than one of these at once so we probably want to normalize this otherwise we would move faster when we try and go diagonally and I'm gonna return input dur so the result of Maya get input is I have what direction we want to move in okay now for our rotation we're gonna capture one handle input if we get an input event mouse motion and we want to check that the mouse mode equals captured right only when the mouse is captured do we care about this we want to rotate the whole body around Y based on the event relative x times the mouse sensitivity so that will rotate us sidetoside and then we want to rotate the pivot around X based on the event dot relative dot y times the mouse sensitivity now before we test the movement why don't we go ahead and test the rotation so if we go over to our room scene we can add an instance of our FPS character here and let's place them in this room over here so we're not make sure you're not inside the floor so let's test this out and see what the rotation looks like all right so I'm moving the mouse left and right I'm moving the mouse up and down that is all good the sensitivity is pretty good for me if you want to adjust it remember the smaller you make the number the less sensitive it'll be so the more you have to move the mouse to get it to turn okay oh and one problem we're gonna have is let's say I start looking up well I can keep looking up and now my head has completely turned upside down which is a little bit wrong so we need to clamp this upanddown rotation to a reasonable limit okay so let's clamp the pivots rotation dot X which is what all right that's what we're changing on the pivot let's clamp that to a reasonable amount and I'm gonna use 1.2 that should be pretty good let's try that out and now if I look up now I'm stopping there at the ceiling if I look down I'm stopping at the floor and I can't look down any further so that's good now we can do our movement so in the physics process we want to increase our velocity Y by gravity we want to get the input so I'm gonna call this the desired velocity and that's gonna be get input whatever direction we get from the input times our max speed that's what we want to go and I'm not going to do the friction stuff yet so we'll leave this part out but we need to set our velocity X equal to the desired velocity dot X and our velocity Z to the desired velocity dot Z so that we get moving in the direction we want but we don't ruin the y that's already been set by gravity and now velocity equals move and slide velocity and then we want to say vector three dot up is our ground normal and then I want a true here for the stop on slope parameter because when we walk up our ramp we don't want it to just sort of slide back down the ramp all right let's try that now all right so now here I am walk forward back and left and right and go through there walk up the ramp all right I hit the crates everything looks pretty good I even made the openings for my doors just tall enough for us to fit through which is a happy coincidence I wasn't planning on that in the last video now for jumping we can use the same code we used in our other character we have our jump we have a jump property jump speed which we can set to how fast we want to go upwards let's say 12 and then we're gonna have a jump property which is whether you've pressed jump or not so jump is going to be false most of the time but if we actually want to use just pressed but if we press the jump key we're going to set jump equal to true and then down in our physics process after moving slide we can test if jump and is on floor velocity that Y is equal to the jump speed and that should really all we need to do to get jumping working good enough okay most firstperson characters have some sort of object in their hand so I've downloaded from Kenny a shotgun model we're gonna add a mesh instance we want this to be part of the pivot as well because we want it pointing out through the camera and we're gonna use this shotgun mesh now the only issue with this shotgun pitch that you're gonna notice is it is
