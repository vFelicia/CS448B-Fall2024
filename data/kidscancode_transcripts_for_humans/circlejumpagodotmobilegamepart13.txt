00:00 - welcome back to circle jump we're
00:01 - getting really close to completing this
00:03 - game this time I'm going to be adding a
00:05 - few small features that will really
00:06 - boost the fun level of the game
00:08 - the main one being a score multiplier
00:10 - that rewards you for quick reaction if
00:13 - you jump quickly before completing a
00:15 - full orbit you'll get more points
00:16 - especially if you can keep doing it
00:18 - alright let's get started the first
00:21 - thing we're gonna do is we're gonna make
00:22 - the music fade out when you lose instead
00:26 - of stopping instantly I had a suggestion
00:29 - from a couple of people that that was a
00:31 - bit jarring and that we should do
00:32 - something about that so we're gonna add
00:34 - a tween to this main scene here that
00:37 - we're gonna use to ramp the volume down
00:40 - when the game ends so if we go over here
00:44 - to our main script we're going to add a
00:48 - new function called fade music and what
00:54 - this is going to do is it's going to
00:56 - take the tween which let's name this
01:01 - music fade the music fade we're going to
01:06 - interpolate property the music node the
01:13 - volume DB is the property that we want
01:17 - to interpolate we're gonna start from
01:20 - zero which is the default value to minus
01:23 - 50 we're going to take one second and
01:27 - we're going to use I don't think it
01:31 - really matters all that much since we're
01:33 - gonna just hear it fade out but I'm just
01:35 - gonna do the default ease types we'll do
01:41 - ease in okay so we then are going to
01:47 - start it music fade start and then we're
01:51 - just going to wait for it to we're going
01:55 - to wait for music fade we're gonna make
01:57 - wait for the all completed signal and
02:02 - then just tell the music to stop
02:06 - so now at the end of the game instead of
02:10 - music dot stop we're just gonna say fade
02:13 - music now that would fade the music down
02:17 - to zero
02:17 - on the first play but then when we go to
02:20 - play again our sorry to negative 50 then
02:23 - we go to play again it's gonna be on
02:24 - negative 50 still so when we start a new
02:27 - game and we play the music we also need
02:31 - to reset the volume back to normal so
02:34 - we're gonna set volume DB to zero so
02:37 - let's give that a quick shot so we hit
02:41 - play
02:41 - there's our music and then when we lose
02:44 - it fades out play again and then there
02:48 - we go alright the other thing that we're
02:51 - gonna do which was suggested by game
02:55 - Endeavor who I'm gonna link to in the
02:57 - comments below you should definitely go
02:58 - watch his channel he does some really
03:00 - good go to toriel's as well he suggested
03:04 - that when you top your high score you
03:06 - should get some kind of notification so
03:08 - you get that dopamine hit of hey I got a
03:11 - new high score so we're gonna make a
03:14 - flag here to track whether you've gotten
03:18 - a new high score in the current in the
03:21 - current game this would be false and
03:25 - then when you whenever we start a new
03:29 - game we will set that to false and then
03:34 - if you break that record then down here
03:39 - when we set the score if score is
03:43 - greater than high score and we haven't
03:49 - hit a new high score then we're gonna
03:52 - show the message on the HUD and your
03:55 - show message new record so you'll see
04:00 - that come up and then we'll set a new
04:03 - high score to true so you don't get that
04:05 - notice every time you get another point
04:07 - right we only want them to show once
04:09 - when you surpass the old record now we
04:12 - can move on to the main focus of this
04:15 - episode which is to implement a bonus
04:19 - counter
04:20 - so I've added to the HUD already just a
04:22 - label up here which is going to hold it
04:24 - we're gonna use this to give you a bonus
04:26 - every time you jump if you jump before
04:29 - you've orbited the circle one full
04:31 - revolution and so if you can get a chain
04:33 - of those going your bonus will increase
04:34 - every time and you can score a lot more
04:37 - points and so I also added an animation
04:39 - for this so that whenever you get a
04:43 - bonus up it will pulse like that and so
04:46 - it's just scaling it up and then scaling
04:48 - it down and turning it red and then back
04:51 - to white so that we just get that little
04:53 - click whenever we get another bonus
04:56 - every time it goes up and we're gonna
04:58 - use that in the script when we update
05:00 - the bonus we'll change the text and then
05:04 - if we're going up we'll play the
05:07 - animation if you're dropping back down
05:08 - because you've lost the bonus it's not
05:10 - going to play the animation okay
05:12 - implementing this on the circle is gonna
05:14 - require a little bit of change we are
05:17 - we're already keeping track of the
05:19 - orbits but we're only doing it when
05:21 - we're unlimited mode so that we can
05:23 - count down and see when you run out
05:26 - instead we need to do this for every
05:29 - circle count how many rotations you've
05:32 - or how many orbits you've done but then
05:35 - if you're limited have them run out just
05:37 - like they're doing now so what we're
05:39 - gonna do is we're gonna take the in the
05:43 - limited mode so right now what we're
05:45 - doing is we have our num orbits which is
05:48 - company the limited mode has and then we
05:52 - have current orbits which is how many of
05:53 - you've done we're starting that out at
05:55 - zero and we're going to keep that so I'm
05:58 - going to set that to zero every time you
06:00 - get captured so we're here and we're
06:05 - just going to have it count up but that
06:08 - means that when we're in limited mode
06:09 - instead of setting the current orbits to
06:12 - you know say three and subtracting to
06:15 - count it down we're going to leave it at
06:18 - zero and add up so that means our text
06:21 - needs to be num orbits when we're in
06:25 - limited mode show how many there are and
06:29 - then in process when we're checking the
06:32 - orbits to count what
06:33 - we've made a complete revolution we need
06:36 - to do that all the time not just when
06:38 - we're in a limited mode so we're gonna
06:41 - take that conditional out and we're
06:43 - gonna just do it if there's a jumper
06:45 - attached
06:45 - now check orbits needs to change so
06:48 - we're gonna test if we've done a full
06:50 - circle but then we're going to increase
06:54 - current orbits by one and then if we
07:01 - have completed a circle we're going to
07:04 - emit a signal so I'm going to define a
07:06 - signal up here called full orbit that
07:11 - we're going to emit if we've done a full
07:16 - orbit so we're going to emit signal full
07:21 - orbit and now if we're in limited mode
07:25 - we'll do this other stuff like we've
07:28 - been doing before
07:29 - so if mode is modes dot limited then we
07:37 - will play the beep sound because we
07:39 - completed a circle we will update the
07:42 - label text to be we want that to be num
07:47 - orbits minus current orbits because now
07:52 - if we started out with three we've done
07:53 - two they'll be one left and it's still
07:56 - gonna be over and implode if we run out
08:03 - but then we need this to happen
08:06 - regardless to update the orbit for the
08:10 - next time around
08:12 - now the other place we need to change
08:14 - them in our draw so draw is going to be
08:16 - getting called all the time now so we
08:19 - need to not draw a be limited circle pie
08:24 - in the middle unless we're in limited
08:26 - mode so if mode is not equal to modes
08:30 - limited we're going to return and then
08:35 - otherwise we will draw now that we need
08:37 - to update this a little bit too because
08:38 - it's using the wrong formula now and
08:41 - instead it's going to be this
08:46 - and then just one plus current orbits so
08:51 - then the pie gets bigger as current
08:54 - orbits goes up breaks are multiplying
08:57 - okay so now we're about there but
09:01 - there's one kind of subtle bug that got
09:03 - introduced here when I was testing this
09:04 - out and trying to figure out how I
09:05 - wanted to do it and that is we emit the
09:09 - signal when the circle completes an
09:11 - orbit but if you jump off right before
09:15 - the orbit is completed the circle you
09:18 - jumped away from it's still going to
09:20 - emit the signal because it hasn't had a
09:22 - chance to implode yet or it's running
09:25 - the implode animation while that's
09:27 - happening and the reason for that is
09:29 - because when we call implode we're not
09:32 - setting jumper equals null and that will
09:37 - solve that problem
09:38 - so now we're done with the circle and
09:41 - we're emitting the signal so over here
09:44 - in Maine we're going to need to do
09:46 - something about that signal all right so
09:48 - we're gonna add a variable called bonus
09:52 - to keep track of our bonus level and
09:55 - it's going to start out and we're gonna
09:59 - give it a set get of set bonus and then
10:05 - we'll define that in a second but we
10:08 - also when we spawn the circle we need to
10:09 - connect up that signal so let's see new
10:13 - game up new game we should set bonus
10:16 - bonus equals zero when we spawn the
10:23 - circle we need to connect that signal
10:26 - and we're gonna connect the full orbits
10:30 - signal to we're gonna connect it
10:33 - directly to the set bonus method and
10:39 - we're gonna pass it a value of 1 because
10:40 - if you complete a full or knit orbit you
10:43 - lose your bonus to the bonus bonus gets
10:45 - reset back to 1 so we're just gonna send
10:47 - one on over there now we also need to
10:51 - when you hit a new circle if you jumped
10:55 - we should add one to your bonus so score
10:58 - we add
11:00 - we add 1 times bonus right so whatever
11:03 - your multiple bonus is your your score
11:05 - multiplier and we increase bonus by one
11:10 - and then we can do the set bonus method
11:18 - and what this is going to do is set the
11:23 - bonus equal to the value and update the
11:27 - HUD so on the HUD will call update bonus
11:31 - with the bonus value all right and that
11:38 - should do it let's give it a try all
11:44 - right so you can see my bonus increasing
11:46 - but when I let it go around a full
11:47 - circle I lose it and you see my score
11:51 - going up and you can see I got a couple
11:54 - of really good long chains going which
11:56 - was really satisfying to get that really
11:58 - high score and try and keep the chain
12:01 - from breaking so I think this is a great
12:03 - addition it really adds a lot of
12:05 - excitement to playing the game this
12:08 - tutorial is part of my nugudo recipes
12:10 - website the goal is to collect all the
12:12 - best tips and lessons to help make you a
12:14 - better at Godot developer if you like
