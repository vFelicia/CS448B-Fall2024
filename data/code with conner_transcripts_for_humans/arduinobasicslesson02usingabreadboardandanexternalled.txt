00:11 - hello people of the Internet
00:14 - welcome back to code with Connor and the
00:16 - Arduino basics tutorial series this is
00:18 - lesson 2 o in this lesson we're gonna be
00:20 - taking what we did in Lesson one and
00:22 - extending on it by bringing in a
00:24 - breadboard we're gonna wire up an
00:27 - external LED on a breadboard it'll
00:29 - basically work the same way as the LED
00:31 - we turned on and off in lesson number
00:32 - one except the LED this time will be
00:34 - plugged into an external breadboard and
00:36 - it'll be an actual little LED light
00:38 - instead of the one built in on the
00:40 - Arduino board
00:40 - first things first once you're taking
00:42 - your breadboard and a few wires out of
00:43 - the package we're gonna wire up our
00:45 - circuit and then we'll go look at the
00:46 - code afterward let's talk briefly about
00:48 - a breadboard that this white thing here
00:51 - is a breadboard they come in all shapes
00:53 - and sizes there's what's important for
00:54 - you to know the row with the plus and
00:56 - the row with the minus are all
00:58 - connectivity we use these for voltage
01:00 - and ground a row on the top is not
01:01 - connected to the one on the bottom we
01:03 - would have to make that connection or so
01:04 - all of the inside sections are connected
01:07 - by column you can see on my screen how
01:08 - they light up green that means all of
01:11 - these pins are internally connected so
01:12 - if I plug something in the bottom here
01:14 - and then I plug something in the top
01:15 - they're going to be connected to each
01:17 - other that's the nice thing about a
01:18 - breadboard this middle channel acts as a
01:20 - brake there is not an automatic
01:22 - connection across the bridge so you
01:24 - would need to make a jump with a wire
01:26 - from one end of the bridge to the other
01:28 - if you wanted that column to be
01:30 - connected all the way down for this
01:31 - wiring diagram we're gonna start by
01:33 - running a wire from pin number eight to
01:36 - one of the channels on our board so I'm
01:39 - just gonna come up here to channel
01:40 - number 20 and just for fun I'm gonna
01:42 - make my wire yellow all I'm doing there
01:44 - is I'm connecting my Arduino pin eight
01:46 - to this column all my breadboard right
01:48 - here next I'm gonna bring in a resistant
01:50 - we haven't talked about resistors yes
01:51 - mister looks something like this it's a
01:55 - tiny little piece of electronic mines
01:57 - blue on here what it does it helps
01:59 - resist the current heading through the
02:01 - circuit reason we use this with external
02:02 - LEDs is that we don't want to burn out
02:04 - the LEDs by sending too much current to
02:06 - that we want to resist that current
02:08 - resistors come in all different sizes in
02:10 - terms of how much resistance that they
02:11 - provide in your area
02:13 - kit you'll see a package for 220 ohm
02:15 - resister so in your kit you have a bag
02:17 - full of resistors like this if you pull
02:19 - them out you'll see that it's labeled
02:22 - how many ohms it is so this one is 220
02:25 - ohms okay so these are the types of
02:26 - resistors that we're looking for when
02:28 - we're wiring external LEDs so I'm gonna
02:30 - take my resistor and I'm gonna use it to
02:31 - bridge that gap on my breadboard so I'm
02:33 - gonna connect it here channel 20 where I
02:36 - have the yellow wire connected all the
02:37 - way through to the other side of the
02:39 - breadboard which now has created a
02:40 - connection or a bridge across that full
02:42 - call and that full channel 20 on my
02:44 - bridge now that I have the resistor in
02:45 - place I can hook up my LED light so you
02:48 - can grab an LED light out of your kid it
02:49 - doesn't matter what color you use what
02:51 - you'll find is that by using a 220 ohm
02:53 - resistor on all LEDs some colors will be
02:55 - brighter than others you can get really
02:57 - technical with the exact resistance
02:59 - value for different colors we don't go
03:00 - quite that technical with it in this
03:02 - tutorial series but feel free to do some
03:04 - research on the internet if you want to
03:05 - know more about that so we're gonna
03:06 - bring our LED into our breadboard now
03:09 - now you'll notice on the LED that
03:10 - there's a long pin or a long leg and a
03:12 - short leg we want the long leg to be the
03:14 - one connected to the resistor channel
03:16 - and the short leg is gonna be one
03:17 - channel over in this case I've got it
03:19 - hooked up to channel number 90 our
03:21 - voltage is gonna come out of pin eight
03:22 - it's gonna travel up this channel
03:24 - through the resistor the long leg of the
03:25 - LED now the short leg of the LED we're
03:27 - gonna connect to the ground all I'm
03:29 - gonna do is on this channel maybe above
03:31 - my LED I'm gonna run a wire to the
03:33 - ground check I'm gonna make that wire
03:34 - block just to make it clear that it's a
03:36 - ground wire now right now that ground is
03:38 - not actually coming back to my Arduino
03:40 - boards remember this ground channel is
03:42 - not connected to this ground channel I
03:43 - don't have any other wires going to my
03:45 - Arduino what I usually do whenever I'm
03:47 - working on a breadboard is I will
03:48 - connect these channel I'll take my
03:50 - voltage channel and I'll connect it here
03:52 - usually with a red wire and I'll usually
03:54 - take my ground channel and I'll connect
03:56 - it here usually with a black wire and
03:58 - what this does it just make sure that
03:59 - this row and this row are connected and
04:01 - that the to ground bros are connect now
04:03 - all I need to do is run a ground wire my
04:06 - Arduino ground to the ground to channel
04:08 - and now if I follow my circuit from pin
04:10 - number 8 to channel 20 through the
04:14 - resistor over the bridge into the long
04:17 - leg of the led through the LED itself to
04:20 - the short leg up here to the black wire
04:23 - which goes to ground which jumps all the
04:25 - way back down to this crown
04:27 - channel travels across ham back to my
04:29 - Arduino his ground pork so we have
04:31 - completed that circuit that is all the
04:33 - wiring that we need to do for this
04:35 - activity now it's time for us to go have
04:37 - a look what the codes going to so we're
04:40 - back into our code interface on the
04:41 - arduino website or on an arduino ide if
04:44 - that's where we're gonna go ahead and
04:45 - we're gonna create a new sketch so what
04:47 - i'm gonna do i like to give my sketch
04:48 - the name right away I'm gonna give this
04:50 - sketch a name because I want to make
04:51 - sure that I'm keeping things consistent
04:55 - lesson zero two in this lesson we're
04:57 - going to be controlling an external LED
04:59 - so I've just added a comment in here to
05:01 - say that that's what we're going to be
05:03 - doing I also always like to have a
05:04 - comment about my setup function and what
05:06 - its purpose is and about the beginning
05:07 - of my loop function let's think about
05:09 - our circuit our circuit is going to jump
05:11 - from pin number eight to the LED which
05:13 - means we need to find pin number eight
05:15 - as an output pin so let's do that now
05:17 - inside our setup function we're going to
05:19 - do pin mode and then we're gonna put the
05:23 - pin number in this case it's pin number
05:24 - eight and then a comma and then we
05:27 - decide whether it's an input or an
05:29 - output pin in this case we're gonna be
05:31 - sending a signal out to the led
05:32 - so it's an output pin and we end with
05:37 - the bracket and the semicolon so that's
05:39 - all the code that we need in our setup
05:40 - function now let's jump down to our loop
05:42 - we need to actually send a signal to
05:44 - turn the LED on well this is exactly the
05:47 - same as what we did in lesson number one
05:49 - where we're gonna send that digital
05:50 - right and then we're gonna send it again
05:52 - to turn it off stay with me okay so this
05:58 - code should look familiar from lesson
05:59 - number one we have a digital write call
06:01 - where we're giving the pin number that
06:02 - we want to send that right to and we're
06:05 - setting the value to high this means we
06:07 - are sending full 5 volts from the
06:08 - Arduino out through pin number 8 and
06:10 - then a delay the delay works in
06:12 - milliseconds remember so this is
06:14 - actually one second we do a digital
06:16 - write on pin number eight
06:18 - this time we're writing a low value
06:20 - which is essentially turning the signal
06:21 - off and then again delaying for one
06:23 - second so what should be the result of
06:24 - this is that our external LED which if
06:26 - we wired it correctly it's plugged into
06:28 - pin number eight should turn on for one
06:30 - second then turn off for one second this
06:32 - is going to repeat over and over because
06:34 - this code exists inside of the loop
06:36 - function I'm just gonna add a few
06:37 - comments to the code here to make it a
06:38 - little bit more clear
06:39 - those of you who might be struggling now
06:45 - the codes got lots of comments in there
06:46 - feel free to pause the video have a read
06:48 - of the comments if you've been
06:49 - struggling with figuring out what the
06:50 - different lines of code are going to do
06:52 - if all goes well at this point you
06:54 - should be able to push this code out to
06:56 - your Arduino we'll go ahead and do that
06:57 - now it says that the code is pushed out
07:00 - tomorrow doing it successfully let's
07:01 - have a look and see if our light is
07:02 - blinking so there you have it
07:07 - on for one second off for one second our
07:10 - circuit is working the way that it's
07:11 - supposed to work awesome so now you have
07:14 - an LED on an external breadboard that's
07:16 - blinking
07:17 - why don't we extend this a little bit
07:19 - and take it one led further why don't
07:22 - you wire up a second LED on to your
07:24 - board attached to your Arduino and then
07:26 - add in the additional code needed so
07:28 - that both lights are blinking together
07:29 - you can even make the lights blink at
07:31 - different speeds if you want to play
07:32 - around with that okay so maybe the
07:34 - lesson in the extension
07:36 - we're not enough for you how about a
07:37 - little bit of a challenge why don't you
07:39 - wire up those two LEDs from the
07:41 - extension except this time take one of
07:43 - them and treat it like a long - take the
07:45 - other treat it like a short - and get
07:48 - the two LEDs to do an SOS signal one of
07:50 - them represents the lungs one of them
07:52 - represents the shorts with a little bit
07:54 - of delay and between each broadcast so
07:56 - that it's clear that it is an SOS signal
07:58 - try that out and see if you can pull it
08:00 - off and I'll see you back in lesson
08:01 - number three thanks for watching and be

hello people of the Internet welcome back to code with Connor and the Arduino basics tutorial series this is lesson 2 o in this lesson we're gonna be taking what we did in Lesson one and extending on it by bringing in a breadboard we're gonna wire up an external LED on a breadboard it'll basically work the same way as the LED we turned on and off in lesson number one except the LED this time will be plugged into an external breadboard and it'll be an actual little LED light instead of the one built in on the Arduino board first things first once you're taking your breadboard and a few wires

channel acts as a brake there is not an automatic connection across the bridge so you would need to make a jump with a wire from one end of the bridge to the other if you wanted that column to be connected all the way down for this wiring diagram we're gonna start by running a wire from pin number eight to one of the channels on our board so I'm just gonna come up here to channel number 20 and just for fun I'm gonna make my wire yellow all I'm doing there is I'm connecting my Arduino pin eight to this column all my breadboard right here next I'm gonna bring in a resistant we haven't talked about resistors yes mister looks something like this it's a tiny little piece of electronic mines blue on here what it does it helps resist the current heading through the circuit reason we use this

you use what you'll find is that by using a 220 ohm resistor on all LEDs some colors will be brighter than others you can get really technical with the exact resistance value for different colors we don't go quite that technical with it in this tutorial series but feel free to do some research on the internet if you want to know more about that so we're gonna bring our LED into our breadboard now now you'll notice on the LED that there's a long pin or a long leg and a short leg we want the long leg to be the one connected to the resistor channel and the short leg is gonna be one channel over in this case I've got it hooked up to channel number 90 our voltage is gonna come out of pin eight it's gonna travel up this channel through the resistor the long leg of the LED now the short leg of the LED we're gonna connect to the ground all I'm gonna do is on this channel maybe above my LED I'm gonna run a wire to the ground check I'm gonna make that wire block just to make it clear that it's a ground wire now right now that ground is not actually coming back to my Arduino boards remember this ground channel is not connected to this ground channel I don't have any other wires going to my Arduino what I usually do whenever I'm working on a breadboard is I will connect these channel I'll take my voltage channel and I'll connect it here usually with a red wire and I'll usually take my ground channel and I'll connect it here usually with a black wire and what this does it just make sure that this row and this row are connected and that the to ground bros are connect now all I need to do is run a ground wire my Arduino ground to the ground to channel and now if I follow my circuit from pin number 8 to channel 20 through the resistor over the bridge into the long leg of the led through the LED itself to the short leg up here to the black wire which goes to ground which jumps all the way back down to this crown channel travels across ham back to my Arduino his ground pork so we have completed that circuit that is all the wiring that we need to do for this activity now it's time for us to go have a look what the codes going to so we're back into our code interface on the
