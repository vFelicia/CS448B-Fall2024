00:02 - hello humans
00:04 - welcome to code with connor this is your
00:06 - first time here
00:08 - thanks for coming in we're going to
00:09 - learn some python in this video series
00:12 - so if this is video 1a so we're going to
00:14 - start unit one by just introducing what
00:16 - python is
00:16 - uh talk a little bit what you need to do
00:18 - to get set up and get coding we'll give
00:20 - you a few options so that you can code
00:22 - along
00:22 - uh with these videos uh and then we'll
00:25 - kind of get rolling from there if you
00:26 - wanna learn more about me
00:28 - uh let me know in the comments and i'll
00:29 - post a video about it but for right now
00:31 - we'll just stick to the code so if
00:33 - you're here you're probably interested
00:34 - in learning something about python maybe
00:36 - somebody told you can make a lot of
00:37 - money
00:37 - uh as a programmer uh maybe you just
00:40 - want to know it because you think it's
00:41 - cool and it's got a cool sound a name
00:42 - either way
00:43 - i'm glad you're here first thing you're
00:45 - going to need is you're going to need
00:46 - the ability to
00:47 - run python scripts now i'm going to go
00:49 - through a series of instructions over
00:50 - the next few minutes
00:51 - about installing this stuff on a windows
00:53 - computer it'll be a very similar process
00:55 - on a mac os or a linux machine
00:57 - if you're going to be running this on a
00:58 - chromebook or a tablet or a phone
01:01 - you can just check in the call in the
01:02 - description of the video and i'll i'll
01:04 - chapter this thing up you can skip ahead
01:06 - to the section where i'll talk about
01:08 - some options you can use if you're doing
01:09 - it mobile let's get into it i'm just on
01:11 - chrome here
01:12 - and i've just gone to the python website
01:13 - it's python.org
01:15 - and i clicked on downloads okay so
01:17 - you're gonna need to download python to
01:19 - your computer
01:19 - so i'm gonna download python 3.91 this
01:22 - is the latest version of when i'm
01:23 - recording this video
01:24 - if python 4 is out when you're watching
01:26 - it you should probably download python 3
01:29 - just because i imagine there'll be some
01:30 - major changes as they move from 3 to 4.
01:33 - so make sure you note where you download
01:35 - it
01:36 - download chrome's going to download the
01:39 - file and i'm going to open it up
01:41 - so it's going to ask me if there's one
01:43 - important piece here when you install
01:44 - this on a windows machine
01:46 - because of how we're going to use python
01:48 - it's really helpful for us
01:50 - if we add python as a path okay and this
01:52 - is going to allow us in powershell to
01:53 - use the python command
01:55 - which is just fantastic and it makes
01:56 - running our simple programs
01:58 - while we're learning really easy so
02:00 - we're going to do that cool install now
02:06 - awesome
02:11 - there we go python's installed close
02:15 - awesome now writing your actual python
02:17 - code
02:18 - you can use an ide an integrated
02:20 - development environment there's large
02:21 - scale ones there's tiny ones
02:23 - when i'm writing python i'm writing
02:24 - small scripts i'm teaching people
02:26 - i don't need the big convoluted
02:28 - debugging tools and all of that
02:30 - so i'm going to go to my go my go-to
02:31 - favorite and this is what i'm going to
02:32 - use in the videos
02:33 - notepad plus plus i love notepad plus
02:37 - plus
02:38 - if we hop over here to download you can
02:40 - go in here and you can download the
02:42 - latest version so here's the 7.88
02:44 - release
02:46 - click on that and then you can download
02:48 - it to your windows machine
02:49 - again take note of where you download it
02:51 - and then we're going to run the
02:52 - installer
02:54 - so i'm going to download the 64-bit
02:56 - installer here
02:59 - and we'll save it
03:03 - and we'll launch it
03:06 - choose a language
03:10 - we go next accept
03:14 - next next
03:19 - and just like that we are up and running
03:23 - pam there we go so notepad plus plus
03:26 - is installed so these two things
03:28 - together are going to be our environment
03:30 - we're going to write our code in notepad
03:32 - plus plus then we're going to use python
03:34 - which is installed on the computer
03:35 - to actually run it now that we have nova
03:37 - plus plus installed and we have python
03:39 - installed
03:40 - we're ready to start kind of writing
03:41 - code we're going to write our code in
03:43 - notepad plus plus
03:44 - we're going to use windows powershell to
03:46 - actually run our code so
03:48 - first time we pull up windows powershell
03:50 - all we're going to do
03:52 - is we're going to start menu and we're
03:54 - going to type power
03:56 - this is one of many ways to do it and
03:58 - then once we launch powershell it's
03:59 - going to look something like this
04:01 - it's called windows powershell now it
04:02 - might bring you to a different drive
04:03 - obviously
04:04 - than the one i'm in so the one thing
04:06 - we're going to need to do from an
04:07 - organization standpoint is you're going
04:08 - to want a folder on your pc
04:10 - where you're going to save all your
04:11 - python scripts so you can make it
04:12 - something simple like you can navigate
04:14 - to this pc
04:16 - to your c drive whatever and then you
04:18 - can do it that way so
04:19 - so on your computer if you are on your
04:22 - pc
04:23 - and you go to your c drive this is one
04:25 - of the easiest things
04:26 - if you just right click and make a new
04:28 - folder
04:30 - call it like share subscribe
04:35 - right and then that folder can be where
04:37 - we save all of our python scripts
04:39 - so this way it's going to make it easy
04:41 - for us to access it so if we hop over
04:43 - here
04:44 - to our powershell we can see that if i
04:47 - go to c
04:48 - colon and i hit enter and then
04:52 - i'm going to use a couple of commands so
04:54 - i can do cd dot dot it takes me back one
04:56 - directory so you'll see
04:58 - i go from my folder back to users i can
05:01 - do it again
05:02 - now i'm back in c drive there's another
05:04 - command called cd space and you can put
05:05 - the name of a directory
05:07 - so like and i can hit tab at any point
05:10 - it'll try to autofill it
05:11 - like share subscribe i hit enter and now
05:14 - i'm inside of that folder
05:15 - so i'm in c colon like share subscribe
05:18 - and so this is where i'll be when i run
05:20 - commands
05:21 - if you ever want to clear your
05:22 - powershell you can do cls
05:25 - and it's gone okay you know pretty
05:27 - simple set of commands that we're going
05:28 - to use you
05:29 - you'll sometimes use cd dot dot or
05:31 - you'll use cd space and then start
05:33 - typing in a folder name
05:35 - and the last command we'll use will be
05:36 - python and we'll use that in just a
05:38 - minute
05:39 - so let's hop over here to our notepad
05:41 - plus plus
05:42 - and our powershell environments in
05:44 - notepad plus plus we'll go over just a
05:46 - very quick program
05:47 - and then we're going to end this video
05:49 - and then we'll get ready for moving on
05:50 - to the next one we're actually diving
05:52 - into stuff a little bit more so the very
05:53 - first program that we write in the world
05:55 - of programming and software development
05:56 - is always the hello world program and
05:58 - it seems to be going on for a long time
06:00 - it was the first program i wrote in java
06:01 - back
06:02 - i don't know 20 years ago and it's still
06:04 - the first program i teach my students so
06:06 - it looks something like this in python
06:07 - we're going to type print
06:09 - and we're going to open a set of
06:11 - parentheses parentheses are our curved
06:13 - brackets
06:14 - and then in quotation marks so quotation
06:16 - marks are just left to the enter key on
06:17 - your keyboard
06:18 - we're going to write hello world
06:22 - exclamation point then we're going to
06:24 - close our quotation marks
06:25 - and we're going to close our parentheses
06:27 - it's important in coding and you'll see
06:29 - this if you've learned any html or
06:30 - anything before
06:31 - that what we open we have to close all
06:33 - right so we open the brackets we open
06:35 - the quotes
06:36 - we type it we close we close and then
06:38 - we're going to go through the process
06:39 - how we run it so we're going to save
06:41 - this
06:41 - so i'm going to go to file and this one
06:43 - time i'm going to do save as
06:45 - but from now on i'm just going to do
06:47 - file save
06:48 - and i'm going to find my folder c drive
06:51 - like share subscribe and we're going to
06:54 - call this
06:55 - hello world dot p y and the dot p y is
06:58 - important
06:59 - because the dot p y is a file extension
07:01 - that tells windows this is a python
07:03 - script
07:03 - it also will tell python to read it as
07:05 - such and i hit save
07:07 - you'll notice my notepad plus plus is
07:09 - color coded once you save it as a dot py
07:12 - nobel plus plus will recognize python
07:14 - code and help color code
07:16 - elements for you until you've saved it
07:18 - it's not going to do that it's just
07:19 - going to see raw text
07:21 - so it's helpful to save your files at
07:22 - the beginning so you get those nice
07:24 - colors
07:25 - to help you kind of organize your code
07:27 - so now when it's time to run it we
07:29 - actually
07:30 - will leave nova plus plus and go to
07:32 - powershell
07:33 - and in here we're going to type python
07:35 - space
07:36 - and then we're going to type the name of
07:37 - the file and again we don't take the
07:39 - whole name
07:40 - we can hit tab at any point that we
07:42 - think we have enough characters to make
07:43 - it unique
07:44 - and there it is pythonhelloworld.py and
07:46 - when i hit enter
07:49 - it prints to the console hello world
07:51 - exclamation point
07:52 - so it printed the literal string that
07:55 - was inside of these quotation marks it
07:57 - didn't print the quotes it didn't print
07:59 - the brackets
08:00 - it just printed the characters that were
08:02 - inside of that
08:03 - so you could change that you know we
08:05 - could make that say something else
08:06 - like share subscribe
08:10 - right and we save our file hop over to
08:14 - powershell
08:16 - and there it is it's changed what's
08:18 - being printed remember
08:20 - at any point cls will clear our
08:22 - powershell window away
08:24 - so one other thing that is sometimes
08:26 - useful when we're writing our programs
08:28 - is
08:28 - sometimes we want to put notes in our
08:30 - code that don't actually get executed or
08:32 - run
08:33 - so we can do a single line comment using
08:34 - a hashtag so hashtag
08:36 - single line comment and this
08:40 - will not execute it won't affect how our
08:42 - code runs so if i save it
08:43 - now i'm using control s to save you can
08:46 - click file save
08:47 - it's all the same and then i run it
08:50 - oops you'll notice i'm not retyping oh
08:53 - what am i doing
08:54 - ah it's a crazy shortcut if i press the
08:57 - up
08:57 - arrow in powershell and i can press it
08:59 - more than once it'll bring up previously
09:01 - entered commands
09:02 - so it's a nice way to save some time hit
09:04 - enter
09:06 - you'll see it didn't affect how the
09:07 - program ran at all
09:09 - and i can do the same with multi-line
09:11 - comments so instead
09:12 - you can use triple single quotes so
09:15 - these are next to the enter key without
09:16 - holding down shift
09:19 - three of them to open three of them to
09:21 - close this
09:22 - is a multi-line comment
09:27 - and you can go as much as you want in
09:29 - between those triple quotes
09:31 - again save and
09:34 - run up enter and you'll see it did not
09:37 - affect the execution of the code
09:39 - at all okay so as far as your layout
09:42 - goes you're probably going to have a
09:43 - powershell window and a nobel plus plus
09:45 - window
09:45 - you'll probably be switching between
09:47 - them a lot i like to use alt
09:49 - tab on a windows machine to cycle
09:51 - between them but again you can click
09:52 - your way through it
09:53 - so this is the setup that i use when i'm
09:55 - on a windows computer or mac computer
09:58 - to do my coding and this is what i'll be
09:59 - doing in all of my videos
10:01 - let's just say that you don't have
10:02 - access to that type of system you still
10:04 - want to code along i'm going to show you
10:05 - my favorite
10:06 - recommended online ide that you can use
10:09 - to do this
10:10 - so let's check it out so my favorite is
10:12 - a website called codehscodehs.org and
10:16 - i'll throw a link in the description
10:18 - on cody jess you can go you can create a
10:20 - free account with google and they have a
10:22 - sandbox on code hs
10:23 - and what i love about the codehs sandbox
10:25 - so i can do my hello world
10:28 - uh cwc just so it distinguishes it for
10:31 - the
10:31 - code with connor create program now you
10:34 - can code in a lot of languages on here
10:35 - so the two that we'll use in this video
10:37 - series would be
10:38 - python3 and we might look at a couple
10:41 - that involve turtle graphics which would
10:42 - be the python turtle
10:43 - so if i just go to python 3 create my
10:46 - program
10:47 - it's going to give me an online coding
10:49 - interface you'll notice it defaulted to
10:51 - the hello world
10:52 - program and i can click run code and it
10:55 - gives me a little
10:56 - display right over here this is great
10:58 - it's all self-contained you can do it in
11:00 - a browser you can do it on a chromebook
11:02 - whatever and you'll be able to follow
11:03 - along with pretty much everything we do
11:04 - here you can even have multiple files in
11:06 - a single project
11:07 - if that's your thing you can even change
11:10 - your editor settings
11:11 - right you can throw down like an old
11:13 - school terminal vibe
11:15 - you can maximize your editor so another
11:17 - great resource now i use this with my
11:19 - students as well because there's some
11:20 - learning tools
11:21 - amazing learning content built in again
11:24 - not a sponsor
11:25 - just love the site so this would be my
11:28 - preferred online ide if you're going to
11:29 - follow the course
11:30 - i'll make sure things work with this
11:33 - obviously there's a there's a ton of
11:34 - other options out there there's replica
11:35 - and there's others
11:37 - and you're going to kind of find the one
11:38 - that you're interested in but that's how
11:39 - i'm going to do it so
11:40 - in the event that you want to do this
11:42 - without using the windows setup
11:45 - this would be my option that i would
11:46 - recommend for you so that's the end of
11:48 - the first video
11:49 - hopefully that makes sense for you and
11:52 - hopefully that gives you kind of just
11:53 - that initial setup
11:55 - i didn't really talk much about the
11:56 - language and about programming kind of
11:58 - in a theoretical sense
11:59 - we'll hit on that a bit more in the next
12:00 - video when we actually start coding
12:02 - talking about variables and and really
12:04 - execution
12:05 - and what coding is thanks for watching
12:08 - don't forget to like subscribe
12:09 - share the videos and i hope you enjoy
12:11 - comment and i'll hit you back
12:13 - have a great day

Cleaned transcript:

hello humans welcome to code with connor this is your first time here thanks for coming in we're going to learn some python in this video series so if this is video 1a so we're going to start unit one by just introducing what python is uh talk a little bit what you need to do to get set up and get coding we'll give you a few options so that you can code along uh with these videos uh and then we'll kind of get rolling from there if you wanna learn more about me uh let me know in the comments and i'll post a video about it but for right now we'll just stick to the code so if you're here you're probably interested in learning something about python maybe somebody told you can make a lot of money uh as a programmer uh maybe you just want to know it because you think it's cool and it's got a cool sound a name either way i'm glad you're here first thing you're going to need is you're going to need the ability to run python scripts now i'm going to go through a series of instructions over the next few minutes about installing this stuff on a windows computer it'll be a very similar process on a mac os or a linux machine if you're going to be running this on a chromebook or a tablet or a phone you can just check in the call in the description of the video and i'll i'll chapter this thing up you can skip ahead to the section where i'll talk about some options you can use if you're doing it mobile let's get into it i'm just on chrome here and i've just gone to the python website it's python.org and i clicked on downloads okay so you're gonna need to download python to your computer so i'm gonna download python 3.91 this is the latest version of when i'm recording this video if python 4 is out when you're watching it you should probably download python 3 just because i imagine there'll be some major changes as they move from 3 to 4. so make sure you note where you download it download chrome's going to download the file and i'm going to open it up so it's going to ask me if there's one important piece here when you install this on a windows machine because of how we're going to use python it's really helpful for us if we add python as a path okay and this is going to allow us in powershell to use the python command which is just fantastic and it makes running our simple programs while we're learning really easy so we're going to do that cool install now awesome there we go python's installed close awesome now writing your actual python code you can use an ide an integrated development environment there's large scale ones there's tiny ones when i'm writing python i'm writing small scripts i'm teaching people i don't need the big convoluted debugging tools and all of that so i'm going to go to my go my goto favorite and this is what i'm going to use in the videos notepad plus plus i love notepad plus plus if we hop over here to download you can go in here and you can download the latest version so here's the 7.88 release click on that and then you can download it to your windows machine again take note of where you download it and then we're going to run the installer so i'm going to download the 64bit installer here and we'll save it and we'll launch it choose a language we go next accept next next and just like that we are up and running pam there we go so notepad plus plus is installed so these two things together are going to be our environment we're going to write our code in notepad plus plus then we're going to use python which is installed on the computer to actually run it now that we have nova plus plus installed and we have python installed we're ready to start kind of writing code we're going to write our code in notepad plus plus we're going to use windows powershell to actually run our code so first time we pull up windows powershell all we're going to do is we're going to start menu and we're going to type power this is one of many ways to do it and then once we launch powershell it's going to look something like this it's called windows powershell now it might bring you to a different drive obviously than the one i'm in so the one thing we're going to need to do from an organization standpoint is you're going to want a folder on your pc where you're going to save all your python scripts so you can make it something simple like you can navigate to this pc to your c drive whatever and then you can do it that way so so on your computer if you are on your pc and you go to your c drive this is one of the easiest things if you just right click and make a new folder call it like share subscribe right and then that folder can be where we save all of our python scripts so this way it's going to make it easy for us to access it so if we hop over here to our powershell we can see that if i go to c colon and i hit enter and then i'm going to use a couple of commands so i can do cd dot dot it takes me back one directory so you'll see i go from my folder back to users i can do it again now i'm back in c drive there's another command called cd space and you can put the name of a directory so like and i can hit tab at any point it'll try to autofill it like share subscribe i hit enter and now i'm inside of that folder so i'm in c colon like share subscribe and so this is where i'll be when i run commands if you ever want to clear your powershell you can do cls and it's gone okay you know pretty simple set of commands that we're going to use you you'll sometimes use cd dot dot or you'll use cd space and then start typing in a folder name and the last command we'll use will be python and we'll use that in just a minute so let's hop over here to our notepad plus plus and our powershell environments in notepad plus plus we'll go over just a very quick program and then we're going to end this video and then we'll get ready for moving on to the next one we're actually diving into stuff a little bit more so the very first program that we write in the world of programming and software development is always the hello world program and it seems to be going on for a long time it was the first program i wrote in java back i don't know 20 years ago and it's still the first program i teach my students so it looks something like this in python we're going to type print and we're going to open a set of parentheses parentheses are our curved brackets and then in quotation marks so quotation marks are just left to the enter key on your keyboard we're going to write hello world exclamation point then we're going to close our quotation marks and we're going to close our parentheses it's important in coding and you'll see this if you've learned any html or anything before that what we open we have to close all right so we open the brackets we open the quotes we type it we close we close and then we're going to go through the process how we run it so we're going to save this so i'm going to go to file and this one time i'm going to do save as but from now on i'm just going to do file save and i'm going to find my folder c drive like share subscribe and we're going to call this hello world dot p y and the dot p y is important because the dot p y is a file extension that tells windows this is a python script it also will tell python to read it as such and i hit save you'll notice my notepad plus plus is color coded once you save it as a dot py nobel plus plus will recognize python code and help color code elements for you until you've saved it it's not going to do that it's just going to see raw text so it's helpful to save your files at the beginning so you get those nice colors to help you kind of organize your code so now when it's time to run it we actually will leave nova plus plus and go to powershell and in here we're going to type python space and then we're going to type the name of the file and again we don't take the whole name we can hit tab at any point that we think we have enough characters to make it unique and there it is pythonhelloworld.py and when i hit enter it prints to the console hello world exclamation point so it printed the literal string that was inside of these quotation marks it didn't print the quotes it didn't print the brackets it just printed the characters that were inside of that so you could change that you know we could make that say something else like share subscribe right and we save our file hop over to powershell and there it is it's changed what's being printed remember at any point cls will clear our powershell window away so one other thing that is sometimes useful when we're writing our programs is sometimes we want to put notes in our code that don't actually get executed or run so we can do a single line comment using a hashtag so hashtag single line comment and this will not execute it won't affect how our code runs so if i save it now i'm using control s to save you can click file save it's all the same and then i run it oops you'll notice i'm not retyping oh what am i doing ah it's a crazy shortcut if i press the up arrow in powershell and i can press it more than once it'll bring up previously entered commands so it's a nice way to save some time hit enter you'll see it didn't affect how the program ran at all and i can do the same with multiline comments so instead you can use triple single quotes so these are next to the enter key without holding down shift three of them to open three of them to close this is a multiline comment and you can go as much as you want in between those triple quotes again save and run up enter and you'll see it did not affect the execution of the code at all okay so as far as your layout goes you're probably going to have a powershell window and a nobel plus plus window you'll probably be switching between them a lot i like to use alt tab on a windows machine to cycle between them but again you can click your way through it so this is the setup that i use when i'm on a windows computer or mac computer to do my coding and this is what i'll be doing in all of my videos let's just say that you don't have access to that type of system you still want to code along i'm going to show you my favorite recommended online ide that you can use to do this so let's check it out so my favorite is a website called codehscodehs.org and i'll throw a link in the description on cody jess you can go you can create a free account with google and they have a sandbox on code hs and what i love about the codehs sandbox so i can do my hello world uh cwc just so it distinguishes it for the code with connor create program now you can code in a lot of languages on here so the two that we'll use in this video series would be python3 and we might look at a couple that involve turtle graphics which would be the python turtle so if i just go to python 3 create my program it's going to give me an online coding interface you'll notice it defaulted to the hello world program and i can click run code and it gives me a little display right over here this is great it's all selfcontained you can do it in a browser you can do it on a chromebook whatever and you'll be able to follow along with pretty much everything we do here you can even have multiple files in a single project if that's your thing you can even change your editor settings right you can throw down like an old school terminal vibe you can maximize your editor so another great resource now i use this with my students as well because there's some learning tools amazing learning content built in again not a sponsor just love the site so this would be my preferred online ide if you're going to follow the course i'll make sure things work with this obviously there's a there's a ton of other options out there there's replica and there's others and you're going to kind of find the one that you're interested in but that's how i'm going to do it so in the event that you want to do this without using the windows setup this would be my option that i would recommend for you so that's the end of the first video hopefully that makes sense for you and hopefully that gives you kind of just that initial setup i didn't really talk much about the language and about programming kind of in a theoretical sense we'll hit on that a bit more in the next video when we actually start coding talking about variables and and really execution and what coding is thanks for watching don't forget to like subscribe share the videos and i hope you enjoy comment and i'll hit you back have a great day
