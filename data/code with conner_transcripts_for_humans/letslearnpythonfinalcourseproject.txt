00:01 - hello humans
00:03 - welcome back to code with connor this is
00:05 - the let's learn
00:06 - python tutorial series and this is the
00:08 - end
00:09 - this is the end of course project we
00:12 - have come
00:13 - so far from someone who did not know how
00:16 - to write a single line of code did not
00:17 - know what a variable was
00:18 - did not know what printing was knew
00:21 - nothing about coding and maybe that's
00:23 - not you but i'm going to assume it is
00:25 - and now we're here we're doing a project
00:26 - and we're going to do a cool one well
00:29 - i think it's cool you might not think
00:30 - it's cool whatever we're into a project
00:32 - so i'm going to lay out a few options
00:34 - for the project i'm going to show you a
00:35 - couple of student examples
00:36 - that some of my students have made in
00:37 - the past you don't have to do this if
00:40 - you want to do something different
00:41 - go off script a little bit do it that's
00:44 - awesome
00:45 - but these are all examples that use the
00:47 - skills that we've already put in place
00:49 - and kind of push you to do that project
00:51 - design piece remember planning
00:53 - how are my functions going to work how
00:55 - am i going to actually make this thing
00:56 - do the thing i wanted to do and break it
00:59 - into chunks that i can write that code
01:01 - for
01:01 - and then get them to all connect
01:02 - together in the end right that's
01:04 - really what it's all about all right
01:07 - [Music]
01:08 - some choices hang man we all know
01:11 - hangman
01:12 - here's a puzzle guess the letters draw a
01:15 - little thingy
01:16 - right it's a classic game that kids play
01:20 - we can use the turtle graphics to draw a
01:21 - little thingy or we can just
01:23 - you know do it old school tic-tac-toe
01:26 - again turtle graphics plus console
01:29 - equals a nice game of tic-tac-toe
01:30 - just two-player you can go ai and kind
01:33 - of create a simple ai to play against
01:35 - again that's next level you've learned
01:37 - everything you need to learn to do it
01:38 - it's just a matter of doing it and
01:40 - writing the conditionals writing the
01:42 - random generators and
01:43 - doing all that there's no reason you
01:44 - can't rock paper scissors super simple
01:47 - game
01:48 - play against a random computer opponent
01:51 - and there you go
01:52 - okay ultimate tic-tac-toe you want to
01:54 - push yourself a little bit more
01:56 - this gets a little heavy if you don't
01:57 - know what ultimate tic-tac-toe is go
01:59 - check it out and how the rules work
02:01 - i will show you a quick example but it's
02:02 - just it's like tic-tac-toe
02:04 - but times like 10 because it's a lot
02:06 - harder to write but that's okay it's
02:08 - there and we'll see how it works
02:10 - all right let's jump in and have a quick
02:11 - look at kind of the different examples
02:13 - and how they work i'm not going to show
02:14 - you code i'm just going to show you
02:16 - running projects
02:18 - all right so here we are with a hangman
02:20 - example
02:21 - so you'll see the two things happening
02:23 - i've got the console terminal over here
02:25 - and then i've got my turtle graphics
02:27 - window over here
02:28 - it says you have six wrong guesses left
02:30 - guess and this is my puzzle
02:32 - right here it's showing me there are
02:34 - characters so r
02:36 - good job that was in the work so r is
02:39 - there it shows me i haven't incorrectly
02:40 - guessed anything yet
02:42 - and it didn't draw anything in hangman
02:43 - okay s
02:45 - so it drew a circle no s in the word s
02:49 - is now in the list of words
02:51 - letters that are no good t so no good
02:54 - true another line l
02:58 - oh no good n all right that's in the
03:02 - word all right we got an n in there
03:04 - okay e no e so we got a lag drawn over
03:08 - there
03:09 - oh oh okay let's r a all right
03:12 - we got an a okay maybe it's
03:16 - anchor let's do a c okay let's do an h
03:20 - and i know hey oh and then we win
03:24 - and then we're out so there's an example
03:27 - of hangman and how that works let's jump
03:29 - in look at the next one
03:30 - which is rock paper scissors so this one
03:33 - is just on the terminal
03:34 - so again we get the asiar welcome what
03:36 - would you like to be called
03:38 - okay i'll be called code with connor
03:42 - boom and then ask me just type it out as
03:45 - it is rock paper scissors
03:46 - rock okay so i choose rock i tied the
03:49 - computer
03:50 - they must have chose rock too let's do
03:52 - paper
03:54 - i choose paper i win we covered the cpu
03:57 - and now you can see i have one win the
03:59 - computer is zero so it's tracking my
04:00 - wins
04:02 - paper paper oh i lost
04:06 - scissors i won scissors
04:10 - tied rock rock rock rock
04:14 - rock paper scissors
04:19 - right you get the idea can i play now
04:22 - this one we'd probably want to add a
04:24 - little bit more like how do you end
04:25 - how many rounds you want to do you know
04:27 - maybe a little more functionality in the
04:29 - menu
04:29 - but you get the basic idea of the game
04:31 - it's creating that system where
04:33 - you've got the user input so we're
04:34 - comparing it to get something we've got
04:35 - some kind of uh
04:36 - maybe a list or this is better than this
04:38 - this but in this case conditional
04:40 - statements in there
04:41 - so that's an example of rock paper
04:42 - scissors all right this one's an example
04:44 - of tic tac
04:45 - toe so you can see i got my board over
04:47 - here
04:48 - and i'm just using the standard zero one
04:50 - two zero one two zero one two
04:52 - notation for the rows and columns so
04:54 - upper left corner would be 0 0
04:57 - and i'm player x so it draws an x on my
04:59 - turtle
05:00 - okay next player maybe i want to do oh
05:03 - we're going to talk in the middle
05:04 - sure so that's 0 1 2 so 1
05:08 - row would be one column would be one
05:11 - so there's an o drawn different color
05:13 - great
05:15 - all right so we'll try to i don't know
05:17 - set this guy up i don't think it's going
05:18 - to work but let's try it out
05:20 - so let's do 2 2. throw an x in that
05:23 - corner
05:24 - okay so let's say that o is kind of
05:26 - thinking i don't know i'm going to do an
05:28 - up and down line so always going to go
05:29 - 2 and 1 2
05:33 - all right and then x is going to block
05:35 - that up top
05:37 - so zero and one
05:40 - all right cool now always going to block
05:42 - x in the top corner
05:45 - so row zero column two
05:49 - and you have error protection in here so
05:51 - they can't input a value outside you
05:52 - have air protection but they can't go on
05:53 - top of somebody else
05:55 - so like if i do one one space is already
05:58 - taken
05:58 - i can't do that right so having those
06:01 - pieces in there is going to be important
06:03 - to make sure that it works
06:04 - so we'll do row two column zero
06:08 - and there we go so let's just say i was
06:09 - not very smart here so we go
06:11 - one two okay and then x has a chance to
06:15 - win
06:16 - so one zero and then we get the line it
06:20 - says we won
06:21 - amazing do i want to play again nah i'm
06:24 - good
06:25 - all right ultimate tic-tac-toe it's like
06:27 - regular tic-tac-toe except there's
06:28 - nine tic-tac-toe boards and the
06:30 - difference is when
06:31 - a player makes a play within a mini
06:33 - board the position
06:35 - of that play and the mini board dictates
06:38 - which
06:38 - mini board the next player gets to use
06:41 - and the goal is to win mini boards
06:45 - in the right order that you create a
06:47 - line of mini board wins
06:50 - just like a regular tic-tac-toe game so
06:52 - essentially you're playing nine
06:52 - different tic-tac-toe games
06:54 - and the winner of each of those games
06:55 - dictates who gets that spot
06:58 - in the larger board right so we're gonna
07:01 - start
07:02 - in the middle so we'll do this one he
07:04 - used one two three
07:05 - so two two all right so we're in the
07:07 - middle
07:08 - we are going to go in the top left hand
07:09 - corner of the middle one one
07:11 - so c top left hand corner of the middle
07:14 - grid
07:15 - okay but now i'm up here so now i'm in
07:17 - the top left-hand square
07:19 - so now i'm going to go on the bottom
07:21 - right hand corner of this so
07:23 - 3 3. okay and now i'm down here
07:26 - right and so now my next player has to
07:28 - be down there so i'm going to go 2-2 in
07:30 - the middle
07:31 - and that brings me back to the middle
07:32 - square right where someone might be like
07:34 - 2-2 but that keeps us in the middle
07:36 - okay so now i'm gonna go like i don't
07:38 - know one three
07:41 - all right but that now sticks me up here
07:43 - i can't block that o right now because
07:44 - i'm not there
07:45 - i'm stuck up here now right so 1
07:48 - 1 okay cool but that brings me over here
07:51 - and this is how it works
07:52 - and then you have to win the little
07:53 - squares to eventually win the big square
07:55 - and you want to add the drawing and all
07:57 - the fancy this is a tough program i've
07:59 - had
07:59 - three students attempt it two students
08:02 - do it successfully
08:03 - it's a tough one but it's awesome and it
08:05 - uses all those skills that we've been
08:07 - working on in the course
08:08 - so get out there try one of these course
08:10 - projects again
08:11 - do it somewhere you could share it take
08:12 - your code dump it into replica dump it
08:14 - into code hs
08:16 - sandbox and share the link in the
08:17 - comments so we can check it out
08:19 - if i get some good ones i'll throw them
08:20 - on my website as well thank you for
08:22 - doing the course i think it's awesome
08:24 - that you're here and you're trying to
08:25 - learn a new skill whether you're doing
08:27 - it for school like
08:28 - actual traditional school or you're just
08:30 - doing it for your own learning you're
08:31 - doing something right you could be
08:32 - playing minecraft or call of duty right
08:34 - now or fortnite or
08:35 - apex or whatever other game but instead
08:37 - you're here trying to learn how
08:38 - all that stuff actually gets made which
08:40 - is really cool
08:41 - because we're content consumers all the
08:44 - time but we don't often understand the
08:46 - content that we're consuming and how
08:47 - it's made
08:48 - so thank you for being here i think it's
08:49 - awesome this won't be the end
08:51 - we'll do some other stuff as well maybe
08:53 - something a little more advanced i'd
08:54 - love to do something with java unity
08:56 - and hopefully you'll come back and check
08:57 - that out as well so have a good one
08:59 - thank you for being here like share
09:01 - subscribe let other people know what i'm
09:02 - doing
09:03 - and we'll see you back here hopefully
09:05 - not too long from now
09:07 - see ya you're awesome

Cleaned transcript:

hello humans welcome back to code with connor this is the let's learn python tutorial series and this is the end this is the end of course project we have come so far from someone who did not know how to write a single line of code did not know what a variable was did not know what printing was knew nothing about coding and maybe that's not you but i'm going to assume it is and now we're here we're doing a project and we're going to do a cool one well i think it's cool you might not think it's cool whatever we're into a project so i'm going to lay out a few options for the project i'm going to show you a couple of student examples that some of my students have made in the past you don't have to do this if you want to do something different go off script a little bit do it that's awesome but these are all examples that use the skills that we've already put in place and kind of push you to do that project design piece remember planning how are my functions going to work how am i going to actually make this thing do the thing i wanted to do and break it into chunks that i can write that code for and then get them to all connect together in the end right that's really what it's all about all right some choices hang man we all know hangman here's a puzzle guess the letters draw a little thingy right it's a classic game that kids play we can use the turtle graphics to draw a little thingy or we can just you know do it old school tictactoe again turtle graphics plus console equals a nice game of tictactoe just twoplayer you can go ai and kind of create a simple ai to play against again that's next level you've learned everything you need to learn to do it it's just a matter of doing it and writing the conditionals writing the random generators and doing all that there's no reason you can't rock paper scissors super simple game play against a random computer opponent and there you go okay ultimate tictactoe you want to push yourself a little bit more this gets a little heavy if you don't know what ultimate tictactoe is go check it out and how the rules work i will show you a quick example but it's just it's like tictactoe but times like 10 because it's a lot harder to write but that's okay it's there and we'll see how it works all right let's jump in and have a quick look at kind of the different examples and how they work i'm not going to show you code i'm just going to show you running projects all right so here we are with a hangman example so you'll see the two things happening i've got the console terminal over here and then i've got my turtle graphics window over here it says you have six wrong guesses left guess and this is my puzzle right here it's showing me there are characters so r good job that was in the work so r is there it shows me i haven't incorrectly guessed anything yet and it didn't draw anything in hangman okay s so it drew a circle no s in the word s is now in the list of words letters that are no good t so no good true another line l oh no good n all right that's in the word all right we got an n in there okay e no e so we got a lag drawn over there oh oh okay let's r a all right we got an a okay maybe it's anchor let's do a c okay let's do an h and i know hey oh and then we win and then we're out so there's an example of hangman and how that works let's jump in look at the next one which is rock paper scissors so this one is just on the terminal so again we get the asiar welcome what would you like to be called okay i'll be called code with connor boom and then ask me just type it out as it is rock paper scissors rock okay so i choose rock i tied the computer they must have chose rock too let's do paper i choose paper i win we covered the cpu and now you can see i have one win the computer is zero so it's tracking my wins paper paper oh i lost scissors i won scissors tied rock rock rock rock rock paper scissors right you get the idea can i play now this one we'd probably want to add a little bit more like how do you end how many rounds you want to do you know maybe a little more functionality in the menu but you get the basic idea of the game it's creating that system where you've got the user input so we're comparing it to get something we've got some kind of uh maybe a list or this is better than this this but in this case conditional statements in there so that's an example of rock paper scissors all right this one's an example of tic tac toe so you can see i got my board over here and i'm just using the standard zero one two zero one two zero one two notation for the rows and columns so upper left corner would be 0 0 and i'm player x so it draws an x on my turtle okay next player maybe i want to do oh we're going to talk in the middle sure so that's 0 1 2 so 1 row would be one column would be one so there's an o drawn different color great all right so we'll try to i don't know set this guy up i don't think it's going to work but let's try it out so let's do 2 2. throw an x in that corner okay so let's say that o is kind of thinking i don't know i'm going to do an up and down line so always going to go 2 and 1 2 all right and then x is going to block that up top so zero and one all right cool now always going to block x in the top corner so row zero column two and you have error protection in here so they can't input a value outside you have air protection but they can't go on top of somebody else so like if i do one one space is already taken i can't do that right so having those pieces in there is going to be important to make sure that it works so we'll do row two column zero and there we go so let's just say i was not very smart here so we go one two okay and then x has a chance to win so one zero and then we get the line it says we won amazing do i want to play again nah i'm good all right ultimate tictactoe it's like regular tictactoe except there's nine tictactoe boards and the difference is when a player makes a play within a mini board the position of that play and the mini board dictates which mini board the next player gets to use and the goal is to win mini boards in the right order that you create a line of mini board wins just like a regular tictactoe game so essentially you're playing nine different tictactoe games and the winner of each of those games dictates who gets that spot in the larger board right so we're gonna start in the middle so we'll do this one he used one two three so two two all right so we're in the middle we are going to go in the top left hand corner of the middle one one so c top left hand corner of the middle grid okay but now i'm up here so now i'm in the top lefthand square so now i'm going to go on the bottom right hand corner of this so 3 3. okay and now i'm down here right and so now my next player has to be down there so i'm going to go 22 in the middle and that brings me back to the middle square right where someone might be like 22 but that keeps us in the middle okay so now i'm gonna go like i don't know one three all right but that now sticks me up here i can't block that o right now because i'm not there i'm stuck up here now right so 1 1 okay cool but that brings me over here and this is how it works and then you have to win the little squares to eventually win the big square and you want to add the drawing and all the fancy this is a tough program i've had three students attempt it two students do it successfully it's a tough one but it's awesome and it uses all those skills that we've been working on in the course so get out there try one of these course projects again do it somewhere you could share it take your code dump it into replica dump it into code hs sandbox and share the link in the comments so we can check it out if i get some good ones i'll throw them on my website as well thank you for doing the course i think it's awesome that you're here and you're trying to learn a new skill whether you're doing it for school like actual traditional school or you're just doing it for your own learning you're doing something right you could be playing minecraft or call of duty right now or fortnite or apex or whatever other game but instead you're here trying to learn how all that stuff actually gets made which is really cool because we're content consumers all the time but we don't often understand the content that we're consuming and how it's made so thank you for being here i think it's awesome this won't be the end we'll do some other stuff as well maybe something a little more advanced i'd love to do something with java unity and hopefully you'll come back and check that out as well so have a good one thank you for being here like share subscribe let other people know what i'm doing and we'll see you back here hopefully not too long from now see ya you're awesome
