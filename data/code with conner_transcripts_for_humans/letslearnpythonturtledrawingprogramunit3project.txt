00:02 - hello humans and welcome back to let's
00:04 - learn python on code with connor i'm
00:06 - adam
00:07 - we're here in the unit 3 project
00:10 - let's get right into it this is going to
00:12 - be a good one
00:14 - so here we are we are going to take uh
00:17 - the user menu that we used earlier in
00:19 - this unit for turtle graphics
00:21 - and we are going to extend it into a
00:24 - drawing program
00:26 - so you'll see my menu choices have uh
00:28 - kind of blown up a little bit
00:30 - so i've got a to q so i've got forward
00:33 - backward left right pen up pen down
00:37 - pen size color draw polygon draw square
00:40 - draw triangle
00:41 - those are familiar draw star draw spyro
00:45 - draw circle clear screen move turtle and
00:48 - quit program
00:49 - all these functions in here now some of
00:51 - them are repeats so we don't have to
00:52 - redo all of our code we can use that
00:54 - base structure
00:55 - to help build what we're going to do
00:57 - here so the nice thing here that it's
00:58 - not just
01:00 - it's not limited to just the shapes we
01:02 - can do
01:03 - manual drawing here as well so i can
01:05 - just move my turtle forward by
01:07 - 200 pixels okay and then i can
01:11 - turn my turtle to the left by 135
01:14 - degrees
01:15 - and then move my turtle forward 400
01:18 - pixels
01:19 - and then i can turn my turtle right
01:23 - by 45 degrees and i can go backwards 100
01:27 - pixels
01:28 - and so you can start to see how i have
01:30 - this manual control now
01:31 - and now i could draw a circle right
01:34 - radius of
01:36 - oh i don't know 200 pixels
01:40 - so we have control over this drawing
01:42 - program so now i can clear my screen
01:44 - oh and it's gone i can move my
01:47 - thing back to zero zero there it goes
01:50 - i can change my color now i did a sub
01:52 - menu for the color
01:54 - choose from the following colors blue
01:55 - red green black orange so let's do
01:57 - orange so now it's orange so if i do a
02:01 - forward by 400 now you can see the lines
02:03 - orange
02:05 - so yeah you kind of get the idea of what
02:07 - we're looking at with this program
02:09 - there's going to be a lot of pieces in
02:11 - terms of what you might want to do
02:13 - you can change it up if you want to
02:15 - change it up move turtle
02:17 - back to zero zero let's change it to
02:20 - yellow and draw a star so
02:22 - color yellow let's make my pen size
02:26 - 10 and then let's draw a star
02:31 - 400
02:35 - we got to start so play around with what
02:37 - you can do with this program but it's
02:39 - great that we can now create this kind
02:40 - of graphics program
02:42 - that uses functions and you can extend
02:44 - this in the future if you wanted to
02:46 - maybe incorporate mouse events or mouse
02:47 - clicks
02:48 - which should be a really cool thing to
02:50 - do but this is going to build off
02:51 - something you already did which is
02:53 - really important in programming to reuse
02:55 - code our code or other code that's
02:57 - already there in our code base and then
02:59 - expanding on that to make it function
03:01 - the way that we want so this is what
03:03 - you're going to do for your unit 3
03:04 - project
03:05 - hopefully it goes well share with me i'd
03:06 - love to see some of the stuff that you
03:07 - guys
03:08 - create and i hope that you figure it out
03:10 - if you have questions or comments
03:12 - hit me up in the comment section and as
03:14 - always thank you so much for being here
03:16 - you're doing something great i hope
03:18 - you're a great human
03:19 - i'll see you back in unit number four
03:21 - like share subscribe if that's your
03:23 - thing
03:23 - it helps me out i don't know if that's
03:25 - your thing either way
03:26 - we'll see you soon have a good one
