00:04 - hello and
00:05 - welcome this is the let's learn python
00:08 - tutorial series here on code with connor
00:10 - my name is adam connor i am a high
00:12 - school math computer science teacher
00:14 - and i'm excited to teach some python i
00:16 - just want to take a minute and go
00:18 - through the course
00:19 - so you know what's coming up and then
00:21 - yeah you can come to the next video if
00:22 - you want to just jump start right into
00:24 - it
00:24 - in the course each unit is going to
00:27 - include a series of videos depending on
00:29 - the size of the unit might depend on
00:30 - whether it's three videos or five videos
00:32 - in each video i'm gonna do guided
00:34 - examples with you as i
00:35 - explain a topic i'm gonna leave you with
00:37 - a coding challenge at the end of the
00:39 - lesson
00:39 - something for you to go off and complete
00:41 - on your own and then obviously after the
00:42 - first video
00:43 - i'll be starting them with quick
00:45 - solution to the previous challenge so
00:46 - just so that you don't feel lost
00:48 - if you're not keeping up and then
00:49 - obviously the end of that video will
00:50 - give you a new challenge at the end of
00:52 - each unit i'll give you a unit project
00:53 - if you want to go off and try it on your
00:54 - own and then share what you did with me
00:56 - uh post it in the comments
00:58 - or let me know where i can find it and
00:59 - i'll go have a look excited to see what
01:01 - you guys
01:01 - create and any spins that you put on it
01:03 - so what are we going to cover
01:04 - i'm going to go through five units on a
01:06 - project we're gonna start with the
01:07 - basics where we go through comments
01:08 - printing
01:09 - variables and their types we'll go
01:11 - through the math and the random
01:12 - libraries
01:12 - we'll go through user input for console
01:14 - programs in unit 2 we're going to do
01:16 - decision making
01:17 - so this includes boolean variables and
01:19 - statements it includes conditional and
01:21 - logical operators
01:23 - if l if and else statements a short
01:25 - circuit evaluation for while loops
01:27 - turtle graphics a little bit of turtle
01:29 - graphics we're not going to do anything
01:30 - crazy
01:31 - and then nested loops unit 3 we're going
01:33 - to talk all about functions this is
01:34 - where we start to get into like program
01:36 - execution this is like
01:37 - core stuff for any programming language
01:39 - so we'll talk about no parameter and
01:40 - return functions we'll talk about
01:42 - functions that take parameters functions
01:44 - that return values we'll look at try and
01:46 - accept statements
01:47 - and then we'll talk about globals versus
01:48 - a call and return structure for your
01:50 - program unifor is going to go into
01:52 - strings specifically so like words and
01:54 - sentences
01:54 - we're going to look at indexing
01:55 - substrings immutability of strings
01:57 - we're going to look at looping through a
01:59 - string and functions
02:01 - last unit is unit 5 where we're going to
02:02 - look at data structures so data
02:04 - structures we're going to look at tuples
02:05 - and index notation
02:07 - we're going to look at lists which are
02:08 - really powerful and list functions
02:10 - we're going to talk about
02:11 - two-dimensional lists and unpacking and
02:13 - packing lists into variables
02:15 - and then lastly we'll touch briefly on
02:17 - dictionaries keys and the in
02:19 - keyword in python then we're going to
02:21 - wrap it up with a end of course project
02:23 - so i'll present a few different options
02:25 - to you that you might want to do as an
02:26 - intercourse project
02:27 - and obviously these are things you can
02:29 - find online for you know if you want to
02:31 - just go and find a project that walks
02:32 - you through the code
02:33 - do that that's great but if your goal
02:36 - here is to actually walk away with any
02:37 - real understanding
02:38 - that's going to come from actually
02:40 - coding you know it's going to come from
02:42 - the i'm typing code for two hours and i
02:46 - can't figure out why
02:47 - my code won't compile and working your
02:50 - way through those kinds of challenges
02:51 - is how you're going to learn to program
02:54 - if your goal is just to make something
02:55 - cool and not actually understand
02:56 - anything behind it
02:57 - there's lots of great instructables out
02:59 - there and other great resources
03:01 - to build a tic-tac-toe game or to build
03:03 - whatever and they'll walk you through
03:04 - every line of code
03:06 - but it's not going to help you when you
03:07 - go to do your first project on your own
03:10 - or go to contribute to a github repo
03:12 - you're not going to
03:13 - be able to do that because you're not
03:15 - going to understand any of the actual
03:16 - code
03:17 - one of the biggest eye openers for me
03:18 - when i first started looking into
03:20 - actually working as a developer was the
03:24 - ability to read and understand code
03:26 - so when you walk into a project and
03:28 - there's already a
03:29 - you know 300 400 file code base
03:32 - you've got to go through that code base
03:34 - and understand the structure
03:36 - before you can ever contribute to it and
03:38 - and that requires a pretty deep
03:39 - understanding of a lot of these concepts
03:41 - so
03:42 - you know by no means will this uh you
03:44 - know course equate to a four-year or
03:46 - you know two-year degree after high
03:48 - school but
03:49 - it should give you a good introduction
03:50 - to programming a good introduction to a
03:52 - language that's
03:53 - very user-friendly and the concepts from
03:55 - within this course are going to carry
03:56 - over
03:57 - to whatever else you want to learn
03:58 - afterwards i'm glad you're here
04:00 - if you like the videos be sure to like
04:02 - share subscribe
04:03 - keeps me going and yeah good luck
