00:00 - [Music]
00:05 - welcome to coding kids today I'm going
00:08 - to show you how to use the if block with
00:11 - this simple animation first let's have a
00:14 - look at what happens when we play it the
00:17 - player controls the cat by pressing the
00:19 - up down left and right arrow keys to
00:22 - move the cat around the screen we can
00:25 - see three other characters on the screen
00:27 - there is a fish an apple and a balloon
00:31 - when the cat catches the fish he says
00:33 - hello fish when the cat touches the
00:36 - Apple he saves yummy I like apples
00:40 - finally when the cat touches the balloon
00:42 - he says I like balloons can I take this
00:46 - one okay now let's build this animation
00:50 - there are three parts to this project
00:52 - one the backdrop to the cat three the
00:57 - fish the apple and the balloon for the
01:01 - speech bubbles now let's start building
01:04 - one step at a time first let's start
01:07 - with a brand new project by clicking the
01:10 - create button on the home page you will
01:13 - see a new project open with a cat as the
01:16 - default sprite a sprite is a character
01:19 - or object we use in making computer
01:21 - programs later we will use other sprites
01:24 - for the fish apple and balloon so step
01:28 - one we want to add a backdrop click on
01:31 - the miniature backdrop icon at the
01:33 - bottom left-hand corner of the screen
01:35 - now you can scroll through the backdrop
01:38 - library and select a backdrop you like I
01:41 - have chosen the pool backdrop but you
01:44 - can choose any backdrops you like now
01:46 - our game has a backdrop for step two we
01:50 - want to add some code to our cat sprite
01:52 - to do this make sure our cat is selected
01:55 - then go to the script tab located next
01:58 - to the stop sign in the center of the
02:00 - screen we want to make our cat move
02:03 - around the screen to do this we need to
02:06 - add the when space key pressed block
02:09 - which we find in the events tab
02:12 - drag four of these blocks into the
02:14 - workspace now click on the drop down
02:18 - arrow to change the space key to up
02:21 - arrow key down arrow key left arrow key
02:25 - and right arrow key now to make our cat
02:29 - move we want to add a motion block to
02:31 - each of these event blocks to move up or
02:34 - down we use the y-axis and to move left
02:37 - or right we use the x-axis to make the
02:41 - cat's move up with the up arrow we need
02:43 - a motion block that phase change y by 10
02:47 - add this block to Z when up arrow key
02:50 - pressed block now test it I cat moves
02:57 - upwards repeat this for the other arrow
03:00 - keys remembering that for down and left
03:02 - we use negative 10 for these opposite
03:05 - directions
03:13 - let's test our clothes great it works
03:20 - now we can move our cat around the
03:23 - screen by pressing the arrow keys for
03:26 - step three we're going to create our
03:28 - other sprites to import a new sprite we
03:31 - can click on the miniature sprite icon
03:32 - and select a sprite from the sprite
03:35 - library I will select three new sprites
03:37 - the fish the Apple and the balloon but
03:40 - you can choose different sprites to me
03:42 - if you like now play sea sprites in
03:45 - different positions around the screen
03:54 - for step four going to add more code to
03:57 - our cat so that when the cat touches
03:59 - these sprites he say something in a
04:01 - speech bubble to begin on a code we need
04:04 - a when green flag clicked block now if
04:07 - we think back to the animation we can
04:09 - recall that if the cat is touching a
04:12 - difference right then a speech bubble
04:14 - appears so we need an if-then block find
04:19 - this in the control category and added
04:21 - to the when green flag clicked block
04:23 - this allows us to make a decision as to
04:26 - when the cat will speak the cat only
04:28 - speaks Finnish is touching another
04:30 - sprite so we need to select the block
04:32 - called touching mouse pointer from the
04:35 - sensing category and put it into the top
04:38 - of our if then block click on the
04:40 - drop-down arrow and change mouse pointer
04:43 - to one of our other sprites fish one if
04:46 - the cat is touching the fish we want him
04:49 - to say hello fish in a speech bubble so
04:52 - we need a say hello for two secs block
04:55 - from the looks category places inside
04:58 - our if then loop notice how we select
05:02 - this from the looks category and not the
05:04 - sound category this is because our cat
05:07 - is talking using a speech bubble which
05:09 - does not make a sound now change hello
05:12 - to hello fish if you want you can change
05:16 - the two sexes to make him say the speech
05:18 - for longer or shorter I will change its
05:21 - 23 sex for a bit longer finally we need
05:25 - a forever Lee
05:26 - this means this condition is being
05:28 - checked continuously by the computer we
05:31 - can find a forever loop in the control
05:33 - category put the forever loop around the
05:36 - if vent loop now let's click on the
05:39 - green flag to test our code yay it works
05:42 - if we move our cat to touch the fish he
05:46 - saves hello fish now let's repeat this
05:49 - for the Apple and the balloon drag to
05:52 - more if then blocks into our forever
05:54 - loop again if the cat is touching
05:57 - another sprite he saved something so we
06:00 - need the touching mouse pointer block
06:02 - from fencing put this in the top of each
06:05 - if then block change mouse pointer to
06:09 - apple and balloon one using the drop
06:12 - down arrow now if our cat is touching
06:18 - the Apple he says yummy I like apples
06:21 - and diffused touching the balloon he
06:24 - says I like balloons can I take this one
06:27 - so we need the say hello for two secs
06:30 - block find this in the looks category
06:32 - and add this to each if then block
06:35 - change to sex 23 sex in each for the if
06:40 - then block with touching apple in the
06:42 - top change hello to yummy I like apples
06:46 - for the if then block with touching
06:49 - balloon one in the top change hello to
06:52 - highlight balloons can I take this one
06:58 - now let's click on the green flag and
07:01 - test our code
07:07 - it was when we move our cat around the
07:10 - screen to touch each sprite he say
07:13 - something different
