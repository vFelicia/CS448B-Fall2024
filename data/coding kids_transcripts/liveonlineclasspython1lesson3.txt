00:02 - okay so go through that court you click
00:09 - the code that's oh yeah yeah so it asks
00:14 - you something it's asking how many sides
00:17 - with the shape have you need your number
00:23 - now put you didn't put anything so say
00:27 - say for example you want to have an
00:31 - triangle so for triangle we have three
00:35 - sides three sides so we need to it's
00:41 - okay just run it again I think you need
00:44 - to run it again
00:46 - okay stop sharing by just to shame all
00:52 - right let's see say something
00:54 - can I see your code again you're not
00:56 - caught cause this one closed the share
01:33 - press inter-korea you fine so we just
01:50 - gonna go forward and next time you can
01:52 - share
02:12 - [Music]
02:41 - dabbing dabbing I'm going to use another
02:57 - four here like if I say for example for
03:07 - I in range and look back to code but for
03:13 - now I'm going to say use two knobs notes
03:18 - in one in together so we're gonna miss
03:22 - that their second for what's the
04:04 - different if I use one for loop in the
04:12 - another one so this second for its
04:16 - belonging to face
04:19 - forget about this one I'm going to break
04:27 - hashtag hashtag is for comment
04:32 - yeah hashtag do you know hash that we
04:35 - use hashtag here to put the comedy for
04:40 - example for saying what we have done so
04:44 - far so so what this happen when Spartan
05:00 - is going to run each long reign by each
05:04 - line from the top to the bottom when
05:07 - it's going to teach hashtag doesn't care
05:12 - about things just skip it we put this
05:27 - kind of comments not decide what we have
05:32 - done and what does it mean h4 so you can
05:37 - do it you can every class that we have
05:40 - comments you forgot next time just go
05:46 - through the comments and you remember
05:49 - what we are going to do it after why do
06:00 - teams guys for loops
06:40 - [Music]
06:45 - [Music]
06:51 - like it's going to messy going forward
08:08 - 10 pixel and then it's happened and it's
08:17 - going to execute again four times this
08:23 - one this one and this
08:28 - so we can do music
10:35 - whatever we have here and
10:40 - change the number I see can make those
10:51 - are some weird shapes looks like a
10:56 - flower if I kept going you look like
10:59 - this hour you can make changing you can
11:26 - change over the number and very fast
11:55 - fish
12:03 - [Music]
12:18 - [Music]
12:26 - [Music]
12:37 - [Music]
12:45 - [Music]
12:54 - [Music]
13:21 - actually point in painting our quotes
13:24 - the first one the first one to say
13:49 - [Music]
14:02 - [Music]
14:11 - [Music]
14:21 - [Music]
14:26 - now listen okay the first one it's okay
14:30 - Mizuki the first one is 20 connection so
15:00 - 20 20 I tried to make it 20 degree so
15:28 - it's fine it's dangerous 20 degree and
15:31 - now I'm here it's safe for I in range
15:38 - [Music]
15:44 - for example all shake sides should be
15:48 - similar and here's a messy net 20 again
16:00 - [Music]
16:07 - [Music]
16:19 - 20 degrees the same degree that we have
16:24 - the details are very introducing we are
16:27 - here in messy then I'm going back here
16:33 - I'm not going
16:34 - I'm going back in this line because you
16:38 - have to do it four times we finish for
16:42 - dries we're going to thank you for now
16:45 - I'm going to back to went backward fifty
16:50 - again from here I'm going to make left
17:12 - 20 this way there's a mother so it's
17:47 - going to 23 this way and again how many
17:58 - time another time for time for example
18:06 - granny's finish is going to back here so
18:09 - it's going to say again one time here
18:18 - one time here and then for time years so
18:22 - every all time he's going to execute
18:26 - five time in the loop though instead of
18:32 - just one time here and two times fifty
18:39 - one two three four five five time
18:50 - you should say for how much for five
19:03 - tornado
19:05 - so it's happened 20 times these two
19:08 - loops is how many times I think here one
19:14 - time here
19:15 - alright I'm here for time here so it's
19:19 - five thank you this one so if you go
19:23 - through and change your code who wants
19:27 - to show me the shape mine's also having
20:03 - a problem it says funny funny does not
20:07 - match any outside pretty cool shape what
20:41 - [Music]
20:50 - [Music]
21:03 - [Music]
21:09 - [Music]
21:18 - [Music]
21:34 - [Music]
21:45 - half of a cylinder it looks like the
22:14 - bottom of the table could be this makes
22:17 - our imagination Cory what you did you
22:27 - change your numbers in quotes to see
22:29 - what we have Clutton did you change your
22:33 - so everyone was once we have a different
22:37 - numbers in your code what we're gonna
22:40 - have as the shape different unique shape
22:42 - what's your unique shape well I haven't
22:44 - changed you can't change you to music
22:50 - you can change
22:54 - [Music]
23:11 - so we have mine it's not a shape
23:16 - it's a weird line just line yeah it's
23:20 - like just like it's like I don't know
23:22 - like come cough
23:31 - [Music]
24:32 - [Music]
24:59 - [Music]
25:46 - let's put steak and for a bit forward in
25:50 - the same well the second loop that you
25:57 - have inside the nested loop yeah that's
26:01 - one should be in the same line meet the
26:05 - previous code not know if you did that
26:08 - as me they not belonging to first loop
26:12 - we want to every one of those belong to
26:23 - okay let's see what we have is not the
26:26 - things that we have but let's see you
26:36 - didn't make a comment so you need to put
26:38 - you didn't make a comment in questions
26:41 - so you need is ask you a question about
26:45 - how many sites will be here in the show
26:48 - oh yeah what I got it here yeah okay it
26:54 - doesn't matter for now because you
26:56 - haven't used it
26:57 - you're right
27:07 - for more understanding do something put
27:10 - the comment that's we use hash use hash
27:15 - type or every every single lines that we
27:22 - have before two loops so if you put hash
27:26 - tags for question four sides all of
27:31 - those before
27:33 - could you do it now fully put the hash
27:42 - tag before question yeah before you know
27:51 - I did the first character so gold at the
27:57 - beginning part of the question so go to
28:02 - the I'm not here okay have a look it I'm
28:12 - going to back to my code have a look to
28:14 - Michael at how I put this nope nope here
28:22 - come here see my could you see my screen
28:27 - yes I can see I put the sharp here this
28:34 - one doesn't make
28:36 - but I'll just put the line as a
28:39 - declaration this one that's mean
28:43 - I asked Python to don't execute my code
28:48 - you can do it for a question side and
28:52 - anger as well till here what I look
29:02 - forward to show you to show you how I
29:07 - can use the camera to the number that I
29:10 - asked from the user here so the same
29:14 - that we've done here are going to say
29:16 - for our in rain
29:18 - so I'm gonna ask the user how many signs
29:22 - I'm gonna use the variable here the size
29:25 - that we ask yeah and then the angles
29:30 - that we divided from the sides you can
29:37 - change your quotes as well like ask me
30:02 - does it show me write something like
30:06 - yeah that's let's say to just green I'm
30:17 - back it does to doesn't make any shape
30:20 - doesn't actually at least trim Ron it's
30:31 - just a line again and it just makes a
30:39 - try ninja star looking thing mmm-hmm
30:44 - so you can use the variable as a science
30:48 - institute number if you put so sides and
30:54 - then for lift the angles aren't you I'm
31:11 - gonna delete this part the shape looks
31:47 - so cool Rarity's you can make cool
31:50 - things as well
32:06 - made it tiny hey lolly wrap the
32:13 - shaitaan' would you mind - sure do you
32:24 - want me just to run the shape of the
32:26 - code as well you know when is Ronnie I'd
32:34 - like to see how it's drawing wow that's
32:36 - cool so I went to a really curious
32:39 - what's your coats
32:41 - honey do that we're changing the numbers
32:46 - so could you share the codes oh yeah
32:49 - sure okay so you did four times every
33:02 - time and then 50mm but you changed okay
33:07 - you change the angles to 14 that's right
33:11 - it's ended up with a very cool shape and
33:16 - that could be run out now again how it's
33:19 - drawing whoa okay see how it's game bill
33:30 - doesn't show us how it's drawing it's
33:54 - gone
33:55 - very technical difficulties
34:02 - I can't show my I show it I can't show
34:16 - how it's game drawn and just show what
34:18 - the finishing touches for quite um you
34:21 - shouldn't like share it before you run
34:24 - it see like share it and then you run it
34:27 - afterwards yeah I can't
34:32 - running moto so I lied sharing the um
34:51 - yeah I do I did the same that Utah
34:54 - so forget about like that
35:17 - that's a hands like that
35:22 - like it when I try to do it it says
35:35 - unexpected incident
35:52 - [Music]
35:55 - are you haven't put the comments in to
36:00 - courts after the first for loop so here
36:05 - you need to put the comments yeah did
36:09 - you need to yes
36:12 - yeah touched us to hashtag and you know
36:27 - how to put the hashtag others to just
36:30 - press we're about to finish just run
36:46 - this one see if you have any problem and
36:49 - there is something happen
36:51 - Oh show it again because you have a
36:54 - problem
36:55 - you have something stay in your second
37:03 - new your second look is not belonging to
37:07 - fair slope because you know that because
37:10 - what Harry could you tell others that
37:19 - was the problem here so in the second
37:36 - for loop you should put it inside in the
37:39 - same line that's mean you know in the
37:44 - same line that you have for forward and
37:47 - left see my court this one it's all in
37:53 - the same line this two point what we
37:59 - longing to you
38:00 - this fourth that's why they are in a
38:03 - wonderful
38:12 - [Music]
38:27 - music did you get it yeah I'm doing I'm
38:33 - doing much it looks like on your screen
38:37 - okay so let's remember whenever we need
38:41 - to put in that in the same line
38:45 - otherwise like we wanna step back see
38:50 - what's happened we don't have the same
38:52 - shape that we have this is a different
38:55 - shape because these two are belonging to
39:03 - this forward one yeah it doesn't really
39:05 - really weird shape well it's not a shame
39:08 - it's not the same shape that I expected
39:12 - yes so that's because these four are not
39:16 - belonging to disk or anymore it's not
39:19 - nested when I put one step forward
39:23 - that's the same this same myself going
39:30 - same line straight then the other one
39:33 - that means they are belonging it's true
39:38 - now I can see I have the same result
39:46 - I'm copy your coats Heron thank you and
39:52 - everybody joy hope you enjoy the class
39:57 - today tell me if you have any question
40:00 - the last question nothing my question
40:04 - okay just you can practice at home
40:08 - whenever you have oh it's nothing just
40:18 - another
40:19 - unexpected incidentally that's fine
40:22 - different cool different numbers and
40:28 - [Music]
40:29 - even weirder shake
40:32 - that's fun that's nice you can make your
40:37 - imagination it's not really shape that
40:52 - we run up the times hope you enjoyed and
40:56 - see you next time boys but thank you but
41:02 - rice Enix
41:03 - Craster bye bye
