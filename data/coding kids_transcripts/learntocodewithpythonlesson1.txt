00:02 - so you might just see a little button on
00:04 - the top saying your screen is being
00:08 - recorded or something like that and I'm
00:11 - just going to share my screen now so let
00:15 - me know and you can see my screen I can
00:20 - see it you can see cool
00:22 - I'll get you can see okay cool so um
00:25 - just everyone have Idol open or can you
00:29 - please open it again if you closed it
00:31 - yep yep so Cory you have it open you did
00:38 - this intro class with me a couple of
00:40 - weeks ago and so this lesson is similar
00:43 - to that of but like hopefully it'll be a
00:45 - good refresher for you and then like the
00:47 - next lessons we'll build upon that okay
00:51 - so I'll just quickly introduce what
00:53 - Python is to chest as well so basically
01:01 - with Python Python is what you call a
01:03 - programming language and then you can
01:06 - make pretty much like anything on the
01:07 - computer is done through programming
01:10 - languages so things like YouTube and
01:14 - like games and websites all of those
01:17 - even like a microwave has like a little
01:20 - computer in it and it has some code that
01:22 - makes it run so we'll be learning Python
01:25 - which is like typing like a programming
01:29 - language and I'll show you a couple of
01:31 - examples of things you can make with
01:33 - Python
01:42 - so you can do stuff that a tech space
01:45 - and you can also draw graphics so if you
01:51 - see my screen Cory do you remember this
01:55 - the Python code yep yeah so this on the
02:00 - left here gesture this is Python code
02:02 - like that's what it looks like
02:04 - don't worry about it too much we'll go
02:06 - through it after but this is like an
02:09 - example of what a Python program might
02:12 - do that's asking me down here how far
02:14 - will Bob walk and maybe I'll just say 20
02:18 - and it draws a line and then how many
02:20 - degrees did say 19 and it turns so this
02:25 - thing on the screen is called turtle
02:27 - it's a turtle but also turtle is like
02:30 - what Python uses to drill graphics so
02:34 - right now it's drawing things like lions
02:36 - and stuff like that later on you can
02:38 - make it do shapes and cool things I'll
02:42 - show you another dragon though so this
02:49 - is a text-based Python program hey you
02:53 - love that game yeah it's pretty fun show
02:58 - you what it does you have to pick a door
03:02 - so it's asking me to pick a door so what
03:05 - number should I choose that three okay
03:09 - three and then it says you found the
03:13 - treasure so if I run it again
03:17 - I can pick another door okay one oh I'm
03:21 - gonna type the one in the wrong place
03:23 - one and it's like oh no the dragon got
03:26 - you so depending on which door you go
03:29 - and it will give you a different result
03:31 - and by the way this thing what I'm
03:34 - showing you the programs on now is
03:36 - something called shrinked it so this is
03:39 - where you can write Python programs but
03:41 - it's online and then you can say which
03:43 - you account but because this is a longer
03:47 - course like we have a few lessons that's
03:50 - why I'm getting you guys to use Idol so
03:53 - it's just the same thing but Idol is
03:54 - actually on your
03:55 - you know it's just easier because you
03:58 - can save things and you don't need to
03:59 - worry about the internet like if you're
04:02 - not connected or anything like that you
04:04 - can always view your projects at any
04:06 - time so anyway I'll get started now so
04:11 - can everyone go back to your Python
04:14 - shell so can you guys see my screen and
04:17 - your Python shell at the same time yeah
04:20 - yep so you might need to make your zoom
04:24 - screen a bit small okay so I think our
04:49 - other student joined in and can you hear
04:54 - me David is it is it did you have it
05:10 - open or did you know if you closed it
05:13 - hello oh sorry David can you hear me yep
05:19 - okay um it might be on the bottom so
05:23 - Corey your Python shell it might look
05:26 - like a little piece of paper like do you
05:29 - see on the bottom how mine looks like
05:30 - this
05:31 - the thing that's moving so if you just
05:35 - click on it or double-click on it it
05:36 - might open again um so David can you
05:41 - hear me okay so my name is Imani we just
05:47 - soldered the Python class but I'll
05:50 - quickly show you what we're doing
05:52 - have you done any Python before yes I
05:56 - did
05:57 - okay you've done two lessons hey that's
06:01 - good so I'm just letting you know this
06:03 - is like the level one Python and like
06:05 - this is a first lesson so some of the
06:08 - stuff you might know that
06:09 - it will just be like a little refresher
06:11 - have you done any online classes before
06:16 - also they were online so do you know how
06:19 - to use zoom and everything and they won
06:28 - yes the first time my dad used it for me
06:32 - okay that's okay so I'll just quickly
06:37 - show you generally right now I think you
06:41 - can see my screen if you can see stuff
06:44 - on your screen so generally the lessons
06:47 - will be me sharing my screen and you
06:49 - guys following along on your computers
06:51 - but sometimes if you have any questions
06:54 - or issues I'll get you guys to share
06:56 - your screen so I can see what's
06:57 - happening and if on the top or bottom
07:02 - you might have a button called chat you
07:05 - see that yeah yeah so if you can like if
07:11 - there's any point where I can't hear you
07:13 - or you can't hear me or you just want to
07:15 - ask me a question you can message me in
07:18 - that chat instead so do you see that
07:22 - David do can you hear me
07:33 - yep okay cool and then if there's any
07:37 - point you need to share your screen I
07:39 - think the button is on the top it says
07:41 - share a new share it might be green
07:47 - button okay no so the share screen
07:56 - button just shows what's like on your
07:59 - computer screen so it doesn't show your
08:01 - face anything it just shows like what
08:04 - you're working on so right now do you
08:06 - see how you can see my screen yes yes so
08:10 - if you press the share button we can all
08:12 - see your screen so when I press the
08:16 - share button SURS you cannot start
08:18 - screen share while the others
08:21 - participants sharing
08:23 - I am so that's just because in this
08:26 - meeting only one person can share it at
08:28 - a time so usually it'll just be me
08:31 - sharing but then if one of you need to
08:33 - share your screens then I can stop mine
08:35 - and then you can show your screens okay
08:37 - yeah and then oh sorry oh you can't find
08:44 - it um okay so maybe you know how I was
08:48 - telling you before to search and type in
08:50 - idol ID le from all my applications
08:57 - maybe try do that again
09:00 - oh so David do you know if you have
09:03 - Python on your computer mmm no I don't
09:08 - have part of mark of doodle
09:10 - okay so that's the thing so if you open
09:12 - up the chat thing do you see how I sent
09:15 - a link up above at the very top um I'll
09:22 - send it again oh yeah yeah I should get
09:31 - it so if you just click on that okay
09:34 - I'll get you to download Python so you
09:38 - should just see a website like this and
09:40 - learn Python three points 7.3 yeah just
09:45 - just collection just one okay I'm just
09:57 - gonna stop sharing my screen for a
09:59 - second um kori do you want to open your
10:02 - screen again share your screens alright
10:05 - so I can try get Idol back up okay so if
10:18 - you just type in there if you try to
10:20 - open idol so ID le again so you did down
10:26 - the lit right hmm okay maybe if you go
10:34 - into your downloads
10:36 - and try find yep just there up the sub
10:47 - you see I think it says quite thing if
10:51 - you try double click on yeah and just
10:56 - continue and maybe just install it again
11:02 - and what do you next installed Python
11:06 - install now and yeah and saying Asura's
11:12 - do want to allow this up to my change
11:16 - yep
11:17 - yeah okay it's installing cool and then
11:22 - maybe Sakura maybe once its installed
11:25 - just save it on your desktop or
11:28 - something or make a show cut okay CDC
11:33 - Idol on the top there actually I might
11:37 - get all of you to do it once its
11:38 - installed
11:39 - so Chester maybe do this too so when you
11:43 - open Idol you got to open okay cool
11:50 - I'll just share my screen again just to
11:52 - show you guys something so once you open
12:00 - up Idol you right-click on it
12:05 - okay maybe you cut right um I said you
12:09 - see I just got it on my desktop
12:14 - oh you have it on your taskbar okay
12:16 - that's good um Corey do you want to do
12:19 - that too
12:19 - I did it before you did it before okay
12:23 - cool
12:24 - that's good it just makes it easier to
12:26 - find it I thought so too
12:31 - when you search Idol if you just
12:35 - right-click on it you can just press pin
12:39 - to start or pin to taskbar so they'll
12:43 - just make a shortcut so that you can
12:45 - always open it like it's easy to find
12:48 - next time
12:49 - [Music]
12:51 - so if you go back into idle so you know
12:56 - how you had like what you double clicked
12:58 - on to open it whistle in your files do
13:16 - you want to share your screen again
13:17 - quickly
13:18 - oh so David do you have it installed now
13:25 - okay um so right now core is sharing his
13:29 - screen and if you just click on that
13:31 - thing in the background that says idle
13:34 - this one yep and just click on that just
13:38 - to go into that screen and then on that
13:41 - top up there um oh sorry not that up
13:46 - where it says the words idle and capital
13:48 - letters you know the thing that's
13:50 - highlighted yet if you just right-click
13:52 - that yeah oh it hang on I'm just unclick
13:59 - it and then right-click it again because
14:01 - you accidentally click on the words I
14:03 - think okay yeah um what you can do is
14:14 - maybe oh maybe absolutely just drag that
14:17 - and then put it on your desktop screen
14:19 - okay try that yep just to make it like a
14:21 - shortcut so that you can find it later
14:23 - oh yeah okay so next time yeah so now
14:28 - that it's there so whenever you need to
14:30 - open it you can just double click on
14:32 - that yeah so David is yours nearly
14:36 - finished until it's finished but it says
14:41 - setup was successful and I don't know
14:43 - what your parishioners okay so now I
14:45 - might get you to share your screen so do
14:49 - you mind just pressing that share button
14:52 - so it's my yeah and then it might give
14:57 - you a message just pressure screen or
14:59 - something and then it will stop Corie
15:01 - screen from cheering
15:07 - yes so sometimes like even with
15:09 - programming like setting up takes a
15:11 - while and then once you've set up the
15:13 - first time then everything is really
15:15 - easy after that so because this is the
15:19 - first lesson might just take a while to
15:22 - get everything set up but we're nearly
15:25 - there
15:26 - um so David did you see the share button
15:29 - the share screen button on Zoo
15:39 - can you hear me David all right yes yep
15:43 - so did you see that button that says
15:45 - share yeah so I did it okay
15:50 - do you mind clicking on it please just
15:51 - so yeah I can't but it says you can also
15:55 - screen share while the participants are
15:58 - sharing and does it say anything after
16:00 - that like share anyway your stop oh no
16:04 - it doesn't okay
16:06 - maybe sorry Cory can you please stop
16:10 - sharing the screen and then so I think
16:14 - on the bottom or like near where it says
16:19 - share there should be an option to say
16:22 - in zoom yeah yeah cool okay now David
16:26 - you should be able to say okay um do you
16:39 - have the place where your Python
16:42 - installed so like on your desktop in
16:45 - your downloads or something yes do you
16:48 - mind so python idol or person 3.7 model
16:55 - Doc's Python Idol okay yep so you might
17:01 - need to reshare your screen and press
17:03 - shared desktop because I think what
17:06 - you're sharing now is just this command
17:10 - line Bowl okay second Oh
17:15 - they see like black little box yeah
17:26 - leticia okay so what are you so I think
17:30 - it says desktop or something Oh like my
17:34 - eggs ish yeah
17:37 - wait yes so that's Python shell but
17:41 - sorry I'll just if you go back and I'm
17:44 - going to stop your share screen for a
17:46 - second yeah okay so the thing that you
17:51 - need to click on when you're sharing
17:52 - screen is just screen so then I can see
17:55 - your whole screen oh yeah okay right
17:59 - okay yeah but there's no yeah do you see
18:10 - something called screen or desktop one
18:12 - or something like that
18:16 - no what what options do you see I see oh
18:21 - yeah wait
18:22 - oh yeah do you see everything yeah okay
18:25 - now I see everything okay so if you go a
18:29 - heavy saved idle to the bottom tier task
18:32 - already out of I think you have it on
18:36 - the bird no there's no idle like the
18:42 - Python thing sorry yeah I'm gonna do
18:44 - okay
18:45 - there's two of those now j-just okay yep
18:49 - cool one said don't need right yes so
18:53 - maybe just close everything for the
18:55 - minute and then open it again so I'll
18:57 - just show you how to find idle so if you
19:01 - just close oh sorry not the share screen
19:03 - oh okay okay it's okay and you don't
19:07 - need to show screen so if you just close
19:09 - that Python show you head yeah sure so
19:13 - on - a device or a crush yeah so I'll
19:18 - just show you so that you know how to
19:19 - open it up
19:22 - yeah I think already know yup
19:25 - I don't click it like okay good okay
19:29 - Neri okay idle
19:34 - mm-hmm and okay so I think everyone has
19:37 - idle open now
19:38 - I'll share my screen and then we'll get
19:41 - started yep yep okay so does everyone
19:45 - have can everyone see my screen and your
19:48 - screen yes yeah yep yep okay cool yeah
19:54 - so yeah sorry that setup it took a while
19:58 - so I'll just try to go through this is
20:00 - like the first class so I'll just we
20:03 - won't make a program yet I'll first
20:05 - teach you like an introduction to Python
20:07 - and then we'll see how our time goes
20:10 - yeah yeah so this what you see right now
20:14 - when you've opened up idle is called the
20:17 - Python shell so those three little
20:19 - greater than signs like that little
20:22 - arrows that's where you type so you can
20:25 - type anything but it like you might get
20:29 - an error like this that's just because
20:31 - it's expecting Python code yes one thing
20:35 - that programming languages can do is it
20:37 - can do basic math equations so like 10
20:41 - plus 10 so if you just tried you a math
20:45 - equation and press Enter it gives you
20:48 - the answer
20:50 - Amani how do we make your screen a bit
20:52 - bigger my screen so if you go and you
20:55 - click into zoom yeah so I'll let you
21:02 - guys play around for like a minute tried
21:06 - through different math equations so you
21:07 - can do - as well - like 100 minus 20 or
21:13 - something
21:13 - I made it say hello you made it say
21:18 - hello okay you already know that I like
21:21 - with the numbers or with actual letters
21:24 - that is oh that's the next step good job
21:29 - so does this make sense to everyone so
21:33 - far just tell you can do maths with
21:35 - programming languages yes
21:40 - so by the way guys if you have any
21:42 - questions like throughout the lesson
21:43 - just let me know David does this make
21:50 - sense to you as oh yeah yeah so yeah
21:55 - this is just one thing programming
21:57 - languages can do so I can do like really
22:00 - big masked equations as well like okay
22:03 - if you just type in random numbers and
22:05 - things like that it will give you the
22:07 - answer and so right now we've just been
22:12 - doing money how do we put the your
22:15 - screen in our our screen side by side
22:18 - okay so my screen is going to be a bit
22:22 - smaller and then your screen has to be
22:26 - your Python shell has to be like you can
22:29 - make it smaller by dragging it to images
22:33 - as well can you make yourself bigger so
22:36 - make my one yeah yeah I get it
22:39 - I don't screen a bit bigger all right
22:42 - yeah sure
22:42 - you can also are you like this so you
22:49 - can also make it bigger on your screen
22:51 - by when you go into zoom like making
22:54 - that screen a bit bigger because it
22:57 - might be cut off by your screen if that
23:02 - makes sense so did you manage to resize
23:08 - it
23:14 - no but her screen is so small
23:17 - okay what I might do all says I'll just
23:20 - share my idle screen so that you don't
23:23 - see that other stuff just so that you
23:25 - can see more of the screen that might
23:27 - help as well so now you can only see my
23:32 - Python yeah yeah okay yeah cool umm can
23:37 - everyone else still see their screens on
23:39 - my screen yeah yep okay cool yeah yep so
23:46 - yeah um Python can do like plus and
23:49 - minus and it can also do like division
23:52 - and multiplication
23:53 - but does anyone know what those signs
23:56 - are on the keyboard yes yeah what Adam
24:01 - vision is the slash yep exactly
24:05 - so if you want to do division you can do
24:07 - something like 100 divided by 5 so it's
24:11 - just this glass here
24:13 - if you press ENTER you get the answer
24:15 - and tithe is the store yep exactly
24:20 - time to stuff stuff so like you can type
24:22 - in a random number time 100 or something
24:26 - and it gives you the answer - does that
24:30 - make sense to everyone so far yep yep
24:34 - yep yep David how about you yes yes
24:42 - think I get it you think you get it so
24:44 - have you been trying it on your shell as
24:47 - we've been going along yes yeah yeah ok
24:56 - cool
24:57 - yes like as I'm explaining it you guys
24:59 - can type it on your own computers as
25:01 - well and then you can play around with
25:03 - it to see what it does as well so yeah
25:06 - I'm already doing yep are you doing that
25:08 - yeah so that's just like the maths bit
25:10 - of it but you can also do something
25:14 - called so this is all with numbers and
25:16 - there's also something called variables
25:18 - you can tell me what a variable is yep
25:22 - oh yes that's cool yeah school is an
25:26 - example of a variable so a variable is
25:29 - kind of like a little box that remember
25:31 - something so like Corey will sing a
25:34 - school is a variable because like in
25:37 - games it keeps track of your school so
25:40 - keep track of it in a variable so I'll
25:44 - show you an example so you guys can type
25:46 - it on yours as well so for example if we
25:49 - wanted to make a variable in Python we
25:51 - can make if we wanted to make a school
25:53 - for example we can type in school is
25:56 - equal to so when we're setting a
26:00 - variable to something we use that equal
26:02 - sign so we want to say like score is
26:04 - equal to and maybe one we want
26:07 - start them off at 10 or something any
26:10 - press enter and once you've done that
26:16 - when you press ENTER it looks like
26:18 - nothing's happened so it just takes you
26:19 - to another line yeah and night and now
26:22 - you do school and it says to do 10 yep
26:26 - exactly so uh if you type in school it
26:29 - tells you what value that variable has
26:31 - yeah yep okay so now another thing you
26:35 - can do is if this was like an actual
26:38 - game you'd have your school but then
26:41 - every time you collect like coins or
26:43 - something you might add some points to
26:45 - that school so if you wanted to add
26:48 - points to our variable here which is the
26:51 - school does anyone want to tell me what
26:53 - I might need to type in
26:55 - does anyone know today pardon - do we
27:03 - want to add something on to our school
27:05 - it's like if we want to go school plus
27:07 - like school plus yep so what we want to
27:12 - do is say yes so because like our school
27:16 - our school is ten we can go then you
27:20 - plus whatever number you want to get so
27:26 - we can go score plus five for example
27:29 - and what number would that give us
27:31 - before pressing enter does anyone know
27:33 - what it would give us yeah yep what is
27:38 - it called eNOS fifteen yes it's fifteen
27:42 - so the reason why it's doing that is
27:44 - because we already made something called
27:46 - scope and we made our variable called
27:49 - school and that has a value of ten and
27:52 - it's telling us the school is ten so in
27:56 - our next line score plus five is just
27:59 - the same as typing ten plus five mean do
28:03 - that make sense to everyone
28:06 - yeah yeah Chester
28:10 - David does that make sense to you guys -
28:11 - yeah yep cool so another thing you can
28:17 - do is now if you type in school and
28:20 - press Enter
28:21 - it's telling us it's ten does anyone
28:24 - know what that is
28:25 - oh yeah because as the first time a
28:31 - major school it goes ten mm-hmm
28:34 - so I never is grating up up to it
28:38 - it still still give us the first one yes
28:43 - exactly so the reason one is school plus
28:45 - five again yes but we also need one more
28:49 - sign so we need that equal sign because
28:52 - we if we ever want to like change that
28:55 - value like change the value of school we
28:58 - need that equal sign otherwise it's just
29:00 - gonna do like some basic math well if
29:04 - you type in school is equal to the
29:08 - school plus five that will add on how do
29:13 - you think maybe the name thing after you
29:20 - wanna do the name thing just remember
29:22 - what I was telling you about strings as
29:24 - well what do you need for swing yeah so
29:28 - try that for everyone else so if you
29:31 - want the scores value to actually change
29:33 - you need that equal sign so what I did
29:36 - now is score is equal to score plus five
29:39 - and if I type in school and press Enter
29:43 - now it's 15 to try that and see if it
29:48 - works
29:52 - cool yeah so it's always good to just
29:56 - play around with it and experiment
29:58 - yourself as well and does it make sense
30:01 - to everyone yep okay cool
30:05 - and then another way of doing this
30:07 - because typing score is equal to school
30:10 - plus five is a lot to type so a
30:14 - shortened way of doing it is just to go
30:16 - to school is plus or equals five and if
30:22 - you press ENTER it's the same thing as
30:24 - doing school is equal to scale plus five
30:26 - that's just a shortened form now if I
30:30 - type in school and press Enter it's now
30:34 - 20
30:34 - I just that make sense to just try that
30:44 - and see so like in a game like you know
30:50 - in Mario every time you get the coins
30:52 - like you might get ten more points like
30:56 - in the background this is what the code
30:58 - is doing so it has your school and every
31:00 - time you collect a coin it might just go
31:02 - to score is plus a equals ten does that
31:08 - make sense to everyone
31:09 - yeah yep okay on to the next thing so so
31:15 - far all what we've been doing is all
31:18 - with numbers and variables we can also
31:21 - do things with something called strings
31:23 - in Python so Cory do you remember what a
31:26 - string is sort of yeah yeah Soto um does
31:31 - anyone want to tell me what this it's
31:39 - okay otherwise if you can't remember it
31:41 - I can explain it again so a string in
31:44 - programming languages is basically it's
31:46 - just the word so like we know how these
31:49 - are numbers it's just like another type
31:51 - of data but instead it's a word so for
31:55 - example in a game you might ask you for
31:57 - your name it'll save that as a string
32:01 - because those are like Leben's and words
32:03 - it's saved as a string so what we can do
32:07 - is before we were saving variables as
32:10 - numbers so like the school you can also
32:13 - save variables as strings so for example
32:18 - you could say name is equal to and then
32:23 - you can type in a name and by the way so
32:26 - with programming languages and strings
32:29 - you can't just type in the string like
32:32 - the word like that you have to put it in
32:35 - quotation marks okay so that's that the
32:41 - computer knows that it's a string so
32:44 - that it knows it's just
32:46 - it is it's not anything else you try
32:49 - that like name is equal to something and
32:53 - then try a name and press Enter
32:56 - already did already did cool and then
33:01 - you can try that with like different
33:03 - things as well like fruit is equal to
33:06 - Apple and you can't press ENTER you can
33:11 - see what fruit is and then you can
33:14 - change it again so it's like oh actually
33:16 - I want my fruit to be a pear and now if
33:22 - I press ENTER my fruit has changed to a
33:25 - player does that make sense of huh yes
33:30 - yep so if I did this if I went fruit is
33:34 - equal to 3 what would fruit be now can I
33:39 - know and tell me so what would this
33:42 - variable fruit be if I pressed fruit and
33:44 - then pressed enter it would type in 3 it
33:47 - would type into yep so basically even
33:50 - though our variable started off as a
33:52 - string it can be like a number later on
33:55 - if we wanted it to be so another thing
34:00 - you can do is I'll quickly show you so
34:03 - if you try to go fruit is equal to
34:07 - grapes maybe so do you see how it's not
34:10 - green on my screen right now because I
34:12 - haven't put any quotation marks yeah I
34:15 - did it'll do the arrow yeah it does an
34:18 - error so it generally it gives you an
34:20 - error if you haven't done something
34:22 - correctly and the error tells you what
34:25 - like what the issue is so for example
34:28 - this is saying the name grapes is not
34:31 - defined because it thinks grapes is
34:34 - meant to be a variable or something
34:36 - because we didn't put it in quotation
34:38 - marks so it doesn't know that it's meant
34:41 - to be just the word graders so because
34:45 - if I made a variable called grapes and
34:50 - like said hello this is a variable of
34:55 - something
34:57 - now if I go fruit is equal to grapes
35:01 - because I use this equal sign to like
35:04 - define grapes or something now I won't
35:08 - get that error does that make sense of
35:12 - yeah so if I what would the value of
35:16 - fruit be now can anyone tell me
35:20 - great oh no it would still what would it
35:24 - say three would it yep exactly
35:35 - so it's a bit confusing but if I press
35:37 - enter korie's right it says hello this
35:40 - is a very quotation marks yeah exactly
35:43 - so what does that make sense everyone
35:46 - else so check then David does that make
35:48 - sense
35:49 - so is it a bit confusing quotation mots
35:54 - yep exactly so if I want like this
35:57 - variable fruit to actually be the word
36:00 - grape I need to put in the quotation
36:02 - marks
36:03 - otherwise it's thinking it's the value
36:06 - of grapes because I already made that
36:08 - before so that's why it says hello this
36:11 - is a variable does that make sense
36:14 - everyone else as well yeah yep so I'll
36:18 - give you like did you try it on your own
36:21 - computer so do you have a playroom dude
36:24 - oh cool I'll give you guys a couple of
36:27 - minutes to just try different variables
36:31 - and like see what the result is so you
36:35 - can say like lunch is equal to so you
36:54 - can just play around with different
36:55 - scenarios and see what happens
36:58 - then just remember if you ever want to
37:00 - change that value of the variable or
37:02 - assign value you need to use that equal
37:05 - sign
37:15 - so let me know if that makes sense yeah
37:19 - any fun
37:20 - yep cool so another thing you can do is
37:24 - you know how before we did something
37:27 - like score is equal to score classified
37:29 - or something like we use Plus with the
37:32 - variables because it was just numbers
37:33 - and it's doing that another thing you
37:36 - can do is you can use plus with strings
37:39 - so you can do something like name is
37:42 - equal to Bob and then last name even
37:49 - equal to Bobby or something yeah we do
37:55 - that too
37:55 - I did a computer company a composition
37:59 - and I typed in a hollow it was a lot of
38:03 - David mm-hmm present how are you it was
38:07 - good thanks and you
38:09 - and a good equals okay cool so it's like
38:15 - I say hello as a computer says hello
38:19 - David
38:20 - how are you good good good and she says
38:27 - okay that's pretty cool yeah so what you
38:31 - can do like with the variables here like
38:34 - you can also add them together so you
38:36 - can go name must last name and then like
38:42 - because people be yeah and just mush
38:45 - them together so like you can make full
38:49 - sentences like welcome and just remember
38:53 - with variable names you can't have
38:55 - spaces into them so you can't say like I
38:58 - hide last name altogether in one word
39:01 - you can't go lost space name equals
39:06 - something it'll give you an error
39:09 - sometimes you can sometimes you can yes
39:12 - in Python and you can't do it for
39:15 - variable names just because like usually
39:19 - computers don't like spaces
39:22 - so this is saying syntax error invalid
39:25 - syntax so just saying there's something
39:27 - wrong with like the structure of that
39:30 - code you did races are deadly to
39:33 - complete it yes yeah so like what you
39:36 - can do is like what I did by mushing
39:38 - them like last name together but
39:40 - sometimes that might be bit confusing to
39:42 - read so you can go like lost and then a
39:45 - capital in a m e that's generally a
39:49 - better way to do it and then you can say
39:52 - like class name equals something so what
39:57 - you can do like with these different
39:59 - variables is like maybe you can say
40:01 - message equals like hello something and
40:07 - then if you wanted to print out a
40:10 - message to someone you can say ask
40:12 - message plus name and then it says hello
40:16 - Bob but do you see how it's all just
40:22 - squished together so if you wanted it to
40:24 - have a space you could go like message
40:28 - plus and then you can type in a space in
40:32 - the quotation marks plus name and now it
40:37 - gives you the space so just try that on
40:43 - your computer too already did already
40:48 - did cool how about you Chester did you
40:52 - try that no no okay so just tried that
40:56 - too like by adding two different
40:58 - variables together strings so like what
41:03 - I did here with message plus name and
41:05 - then it just like smooshes them together
41:08 - but then if you want to space in between
41:10 - that you can actually go like message
41:14 - plus and then in your quotation marks
41:17 - type a space and then go plus how's
41:25 - yours going kori
41:26 - do you play around with that as well
41:27 - yeah yep cool yeah so just remember just
41:35 - whatever you want actually
41:37 - in programming languages it needs to be
41:40 - a strength that needs to be in the
41:42 - quotation marks so like you can also
41:49 - because what you can do is in my last
41:53 - line I did message plus the space plus
41:56 - the name another thing you can do is you
41:59 - can have the space in the variable but
42:02 - generally you might not want that
42:04 - opposed like usually people's names
42:07 - don't have a space in it or something
42:08 - like that
42:09 - so that's why you can just type the
42:12 - space without having that as a variable
42:14 - so you can also say like yeah I'll let
42:20 - you guys play around with that
42:24 - Chester does that make sense to you did
42:27 - you try it yeah yes okay cool so another
42:31 - thing you can do is because what we've
42:32 - been doing every time we press ENTER
42:34 - after typing a variable it just like
42:37 - shows us the next time what that value
42:39 - is but in Python if you want to actually
42:43 - write something on the screen you can go
42:46 - print you can type the word print and
42:49 - you see how it became orange yeah that's
42:54 - like a Python command kind of thing so
42:56 - in there like after print do a circle
43:00 - bracket and then you can write a message
43:02 - inside and remember it's still a string
43:05 - because you want to print words so it's
43:07 - still have for me a string they can say
43:09 - like hello this is some message and
43:13 - remember to close your quotation mark as
43:17 - well and the brackets so it also doesn't
43:20 - matter if you do you know how before I
43:22 - was using that double quotation mark
43:25 - it doesn't matter if you do that single
43:27 - line as long as they're both matching so
43:31 - now if I press ENTER it says hello this
43:35 - is some message to try that on your
43:40 - screens so that's kind of like you know
43:43 - how else join you that text adventure
43:47 - before David wasn't here but it was like
43:49 - after the
43:50 - getting of the game it's said a message
43:51 - like pick a duel one two three that's
43:54 - how you would do something in a game
43:56 - like that like you would just say print
43:58 - and then do the message so you can also
44:04 - like fuse variables inside that they can
44:07 - go print and then I can be like welcome
44:11 - to Python and then that's the phrase I
44:16 - want to say so that's in the quotation
44:18 - marks but I want to also say like
44:20 - welcome to Python and then the actual
44:23 - person's name so then I'll use that
44:25 - variable name and then don't forget
44:29 - every time you have that opening bracket
44:32 - you need to close it on the other end so
44:35 - now if you press ENTER you might say
44:38 - welcome to Python Bob but then it might
44:41 - be squished together again so what do
44:44 - you need to do to fix that you can tell
44:47 - me does anyone know yes yes what do I
44:56 - need to do do do the speech commerce
45:01 - space in the middle yeah so welcome to
45:05 - Python because I'm already writing a
45:08 - message here I can just do the space
45:10 - here so do you see how like my last one
45:14 - time the speech mark is just directly
45:18 - after the end this time actually type in
45:21 - the space and then did it so now if I
45:25 - press ENTER it says welcome to pipe in
45:27 - love with the space yeah so just play
45:34 - around with that a bit does anyone have
45:36 - any questions at the moment okay if
45:42 - that's a day so I think the lesson is
45:46 - actually over now so yeah so it took a
45:50 - bit of time to setup and stuff yeah but
45:52 - next week because everyone will have
45:54 - idle on their computers we can just
45:56 - start straightaway yeah yep generally
45:59 - anyway the first lesson it just takes a
46:02 - little time to set
46:03 - and get used to things but did anyone
46:06 - have any questions with anything we did
46:08 - today
46:09 - no any general questions so did it all
46:15 - make sense to everyone the variables and
46:17 - the string from the numbers and stuff it
46:24 - all made sense okay cool so from next
46:27 - week we'll be starting to learn like
46:28 - some new concepts and hopefully we'll
46:31 - have time to like make a pro like this
46:33 - mini program but so now we'll leave it
46:37 - as that goes at the end of the lesson
46:39 - one more thing so what we were doing
46:43 - here was all in the Python shell so it
46:46 - wasn't actually like a Python program it
46:48 - was just different lines of Python so
46:51 - this is not like something we can run
46:53 - later on like save it and run because do
46:56 - you see how it was just doing it after
46:57 - every line so what you do like this one
47:03 - gets saved because this is just like
47:04 - playing around but from next week I'll
47:06 - show you how to actually like open a
47:08 - program and we can save himself but for
47:12 - now you can just close this and then
47:14 - just let it be yeah so no one else had
47:18 - any questions I'll leave the lesson at
47:22 - that because it's 5:30 now so don't
47:26 - forget to just have idle like on your
47:28 - computer and then next lesson we can
47:30 - just open it straight away because I
47:33 - can't already download go so I hope you
47:36 - guys like the class he'll find it fun
47:39 - yeah sorry when we've got a bit of
47:41 - coding done but hope you learnt a bit at
47:45 - least okay but yeah I'm just gonna stop
47:48 - sharing my screen and I'll see you guys
47:51 - next week see ya bye
