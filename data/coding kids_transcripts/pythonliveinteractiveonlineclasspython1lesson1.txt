00:02 - okay could you tell me about that what
00:09 - kind of things apart from games that you
00:15 - see on the web it's it's quite with
00:20 - programming needs let's make it
00:23 - languages to some programming robots
00:29 - here we can program robots robots
00:32 - wheelers programming it just metals what
00:35 - computers computers without any
00:37 - programming it just metals and do things
00:40 - they are smart or not do you think
00:43 - computers are smart depending on what
00:48 - type of computer it is and how um how
00:50 - much technology is built into it that's
00:55 - me
00:56 - somebody needs to coat them somebody
00:59 - needs to tell them how to performance
01:04 - the things that they need so we need to
01:06 - tell the computers how what we need to
01:11 - do and what kind of things we ask for
01:16 - them to do for us otherwise so the
01:23 - YouTube actually Microsoft where these

15:17 - [Music]
15:30 - you forgot small things you forgot to
15:36 - take that we need everything that we're
15:40 - gonna print it out it should be inside
15:44 - or in a bracket in um quotation double
15:49 - quotation or quotation so you should put
15:54 - hello as the pan in a quotation sign
15:57 - yeah true now it's like you can put
16:06 - there put the result up like just dragon
16:10 - yeah could you see this small oh yeah
16:15 - cool yeah it's done then we are going
16:22 - suck could I share my screen the next
16:38 - step is to say something else like we
16:46 - can say eight plus eight we can print
17:00 - eight plus eight is it true they're
17:10 - resolved yes we can so we can do math
17:17 - Poynter we can just calculate whatever
17:23 - we ain't here without opening the
17:25 - calculator so easy
17:27 - what's cool what do you like to
17:30 - calculate down what's tell me a big
17:33 - number three quadrillion times on
17:41 - fifteen or million okay write it down
17:48 - and see the result
17:53 - I need you on exit so I can do it so I
18:01 - knew you don't need to share with me
18:03 - okay just add okay just three thousand
18:08 - times on five thousand yeah that's fine
18:18 - but just you can do it whatever you
18:21 - think you say you can just write it down
18:24 - just you need to put the print and then
18:28 - bracket open bracket and then three
18:32 - thousand multiple by whatever five
18:37 - thousand let's see fifteen thousand and
18:42 - I know
18:43 - fifteen oh yeah we can do it more
18:52 - complicated numbers like that for - -
19:06 - man this one is should be yeah it should
19:10 - be bigger so we can say that's funny
19:23 - okay next why do you like to know more
19:28 - so
19:30 - next one we're going to if we kind of
19:34 - just use lots of numbers and you know if
19:40 - we need to know this result to put it
19:44 - somewhere so just think about we're
19:47 - gonna use 707 7707 or just say say the
19:57 - small number let's just do small number
20:00 - 16 minus 5 it's 8 so we gotta use this
20:06 - state we're gonna say the result of this
20:10 - calculation is going to be say 8 what's
20:15 - 8 plus 8 or 9 what is point 9 so we're
20:23 - gonna use the result of this calculation
20:25 - here how we can keep it you think we
20:29 - need to store it so how we store this I
20:40 - will store this result of the first
20:44 - calculation we gotta use variable we say
20:48 - variable that's variable something like
20:51 - if box we have a box
20:53 - let me show do you have my myface video
20:58 - or yes okay cool so we have a box that
21:04 - we're gonna put just think about you're
21:07 - gonna put your toys in your box to a
21:10 - store it and put it in just the corner
21:15 - of your room to just for later let's say
21:21 - do you just want to put just your Legos
21:25 - okay how how we can do it and then we
21:29 - can store it for one day and then use it
21:33 - tomorrow so how we can do it in here
21:38 - with numbers it's this
21:40 - that we use the box that we're gonna say
21:43 - what's the box is say let's put a name
21:50 - on the box your name is okay we can say
21:55 - it steppin steppin box it's equal to 13
22:10 - minus 5
22:13 - so what's could be step on box inside
22:22 - well entre 39 5 is 8
22:25 - yeah yeah so 8 we put the age number
22:29 - this number in the box not here
22:32 - easy and then if we print it out here
22:38 - what we're gonna see is we can see we
22:41 - can say it's the box we have to we have
22:46 - to see it yeah we can see 8 number so
22:51 - what we did here we just store these
22:56 - numbers the calculator of these numbers
22:59 - in the box that we cover this different
23:02 - box and so then we can use it how we can
23:09 - use we can say box it should be the same
23:16 - name that we use you know this this
23:20 - language it's is actually very sensitive
23:26 - that means if I use if I say for example
23:31 - print
23:34 - box like this what do you think it's
23:38 - show me nothing you know what because
23:45 - there is some difference here could you
23:49 - tell me what's different capital yeah
23:52 - exactly so whatever we said if we said
23:56 - SVS capital would be upper case the same
24:01 - we have to use when we were gonna use
24:04 - the box it shouldn't be different the
24:07 - same thing would you learn to write down
24:26 - what's a really large store some numbers
24:30 - that you like in the name you rock
25:16 - now you know what
25:44 - hey I got it bad so what's next mr.
26:26 - Chang half your time
27:00 - maybe you remember how how we form a new
27:08 - variable we say we say a name equal yeah
27:13 - yeah yeah that's correct equal we don't
27:16 - need the parentheses we don't need
27:20 - yeah we just need it for print
27:27 - you
27:29 - no because because we just put it in the
27:35 - box we didn't tell Python to prepare for
27:38 - us it's the stupid we should tell them
27:41 - otherwise it doesn't understand words
27:44 - what do you say oh yeah
28:07 - just this good excellent so we have your
28:19 - that's a very well we have so we gotta
28:22 - use that's your right but what do you
28:24 - want to use it you can't calculate you
28:29 - can use it you can't you know add a
28:31 - number okay good yeah just just play
28:41 - with it that's fine just try whatever
28:44 - you like
29:08 - we could even tell how it's a big number
29:18 - cool we have a counselor cool
30:16 - yay very interesting hey infinite number
30:27 - uh let's do something with our variable
30:32 - let's use it we can you can add more
30:37 - number in your variable that you put to
30:40 - the names and dinosaur box you can add
30:42 - more number blocks
30:45 - like for example put some more number on
30:49 - the box how you can't do it you think
30:52 - could you give me I will show you back
31:08 - to my box I want to put some number I'm
31:20 - gonna say barks let's keep this one box

38:47 - see I think your Dalek on the chat box
38:59 - the chat box
39:01 - have you seen here you know what's the
39:24 - problem is it find it if you go into the
39:42 - bottom of the earth zone scream you will
39:46 - say chat icon hey I found it okay
39:54 - so what I typed actually it's different
40:00 - things that you have done so I say
40:03 - dinosaur box equal to the dinosaur box
40:08 - that we have it before multiple the
40:12 - number that you put so that's the
40:14 - difference yeah how's work
40:26 - so do I have to put up a different name
40:34 - over here
40:35 - well it's not different and then
40:38 - dinosaur box times this amount because
40:42 - danger yeah yeah what's not a different
40:47 - names it's the same name
40:50 - okay III write it down different name
40:53 - sorry yeah it's my typo
40:57 - so you say diner the same that you put
41:01 - no that's it means the same it's all the
41:05 - same so guys your box yeah Dino stop
41:11 - rocks that he use equals equals yeah
41:24 - Dino soapbox
41:26 - okay times times
41:36 - yeah could you write it down I can see
41:39 - you're asking because just for the trans
41:44 - mm so dancer box equals dinosaur box
41:49 - times to me maybe to something yeah it's
41:55 - okay
41:56 - doesn't matter two million so it's 2
42:05 - milli 2200 minute oh yeah
42:10 - go to the next line
42:15 - okay yes and writes down dinosaur parks
42:31 - equals yes okay well I couldn't see your
42:50 - screen I couldn't see anything here oh
42:54 - it's have you type it no I cut guys your
43:04 - box equals because I couldn't see
43:08 - anything you type I okay cookie you give
43:15 - me permission to can share my screen if
43:20 - you just close your eyes can share I
43:23 - can't share much or maybe I can let's
43:47 - say so what we gonna do you see now I
43:52 - use a small number in a step and box so
44:00 - I say it ii barks equal simple parts and
44:09 - multiple mm I can use another certainty
44:15 - another way it's like that is the pun
44:18 - but it's clicked me write it down here
44:22 - it's better slip on the box
44:27 - I can say just multiple loss okay could
44:51 - you see - great yeah so what I've done
44:59 - you'd say that's these two is the same
45:03 - we can do if you again use the different
45:32 - way of variable you see are you I said
45:38 - it's the pin box it's multiple equal
45:42 - thousand so this two lines is doing the
45:47 - same weight I think this one is more
45:51 - easy for you you like the other one
45:54 - yeah yeah you can do it the same and you
45:59 - can see the result it's gonna be the
46:01 - same
46:04 - I'm gonna print it out say seven works
46:12 - it's more number because I add more
46:16 - thousand to the box so would you like to
46:23 - do it in the same we knew today with
46:32 - your dragon box
46:52 - you can share yours you can see the
47:41 - bottom you say syntax error bad input on
47:46 - line seven line seven is not correct
47:50 - because you put something more than
47:53 - usual you put equal sign at the end that
47:57 - we don't need it yeah yeah now it's
48:02 - going to pull and now we have another
48:07 - one we have another error in line eight
48:13 - do you know you should put them
48:18 - go first and then plus and then equal so
48:25 - say oh good just put multiple sign
48:30 - before equal sign okay here exactly
48:44 - now ronette see this might be okay so no
48:49 - I wrote no a role but we couldn't see
48:53 - anything here because we didn't tell -
48:57 - please print it for us we didn't tell
49:00 - them we didn't ask
49:01 - Titan to print it for us so what we're
49:05 - gonna do it yeah now next time we're
49:08 - gonna next line you shouldn't put we
