00:05 - welcome to coding kids today I'm going
00:08 - to show you how to build cat and fish a
00:11 - basic scratch game first let's look at
00:14 - how we play it the player controls the
00:17 - cat by pressing the left right up and
00:19 - down arrow keys to make the cat move
00:22 - around the screen the aim of the game is
00:24 - to touch the fish to make it say hello
00:26 - this is the end of the game and who you
00:29 - touch the fish the game will continue
00:31 - now let's build the game there are four
00:34 - steps to the game 1 the backdrop to the
00:38 - cat 3 the fish and for the end where the
00:42 - fish saves hello let's build the game
00:45 - step by step first let's start with a
00:48 - brand new project by clicking on the
00:50 - create button on the home page as you
00:52 - can see a new project starts for the cat
00:55 - as the default sprite a sprite is the
00:58 - character or object that we use in our
01:00 - computer program for step 1 let's add
01:03 - the backdrop by clicking on the backdrop
01:05 - icon at the bottom left of the screen
01:07 - this opens the backdrop library scroll
01:11 - through the backdrop library until you
01:13 - find a backdrop spurts you like you may
01:16 - choose to use a different backdrop to me
01:18 - double-click on the backdrop you have
01:20 - selected or click on the backdrop then
01:22 - click the ok button to use it in your
01:25 - game 4 sep two let's program the cat to
01:29 - close our cats right first we need to
01:31 - select the cat sprite and then open the
01:34 - scripts tab at the top center to
01:36 - activate the cat when we press the arrow
01:39 - keys we will need for event blocks in
01:42 - the event plot category we can find a
01:45 - block that phase when space key pressed
01:47 - let's drag four of these blocks into the
01:50 - workspace
02:00 - now click on the drop down arrow to
02:02 - change the key from space to left right
02:05 - up and down arrow for each of these
02:08 - event logs
02:24 - now we need to add motion blocks to
02:26 - these events we know that to move up and
02:29 - down we use the y axis and to move left
02:32 - and right we use the x axis to make the
02:35 - cat's move up with the up arrow we need
02:38 - to choose a block that phase change y by
02:41 - 10 in the motion category we can
02:44 - increase the number 215 to make the
02:46 - cat's bright move quicker now we can
02:49 - connect it to the blocks that phase when
02:51 - up arrow key press to activate it to
02:55 - make the cat moves down we need to do
02:57 - the same except instead of change wide
03:00 - by 15 we need to put in change y x minus
03:03 - 15 then we connect it to the block that
03:07 - phase when down arrow key pressed to
03:10 - make the cat's move right we repeat the
03:12 - same process as before however it is
03:15 - important to remember that left and
03:17 - right are on the x-axis not the y axis
03:20 - we dragged in change X by 10 and
03:24 - increase the number to increase speed
03:26 - then we connect it to the block that
03:29 - saved when right arrow key pressed to
03:32 - activate it to make the cat moves left
03:35 - we repeat our earlier steps making sure
03:37 - to use a negative change x x value
03:40 - instead of a positive one to ensure it
03:43 - goes to the left then we connect it to
03:46 - the blocks that phase when left arrow
03:48 - key pressed
03:53 - now let's test our clothes I'll press
03:55 - the right arrow key now the left arrow
03:58 - key the up arrow key and the down arrow
04:02 - key our cat sprite is moving correctly
04:04 - now let's go to step 3 to make the fish
04:08 - move randomly round the screen currently
04:11 - we only have one sprite in our game so
04:14 - we need to select a new sprite from the
04:16 - sprite library i'll choose the fish
04:18 - bright
04:24 - I want the fish to start moving at the
04:26 - top right corner of the screen when the
04:29 - green flag is pressed to close our fish
04:31 - sprite we need an event block in the
04:34 - event category we can find the when
04:37 - green flag clicked block and the go-to
04:40 - exposition y-position block under the
04:43 - motion category places together and
04:46 - change the x position to minus 200 and
04:49 - the y position to 150 that is the top
04:52 - right corner of the screen
05:05 - let's test this I'll place the fish away
05:08 - from this location and then press the
05:10 - green flag when I click on the green
05:12 - flag it moves the top right corner our
05:15 - code works now select move 10 steps
05:18 - under motion and change its number 220
05:29 - to make our fish easier to catch we can
05:32 - use our weight one sex block which can
05:35 - be found under the control category to
05:37 - make it move faster decrease the number
05:40 - tumult point2 now we want the fish to
05:43 - move around forever let's grab her
05:46 - forever block which can be found in the
05:48 - control category hover the forever block
05:51 - over the move to and glide blocks so
05:54 - that it looks like the forever block is
05:56 - about to eat the four blocks then let go
05:59 - the forever block should have the move
06:02 - to new and glide blocks inside it now
06:04 - let's run the script for the fish you
06:07 - can see that when it hits the edge of
06:09 - the screen it stops to continue moving
06:12 - and to bounce off the edges of the
06:14 - screen use a block that phase if on edge
06:17 - bounce found under the motion category
06:20 - now let's click on the green flag and
06:23 - see what happens see how the fish now
06:26 - bounces off the edges of the screen now
06:29 - we want to make the fish moves around
06:31 - randomly to do this we need to combine
06:34 - two blocks one of them is the pick
06:37 - random one to 10 block under operators
06:40 - and change its numbers to minus five and
06:43 - five
06:51 - the other block is turn right 15 degrees
06:54 - I put my random number block to replace
06:57 - the number 15 now place these combined
07:00 - blocks between the weight block and
07:02 - bounce block to get the fish to term in
07:04 - different directions from minus 5
07:06 - degrees to plus 5 degrees that is the
07:10 - fish turns randomly to the left or to
07:12 - the right it works the fish is now
07:16 - moving randomly across the screen you
07:19 - can see that when the fish and cat touch
07:21 - nothing happens so now we need to code
07:24 - the final step in our game first let's
07:27 - click on the fish what we want to happen
07:30 - is when the cat touches the fish the
07:32 - fish says hello cat and the scripts stop
07:36 - running we do this by getting an if
07:38 - block and a touching block put the
07:41 - touching block into the gap in the if
07:43 - block then click on the drop-down menu
07:46 - and select sprite one so now the code
07:50 - says if touching sprite one then when
07:53 - this happens we want to make our fish
07:56 - bright say hello and stop the script we
07:59 - go into the looks category and get there
08:01 - say hello for two seconds blog type in
08:05 - and add the word cat after the hello
08:08 - takes
08:17 - then go to controls and
08:19 - get the stop all block to stop the
08:21 - scripts after saying hello we actually
08:25 - want to check if the cat is touching the
08:27 - fish all the time we can do this by
08:30 - using a forever loop so let's put all of
08:33 - this in a forever block which we can
08:35 - find in the control category let's click
08:38 - on the green flag yeah it works now I
08:42 - want to do the same thing for the cat so
08:45 - let's select and drag the script that
08:48 - we've recently created and drag it to
08:50 - the sprite one now if you go to the cat
08:53 - scripts you can see we have the same
08:55 - script for the cat change hello cat to
08:59 - hello fish
09:05 - now let's click on the green flag to
09:07 - test our game
09:10 - great it works add your own features to
09:13 - personalize the game perhaps at a timer
09:16 - to play the game with a limited time or
09:19 - change backdrops and add sounds to this
09:22 - game
