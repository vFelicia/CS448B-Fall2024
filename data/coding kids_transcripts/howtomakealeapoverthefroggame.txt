00:00 - [Music]
00:05 - welcome to coding kids today I'm going
00:08 - to show you how to build this game leap
00:11 - over the Frog first let's look at how we
00:14 - play it the player controls the cat by
00:17 - pressing the space key to make the cat
00:19 - jump the aim of the game is to avoid the
00:22 - Frog for as long as you can if you touch
00:24 - the Frog it is game over otherwise you
00:27 - can play the game forever now let's
00:30 - build the game there are four parts to
00:32 - the game won the game backdrop to the
00:36 - cat three the frog and four game over I
00:40 - will build this game one step at a time
00:43 - first let's start with a brand new
00:46 - project by clicking on the create button
00:48 - on the home page as you can see a new
00:51 - project starts with the cat sprite as a
00:53 - default the sprite is the character or
00:56 - object that we use in making the
00:58 - computer program for step one let's add
01:01 - the backdrop by clicking on the
01:03 - miniature backdrop icon on the bottom
01:05 - left of the screen then scroll down
01:08 - until you find a backdrop that you like
01:11 - you may choose to use a different
01:12 - backdrop to me double click on the
01:15 - backdrop that you have selected or click
01:17 - on the backdrop then click the ok'
01:20 - button for step two let's program the
01:23 - cat so that it jumps when we press the
01:25 - space key click on the cat sprite and
01:28 - then click on the scripts tab at the top
01:30 - center to activate the cat when we press
01:33 - the space key we will need an events
01:35 - block in the event block category we can
01:38 - find a block that says when space key
01:40 - pressed let's drag this block into the
01:43 - workspace to make the cat jump we need
01:46 - to get the cat to start at the bottom of
01:48 - the screen then glide upwards then glide
01:52 - downwards back to its original position
01:54 - let's locate the cat in a position at
01:57 - the bottom of the screen using a go to
01:59 - block which you can find under motion
02:02 - for example at x equals zero and y
02:06 - equals minus 60
02:08 - [Music]
02:12 - let's use to glide blocks one to glide
02:16 - upwards to x equals zero and y equals
02:20 - 150 and then the second glide block to
02:23 - return to x equals zero and y equals
02:26 - minus 60 now I'm at step three I will
02:31 - select a new sprite from the sprite
02:33 - library oscillate the Frog sprite I want
02:36 - the Frog to start at the right side of
02:38 - the screen glide to the left stop start
02:41 - again at the right side of the screen
02:43 - and repeat until game over first let's
02:47 - program the Frog to start at the right
02:49 - side of the screen I'll use the go-to
02:51 - block to do that with the coordinates of
02:54 - x equals 270 and y equals minus 80 you
02:59 - can find the go-to block under the
03:01 - motion category with this one block in
03:04 - the workspace by itself if you click on
03:06 - the block the code runs so move the Frog
03:10 - to the top of the screen then click on
03:12 - the block to see it work we won the
03:15 - scratch program to activate this code at
03:17 - the start of the game we start the game
03:19 - by clicking on the green flag let's find
03:22 - an events block that does just that here
03:25 - is the when green flag clicked block we
03:28 - stack this when green flag clicked block
03:30 - on top of the go-to block like Lego
03:33 - bricks now let's move the Frog to the
03:36 - top of the screen and then click on the
03:38 - green flag it works
03:40 - now I want the Frog to glide to the left
03:44 - side of the screen so I'll go to the
03:46 - motion category and drag over the glide
03:49 - block and stick it under the go-to block
03:51 - I want the Frog to glide to the left the
03:55 - leftmost point on the stage is an x
03:57 - coordinate of negative 240 so I'll make
04:02 - the coordinates on the glide block x
04:04 - equals minus 240 and y equals minus 80
04:08 - let's click on the green flag and test
04:11 - the code it works
04:13 - now we want the Frog to do this forever
04:16 - let's grab the forever block which I can
04:19 - find in controls hover the forever block
04:22 - of the go-to and fly blocks so that it
04:25 - looks like the forever block is about to
04:28 - eat the two motion blocks then let go
04:30 - let's click on the green flag and test
04:33 - the code it works
04:35 - have a look at your frog is it too fast
04:38 - or too slow how will you go playing with
04:41 - it what can you do to slow it down there
04:43 - are two ways you can tweak the frogs
04:45 - movement change the number of seconds in
04:47 - the glide block and you can add a wait
04:50 - block which you can find in controls you
04:54 - can see that when the Frog and the cat
04:55 - touch nothing happens so now I will code
04:58 - up the game over part of the game first
05:01 - let's click on the miniature of the
05:03 - backdrop brick wall then click on the
05:05 - backdrop tab at the top center of the
05:07 - screen delete the blank backdrop
05:10 - duplicate the brick wall backdrop or the
05:13 - backdrop you selected add text by
05:16 - clicking on the text icon which looks
05:18 - like a letter T type game over over the
05:22 - backdrop
05:22 - [Music]
05:25 - rename the backdrop from brick world to
05:28 - game over
05:29 - [Music]
05:38 - now we need to go back to the cat to add
05:41 - the code to trigger game over what we
05:43 - want to happen is when the cat touches
05:46 - the Frog the backdrop changes to the
05:48 - game over backdrop and the scripts stop
05:51 - running
05:52 - [Music]
05:58 - we do this by getting an if block and a
06:02 - touching block we put the touching block
06:04 - into the gap in the if block we click on
06:08 - the drop down menu and select frog so
06:11 - now the codes say if touching frog then
06:14 - when this happens we want to change the
06:17 - backdrop and stop the scripts we go to
06:19 - the looks category and pick the
06:21 - Switchback drop block and place it into
06:24 - the if block we click on the drop down
06:27 - menu and to make sure that we have
06:29 - selected the game over backdrop
06:33 - [Music]
06:38 - next we go to controls to get the stop
06:41 - all block to stop the scripts at game
06:44 - over let's click on the green flag hmm
06:47 - why isn't the game switching to game
06:49 - over when the cat touches the Frog let's
06:52 - look at the script when green flag
06:54 - clicked we are checking to see if the
06:57 - cat is touching the Frog but when do we
07:00 - want to check this we actually want to
07:02 - check if the cat is touching the Frog
07:04 - all the time we want the program to do
07:07 - this check forever so let's put all of
07:09 - this in a forever block which we can
07:12 - find in control now let's click on the
07:15 - green flag to test our game great it
07:18 - works add your own features to
07:20 - personalize the game perhaps add a score
07:23 - or number of lives or a timer
