00:00 - a little thing on the top saying this is
00:03 - being recorded all right but yeah other
00:05 - than that you can't continue okay so for
00:11 - now wait I'm just gonna see if I can use
00:16 - yeah I can see that it's like a little
00:18 - red door thing recording yep
00:20 - yeah and share here we go the whole
00:24 - iPhones si but now it's just green yep
00:29 - yep a screen and it's just loading up
00:35 - yep okay cool I can see it mm-hmm I took
00:50 - chains is a bit might have change of it
00:52 - that's okay mm-hmm it looks good so far
01:13 - [Music]
01:15 - it looks pretty good to me
01:17 - so have you test it as well and get
01:20 - people on it if you want I can show you
01:22 - sure it looks like it works but just
01:26 - just have a look at it all right here we
01:35 - go and then you can just continue
01:51 - playing it yeah and that's I warded this
01:55 - time like that just it okay please try
01:59 - again and then you just type it there
02:02 - yes I actually type it this time cool
02:08 - looks good to me
02:09 - um does it all make sense to you as well
02:13 - yeah if it seems yeah it looks pretty
02:16 - easy yeah yep okay that's good yes I
02:20 - might move you on to the other topics
02:23 - possibly this was also just the revision
02:26 - that I'll see if you know any of like
02:28 - what we're gonna do today if you do we
02:32 - can like move on to a different level
02:34 - let me just open if it's possible will
02:38 - we be doing anything like sort of
02:41 - drawing drawing so have you done
02:43 - anything with turtle have you heard of
02:46 - turtle turtle yes but if I can say I
02:50 - mean I'm talking about more a bit like
02:52 - TK inter and Kansas okay so I'm not sure
02:58 - if that's unlike these lesson plans let
03:02 - me just have a look and see how much you
03:06 - know the other stuff yeah give me one
03:09 - second let me just have a look yeah cuz
03:14 - I'm not sure we do TK inter with this
03:18 - class but we could try have a look at it
03:22 - let me see what have you learned about
03:29 - things like functions and stuff yeah I
03:34 - yeah yes I've done that before you've
03:37 - done that before okay um let me go
03:40 - through the other stuff as well have you
03:47 - let me get it open so what kind of
03:50 - drawing were you thinking of like with
03:53 - tea game well I didn't like necessarily
03:57 - jory but just sort of the game that
03:59 - might be able to have some sort of
04:00 - background and some sort of right yep
04:05 - okay I get you if you want I can show
04:08 - you another program I did following a
04:10 - book yeah yeah sure that would be good
04:12 - just so I can get an idea
04:15 - - stuff you know which one was it
04:24 - there we go that's wanna hold it
04:27 - open with it should come up in a bit
04:37 - okay that's fine sometimes takes a
04:40 - couple of seconds to load and I think
04:43 - it's a bit slow because I'm watching you
04:46 - scratch shared screen as well
04:54 - maybe I should just trigger
04:56 - yeah I can see it loading right there we
05:18 - go okay so this one was using a book
05:23 - Memphis and I'm getting most of it I've
05:27 - added some color as well than to what
05:31 - the book says uncle also you're
05:34 - following like a book about Python yeah
05:36 - and I've added some of my own things
05:38 - okay that's pretty cool and if you click
05:50 - this white yes white is the French of
05:53 - this way there's some clear everything
05:56 - but I had a sort of a logic bug that
05:59 - includes the buttons as well yeah looks
06:02 - good so far so um that was just you
06:05 - following a book was it yeah
06:08 - that's pretty impressive do you
06:10 - understand everything that's happening
06:12 - in that program most of it most of it
06:15 - okay like most of it I can get okay
06:23 - that's cool it's like I think the one I
06:26 - don't really understand it just these
06:29 - numbers those numbers are in work sort
06:33 - of okay so I think I'm pretty sure it's
06:36 - kind of like a grid system oh it's just
06:39 - like the location
06:40 - yeah sure how your location works that's
06:44 - how it works right I think I figured out
06:47 - the pattern so that's how I keep adding
06:49 - on more colors oh yeah if I were to
06:52 - start from scratch about the book I
06:54 - wouldn't be able with that okay yeah
06:57 - cool well that looks pretty cool I'm
07:01 - just checking if like we have any TK
07:04 - inter stuff I'm not a hundred percent
07:07 - sure if we do I think um some of the
07:10 - games we do we make it with and let me
07:15 - try open it up and see what it looks
07:17 - like I think we make it mole with turtle
07:22 - and it makes game-like stuff but let me
07:26 - just have a look but also have you
07:29 - worked with things like timers and first
07:33 - pardon time is sorry in Python no not
07:37 - really sure that would be good to do
07:39 - okay because what I'm thinking is
07:41 - because like you kind of want to make an
07:43 - interactive game but what our lessons
07:46 - kind of do is they teach you like the
07:49 - fundamentals of Python yeah they're kind
07:51 - of build on on like what you've done
07:54 - before so I was just thinking for today
07:58 - we can like work on something that you
08:00 - haven't learnt yet but then I'll check
08:03 - also if we have any other TK into stuff
08:05 - for next week but because generally it's
08:08 - good to know like these fundamental
08:10 - stuff cuz I'm later on when you make
08:12 - more complex games you have this like
08:15 - basis knowledge it's like you feel
08:18 - making a game you can like add things
08:20 - like time is and you know like all these
08:23 - other different Python things does that
08:27 - sound okay to you
08:28 - yeah okay okay so I'll just note it down
08:32 - and I'll get back to you about the TK
08:34 - into stuff but for now I'll see like
08:37 - what you haven't learnt and then we can
08:39 - start like learning that stuff too let
08:46 - me start with so you said you've done
08:49 - some stuff with functions right yes yep
08:53 - does it all make sense to you yeah I
08:56 - believe so
08:57 - wait did you want me to open - yeah sure
09:02 - yeah and while you're doing that do you
09:04 - wanna try explain to me what a function
09:07 - does but there okay
09:10 - there can be some functions mm-hmm but
09:13 - you can also create your functions yep
09:16 - what you do with the functions is it's
09:20 - sort of this stuff it just allows you to
09:24 - not have to repeat the same code several
09:26 - times yep exactly
09:28 - and good job and then you know do you
09:32 - know how to make a function I saw you
09:34 - used it before but I believe so just
09:37 - yeah I can't seem to find my first place
09:40 - nice can you just type it in yeah I
09:42 - don't get - okay here we go
09:46 - like I'll just go I know I see what you
09:48 - mean yes I don't like no that seems
10:00 - really weird is it not showing up what
10:07 - if we just tried yeah okay okay did you
10:10 - not installed it on this one I found it
10:13 - ah he found it on top for somewhere
10:17 - should have still showed up when
10:19 - searching looks a bit unusual all right
10:24 - there we go
10:25 - I wrote it over you got it cool okay let
10:30 - me just try to get something up to
10:32 - quickly show you just give me a couple
10:38 - of seconds
10:47 - sorry give me one second yeah
10:56 - I do admit I don't totally remember how
10:58 - to use a function okay that's okay so
11:01 - I'll quickly go over that and then we
11:03 - can move on to the next thing
11:05 - so yeah had it okay so you have idle
11:09 - open let me just give it up so I'll just
11:12 - show you an example of how to do the
11:14 - functions with Tuttle so do you remember
11:16 - turtle and how like they have the dot
11:20 - forward and dark circle and stuff I know
11:24 - what turtle you can know yeah they go
11:26 - forward or using pixels and they can
11:28 - turn yeah yeah so I'll just quickly show
11:32 - you so I'll get you to the dude remember
11:35 - how to use turtle you know yeah I
11:39 - believe and then what you need to do is
11:50 - you need to create your actual little
11:53 - turtle like icon thing did you have your
11:58 - turtle hook great um oh so it's not
12:01 - actually the word create sorry
12:03 - so you have to like give you a total a
12:06 - name so like you could call it Bob Oh
12:08 - golly Oh something you didn't like the
12:14 - variable so you just go like bub equals
12:16 - okay yep doesn't importing turtle
12:22 - already sort of do that yeah so it does
12:25 - but what we're doing is we're just
12:26 - making like our little turtle case with
12:29 - like a different name yep
12:31 - you can import turtle and then say like
12:34 - you could just use turtle actually yeah
12:37 - I think it probably wouldn't make much
12:40 - of a difference
12:41 - so then dr8 just equals turtle dot yep
12:45 - and then turtle dot and then turtle with
12:47 - a capital T after that and I'm open and
12:53 - close brackets yep
12:58 - jus-just me right outside the curved
13:01 - brackets okay one neither nine and zero
13:05 - well okay don't put a normal brackets oh
13:08 - yeah yep and so that's just created the
13:14 - total really quickly so then you can
13:18 - just go you can change colors can't you
13:22 - yeah so you can change colors yeah one
13:26 - thing I was saying is like there's a
13:27 - function so like you know how you have
13:31 - saying functions it's like a bit of code
13:32 - which you can just repeat here like
13:35 - turtle already has like a whole bunch of
13:37 - inbuilt functions so like they have
13:40 - something called circle so you can go
13:42 - like Liam duck circle and then in
13:50 - brackets again so just the normal how
13:54 - big it will be
13:55 - yep so inside that you have to put how
13:57 - big it will be
13:58 - but how do you I mean so do you know how
14:03 - it shapes like in circles there's a
14:05 - radius sorta is not just like from that
14:09 - side to this side so it's like like with
14:12 - the circle it's like that line which is
14:15 - like kind of like half the size okay
14:18 - yeah yeah so the rate for example could
14:22 - be 50 pixels yeah and then what you can
14:26 - do is you can just run it so that number
14:28 - inside the brackets that's called a
14:30 - parameter have you heard of that before
14:33 - something called a parameter I do
14:36 - believe so sometimes it's basically like
14:40 - in a method or function you can like use
14:43 - numbers that people like the user inputs
14:47 - or like that we kind of put in and then
14:50 - you can like change it depending on that
14:53 - so like in this case it's like drawing a
14:55 - circle but like instead of inside the
14:59 - function having the circle always had a
15:01 - set size like you can change the size by
15:03 - changing that parameter so I'll just
15:07 - quickly let you run it
15:12 - there we go so yeah so it drew the
15:14 - circle so anyway that was just like
15:17 - intro to title but the point I was
15:20 - trying to make is that's a function you
15:23 - know the like turtle has a function
15:25 - called circle so what we can quickly do
15:27 - just to quickly like refresh your memory
15:30 - on functions is we'll make our own
15:33 - function but this time to draw a square
15:37 - so what we can do is there's something
15:41 - cold so we have to like create a
15:44 - definition in Python so yes sir okay I
15:47 - think I remember now
15:48 - yeah so what are just typing des yeah I
15:55 - remember
15:56 - yep so that's kind of like defining the
16:00 - function where isn't it diff square
16:02 - actually
16:03 - yes it's def square square and then you
16:15 - have your brackets and then wait don't
16:18 - you need to put something like a and B
16:21 - so you don't have to so that's what as
16:24 - I'm explaining those are parameters so
16:27 - for example if you wanted it to always
16:30 - be like the same set size you don't need
16:34 - to put any parameters you can just draw
16:35 - the square at like 100 pixels by 100
16:38 - pixels but if you wanted to be able to
16:40 - change it so like how we do it circle
16:43 - then you need to put a parameter in so
16:46 - it doesn't have to be a or B it can just
16:49 - be any word so like we could call it
16:51 - side length or something so if you just
16:56 - type that in as one word yep so what
17:02 - that is is it means we can use that it's
17:05 - kind of like a variable and we can use
17:08 - that variable to draw our shape and then
17:14 - that variable would just depend on like
17:16 - what the person types in inside the
17:18 - brackets does that make sense yeah
17:22 - okay so what we need to do next is
17:26 - actually draw the square like physically
17:28 - with turtle so to draw a square what do
17:33 - we need to actually draw we just we
17:37 - would have to go liam dot square so
17:41 - without doing square cuz we're actually
17:43 - making this function okay you want to do
17:46 - it like kind of from scratch just to get
17:49 - an idea so like doing it with like lines
17:52 - and turning but like when you think
17:55 - about it like how would we draw a square
17:57 - what do we need we need four so forward
18:06 - this is where we can use our variable or
18:09 - that parameter called side length yep so
18:12 - instead of giving it like a set size of
18:14 - going like for water like 50 pixels we
18:18 - can actually use that word side blade so
18:22 - then later when we call that function
18:24 - you can just change the number yeah yep
18:28 - yes we we drill like we go forward and
18:32 - then what do we do this simply yeah okay
18:42 - this one's just 90 or ready yep so it's
18:45 - just 90 because it's a square and then
18:48 - because this is a square how many times
18:50 - do we need to do that we we need to do
18:54 - the first one that's highlighted four
18:57 - times mm-hmm and the bottom one we only
19:00 - actually need to do three times make
19:03 - sure yeah
19:06 - but some people do can do it four times
19:08 - just to make it go back but yeah yeah
19:11 - three times but another thing instead of
19:15 - actually copying and pasting those bit
19:17 - of those lines like four times what's
19:20 - the last the way we could do it do you
19:22 - know oh we just be copying the whole
19:25 - thing like that but instead of like
19:28 - having heaps of lines of code like a way
19:30 - to make it shorter like so do you
19:33 - remember what we could do to like repeat
19:34 - it
19:37 - mmm so have you used loops and Python oh
19:41 - yeah yep yeah of course yeah so it it
19:45 - just makes it easier so that instead of
19:47 - having like a whole lot of code in our
19:49 - file like instead of having eight lines
19:53 - or seven lines we would just have that
19:56 - little bit of code should you remember
19:59 - how to do the loop in Python yes it what
20:02 - do you want this to be a while loop or
20:03 - for loop um so follow but yelling yeah
20:07 - because we just want to loop through
20:10 - that point of code four times so we did
20:14 - it for X in for yep but you might just
20:19 - need to do it for X in range for okay so
20:23 - yeah it's just saying like a range from
20:25 - a range of four and then don't forget to
20:33 - indent the other stuff and then you can
20:39 - just get rid of that second dot forward
20:43 - it flowed mm-hmm so now like what you
20:48 - have in your function so this is kind of
20:50 - defining the function and it's just
20:52 - basically telling like the code to
20:55 - actually draw a physical square but now
20:59 - to actually use that function we have to
21:02 - do it like how we kind of do the circle
21:03 - thing yeah wait dude except oh sorry
21:08 - what we gonna say can you just write
21:11 - square side length it doesn't have to be
21:13 - turtle dot squares right yep so because
21:16 - you made this function you just go
21:17 - square side length instead of like
21:20 - turtle duck yeah the reason the turtle
21:23 - dot thing is that is because it's part
21:26 - of that turtle library but because you
21:29 - made this yourself
21:31 - yeah you just write this time I don't
21:35 - write sign laughs I can write for
21:36 - example 200 yep exactly and then I just
21:41 - go run
21:50 - no that was the first several okay yeah
21:55 - yeah so does that make sense of how to
21:57 - make a function yes yeah and then you
22:00 - can keep like repeating that so you
22:02 - could go like square and then you can
22:04 - make a smaller square after that
22:06 - so like an square 200 you know like
22:10 - square 100 and then the little two
22:12 - squares so it just saves you from like
22:16 - having to repeat that bit of code all
22:18 - the time how small would this be just my
22:22 - curiosity might just look like a little
22:26 - dot I guess we'll find out yeah no it's
22:37 - pretty small
22:38 - you get very tiny it's very tiny but
22:41 - they're four pixels colored-in yeah yeah
22:44 - that's pretty cool it's smaller than the
22:48 - cursor yeah so yeah so does that all
22:52 - make sense to you yes yep and does that
22:55 - side length thing make sense to you as
22:57 - well yes yep so that's called a
22:59 - parameter so basically you can just
23:01 - change like that number it's kind of
23:07 - like a variable but in a function so
23:10 - without you oh sorry what are you gonna
23:11 - say yes right you're continuing I was
23:14 - just gonna say like without you having
23:16 - to make a function that's like a square
23:18 - of 100 pixels each side it can like
23:21 - change depending on the user so what may
23:25 - I just ask yeah would it help you if I
23:30 - showed you more of the things I did yeah
23:33 - sure yeah because there are other things
23:40 - that I did mm-hmm
23:43 - like to see okay wait I have to go like
23:47 - this oh yeah so the reason why I was
23:54 - just going through this is just to check
23:55 - that you know what it does because I can
23:59 - see that
23:59 - you've used it but just to check that
24:01 - yeah like you can understand it himself
24:03 - that's all I am see you've already done
24:09 - something similar yeah Oh George six of
24:15 - them of the snuggly thing yeah okay
24:20 - that's pretty cool yeah so that one uses
24:24 - similar concepts and if you would just
24:26 - like to see one that's completely about
24:29 - parameters yeah this I believe this one
24:33 - would be perfect
24:42 - oh wait no I'm not even sure see all
24:52 - right here we go there you go so mm-hmm
25:06 - it's it's not okay
25:09 - honestly not yeah it does do sort of it
25:12 - does use parameters yeah yeah yeah I can
25:17 - see quite a few parameters but yeah yeah
25:20 - I just wanted to double-check that you
25:23 - oh like you understood what all the
25:26 - functions and parameters was about I can
25:29 - quickly move on to have you learned to
25:33 - like write to a file and stuff as well
25:35 - in Python to a file
25:38 - yeah so like writing things to a file no
25:42 - no okay that's okay so I'm like great to
25:45 - learn that will be great to learn okay
25:46 - so I think that's actually in a couple
25:49 - of weeks but like I'll quickly go
25:51 - through these so you could probably
25:53 - power through them but the next thing
25:55 - I'll do is timeless so again I'm just
25:58 - let me know if it is too easy for you
26:01 - but I'm just going through these because
26:03 - then you have like a basic understanding
26:05 - of what Python can do and then you know
26:07 - like more of what Python can do yeah so
26:10 - that you're able to make more complex
26:13 - and things but yeah so what I'll get you
26:16 - to do is open up another Idol window
26:25 - whatever you if I just deleted this one
26:28 - I don't know that's why it's up to you
26:31 - yeah
26:32 - yo program so you can change it there we
26:43 - go okay so just to double check do you
26:46 - know what a library is in Python I'm not
26:54 - really okay so I think I'm not I know
26:57 - you can have dictionaries and lists but
26:59 - nothing okay so I think you know like
27:02 - you use libraries before so I turtle and
27:04 - there's like random and stuff that
27:08 - already oh yeah so then modules so yeah
27:11 - they're pretty much the same thing so
27:13 - the timer also has its own module so
27:16 - it's called time so the first thing you
27:18 - need to do is import time yeah I think
27:23 - I've tried doing a code on this but that
27:25 - didn't really work okay well let me know
27:29 - if it sounds familiar as we go on okay
27:32 - yep if not we can move on to the next
27:35 - topic so yeah so we have time and what
27:39 - we like you can do various things with
27:41 - time so one thing you can do is like
27:44 - like we can find out what the current
27:46 - time is so to do that you go so do you
27:51 - remember in libraries how you gotta go
27:52 - something done and then a function or we
27:56 - have to go time dot and then you have to
27:59 - type in a SC hey C time yep and then the
28:07 - brackets just the normal but how would
28:11 - you know which country you're in
28:14 - I'm not a hundred percent sure on that I
28:17 - think you could probably change it but I
28:21 - think what it does is it probably gets
28:23 - it from your computer
28:24 - yeah possibly
28:27 - that's a good question we can try look
28:29 - it up and see but yeah I think you could
28:34 - probably change the timezone but I think
28:36 - like when you like install Python and
28:38 - stuff it sets it up so if I were to just
28:47 - click run now it would show me the time
28:49 - it could but one thing you might need to
28:52 - do is to actually you might need to
28:55 - print it if that doesn't work yeah yeah
28:58 - I know that was my fault for not telling
29:00 - you sir
29:01 - like the print in breathitt yeah I
29:07 - forgot you ready yeah I thought it might
29:11 - over but maybe not I might walk in the
29:14 - show oh yeah it probably would just work
29:16 - in the show oh yeah it's very specific
29:20 - yeah so it couldn't sell like the whole
29:22 - date time and everything is it the
29:25 - correct time yeah I do believe so 6:24
29:29 - does that say 6:00 okay
29:32 - wait wait it's done the seconds as well
29:35 - yeah so it's really specific so that's
29:38 - why I'm like with this time thing when
29:41 - like when you make more complex games
29:43 - you can actually like have timers in it
29:45 - and stuff so like that's how you create
29:49 - timers you kind of get the current time
29:51 - and then you make a timer and then you
29:54 - base the seconds off that so how do you
29:56 - create a timer dinner um okay let me
30:01 - double check how to do that so to create
30:04 - a timer in Python you might need to make
30:08 - a variable give me a second let me just
30:12 - quickly check up on this I don't want to
30:16 - tell you the wrong thing okay to give me
30:25 - one second
30:28 - while you're waiting another thing you
30:31 - can try is instead of a SC time there's
30:34 - another thing called local time for el
30:37 - trato yes yeah I gave her 8
30:40 - remember reading a book that said we're
30:43 - different oh yes I think they are
30:47 - similar but there are some slight
30:49 - differences there I think because there
30:52 - it's one of those funny books that talks
30:54 - about science and funny stuff at the
30:56 - same time oh yeah they're talking about
30:59 - it for an excuse to come late to school
31:00 - oh okay here we go
31:05 - it says the what does that say there's
31:12 - an hour 18 26 minutes no it seems to be
31:16 - the same actually yes oh I think what
31:18 - this is it's the same but it's like kind
31:21 - of set up differently so like it's kind
31:23 - of split differently do you see how it's
31:26 - like they're like you know how the other
31:28 - one just printed the time straightaway
31:30 - yeah this kind of breaks it up so what I
31:33 - think what you can do with this local
31:35 - time is you can actually just extract
31:37 - certain bits from it so instead of
31:40 - getting like that whole like date time
31:43 - seconds you could just get the time well
31:45 - you can just get the seconds or just get
31:47 - a minute it's like time don't our time
31:51 - maybe yes I think let me find the exact
31:57 - specifications I'm pretty sure you have
32:00 - to type something in those brackets in
32:02 - local time yeah doesn't seem to work
32:05 - yeah
32:07 - let me find it for you it works hey I
32:10 - closed it yes so I'm pretty sure there's
32:20 - something like if you type in like a
32:22 - capital y or something you can get like
32:28 - the year
32:29 - let me try find it for you let me see if
32:32 - it's awesome I'm just gonna go turn on
32:33 - some other in line oh yeah sure that's
32:36 - why just let me know when you're
32:57 - hopefully that's better for you
33:00 - yeah I can't actually see your face and
33:03 - I couldn't see your face okay yes that's
33:05 - better my screen was small so I couldn't
33:07 - see okay let me get back to what I was
33:11 - telling you so the certain parameters
33:15 - that you can get to get like the
33:20 - specific like things like seconds and
33:22 - stuff from the time so I'm just trying
33:25 - to find the exact one you're like - what
33:31 - what about it gave us some options if we
33:34 - just the answer and we write something
33:38 - proof or a so I think you still have to
33:43 - go like local time possibly and then
33:46 - inside the brackets you might need to
33:49 - type something to try the nfe you might
34:00 - need to percentage them and so yep
34:05 - doesn't work doesn't seem to have yeah
34:14 - our let's write out I think that's also
34:19 - thing called just seconds and years and
34:22 - stuff you be and then how do you see
34:25 - yeah I don't see but then from here for
34:30 - example just a little later
34:31 - mm-hmm
34:54 - okay that's back of it so did you have a
34:59 - question before
35:00 - no it's it wait so did you figure out
35:03 - how to actually do a timer yes so I
35:07 - found one thing let me so what you could
35:11 - do is okay let me just check
35:17 - I think timers are a bit more complex
35:22 - because there's like a few more things
35:24 - you need to do but I might can I show
35:28 - you what I believe a time yeah sure I
35:30 - believe you can do a timer like it might
35:37 - actually okay here we go oh that one yes
35:41 - so that's one way you can do it and then
35:43 - you can just and then it comes in
35:45 - seconds you can go like 60 seconds
35:48 - yeah so that's one way you can do the
35:50 - time I like to actually like wait and
35:53 - then do something so like you know how
35:56 - have you done scratch okay yeah I see
35:59 - what you mean yes I've done screw
36:01 - okay kind of like that wait book okay so
36:04 - you mean if you want to run something at
36:05 - the same time oh if you want to run
36:08 - something at the same time so wait what
36:11 - what was your okay no what I was saying
36:14 - was like it's kind of like in scratch do
36:17 - you know that wait something book one
36:21 - like wait yeah yeah so that's why I
36:23 - shouldn't say like the sleep one is just
36:25 - like wait so just like you can do
36:27 - something and you can wait a bit and do
36:29 - something else so say your head
36:32 - what are you thinking about then were
36:35 - they the more complex one which one is
36:37 - it so I thought you were wanting to know
36:39 - about like timers like on the screen
36:42 - like a time yes possibly let me try find
36:48 - it for you because I was finding some
36:50 - options I think you can do them
36:53 - differently let me
36:55 - something else up give me a second yeah
37:06 - cuz with time is like I think like
37:08 - usually you can use the sleep thing cuz
37:11 - you can just wait yeah actually you
37:16 - could probably use a sleep thing and
37:18 - then what you could do is like if you
37:19 - wanted to set a timer on the screen you
37:22 - could just have like a variable cold
37:25 - like the time account and you can use
37:28 - sleep so for example if you just wanted
37:31 - like a timer like a sector like a second
37:34 - time or that counts like 1 2 3 4 that
37:36 - kind of thing you could just make a
37:38 - variable so we can try it now
37:41 - ok so you can make a variable called
37:45 - like seconds something oh you can call
37:50 - it whatever you want and then you
37:54 - started off at 0 and then you just have
38:00 - like your while loop like a forever like
38:03 - a loop that would go on forever so you
38:06 - can just type in something like while
38:08 - true take second while oh no sorry so
38:22 - seconds would still have to start off at
38:24 - 0 and then the next line would be the
38:27 - while loop sorry okay I get it okay so
38:31 - we just create a variable and then now
38:33 - what we want to do is in a loop we
38:35 - always want to show that variable but we
38:37 - want to make it bigger so you can go
38:40 - well true yeah and inside that loop you
38:43 - can go like you can just keep adding one
38:47 - two seconds like you could go to do you
38:51 - know how you would do that print yeah so
38:57 - print second and then after that you'd
39:02 - need to increase seconds said you know
39:04 - how you do that yeah mm-hmm
39:17 - yep and then just buy one and then
39:20 - because we want it to happen every one
39:22 - second you need to actually use that
39:24 - sweet function okay mm-hmm leap and then
39:34 - just remember you need something in that
39:37 - sleep in the brackets okay yeah I need
39:39 - to tell it how long we need to see one
39:44 - second yep now if you run it so this is
39:50 - actually a more easier way to do a timer
39:59 - it's like do you see how it's counting
40:03 - down the seconds yeah I see does that
40:05 - make sense so like something you can do
40:07 - with that is if I just quickly share my
40:10 - screen you'll have to stop sharing no
40:16 - it's okay when I share my screen it just
40:18 - stopped seals automatically so can you
40:27 - see my screen no I see black you see
40:31 - black but it has told me that you
40:35 - started to share okay yep and I see it
40:37 - okay
40:37 - okay so what you can do with like that
40:41 - second kind of timer that we did just
40:44 - now is you could make like a thing like
40:46 - a clock so I'll just show you like once
40:51 - it loads so with turtle you can kind of
40:56 - have like a ticking cup clock dudes can
41:01 - you see my screen so well how did you do
41:03 - that one yeah yeah so do you want to
41:05 - work on that now Johanna H over that
41:07 - okay
41:08 - yeah that's fine that's like the next
41:10 - part of what is gonna show you anyway
41:12 - and does that seem interesting to you
41:16 - yes yeah okay so I'm gonna stop sharing
41:20 - my screen again and you can share you
41:23 - thank you so this just uses a
41:26 - combination of what we just did before
41:28 - by like creating that variable kind of
41:32 - thing so this time it doesn't have the
41:34 - variable we just use the sleep function
41:37 - and wait sir can you see my screen yeah
41:42 - I can see it's me this is one of the
41:45 - programs I did it was just basically
41:46 - trying to get a clock oh yeah trying to
41:51 - get a clock on to walk and did it whoa
41:55 - when you rent it oh did it do anything
41:57 - if you wanna can show you it's not it's
42:00 - not totally working look what is the
42:07 - hour for example it's six minutes it's
42:12 - free seven six forty seven but it
42:17 - doesn't seem to be working okay so what
42:21 - did you want it to do oh I just I'm just
42:26 - trying to be able to just print every
42:29 - minute the new clock okay so like 637
42:33 - 638 yes that kind of thing yeah as in
42:38 - minutes or seconds sorry its minutes
42:41 - okay oh so you kind of want to like
42:43 - create a clock and then yeah the next
42:47 - minute has 10 like changed okay so one
42:50 - way you could do that is kind of like
42:52 - what we did before so you know how we
42:54 - had the seconds thing before we made
42:57 - that variable the seconds so you could
43:00 - kind of do it like that
43:01 - yeah can I ask is this isn't this what
43:05 - we have done okay let me look a while to
43:09 - print a oh wait or did I do it in the
43:13 - wrong order
43:13 - Oh a minutes sleep one B plus a equals
43:22 - one please a plus B if B is equal to 60
43:29 - Hey okay so it looks kind of right
43:36 - let me have a closer look I do I do see
43:39 - some mistakes in here but yeah
43:42 - so much beer days look but they look
43:46 - like the logic ones not yeah
43:48 - so if you just run it again what's the
43:51 - error that you can do it
43:56 - let's check looking at that we'll just
44:05 - stick it quickly ok string not int okay
44:15 - so it's Gordon it's it's like it's
44:19 - managed to get up to right there
44:24 - so I know what the issue is sorry okay
44:28 - you know that input line of code yes is
44:34 - the user like when you type something in
44:36 - it takes it in as a string mm-hmm when
44:41 - you go like so like when you say like
44:44 - the time is like a is nine and then B is
44:46 - 45
44:47 - if thinks of it like as like nine in
44:50 - quotation marks and B is forty-five
44:53 - thinks of it as like a word instead of a
44:56 - number so when you try to go b plus l
44:59 - equals one so you mean that i have to
45:03 - wait so I'm just I'm losing your weight
45:09 - no that's my fault
45:10 - I must have gotten down oh yeah yeah
45:15 - right now for some eat for some for some
45:20 - reason went down to four okay so you're
45:29 - saying that this needs to be a integer
45:34 - so exactly and why not yeah yeah so you
45:43 - just need to convert it so what you can
45:48 - actually do is instead of changing
45:50 - and like it every time PNA is straight
45:54 - off the input on the top you can convert
45:58 - it to an integer there so you can say
46:01 - like a is equal to int input does that
46:07 - make sense
46:08 - oh okay see instead of doing it like in
46:11 - front of every time you use B na you can
46:13 - try yep
46:34 - what we're going out to get rid of those
46:36 - two oh yeah yeah cuz I'm that just saves
46:40 - you from having to type it like every
46:42 - single one but this is just reverse it
47:01 - looks like have several problems okay
47:05 - [Music]
47:12 - okay I think I see my pot I'm using too
47:15 - many different types of instant stirs
47:17 - yeah okay so what you could do is a plus
47:26 - oh yeah so you know the plus thing yeah
47:29 - yeah maybe when you're printing it sorry
47:41 - do you mind opening the error message
47:43 - again so I think it just doesn't like
47:44 - that you keep changing it from into
47:46 - string
47:50 - [Music]
47:55 - we're just not going to ward the night
47:57 - from error okay yes what that error is
48:04 - saying is like you know how with usually
48:07 - integers you can plus it with other
48:09 - integers so it does like math equations
48:12 - and stuff yes it's getting confused
48:14 - cause you're passing it with a string
48:16 - because generally when you like add
48:19 - strings together they just kind of like
48:22 - mush together and print like that but
48:25 - when you add like a number and a string
48:27 - it gets a bit confused and so what you
48:30 - could do is if we go back to your code
48:42 - but if you want we don't you don't have
48:44 - to worry about this we can just go to
48:46 - the one you're working on oh okay sure
48:48 - but I can help you try fix it if all I'm
48:50 - fired flow for them okay I think there's
48:54 - only a few minutes left of this lesson
48:56 - so I can try help you fix this and then
48:59 - if you want next lesson we can continue
49:01 - up with the time of thing okay is that
49:04 - okay with you yep yep and again just let
49:07 - me know if it's like these are too easy
49:09 - for you the timer one was sort of new
49:12 - but yeah for now I'm just I'm still
49:19 - missing a bit if that's okay you're
49:21 - still missing but yeah that's fine
49:23 - so that's why I like I'm just going
49:24 - through these just so that like you know
49:27 - about them and stuff okay so yeah no I
49:34 - mean like sorry I mean like sorry I mean
49:37 - like I'm throwing this thing like I mean
49:42 - obviously it's not really easy because
49:44 - I've got many mistakes yeah but I mean
49:47 - if it's possible next time could I try
49:51 - to see if I can learn something else
49:53 - okay improving on something I know yeah
49:57 - yeah we can do that so we can if you
49:59 - want like quickly - I do that time yeah
50:03 - is that possible yeah
50:05 - yeah so that's actually still with the
50:07 - thymus like that we're learning the full
50:09 - so that's completely fine let me know
50:19 - again like if we want to change back to
50:22 - what we were doing before yeah but also
50:26 - I think the class ends now yes so now
50:34 - it's 6:45
50:35 - so sorry to take up your time but yeah
50:40 - next lesson we can work on the other
50:43 - timer and then we will move on to like
50:46 - the next topic switch so I think some of
50:52 - the stuff is new like I was saying like
50:54 - tiles and things so those are in the
50:58 - coming weeks so like there's things like
51:03 - the timer and then like using advance
51:07 - lists and dictionaries but I think you
51:09 - kind of mentioned them if you've done
51:12 - them we can move on to like writing
51:13 - thing to fun like writing Python stuff
51:16 - to files and things like that so we'll
51:19 - just continue like doing new concepts
51:21 - and as I go through these like just let
51:23 - me know if you have done them before or
51:25 - not but yeah we'll start off with the
51:29 - chicken cackling ticking clock sorry
51:32 - next but other than that did you have
51:37 - any questions um not really was
51:44 - everything we did today like okay Oh was
51:47 - it a bit nodes okay yeah I thought from
51:51 - like what you were saying before like
51:53 - next time you draw the line new stuff
51:55 - yeah it's okay yeah that's completely
51:58 - fine but yeah if I were to just quickly
52:04 - do this difficult work yes I think that
52:08 - could so just remember you'd have to
52:11 - change all of them
52:18 - I do see some logic errors in this but I
52:28 - think for now the main thing is just to
52:31 - get the program working yeah okay I can
52:47 - see the logic problem but it's working
52:50 - at least yeah thank you just doing it
52:55 - twice yeah yeah I consider the logic
52:58 - problem but yeah that's good that you
53:00 - saw that but at least you have like you
53:03 - know what the issue was
53:04 - yeah yeah if you didn't have any other
53:09 - questions I might yes a drummer yep next
53:13 - week we'll do the just let me know how
53:19 - the lesson goes as well next week thank
53:24 - have a good night you too
