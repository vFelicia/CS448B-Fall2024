00:00 - and then I'll share my screen let me
00:05 - join this tada what are we doing so I'll
00:11 - show you we're gonna make like I'll show
00:12 - you the game we're making one second so
00:16 - it's kind of revising pardon yeah so
00:24 - it's a bit like what we did last lesson
00:25 - so you know how we made a project last
00:28 - lesson which was you know it was like
00:31 - the wandering turtle right that moved up
00:33 - and now we're gonna be just doing
00:36 - something similar but I'll show you
00:38 - it's called geometry turtle it's just
00:43 - asking how many shapes we'll how many
00:46 - sides will the shape have and then if I
00:49 - say like three it'll make like a
00:53 - three-sided shape but like with the
00:56 - shape inside of every side as well if
00:58 - that makes sense and I'll open it this
01:01 - way so you can see it better so I kind
01:06 - of making geometric patterns using loops
01:11 - and things so it's gonna be like a bit
01:13 - of revision of what we learn all these
01:15 - last few lessons yeah so yeah so if it
01:20 - it's awesome how many sides will the
01:21 - shape have so if I say five it will do
01:27 - it like this so it's drawing a five
01:30 - sided shape but then it's you doing like
01:33 - many ones inside it as well pardon sorry
01:41 - yeah it's pretty cool and then if you
01:44 - make like let me run it again if you
01:48 - make it a bigger number maybe like eight
01:51 - or something go back to this I might get
01:57 - caught off the screen a bit maybe not
02:00 - but yeah it
02:02 - looks pretty cool the more shapes you
02:04 - have yeah so it's like making patterns
02:08 - and stuff okay cool yeah making patterns
02:13 - would be shapes so we'll get started
02:18 - close this so just oh sorry this is kind
02:28 - of like dang kind of thingy yeah
02:50 - and then it would like make that mini
02:57 - Express and then we get oh that's way
03:03 - cool sounds cool like get it like oh
03:14 - alright
03:15 - so is it safe that's a Python fun I'm
03:22 - not sure but I'll try to get it now okay
03:27 - if not it's a fair otherwise I can try
03:29 - help you at the end of the lesson to get
03:32 - it open if you want
03:33 - [Music]
03:45 - you sound a cold thing we're like what
03:51 - my dad did I am do you want to show me
03:56 - deal with him stop sharing and then you
04:00 - can show them if you want really quickly
04:10 - okay so that's the code he did okay so I
04:17 - think the code like that's copied from
04:20 - like you know how we have the Python
04:22 - shell like you can see the little arrows
04:26 - so that's copied from the Python shell I
04:28 - think so you could probably like get rid
04:31 - of those stuff and then you'd be able to
04:35 - run it cuz it has a like yeah it has a
04:39 - couple of things that are errors and
04:40 - stuff it was it was awful Oh trying
04:47 - again I'm pretty sure we did was change
04:51 - like these things to like oh yeah yeah
04:59 - because if this is Python then usually
05:02 - uses dots instead of those friended
05:05 - things but yeah I like with the other
05:18 - end s and stuff like that yeah yeah can
05:23 - i big computer are trying it again
05:33 - I am invalid syntax okay so I think one
05:54 - thing is maybe because it's on the shell
05:56 - you might have to do it line by line
05:58 - possibly oh because you have like do you
06:01 - see the bits of code that say like trace
06:04 - back and stuff you don't want to type
06:06 - that in because that's usually a message
06:09 - the shell gives you so maybe next time
06:13 - you try try do it without the style I
06:16 - see I don't see he's already put the
06:19 - dots I know I said that's actually not
06:22 - code that's like just when you type
06:25 - something and you get an error that's
06:27 - the thing you get so you're not me so um
06:31 - let me share my screen again to show you
06:33 - what I'm talking about um so I do can
06:39 - you see my screen yep yep so do you see
06:42 - like this is the Python shell and those
06:44 - three arrows is the shell if I type
06:47 - something wrong I get a message that
06:50 - looks like that so you're not actually
06:53 - meant to type this fit into your code
06:56 - cuz it's not really like it's not really
06:59 - any Python code it doesn't do anything
07:02 - so that's why you're getting invalid
07:05 - syntax so you might need to try to it
07:08 - line by line but yet will first work on
07:13 - this project and then in your if when
07:16 - you have time maybe you can try run that
07:18 - code but only use the lines that have
07:22 - this next to it just copy what's next to
07:24 - the three arrows does that make sense
07:29 - yep okay so we'll start with this
07:32 - project anyway let me just run it again
07:36 - one knows yet copy like the words that
07:44 - are next to the arrows but not there
07:46 - it's gotta be a lot of coping yeah
07:49 - Oh like you copy them and put them in a
07:53 - file like how we've been doing and then
07:55 - you can just run it once okay so if we
08:01 - now go back to this game the one we're
08:04 - working on what we want to do is we
08:08 - first want to just look at the project
08:11 - and break it up a bit so what are the
08:13 - different things that's happening in our
08:15 - project so as soon as I open it it asks
08:20 - us something and it sets up the turtle
08:27 - [Music]
08:30 - button yeah so it's similar to that so
08:40 - the first thing we need to do is like
08:41 - what we did last time we need to ask the
08:44 - player how many sides will the shape F
08:46 - mm and then save it maybe this is it is
08:54 - this the one from last we know the one
08:58 - that my dad did all right
09:16 - don't didn't work yeah okay so you might
09:20 - need to try it after class and see what
09:24 - husband
09:26 - pardon maybe typed and healthy hours it
09:31 - could be oh yeah this is why there could
09:35 - be something like a small error in the
09:38 - line of code which is why I like usually
09:41 - when we're writing our code we test it
09:43 - every time we make a change or we try to
09:45 - that way we can see where the error is
09:48 - but yeah I think what you're talking
09:52 - about is similar to the project we're
09:53 - doing today so maybe it might make more
09:57 - sense once you do this
09:59 - and you might get an idea yeah I got it
10:30 - oh hi sorry I think there was an issue
10:41 - with my internet so okay you will see
10:48 - those two okay let me share my screen
10:51 - again yeah for you
10:58 - yeah that's a bit annoying yeah cuz it
11:00 - just smiled Rob's out yeah and then the
11:03 - other person just looks like they're
11:04 - frozen yeah yeah okay so anyway back to
11:09 - this project the first thing we want to
11:11 - do is we want to ask how many sides will
11:15 - be shaped path and then remember so do
11:19 - you remember about like variables and
11:21 - stuff so we need to save it in a
11:23 - variable as well so that's another step
11:27 - we need to do and what type of variable
11:30 - will do you think we need to save this
11:33 - answer is like will it be a string or an
11:39 - integer string not exactly so it saves
11:48 - it as a string but we need to save it as
11:50 - a number so that's an integer so like
11:54 - because we're saying how many sides will
11:56 - the shape have we just want to type in a
11:58 - number so we want to save that value as
12:01 - a number in our code so let's start
12:05 - actually typing some code so just get
12:11 - Idol welcome so the first thing we need
12:18 - to do is whenever we're doing something
12:21 - with turtle what do we need to type in
12:25 - yep awesome make yep make sure you're in
12:30 - a new file so not in the Python shell
12:33 - make sure you get a new file yep
12:39 - because remember the shell-like does it
12:42 - one by one and doesn't save it but we
12:44 - want to be able to save that project yep
12:55 - exactly and then you can run it whenever
12:57 - you want as well so if you want to show
12:59 - people the cool shapes you made whatever
13:13 - name you caught which I just yep good
13:19 - kernel dot and capital T yep and the
13:26 - internal so that creates our turtle
13:29 - thing now what we need to do is we need
13:32 - to ask the user for input yeah yep so do
13:37 - you remember how to do that
13:40 - [Music]
13:46 - Oh David I'm sorry I'm that's okay so we
13:52 - just started I was just showing just a
13:55 - before the project and we just started
13:58 - coding it now so if you quickly open a
14:01 - new file you can just follow on from
14:05 - where we are
14:19 - I think I dropped out again so David I
14:22 - was just saying we just started a new
14:25 - project so if you want to open up a new
14:28 - file and just follow on from where we
14:31 - are the first two lines so what we're
14:34 - making is just like a shape a thing with
14:37 - turtle where you type in the number of
14:39 - sides it will draw and it will draw a
14:41 - cool shape like in a pattern style thing
14:44 - yep so yep
14:46 - we've just done these two lines so far
14:48 - and now what we want to do is we want to
14:51 - ask the user for some input because we
14:56 - want to ask how many sides will shape
14:58 - Pels so to do that we type in the word
15:03 - input so that with the brackets and
15:09 - inside that you put the quotation marks
15:13 - yep so that will kind of like ask the
15:16 - question so we need to type in our
15:18 - question sides
15:26 - how many sides so this input method is
15:43 - how we like write a question on the
15:45 - screen and then the person can type in
15:47 - something next to it so when you guys
15:57 - have these three lines of code done
16:00 - we'll just run it cuz we also have to
16:04 - save it so what if you press run and
16:07 - then run module you're just dead right
16:08 - oh don't run it right now okay yeah just
16:14 - tell that you to run it just so that you
16:17 - can save it as well as finishing time
16:22 - when you're finished I don't
16:27 - yeah so David we're just importing
16:31 - turtle and then creating our turtle cold
16:34 - Bob and now we're just asking the user
16:37 - how many sides with our shape have yep
16:39 - I'm done you're putting it where just
16:47 - okay cool
16:49 - that's good yeah it's good to have them
16:51 - in folders so that you know we're three
16:54 - I call it board of patent projects
16:57 - uh-huh nice that's a good name then you
17:01 - know where they all end all in one place
17:03 - and don't forget get refused because
17:06 - like I don't have to guess because it's
17:09 - like I think so I know yes time for
17:13 - drinks you know yeah exactly
17:17 - so this one is called geometry turtle
17:21 - but you can call it what you want as
17:24 - long as you know what the game is about
17:30 - [Music]
17:33 - it jumped ray or Gemma G natural geo
17:37 - geometry like GE m ET ry yeah I'm done
17:50 - you're done cool and then when once
17:53 - you've run it like saved it it should
17:55 - automatically like stop the program and
18:00 - then a Python shell should come up and
18:03 - ask you how many sides will shape F and
18:11 - then you should also see the Python
18:13 - turtles graphic the Python turtle
18:16 - graphics window open as well
18:27 - [Music]
18:31 - - did that work for everyone yeah yep no
18:35 - errors okay that's good so now what we
18:41 - need to do is we actually ask the
18:43 - question how many sides will the shape
18:45 - have but we never saved this answer
18:47 - anywhere so we have to save whatever the
18:50 - person typed in as a variable so do you
18:54 - guys remember how to make variables
18:56 - no just the new remember trying to I
19:03 - think I got it yeah
19:06 - like like a name like you gonna equals
19:22 - yep yeah so that's exactly right so we
19:27 - put in our variable name so we might
19:30 - call it side so this is like before the
19:34 - input before the word input we go sides
19:37 - equals and then we say sides equals this
19:42 - because what it's doing is it's saving
19:45 - whatever the user typed in as the answer
19:47 - into a variable call sign yep David have
19:56 - you done that not quite here - okay cool
20:03 - so do you guys know do you remember what
20:05 - a variable is so we've made a variable
20:08 - but you know why we use variable from
20:10 - why we have variable yes no is that
20:18 - saved into something yep pretty much
20:22 - so did that make them you've got to so
20:25 - did that make sense to you - David why
20:28 - we use variables yeah Adam you've done
20:33 - okay so now what we need to do is we
20:36 - need to do one more thing because do you
20:39 - remember how last week when we saved
20:43 - whatever the end
20:44 - was from this input thing into a
20:46 - variable it saved it as a string we want
20:51 - to make sure it's saved as a number or
20:53 - as an integer so what we need to do is
20:58 - we need to save this answer but convert
21:02 - it into an integer so do you remember
21:04 - how we did this line of code which was
21:07 - like int and in the brackets and then
21:09 - something inside oh yeah yep so we want
21:17 - to put it in front of this so type in
21:22 - the word int and then put one bracket
21:25 - like the opening bracket before the word
21:29 - input and then the closing bracket next
21:31 - to that other bracket on the end yep
21:36 - so what this is doing is it saving
21:39 - whatever the input is whatever the
21:42 - person typed in as an integer as a
21:45 - number and we're saving the whole thing
21:48 - into a variable called sides so does
22:07 - that make sense ever yep yep yeah yeah
22:10 - okay so I'll just get you guys to run it
22:13 - just to check that you don't have any
22:15 - errors or anything okay mm-hmm so it
22:22 - should still just ask you how many sides
22:24 - will the shape have and then it won't do
22:27 - anything after that but yeah just so
22:32 - it's working
22:33 - yep okay cool Justin did that work for
22:38 - you as well yeah it doesn't do anything
22:43 - but yeah yeah I think that's how it
22:48 - works as long as it doesn't give you any
22:51 - error like anything saying like trace
22:53 - back or something in red text then
22:55 - that's good okay
22:58 - wouldn't cool so now we'll go back to
23:01 - our code the next thing we want to do is
23:05 - let me run the program again so that you
23:08 - guys can see because we're drawing one
23:13 - shape but we keep drawing it over and
23:15 - over so let me so it's asking how many
23:27 - sides will the shape have and if I type
23:29 - in like five it's during a five sided
23:35 - shape five times so do you guys remember
23:40 - how to repeat bits of code we can use
23:44 - something like I can use something yep a
23:47 - look yeah yes so that's what we need to
23:50 - do we need to make something called a
23:52 - full loop so do you remember what the
23:55 - full lips do I think I repeat things
24:01 - that you want them to repeat four times
24:07 - yeah so it repeats whatever code like
24:10 - you want it to repeat however many times
24:13 - you tell it yeah well that's the second
24:21 - part say type in the word for oh yeah
24:24 - yep oh yeah they type in the word full
24:27 - and then you type in I so I is just kind
24:31 - of like we use it as like a counter to
24:33 - just count each step of the loop and
24:36 - then you type in in a yep so I am yeah
24:44 - in with something and then because we
24:47 - wanted to do something a certain amount
24:49 - of times so if a person types in three
24:52 - you want it to do it three times
24:55 - sometimes it five you want it to do it
24:58 - five times so what can we use that's in
25:02 - our code here that remembers what the
25:04 - user typed in what can we use as like a
25:07 - current counter the inch
25:11 - and yet the end but this side of the int
25:15 - so we want to use that variable cold
25:17 - sides the sides is whatever the user
25:21 - typed in like however many times
25:23 - aha yeah however much sides at once the
25:27 - drill which means however many times we
25:29 - want to draw a bat shape so go far I in
25:32 - but we want to type the word range and
25:36 - then type in sides brackets get brackets
25:42 - it's a range and then brackets
25:44 - side and then that colon thing to the
25:51 - dot two dots so do you guys remember
25:56 - what range does yep you think so what do
26:02 - you think it does David but that's okay
26:15 - so if I think it it like makes it like
26:20 - say and repeat yep kind of so it kind of
26:26 - its kind of the answers kind of in the
26:29 - word so it's like a range so it kind of
26:31 - gives you a range from one two and
26:34 - whatever number you put in here so we
26:36 - put inside so sides is a variable but
26:40 - it's counting a number so if the user
26:42 - types in five then it'll go like five
26:46 - times it's like one two three four five
26:50 - so it's just yeah basically saying the
26:53 - range of like one to five like to keep
26:56 - to make sure that it goes in the loop so
27:00 - now what we want to do is in the loop to
27:04 - make sure after you type in sides and
27:06 - then that : I'll semicolon you press
27:10 - ENTER and then you should be tabbed in
27:12 - so you have a bit of space here yep so
27:17 - now we actually want to draw our we
27:20 - start drawing our shape so the first
27:23 - thing we want to do is we want to make
27:24 - it go forward a bit
27:25 - so what will we type in Oh food
27:30 - yep forward do we need anything else
27:33 - brackets maybe bracket yep we also might
27:38 - need this Bob got full and then put in
27:44 - the brackets and then we need to put a
27:51 - number in the bracket so I might just
27:54 - say a hundred or something cuz this
27:57 - number will always be the same because
27:59 - we just want all the sides to have the
28:01 - same length yeah so a hundred might be a
28:05 - good number we can change it later if we
28:07 - want but we'll see how it goes and now
28:12 - what we need to do is we need to turn
28:14 - because we need a draw go forward and
28:18 - then turn however many times to draw the
28:20 - next side of the shape but do you
28:23 - remember how we did that square activity
28:25 - a couple of lessons ago yeah yeah how
28:29 - many degrees that we have to turn for
28:31 - that square 90 90 yeah and do you know
28:36 - how you know that like how you got the
28:39 - number 90 yes because it's 90 degrees
28:43 - yeah but do you know why it's 90 degrees
28:47 - I'm not like a hundred degrees or
28:48 - something else like that is not because
28:51 - ninety degrees is like is like an angles
28:55 - at our kinks I can say take a manly
29:00 - shirt me and sure yeah you on unsure
29:07 - know you just change turns videochat on
29:11 - because all right okay yeah so basically
29:16 - because when we're drawing a square we
29:19 - have four sides so the angle needs to be
29:22 - divided by four full mm so if I just get
29:27 - up a calculator do you know how many
29:29 - degrees there isn't a full circle
29:36 - does anyone know how many degrees so if
29:41 - you want to like turn completely do you
29:43 - know how many degrees it is so like if
29:45 - 90 is up there puttan Oh like 360 is
29:52 - that what you said yep so it is 360 so
29:58 - like with the square we want to like
30:01 - turn an equal amount of times and we
30:03 - know that there's four sides with a
30:05 - square so if you type in 360 divided by
30:09 - four you get 90 so that's why it's 90
30:13 - degrees when we turn each side to draw a
30:15 - square and then if it's like a triangle
30:19 - or something you can go 360 divided by
30:21 - three cuz triangles have three sides
30:24 - when you get a hundred and twenty yep so
30:28 - that's how it divided like calculate how
30:31 - many sides we want to turn but in our
30:34 - program we don't know how many sides the
30:39 - shape will have until the person tells
30:41 - us how many sides it will have so what
30:45 - we need to do underneath here so back up
30:49 - here then underneath side we want to
30:51 - make another variable called angle hey
30:56 - Angie a little equals and this variable
31:04 - will calculate how many cows all we need
31:07 - a turn to draw the shape to drill
31:10 - whatever shape the person is telling us
31:12 - to drill so does that make sense so like
31:17 - because we don't know like we don't know
31:20 - if we're making a square or triangle or
31:22 - what we have to do the calculation in
31:24 - the code over here so we have to say
31:27 - angle equals 360 and then does anyone
31:32 - remember what the / sign is on a
31:34 - computer yes yes which one is it it's
31:39 - that good - hold it - you're kind of
31:41 - looking called it so that's the star
31:45 - thing is x
31:48 - so oh yes oh yeah
31:53 - so it's like it's social no looking
31:56 - thing is many times the yeah they're
32:02 - like starting like near the number eight
32:04 - yeah so that's times but to divide by
32:07 - Alban on number nine oh okay on my one
32:12 - it's on number eight but it might be
32:15 - different yeah
32:17 - so what we want to do is we want to say
32:19 - 360 divided by the number of sides so
32:24 - what do we need to put in here after the
32:28 - divided by seven how like what can we
32:32 - use in our code that tells us the amount
32:34 - of sides this shape will have can anyone
32:41 - tell me so we need to go 360 divided by
32:48 - the amount of sides the shape will have
32:52 - so what's something that we saved in our
32:55 - code that remembers the amount of side
32:58 - the shape will have range close so it's
33:08 - in that range thing int yep the Imps but
33:13 - this side of the int again yes so we
33:16 - just want them we just want that
33:19 - variable names of sides so what this is
33:24 - saying is for example if it asks how
33:26 - many sides will the shape have and I
33:28 - type in five the next calculation will
33:32 - be 360 divided by five so then it
33:36 - already calculated that angle for us
33:39 - does that make sense yeah yep
33:43 - okay so now if we go back into our loop
33:45 - so if you just click at the end of this
33:48 - bob forward line and press enter
33:51 - make sure you are still in your loop so
33:54 - make sure you're still tabbed in by up
33:57 - now we actually want to turn our cursor
34:01 - like we want to turn
34:02 - turtle whatever angle this is so what
34:07 - line of code will we have to write angle
34:12 - almost so angle goes in the brackets do
34:16 - you know what we put the full the
34:18 - brackets so to turn to a side the turn
34:23 - left or right or left mm-hmm yep Bob the
34:30 - less line yep
34:32 - Oh Bob the right so we'll use Bob left
34:35 - and then you have the brackets and then
34:40 - inside your brackets that's where you
34:41 - put angle so it's saying what this loop
34:47 - is saying is it saying for however many
34:49 - sides there is we want to move forward a
34:53 - hundred steps and then we want to turn
34:54 - left whatever angle it is and then move
34:57 - forward and then turn move forward turn
35:00 - so for example if we wanted to draw a
35:03 - square when we ran the program it would
35:06 - ask us how many sides will the shape
35:08 - have so we type in the number four and
35:11 - then what this loop here will do is it
35:15 - will do it will move forward 100 steps
35:18 - turn 90 degrees and then do that four
35:21 - times it's a battle drill square can you
35:25 - run it good enough so you can run it now
35:28 - and see what happens okay how many
35:36 - charge will our shape have for sure look
35:46 - it says so like can I just restart it
35:54 - yeah I'll just restart it and see you
35:56 - finish okay you can restart it and see
35:58 - if you get the error in chess the videos
36:03 - work yeah yeah you got an air as well
36:06 - okay yeah everyone oh okay what yeah
36:11 - I'll go one at a time so David do you
36:14 - wanna
36:15 - read out your error or doing what does
36:19 - your essay actually I'll get you to
36:20 - share your screen so I'll stop sharing
36:22 - mine so could you please share your
36:24 - screen
36:25 - oh yeah sure sure so I think yep
36:37 - my possum screen is it so okay so you
36:42 - actually day doesn't it doesn't sure yet
36:46 - you might need to share this our cell
36:47 - screen screen yes a screen sure cool
36:57 - there so this is my turtle and here's my
37:03 - error every name is not defined
37:07 - oh that's fine I can't see it thank you
37:11 - so if you go back into your code so it's
37:13 - saying name error the name angle is not
37:16 - defined so that means if we look back at
37:20 - your code it can't find like a variable
37:24 - called angle so you might as well sit oh
37:27 - yeah so you used angle down there in the
37:31 - me dot left but if you go up you see on
37:34 - the sides you have the word like the
37:37 - letters a GE le it's a better meant to
37:40 - say angle so that's us like setting up
37:43 - the variable angle and then yeah I think
37:48 - I just right yep so Chester was your
37:53 - arrow something different
37:58 - Chester gonna do you wanna share your
38:07 - screen so that I can see what how are
38:10 - you opening yeah I did it you did it and
38:14 - it did it work David yeah yep okay cool
38:17 - you can while you're waiting like test
38:20 - it with like different numbers like
38:22 - three or five or whatever and see the
38:24 - different shapes it can make oh I think
38:27 - you can make any different shapes just
38:29 - see
38:29 - kid is just gonna draw a square if I do
38:32 - ten Oh
38:33 - so you can try than see okay so it
38:37 - doesn't do square that's nice so I'm
38:42 - gonna do a thousand so Chester and that
38:47 - era you're getting is it's saying name
38:49 - forward is not defined so if you go into
38:53 - your code do you see how you just have
38:56 - the word forward and brackets a hundred
38:59 - yeah
39:00 - you have to write Bob dot forward so
39:03 - that it knows like because the dot
39:05 - forward function is part of the turtle
39:08 - thing and Bob is our turtle because
39:12 - otherwise yeah you have to type in the
39:15 - word Bob Wow yep
39:30 - now try it Chester pretty big shape hmm
39:54 - yeah so when you do a hundred mm-hmm it
39:57 - does a circle a really big circle so you
40:00 - can see it yeah so I'll just do ten is a
40:06 - really good shape and let me try sir
40:10 - Tate
40:11 - yeah search is still out uh yeah that's
40:15 - right
40:16 - yes our 10 is average the average okay
40:20 - what we can do is we can actually do you
40:24 - see how when we run our program the
40:26 - cursor starts in the middle of the
40:27 - screen you can actually make it like go
40:30 - down a bit so that it starts like on the
40:34 - bottom left or something on the bottom
40:36 - so that it has more space to draw the
40:38 - shape so we can make it move down so
40:42 - I'll show you guys how to do that yeah
40:44 - um so let me share my screen so can
40:52 - everyone see my screen again yep yep
40:55 - okay so what we want to do before all
40:59 - this I'll do it down here unchanged this
41:03 - thing 290 shape oh cool that's pretty
41:10 - cool yep so what we want to do is right
41:15 - underneath way type bub is equal to
41:17 - turtle turtle we want to move before
41:20 - like starting anything we just want to
41:22 - move the cursor down to the bottom of it
41:24 - so we want to make it go down a bit so
41:28 - to do that we first have to face the
41:30 - bottom so does anyone know what angle
41:33 - like how much we might need a turn I
41:38 - think it's so it's I think no so I think
41:56 - Chester was on the right track wet so if
42:00 - 90 is like that we want to go 90 like 3
42:04 - times 1 2 3
42:06 - yes so it's 120 120 so I know it's
42:11 - actually so if you type in 90 plus 90
42:14 - plus 90 I think it's 270 oh that's 270
42:21 - so we want to turn to the left
42:24 - 270 degrees so just type in Bob dot left
42:31 - and then 270
42:37 - so that just faces it down but now we
42:40 - actually want to make it move down a bit
42:42 - so now we can go bulk forward to make it
42:46 - go straight and then I might go 150 when
42:54 - I might even go 200 so that so it starts
42:59 - in the middle but we faced it down and
43:01 - we went down 200 and then what we want
43:05 - to do is we just want to make sure that
43:06 - it starts back at this point here
43:09 - because this is where it normally starts
43:11 - so we just want to turn left one more
43:13 - time because right now we're facing this
43:15 - way you want to turn that 90 degrees
43:18 - Bob your left mm-hmm
43:23 - and then how much degrees not yep yep
43:26 - because we went like three 90s we want
43:30 - to just got one more 90 to bring it back
43:33 - yep so oh but you guys just quickly run
43:37 - that it might drill a line but I'll show
43:41 - you how to get rid of that also okay
43:45 - let's see but it should be like now
43:50 - before you it asks a question it should
43:53 - the cursor should have drawn a line down
43:55 - and then it's on the bottom yep but do
43:59 - you see how I drew a line we don't want
44:02 - you draw a line but um I'm actually okay
44:06 - was it because it looks kind of cute oh
44:08 - it was kind of cute okay yeah cuz then
44:12 - you can draw your shapes but I'll show
44:18 - you guys how to do it without a line so
44:20 - if you want the line there you can keep
44:23 - it but I'll just show you how to do it
44:25 - without so if you just close just again
44:29 - and go back to your code there's
44:31 - something called pen up and pinned down
44:33 - with turtle so what that means is if you
44:38 - put the pen up then if you stop drawing
44:40 - and then if you put the pen down you
44:41 - start drawing again so before we go down
44:45 - like before we draw that line that goes
44:47 - down we want to put the
44:49 - up so what we do is with a bob dot P and
44:54 - you saw a pen up so what this line of
45:01 - code does is it means we're telling it
45:03 - stop drawing and it still moves but it's
45:07 - not drawing anything on the screen does
45:11 - that make sense so far David and Chester
45:15 - yep yep so then what we want to do after
45:19 - we've moved down because we want it to
45:21 - draw off that we put the pen down there
45:25 - we go
45:25 - Bob don't pin down yep so what it's
45:31 - saying is don't draw anything and we
45:34 - just want to move down and face this way
45:36 - and now start drawing so you can run
45:40 - that and see what happens
45:43 - how do you get it to like do what you
45:46 - did so like this thing to move to the
45:53 - bottom all you mean like the extra shape
45:56 - things yeah yeah we'll do that next so
46:01 - if you just read it worked it was yeah
46:05 - so if you just run a bit of code to see
46:07 - if it works so we were just moving the
46:10 - cursor down a bit I don't mind being
46:16 - like I don't mind it being okay you
46:20 - don't mind it being upwards okay well
46:22 - that's okay as long as you understand do
46:25 - you understand how to just make the
46:26 - cursor moves to a different spot without
46:29 - having it draw yeah does it make sense
46:32 - okay so now we'll go on to the next bit
46:36 - of the program cuz right now it just
46:38 - drools like one shape but we want it to
46:40 - make like a cool pattern like shape yeah
46:43 - so I'm just going to show you guys
46:48 - something for now I might do it in a new
46:52 - Python thing so right now we have one
46:57 - loop like one full loop but what you can
46:59 - do is you can have a full loop inside
47:02 - another full
47:04 - so I'll show it so that it makes sense
47:09 - there your finish my thousand fitness it
47:13 - cool yeah I finished my shares and it
47:17 - was really long that's really long okay
47:22 - so what I'm doing is I'm just making
47:26 - another file just to quickly show you
47:29 - guys what a full loop looks like and
47:32 - then what a full loop inside another
47:34 - full loop looks like so that's called a
47:37 - nested loop so for example if we go for
47:40 - I in range full well don't forward 10 so
47:53 - I'll show you what this the distance and
47:55 - then I'll show you what it does with
47:57 - them not the loop inside it so how sorry
48:00 - what were you saying Justin I made two
48:06 - million two million well that's all just
48:12 - gonna take you like forever yeah that's
48:16 - gonna be a long line so with this with
48:25 - this code that I have on my screen right
48:27 - now how many pixels will bub move can
48:33 - anyone tell me so sure and so you can
48:38 - just look on my screen for now so I just
48:42 - want everyone looking on my screen for
48:44 - now yeah
48:46 - so with this like bit of code that I
48:49 - have here how many pixels do you think
48:51 - Bob will move so if like 10 is pixels 10
48:58 - pixels how far do you think it will go
49:01 - so it's in a loop with the range of 4 so
49:07 - we'll go 40 pictures yeah exactly
49:10 - so it will go 40 pixels but if we
49:13 - this so inside that loop if I have
49:18 - another loop do you know how many pixels
49:28 - it will move now can anyone tell me I'll
49:43 - have the yes I think I do yep so you can
49:50 - just guess it's gonna be 80 pixels
49:54 - 80 pixels or just I told you almost not
49:59 - exactly a B so I'll quickly explain it
50:01 - so 81 if a bit more than 80 so when we
50:08 - just have one loop moving forward 10
50:11 - pickles we repeat that four times so
50:13 - that becomes four new pixels when we
50:16 - have two loops like the code does this
50:20 - line of code then it does this then when
50:23 - it reaches the loop it does the one
50:25 - inside like the inside most loop first
50:28 - so it does this four times so that means
50:33 - it's moved 40 pixels and then it goes
50:37 - back and does this outside loop so it
50:40 - moves 40 pixels four times plus another
50:47 - 10 pixels out there I'll show you how it
50:51 - looks that it makes a bit of sense
51:03 - nested so what it does is it like runs
51:08 - the whole way and does the inner loop
51:11 - first so okay I'll show you what it does
51:16 - with that this is how much Bob moves
51:22 - when you have like a loop inside a loop
51:24 - that's moving ten
51:27 - and then this is how much Bob would move
51:29 - if it was just for any pencils so do you
51:39 - see how the line is so much smaller yep
51:45 - so it kind of does like I'm pretty sure
51:47 - it does so usually with one loop it
51:50 - would do 40 but we're doing that one
51:53 - loop again another 40 times so it's like
51:56 - 40 times not 40 40 times 4 which is 160
52:03 - but we also have where did it go
52:10 - we also have this thing that happens so
52:13 - that's another 40 pixels added on that
52:16 - so it makes it 200 pixels it's a bit
52:21 - confusing but does it kind of make sense
52:24 - to you guys yeah yeah does it make sense
52:31 - to you David so it's a bit confusing but
52:36 - like I'll show you again if I run it so
52:40 - this is just one loop and we're making
52:43 - Bob move forward 10 pixels so it just
52:50 - moves this much which is 40 pixels but
52:53 - if we put that inside another loop I'm
52:59 - just gonna take away this line because
53:01 - that's a bit confusing so we're putting
53:04 - this in another loop we run it and then
53:15 - it does a bigger line so what that is
53:18 - doing is because it's a loop inside of a
53:22 - loop it does this 40 bit first because
53:25 - you know 4 times 10 is 40 10 20 30 40 so
53:30 - it does this little one first and then
53:33 - it does the big one so it goes like
53:37 - forty times four and that's how we get
53:41 - 160 and we get that bigger line does
53:45 - that kind of make sense
53:49 - yeah bit confused
53:51 - let's try do another example um so we'll
53:57 - just do it with a variable so we'll go X
53:59 - is equal to zero so X is just a little
54:03 - counter we're making so if we go X is
54:08 - equal to X plus one and then inside here
54:18 - we go X is equal to X plus one can
54:23 - someone try have a guesses what X will
54:26 - be at the end of this so X starts at 0
54:37 - and then this just means add one on to
54:40 - whatever X is 8 - 8 so David do you have
54:49 - a guess what one it might be I think
54:59 - it's gonna be two - okay George
55:06 - - X so let me explain it like step by
55:10 - step so at the beginning X is zero so
55:13 - it's like starts at zero and now we have
55:15 - this loop which is saying like repeat it
55:18 - four times and all this line of code is
55:21 - saying is it's just saying X like add
55:23 - one on to X
55:25 - shall we start here X is zero by the
55:29 - time we get to this line X is now 1 and
55:33 - now when we get into this loop it's
55:36 - saying repeat this bit four times again
55:39 - so now we repeat it so X is now we will
55:43 - feed it four times so we add on four
55:45 - there we go X is now two three four five
55:51 - and now we do this again X is mount one
55:54 - like we add one on so it's six again and
55:58 - then we get to this line and then you
56:00 - repeat it four times let me go back to
56:03 - the outer one and do each step and then
56:06 - go in here and then you do this step so
56:09 - you kind of have to start with the
56:11 - outside loop and then do the inside loop
56:14 - first so I'm gonna get rid of this line
56:18 - because it might be a bit confusing
56:21 - first but okay if you saw this bit of
56:27 - code what do you think X will be here
56:32 - cool yep exactly it will be full but now
56:36 - if we put that loop inside another loop
56:40 - so this little bit means X is four but
56:44 - we have to do this little bit four times
56:47 - again because it's in another loop so if
56:51 - we're doing this little bit of code four
56:55 - times again what number will it be can
57:02 - anyone tell me so let me get rid of this
57:10 - again so you guys you on all times
57:14 - [Music]
57:15 - yeah eight so it would be four times
57:21 - four so that won't be a that will be 16
57:28 - pretty sure so we can get a calculator
57:30 - up to check so we go full time full and
57:35 - it's 16 yep so I'll go through it again
57:40 - with a different number so if we just
57:44 - have this loop it will be full does that
57:47 - make sense to everyone why it's full
57:48 - yeah yeah yeah okay so now if we put
57:52 - this loop so this is already a loop if
57:55 - we put it in another loop but this time
57:58 - if I make it 5 we need to have whatever
58:04 - so this is repeating five times again so
58:09 - the answer for this is full but we need
58:12 - to repeat this whole block of code five
58:15 - times again so do you know what the
58:18 - answer would be mmm no not really not
58:24 - really so if you exactly so it will be
58:30 - four times five which makes X at the end
58:33 - of it 20 so the reason for that is this
58:38 - little bit of code here it makes like it
58:42 - repeats at four times so it just means X
58:44 - is full and then this what this code is
58:48 - doing is it's telling us to repeat this
58:52 - whole block of code another five times
58:54 - so a four times five equals 20
58:57 - so this is kind of the same as saying X
59:01 - is equal to X plus full thread David if
59:07 - you saw this bit of code what do you
59:09 - think the answer would be like what
59:11 - would X be at the end of it you know
59:21 - so X starts at zero and then we're just
59:24 - adding full on to whatever X is so X is
59:28 - equal to four and then eight but we
59:30 - repeat that five times so it's full
59:33 - times five which means it's 20 yes so
59:39 - this is the same as doing this kind of
59:44 - doing it like in a bit of a different
59:46 - way but basically when you put a like
59:49 - full loop inside another loop let's go
59:52 - the nested loop it does like it repeats
59:55 - the calculation like it repeats the
59:57 - inner loop first and then it goes back
60:00 - and does the outer loop and repeats the
60:02 - inner loop again yeah okay so it kind of
60:06 - like it does this loop however many
60:09 - times you tell it in here but then
60:12 - whatever the answer is from that loop it
60:14 - does it this many times
60:18 - so this loop it's just adding one on to
60:21 - X so X is equal to zero now it's equal
60:24 - to one then you loop again to three pull
60:29 - and then it's four so then you repeat
60:35 - whatever the answer was for five times
60:43 - so if I change the number like if this
60:47 - was tooth does anyone know what the
60:50 - answer might be so you first calculate
60:58 - the smaller loop what's the answer of
61:00 - this so this inner loop runs four times
61:14 - so adding one or two X we get one two
61:18 - three four and now the outer loop runs
61:22 - two times so you get this calculation
61:26 - which is full and we time we do it twice
61:29 - so every times a by 2 so 4 plus four is
61:34 - equal to eight yeah
61:37 - yes does it kind of make sense it's a
61:39 - bit confusing but we'll go over it next
61:43 - lesson again because we just need to add
