00:00 - hmm and you might just see a little
00:01 - thing saying recording from the top yes
00:05 - yep okay so I might share my screen now
00:08 - and we'll get started okay so does
00:17 - everyone have idle open yeah yep okay
00:22 - cool
00:24 - so today we're gonna be playing around
00:27 - with something cold turtle so I don't
00:29 - know if you remember you know how last
00:31 - week I showed you some of the games
00:32 - where it draws stops yeah dream
00:35 - that's what uses turtle like that's how
00:39 - it draws the stuff on the screen it uses
00:41 - something called turtle so my dad told
00:44 - me about that
00:45 - oh really already that's good yeah so
00:52 - I'll just get it open and to show you an
00:55 - example again I think he uses it how he
00:59 - uses turtle like the dots you know if
01:06 - these actually our lesson ducks so it's
01:11 - just like whatever us shooters have
01:13 - access to oh because those are asset
01:17 - that we we can have a copy of that oh
01:19 - really yeah
01:21 - I'll double check with them and like I
01:23 - could get her to send it yeah because
01:25 - that's what I want to I want to do like
01:27 - what I want to know what we cover each
01:29 - lesson because right yep yeah intersects
01:32 - you're providing with the less than what
01:37 - we actually learn and cover so we we can
01:39 - we can cross-reference it back if we
01:41 - let's say we want to this oh yeah yeah
01:44 - I'll message her and double check and
01:47 - then I'll get her to contact you and
01:49 - like just remind her to send that to you
01:52 - all right give me a second my computer's
01:55 - being a bit so okay well I'm waiting
01:58 - I'll just get Idol open is your idol
02:03 - open quarry
02:10 - and just double-check that you can see
02:12 - my screen and idle is well once and
02:16 - you'll I don't I mean I'm just gonna
02:21 - stop sharing and I'll just open it and
02:23 - share again cuz wasn't working properly
02:28 - so give me a second and I'll just show
02:43 - you the type of program you can make
02:45 - with cuddle again so let me just share
02:49 - my screen okay can you guys see my
03:02 - screen again yeah history yep okay cool
03:05 - so just keep idle open and I'll just
03:08 - quickly show you again what turtle does
03:11 - so you can do a few things with um
03:14 - turtle and Python but this is just an
03:17 - example of a program I showed you guys
03:19 - in the first week but I'll just show you
03:21 - again so you know what you're doing
03:26 - so it basically allows you to draw
03:29 - graphics on the screen so once this
03:33 - loads okay
03:39 - so this is where it asks how many shapes
03:42 - were how many sides will the shape have
03:44 - and if I just say cool it draws it on
03:49 - the screen so the thing like that hat is
03:53 - actually drawing the lines and stuff is
03:55 - something cold like it's using a library
03:58 - cold turtle and this is the kind of code
04:01 - but I'll just stop that for now and
04:04 - we'll actually get into it and then
04:06 - it'll make more sense so I might just
04:11 - okay can you guys see my screen in your
04:14 - screen okay yep it's the size affairs oh
04:18 - yeah yeah okay
04:20 - yep yep okay so yeah as I was saying
04:24 - before turtle is something called a
04:27 - library so has anyone heard of a library
04:30 - with programming languages no no okay
04:34 - that's okay so it's basically it's like
04:37 - a bunch of code that someone else has
04:39 - done and then we can use it so like
04:41 - they've already made some code that does
04:44 - different sort of stuff so in this case
04:46 - it drills things on the screen so
04:48 - they've done it and made it easy for us
04:50 - so all we need to do is just use like
04:53 - certain functions functions kind of just
04:57 - use bits of like other bits of code that
05:00 - are already set so we can use those
05:02 - functions to do things so it'll make a
05:05 - bit more sense when I when I show you so
05:08 - the fun I'd be practicing you've been
05:10 - practicing
05:11 - okay that's good have you been
05:13 - practicing with total at all no no okay
05:17 - that's okay so it's good to practice as
05:20 - well so I'll first introduce turtle and
05:23 - then we might use some of the stuff we
05:25 - did last week as well okay the first
05:27 - thing we need to do is whenever were
05:29 - using a library that is made like that's
05:34 - already made we have to import it so
05:36 - make sure you guys are just in Python
05:39 - shell right now yep yep so the ones with
05:42 - the three islands so you just need to
05:46 - type input turtle so what that does is
05:52 - it allows us so it imports everything we
05:55 - need to use this turtle library and then
05:58 - we can actually use the functions in it
06:00 - so if we didn't import it we wouldn't be
06:03 - able to use the things that make it draw
06:06 - on the screen so once you've done that
06:09 - line just press ENTER and then it
06:12 - doesn't look like it's done anything but
06:15 - that's okay it's done it in the
06:16 - background and now what we want is we
06:19 - want to create an actual turtle so a
06:22 - turtle is like this little cursor thing
06:25 - if you look back from the screen it's
06:28 - the cursor but sorry
06:31 - it's the cursor that actually drills
06:34 - stuff on the screen here so like right
06:38 - now it's just this little arrow so the
06:42 - turtle like we can make the turtle move
06:44 - up down and like change color and stuff
06:47 - but it's the main thing that controls
06:49 - the lines that were drawing so what we
06:52 - need to do is we need to actually make
06:54 - our turtle so we can give it a name so
06:58 - do you remember how last time we went
07:00 - into variables yeah it's a bit like a
07:03 - variable so what we're like I might so
07:07 - what do we go like total equals
07:10 - something yeah exactly but instead of
07:13 - turtle you can call it anything so you
07:15 - can call it turtle or you could call it
07:17 - like you could give it a name so like I
07:19 - make a bub is equal to so you can just
07:24 - give it any name and now what we need to
07:26 - do is we need to go turtle lowercase dot
07:31 - and then uppercase T u are key le so you
07:37 - might see some stuff as you're typing do
07:40 - you guys get a drop-down box as well
07:42 - wait so did you see the drop-down box
08:06 - really it doesn't show you that's okay
08:10 - it might come up if you press shift the
08:17 - as you're typing if you press shift on
08:20 - your keyboard oh sorry
08:21 - tab on your keyboard tap tab that's
08:25 - above don't make it total yeah so it
08:29 - like finishes off the word you're typing
08:31 - so that's another thing that Idol has
08:34 - here like it kind of knows some of the
08:37 - functions that you're trying to type so
08:41 - it'll try finish it off yeah gave me the
08:45 - right one any other way
08:47 - you do need to do yep
08:52 - so after if not you can always just type
08:56 - it you don't have to press tab and
08:58 - finish it off you can just type it
09:00 - yourself the tab thing just make sure
09:04 - like that use you've said like type the
09:08 - right word with the right spelling and
09:09 - stuff but it doesn't matter too much and
09:13 - then after this line you just want to
09:16 - put an open and close brackets good yep
09:21 - so what this is doing it's creating a
09:23 - variable called Bob and Bob is like it's
09:27 - kind of like a little robot that draws
09:29 - on the screen so that's using turtle so
09:33 - what it's doing is it's calling this
09:37 - method called turtle so a method if you
09:41 - hear me use the word method or function
09:43 - they're pretty much the same thing so
09:47 - it's pretty much like some code that was
09:49 - written somewhere else that you're
09:51 - reusing again that kind of makes it yeah
09:56 - yep so a library is like a whole bunch
09:59 - of code that we're taking from somewhere
10:01 - else so that might have lots of methods
10:04 - in it but a method is just one bit of
10:06 - code that does one thing so like in this
10:10 - case it's kind of just like setting up
10:12 - outer toe okay yeah okay so once you've
10:17 - done that just press ENTER and another
10:21 - screen might have opened up yeah yep so
10:25 - that's kind of like it like this
10:27 - unexpected indent unexpected indent so
10:31 - if you have a space somewhere an extra
10:37 - space at the end or maybe like in
10:39 - between the . no I don't need much space
10:42 - anywhere exactly how you typed it
10:46 - exactly how I type it okay maybe just
10:50 - try type it again and see
10:53 - so sometimes python is a bit picky and
10:58 - indent means like it's either been
11:00 - tabbed in a bit or like there's some
11:03 - space an issue that confuses just try
11:09 - type it again while we're waiting I'll
11:39 - just quickly send a message to the other
11:41 - students
11:42 - yeah yep okay cool so um I'll just
11:49 - quickly explain again the bob equals you
11:53 - guys get that right that's like the
11:54 - variable they're equal to and then the
11:57 - reason why we go turtle turtle is
12:01 - because this function turtle with the
12:04 - capital t yes from this library called
12:08 - turtle with your lowercase t so the dot
12:12 - just means like it's part of that we're
12:15 - using the function from that library if
12:18 - that kind of makes sense yeah yep okay
12:21 - so once you've typed that line of code
12:23 - you should get this window that is
12:26 - Python turtle graphics yeah this is
12:29 - where it'll actually draw the stuff so
12:31 - the little cursor like the arrow that
12:33 - you see yeah our turtle so that's a Bob
12:37 - or whatever you guys called yours so now
12:40 - we can actually make it do stuff like
12:42 - move around and draw on the screen if
12:45 - you go back into shell so don't close
12:48 - this window just go back into shell and
12:52 - what we can do is we can make Bob go
12:55 - forward so we can type Bob and then dot
13:00 - and then the word forward
13:06 - and then the circle brackets so open and
13:11 - close the brackets and then inside the
13:15 - brackets we can put a number so that
13:18 - just says like how much Bob should move
13:21 - forward so like I might put 10 I think
13:25 - I'm pretty sure that's in pixels so it
13:28 - will move 10 pixels so you could make it
13:31 - a bigger number like 100 or 50 or
13:34 - something it's up to you
13:36 - so basically okay the number it just
13:39 - determines like how long you want it to
13:41 - go forward for and this time do you know
13:47 - why we have the dot here so now we have
13:50 - Bob dot forward does anyone have an
13:55 - identity pardon sir cuz when we did
14:00 - Bobby equals total we did dot yeah kind
14:04 - of
14:05 - so what we did up here is we made Bob a
14:08 - turtle so it kind of created the turtle
14:12 - and every function that's in like this
14:15 - turtle yeah kind of went into Bob yeah
14:19 - so that's why I like forward is now a
14:21 - part of Bob it's kind of like if Bob
14:26 - like had a set of commands to do like
14:28 - forward all these different things now
14:30 - it's part of Bob so that's why we want
14:33 - to say Bob dot forward and that means
14:36 - Bob will move forward so if you press
14:39 - ENTER if you go back to that window that
14:43 - opened you might see a small yeah yeah
14:49 - so that's like from the line of code
14:52 - that said Bob go forward so it might be
14:55 - a tiny line because that's just the
14:56 - small amount that it moved so you can
14:59 - try play around with it and make it a
15:02 - bigger number it's amazing
15:05 - you went off the page and it went off
15:07 - the 4-h I think it's too big of a number
15:11 - yeah yeah
15:15 - [Music]
15:24 - so if you want um it to turn back
15:27 - because if yours has gone out of the
15:29 - page you can make him turn back
15:31 - so one function we can use is left so
15:36 - what you'd need to type is Bob dot left
15:40 - yeah yeah left so like facing left but
15:45 - inside the brackets we can say like how
15:47 - much we want it to turn left so you do
15:50 - you guys know your angles yes yep
15:54 - it's facing this way and you want to
15:57 - make it turn the other way yep so inside
16:02 - the brackets you would just type in 180
16:05 - and then if you press ENTER and go back
16:08 - to your the screen so you should you
16:15 - should see that the cursor has turned
16:17 - the other way yeah and then if you go
16:20 - forward this time forward and then put
16:26 - in a number it moves the other way the
16:31 - basically forward makes Bob move
16:34 - whichever way it's facing so let you
16:38 - guys play around with that a bit so try
16:42 - and make a shape if you can so like a
16:45 - square or rectangle or something so have
16:53 - like have a think about how you might
16:54 - wake make a square so if you know your
16:57 - angles in which way it's facing and like
17:03 - this all the sides even are they
17:06 - different try have a play around with it
17:11 - okay and see I made Bob do a big circle
17:20 - oh you mean do big circle what did you
17:23 - use I did Bob don't circle yep
17:29 - in brackets 999 999 whoa that is a big
17:35 - number yes a dot circle is another
17:38 - function you can use so it like
17:39 - automatically makes it draw the circle
17:43 - yeah and then the number inside so juicy
17:48 - as you're typing like some text comes up
17:52 - with a yellow background so that's kind
17:57 - of telling you what should go in the
17:58 - bracket so it's saying draw a circle
18:01 - with a given radius so that number 999
18:04 - that you did that's how big the radius
18:07 - of the circle was I did a small circle
18:19 - you did a small circle so what did you
18:21 - change to make it small
18:23 - I made it 21 yep good job sir do you
18:29 - guys know like the radius in shapes do
18:32 - you know what the radius is yeah
18:35 - when eluted yours deleted what happened
18:38 - the what thing got deleted I don't know
18:42 - it just great Cheryl scream oh my god
18:44 - all right yeah I'll just stop sharing um
18:48 - and you can start sharing your screen
18:51 - and we can see what happened so do you
18:58 - remember how to share your screen just
18:59 - click share I did click share
19:04 - okay you might need a truce like when
19:07 - you click Share you might have to choose
19:09 - which screen you want to share as well
19:11 - click that one yeah I'll just click I'm
19:16 - sure yeah okay it might be a bit slow as
19:21 - well sometimes it's a bit laggy so if
19:25 - you click share like it would give you
19:26 - some options and say which one you wanna
19:29 - share yep Oh Kailyn this is that best to
19:33 - scream yeah something like that
19:35 - but this time we won't quarry to do it
19:44 - so Cory do you wanna try sharing your
19:49 - screen again yeah I'm trying to press
19:52 - desktop one yep and is it doing anything
19:55 - it could just be a bit slow it's not
19:58 - doing anything it's not doing anything
20:01 - hmm maybe just give it a couple of
20:05 - seconds it could be lagging a bit
20:07 - sometimes the share screen takes some
20:09 - time in the meantime what was the thing
20:16 - that got deleted do you know what it was
20:19 - turtle the turtle like the thing that
20:23 - was drawing oh I think your thing
20:27 - started sharing okay so yeah so I'm
20:33 - gonna talk you sure yep you're a true
20:37 - screen yeah cool so is it just that
20:40 - other window that got deleted yeah okay
20:46 - so I might have just accidentally got
20:48 - unclosed or something what you could do
20:51 - is because this is just a Python shell
20:55 - maybe if you just close it and open up
20:58 - idle again Cory can you still hear me
21:12 - can you guys still hear me yeah yep okay
21:16 - sorry I think it's being a bit slow so
21:18 - yeah maybe just close the shell and open
21:21 - up idle again and then you just need an
21:25 - importer so just remember because the
21:33 - shell is just kind of a one-line thing
21:36 - that's not like a file which we can save
21:39 - so it's okay to just close it and open
21:41 - it again because right now we're just
21:43 - testing things
21:44 - anyway yep so before doing that do you
21:55 - remember what the first step is that we
21:57 - need to do so before we can use turtle
22:03 - we actually need it import it oh yeah
22:08 - yeah because we close it and open it
22:10 - again it's like it started new yep and
22:16 - then turtle do I need a capital not for
22:24 - this okay total yes and then now we need
22:33 - to make like a little variable thing yep
22:54 - so now yeah let's back up again and you
23:01 - can just play around with what you're
23:02 - doing before now okay I'll just share my
23:06 - screen again yeah stop sharing that's
23:10 - okay if I press share I think it stops
23:12 - yours anyway yep so another thing you
23:17 - guys can do with turtle is you can
23:19 - change the color of it so right now the
23:21 - line is just black so what you can do is
23:25 - you can go - cool Bob so Bob dot color
23:31 - but um it's felt the American way so you
23:36 - don't have a U in the word color it's a
23:39 - bit confusing and then we have the
23:43 - brackets and inside the brackets what we
23:45 - need is to put a color but we need to
23:50 - put the color in the quotation marks so
23:55 - like this if I want it to be blue and
23:58 - make it blue in quotation marks and then
24:01 - if you go back to your screen you can
24:03 - see that the little arrow change to be
24:07 - blue and if you draw a line you can see
24:12 - what it looks like and another thing you
24:23 - can do is so do you see how right now
24:26 - the little arrow like our turtle on my
24:30 - things called Bob it's just the shape of
24:32 - the cursor so it's just an arrow yeah
24:34 - actually change the shape as well yep so
24:38 - you just go Bob dot J and then there's a
24:44 - few set shapes so like a turtle is an
24:47 - actual shape and if you press and it
24:51 - change into a turtle otherwise there's a
24:54 - few more if you want to see what they
24:56 - are you can just Google Python turtle
25:02 - shapes and then you can see what options
25:06 - you have and you can do the same thing
25:09 - for like color and stuff as well if you
25:12 - want to see what kind of set colors they
25:14 - have do we have to do no shaping
25:18 - quotation marks yes you do so because
25:22 - these are all words they're kind of like
25:26 - strings so you have to do it in
25:28 - quotation marks so if you go on to here
25:34 - and so this is like the documentation
25:37 - website yeah they have like all the
25:40 - functions you can use and then you can
25:43 - for example you can see color Oh
25:47 - shape so if you click on the word shape
25:50 - it will tell you all the shapes that
25:53 - doesn't it says it's somewhere let me do
26:05 - I find it's someone yeah okay I think
26:14 - there's like circle and square and
26:16 - things I'll let you guys have a look at
26:18 - the that as well on your own so this is
26:27 - the Python documentation it's very
26:29 - useful so if of it like if you ever
26:31 - forget what one of the functions are
26:34 - that we've learnt you can just look
26:35 - quickly look it up here oh yeah but
26:38 - forget like exactly how to type it it'll
26:41 - show you I'm gonna go back to shape oh
26:46 - yeah so it says here because the shape
26:50 - thing only has a few like predefined
26:53 - shape so it says up here it has like
26:56 - arrow turtle Circle Square triangle
26:59 - classic so you can try change it to any
27:03 - one of those and just remember it needs
27:07 - to be in quotations cuz they're like
27:09 - words or their strings you can also do
27:23 - the same thing for changing the color so
27:25 - if you want to see what color options
27:27 - there are you can go on to this website
27:30 - so to get to that website you can just
27:32 - type in like python turtle color or
27:36 - something like that
27:37 - and you should be able to find it mm-hmm
27:40 - so I'll let you guys quickly go on to
27:43 - that website and just have a look and
27:45 - then I'll let you try find what colors
27:48 - though and then have a play around with
27:57 - changing the colors and joy
28:22 - so did you guys manage to find the
28:25 - website Oh have a look now yep yeah now
28:31 - and then tri-c so I just want you guys
28:34 - to have a look at what color options
28:36 - that are and play around with that so
28:39 - generally I think it has like most of
28:42 - the basic ones so if you guess the
28:43 - colors it would probably be a color on
28:46 - there but just to be sure you can always
28:48 - just double check on that website so it
29:03 - should be the first result when you
29:05 - google it so if you just google like
29:10 - python turtle color oh did you find
29:28 - something um I found a list of shapes
29:31 - you found a list of shapes oh cool we
29:35 - pison avi Python oh cool
29:38 - yeah so is that like a circle turtle
29:42 - little pison shapes python shapes and it
29:46 - comes up with a pison dog and then you
29:53 - can see he'll see you that's nice let's
30:05 - see going
30:14 - is that welcome see the changing shapes
30:17 - text is it working forward what the
30:31 - shape changing oh yeah it's working okay
30:34 - cool yeah so sometimes this is I think
30:40 - just like a list of all the shapes that
30:42 - python has in general so the other one
30:46 - is just the shapes that's like the
30:48 - turtle library has but this is what
30:50 - Piper has in general I think but I'm
30:55 - guessing that it works for book which is
30:57 - pretty cool and another thing there's
31:12 - one more thing you can change oh well
31:14 - there's a few more things you can change
31:15 - but another thing you can change is the
31:17 - size so the size of the pin which is the
31:20 - thickness so do you see how right now
31:23 - our lines a really thing ya can change
31:26 - it so you can just go bub size and then
31:32 - I might type in full okay might not be
31:36 - size let me double check what it is make
31:48 - sure to type in - total mm might be pen
31:55 - size but they want it might be pen size
32:00 - so let me double check yeah
32:03 - so it's pen size so do you see here how
32:07 - it's pen size all lowercase and one word
32:11 - so you just type in sorry I'll move it
32:15 - so you just type in bub pen sides and
32:20 - inside that you can get in the side
32:24 - issues no something
32:27 - this is just the number you don't need
32:29 - the quotations the quotations are just
32:32 - so down would you make it
32:34 - how did you make it go upwards go
32:38 - upwards like to draw upwards yeah so
32:43 - which way is your thing facing right now
32:46 - is it facing the left yeah yep so do you
32:52 - remember like with your angles if we
32:54 - want to make it go up straight up do you
32:58 - know how much degrees that is yeah
33:00 - how much degrees is it 90 90 yep
33:04 - but it's 90 degrees to the right so you
33:07 - know how last time we were going like
33:09 - something duck left 90 this time try
33:13 - then this time try um like Bob dot right
33:17 - 90 so what it's saying is turn to the
33:21 - right 90 degrees and then if you go back
33:27 - it should have changed so just try that
33:31 - and see the race is it wrong something
33:38 - wrong
33:39 - yeah then you must ask money can help
33:42 - you just won fixing it
33:44 - Oh money yeah you can just look at it
33:47 - Cory just call on red I don't know what
33:49 - he's doing okay so the red just means
33:52 - that arrows but it's like nothing too
33:55 - bad
33:55 - oh yeah but then I fixed it yeah so if
33:58 - you fix it that's good so you can show
34:00 - you soon if you want but otherwise it's
34:03 - okay if you fixed it that's fine so the
34:10 - red things are just little error
34:13 - messages so like sometimes let me share
34:16 - my screen again and show you sometimes
34:18 - if you accidentally type something wrong
34:20 - I'll forget the exact word it will give
34:22 - you that message so like how when I
34:25 - typed in Bob Jacques sighs it gave me
34:28 - that error message just saying that
34:31 - there's nothing cold sighs because it
34:33 - was actually pen sighs yeah it's just
34:36 - like that so like this if I say Bob
34:38 - forward
34:40 - and don't do anything okay it's not a
34:44 - red message but it's still like an error
34:46 - message it was that clear yeah this is a
34:50 - blue message it's a bit different
34:54 - ignore the blue message for now but like
34:56 - if I typed in Bob but accidentally
35:01 - forgot the B or something and then did
35:05 - forward I'd get another red message so
35:10 - they're basically just error messages
35:12 - but they're nothing like to be too
35:15 - worried about it just cuz they just tell
35:18 - you what the error is so it's just
35:20 - generally it comes if he accidentally
35:22 - typed something wrong oh you like you
35:24 - forgot a little space or something yeah
35:27 - but yeah so did you guys have a go at
35:32 - trying to change the pen size yes yep
35:36 - and did it work yeah did yeah okay cool
35:39 - so what we might do now so this was all
35:42 - just in the Python show what we'll do
35:45 - now is actually make a program so do you
35:50 - guys remember how to make a program No
35:54 - so that's from Python shell you just go
36:00 - file and then click new file and then a
36:06 - window should open up and it just looks
36:09 - empty yep yep so that's what you want so
36:15 - Cory do you have that open is uh-hmm
36:21 - wait what so what we're doing now is
36:25 - because what we're doing before was just
36:27 - all in the Python shell so it's just
36:29 - like line by line stuff but we're
36:31 - actually going to make a little mini
36:33 - program now so to make a new file you
36:37 - just click on the top and your Python
36:40 - shell and click on file and then new
36:43 - file
36:46 - by oh yeah so you should be on the very
36:51 - top I think because yours is a Mac right
36:54 - yeah yeah so make sure you didn't shake
36:57 - fire anywhere what does it say new file
37:03 - yeah yep new fun wrote it and then did a
37:09 - window open up yes yep
37:12 - okay yeah so now it's just empty but you
37:15 - can like type in stuff but we actually
37:18 - need to type in Python code so what do
37:23 - you guys if we want to use turtle do you
37:25 - guys remember what the very first thing
37:26 - we need to do is input just yes good job
37:34 - so do that and you can close this Python
37:37 - shell now and the other one as well yeah
37:41 - just the shell so just so that we don't
37:44 - get confused hit enter yep hit enter so
37:50 - now when you hit enter nothing happens
37:53 - so that's just because we've written
37:55 - this bit of code in the file but we
37:59 - haven't actually run the file so let's
38:03 - do one more step so let's create our
38:04 - turtle when I close the outer shell it
38:08 - close the turtle close the turtle the
38:11 - drawing turtle yeah yeah that's fine
38:13 - because the idle like that turtle thing
38:16 - was part of the idle shell yeah yeah so
38:22 - what we'll do is we'll just create our
38:23 - turtle as well so do you guys remember
38:26 - how to do that so we give it a name yeah
38:31 - yep yep and then what do we need to type
38:40 - equals equals Oh yep turtle
38:46 - and remember turtle dot turtle with the
38:51 - uppercase T so just remember the title
38:55 - like the lowercase turtle can anyone
38:58 - remind us what that
39:00 - like the lowercase Turtle end up
39:05 - yeah it's turtle but open it yes so it
39:11 - means that it's like from that turtle
39:13 - library and then the turtle with the
39:17 - uppercase T and the brackets does anyone
39:19 - know what that is no that's okay so it's
39:26 - basically a function that creates our
39:29 - turtle so it kind of sets it up so base
39:33 - in Python generally in programming
39:36 - languages if any has like these two
39:38 - brackets here afterwards it generally
39:41 - means that it's a function or method
39:43 - yeah so do you guys remember what that
39:46 - is a method or function no that's okay
39:52 - so it's basically like a bit of code
39:55 - that someone like that someone has
39:57 - already written and we can reuse it yeah
40:01 - just before you said it I remembered you
40:04 - remembered yeah just a second to it yeah
40:11 - yeah that's good that you remembered
40:13 - yeah so like you know how Docs forward
40:16 - and yes and things those are all methods
40:19 - that someone has written that actually
40:22 - makes our turtle like move move yeah so
40:26 - it just makes it easier for us because
40:27 - we don't have to write like a whole
40:29 - bunch of code in whatever direction you
40:31 - made it go yeah yeah
40:35 - hi David can you give me hi yep okay so
40:40 - we've started the lesson so and what I
40:42 - might get you to do is to try like
40:44 - follow on as we're going along yes so um
40:48 - in Idol can you just open up Idol please
40:51 - and then create a new file yes yep and
40:57 - then everyone else while you're waiting
40:59 - just save um the program you have made
41:03 - and I'll save that and then choose a
41:11 - folder to save it in
41:20 - and then give it like a name so maybe
41:24 - you could call it like intro turtle or
41:27 - something less file yep and then save
41:32 - this yeah yep and then okay then thing
41:42 - should pop up yeah and then you can just
41:44 - choose where you want to save it if you
41:53 - want to make a folder may be called like
41:55 - Python class or something I mean it says
42:05 - save as and then I have to type it so
42:09 - file save as do you have any like
42:12 - pictures all like little folder things
42:15 - like how it looks like on my screen no
42:20 - no a screen and show you yeah sure like
42:27 - stop sharing mine okay said David once
42:31 - you have Idol open just click on file
42:34 - and new file just pops
42:38 - okay so yours is a bit different so do
42:42 - you see that thing wet says where and
42:45 - documents say I just wanted to do a
42:51 - folder and just check if Hills done yes
42:55 - so if you just and nice you did you see
42:58 - it okay cool that's good to open it you
43:01 - just have to right click and press edit
43:03 - with idle right click yeah oh so that
43:08 - that's not for you cause I that was so
43:10 - Chester oh sorry
43:12 - do you see like those things that says
43:14 - desktop documents things like that yeah
43:17 - yeah
43:18 - so it says well when does that little
43:21 - blue icon those it's the pictures I mean
43:24 - so it does I just the folders on your
43:26 - computer
43:27 - so you can just choose where you want to
43:29 - save it so if you want to easily find it
43:35 - you could just put it in like document
43:38 - so I'm desktop or something if you put
43:41 - it on desktop it'll just be like you
43:42 - know how Idol is just sitting there
43:44 - you'll be able to see it on your screen
43:47 - oh yeah just yeah and then where it says
43:53 - save as you just type the name of the
43:56 - file so you can give it a name like
43:59 - turtle intro or something like that and
44:08 - then just press tags you don't really
44:14 - need to worry about that you can just
44:16 - press save and then format that's fine
44:19 - because it's a Python file so let's
44:21 - write down here now yeah so it might
44:24 - have appeared somewhere on your desktop
44:26 - yeah it has yep okay that's good yeah so
44:30 - now that you guys have saved it I want
44:33 - you guys to click run and then run yeah
44:37 - so on the top where file was there
44:41 - should be another thing called run yeah
44:44 - and then you can click on run module the
44:49 - bottom yeah run module f5
44:53 - yep so what that does is it actually
44:56 - runs this code that you have in your
44:58 - file run so maybe give it a second did
45:12 - anything happen for you Chester
45:14 - we're going to run it did anything
45:16 - happen when you try to run your program
45:19 - from yep so make sure you open it again
45:25 - yeah I did but I closed the idle like
45:40 - Jake
45:41 - close that hole file like when you had
45:45 - your clothes I don't think good trick to
45:48 - see if it would work yes then I clicked
45:53 - on the file but it didn't open it okay
45:57 - so to open the file this is good for
46:00 - everyone to know to open the file that
46:02 - you've saved you have to find it first
46:05 - and then click right click yeah there
46:10 - should be an option called edit with
46:11 - idle and then if you click on that it
46:17 - should open the fire oh yeah I just
46:29 - clicked and it was yep I know so Cory I
46:36 - might get you to try that as well just
46:38 - so you know for next time so just close
46:40 - your file that you have open right now
46:50 - yeah yep Dex yeah so we're just like
47:00 - gonna pretend like it's a new day and
47:02 - you closed everything but you wouldn't
47:04 - come back to your file maybe click out
47:24 - of it and click back in how just click
47:29 - like somewhere in the background you see
47:44 - on the bottom how the little idle icon
47:48 - is open down there next to the rubbish
47:50 - bin yeah
47:53 - I try right-click on that if you
48:02 - right-click on it does any settings go
48:04 - mmm
48:05 - if I right click yep yes so just press
48:09 - quit down there
48:11 - we just want to close it and then try it
48:14 - later and maybe give it a second might
48:19 - take a second good load mm-hm
48:22 - also David do you have a new file open I
48:30 - have I have some some problems of his
48:36 - idol was the last time I was on Idol I
48:42 - accidentally doing to did and now like I
48:46 - can't find it completely says nothing is
48:58 - found and I downloaded then it says it
49:17 - says Python modifier Reap repair or
49:21 - uninstall I might get you to share your
49:30 - screen everyone else Chloe don't worry
49:33 - about closing that for now can you still
49:35 - type on that file it could be frozen
49:46 - maybe stop sharing your screen as well
49:49 - it might be making it a bit slow and try
49:57 - and after you've done that while I'm
50:02 - helping David what you guys can do is
50:04 - try and make like a square
50:06 - shape so do you remember how we were
50:08 - doing it in show with a forward and
50:11 - right and stuff try adding those lines
50:15 - of codes to make a shape but this time
50:18 - type it in your actual file and then
50:20 - when you press run it should
50:22 - automatically draw your shape does that
50:26 - make sense yep yep okay so David what
50:31 - happened with Python G modify modify
50:38 - repair or uninstall I think I think I
50:41 - have to do uninstall ungenerous install
50:43 - it again yeah so chesta does that make
51:17 - sense what I told you to do yeah yep
51:21 - okay so try like do like Bob forward and
51:25 - stuff and try and make a shape and when
51:27 - you've done a couple of lines you can
51:29 - press run run module and then it should
51:33 - open up shell and then it should open up
51:35 - the other Python window and you should
51:39 - be able to see your shape okay
51:42 - so David now it is still so you can go
51:47 - back and try and stall it now the same
51:52 - way you did
51:59 - so Cory can you hear me you still now so
52:33 - Chester maybe once you've done a couple
52:35 - of lines just try run it and see what it
52:38 - was like
52:45 - now do I close it close it close
52:52 - [Music]
53:10 - [Music]
53:21 - [Music]
53:26 - on the file yeah I type to run module
53:34 - but it didn't run the turtle shell thing
53:45 - so today I'll let you try to find that
53:48 - and then just did you wanna try show you
53:50 - a screen I can't find it anywhere
54:12 - so one thing you might need to do is
54:15 - Chester do you see that second line the
54:18 - Bob equals total duck total maybe just
54:23 - get rid of that line it might be closing
54:25 - in error I am and then do you see Bob
54:32 - duck forward yeah whenever you use that
54:35 - they need to have brackets and it needs
54:38 - to have a number in the brackets like
54:40 - that one
54:41 - yep so like the bottom one delete this
54:45 - one yep you can delete it and sorry what
54:50 - I meant by run module so you can get rid
54:52 - of those words that say run module under
54:56 - to run it you have to you see on the top
54:59 - where it says run like it says file I
55:02 - did yeah yep run click on that and then
55:07 - click on run module over there it yep
55:12 - and now okay that's okay yep every time
55:16 - you run it you need to be safe and yeah
55:22 - so now you know but if you go into your
55:26 - shell do you see the red texture yeah it
55:30 - means there's an error message
55:33 - so if we click on top on the shells it
55:40 - tells you what the error is it says
55:44 - total object has no attribute forward so
55:48 - do you see what the issue it yeah what's
55:52 - thank you that I didn't put brackets at
55:56 - the end with the numbering the board so
56:01 - not exactly but your clothes about where
56:05 - the error is so the error is just it's a
56:10 - simple one so it's just the word for
56:11 - word they spelt wrong so it got confused
56:15 - oh the forward has a a and then a yep so
56:23 - a for the second Oh oops sorry f w a
56:39 - it's W a body yep and now try run it
56:52 - again so do the same thing yep
57:00 - so do you see how it did the line yeah
57:02 - yeah so now it's doing like the exact
57:04 - same thing is what we were doing in
57:07 - Python shell except it did it all in at
57:09 - once okay and like keep adding lines to
57:13 - it and it can like keep drawing shapes
57:17 - and stuff that's how you actually use
57:19 - that Python turtle code in and I got it
57:24 - yep
57:26 - so Cory were you able - I share now yeah
57:29 - you can stop sharing now and also it's
57:32 - the end of the lesson I'm pretty sure Oh
57:35 - Cory were you able to type on your file
57:38 - again oh yeah oh sorry just the did you
57:42 - have a question
57:44 - it's 5:30 - yeah it's like did anyone
57:49 - have any question no no okay um so Cory
57:59 - were you able to type on your own if not
58:10 - that's okay because it's saved and then
58:13 - if you want at the beginning of next
58:16 - lesson I can quickly I'm show you what I
58:18 - was telling you about but basically I
58:21 - don't know if you were looking at
58:23 - Chester's screen but what we're doing it
58:26 - was just putting the Python code in the
58:28 - application you can move it around can
58:31 - you type in it no no okay um so I might
58:37 - we might try figure out what the issue
58:39 - is next week because this lessons almost
58:42 - up it could just be that it's frozen or
58:45 - something I'm not a hundred percent sure
58:48 - but basically what we were doing with
58:50 - that file is did you see what Chester
58:53 - was doing on his screen so we were just
58:57 - putting like the code that we were
58:59 - typing in like in the Python shell we
59:02 - were actually putting it in the file so
59:05 - that you could have you could run that
59:06 - Python file and do all that code all at
59:09 - once so we can quickly go over it at the
59:12 - beginning of next week if you want but
59:15 - for now we'll have to finish off the
59:17 - course and David fish
59:21 - I'll try help you find the file next
59:24 - week but until then if you could try
59:27 - have a look in your computer and see
59:31 - where if you can find idle it should be
59:34 - there somewhere it might be in like
59:36 - programs and then a folder called Python
59:39 - or something just look for it and see if
59:43 - not I'll help you next find it
59:48 - but other than that did anyone have any
59:50 - question no no okay
59:55 - Cory David did you guys have any
59:58 - questions no no okay
60:01 - cool so I'll just leave fit and then
60:06 - I'll see you guys next week
60:07 - I guess okay see ya good week you too
60:12 - you too
