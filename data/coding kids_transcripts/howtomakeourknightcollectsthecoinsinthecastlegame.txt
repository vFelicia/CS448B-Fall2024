00:00 - [Music]
00:04 - welcome to coding kids today I'm going
00:08 - to show you how to build this game night
00:10 - collect the coins in the castle first
00:13 - let's look at how we play it the player
00:16 - controls the night by pressing the up
00:18 - down left and right arrow keys to make
00:22 - the night move around the screen the aim
00:24 - of the game is to collect all the coins
00:26 - and the money bag by touching them with
00:29 - the night when you collect all the coins
00:31 - and the money bag you win however you
00:34 - also need to avoid running into the
00:36 - ghosts because if you touch the ghosts
00:39 - you lose now let's build the game there
00:42 - are seven parts to the game 1 the
00:44 - backdrop to the night three the ghosts
00:49 - for the coins 5 the money bag 6 you win
00:54 - and 7 you lose now let's start building
00:58 - one step at a time first let's start
01:02 - with a brand new project by clicking the
01:04 - create button on the home page as you
01:07 - can see a new project will open with the
01:10 - cats bright as the default sprite a
01:12 - sprite is a character or object that we
01:15 - use in making the computer program let's
01:18 - delete the cat's bright so step one
01:21 - let's add the backdrop click on the
01:23 - miniature backdrop icon at the bottom of
01:26 - the screen then scroll through the
01:28 - backdrop library until you find a
01:30 - backdrop that you like you may choose a
01:32 - different backdrop to me double click on
01:35 - the backdrop you have selected to set it
01:37 - as your backdrop now our game has a
01:40 - backdrop title this backdrop as castle
01:45 - for step two let's import a new sprite
01:47 - into our workspace select a new sprite
01:50 - from the sprite library I want to use
01:53 - the nite sprite but you may choose to
01:55 - use a difference bright to me you can
01:57 - resize the sprite to make it bigger or
02:00 - smaller if you like I want my sprite to
02:03 - be a bit smaller to do this use the
02:06 - shrink icon in the toolbar at the top
02:08 - and click on the sprite until it's the
02:11 - size that you want now we want to add
02:13 - some code to our nite sprite to do this
02:16 - make sure the night is selected and then
02:18 - open the scripts tab which is at the top
02:21 - center of the page near the stop sign we
02:24 - need all night to move when we press the
02:26 - arrow keys to do this let's use the blog
02:29 - when space key pressed drag four of
02:32 - these blocks into the workspace now
02:42 - click on the drop down arrow to change
02:45 - the space key to left arrow key right
02:48 - arrow key up arrow key and down arrow
02:52 - key for each of these event blocks now
02:55 - we need to add the motion blocks to
02:57 - these event blocks we know that to move
03:00 - up and down we use the y axis and to
03:03 - move left and right we use the x axis to
03:06 - make the night move up with the up arrow
03:09 - we need to choose a block that saves
03:11 - change Y by 10 from the motion category
03:14 - now connect it to the blocks that says
03:17 - when up arrow key pressed to activate it
03:20 - let's test it out
03:24 - it works repeat this for each of the
03:27 - arrow keys but make sure to remember the
03:30 - down and left use negative 10 in the
03:32 - motion block instead of positive 10
03:47 - let's test our code great it works now
03:51 - we can move the night around the screen
03:54 - for step 3 we're going to create and
03:56 - close our ghost sprite first let's
04:00 - import a new sprite into our workspace I
04:02 - will select a new sprite from the sprite
04:05 - library I want to use the ghost sprite
04:08 - but you may choose to use a difference
04:10 - bright to me the ghost sprite is a bit
04:16 - different to the nite sprite because the
04:19 - ghost sprite isn't controlled by a
04:20 - player instead the motion of the ghost
04:23 - is automated meaning it happens all by
04:26 - itself we want our ghost to move as soon
04:30 - as the game begins to do this drag the
04:32 - event block when green flag clicked into
04:36 - the workspace now we need to code how
04:38 - the ghost will move the ghost sprite is
04:41 - moving forwards but turning randomly
04:44 - between each movement to code for this
04:46 - let's grab a move 10 steps block and put
04:50 - it under the when green flag clicked
04:54 - block next select a turn clockwise block
04:57 - and put it under the move 10 steps block
05:00 - instead of getting our sprite to rotate
05:03 - 15 degrees we want it to randomly choose
05:05 - between rotating 5 degrees clockwise or
05:08 - negative 5 degrees clockwise this is
05:11 - also known as 5 degrees anti-clockwise
05:14 - to do this let's get the pic random one
05:17 - to 10 block from the operators category
05:20 - and change the numbers to negative 5 and
05:23 - 5 to make sure the ghost sprite
05:25 - continues to move for the duration of
05:28 - the game let's put a forever loop which
05:30 - is found in the control category over
05:32 - our blocks next let's make sure the
05:35 - ghost won't disappear when it's on a
05:37 - to do this add the block if homage
05:40 - bounce inside the forever loop and then
05:44 - a day wait one second from the control
05:47 - category to control the speed the ghost
05:49 - moves at I will change my waiting time
05:52 - to not point 15 seconds finally let's
05:55 - give our ghost a starting point to do
05:58 - this use the motion block go to X Y my
06:02 - ghost will start at x equals 190 y
06:06 - equals 138 let's test our code great our
06:13 - ghost moves just like we want it to 4
06:16 - sep four we're going to create and code
06:19 - for our coin sprites first let's draw a
06:22 - new sprite to do this go to the
06:25 - paintbrush icon located next to the
06:27 - sprite library icon to paint a coin draw
06:31 - a circle with the circle feature and
06:33 - then add a dollar sign
06:35 - [Music]
06:51 - the coin sprites are objects that we
06:54 - collect during the game to give us
06:56 - points they can do this because we have
06:59 - assigned the variable money to them to
07:02 - create a variable go into the data
07:04 - category and click on the maker variable
07:07 - let's call this variable money and click
07:11 - ok make sure you can see a checkmark
07:13 - next to the variable money this makes
07:16 - sure we can see our score during the
07:19 - game now that we have created the
07:21 - variable money let's start coding for
07:24 - how our night and coins interact with
07:27 - each other in the game the variable
07:29 - money only increases when the night
07:32 - touches the coin after the night touches
07:35 - the coin the coin disappears first we
07:38 - need a when green flag clicked block to
07:41 - start our code next we want to find an
07:44 - if-then loop from the control category
07:46 - this allows us to make a decision about
07:49 - when our score will increase as we only
07:51 - want our score to increase if the night
07:53 - is touching the coin too close for this
07:56 - select the block called touching night
07:59 - from the sensing category and put it
08:01 - into the top of the if-then block now we
08:05 - can put what we want to happen if I
08:07 - might is touching the coin inside our if
08:09 - then loop we want the variable money to
08:13 - increase by 1 and we want the coin to
08:15 - hide to do this find the block change
08:19 - money by one in the data category and
08:21 - hide from the looks category and then
08:24 - put them inside the if vens loop we need
08:27 - a forever loop around our if then loop
08:30 - to ensure that the condition is being
08:32 - checked continuously you can find the
08:35 - forever loop in the control category
08:37 - finally to make sure we can see our coin
08:40 - when we restart the game add a show blog
08:42 - finney see when green flag clicked block
08:45 - let's test our code great our coin
08:49 - disappears and our score increases by 1
08:51 - when the night touches the coin now
08:54 - we have one coin that works we want to
08:57 - duplicate our coin so that we can have
08:59 - five coins to do this select the stamp
09:03 - icon at the top of the screen and click
09:05 - on the coins bright do this four times
09:08 - to create five coin sprites now we have
09:28 - five sprite but all of them are randomly
09:31 - positioned on the screen to make sure
09:34 - they go where you want a day go to X Y
09:37 - block to each coin make sure the
09:40 - coordinates are unique for each of them
09:42 - so they aren't on top of each other
09:44 - [Music]
09:56 - so step 5 we're going to create and code
10:00 - for our money bag sprite first let's
10:03 - draw a new sprite to do this go to the
10:06 - paintbrush icon located next to the
10:09 - sprite library icon use the paintbrush
10:12 - to create a money bag shape the code for
10:29 - our money bag is almost exactly the same
10:31 - as the code for our coins so we can use
10:34 - some of our code from before to create
10:36 - our money bag code first let's copy the
10:40 - code we used for our coin sprite to do
10:43 - this open a coin sprite and drag the
10:45 - code down to hover over the money bag
10:48 - sprite drop it on the money bag sprite
10:51 - this plus the code from the coin into
10:54 - the money bag workspace now we need to
10:57 - change the amount our money bag changes
11:00 - for variable money by because the money
11:02 - bag is worth more than the coins change
11:05 - the one in it change money by 12 a-5 we
11:09 - also need to change the position of our
11:12 - money bag so that it is unique change
11:16 - the coordinates in the go to X Y blog so
11:19 - that they are different to all of your
11:21 - coins for step 6 we're going to create
11:24 - the backdrop for you win and code for
11:28 - how that happens first select the stage
11:31 - image located in the bottom left-hand
11:33 - corner now go to the backdrops tab and
11:36 - right click on your current backdrop
11:38 - click on duplicate so you can have a
11:41 - copy of your original backdrop now add
11:44 - the text you win to this picture by
11:47 - using the text function
11:50 - [Music]
11:54 - title this backdrop you win
11:57 - now open up the script tab again and
12:00 - drag out a when green flag clicked block
12:04 - you can only win the game if you have
12:06 - collected all of the coins and the money
12:09 - bag when you have collected all the
12:11 - items the variable money will be equal
12:14 - to 10 to code this let's use an if then
12:18 - loop and an equal block from the
12:20 - operator category drag the equal block
12:23 - into the top of the if-then loop inside
12:26 - the equal block drag the block money
12:29 - from the data category and in the other
12:31 - side type 10 now we can code for what
12:35 - happens when the variable money equals
12:37 - 10 when money equals 10 you win add the
12:41 - block change backdrop to you win from
12:44 - the looks category and underneath the
12:47 - block stop all from the control category
12:49 - make sure you put a forever block around
12:52 - the if-then loop so that the condition
12:55 - is always being checked and lastly add
12:58 - the block switch backdrop to Castle and
13:01 - set money 20 Vinny see when green flag
13:06 - clicked block 4 step 7 we're going to
13:09 - create the backdrop for you lose and
13:11 - code for how that happens first select
13:14 - the stage image located in the bottom
13:17 - left-hand corner now go to the backdrops
13:20 - tab and right click on your current
13:22 - backdrop click on duplicate so you can
13:25 - have a copy of your original backdrop
13:28 - now add the pegs you lose to this
13:31 - picture by using the text function
13:34 - [Music]
13:42 - title this backdrop you lose now select
13:46 - your nite sprite and drag a when green
13:49 - flag clicked block into the workspace
13:51 - just like for the you win scenario the
13:55 - you lose scenario only happens if the
13:58 - ghost is touching the night therefore we
14:01 - need them if then lube and a touching
14:04 - ghost blog click these two blocks
14:06 - together and place them under the event
14:08 - blog inside of our if loop we want to
14:12 - use the switch backdrop to you lose blog
14:15 - found in the looks category place this
14:18 - block inside the if then loop when you
14:21 - lose the game all motions should stop
14:24 - therefore we also want the stop all blog
14:27 - found in the control category put this
14:30 - underneath switch backdrop finally we
14:33 - want our condition to be checked forever
14:35 - so add a forever loop around the if-then
14:39 - loop now let's click on the green flag
14:42 - to test our game
14:43 - [Music]
14:57 - great it works add your own features
15:01 - like music or timers to personalize the
15:04 - game
15:05 - [Music]
