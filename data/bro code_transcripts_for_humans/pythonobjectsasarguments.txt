00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's your
00:02 - bro hope you're doing well
00:03 - and in this video i'm going to explain
00:04 - how we can pass objects as
00:06 - arguments so sit back relax and enjoy
00:09 - the show
00:12 - if you find this video helpful please
00:14 - remember to like
00:15 - comment and subscribe your support will
00:18 - help keep this channel running
00:19 - ladies and gentlemen in today's video
00:22 - i'm going to be demonstrating how we can
00:23 - pass
00:24 - objects as arguments for this example
00:26 - let's say we have a class car
00:28 - and there is one class variable called
00:30 - color
00:31 - color equals none what we'll be doing is
00:33 - calling a function that accepts an
00:35 - object as an argument as well as a color
00:38 - so let's create a function named change
00:41 - color now make sure when you define this
00:43 - function it's not within
00:44 - the cart class then technically this
00:46 - would be a method of the car class
00:49 - what we would like is a separate
00:50 - function outside of the car class
00:52 - now we need to set up some parameters we
00:54 - would like to accept a car
00:56 - object as well as a color so for the
00:58 - first parameter let's say a car
01:00 - and make sure this is in uppercase or
01:02 - capital because python doesn't like that
01:04 - argument names should be lowercase so
01:06 - when we pass in a car we will give it a
01:08 - nickname
01:09 - of car and we would also like to pass in
01:12 - a color so let's set up a parameter
01:14 - called color
01:14 - now when we pass in a car we will assign
01:17 - that car's color with whatever color
01:19 - that we receive
01:20 - so car dot color equals
01:24 - color and now let's create some car
01:25 - objects so let's say
01:27 - car one equals car car two
01:30 - equals car and car three equals car
01:34 - currently if i were to print their
01:36 - colors this is what we'll see
01:38 - print car one dot color and repeat the
01:41 - steps for
01:42 - two and three and we're not calling this
01:44 - function yet so
01:45 - all of these colors should be set to
01:47 - none they are
01:49 - basically cars with no color they're i
01:51 - don't know
01:52 - iron or something whatever cars are made
01:54 - out of aluminum
01:55 - plastic stuff like that okay so now
01:57 - let's call this function
01:58 - change color perhaps right here so in
02:01 - order to call this function we need to
02:03 - pass in
02:04 - a car object as well as a color so let's
02:06 - pass in
02:07 - car one and a color perhaps red and
02:10 - we'll repeat the steps for
02:11 - two and three so let's say car two will
02:14 - be
02:15 - white and car three will be blue
02:20 - now after calling this function we have
02:22 - a car
02:23 - object and a color and we're assigning
02:25 - the color of our car
02:26 - to whatever color that we receive now
02:28 - these cars in order car 1 2
02:30 - and 3 are red white and blue now one
02:34 - thing that you should know is that the
02:35 - name of this parameter that accepts our
02:37 - object
02:38 - doesn't necessarily need the same name
02:40 - as the class name
02:41 - that created the object that we're
02:42 - passing in we could name this something
02:44 - else entirely perhaps
02:46 - vehicle you'll just want to be sure that
02:48 - this is at least descriptive of the kind
02:49 - of object that you would like to pass in
02:52 - and we're not limited to just passing in
02:54 - car objects
02:55 - we can pass in all sorts of objects but
02:57 - we need to pass in
02:58 - an object as well as a color so this
03:01 - time let's create a class called
03:02 - motorcycle class motorcycle
03:06 - and this class will also have a color
03:08 - set to none
03:09 - so what we're doing is actually reusing
03:11 - this function for all sorts of different
03:13 - kinds of vehicles
03:14 - now let's create a vehicle i'll just
03:16 - name this bike one for short
03:18 - bike one equals motorcycle now let's
03:21 - call the
03:22 - change color function and we can pass in
03:25 - an object as well as color this time we
03:28 - will pass in
03:29 - our bike object as well as a color i
03:32 - think
03:32 - black counts as a color and let's print
03:37 - bike ones color
03:41 - and this should work we have red white
03:44 - blue and black
03:45 - in conclusion we can pass objects as
03:47 - arguments to a function
03:49 - much like what we've been doing with
03:51 - variables however the type of objects
03:53 - that we pass in may be limited based on
03:56 - the required attributes and methods
03:58 - that that given class or object might
04:00 - have and we'll get more into this on the
04:03 - next video on
04:04 - duct typing so if you would like a copy
04:06 - of all this code i will post all of this
04:08 - in the comments section down below
04:10 - but yeah that is how to pass objects as
04:12 - arguments
04:13 - using python
