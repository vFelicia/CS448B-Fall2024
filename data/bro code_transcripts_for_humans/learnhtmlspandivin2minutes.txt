00:02 - hey welcome back in this video i'm going
00:04 - to explain the span and div tags let's
00:08 - begin with span span adds markup to text
00:12 - or portion of a document anything that i
00:14 - surround with a pair of spam tags i can
00:17 - apply markup or some effect too so in my
00:20 - example document i have a header and
00:23 - three paragraphs what if i would like
00:25 - this specific sentence to be i don't
00:27 - know red well what i could do is
00:29 - surround this sentence in my document
00:32 - with a pair of spam tags
00:34 - so i need an opening spam tag and a
00:36 - closing spam tag
00:38 - and that sentence ends right here and
00:41 - within the span tag i can change some of
00:43 - the attributes of this sentence um so i
00:46 - would like to change maybe the style
00:48 - i'll set the style color equal to red
00:52 - now you probably do want this closing
00:54 - tag if you do not have this closing tag
00:57 - your span will take up this entire
00:59 - section
01:00 - so basically that's what span is it adds
01:03 - markup to text or a portion of a
01:06 - document div is very similar except it
01:09 - divides a division of a document so what
01:12 - if i would like to change the background
01:14 - color of these three paragraphs well
01:16 - what we learned in the last video on
01:18 - colors is that we could set the style
01:22 - background
01:23 - color
01:24 - equal to some shade of gray maybe
01:28 - this value this does work and i could
01:30 - just copy this and paste it for each of
01:32 - these paragraphs
01:35 - or another way of doing this is that i
01:37 - can surround these three paragraphs with
01:40 - a pair of div tags
01:42 - so we need an opening div tag
01:44 - and a closing div tag
01:47 - and then i will apply this style
01:49 - attribute to the opening div tag and it
01:53 - will apply this attribute to anything
01:56 - between these div tags so yeah that's
01:58 - basically what the span and div tags do
02:01 - span adds markup to text or portion of a
02:04 - document div defines a division of a
02:06 - document so yeah that's span and div in
02:10 - html
