00:02 - all right welcome back everybody in this
00:03 - video we're going to discuss the const
00:05 - keyword the const keyword specifies that
00:08 - a variable's value is constant it tells
00:11 - the compiler to prevent anything from
00:13 - modifying it so that it's effectively
00:16 - read-only here's an example let's create
00:18 - a program to calculate the circumference
00:20 - of a circle we'll first define the
00:22 - variables that we'll need
00:24 - we have
00:25 - double
00:26 - pi
00:27 - pi equals 3.14
00:32 - then we have double
00:34 - radius pick some radius i'll pick 10.
00:39 - then double
00:41 - circumference
00:44 - equals and here's the formula to
00:46 - calculate the circumference of a circle
00:48 - it's two
00:50 - times
00:51 - pi
00:52 - times
00:54 - radius
00:55 - then we will display our circumference
00:58 - standard output
01:00 - we will display
01:02 - circumference
01:05 - then i'll add
01:06 - maybe centimeters
01:08 - our circumference is
01:12 - 62.83 centimeters
01:14 - any variable we do not want to be able
01:16 - to be changed at all we can turn into a
01:18 - constant
01:19 - let's say that somebody goes into our
01:21 - program and changes pi to a different
01:23 - number like
01:25 - 4 20 69 well then this is going to
01:28 - change the result of our program we may
01:30 - have not realized that somebody changed
01:32 - the value of pi before 2069 so any
01:35 - variable you do not want changed you can
01:37 - prefix this keyword const
01:40 - const double pi now a common naming
01:43 - convention for constants
01:45 - is to make all of the letters uppercase
01:48 - so let's change pi from lowercase to all
01:50 - uppercase
01:51 - and we'll need to make that change here
01:53 - as well now let's try and change pi to
01:56 - 420 69 again and then see what happens
02:00 - okay we have an error assignment of
02:02 - read-only variable pi
02:04 - so by including constants it adds some
02:06 - data security we can't normally change
02:08 - any value that's a constant a couple
02:11 - other examples of variables that you
02:13 - could turn into constants could be maybe
02:15 - the speed of light maybe you have a
02:17 - physics calculator so const
02:20 - and light
02:23 - speed
02:24 - the speed of light in meters per second
02:27 - is two nine nine seven nine two
02:30 - four five eight
02:32 - let's think of one more example perhaps
02:34 - you're working with screen resolutions
02:36 - we have const
02:39 - int
02:40 - width
02:41 - of
02:42 - 1920
02:44 - then
02:45 - constant
02:46 - height
02:48 - of
02:48 - 1080.
02:50 - these may be a few examples of variables
02:52 - you do not want to be changed or altered
02:54 - at all you only want them to be read
02:55 - only yeah that's a const everybody it's
02:58 - a keyword that will modify a variable or
03:01 - some value so that it's read-only and
03:03 - can't be changed you should use
03:05 - constants as often as possible only if
03:07 - you know that a variable is not going to
03:09 - be changed at all your assignment is to
03:12 - think of a constant and post it in the
03:14 - comment section hey if you're enjoying
03:15 - the series please be sure to smash that

all right welcome back everybody in this video we're going to discuss the const keyword the const keyword specifies that a variable's value is constant it tells the compiler to prevent anything from modifying it so that it's effectively readonly here's an example let's create a program to calculate the circumference of a circle we'll first define the variables that we'll need we have double pi pi equals 3.14 then we have double radius pick some radius i'll pick 10. then double circumference equals and here's the formula to calculate the circumference of a circle it's two times pi times radius then we will display our circumference standard output we will display circumference then i'll add maybe centimeters our circumference is 62.83 centimeters any variable we do not want to be able to be changed at all we can turn into a constant let's say that somebody goes into our program and changes pi to a different number like 4 20 69 well then this is going to change the result of our program we may have not realized that somebody changed the value of pi before 2069 so any variable you do not want changed you can prefix this keyword const const double pi now a common naming convention for constants is to make all of the letters uppercase so let's change pi from lowercase to all uppercase and we'll need to make that change here as well now let's try and change pi to 420 69 again and then see what happens okay we have an error assignment of readonly variable pi so by including constants it adds some data security we can't normally change any value that's a constant a couple other examples of variables that you could turn into constants could be maybe the speed of light maybe you have a physics calculator so const and light speed the speed of light in meters per second is two nine nine seven nine two four five eight let's think of one more example perhaps you're working with screen resolutions we have const int width of 1920 then constant height of 1080. these may be a few examples of variables you do not want to be changed or altered at all you only want them to be read only yeah that's a const everybody it's a keyword that will modify a variable or some value so that it's readonly and can't be changed you should use constants as often as possible only if you know that a variable is not going to be changed at all your assignment is to think of a constant and post it in the comment section hey if you're enjoying the series please be sure to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
