00:00 - hey what's good everybody so in today's
00:02 - video I'm going to give you a lesson in
00:03 - destructuring in JavaScript
00:05 - destructuring allows us to extract
00:08 - values from arrays and objects then
00:10 - assign them to variables in a convenient
00:12 - way we can use straight brackets to
00:14 - perform array destructuring or curly
00:17 - braces to perform object destructuring
00:19 - I'll give you five different examples
00:21 - example one swap the value of two
00:24 - variables we'll have let a equal 1 let b
00:29 - equal
00:31 - to use array D structuring we need a set
00:33 - of straight
00:35 - brackets add the variables a comma B
00:39 - this will equal we're creating a new
00:41 - array on the right hand side B comma a
00:45 - on the left hand side of our equals
00:47 - we're using destructuring on the right
00:49 - hand side we're creating an array let's
00:51 - see what's within variables A and B
00:54 - console.log variable a then variable
00:58 - B so if these values are swapped we
01:02 - should have two then one not one and two
01:06 - that's example one we can use
01:07 - destructuring to swap the value of two
01:11 - variables example two we can swap two
01:13 - elements in an array let's create an
01:16 - array of
01:17 - colors const colors equals an array pick
01:22 - some colors I'll go with RGB so that
01:25 - would be red
01:28 - green blue
01:30 - let's add black and
01:34 - white suppose I would like to swap the
01:37 - position of the first element and the
01:39 - last element this first element has an
01:41 - index of zero this particular last
01:44 - element has an index of four again we're
01:46 - going to use array to structuring we
01:48 - need a set of straight brackets we'll
01:50 - take our array colors at index of
01:55 - zero comma array at index of four
02:00 - we want to swap red with white 0 1 2 3 4
02:04 - that's the fourth index equals we're
02:08 - creating a new array by using Straight
02:10 - brackets colors at index 4 comma colors
02:15 - at
02:16 - index0 then let's print our
02:18 - array
02:21 - console.log R array of
02:24 - colors there we go we have white green
02:27 - blue black red that's how we can use
02:30 - destructuring to swap two elements in an
02:33 - array example three we can assign array
02:36 - elements to variables we'll declare a
02:38 - bunch of variables const we'll use
02:40 - destructuring we're destructuring an
02:42 - array we need a set of straight brackets
02:44 - we'll create some variable names first
02:48 - color Second
02:51 - Color third
02:54 - color I will assign this equal to our
02:58 - array colors
03:01 - let's print these
03:02 - variables
03:04 - console.log our first color we have
03:08 - red second
03:10 - color
03:12 - green third
03:14 - color blue you could combine a radi
03:18 - structuring with rest parameters we have
03:21 - two colors left let's assign that to a
03:23 - new array we'll use rest parameters I
03:27 - will name this array EXT ra
03:31 - colors then we will
03:35 - console.log extra colors and that should
03:38 - be a new array that has the remaining
03:40 - colors black and white that's how to
03:43 - assign array elements to variables using
03:47 - destructuring example for extract values
03:50 - from objects we'll create two people
03:53 - objects const person
03:57 - one person one will have a few
03:59 - properties
04:00 - first name will be
04:04 - SpongeBob last name will be
04:10 - SquarePants age will be 30 and a job
04:14 - meaning
04:15 - occupation not John
04:18 - job his job is that he is a fry
04:21 - cook all right let's copy person one
04:24 - looks like that n should be capital in
04:26 - last name all right let's copy person
04:29 - one
04:30 - paste it change person one to person two
04:34 - the first name of person two will be
04:36 - Patrick last name star age will be
04:41 - 34 person two is not going to have a job
04:43 - property he's
04:45 - unemployed using destructuring I can
04:48 - extract values from these
04:50 - objects we'll create a few variables
04:53 - const we'll use object destructuring we
04:55 - need a set of curly braces this time
04:58 - we'll create these variables
05:00 - first
05:01 - name last name age and
05:06 - job now this equals let's start with
05:09 - person
05:10 - one let's display these variables
05:16 - console.log first name is
05:22 - SpongeBob last name
05:26 - SquarePants age 30
05:31 - job fry cook let's do this with person
05:36 - two Patrick Star his ages 34 person two
05:40 - does not have a job property person one
05:43 - does though our job variable is
05:45 - undefined as you can see here you can
05:48 - set default values when using
05:50 - destructuring if somebody doesn't have a
05:52 - job property we'll set job to equal
05:58 - unemployed let's see if that works yep
06:01 - Patrick Star age 34 his job is he's
06:04 - unemployed that's how you can extract
06:06 - values from objects values extracted can
06:09 - even have default
06:11 - values all right last example we can
06:13 - destructure in function parameters we
06:16 - can pass an object to a function and
06:19 - destructure it when it's passed in let's
06:21 - create a function we will create a
06:24 - function to display a person
06:30 - with the parameters we'll use
06:32 - destructuring we're destructuring an
06:33 - object we need a set of curly braces
06:36 - we'll receive an object such as this I'm
06:40 - going to invoke display person we'll
06:43 - pass in person one as an argument when
06:47 - we receive person one as an argument
06:49 - we'll destructure that object right away
06:51 - we will create a first name parameter
06:54 - last
06:55 - name age and
06:58 - job all we'll do is print a few lines
07:01 - using
07:02 - console.log I'll use a template string
07:05 - let's say Name colon space I'll add a
07:09 - placeholder first
07:11 - name and last
07:15 - name let's add a new
07:20 - line age call in space add a placeholder
07:25 - age then lastly
07:28 - job job colon space add a placeholder
07:32 - job we're passing in person one and D
07:35 - structuring it we should display name
07:38 - SpongeBob SquarePants age 30 job fry
07:41 - cook let's pass in person two as an
07:45 - argument name Patrick Star age 34 job is
07:50 - undefined again we can set a default
07:52 - value when destructuring if an object
07:54 - doesn't have a job property we will set
07:56 - that equal to be unemploy
08:00 - employed Patrick Star age 34 job
08:03 - unemployed then if we pass in person one
08:06 - again his job should not be unemployed
08:09 - he's a fry cook there is a job property
08:12 - so we do not use the default value all
08:14 - right everybody so those are a few
08:16 - examples of destructuring there's a lot
08:18 - you can do with destructuring you use a
08:20 - set of straight brackets to perform
08:22 - array destructuring or curly braces for
08:24 - object destructuring they allow you to
08:27 - extract values from arrays an object
08:29 - then assign them to variables in a
08:31 - convenient way and well that is
08:33 - destructuring in
08:39 - JavaScript

Cleaned transcript:

hey what's good everybody so in today's video I'm going to give you a lesson in destructuring in JavaScript destructuring allows us to extract values from arrays and objects then assign them to variables in a convenient way we can use straight brackets to perform array destructuring or curly braces to perform object destructuring I'll give you five different examples example one swap the value of two variables we'll have let a equal 1 let b equal to use array D structuring we need a set of straight brackets add the variables a comma B this will equal we're creating a new array on the right hand side B comma a on the left hand side of our equals we're using destructuring on the right hand side we're creating an array let's see what's within variables A and B console.log variable a then variable B so if these values are swapped we should have two then one not one and two that's example one we can use destructuring to swap the value of two variables example two we can swap two elements in an array let's create an array of colors const colors equals an array pick some colors I'll go with RGB so that would be red green blue let's add black and white suppose I would like to swap the position of the first element and the last element this first element has an index of zero this particular last element has an index of four again we're going to use array to structuring we need a set of straight brackets we'll take our array colors at index of zero comma array at index of four we want to swap red with white 0 1 2 3 4 that's the fourth index equals we're creating a new array by using Straight brackets colors at index 4 comma colors at index0 then let's print our array console.log R array of colors there we go we have white green blue black red that's how we can use destructuring to swap two elements in an array example three we can assign array elements to variables we'll declare a bunch of variables const we'll use destructuring we're destructuring an array we need a set of straight brackets we'll create some variable names first color Second Color third color I will assign this equal to our array colors let's print these variables console.log our first color we have red second color green third color blue you could combine a radi structuring with rest parameters we have two colors left let's assign that to a new array we'll use rest parameters I will name this array EXT ra colors then we will console.log extra colors and that should be a new array that has the remaining colors black and white that's how to assign array elements to variables using destructuring example for extract values from objects we'll create two people objects const person one person one will have a few properties first name will be SpongeBob last name will be SquarePants age will be 30 and a job meaning occupation not John job his job is that he is a fry cook all right let's copy person one looks like that n should be capital in last name all right let's copy person one paste it change person one to person two the first name of person two will be Patrick last name star age will be 34 person two is not going to have a job property he's unemployed using destructuring I can extract values from these objects we'll create a few variables const we'll use object destructuring we need a set of curly braces this time we'll create these variables first name last name age and job now this equals let's start with person one let's display these variables console.log first name is SpongeBob last name SquarePants age 30 job fry cook let's do this with person two Patrick Star his ages 34 person two does not have a job property person one does though our job variable is undefined as you can see here you can set default values when using destructuring if somebody doesn't have a job property we'll set job to equal unemployed let's see if that works yep Patrick Star age 34 his job is he's unemployed that's how you can extract values from objects values extracted can even have default values all right last example we can destructure in function parameters we can pass an object to a function and destructure it when it's passed in let's create a function we will create a function to display a person with the parameters we'll use destructuring we're destructuring an object we need a set of curly braces we'll receive an object such as this I'm going to invoke display person we'll pass in person one as an argument when we receive person one as an argument we'll destructure that object right away we will create a first name parameter last name age and job all we'll do is print a few lines using console.log I'll use a template string let's say Name colon space I'll add a placeholder first name and last name let's add a new line age call in space add a placeholder age then lastly job job colon space add a placeholder job we're passing in person one and D structuring it we should display name SpongeBob SquarePants age 30 job fry cook let's pass in person two as an argument name Patrick Star age 34 job is undefined again we can set a default value when destructuring if an object doesn't have a job property we will set that equal to be unemploy employed Patrick Star age 34 job unemployed then if we pass in person one again his job should not be unemployed he's a fry cook there is a job property so we do not use the default value all right everybody so those are a few examples of destructuring there's a lot you can do with destructuring you use a set of straight brackets to perform array destructuring or curly braces for object destructuring they allow you to extract values from arrays an object then assign them to variables in a convenient way and well that is destructuring in JavaScript
