00:00 - hey it's you bro hope you're doing well
00:02 - and in this video we're going to be
00:03 - discussing backgrounds in css
00:05 - so let's get into it
00:08 - so before we begin this video if you
00:10 - want to follow along just find a
00:12 - background image that you like and
00:14 - download it and for now
00:15 - put it in the same folder that contains
00:17 - your index html file
00:19 - and your style sheet so let's begin now
00:22 - we're going to be discussing how to add
00:24 - a
00:24 - background to your website this can be
00:27 - a background color or an image so to
00:30 - kick this off
00:31 - let's create a simple h1 header so
00:35 - h1 let's add some text perhaps
00:37 - background
00:38 - demo and then close this let's save
00:41 - reload and we just have some text
00:44 - now we're going to mostly be working on
00:46 - our style sheet
00:47 - now if you want to target the background
00:50 - of your website you can simply just
00:53 - target this
00:54 - body element however there's a better
00:57 - option than targeting the body
00:59 - and that's actually targeting the html
01:02 - element
01:03 - because that will pretty much cover
01:05 - everything so
01:06 - you can see here that pretty much
01:08 - everything is within the html tags
01:10 - so we're going to target this html tag
01:13 - for our style sheet
01:14 - now if you want to change the background
01:16 - color we've covered this already
01:18 - you just type in background color
01:21 - and this is a property and we can set
01:23 - this to a color
01:24 - like maybe green save reload the page
01:28 - oh there you go that's it lesson over
01:30 - just kidding and for colors you can also
01:32 - use
01:32 - an rgb value which is red green than
01:36 - blue
01:36 - just type in rgb then a set of
01:38 - parenthesis and there's
01:40 - three values that you can place within
01:41 - the parentheses here it's a number
01:43 - between
01:44 - 0 and 255 and depending on what value
01:47 - you place for each of these different
01:49 - positions
01:50 - this will add varying amounts of red
01:52 - green and blue
01:53 - so i'm just going to type in some random
01:55 - numbers i have no idea what this color
01:57 - is but
01:58 - we'll see what it is so i just made up
02:00 - the numbers 100
02:01 - 255 and 75 let's save reload the page
02:04 - and that's like a bright
02:06 - green lime color which is kind of
02:08 - interesting
02:09 - otherwise you can use hexadecimal values
02:12 - so
02:12 - you need a number symbol then you can
02:15 - type in a series of
02:17 - six digits like all zeros would be all
02:20 - black then
02:21 - all f's would be all white
02:24 - and you can look online for some
02:26 - hexadecimal values if there's anything
02:28 - you like
02:28 - let's talk about gradients a gradient is
02:31 - a gradual
02:32 - change from one color to another that's
02:35 - the best way i can explain it
02:36 - let's say that on our website we want
02:38 - the background color
02:40 - to start at one color and then by the
02:43 - end of the document
02:44 - it will become another color and it's
02:46 - going to gradually change colors kind of
02:48 - like a sunset
02:49 - you know how there's varying colors
02:51 - that's kind of what a gradient is
02:52 - it's just a gradual change in colors
02:55 - so this is what we can do to create a
02:57 - gradient effect
02:59 - type in background we'll use the
03:01 - background property
03:02 - linear dash gradient
03:06 - then a set of parenthesis let's start
03:08 - with two different colors
03:09 - we want a gradual shift from one color
03:12 - to another for our background
03:14 - let's say we want maybe gray and we want
03:17 - this to transition to
03:19 - black and you can use either rgb values
03:22 - or hexadecimal values here i'm just
03:24 - going with the words gray and black just
03:25 - because it's simple for this video
03:27 - so let's save reload all right so we're
03:31 - starting to get somewhere
03:32 - so what's going on here is that our
03:34 - background gradient
03:36 - is only extending as far down as we have
03:38 - substance on our website basically
03:41 - since we only have an h1 header tag the
03:44 - gradient is only going down so far
03:46 - if i were to add let's say a paragraph
03:49 - to this so
03:50 - if you're using sublime text you can
03:51 - just type in lorem and hit tab
03:53 - and save this well the gradient now
03:56 - extends
03:56 - for as much as we have text for other
03:59 - items
04:00 - on our website and then it will repeat
04:01 - itself every so often
04:03 - but if you want your gradient to extend
04:06 - to the entire
04:07 - window size these are the steps to do
04:10 - that so the first thing that we're going
04:11 - to do
04:12 - is that we're going to prevent our web
04:14 - browser from repeating
04:16 - this gradient every so often depending
04:19 - on
04:19 - how much text you have or other items on
04:22 - your website
04:22 - so background dash repeat
04:26 - then we'll set this to no repeat
04:30 - so this doesn't repeat anymore but we
04:32 - have all of this blank
04:33 - white space underneath all of the items
04:36 - on our website
04:37 - so there's a few other steps we're going
04:39 - to set the
04:40 - background dash position
04:44 - and we will center this this isn't
04:46 - really going to be noticeable
04:48 - quite yet but when we include background
04:50 - images it's going to be more noticeable
04:52 - so
04:53 - no apparent changes yet we will set the
04:57 - background dash size to
05:00 - cover again no noticeable changes
05:04 - and lastly we're going to set the
05:06 - background
05:07 - dash attachment
05:11 - to fixed and what this does is that
05:15 - it this determines if the background
05:17 - will scroll with the rest of the page
05:19 - or if it's fixed in place so when you
05:21 - combine all of these together
05:23 - all these properties what you get is
05:25 - that the gradient
05:26 - or your background image will extend to
05:28 - the full length of your browser window
05:31 - and if you were to resize this window
05:33 - it's actually going to
05:34 - expand naturally so that's what a lot of
05:37 - people tend to want they want their
05:38 - background
05:39 - image or color to extend to the full
05:41 - length of the browser window
05:44 - now if you would like to set an image as
05:46 - your background
05:47 - these are the steps so for now i'm going
05:49 - to comment
05:50 - out everything that we did here and
05:52 - we'll just use this as a reference and
05:54 - we'll start fresh
05:55 - so the first thing that we're going to
05:57 - do is that we're going to include a
05:58 - background image
06:00 - so background dash image
06:03 - colon url a set of parentheses
06:07 - now there's two things we can type in
06:09 - here either the file name
06:11 - if it's within the same folder for this
06:13 - example for me i put this in the same
06:15 - folder but
06:16 - in just a moment i'll show you where you
06:18 - can locate a
06:19 - image that's in a different location or
06:22 - a different folder
06:23 - so type in the name of the image here so
06:27 - i picked a file that was named space
06:30 - underscore
06:31 - small dot png
06:34 - let's save this reload the page all
06:36 - right here's my background
06:37 - but i'm going to change the font color
06:39 - because i can no longer read it and i'm
06:41 - just going to set that to
06:42 - white so one thing you might see is that
06:46 - with
06:46 - images for a web page all the images
06:48 - might be in a separate folder
06:50 - so we'll need to add the file path for
06:53 - where we can locate
06:54 - our background images so let's create a
06:56 - new folder so new
06:58 - folder and i will call this images and
07:00 - we're going to take our background
07:02 - in my case i have two uh here because
07:04 - i'm going to show you another example
07:06 - and we'll place it within a folder
07:08 - called images
07:10 - so now if we were to reload this page we
07:12 - can no longer
07:13 - locate this file so we'll actually have
07:15 - to add that folder here
07:17 - so we're going to type images or
07:19 - whatever else you named
07:20 - your folder then forward slash then the
07:23 - name of the file
07:24 - so if we were to reload this we can now
07:26 - see our background
07:28 - but for this example i'm just going to
07:30 - put everything back within the same
07:31 - folder as it was originally
07:33 - so let's expand this window all right so
07:36 - what's going on here is that
07:38 - this portion right here is the
07:40 - background image
07:41 - but it seems like it's repeating itself
07:44 - to fill in the entire
07:45 - width and height of your web browser too
07:48 - so what i would like to do
07:49 - is that i want to take this background
07:51 - image and have it extend
07:53 - to the full size of my browser window
07:56 - so it's going to be the same steps as
07:58 - before then the same that we did with
08:00 - the linear gradient
08:01 - the first thing that we're going to type
08:03 - is background
08:04 - dash repeat so i'm going to just place
08:07 - that here
08:08 - let's save reload the page so this is
08:11 - the
08:11 - original image that we have for our
08:13 - background
08:14 - and it's not repeating anymore but we
08:16 - still want this to take up the entire
08:18 - size of our browser window so the next
08:21 - thing we're going to do
08:22 - is set the background position to center
08:27 - alright so now this image is in the
08:31 - middle of our webpage
08:35 - we want this background size
08:38 - to be set to cover
08:41 - so now this background image covers the
08:44 - full width of the web browser however we
08:47 - still have this white space underneath
08:49 - it and then lastly we're going to set
08:51 - the background attachment
08:53 - to fixed and this determines if the
08:56 - background will scroll with the rest
08:58 - of the page or if it's fixed in place
09:01 - so when you combine all of these
09:03 - properties together what you end up with
09:05 - is a background image that takes up the
09:08 - entire
09:09 - size of your browser window which again
09:11 - is what people
09:12 - tend to want instead of just their
09:14 - background image only taking up
09:15 - like a certain portion of this window
09:18 - and with this background image
09:20 - the more you zoom in or the larger the
09:23 - window size
09:24 - the image itself will begin to lose some
09:25 - quality so you're better with using
09:28 - high resolution pictures but for this
09:30 - example i had a
09:32 - small version of the background image i
09:34 - wanted to use i'm going to switch this
09:36 - to a better larger resolution picture
09:39 - that i had
09:40 - and the file that i had was space
09:42 - underscore big
09:43 - so now the resolution of the picture is
09:45 - slightly better
09:46 - but you also have to be concerned with
09:48 - how large the image is
09:50 - that you want to use for a background
09:51 - because that might increase
09:53 - the low time for somebody viewing your
09:55 - page then
09:56 - so that's something to keep in mind but
09:58 - higher resolution pictures tend to be
10:00 - better if you're using it as a
10:02 - background image
10:03 - so that's the basics of adding a
10:04 - background color gradient or image to
10:07 - your web page as a whole
10:09 - now you can also add a background to
10:11 - specific html elements
10:13 - let's say that we want to change the
10:14 - background of our h1 header tag which we
10:17 - have at the top
10:18 - so we'll add that to our style sheet h1
10:20 - set of curly brackets
10:22 - let's add a linear gradient for the
10:24 - background
10:25 - so we'll type in background
10:28 - linear gradient
10:32 - parentheses and then we can type in the
10:34 - colors we want within the parentheses
10:36 - now you can have more than two before we
10:38 - just had gray and black
10:39 - we can add more colors let's say we want
10:42 - like a sunrise or a sunset effect
10:44 - we can type in red then orange and then
10:48 - yellow so let's see what this looks like
10:51 - that's pretty sweet
10:52 - but why stop there though we can make
10:54 - this a whole rainbow if we really wanted
10:56 - to
10:56 - so let's add a few other colors maybe
10:58 - green
11:00 - blue indigo
11:03 - and violet
11:06 - sweet that's a pretty cool looking
11:08 - rainbow it kind of reminds me of that
11:10 - meme i think it was called nion cat yeah
11:13 - this is it this is what this reminds me
11:15 - of
11:16 - assuming most people wouldn't want a
11:18 - rainbow background but
11:20 - for this tutorial series i'm going to
11:22 - include this because well it's my
11:23 - tutorial series and i can do what i want
11:25 - so now how about we change the
11:27 - background color of this paragraph that
11:29 - we have so let's go back to our html
11:31 - file and i need to surround our
11:33 - paragraph
11:34 - with a set of p tags and i'm assuming
11:36 - you probably do as well
11:37 - so make sure you include those we're
11:39 - going to list
11:41 - the p element as our target and let's
11:44 - change the
11:45 - background perhaps we'll use another
11:48 - linear gradient because there's a few
11:49 - other tricks that we can do too
11:51 - perhaps we will use the boring gray and
11:53 - black that we had previously so our
11:56 - gradient only targets
11:57 - this specific paragraph another trick
11:59 - with linear gradients
12:00 - is that you can have the colors flow in
12:02 - a different direction by default it
12:04 - starts at the top and the color
12:07 - eventually transitions
12:08 - to its second color when it reaches the
12:10 - bottom so you can actually change that
12:12 - direction
12:13 - like we can have gray start on the left
12:16 - and when it reaches the right
12:17 - it'll become our second color so within
12:20 - the parentheses we're going to type
12:21 - two right comma and now
12:25 - our first color is on the left and it
12:26 - eventually transitions to our second
12:28 - color
12:29 - on the right otherwise there's two top
12:34 - so it's kind of like these positions are
12:35 - reversed and
12:37 - two left so use whatever you want for
12:40 - your website
12:41 - i kind of like to write honestly that's
12:44 - pretty sweet
12:45 - here's one thing to consider what if you
12:47 - had a bunch of different paragraphs
12:49 - this is what this might end up looking
12:51 - like so i'm just going to take our
12:52 - current paragraph and just paste this
12:55 - maybe an additional three times so we
12:57 - have four paragraphs
12:59 - so each of these paragraphs has their
13:02 - own
13:02 - what looks like an individual box so if
13:05 - you don't want these
13:06 - basically blank empty spaces between
13:09 - each of these paragraphs
13:11 - what we can do is actually put all these
13:13 - paragraphs within its own container
13:15 - using a div tag
13:16 - so before the first paragraph we're
13:19 - going to begin
13:20 - a new div tag and we'll give this a
13:22 - unique id
13:23 - such as my text
13:27 - name this whatever you want really and
13:29 - then outside of the last paragraph we're
13:32 - going to
13:32 - close this div tag and within our style
13:35 - sheet we can target
13:37 - everything within the specific div tag
13:39 - so if you're targeting something with
13:41 - the unique id
13:42 - you need to put the number sign and the
13:44 - name
13:45 - of the div tag or whatever the name of
13:48 - the id was
13:49 - and i already forgot what it was my text
13:52 - okay
13:52 - so we're just going to type that here so
13:54 - my text set of curly brackets
13:57 - and i'm going to take our linear
13:58 - gradient that we had for our paragraphs
14:01 - and i am going to place it within
14:05 - my text now and we'll reload the page
14:08 - now we got rid of those empty spaces
14:11 - before and after
14:12 - each paragraph and it's all one uniform
14:15 - background basically
14:17 - one pretty unique feature about this is
14:19 - that if you have a scroll bar
14:21 - you'll notice that as we move up and
14:23 - down on our web page
14:24 - you'll notice that the actual background
14:27 - image is staying in place
14:28 - and all of our text is moving as if it
14:30 - was on some sort of track
14:32 - or rollers maybe it's kind of like
14:34 - there's two layers
14:35 - there's a background image and then
14:36 - there's all of our text that's moving
14:38 - so that's kind of cool to see so that's
14:40 - the basics of backgrounds in css
14:42 - if you would like a copy of the markup
14:44 - that we worked on today
14:46 - i'll post this in the comments down
14:47 - below and pin it to the top
14:49 - but yeah that's how you add a background
14:52 - in css

Cleaned transcript:

hey it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video we're going to be discussing backgrounds in css so let's get into it so before we begin this video if you want to follow along just find a background image that you like and download it and for now put it in the same folder that contains your index html file and your style sheet so let's begin now we're going to be discussing how to add a background to your website this can be a background color or an image so to kick this off let's create a simple h1 header so h1 let's add some text perhaps background demo and then close this let's save reload and we just have some text now we're going to mostly be working on our style sheet now if you want to target the background of your website you can simply just target this body element however there's a better option than targeting the body and that's actually targeting the html element because that will pretty much cover everything so you can see here that pretty much everything is within the html tags so we're going to target this html tag for our style sheet now if you want to change the background color we've covered this already you just type in background color and this is a property and we can set this to a color like maybe green save reload the page oh there you go that's it lesson over just kidding and for colors you can also use an rgb value which is red green than blue just type in rgb then a set of parenthesis and there's three values that you can place within the parentheses here it's a number between 0 and 255 and depending on what value you place for each of these different positions this will add varying amounts of red green and blue so i'm just going to type in some random numbers i have no idea what this color is but we'll see what it is so i just made up the numbers 100 255 and 75 let's save reload the page and that's like a bright green lime color which is kind of interesting otherwise you can use hexadecimal values so you need a number symbol then you can type in a series of six digits like all zeros would be all black then all f's would be all white and you can look online for some hexadecimal values if there's anything you like let's talk about gradients a gradient is a gradual change from one color to another that's the best way i can explain it let's say that on our website we want the background color to start at one color and then by the end of the document it will become another color and it's going to gradually change colors kind of like a sunset you know how there's varying colors that's kind of what a gradient is it's just a gradual change in colors so this is what we can do to create a gradient effect type in background we'll use the background property linear dash gradient then a set of parenthesis let's start with two different colors we want a gradual shift from one color to another for our background let's say we want maybe gray and we want this to transition to black and you can use either rgb values or hexadecimal values here i'm just going with the words gray and black just because it's simple for this video so let's save reload all right so we're starting to get somewhere so what's going on here is that our background gradient is only extending as far down as we have substance on our website basically since we only have an h1 header tag the gradient is only going down so far if i were to add let's say a paragraph to this so if you're using sublime text you can just type in lorem and hit tab and save this well the gradient now extends for as much as we have text for other items on our website and then it will repeat itself every so often but if you want your gradient to extend to the entire window size these are the steps to do that so the first thing that we're going to do is that we're going to prevent our web browser from repeating this gradient every so often depending on how much text you have or other items on your website so background dash repeat then we'll set this to no repeat so this doesn't repeat anymore but we have all of this blank white space underneath all of the items on our website so there's a few other steps we're going to set the background dash position and we will center this this isn't really going to be noticeable quite yet but when we include background images it's going to be more noticeable so no apparent changes yet we will set the background dash size to cover again no noticeable changes and lastly we're going to set the background dash attachment to fixed and what this does is that it this determines if the background will scroll with the rest of the page or if it's fixed in place so when you combine all of these together all these properties what you get is that the gradient or your background image will extend to the full length of your browser window and if you were to resize this window it's actually going to expand naturally so that's what a lot of people tend to want they want their background image or color to extend to the full length of the browser window now if you would like to set an image as your background these are the steps so for now i'm going to comment out everything that we did here and we'll just use this as a reference and we'll start fresh so the first thing that we're going to do is that we're going to include a background image so background dash image colon url a set of parentheses now there's two things we can type in here either the file name if it's within the same folder for this example for me i put this in the same folder but in just a moment i'll show you where you can locate a image that's in a different location or a different folder so type in the name of the image here so i picked a file that was named space underscore small dot png let's save this reload the page all right here's my background but i'm going to change the font color because i can no longer read it and i'm just going to set that to white so one thing you might see is that with images for a web page all the images might be in a separate folder so we'll need to add the file path for where we can locate our background images so let's create a new folder so new folder and i will call this images and we're going to take our background in my case i have two uh here because i'm going to show you another example and we'll place it within a folder called images so now if we were to reload this page we can no longer locate this file so we'll actually have to add that folder here so we're going to type images or whatever else you named your folder then forward slash then the name of the file so if we were to reload this we can now see our background but for this example i'm just going to put everything back within the same folder as it was originally so let's expand this window all right so what's going on here is that this portion right here is the background image but it seems like it's repeating itself to fill in the entire width and height of your web browser too so what i would like to do is that i want to take this background image and have it extend to the full size of my browser window so it's going to be the same steps as before then the same that we did with the linear gradient the first thing that we're going to type is background dash repeat so i'm going to just place that here let's save reload the page so this is the original image that we have for our background and it's not repeating anymore but we still want this to take up the entire size of our browser window so the next thing we're going to do is set the background position to center alright so now this image is in the middle of our webpage we want this background size to be set to cover so now this background image covers the full width of the web browser however we still have this white space underneath it and then lastly we're going to set the background attachment to fixed and this determines if the background will scroll with the rest of the page or if it's fixed in place so when you combine all of these properties together what you end up with is a background image that takes up the entire size of your browser window which again is what people tend to want instead of just their background image only taking up like a certain portion of this window and with this background image the more you zoom in or the larger the window size the image itself will begin to lose some quality so you're better with using high resolution pictures but for this example i had a small version of the background image i wanted to use i'm going to switch this to a better larger resolution picture that i had and the file that i had was space underscore big so now the resolution of the picture is slightly better but you also have to be concerned with how large the image is that you want to use for a background because that might increase the low time for somebody viewing your page then so that's something to keep in mind but higher resolution pictures tend to be better if you're using it as a background image so that's the basics of adding a background color gradient or image to your web page as a whole now you can also add a background to specific html elements let's say that we want to change the background of our h1 header tag which we have at the top so we'll add that to our style sheet h1 set of curly brackets let's add a linear gradient for the background so we'll type in background linear gradient parentheses and then we can type in the colors we want within the parentheses now you can have more than two before we just had gray and black we can add more colors let's say we want like a sunrise or a sunset effect we can type in red then orange and then yellow so let's see what this looks like that's pretty sweet but why stop there though we can make this a whole rainbow if we really wanted to so let's add a few other colors maybe green blue indigo and violet sweet that's a pretty cool looking rainbow it kind of reminds me of that meme i think it was called nion cat yeah this is it this is what this reminds me of assuming most people wouldn't want a rainbow background but for this tutorial series i'm going to include this because well it's my tutorial series and i can do what i want so now how about we change the background color of this paragraph that we have so let's go back to our html file and i need to surround our paragraph with a set of p tags and i'm assuming you probably do as well so make sure you include those we're going to list the p element as our target and let's change the background perhaps we'll use another linear gradient because there's a few other tricks that we can do too perhaps we will use the boring gray and black that we had previously so our gradient only targets this specific paragraph another trick with linear gradients is that you can have the colors flow in a different direction by default it starts at the top and the color eventually transitions to its second color when it reaches the bottom so you can actually change that direction like we can have gray start on the left and when it reaches the right it'll become our second color so within the parentheses we're going to type two right comma and now our first color is on the left and it eventually transitions to our second color on the right otherwise there's two top so it's kind of like these positions are reversed and two left so use whatever you want for your website i kind of like to write honestly that's pretty sweet here's one thing to consider what if you had a bunch of different paragraphs this is what this might end up looking like so i'm just going to take our current paragraph and just paste this maybe an additional three times so we have four paragraphs so each of these paragraphs has their own what looks like an individual box so if you don't want these basically blank empty spaces between each of these paragraphs what we can do is actually put all these paragraphs within its own container using a div tag so before the first paragraph we're going to begin a new div tag and we'll give this a unique id such as my text name this whatever you want really and then outside of the last paragraph we're going to close this div tag and within our style sheet we can target everything within the specific div tag so if you're targeting something with the unique id you need to put the number sign and the name of the div tag or whatever the name of the id was and i already forgot what it was my text okay so we're just going to type that here so my text set of curly brackets and i'm going to take our linear gradient that we had for our paragraphs and i am going to place it within my text now and we'll reload the page now we got rid of those empty spaces before and after each paragraph and it's all one uniform background basically one pretty unique feature about this is that if you have a scroll bar you'll notice that as we move up and down on our web page you'll notice that the actual background image is staying in place and all of our text is moving as if it was on some sort of track or rollers maybe it's kind of like there's two layers there's a background image and then there's all of our text that's moving so that's kind of cool to see so that's the basics of backgrounds in css if you would like a copy of the markup that we worked on today i'll post this in the comments down below and pin it to the top but yeah that's how you add a background in css hey you if you enjoyed this lesson then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like
