With timestamps:

00:00 - hey everybody in today's video I'm going
00:02 - to show you how we can insert data into
00:04 - a MySQL table using PHP at this point in
00:08 - the series I am assuming that you have
00:10 - already established a connection to your
00:12 - mySQL database if you haven't here's
00:14 - some code that will do that in my index
00:16 - file I have included the code to connect
00:19 - my database at the end of my script I am
00:22 - going to close this connection just
00:24 - because I know for a fact I'm going to
00:26 - forget to mention that so I'm doing it
00:28 - now to close a connection you can type
00:30 - my sqli
00:32 - underscore close then pass in the
00:36 - connection
00:38 - our connection is underlined because vs
00:41 - code doesn't recognize it because we're
00:43 - including it from another file but it
00:45 - should work just fine
00:46 - now what we're going to do is write an
00:48 - SQL query I'll store that within a
00:51 - variable
00:52 - SQL this will hold our query
00:55 - So within quotes we can write some SQL
00:58 - query of your choosing we'll do a basic
01:00 - insert
01:01 - insert into the name of the database my
01:05 - databases users
01:09 - then list the columns
01:11 - I will insert a username and a password
01:16 - list the column user
01:19 - password
01:24 - then some values
01:28 - we're going to start with just some
01:30 - plain text
01:32 - my username will be SpongeBob
01:35 - for my password
01:38 - let's say SpongeBob's password is
01:40 - pineapple1
01:41 - then to submit the query we can use the
01:44 - my sqli underscore query function
01:50 - then pass in our connection
01:54 - and our SQL query and that's it
01:58 - again vs code isn't going to recognize
02:00 - our connection because we're importing
02:02 - it if I were to run this query
02:05 - then refresh PHP in my admin
02:09 - we have our submission
02:11 - user ID of one it's set to Auto
02:13 - increment in this case
02:15 - the user is SpongeBob password pineapple
02:19 - and here's the registration date
02:21 - I set the registration date to be a
02:23 - current timestamp yes I am recording at
02:26 - two in the morning because I'm crazy
02:28 - let's say that for some reason we can't
02:31 - register a user maybe I forget a
02:33 - password
02:35 - well we get this fatal error fatal error
02:38 - uncaught mysqli exception
02:40 - we can surround our query with the try
02:42 - block we can try this code if there's
02:46 - any exceptions or errors that pop up we
02:48 - can handle them gracefully let's create
02:50 - a try block we will try some possibly
02:53 - dangerous code
02:55 - then handle any exceptions if they come
02:57 - up
02:59 - if this query is successful then let's
03:02 - Echo
03:05 - user is now registered
03:11 - if we encounter a problem let's catch
03:14 - that
03:15 - the exception we're catching is this one
03:17 - I'm going to copy it paste it
03:20 - then we will Echo
03:23 - could not register
03:27 - user
03:29 - oops I gotta fix that
03:31 - all right let's try this again
03:33 - my query is not technically correct but
03:36 - we should be able to handle that
03:37 - exception
03:39 - could not register a user
03:41 - as you can see here
03:43 - with our SQL query let's insert some
03:45 - variables let's declare two let's
03:48 - declare a username
03:50 - username equals
03:53 - Squidward this time
03:56 - and a password
03:58 - equals
04:03 - clarinet 2.
04:05 - with our values within single quotes we
04:09 - will list our variables
04:11 - username
04:14 - and password
04:17 - let's see if this works
04:20 - user is now registered then if we head
04:23 - to phpmyadmin refresh this table
04:26 - we now have an entry for Squidward with
04:29 - the password of clarinet2 art passwords
04:32 - are plain text it would be much better
04:34 - if we were to store a hash of a password
04:36 - just because you know these are plain
04:38 - text it's not secure
04:41 - so let's hash our password
04:45 - we'll create a hash
04:47 - equals we will use the password
04:50 - hash function
04:53 - the two arguments are the password
04:58 - and an option for an algorithm we will
05:00 - use the default
05:03 - password
05:04 - default
05:06 - technically we're using the bcrypt
05:08 - algorithm
05:09 - that's the default currently
05:11 - we will insert our username
05:13 - and our hash in place of our password
05:17 - let's change the username though let's
05:19 - assign
05:21 - Patrick
05:23 - his password will be rock3
05:28 - let's see if this works
05:31 - okay refresh PHP my admin
05:34 - and there is Patrick
05:36 - user ID3 username is Patrick
05:39 - here's the hash of the password
05:42 - and the registration date all right
05:44 - everybody so that's how to insert data
05:46 - into a MySQL table using PHP
