00:00 - hey guys in this video you're going to
00:02 - write your first c plus program so sit
00:05 - back relax and well enjoy the show
00:09 - hey if you wouldn't mind please like
00:11 - comment and subscribe one like equals
00:14 - one prayer for the youtube algorithm
00:17 - i'm gonna tell you why you need to learn
00:19 - c plus plus
00:20 - c plus plus is a fast language like
00:23 - really fast it's commonly used in
00:26 - advanced graphics applications a few
00:28 - examples would include adobe
00:30 - applications video editing software
00:33 - anything that's graphics intensive c
00:35 - plus plus is considered a middle level
00:37 - language therefore it's commonly used
00:39 - with embedded systems and most
00:41 - importantly it's commonly used with
00:43 - creating video games i like video games
00:46 - like a lot compared to other programming
00:48 - languages you could say that c plus plus
00:51 - is a middle level language programming
00:54 - languages tend to be on a spectrum the
00:56 - higher level of programming languages
00:58 - the more it resembles human language
01:00 - languages that are closer to being lower
01:02 - level resemble hardware instructions
01:04 - higher level languages such as python
01:06 - java and c-sharp are very easy to write
01:09 - with and to understand but they tend to
01:11 - be slower c plus and c they take a
01:14 - little more effort to write but they're
01:16 - very fast they have the benefit of
01:18 - working closely with machine hardware
01:20 - while still somewhat resembling human
01:22 - language just a fair warning there is a
01:24 - learning curve with c plus plus but if
01:26 - you can learn it it's worth it i did
01:28 - some research on glassdoor.com
01:30 - the average salary for a c plus software
01:33 - engineer is 124 000
01:36 - however i'm just going to say this right
01:38 - now watching this video by itself will
01:41 - not guarantee you a job it's a good
01:43 - entry point though you'll want to watch
01:45 - the video practice create a portfolio
01:48 - work on your job interview skills then
01:50 - you have a good chance of getting an
01:51 - entry level job but as you can see
01:53 - there's a lot of potential so why not
01:56 - learn c plus there's two things you'll
01:58 - need to get started one is a text editor
02:01 - a few options include but are not
02:03 - limited to would be
02:05 - vs code code blocks or even notepad vs
02:09 - code and code blocks are also considered
02:11 - ides integrated development environments
02:15 - they are a text editor as well as a
02:16 - workshop that contain a lot of useful
02:18 - developer tools in this video i'm going
02:21 - to show you how to download vs code but
02:23 - feel free to use any text editor that
02:25 - you're comfortable with secondly we'll
02:27 - need a compiler a compiler is a piece of
02:30 - software that will parse source code to
02:33 - machine instructions and that's really
02:35 - it if you're using windows or linux
02:37 - you'll probably want to go with gcc if
02:40 - you're running mac you'll probably go
02:41 - with clang okay clang has a really cool
02:44 - logo it's blue eyes white dragon so
02:47 - let's get started
02:48 - well alright then everybody now we are
02:50 - going to download vs code that text
02:52 - editor i was talking about head to this
02:54 - url code.visualstudio.com
02:58 - then select the correct download for
03:00 - your operating system i'm running
03:01 - windows i'll select windows then i will
03:04 - open this
03:06 - read the agreement yes i actually did
03:08 - read it that fast i accept the agreement
03:11 - next
03:12 - next
03:14 - next
03:15 - i'll create a desktop icon why not next
03:19 - and install we might as well launch it
03:22 - finish
03:24 - in vs code there's two extensions i
03:26 - would recommend go to the left toolbar
03:28 - underneath extensions we will look up c
03:32 - c plus plus
03:34 - and we would like to download this
03:36 - extension uh let's pretend that this
03:38 - wasn't already installed so i'm going to
03:40 - install it
03:41 - then the next extension i recommend is
03:44 - code
03:44 - runner
03:47 - here it is
03:48 - then just click this blue button to
03:49 - install it
03:51 - okay let's close out of this
03:54 - we're going to create a new folder to
03:56 - hold our c plus projects go to the left
03:58 - toolbar explore
04:00 - open folder i'll create a new folder on
04:03 - my desktop
04:05 - new
04:05 - folder i'll name this c plus plus
04:09 - projects
04:10 - that sounds good to me
04:12 - then select folder within this folder
04:15 - we'll create a new file
04:17 - i'll name this hello world dot cpp make
04:21 - sure to get that cpp extension at the
04:24 - end that means it's a c plus file okay
04:27 - we now have a c plus plus file to work
04:29 - with now we just need to download that
04:31 - compiler that parses source code to
04:34 - machine instructions
04:36 - there's a great set of instructions at
04:38 - this url
04:41 - dot code.visualstudio.com slash docs
04:43 - let's head to c plus plus there's
04:46 - different installation instructions
04:47 - depending on your operating system
04:49 - you'll be downloading gcc on linux if
04:52 - you're running linux gcc on windows for
04:55 - windows and clang for mac os downloading
04:58 - a compiler for linux and mac is actually
05:01 - really easy i can cover that in like 30
05:03 - seconds windows is a little more
05:05 - complicated but let's begin with linux
05:08 - so all you're going to do is open up
05:10 - terminal and enter the following command
05:13 - gcc
05:14 - v that will check to see if it's
05:16 - currently installed
05:17 - if it's not you enter this command in
05:20 - then you install the gnu compiler tools
05:23 - by typing in this command right here and
05:25 - that's all you need to do with linux
05:28 - if you're on mac you'll download clang
05:32 - open terminal
05:33 - type in this command
05:35 - if clang isn't installed all you type is
05:37 - this command and that's it so pretty
05:40 - easy right if you're using the windows
05:42 - operating system there's way more steps
05:45 - so let's head to step three we'll need
05:48 - to install min gw64
05:51 - you can click this link to the installer
05:54 - this is an executable i'll open this
05:56 - when it's done
05:58 - click next
06:00 - next
06:02 - next
06:03 - wait for it
06:04 - we might as well run this
06:06 - then finish
06:08 - now we will follow the installation
06:09 - instructions on this website
06:14 - under step 5 we will type
06:17 - pack man
06:19 - dash
06:20 - capital s y u enter
06:32 - type y then enter to proceed with the
06:35 - installation
06:40 - type y then enter again to confirm to
06:42 - proceed
06:44 - now we'll need to find this program from
06:45 - the start menu
06:47 - m sys2
06:49 - then type this command
06:52 - pack man
06:53 - dash s u enter
06:57 - type y then enter to proceed with the
06:59 - installation
07:04 - now we'll need to enter this command in
07:08 - there's a lot to type here
07:11 - pac-man dash s
07:14 - dash dash needed
07:17 - base
07:18 - dash
07:20 - dev l
07:23 - min
07:24 - gw
07:26 - dash w
07:27 - 64
07:29 - dash
07:30 - x
07:32 - 86
07:33 - underscore
07:34 - 64
07:36 - dash
07:38 - tool
07:39 - chain
07:40 - then enter
07:42 - then just hit enter
07:44 - proceed with the installation type yes
07:47 - type y
07:48 - enter again
07:50 - then give it a moment
07:53 - then we can close out of this window
07:55 - we'll have to find the bin folder of
07:58 - mingw
08:00 - it's likely going to be within your c
08:02 - drive go to m64
08:06 - mingw64
08:08 - bin
08:09 - then copy this address
08:12 - we'll need to add that path to the
08:14 - windows path environment variable
08:17 - to do so search settings
08:20 - settings
08:24 - we'll search edit environment variables
08:32 - go to path
08:33 - edit
08:35 - let's pretend that this wasn't here
08:38 - i'm going to go to new
08:40 - paste that address
08:42 - okay
08:44 - okay
08:45 - close out of this window
08:47 - just to be sure that our compiler is
08:49 - working and available let's open up
08:51 - command prompt
08:52 - command prompt
08:56 - then type in this command
08:58 - g
08:58 - plus plus
09:00 - dash dash
09:01 - version
09:03 - enter
09:06 - yeah it looks like it's good to go we
09:07 - have now successfully installed our
09:09 - compiler
09:11 - all right everybody let's write our
09:12 - first c plus plus program at the top of
09:15 - our c plus file we are going to type
09:19 - include
09:20 - within angle brackets
09:22 - io
09:23 - stream io stream is a header file that
09:26 - contains functions for basic input and
09:29 - output operations by writing include
09:31 - iostream we're including that header
09:33 - file then we have access to a whole
09:35 - bunch of useful input and output
09:37 - operations now we'll need a main
09:39 - function the main function is where the
09:41 - program begins we'll type int
09:44 - main
09:45 - parentheses curly braces
09:47 - we begin the program by invoking the
09:49 - main function
09:50 - and read any code within the main
09:52 - function starting at the top and working
09:54 - our way down at the end of our main
09:56 - function we'll want return
09:59 - 0 then add a semicolon if we reach
10:02 - return 0 that means there were no
10:04 - problems in this program however if 1 is
10:07 - returned that means there was a problem
10:09 - there is an issue so place return 0 at
10:12 - the end of your main function what we'll
10:14 - do in this lesson is write some basic
10:15 - output to write some output you'll type
10:18 - std contrary to what you might believe
10:21 - in this case it doesn't mean sexually
10:23 - transmitted diseases it means standard
10:26 - follow std with two colons then type
10:30 - c out c means character out means output
10:34 - altogether this means standard character
10:37 - output we're going to display some
10:39 - characters as output then follow c out
10:42 - with two left angle brackets these
10:44 - characters mean output it's also known
10:46 - as the left shift operator when used
10:48 - with numbers what characters would we
10:50 - like to display as output within
10:52 - quotation marks let's write something
10:54 - what's a food you like
10:56 - i like pizza i'll type that then follow
11:00 - this statement with a semicolon at the
11:02 - end of statements we add a semicolon
11:04 - that lets the compiler know that this
11:06 - statement is done it's sort of like the
11:08 - period at the end of a sentence that's
11:10 - when you know the sentence is complete
11:12 - so i'm going to save this i'll hold ctrl
11:15 - s or you can go to file save then click
11:18 - this button to run it
11:20 - and there's my output i like pizza
11:23 - on the next line i'll type std
11:26 - two colons c out two left angle brackets
11:30 - for output i'll write a second line
11:34 - it's really
11:36 - good
11:38 - then i'll run this again you can press
11:40 - this icon to clear your output
11:43 - uh oh we have a problem i like pizza
11:46 - it's really good all of this text is on
11:48 - one line what if you need the next line
11:50 - of text to be on well the next line when
11:52 - you need to move your cursor down to the
11:54 - next line you can follow some string of
11:56 - text with
11:58 - double left angle brackets
12:00 - for output
12:02 - std
12:04 - colon colon
12:05 - en dl that means end line
12:09 - and i'll do the same for my second line
12:11 - i'm going to save clear my output run
12:14 - this again
12:15 - yeah there we go i like pizza it's
12:18 - really good each line of text is on a
12:20 - different line another option for a new
12:22 - line that's better performance wise
12:25 - is to add a new line character
12:27 - within single quotes type
12:29 - backslash n
12:31 - and let's replace that here as well
12:34 - so i'm going to save clear my output run
12:37 - this again
12:38 - i like pizza it's really good adding a
12:41 - new line character does the same thing
12:43 - and it's better performance wise however
12:45 - the benefit of using endline is that end
12:48 - line will flush the output buffer really
12:51 - you can use either one but i thought
12:52 - that might be a nice trick to show you
12:54 - now you can write a comment a comment is
12:56 - ignored by the compiler
12:58 - to write a comment you use two forward
13:00 - slashes
13:03 - this is a
13:04 - comment comments are used for yourself
13:07 - for notes or for notes for another
13:09 - developer so if i were to run this again
13:13 - this comment is ignored it's not used as
13:15 - output or anything like that if you need
13:17 - a multi-line comment you type forward
13:20 - slash asterisk wherever you need your
13:22 - comment to end you'll place asterisk
13:25 - forward slash again
13:27 - this
13:29 - is
13:30 - a
13:32 - multi-line
13:35 - comment
13:36 - and you can see that all of this is
13:38 - ignored as well so comments are used as
13:40 - notes for yourself or for other
13:42 - developers yeah that's a quick
13:44 - introduction to getting started with c
13:47 - plus plus i'll post this code in the
13:48 - comment section down below if you would
13:50 - like a copy hey if you enjoyed this
13:52 - video please be sure to smash that like
13:54 - button leave a random comment down below
13:56 - and subscribe if you'd like to become a
13:57 - fellow bro

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys in this video you're going to write your first c plus program so sit back relax and well enjoy the show hey if you wouldn't mind please like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm i'm gonna tell you why you need to learn c plus plus c plus plus is a fast language like really fast it's commonly used in advanced graphics applications a few examples would include adobe applications video editing software anything that's graphics intensive c plus plus is considered a middle level language therefore it's commonly used with embedded systems and most

you a job it's a good entry point though you'll want to watch the video practice create a portfolio work on your job interview skills then you have a good chance of getting an entry level job but as you can see there's a lot of potential so why not learn c plus there's two things you'll need to get started one is a text editor a few options include but are not limited to would be vs code code blocks or even notepad vs code and code blocks are also considered ides integrated development environments they are a text editor as well as a workshop that contain a lot of useful developer tools in this video i'm going to show you how to download vs code but feel free to use any text editor that you're comfortable with secondly we'll need a compiler a compiler is a piece of software that will parse source code to machine instructions and that's really it if you're using windows or linux you'll probably want to go with gcc if you're running mac you'll probably go with clang okay clang has a really cool logo it's blue eyes white dragon so let's get started well alright then everybody now we are going to download vs code that text editor i was talking about head to this url code.visualstudio.com then select the correct download for your operating system i'm running windows i'll select windows then i will open this read the agreement yes i actually did read it that fast i accept the agreement next next next i'll create a desktop icon why not next and install we might as well launch it finish in vs code there's two extensions i would recommend go to the left toolbar underneath extensions we will look up c c plus plus and we would like to download this extension uh let's pretend that this wasn't already installed so i'm going to install it then the next extension i recommend is code runner here it is then just click this blue button to install it okay let's close out of this we're going to create a new folder to hold our c plus projects go to the left toolbar explore open folder i'll create a new folder on my desktop new folder i'll name this c plus plus projects that sounds good to me then select folder within this folder we'll create a new file i'll name this hello world dot cpp make sure to get that cpp extension at the end that means it's a c plus file okay we now have a c plus plus file to work with now we just need to download that compiler that parses source code to machine instructions there's a great set of instructions at this url dot code.visualstudio.com slash docs let's head to c plus plus there's different installation instructions depending on your operating system you'll be downloading gcc on linux if you're running linux gcc on windows for windows and clang for mac os downloading a compiler for linux and mac is actually really easy i can cover that in like 30 seconds windows is a little more complicated but let's begin with linux so all you're going to do is open up terminal and enter the following command gcc v that will check to see if it's currently installed if it's not you enter this command in then you install the gnu compiler tools by typing in this command right here and that's all you need to do with linux if you're on mac you'll download clang open terminal type in this command if clang isn't installed all you type is this command and that's it so pretty easy right if you're using the windows operating system there's way more steps so let's head to step three we'll need to install min gw64 you can click this link to the installer this is an executable i'll open this when it's done click next next next wait for it we might as well run this then finish now we will follow the installation instructions on this website under step 5 we will type pack man dash capital s y u enter type y then enter to proceed with the installation type y then enter again to confirm to proceed now we'll need to find this program from the start menu m sys2 then type this command pack man dash s u enter type y then enter to proceed with the installation now we'll need to enter this command in there's a lot to type here pacman dash s dash dash needed base dash dev l min gw dash w 64 dash x 86 underscore 64 dash tool chain then enter then just hit enter proceed with the installation type yes type y enter again then give it a moment then we can close out of this window we'll have to find the bin folder of mingw it's likely going to be within your c drive go to m64 mingw64 bin then copy this address we'll need to add that path to the windows path environment variable to do so search settings settings we'll search edit environment variables go to path edit let's pretend that this wasn't here i'm going to go to new paste that address okay okay close out of this window just to be sure that our compiler is working and available let's open up command prompt command prompt then type in this command g plus plus dash dash version enter yeah it looks like it's good to go we have now successfully installed our compiler all right everybody let's write our first c plus plus program at the top of our c plus file we are going to type include within angle brackets io stream io stream is a header file that contains functions for basic input and output operations by writing include iostream we're including that header file then we have access to a whole bunch of useful input and output operations now we'll need a main function the main function is where the program begins we'll type int main parentheses curly braces we begin the program by invoking the main function and read any code within the main function starting at the top and working our way down at the end of our main function we'll want return 0 then add a semicolon if we reach return 0 that means there were no problems in this program however if 1 is returned that means there was a problem there is an issue so place return 0 at the end of your main function what we'll do in this lesson is write some basic output to write some output you'll type std contrary to what you might believe in this case it doesn't mean sexually transmitted diseases it means standard follow std with two colons then type c out c means character out means output altogether this means standard character output we're going to display some characters as output then follow c out with two left angle brackets these characters mean output it's also known as the left shift operator when used with numbers what characters would we like to display as output within quotation marks let's write something what's a food you like i like

pizza on the next line i'll type std two colons c out two left angle brackets for output i'll write a second line it's really good then i'll run this again you can press this icon to clear your output uh oh we have a problem i like pizza it's really good all of this text is on one line what if you need the next line of text to be on well the next line when you need to move your cursor down to the

wherever you need your comment to end you'll place asterisk forward slash again this is a multiline comment and you can see that all of this is ignored as well so comments are used as notes for yourself or for other developers yeah that's a quick introduction to getting started with c plus plus i'll post this code in the comment section down below if you would like a copy hey if you enjoyed
