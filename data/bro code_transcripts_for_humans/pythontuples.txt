00:00 - hey what's going on people it's you bro
00:02 - hope you're doing well and in this video
00:03 - i'm going to explain tuples in python so
00:06 - sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:10 - if you wouldn't mind please like comment
00:13 - and subscribe
00:14 - one like equals one prayer for the
00:16 - youtube algorithm
00:18 - so tuples they are collections which are
00:21 - ordered and unchangeable
00:23 - they're very similar to lists but
00:24 - they're ordered and we can't change them
00:26 - they're useful for grouping together
00:28 - related data let's say we
00:30 - would like to create some sort of
00:31 - student record so we can create a tuple
00:34 - to take care of that for us
00:35 - so let's say we would like to create a
00:37 - tuple called student the process of
00:39 - creating a tuple is very similar to
00:41 - lists but
00:42 - instead of using a set of square
00:44 - brackets to place all of the values
00:46 - within
00:47 - we're going to use a set of parentheses
00:49 - and now we can add a bunch of values
00:51 - related to
00:52 - this collection of student so let's add
00:54 - some student information
00:56 - let's say that this student's name is
00:57 - bro let's give him an age
00:59 - as well as a gender all right so there
01:02 - you have it we now have a tuple
01:04 - called student and let's take a look at
01:06 - some of the functions related to tuples
01:08 - and you can access them by typing
01:10 - student
01:11 - dot and then there are a few here not as
01:13 - many as lists we have count
01:15 - and we have index so we can find the
01:17 - count of how many times
01:18 - a value appears let's count how many
01:21 - times
01:22 - the value of bro appears so we'll need
01:25 - to put this within a print statement so
01:27 - we can actually see it
01:29 - so bro appears
01:32 - one time within this tuple there is also
01:34 - an index method as well
01:36 - so type the name of your tuple dot and
01:40 - we will use the index method
01:42 - we can find the index of a certain value
01:44 - let's say we would like to find
01:46 - the index of mail and then i will just
01:48 - print this to the console window
01:51 - so the index of the value male would be
01:54 - at two zero one
01:57 - two that's it for the methods available
02:00 - to tuples
02:01 - a few tricks that you can do with tuples
02:03 - is that you can display
02:05 - all of the contents within a tuple using
02:07 - a for loop
02:08 - let's say for x in student
02:12 - we will print x so
02:15 - this will iterate once through all the
02:17 - values found within our tuple
02:19 - of student and we can also check to see
02:22 - if a certain value
02:23 - exists within our tuple using an if
02:25 - statement let's say
02:26 - if bro
02:29 - in student if this is true then what do
02:33 - we want to do
02:34 - let's say print bro is
02:37 - here all right so since bro
02:40 - is within here this will be true and
02:43 - this will print
02:44 - our statement of bro is here all right
02:47 - everybody like i said this is a
02:49 - super quick video on tuples they're very
02:52 - similar to
02:52 - lists except they are ordered and
02:55 - unchangeable
02:56 - if you'd like a copy of all this code i
02:58 - will post all of this in the comments
03:00 - down below
03:00 - and don't forget to smash that like
03:02 - button drop a comment
03:04 - down below and subscribe if you'd like
03:05 - to become a fellow bro
