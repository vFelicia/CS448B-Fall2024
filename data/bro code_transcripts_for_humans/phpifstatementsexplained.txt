00:00 - hey welcome back everybody in today's
00:01 - video I'm going to discuss if statements
00:04 - in PHP with the if statement we have a
00:06 - condition if some condition is true we
00:09 - can do something we can run some code
00:11 - however if that condition is false then
00:14 - we don't do it here's a situation
00:16 - suppose we have a website but you have
00:19 - to be 18 years or older to enter we can
00:21 - write a program to check somebody's age
00:24 - let's say we have a variable age age
00:26 - will equal make up a number 21. to write
00:30 - a if statement I would type if
00:33 - then I'll need a condition within
00:35 - parentheses what are we checking let's
00:38 - check to see if our variable age is
00:41 - greater than or equal to 18 then after
00:45 - the set of parentheses add a set of
00:47 - curly braces
00:48 - if this condition is true we can execute
00:51 - some code if it's false we skip over
00:54 - this code so if our age is greater than
00:57 - or equal to 18
00:59 - let's Echo
01:02 - you may enter this site
01:06 - so I'm going to save
01:09 - run this program you may enter the site
01:11 - what if this condition was false maybe
01:14 - my age is 15.
01:18 - in our if statement this condition is
01:20 - false that means we do not execute this
01:23 - code we skip over it as if it never even
01:26 - happened if you would rather do some
01:28 - other code at the end of your if
01:30 - statement you can add else then add a
01:32 - set of curly braces if this condition is
01:36 - false then skip over this code and
01:39 - execute the else statement
01:41 - instead let's Echo you must be 18 plus 2
01:48 - enter
01:50 - let's save
01:52 - and here's our other message you must be
01:54 - 18 plus to enter
01:56 - if I were to change age to 21 something
01:59 - that's above or equal to 18
02:01 - well we execute the first statement this
02:04 - portion of our if statement you may
02:06 - enter the site if this is true do this
02:09 - if not do this instead between if and
02:12 - else you can add else if
02:15 - else
02:17 - if add a set of parentheses and a set of
02:19 - curly braces if our condition is false
02:22 - we would then check any else if
02:24 - statements before resorting to the else
02:27 - statement let's also check if age
02:31 - is equal to zero double equals is the
02:36 - comparison operator you could check to
02:37 - see if two values are equal you don't
02:40 - want to use a single equal sign because
02:42 - that is the assignment operator PHP
02:44 - thinks you're assigning age to be zero
02:47 - use double equals for comparison
02:50 - if somebody's age is zero then let's
02:53 - Echo a different message
02:58 - you were just
03:01 - born
03:03 - I will set variable age to be zero save
03:07 - you were just born
03:10 - this condition was false we skip it this
03:14 - condition was true so we execute it we
03:16 - never reached the else statement however
03:19 - somebody types in negative one
03:22 - well then we resort to the else
03:23 - statement because both of these
03:25 - conditions are false
03:27 - let's change our else if statement let's
03:29 - say
03:30 - else if age is less than or equal to
03:34 - zero let's change this message
03:38 - that wasn't a valid
03:43 - age
03:45 - negative one is not a valid age
03:49 - just to be funny what if we said you
03:51 - were too old too old to enter this site
03:53 - I'll add another else if statement just
03:56 - to demonstrate that we can add multiple
03:58 - else if statements
04:00 - else if
04:02 - age
04:03 - is greater than or equal to 100.
04:07 - then we will Echo
04:12 - you are too old to enter this site
04:17 - if I were to set age to be 101
04:22 - the result states that you may enter
04:24 - this site
04:26 - the reason that we're executing this if
04:28 - statement and not this else if statement
04:30 - is because starting from the top we
04:33 - check the if statement first if it's
04:35 - false we continue down the line until we
04:38 - reach else
04:40 - age is 101 since this statement is
04:43 - technically true
04:45 - we would execute this code then skip
04:48 - everything else
04:49 - the order of your if and else if
04:51 - statements does matter
04:53 - I'm going to move this section of code
04:55 - to the beginning and make it the if
04:57 - statement
05:00 - first let's check to see if somebody's
05:02 - age is greater than or equal to 100
05:05 - I will change this section to be
05:08 - else if
05:09 - and that should work
05:11 - you are too old to enter the site
05:14 - you do need to pay attention to the
05:15 - order of your conditions I'll give you
05:18 - another example
05:20 - if statements also work with Boolean
05:22 - variables and values we have a variable
05:25 - adult adult will equal a Boolean value
05:29 - of either true
05:31 - or false let's set that to be true
05:36 - with your condition
05:37 - you can check to see if your variable
05:41 - is equal use double equals for
05:43 - comparison true or false
05:47 - if adult is equal to true
05:50 - then we will Echo
05:54 - you may enter this site adult is true
06:00 - you may enter the site if adult is false
06:05 - then nothing happens so let's add else
06:09 - Echo
06:11 - you must be an adult to enter
06:16 - you must be an adult to enter
06:19 - now there is a shorthand if you're using
06:21 - the comparison operator followed by a
06:24 - Boolean value
06:25 - you could just write the Boolean
06:27 - variable itself
06:29 - that is also valid and that's my
06:31 - preferred way of using Boolean variables
06:33 - within a condition if adult
06:36 - do something
06:37 - so let's set adult to be true
06:40 - you may enter this site
06:42 - if it's false you must be an adult to
06:45 - enter
06:46 - so that is the second example
06:49 - let's go over and exercise
06:51 - we will create a program to calculate
06:54 - somebody's pay including overtime we
06:57 - will need three variables
06:59 - hours
07:01 - I'll set that to be 40 to begin with
07:04 - they're working full-time a rate as in a
07:07 - rate of pay
07:09 - this person is making fifteen dollars
07:11 - per hour
07:12 - and then a weekly pay
07:16 - I will set that to be null to begin with
07:18 - depending on somebody's hours they may
07:21 - or may not make overtime pay or if they
07:24 - work zero hours they don't receive any
07:26 - pay this week first let's calculate
07:28 - their weekly pay if they work 40 hours
07:31 - or less
07:33 - if
07:34 - hours is less than or equal to 40
07:39 - then we will calculate our weekly pay
07:43 - with this formula
07:44 - it's only hours times their rate rate of
07:49 - pay
07:51 - then at the end let's Echo
07:56 - you made at our placeholder
07:59 - this week
08:02 - within our placeholder let's display the
08:04 - weekly pay variable
08:07 - pick your unit of currency I'll use
08:09 - American dollars I'll need to add an
08:11 - escape sequence
08:13 - 40 times 15 I think that's 600. you made
08:17 - six hundred dollars this week if we
08:19 - worked 20 hours then we make half of
08:21 - that three hundred dollars
08:23 - what if somebody doesn't work this week
08:25 - you made zero dollars this week
08:28 - what if somebody enters in a negative
08:30 - amount of hours like negative one
08:32 - well somebody made negative money this
08:34 - week let's write a condition to prevent
08:37 - that
08:38 - let's add an if statement
08:41 - then change this statement to be an else
08:44 - if statement
08:46 - if somebody is ours
08:51 - are less than or equal to zero
08:55 - then let's set weekly pay to be zero
08:58 - just in case somebody enters in a
09:01 - negative amount of hours because you
09:02 - can't work a negative amount even if
09:04 - somebody enters in a negative number
09:06 - like negative one or negative 10 our
09:08 - message still displays zero which is
09:10 - what we want
09:12 - lastly let's calculate overtime pay
09:15 - we'll do this within an else statement
09:17 - here's the formula let's set weekly
09:21 - pay equal to the first 40 hours are
09:25 - going to be at the standard rate
09:28 - let's take our rate
09:30 - times 40.
09:32 - then we will add within a set of
09:34 - parentheses we need to calculate the
09:37 - overtime pay maybe an employee Works 50
09:40 - hours this week
09:41 - let's take
09:43 - hours minus 40.
09:46 - I'm going to add another set of
09:47 - parentheses around this
09:51 - multiplied
09:53 - by
09:54 - rate
09:56 - times 1.5
09:59 - because with overtime pay at least in
10:01 - the United States I believe you make one
10:03 - and a half times your pay your hourly
10:05 - rate of pay if an employee Works 50
10:08 - hours this week their new weekly pay
10:10 - will be
10:12 - 825 dollars that is an exercise
10:15 - involving if statements
10:17 - and those are if statements in PHP

variable age is greater than or equal to 18 then after the set of parentheses add a set of curly braces if this condition is true we can execute some code if it's false we skip over this code so if our age is greater than or equal to 18 let's Echo you may enter this site so I'm going to save run this program you may enter the site what if this condition was false maybe my age is 15. in our if statement this condition is false that means we do not execute this code we skip over it as if it never even happened if you would rather do some other code at the end of your if statement you can add else then add a set of curly braces if this condition is false then skip over this code and execute the else statement instead let's Echo you must be 18 plus 2 enter let's save and here's our other message you must be 18 plus to enter if I were to change age to 21 something that's above or equal to 18 well we execute the first statement this portion of our if statement you may enter the site if this is true do this if not do this instead between if and else you can add else if else if add a set of parentheses and a set of curly braces if our condition is false we would then check any else if statements before resorting to the else statement let's also check if age is equal to zero double equals is the comparison operator you could check to see if two values are equal you don't want to use

you were just born I will set variable age to be zero save you were just born this condition was false we skip it this condition was true so we execute it we never reached the else statement however somebody types in negative one well then we resort to the else statement because both of these conditions are false let's change our else if statement let's say else if age is less than or equal to zero let's change this message that wasn't a valid age negative one is not a valid age just to be funny what if we said you were too old too old to enter this site I'll add another else if statement just to demonstrate that we can add multiple else if statements else if age is greater than or equal to 100. then we will Echo you are too old to enter this site if I were to set age to be 101 the result states that you may enter this site the reason that we're executing this if statement and not this else if statement is because starting from the top we check the if statement first if it's
