00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's your
00:01 - bro here hope you're doing well
00:03 - and in this video i'm going to teach you
00:04 - guys how we can create buttons in python
00:06 - so sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:11 - if you find this video helpful please
00:13 - remember to like
00:14 - comment and subscribe your support will
00:17 - help keep this channel running
00:19 - buttons you click them and then they do
00:21 - stuff that's pretty much it
00:23 - so this is how to create a button in
00:24 - python we'll need a window
00:26 - window equals tk followed by window.main
00:29 - loop let's call our button
00:31 - just button and in order to create this
00:33 - we'll follow this with
00:34 - equals button and within the constructor
00:38 - for this button we're going to list what
00:40 - we want to add this button to
00:42 - what is the master the master is the
00:44 - window
00:45 - and in order to display this button
00:47 - we're going to follow this with
00:49 - button dot pack
00:52 - and we should have a small rectangular
00:55 - button within our window
00:56 - but it doesn't display any text nor does
00:59 - it do anything
01:00 - so let's add some text and there is an
01:02 - option to do that
01:03 - within the constructor we're going to
01:05 - list the option for text
01:06 - and set this to whatever text you want
01:08 - to display let's
01:10 - say click me and then when we run this
01:13 - our button now says the text that we set
01:16 - and it says
01:16 - click me however it currently doesn't do
01:19 - anything though
01:20 - we need to set a command that is another
01:22 - option
01:23 - command equals and we list a function
01:26 - name this is what's known as a callback
01:29 - so let's create a function called
01:31 - click and then outside of the window
01:33 - let's define what our click
01:35 - function does def click
01:38 - and let's print a message you
01:41 - clicked the button
01:45 - now with the command we're going to list
01:48 - the
01:49 - function name without the parentheses so
01:51 - make sure you're writing it as
01:53 - this and not that this is what's known
01:55 - as a callback
01:57 - so when we click on this button it's
01:59 - going to perform our callback
02:02 - and perform whatever is within our
02:04 - function
02:05 - click just like that let's customize the
02:08 - appearance of this button
02:09 - i'm going to change the font that is
02:11 - another option
02:12 - font equals and let's pick a
02:16 - professional font
02:17 - such as comic sans it's very
02:20 - professional
02:21 - and i'll set a size of 30
02:24 - and now you can actually read what's on
02:26 - this button it's large enough
02:29 - let's set the foreground color that is
02:31 - the font color fg
02:33 - you can place a color name or a hex
02:35 - value here
02:36 - i'll pick green that is 0 0 ff00
02:40 - and our text should now be green which
02:43 - it
02:43 - is let's also change the background
02:46 - color
02:47 - that is bg i will pick the color name of
02:50 - black
02:51 - and now we have green text on a black
02:54 - background
02:55 - notice that when i click on this button
02:57 - or hold my mouse button down
02:59 - the color scheme has changed that's
03:01 - because there is a different active
03:03 - foreground and
03:04 - active background and we can change
03:06 - those too so that this won't flash every
03:08 - time you click on the button
03:10 - so let's change the active foreground
03:12 - and active background
03:14 - those are other options active
03:16 - foreground
03:17 - and i'll set this to the same color as
03:19 - my foreground
03:21 - which is green so the text color is
03:24 - going to stay the same
03:25 - and i'll also change the active
03:27 - background
03:30 - and i will also set this to black to
03:32 - match my
03:33 - background and then this should no
03:36 - longer flash
03:37 - when we click on our button
03:40 - if you need to disable somebody from
03:42 - clicking on this button
03:43 - there is an option to do so and that
03:45 - option is the
03:47 - state option and normally this is active
03:50 - but you can set this to disabled and we
03:53 - can no longer click on this button
03:55 - and you can see that the color scheme
03:57 - has changed too it's all grayed out and
03:59 - whatnot
04:00 - so i'm going to replace this back with
04:02 - active because we still have a few more
04:04 - things to do
04:05 - now how do we add an image to a button
04:07 - there is an
04:08 - image option and we set this equal to a
04:11 - photo image
04:12 - but first we need to create a photo
04:13 - image i have this photo of
04:16 - a like button a thumbs up that i want to
04:18 - use i need to create a photo image from
04:20 - this image file
04:21 - so within the window let's call this
04:23 - photo image just
04:25 - photo photo equals
04:29 - photo image then i'm going to list the
04:32 - file path or the file name
04:34 - since this image is within my same
04:36 - project folder
04:37 - i only have to list the file name and
04:40 - this is called
04:41 - like.png but if you use your own image
04:43 - it's probably going to be named
04:44 - something else
04:46 - then i need to set the image equal to my
04:48 - photo image which i named
04:50 - photo but the photo replaces
04:54 - the text on this button but it still
04:56 - works the same so we would like to
04:58 - display some text
04:59 - as well as our image we need to use the
05:01 - compound
05:02 - option and we list a direction
05:06 - we can list top bottom left right we
05:10 - want this
05:10 - image to be on the perhaps bottom so
05:13 - let's
05:13 - list the bottom and now when we run this
05:16 - we have
05:17 - our text as well as our image and if we
05:19 - changed compound to a different
05:21 - direction like
05:22 - top then the image is going to be
05:24 - displayed
05:25 - on the top relative to the text
05:29 - what if we wanted to count the amount of
05:31 - times that we clicked this button
05:32 - we could create a variable called count
05:35 - and we'll set this equal to
05:36 - zero but in order for us to access this
05:39 - count variable
05:41 - within the function of click we're going
05:44 - to list
05:45 - count as global so that this is a global
05:49 - variable
05:50 - every time we click this button let's
05:52 - increment
05:53 - our variable count by one by saying
05:55 - count plus
05:56 - equals one and then we will print
05:58 - whatever the value of count is
06:01 - so within a print statement we'll just
06:03 - say count
06:04 - now when we click on this button we have
06:06 - access to our count
06:07 - variable that's outside of this function
06:10 - and every time we click on this button
06:11 - it's going to increase our count
06:14 - variable by
06:15 - one well everybody that's the basics of
06:18 - creating
06:18 - buttons in python if you want to copy of
06:20 - all this code i'll post all of this in
06:22 - the comments down below
06:24 - but yeah that's the basics of buttons in
06:26 - python
06:28 - hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you
06:31 - learn something new
06:32 - then you can help me help you in three
06:35 - easy steps
06:36 - by smashing that like button drop a
06:38 - comment down below
06:39 - and subscribe if you'd like to become a
06:41 - fellow bro

how to create a button in python we'll need a window window equals tk followed by window.main loop let's call our button just button and in order to create this we'll follow this with equals button

font color fg you can place a color name or a hex value here i'll pick green that is 0 0 ff00 and our text should now be green which it is let's also change the background color that is bg i will pick the color name of black and now we have green text on a black background notice that when i click on this button or hold my mouse button down the color scheme has changed that's because there is a different active foreground and active background and we can change those too so that this won't flash every time you click on the button so let's change the active foreground and active background those are other options active foreground and i'll set this to the same color as my foreground which is green so the text color is going to stay the same and i'll also change the active background and i will also set this to black to match my background and then this should no longer flash when we click on our button if you need to disable somebody from clicking on this button there is an option to do so and that option is the state option and normally this is active but you can set this to disabled and we can no longer click on this button and you can see that the color scheme has changed too
