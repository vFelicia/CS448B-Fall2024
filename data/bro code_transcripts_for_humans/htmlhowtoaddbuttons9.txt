00:00 - well it's up everybody its you bro here
and in this video I'm gonna teach you
00:03 - guys how to create buttons using HTML
let's get into it
00:09 - buttons maybe heard of them you push
them and they do something what will
00:14 - they do that has yet to be determined so
in this video I'm gonna teach you guys
00:18 - how we can create buttons on a web page
using HTML now the first step within the
00:23 - body tags you use a button tag and then
we also need a closing button tag let's
00:29 - save this reload the page look at our
teeny-tiny little button here that
00:33 - doesn't say anything or do anything now
between the two button tags we can add
00:38 - some text like we can say click me let's
save this reload the page and the button
00:46 - now has some text there's a few other
things we can do too we can add a name
00:50 - to this button so we'll say a name
equals within double quotes perhaps
00:55 - simple underscore button we can also add
a type to this button so type equals
01:03 - double quotes and we will just put
button here if we're only using HTML our
01:09 - buttons aren't going to do much we need
a language such as PHP or JavaScript
01:14 - that add functionality to webpages but I
have a few tricks up my sleeve so don't
01:19 - worry I'll show you a few things now
there's 3 different types of buttons
01:23 - we'll be covering
we have the plain vanilla button we can
01:26 - create a submit button and a reset
button so it's going to be a very
01:31 - similar process to what we did above
we'll need an opening button tag and a
01:35 - closing button tag and we can add some
text like submit and we can add a few
01:41 - things to the opening button tag such as
a name so name equals then within double
01:47 - quotes we can create a name such as
submit underscore button and we can add
01:53 - a type type equals double quotes then
submit and I know these buttons aren't
02:03 - going to be functioning right away but
you can also add a value and this will
02:08 - be more useful for JavaScript and PHP
but you can save value equals then
02:13 - within double quotes submit and later on
in future lessons perhaps this will be
02:19 - functioning as a actual submit button
that will
02:23 - information let's save reload and here's
our submit button now let's create a
02:27 - reset button it's going to be very
similar to this and honestly I'm just
02:31 - going to copy this to save time so we
will change submit to reset name reset
02:39 - button type reset and then value reset
with the capital R let's save and reload
02:50 - we now have a reset button there's not
much functionality that we can add to
02:54 - these buttons since we only know a
little bit of HTML for example the reset
02:58 - button will allow you to reset a form
and when we get to the lesson on forms
03:02 - this reset button will come more into
play the submit button we'll probably
03:07 - want to know a backend language such as
PHP or we can actually submit
03:12 - information and the plain vanilla
buttons can really be used for anything
03:16 - and they're very useful with a language
like JavaScript which adds functionality
03:20 - to a web page at the very least you can
add buttons to some place on your web
03:25 - page if you know later on that you'll
need a button to perform some sort of
03:29 - function but in the meantime I'll show
you a few tricks that you can do with
03:32 - buttons only using HTML here's a few
tricks that are available to us I'll
03:36 - teach you guys how to create a disabled
button so it's gonna be the same process
03:40 - as before we'll need an opening button
tag and a closing button tag and let's
03:45 - write some text on this button perhaps
the word disabled let's save this reload
03:50 - and we have a button that says disabled
but to actually make it disabled within
03:56 - the opening button tag we're going to
type in this attribute disabled let's
04:01 - save reload and we can no longer click
on this button you can see that it's
04:06 - somewhat gray and faded now let's create
a button that has autofocus basically
04:11 - how autofocus works is that when this
webpage loads this button is going to be
04:16 - highlighted automatically so I'm going
to write the word autofocus on this
04:21 - button let's say reload ok that's a good
place to start and within the opening
04:26 - button tag we're going to write
autofocus and then we don't necessarily
04:32 - need the equal sign and I'm just gonna
make that lowercase let's
04:36 - save reload all right now see with this
button it's highlighted blue so we're
04:41 - already selecting it and if we were to
click on a different button it's no
04:45 - longer focused but if we reload this you
can see that it's focused again there's
04:50 - another attribute called on click and
when we click on a button we can do
04:54 - something such as create an alert that
pops up on our webpage now it's the same
04:59 - process as before where we need an
opening button tag and a closing button
05:03 - tag and let's write the word alert on
here
05:05 - let's save reload here's our button
within the opening button tag we're
05:10 - going to use the on click attribute then
we need a set of double quotes and
05:15 - within the double quotes there's a few
steps we need to write alert and then a
05:19 - set of parentheses and then a set of
single quotes within the parentheses and
05:25 - within here we can type our message that
displays when we click on this button so
05:30 - I'm going to type in you clicked on a
button OMG ok let's save reload here's
05:41 - our alert button and when we click on it
we get this message that says you
05:46 - clicked on a button OMG
okay I have an idea this will be a fun
05:51 - one let's create a button that will
bring us to a webpage when we click on
05:55 - it so the same process as before opening
button tag and a closing button tag
06:00 - let's go to Google's homepage so we'll
make a google button alright now we'll
06:07 - need to use the a tag outside of this
button actually there's a few different
06:12 - ways you can do this but I think this is
the most simple so a href equals double
06:17 - quotes then we need to type in Google's
address so HTTP s :
06:24 - double /ww google.com then I just need
to close this so we'll put the closing a
06:34 - tag outside of this all right let's save
this reload we now have a Google button
06:40 - and if we click on the Google button we
are brought to Google's homepage all
06:45 - right I had a stupid funny idea I
created a bro code button
06:50 - and when you click on this button it
brings you to the bro code YouTube web
06:54 - page in fact I think all web pages
should have a bro code button but that's
06:58 - just me
alright we've made it to the last button
07:01 - and I promise that this will be the last
one in this video now we can customize
07:05 - the appearance of a button using CSS I
know I know we're in an HTML tutorial
07:10 - but it wouldn't be a bad time to begin
to easily transition into CSS because
07:16 - I'm assuming you probably want to learn
that after HTML and honestly there's no
07:21 - better time to teach you guys how to
customize button than right now so I'm
07:25 - going to teach you some CSS anyways
let's add a few brake lines just to give
07:30 - us some room to work with and you know
the drill we need to create an opening
07:33 - button tag and a closing button tag and
let's write some text on this button
07:38 - such as CSS style save reload all right
here's the button that we're going to
07:45 - customize and to use some simple CSS
style we're going to go into the opening
07:49 - button tag and type in style equals
double quotes and there's a few things
07:54 - we can add let's start by changing the
background color of the button so we're
07:59 - going to type background - color : and
then we can add a particular color you
08:09 - can also do this in hexadecimal if you
know how that works I actually have a
08:13 - color picked out already that I liked it
was 9 7 f 7c see and then add a
08:22 - semicolon I promise I didn't remember
that I actually have a cheat sheet here
08:27 - so let's save this reload and you can
see that the coloring of the button is
08:31 - now different it's like a seafoam green
next let's change the font color and
08:37 - you'll want to be sure that you're
typing this within the double quotes
08:40 - still I'm actually going to go to the
next line
08:43 - and I'm going to type in color colon
then hash tag and then I have another
08:49 - color picked out and this is also in
hexadecimal
08:52 - it was 0d b4 6a then add a semicolon and
don't worry too much if you don't
09:02 - understand the
Act process of how hexadecimal works you
09:05 - can always go to Google or some other
search engine and just look up
09:09 - hexadecimal color picker and here you
can just pick a color that you like and
09:13 - if there's a particular color that you
do like you can just copy this value
09:17 - here and then paste it for whatever
color that you need and I think this is
09:23 - more of like a blue color so you know
let's try that instead all right so I'm
09:27 - going to save this reload and the font
color is that new hexadecimal value that
09:33 - we placed within here it's like a light
blue color and there's a few other
09:38 - things we can add here too so we have
the background color the font color font
09:43 - size so font - sighs :
perhaps 18 pixels all right then
09:52 - semicolon let's save this reload and the
font size of the text on the button is
09:59 - bigger and that also increased the size
of the button as well and one more we
10:05 - can change the font type more
specifically it's the font family : and
10:11 - then I'll pick just mono space you'll
have to experiment with different fonts
10:16 - to see what you like but this one can
work for now so we'll save reload and
10:21 - the font on our button is now different
but yeah that's just a few fundamentals
10:27 - of CSS and how we can apply that to
buttons well that's the basics of adding
10:33 - buttons to a web page using HTML
unfortunately there's still much more we
10:37 - need to learn to actually get these
buttons to function remember that with
10:42 - HTML we add structure to a web page
languages like JavaScript PHP they add
10:48 - functionality to a web page so buttons
will become more prevalent and will
10:53 - actually need to reuse some of this that
we've learned but yeah you're looking
10:58 - for a copy of this I'll post the code
that I have in the comments down below
11:01 - and pin it to the top but yeah that's
everything you need to know to get
11:06 - started working with buttons in HTML hey
you if you enjoyed this lesson then you
11:12 - can help me help you in 3 easy steps by
smashing that
11:17 - like button drop a comment down below
