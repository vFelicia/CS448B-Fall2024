00:00 - yeah what's going on everybody so today
00:02 - I need to explain arithmetic operators
00:04 - because well programming can sometimes
00:06 - involve a lot of math operands are
00:08 - values variables Etc in this equation 11
00:12 - x and 5 are all operands operators they
00:17 - can include but are not limited to
00:19 - addition subtraction multiplication and
00:21 - division in this equation the addition
00:24 - sign would be the operator so there's a
00:26 - few things you should know regarding
00:28 - arithmetic operators in JavaScript so
00:30 - let's begin let's pretend that in the
00:33 - scenario we are a teacher we have a
00:35 - group of students let students equals
00:39 - what's a good class size maybe 30
00:41 - students then I will console DOT log
00:45 - my students variable
00:50 - and it should be 30. let's say that a
00:53 - new student joins the class and I need
00:55 - to change this variable to increase
00:57 - students by one I can say students
01:00 - equals this will reassign my variable
01:03 - equals the current value of students
01:06 - plus one
01:07 - now we have 31 students now for
01:11 - subtraction that is the minus sign
01:13 - to subtract a student we can reassign
01:15 - our variable students equals students
01:19 - minus one
01:20 - now we have 29
01:23 - then we have multiplication which is
01:25 - represented by an asterisk
01:28 - we will double the number of students we
01:30 - have students equal students
01:33 - asterisk 2 to multiply by 2. we have 60
01:37 - students
01:39 - division is a forward slash
01:42 - we will split our class of students into
01:45 - two students divided by two we now have
01:49 - 15.
01:50 - all right then we have exponents
01:53 - exponents is represented by double
01:55 - asterisks
01:57 - what is students to the power of two
02:03 - 900 students that is a very large class
02:06 - maybe it's a lecture or something in a
02:08 - college so students to the power of
02:10 - three that would be
02:12 - students to the power of three would be
02:15 - twenty seven thousand
02:17 - double asterisks is the exponent
02:19 - operator
02:22 - here's another helpful one it is the
02:24 - modulus operator
02:26 - it gives you the remainder of any
02:27 - division
02:28 - so let's say we are going to divide our
02:31 - class into two so modulus which is
02:34 - represented as a percent sign two
02:37 - well 30 divides by 2 evenly so the
02:40 - remainder is zero if we had a class of
02:43 - 31 students well there's one remainder
02:46 - one student
02:48 - students modulus 3 would divide my class
02:51 - of 31 students into three we would still
02:54 - have one student remaining since we're
02:57 - reassigning students we would be
02:59 - replacing 31 students with the value of
03:02 - one if you're using the modulus operator
03:04 - I would recommend creating a separate
03:06 - variable entirely
03:07 - let
03:09 - extra students equal our students
03:12 - modulus 3. we have one extra student
03:17 - just one okay that is the modulus
03:20 - operator
03:21 - there is a shortcut for writing these
03:23 - Expressions because it can be kind of
03:25 - tedious to write the variable name twice
03:26 - so let's set students back to 30.
03:30 - I will console.log students
03:33 - we'll use what is known as augmented
03:35 - assignment operators
03:37 - to increase students by a number
03:39 - if we're reassigning it we can say
03:41 - students plus equals one or some other
03:44 - number students is now 31 if I were to
03:48 - change 1 to B2 it's now 32
03:51 - and 33.
03:53 - let's do the same thing with subtraction
03:56 - students minus equals one
03:59 - we now have 29 students
04:02 - multiplication
04:04 - students
04:06 - times equals to
04:08 - that would give us 60 students
04:13 - students divided by equals to we have 15
04:17 - students
04:20 - all right then exponents
04:23 - students to the power
04:25 - of equals two
04:28 - 900 students
04:31 - then modulus
04:34 - students modulus equals two
04:39 - we have no remaining students 30 divides
04:42 - by two evenly so another place where
04:44 - modulus could be helpful is if you're
04:46 - determining if a number is even a odd 30
04:48 - is an even number divided by 2 the
04:50 - remainder is 0. 31 is odd the remainder
04:54 - is 1. there's also the increment and
04:56 - decrement operator there's a couple
04:58 - different ways to add one to a variable
05:00 - but you should be aware of all of them
05:02 - to increase a variable by only one you
05:05 - can take the name of the variable then
05:07 - add plus plus
05:08 - plus plus is the increment operator 30
05:12 - incremented by one is Thirty-One then
05:15 - there is the decrement operator which is
05:17 - minus minus
05:19 - 30 decremented by 1 is 29. all right
05:23 - then lastly we're going to cover
05:25 - operator precedence
05:27 - this is pretty important given a very
05:30 - complex equation such as this example in
05:33 - which order do you solve each part of
05:35 - this equation so with operator
05:37 - precedence beginning with the left
05:39 - working our way to the right you would
05:41 - solve anything with parentheses then
05:43 - exponents multiplication and division
05:46 - and modulo otherwise known as modulus
05:49 - then lastly addition and subtraction
05:51 - let's go through this step by step let's
05:53 - see what the results variable is I will
05:56 - console.log
05:58 - result
06:00 - so the result is 23.
06:02 - so if we were to walk through this step
06:04 - by step let's solve anything with
06:06 - parentheses
06:07 - starting from the left and then working
06:09 - our way to the right there are no
06:10 - parentheses we can skip this step next
06:13 - is exponents there is one exponent here
06:16 - so we would solve 4 to the power of 2
06:18 - which is 16.
06:21 - then we will solve multiplication and
06:24 - division and modulus that's addition we
06:26 - skip that we have multiplication two
06:29 - times three is six
06:31 - there is no more multiplication division
06:33 - or modulus
06:35 - then lastly addition and subtraction
06:38 - one plus six is seven seven plus sixteen
06:41 - is our result of 23.
06:44 - all right I'll give you a few more
06:45 - exercises
06:47 - how about this equation
06:49 - the result is going to be six
06:52 - so there's no parentheses no exponents
06:55 - we do have a modulus operator here so we
06:57 - solve that first
06:59 - 12 modulus 5 gives us a remainder of two
07:04 - we have some division we would solve
07:06 - that next eight divided by 2 is 4 then
07:09 - addition and subtraction the result is
07:11 - six
07:13 - all right here's a challenge round
07:15 - the result is going to be .0468
07:19 - we solve anything with parentheses first
07:22 - two plus five that is seven
07:25 - then exponents 2 to the power of seven
07:28 - I might need a calculator
07:30 - two times two three four five six seven
07:35 - that's 128.
07:37 - then we have 6 divided by 128 then we
07:41 - have six divided by 128 which is point
07:45 - zero four six eight seven five
07:49 - and that is our result
07:51 - all right everybody so that is
07:53 - everything you need to know about
07:54 - arithmetic operators you have operands
07:57 - which are values and variables in
07:59 - arithmetic expression and operators
08:01 - there's also augmented assignment
08:03 - operators which is a shortcut to writing
08:05 - these equations if you're going to
08:06 - reassign a variable then you have
08:08 - increment and decrement operators to
08:10 - increase a variable by one or decrease
08:13 - it by one
08:14 - then with operator precedence if you're
08:16 - solving a complex equation you solve
08:18 - each part of the equation following this
08:20 - order and well that is everything you
08:22 - need to know regarding arithmetic
08:23 - operators and JavaScript

yeah what's going on everybody so today I need to explain arithmetic operators because well programming can sometimes involve a lot of math operands are values variables Etc in this equation 11 x and 5 are all operands operators they can include but are not limited to addition subtraction multiplication and division in this equation the addition sign would be the operator so there's a few things you should know regarding arithmetic operators in JavaScript so let's begin let's pretend that in the scenario we are a teacher we have a group of students let students equals what's a good class size maybe 30 students then I will console DOT log my students variable and it should be 30. let's say that a new student joins the class and I need to change this variable to increase students by one I can say students equals this will reassign my variable equals the current value of students plus one now we have 31 students now for subtraction that is the minus sign to subtract a student we can reassign our variable students equals students minus one now we have 29 then we have multiplication which is represented by an asterisk we will double the number of students we have students equal students asterisk 2 to multiply by 2. we have 60 students division is a forward slash we will split our class of students into two students divided by two we now have 15. all right then we have exponents exponents is represented by double asterisks what is students to the power of two 900 students that is a very large class maybe it's a lecture or something in a college so students to the power of three that would be students to the power of three would be twenty seven thousand double asterisks is the exponent operator here's another helpful one it is the modulus operator it gives you the remainder of any division so let's say we are going to divide our class into two so modulus which is represented as a percent sign two well 30 divides by 2 evenly so the remainder is zero if we had a class of 31 students well there's one remainder one student students modulus 3 would divide my class of 31 students into three we would still have one student remaining since we're reassigning students we would be replacing 31 students with the value of one if you're using the modulus operator I would recommend creating a separate variable entirely let extra students equal our students modulus 3. we have one extra student just one okay that is the modulus operator there is a shortcut for writing these Expressions because it can be kind of tedious to write the variable name twice so let's set students back to 30. I will console.log students we'll use what is known as augmented assignment operators to increase students by a number if we're reassigning it we can say students plus equals one or some other number students is now 31 if I were to change 1 to B2 it's now 32 and 33. let's do the same thing with subtraction students minus equals one we now have 29 students multiplication students times equals to that would give us 60 students students divided by equals to we have 15 students all right then exponents students to the power of equals two 900 students then modulus students modulus equals two we have no remaining students 30 divides by two evenly so another place where modulus could be helpful is if you're determining if a number is even a odd 30 is an even number divided by 2 the remainder is 0. 31 is odd the remainder is 1. there's also the increment and decrement operator there's a couple different ways to add one to a variable but you should be aware of all of them to increase a variable by only one you can take the name of the variable then add plus plus plus plus is the increment operator 30 incremented by one is ThirtyOne then there is the decrement operator which is minus minus 30 decremented by 1 is 29. all right then lastly we're going to cover operator precedence this is pretty important given a very complex equation such as this example in which order do you solve each part of this equation so with operator precedence beginning with the left working our way to the right you would solve anything with parentheses then exponents multiplication and division and modulo otherwise known as modulus then lastly addition and subtraction let's go through this step by step let's see what the results variable is I will console.log result so the result is 23. so if we were to walk through this step by step let's solve anything with parentheses starting from the left and then working our way to the right there are no parentheses we can skip this step next is exponents there is one exponent here so we would solve 4 to the power of 2 which is 16. then we will solve multiplication and division and modulus that's addition we skip that we have multiplication two times three is six there is no more multiplication division or modulus then lastly addition and subtraction one plus six is seven seven plus sixteen is our result of 23. all right I'll give you a few more exercises how about this equation the result is going to be six so there's no parentheses no exponents we do have a modulus operator here so we solve that first 12 modulus 5 gives us a remainder of two we have some division we would solve that next eight divided by 2 is 4 then addition and subtraction the result is six all right here's a challenge round the result is going to be .0468 we solve anything with parentheses first two plus five that is seven then exponents 2 to the power of seven I might need a calculator two times two three four five six seven that's 128. then we have 6 divided by 128 then we have six divided by 128 which is point zero four six eight seven five and that is our result all right everybody so that is everything you need to know about arithmetic operators you have operands which are values and variables in arithmetic expression and operators there's also augmented assignment operators which is a shortcut to writing these equations if you're going to reassign a variable then you have increment and decrement operators to increase a variable by one or decrease it by one then with operator precedence if you're solving a complex equation you solve each part of the equation following this order and well that is everything you need to know regarding arithmetic operators and JavaScript
