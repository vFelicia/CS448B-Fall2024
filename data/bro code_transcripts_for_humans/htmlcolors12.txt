00:00 - hey it's you bro I hope you're doing
well and in this video we're going to be
00:03 - covering some basic coloring techniques
using the style attribute in HTML let's
00:09 - get into it
00:11 - the HTML style attribute is an in line
attribute that contains some information
00:17 - about how to style a whole or part of a
webpage this is going to be more of a
00:22 - hybrid HTML slash CSS topic because it's
about time we begin to pivot towards
00:29 - learning CSS since we are nearing the
end of this HTML tutorial series we're
00:33 - only going to be covering basic color is
using styling there's way more that we
00:38 - can do with styles but we'll save it for
the CSS series to begin let's create
00:42 - some sample text for our web page
between the body tags let's type some
00:46 - sample text let's add a heading I'll use
an h1 heading since it's the largest and
00:51 - perhaps for a title I will type I like
colors and then let's close this alright
01:01 - let's save refresh I like colors alright
let's add a sample paragraph to work on
01:07 - if you're using sublime text you can
just type in lorem and then hit tab and
01:12 - then you'll have all the sample text to
work with otherwise you can type in
01:16 - whatever you want here it doesn't matter
I'm going to save refresh and I believe
01:21 - we should add a pair of paragraph tags
before and after this whole paragraph
01:27 - alright then I'm just going to copy this
and let's paste it and have a second
01:32 - paragraph alright that looks good enough
for me all right the first thing that
01:37 - we're going to do is that we can apply
an inline style attribute to nearly any
01:43 - HTML element so let's begin with the
background color we'll want to place
01:47 - this style attribute within the opening
body tag so we're just going to type
01:51 - style equals and then we have a few
options here let's say that we want to
01:57 - change the background color we can just
type in background - color and notice
02:04 - that the text color is changing - this
is a CSS property and we'll type in a
02:10 - colon and let's pick a color the first
one that comes to mind for me is like
02:14 - green but you don't have to pick the
same color that I do so let's save this
02:18 - refresh the page and the background
color of our webpage is now like green
02:23 - and actually that's not too bad if a
color
02:25 - I would say it's kind of nice it's like
nature II and with picking colors you're
02:29 - not limited to only placing the color
name you can use hexadecimal color
02:34 - values and if you don't know how those
work or if you need to find a value I
02:39 - would recommend going to any search
engine and just look up hexadecimal
02:43 - color picker and then you can choose any
color that you want let's say we want
02:47 - like a really dark blue color maybe like
a navy blue of some sort I don't know
02:52 - that's probably good enough for me
alright something you can just take this
02:55 - hexadecimal code and we're going to copy
it and replace light green with this
03:00 - value and make sure to get that hashtag
symbol let's save this and reload and
03:06 - the background color is now that dark
blue color however we can't see our text
03:10 - anymore because the background is too
dark the point being with colors you can
03:15 - either use the color name or you can use
the hexadecimal color value and place
03:21 - that instead of the color name I tend to
prefer these values just because you can
03:26 - adjust these depending on the exact
color scheme that you want or if you're
03:29 - trying to match like a logo or something
you can get the exact colors instead of
03:34 - just some of the basic generic color
names like red or blue you can actually
03:39 - get a specific value now we can use this
in line style element and place this
03:45 - somewhere else within another tag let's
say that we want to change the font
03:49 - color of our title mostly because we
can't see it anymore because it's
03:53 - blending in with the dark background
we're going to type style equals same
03:58 - process as before let's start with the
font colors so we could just say color :
04:03 - and I'll just pick red let's save reload
the page and we can now see the header
04:09 - for our web page and the font color is
red let's add a background color to this
04:14 - so we're going to place this within the
double quotes of our style attribute and
04:19 - we're going to add a semicolon to
separate this and we're going to type
04:24 - the background - color and let's add a
background color I'm gonna pick
04:29 - something that would kind of clash with
red just for an example let's say blue
04:34 - let's save reload alright so we can
change the
04:38 - background color of this area
specifically as well however one problem
04:43 - that I have with just using color names
is that these colors tend to be very
04:47 - sharp and if you use these together it's
probably going to hurt your eyes and be
04:52 - difficult to read so I much prefer to
use these hexadecimal colors instead of
04:57 - these color names but it works for this
example for learning purposes we can
05:02 - also change the font color and the
background color of paragraph elements
05:07 - as well so we're going to use the inline
style attribute and it's gonna be the
05:10 - same process as before let's change the
color so color : and I actually picked
05:17 - out a few colors already that I kind of
like so this is what I'm going to type
05:21 - but use whatever colors you want so I'm
going to type for F C 1 FF and let's see
05:30 - what this looks like that's kind of cool
and let's add a background color as well
05:35 - so separate this with a semicolon
background - color and for this color
05:43 - for the background I picked 0 2 - 6 3 B
yeah that's not too bad um I'm not an
05:53 - artist though okay this next one's gonna
be fun let's do this again but pick some
05:57 - random values so I'm just going to copy
this place it within our next paragraph
06:01 - and I'm just going to choose two colors
at semi-random
06:05 - so whoo alright we're going with blue I
guess and I'm going to paste that here
06:15 - for the font color let's do this one
more time
06:17 - I guess red I don't know that was my
poor attempt at being pseudo-random all
06:25 - right let's see what these semi random
colors look like okay that is horrible
06:29 - so do not do anything like this the
colors really clash together
06:33 - okay this color scheme was hurting my
eyes so I changed the colors to
06:37 - something that's actually a little bit
better I would say just green text on a
06:41 - black background it's fairly simple if
you would like a copy of this code we
06:45 - worked on today I'll include a copy of
this in the comments down below and pin
06:50 - it to the top but yeah that is how you
can do
06:52 - basic coloring for your website using
the inline style attribute in HTML
