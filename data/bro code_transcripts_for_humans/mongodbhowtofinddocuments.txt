00:00 - hey everybody in this topic I'm going to
00:02 - explain the find method in mongodb to
00:05 - use the find a method type DB the name
00:07 - of the collection you're working with
00:08 - then add the find method that will
00:11 - return all documents within this
00:13 - collection but at times you might not
00:15 - want all documents you might want
00:16 - specific documents here's how we will
00:19 - add some arguments to the find method
00:21 - db.students.find
00:24 - the first argument is a document object
00:27 - the parameter is the query parameter it
00:31 - specifies selection filters maybe you
00:33 - just need one student well you would
00:35 - just list that criteria here
00:37 - I would like any students with the name
00:40 - of SpongeBob
00:42 - that would return any document where the
00:44 - first name is SpongeBob that would
00:46 - return everybody that has that name I'm
00:49 - just going to copy this
00:51 - let's find any students that have a GPA
00:54 - of 4.0 within our document the search
00:57 - filter is GPA 4.0
01:00 - that would give us Sandy
01:04 - let's find if any students are not
01:06 - full-time
01:09 - full time I will set that to be false
01:11 - there is one student Larry full time is
01:14 - set to false
01:16 - the query parameter is very similar to a
01:19 - where clause in SQL you can even use
01:21 - more than one filter search for any
01:23 - student that has a GPA
01:26 - of 4.0 each filter is comma separated as
01:31 - well as full-time being true
01:35 - with my data set this does not return
01:37 - any results but to add more than one
01:39 - filter they're comma separated within a
01:42 - document body
01:44 - with the find method there is a second
01:46 - parameter that is the projection
01:49 - parameter we would pass another document
01:52 - body they're each comma separated if you
01:55 - don't specify the query parameter you
01:57 - would just return all documents with the
02:00 - projection parameter you can return
02:02 - specific Fields maybe you don't want all
02:05 - the information that's available perhaps
02:07 - I would just like each Student's name
02:10 - so we would set the field to be true
02:13 - you can use one as well but my own
02:15 - preference is true just because it's
02:16 - more readable return every document but
02:19 - only give their name
02:22 - and here they are mongodb will give you
02:25 - the ID regardless you can set that to be
02:28 - false within the projection parameter
02:30 - underscore ID false I just want
02:35 - everybody's name
02:36 - there we are SpongeBob Patrick Sandy
02:38 - Gary Larry
02:40 - let's get every student's name as well
02:42 - as their GPA so ID I will set that to be
02:45 - false I don't want that
02:48 - name will be true I would like that
02:50 - GPA will also be true I would like that
02:54 - here is every student's name as well as
02:56 - their GPA
02:58 - so that's the projection parameter if
03:00 - there's a field you would like or don't
03:02 - want you can set that to be either true
03:04 - or false when you display your data all
03:07 - right let's do the same thing with
03:09 - compass
03:10 - with compass this text box is for the
03:12 - find method So within a set of curly
03:15 - braces I would like to find any name
03:18 - that's SpongeBob
03:20 - then press find that returns one result
03:24 - return any student with the GPA of 4.0
03:29 - that Sandy
03:31 - return any students that are not
03:33 - full-time
03:34 - full time is false
03:37 - that gives us Larry
03:39 - now if you go to more options there is a
03:42 - projection parameter if you only want
03:44 - some data let's find every student but
03:47 - for the projection parameter I would
03:49 - only like their name I'll set that to be
03:51 - true
03:52 - and their GPA
03:55 - that's true as well
03:58 - again that still gives us the ID let's
04:00 - set that to be false if you don't want
04:02 - that
04:03 - ID
04:05 - false
04:06 - and that should get rid of the IDS
04:09 - here's each Student's name and their GPA
04:12 - alright everybody that's the find method
04:13 - two optional parameters that we can send
04:16 - arguments to are the query parameter
04:18 - that's selection criteria it's similar
04:20 - to a where clause in SQL we're trying to
04:23 - limit the results
04:24 - and the projection parameter that's
04:26 - similar to selected columns in SQL
04:29 - you're looking for specific Fields
04:31 - alright everybody and that is the find
04:33 - method in mongodb

hey everybody in this topic I'm going to explain the find method in mongodb to use the find a method type DB the name of the collection you're working with then add the find method that will return all documents within this collection but at times you might not want all documents you might want specific documents here's how we will add some arguments to the find method db.students.find the first argument is a document object the parameter is the query parameter it specifies selection filters maybe you just need one student well you would just list that criteria here I would like any students with the name of SpongeBob that would return any document where the first name is SpongeBob that would return everybody that has that name I'm just going to copy this let's find any students that have a GPA of 4.0 within our document the search filter is GPA 4.0 that would give us Sandy let's find if any students are not fulltime full time I will set that to be false there is one student Larry full time is set to false the query parameter is very similar to a where clause in SQL you can even use more than one filter search for any student that has a GPA of 4.0 each filter is comma separated as well as fulltime being true with my data set this does not return any results but to add more than one filter they're comma separated within a document body with the find method there is a second parameter that is the projection parameter we would pass another document body they're each comma separated if you don't specify the query parameter you would just return all documents with the projection parameter you can return specific Fields maybe you don't want all the information that's available perhaps I would just like each Student's name so we would set the field to be true you can use one as well but my own preference is true just because it's more readable return every document but only give their name and here they are mongodb will give you the ID regardless you can set that to be false within the projection parameter underscore ID false I just want everybody's name there we are SpongeBob Patrick Sandy Gary Larry let's get every student's name as well as their GPA so ID I will set that to be false I don't want that name will be true I would like that GPA will also be true I would like that here is every student's name as well as their GPA so that's the projection parameter if there's a field you would like or don't want you can set that to be either true or false when you display your data all right let's do the same thing with compass with compass this text box is for the find method So within a set of curly braces I would like to find any name that's SpongeBob then press find that returns one result return any student with the GPA of 4.0 that Sandy return any students that are not fulltime full time is false that gives us Larry now if you go to more options there is a projection parameter if you only want some data let's find every student but for the projection parameter I would only like their name I'll set that to be true and their GPA that's true as well again that still gives us the ID let's set that to be false if you don't want that ID false and that should get rid of the IDS here's each Student's name and their GPA alright everybody that's the find method two optional parameters that we can send arguments to are the query parameter that's selection criteria it's similar to a where clause in SQL we're trying to limit the results and the projection parameter that's similar to selected columns in SQL you're looking for specific Fields alright everybody and that is the find method in mongodb
