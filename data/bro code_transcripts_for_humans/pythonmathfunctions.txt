00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's bro
00:02 - hope you're doing well
00:03 - and in this video i'm going to
00:04 - demonstrate a few useful functions
00:06 - related to numbers in python so
00:08 - sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:13 - if you wouldn't mind please like comment
00:15 - and subscribe
00:16 - one like equals one prayer for the
00:18 - youtube algorithm
00:20 - okay let's begin in this video i'm going
00:23 - to be demonstrating a bunch of useful
00:25 - functions related to numbers
00:27 - and a bunch of these functions are
00:28 - located within the math module
00:31 - now let's create a variable for this
00:33 - example let's say
00:34 - pi equals 3.14 just the first
00:38 - few digits of pi is fine for this
00:40 - example and now here's a bunch of useful
00:42 - functions
00:43 - that you guys would probably be
00:44 - interested in the first
00:46 - is round round is a built-in function
00:48 - and all we do is type
00:49 - round then add a set of parenthesis and
00:52 - then we can pass in
00:53 - a value or a variable as an argument and
00:56 - the round function
00:57 - will round that number for us so pi
01:00 - rounded to the nearest whole integer
01:02 - as you guessed it three now we can round
01:06 - a number up by using the
01:07 - seal function of the math class seal
01:10 - short for ceiling
01:11 - so let's print our result and
01:14 - in order to access this function within
01:16 - the math module
01:17 - we would type the name of the module dot
01:20 - and here's a bunch of functions that we
01:21 - have access to
01:23 - so we are looking for seal and it's
01:25 - actually at the top here for me
01:26 - and seal will round a number up to the
01:29 - nearest whole integer
01:30 - so pi rounded up is four
01:33 - then on the flip side we can round a
01:35 - number down by using floor
01:37 - and that is also located within the math
01:39 - module so let's type math
01:41 - dot floor and pi rounded down
01:44 - would be 3. up next i have
01:48 - the absolute value function but it's abs
01:51 - for short abs will give you the absolute
01:54 - value of a number so the absolute value
01:57 - of pi
01:58 - actually let's make this negative 3.14
02:00 - the absolute value
02:01 - will tell you how far a number is away
02:04 - from zero
02:05 - so if you pass in a negative number it
02:07 - will give you a
02:08 - positive number so that is abs short for
02:11 - absolute value
02:12 - next we have the pow function pow
02:16 - will raise a base number to a power
02:19 - let's raise pi to the power of two so we
02:22 - pass
02:23 - in two arguments a base and an exponent
02:26 - pi to the power of two is nine point
02:29 - eight
02:29 - and some change so that is the pow
02:32 - function
02:33 - next we have square root
02:38 - so this is located within the math
02:40 - module we'll type
02:41 - math dot s q r
02:44 - t short for square root and the square
02:47 - root of pi
02:48 - is let's find out oh i guess we can't
02:51 - pass in pi
02:52 - uh let's round a different number like
02:55 - 420
02:57 - oh i guess that's because i made pi
02:58 - negative okay so the square root of 420
03:01 - is 20.4 and some change so that is the
03:04 - square root function all right we have
03:07 - two left we have
03:08 - the max function the max function will
03:10 - find the largest
03:12 - of a varying amount of values so let's
03:14 - create
03:15 - three variables for this example let's
03:17 - say x equals one
03:19 - y equals two and z equals
03:22 - three we can use the max function to
03:25 - find the largest of
03:26 - these values so within a print statement
03:29 - let's use
03:30 - the max function and pass in all of the
03:32 - different values or variables
03:34 - that you would like to compare so i
03:36 - would like to find the largest
03:38 - value between x y and z and the result
03:42 - in this example is three now the min
03:46 - function will find the lowest so
03:49 - min and then pass in your values or
03:51 - variables
03:52 - so i would like to find the minimum
03:54 - value between x
03:55 - y and z and in this case it
03:58 - is one well everybody those are a few
04:02 - useful functions that you guys might be
04:04 - interested in if you guys would like a
04:06 - copy of this code i will post this in
04:08 - the comments section down below
04:09 - but yeah those are a few useful
04:12 - functions related to numbers in python
04:16 - hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you
04:18 - learned something new
04:19 - then help me help you in three easy
04:22 - steps
04:22 - by smashing that like button drop a
