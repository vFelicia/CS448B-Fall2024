00:00 - hey what's going on people it's bro hope
00:02 - you're doing well
00:03 - and in this video we're going to create
00:04 - a small program to find the hypotenuse
00:06 - of a right triangle in c
00:08 - sharp so sit back relax and enjoy the
00:10 - show
00:13 - everyone i thought for practice we could
00:15 - create a small program to find
00:17 - the hypotenuse of a right triangle this
00:19 - will be more or less just for practice
00:22 - so we'll need some prompts let's ask
00:24 - four sides a
00:25 - and b let's begin with a enter side
00:29 - a and then we'll store the user's input
00:32 - within
00:33 - a double double a equals
00:36 - and we'll convert the user input to a
00:39 - double
00:39 - convert to double
00:44 - then within the parenthesis console.read
00:48 - line then another set of parenthesis
00:51 - make sure there is a semicolon at the
00:53 - end too
00:54 - okay then for side b we can just copy
00:56 - what we have
00:57 - change any instance of a to b enter
01:00 - side b double b
01:04 - and we'll have to calculate whatever c
01:06 - is double
01:07 - c math dot square root
01:12 - then we need to multiply a times a
01:19 - that's effectively a to the power of 2
01:22 - plus
01:23 - b times b and let's display the result
01:30 - console.writeline the
01:34 - hypotenuse is
01:39 - plus c and let's give it a go
01:44 - okay enter side a how about three enter
01:47 - side b
01:48 - four the hypotenuse is five well
01:50 - everybody that was a
01:52 - very small practice program if you would
01:54 - like a copy of this code i will post
01:56 - this to the comment section down below
01:58 - if you can give this video a thumbs up
02:00 - drop a random comment down below
02:02 - and well that is a very small sample
02:05 - program in c-sharp
