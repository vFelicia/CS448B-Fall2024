00:00 - hey how's it going everybody in today's
00:02 - video I'm going to show you everything
00:03 - you need to know to get started working
00:05 - with fonts and Google fonts and CSS so
00:08 - sit back relax and enjoy the show all
00:11 - right let's get started everybody we
00:12 - will need an H1 element why don't you go
00:15 - ahead and type in your name if your full
00:17 - name's pretty long just use your first
00:18 - name I guess and we'll need a paragraph
00:21 - to generate some text and vs code you
00:23 - can type lorem then hit tab
00:25 - that is good enough for now
00:27 - to change the font style we will go to
00:29 - our CSS style sheet I'll select our H1
00:33 - element
00:34 - to change the font we can set the font
00:36 - family property then pick a font I would
00:40 - recommend a Sans serif font serifs are
00:43 - these little projections on each
00:45 - character after each brush stroke Sans
00:48 - serif fonts don't have these projections
00:50 - Sans serif fonts are easier to read on a
00:53 - monitor or mobile device
00:55 - I'm going to pick the Sans serif font of
00:58 - verdana
01:00 - now not all fonts are universally
01:03 - accepted by all web browsers for some
01:05 - reason if we can't display verdana it's
01:08 - good practice to have a fallback font
01:10 - one that's web safe so to add a fallback
01:13 - after your primary font separate each
01:17 - font with a comma let's pick Ariel
01:20 - if a web browser can't display verdana
01:23 - the next available font is Ariel that's
01:27 - why you may see two or three fonts
01:28 - listed for a font family they're all
01:31 - fallbacks let's change our paragraph
01:33 - element I will set the font family to be
01:38 - lucida
01:40 - console
01:42 - if the font name contains any spaces you
01:45 - can just place the font name within a
01:46 - set of quotes
01:48 - for a fallback I'll use Courier new
01:54 - if we can't display the first font we
01:56 - will use the backup font
01:58 - now to change the font size there is a
02:01 - font size property
02:03 - normally it's 16.
02:06 - but you can adjust that number here's 18
02:09 - here's 14.
02:11 - here's one it's really tiny you can
02:13 - barely even read it like at all
02:16 - another unit of measurement is em
02:19 - think of em as the standard one em means
02:23 - one hundred percent it's the normal size
02:25 - 1.1 em is 110
02:29 - 1.5 is 150 percent
02:32 - 0.5 is 50 percent
02:35 - you may see either pixels or em as a
02:38 - unit of measurement for the font size
02:39 - let's stick with one em
02:42 - you can change the font weight
02:45 - normally this is normal
02:48 - you can change that to bold if you so
02:49 - choose
02:51 - there's also font style
02:53 - again it's normally well normal
02:57 - you can change that to italic that's
03:00 - enough for basic fonts now I would like
03:02 - to introduce Google fonts head to this
03:04 - website fonts.google.com this website is
03:08 - free to use find two fonts that you like
03:11 - you can also narrow down your search too
03:13 - for example I do not want any serif
03:16 - fonts because they're difficult to read
03:18 - on a monitor
03:19 - I'll just use these two for convenience
03:22 - I'm going to open these in a new tab
03:25 - alright we have Roboto and open Sans
03:29 - I'm going to select one of these fonts
03:32 - I'll go with 400 regular I'll press the
03:35 - plus sign next to this font
03:38 - and we'll do so with our second font
03:41 - I'll go with light 300.
03:44 - to use these fonts we need to link our
03:47 - HTML file with the style sheet we can
03:49 - access that style sheet by going to view
03:51 - selected families
03:53 - be sure that this radio button is
03:54 - selected for link then we will copy this
03:57 - link
03:59 - within our HTML file within the head
04:02 - element I will paste that link
04:05 - we now have access to those two fonts
04:08 - my first font was Roboto
04:14 - my second font I already forgot the name
04:16 - of it
04:17 - open Sans
04:24 - and there we go
04:26 - that's how to link to the Google fonts
04:28 - API now if you do prefer these fonts can
04:32 - be loaded from either a remote server or
04:34 - locally installed on a user's computer
04:36 - for convenience I'm going to create a
04:39 - new folder within my website folder
04:40 - named fonts
04:43 - then heading back to Google fonts view
04:46 - selected families I will download all
04:54 - once we have our file
04:56 - it's a zip folder I'm going to unzip it
05:02 - we are looking for these ttf files they
05:05 - look something like this
05:07 - all we need to do is drag and drop these
05:10 - ttf files into our fonts folder
05:17 - I forgot which one I used
05:19 - I think it was a Roboto light
05:27 - these fonts are available locally we no
05:29 - longer need to link to the Google fonts
05:31 - API
05:32 - we can delete that link
05:36 - so now what we need to do is go to our
05:38 - style sheet and create a font face rule
05:42 - we'll begin with the first font at the
05:45 - top of our style sheet type at font Dash
05:49 - face curly braces
05:52 - we will set the source attribute to be a
05:55 - URL then add a set of parentheses
05:58 - the URL is going to contain the relative
06:01 - file path to one of these fonts
06:05 - I would like Roboto
06:07 - so I'm going to copy the file name
06:10 - this is within the fonts folder I'll
06:13 - place that first
06:15 - then paste the name of that file
06:18 - then a semicolon at the end
06:20 - I'm also going to set the font family
06:23 - property
06:25 - then I can come up with the name for
06:27 - this font I can keep it the same or
06:28 - change it
06:31 - I'll keep it the same though this font
06:32 - shall be known as Roboto light
06:36 - for my H1 element
06:38 - I will change that to be Roboto light
06:42 - that has appeared to work even though
06:44 - we're not linked to the Google fonts API
06:46 - let's add another font face rule
06:49 - we will use our second font
06:54 - fonts slash
06:56 - whatever the heck is listed here
06:58 - I'm going to rename this
07:00 - this font shall be known as open
07:04 - Sans
07:06 - so we need to change the font for our
07:09 - paragraph to that new font
07:11 - there we are all right everybody so
07:14 - that's a few different ways in which you
07:15 - can work with fonts in CSS
