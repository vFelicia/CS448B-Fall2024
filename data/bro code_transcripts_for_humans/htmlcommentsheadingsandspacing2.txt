00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's your
bro here and in this video we're going
00:03 - to be discussing comments headings and
spacing so let's get into it
00:10 - let's kick off this video with comments
comments are useful if you need to
00:14 - insert some sort of note for yourself or
for somebody else that's looking over
00:18 - your HTML document when you insert a
comment they won't actually appear on
00:22 - your webpage but they will appear on
your HTML document so this is what you
00:26 - do to write a comment you need the left
angle bracket next clinician point and
00:30 - then two dashes everything after this
will become a comment so you need to
00:35 - place an ending comment tag somewhere so
to do that type in two dashes and then a
00:39 - right angle bracket everything between
these two tags will be marked as a
00:43 - comment so we can say something such as
this is a comment and notice that it's
00:50 - grayed out so this will not appear on
the webpage so let's save it and test it
00:54 - out let's refresh the webpage and it
doesn't appear and these comments can
00:59 - also take up multiple lines it really
depends on where you place the ending
01:02 - comment tag if we were to put this at
the end of our document all the content
01:07 - between here despite if it's on multiple
lines or not will now be a comment and
01:11 - everything now disappeared because our
text our content for our webpage is
01:16 - between these two common tags so place a
comment wherever you want it's useful if
01:20 - you need to leave a remind you for
yourself or some sort of note for
01:24 - yourself or somebody else okay so up
next we have headings heading tags are
01:28 - used to show the structure of a document
by transforming text to become headings
01:33 - such as titles to mark categories or
sections so by default there are six
01:39 - sizes of headings that you can apply it
to text they are h1 through h6 with h1
01:45 - being the largest heading and h6 being
the smallest so I'll demonstrate each of
01:50 - these so let's take out our content for
now so if you want to mark something
01:54 - using the h1 heading tag you just write
h1 with in angle brackets and then you
02:00 - need a closing tag for this too so make
sure to write forward slash then h1 so
02:05 - whatever text we put in here is going to
be affected by the h1 heading tag so
02:11 - here's an example we'll just say heading
1 and make sure to spell it right well
02:16 - save this and you'll notice that heading
1 is fairly large compared to the text
02:21 - that we had before in our document and
these had
02:23 - are useful if you need to mark different
sections of a webpage it's kind of like
02:27 - a title and there's different sizes so
let's go through each of these and I'll
02:31 - just show you the h1 through h6 tags so
this is h2 so let's change h1 h2 for the
02:37 - second line and let's save it run this
and you can see that h2 is slightly
02:42 - smaller so the higher the number in your
heading tag these smaller the font is
02:48 - gonna be all the way till h6 so let's
try these out so let's add h3 h4 h5 and
03:05 - lastly h6 all right let's save it
refresh the webpage and you can see that
03:17 - these are all the headings that we have
they are of varying sizes depending on
03:22 - what kind of sized font you're looking
for for some sort of heading so
03:26 - basically these heading tags are useful
if you want to give your webpage a title
03:31 - or label sections place them wherever
you like next I'm gonna teach you guys
03:34 - how the paragraph tag works but first we
need some sample text to work with now
03:39 - if you're using sublime text and you
need just some random text for your
03:43 - webpage or you can do is type in lorem
and then hit tab and this is all I want
03:48 - to say dummy text it's all in Latin
actually and let's save this and refresh
03:54 - the webpage and we have a nice little
paragraph here it's actually all in
03:58 - Latin so I'm going to translate this
because I'm actually kind of curious as
04:01 - to what this is so I place this within
Google Translate and this is what it
04:06 - comes up in English the original
language is Latin and in English it says
04:10 - lorem ipsum carrots enhanced rebates but
they do a cat labor added pain and
04:19 - vitality so that at some important
things - well obviously that this is
04:24 - pretty much garbage but it's useful if
you need some dummy text to work with I
04:28 - think what I'm gonna do is just pretend
that this is some sort of magical
04:32 - incantation or spell instead of Latin
lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
04:37 - it's like Harry Potter when they name
their spells when to gaudium labios ah
04:41 - okay I'm starting to get off-track again
now if you want to separate some text
04:46 - and have it become its own separate
paragraph just use the paragraph tag so
04:51 - what you need to do is type in P within
angle brackets so this will split up our
04:55 - text and it will become a new paragraph
so let's save this refresh the page and
05:00 - everything after this paragraph tag
became its own separate paragraph so
05:05 - that's useful if you need to mark
different sections if you have a lot of
05:09 - text to work with just use this
paragraph tag and you can separate lots
05:13 - of text by paragraph now one thing that
you might see is that a lot of people
05:17 - like to have these opening paragraph
tags at the very beginning of a
05:21 - paragraph and where they want their
paragraph to end they'll have a closing
05:25 - paragraph tag and then they'll actually
separate these within the HTML document
05:30 - I think it's easier this way to read and
then you know the next paragraph you
05:35 - just have the opening paragraph tag and
the closing paragraph tag at the end so
05:40 - there's multiple ways of writing this
there will be no change to the web page
05:44 - if you were to write it either way
personally I prefer to have a opening
05:50 - paragraph tag and a closing paragraph
tag F like before and after each
05:53 - paragraph basically but either way it
works it really depends on what style
05:58 - you prefer
so these paragraph tags are useful if
06:01 - you want to write a document or anything
that contains a lot of information these
06:06 - will help keep it organized now if you
ever need to add a line break you can
06:10 - add a line break tag you type in the are
within angle brackets so let's try this
06:18 - out this should push our text down one
line so with our HTML documents this
06:23 - really doesn't read like empty lines so
you know if we had this with a bunch of
06:28 - empty lines between our heading and our
text this won't actually read the way
06:33 - you think it would so if you ever need
to add like a line like a line break or
06:37 - some space just use this BR tag and you
don't need a closing BR tag because this
06:43 - is referred to as an empty tag it's one
of the few exceptions where you don't
06:47 - need to place an ending tag
for this just like the paragraph tag
06:51 - it's not required to have a closing tag
for this so actually if you were to add
06:56 - a couple of these you can add a couple
line breaks so each time I'm adding one
07:00 - of these it's pushing this all the text
down by one line so I'll place these
07:04 - wherever you see fit next we have the HR
tag it adds a visual break in a web page
07:10 - and note HR doesn't stand for human
resources it's actually an abbreviation
07:15 - for horizontal rule and it's used to
separate content by adding a horizontal
07:20 - line to separate whatever content you
want so let's separate each of these
07:26 - headings I think so we'll just add a HR
tag after each of these headings and
07:32 - I'll show you what effect these have so
this is useful if you need to mark
07:37 - something off like section by section so
if we were to add this HR tag after each
07:43 - of these headings and this is also an
empty tag so you don't need a closing
07:48 - tag for each of these and let's add one
more all right so now we have each of
07:57 - these headings in its own separate
section lastly we're going to cover
08:01 - non-breaking spaces so what do you think
would happen if I added a bunch of
08:05 - random gaps between my text here you
think these would display right but I'm
08:10 - refreshing the page and they actually
don't because we ignored these large
08:14 - gaps between our text like I'll even hit
Enter and add a bunch of gaps and this
08:20 - doesn't appear so if you ever need to
add a space what you use is a
08:25 - non-breaking space and you type in + + b
SP that means non-breaking space so if
08:35 - we were to refresh our web page you can
see that a single space appeared it's
08:39 - like you're hitting the space bar so
let's add a couple of these so this
08:46 - should add a few spaces yep we have a
little gap here so if you ever need to
08:51 - add a few spaces just use this
non-breaking space so that's some of the
08:56 - fundamentals for comments headings and
spacing if you're looking for some
09:00 - additional practice feel free to follow
along because i'm
09:03 - going to create a new webpage and will
utilize a few of these features that we
09:08 - just learned about so go to file new
file and I'm going to copy all this and
09:14 - we're going to delete everything within
the body and start fresh and let's just
09:19 - delete all this
alright so feel free to pause the video
09:22 - if you need to catch up with this and
lest's uh let's rename the title here
09:27 - let's call this perhaps test web page
and let's save this the file name
09:35 - doesn't matter
I'll just call this test dot HTML all
09:40 - right and we're probably gonna want to
open this too so go to the file you just
09:44 - created right click it open with and
then pick a web browser all right so
09:49 - here's our test web page all right so
let's create a heading this will
09:56 - function as perhaps a title for this
test web page so let's use the largest
10:01 - heading there is which is h1 and I'm
thinking we can just name this perhaps
10:08 - translations of lorem then let's put a
closing h1 tag here save it and test it
10:17 - out there it is translations of lorem
now I'm thinking we can translate that
10:22 - lorem paragraph that we had before into
various languages and Mark a different
10:27 - section for each translation so I think
that would be some good practice for us
10:31 - and how about we add a horizontal rule
so use an HR tag refresh the page and
10:38 - here's a line going across horizontally
our web page now let's create another
10:44 - heading how about h3 this time let's
call this Latin and a closing h3 tag
10:51 - let's test it out and and it says Latin
here alright so we're going to want some
10:57 - dummy text so if you're using sublime
text just type in lorem then hit tab
11:01 - let's save this run it so here's our
sample text that we have it's all in
11:07 - Latin so why don't we create another
section that's dedicated to this
11:11 - translated in English so let's create a
new heading and we'll use h3 again
11:17 - that's like a middle-sized heading and
we'll call this English and what I'm
11:24 - going to do is actually translate all
this to English so let me go to Google
11:29 - Translate real quick so I went to head
and it translated our lorem sample text
11:34 - all to English it's not necessary that
you do this but I thought it'd be fun to
11:38 - do so we could have like a translated
version of our lorem text into various
11:43 - languages for our experimental web page
so I'm going to copy this text and place
11:49 - it within here and let me just fix some
of this formatting here alright so that
11:58 - looks good let's go back to our web page
refresh it and we have another section
12:03 - that's dedicated to our lorem sample
text translated into english this time
12:09 - except it still doesn't really make
sense in English but you know it's
12:14 - sample text it really doesn't matter all
12:16 - right
let's create perhaps one more section
12:18 - how about another in Spanish oh but
we'll want to use the h3 tag then we'll
12:27 - put Spanish within here and use the h3
closing tag and it's going to be the
12:31 - same process let's translate this to
Spanish I'll copy this and paste it
12:38 - again it's not necessary but I thought
it'd be fun to do and let me fix the
12:43 - tabbing on here the spacing oops
alright let's save this refresh the page
12:55 - and we have another section dedicated to
Spanish so it's a Spanish translation of
13:00 - our lorem sample text do you need to
indent something
13:05 - there's better methods than this in CSS
but a basic way in HTML is to use the
13:11 - non-breaking space four times before
whatever text that you want to indent so
13:16 - I just place this non-breaking space
four times and I'll put this before each
13:21 - section perhaps they'll give myself a
little bit of room to make things more
13:26 - clear all right let's save this
refresh the page and all of our
13:31 - paragraphs are now indented again
there's better ways to do this in CSS
13:36 - but this is what we have to work with in
HTML for now all right I would say that
13:41 - this is a decent web page for our very
second lesson there's still a few other
13:45 - things that we'll want to cover in the
future such as like fonts and coloring
13:49 - and pictures and whatnot so what I'll do
is that I'll post the code that I have
13:55 - in the comments down below so feel free
to look through those or copy these and
14:00 - change things if you want they're meant
to help you and you know what this
14:04 - website is starting to resemble a
Wikipedia page so I would say it's
14:08 - fairly neat and organized right now so
it's good that we get some of the
14:12 - fundamentals out of the way and I think
in the next lesson will cover fonts so
14:16 - we can make our webpage a little more
fancy and cool but yeah that is
14:19 - everything you need to know to get
started with comments and headings and
14:23 - spacing in HTML hey you if you enjoyed
this lesson then you can help me help
14:30 - you in 3 easy steps by smashing that
like button drop a comment down below

Cleaned transcript:

hey what's going on everybody it's your bro here and in this video we're going to be discussing comments headings and spacing so let's get into it let's kick off this video with comments comments are useful if you need to insert some sort of note for yourself or for somebody else that's looking over your HTML document when you insert a comment they won't actually appear on your webpage but they will appear on your HTML document so this is what you do to write a comment you need the left angle bracket next clinician point and then two dashes everything after this will become a comment so you need to place an ending comment tag somewhere so to do that type in two dashes and then a right angle bracket everything between these two tags will be marked as a comment so we can say something such as this is a comment and notice that it's grayed out so this will not appear on the webpage so let's save it and test it out let's refresh the webpage and it doesn't appear and these comments can also take up multiple lines it really depends on where you place the ending comment tag if we were to put this at the end of our document all the content between here despite if it's on multiple lines or not will now be a comment and everything now disappeared because our text our content for our webpage is between these two common tags so place a comment wherever you want it's useful if you need to leave a remind you for yourself or some sort of note for yourself or somebody else okay so up next we have headings heading tags are used to show the structure of a document by transforming text to

here alright so we're going to want some dummy text so if you're using sublime text just type in lorem then hit tab let's save this run it so here's our sample text that we have it's all in Latin so why don't we create another section that's dedicated to this translated in English so let's create a new heading and we'll use h3 again that's like a middlesized heading and we'll call this English
