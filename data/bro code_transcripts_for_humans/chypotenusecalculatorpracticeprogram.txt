00:02 - okay everybody this is going to be a
00:04 - practice project to calculate the
00:06 - hypotenuse of a right triangle
00:08 - which we can find with this formula c
00:11 - equals the square root of a squared plus
00:13 - b squared we'll begin by declaring our
00:15 - variables
00:17 - double a
00:19 - double b
00:21 - double c
00:23 - make sure you include c math as well
00:25 - because we'll be using the power
00:26 - function as well as the square root
00:28 - function at this point we'll accept some
00:30 - user input for sides a and b
00:33 - standard
00:34 - output
00:35 - will create a prompt
00:38 - enter side a
00:43 - standard
00:45 - input
00:46 - a
00:49 - then we'll need side b
00:51 - standard
00:52 - output
00:55 - enter side b
00:59 - standard input
01:02 - b
01:04 - we can handle this formula step by step
01:07 - we could reassign a equal to
01:12 - function
01:13 - a to the power of two
01:16 - b
01:17 - equals power function
01:19 - b to the power of two
01:22 - side c
01:24 - equals
01:25 - the square root
01:27 - of a plus b
01:31 - then at the end we will display whatever
01:33 - side c is
01:34 - standard
01:36 - output
01:39 - side c
01:44 - c
01:46 - okay let's try this
01:49 - enter side a
01:51 - i'll type in three
01:53 - side b will be four
01:55 - side c is five
01:57 - we could shorten this code too we could
01:59 - say the square root of
02:02 - a to the power of two
02:04 - plus
02:05 - b to the power of two
02:08 - then we no longer need these two lines
02:11 - that's another way of writing it in less
02:12 - lines of code let's try this again
02:16 - this time side a will be four
02:19 - side b will be five
02:21 - side c is 6.4 so yeah everybody that's a
02:25 - simple practice project
02:27 - just to get us used to accepting user
02:29 - input as well as some math related
02:31 - functions
02:32 - if you would like a copy of this program
02:34 - i'll post this in the comment section
02:35 - down below and well yeah that's a simple
02:38 - practice project in c plus plus

Cleaned transcript:

okay everybody this is going to be a practice project to calculate the hypotenuse of a right triangle which we can find with this formula c equals the square root of a squared plus b squared we'll begin by declaring our variables double a double b double c make sure you include c math as well because we'll be using the power function as well as the square root function at this point we'll accept some user input for sides a and b standard output will create a prompt enter side a standard input a then we'll need side b standard output enter side b standard input b we can handle this formula step by step we could reassign a equal to function a to the power of two b equals power function b to the power of two side c equals the square root of a plus b then at the end we will display whatever side c is standard output side c c okay let's try this enter side a i'll type in three side b will be four side c is five we could shorten this code too we could say the square root of a to the power of two plus b to the power of two then we no longer need these two lines that's another way of writing it in less lines of code let's try this again this time side a will be four side b will be five side c is 6.4 so yeah everybody that's a simple practice project just to get us used to accepting user input as well as some math related functions if you would like a copy of this program i'll post this in the comment section down below and well yeah that's a simple practice project in c plus plus
