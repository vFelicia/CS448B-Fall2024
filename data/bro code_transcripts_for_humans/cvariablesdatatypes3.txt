00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's you
bro here and in this video we're going
00:03 - to be discussing variables in C++ let's
get into it
00:08 - do you guys remember in math class in
school where there was an equation such
00:13 - as this and you can solve for what the
value of X is and then you can reuse X
00:17 - as if it were that actual number like
here in our example x equals 2 and then
00:23 - if we use this in another equation X
behaves as if it's the number two and we
00:28 - can produce a result so for all intents
and purposes our variable here could
00:33 - store some sort of value and it will
behave as the value that it contains and
00:37 - we can reuse those variables elsewhere
in our C++ programs however we are not
00:43 - limited to only assigning numbers to
variables we can also assign words
00:47 - single characters or even these things
called boolean values which hold either
00:52 - true or false heck we can even assign
entire sentences to a variable now these
00:58 - are the steps to create a variable in
C++ the first is that you need to come
01:01 - up with the name let's pick something
simple to begin with such as X just
01:05 - because we're used to using X like in
math class we'll say x equals and then
01:10 - we can give it a number if we wanted to
let's say 2020 and then finish this with
01:15 - a semicolon all right so there's one
more step that we need we need to
01:19 - declare what type of value that this
variable is going to hold so there's
01:23 - certain rules of that apply when
declaring variables and if this variable
01:27 - is going to store a value of some sort
we have to declare what type of value
01:32 - that is going to be stored within this
variable for example this could be a
01:36 - whole integer a decimal value a single
character a string that's like a series
01:43 - of characters like a word a boolean
value etc so for example if we wanted to
01:49 - store a whole integer value we would
have to declare this of the int datatype
01:55 - which is short for integer but there's
other data types that we should cover so
02:00 - let's discuss what those data types are
now before we really begin to discuss
02:04 - data types these are only a few of the
data types that are available to us I'm
02:08 - only going to be covering a few of the
basic ones just because they can get
02:12 - somewhat complex but I want to give you
just enough information to get started
02:16 - with using data types and then as you
understand how these work you can look
02:21 - at other data types
see what would suit your needs so to
02:24 - begin let's discuss the integer datatype
this will only store a whole number an
02:29 - example would be an age or a year like
you couldn't store a decimal value
02:34 - within here like you wouldn't say for
like a year you wouldn't say it's like
02:39 - the year 2020 0.5 I guess for an age
though if you're a young kid you might
02:44 - say like I'm seven and a half years old
but typically people don't put like a
02:48 - decimal in their edge so if you want to
declare a variable of the integer data
02:53 - it's like you just write int before the
variable name a double will store a
02:59 - decimal an example would be a price and
you just write double before the
03:03 - variable name and the reason that this
is named a double it has to do with
03:07 - double floating-point precision it
relates to computer science but think of
03:11 - double as a decimal so you can store
something such as a price anything that
03:16 - contains a decimal portion the character
data type sometimes referred to as chart
03:21 - like you're pronouncing charizard will
hold a single character like a letter or
03:26 - a symbol a string that can hold one or
more characters an example would be
03:33 - somebody's name or even an entire
sentence or a paragraph and this also
03:38 - has the capability of holding a single
character but we treat strings and
03:43 - characters differently and we also have
boolean which can hold either a true or
03:49 - false and this is useful if you need to
verify something's correct or not if
03:53 - something's on or off and to declare
something of the boolean data type you
03:58 - just write B ool before the variable
name now remember these are only a few
04:04 - of the most commonly used data types
that would be used for beginners so
04:08 - there's definitely more out there just
so you're aware but these are a few just
04:13 - to get us started let's head back to our
program now if we want to store a whole
04:18 - integer within a variable we have to
declare this of the integer datatype and
04:23 - according to that cheat sheet we had to
place int here for integer now we can
04:28 - reuse this variable as if it was this
number we can actually display this if
04:33 - we really wanted to while use our
display
04:35 - see out and then we'll just play sexier
now we don't need to put anything within
04:40 - double-quotes because that will
literally print something so we can just
04:44 - reuse X and then I'm forgetting that
semicolon at the end all right let's
04:48 - display this and here is our result 2020
now when naming variables it's important
04:57 - to name it something that will help you
and other people identify what this is
05:00 - the letter X isn't too descriptive we
can rename this something perhaps as
05:05 - year and that's much more descriptive
and we will have to change it here as
05:10 - well so you're not limited to just
having a variable named X you can name
05:15 - it other things too like year is more
descriptive of what kind of value that
05:20 - this variable will contain and this will
work just the same as it did before
05:23 - despite the name change how about we
create a couple more variables and let's
05:29 - have them all be related to how about
cars I like cars so let's create a few
05:34 - variables based on the data types that
we've just learned about so if we want a
05:39 - price we can use a double value because
that can hold a decimal so we'll say
05:43 - double and then we'll create a variable
name - price equals and then we can
05:48 - assign a decimal value here so 9999
dollars and 99 cents
05:55 - sounds pretty good to me I'm thinking
for our next variable we can assign a
05:59 - char value a single character so we need
to say char and then how about a status
06:04 - like is our car new or is it used
so we'll say status equals and then if
06:09 - you're assigning a char value you need
to put it within single quotes and you
06:13 - can put any one character in here
doesn't matter which one so how about we
06:19 - say and for new you for used so that
would work
06:23 - we need a string still so how about a
model of a car so we'll say string and
06:29 - then model equals and then if you're
assigning a string you need it within
06:36 - double quotes so pay attention that with
integers you don't need any quotes
06:40 - same with doubles for char values you
need single quotes strings you need
06:46 - double quotes so I'll pick my favorite
car which
06:49 - is a Mustang and lastly we could use a
boolean value so we'll say B ool short
06:57 - for boolean and how about we create a
variable named for sale like is the car
07:04 - for sale true or false
yes or no so we can say you know true if
07:08 - it is or false if it isn't but I want
this car to be for sale so I'll say it
07:14 - true so there we go we have successfully
created five different variables and now
07:20 - we can reuse these variables elsewhere
in our program and we can display these
07:24 - variables much like we did with the year
however if we're going to be displaying
07:28 - multiple variables we probably want to
separate these by line so actually I'm
07:34 - going to add en DL at the end of this
just so we can move each of these
07:39 - variables to the next line so en DL then
we'll say C out how about status next P
07:50 - and DL same process with model and for
sale
08:05 - all right let's display this
08:12 - all right so pay attention for the
boolean value of for sale it actually
08:18 - came up as a one and that means true if
it was zero that means false now when we
08:24 - display variables we can also display
these variables along with some text as
08:28 - well so let's say that we want to make
some sort of chart where we display all
08:34 - this information for a car well the
first step to do that is that we'll want
08:38 - to write a string of what we want to
display it so let's say that we want to
08:42 - display the word here and not the
variable perhaps a colon and then a
08:46 - space and then we'll display whatever
value is within your however compared to
08:51 - other programming languages you have to
add like a plus here to display the
08:55 - variable however in C++ you need to use
the insertion operator so that's one
08:59 - thing that's different and this should
go away in a moment yep okay so that
09:02 - cleared up so if you want to combine
displaying variables and some text you
09:08 - need to separate each of these with an
insertion operator so let's do the same
09:12 - with each of these variables here so
we'll say price then use the insertion
09:20 - operator so status I believe that was
new or used so probably I'll put like
09:27 - new slash used so it's more
understandable and this will just take a
09:34 - moment
09:36 - so we'll say a model and then for sale
09:45 - actually I think I'll say availability I
can never spell this word availability
09:54 - it's probably wrong but close enough all
right so let's display this now
10:08 - all right so you can see that we
displayed some text along with our
10:13 - variable for each of these lines except
I messed up spelling model and
10:18 - availability so let me go and fix those
because it's actually going to bother me
10:22 - if I don't okay that's a lot better so
we have like the year here 2020 it's a
10:32 - price $9,999 a new Mustang availability
one which also means true zero means
10:41 - false now I'm gonna take the next part
of this video just to show you guys a
10:44 - few different tricks that we can do with
variables for example we can reassign
10:48 - values later on in our program let's say
that this car is no longer for sale we
10:54 - can say for underscore sale the name of
this variable now equals false so when
10:59 - we display this it's now going to show
the updated value when it was last
11:03 - updated so this should display zero now
and take notice that I didn't have to
11:08 - declare what the data type of this
variable is because you only have to do
11:13 - that once and if you declare this
variable type once you don't have to do
11:17 - it again also it's possible to declare a
variable and not assign it a value right
11:22 - away in case like you want to assign it
later for example we could just say for
11:27 - sale is going to be a boolean variable
but we don't know what value we want to
11:32 - assign to it quite yet so we can just
declare a variable and not assign any
11:37 - value and later on in our program we can
assign that value later on one thing
11:42 - that you should be aware of when using
variables that contain a integer or a
11:46 - decimal is that you can use these as if
they were this number and that means you
11:52 - can also use this for math functions
let's say for our price there's like a
11:56 - 10% discount what we can do is we could
say the price equals whatever this price
12:02 - currently is times zero point nine that
would be the same as a 10% discount and
12:08 - this price will actually be updated so
let's run this and these are actually
12:14 - treated as numbers now like you can see
the new price is eight thousand nine
12:19 - under $99 now with strings you can also
combine strings together for example
12:24 - let's say that we want a variable named
make so the make of this Mustang would
12:31 - be Ford all right so we have I'll make
and a model so we can also combine these
12:38 - together so we could say perhaps string
how about car equals make plus model and
12:47 - let's display this car variable instead
of model so we could change this to car
12:53 - and we will display the car variable now
so this should say Ford Mustang all
13:01 - right but see that it combined both of
these words together and it doesn't have
13:05 - any space between them so you also have
to take that into account so we can say
13:09 - make plus a space plus model equals car
and this would also be an option too if
13:19 - you want to do some separation so it's
kind of like our car which is a strength
13:24 - data type is holding like a whole
sentence now it seems so those are the
13:29 - fundamental uses of variables they can
store a value but you have to list what
13:34 - data type they're storing and they will
behave as the value that they contain
13:40 - and you can reuse these later on in your
program for any purpose and you can name
13:45 - these basically whatever you want but
there's a few key words that are
13:49 - off-limits now please be aware that
there are more data types than this I
13:53 - went over only a few of the more basic
ones just so that we can get the hang of
13:57 - things there's more if you look online
for example with doubles there's also
14:03 - these things called floats which also
hold decimal values they're referred to
14:08 - as floating-point numbers but they use
32 bits of precision
14:12 - whereas in doubles have double that
precision 64 bits of precision and it's
14:18 - usually better to use doubles over
floats because they are more accurate so
14:22 - people tend to use doubles over floats
so if you guys are looking for some
14:27 - practice I'll post the source code in
the comments down below and why don't
14:32 - you guys fill in
some variables here of a car that you
14:35 - would like and post it in the comments
down below but yeah that is everything
14:40 - you need to know to get started working
with variables and C++ hey you if you
14:46 - enjoyed this lesson then you can help me
help you in three easy steps
