00:00 - hey what's going on everybody so today
00:01 - I'm going to explain math math is a
00:04 - built-in JavaScript object that provides
00:06 - a collection of math related properties
00:09 - and methods for example if you ever need
00:11 - the value of pi you would type math with
00:14 - a capital m dot Pi then let's
00:17 - console.log this console.log
00:21 - math dot pi
00:25 - Pi is 3.14 and the rest of the digits if
00:30 - you need e
00:31 - is known as Euler's number it's used for
00:34 - the base of natural logarithms we won't
00:37 - really be using e in the series but if
00:39 - you ever need it it's there math does
00:42 - give you access to a lot of useful math
00:43 - related methods
00:45 - let's create a few variables
00:47 - let x equal 3.21
00:52 - let y equal to
00:56 - and let Z will be undefined if you need
00:59 - to round a number let's say Z equals you
01:02 - can type math dot round method Place
01:06 - whatever value or variable you would
01:08 - like to round within the round method
01:10 - let's round X store the result within Z
01:13 - then display Z console.log
01:18 - Z so 3.21 rounded is three even
01:23 - there's also floor floor will always
01:25 - round down
01:27 - let's change 3.21 to 3.99
01:31 - let's copy this line
01:35 - paste it change round to floor
01:38 - always rounds down so 3.99 rounded down
01:42 - is again three
01:44 - to always round up you can use seal
01:47 - as in ceiling the opposite of floor
01:53 - c-e-i-l
01:55 - let's change 3.99 to 3.21 3.21 rounded
01:59 - up is 4.
02:01 - then there's truncade
02:07 - trunk short for truncate
02:09 - will eliminate any decimal portion
02:12 - 3.21 truncated is three
02:15 - another way to raise a base to a given
02:17 - power is to use the pow method p-o-w
02:22 - let's raise three to the power of two so
02:26 - x to the power of Y which would be 9.
02:31 - y to the power of X would be 8.
02:36 - there's a square root function
02:39 - s q r t let's find the square root of
02:43 - how about 81.
02:46 - the square root of 81 is 9. if you ever
02:49 - need to find the natural logarithm of a
02:51 - number you can use the log function
02:54 - math DOT log let's set X to be 10. the
02:58 - natural logarithm of 10 is 2.3
03:01 - if you need to do anything with
03:03 - trigonometry there's sine cosine and
03:06 - tangent functions
03:07 - let's begin with sine s-i-n within this
03:11 - function you will place radians
03:13 - I'll set X to be 45.
03:16 - so Z is going to be 0.85
03:19 - so that's sine
03:22 - let's do cosine which is cos
03:26 - 0.52
03:28 - then tangent
03:31 - t-a-n
03:34 - and that is 1.61
03:36 - let's change X to be negative
03:40 - 3.21 again
03:42 - to find the absolute value of a number
03:45 - you can use the absolute value function
03:48 - math dot abs
03:51 - it's basically going to give you the
03:52 - same number but it's going to be
03:54 - positive
03:55 - the absolute value of negative 3.21 is
03:59 - 3.21 basically we're eliminating the
04:02 - negative sign
04:03 - to find the sign of a number you can use
04:06 - the sine function s i g n
04:10 - so the sine of negative 3.21 is negative
04:13 - 1. If This Were a positive number it
04:16 - would be 1 if it's zero
04:19 - then the sign is zero
04:21 - here's a pretty helpful method we can
04:24 - find the maximum or minimum value from a
04:27 - set of values or variables
04:28 - let's set Z to be one
04:31 - y will stay as 2 and X will be 3.
04:36 - I will create a new variable named Max
04:39 - it will store the maximum value from
04:41 - these three variables
04:43 - math dot Max
04:47 - comma separate each of the variables x y
04:50 - z then display the maximum within our
04:53 - console.log method
04:55 - the maximum value from these three
04:57 - variables is three
04:59 - then there's min
05:01 - for the minimum
05:03 - let min
05:05 - dot min
05:07 - so the minimum of these three variables
05:09 - is one
05:12 - all right everybody so that's math it's
05:14 - a built-in JavaScript object that
05:16 - provides a collection of properties
05:18 - which was pi and E and methods such as
05:22 - round truncate power
05:25 - methods related to trigonometry and Max
05:28 - and Min methods they're pretty helpful
05:30 - if you ever need them and well that is
05:32 - what math is in JavaScript

If This Were a positive number it would be 1 if it's zero then the sign is zero here's a pretty helpful method we can find the maximum or minimum value from a set of values or variables let's set Z to be one y will stay as 2 and X will be 3.
