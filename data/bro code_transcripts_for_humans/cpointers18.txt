00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's you
00:01 - bro here and in this video I'm going to
00:03 - teach you guys how pointers work in C++
00:06 - so let's get into it
00:09 - so basically whenever we declare a
00:12 - variable that variable has an address in
00:15 - your computer's memory where this value
00:18 - of that variable is going to be stored
00:20 - so pointers are necessary for dynamic
00:23 - memory allocation and that can't be
00:25 - performed without them so we'll be using
00:27 - pointers for a project when we cover the
00:30 - topic on arrays and how they can be
00:32 - useful so let's begin by creating a few
00:35 - variables and I'll show you how this
00:37 - works I already have one string variable
00:39 - named name and I assign this a value of
00:42 - Bro let's create another may be an
00:44 - integer variable named edge and I will
00:47 - assign this value of maybe 100 I am 100
00:51 - years old and let's display these using
00:53 - AC out statement so we'll see out name
00:56 - and then add an end line after and C out
00:59 - edge and we'll also add an end line
01:02 - after this as well so this as you would
01:05 - expect will display the word bro and the
01:08 - number 100 so now there's this ampersand
01:12 - symbol that you can add to a variable
01:14 - and this is called the reference
01:15 - operator also known as an address of
01:19 - operator I've heard people call it both
01:21 - things so this will return a variables
01:24 - address in memory as in the street
01:27 - address in RAM where it's currently
01:29 - located so let's run this and see what
01:31 - happens now all right so we get these
01:35 - two funky numbers the first one is for
01:38 - our first variable and the second one is
01:40 - for our second variable edge so think of
01:43 - this like your own street address for
01:46 - wherever you live for example like 1 2 3
01:48 - fake street except this number is the
01:51 - address for wherever this value is
01:54 - stored well this number is kind of the
01:57 - same thing but instead of a street
01:58 - address it's the street address in your
02:01 - computer's memory where you can find
02:03 - this value it's the location in RAM of
02:06 - this variable and one thing that you may
02:08 - notice that every time we compile and
02:11 - run this program the address may change
02:13 - so these addresses are really only
02:15 - temporary now you don't even need to
02:17 - assign these variables a value just by
02:20 - declaring these variables
02:23 - you're already creating an address of
02:24 - where these variables are going to store
02:27 - a value so let's run this again but
02:30 - we're not going to assign a value so you
02:33 - can see that these variables even though
02:35 - they do not store a value they're only
02:38 - declared we still have space for them to
02:40 - actually store a value at these
02:43 - addresses in our computer's memory now
02:46 - the next step is that we can store an
02:48 - address in a separate variable and that
02:51 - is what's called a pointer a pointer is
02:54 - a variable that stores the address of
02:57 - another variable and to create a pointer
02:59 - we need to declare a pointer just like
03:02 - we do with other variables or constants
03:04 - so this is what you do to create a
03:06 - pointer so let's clear out what we have
03:08 - now and start fresh so let's create a
03:11 - string variable named name you know what
03:13 - I guess we could have kept this line but
03:15 - too late I already deleted it and an
03:17 - integer variable named edge and I will
03:19 - set this back to 100 now these are the
03:22 - steps to create a pointer now the first
03:24 - step is that if we're going to create a
03:27 - pointer for a variable we first need to
03:29 - list the data type of the variable that
03:32 - we're going to create a pointer of if
03:33 - we're going to create a pointer of this
03:36 - variable name that's a string we're
03:38 - going to declare this as a string the
03:40 - second step is that we're going to list
03:42 - an asterisk and this is known as a
03:44 - dereference operator and it returns the
03:47 - location value of a variable now we need
03:50 - a unique name for this pointer a common
03:53 - naming convention is that you take the
03:55 - name of the variable and you add a P
03:58 - before it and you take the first
04:01 - character of that variable and make it
04:03 - uppercase other names would still work
04:06 - that's just one naming convention so
04:09 - this is basically the pointer for our
04:12 - name variable and we're going to set
04:14 - this equal to ampersand name which is
04:19 - the address of our name variable and P
04:23 - name is now a pointer for this variable
04:26 - so let's do the same thing with our edge
04:28 - then following the same rules so we need
04:30 - to list the datatype of this other
04:33 - variable which is an int for integer an
04:35 - asterisk so we're you
04:37 - using the dereference operator then
04:39 - let's create a name for this pointer so
04:41 - I'm just going to type an edge ad P
04:44 - before it and change the first letter to
04:47 - capital so P edge for pointer edge and
04:51 - we'll set this equal to the ampersand
04:55 - and then age alright so we have made two
05:00 - pointers and let's actually display
05:02 - these just to prove that I'm not a liar
05:04 - so we're going to see out P name then
05:08 - maybe a nd L and C out P edge e nd L as
05:15 - well so what you get here is that this
05:18 - these pointers are going to display the
05:21 - addresses of these variables then yeah
05:26 - that seems like it works then so one
05:29 - thing to keep in mind is that if you
05:31 - display the dereference operator along
05:35 - with these pointers it actually is going
05:38 - to display the value at these addresses
05:41 - so we got our values bro and 100 and
05:45 - that kind of defeats the purpose so if
05:46 - you're working with these pointers or
05:49 - you're displaying them make sure that
05:50 - you don't also include the dereference
05:53 - operators so let's create one more
05:55 - pointer just for practice I'll create a
05:57 - string variable maybe we'll call this
05:59 - food equals and then list your favorite
06:03 - food here for me that's pizza alright so
06:05 - we have a variable named food I want to
06:07 - create a pointer for this so we need to
06:09 - type in the data type so string using
06:12 - the dereference operator then we're
06:14 - going to create a new name for this
06:16 - pointer P food equals ampersand then the
06:22 - name of our variable so food and let's
06:25 - display this so see out P food yen DL
06:32 - and here is the address that is
06:37 - contained within our pointer P food for
06:40 - our variable food so these pointers may
06:44 - not seem too useful right now but at
06:46 - least we know how to create them they're
06:48 - used in dynamic memory
06:50 - and when we get to the topic of arrays
06:52 - we're going to be creating a project
06:54 - where we will want some dynamic memory
06:56 - because it's really useful to have so
06:58 - that's the basics of pointers hopefully
07:01 - this video gave you a few pointers as to
07:03 - how pointers work if you would like a
07:05 - copy of all this code that we worked on
07:07 - I'll post it in the comments down below
07:09 - and if you're looking for additional
07:11 - practice then in the comments section
07:13 - post how about three pointers that you
07:16 - created but yeah that is how pointers
07:19 - work in C++ hey you if you enjoyed this
07:23 - lesson then you can help me help you in
07:26 - three easy steps
07:27 - by smashing that like button drop a

07:32 - you'd like to become a fellow bro
