00:00 - hey y'all what's going on everybody it's
00:02 - you bro hope you're doing well and in
00:03 - this video i'm going to explain to both
00:05 - comments and escape sequences in c so
00:08 - sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:14 - all right welcome back so we have to
00:16 - discuss comments and escape sequences
00:18 - so a comment is some text that is
00:21 - ignored by the compiler
00:23 - that is used as an explanation
00:25 - description
00:26 - or a note for yourself or anyone else
00:30 - reading over your code so try to comment
00:32 - you will type
00:33 - two forward slashes then anything
00:35 - afterwards is considered a comment
00:38 - and will be ignored by the compiler this
00:41 - is
00:41 - a comment blog
00:44 - so if i was to run this this text will
00:47 - be ignored by the compiler and we do not
00:50 - see that as
00:50 - output i tend to use a lot of comments
00:52 - when explaining things
00:54 - so this is something you'll see fairly
00:55 - often in my videos now if you need a
00:57 - multi-line comment
00:59 - this is only for a single line comment
01:00 - if i was to type this again without
01:02 - those forward slashes
01:04 - this is a comment well our program
01:06 - thinks that this is some sort of code
01:08 - if we need a multi-line comment you will
01:10 - instead type forward slash
01:12 - asterisk then anything after is
01:15 - considered a comment you can see that
01:16 - this is all green now anything up to a
01:19 - asterisk and forward slash
01:21 - will be a multi-line comment this
01:24 - is a multi-line
01:29 - comment and again this is ignored by the
01:32 - compiler
01:33 - so if you need to write a note
01:35 - description or explanation
01:37 - for yourself or for somebody else you
01:39 - can write that within a single line
01:41 - comment
01:41 - or a multi-line comment and i use a lot
01:44 - of these for teaching purposes
01:46 - because i have a lot of explaining to do
01:47 - right okay let's move on to
01:50 - part two of this video we have escape
01:52 - sequences
01:53 - an escape sequence is a character
01:55 - combination consisting of a backslash
01:58 - followed by a letter or combination of
02:01 - digits
02:02 - they specify actions within a line of
02:04 - text
02:05 - otherwise known as a string so we
02:07 - learned in the last video that we can
02:09 - end our printf statement
02:11 - with a backslash n to create a new line
02:14 - this is the escape sequence for a new
02:16 - line and within a string of text
02:18 - a line of text and within a string of
02:21 - text we can add a new line
02:23 - wherever we want and as many as we want
02:25 - let's say that after
02:26 - each word within my line of text i would
02:29 - like to add
02:30 - each word to a new line so i can use the
02:33 - escape sequence
02:34 - for new line after each of these words
02:36 - so that would look like this
02:38 - i like pizza but you may have to work on
02:41 - the spacing though
02:43 - that's a little bit better so wherever
02:45 - you place
02:46 - a backslash n that will create a new
02:49 - line character
02:50 - another escape sequence is backslash t
02:53 - for a
02:53 - tab so let's say i have a few numbers
02:56 - here one two
02:57 - three and i would like to create even
02:59 - spacing between these numbers
03:00 - i can just add an escape sequence for a
03:03 - tap character
03:04 - one backslash t two backslash t
03:09 - and these numbers are spaced evenly
03:12 - or i can get really fancy and add a new
03:14 - line character
03:15 - then maybe a four tab 5
03:18 - tab 6 new line character
03:22 - then maybe a 7 tab 8
03:26 - tab and then a 9.
03:29 - so now we have a grid of numbers all
03:32 - spaced evenly
03:33 - so that is the new line escape sequence
03:36 - and the tab escape sequence
03:38 - you can use them wherever and however
03:40 - many you want within
03:41 - a string of text within a printf
03:43 - statement what if we need to display
03:45 - quotes like we're quoting somebody
03:47 - i like pizza this is a quote from
03:52 - abraham lincoln
03:55 - probably i need to place quotes around
03:58 - i and pizza so if i were to write it
04:02 - like that well our program doesn't know
04:04 - where our string of text
04:05 - begins and ends it's kind of confused if
04:08 - we need to
04:09 - literally print double quotes we will
04:11 - add an escape sequence
04:13 - backslash then double quote and then add
04:16 - that here as well
04:18 - so this allows us to literally print
04:20 - some quotes
04:21 - as i'll put i like pizza
04:25 - abraham lincoln probably or if you need
04:27 - to display single quotes
04:29 - backslash single quotes
04:32 - so that's how to display single quotes
04:35 - and if you need to display a backslash
04:37 - that would be
04:38 - double backslashes this will literally
04:41 - print backslashes so yeah those are just
04:44 - a few escape sequences here's a list of
04:47 - a bunch of them but
04:48 - a lot of these really aren't going to be
04:50 - relevant to us so yeah
04:52 - those are comments and escape sequences
04:54 - and see

Cleaned transcript:

hey y'all what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain to both comments and escape sequences in c so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right welcome back so we have to discuss comments and escape sequences so a comment is some text that is ignored by the compiler that is used as an explanation description or a note for yourself or anyone else reading over your code so try to comment you will type two forward slashes then anything afterwards is considered a comment and will be ignored by the compiler this is a comment blog so if i was to run this this text will be ignored by the compiler and we do not see that as output i tend to use a lot of comments when explaining things so this is something you'll see fairly often in my videos now if you need a multiline comment this is only for a single line comment if i was to type this again without those forward slashes this is a comment well our program thinks that this is some sort of code if we need a multiline comment you will instead type forward slash asterisk then anything after is considered a comment you can see that this is all green now anything up to a asterisk and forward slash will be a multiline comment this is a multiline comment and again this is ignored by the compiler so if you need to write a note description or explanation for yourself or for somebody else you can write that within a single line comment or a multiline comment and i use a lot of these for teaching purposes because i have a lot of explaining to do right okay let's move on to part two of this video we have escape sequences an escape sequence is a character combination consisting of a backslash followed by a letter or combination of digits they specify actions within a line of text otherwise known as a string so we learned in the last video that we can end our printf statement with a backslash n to create a new line this is the escape sequence for a new line and within a string of text a line of text and within a string of text we can add a new line wherever we want and as many as we want let's say that after each word within my line of text i would like to add each word to a new line so i can use the escape sequence for new line after each of these words so that would look like this i like pizza but you may have to work on the spacing though that's a little bit better so wherever you place a backslash n that will create a new line character another escape sequence is backslash t for a tab so let's say i have a few numbers here one two three and i would like to create even spacing between these numbers i can just add an escape sequence for a tap character one backslash t two backslash t and these numbers are spaced evenly or i can get really fancy and add a new line character then maybe a four tab 5 tab 6 new line character then maybe a 7 tab 8 tab and then a 9. so now we have a grid of numbers all spaced evenly so that is the new line escape sequence and the tab escape sequence you can use them wherever and however many you want within a string of text within a printf statement what if we need to display quotes like we're quoting somebody i like pizza this is a quote from abraham lincoln probably i need to place quotes around i and pizza so if i were to write it like that well our program doesn't know where our string of text begins and ends it's kind of confused if we need to literally print double quotes we will add an escape sequence backslash then double quote and then add that here as well so this allows us to literally print some quotes as i'll put i like pizza abraham lincoln probably or if you need to display single quotes backslash single quotes so that's how to display single quotes and if you need to display a backslash that would be double backslashes this will literally print backslashes so yeah those are just a few escape sequences here's a list of a bunch of them but a lot of these really aren't going to be relevant to us so yeah those are comments and escape sequences and see if you found this video helpful please be sure to destroy that like button drop a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
