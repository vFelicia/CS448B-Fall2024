00:00 - hey what's going on everybody to bro
00:01 - here hope you're doing well and in this
00:03 - video i'm going to teach you guys how we
00:04 - can create separate tabs for our gui
00:06 - applications in python so sit back relax
00:09 - and enjoy the show
00:12 - if you find this video helpful please
00:14 - remember to like
00:15 - comment and subscribe your support will
00:17 - help keep this channel running
00:20 - okay let's begin so in order to create
00:22 - tabs for our python gui application
00:25 - we're going to need access to a widget
00:27 - called notebook
00:28 - and that's found in a different module
00:31 - so this time we're going to need
00:32 - two imports so at the top from tk enter
00:35 - import
00:36 - just everything but the notebook widget
00:38 - is found within a separate module
00:40 - so we'll need a second import from tk
00:44 - enter import ttk
00:47 - so this ttk import gives us access to
00:50 - several different widgets that are
00:52 - normally not available to us
00:53 - so once you have these two imports
00:55 - you're ready to begin so we'll need a
00:57 - window
00:58 - window equals tk followed by window.main
01:01 - loop
01:01 - and we need to create a notebook widget
01:04 - so
01:05 - right after you create your window we're
01:06 - going to create a notebook
01:08 - we'll call this notebook equals ttk
01:12 - dot notebook and we want to add
01:15 - this notebook to our window so let me
01:18 - add a comment here what this widget does
01:20 - so this is a widget that manages
01:24 - a collection of windows
01:27 - and displays and that's really all there
01:30 - is to
01:31 - it so in order to create different tabs
01:33 - we're going to create some frames
01:35 - so for the first tab i'll call this tab
01:37 - 1 equals
01:38 - frame and we want to add this to the
01:41 - notebook
01:43 - and with our notebook we're adding this
01:45 - notebook to the window
01:47 - all right so this will be a new frame
01:50 - for tab one and let's create a second
01:54 - tab
01:54 - and we'll call this tab two and you can
01:57 - create more tabs if you want but that
01:59 - might be overkill
02:00 - so this is a new frame for tab two
02:03 - after you finish these two lines of code
02:05 - we're going to follow this up with
02:06 - notebook dot add so notebook dot
02:10 - add what widget are we adding we're
02:13 - adding
02:14 - our tab one frame and we can set some
02:17 - text
02:17 - for this tab so text equals
02:20 - and i'll type in tab 1 and we'll repeat
02:23 - the process for tab 2.
02:26 - so notebook.ad tab 2
02:29 - and we'll change the text to tab 2. and
02:32 - then we need to pack this notebook
02:35 - notebook dot pack and let's take a look
02:38 - to see what we have
02:40 - all right we have tab one and tab two
02:43 - but we'll probably want to actually add
02:45 - something to each of these tabs so that
02:48 - the content is visible
02:49 - so let's create some labels so after we
02:51 - pack our notebook
02:52 - let's create some labels i don't really
02:55 - feel like giving these names because we
02:57 - don't really plan on using them for
02:58 - anything else
02:59 - so we'll just say label tab
03:02 - one that's going to be the parent widget
03:05 - and let's set some text text equals
03:08 - hello
03:10 - this is tab number one
03:14 - then i think i'll give this a width and
03:15 - a height too just so it's more visible
03:18 - so for the width i'll make this 50 and
03:21 - the height
03:22 - 25 so this will be roughly a square
03:24 - shape
03:26 - and then we need to pack this so i'm
03:27 - just going to add pack
03:30 - and let's create a second label for tab
03:32 - two
03:33 - so label tab two maybe i'll say
03:37 - goodbye this is tab number two
03:40 - okay we should have some actual content
03:43 - for these labels now for these tabs so
03:46 - here's the label
03:47 - this is tab one and this is tab two and
03:49 - you can switch between these and they
03:51 - display
03:51 - each of these separate labels however
03:54 - with the way that this window is
03:55 - arranged
03:56 - if we were to expand the size of this
03:58 - window well
04:00 - our frames and our tabs kind of stay in
04:02 - the top
04:03 - and in the center so i'm going to add a
04:05 - few lines within
04:07 - the pack function of our notebook the
04:09 - first thing i'm going to do
04:10 - is use the expand option and set this to
04:13 - true
04:15 - so what this does and i'm just going to
04:16 - add a comment that expand
04:18 - this will expand
04:22 - to fill any space
04:25 - not otherwise
04:28 - used so what happens now
04:32 - is that this will actually expand
04:35 - and it's staying in the center of the
04:36 - window but there's one more thing we're
04:39 - going to add
04:40 - fill equals both
04:43 - normally this is x or y or you can do
04:46 - both
04:47 - so i'll add a comment as to what this
04:49 - option does
04:51 - so fill will fill
04:55 - on x and y
04:58 - axis so if you combine both of these
05:01 - together
05:02 - what you get is that these tabs will
05:04 - stay in the top
05:05 - left corner and if you were to expand
05:08 - the size of this window
05:09 - the tabs aren't going to move they're
05:11 - going to stick to the top
05:12 - left but the size of the window will
05:14 - expand
05:16 - all right so that's the basics of
05:17 - creating tabs in python if you want a
05:19 - copy of all this code i'll post all of
05:21 - this in the comments down below
05:23 - but yeah that's the basics of creating
05:24 - tabs in python
05:28 - hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you
05:30 - learn something new
05:31 - then you can help me help you in three
05:34 - easy steps
05:35 - by smashing that like button drop a
05:38 - comment down below
05:39 - and subscribe if you'd like to become a
05:41 - fellow bro
