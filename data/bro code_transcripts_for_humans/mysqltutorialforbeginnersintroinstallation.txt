00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's your
00:01 - bro hope you're doing well and in this
00:03 - video I'm going to show you how we can
00:04 - start writing SQL using the MySQL
00:07 - workbench so sit back relax and enjoy
00:10 - the show
00:12 - all right let's get started everybody
00:13 - SQL it's an acronym meaning structured
00:17 - query language SQL is used to create
00:20 - retrieve update and delete data from a
00:23 - database suppose we own a business like
00:25 - the Krusty Krab from SpongeBob if we had
00:27 - to manually track all of the
00:29 - transactions by pen and paper well that
00:32 - would be a lot of extra work if we had a
00:34 - database we could keep track of these
00:36 - records electronically and save
00:37 - ourselves a lot of trouble right there's
00:39 - two types of databases I'll discuss
00:41 - relational and non-relational a table in
00:45 - a relational database it resembles an
00:47 - Excel spreadsheet there's rows and
00:49 - columns tables within a relational
00:51 - database can form well relationships
00:53 - with one another and that is done by
00:55 - this concept of keys which I'll explain
00:57 - in a further topic then there's
00:59 - non-relational databases that's where
01:02 - our data is organized in any format but
01:05 - a table this could include Json files
01:07 - key value pairs graphed data structures
01:10 - entities of that nature to utilize data
01:13 - in a relational database we would use
01:15 - SQL then with a non-relational database
01:18 - we would use a different language named
01:21 - nosql meaning not only SQL but since
01:25 - this is an SQL series we will be working
01:27 - with SQL and relational databases not
01:30 - non-relational databases to write SQL
01:33 - statements we would need the help of a
01:35 - special piece of software known as a
01:37 - database management system people
01:39 - shorten this to Simply dbms it's a
01:43 - workspace for us to write SQL statements
01:45 - and generally just work with our
01:47 - database it'll make our lives easier
01:49 - there are different dbms systems you can
01:51 - use one of which is MySQL Microsoft SQL
01:55 - Server Oracle and postgres SQL but
01:58 - there's still many more out there each
02:00 - of these database Management Systems all
02:02 - use SQL but there's subtle nuances
02:05 - between these syntax of each database
02:07 - management system if you're familiar
02:09 - with one database management system
02:10 - transitioning to another will take
02:12 - little to no effort at all in this
02:14 - series we will be working with the mySQL
02:17 - database management system and I'll show
02:19 - you how to download that for both
02:20 - Windows and Mac OS
02:23 - hey everybody in this topic I'm going to
02:25 - explain how we can download MySQL using
02:27 - the Windows operating system first of
02:30 - all head to this website mysql.com then
02:33 - go to the downloads tab
02:36 - scroll down look for MySQL Community
02:38 - downloads we'll click on that
02:43 - click on MySQL installer for Windows
02:48 - make sure that we have our Windows
02:50 - operating system selected
02:53 - then download the first installer
02:58 - no thanks just start my download
03:03 - we will open this download once it's
03:05 - complete
03:09 - there are various setup types depending
03:11 - on what packages you need for this
03:14 - series all we need is the server and the
03:16 - workbench we'll select the custom radio
03:19 - button
03:20 - click next
03:22 - we will need the most recent MySQL
03:25 - server
03:28 - add that to products to be installed
03:32 - open applications go to mySQL workbench
03:36 - we will add the most recent workbench
03:40 - we can close out of that there is a
03:42 - shell if you're interested in using that
03:44 - but I will be sticking with the
03:45 - workbench in this series once we have
03:47 - our server and our workbench I will
03:49 - click next
03:51 - then execute
03:54 - looks like there's an error downloading
03:56 - the workbench I'm going to try again
03:58 - and it worked this time for some reason
04:00 - let's click next
04:03 - execute
04:04 - give it some time once the installation
04:07 - status for the server and the workbench
04:09 - is complete we can click on next
04:12 - next
04:14 - I'll keep these default configurations
04:18 - next
04:20 - use strong password encryption for
04:22 - authentication let's click next
04:26 - here we're going to set the root
04:27 - password to access the server think of
04:30 - some password you would like I'm just
04:32 - going to set mine to be password I'll
04:34 - keep it simple
04:38 - yeah of course the password strength is
04:40 - weak you can add user accounts but
04:42 - that'll be outside the scope of this
04:44 - series
04:45 - click next
04:47 - you can start the MySQL server at system
04:49 - startup if you would like I'll keep that
04:52 - on
04:52 - click next
04:55 - then execute
04:57 - then finish
04:59 - then next
05:02 - yeah we might as well start the MySQL
05:04 - workbench after setup
05:07 - if this window doesn't pop up you can
05:09 - easily just search for it just look for
05:11 - MySQL workbench
05:14 - now we should have a local instance
05:16 - we can click on this to access our
05:19 - server let's pretend that this wasn't
05:20 - here I'm going to right click delete
05:22 - connection
05:25 - if you need to set up a connection hit
05:26 - this plus button
05:28 - we'll need a connection name I'll name
05:30 - this Local Host connection method should
05:34 - be standard TCP IP
05:37 - the host name is
05:39 - 127.0.0.1 at Port 3306
05:44 - then press ok
05:47 - so now that we have our connection set
05:49 - up we can click on it type in the
05:51 - password you set for the server mine was
05:53 - simply password
05:56 - you could save the password if you want
05:58 - I might as well
06:00 - then okay
06:02 - and here we are within the MySQL
06:04 - workbench
06:06 - all right everybody in this topic I'm
06:08 - going to explain how we can download
06:09 - MySQL using the Mac operating system
06:13 - first head to this URL mysql.com
06:17 - we will go to the downloads tab
06:22 - scroll down look for MySQL Community
06:25 - downloads
06:27 - we'll need both the server and the
06:29 - workbench but let's start with the
06:30 - server click on this file
06:34 - Mac OS 12 DMG archive click the download
06:38 - button
06:40 - click on this link no thanks just start
06:42 - my download
06:48 - when this DMG archive is finished
06:50 - downloading we can double click on it
06:53 - just give it a second
07:00 - double click on the DMG archive
07:04 - allow
07:07 - click continue
07:11 - you can read the license agreement I'm
07:13 - going to pretend I did hit continue
07:16 - install
07:19 - type in your computer's password if this
07:21 - prompt comes up
07:29 - use strong password encryption hit next
07:33 - then we'll need a password for our
07:34 - server type in whatever password you
07:37 - would like to keep it simple for this
07:39 - lesson I'm just going to set my password
07:40 - to be well password
07:45 - by checking this box MySQL server will
07:48 - start once the installation is complete
07:50 - you might as well keep this checked but
07:52 - for demonstration purposes I'm going to
07:54 - show you how to start the server
07:55 - manually
08:01 - then close
08:04 - I'll go ahead and move the installer to
08:06 - the trash bin
08:07 - we have the server downloaded next we
08:09 - need to download the workbench
08:12 - again head to mysql.com
08:15 - go to downloads
08:18 - scroll down to mySQL Community downloads
08:23 - click on MySQL workbench
08:27 - then hit the blue download button
08:32 - no thanks just start my download
08:39 - then we can double click on this DMG
08:41 - archive when it's finished downloading
08:45 - so double click
08:48 - drag and drop the workbench icon into
08:51 - your applications folder
08:54 - before we access the workbench let's be
08:57 - sure that the MySQL server is running
09:00 - click on the top left Apple logo
09:03 - go to system preferences at the bottom
09:06 - left corner look for MySQL
09:09 - click on it
09:11 - then start MySQL server if it's not
09:14 - started already and you can check this
09:16 - checkbox so that your computer starts up
09:18 - with it running
09:20 - all right you may need to type in your
09:22 - password
09:25 - the server is now running
09:29 - to run the workbench we can go to finder
09:33 - then applications
09:35 - look for the MySQL workbench icon
09:40 - double click on it
09:43 - and here we are within the MySQL
09:45 - workbench
09:46 - to access the server you can click on
09:49 - this local instance connection then type
09:51 - in the password that you originally set
09:53 - for the server
09:54 - but if you're missing this connection
09:56 - you can hit the plus button
09:58 - then create a new connection name I'll
10:00 - name this Local Host
10:03 - use standard tcpip for the connection
10:05 - method
10:06 - hostname should be
10:09 - 127.0.0.1 and Port 3306 then press ok
10:13 - but I already have my connection set up
10:16 - click on your connection type in the
10:18 - password you set for the server
10:22 - then press OK and here we are within
10:25 - MySQL workbench
