00:02 - and in this video i'm gonna show you all
00:03 - how we can use
00:04 - pip for python to download packages and
00:06 - modules
00:07 - so sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:12 - all right people pip for python pip is a
00:15 - package manager
00:16 - for packages and modules from the python
00:19 - package index
00:21 - if you're using python version 3.4 or
00:24 - above
00:24 - pip should already be installed if
00:26 - you're using a python version below 3.4
00:30 - one option is that you can always update
00:32 - your version of python
00:33 - just click download open when done
00:37 - go to customize installation make sure
00:40 - that pip is checked
00:41 - go to next and add python to environment
00:45 - variables
00:46 - then install now to use pip open up
00:49 - command prompt and type
00:50 - pip for a help menu all sorts of
00:54 - different
00:54 - general options and commands will appear
00:57 - if you need to check your version of pip
00:59 - type this command and here's a cheat
01:02 - sheet that i wrote
01:03 - so to check the current version of pip
01:05 - type pip
01:06 - dash dash version enter
01:10 - and currently the version that i'm using
01:13 - is 21.
01:14 - if you need to upgrade pip use this
01:16 - command pip
01:18 - install dash dash up
01:21 - grade pip mine should be the latest
01:25 - version
01:26 - yeah requirement already satisfied and
01:29 - if you need a list of installed packages
01:31 - type pip list
01:36 - so here's all of the packages that i
01:38 - currently have installed
01:40 - some of these you might recognize like
01:42 - numpy
01:43 - pygame pi installer those are just a few
01:46 - to check to see if any of your packages
01:48 - are outdated
01:49 - type pip list
01:53 - dash dash outdated
01:57 - and this might take a second here are
01:59 - four packages that are outdated on my
02:01 - computer
02:02 - babel pi game pi tz and setup tools
02:05 - if you need to upgrade one of your
02:07 - packages type pip
02:09 - install the name of the package let's
02:11 - say that i would like to update pi game
02:13 - then dash dash upgrade
02:18 - i just realized that in my notes i'm
02:20 - missing updated package so i just added
02:22 - that here
02:23 - now you can see that pie game has
02:25 - successfully updated and
02:27 - let's just check to see if it has by
02:29 - using pip
02:30 - list outdated pip list
02:33 - dash dash outdated
02:37 - and pi game is no longer in here so it
02:39 - is up to date
02:40 - and if you would like to install a
02:42 - package type hip
02:44 - install and the name of the package you
02:46 - would like to download
02:47 - let's say i would like to download
02:49 - pandas pip
02:50 - install the name of the package in this
02:52 - case pandas
02:55 - two valley boring minutes later and it's
02:58 - done
02:58 - so i should now have pandas installed
03:00 - and let me check
03:01 - pip list
03:05 - and here it is i have successfully
03:07 - downloaded the package of pandas
03:10 - so those are a few commands for pip and
03:12 - if you're interested in downloading more
03:14 - packages head to python's package index
03:17 - on second thought i should probably show
03:19 - you all where that is python's package
03:21 - index is located
03:22 - at pipi.org and you can do a search for
03:26 - all sorts of different projects and
03:27 - packages
03:29 - so everybody that is pip for python i
03:31 - will post my notes in the comment
03:33 - section down below
03:34 - and well yeah that's how to use pip for
03:37 - python
