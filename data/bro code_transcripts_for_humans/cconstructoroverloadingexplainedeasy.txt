00:02 - overloaded constructors are when we have
00:04 - multiple constructors with the same name
00:07 - but different parameters they allow for
00:09 - a varying number of arguments when
00:11 - instantiating an object here's an
00:13 - example we'll create pizza objects from
00:15 - a pizza class let's type class
00:18 - pizza add a set of curly braces a
00:20 - semicolon to the end
00:22 - we'll make our members publicly
00:24 - accessible
00:25 - so pizzas they can have a variable
00:28 - number of toppings right you can have no
00:30 - toppings one topping two toppings three
00:32 - toppings suppose we have just one
00:34 - topping to begin with topping one and
00:37 - that will be of the string data type
00:40 - standard string topping
00:42 - one then i will create a pizza
00:45 - constructor it has the same name as the
00:46 - class name pizza parentheses curly
00:49 - braces
00:50 - we'll set up some parameters
00:53 - standard string topping one in order to
00:55 - construct a pizza we have to pass in one
00:58 - topping
00:59 - so let's do that we have pizza
01:01 - pizza one
01:03 - and i will pass in one argument for a
01:05 - topping
01:06 - i feel like pepperoni
01:09 - then we'll just need to assign this
01:11 - argument to this attribute
01:14 - this
01:14 - arrow
01:15 - topping one
01:17 - equals topping one the name of this
01:20 - parameter then to test this let's
01:22 - display topping one
01:23 - standard
01:25 - pizza one
01:27 - dot topping one
01:36 - okay we have pizza one that contains
01:38 - pepperoni now what if you would like a
01:41 - pizza that has two toppings
01:43 - suppose we have pizza two pizza
01:46 - pizza two
01:48 - this time i'm going to attempt to pass
01:50 - in two arguments
01:51 - how about mushrooms
01:55 - and peppers
01:59 - well when i run this program
02:02 - we're going to have an error
02:04 - error no matching function for call to
02:06 - pizza with two arguments
02:09 - we can create an additional constructor
02:12 - that accepts different arguments
02:15 - let's copy what we have and paste it
02:18 - this constructor will take two string
02:20 - arguments topping one and topping two
02:26 - so we have two toppings this time and i
02:28 - should probably create another attribute
02:29 - for a second topping
02:31 - standard string
02:33 - topping two
02:38 - this topping two equals topping two
02:42 - so now with pizza two let's display
02:45 - topping one
02:46 - as well as topping two
02:51 - now pizza 2
02:53 - contains mushrooms and peppers
02:56 - what if you would like a pizza with no
02:58 - toppings like a plain cheese pizza well
03:01 - we could set that up
03:02 - pizza pizza three
03:06 - i'm going to attempt to add a set of
03:08 - parentheses after pizza 3 but pass in no
03:10 - arguments
03:14 - but we have a warning our compiler is
03:16 - saying we should get rid of the
03:17 - parentheses
03:21 - if we're passing in no arguments we
03:23 - don't need that set of parentheses but
03:25 - we still have an error here
03:29 - no matching function call for pizza with
03:32 - no arguments
03:33 - if we're creating an object and passing
03:36 - in no arguments we'll need a matching
03:37 - constructor
03:39 - so at the top i'll create a pizza
03:41 - constructor with no arguments
03:44 - and that should make that error go away
03:49 - so this should run and compile just fine
03:51 - then
03:52 - yep no errors
03:54 - so yeah those are overloaded
03:56 - constructors
03:57 - you can have multiple constructors with
04:00 - the same name as long as the parameters
04:02 - are different we have three constructors
04:04 - with the same name we can create a pizza
04:06 - with no toppings one topping or two
04:09 - toppings overloaded constructors allow
04:12 - for multiple objects with a varying
04:14 - number of attributes if you're looking
04:16 - for some additional exercises post a
04:18 - class with overloaded constructors in
04:20 - the comments section down below and well
04:22 - yeah those are overloaded constructors
04:24 - in c plus plus

Cleaned transcript:

overloaded constructors are when we have multiple constructors with the same name but different parameters they allow for a varying number of arguments when instantiating an object here's an example we'll create pizza objects from a pizza class let's type class pizza add a set of curly braces a semicolon to the end we'll make our members publicly accessible so pizzas they can have a variable number of toppings right you can have no toppings one topping two toppings three toppings suppose we have just one topping to begin with topping one and that will be of the string data type standard string topping one then i will create a pizza constructor it has the same name as the class name pizza parentheses curly braces we'll set up some parameters standard string topping one in order to construct a pizza we have to pass in one topping so let's do that we have pizza pizza one and i will pass in one argument for a topping i feel like pepperoni then we'll just need to assign this argument to this attribute this arrow topping one equals topping one the name of this parameter then to test this let's display topping one standard pizza one dot topping one okay we have pizza one that contains pepperoni now what if you would like a pizza that has two toppings suppose we have pizza two pizza pizza two this time i'm going to attempt to pass in two arguments how about mushrooms and peppers well when i run this program we're going to have an error error no matching function for call to pizza with two arguments we can create an additional constructor that accepts different arguments let's copy what we have and paste it this constructor will take two string arguments topping one and topping two so we have two toppings this time and i should probably create another attribute for a second topping standard string topping two this topping two equals topping two so now with pizza two let's display topping one as well as topping two now pizza 2 contains mushrooms and peppers what if you would like a pizza with no toppings like a plain cheese pizza well we could set that up pizza pizza three i'm going to attempt to add a set of parentheses after pizza 3 but pass in no arguments but we have a warning our compiler is saying we should get rid of the parentheses if we're passing in no arguments we don't need that set of parentheses but we still have an error here no matching function call for pizza with no arguments if we're creating an object and passing in no arguments we'll need a matching constructor so at the top i'll create a pizza constructor with no arguments and that should make that error go away so this should run and compile just fine then yep no errors so yeah those are overloaded constructors you can have multiple constructors with the same name as long as the parameters are different we have three constructors with the same name we can create a pizza with no toppings one topping or two toppings overloaded constructors allow for multiple objects with a varying number of attributes if you're looking for some additional exercises post a class with overloaded constructors in the comments section down below and well yeah those are overloaded constructors in c plus plus
