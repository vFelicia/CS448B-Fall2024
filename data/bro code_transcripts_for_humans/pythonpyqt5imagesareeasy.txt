00:00 - what is going on everybody in today's
00:02 - video I'm going to show you how we can
00:03 - add images to Pi qt5 you will need an
00:06 - image to work with me I'll be using my
00:09 - profile picture for my YouTube channel
00:10 - feel free to take a moment to find a
00:12 - picture of your own maybe a profile
00:14 - picture of yourself we will need the
00:16 - following Imports Q label the most
00:21 - common and straightforward approach to
00:22 - displaying an image is to add an image
00:25 - to a label in order to display it then
00:28 - we will need this other import from PI
00:31 - qt5 that's the package then the module
00:35 - of QT
00:37 - GUI import the class of
00:40 - qix map the class of qix map it's used
00:45 - for handling images and provides
00:46 - functionality for loading manipulating
00:49 - and displaying images we will load our
00:51 - image to a q pix map object then add
00:54 - this qix map object to a label in order
00:57 - to display it within our Constructor of
01:00 - our main window we will create a label
01:03 - label equals call the Q label
01:07 - Constructor then pass in self self
01:10 - refers to the window object our window
01:13 - will be the parent widget our label
01:15 - widget is one of its children once we
01:17 - have our label we'll set the geometry of
01:20 - the label label. set geometry method we
01:24 - have to pass in X and Y coordinates as
01:28 - well as a width and height of the label
01:31 - for the coordinates let's say zero for
01:33 - each the label will appear in the top
01:36 - left corner for the width 250 is good
01:39 - and the height 250 as
01:42 - well here's my window the label is going
01:45 - to appear in the top left corner however
01:47 - there's nothing added to the label
01:49 - that's where the widget of Q pix map
01:51 - comes in we will create a PIX map object
01:56 - equals call The Constructor of Q pix map
02:01 - we have to pass in a string that
02:02 - represents a relative file path or an
02:05 - absolute file path to our image my image
02:08 - is right next to my main python file I
02:10 - just need the file name the name of my
02:13 - image is profile pick and this is a
02:17 - JPEG when I run this we don't see our
02:20 - image we have to add the Pix map object
02:23 - to the label we have to set it here's
02:26 - how take our label use the set pixmap
02:31 - method and pass in our pixmap
02:35 - object and now we can see the image
02:38 - however the image doesn't scale
02:40 - according to the size of the label to
02:43 - enable that we have to call the
02:44 - following method take our label called
02:48 - the set
02:50 - scaled contents method then pass in true
02:54 - our image will now scale to the size of
02:57 - the
02:58 - label if we we were to change the size
03:00 - of the label let's say it's 100
03:04 - pixels it will scale down even further
03:08 - or I could even increase it to
03:11 - 500 so now the image takes up the entire
03:14 - width and height of the
03:16 - window let's set that back to
03:21 - 250 there's a few tricks that we can do
03:23 - with positioning of the image we've set
03:26 - our label with an image we can move the
03:28 - label within the confines of the window
03:31 - currently it's set in the top left
03:32 - corner but here's a few tricks that we
03:34 - can do with positioning with our label
03:38 - we will set the geometry
03:42 - again so the top left corner is 0 0 for
03:45 - the
03:46 - cordinates we could pass in 250 and 250
03:49 - again for the width and the height but
03:52 - if we were to change that here when we
03:55 - initially create this label we would
03:57 - have to manually change that here as
03:59 - well
04:00 - I think it would be better if we were to
04:02 - get the current width and height of the
04:03 - label take our label call the width
04:06 - method to get the width same thing
04:08 - applies with the height label. height
04:13 - method that should work
04:15 - fine let's say we would like to take our
04:18 - image and move it to the right side of
04:19 - our window here's
04:22 - how with the X cordinate we're going to
04:25 - access self that means our window called
04:29 - the width method
04:31 - method here's what we have currently we
04:34 - can't see the
04:35 - label it was placed outside of the
04:37 - confines of the
04:39 - window let's subtract our labels
04:42 - width label.
04:45 - width I'll put each of these arguments
04:47 - on a new line just to help with
04:52 - readability so now our image is Right
04:54 - Justified within our
04:56 - window for the bottom right corner we
04:59 - will take the second
05:02 - argument access self. height that's the
05:05 - height of the window that we're
05:08 - instantiating minus our labels
05:12 - height and now our image is in the
05:15 - bottom right
05:16 - corner for the bottom left corner we
05:19 - will set X to be
05:23 - zero now here's the tricky part to have
05:26 - our image placed in the center of our
05:28 - window we will take the width of the
05:31 - window minus the width of the label / by
05:34 - two for integer division we'll be using
05:38 - double forward slashes we need our
05:40 - pixels to be whole integers so we're
05:42 - going to be using integer Division and
05:44 - not standard division we will round to
05:47 - the nearest whole pixel then we will do
05:50 - this with the height as
05:54 - well and now our image should be in the
05:56 - middle of our window
05:59 - all right everybody and that is how to
06:01 - add an image to your Pi qt5 application

Cleaned transcript:

what is going on everybody in today's video I'm going to show you how we can add images to Pi qt5 you will need an image to work with me I'll be using my profile picture for my YouTube channel feel free to take a moment to find a picture of your own maybe a profile picture of yourself we will need the following Imports Q label the most common and straightforward approach to displaying an image is to add an image to a label in order to display it then we will need this other import from PI qt5 that's the package then the module of QT GUI import the class of qix map the class of qix map it's used for handling images and provides functionality for loading manipulating and displaying images we will load our image to a q pix map object then add this qix map object to a label in order to display it within our Constructor of our main window we will create a label label equals call the Q label Constructor then pass in self self refers to the window object our window will be the parent widget our label widget is one of its children once we have our label we'll set the geometry of the label label. set geometry method we have to pass in X and Y coordinates as well as a width and height of the label for the coordinates let's say zero for each the label will appear in the top left corner for the width 250 is good and the height 250 as well here's my window the label is going to appear in the top left corner however there's nothing added to the label that's where the widget of Q pix map comes in we will create a PIX map object equals call The Constructor of Q pix map we have to pass in a string that represents a relative file path or an absolute file path to our image my image is right next to my main python file I just need the file name the name of my image is profile pick and this is a JPEG when I run this we don't see our image we have to add the Pix map object to the label we have to set it here's how take our label use the set pixmap method and pass in our pixmap object and now we can see the image however the image doesn't scale according to the size of the label to enable that we have to call the following method take our label called the set scaled contents method then pass in true our image will now scale to the size of the label if we we were to change the size of the label let's say it's 100 pixels it will scale down even further or I could even increase it to 500 so now the image takes up the entire width and height of the window let's set that back to 250 there's a few tricks that we can do with positioning of the image we've set our label with an image we can move the label within the confines of the window currently it's set in the top left corner but here's a few tricks that we can do with positioning with our label we will set the geometry again so the top left corner is 0 0 for the cordinates we could pass in 250 and 250 again for the width and the height but if we were to change that here when we initially create this label we would have to manually change that here as well I think it would be better if we were to get the current width and height of the label take our label call the width method to get the width same thing applies with the height label. height method that should work fine let's say we would like to take our image and move it to the right side of our window here's how with the X cordinate we're going to access self that means our window called the width method method here's what we have currently we can't see the label it was placed outside of the confines of the window let's subtract our labels width label. width I'll put each of these arguments on a new line just to help with readability so now our image is Right Justified within our window for the bottom right corner we will take the second argument access self. height that's the height of the window that we're instantiating minus our labels height and now our image is in the bottom right corner for the bottom left corner we will set X to be zero now here's the tricky part to have our image placed in the center of our window we will take the width of the window minus the width of the label / by two for integer division we'll be using double forward slashes we need our pixels to be whole integers so we're going to be using integer Division and not standard division we will round to the nearest whole pixel then we will do this with the height as well and now our image should be in the middle of our window all right everybody and that is how to add an image to your Pi qt5 application
