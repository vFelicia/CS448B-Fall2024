00:00 - what's going on everybody it's your bro
00:02 - here hope you're doing well and in this
00:03 - video i'm going to teach you guys how we
00:05 - can create key events in python so sit
00:07 - back relax and enjoy the show
00:11 - if you find this video helpful please
00:13 - remember to like
00:14 - comment and subscribe your support will
00:17 - help keep this channel running
00:19 - welcome back everyone in this video
00:22 - we're going to be discussing at key
00:23 - events
00:24 - we can bind a key event and a function
00:27 - to a widget or a window so that when we
00:30 - press a certain key
00:31 - or do something we can trigger a
00:34 - function to be called that will perform
00:36 - some sort of task for us
00:37 - so we can actually do this by using the
00:39 - bind function
00:41 - so widgets and windows have access to a
00:44 - bind function
00:45 - so when our window or our widget is
00:48 - selected and then you press a certain
00:50 - key or do something
00:51 - then it's going to call a certain
00:53 - function to perform a task for us
00:55 - so there's two arguments within the bind
00:57 - function this takes an event
00:59 - as well as a function name let's say
01:02 - that when we press the enter key we want
01:04 - to
01:04 - call this function to do something so
01:07 - for this event
01:08 - what we type for that is a set of quotes
01:12 - angle brackets and the name of the
01:14 - button
01:15 - so for example if you want to press w to
01:17 - move forward like you're playing a game
01:19 - this would be w
01:20 - a s d there's also up
01:24 - down and then let's say we want to press
01:27 - enter to do something that is actually a
01:29 - return and then we will call
01:31 - this function so let's create a function
01:33 - called do something
01:35 - and let's define this at the top def
01:39 - do something now pay attention to this
01:42 - part we need to set up
01:43 - one parameter for this do something
01:45 - function
01:46 - this needs an event so be sure to
01:48 - include that and it's easy to forget
01:50 - so what do we want to do after we press
01:53 - enter
01:54 - let's just print a message you
01:58 - did a thing and this should work now
02:02 - so let's try it
02:05 - so while this window has focus ability
02:09 - we can actually uh have this respond to
02:11 - events
02:12 - so right now i'm pressing all sorts of
02:13 - keys you can probably hear me right now
02:15 - going crazy on my keyboard
02:16 - but now i'm going to hit enter and it
02:18 - says you did a thing
02:20 - and you can bind all sorts of keys to
02:22 - this window let's say that i want to
02:24 - press
02:25 - q to quit so we'll just replace this
02:28 - with
02:28 - lowercase q so
02:32 - i'm typing all sorts of keys but now i'm
02:33 - going to press q and it says you did a
02:35 - thing
02:36 - kind of like we're quitting the game you
02:38 - can actually have this respond to
02:40 - all keys well almost all of them so to
02:43 - do that
02:43 - you just type in key with the capital k
02:47 - so i can pretty much press on any key
02:49 - then it's going to trigger
02:51 - or call our function
02:54 - kind of like that so one thing that we
02:57 - could do we can display
02:59 - the key event that was pressed so i'm
03:01 - just going to add that here
03:03 - maybe i'll change this message you
03:06 - pressed plus and to display
03:10 - what key was pressed that is event
03:13 - dot key sim i believe that's for
03:17 - key symbol so this will actually display
03:20 - what button you pressed
03:21 - so w-a-s-d
03:25 - here's a unique idea for practice let's
03:28 - say that we want to add a
03:29 - label to our window and we're going to
03:31 - change the text on the label
03:33 - to reflect whatever key that we press so
03:36 - let's create a label
03:37 - label equals label we're adding this to
03:39 - our window
03:41 - and let's change the font as well to
03:43 - something massive
03:44 - like helvetica
03:48 - and a size of 100 that should be good
03:51 - then we need to pack this label so label
03:53 - dot pack
03:55 - then within this function let's turn
03:57 - this into a comment
03:59 - and we're going to use label dot config
04:02 - and we're going to update our text
04:06 - and the text is going to be whatever key
04:08 - that we press so we can do that with
04:10 - event dot key sim so now
04:14 - this label is going to display whatever
04:16 - key that we press
04:18 - so for example w a s
04:21 - d backspace escape
04:24 - up up down down left right left right b
04:27 - a start
04:28 - all right so that's the basics of key
04:30 - events if you could do me a favor and in
04:32 - the comments down below
04:33 - just press f to pay respects so if you
04:36 - want a copy of this code i'll post this
04:38 - in the comments down below but yeah
04:39 - that's the basics
04:40 - of key events in python hey you
04:44 - yeah i'm talking to you if you learn
04:46 - something new then you can help me
04:48 - help you in three easy steps by smashing
04:51 - that like button
