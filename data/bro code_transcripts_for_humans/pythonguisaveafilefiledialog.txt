00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's your
00:01 - bro here hope you're doing well and in
00:03 - this video i'm going to teach you guys
00:04 - how we can use
00:05 - python's file dialog to save a file
00:08 - someplace on your computer
00:09 - so sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:14 - if you find this video helpful please
00:16 - remember to like
00:18 - comment and subscribe your support will
00:20 - help keep this channel running
00:22 - okay everybody so this is how we can
00:24 - save a file we're going to be reusing a
00:27 - file dialog again
00:28 - kind of like what we did with the video
00:31 - on opening and reading a file
00:33 - so from tk enter import file dialog
00:37 - we're going to be creating a window and
00:38 - adding a button as well as a text area
00:41 - to this window
00:42 - so let's create our window window equals
00:44 - tk
00:45 - followed by window dot main loop
00:49 - let's create a button so button equals
00:52 - button
00:53 - let's set the text of the button so text
00:56 - equals
00:56 - save it's going to be a safe button and
00:59 - then a command
01:00 - so we'll need to link a function to this
01:02 - command so let's create a
01:04 - save file function and then we need to
01:08 - pack
01:08 - this button so button dot pack
01:12 - now let's create a text area this is
01:14 - just called
01:15 - text so text equals text we're going to
01:18 - add this to the window
01:20 - and we need to pack this text so text
01:23 - dot pack and now let's create
01:26 - a save file function so
01:29 - at the top of our program d e f
01:33 - save file
01:36 - and then we're going to take file dialog
01:39 - and use the
01:40 - ask save as file function and we're
01:43 - going to store
01:45 - the contents within file file equals
01:48 - file dialog dot ask save as file
01:52 - let's run this just to test it out so we
01:55 - have
01:55 - our window a save button and this
01:59 - is our text area
02:02 - we can type in multiple
02:06 - lines of text yay
02:11 - and let's try and save this just to see
02:14 - what we have so far
02:15 - so this will bring me to my desktop it
02:17 - might bring you
02:18 - someplace else for your computer uh so
02:21 - i'm just going to save this
02:22 - as test file
02:26 - now with this drop down menu save as
02:28 - type there's
02:29 - nothing set up so we'll need to do that
02:31 - manually
02:32 - if we were to save this and here's that
02:34 - test file on my
02:36 - desktop so let's take a look at the
02:38 - properties we did not list a
02:40 - file extension so the type of file just
02:43 - says
02:43 - file so we'll get to that later on in
02:45 - this video
02:46 - and if we were to open this with a
02:48 - program like notepad
02:50 - well it's currently empty that's because
02:52 - we need to write
02:53 - some text to this file so let's do that
02:56 - next
02:57 - let's store all of the text from our
03:00 - text area to a variable
03:02 - let's call this variable file text
03:06 - file text equals and then we need to get
03:09 - all of the text from our text area so
03:12 - text dot get and we're going to list the
03:15 - starting index as well as the ending
03:18 - index
03:19 - for this function so we're going to
03:21 - begin at 1.0 that is the beginning of
03:24 - this text area
03:25 - and the ending we can just put end and
03:28 - then we need to convert all of this into
03:30 - a string
03:31 - so let's surround this with str
03:34 - and then we can store all of the text
03:36 - from our text area
03:38 - within this variable file text
03:41 - and now we just need to write our text
03:44 - to this file
03:45 - so file dot right and we're going to
03:47 - pass in
03:48 - file text and then it's a good idea to
03:52 - close your files when you're done using
03:54 - them so file
03:55 - dot close and let's try this again
04:00 - hello my name
04:04 - is bro let's save this
04:08 - i'll call this hello and click save
04:12 - and we still can't save s-type so we'll
04:14 - work on that next
04:16 - let's go to my desktop here's the test
04:18 - file that we created i'm going to open
04:20 - this with notepad and it has
04:22 - all of the text that we added to that
04:24 - text area
04:26 - now let's list some available file
04:28 - extensions that we can have the user
04:30 - save this file as
04:32 - so let's begin by setting the default
04:34 - extension
04:35 - so default extension
04:39 - and let's set this to a text file that
04:42 - is
04:44 - dot txt and then we can list all of the
04:49 - available
04:49 - file types so file
04:53 - types and we're going to place these
04:56 - within
04:56 - a set of straight brackets and i'll just
04:59 - separate these line by line
05:01 - so let's begin with a plain text file so
05:04 - this will take two strings the first is
05:07 - the message that will appear within
05:11 - that save as type drop down menu so
05:13 - let's place
05:15 - text file and the second string
05:18 - the file extension and that is
05:22 - dot t x t
05:25 - then let's add another let's say html
05:28 - so i'm going to copy this and paste it
05:31 - and let's say html next
05:36 - dot html and then lastly you can do
05:40 - just all files so
05:43 - all files and that is dot
05:47 - asterisk and let's try this again so
05:53 - hello my name
05:56 - is bro i like
06:00 - pizza and ice cream
06:04 - and this time i think i'll save this as
06:06 - an html file
06:09 - and this is we'll call this
06:13 - pizza and ice cream i guess
06:17 - and click save now let's go back to my
06:20 - desktop
06:21 - here's that file pizza and ice cream and
06:23 - it is an
06:24 - html file let's just verify that
06:28 - yep.html for the type of file
06:31 - so we can open this with notepad
06:35 - and it has all of the text i could even
06:38 - open this with sublime text as well
06:42 - kinda like that
06:45 - all right let's change the initial
06:48 - directory
06:49 - for saving a file let's change it to
06:52 - my project folder for uh this python
06:56 - file that we have
06:57 - so that is and i'm just going to
06:59 - organize this a little bit
07:02 - initial d i r
07:05 - equals and then we can list a file path
07:08 - so i'm just going to copy this
07:11 - so copy path paste it
07:16 - then i want to make sure that these are
07:19 - double backslashes
07:23 - and i need to add a comma at the end
07:26 - okay let's try this again
07:28 - so testing
07:31 - one two three and this should go to my
07:35 - project folder which it does
07:39 - testing one two three and let's save
07:42 - this as a
07:42 - plain text file click save
07:46 - and here's that plain text file testing
07:49 - one two three another option available
07:52 - to you is that you don't necessarily
07:53 - need to use
07:54 - a text area to get some text to write to
07:57 - a file
07:58 - you could use the console window to
08:00 - accept some text
08:02 - so to demonstrate this i'm going to turn
08:04 - this line into a comment
08:06 - and we're instead going to use the
08:08 - console window this time
08:10 - so we'll say file text equals
08:14 - input and then let's just have a prompt
08:17 - here
08:18 - enter some text i
08:21 - guess and then let's run this again so
08:24 - we still need to
08:25 - click this save button and select a
08:28 - file location i'll just save over our
08:30 - file testing123
08:32 - i'll click save yeah i'll replace it
08:35 - alright so we need to
08:37 - enter some text i guess so
08:40 - i will write a message such as
08:44 - the cake is a lie
08:47 - and hit enter so then
08:51 - our file testing123 now says the cake is
08:54 - a lie
08:54 - so you don't necessarily need to use the
08:58 - get function for a text area you can use
09:00 - the console window as well
09:02 - here's one last thing to consider before
09:04 - you go so
09:06 - what if we begin the process of finding
09:08 - a file location to save
09:10 - a file to and then we exit out of this
09:13 - window
09:14 - well we're going to encounter an
09:15 - exception so one way that we can prevent
09:18 - this
09:18 - is to add this line if
09:22 - file is none
09:25 - return so then if we were to try this
09:28 - again
09:30 - begin saving a file and then exit out of
09:32 - this
09:33 - there is no exception that we encounter
09:36 - so that's just
09:37 - one little extra i thought i would throw
09:39 - in but yeah that's the basics
09:40 - of saving files in python if you would
09:43 - like a copy of all this code
09:44 - i'll post all of this in the comments
09:46 - down below but yeah that's how to save a
09:49 - file using python hey you
09:52 - yeah i'm talking to you if you learn
09:54 - something new then you can help me
09:56 - help you in three easy steps by smashing
10:00 - that like button
10:01 - drop a comment down below and subscribe
10:03 - if you'd like to become a fellow bro
