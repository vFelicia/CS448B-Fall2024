00:00 - hey what's going on everybody so today
00:01 - I'm going to explain arrays in
00:03 - JavaScript think of an array as a
00:05 - variable like structure that can hold
00:07 - more than one value for example let's
00:10 - say we had a variable named fruit
00:12 - go ahead and pick a fruit I'll pick an
00:14 - apple
00:15 - our variable can store one value but we
00:18 - can turn a variable into an array and it
00:21 - can store more than one value and we can
00:23 - do so by enclosing all values with a set
00:25 - of straight brackets now my variable of
00:28 - fruit is now an array it can store more
00:31 - than one value just be sure that each
00:33 - value is comma separated this time I'll
00:35 - add an orange
00:37 - and a banana
00:39 - just to make it more obvious that this
00:41 - is an array I'm going to add an S so
00:44 - that my variable name is plural it's not
00:46 - mandatory but it helps with readability
00:48 - I now have an array of fruits but let me
00:51 - show you something if I were to
00:53 - console.log my array of fruits
00:58 - well JavaScript is going to print out
01:00 - all of the elements in this array each
01:02 - item each value is known as an element
01:04 - we have three elements if you need to
01:07 - access an individual element following
01:09 - the array you have to add an index
01:11 - number in closed and straight brackets
01:13 - if I would like the element at the first
01:15 - position that would have an index of
01:17 - zero that would give me an Apple fruits
01:21 - at index of one would be orange
01:24 - fruits at index of two
01:27 - is banana
01:28 - if I were to attempt to access the
01:30 - element at index 3
01:33 - well it's undefined we only have three
01:35 - elements within our array zero one two
01:38 - arrays always begin with zero you can
01:40 - even change one of these elements by
01:42 - accessing that array at a given element
01:46 - let's access our array fruits at index
01:49 - zero I will set the sequel to be a
01:53 - coconut
01:55 - so now we have coconut orange banana
01:58 - let's change fruits at index one to be a
02:00 - coconut Apple coconut banana
02:03 - index two will be a coconut Apple orange
02:06 - coconut if I set fruits at index three
02:08 - to be a coconut let me console.log that
02:11 - too
02:12 - fruits at index three
02:14 - we can add a new element to that array
02:16 - otherwise to add an element there's a
02:18 - built-in method of arrays
02:20 - fruits dot push
02:22 - to push an element to the end
02:25 - I will add a coconut to the end of my
02:27 - array Apple orange banana coconut
02:30 - then we have pop
02:33 - is going to remove the last element
02:39 - Apple orange undefined the unshift
02:42 - method will add an element to the
02:44 - beginning
02:45 - take our array use the on shift method
02:48 - on shift I will add a mango to the
02:52 - beginning of my array
02:54 - mango Apple orange banana
02:57 - then we have shift to remove an element
02:59 - from the beginning fruits.shift
03:03 - now we have an orange banana and my last
03:06 - two elements are undefined to get the
03:08 - length of an array there is a length
03:10 - property let's create a new variable let
03:13 - num of fruits to store the number of
03:17 - fruits that we have
03:19 - type the array name
03:21 - dot length
03:24 - then let's console.log
03:27 - the number of fruits we have
03:29 - we have three fruits I'll add another
03:31 - I'll add a coconut to the end
03:33 - and we have four
03:35 - so that's how to get the length of an
03:37 - array there's a length property
03:39 - type the array name dot length we can
03:42 - find the index of an element if there's
03:44 - a match
03:45 - let index equals let's search for an
03:50 - apple
03:51 - fruits dot index of method what are we
03:55 - searching for let's search for an apple
03:58 - then I will display the index
04:00 - so our apple is located at index 0.
04:04 - let's search for an orange
04:06 - that's index one
04:08 - banana
04:09 - that's two coconut three what if we
04:13 - search for an element that doesn't exist
04:14 - like a mango
04:17 - well this method will return negative
04:19 - one that could be helpful within an if
04:21 - statement you can check to see if this
04:22 - method returns negative one then if it
04:25 - does that means the element wasn't found
04:26 - and you can let the user know if index
04:29 - equals negative one display that element
04:32 - wasn't found now if you would like to
04:34 - Loop through the elements and display
04:35 - them there's an easier way to do that
04:37 - you can use a for Loop
04:40 - so four
04:42 - there's up to three statements we'll
04:43 - need a counter or some sort of index
04:46 - let I equal zero that's the first
04:49 - statement
04:50 - we'll continue this as long as I is less
04:53 - than
04:54 - our fruits array dot length property
04:58 - then we will increment I by One if we
05:01 - have four elements we should execute
05:03 - this Loop four times during each
05:05 - iteration I will console.log
05:09 - our fruits array
05:10 - but the index instead of being like 0 1
05:14 - 2 3 a hard number we'll use our counter
05:17 - our index of I
05:20 - and let's get rid of that line now we
05:22 - should Loop through all of the elements
05:23 - of this array and print them out
05:25 - individually using a for Loop we can
05:27 - even increment by a different number
05:29 - like two I plus equals two
05:32 - so here we're only displaying the apple
05:34 - and the banana
05:36 - if I set index to be 1 then increment by
05:39 - 2 will display orange then coconut
05:42 - so using a for Loop there's a few
05:44 - different ways in which you can display
05:45 - the elements of an array if you need to
05:48 - display the order of this array in
05:49 - Reverse we can change this around
05:52 - we will set our counter I to be the
05:54 - length of our array
05:56 - then we'll continue as long as I is
05:58 - greater than or equal to zero then I
06:02 - minus minus there's one change I'm going
06:04 - to make
06:05 - we have undefined coconut banana orange
06:08 - Apple so the length of my array is four
06:11 - but if I were to access our array fruits
06:14 - at index 4 where would that be zero one
06:18 - two three that's out of bounds I'm going
06:20 - to set our index to be fruits.length
06:23 - minus one zero one two three our length
06:26 - is four minus one is a total of three
06:29 - now we're printing our array in Reverse
06:31 - coconut banana orange Apple
06:34 - there's also an enhanced for loop it's a
06:36 - shortcut to displaying the elements of
06:38 - an array you can write something like
06:40 - this
06:41 - let fruit
06:43 - of array fruits
06:46 - really this variable can be anything but
06:49 - I like to write a singular version of my
06:51 - array name
06:52 - then during each iteration I will
06:54 - display each fruit
06:57 - Apple orange banana coconut this is an
07:00 - enhanced for loop it's kind of like a
07:01 - shortcut to displaying the elements of
07:03 - an array if this array name were I don't
07:05 - know like meets you could say let meat
07:08 - of meats
07:11 - and then display each meat
07:14 - but of course they're still fruit that's
07:16 - a shortcut you can use now to sort an
07:19 - array you can use the sort method
07:21 - fruits dot sort
07:24 - and that should sort the elements in
07:26 - alphabetical order
07:27 - apple banana coconut orange
07:30 - to sort them in reverse order you can
07:32 - tack on the reverse method to the end
07:36 - fruits.sortmethod.reverse method
07:38 - now they're all backwards in Reverse
07:40 - alphabetical order orange coconut banana
07:43 - apple
07:44 - all right everybody so that's an
07:46 - introduction to arrays we'll have a lot
07:48 - of practice with this in the future so
07:49 - if you don't remember everything that's
07:51 - okay an array is a variable like
07:53 - structure that can hold more than one
07:55 - value a variable can hold one value an
07:58 - array can hold many and well everybody
08:00 - those are arrays in JavaScript

hey what's going on everybody so today I'm going to explain arrays in JavaScript think of an array as a variable like structure that can hold more than one value for example let's say we had a variable named fruit go ahead and pick a fruit I'll pick an apple our variable can store one value but we can turn a variable into an array and it can store more than one value and we can do so by enclosing all values with a set of straight brackets now my variable of fruit is now an array it can store more than one value just be sure that each value is comma separated this time I'll add an orange and a banana just to make it more obvious that this is an array I'm going to add an S so that my variable name is plural it's not mandatory but it helps with readability I now have an array of fruits but let me show you something if I were to console.log my array of fruits well JavaScript is going to print out all of the elements in this array each item each value is known as an element we have three elements if you need to access an individual element following the array you have to add an index number in closed and straight brackets if I would like the element at the first position that would have an index of zero that would give me an Apple fruits at index of one would be orange fruits at index of two is banana if I were to attempt to access the element at index 3 well it's undefined we only have three elements within our array zero one two arrays always begin with zero you can even change one of these elements by accessing that array at a given element let's access our array fruits at index zero I will set the sequel to be a coconut so now we have coconut orange banana let's change fruits at index one to be a coconut Apple coconut banana index two will be a coconut Apple orange coconut if I set fruits at index three to be a coconut let me console.log that too fruits at index three we can add a new element to that array otherwise to add an element there's a builtin method of arrays fruits dot push to push an element to the end I will add a coconut to the end of my array Apple orange banana coconut then we have pop is going to remove the last element Apple orange undefined the unshift method will add an element to the beginning take our array use the on shift method on shift I will add a mango to the beginning of my array mango Apple orange banana then we have shift to remove an element from the beginning fruits.shift now we have an orange banana and my last two elements are undefined to get the length of an array there is a length property let's create a new variable let num of fruits to store the number of fruits that we have type the array name dot length then let's console.log the number of fruits we have we have three fruits I'll add another I'll add a coconut to the end and we have four so that's how to get the length of an array there's a length property type the array name dot length we can find the index of an element if there's a match let index equals let's search for an apple fruits dot index of method what are we searching for let's search for an apple then I will display the index so our apple is located at index 0. let's search for an orange that's index one banana that's two coconut three what if we search for an element that doesn't exist like a mango well this method will return negative one that could be helpful within an if statement you can check to see if this method returns negative one then if it does that means the element wasn't found and you can let the user know if index equals negative one display that element wasn't found now if you would like to Loop through the elements and display them there's an easier way to do that you can use a for Loop so four there's up to three statements we'll need a counter or some sort of index let I equal zero that's the first statement we'll continue this as long as I is less than our fruits array dot length property then we will increment I by One if we have four elements we should execute this Loop four times during each iteration I will console.log our fruits array but the index instead of being like 0 1 2 3 a hard number we'll use our counter our index of I and let's get rid of that line now we should Loop through all of the elements of this array and print them out individually using a for Loop we can even increment by a different number like two I plus equals two so here we're only displaying the apple and the banana if I set index to be 1 then increment by 2 will display orange then coconut so using a for Loop there's a few different ways in which you can display the elements of an array if you need to display the order of this array in Reverse we can change this around we will set our counter I to be the length of our array then we'll continue as long as I is greater than or equal to zero then I minus minus there's one change I'm going to make we have undefined coconut banana orange Apple so the length of my array is four but if I were to access our array fruits at index 4 where would that be zero one two three that's out of bounds I'm going to set our index to be fruits.length minus one zero one two three our length is four minus one is a total of three now we're printing our array in Reverse coconut banana orange Apple there's also an enhanced for loop it's a shortcut to displaying the elements of an array you can write something like this let fruit of array fruits really this variable can be anything but I like to write a singular version of my array name then during each iteration I will display each fruit Apple orange banana coconut this is an enhanced for loop it's kind of like a shortcut to displaying the elements of an array if this array name were I don't know like meets you could say let meat of meats and then display each meat but of course they're still fruit that's a shortcut you can use now to sort an array you can use the sort method fruits dot sort and that should sort the elements in alphabetical order apple banana coconut orange to sort them in reverse order you can tack on the reverse method to the end fruits.sortmethod.reverse method now they're all backwards in Reverse alphabetical order orange coconut banana apple all right everybody so that's an introduction to arrays we'll have a lot of practice with this in the future so if you don't remember everything that's okay an array is a variable like structure that can hold more than one value a variable can hold one value an array can hold many and well everybody those are arrays in JavaScript
