With timestamps:

00:00 - all right well it's time that we discuss
00:02 - variables do you remember from middle
00:04 - school or elementary school when you
00:06 - learned algebra you had to solve for
00:08 - what the value of x was X was some
00:10 - representation of a value well that's
00:12 - kind of what a variable is in
00:13 - programming it's a container that stores
00:16 - a value the variable behaves as if it
00:18 - were the value it contains there's two
00:21 - steps to creating a variable declaration
00:23 - and assignment to use a variable we have
00:25 - to first declare it we'll use the let
00:28 - keyword then a unique variable name like
00:31 - X
00:32 - then a semicolon so what we've done is
00:34 - declaration each variable name needs to
00:37 - be unique if I were to declare another
00:39 - variable named X
00:41 - we would run into an error a syntax
00:43 - error identifier X has already been
00:45 - declared so your variable names need to
00:48 - be unique I can declare two variables X
00:50 - and Y and they both have different names
00:52 - that is fine but they can't have the
00:54 - same name the next step to creating a
00:57 - variable is to assign it a value once
00:59 - you declare your variable you don't need
01:01 - to declare it again so I'm going to
01:03 - assign X to equal some number like 100
01:06 - we can use this variable X and it will
01:09 - behave as if it was the value 100. let
01:12 - me demonstrate so if I was to
01:14 - counsel.log X
01:17 - well then it's going to display 100 if I
01:20 - were to change this value to 123 well X
01:24 - is now 123.
01:26 - you can do both declaration and
01:28 - assignment together that would look
01:30 - something like this
01:32 - let x equal 123 this is both declaration
01:36 - and assignment if you're creating a
01:38 - program and you know what your value
01:40 - should be you can assign them a value
01:42 - right away sometimes you may want to
01:44 - accept some user input so then you might
01:46 - do assignment later in two steps it's
01:49 - really up to you how you write your
01:50 - program there's a few different data
01:52 - types in JavaScript the first is number
01:55 - like 123. let's create a descriptive
01:58 - name for our variable like age we will
02:00 - store a user's age according to my
02:03 - analytics in YouTube the average age of
02:05 - my viewers is 25. so let's say that my
02:09 - age is 25.
02:10 - then if I was to console.log
02:14 - my age variable it would behave as if it
02:17 - were the number 25. let's create a few
02:19 - more variables
02:21 - another example of a number could be
02:23 - price let price equal
02:26 - 10.99 maybe it's 10.99 or some other
02:30 - unit of currency of your choosing
02:33 - then we will console.log price
02:36 - 10.99
02:37 - what about a GPA a grade point average
02:41 - my grade point average is a solid 2.1
02:44 - it's not great but C's get degrees
02:48 - console.log GPA 2.1
02:51 - using a template literal we can insert a
02:54 - variable using a placeholder within
02:56 - console.log I will use backticks let's
02:59 - write a sentence
03:01 - you are then to insert a variable use
03:04 - dollar sign curly braces
03:07 - place your variable name within the
03:09 - curly braces then we can continue our
03:11 - sentence you are variable age years old
03:16 - let's create another sentence using
03:18 - console.log
03:22 - the price is dollar sign curly braces
03:28 - price
03:29 - the price is 10.99 I'm going to insert a
03:34 - dollar sign before our price
03:37 - and that looks better feel free to
03:40 - choose some other unit of currency okay
03:42 - let's add a sentence to display our GPA
03:44 - console.log
03:49 - your GPA is colon space we're inserting
03:54 - a variable we need dollar sign curly
03:56 - braces we're displaying our GPA
03:59 - your GPA is 2.1 now if you need to
04:03 - display the data type of a variable
04:06 - you can use console.log
04:09 - then precede the variable with the type
04:12 - of keyword what is the type of age
04:16 - age is a number type
04:19 - price is also a number type same thing
04:22 - with GPA they're all numbers
04:25 - let's go over a different data type
04:30 - let's go over strings a string is a
04:33 - series of characters let's say we have a
04:36 - user's first name
04:39 - to create a string you can either use
04:41 - double quotes or single quotes
04:43 - personally I like double quotes
04:46 - then you can type in some characters
04:47 - like first name
04:50 - let's say my first name is bro feel free
04:52 - to pick your own first name
04:54 - I will display the type of my first name
04:57 - variable and it says it's a string a
05:00 - series of characters
05:02 - then I will display my name console.log
05:07 - first name
05:09 - and it is bro or whatever your first
05:11 - name is whatever you put here
05:13 - let's include our variable within a
05:16 - template literal
05:20 - your name is add a placeholder first
05:25 - name
05:26 - your name is bro
05:28 - what are some other examples of a string
05:30 - maybe somebody's favorite food
05:33 - favorite
05:34 - food
05:35 - my favorite food is pizza
05:39 - type in your favorite food
05:43 - console.log
05:47 - you like
05:49 - at our placeholder
05:52 - favorite food
05:56 - you like pizza
05:58 - maybe if I like something else like
05:59 - sushi well you like sushi
06:02 - okay another example of a string could
06:04 - be an email let email equals
06:08 - then type in your email
06:11 - I'm just going to make one up
06:13 - bro gmail.com
06:17 - console.log
06:21 - your email is
06:24 - email
06:27 - your email is bro gmail.com let me make
06:30 - the G lowercase
06:32 - now an important thing with strings is
06:34 - that strings can contain numbers after
06:37 - bro I'll add one two three
06:39 - so a string is a series of characters
06:41 - they can include numbers but we can't
06:44 - use these numbers for any sort of math
06:46 - strings have a different behavior from
06:48 - numbers numbers we can use in arithmetic
06:51 - Expressions strings not so much all
06:54 - right let's turn these lines into
06:55 - comments then I will discuss booleans
06:59 - okay booleans are either true or false
07:01 - typically they're used as Flags in your
07:03 - program
07:05 - let online equal true booleans are
07:09 - either true or false is somebody online
07:12 - or are they offline this is either true
07:14 - or false
07:16 - I will display the type of my variable
07:19 - online
07:20 - console.log type of online
07:24 - so online is a Boolean variable
07:28 - let's display our variable within a
07:30 - template literal
07:31 - type in whatever your first name is bro
07:34 - is online
07:37 - then I will insert a placeholder
07:39 - add my Boolean variable of online bro is
07:43 - online that is true if I were to change
07:46 - this to false
07:47 - bro is online is false booleans are
07:51 - typically used as a sort of flag
07:54 - so another example could be for sale is
07:57 - something for sale or not
07:59 - let's say that we are selling
08:03 - I don't know cars
08:05 - is this car for sale I could set this to
08:08 - be true or false
08:11 - let's console.log
08:13 - is this car for sale
08:18 - then I will add my Boolean variable for
08:21 - sale
08:22 - is this car for sale that is true
08:25 - another example let's say that somebody
08:27 - is enrolled in school like in college
08:30 - courses
08:31 - we could say let is student
08:35 - is somebody a student are they enrolled
08:37 - this can be true or false
08:40 - console.log
08:44 - enrolled
08:47 - colon space
08:49 - is student
08:53 - is the student enrolled in classes that
08:55 - is true so those are booleans they're
08:58 - either true or false typically we don't
09:00 - use them as direct output like you see
09:02 - here we usually use them with if
09:04 - statements to check something like if
09:06 - somebody is online do this if not do
09:08 - something else is a car for sale if
09:11 - that's true then display the car if it's
09:14 - not then hide it we'll have more
09:16 - practice with booleans when we reach if
09:18 - statements all right now what we're
09:20 - gonna do is we will close out of Dev
09:22 - tools we'll display some variables
09:24 - within our web page so let's delete
09:26 - everything we have
09:29 - I'll create three variables
09:31 - let
09:32 - full name equals type in your full name
09:38 - feel free to add a space between your
09:40 - first name and last name
09:42 - let age type in your age
09:46 - and let
09:49 - student
09:50 - equals if you're a student type true
09:53 - if you're not in school type false
09:56 - I am not in school anymore so I will
09:57 - type false we will go to our HTML file
10:01 - then add some HTML elements
10:04 - I will add three paragraph elements
10:07 - so that's one
10:09 - two three I will give my first paragraph
10:12 - an ID of P1
10:15 - then let's do the same with the other
10:18 - two paragraphs let's rename the second
10:20 - as P2
10:21 - and the third as P3
10:25 - so to change the text content of an HTML
10:28 - element
10:29 - we're going to type
10:31 - document meaning the document of our web
10:34 - page
10:35 - then we will get
10:37 - our element by its ID get element by ID
10:43 - then within a set of parentheses within
10:45 - a set of quotes we will select the ID
10:48 - that we need let's start with P1
10:51 - then add dot text content to change the
10:55 - text content
10:56 - then we will set this equal to a
10:59 - variable or a template literal
11:01 - let's begin with a variable so full name
11:07 - our P1 element should display your full
11:10 - name
11:11 - let's do this with P2
11:14 - I'm going to zoom out a little bit
11:17 - P2 dot text content equals age it says
11:21 - that I'm 25.
11:24 - and then P3
11:25 - let's display student or better yet is
11:29 - student let's change that
11:31 - is student
11:33 - false I am not a student but you might
11:36 - be though that might be true then let's
11:38 - display our variables along with some
11:40 - text using a template literal
11:43 - let's copy our full name
11:46 - your name is add a placeholder place our
11:50 - variable name
11:52 - your name is Bro Code or whatever your
11:54 - name is
11:56 - let's cut our Edge variable
11:59 - u r
12:01 - variable age years old you are 25 years
12:06 - old
12:07 - and then let's cut is student
12:11 - add a template literal
12:13 - let's say enrolled are you enrolled in
12:17 - school
12:18 - add a placeholder paste our variable
12:22 - enrolled that is false I am not in
12:25 - school anymore all right everybody so
12:27 - those are variables it's a container
12:29 - that stores a value the variable behaves
12:31 - as if it were the value it contains
12:33 - there's a couple different basic data
12:35 - types you have strings which is a series
12:37 - of text numbers and booleans there's
12:40 - more advanced data types but we'll cover
12:42 - that later and well those are variables
12:45 - in JavaScript

Cleaned transcript:

all right well it's time that we discuss variables do you remember from middle school or elementary school when you learned algebra you had to solve for what the value of x was X was some representation of a value well that's kind of what a variable is in programming it's a container that stores a value the variable behaves as if it were the value it contains there's two steps to creating a variable declaration and assignment to use a variable we have to first declare it we'll use the let keyword then a unique variable name like X then a semicolon so what we've done is declaration each variable name needs to be unique if I were to declare another variable named X we would run into an error a syntax error identifier X has already been declared so your variable names need to be unique I can declare two variables X and Y and they both have different names that is fine but they can't have the same name the next step to creating a variable is to assign it a value once you declare your variable you don't need to declare it again so I'm going to assign X to equal some number like 100 we can use this variable X and it will behave as if it was the value 100. let me demonstrate so if I was to counsel.log X well then it's going to display 100 if I were to change this value to 123 well X is now 123. you can do both declaration and assignment together that would look something like this let x equal 123 this is both declaration and assignment if you're creating a program and you know what your value should be you can assign them a value right away sometimes you may want to accept some user input so then you might do assignment later in two steps it's really up to you how you write your program there's a few different data types in JavaScript the first is number like 123. let's create a descriptive name for our variable like age we will store a user's age according to my analytics in YouTube the average age of my viewers is 25. so let's say that my age is 25. then if I was to console.log my age variable it would behave as if it were the number 25. let's create a few more variables another example of a number could be price let price equal 10.99 maybe it's 10.99 or some other unit of currency of your choosing then we will console.log price 10.99 what about a GPA a grade point average my grade point average is a solid 2.1 it's not great but C's get degrees console.log GPA 2.1 using a template literal we can insert a variable using a placeholder within console.log I will use backticks let's write a sentence you are then to insert a variable use dollar sign curly braces place your variable name within the curly braces then we can continue our sentence you are variable age years old let's create another sentence using console.log the price is dollar sign curly braces price the price is 10.99 I'm going to insert a dollar sign before our price and that looks better feel free to choose some other unit of currency okay let's add a sentence to display our GPA console.log your GPA is colon space we're inserting a variable we need dollar sign curly braces we're displaying our GPA your GPA is 2.1 now if you need to display the data type of a variable you can use console.log then precede the variable with the type of keyword what is the type of age age is a number type price is also a number type same thing with GPA they're all numbers let's go over a different data type let's go over strings a string is a series of characters let's say we have a user's first name to create a string you can either use double quotes or single

name variable and it says it's a string a series of characters then I will display my name console.log first name and it is bro or whatever your first name is whatever you put here let's include our variable within a template literal your name is add a placeholder first name your name is bro what are some other examples of a string maybe somebody's favorite food favorite food my favorite food is pizza type in your favorite food console.log you like at our placeholder favorite food you like pizza maybe if I like something else like sushi well you like sushi okay another example of a string could be an email let email equals then type in your email I'm just going to make one up bro gmail.com console.log your email is email your email is bro gmail.com let me make the G lowercase now an

okay booleans are either true or false typically they're used as Flags in your program let online equal true booleans are either true or false is somebody online or are they offline this is either true or false I will display the type of my variable online console.log type of online so online is a Boolean variable let's display our variable within a template literal type in whatever your first

as a sort of flag so another example could be for sale is something for sale or not let's say that we are selling I don't know cars is this car for sale I could set this to be true or false let's console.log is this car for sale then I will add my Boolean variable for sale is this car for sale that is true another example let's say that somebody is enrolled in school like in college courses we could say let is student is somebody a student are they enrolled this can be true or false console.log enrolled colon space is student is the student enrolled in classes that is true so those are booleans they're either true or false typically we don't use them as direct output like you see here we usually use them with if statements to check something like if somebody is online do this if not

be though that might be true then let's display our variables along with some text using a template literal let's copy our full name your name is add a placeholder place our variable name your name is
