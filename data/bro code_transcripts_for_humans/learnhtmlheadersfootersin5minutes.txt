00:00 - hello again friends it's me again today
00:02 - I will show you how we can create both a
00:04 - header and a footer for your web page
00:06 - header and footer elements are both
00:08 - semantic tags they describe their
00:10 - meaning to both the web browser and the
00:12 - developer they help organize your
00:14 - content and CSS properties can easily be
00:18 - applied to anything within these
00:20 - containers headers are used for
00:21 - introductory content at the top of your
00:24 - page such as a title a subtitle a logo a
00:28 - navigation bar but we haven't really
00:30 - discussed navigation bars yet Footers
00:32 - act as a container for holding
00:34 - concluding content at the bottom of your
00:36 - page such as an author a copyright or
00:40 - some contact information like a phone
00:42 - number or email alright so let's begin
00:46 - to create a header within our body we
00:49 - need a pair of header tags
00:51 - then for a footer you need a pair of
00:54 - footer tags
00:57 - personally what I like to do between the
00:59 - header and footer tags I'll create a
01:02 - pair of main tags for all of the main
01:04 - content within our web page it helps
01:06 - with organization we'll begin with the
01:08 - header though the header element is a
01:11 - container for holding introductory
01:12 - content at the top of our page this is
01:15 - where you may see a title
01:17 - like an H1 header element for our H1
01:20 - header I think welcome to pick your name
01:24 - or your business or organization I'll
01:27 - just use my YouTube channel name a
01:29 - header is a good container to hold the
01:31 - title for your web page you could
01:33 - include a logo or a navigation bar
01:35 - navigation bars are a little tricky we
01:37 - do need to know a little bit more CSS
01:39 - for navigation bars but let's include
01:41 - some hyperlinks and make like a really
01:43 - basic navigation bar okay
01:46 - href equals I won't set a location it's
01:50 - not really necessary for this example
01:52 - we'll just have a hyperlink that goes
01:54 - nowhere so we have home
01:56 - let's create three more hyperlinks
02:00 - home
02:02 - about us
02:04 - products
02:06 - and contact us
02:09 - the header of your document it also
02:11 - tends to be a good place to hold
02:13 - navigation links to then to make this a
02:15 - little more fancy I'm going to add a
02:17 - horizontal rule with a self-closing HR
02:20 - tag
02:21 - okay that's not bad another use of
02:24 - header and footer elements is that it
02:26 - makes CSS styling a little bit easier I
02:29 - haven't yet shown how we can apply CSS
02:31 - style sheets we're going to use a little
02:33 - bit of inline CSS all I'll do is change
02:36 - the background Dash color to be whatever
02:40 - color you want I'll pick medium
02:43 - purple anything within the header I
02:46 - would like to change the background
02:47 - color to purple or you could change the
02:50 - font or the font size anything else it's
02:53 - very helpful to put your content within
02:55 - a container
02:56 - So within my main section I'll include
02:58 - an image I do have one ready feel free
03:01 - to follow along if you want
03:03 - within my main element let's begin with
03:06 - the title for the main content I'm going
03:08 - to use a smaller heading like H4 what
03:11 - would be a good title for the main
03:13 - content
03:15 - check out these cool moves
03:19 - maybe I'll use a colon I'll include an
03:22 - image
03:23 - we need a self-closing image tag
03:25 - The Source will equal the name of my
03:28 - file including the extension
03:32 - and it is good practice to add some
03:34 - alternative text
03:36 - profile pic is good
03:39 - so there's my image then I'll add some
03:42 - text within a paragraph
03:45 - we need a pair of P tags I'll generate
03:47 - some sample text in vs code you can type
03:50 - lorem then tab
03:52 - and here are some sample text
03:54 - so that is the main content of my page
03:58 - lastly let's work on the footer the
04:00 - footer is a container for holding
04:02 - concluding content at the bottom of your
04:04 - page I'll begin with a horizontal rule
04:07 - because I think that looks good let's
04:09 - include some information about the
04:11 - author
04:13 - author colon type in your name
04:17 - I'll add a line break after
04:20 - so we have author
04:22 - then a copyright symbol using HTML to
04:25 - include the copyright symbol you can
04:27 - Type ampersand copy semicolon so we have
04:31 - a copyright symbol I'll add the text
04:34 - copy right
04:36 - reserved then add a break
04:41 - then I'll add an email
04:43 - this will be a link we need an anchor
04:45 - tag
04:46 - set the href attribute to be
04:49 - mail to colon then an email address I'll
04:53 - make one up bro code at fake.com
04:58 - close the anchor tag then I need some
05:00 - text
05:02 - bro code at fake.com feel free to use
05:05 - your own email I'll make my email a
05:07 - little bit smaller by using a pair of
05:09 - small tags
05:10 - so I enclose our hyperlink with small
05:16 - there we are
05:18 - and I'll change the background color to
05:21 - with the style attribute within the
05:23 - opening footer tag I will paste that
05:25 - style attribute I'll pick the same color
05:28 - of medium purple
05:29 - alright everybody so those are headers
05:32 - and Footers they help organize your
05:34 - content as well as make applying CSS a
05:37 - little bit easier because you can Target
05:39 - everything within the header or footer
05:41 - elements and those are headers and
05:43 - Footers in HTML
