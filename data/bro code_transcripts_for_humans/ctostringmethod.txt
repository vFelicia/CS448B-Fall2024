00:02 - all right welcome back everybody
00:03 - the tostring method the tostring method
00:06 - is an inherent method of
00:08 - objects its job is to convert an object
00:10 - to its
00:11 - string representation so that it is
00:13 - suitable for display
00:15 - so i have a class car cars have four
00:17 - fields i make a model a year and a color
00:20 - and i have a constructor to assign some
00:22 - of these fields
00:23 - so what we could do if we would like
00:25 - some of this information we can override
00:27 - the built-in tostring method of objects
00:30 - that includes cars too
00:31 - so let's create a car object car car
00:35 - equals new car then i need to pass in a
00:38 - make
00:38 - model year and color let's say that this
00:41 - is a
00:42 - chevy corvette
00:46 - the year is 2022 and the color
00:49 - is blue so within a writeline statement
00:53 - if i type the name of my object car
00:55 - there's actually a
00:56 - two string method and when we invoke
00:59 - this method
00:59 - let's take a look to see what happens so
01:02 - this displays
01:03 - the namespace followed by the type of
01:06 - the object that we're working with
01:07 - so we can actually override this method
01:09 - so that when we use the tostring method
01:12 - we can return a string representation of
01:14 - this object
01:15 - maybe we can display the make model year
01:18 - in color somehow
01:19 - so we'll need to override this method to
01:22 - string
01:22 - so let's do that here we're going to
01:25 - public then to override a method we have
01:28 - to use that override keyword
01:30 - then type to string and this might
01:33 - auto-generate for you
01:35 - so we're returning a string and by
01:38 - default this will return
01:39 - base to string what we can do instead is
01:42 - return something else we can return
01:44 - some sort of string representation
01:46 - that's suitable for display
01:48 - let's say that when i use the tostring
01:50 - method of my car object
01:51 - i'd like to return a sentence that says
01:54 - this is a
01:55 - make plus model a chevy corvette so
01:58 - let's do something like this
01:59 - let's say string
02:02 - message equals this
02:06 - is a plus make
02:09 - then i'll just add a space plus model
02:13 - really you can do whatever you want and
02:14 - then i'm going to return
02:16 - this string or i could take all of this
02:20 - copy it and then return
02:25 - this is a make plus model i could do
02:28 - that too and that would work
02:29 - so when i use the tostring method it's
02:31 - going to return this sentence
02:33 - and insert make and model this is a
02:36 - chevy corvette
02:38 - one thing you can do too you don't
02:39 - necessarily need to directly invoke the
02:41 - tostring method
02:43 - you can just type the name of the object
02:44 - and that will do the same thing
02:46 - so this will behind the scenes called
02:48 - the tostring method
02:50 - so before when we displayed our object
02:52 - with a writeline statement it would
02:54 - display the namespace
02:55 - plus the type of the object but if you
02:57 - were to override
02:58 - the tostring method you can return some
03:01 - sort of sentence or string
03:02 - representation of your object
03:04 - that is suitable for display so yeah
03:07 - that is the
03:08 - tostring method it converts an object to
03:10 - a string representation
03:12 - that is suitable for display and really
03:14 - you can type whatever you want here just
03:15 - be sure to return a string
03:17 - so yeah that is the two string method if
03:19 - you found this video helpful please be
03:21 - sure to give it a thumbs up
