00:02 - all right everybody we have to talk
00:03 - about
00:04 - auto implemented properties this is an
00:06 - intimidating name but don't worry it's
00:08 - actually fairly simple
00:09 - they are shortcuts when no additional
00:12 - logic
00:12 - is required within a property you do not
00:15 - have to define a field for a property
00:17 - and you only have to write get and or
00:20 - set inside the property here's an
00:21 - example i have a class car and what if
00:23 - we would like a
00:24 - model field and property so that might
00:27 - look something like this
00:28 - make sure to not make your field public
00:30 - for this example
00:31 - so this will be a string named model for
00:34 - a model of car
00:35 - and i would like to set up a property
00:37 - that has get
00:38 - and set accessors so that would be
00:42 - public string model with a capital m
00:46 - curly braces and then i need a get and
00:50 - set
00:50 - accessor all we'll do within the get
00:53 - accessor
00:54 - is return model
00:57 - and that's the field and a set will be
01:01 - model our field equals value
01:05 - and within my constructor i will set
01:08 - this
01:08 - dot model property make sure that you
01:11 - have capital m
01:13 - equals model whatever our parameter is
01:16 - so if you're not doing anything else
01:18 - within your getter and setter there's
01:20 - actually a shortcut to all of this
01:21 - and that's by using an auto implement
01:23 - property so this is what we'll do we're
01:25 - going
01:26 - to instead get rid of all this
01:29 - and type public string
01:33 - model with a capital m curly braces
01:38 - get semicolon set semicolon
01:42 - and this will do the same thing however
01:44 - it's a lot less to write
01:45 - so if there's no additional logic that
01:47 - you need besides
01:48 - you know setting the value and getting
01:51 - the current field
01:52 - well you can just use an auto
01:54 - implemented property and this will do
01:55 - the same thing let's test it
01:57 - so let's create a car object car car
01:59 - equals
02:00 - new car then pass in a model of car
02:03 - let's say a porsche this time
02:05 - and then i would like to display the
02:07 - car's model car
02:09 - dot model property with a capital m
02:12 - so there will still be a model field but
02:15 - it's hidden
02:16 - and of this car's model is a porsche
02:19 - so that's like a shortcut you can do an
02:22 - auto implemented property
02:23 - is a shortcut when no additional logic
02:26 - is required in the property
02:28 - you do not have to define a field for a
02:30 - property and you only have to write
02:32 - get and or set inside the property so
02:35 - yeah that
02:36 - is an auto implemented property if you
