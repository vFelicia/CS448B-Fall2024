00:00 - hello again friends it's me again today
00:02 - I will be explaining how we can delete
00:04 - documents in mongodb before we do begin
00:07 - this lesson I recommend exporting your
00:10 - collection we'll be deleting documents
00:12 - adding them back in is kind of a pain in
00:14 - the ass unless we're importing them so
00:16 - let's export our collection
00:18 - export query with filters that's fine
00:23 - select output
00:25 - you can export as a Json file or as a
00:27 - CSV file let's export our collection as
00:30 - a Json file you can also select a
00:32 - destination I'll place this file on my
00:34 - desktop just for convenience
00:37 - and Export we'll be importing this Json
00:40 - file at the end of this lesson and close
00:43 - within Compass to delete a document all
00:45 - you do is press the trash can icon then
00:48 - delete it's really easy in compass in
00:51 - the Shell it's a little different
00:53 - in the Shell to delete a document type
00:56 - DB
00:57 - dot the name of the collection students
00:59 - then there's delete one or delete many
01:02 - we'll begin with delete one
01:05 - we have one parameter a filter parameter
01:09 - it's very similar to The Finder method
01:10 - we list some criteria to search for
01:12 - let's delete anybody with the name of
01:16 - Larry
01:18 - that was acknowledged the delete account
01:20 - is one let's find our students DB Dot
01:23 - students.find
01:25 - and Larry is no longer at the bottom we
01:28 - have Patrick Sandy and Gary remaining
01:32 - we can use delete many to delete more
01:34 - than one document DB dot students dot
01:37 - delete many
01:39 - pass in our criteria
01:42 - anybody that has a full-time field set
01:45 - to false will delete
01:48 - so we have deleted one person that
01:51 - matches this criteria
01:53 - DB dot students dot find
01:57 - we have deleted Patrick
01:59 - we can delete any documents that are
02:01 - missing a field or if a field does exist
02:04 - we can delete that
02:05 - let's delete any document that is
02:08 - missing a registration date
02:10 - DB dot students dot delete many
02:16 - we are checking if there is a
02:18 - registration date field
02:20 - does this field not exist if it doesn't
02:24 - then delete that document we will use
02:27 - the exists operator colon false
02:31 - if this field doesn't exist delete that
02:35 - document
02:37 - so we have deleted two documents if we
02:40 - take a look at our students now
02:42 - db.students.find we no longer have any
02:45 - students so that's how to delete one or
02:48 - many documents with the mongodb shell
02:51 - now if we head back to compass then
02:53 - refresh we have no more students
02:56 - let's import our collection that we
02:58 - exported because we do need some data
03:00 - for this series add data import Json or
03:03 - CSV file
03:06 - we are looking for our students Json
03:08 - file select
03:10 - and import
03:12 - and we're done
03:13 - so that is how to delete documents in
03:16 - mongodb
