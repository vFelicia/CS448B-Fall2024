00:01 - hey everyone i'm going to try and
00:03 - explain everything i can about forms in
00:05 - about eight minutes to create a form
00:07 - element we'll need a pair of form tags
00:09 - there's an opening form tag and a
00:11 - closing form tag and depending on the
00:13 - user input that you need there is an
00:15 - input element and you can set the type
00:17 - attribute to whatever you need let's say
00:19 - we need some text from a user like a
00:21 - first name within our form there is a
00:24 - text box where we can enter in some user
00:25 - information so we should probably let
00:27 - the user know what we want them to type
00:29 - in i will precede this input element
00:31 - with a label
00:34 - let's say first name and a user can type
00:37 - in their first name now it is considered
00:39 - good practice to fill out a for
00:42 - attribute within the label and set this
00:44 - to whatever you want let's say fname and
00:47 - within the associated input elements i
00:49 - will set the id also equal to fname
00:53 - whatever's within the four attribute
00:55 - this does a couple things one if i was
00:57 - to click on this label this will select
01:00 - my input box it's also helpful for
01:03 - people that are using screen readers so
01:05 - that they can easily navigate your form
01:07 - there is also a name attribute when we
01:09 - submit this data what sort of name do we
01:12 - want to give that data think of it like
01:13 - a variable i will also name this fname
01:16 - as well within the input element there
01:18 - is a placeholder to display some default
01:20 - text to a user by setting the
01:23 - placeholder attribute equal to some text
01:26 - like spongebob so if i was to click
01:28 - within this input field and type
01:30 - something that will get rid of my
01:32 - placeholder let's create an input field
01:34 - for a last name and really we can just
01:36 - copy this and make a few changes to it
01:38 - so copy both the label and the input
01:41 - element
01:42 - uh let's change this from first name to
01:44 - last name
01:46 - change four as well to lname id will be
01:49 - i'll name and let's make name l name as
01:51 - well
01:52 - and the placeholder how about square
01:54 - pants
01:56 - these labels and input elements will
01:57 - appear on the same line to separate them
02:00 - and treat them as block level elements i
02:02 - will add each of these pairs to their
02:04 - own div element
02:09 - perhaps i'll add a line break as well
02:13 - okay now with forms there are built-in
02:15 - buttons too
02:18 - we will set the input
02:20 - type
02:21 - equal to reset so if i were to type in
02:24 - some text and click reset that will
02:26 - reset whatever's within my form and
02:28 - there is a submit button as well
02:32 - i will set the type equal to submit so
02:35 - currently our data doesn't have any
02:37 - place to go to so if i were to click the
02:39 - submit button this data is not going to
02:41 - go anywhere so if i need to send this
02:44 - data to a page i will list that page
02:46 - within the action attribute of my
02:49 - opening form element
02:51 - so we'll need the help of a dynamic
02:53 - programming language php for example
02:55 - we're not going to focus on
02:56 - functionality in this video but rather
02:58 - the structure of a form so if i need to
03:00 - send this to
03:02 - a php page i will list that php page
03:05 - within the action attribute there is
03:07 - also an associated method attribute two
03:10 - common values are get and post
03:13 - get is considered insecure it's going to
03:16 - append your data to the url of your web
03:19 - page so for example if i set the method
03:21 - to get and type in some information and
03:24 - click submit it's going to append my
03:26 - data to the end of my url so it's going
03:29 - to add a question mark then all of my
03:31 - data if you need to submit some secure
03:33 - information like a password do not use
03:35 - get i would say that this is useful for
03:37 - things like search boxes if a user needs
03:40 - to navigate your web page for maybe some
03:42 - sort of keyword so it's better to use
03:44 - post to submit some secure information
03:46 - but this isn't going to do anything
03:48 - obviously because we do not have a
03:49 - server set up now there is a required
03:52 - boolean attribute you can add if
03:54 - somebody needs to submit some
03:55 - information they are required to fill
03:58 - out any input elements that have this
04:00 - boolean attribute of required so if i
04:02 - just attempt to submit this without
04:04 - typing in anything there is a small
04:06 - pop-up box that says please fill out
04:08 - this field all right i'm going to go
04:10 - kind of quick through these next input
04:12 - elements just because i think we have
04:14 - the hang of the general context of input
04:16 - elements so next we have password fields
04:19 - you set the type equal to password so if
04:22 - somebody types in characters they will
04:24 - be hidden if you need to set a max size
04:26 - of your password there is a max length
04:29 - attribute let's set this to maybe 12 so
04:31 - we can type in no more than 12
04:33 - characters for a password and you can
04:35 - also add that required boolean attribute
04:38 - too
04:38 - for an email element set the type equal
04:41 - to email
04:45 - in order to submit an email we need an
04:47 - app character within our email otherwise
04:49 - we cannot submit this information and
04:51 - perhaps i'll add a placeholder as well
04:54 - placeholder equals s
04:56 - pants at gmail.com
05:00 - so there is our placeholder for a
05:02 - telephone number you're going to set the
05:04 - type equal to tell
05:07 - and i do have a placeholder as well if
05:10 - you need the user to type in a date like
05:12 - a birth date there is a type date which
05:16 - includes an interactive calendar to
05:18 - select a date
05:19 - a user can type in a number if you set
05:22 - the type equal to number let's say that
05:24 - the user is buying something from a
05:26 - store there are some arrows where they
05:28 - can increase or decrease the quantity
05:30 - but we should probably place some limits
05:32 - they can type in basically whatever
05:33 - number they want they want negative one
05:35 - billion items
05:37 - so we can set the min and the max i'll
05:39 - set the min equal to zero and of the max
05:42 - equal to what about 99
05:45 - and you can also set a default value too
05:47 - i'll set the default value equal to one
05:50 - next we have radio buttons with radio
05:52 - buttons we can only select one radio
05:54 - button from any one group perhaps we'll
05:56 - have the user select a title are they a
05:58 - mr a miss or a doctor
06:01 - so i'm going to create a pair of labels
06:04 - and input for each option that we have
06:07 - so we will have a mr option
06:09 - miss
06:11 - and
06:12 - phd okay i will set the input type equal
06:16 - to radio and then do that with each of
06:18 - these pairs
06:21 - so we can select more than one because
06:23 - these are all not within the same group
06:26 - to set them all within the same group we
06:28 - will all have them have the same
06:29 - matching name
06:31 - let's say that the name will be title
06:34 - so therefore we can only select one now
06:36 - since they're all within the same group
06:38 - and that's kind of the idea behind radio
06:39 - buttons you can only select one and we
06:42 - will set an associated value of let's
06:45 - say mister for the first value
06:48 - misses for the second
06:50 - and doctor for the last one
06:53 - then i'm just going to precede all of
06:54 - these with a separate label
06:58 - uh let's say title
07:01 - and i will set the four attribute equal
07:03 - to title and within each of these radio
07:06 - button labels when i click on one of
07:08 - these labels i also want to be able to
07:09 - select one of these radio buttons so i
07:12 - will set the for attribute equal to a
07:14 - unique id so let's say mr
07:17 - the id will be mister
07:20 - and repeat the same steps
07:27 - okay so when we click on these labels we
07:29 - should be able to select our radio
07:30 - buttons
07:31 - nice
07:32 - with drop down menus instead of a type
07:35 - we are going to use a pair of select
07:37 - tags so there's an opening select tag
07:39 - and a closing select tag and we list
07:42 - individual options within the select
07:44 - element
07:46 - we'll give our user three options from
07:48 - this drop down menu they can pay with a
07:51 - visa a mastercard or a gift card
07:54 - and i will give each of these a value
08:01 - okay we now have a payment field and the
08:04 - user can select an option from this drop
08:06 - down menu
08:07 - and the last input type i will explain
08:09 - in this video is the checkbox type so
08:12 - let's say we have a subscribe button and
08:14 - you can go ahead and smash that
08:16 - subscribe button so just set the type
08:18 - equal to checkbox for well a checkbox
08:21 - well yeah everybody that's how to create
08:23 - an html form there's still some more
08:25 - advanced input types we did not cover
08:27 - but these are the very basics i would
08:29 - say if you found this video helpful
08:31 - please remember to smash that like
08:32 - button leave a random comment down below
08:34 - and subscribe if you'd like to become a
