00:00 - hello everybody so in today's topic I'm
00:02 - going to be discussing some basic
00:04 - arithmetic and PHP I'll divide this
00:07 - video into different sections first we
00:09 - have arithmetic operators then the
00:12 - increment and decrement operators
00:13 - followed by operator precedence let's
00:16 - begin with arithmetic operators in my
00:19 - example we have three variables X
00:22 - will equal a number like 10.
00:25 - then we have Y which I'll set to be 2
00:29 - then Z we'll assign z a value later I
00:33 - will set that to be null if I would like
00:35 - to add X and Y together then store the
00:38 - result within Z we'll have to use some
00:40 - addition I could write something like
00:42 - this
00:43 - Z equals our variable X Plus
00:48 - our variable y then I will Echo whatever
00:51 - Z is
00:54 - so 10 plus 2 that's 12.
00:57 - so that's addition
00:59 - I'll go through these pretty quick
01:01 - they're fairly straightforward
01:03 - so 10 minus y would be subtraction
01:08 - x minus y store the results in z
01:12 - the result is 8.
01:14 - now multiplication
01:16 - that is an asterisk
01:20 - 10 times 2 is 20.
01:26 - division is a forward slash
01:29 - 10 divided by 2 that is 5.
01:34 - to raise a base to a given power you use
01:37 - double asterisks
01:39 - 10 to the power of 2
01:41 - is 100 10 times 10 is 100.
01:46 - then we have the modulus operator that
01:49 - will give you the remainder of any
01:51 - division
01:53 - X modulus y
01:56 - well 10 divides by 2 evenly the
01:58 - remainder is zero
02:00 - if y was 3 imagine that we have a group
02:03 - of 10 students and they need to break
02:06 - into groups of three there is going to
02:07 - be one student that's remaining so the
02:10 - percent sign the modulus operator gives
02:13 - you the remainder of any division it's
02:15 - really helpful for determining if a
02:17 - number is even or odd you would just say
02:19 - modulus too if the remainder is 1 that
02:22 - number is odd if it's zero then it's
02:25 - even
02:25 - so those are basic arithmetic operators
02:29 - now we'll cover increment and decrement
02:31 - operators I have a variable which we
02:34 - will name counter
02:36 - I will set counter to be 0 to begin with
02:39 - if I need to increment this variable by
02:41 - 1 as if we're counting normally I would
02:44 - have to write an expression such as this
02:47 - our counter equals our counter plus one
02:52 - then let's Echo
02:54 - our counter variable
02:58 - so the result is one this can be
03:01 - cumbersome to write a shortcut you could
03:03 - do if incrementing a variable by one is
03:06 - replace this part of our expression with
03:08 - plus plus
03:10 - take the variable then add plus plus
03:13 - that will increment your variable by one
03:15 - plus plus is the increment operator for
03:19 - decrement you would use minus minus
03:23 - our counter is now at negative one
03:25 - if I were to set our counter to 10
03:28 - after decrementing it's now nine
03:31 - use plus plus to increment minus minus
03:34 - two decrement
03:35 - you can increment by a given value too
03:38 - if I would like to count by twos let's
03:40 - set counter to be zero
03:43 - instead of plus plus you would write
03:45 - plus equals then some number counter
03:49 - plus equals two will increment my
03:52 - variable by two
03:53 - plus equals three would be three
03:57 - on the flip side to decrement by a given
03:59 - value you would use minus equal some
04:01 - number so zero minus equals two will
04:05 - decrement my variable by two
04:08 - minus equals 3 would be well 3. so that
04:12 - is the increment and decrement operators
04:15 - lastly we have operator precedence given
04:19 - a complex arithmetic expression such as
04:21 - this example in which order do we solve
04:24 - each part of this expression
04:26 - we would begin with parentheses
04:28 - beginning from left to right if there's
04:30 - anything within parentheses we would
04:33 - solve that first
04:34 - for example with my expression let's
04:36 - Echo whatever the total currently is so
04:39 - the total for me is 2.999 beginning from
04:43 - left to right solve anything within
04:45 - parentheses first we currently don't
04:47 - have any parentheses then comes any
04:49 - exponents so beginning from left to
04:52 - right look for any exponents we do have
04:54 - 5 to the power of six let's see what
04:57 - that is 5 to the power of five
05:00 - do it a third time fourth time fifth
05:03 - time sixth time
05:05 - fifteen thousand six hundred twenty five
05:12 - beginning from left to right solve any
05:14 - multiplication division then modulus
05:17 - modulo is that the right term so we have
05:20 - addition subtraction here we go we have
05:22 - multiplication
05:24 - three times four that's twelve then we
05:27 - have division
05:28 - 12 divided by fifteen thousand six
05:31 - hundred twenty five is point zero zero
05:34 - zero seven six eight
05:37 - foreign
05:38 - then lastly addition and subtraction we
05:42 - have some addition one plus two is three
05:44 - three minus this number
05:47 - point zero zero zero seven six eight
05:52 - is
05:53 - our result
05:58 - 2.99232 that's operator precedence
06:01 - if you have a complex equation solve
06:03 - anything within parentheses first then
06:06 - any exponents multiplication division
06:08 - modulus then lastly addition and
06:11 - subtraction all right everybody in
06:13 - conclusion we have discussed arithmetic
06:15 - operators addition subtraction
06:17 - multiplication division exponents and
06:19 - modulus incremented decrement operators
06:22 - you can take a variable add plus plus to
06:24 - increment it or minus minus two
06:27 - decrement it then lastly operator
06:29 - precedence and well everybody that is
06:31 - basic arithmetic in PHP

hello everybody so in today's topic I'm going to be discussing some basic arithmetic and PHP I'll divide this video into different sections first we have arithmetic operators then the increment and decrement operators followed by operator precedence let's begin with arithmetic operators in my example we have three variables X will equal a number like 10. then we have Y which I'll set to be 2 then Z we'll assign z a value later I will set that to be null if I would like to add X and Y together then store the result within Z we'll have to use some addition I could write something like this Z equals our variable X Plus our variable y then I will Echo whatever Z is so 10 plus 2 that's 12. so that's addition I'll go through these pretty quick they're fairly straightforward so 10 minus y would be subtraction x minus y store the results in z the result is 8. now multiplication that is an asterisk 10 times 2 is 20. division is a forward slash 10 divided by 2 that is 5. to raise a base to a given power you use double asterisks 10 to the power of 2 is 100 10 times 10 is 100. then we have the modulus operator that will give you the remainder of any division X modulus y well 10 divides by 2 evenly the remainder is zero if y was 3 imagine that we have a group of 10 students and they need to break into groups of three there is going to be one student that's remaining so the percent sign the modulus operator gives you the remainder of any division it's really helpful for determining if a number is even or odd you would just say modulus too if the remainder is 1 that number is odd if it's zero then it's even so those are basic arithmetic operators now we'll cover increment and decrement operators I have a variable which we will name counter I will set counter to be 0 to begin with if I need to increment this variable by 1 as if we're counting normally I would have to write an expression such as this our counter equals our counter plus one then let's Echo our counter variable so the result is one this can be cumbersome to write a shortcut you could do if incrementing a variable by one is replace this part of our expression with plus plus take the variable then add plus plus that will increment your variable by one plus plus is the increment operator for decrement you would use minus minus our counter is now at negative one if I were to set our counter to 10 after decrementing it's now nine use plus plus to increment minus minus two decrement you can increment by a given value too if I would like to count by twos let's set counter to be zero instead of plus plus you would write plus equals then some number counter plus equals two will increment my variable by two plus equals three would be three on the flip side to decrement by a given value you would use minus equal some number so zero minus equals two will decrement my variable by two minus equals 3 would be well 3. so that is the increment and decrement operators lastly we have operator precedence given a complex arithmetic expression such as this example in which order do we solve each part of this expression we would begin with parentheses beginning from left to right if there's anything within parentheses we would solve that first for example with my expression let's Echo whatever the total currently is so the total for me is 2.999 beginning from left to right solve anything within parentheses first we currently don't have any parentheses then comes any exponents so beginning from left to right look for any exponents we do have 5 to the power of six let's see what that is 5 to the power of five do it a third time fourth time fifth time sixth time fifteen thousand six hundred twenty five beginning from left to right solve any multiplication division then modulus modulo is that the right term so we have addition subtraction here we go we have multiplication three times four that's twelve then we have division 12 divided by fifteen thousand six hundred twenty five is point zero zero zero seven six eight foreign then lastly addition and subtraction we have some addition one plus two is three three minus this number point zero zero zero seven six eight is our result 2.99232 that's operator precedence if you have a complex equation solve anything within parentheses first then any exponents multiplication division modulus then lastly addition and subtraction all right everybody in conclusion we have discussed arithmetic operators addition subtraction multiplication division exponents and modulus incremented decrement operators you can take a variable add plus plus to increment it or minus minus two decrement it then lastly operator precedence and well everybody that is basic arithmetic in PHP
