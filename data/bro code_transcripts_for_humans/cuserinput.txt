00:02 - hey uh welcome back in this video i'm
00:04 - gonna show you all how we can accept
00:06 - user input in c now if you're using vs
00:08 - code we need to switch from using our
00:10 - output tab to terminal and one way in
00:13 - which we can make that change is by
00:15 - going to file preferences settings
00:18 - search for code runner
00:20 - and then check this run in terminal so
00:22 - then when we run our code it will now
00:24 - display in terminal which accepts user
00:27 - input output doesn't because well it's
00:29 - only for output and you can ignore this
00:31 - this is a powershell command that will
00:33 - compile and run your c program but if
00:35 - you prefer instead of powershell you can
00:37 - use command prompt but you would need to
00:39 - manually compile and run your code since
00:41 - i'm using windows that would be a gcc
00:44 - the name of your c program helloworld.c
00:47 - that will compile your program into an
00:49 - executable named a.exe
00:52 - then just type that to run it but i'll
00:53 - stick with using powershell just to kind
00:55 - of simplify things okay now how can we
00:57 - accept user input let's declare a
01:00 - variable age but not yet assign it
01:02 - next we're going to create a prompt to
01:04 - ask the user for their age and we'll ask
01:07 - how
01:08 - old are you
01:10 - to accept user input we can use the scan
01:13 - f function it's kind of the inverse of
01:15 - printf printf is used to display
01:17 - something as output scanf is used to
01:20 - read input what we're going to place
01:22 - within our scanf function is the format
01:25 - specifier of the variable we will insert
01:27 - a value into if we need to accept a
01:30 - number an integer as input the
01:32 - corresponding format specifier is
01:35 - percent d
01:37 - then add a comma the name of the
01:39 - variable but precede the variable name
01:42 - with an ampersand that is the address of
01:45 - operator let's print a message that
01:47 - contains the value stored within our
01:49 - variable edge u
01:52 - r
01:53 - percent
01:54 - d
01:55 - years old
01:56 - so this is our format specifier it
01:58 - functions as a placeholder and i would
02:00 - like to display the value contained
02:02 - within my edge variable so things are
02:05 - getting a little bit difficult to read
02:06 - i'm just going to precede this with a
02:08 - new line
02:09 - okay let's try that again how old are
02:12 - you let's say that i'm 21 not anymore
02:14 - but let's pretend that i still am
02:16 - you are 21 years old that's basically
02:20 - how to accept user input you use the
02:22 - scanf function
02:24 - use the format specifier of the variable
02:27 - list the variable appreciated with the
02:29 - address of operator let's try this again
02:32 - but instead accept a string from a user
02:34 - like a name we need to declare an array
02:36 - of characters and set asides so let's
02:38 - create a character array named name
02:42 - now with character arrays we can't
02:44 - change the size of the array after the
02:46 - program is already running let's set a
02:48 - max size of maybe 25 bytes for this
02:51 - array if we go over this limit this will
02:53 - cause a buffer overflow and let's ask a
02:56 - user for their name so we'll create a
02:58 - prompt
02:59 - printf
03:02 - what's
03:03 - your
03:04 - name and i again will use scanf
03:08 - list the appropriate format specifier
03:10 - for character arrays which is percent s
03:13 - then our variable name and use the
03:16 - address of operator then at the end
03:18 - we'll display our name
03:19 - printf
03:22 - hello
03:23 - percent s
03:25 - how are you
03:27 - then comma name and before we run this
03:30 - i'm just going to add some new line
03:31 - characters just to make everything
03:33 - easier to read
03:35 - okay let's try it
03:39 - what's your name i'll type in just my
03:41 - first name not including any white
03:43 - spaces
03:44 - how old are you 21.
03:46 - hello bro how are you you are 21 years
03:49 - old so now this time let's type in a
03:52 - first and last name because this is
03:54 - going to act a little bit bizarre what's
03:56 - your name bro
03:57 - code and this is separated with the
03:59 - white space
04:00 - hit enter
04:01 - hello bro it did not include my last
04:04 - name how are you you are zero years old
04:06 - so using the scan of function we will
04:09 - read up to any white spaces so if your
04:12 - user input is going to include a white
04:14 - space we need to use a different
04:16 - function and that is the f gets function
04:21 - f gets
04:22 - parentheses
04:23 - and there are three things we will list
04:25 - within the f gets function the name of
04:28 - the variable and we do not need the
04:31 - address of operator that ampersand for
04:33 - this
04:34 - then we need to set an input size i will
04:37 - set this to 25 to match the size of our
04:39 - array
04:41 - and then std in which means standard
04:44 - input so using this function we can read
04:47 - any white spaces
04:49 - what's your name i'll type in a first
04:51 - name and a last name
04:53 - how old are you 21.
04:55 - hello bro code and notice that our
04:57 - output is actually being displayed on
04:59 - the next line that's because when you
05:01 - use the f gets function it will include
05:04 - the new line character when you hit
05:06 - enter if you need to get rid of that new
05:08 - line character at the end so that it's
05:09 - not included with your input here's what
05:11 - we can do it's a little advanced but
05:13 - we'll cover this in future videos we'll
05:15 - include this import
05:17 - include
05:19 - string dot h
05:22 - so using this import we can work with
05:24 - strings all we're going to do is edit
05:26 - our string and get rid of that new line
05:27 - character at the end what i'm about to
05:29 - show you will look a little bit advanced
05:30 - but it's going to make more sense when
05:32 - we get to the video on string functions
05:35 - type the name of the variable followed
05:36 - by a set of straight brackets
05:39 - type str len this gets the length
05:43 - subtract one and we will set the sequel
05:45 - to backslash zero that will get rid of
05:48 - the new line character so again this is
05:50 - a little bit advanced for us but it'll
05:52 - make more sense in future videos when we
05:54 - get to the video on string functions and
05:57 - let's try this one last time
05:59 - what's your name
06:01 - type in a first name and a last name hit
06:03 - enter how old are you
06:05 - hello bro code how are you you are 21
06:08 - years old if you need to accept a string
06:11 - from a user that includes white spaces
06:13 - like a first name and a last name you'll
06:16 - want to use fgets in place of scanf
06:18 - because scanf can't read those white
06:20 - spaces it stops right there but it will
06:22 - include that new line character when you
06:24 - hit enter
06:26 - so you can do some string formatting
06:28 - just to get rid of that new line
06:29 - character and like i said this statement
06:31 - here will make more sense when we reach
06:33 - the video on string functions but yeah
06:35 - basically that's how you can accept user
06:37 - input you can use the scanf function if
06:40 - you need to accept a string of
06:41 - characters that includes white spaces
06:44 - you want to use fgets instead so yeah
06:46 - that's how to accept user input and see
06:49 - if you found this video helpful please
