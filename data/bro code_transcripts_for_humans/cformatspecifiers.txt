00:02 - all right welcome back everybody
00:03 - in this video i'm going to show you
00:04 - while a few extra things that we can do
00:06 - with format specifiers
00:08 - using a format specifier within a printf
00:10 - statement
00:11 - we can define and format a type of data
00:14 - to be displayed
00:15 - to use a format specifier you use a
00:17 - percent sign then follow that percent
00:19 - sign with a certain character depending
00:21 - on the type of data you would like to
00:22 - display
00:23 - let's say that we have three variables
00:25 - maybe we have an online store or
00:26 - something like that
00:28 - so let's say that these are of the float
00:30 - data type
00:31 - and we'll have three items for sale item
00:33 - one and make up some price
00:34 - let's say that the first item is five
00:37 - dollars and seventy five cents
00:39 - and we have item two and this will be
00:42 - ten dollars even and then we have item
00:45 - three
00:46 - and this will be one hundred dollars and
00:47 - ninety nine cents so let's display item
00:50 - one item two and item three with a
00:52 - printf statement
00:53 - printf and within a string let's say
00:56 - item
00:57 - one colon space then i'll add a dollar
01:01 - sign
01:01 - wherever you would like to insert a
01:03 - value or variable
01:04 - you will use that format specifier the
01:07 - percent sign
01:07 - so after my dollar sign i'll add item
01:10 - one
01:11 - so that would be percent then for floats
01:13 - you need f and then after the string add
01:15 - comma item one then let's just make sure
01:18 - that this works
01:19 - so we're going to be formatting this
01:21 - output what if we don't want all the
01:23 - zeros
01:23 - we can set the decimal precision of a
01:26 - float or double
01:27 - after the format specifier add a dot and
01:30 - the amount of digits you would like to
01:31 - display
01:32 - if i would only like to display two
01:33 - digits after the percent i will add
01:36 - point two and this will only display two
01:39 - digits
01:40 - for the amount of cents that we owe okay
01:42 - now let's do the same thing
01:43 - for items two and three so item two
01:46 - item two item three item three
01:50 - okay then let's add a new line character
01:52 - because i forgot so
01:54 - new line new line and new line
01:58 - much better another thing that we can do
02:00 - with format specifiers is that we can
02:02 - set a
02:03 - minimum field width so just add a number
02:06 - after the percent sign let's say that i
02:08 - would like to allocate eight spaces
02:10 - worth of room to display my number
02:12 - so after the percent sign but before the
02:15 - decimal
02:15 - add how many spaces you would like to
02:17 - set for the minimum field width
02:19 - let's say eight and let's see the new
02:22 - output
02:22 - okay there we go however it's all right
02:24 - aligned if you would like this left
02:26 - aligned
02:26 - you would use a negative sign after the
02:29 - percent to left align all this
02:31 - this would be negative whatever number
02:33 - you would like to allocate so the number
02:36 - is left justified but we still have all
02:38 - of this room after
02:39 - so that's what a format specifier is it
02:42 - defines and formats a type of data to be
02:45 - displayed
02:46 - so place a format specifier within a
02:48 - string use a certain character for the
02:50 - type of data you would like to display
02:52 - you can set decimal precision for floats
02:54 - and doubles
02:55 - you can set a minimum field width to
02:57 - display your output
02:59 - if you would like to line things up like
03:00 - you can see here and you can left or
03:02 - right align your output
03:04 - so yeah those are format specifiers if
