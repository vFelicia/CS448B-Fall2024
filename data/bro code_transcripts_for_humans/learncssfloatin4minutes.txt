00:00 - all right let's get started everybody so
00:02 - the float property the float property
00:04 - allows other elements to flow around it
00:07 - this is particularly useful with images
00:10 - and Block Level elements like div
00:12 - sections in my example I have a box
00:15 - that's made out of a div element it
00:18 - occupies the entire width of the space
00:20 - in my web browser and the elements
00:23 - afterwards are kind of pushed underneath
00:24 - it is possible utilizing the float
00:27 - property to have this text wrap around
00:30 - this Block Level element and we do that
00:32 - with the float property here's what
00:34 - we're going to do for this demonstration
00:37 - you will need two images I have an image
00:40 - of a Pokeball and another one of Pikachu
00:43 - feel free to pick your own images we're
00:45 - going to insert an image an image is a
00:48 - block level element I will set the
00:51 - source equal to B the name or the
00:54 - relative file path of that image
00:56 - so mine is pokeball.png
01:01 - but I'm going to change the height so
01:03 - it's a little bit smaller
01:05 - height equals
01:08 - let's try 150.
01:10 - I'm also going to create a few
01:12 - paragraphs of text
01:14 - in vs code you can type lorem then press
01:17 - tab to generate some text I'm pretty
01:19 - sure you know that already though
01:21 - let's create four paragraphs one two
01:24 - three four
01:26 - my first image is taking up the entire
01:29 - width of my viewport all this text is
01:32 - being pushed underneath to make this
01:34 - text wrap around this image and occupy
01:37 - that space
01:39 - we will set the float property of the
01:41 - image I'm going to give this image an ID
01:44 - though ID
01:46 - image one
01:47 - IMG one for short
01:50 - within my style sheet I will select the
01:53 - ID of
01:54 - image one
01:56 - set the float property to either left or
01:59 - right we'll begin with left though
02:02 - then save everything
02:06 - all of those paragraphs are now wrapping
02:08 - around the right side of my image
02:10 - because we're floating left
02:12 - I'll add a little bit of margin though
02:14 - on the right hand side
02:16 - margin right I think 10 pixels is fine
02:21 - and that looks pretty good
02:23 - you can also float an image to the right
02:25 - let's change float to be right and now
02:28 - the image is on the right hand side
02:31 - if I were to adjust the size of my
02:33 - window the text just flows around the
02:36 - image
02:37 - which looks pretty nice
02:39 - all right let's change that back to left
02:42 - let's create a second image
02:44 - we'll place the image between the second
02:47 - and third paragraphs
02:49 - so my second image is pikachu.png
02:54 - pikachu.png
02:55 - the height will be the same
02:57 - I'll give this image an idea of image
03:00 - two
03:01 - this image isn't floating
03:04 - again the text is not wrapping around
03:06 - the image
03:08 - let's take image two
03:12 - we will float this image to the right
03:17 - I'll add some margin to the left as well
03:19 - margin Dash left
03:22 - let's do 10 pixels
03:24 - yeah there we go that looks pretty good
03:26 - basically speaking the float property
03:28 - allows other elements to flow around it
03:31 - now there is one thing I want to show
03:33 - you all out of border around the body of
03:36 - our document
03:37 - let's select our body element
03:41 - I will create a border that is three
03:43 - pixel solid
03:46 - now check this out
03:49 - with my second image it's overflowing
03:53 - outside of the container that it's in
03:55 - the body of my document there is one
03:58 - change we can make to our container our
04:00 - body with our container I will set the
04:03 - display property to be
04:06 - blow Dash root
04:08 - now anything that's floating will stay
04:11 - within the container it's not going to
04:13 - overflow
04:14 - Pikachu is still within the Box
04:16 - alright everybody in conclusion the
04:19 - float property allows other elements to
04:21 - flow around it and that is the float
04:23 - property in CSS

Cleaned transcript:

all right let's get started everybody so the float property the float property allows other elements to flow around it this is particularly useful with images and Block Level elements like div sections in my example I have a box that's made out of a div element it occupies the entire width of the space in my web browser and the elements afterwards are kind of pushed underneath it is possible utilizing the float property to have this text wrap around this Block Level element and we do that with the float property here's what we're going to do for this demonstration you will need two images I have an image of a Pokeball and another one of Pikachu feel free to pick your own images we're going to insert an image an image is a block level element I will set the source equal to B the name or the relative file path of that image so mine is pokeball.png but I'm going to change the height so it's a little bit smaller height equals let's try 150. I'm also going to create a few paragraphs of text in vs code you can type lorem then press tab to generate some text I'm pretty sure you know that already though let's create four paragraphs one two three four my first image is taking up the entire width of my viewport all this text is being pushed underneath to make this text wrap around this image and occupy that space we will set the float property of the image I'm going to give this image an ID though ID image one IMG one for short within my style sheet I will select the ID of image one set the float property to either left or right we'll begin with left though then save everything all of those paragraphs are now wrapping around the right side of my image because we're floating left I'll add a little bit of margin though on the right hand side margin right I think 10 pixels is fine and that looks pretty good you can also float an image to the right let's change float to be right and now the image is on the right hand side if I were to adjust the size of my window the text just flows around the image which looks pretty nice all right let's change that back to left let's create a second image we'll place the image between the second and third paragraphs so my second image is pikachu.png pikachu.png the height will be the same I'll give this image an idea of image two this image isn't floating again the text is not wrapping around the image let's take image two we will float this image to the right I'll add some margin to the left as well margin Dash left let's do 10 pixels yeah there we go that looks pretty good basically speaking the float property allows other elements to flow around it now there is one thing I want to show you all out of border around the body of our document let's select our body element I will create a border that is three pixel solid now check this out with my second image it's overflowing outside of the container that it's in the body of my document there is one change we can make to our container our body with our container I will set the display property to be blow Dash root now anything that's floating will stay within the container it's not going to overflow Pikachu is still within the Box alright everybody in conclusion the float property allows other elements to flow around it and that is the float property in CSS
