00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's your
bro here and in this video I'm gonna
00:03 - teach you guys how we can use if
statements in C++ let's get into it
00:09 - if statements are pretty sweet because
it's like a basic form of
00:13 - decision-making we can specify some
condition and then if our condition that
00:18 - we specify is true we can have our
program do something if that condition
00:23 - is not true we can skip that or have a
program do something else so in C++ this
00:28 - is what you do to create an if statement
you just type in if then you need a set
00:32 - of parentheses and then a set of curly
brackets so anything within the
00:38 - parentheses will be our condition it's
like the rule we're going to do whatever
00:42 - is within the subset of code between
these two curly brackets if this
00:47 - condition that we specify is true so
there's many different things we can use
00:52 - as a condition but I think we'll just
start with something simple let's say
00:56 - that we want to check to see if
somebody's age is equal to 18 first
01:00 - let's create a variable we can say int
age equals 18 and then within the
01:06 - parentheses of the if statement we can
check to see if age is equal to 18
01:11 - honestly we can really do anything with
this statements we can check just about
01:14 - anything but let's check to see if age
is equal to 18 now if you're checking to
01:21 - see if one value is equal to another you
don't just use a single equal sign that
01:26 - is the assignment operator so if you
were to say age equals 18 well C++
01:31 - thinks you're attempting to assign the
value of 18 to the variable age so if
01:37 - you want to compare if two values are
equal you need to use two equal signs
01:42 - and this is also known as the equals to
comparison operator so basically if our
01:48 - age is equal to 18 we're going to do
whatever is within the subset of code
01:54 - let's place AC out statement within
these two curly brackets so we can just
01:58 - verify that the if statement actually
worked so we'll say C out then use the
02:03 - insertion operator then let's display a
message Congrats
02:08 - you are eighteen years old I'll just say
Y oh four years old
02:15 - yo all right so let's try this out and
our result is congrats you are eight
02:23 - years old so what if we changed age to a
different number like 17 well let's see
02:31 - what happens when we try this so it
doesn't appear to do anything and this
02:39 - is the reason why within our if
statement within the condition of the if
02:43 - statement
we're checking to see if age is equal to
02:45 - 18 since our age does not equal 18 it's
17 this is going to evaluate as false
02:52 - and it's going to skip over anything
within your subset of code there's other
02:57 - comparison operators they should also be
aware of 2 so this is the equals 2 of
03:01 - comparison operator it compares to see
if two values are equal if you use an
03:06 - exclamation point then an equal sign
this is the not equals comparison
03:11 - operator this will check to see if two
values are not equal if both of these
03:15 - values are not equal then this entire
condition will be true then so if we
03:20 - check to see if age does not equal 18 it
will execute whatever is within our if
03:25 - statement so a more appropriate see out
message would be something such as you
03:31 - are not 18 years old so let's try this
out and see if a message displays this
03:39 - time yeah and it says you are not 18
years old and if we were to go back and
03:47 - change our variable age to 18 and then
rerun this program well we don't get any
03:54 - result this time because we're checking
to see if our age does not equal 18
03:58 - currently it does equal 18 so this
entire condition will become or evaluate
04:04 - as false so then if this is false we
will skip whatever is within this subset
04:09 - of code for this if statement and we
continue on like it never even happened
04:13 - there's other comparison operators to
these you'll probably be a little more
04:17 - familiar with we can say things such as
greater than or less than less than or
04:24 - equal to greater than or equal to so I'm
thinking what we'll do for this will
04:30 - change our if statement to say if our
age is greater than or equal to 18 will
04:36 - display a
message Congrats you are an adult so we
04:46 - can basically change our age to anything
our age variable that is let's say that
04:50 - we are 90 years old and we're going to
check to see if our age is greater than
04:56 - or equal to 18 and it says it Congrats
you are an adult well you know we're 90
05:04 - years old so we've been an adult for a
long time but yeah you can check to see
05:09 - if like numbers are within a certain
range too and stuff and if we were to
05:13 - say our age is like perhaps 12 you know
then run this well it's gonna skip over
05:20 - this if statement because our age is
less than 18 it's not greater than or
05:25 - equal to 18 let's move on to phase 2 of
if statements so there's this thing
05:30 - called an else statement if our
condition turns out to be false
05:35 - normally we'll just skip over whatever
is within the subset of code for the if
05:39 - statement we can use an else statement
if we want our program to do something
05:43 - else so after your if statement just
type in Els e4 else and then it has its
05:49 - own block of code then so basically our
if statement is going to check to see if
05:54 - somebody is greater than or equal to 18
years old if it is or if that's true we
05:59 - will do this if not we will do something
else so let's display a different
06:04 - message let's make a see out statement
that says you are not an adult okay
06:14 - let's test this theory
so our age is currently 12 so it says
06:20 - you are not an adult and remember before
when we didn't have this else statement
06:25 - it just gift over the if statement
completely but if you have an else
06:29 - statement it's going to instead do
whatever is within the code block of the
06:34 - else statement so it's like you're at a
fork in the road and your program is
06:39 - going to decide which path it's gonna
take so I'll give you a visual example
06:43 - of this so here's a visual if this helps
you understand it I actually copied this
06:47 - from a few other lessons on the same
topic that I made in
06:50 - other programming languages so don't
tell anybody but basically it works just
06:55 - the same so we have our variable age and
when we reach our if statement if our
07:00 - age is greater than or equal to 18 we're
going to go down this path and do
07:04 - something else with our program if our
if statement is false we are going to
07:09 - use this else statement and our program
is going to take this path and display a
07:13 - different message so this is like a
visual representation if that helps you
07:18 - so with that being said I'd like to
introduce a variation of the same
07:22 - program or something similar to it now
with this if statement this condition
07:27 - will evaluate or return a answer of
being true or false so what if you had a
07:33 - boolean variable we could create a
boolean variable such as adult boolean
07:38 - adult equals and we can assign this
value of true or perhaps false and that
07:43 - instead of having a condition such as
age is greater than or equal to 18 you
07:48 - could just put the boolean variable name
within here and it's kind of like the
07:53 - same thing it's going to check to see if
this evaluates as true or false if adult
07:59 - evaluates to be true then we will
display congrats you are an adult if
08:03 - adult evaluates as false then we will do
whatever is within this else statement
08:08 - and since our boolean variable is set to
false it displays you are not an adult
08:13 - but then if we were to set this to true
then it's going to perform whatever is
08:19 - within the if statement then where it
says congrats you are an adult so that's
08:25 - an alternative way to write something
within an if statement because basically
08:29 - it's going to return a result of being
true or false and if you are just to
08:35 - stick a boolean variable in here you can
check to see if this variable contains
08:39 - the value of true or false
let's move on to phase three on this
08:45 - topic of if statements and we're going
to cover the else if statement so I
08:49 - think this is best if we were to create
a entirely new program so what I think
08:55 - we'll do is that we will prompt the user
to enter an eight temperature and if the
09:00 - temperature falls within a certain range
we will display a
09:04 - message depending on what the user typed
in for a temperature so to begin let's
09:09 - create a variable perhaps an int called
temperature and we can just declare this
09:17 - we don't need to necessarily assign it a
value right away and let's create a
09:21 - prompt to ask for a temperature and we
will say please enter the temperature
09:29 - perhaps we'll put this in Celsius then
we need to place AC in statement after
09:37 - this we will say temperature all right
so this will prompt for a temperature
09:45 - and depending on what the value of
temperature is we will display a
09:50 - particular message so let's write an if
statement if I'm just gonna copy
09:55 - temperature because it's not that fun to
type this out if temperature is greater
10:00 - than perhaps thirty degrees Celsius we
will display a message so we'll say C
10:06 - out it is hot outside maybe I'll add an
emoji here it's not required but I think
10:16 - it's silly it's a dude sweating alright
so if our temperature is greater than
10:21 - thirty we will display a message it is
hot outside so what if we want to check
10:27 - something else too before actually using
an else statement well we can use an
10:32 - else if statement it's kind of like if
our if statement turns out to be false
10:38 - we can check one more thing or a few
more things before we result to the else
10:42 - statement so let me give you an example
let's check to see if our temperature is
10:49 - less than zero so I think that's the
freezing point in Celsius let's display
10:56 - a message that says C out it is cold
outside
11:05 - BRR and then let's have an else
statement actually no what I think I'm
11:13 - gonna change this to greater than or
equal to 30 and
11:17 - than or equal to zero all right so let's
add an else statement so basically if
11:24 - our temperature is not greater than 30
greater than or equal to 30 and our
11:30 - temperature is not less than or equal to
zero it's going to fall within a certain
11:35 - range of 1 to 29 degrees Celsius so
anything that falls within that range we
11:42 - could say it is perhaps warm outside it
is warm outside ok let's test out this
11:51 - program ok please enter the temperature
it is 50 degrees Celsius outside it is
12:02 - hot outside let's try a different answer
please enter the temperature
12:08 - perhaps negative 20 degrees Celsius it
is cold outside now if our temperature
12:15 - falls within a certain range that's
basically how we set this up it's going
12:19 - to just rely on the else statement
because it's checking one if statement
12:23 - after another first it checks to see if
our temperature is greater than or equal
12:28 - to 30 and if it's false we're going to
use the elsif statement and it's going
12:32 - to check to see if our temperature is
less than or equal to zero if that's
12:37 - also false then we resort to the else
statement and that's kind of like a last
12:42 - resort so if it's not hot outside and
it's not cold outside then it must be
12:46 - warm outside so let's try this one last
time just to verify if that's true so
12:52 - please enter the temperature perhaps 25
degrees Celsius it is warm outside well
13:00 - that's the fundamentals of if statements
it's a basic form of decision-making we
13:05 - can check to see if some condition that
we specify is true then we can have our
13:10 - program do something if it's false we
can have our program do nothing or
13:14 - something else entirely all include
copies of the programs that we made in
13:19 - this video and I'll post it as a comment
down below and pin it to the top but
13:23 - yeah that is everything you need to know
to get started using if statements in
13:28 - C++
hey you if you and
13:31 - this lesson then you can help me help
you in three easy steps
13:36 - by smashing that like button drop a

13:40 - you'd like to become a fellow bro
