00:00 - oh yeah all right everybody
00:03 - for each loops a for each loop is a
00:06 - simpler and more elegant way
00:08 - to iterate over an array however it's
00:11 - less flexible compared to a standard for
00:13 - loop
00:14 - i have an array of names of vehicles
00:16 - named cars we have a bmw
00:18 - mustang and corvette then we can use a
00:21 - standard for loop to iterate and display
00:23 - the elements of this array so this works
00:26 - fine
00:27 - however it's a lot of work to write all
00:28 - of this another approach
00:30 - although it's less flexible is to create
00:32 - a for each loop
00:34 - this will iterate once for each element
00:36 - within my array
00:37 - so type for each parenthesis curly
00:39 - braces
00:40 - and within the parenthesis we list the
00:42 - data type of each element
00:44 - then we need a name for each element
00:46 - that we're working with
00:47 - since we're working with cars let's call
00:49 - each element a car
00:51 - string car in the name of the array
00:54 - cars string car in cars then i will with
00:58 - the right line statement
00:59 - display whatever car is so this is kind
01:02 - of like a nickname for the element that
01:04 - we're currently working with
01:05 - so let's get rid of this for loop
01:07 - because we don't need it anymore
01:09 - and use our for each loop instead
01:13 - and this works the same as before one
01:16 - downside with a for each loop is that
01:18 - it's not flexible with a standard for
01:20 - loop we can iterate forwards
01:22 - backwards or even skip iterations so use
01:25 - whatever loop is more appropriate for
01:27 - your situation
01:28 - well everybody that is a for each loop
01:31 - it's a simpler and more elegant way to
01:34 - iterate over an array
01:35 - however it's not as flexible if you just
01:37 - need something simple to display the
01:39 - elements of an array you can easily use
01:41 - a for each loop
01:42 - alright everybody so that's a for each
01:44 - loop if you can give this video a thumbs
01:46 - up drop a random comment down below
01:48 - and well those are four each loops in c
01:50 - sharp

oh yeah all right everybody for each loops a for each loop is a simpler and more elegant way to iterate over an array however it's less flexible compared to a standard for loop i have an array of names of vehicles named cars we have a bmw mustang and corvette then we can use a standard for loop to iterate and display the elements of this array so this works fine however it's a lot of work to write all of this another approach although it's less flexible is to create a for each loop this will iterate once for each element within my array so type for each parenthesis curly braces and within the parenthesis we list the data type of each element then we need a name for each element that we're working with since we're working with cars let's call each element a car string car in the name of the array cars string car in cars then i will with the right line statement display whatever car is so this is kind of like a nickname for the element that we're currently working with so let's get rid of this for loop because we don't need it anymore and use our for each loop instead and this works the same as before one downside with a for each loop is that it's not flexible with a standard for loop we can iterate forwards backwards or even skip iterations so use whatever loop is more appropriate for your situation well everybody that is a for each loop it's a simpler and more elegant way to iterate over an array however it's not as flexible if you just need something simple to display the elements of an array you can easily use a for each loop alright everybody so that's a for each loop if you can give this video a thumbs up drop a random comment down below and well those are four each loops in c sharp
