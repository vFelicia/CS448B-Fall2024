00:00 - how's it going everybody it's bro hope
00:02 - you're doing well and in this video i'm
00:03 - going to explain
00:04 - 2d lists in python so sit back relax
00:08 - and enjoy the show
00:11 - if you wouldn't mind please like comment
00:14 - and subscribe
00:15 - one like equals one prayer for the
00:17 - youtube algorithm
00:19 - i have a super quick video for you all
00:21 - today on
00:22 - 2d lists also referred to as
00:24 - multi-dimensional lists
00:26 - all it is is a list of separate lists
00:29 - so let's begin by creating a few
00:31 - separate lists let's say we have a list
00:33 - called drinks and let's assign a few
00:36 - values
00:37 - let's say we have coffee as well
00:41 - as soda and maybe some tea
00:44 - all right so we currently have one list
00:46 - let's make maybe two more let's make a
00:48 - list called
00:49 - dinner and maybe in here we'll place
00:53 - pizza then hamburger
00:59 - and hot dog okay
01:02 - then let's create one more for this
01:04 - example let's say dessert
01:08 - and maybe we'll add two items
01:11 - they all don't need the same amount of
01:13 - items or elements so we have cake
01:15 - and ice cream
01:18 - all right so we have three lists one
01:21 - called drinks
01:22 - dinner and dessert so what we can do is
01:25 - add
01:25 - all of these lists to one list
01:28 - and let's create a list called food food
01:31 - equals and for each of these elements
01:33 - we're going to place
01:34 - our lists so we have drinks dinner
01:38 - and dessert check this out what if i
01:41 - were to
01:42 - print my 2d list of food
01:45 - so what ends up happening is that this
01:47 - will print all of the elements
01:49 - found within each individual list and
01:52 - they are all grouped together
01:53 - so this first portion is my drinks list
01:57 - which contains coffee soda tea this next
02:00 - element
02:01 - is my dinner list which contains pizza
02:03 - hamburger hot dog
02:05 - and the last element dessert contains
02:07 - cake
02:08 - and ice cream if i need to access just
02:11 - one of these lists
02:12 - i will add an index after my
02:15 - food 2d list and set an index number
02:19 - so index 0 is referring to my first
02:22 - list of drinks and this will display all
02:24 - of the elements found within my first
02:26 - list
02:27 - and if i need just one of these elements
02:30 - i will add
02:31 - a second set of square brackets and list
02:34 - the index of the item that i'm trying to
02:36 - access
02:37 - so this very first item coffee would be
02:40 - index zero and then index zero again so
02:43 - we need
02:43 - two sets of square brackets and if i
02:45 - were to print this
02:46 - this will display coffee so if i go down
02:49 - the list
02:50 - the next element would be soda
02:53 - and then t if i were to change the index
02:56 - within
02:56 - this first set of square brackets well
02:59 - now we're working with
03:00 - a different list this time we're working
03:02 - with our dinner list
03:04 - so the element at index 1
03:07 - index 2 that would be our dinner list
03:10 - and this will display the element of hot
03:13 - dog
03:13 - if i change this to the next list which
03:15 - would be dessert
03:17 - well we're going to receive an index out
03:19 - of range error because
03:20 - we only have two values within this list
03:24 - cake and ice cream there is no element
03:27 - at index 2 because we only added
03:30 - two elements to this list of dessert
03:33 - all right everybody so that is 2d lists
03:36 - also referred to as
03:38 - multi-dimensional lists it's a list of
03:41 - separate lists if you need to access
03:43 - one of the elements within your 2d list
03:46 - you need
03:46 - two sets of square brackets so if you'd
03:49 - like a copy of this code
03:50 - i will post this in the comments down
03:52 - below but yeah that's how
03:54 - 2d lists work in python
03:57 - hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you
03:59 - learned something new
04:00 - then help me help you in three easy
04:03 - steps
04:03 - by smashing that like button drop a
04:05 - comment down below
04:07 - and subscribe if you'd like to become a
04:08 - fellow bro
