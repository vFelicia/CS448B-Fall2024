00:01 - okay guys we are talking about the
00:04 - ternary operator which is represented by
00:06 - a question mark followed by a colon it's
00:09 - a replacement to using an if else
00:11 - statement you write a condition then add
00:13 - a question mark kind of like you're
00:15 - asking a question
00:17 - is something true if that condition is
00:19 - true we can do some code if it's false
00:22 - we do some other code here's an example
00:24 - we have a grade my grade is 75. if grade
00:27 - is greater than or equal to 60 i'll
00:30 - output you pass
00:32 - else will output you fail my grade is 75
00:36 - therefore i pass another way of writing
00:39 - this is to use the ternary operator
00:41 - first we write a condition so let's get
00:44 - rid of this if statement
00:46 - after our condition we'll add a question
00:48 - mark now parentheses are optional then
00:51 - we write some expression
00:56 - standard output you pass
00:58 - we do this if our condition is true
01:00 - colon what will we do if that condition
01:03 - is false
01:04 - well let's use whatever's within our
01:06 - else statement
01:08 - and this would work the same if my grade
01:11 - is 75
01:15 - you pass
01:17 - if it's 50
01:21 - you fail
01:23 - let's come up with a few other examples
01:26 - let's check to see if a number is even
01:28 - or odd
01:30 - int number equals
01:33 - what about nine
01:34 - we write a condition
01:36 - we'll check if number
01:38 - modulus 2. remember modulus gives you
01:41 - the remainder of any division does
01:43 - number divide by 2 evenly so this
01:46 - returns a 1 or a 0. if number modulus 2
01:51 - is equal to
01:52 - 1 question mark then let's display
01:59 - odd
02:01 - if it's false we'll display standard
02:04 - output
02:06 - even
02:09 - okay odd let's change number to eight
02:15 - now it's even you don't necessarily need
02:17 - equals one or equal zero
02:20 - the number one does correspond to true
02:22 - and zero corresponds to false so you
02:24 - could write it like this too eight
02:26 - divides by two evenly that's even
02:29 - if it's nine
02:31 - that is odd okay last example
02:35 - let's examine a boolean variable bull
02:38 - how about hungry is somebody hungry
02:42 - i'll set this to be true
02:44 - let's write our condition
02:47 - hungry
02:49 - equals true question mark now if you're
02:52 - examining to see if a boolean variable
02:55 - is true you don't necessarily need
02:57 - equals true you can just say that
02:59 - boolean variable hungry question mark
03:01 - like you're asking a question so if
03:03 - hungry is true
03:05 - we will do this
03:07 - standard
03:08 - output
03:10 - you are hungry
03:13 - colon what will we do if it's false
03:16 - standard
03:17 - output
03:19 - you
03:20 - are
03:21 - full
03:24 - hungry is set to true
03:27 - you are hungry if it were false
03:32 - you are full if we're displaying output
03:34 - there's a couple different ways in which
03:36 - we could write this it's up to you how
03:37 - you want to handle it
03:39 - so another way of writing the same code
03:41 - would be
03:42 - standard
03:44 - output
03:46 - then within a set of parentheses then we
03:48 - could use our ternary operator
03:51 - hungry question mark
03:55 - you are hungry
03:58 - else you are
04:01 - full
04:03 - this would work as well let's just check
04:05 - that hungry is set to false
04:08 - you are full
04:09 - let's set it to true
04:13 - you are hungry so yeah that's the
04:15 - ternary operator everybody it's a
04:18 - question mark followed by a colon you
04:20 - write a condition as if you're asking a
04:22 - question if that condition is true
04:24 - you do some expression if not you do
04:27 - some other expression it's a replacement
04:29 - to an if else statement your assignment
04:32 - is to post a use of the trinary operator
04:34 - in the comment section and well yeah
04:36 - that's the ternary operator in c plus

okay guys we are talking about the ternary operator which is represented by a question mark followed by a colon it's a replacement to using an if else statement you write a condition then add a question mark kind of like you're asking a question is something true if that condition is true we can do some code if it's false we do some other code here's an example we have a grade my grade is 75. if grade is greater than or equal to 60 i'll output you pass else will output you fail my grade is 75 therefore i pass another way of writing this is to use the ternary operator first we write a condition so let's get rid of this if statement after our condition we'll add a question mark now parentheses are optional then we write some expression standard output you pass we do this if our condition is true colon what will we do if that condition is false well let's use whatever's within our else statement and this would work the same if my grade is 75 you pass if it's 50 you fail let's come up with a few other examples let's check to see if a number is even or odd int number equals what about nine we write a condition we'll check if number modulus 2. remember modulus gives you the remainder of any division does number divide by 2 evenly so this returns a 1 or a 0. if number modulus 2 is equal to 1 question mark then let's display odd if it's false we'll display standard output even okay odd let's change number to eight now it's even you don't necessarily need equals one or equal zero the number one does correspond to true and zero corresponds to false so you could write it like this too eight divides by two evenly that's even if it's nine that is odd okay last example let's examine a boolean variable bull how about hungry is somebody hungry i'll set this to be true let's write our condition hungry equals true question mark now if you're examining to see if a boolean variable is true you don't necessarily need equals true you can just say that boolean variable hungry question mark like you're asking a question so if hungry is true we will do this standard output you are hungry colon what will we do if it's false standard output you are full hungry is set to true you are hungry if it were false you are full if we're displaying output there's a couple different ways in which we could write this it's up to you how you want to handle it so another way of writing the same code would be standard output then within a set of parentheses then we could use our ternary operator hungry question mark you are hungry else you are full this would work as well let's just check that hungry is set to false you are full let's set it to true you are hungry so yeah that's the ternary operator everybody it's a question mark followed by a colon you write a condition as if you're asking a question if that condition is true you do some expression if not you do some other expression it's a replacement to an if else statement your assignment is to post a use of the trinary operator in the comment section and well yeah that's the ternary operator in c plus
