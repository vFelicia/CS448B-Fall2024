00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's you
bro hope you're doing well and in this
00:03 - video i'm going to explain how we can
install
00:08 - and set up java fx for eclipse so
sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:25 - if you wouldn't mind please like comment
and subscribe
00:29 - one like equals one prayer for the
youtube algorithm
00:47 - all right people so i have listed seven
steps which we need to follow in order
00:51 - to get
java fx up and running so i'll include
00:55 - these steps in the description down
below as well as any relevant links so
00:59 - be sure to look in the description
all right people step one is to download
01:03 - the java fx
sdk you can just google this java fx
01:08 - then go to the first link
this is the url open jfx dot io
01:14 - so on this webpage scroll down to
getting started
01:17 - then go to visit and then select the
correct
01:21 - java fx version for your ide
in this video we're covering eclipse but
01:26 - we'll cover intellij idea next
so java fx and eclipse then go to
01:31 - non modular from ide and click
this link javafx sdk this should bring
01:37 - you to another web page
gluonhq.com products javafx
01:44 - scroll down to latest release and select
the correct sdk for your operating
01:49 - system i'm running windows so i'm going
to select
01:52 - java fx windows x64 sdk
and click download now you should have
01:59 - a zip file so what i'm going to do is
extract this by right clicking on this
02:04 - file
then go to extract all and you'll want
02:07 - to extract this to a location that
you'll remember
02:10 - i'm just going to keep this my downloads
folder and
02:13 - click extract then give it a minute
well my file is now extracted so
02:18 - remember the location of where you
extracted this file to
02:22 - because that's going to be important
later step two is to install the
02:26 - javafx plugin and we can do so by going
to
02:29 - help eclipse marketplace
we are going to find f x
02:37 - go and we are looking for
e f x clips click install
02:46 - read the license agreement yes i
actually did read it that fast
02:49 - i accept the terms of the license
agreements and finish
02:54 - you may need to restart eclipse so
that's unfortunate
02:57 - step three let's create a new java fx
project
03:01 - let's go to file new project
javafx javafx project
03:09 - next we need a name for this project
i will call this hello fx but call it
03:15 - whatever you want
and then finish within my package
03:19 - explorer i now have
a javafx project which i called hellofx
03:24 - if i were to open this within my source
folder
03:28 - and within the application package i
have two files
03:32 - a java file called main as well as a css
file called application for some css
03:38 - styling
this main java file has some pre-written
03:41 - code to create a
basic window for us however we first
03:46 - need to create and set a user library
that contains the executable jars that
03:51 - we downloaded from that sdk
you can see that if we try and run this
03:54 - currently we have all of these warnings
if i were to attempt to run this we're
03:59 - going to run into an
issue error occurred during
04:02 - initialization of boot layer
module javafx controls not found
04:07 - to resolve this issue we need to create
and set
04:11 - a user library step 4 is to create a
user library
04:15 - let's go to window preferences
then under java go to build path
04:23 - user libraries
let's pretend that this wasn't here so
04:27 - let's remove that go to
new we need a user library name let's
04:33 - call this
java fx select ok
04:37 - add external jars what we're doing now
is looking
04:41 - for that sdk that we extracted so
remember that location of where you
04:46 - extracted
those files to for me that's under
04:49 - downloads
here it is then go to javafx sdk
04:55 - then under the library folder i'm going
to
04:58 - select all of these executable jar files
open apply and close
05:05 - step five is to set the library
right click on your javafx project
05:11 - folder
then go to build path add libraries
05:17 - user library next select
java fx finish
05:23 - and you did everything right all of
those red warnings should go away
05:27 - step six let's configure the build path
right click on your project folder
05:31 - go to build path configure build path
all we're doing is making sure that we
05:36 - have
java fx under class path if you're
05:40 - missing this for some reason
let's say we remove this well we can add
05:44 - that back
by going to class path add library user
05:48 - library
next check java fx finish
05:52 - so you'll just want to be sure that you
have javafx underneath classpath if you
05:57 - already have it there's nothing more
that you need to do
05:59 - apply then apply and close step seven is
to add
06:02 - virtual machine arguments we need to
copy a line of text
06:06 - from that webpage where we downloaded
the java sdk
06:10 - so this is the url under java fx and
eclipse
06:14 - under the subcategory of non-modular
from ide
06:18 - scroll down to the section regarding
adding vm
06:21 - arguments there are two lines of text
one if you're using
06:25 - linux or mac copy this line of text
if you're using windows copy this other
06:30 - line of text
i'm running windows so i'm going to copy
06:33 - this line of text
i'll also include these in the
06:36 - description down below for this video so
you don't have to navigate to this
06:39 - webpage
since i'm a nice guy so once you copy
06:41 - this line of text
let's head back to our ide now to add a
06:46 - virtual machine argument
right click on your project folder then
06:50 - go to
run as run configurations
06:54 - make sure that your project is selected
if not you can select it on the left
06:58 - hand menu here
under the arguments tab go to vm
07:02 - arguments
and paste all of that text that you
07:05 - copied but there's going to be
one change that we need to make to this
07:09 - we need to change
the path to the library folder of the
07:13 - sdk
that we downloaded so we'll need to find
07:16 - that locate where you extracted
that java sdk folder to
07:21 - locate the library folder and then i am
going to
07:25 - get this file path i'm going to right
click
07:28 - then copy address everything within the
quotes i'm going to delete
07:34 - and paste the location of where that
library folder is
07:39 - apply and run if everything checks out
after running this program you should
07:44 - have a small window that appears
this will serve as the foundation for
07:49 - our java fx
gui applications alright everybody
07:52 - that's the basics of installing and
setting up
07:55 - javafx for eclipse i do plan on a
separate video on doing the same thing
08:00 - for intellij idea if you would like a
copy of all these steps
08:04 - and the appropriate links i will include
those in the description down below
08:08 - but yeah that's how to install and set
up java fx
08:12 - for eclipse hey 
08:46 - you yeah i'm talking to
you
09:03 - if you learned something new 
09:56 - then help
me help you in three easy steps
10:24 - by smashing that 
12:30 - like button drop a
comment down below
