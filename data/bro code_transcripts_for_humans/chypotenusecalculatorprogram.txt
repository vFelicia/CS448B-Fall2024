00:02 - all right welcome back everybody in this
00:04 - video we're going to write a small
00:05 - practice program to find the hypotenuse
00:07 - of a right triangle we'll need the help
00:09 - of our math.h header file because we'll
00:12 - need access to some useful math
00:13 - functions more specifically the square
00:16 - root function let's declare all of the
00:18 - variables that we'll need we'll need
00:20 - sides a b and c and these will be of the
00:22 - double data type a
00:24 - b
00:25 - c
00:26 - we'll ask the user to enter in sides a
00:29 - and b
00:30 - print f
00:32 - enter
00:33 - side
00:35 - a and then we will use scanf
00:38 - so the format specifier for a double
00:42 - is l f then i would like to insert a
00:45 - value within a so i need to use the
00:48 - address of operator then our variable a
00:51 - okay let's do the same thing for side b
00:54 - enter side b and store the user input
00:57 - within variable b the formula to find
01:00 - the hypotenuse of a right triangle is
01:03 - the square root of a squared plus b
01:05 - squared
01:06 - so we will set c equal to the square
01:09 - root function
01:10 - and within the parentheses
01:12 - we will say a times a
01:15 - plus b times b
01:19 - and then we will display c
01:24 - side
01:25 - c and the format specifier for a double
01:28 - is l f and we are displaying c and well
01:32 - let's try it
01:34 - so side a let's say is three side b is
01:37 - four
01:38 - that means side c is five so yeah i
01:42 - thought that would be a good practice
01:43 - program for us to get used to accepting
01:45 - user input if this video helped you out
