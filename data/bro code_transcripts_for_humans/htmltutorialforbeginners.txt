01:01 - whoever's watching this video
01:03 - learn html it's super easy what do you
01:05 - have to lose
01:06 - building a website is a lot like
01:08 - building a house first we need a solid
01:10 - foundation and we need to build
01:12 - a skeletal structure that's where html
01:14 - comes in it's the most
01:15 - basic building block of the web then
01:17 - after that we can add
01:18 - css css is cascading style sheets with
01:22 - css we can style color and change the
01:25 - appearance of a webpage
01:26 - and lastly there's javascript javascript
01:28 - adds functionality to a webpage so in a
01:31 - house
01:31 - this could be like plumbing heating and
01:34 - air conditioning and electricity so it
01:36 - adds functionality
01:37 - and when you combine these three levels
01:39 - you have a good
01:40 - functioning webpage but you need to
01:41 - start somewhere so that's why you're
01:43 - gonna learn html first what will you
01:45 - need
01:45 - you'll need a web browser use whatever
01:48 - web browser that you like
01:49 - just please do not use internet explorer
01:52 - and we'll also need a
01:53 - text editor to write html code you can
01:56 - use
01:56 - vs code sublime text heck you can even
01:59 - use notepad but i prefer vs code
02:01 - so i'll show you where to download that
02:03 - head to code.visualstudio.com
02:07 - and download the correct version for
02:09 - your operating system i'm running
02:10 - windows so i'm going to install the
02:12 - windows version
02:13 - then i will open when done except the
02:16 - agreement
02:17 - yes i actually did read it that fast i
02:19 - would recommend creating a desktop icon
02:22 - and make sure add to path
02:23 - is selected next and install
02:26 - and then you might as well launch this
02:28 - bad boy so finish
02:30 - we are now within vs code the first
02:32 - thing i recommend is to download
02:34 - the live server extension so that after
02:36 - saving an html document
02:38 - we can immediately refresh a webpage so
02:41 - underneath
02:41 - the search box for extensions we are
02:43 - looking for live
02:45 - server and install this version then
02:48 - after downloading the live server
02:50 - extension we will create a new folder
02:52 - under the explorer tab open folder
02:55 - wherever you want
02:56 - create a new folder i'll create this on
02:58 - my desktop just for convenience
03:00 - i'm going to create a new folder i'll
03:02 - name this
03:03 - website or whatever you want doesn't
03:05 - matter
03:06 - then select folder and within our
03:08 - website folder we're going to create
03:10 - a new file name this index.html
03:15 - whatever file you would like to be the
03:17 - home page of your website you'll want to
03:19 - name that
03:20 - as index.html when a connection is made
03:23 - to a website without a specific
03:25 - file in the url most servers by default
03:28 - will return the index.html file as a
03:32 - landing page
03:32 - so this index.html file will be the home
03:36 - page
03:36 - the landing page of our website at the
03:38 - top of our document we're going to type
03:40 - this within
03:41 - angle brackets exclamation point doc
03:44 - type html html documents should start
03:48 - with
03:48 - this declaration to be compliant with
03:50 - basic html standards
03:52 - it lets a visitor's web browser know
03:54 - that this is an html5
03:57 - document and following this text will
03:59 - create a pair of html tags
04:01 - tags are the keywords within angle
04:03 - brackets that a web page uses
04:05 - to define how your web browser will
04:07 - format and display content
04:09 - and usually these come in pairs so we'll
04:11 - need an opening html tag
04:13 - and a closing html tag all of our html
04:16 - code will be within
04:17 - these html tags so the html element
04:21 - represents
04:22 - the root of an html document and there's
04:24 - two major sections
04:25 - head and body so let's create a pair of
04:28 - head tags
04:29 - head represents information about a web
04:32 - page
04:32 - and there is also body as well so create
04:35 - a pair of body tags
04:37 - the body is what you would like to
04:39 - display to a user
04:40 - the head is information about the web
04:42 - page one thing that we can add to the
04:44 - head of our document
04:45 - is a title so we'll need a pair of title
04:48 - tags
04:51 - and let's create a title for our website
04:54 - my first website and then let's save
04:57 - let's open this document so i'm going to
04:59 - right click open with live server
05:02 - so the title of this web page is my
05:04 - first website
05:05 - and you may have noticed that this web
05:07 - browser was opened with
05:09 - edge so you can actually change that to
05:11 - a different web browser and here's how
05:13 - go to file preferences
05:16 - settings underneath extensions head to
05:20 - live server config custom browser
05:23 - and select a web browser of your
05:25 - choosing so right click
05:27 - open with live server and we are now
05:29 - using a different web browser
05:31 - so i'm just going to put my web browser
05:33 - and vs code
05:34 - side by side now let's add some text to
05:38 - the body of our webpage
05:40 - type whatever you want i like pizza
05:43 - then i'm going to save there we go we
05:46 - added some text
05:47 - to the body of our html document and we
05:50 - can also use a pair
05:52 - of header tags so surround some text
05:54 - with
05:55 - h1 this is the largest header tag
05:58 - and then make sure to close it
06:00 - afterwards okay so then we have h2
06:02 - which is smaller we have h3
06:07 - h4 h5
06:13 - and the last one is h6
06:16 - so if you need some sort of title for
06:18 - your web page you can always play
06:20 - some text within a pair of h1 header
06:23 - tags
06:23 - before i discuss p tags we should
06:25 - discuss what elements are
06:27 - elements embody the opening tag any
06:30 - content within
06:31 - and the closing tag so for example this
06:34 - is a
06:34 - opening title tag and a closing title
06:37 - tag
06:38 - and all of these together including any
06:40 - content within is known as
06:42 - the title element so that's the
06:44 - difference between
06:45 - tags and elements tags make up a portion
06:48 - of elements and with that out of the way
06:50 - we can move on to
06:52 - paragraph elements paragraph elements
06:54 - are made up of p tags we need an opening
06:56 - p
06:56 - tag and a closing piece egg and we can
06:58 - type some text within
07:00 - these paragraph tags this is
07:03 - some sample text browsers automatically
07:07 - add
07:07 - a blank line of before and after any
07:10 - paragraph elements
07:11 - also if you need some longer sample text
07:14 - there is a shortcut
07:15 - type lorem then tab and that will create
07:18 - some sample text for you and let's
07:20 - create another paragraph element
07:22 - so we need an opening p tag and a
07:24 - closing p
07:25 - tag i would like some more sample text i
07:27 - will type lorem
07:28 - then tab and we now have two paragraph
07:31 - elements
07:32 - if you need a paragraph of information
07:34 - to display with blank lines before and
07:36 - after
07:37 - you can always surround some text within
07:39 - a pair of p tags
07:40 - now there's also a br element and
07:44 - these do not need closing tags it's only
07:46 - an opening tag
07:47 - wherever you would like to add a line
07:48 - break just add a br element
07:52 - so let's say i would like to space out
07:53 - these header tags
07:55 - well i can add a line break between each
07:57 - of these
07:58 - if you ever need a line break just use a
08:01 - vr
08:01 - element and like i said there's no
08:03 - closing tag with these elements
08:05 - there's also an hr element and i do not
08:08 - mean human resources i mean horizontal
08:11 - rule
08:12 - if you ever need to divide your page
08:14 - section by section you can always add a
08:16 - horizontal rule let's say that we have a
08:18 - title to this webpage i'll create an h1
08:20 - header tag
08:22 - this is my website
08:25 - and then i'm just going to close this
08:26 - what if i would like to divide this
08:28 - webpage
08:28 - section by section i can always add a
08:31 - horizontal rule by using an
08:33 - hr element and there is no closing tag
08:35 - with this element you just type hr with
08:37 - an angle brackets
08:39 - and this will divide a section of your
08:41 - web page and add a horizontal rule which
08:44 - looks pretty nice
08:44 - so that is the hr element and the last
08:47 - thing we're going to discuss for this
08:49 - topic
08:49 - is comments comments will not be
08:51 - displayed within the body of your
08:53 - document
08:54 - it's more or less a note for yourself or
08:56 - other developers
08:57 - to create a comment we need an angle
08:59 - bracket exclamation point then two
09:01 - dashes
09:02 - and this will create the ending of your
09:04 - comment which is an arrow pointing to
09:06 - the right
09:06 - so anything between these two arrows
09:09 - will be a comment
09:10 - i'll leave a comment for i don't know
09:12 - myself
09:13 - this is the best website
09:17 - ever so as you can see this will not be
09:20 - displayed within my web page it's
09:22 - basically used as
09:23 - a note for yourself or for other people
09:25 - looking over this html document
