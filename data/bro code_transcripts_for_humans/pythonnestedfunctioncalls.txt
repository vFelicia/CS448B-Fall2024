00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's you
00:01 - bro hope you're doing well
00:03 - and in this video i'm going to explain
00:04 - nested function calls in python so
00:07 - sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:12 - if you find this video helpful please
00:13 - remember to like
00:15 - comment and subscribe your support will
00:17 - help keep this channel running
00:19 - all right people nested function calls
00:22 - these are function calls
00:23 - inside of other function calls and this
00:26 - is possible because
00:27 - certain functions will return a value
00:29 - and we can immediately use that value as
00:31 - an argument for the next function
00:34 - so here's an example let's say that we
00:35 - have the small program
00:37 - where we will ask a user to type in a
00:39 - whole positive number
00:41 - and let's say i don't let's say i type
00:43 - in negative 3.14
00:45 - and then i'm storing that value within a
00:48 - variable
00:48 - named num what i'm going to do is
00:50 - convert that number
00:52 - to a floating point number because
00:54 - currently it's a string when you accept
00:55 - user input
00:56 - i will find the absolute value of num
00:59 - and then round it to the nearest whole
01:01 - number
01:01 - and then print the value so we can
01:03 - actually do this using less lines of
01:05 - code with
01:06 - nested function calls so let's start
01:08 - with the first function which will be
01:10 - accepting some user input
01:11 - the input function so this will be in
01:14 - the very center
01:15 - of our nested function calls and then
01:17 - the next function we would like to apply
01:20 - to
01:20 - the variable that is returned the value
01:22 - that is returned
01:23 - we will pass in as an argument to our
01:25 - next function of casting
01:27 - this data type to a float so we'll
01:29 - surround
01:30 - our function with another function and
01:33 - use
01:33 - the float function and then we'll just
01:36 - keep on adding layers to this
01:37 - so we have the absolute value function
01:40 - next
01:40 - so we'll add another layer and we have
01:43 - the round function
01:45 - so we'll add a layer to that and
01:48 - lastly we're going to print and that'll
01:50 - be the outermost layer
01:53 - so this program will do the exact same
01:55 - thing
01:56 - let's say negative 3.14 except we've
01:59 - written this with
02:00 - one line of code so basically we start
02:03 - with the innermost function and resolve
02:05 - that first
02:06 - whatever value is returned we use as an
02:09 - argument to the next outermost function
02:11 - and in this case it would be float then
02:13 - we resolve that then move on to
02:16 - absolute value then round and then print
02:18 - so it's just another way of writing code
02:20 - that takes up less
02:21 - lines but this is more of an extreme
02:23 - example you probably won't see
02:25 - like four or five nested functions well
02:28 - everybody those are nested function
02:29 - calls
02:30 - if you would like a copy of this code i
02:32 - will post all of this to the comment
02:33 - section down below
02:34 - but yeah those are nested function calls
02:37 - in python
