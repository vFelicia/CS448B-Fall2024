00:00 - all right everybody today I'm going to
00:01 - show you how we can both sort and limit
00:03 - documents in mongodb to return all
00:06 - documents we can type DB the name of the
00:09 - collection dot then we can use the find
00:12 - method to return all documents to sort
00:15 - these documents in some sort of order
00:16 - again we would type DB the name of the
00:19 - collection students dot find method then
00:22 - we'll do some method chaining after the
00:24 - find method add dot then we will call
00:27 - the sort method
00:29 - the sort method takes a document by
00:31 - which field would we like to sort let's
00:33 - sort names in alphabetical order we
00:36 - would type the name of the field Name
00:37 - colon then one for alphabetical order or
00:41 - negative one for reverse alphabetical
00:43 - order so if we were to sort by
00:46 - alphabetical order here's the results we
00:49 - have Gary then Larry Patrick Sandy
00:52 - SpongeBob then reverse alphabetical
00:55 - order that was
01:01 - Name colon negative one now we have
01:04 - SpongeBob Sandy Patrick Larry Gary let's
01:07 - sort our documents by GPA grade point
01:10 - average
01:12 - so again we use the find method then
01:15 - we'll method chain the sort method we're
01:17 - passing in a document object with our
01:19 - criteria we will sort by GPA in
01:23 - ascending order so we will use one I'm
01:26 - going to copy this because I'm going to
01:27 - use it later
01:29 - okay now we're sorting by GPA Patrick
01:32 - has the lowest GPA 1.5 2.5 2.8 3.2 then
01:38 - 4.
01:40 - to sort our GPA by deciding order we
01:43 - would type GPA negative one
01:45 - then we have Sandy at the top with the
01:47 - gpf4 then SpongeBob with 3.2 2.8 2.5 1.5
01:54 - now we have the limit method we can
01:57 - limit the amount of documents that are
01:58 - returned to us let's type DB dot
02:01 - students dot find method dot limit
02:04 - method
02:05 - we will pass the number of documents we
02:07 - would like return to us as an argument
02:09 - if I would like one document returned to
02:11 - us I will pass in one
02:13 - currently my documents are sorted by
02:16 - object ID this would give us the first
02:18 - document of SpongeBob
02:20 - if I were to use limit 3 we would be
02:23 - returned three documents
02:25 - SpongeBob Patrick Sandy
02:28 - we can combine both the sort and the
02:30 - limit methods too
02:32 - I would like to return the student with
02:34 - the highest GPA we'll use the find
02:37 - method
02:38 - then method chain the sort method
02:40 - we are sorting by GPA
02:43 - we're going to sort in decreasing order
02:45 - so negative one followed by the limit
02:48 - method
02:50 - I would like just one document who has
02:53 - the highest GPA that would be Sandy with
02:56 - a GPA of four
02:57 - who has the lowest GPA we should sort an
03:01 - increasing order that would be one then
03:03 - limit one
03:05 - so Patrick has the lowest GPA of 1.5
03:09 - now let's work with sorting and limiting
03:11 - Encompass to sort the documents in your
03:13 - collection you can press more options
03:16 - then add some sort criteria I will sort
03:19 - by name
03:21 - colon one
03:23 - then find
03:25 - so we have Gary Larry Patrick Sandy
03:27 - SpongeBob
03:29 - then negative one for reverse
03:31 - alphabetical order
03:33 - SpongeBob Sandy Patrick Larry Gary
03:36 - let's sort by GPA
03:39 - GPA negative one that would give us
03:42 - decreasing order so Sandy's at the top
03:46 - to limit the amount of documents that
03:47 - are returned you can enter in a number
03:49 - for the limit box I will limit the
03:51 - records to one so we are returned with
03:53 - Sandy she has the highest GPA limit
03:56 - three would give us the top three
03:57 - students or leave limit MTU to return
04:00 - all documents all right everybody so
04:02 - that is basic sorting and limiting in
04:05 - mongodb

Cleaned transcript:

all right everybody today I'm going to show you how we can both sort and limit documents in mongodb to return all documents we can type DB the name of the collection dot then we can use the find method to return all documents to sort these documents in some sort of order again we would type DB the name of the collection students dot find method then we'll do some method chaining after the find method add dot then we will call the sort method the sort method takes a document by which field would we like to sort let's sort names in alphabetical order we would type the name of the field Name colon then one for alphabetical order or negative one for reverse alphabetical order so if we were to sort by alphabetical order here's the results we have Gary then Larry Patrick Sandy SpongeBob then reverse alphabetical order that was Name colon negative one now we have SpongeBob Sandy Patrick Larry Gary let's sort our documents by GPA grade point average so again we use the find method then we'll method chain the sort method we're passing in a document object with our criteria we will sort by GPA in ascending order so we will use one I'm going to copy this because I'm going to use it later okay now we're sorting by GPA Patrick has the lowest GPA 1.5 2.5 2.8 3.2 then 4. to sort our GPA by deciding order we would type GPA negative one then we have Sandy at the top with the gpf4 then SpongeBob with 3.2 2.8 2.5 1.5 now we have the limit method we can limit the amount of documents that are returned to us let's type DB dot students dot find method dot limit method we will pass the number of documents we would like return to us as an argument if I would like one document returned to us I will pass in one currently my documents are sorted by object ID this would give us the first document of SpongeBob if I were to use limit 3 we would be returned three documents SpongeBob Patrick Sandy we can combine both the sort and the limit methods too I would like to return the student with the highest GPA we'll use the find method then method chain the sort method we are sorting by GPA we're going to sort in decreasing order so negative one followed by the limit method I would like just one document who has the highest GPA that would be Sandy with a GPA of four who has the lowest GPA we should sort an increasing order that would be one then limit one so Patrick has the lowest GPA of 1.5 now let's work with sorting and limiting Encompass to sort the documents in your collection you can press more options then add some sort criteria I will sort by name colon one then find so we have Gary Larry Patrick Sandy SpongeBob then negative one for reverse alphabetical order SpongeBob Sandy Patrick Larry Gary let's sort by GPA GPA negative one that would give us decreasing order so Sandy's at the top to limit the amount of documents that are returned you can enter in a number for the limit box I will limit the records to one so we are returned with Sandy she has the highest GPA limit three would give us the top three students or leave limit MTU to return all documents all right everybody so that is basic sorting and limiting in mongodb
