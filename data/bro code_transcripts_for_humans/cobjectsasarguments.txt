00:02 - hey what's going on people
00:03 - in this video i'm going to show you all
00:04 - how we can pass an object as an argument
00:07 - so here's the rundown i have a class car
00:09 - cars have two fields
00:11 - a model and a color and a constructor to
00:13 - assign
00:14 - a model and color argument that we
00:16 - receive i have one car object
00:18 - car car one equals new car the model of
00:21 - this car is a mustang and the color is
00:23 - red
00:24 - so i'm going to create a method that
00:25 - will change the color of my car
00:28 - but i have to pass in a car object so
00:30 - let's create a method to handle that for
00:32 - us
00:33 - public static void it's not returning
00:37 - anything and let's call this method
00:38 - change color and we'll need two
00:42 - parameters
00:43 - a car that we would like to change the
00:44 - color of so the data type is going to be
00:47 - car as well as a name for this parameter
00:50 - let's name whatever car object that we
00:52 - receive as just
00:53 - simply car and we need a color as well
00:55 - that would be a string
00:56 - string color then to change the color of
01:00 - this car
01:01 - i would type car dot color
01:04 - equals whatever color that we receive
01:07 - and that's it
01:08 - so now when we invoke this method we
01:10 - have to pass in a car object as well as
01:12 - a color
01:14 - so that would be change color and the
01:17 - car object that i will pass in as an
01:19 - argument
01:19 - is car 1 the name of the object as well
01:22 - as a new color let's color this car
01:24 - silver
01:25 - and then let's display our cars color
01:28 - and
01:29 - model console.writeline
01:32 - car one dot color
01:36 - plus all out of space plus car one
01:40 - dot model and this should change the
01:42 - color of our car
01:43 - to a silver mustang so to pass an object
01:48 - as an argument
01:48 - you need to make sure that you have the
01:50 - right parameter set up you type
01:51 - the data type of this object followed by
01:54 - a name for this parameter
01:56 - then when you invoke this method you
01:57 - have to pass in the name of the object
01:59 - let's try something a little bit
02:00 - different let's create a method to
02:03 - copy an object so let's get rid of this
02:05 - change color method but we'll keep our
02:07 - car object
02:09 - so we'll create a method to return a
02:12 - car object so public
02:15 - static instead of void the data type
02:18 - is the type that we're returning we're
02:21 - returning a car
02:22 - object so replace void with car
02:25 - then we need a name for this method
02:27 - let's call this copy
02:28 - so we will pass in a car object the data
02:31 - type
02:32 - is car and i will name this argument
02:34 - that we receive
02:35 - as car now one thing that we can do to
02:38 - copy a car object is return a
02:41 - new car and then we'll need to pass in
02:46 - a model and a color so the model
02:49 - of this car is car dot model and the
02:52 - color
02:53 - is car dot color
02:56 - now if i would like to copy car 1 and
02:59 - create a second car
03:00 - a copy of it i can type car car 2
03:04 - equals copy and then i will pass
03:07 - this object as an argument and then
03:10 - let's display the fields
03:11 - of car 2 and i bet it's a red mustang
03:15 - oh yeah there we go so we successfully
03:17 - created a copy of car 1
03:20 - by returning a car object so yeah that's
03:23 - how to pass
03:24 - objects as arguments you just have to
03:25 - list the data type of the object
03:28 - since we're working with cars we had to
03:29 - set up a car parameter
03:31 - then if you would like to return an
03:33 - object instead of void you would replace
03:35 - void with the data type of the object
03:37 - you would like to return
03:39 - and if you would like to return a new
03:41 - object like what we did with this copy
03:43 - method
03:44 - you would return a new and then call the
03:47 - constructor of whatever object you would
03:49 - like to create and return
03:50 - so that's why we called the car
03:52 - constructor and then we returned that
03:55 - new car
03:55 - back to this spot here so it's kind of
03:57 - like we replaced this method with
04:00 - calling the car constructor something
04:02 - like that
04:03 - so yeah that's how to pass objects as
04:06 - arguments
04:06 - as well as return objects from methods
04:09 - too so yeah if this video helped you out

hey what's going on people in this video i'm going to show you all how we can pass an object as an argument so here's the rundown i have a class car cars have two fields a model and a color and a constructor to assign a model and color argument that we receive i have one car object car car one equals new car the model of this car is a mustang and the color is red so i'm going to create a method that will change the color of my car but i have to pass in a car object so let's create a method to handle that for us public static void it's not returning anything and let's call this method change color and we'll need two parameters a car that we would like to change the color of so the data type is going to be car as well as a name for this parameter let's name whatever car object that we receive as just simply car and we need a color as well that would be a string string color then to change the color of this car i would type car dot color equals whatever color that we receive and that's it so now when we invoke this method we have to pass in a car object as well as a color so that would be change color and the car object that i will pass in as an argument is car 1 the name of the object as well as a new color let's color this car silver and then let's display our cars color and model console.writeline car one dot color plus all out of space plus car one dot model and this should change the color of our car to a silver mustang so to pass an object as an argument you need to make sure that you have the right parameter set up you type the data type of this object followed by a name for this parameter then when you invoke this method you have to pass in the name of the object let's try something a little bit different let's create a method to copy an object so let's get rid of this change color method but we'll keep our car object so we'll create a method to return a car object so public static instead of void the data type is the type that we're returning we're returning a car object so replace void with car then we need a name for this method let's call this copy so we will pass in a car object the data type is car and i will name this argument that we receive as car now one thing that we can do to copy a car object is return a new car and then we'll need to pass in a model and a color so the model of this car is car dot model and the color is car dot color now if i would like to copy car 1 and create a second car a copy of it i can type car car 2 equals copy and then i will pass this object as an argument and then let's display the fields of car 2 and i bet it's a red mustang oh yeah there we go so we successfully created a copy of car 1 by returning a car object so yeah that's how to pass objects as arguments you just have to list the data type of the object since we're working with cars we had to set up a car parameter then if you would like to return an object instead of void you would replace void with the data type of the object you would like to return and if you would like to return a new object like what we did with this copy method you would return a new and then call the constructor of whatever object you would like to create and return so that's why we called the car constructor and then we returned that new car back to this spot here so it's kind of like we replaced this method with calling the car constructor something like that so yeah that's how to pass objects as arguments as well as return objects from methods too so yeah if this video helped you out feel free to help me out by smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
