00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's you
00:01 - bro here hope you're doing well and in
00:02 - this video i'm going to teach you guys
00:04 - how we can create a text area in python
00:06 - so sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:11 - if you find this video helpful please
00:12 - remember to like
00:14 - comment and subscribe your support will
00:16 - help keep this channel running
00:18 - all right my fellow bros let's discuss
00:20 - the text
00:21 - widget this functions like a text area
00:24 - you can enter multiple lines of text i'm
00:27 - not sure why it's called a
00:28 - text widget instead of a text area
00:31 - widget text area would make more sense
00:33 - but idk though so let's begin by
00:36 - creating a window
00:37 - window equals tk followed by window.main
00:41 - loop so to create a
00:44 - text widget also known as a text area
00:48 - let's call this text text equals text
00:51 - and we're going to add this text to our
00:53 - window and then we need to
00:55 - pack this text text dot pack
00:59 - so we should have a text area
01:02 - and you can enter in
01:06 - stuff like this
01:10 - all right but what good is a text area
01:13 - if you can't actually submit
01:14 - some text so let's create a button to do
01:17 - that for us
01:18 - so button equals button
01:21 - we're going to add this button to the
01:23 - window
01:25 - and button.pack
01:29 - so we need a command for this button
01:32 - and a function as well so let's create a
01:35 - function called
01:36 - submit it's going to be a submit button
01:38 - and let's change the text too because we
01:41 - can
01:42 - text equals submit
01:47 - cool now let's create a function called
01:50 - submit
01:50 - and we'll do this at the top d e f
01:53 - submit
01:55 - and what is this going to do well it's
01:58 - going to
01:58 - get the text from the text area and
02:02 - let's assign this to a variable and we
02:04 - can call this maybe input or
02:05 - whatever you want so to get the text
02:09 - from the text area
02:11 - let's say text that's the name of this
02:13 - text area
02:15 - dot get but we need a starting index as
02:19 - well as an
02:20 - ending index so we're going to place 1.0
02:24 - here
02:24 - for the beginning index this is the
02:26 - first line
02:27 - we want to get everything so for the
02:29 - second index we can just put
02:31 - end then we can do anything we want with
02:34 - this input so let's just print
02:36 - this to the console window so print
02:39 - input and this should work
02:46 - hey you drink plenty
02:49 - of water love you
02:52 - and click submit and then you can do
02:55 - whatever you want with this input
02:57 - well that's how a text area functions
02:59 - but now let's customize the appearance
03:01 - of this text area and i have a few ideas
03:03 - that you might be interested in
03:05 - so let's change the background color of
03:07 - this text area
03:09 - so bg equals and i will pick
03:12 - light yellow and you will see why in
03:14 - just a second
03:16 - so now this text area kind of resembles
03:18 - maybe a piece of paper
03:20 - a notebook a post-it note however
03:23 - this font is really small so let's
03:26 - change the font
03:28 - styling and the font size so
03:32 - font equals and i will pick the font
03:35 - ink free this somewhat resembles
03:38 - handwriting so i kind of like this
03:40 - and it kind of fits our notebook theme
03:43 - and then a size maybe 25.
03:45 - one thing you should know the text area
03:48 - size corresponds directly
03:50 - with the font size so 25 is a fairly
03:54 - large font so if we were to compile this
03:57 - and run this the size of our text area
04:00 - is now
04:01 - massive because it corresponds directly
04:04 - with the font size
04:05 - so we might want to limit the width and
04:07 - the height
04:08 - so the height is the amount of
04:11 - characters
04:12 - that this is tall so let's say 8 and the
04:15 - width
04:15 - is the amount of characters that this is
04:18 - long and
04:19 - let's say 20 and now this should be
04:22 - much smaller and it kind of resembles a
04:24 - post-it note which is kind of cool
04:27 - let's also change the amount of padding
04:29 - that we have
04:30 - we can do that with pad x and pad y so
04:33 - pad x
04:34 - let's say 20 and pad
04:37 - y also 20. so the text shouldn't
04:40 - actually touch any of the borders
04:43 - this is some sample
04:47 - text cool let's finish this by changing
04:51 - the font color so that is
04:52 - fg for foreground foreground equals
04:56 - and i'll pick purple because purple is a
04:58 - pretty color
05:00 - and let's run this one last time
05:04 - roses are red
05:07 - violets are blue
05:11 - booty booty booty booty
05:16 - rockin everywhere
05:22 - well that's the basics of the text
05:24 - widget in python if you would like a
05:26 - copy of all this code
05:27 - i'll post all of this in the comments
05:29 - down below but yeah that's the basics of
05:31 - the text widget in python
05:34 - hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you
05:37 - learn something
05:38 - new then you can help me help you in
05:41 - three easy steps
05:42 - by smashing that like button drop a
