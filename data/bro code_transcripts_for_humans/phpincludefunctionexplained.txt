00:00 - well well well look who it is in today's
00:02 - topic I'm going to explain the include
00:04 - function the include function copies the
00:07 - content of a file and includes it in
00:10 - your PHP file a few of the benefits is
00:13 - that sections of your website can become
00:15 - reusable any changes only need to be
00:17 - made in one place for example we could
00:20 - create an HTML document for a header and
00:23 - a footer within each page of our website
00:25 - we can include that same header and
00:27 - footer that header and footer file
00:29 - become reusable here's an example we
00:32 - will create a few files our index file
00:34 - will be our home page let's create one
00:37 - for an about us page about dot PHP
00:41 - and now there are four locations to list
00:44 - our locations for our imaginary business
00:47 - then we'll create an HTML file named
00:49 - header header.html
00:52 - then another named footer footer.html
00:57 - here are the files we'll be working with
00:58 - let's fill in our header file we'll
01:01 - create a standard header for a website
01:03 - for our header let's create a pair of
01:05 - header tags
01:08 - I'll add a title
01:10 - the title will be within a pair of H2
01:13 - header tags
01:14 - this is my website
01:19 - then we'll create a few links for a
01:20 - navigation bar
01:22 - let's set the first link to have an href
01:25 - attribute equal
01:27 - to our home page which we named
01:29 - index.php
01:31 - be sure to close it
01:33 - the text will be home
01:35 - let's copy this link paste it two times
01:39 - the second link will be for our about
01:41 - page
01:43 - change the text to about
01:46 - then locations locations.php
01:50 - then change the text to locations
01:54 - I'll add a horizontal rule as well
01:57 - that is good enough for our header
02:00 - let's head back to our index file
02:03 - to use the include function within your
02:05 - PHP script let me write that PHP
02:10 - all we have to do is type include
02:13 - it's a function then list the file name
02:16 - or the file path
02:18 - these two files are in the same website
02:20 - folder I only need to include the file
02:22 - name
02:24 - header dot HTML then when I save and
02:27 - reload everything we have our header
02:30 - then I could add some HTML afterwards
02:34 - so let's generate some html text within
02:38 - the body of my HTML I'll add a few
02:40 - sentences
02:41 - this is the home page
02:45 - I'll add a break
02:48 - stuff
02:50 - about your home page
02:53 - and go here
02:58 - then let's add a footer let's go to our
03:01 - footer HTML file I will use a pair of
03:04 - footer tags
03:06 - to create a footer
03:08 - I'll add a horizontal rule
03:12 - let's say author colon space type in
03:16 - your first and last name
03:19 - then I'll add a link for an email
03:22 - at href equals
03:25 - mail to come up with some email
03:33 - I'll add some text
03:39 - then close the anchor tag
03:41 - that's good enough for our footer our
03:44 - footer and our header are now complete
03:46 - let me close out of those
03:48 - we have our index page our about page
03:51 - and our locations page
03:53 - after we display everything that we
03:55 - would like for the home page let's
03:56 - display the footer the footer belongs at
03:59 - the bottom of our web page
04:01 - so let's copy our PHP script after our
04:04 - HTML markup let's include our footer
04:07 - footer.html
04:09 - there it is
04:11 - our header and our footer are reusable
04:13 - we only need to write these once and we
04:16 - can reuse them for every web page with
04:18 - our about page let's generate some HTML
04:23 - I'm going to copy these two lines of our
04:25 - body
04:28 - this is the about page
04:30 - stuff about your about page can go here
04:34 - I'm going to click on the link for our
04:36 - about page
04:38 - but we don't have that header or footer
04:41 - so let's add a PHP script before and
04:43 - after to include those
04:45 - PHP
04:48 - we will use the include function
04:51 - we will include list the file name and
04:54 - or the file path
04:57 - header.html and there is our header do
05:00 - the same thing with the footer
05:02 - PHP
05:05 - we will use the include function we are
05:08 - including our footer
05:11 - footer.html and there is the footer of
05:13 - our web page
05:15 - so now we can navigate between our home
05:17 - page and our about page
05:19 - they're both two completely different
05:21 - pages they have different text but we're
05:24 - reusing the same header and footer
05:27 - okay let's finish this with our
05:29 - locations page I'm just going to copy
05:30 - all of this just to expedite everything
05:34 - this is the locations page stuff about
05:37 - your location page can go here
05:41 - okay let's click on our locations page
05:45 - and we are now within the locations page
05:47 - again we're reusing the same header and
05:50 - the same footer parts of our website are
05:52 - functioning as components they're
05:54 - reusable
05:55 - we don't need to create an individual
05:57 - header for every file for every PHP file
06:00 - we can write them once then simply reuse
06:02 - them the cool thing is too if we need to
06:04 - make any changes they'll be reflected
06:06 - across every web page let me change my
06:09 - email to at gmail.com
06:13 - see my email just changed and that is
06:15 - reflected on every web page it helps
06:17 - with code reusability then let's change
06:19 - our title let's go to our header
06:22 - this is the type in your name
06:27 - bro code website
06:30 - and that change has been reflected
06:32 - across all of our web pages
06:34 - that is the include function you can
06:36 - include the contents of a file inside of
06:39 - your web page it helps with reusability
06:41 - and if you need to make any changes you
06:43 - can do so in just one place and that is
06:45 - the include function in PHP

Cleaned transcript:

well well well look who it is in today's topic I'm going to explain the include function the include function copies the content of a file and includes it in your PHP file a few of the benefits is that sections of your website can become reusable any changes only need to be made in one place for example we could create an HTML document for a header and a footer within each page of our website we can include that same header and footer that header and footer file become reusable here's an example we will create a few files our index file will be our home page let's create one for an about us page about dot PHP and now there are four locations to list our locations for our imaginary business then we'll create an HTML file named header header.html then another named footer footer.html here are the files we'll be working with let's fill in our header file we'll create a standard header for a website for our header let's create a pair of header tags I'll add a title the title will be within a pair of H2 header tags this is my website then we'll create a few links for a navigation bar let's set the first link to have an href attribute equal to our home page which we named index.php be sure to close it the text will be home let's copy this link paste it two times the second link will be for our about page change the text to about then locations locations.php then change the text to locations I'll add a horizontal rule as well that is good enough for our header let's head back to our index file to use the include function within your PHP script let me write that PHP all we have to do is type include it's a function then list the file name or the file path these two files are in the same website folder I only need to include the file name header dot HTML then when I save and reload everything we have our header then I could add some HTML afterwards so let's generate some html text within the body of my HTML I'll add a few sentences this is the home page I'll add a break stuff about your home page and go here then let's add a footer let's go to our footer HTML file I will use a pair of footer tags to create a footer I'll add a horizontal rule let's say author colon space type in your first and last name then I'll add a link for an email at href equals mail to come up with some email I'll add some text then close the anchor tag that's good enough for our footer our footer and our header are now complete let me close out of those we have our index page our about page and our locations page after we display everything that we would like for the home page let's display the footer the footer belongs at the bottom of our web page so let's copy our PHP script after our HTML markup let's include our footer footer.html there it is our header and our footer are reusable we only need to write these once and we can reuse them for every web page with our about page let's generate some HTML I'm going to copy these two lines of our body this is the about page stuff about your about page can go here I'm going to click on the link for our about page but we don't have that header or footer so let's add a PHP script before and after to include those PHP we will use the include function we will include list the file name and or the file path header.html and there is our header do the same thing with the footer PHP we will use the include function we are including our footer footer.html and there is the footer of our web page so now we can navigate between our home page and our about page they're both two completely different pages they have different text but we're reusing the same header and footer okay let's finish this with our locations page I'm just going to copy all of this just to expedite everything this is the locations page stuff about your location page can go here okay let's click on our locations page and we are now within the locations page again we're reusing the same header and the same footer parts of our website are functioning as components they're reusable we don't need to create an individual header for every file for every PHP file we can write them once then simply reuse them the cool thing is too if we need to make any changes they'll be reflected across every web page let me change my email to at gmail.com see my email just changed and that is reflected on every web page it helps with code reusability then let's change our title let's go to our header this is the type in your name bro code website and that change has been reflected across all of our web pages that is the include function you can include the contents of a file inside of your web page it helps with reusability and if you need to make any changes you can do so in just one place and that is the include function in PHP
