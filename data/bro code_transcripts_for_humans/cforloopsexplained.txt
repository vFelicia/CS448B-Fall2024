00:02 - all right guys in this video i'm going
00:03 - to explain for loops a for loop is a
00:06 - loop that will execute a block of code a
00:09 - specified amount of times to create a
00:11 - for loop we type four parentheses curly
00:14 - braces within the for loop there are up
00:17 - to three statements that we can add the
00:19 - first is that we can create an index a
00:21 - sort of counter
00:23 - int
00:24 - index i'll set the sequel to be
00:27 - we'll start at one then finish the
00:29 - statement with a semicolon now what a
00:32 - lot of people do instead of saying index
00:34 - they'll just shorten this to i
00:36 - the second statement is a stopping
00:38 - condition let's count up to three
00:41 - i'll continue this as long as i
00:43 - is less than or equal to three then
00:46 - semicolon to finish that statement the
00:49 - third statement is that we can increment
00:51 - or decrement our counter our index i'll
00:53 - increment my index by one by saying i
00:57 - plus plus okay let's repeat something
00:59 - three times
01:00 - standard
01:02 - output
01:04 - how about happy new year
01:06 - happy new year
01:10 - this code should be repeated three times
01:16 - happy new year happy new year happy new
01:18 - year i should probably add a new line
01:21 - now let's try this five times
01:23 - we'll begin i at one we'll continue this
01:26 - as long as i is less than or equal to
01:29 - five
01:30 - okay
01:31 - one two three four five that's it this
01:36 - time let's count up to ten then display
01:39 - happy new year once we exit out of the
01:41 - for loop
01:42 - i'll move this line to outside of the
01:44 - for loop
01:46 - i'll set i to be 1. we'll continue this
01:49 - as long as i is less than or equal to
01:51 - 10.
01:52 - during each iteration of the for loop i
01:55 - will display whatever i is
01:57 - standard output i
02:00 - then i'll add a new line
02:04 - okay
02:07 - here we go
02:10 - we're starting at 1
02:12 - then we're counting up to 10
02:14 - then we escape the for loop once we
02:16 - escape the for loop then we print happy
02:18 - new year when you increment or decrement
02:20 - your counter you can skip iterations
02:23 - let's increase i by two after each
02:25 - iteration
02:26 - i plus equals two
02:28 - now we're counting up by twos
02:32 - one three five seven nine happy new year
02:34 - we can even set our index to be a
02:36 - different number let's begin at zero
02:38 - we're still counting up by twos
02:40 - zero two four six eight happy new year
02:43 - we could even increment i by three
02:47 - zero three six nine happy new year or we
02:50 - could decrement and go backwards
02:52 - i minus minus
02:54 - this time we will begin at 10 then
02:56 - continue as long as i is less than or
02:59 - equal to zero
03:01 - so this would be a countdown ten nine
03:03 - eight seven six five four
03:06 - three two one zero happy new year okay
03:09 - let's decrement i by two after each
03:11 - iteration i minus equals two
03:15 - ten eight six four two zero happy new
03:18 - year so yeah everybody that's a for loop
03:20 - there's a lot of overlap where you could
03:22 - use either a while loop or a for loop
03:24 - for loops tend to be better in
03:26 - situations where you only need to repeat
03:28 - code a certain amount of times your
03:30 - assignment is to post a use of the for
03:32 - loop in the comment section down below
03:34 - and well yeah those are for loops in c
03:36 - plus
