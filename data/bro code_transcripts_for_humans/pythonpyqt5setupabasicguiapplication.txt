00:00 - all right everybody in today's video
00:01 - we're going to get started working with
00:03 - the pi qd5 graphical user interface also
00:06 - known as a guey GUI in this topic we'll
00:09 - be creating a basic window so let's get
00:12 - started all right the first step is that
00:14 - using pip we're going to install the pi
00:16 - qt5 package open up a terminal both py
00:20 - charm and VSS code have a built-in
00:21 - terminal that you can
00:23 - use we're going to use pip that is
00:25 - Python's package manager pip install Pi
00:31 - qt5 enter and this might just take a
00:35 - second once your download has finished
00:38 - you should have a package within your
00:39 - site packages folder named Pi qt5 we can
00:43 - work with it as long as we import
00:45 - it first we are going to import the
00:49 - module of CIS CIS meaning system this
00:52 - module provides access to variables used
00:55 - and maintained by the python interpreter
00:57 - then from the package of Pi qt5 do pay
01:02 - attention to the capitalization it's
01:04 - easy to mess that up use dot to access
01:07 - the module of
01:09 - QT widgets widgets are the building
01:13 - blocks of a pi qt5 application they
01:16 - begin with Q that helps distinguish them
01:18 - from widgets from other libraries they
01:20 - typically begin with Q from this module
01:24 - import the following widgets Q
01:28 - application
01:30 - and Q main
01:34 - window here's some boiler plate code
01:36 - that we have to write in order to get
01:37 - this application up and running first we
01:39 - will create a class of main window which
01:44 - will inherit from the class of Cain
01:47 - window by inheriting from the parent of
01:50 - Cain window we can customize our own
01:52 - Windows to display to the user we will
01:55 - need a Constructor let's define that
01:58 - Define Dunder inet
02:00 - there will be no arguments currently
02:02 - besides self and in case we have to pass
02:04 - any arguments to the parent of Cain
02:06 - window we will access the super class
02:09 - that's the parent and call the parents
02:13 - Constructor but currently we don't have
02:15 - any arguments to pass
02:17 - in we will return to this class
02:20 - momentarily let's define a function of
02:23 - main When We Begin this program we will
02:25 - call the function of main to begin the
02:28 - application for now all right
02:31 - pass if we are running this file
02:33 - directly let's add the following if
02:36 - statement if Dunder name is equal to a
02:40 - string of Dunder main if we are running
02:43 - this file directly call the main
02:45 - function in order for us to
02:48 - begin if that's true we will call the
02:50 - function of main within the main
02:53 - function we will create an app object
02:56 - app equals we will call the Constructor
02:59 - for Q application that class but there's
03:03 - one argument that we have to pass in we
03:05 - will access our module of CIS do AR
03:10 - RGV meaning arguments so by passing in
03:14 - this argument this allows Pi QT to
03:17 - process any command line arguments
03:18 - intended for it that's if we use command
03:20 - prompt or terminal we won't be doing
03:22 - that in the series but you may someday
03:24 - in the future it would be a good idea
03:26 - for us to Future proof our code
03:29 - otherwise you may see people pass in an
03:30 - empty list so we now have an app object
03:34 - next we will create a window object
03:36 - window equals call The Constructor for
03:40 - our class of main window currently we
03:43 - don't have any arguments to pass in we
03:45 - have an app object and a window object
03:47 - by calling their respective Constructors
03:50 - now if I run this program currently our
03:52 - window is not going to show the default
03:55 - behavior for a window is to hide it in
03:59 - order to to show our window we will
04:01 - access our window call the show method
04:04 - to show
04:05 - it it's only going to appear for a brief
04:08 - second when I run this
04:10 - script I don't know if you saw it but it
04:13 - pops up for a brief
04:15 - second we need to ensure that the window
04:17 - stays until we interact with it or close
04:20 - it after we show our window we will
04:23 - access our module of
04:25 - CIS called the exit method the exit
04:29 - method method ensures a clean exit of
04:31 - our program within our exit method we
04:34 - will pass in as an argument our app
04:37 - object our app object has a built-in
04:40 - method of
04:43 - excore and this is a method so we can
04:45 - call it this is the execute method there
04:48 - is an underscore character after exec
04:51 - for execute that distinguishes it from
04:54 - the execute method there is a separate
04:56 - version of this execute function that
04:58 - ends with an underscore our apps execute
05:01 - method it waits around for user input
05:03 - and handles events such as if we click
05:05 - buttons press keys or close the window
05:09 - now that we're calling this method when
05:10 - we run our program this window should
05:13 - stay in place we can maximize it
05:17 - minimize it or close
05:20 - it that's all the boiler plate code that
05:23 - we need for a basic window let's
05:25 - customize it within our Constructor for
05:28 - our main window What would would we like
05:30 - to add let's set the title for our
05:33 - window
05:35 - self. set window title method we will
05:40 - pass in a string think of a title for
05:42 - your
05:43 - program my cool first GUI
05:50 - gooey and now we have a new title my
05:53 - cool first guey graphical user
05:56 - interface when this window appears we
05:59 - can can set the geometry of where the
06:01 - window appears and the size of the
06:03 - window access self dot set geometry
06:10 - method there's four
06:12 - arguments X and Y for the X and Y
06:15 - coordinates a width of the window and a
06:18 - height of the window if I were to set X
06:21 - and Y to be both zero this window will
06:24 - appear in the top left corner of my
06:26 - screen I'll also need a width and a
06:28 - height let let's say I don't
06:31 - know 500 for
06:34 - each so now my window is now a square
06:38 - the width and the height are both the
06:39 - same they're both 500 the width is 500
06:42 - pixels the height is 500 pixels with the
06:45 - first two arguments we set the initial
06:48 - placement of our window to be where X is
06:50 - z and y is zero that corresponds to the
06:53 - top left corner if I set the first
06:56 - argument to be
06:57 - 100 well then the window window is going
07:00 - to move to the right by 100 pixels there
07:03 - are ways to Center your window in the
07:05 - very center of your screen but that's a
07:07 - little too advanced for us right now for
07:10 - the time being I'll pick something
07:11 - roughly near the middle of my screen 700
07:15 - pixels on the x axis and 300 on the Y
07:18 - AIS it should appear roughly in the
07:21 - middle but feel free to adjust these
07:23 - values based on the size of your screen
07:25 - we'll discuss layouts in the future now
07:28 - if you would like a a window icon we can
07:31 - change that you will need an image to
07:33 - work with So within my project
07:37 - folder I have a profile picture for my
07:39 - YouTube channel I'll set that to be the
07:42 - icon find an image that you like then
07:45 - add it to your project
07:46 - folder in order to work with icons we'll
07:49 - need to make the following import from
07:52 - PI
07:53 - qt5 that's the package access the module
07:57 - of QT
08:00 - GUI import the following Q icon now we
08:06 - can work with
08:08 - icons after we set the geometry for our
08:12 - window access this object of self this
08:15 - main window call the method of set
08:19 - window
08:21 - icon within this method we will call the
08:24 - Constructor of Q icon we'll pass in
08:28 - either a relative file path or an
08:30 - absolute file path my main python file
08:33 - is right next to my profile picture that
08:36 - image I only need the file name within a
08:39 - string so the name of my image it's
08:42 - going to be different for you depending
08:43 - on what the name of your image is my
08:45 - image is named profile uncore pick and
08:50 - this image is a JPEG
08:53 - jpg then when I run this program I'm
08:57 - using my image as an icon for this
08:59 - window
09:00 - window all right everybody that is how
09:02 - to create a window using pi qt5 and in
09:05 - the next topic we will be creating some
09:07 - labeles

Cleaned transcript:

all right everybody in today's video we're going to get started working with the pi qd5 graphical user interface also known as a guey GUI in this topic we'll be creating a basic window so let's get

would would we like to add let's set the title for our window self. set window title method we will pass in a string think of a title for your program my cool first GUI gooey and now we have a new title my cool first guey graphical user interface when this window appears we can can set the geometry of where the window appears and the size of the window access self dot set geometry method there's four arguments X and Y for the X and Y coordinates a width of the window and a height of the window if I were to set X and Y to be both zero this window will appear in the top left corner of my screen I'll also need a width and a height let let's say I don't know 500 for each so now my window is now a square the width and the height are both the same they're both 500 the width is 500

this main window call the method of set window icon within this method we will call the Constructor of Q icon we'll pass in either a relative file path or an absolute file path my main python file is right next to my profile picture that image I only need the file name within a string so the name of my image it's going to be different for you depending on what the name of your image is my image is named profile uncore pick and this image is a JPEG jpg then when I run this program I'm using my image as an icon for this window window all right everybody that is how to create a window using pi qt5 and in the next topic we will be creating some labeles
