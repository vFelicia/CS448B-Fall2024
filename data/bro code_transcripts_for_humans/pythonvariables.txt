00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's bro
00:02 - hope you're doing well and in this video
00:04 - i'm going to explain how
00:05 - variables work in python so sit back
00:08 - relax
00:09 - and enjoy the show
00:12 - if you find this video helpful please
00:14 - remember to like
00:15 - comment and subscribe your support will
00:18 - help keep this channel running
00:20 - all right let's do this a variable is a
00:23 - container for a value it behaves as the
00:25 - value that it contains
00:27 - it's much like in algebra lessons back
00:29 - in the day where we had to solve for
00:31 - whatever value x was
00:33 - and then we can reuse x and it behaved
00:35 - exactly as that value
00:36 - well with programming we can do that
00:38 - plus we can assign variables of
00:40 - different data types
00:41 - so they are not limited to just numbers
00:43 - we can assign whole words
00:45 - numbers and even these things called
00:47 - booleans which are either true or false
00:49 - but i'll get more in depth into data
00:51 - types a little bit later on in this
00:52 - video
00:53 - so let's create a variable and this is
00:54 - how to do so we need a unique name for
00:56 - this variable
00:57 - let's say name name equals some value
01:00 - now the first data type that we'll cover
01:02 - is strings a string is a series of
01:05 - characters
01:06 - so to create a string we can either use
01:08 - single quotes or
01:09 - double quotes in python and we can
01:11 - assign this a value of whatever your own
01:14 - name is
01:14 - so i will assign this variable name a
01:17 - value of bro
01:18 - now this variable will behave exactly as
01:20 - if it was
01:21 - this value this name and then we can
01:23 - reuse this variable for something so
01:26 - let's print whatever our name is print
01:29 - name and this will print whatever your
01:31 - name is to the console window
01:33 - now when you print your variable make
01:35 - sure you don't put it within quotes
01:37 - because what we're doing then is
01:39 - literally printing
01:40 - the word name as you can see here so
01:44 - if you need to use your variable for
01:45 - something make sure it's not within
01:47 - quotes
01:48 - now we can combine our string variable
01:51 - with another string so within our print
01:53 - statement let's print
01:54 - a string literal such as hello space
01:58 - plus name so we are combining strings
02:01 - and then we're printing the results to
02:02 - the console window so this will print
02:05 - hello bro now you can actually check the
02:08 - data type of a variable
02:09 - so i'm going to turn this line into a
02:11 - comment so what you'll do
02:13 - is take the name of the variable
02:15 - surround this with a set of parentheses
02:17 - and then precede the set of parentheses
02:19 - with the type
02:20 - function and this will print the data
02:22 - type of this variable to the console
02:24 - window
02:25 - and you can see that it says class str
02:28 - short for string
02:29 - a string is a series of characters a
02:31 - name is a good example of a string a
02:33 - series of characters
02:34 - so that is how to check the data type of
02:37 - a variable just use the type function
02:40 - now you can actually combine
02:41 - variables together as long as they're of
02:43 - the same data type
02:45 - so let's change our name to maybe first
02:47 - name and we'll create a second variable
02:49 - called last name
02:50 - now a common naming convention with
02:52 - variables if it has
02:54 - two words separate each word with an
02:56 - underscore
02:57 - it's not necessary but it's common
02:59 - practice for python and honestly i
03:00 - sometimes forget about that but don't
03:02 - tell anybody
03:03 - so let's create another variable called
03:05 - last name last
03:06 - name equals whatever your last name is
03:10 - and then let's create a third variable
03:12 - called full name
03:13 - full underscore name and let's combine
03:17 - first name plus last
03:20 - name and let us display full name
03:24 - along with hello plus full name
03:28 - now these two names were combined
03:29 - together to create a
03:31 - whole new variable actually what i think
03:33 - i'll do is add a space
03:35 - within my variable so i'm doing a bunch
03:38 - of string concatenation i'm combining
03:40 - the variable first name plus a space
03:42 - character plus
03:43 - last name so the result is hello
03:45 - whatever your first name and last name
03:47 - is
03:48 - so that is a variable of the string data
03:51 - type it is a series of characters
03:53 - now with strings we cannot normally use
03:56 - these for any sort of math
03:58 - that's where the next data type comes in
04:00 - for the time being i just turned all of
04:01 - these lines into comments and we are
04:03 - going to move on to the
04:04 - int data type short for integer this
04:07 - time let's create a variable called
04:09 - age and we will assign this a value of
04:11 - whatever your age is
04:12 - let's just say that i'm 21 now when you
04:14 - assign
04:15 - a value of the int data type make sure
04:18 - that it is
04:19 - not within quotes because then
04:21 - technically it would be a string then
04:22 - and you can see that the color scheme
04:24 - for this number actually changed
04:26 - so if this was a string we would treat
04:28 - it different
04:29 - than an int data type because with
04:31 - strings we cannot normally use them for
04:33 - any sort of math
04:34 - so we now have a variable called edge
04:37 - and we can actually
04:38 - increase or decrease or do whatever we
04:40 - want with the edge let's increase our
04:42 - age by one let's say it's our birthday
04:44 - to do so we would say age
04:46 - equals edge plus one and then let's
04:49 - print our
04:49 - age to the console window print edge
04:52 - and you can see that it says i am 22.
04:55 - now there's a shorthand way of writing
04:56 - this
04:57 - what you'll do is type age plus equals
05:00 - one
05:00 - so that's kind of like a shortcut and
05:02 - this would work the same too
05:03 - now let's print the data type of our age
05:06 - variable because we can within a print
05:08 - statement i will print the edge
05:10 - and add my edge variable to this type
05:13 - function and this will print the data
05:16 - type of my edge variable to the console
05:17 - window
05:18 - and i will turn this line into a comment
05:20 - just so that it doesn't get in the way
05:22 - now if i were to print the data type of
05:24 - my age variable
05:25 - as you can see it is of the int data
05:28 - type short for integer
05:29 - it only stores a whole integer number
05:33 - now what if this was a string so what
05:36 - i'm going to do
05:37 - is surround my value within a set of
05:39 - quotes
05:40 - and i will turn this line into a comment
05:42 - so that it does not get in the way
05:43 - you can see that the data type of my age
05:45 - variable is now
05:46 - a string and with strings we cannot
05:49 - normally use them for any sort of math
05:51 - so let's attempt to increase our age
05:53 - variable by one
05:54 - and we ran into an error a type error
05:57 - can only concatenate string
05:59 - to string not end now the point being is
06:02 - that
06:02 - it's important to use the appropriate
06:04 - data type because
06:06 - with strings we cannot normally use them
06:08 - for any sort of math you'll want to use
06:09 - a data type of a numeric value
06:12 - an int or a float which we'll discuss a
06:14 - little bit later now here's a situation
06:16 - to consider
06:16 - what if we would like to display our
06:18 - edge variable along with a string
06:20 - literal much like what we did with this
06:22 - line involving a string literal such as
06:25 - hello
06:25 - plus the user's full name so let's
06:27 - attempt to do so and this is not going
06:29 - to work and i'll explain why
06:31 - so within our print statement let's say
06:33 - something such as
06:34 - your age is plus
06:38 - edge now we're going to run into a type
06:41 - error
06:41 - that's because we attempted to use
06:43 - string concatenation with a string
06:45 - literal
06:46 - and a variable of a different data type
06:49 - a variable of the
06:50 - int data type in order to display our
06:53 - edge
06:53 - along with the string we would need to
06:55 - convert our edge variable to the string
06:57 - data type and one way in which we can do
06:59 - that is by type casting
07:02 - and we'll cover this more in the next
07:03 - video so we're going to surround
07:05 - our age variable that is of the in data
07:08 - type with a set of parentheses
07:09 - and precede this with str short for
07:12 - string
07:12 - and this will convert our variable to a
07:15 - string that will allow us to display it
07:17 - with another string
07:18 - now if we were to run this program this
07:20 - way this will now display
07:22 - your age is and in this case 22 so if
07:25 - you need to display a variable of a
07:27 - different data type
07:28 - along with the string you would just
07:30 - need to use a string cast to convert
07:32 - that data type to a string
07:34 - but we'll cover this more in the next
07:35 - video on typecasting
07:37 - so that is the int data type it stores a
07:40 - whole integer number and the next data
07:43 - type is the float data type
07:45 - and i'm going to turn these lines into
07:46 - comments and we can move on
07:48 - now the float data type is a numeric
07:50 - value that can store
07:51 - a number that includes a decimal portion
07:54 - an int data type cannot store a decimal
07:57 - portion
07:58 - that's why it's in short for integer it
08:00 - only stores a whole number
08:01 - this time let's say we have a height and
08:04 - i will assign this
08:05 - a perfectly normal height of maybe 250.5
08:09 - centimeters so this decimal portion is
08:11 - important
08:12 - that's indicating that this is a
08:14 - floating point number a float for short
08:16 - so let's print our height to the console
08:18 - window print
08:20 - height and this will print whatever my
08:22 - height is and now
08:23 - let's check the type of our height using
08:26 - the type function
08:27 - so within a print statement i'm going to
08:30 - add my height
08:31 - surround this with another set of
08:32 - parentheses and precede this
08:35 - with the type function and the data type
08:38 - of my variable height is a float short
08:41 - for a floating point number
08:42 - a numeric value that contains a decimal
08:44 - portion and now for practice
08:46 - let's print our height along with a
08:48 - string literal
08:49 - so let's create a string literal such as
08:53 - your height is
08:56 - plus height but guess what we're going
08:58 - to do some type casting
08:59 - so surround height with a set of
09:01 - parentheses and precede this with str so
09:04 - that we convert
09:05 - height to a string so that we can use
09:07 - string concatenation within this print
09:08 - statement
09:09 - and this will print the message your
09:11 - height is
09:12 - 250.5 actually let's add centimeters to
09:15 - the end so
09:16 - plus cm
09:20 - and there we go and that is what a
09:22 - floating point number is
09:23 - float for short it is a numeric value
09:25 - that contains a decimal portion
09:27 - now the last data type that we're going
09:29 - to cover is the boolean data type it is
09:32 - a variable that can only store
09:34 - true or false let's say we have a
09:36 - variable called human
09:38 - if we were to assign this a boolean
09:40 - value this would be either true
09:42 - or false and we can print whatever this
09:45 - value is
09:46 - let's print whatever human is and this
09:48 - will display false
09:50 - now the reason that you may want to use
09:52 - booleans instead of strings
09:53 - even though you can still store a string
09:56 - representation of the word false or true
09:58 - is that these are very useful when we
10:01 - get to if statements
10:02 - we can check to see if some statement is
10:04 - true so that is a good use of
10:07 - boolean values now let's check the data
10:10 - type
10:10 - of my human variable so let's print
10:14 - type human and this will print to the
10:18 - console window
10:19 - bool short for boolean now make sure
10:21 - you're not putting this within quotes
10:23 - because then it's technically a string
10:25 - and they behave differently
10:26 - now the data type is a string and you
10:28 - may have noticed as well that the font
10:30 - color has changed between
10:32 - strings and boolean values so that's
10:34 - another good indicator
10:35 - now what if you need to display your
10:38 - value along with a string using string
10:40 - concatenation
10:41 - well guess what we're going to typecast
10:42 - again so let's print something
10:47 - are you a human
10:51 - so we need to use string concatenation
10:53 - so i will convert
10:55 - my boolean variable of human to a string
10:58 - and i have been programmed to inform you
11:01 - that
11:02 - yes i am in fact a human that is true
11:04 - well everyone
11:05 - that is the basics of variables it is a
11:08 - container for a value and they behave
11:10 - as the value that they contain there are
11:12 - four basic data types
11:14 - strings which store a series of
11:16 - characters ins
11:17 - which store a whole integer floats which
11:20 - are floating point numbers a numeric
11:22 - value with a decimal
11:24 - and booleans which only store true or
11:27 - false
11:28 - and they're very useful with if
11:29 - statements so
11:31 - that is it for variables if you would
11:32 - like a copy of all this code
11:34 - i will copy and paste all of this to the
11:36 - comments section down below
11:37 - but yeah that is how variables work in
11:40 - python
11:42 - hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you
11:44 - learned something new
11:45 - then help me help you in three easy
11:48 - steps
11:48 - by smashing that like button drop a

Cleaned transcript:

hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain how variables work in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running all right let's do this a variable is a container for a value it behaves as the value that it contains it's much like in algebra lessons back in the day where we had to solve for whatever value x was and then we can reuse x and it behaved exactly as that value well with programming we can do that plus we can assign variables of different data types so they are not limited to just numbers we can assign whole words numbers and even these things called booleans which are either true or false but i'll get more in depth into data types a little bit later on in this video so let's create a variable and this is how to do so we need a unique name for this variable let's say name name equals some value now the first data type that we'll cover is strings a string is a series of characters so to create a string we can either use single quotes or double quotes in python and we can assign this a value of whatever your own name is so i will assign this variable name a value of bro now this variable will behave exactly as if it was this value this name and then we can reuse this variable for something so let's print whatever our name is print name and this will print whatever your name is to the console window now when you print your variable make sure you don't put it within quotes because what we're doing then is literally printing the word name as you can see here so if you need to use your variable for something make sure it's not within quotes now we can combine our string variable with another string so within our print statement let's print a string literal such as hello space plus name so we are combining strings and then we're printing the results to the console window so this will print hello bro now you can actually check the data type of a variable so i'm going to turn this line into a comment so what you'll do is take the name of the variable surround this with a set of parentheses and then precede the set of parentheses with the type function and this will print the data type of this variable to the console window and you can see that it says class str short for string a string is a series of characters a name is a good example of a string a series of characters so that is how to check the data type of a variable just use the type function now you can actually combine variables together as long as they're of the same data type so let's change our name to maybe first name and we'll create a second variable called last name now a common naming convention with variables if it has two words separate each word with an underscore it's not necessary but it's common practice for python and honestly i sometimes forget about that but don't tell anybody so let's create another variable called last name last name equals whatever your last name is and then let's create a third variable called full name full underscore name and let's combine first name plus last name and let us display full name along with hello plus full name now these two names were combined together to create a whole new variable actually what i think i'll do is add a space within my variable so i'm doing a bunch of string concatenation i'm combining the variable first name plus a space character plus last name so the result is hello whatever your first name and last name is so that is a variable of the string data type it is a series of characters now with strings we cannot normally use these for any sort of math that's where the next data type comes in for the time being i just turned all of these lines into comments and we are going to move on to the int data type short for integer this time let's create a variable called age and we will assign this a value of whatever your age is let's just say that i'm 21 now when you assign a value of the int data type make sure that it is not within quotes because then technically it would be a string then and you can see that the color scheme for this number actually changed so if this was a string we would treat it different than an int data type because with strings we cannot normally use them for any sort of math so we now have a variable called edge and we can actually increase or decrease or do whatever we want with the edge let's increase our age by one let's say it's our birthday to do so we would say age equals edge plus one and then let's print our age to the console window print edge and you can see that it says i am 22. now there's a shorthand way of writing this what you'll do is type age plus equals one so that's kind of like a shortcut and this would work the same too now let's print the data type of our age variable because we can within a print statement i will print the edge and add my edge variable to this type function and this will print the data type of my edge variable to the console window and i will turn this line into a comment just so that it doesn't get in the way now if i were to print the data type of my age variable as you can see it is of the int data type short for integer it only stores a whole integer number now what if this was a string so what i'm going to do is surround my value within a set of quotes and i will turn this line into a comment so that it does not get in the way you can see that the data type of my age variable is now a string and with strings we cannot normally use them for any sort of math so let's attempt to increase our age variable by one and we ran into an error a type error can only concatenate string to string not end now the point being is that it's important to use the appropriate data type because with strings we cannot normally use them for any sort of math you'll want to use a data type of a numeric value an int or a float which we'll discuss a little bit later now here's a situation to consider what if we would like to display our edge variable along with a string literal much like what we did with this line involving a string literal such as hello plus the user's full name so let's attempt to do so and this is not going to work and i'll explain why so within our print statement let's say something such as your age is plus edge now we're going to run into a type error that's because we attempted to use string concatenation with a string literal and a variable of a different data type a variable of the int data type in order to display our edge along with the string we would need to convert our edge variable to the string data type and one way in which we can do that is by type casting and we'll cover this more in the next video so we're going to surround our age variable that is of the in data type with a set of parentheses and precede this with str short for string and this will convert our variable to a string that will allow us to display it with another string now if we were to run this program this way this will now display your age is and in this case 22 so if you need to display a variable of a different data type along with the string you would just need to use a string cast to convert that data type to a string but we'll cover this more in the next video on typecasting so that is the int data type it stores a whole integer number and the next data type is the float data type and i'm going to turn these lines into comments and we can move on now the float data type is a numeric value that can store a number that includes a decimal portion an int data type cannot store a decimal portion that's why it's in short for integer it only stores a whole number this time let's say we have a height and i will assign this a perfectly normal height of maybe 250.5 centimeters so this decimal portion is important that's indicating that this is a floating point number a float for short so let's print our height to the console window print height and this will print whatever my height is and now let's check the type of our height using the type function so within a print statement i'm going to add my height surround this with another set of parentheses and precede this with the type function and the data type of my variable height is a float short for a floating point number a numeric value that contains a decimal portion and now for practice let's print our height along with a string literal so let's create a string literal such as your height is plus height but guess what we're going to do some type casting so surround height with a set of parentheses and precede this with str so that we convert height to a string so that we can use string concatenation within this print statement and this will print the message your height is 250.5 actually let's add centimeters to the end so plus cm and there we go and that is what a floating point number is float for short it is a numeric value that contains a decimal portion now the last data type that we're going to cover is the boolean data type it is a variable that can only store true or false let's say we have a variable called human if we were to assign this a boolean value this would be either true or false and we can print whatever this value is let's print whatever human is and this will display false now the reason that you may want to use booleans instead of strings even though you can still store a string representation of the word false or true is that these are very useful when we get to if statements we can check to see if some statement is true so that is a good use of boolean values now let's check the data type of my human variable so let's print type human and this will print to the console window bool short for boolean now make sure you're not putting this within quotes because then it's technically a string and they behave differently now the data type is a string and you may have noticed as well that the font color has changed between strings and boolean values so that's another good indicator now what if you need to display your value along with a string using string concatenation well guess what we're going to typecast again so let's print something are you a human so we need to use string concatenation so i will convert my boolean variable of human to a string and i have been programmed to inform you that yes i am in fact a human that is true well everyone that is the basics of variables it is a container for a value and they behave as the value that they contain there are four basic data types strings which store a series of characters ins which store a whole integer floats which are floating point numbers a
