00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's you
00:02 - bro hope you're doing well
00:03 - and in this video i'm going to
00:04 - demonstrate how we can create a menu bar
00:06 - in javafx
00:07 - so sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:12 - all right menu bars menu bars are found
00:15 - underneath the controls
00:16 - drop down menu so drag and drop one
00:19 - place it anywhere that you wish
00:20 - i'll place mine in the top left corner
00:22 - of my pane
00:23 - and by holding down one of the sides of
00:25 - your menu bar you can expand the
00:27 - dimensions of your menu bar
00:28 - i'll expand mine so that it takes up the
00:31 - entire width of my pane
00:33 - now if you were to head to hierarchy
00:35 - there's a hierarchy of nodes within a
00:37 - menu bar
00:38 - by default there are three menus found
00:41 - within my menu bar
00:42 - file edit and help you can add menus
00:45 - delete menus or change the text of a
00:47 - menu
00:48 - let's say i would no longer like this
00:50 - edit menu i can right click then go to
00:52 - delete
00:53 - and it's gone to change the text of a
00:56 - menu
00:56 - we can either double click on our menu
00:59 - or we can go to text and change it here
01:01 - let's say help is now help me with a
01:04 - bunch of exclamation points
01:06 - now you can add a menu by going to the
01:09 - menu drop down menu
01:10 - and there's a bunch of nodes related to
01:12 - menu bars
01:13 - so we are looking for a menu node and
01:16 - let's say we would like
01:17 - a new menu between our file menu and
01:20 - help me menu
01:21 - so i will drag and drop this and place
01:23 - it between my file menu
01:25 - and help me menu within my hierarchy so
01:28 - i will drag and drop this and place it
01:29 - about here
01:30 - and i'll give this some text of
01:33 - something because i can't think of
01:35 - anything as of now we have three menus
01:38 - within
01:38 - our menu bar file something and help me
01:42 - we can preview our program by going to
01:44 - our menu bar found within scene builder
01:46 - then going to preview then show preview
01:49 - and window
01:50 - so here are the three menus that we
01:53 - created file
01:54 - something and help me if you were to
01:56 - click on one of these menus
01:57 - this will display a drop down list of
02:00 - different
02:00 - menu items and these are separate nodes
02:03 - so to add a menu item
02:05 - click on the plus button of one of your
02:08 - menus let's say we would like to add
02:09 - more menu items to our
02:11 - menu node by default there is a close
02:14 - menu item
02:15 - so to add a menu item go to the menu
02:18 - item node
02:18 - found underneath the menu drop down menu
02:21 - then drag and drop it and place it
02:23 - underneath
02:23 - a menu of your choosing and we can give
02:26 - this some text
02:27 - let's say this will be a new menu item
02:31 - and let's preview it show in preview
02:33 - file
02:34 - new close let's add another for practice
02:37 - what about a save menu item so that
02:40 - would be
02:40 - menu item drag and drop it i'll place
02:42 - this after
02:44 - new change the text to save let's
02:46 - preview
02:47 - underneath file we have new save and
02:50 - close
02:51 - now there's also this separator menu
02:53 - item
02:54 - this separates different groups of menu
02:56 - items
02:57 - so this is basically just a horizontal
03:00 - line that is drawn across
03:02 - so i'll demonstrate so i'm going to go
03:03 - to preview show in preview
03:05 - and between save and close we have this
03:08 - horizontal line
03:09 - basically this will separate different
03:11 - groups of menu items
03:12 - this is a separator menu item node
03:16 - another interesting node is the check
03:18 - menu item node
03:20 - so this gives us the ability to toggle
03:22 - between being checked and unchecked
03:24 - let's say that we have some sort of auto
03:26 - save feature
03:28 - so i'm just going to name the text of
03:30 - this check menu item auto save
03:32 - then preview so with this check menu
03:36 - item we can toggle this
03:37 - on or off so this is a check
03:40 - menu item node now there's also radio
03:43 - menu items we can only select
03:45 - one radio menu item from any toggle
03:48 - group
03:48 - so let's say we have some additional
03:50 - options let's say we have
03:52 - option one and then a second
03:56 - radio menu item which will be named
03:59 - option two let me place that here
04:02 - and we want to be sure to include them
04:05 - within
04:05 - the same toggle group if we can only
04:07 - select one of these radio menu items
04:09 - so let's say that this toggle group will
04:11 - be
04:13 - my group i suppose
04:16 - and let's do the same for our other
04:19 - radio menu item
04:21 - okay let's preview it show in preview
04:23 - file we have option one and option two
04:25 - we can only select one of these options
04:28 - because these are
04:29 - radio menu item nodes and they are
04:32 - within
04:32 - the same toggle group now to link a
04:35 - method call to one of your menu items
04:37 - click
04:37 - on a menu item head to the code drop
04:40 - down menu
04:41 - and within on action list a method name
04:44 - that you plan on defining
04:45 - let's create a method named new
04:49 - method so before we head to our
04:52 - controller class
04:53 - let's make sure that our controller
04:54 - class is linked
04:56 - let's save and head to our controller
04:58 - class
05:00 - now make sure that you update your fxml
05:02 - file you can always refresh your project
05:04 - by right-clicking
05:05 - then going to refresh now we'll need to
05:08 - define that method public
05:10 - void new method
05:14 - all we'll do is print a message to our
05:16 - console
05:18 - you selected the new
05:22 - menu item okay
05:25 - let's run it here's my menu bar i have
05:28 - three separate menus
05:29 - file something help me i have a bunch of
05:31 - different menu items within
05:33 - this menu of file new save auto save
05:36 - option one option two
05:37 - so we linked this new method method
05:40 - to my new menu item if i was to click on
05:44 - this menu item
05:45 - it will invoke this method of new method
05:48 - which will print you selected the new
05:51 - menu
05:51 - item now before you go i'm going to show
05:54 - you all how we can use a keyboard
05:56 - shortcut to select one of these menu
05:57 - items
05:58 - what we need to do is add an accelerator
06:00 - and we can do that within
06:02 - scene builder so within scene builder
06:03 - let's head to our hierarchy and i'm
06:05 - going to add an accelerator to
06:07 - our new menu item that can be found
06:10 - underneath
06:10 - properties then go to accelerator and we
06:13 - need a modifier
06:15 - and a key let's set the keyboard
06:17 - shortcut to select
06:18 - our new menu item to be what about alt
06:22 - and n so the modifier will be
06:26 - alt let's say alt down and the main key
06:28 - will be n
06:29 - and for new okay so let's save then head
06:32 - back to our controller and run it
06:34 - make sure that you refresh your project
06:36 - as well
06:37 - now let's run it
06:41 - so next to my new menu item we have
06:44 - this keyboard shortcut of alt plus n
06:47 - let's try it
06:48 - so i'm going to hold down alt then type
06:50 - n
06:51 - you selected the new menu item well
06:54 - everybody that's how to create a menu
06:56 - bar
06:57 - in javafx don't be afraid to smash that

menu item we can toggle this on or off so this is a check menu item node now there's also radio menu items we can only select one radio menu item from any toggle group so let's say we have some additional options let's say we have option one and then a second radio menu item which will be named option two let me place that here and we want to be sure to include them within the same toggle group if we can only select one of these radio menu items so let's say that this toggle group will be my group i suppose and let's do the same for our other radio menu item okay let's preview it show in preview file we have option one and option two we can only select one of these options because these are radio menu item nodes and they are within the same toggle group now to link a method call to one of your menu items click on a menu item head to the code drop down menu and within on action list a method name that you plan on defining let's create a method named new method so before we head to our controller class let's make sure that our controller class is linked let's save and head to our controller class now make sure that you update your fxml file you can always refresh your project
