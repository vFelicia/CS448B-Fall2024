00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's bro
00:02 - hope you're doing well
00:03 - and in this video we're going to be
00:04 - covering some basic file detection using
00:07 - python so
00:08 - sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:12 - if you wouldn't mind please like comment
00:15 - and subscribe
00:16 - one like equals one prayer for the
00:18 - youtube algorithm
00:20 - welcome ladies and gentlemen to the
00:22 - beginning of a mini series involving
00:24 - doing stuff with files using python and
00:26 - in this video we're going to be doing
00:28 - some basic
00:28 - file detection and in order to do so i
00:31 - recommend
00:32 - importing the os module it's already
00:34 - included with the standard python
00:36 - library
00:36 - all you need to do is import it all
00:38 - we'll be doing is checking to see if a
00:40 - file
00:41 - exists someplace on our computer so
00:43 - we'll probably need a file to work with
00:45 - what i'm going to do is go to my desktop
00:47 - for convenience
00:48 - and just create a new text document i
00:50 - will call this test.txt
00:53 - now i probably need the file location so
00:55 - i'm going to copy that
00:57 - and then we can use this so let's create
01:00 - a variable called path
01:01 - that will include the path to the file
01:03 - that i would like to detect
01:05 - so that was test.txt now if you have
01:08 - backslashes in your file path you'll
01:11 - probably
01:12 - need double backslashes because that's
01:14 - the escape sequence for
01:15 - a backslash within a string so we now
01:18 - have
01:18 - this variable path that we can work with
01:21 - now i would like to check to see if
01:23 - this location exists on my computer so
01:26 - if
01:26 - os dot path dot exists
01:30 - and you can see that we can pass in our
01:32 - path as an argument
01:34 - so i will pass in my path and if this
01:36 - returns true if that location
01:38 - exists i will print that
01:42 - location exists
01:46 - so this will not tell me if this is a
01:48 - file or not
01:49 - we'll be covering that later else
01:52 - let's print that location
01:56 - doesn't exist
02:00 - alright so if this location exists this
02:02 - will return true
02:04 - if not this will execute our else
02:06 - statement
02:07 - that location exists so what if i were
02:10 - to delete this file
02:11 - and we run this program again that
02:14 - location
02:14 - doesn't exist now this won't tell you if
02:18 - the location you're dealing with is a
02:20 - file or not there is a separate
02:22 - function for that it is if
02:26 - os dot path dot
02:29 - is file
02:32 - what we'll do is pass in our path and
02:34 - print
02:37 - that is a file
02:40 - all right so let's create another file
02:43 - because i deleted the previous one
02:45 - test.txt it's in the same location let's
02:48 - run this again
02:49 - that location exists that is a file now
02:52 - what if this was a folder
02:54 - so i'm going to create a new folder i
02:56 - will call this folder
02:58 - i will delete my test document
03:01 - and let's change the location to folder
03:06 - that location exists but it is not a
03:08 - file you can check to see if a location
03:10 - is a directory so let's write an else if
03:13 - statement
03:14 - os dot path dot is
03:18 - directory and we will pass in our path
03:21 - and let's print that
03:25 - is a directory
03:29 - all right so we have our folder we're
03:30 - going to check to see
03:32 - if this location exists and if it's a
03:35 - file or a directory
03:37 - that location exists that is a directory
03:40 - well everyone
03:41 - that is the basics of file detection
03:43 - we'll be building upon this concept in
03:45 - future videos
03:46 - so if you would like a copy of this code
03:48 - i will post this in the comment section
03:50 - down below
03:51 - but yeah that is the basics of simple
03:53 - file detection
03:54 - using python

hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video we're going to be covering some basic file detection using python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you wouldn't mind please like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm welcome ladies and gentlemen to the beginning of a mini series involving doing stuff with files using python and in this video we're going to be doing some basic file detection and in order to do so i recommend importing the os module it's already included with the standard python library all you need to do is import it all we'll be doing is checking to see if a file exists someplace on our computer so we'll probably need a file to work with what i'm going to do is go to my desktop for convenience and just create a new text document i will call this test.txt now i probably need the file location so i'm going to copy that and then we can use this so let's create a variable called path that will include the path to the file that i would like to detect so that was test.txt now if you have backslashes in your file path you'll probably need double backslashes because that's the escape sequence for a backslash within a string so we now have this variable path that we can work with now i would like to check to see if this location exists on my computer so if os dot path dot exists and you can see that we can pass in our path as an argument so i will pass in my path and if this returns true if that location exists i will print that location exists so this will not tell me if this is a file or not we'll be covering that later else let's print that location doesn't exist alright so if this location exists this will return true if not this will execute our else statement that location exists so what if i were to delete this file and we run this program again that location doesn't exist now this won't tell you if the location you're dealing with is a file or not there is a separate function for that it is if os dot path dot is file what we'll do is pass in our path and print that is a file all right so let's create another file because i deleted the previous one test.txt it's in the same location let's run this again that location exists that is a file now what if this was a folder so i'm going to create a new folder i will call this folder i will delete my test document and let's change the location to folder that location exists but it is not a file you can check to see if a location is a directory so let's write an else if statement os dot path dot is directory and we will pass in our path and let's print that is a directory all right so we have our folder we're going to check to see if this location exists and if it's a file or a directory that location exists that is a directory well everyone that is the basics of file detection we'll be building upon this concept in future videos so if you would like a copy of this code i will post this in the comment section down below but yeah that is the basics of simple file detection using python
