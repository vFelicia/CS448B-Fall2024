00:01 - okay it looks like we're on constants
00:03 - constants
00:04 - are immutable values which are known at
00:07 - compile time
00:08 - and do not change for the life of a
00:10 - program let's say that we have a
00:12 - double variable named pi and this equals
00:15 - the first few digits of pi 3.14159
00:19 - if this is not a constant people can
00:21 - actually change
00:22 - the value contained within this variable
00:24 - and that could be a security concern
00:26 - let's say pi
00:27 - now equals 420 and then i will display
00:30 - the value contained within pi
00:32 - so if you do not want people to be able
00:34 - to change
00:35 - this value we can precede the data type
00:38 - of this variable with
00:39 - the const keyword and this variable is
00:42 - now a constant and we can't update this
00:44 - variable
00:45 - now that it's a constant so yeah that's
00:47 - a constant it's an immutable value which
00:49 - is known at compile time
00:51 - and does not change for the life of the
00:53 - program and it adds a little bit of
00:55 - security to our programs because people
00:57 - cannot later change
00:58 - these values so yeah those are constants
01:01 - in c
01:01 - sharp
