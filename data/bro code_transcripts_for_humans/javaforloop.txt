00:00 - hey how's it going everybody it's your
00:01 - bro hope you're doing well and in this
00:03 - video i'm going to teach you guys about
00:04 - for loops in java so
00:06 - sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:11 - you can become a hero and save our
00:13 - channel by smashing that like button
00:15 - drop a comment
00:16 - down below and subscribe if you'd like
00:17 - to become a fellow bro
00:20 - hey what's going on people let's talk
00:22 - about for loops a for loop
00:23 - executes a block of code a limited
00:26 - amount of times compared to a while loop
00:29 - a while loop
00:30 - could continue infinitely depending if
00:33 - its condition remains true
00:35 - with a for loop this will execute a
00:37 - limited amount of times
00:38 - so before we even begin the for loop we
00:41 - already know how many times
00:42 - that this for loop is going to iterate
00:45 - so let's create a program
00:46 - for an example that will count from 0 to
00:50 - 10.
00:50 - we can do this with a for loop so this
00:52 - is how to create a for loop
00:54 - type in the word for a set of
00:55 - parenthesis and then a set of curly
00:57 - braces
00:59 - so with our parentheses we add a
01:01 - condition
01:02 - along with two other statements so
01:04 - there's three parts to this for loop
01:06 - the first part is that we can declare a
01:09 - sort of counter or
01:10 - index so we will declare int index
01:14 - and we can set the sequel to zero and
01:16 - then add a semicolon
01:18 - so what a lot of people do is that they
01:20 - shorten index
01:21 - to i it's more shorthand
01:25 - with our second statement this is our
01:27 - condition
01:28 - we would like to continue this for loop
01:30 - as long as
01:31 - i is less than or equal to ten
01:34 - because we stated that for this program
01:36 - we would like to count from zero to ten
01:39 - now this third portion we will increment
01:43 - our counter i by one after each
01:46 - iteration
01:47 - so our for loop at least within the
01:49 - parentheses has
01:50 - three separate statements we declare
01:53 - a counter or index we call it i but it's
01:57 - not necessary that's just
01:58 - a common practice this is our condition
02:00 - we will iterate this for loop
02:02 - as long as this condition is true and
02:05 - then we can increment or decrement
02:07 - our index let's take a look at this how
02:10 - many times is this for loop going to
02:12 - iterate
02:13 - well it's going to iterate a total of 11
02:15 - times because
02:16 - we're counting zero as well so let's
02:18 - test this with a print line statement we
02:21 - will display
02:22 - our index of i so this will count from
02:25 - 0 to 10 and then stop
02:28 - so let's do the reverse now let's start
02:31 - at 10 and count down to 0 and then
02:33 - display a message such as
02:34 - happy new year so with our index let's
02:37 - set this to 10
02:39 - and change our condition to continue as
02:42 - long as
02:42 - i is greater than or equal to zero
02:45 - and then with our index we will
02:47 - decrement this by one
02:49 - and then when we exit the for loop let's
02:51 - display
02:53 - happy new year
02:56 - so we will start at 10 count down to
02:59 - zero
02:59 - and display happy new year now with
03:03 - this statement we could increment this
03:05 - or decrement this by more than one
03:08 - if we wanted to count down by two we
03:10 - would write this as
03:11 - i minus equals two
03:14 - so now this will execute a total of
03:17 - let's see one
03:18 - two three four five six times another
03:21 - way of writing this for loop that is
03:22 - optional
03:23 - is that you can move this third
03:24 - statement to within
03:26 - the for loop and this will work much the
03:28 - same as it did before it's just
03:30 - an optional way of writing this so
03:33 - that's what a for loop is
03:34 - it's similar to a while loop except that
03:37 - it will
03:38 - execute a limited amount of times
03:40 - compared to a while loop that could
03:42 - execute an
03:43 - infinite amount of times with for loops
03:45 - within the parentheses
03:47 - there are a total of three statements an
03:49 - index that you can declare
03:51 - a condition and then you can increment
03:53 - or decrement the index by a certain
03:56 - amount
03:56 - so that is for loops if you would like a
03:58 - copy of this code i will post this in
