00:01 - hey everybody in this video we're going
00:03 - to create a quiz game using c plus let's
00:06 - begin by creating an array of questions
00:08 - these will be of the string data type i
00:11 - will name this array
00:12 - questions
00:15 - and then let's think of some questions
00:17 - really add any questions that you want
00:18 - here's a few that come to mind for me
00:22 - what year was c plus plus
00:28 - created
00:30 - okay that is the first question i'll add
00:32 - an additional string
00:36 - question two
00:38 - who
00:39 - invented
00:40 - c plus plus
00:43 - third question
00:46 - what is the
00:49 - predecessor
00:54 - of c plus plus
00:58 - and i couldn't think of a fourth
00:59 - question so i'm gonna ask
01:02 - is the earth flat
01:04 - good enough with each question there
01:06 - will be four corresponding options i
01:09 - think a two dimensional array would be
01:11 - perfect for this
01:12 - this will be a two-dimensional array
01:16 - of strings
01:17 - named options
01:20 - we'll need to set the number of columns
01:22 - four columns is good
01:24 - this first array will be for the options
01:27 - for the first question
01:31 - a will be
01:32 - 1969
01:35 - b
01:37 - 1975
01:40 - c
01:42 - 1985 1985 is the correct answer
01:46 - d
01:47 - 1989
01:49 - now we have our next array who invented
01:51 - c plus
01:56 - guido
01:57 - van
01:58 - rossum
02:00 - he's the creator of python so that's not
02:02 - the correct answer
02:06 - yarn
02:10 - strow
02:13 - strip i'm sorry if i mispronounce your
02:15 - name dude hopefully you're not watching
02:16 - right now uh b is the correct answer in
02:18 - this case
02:20 - c
02:21 - john
02:23 - carmack
02:26 - d
02:28 - mark zuckerberg
02:34 - we're on question three
02:38 - what is the predecessor of c plus plus
02:41 - the correct answer is c
02:43 - that would be option a
02:49 - c plus
02:54 - c minus minus
03:00 - or b plus plus
03:03 - okay last question
03:05 - is the earth flat
03:09 - yes
03:13 - no
03:17 - sometimes
03:21 - what's earth
03:26 - all right then i just need to surround
03:28 - all of these arrays with another set of
03:29 - curly braces
03:32 - and there is our two-dimensional array
03:34 - named options to hold all of the options
03:37 - for our questions we'll need to create
03:39 - an answer key next this will be an array
03:41 - of characters
03:42 - answer
03:44 - key
03:45 - array
03:47 - equals
03:48 - here are the correct answers
03:51 - c
03:53 - b
03:57 - a
03:59 - then b
04:02 - 1985
04:04 - bjorn strosstrup
04:06 - c
04:07 - the language seed that is
04:09 - and no the earth is not flat i looked it
04:11 - up on wikipedia just now let's calculate
04:14 - the size of our questions how many
04:15 - questions do we have
04:17 - and
04:18 - size
04:19 - equals
04:20 - the size of
04:22 - our array of questions
04:24 - divided by the size of
04:27 - one of the elements
04:29 - questions at index
04:31 - zero
04:33 - we'll create a character to hold our
04:35 - guess
04:37 - and score to hold the score
04:41 - now we'll need to iterate over our
04:42 - questions
04:45 - for
04:46 - let me move down here
04:49 - and i equals zero we'll continue this as
04:53 - long as i is less than the size of our
04:56 - array the size of questions this would
04:58 - effectively be the amount of questions
05:00 - that we have
05:02 - then i'm going to increment i by one we
05:04 - will iterate once through all of the
05:06 - questions we have
05:10 - standard output
05:14 - let's access the string that's within
05:16 - questions at index i
05:20 - i'll add a new line
05:24 - just for some text decoration i'm going
05:26 - to add a bunch of asterisks before and
05:28 - after the question
05:31 - so let's get rid of this
05:34 - i think that'll look pretty cool
05:40 - there we go then we'll need to iterate
05:42 - over our 2d array
05:48 - we'll use an inner for loop for that
05:51 - we'll need a different index i is
05:53 - already taken let's pick j
05:55 - inch j equals zero we'll continue this
05:58 - as long as j
06:00 - is less than
06:02 - now we'll need to calculate how many
06:03 - elements are within each array
06:06 - so we can do that with
06:08 - size of
06:11 - our options array
06:13 - at index of i
06:17 - divided by the size of
06:20 - options and there's two indices here
06:24 - i
06:25 - then zero
06:27 - then we will increment j
06:30 - by one
06:31 - we will display our options standard
06:34 - output
06:35 - options there's two indices
06:38 - i
06:39 - then j
06:40 - i'll add a new line
06:45 - so if i were to run this this should
06:46 - display all of the questions and all of
06:49 - the options
06:53 - yeah here we are
06:54 - what year was c plus created who
06:56 - invented c plus plus
06:59 - what is the predecessor of c plus plus
07:01 - is the earth flat
07:03 - after all of the options are laid out we
07:05 - will accept some user input standard
07:08 - input
07:10 - we will place the user's input within
07:12 - guess
07:13 - then just in case the user types in
07:15 - something that's lowercase
07:17 - like a lowercase c we're looking for
07:19 - capital c
07:20 - so let's take the user's guess then make
07:22 - it uppercase guess
07:24 - equals
07:26 - to
07:27 - upper
07:28 - pass in guess
07:30 - so that will capitalize the character
07:32 - the user enters in
07:35 - then let's check to see if the user's
07:37 - guess is equal to the answer
07:40 - we'll need to access the answer key at
07:44 - index of i that's the current numbered
07:46 - question
07:47 - if those two values are the same
07:50 - we will display
07:52 - correct
07:53 - i'll add a new line
07:55 - then increment the user score score plus
07:58 - plus
08:00 - else the user's guess is not correct
08:03 - standard output
08:06 - wrong
08:08 - then we will display the correct answer
08:10 - standard output
08:14 - answer colon space
08:18 - we'll access the answer key at index of
08:21 - i
08:26 - then i'll add a new line
08:30 - okay let's try this so far
08:32 - what year was c plus created
08:35 - c
08:36 - who invented c plus plus that would be b
08:40 - what is the predecessor of c plus plus
08:43 - that is c the language c but it's option
08:46 - a
08:49 - is the earth flat
08:50 - what's earth d
08:53 - okay wrong answer b okay so we know that
08:56 - we can cycle through the questions
08:59 - outside of the for loop we will
09:00 - calculate the player score
09:02 - so right here i'll display the word
09:05 - results
09:06 - standard output
09:11 - results
09:13 - i'll add a new line
09:15 - actually now that i think of it i'm
09:16 - going to steal some of these text
09:18 - decorations
09:20 - let's make it look pretty
09:27 - something like this would look cool but
09:29 - not necessary
09:31 - standard
09:32 - output
09:36 - correct
09:37 - guesses
09:39 - then we will display the current score
09:43 - add a new line
09:47 - standard output
09:51 - number of
09:53 - questions
09:56 - that is simply the size of our array
10:00 - add a new line
10:03 - then we will calculate a percentage what
10:05 - percent of the questions did they get
10:07 - right
10:10 - score
10:14 - score divided by
10:16 - size
10:20 - times 100 then we'll add percent
10:27 - so at first this isn't going to work
10:28 - because we're using integer division but
10:30 - i'll explain that momentarily about
10:32 - typecasting
10:34 - so let's run this once
10:36 - let's say a
10:38 - b
10:38 - c
10:39 - d
10:40 - correct guesses one number of questions
10:43 - four our score was zero percent even
10:45 - though we got one right we'll need to
10:47 - add a cast to the divisor let's cast
10:50 - size as a double to hold that decimal
10:52 - portion
10:54 - then this should work
10:58 - a b
10:59 - c d
11:01 - correct guesses one number of questions
11:03 - four our score was 25 now let's go for a
11:06 - hundred
11:08 - remember that the correct answers are c
11:11 - b
11:11 - a b
11:13 - 1985 bjorn strosstrup
11:16 - the language c but that's option a
11:20 - is the earth flat
11:22 - no
11:22 - b
11:23 - correct guesses four number of questions
11:26 - four score 100
11:27 - well yeah everybody that is a quiz game
11:30 - you can make in c plus you can impress
11:32 - your friends or have your friends take
11:34 - the quiz you know you can change your
11:36 - questions around if you want if you
11:37 - would like a copy of this code i'll post
11:39 - this in the comment section down below
11:41 - and that is a quiz game written using c
11:44 - plus

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody in this video we're going to create a quiz game using c plus let's begin by creating an array of questions these will be of the string data type i will name this array questions and then let's think of some questions really add any questions that you want here's a few that come to mind for me what year was c plus plus created okay that is the first question i'll add an additional string question two who invented c plus plus third question what is the predecessor of c plus plus and i couldn't think of a fourth question so i'm gonna ask is the earth flat good enough with each question there will be four corresponding options i think a two dimensional array would be perfect for this this will be a twodimensional array of strings named options we'll need to set the number of columns four columns is good this first array will be for the options for the first question a will be 1969 b 1975 c 1985 1985 is the correct answer d 1989 now we have our next array who invented c plus guido van rossum he's the creator of python so that's not the correct answer yarn strow strip i'm sorry if i mispronounce your name dude hopefully you're not watching right now uh b is the correct answer in this case c john carmack d mark zuckerberg we're on question three what is the predecessor of c plus plus the correct answer is c that would be option a c plus c minus minus or b plus plus okay last question is the earth flat yes no sometimes what's earth all right then i just need to surround all of these arrays with another set of curly braces and there is our twodimensional array named options to hold all of the options for our questions we'll need to create an answer key next this will be an array of characters answer key array equals here are the correct answers c b a then b 1985 bjorn strosstrup c the language seed that is and no the earth is not flat i looked it up on wikipedia just now let's calculate the size of our questions how many questions do we have and size equals the size of our array of questions divided by the size of one of the elements questions at index zero we'll create a character to hold our guess and score to hold the score now we'll need to iterate over our questions for let me move down here and i equals zero we'll continue this as long as i is less than the size of our array the size of questions this would effectively be the amount of questions that we have then i'm going to increment i by one we will iterate once through all of the questions we have standard output let's access the string that's within questions at index i i'll add a new line just for some text decoration i'm going to add a bunch of asterisks before and after the question so let's get rid of this i think that'll look pretty cool there we go then we'll need to iterate over our 2d array we'll use an inner for loop for that we'll need a different index i is already taken let's pick j inch j equals zero we'll continue this as long as j is less than now we'll need to calculate how many elements are within each array so we can do that with size of our options array at index of i divided by the size of options and there's two indices here i then zero then we will increment j by one we will display our options standard output options there's two indices i then j i'll add a new line so if i were to run this this should display all of the questions and all of the options yeah here we are what year was c plus created who invented c plus plus what is the predecessor of c plus plus is the earth flat after all of the options are laid out we will accept some user input standard input we will place the user's input within guess then just in case the user types in something that's lowercase like a lowercase c we're looking for capital c so let's take the user's guess then make it uppercase guess equals to upper pass in guess so that will capitalize the character the user enters in then let's check to see if the user's guess is equal to the answer we'll need to access the answer key at index of i that's the current numbered question if those two values are the same we will display correct i'll add a new line then increment the user score score plus plus else the user's guess is not correct standard output wrong then we will display the correct answer standard output answer colon space we'll access the answer key at index of i then i'll add a new line okay let's try this so far what year was c plus created c who invented c plus plus that would be b what is the predecessor of c plus plus that is c the language c but it's option a is the earth flat what's earth d okay wrong answer b okay so we know that we can cycle through the questions outside of the for loop we will calculate the player score so right here i'll display the word results standard output results i'll add a new line actually now that i think of it i'm going to steal some of these text decorations let's make it look pretty something like this would look cool but not necessary standard output correct guesses then we will display the current score add a new line standard output number of questions that is simply the size of our array add a new line then we will calculate a percentage what percent of the questions did they get right score score divided by size times 100 then we'll add percent so at first this isn't going to work because we're using integer division but i'll explain that momentarily about typecasting so let's run this once let's say a b c d correct guesses one number of questions four our score was zero percent even though we got one right we'll need to add a cast to the divisor let's cast size as a double to hold that decimal portion then this should work a b c d correct guesses one number of questions four our score was 25 now let's go for a hundred remember that the correct answers are c b a b 1985 bjorn strosstrup the language c but that's option a is the earth flat no b correct guesses four number of questions four score 100 well yeah everybody that is a quiz game you can make in c plus you can impress your friends or have your friends take the quiz you know you can change your questions around if you want if you would like a copy of this code i'll post this in the comment section down below and that is a quiz game written using c plus
