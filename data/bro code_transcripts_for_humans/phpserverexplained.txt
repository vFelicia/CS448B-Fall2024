00:00 - hey everybody today we will be
00:01 - discussing the server super Global
00:04 - variable it contains headers paths and
00:07 - script locations it's an associative
00:09 - array that's created by the web server
00:11 - it contains nearly everything you need
00:14 - to know about the current web page
00:15 - environment to access the super Global
00:18 - variable you type dollar sign underscore
00:20 - server then you can access one of the
00:23 - key value pairs so for this
00:25 - demonstration I'm going to create a for
00:27 - each loop we're going to iterate over
00:30 - all of the pairs all of the key value
00:31 - pairs let's take our server
00:36 - as
00:38 - key Arrow value
00:42 - then I will Echo each key value pair
00:46 - key
00:48 - equals
00:50 - value
00:52 - then add a line break let's take a look
00:57 - all right we have a lot going on here
01:00 - here are the key value pairs found
01:03 - within my server super Global variable
01:05 - we're still beginners a lot of this is
01:07 - more for advanced PHP developers I more
01:11 - or less just want to raise awareness
01:12 - that this exists two keys that we're
01:15 - going to be interested in are PHP self
01:17 - and request method phpself is the
01:21 - location of this page the request method
01:24 - is either get or post the default is get
01:27 - if we have an HTML form that has the
01:30 - method set to post after clicking the
01:32 - submit button the request method would
01:34 - equal post let me demonstrate how we can
01:37 - use phpself
01:38 - I am going to create an HTML form
01:41 - let me get rid of this for each Loop
01:56 - the name of my PHP file is index.php the
02:00 - action attribute of my form is set to
02:02 - index.php
02:04 - any information that's posted will be
02:06 - sent to my PHP script
02:09 - however if I were to change the name of
02:11 - this file
02:13 - let's rename our file as home
02:17 - well our action attribute isn't going to
02:19 - be updated
02:20 - I'm going to navigate to our home page
02:25 - localhost.website slash home
02:28 - if I were to type in my name
02:30 - then press submit we're sending our form
02:33 - data to a file that doesn't exist it
02:36 - would be kind of nice if we could update
02:37 - this automatically that's where our
02:40 - server super Global variable can come in
02:42 - in place of a file name let's write a
02:45 - PHP script within the set of quotes
02:50 - we are going to access the server super
02:52 - Global variable at the Key of PHP
02:56 - underscore self this key contains the
02:59 - value of the current file path for this
03:01 - file save and reload everything you may
03:04 - need to navigate to our home page
03:06 - because right now it's set to index
03:11 - okay type in a username press submit and
03:14 - that should work then if we update the
03:16 - name of this file let's rename it to um
03:18 - start I guess that's all I could think
03:21 - of at the moment
03:22 - okay let's navigate to start
03:26 - .php
03:28 - type in a username press submit and that
03:31 - works just fine that's how we can use
03:33 - phpself to get the current file name
03:36 - however with phpself it is vulnerable to
03:39 - something called The cross-site Script
03:41 - we learned about cross-site scripts on
03:43 - the topic of Sanitation and validation
03:45 - if you do use phpself I do recommend
03:48 - enclosing this variable within a filter
03:49 - one that I recommend is HTML
03:53 - special
03:54 - chars
03:56 - so be sure to enclose that
04:00 - 'll avoid any cross-site scripts just be
04:02 - aware that this is something you might
04:04 - see in the future in your own studies at
04:06 - least you know what it is now the other
04:08 - key that we're going to talk about is
04:10 - request method request method is either
04:12 - get or post
04:14 - so if I were to reload everything but
04:16 - not submit anything
04:18 - the request method by default is get so
04:21 - another way to detect if a form is
04:23 - submitted is to access the request
04:25 - method normally we're used to saying if
04:28 - is set
04:29 - then access post
04:32 - then we access our submit button
04:34 - one problem with this is that at least
04:37 - in older web browsers you can submit a
04:40 - form without hitting the submit button
04:41 - there's ways around that a more reliable
04:44 - solution is to take a look at that
04:45 - request method within an if statement
04:48 - let's access our server super Global
04:51 - variable we will take a look at our
04:54 - request method
04:56 - and see if this is equal to post if it
05:01 - is then let's Echo I don't know hello
05:06 - type in a username it doesn't really
05:08 - matter I guess hit submit
05:11 - and we will display hello in the future
05:13 - I would prefer if we stuck with this way
05:15 - of handling post requests just because
05:17 - it's more reliable alright everybody so
05:20 - that's a basic introduction to the
05:22 - server super Global variable they're
05:24 - still way more advanced stuff involving
05:26 - it but I thought I'll at least give you
05:27 - an introduction just so that it doesn't
05:29 - freak you out in the future we'll have a
05:31 - little bit more practice with this when
05:32 - we create our own login form and well
05:34 - everybody that is the server super
05:36 - Global variable in PHP

hey everybody today we will be discussing the server super Global variable it contains headers paths and script locations it's an associative array that's created by the web server it contains nearly everything you need to know about the current web page environment to access the super Global variable you type dollar sign underscore server then you can access one of the key value pairs so for this demonstration I'm going to create a for each loop we're going to iterate over all of the pairs all of the key value pairs let's take our server as key Arrow value then I will Echo each key value pair key equals value then add a line break let's take a look all right we have a lot going on here here are the key value pairs found within my server super Global variable we're still beginners a lot of this is more for advanced PHP developers I more or less just want to raise awareness that this exists two keys that we're going to be interested in are PHP self and request method phpself is the location of this page the request method is either get or post the default is get if we have an HTML form that has the method set to post after clicking the submit button the request method would equal post let me demonstrate how we can use phpself I am going to create an HTML form let me get rid of this for each Loop the name of my PHP file is index.php the action attribute of my form is set to index.php any information that's posted will be sent to my PHP script however if I were to change the name of this file let's rename our file as home well our action attribute isn't going to be updated I'm going to navigate to our home page localhost.website slash home if I were to type in my name then press submit we're sending our form data to a file that doesn't exist it would be kind of nice if we could update this automatically that's where our server super Global variable can come in in place of a file name let's write a PHP script within the set of quotes we are going to access the server super Global variable at the Key of PHP underscore self this key contains the value of the current file path for this file save and reload everything you may need to navigate to our home page because right now it's set to index okay type in a username press submit and that should work then if we update the name of this file let's rename it to um start I guess that's all I could think of at the moment okay let's navigate to start .php type in a username press submit and that works just fine that's how we can use phpself to get the current file name however with phpself it is vulnerable to something called The crosssite Script we learned about crosssite scripts on the topic of Sanitation and validation if you do use phpself I do recommend enclosing this variable within a filter one that I recommend is HTML special chars so be sure to enclose that 'll avoid any crosssite scripts just be aware that this is something you might see in the future in your own studies at least you know what it is now the other key that we're going to talk about is request method request method is either get or post so if I were to reload everything but not submit anything the request method by default is get so another way to detect if a form is submitted is to access the request method normally we're used to saying if is set then access post then we access our submit button one problem with this is that at least in older web browsers you can submit a form without hitting the submit button there's ways around that a more reliable solution is to take a look at that request method within an if statement let's access our server super Global variable we will take a look at our request method and see if this is equal to post if it is then let's Echo I don't know hello type in a username it doesn't really matter I guess hit submit and we will display hello in the future I would prefer if we stuck with this way of handling post requests just because it's more reliable alright everybody so that's a basic introduction to the server super Global variable they're still way more advanced stuff involving it but I thought I'll at least give you an introduction just so that it doesn't freak you out in the future we'll have a little bit more practice with this when we create our own login form and well everybody that is the server super Global variable in PHP
