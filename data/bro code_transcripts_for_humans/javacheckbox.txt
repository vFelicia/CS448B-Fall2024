00:00 - what's going on everybody it's your bro
00:02 - here hope you're doing well and in this
00:03 - video i'm going to teach you guys how we
00:04 - can create a simple checkbox in java so
00:07 - sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:11 - if you find this video helpful please
00:12 - remember to like
00:14 - comment and subscribe your support will
00:16 - help keep this channel running
00:18 - all right everyone we're going to be
00:20 - creating a j check box
00:21 - this is a gui component that can be
00:23 - selected or deselected
00:25 - so let me give you a rundown of my setup
00:28 - that i have we covered this in the last
00:29 - video
00:30 - so we have two classes a main class it
00:33 - doesn't really matter what you call it
00:34 - as long as it contains a main method
00:36 - we're going to create a new instance of
00:39 - my frame
00:40 - so my frame will extends jframe so it
00:43 - behaves exactly like a j frame
00:45 - but it also implements an action
00:47 - listener interface
00:49 - within the constructor of my frame i
00:51 - have this dot set default close
00:53 - operation
00:54 - jframe exit on close we're using a flow
00:57 - layout
00:58 - manager we're going to pack this frame
01:00 - and set the visibility to true
01:01 - and then we'll also need an action
01:03 - performed method so we can listen for
01:05 - events
01:06 - all right once you have all that we're
01:07 - ready to begin this is how to create a j
01:10 - check box
01:10 - so within the constructor for now i'm
01:13 - just going to declare a j
01:14 - check box j check
01:18 - box and we will call this check box
01:22 - equals new j check box
01:28 - we'll probably need an import so include
01:30 - that
01:32 - and then i'm adding this checkbox to the
01:33 - frame so before we pack this
01:35 - this dot add the name of your checkbox
01:41 - and this is what we have so far
01:45 - just a simple selectable checkbox but
01:47 - we'll probably want to add some text
01:49 - we don't know what we're selecting
01:51 - exactly
01:52 - so after we create this checkbox let's
01:54 - set the text
01:55 - you can either pass this into the
01:56 - constructor or we can use the set text
01:59 - method
02:00 - so check box dot
02:03 - set text
02:06 - and we'll place some sample text like
02:10 - i'm not a robot
02:13 - seriously guys i'm not and this is what
02:16 - we have now
02:18 - i'm not a robot last time i checked i
02:22 - wasn't
02:23 - so there's this annoying border around
02:25 - the text we can get rid of that
02:27 - you have to set focusable to false
02:31 - check box dot set focusable
02:36 - and that will take care of that issue
02:39 - so this text is somewhat small and
02:41 - difficult to read we can actually change
02:43 - the font too
02:45 - check box dot set font
02:49 - new font and pass in whatever font you
02:51 - want you can copy me if you want
02:54 - so console us font plain
02:58 - and then a size 35 is good
03:02 - but doesn't matter what you pick
03:06 - that's a little bit easier to read so
03:09 - what can we do with this let's create a
03:11 - button and when we click on this button
03:13 - it's going to tell us if this is
03:14 - selected or not
03:16 - so let's create a button before this
03:18 - checkbox so that's a j button we'll call
03:20 - this button
03:21 - equals new j button
03:26 - and we'll need an import as well and
03:29 - let's set some text you can either pass
03:31 - this into
03:32 - the constructor a string or we can use
03:34 - the set text method so button.set
03:37 - text and i will set this to submit
03:42 - we're also going to need to add an
03:44 - action listener so button
03:46 - dot add action listener since we're
03:48 - implementing an
03:49 - action listener interface we can simply
03:51 - just pass in
03:52 - this alright so we have an action
03:56 - listener
03:57 - that's attached to this button when we
03:59 - click on the button
04:01 - it's going to trigger this action
04:02 - performed method so
04:04 - we need to check to see if the event
04:06 - that happens
04:07 - is equal to the button so if e dot get
04:10 - source is equal to
04:14 - our button now let's take a look at this
04:17 - button
04:18 - this button is not recognized or this
04:21 - action performed method does not
04:22 - recognize this button
04:24 - that's because we declared this button
04:26 - within the constructor
04:27 - so we should make this global by
04:29 - declaring this outside of the
04:30 - constructor because right now it's only
04:32 - local to everything
04:33 - within our constructor so i'm going to
04:36 - copy this portion
04:38 - paste it and we do not need to declare
04:40 - this twice
04:42 - so at the top j button button then
04:44 - button equals new j button
04:46 - so then our action performed method now
04:48 - recognizes
04:49 - this button and we'll need to do the
04:51 - same thing with our checkbox
04:56 - so check box equals new checkbox now
04:59 - we're going to determine to see
05:01 - if this checkbox is selected so there's
05:04 - a function to do that
05:05 - check box dot is
05:08 - selected and this is going to return
05:11 - true
05:12 - or false for now i'll just print this so
05:15 - system.out.printline
05:16 - and we're going to print the result you
05:18 - can also assign this to a variable too
05:20 - that would work as well and let's try
05:22 - this
05:26 - i'm not a robot oh we need to add the
05:29 - button
05:29 - crap let's do that so this
05:32 - dot add button i sometimes forget to add
05:37 - components you will too probably
05:40 - alright i'm not a robot cool
05:43 - this says i am not a robot
05:47 - now i am a robot now i'm not
05:51 - now i am so did you guys know you can
05:53 - actually change the appearance of this
05:55 - checkbox we can set this to an image
05:58 - so i have a few images that i want to
06:00 - use
06:01 - this picture of an x i just called this
06:03 - x.png
06:05 - and a picture of a green check mark so i
06:08 - want to
06:08 - change the check box to these images
06:11 - when the check box
06:13 - is deselected or selected so i'm just
06:16 - going to create some image icons
06:17 - feel free to pause the video if you want
06:19 - to look for some icons that you want to
06:20 - use
06:21 - so image icon i will call the x icon
06:25 - just
06:26 - x icon and then we have another
06:30 - image icon and i will call this check
06:34 - icon and then i will finish
06:37 - instantiating this within
06:38 - our constructor right here is good i
06:41 - suppose
06:43 - all right so x icon
06:46 - equals new image
06:49 - icon and we list where this is located
06:52 - since this is within my project folder i
06:54 - can just list the name
06:57 - so that is x dot png
07:00 - and i'll do the same thing for my check
07:02 - mark
07:04 - icon here so that is check icon
07:09 - and the name is checkmark.png
07:14 - to add an icon to a checkbox when it's
07:17 - deselected you type in
07:18 - the name of the checkbox and we use the
07:22 - dot set icon method and we pass
07:25 - in an icon that we want to use we want
07:28 - to use this
07:28 - x icon which is the red x that we have
07:34 - and this is our icon however if we were
07:37 - to click on this it doesn't appear to do
07:38 - anything
07:39 - even though we can toggle this between
07:41 - checked and unchecked
07:42 - selected or deselected so we're also
07:46 - going to combine this
07:47 - with set selected icon so check
07:51 - box dot set
07:54 - selected icon and i'm going to use my
07:57 - check
07:58 - icon
08:02 - and then now when we run this we can
08:04 - actually change the image when we select
08:07 - this checkbox alright so that's the
08:10 - basics of creating a
08:12 - simple checkbox in java if you want a
08:14 - copy of all this code
08:15 - i'll post all of this in the comments
08:16 - down below but yeah that's the basics of
08:19 - creating a check box in java
08:21 - hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you
08:24 - learn something new
08:25 - then you can help me help you in three
08:28 - easy steps
08:29 - by smashing that like button drop a

forget to add components you will too probably alright i'm not a robot cool this says i am not a robot now i am a robot now i'm not now i am so did you guys know you can actually change the appearance of this checkbox we can set this to an image so i have a few images that i want to use this picture of an x i just called this x.png and a picture of a green check mark so i want to change the check
