00:00 - hey how's it going everybody it's you
00:01 - bro hope you're doing well and in this
00:03 - video we're going to discuss
00:04 - the three logical operators the and the
00:07 - or
00:08 - and the not logical operators so sit
00:10 - back
00:11 - relax and enjoy the show
00:15 - if you find this video helpful please
00:16 - remember to like
00:18 - comment and subscribe your support will
00:20 - help keep this channel running
00:22 - all right everybody let's discuss
00:24 - logical operators these can be used to
00:26 - connect
00:27 - two or more expressions and there are
00:30 - currently three that i'm going to
00:31 - discuss
00:32 - the and logical operator which is two
00:34 - ampersands
00:36 - the or logical operator which is two
00:39 - straight bars
00:40 - and lastly the not logical operator
00:42 - which is an exclamation point
00:44 - let's begin with the and logical
00:46 - operator we can check to see
00:48 - if two or more conditions are true
00:51 - if both conditions are true an entire
00:53 - statement will evaluate to be true
00:56 - here's an example let's say we have an
00:58 - integer
00:59 - called temperature temp for short and
01:01 - we'll set this to
01:03 - 25 degrees celsius let's write
01:06 - an if-else if statement to check to see
01:09 - what the temperature is
01:10 - and display a message based on the
01:12 - result so let's check to see if
01:14 - our temp is greater than 35
01:18 - actually let's make that 30. if temp is
01:20 - greater than 30 then we will display
01:22 - it is hot outside
01:26 - so how can we check to see if our
01:28 - temperature is within a certain range
01:30 - well we could use the and logical
01:32 - operator to do so
01:34 - next let's write an else if statement
01:36 - and this time we're going to have
01:38 - two conditions not just one so first
01:40 - we'll check to see
01:41 - if our temp is greater than or
01:45 - equal to let's say 20.
01:48 - and we would like to check to see if our
01:50 - temp
01:51 - is less than or equal to
01:55 - 30. so in order for this statement to be
01:59 - true
02:00 - both conditions must be true that's why
02:02 - we're using the and logical operator
02:04 - this side as well as this side both of
02:07 - these conditions
02:08 - need to be true for this entire
02:10 - statement to evaluate as true
02:13 - so if our temperature falls within this
02:15 - range
02:16 - let's display a message it
02:20 - is warm outside
02:24 - and then else it's cold outside
02:28 - system that outside print line it is
02:30 - cold outside
02:32 - and let's try it so currently our
02:34 - temperature is 25
02:36 - and when we run this it displays it's
02:38 - warm outside
02:39 - if our temperature was 35
02:43 - then it's going to display it is hot
02:44 - outside if it's less than
02:47 - 20 well then this portion is going to
02:50 - evaluate to be false
02:51 - but this portion will evaluate to be
02:53 - true so therefore
02:55 - this entire statement will be false then
02:57 - since both conditions must be true
02:59 - so if our temperature is 15 which is
03:01 - cold it's going to display it is cold
03:04 - outside
03:05 - that is the and logical operator for a
03:08 - statement
03:08 - to be true both conditions must be true
03:12 - next up to bet we have the or logical
03:14 - operator
03:15 - this will check to see if one or more
03:18 - conditions
03:19 - is true if at least one of the
03:21 - conditions is true then the entire
03:22 - statement
03:23 - is true then so do you remember those
03:25 - old computer games like
03:27 - oregon trail where you usually had to
03:29 - type q
03:30 - to quit the game well let's replicate
03:32 - something like that via a scanner
03:34 - so let's accept some user input scanner
03:37 - scanner
03:37 - equals new scanner within the
03:39 - parenthesis
03:40 - system.in and we will need an import
03:44 - import java.util.scanner
03:47 - so we will ask the user if they want to
03:50 - quit the game
03:51 - and in order to do so you have to press
03:53 - either
03:54 - lowercase q or uppercase q but we'll
03:57 - need a prompt first
03:59 - you are playing a game
04:02 - press lowercase q or uppercase q
04:06 - to quit and we will store
04:10 - our answer within a variable
04:14 - let's call this response string response
04:18 - equals scanner dot next
04:22 - next we'll store the next key that you
04:24 - press within
04:26 - a variable a string variable so let's
04:29 - check to see
04:30 - if our response is equal to lowercase q
04:34 - or uppercase q if
04:38 - then within the condition of the if
04:40 - statement
04:42 - our response and with strings to check
04:45 - to see if two strings are equal you need
04:47 - to use the
04:48 - equals method it's a little bit
04:50 - different with strings if our response
04:52 - is equal to lowercase q
04:54 - we're going to use the or logical
04:55 - operator if our response
04:58 - is equal to uppercase q
05:02 - then that means the user wants to quit
05:04 - the game
05:06 - you quit the game else
05:09 - they still want to play the game so
05:11 - we'll print a different message
05:13 - you are still playing the game
05:18 - puke you and let's test this
05:23 - you are playing a game press q or q to
05:25 - quit
05:26 - so i'm just going to type no and it says
05:29 - you are still playing the game
05:31 - but you know what this game is kind of
05:33 - lame so i'm going to press lowercase q
05:35 - to quit
05:35 - it states you quit the game on the other
05:38 - hand i could have pressed
05:39 - uppercase q to quit the game so let's
05:42 - try that
05:43 - uppercase q you quit the game so with
05:46 - the orological operator as long as
05:49 - one of these conditions is true then
05:51 - this entire
05:52 - statement will evaluate to be true and
05:55 - last but not least we have the not
05:58 - logical operator which is represented by
06:00 - an exclamation point this will reverse
06:03 - the boolean
06:04 - value of a condition so using
06:07 - the not logical operator we could make
06:10 - some changes
06:11 - to how our program is written so if we
06:14 - precede
06:15 - these conditions with the not logical
06:18 - operator
06:18 - this will reverse the boolean value that
06:21 - these
06:21 - evaluate too so we're checking to see
06:25 - if our response is not equal to q
06:29 - or our response is not equal to
06:32 - uppercase q
06:34 - and then we should probably change this
06:37 - middle
06:37 - logical operator to be and so if our
06:40 - response
06:41 - does not equal lowercase q and
06:44 - our response does not equal uppercase q
06:48 - then that means this person this user
06:51 - still wants to play the game else
06:54 - they are going to quit the game so this
06:56 - will work much the same
06:58 - you are playing a game press q or q to
07:00 - quit no because this is a fun game
07:02 - on second thought this game is in fact
07:04 - kind of lame so i'm going to press
07:06 - q to quit the game you quit the game
07:09 - so that is what the not logical operator
07:12 - is if you precede something with the
07:14 - not logical operator it's going to
07:16 - reverse the boolean value
07:18 - based on what it's going to resolve to
07:21 - so in this case
07:22 - we check to see if our response does not
07:25 - equal
07:26 - lowercase q and our response does not
07:29 - equal
07:30 - uppercase q then this person still wants
07:32 - to play the game
07:33 - else they're going to quit the game so
07:35 - those are the three
07:37 - logical operators the and logical
07:39 - operator
07:40 - the or logical operator as well as the
07:43 - not logical operator
07:44 - if you would like a copy of all this
07:46 - code i will post everything in the

hey how's it going everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video we're going to discuss the three logical operators the and the or and the not logical operators so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running all right everybody let's discuss logical operators these can be used to connect two or more expressions and there are currently three that i'm going to discuss the and logical operator which is two ampersands the or logical operator which is two straight bars and lastly the not logical operator which is an exclamation point let's begin with the and logical operator we can check to see if two or more conditions are true if both conditions are true an entire statement will evaluate to be true here's an example let's say we have an integer called temperature temp for short and we'll set this to 25 degrees celsius let's write an ifelse if statement to check to see what the temperature is and display a message based on the result so let's check to see if our temp is greater than 35 actually let's make that 30. if temp is greater than 30 then we will display it is hot outside so how can we check to see if our temperature is within a certain range well we could use the and logical operator to do so next let's write an else if statement and this time we're going to have two conditions not just one so first we'll check to see if our temp is greater than or equal to let's say 20. and we would like to check to see if our temp is less than or equal to 30. so in order for this statement to be true both conditions must be true that's why we're using the and logical operator this side as well as this side both of these conditions need to be true for this entire statement to evaluate as true so if our temperature falls within this range let's display a message it is warm outside and then else it's cold outside system that outside print line it is cold outside and let's try it so currently our temperature is 25 and when we run this it displays it's warm outside if our temperature was 35 then it's going to display it is hot outside if it's less than 20 well then this portion is going to evaluate to be false but this portion will evaluate to be true so therefore this entire statement will be false then since both conditions must be true so if our temperature is 15 which is cold it's going to display it is cold outside that is the and logical operator for a statement to be true both conditions must be true next up to bet we have the or logical operator this will check to see if one or more conditions is true if at least one of the conditions is true then the entire statement is true then so do you remember those old computer games like oregon trail where you usually had to type q to quit the game well let's replicate something like that via a scanner so let's accept some user input scanner scanner equals new scanner within the parenthesis system.in and we will need an import import java.util.scanner so we will ask the user if they want to quit the game and in order to do so you have to press either lowercase q or uppercase q but we'll need a prompt first you are playing a game press lowercase q or uppercase q to quit and we will store our answer within a variable let's call this response string response equals scanner dot next next we'll store the next key that you press within a variable a string variable so let's check to see if our response is equal to lowercase q or uppercase q if then within the condition of the if statement our response and with strings to check to see if two strings are equal you need to use the equals method it's a little bit different with strings if our response is equal to lowercase q we're going to use the or logical operator if our response is equal to uppercase q then that means the user wants to quit the game you quit the game else they still want to play the game so we'll print a different message you are still playing the game puke you and let's test this you are playing a game press q or q to quit so i'm just going to type no and it says you are still playing the game but you know what this game is kind of lame so i'm going to press lowercase q to quit it states you quit the game on the other hand i could have pressed uppercase q to quit the game so let's try that uppercase q you quit the game so with the orological operator as long as one of these conditions is true then this entire statement will evaluate to be true and last but not least we have the not logical operator which is represented by an exclamation point this will reverse the boolean value of a condition so using the not logical operator we could make some changes to how our program is written so if we precede these conditions with the not logical operator this will reverse the boolean value that these evaluate too so we're checking to see if our response is not equal to q or our response is not equal to uppercase q and then we should probably change this middle logical operator to be and so if our response does not equal lowercase q and our response does not equal uppercase q then that means this person this user still wants to play the game else they are going to quit the game so this will work much the same you are playing a game press q or q to quit no because this is a fun game on second thought this game is in fact kind of lame so i'm going to press q to quit the game you quit the game so that is what the not logical operator is if you precede something with the not logical operator it's going to reverse the boolean value based on what it's going to resolve to so in this case we check to see if our response does not equal lowercase q and our response does not equal uppercase q then this person still wants to play the game else they're going to quit the game so those are the three logical operators the and logical operator the or logical operator as well as the not logical operator if you would like a copy of all this code i will post everything in the comments down below please be sure to do me a favor and smash that like
