00:00 - well hello again everybody it's me in
00:03 - today's topic I'm going to show you how
00:04 - we can generate some random numbers in
00:06 - Python then at the end of this video as
00:08 - an exercise we're going to create a
00:10 - number guessing program let's begin we
00:13 - will be importing the random module type
00:15 - import random
00:18 - the random module gives us access to a
00:20 - lot of useful methods involving random
00:22 - numbers for a comprehensive list you can
00:25 - use the help function pass in the random
00:28 - module
00:29 - and then we would want to print this
00:34 - here's what we all have access to
00:36 - we have a shuffle method set state
00:39 - seed
00:41 - sample random range random random inch
00:44 - random bytes and there's a ton of others
00:47 - but we'll discuss a few of the more
00:48 - useful methods for beginners for a
00:50 - random whole integer maybe you're
00:53 - rolling a six-sided dice you would type
00:55 - the name of the random module dot that a
00:58 - method for a random whole integer type
01:00 - Rand int add a set of parentheses within
01:05 - the set of parentheses you will list a
01:06 - range if I'm rolling a six-sided dice I
01:10 - would like the numbers one through six
01:11 - one comma six
01:14 - then I will assign what is returned to
01:16 - maybe a variable
01:18 - print whatever my number is
01:23 - my random number is a four
01:26 - three one four all right I tend to play
01:29 - a lot of Dungeons and Dragons we use
01:32 - polyhedral dice that have more or less
01:35 - than six sides there is a 20-sided dice
01:37 - for a random number between 1 and 20 I
01:40 - would set the range to be one comma 20.
01:44 - here I rolled a 16.
01:46 - and a seven and an eight within the Rand
01:49 - int method you can place variables as
01:51 - well as long as they contain numbers
01:54 - I will create a variable named low I'll
01:56 - set that equal to one
01:58 - and a variable named High I will set
02:01 - that to be 100.
02:03 - I will replace the numbers with my
02:05 - variables that behave as numbers
02:08 - give me a random integer between my low
02:11 - variable and high variable so between 1
02:13 - and 100 in this example I have rolled a
02:16 - 75.
02:18 - now in 88 if you need a random floating
02:20 - Point number you can use the random
02:22 - method random dot random
02:26 - then let's assign this to a variable
02:29 - number equals the random method of the
02:32 - random module
02:33 - that would return a random floating
02:35 - Point number between 0 and 1.
02:39 - you can pick a random Choice from a
02:41 - sequence
02:42 - in the future we're going to create a
02:43 - game of rock paper scissors
02:45 - let's say we have a tuple of options
02:49 - options equals
02:52 - Rock
02:54 - paper
02:57 - scissors
02:59 - we are accessing the random module dot
03:01 - then use the choice method
03:04 - place your sequence within the choice
03:06 - method
03:07 - give me a random Choice from options
03:11 - I will store this within a variable
03:12 - let's say option equals random Choice
03:16 - from my options then I will print the
03:20 - option
03:21 - our computer has generated scissors
03:23 - paper
03:25 - Rock
03:26 - so the choice method is a great use for
03:29 - games if you ever need a random element
03:32 - now there's also Shuffle
03:34 - this time maybe we have a deck of cards
03:37 - cards equals I guess I'll use a list
03:39 - this time
03:50 - I have a list of cards that you would
03:52 - normally find within a deck of playing
03:54 - cards well besides the suit two through
03:57 - ten Jack queen king Ace
04:00 - using the shuffle method I can Shuffle
04:02 - this sequence
04:04 - access the random module dot Shuffle
04:07 - pass in your sequence
04:10 - in my case it's cards then I will print
04:12 - cards
04:14 - yeah look at that
04:16 - my cards are now shuffled in the future
04:18 - we'll be creating a game of blackjack
04:20 - the shuffle method will be used then to
04:23 - shuffle our deck of cards those are a
04:25 - few methods found within the random
04:27 - module for some practice let's create a
04:29 - number guessing game as an exercise
04:32 - a user has to guess a number between a
04:34 - certain range
04:37 - maybe between 1 and 100 I'll set low to
04:40 - be one
04:41 - High to be 100
04:45 - guesses set to zero
04:48 - then we will generate a random number
04:51 - equals random
04:54 - dot Rand int
04:57 - the range is between our variables low
05:00 - and high
05:03 - we'll create a while loop while true
05:07 - while the user guesses the wrong number
05:09 - we'll have to continue the while loop we
05:12 - only Escape when they get the right
05:13 - number but we'll give them a hint
05:16 - so guess
05:18 - equals
05:20 - input I'll use an F string
05:23 - enter a number between
05:29 - low
05:32 - through
05:34 - High
05:38 - I'm going to surround this with a set of
05:39 - parentheses
05:41 - then I'm going to Typecast our input as
05:44 - an integer
05:46 - after making one guess I will increment
05:49 - our guesses variable by one guesses plus
05:52 - equals one
05:56 - now if our guess is less than our number
06:02 - let's print
06:04 - using an F string
06:09 - guess is too low
06:15 - else if gas is greater than our number
06:20 - we will print
06:22 - I'm just going to copy this
06:24 - is to hi
06:28 - then else
06:31 - if our guess is not lower than the
06:33 - number and our guess is not higher than
06:35 - the number well then our guess must
06:38 - equal the number that means we got the
06:40 - number right
06:41 - then I will print
06:47 - guess is correct
06:51 - then we will break
06:53 - so when we escape the while loop
06:57 - let's print the number of guesses it
06:58 - took to get the right number
07:01 - I'll use an upstring
07:02 - this round took you
07:06 - our guesses variable
07:08 - then the word guesses
07:11 - that should complete our program let's
07:12 - try it
07:14 - enter a number between 1 and 100 I'll
07:16 - guess something right in the middle 50.
07:19 - 50 is too high okay so our number is
07:21 - between 1 and 50.
07:23 - I'll guess something in the middle of
07:25 - that range maybe 25 25 is still too high
07:29 - 12.
07:30 - 12 is too high
07:32 - six
07:33 - is too low okay we know our number is
07:35 - between 6 and 12.
07:38 - nine
07:39 - nine is correct this round took you five
07:42 - guesses well okay then everybody
07:45 - that is how to work with random numbers
07:47 - in Python and hopefully you gained a
07:49 - little bit of experience working with
07:51 - random numbers with this number guessing
07:52 - game we'll be utilizing random numbers
07:54 - for a lot of games in the future and
07:56 - well yeah that's how to work with random
07:58 - numbers in Python

well hello again everybody it's me in today's topic I'm going to show you how we can generate some random numbers in Python then at the end of this video as an exercise we're going to create a number guessing program let's begin we will be importing the random module type import random the random module gives us access to a lot of useful methods involving random numbers for a comprehensive list you can use the help function pass in the random module and then we would want to print this here's what we all have access to we have a shuffle method set state seed sample random range random random inch random bytes and there's a ton of others but we'll discuss a few of the more useful methods for beginners for a random whole integer maybe you're rolling a sixsided dice you would type the name of the random module dot that a method for a random whole integer type Rand int add a set of parentheses within the set of parentheses you will list a range if I'm rolling a sixsided dice I would like the numbers one through six one comma six then I will assign what is returned to maybe a variable print whatever my number is my random number is a four three one four all right I tend to play a lot of Dungeons and Dragons we use polyhedral dice that have more or less than six sides there is a 20sided dice for a random number between 1 and 20 I would set the range to be one comma 20. here I rolled a 16. and a seven and an eight within the Rand int method you can place variables as well as long as they contain numbers I will create a variable named low I'll set that equal to one and a variable named High I will set that to be 100. I will replace the numbers with my variables that behave as numbers give me a random integer between my low variable and high variable so between 1 and 100 in this example I have rolled a 75. now in 88 if you need a random floating Point number you can use the random method random dot random then let's assign this to a variable number equals the random method of the random module that would return a random floating Point number between 0 and 1. you can pick a random Choice from a sequence in the future we're going to create a game of rock paper scissors let's say we have a tuple of options options equals Rock paper scissors we are accessing the random module dot then use the choice method place your sequence within the choice method give me a random Choice from options I will store this within a variable let's say option equals random Choice from my options then I will print the option our computer has generated scissors paper Rock so the choice method is a great use for games if you ever need a random element now there's also Shuffle this time maybe we have a deck of cards cards equals I guess I'll use a list this time I have a list of cards that you would normally find within a deck of playing cards well besides the suit two through ten Jack queen king Ace using the shuffle method I can Shuffle this sequence access the random module dot Shuffle pass in your sequence in my case it's cards then I will print cards yeah look at that my cards are now shuffled in the future we'll be creating a game of blackjack the shuffle method will be used then to shuffle our deck of cards those are a few methods found within the random module for some practice let's create a number guessing game as an exercise a user has to guess a number between a certain range maybe between 1 and 100 I'll set low to be one High to be 100 guesses set to zero then we will generate a random number equals random dot Rand int the range is between our variables low and high we'll create a while loop while true while the user guesses the wrong number we'll have to continue the while loop we only Escape when they get the right number but we'll give them a hint so guess equals input I'll use an F string enter a number between low through High I'm going to surround this with a set of parentheses then I'm going to Typecast our input as an integer after making one guess I will increment our guesses variable by one guesses plus equals one now if our guess is less than our number let's print using an F string guess is too low else if gas is greater than our number we will print I'm just going to copy this is to hi then else if our guess is not lower than the number and our guess is not higher than the number well then our guess must equal the number that means we got the number right then I will print guess is correct then we will break so when we escape the while loop let's print the number of guesses it took to get the right number I'll use an upstring this round took you our guesses variable then the word guesses that should complete our program let's try it enter a number between 1 and 100 I'll guess something right in the middle 50. 50 is too high okay so our number is between 1 and 50. I'll guess something in the middle of that range maybe 25 25 is still too high 12. 12 is too high six is too low okay we know our number is between 6 and 12. nine nine is correct this round took you five guesses well okay then everybody that is how to work with random numbers in Python and hopefully you gained a little bit of experience working with random numbers with this number guessing game we'll be utilizing random numbers for a lot of games in the future and well yeah that's how to work with random numbers in Python
