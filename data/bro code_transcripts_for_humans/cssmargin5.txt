00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's bro
00:01 - here hope you're doing well
00:03 - and in this video i'm going to be
00:04 - teaching you guys about margins in css
00:07 - so let's get into it
00:10 - well let's begin with margins margins
00:12 - are used to create space
00:14 - around an element and it can be easy to
00:16 - mix up margins with padding because they
00:18 - both perform a similar task
00:20 - so to begin let's add some sample text
00:23 - to our web page
00:24 - let's create a heading i'll use an h1
00:26 - heading and i will write down
00:29 - margin demo and let's close this
00:33 - and we'll probably want a sample
00:34 - paragraph if you're using sublime text
00:36 - you can just type in lorem
00:38 - hit tab and i'm going to surround this
00:40 - with a pair of paragraph tags
00:42 - so we need an opening paragraph tag and
00:45 - a closing paragraph tag
00:46 - i'm also going to give this paragraph
00:48 - tag a unique id
00:50 - and i'm just going to call this p1 we're
00:52 - going to have a few different paragraphs
00:54 - and
00:55 - we'll name each of these like p1 and
00:57 - then p2 and p3
00:58 - and we'll follow that order and we're
01:00 - going to line these all up differently
01:02 - depending on the margins that we set
01:04 - let's save this reload the page and here
01:07 - is our sample text
01:08 - let's go to our style sheet and just
01:10 - make a few changes
01:12 - so let's add a border around each of
01:14 - these elements because
01:15 - with a border it's going to be much
01:16 - easier to see the difference between
01:18 - padding and margins so let's make some
01:21 - changes to our h1 heading
01:22 - let's add a border that is one pixel
01:25 - thick
01:26 - and is solid and perhaps i'll give this
01:29 - a width too
01:30 - so maybe 300 pixels
01:33 - and let's target all paragraph elements
01:36 - we'll also give this a border one pixel
01:39 - is good
01:40 - and we'll make the solid and let's give
01:43 - this a width as well
01:44 - maybe 250 pixels all right let's see
01:47 - what this looks like
01:48 - and now we have a border around our h1
01:51 - header tag
01:52 - and our paragraph tags so let's add some
01:54 - padding just so we can see the
01:56 - difference between
01:57 - padding and margins so within our
02:00 - paragraph tag we're going to add
02:02 - some padding using the padding property
02:04 - and 25 pixels should work for this
02:07 - so remember that padding is the distance
02:10 - between
02:10 - an item within an element and where a
02:14 - border
02:14 - would be so think of it like you're
02:16 - receiving a package like think of this
02:18 - like a box
02:19 - this is your item that you're receiving
02:21 - in your package
02:22 - like you're receiving it in the mail and
02:24 - the padding is like
02:26 - the bubble wrap or the styrofoam that's
02:28 - keeping your items safe
02:29 - when it's being shipped and margins are
02:32 - the distance
02:33 - from an html element to other html
02:36 - elements or the edge of the browser
02:38 - window
02:39 - so let's add a margin around our
02:41 - paragraph element
02:43 - so we'll just type that here margin and
02:46 - then
02:46 - we can add maybe 25 pixels so this will
02:49 - add space around
02:50 - all sides of an element that has a
02:53 - margin and you can see that after we
02:54 - reloaded the webpage
02:56 - we now have extra space around this
02:59 - paragraph element
03:00 - so that's the main difference between
03:01 - padding and margins
03:03 - padding is the distance from an item
03:06 - within an element
03:07 - to where the border would be and the
03:09 - margin is the distance
03:11 - from where the border would be to either
03:13 - other html elements
03:15 - or the edge of the web browser and if
03:18 - you were to take a look on your web page
03:19 - you'll probably notice that there's a
03:21 - little bit of spacing
03:22 - at the top of your web page and on the
03:24 - left hand side so
03:25 - there's already some margin already on
03:27 - your html document
03:29 - so it is possible to use negative
03:31 - margins to pull items in closer together
03:34 - so what we'll do here is that we'll
03:35 - target the html tags
03:37 - and we're going to add a negative margin
03:39 - and you can also specify
03:41 - a specific side so we can just say the
03:43 - margin
03:44 - at the top and we can give this negative
03:47 - 21
03:48 - pixels and that should be just enough to
03:50 - pull this to the very top of the web
03:52 - browser window
03:53 - now we still have this margin on the
03:55 - left hand side
03:56 - so to target that we'll just type in
03:59 - margin
04:00 - dash left and that is about
04:03 - negative 8 pixels so
04:07 - after adding negative margins we can
04:09 - actually pull
04:10 - html elements closer together too if i
04:12 - were to take this margin
04:14 - within the paragraph tag and i switched
04:16 - this to negative 25
04:18 - this would actually begin to overlap but
04:21 - i don't like that so i'm going to change
04:22 - it back to what it was originally with
04:24 - 25
04:25 - pixels for the margin so that's a very
04:27 - basic way of adding margins to an html
04:29 - element you just use the margin property
04:31 - and the amount of space
04:33 - that you want to surround this html
04:35 - element with
04:36 - so let's create a few different examples
04:39 - with different techniques to add margins
04:41 - so this time i'm going to target the p1
04:44 - tag and i'm just going to move a few
04:46 - things around
04:47 - so i'm just going to move this margin to
04:49 - the p1 tag
04:52 - and i think i'll keep this the same then
04:54 - so this should be the same
04:56 - all right so let's take our paragraph
04:58 - our first one we're going to copy this
05:01 - and we're going to change p1 to p2
05:04 - for the second paragraph and this time
05:08 - we're going to
05:09 - target the p2 id
05:12 - so we can add margins to different
05:15 - borders around an html element we kind
05:18 - of did that with
05:19 - the negative margins that we had so with
05:22 - p2 let's target
05:24 - the top maybe we'll add 25 pixels
05:27 - there's margin dash right
05:32 - maybe 75 pixels
05:36 - margin dash bottom
05:41 - 25 pixels again you don't have to use
05:44 - the same numbers that i do feel free to
05:46 - change these if you want
05:47 - and margin dot left or margin dash left
05:52 - 75 pixels okay let's see what this looks
05:55 - like
05:56 - yeah you can see there's a little more
05:57 - spacing on the
05:59 - left hand side and the right hand side
06:01 - but not so much on the top or bottom
06:03 - because we only gave ourselves 25
06:06 - pixels worth the margin compared to the
06:08 - left and the right that has 75
06:10 - so there's an alternative way to write
06:12 - this that's shorthand
06:13 - so i'm actually going to write a note
06:15 - here that says
06:17 - this is the same
06:20 - so a shorthand way of writing all this
06:22 - is that you just type in
06:24 - the margin property and then we're going
06:26 - to list four fields here
06:28 - the first is the amount of pixels for
06:31 - the top
06:33 - second is for the right hand side so
06:36 - margin right
06:38 - then third is the bottom
06:41 - and the fourth is the left
06:45 - so this is the exact same thing as what
06:47 - we did up here
06:48 - just in less steps so this would look
06:51 - exactly the same as what we had
06:52 - originally do
06:54 - let's create another paragraph for our
06:55 - next example i'm going to copy
06:57 - our p2 paragraph paste it and we'll
07:01 - change the id
07:02 - to p3 let's save reload the page
07:06 - all right now this is the one that we
07:07 - want to add margins to
07:09 - so on our css sheet we're going to
07:12 - target the
07:13 - p3 id and we can also list
07:17 - a percentage for a margin for example we
07:20 - can list
07:21 - maybe 10 percent now
07:24 - the margin is going to change depending
07:27 - on the size of the browser window so
07:30 - currently it's set to 10
07:32 - if we were to change this to maybe 20
07:35 - you can see that the change is going to
07:36 - be more drastic and it's going to adjust
07:39 - dynamically depending on the size of the
07:41 - window
07:42 - let's create another paragraph so i'm
07:44 - going to copy this
07:46 - and we'll create a p4 id
07:50 - let's save that and we'll type in number
07:54 - sign
07:54 - p4 all right so you can also
07:58 - have your um paragraph
08:02 - or other html element have an automatic
08:04 - margin so for example if we typed in
08:06 - margin dash
08:07 - left and set this to auto what would
08:10 - happen
08:11 - is that this element would actually
08:15 - stick to the right hand side
08:18 - but i think our previous paragraph is
08:20 - actually messing with its positioning so
08:22 - i'm going to comment this out for now
08:27 - all right so yeah you can see here that
08:30 - this paragraph is now sticking to the
08:32 - right hand side because we set
08:34 - margin left to auto so it's going to
08:37 - stay on the right hand side no matter
08:39 - what the
08:40 - size of the browser window is and
08:43 - likewise we can do the same thing for
08:45 - a margin right auto it would stick to
08:49 - the
08:49 - left hand side and let's change this to
08:53 - p5
08:54 - and we'll copy our p4 paragraph and
08:57 - change this to p5
09:04 - okay now the p5 paragraph is sticking to
09:07 - the left hand side of our browser window
09:10 - lastly we can have margin just set to
09:13 - auto
09:14 - and let's use this for a p6 paragraph
09:17 - tag
09:17 - so margin auto and this will vertically
09:21 - center an html element so let's copy
09:25 - this paragraph and paste it
09:28 - and then we're going to change the id to
09:30 - p6
09:32 - so let's save this
09:35 - and reload the page now this is our p6
09:38 - paragraph
09:39 - and both the left and the right margins
09:42 - are set to
09:42 - auto so this will stay in the center of
09:45 - your web page
09:46 - it'll vertically stay centered no matter
09:49 - how
09:50 - large the browser window is then so a
09:52 - lot of people like to do this they set
09:54 - their
09:54 - margins to auto so this will stay in the
09:57 - middle of the webpage
09:58 - well that's the basics of margins in css
10:01 - if you would like a copy of all the
10:02 - markup that we worked on today
10:04 - i'll post this in the comments down
10:06 - below and pin it to the top
10:07 - but yeah that is the basics of margins
10:10 - in css

hey what's going on everybody it's bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to be teaching you guys about margins in css so let's get into it well let's begin with margins margins are used to create space around an element and it can be easy to mix up margins with padding because they both perform a similar task so to begin let's add some sample text to our web page let's

paragraph and paste it and then we're going to change the id to p6 so let's save this and reload the page now this is our p6 paragraph and both the left and the right margins are set to auto so this will stay in the center of your web page it'll vertically stay centered no matter how large the browser window is then so a lot of people like to do this they set their margins to auto so this will stay in the middle of the webpage well that's the basics of margins in css if you would like a copy of all the markup that we worked on today i'll post this in the comments down below and pin it to
