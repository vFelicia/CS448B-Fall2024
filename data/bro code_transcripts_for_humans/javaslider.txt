00:00 - hey I was it going everybody it's a bro
00:01 - here hope you're doing well and in this
00:03 - video I'm gonna be teaching you guys all
00:05 - about Jay sliders in Java and at the end
00:08 - of this video we're going to create a
00:09 - project where we can use a slider to
00:11 - adjust the temperature so let's get into
00:14 - it before you reach the end of this
00:18 - video make sure to LIKE comment and
00:21 - subscribe so that we together can
00:23 - challenge and defeat the mighty YouTube
00:25 - algorithm alright everyone so AJ slider
00:30 - is a GUI component that lets the user
00:33 - enter a value by using an adjustable
00:36 - sliding knob on a track so to best
00:38 - demonstrate this let's create another
00:40 - class to keep things organized so go to
00:43 - your source folder go to file new class
00:46 - and let's call this class slider demo
00:49 - click finish and then we're gonna go
00:52 - back to our main class and create an
00:54 - instance of this slider demo class so
00:56 - we're going to type slider demo and
01:00 - we'll call this slider demo with a
01:02 - lowercase s equals new slider demo
01:06 - parentheses semicolon so let's head to
01:09 - that class and start working here so
01:11 - we're going to need a few things to
01:12 - import so make sure you have these three
01:14 - imports java.awt asterisk Java x-wing
01:19 - dot asterisk and Java x-wing dot event
01:22 - asterisk now with this class we're going
01:25 - to implement the change listener
01:27 - interface so next to our class
01:29 - definition we're going to type
01:30 - implements change listener so then with
01:35 - our slider we can actually update
01:36 - something whenever we make a change now
01:39 - we're going to add an unimplemented
01:41 - method and it's going to be state
01:43 - changed but we're going to save that for
01:44 - the very end first
01:46 - let's work on our constructor for this
01:48 - slider demo class so we'll just copy
01:51 - this and paste it at a set of
01:53 - parentheses and the set of curly braces
01:55 - now what we'll do is actually declare a
01:58 - few global objects here so the first
02:01 - thing is that we'll want a frame so
02:03 - jframe and we'll call this frame and
02:06 - that's it for now we'll actually
02:08 - instantiate these within the constructor
02:10 - we're also going to want a J panel so
02:13 - jpanel and we'll call this panel we'll
02:17 - need a label so J label label and lastly
02:23 - a slider which is the I guess the main
02:26 - piece of this lesson so to do that you
02:29 - need to declare a J slider J slider and
02:33 - we'll call this slider all right now
02:36 - going within our constructor here we're
02:39 - going to instantiate these objects so
02:42 - the first thing that will create is our
02:43 - frame so frame equals new J frame and
02:48 - let's set the text to slider let's spell
02:52 - it right
02:52 - slider demo and then we will want to
02:57 - instantiate our panel because we're
02:59 - gonna add the panel to the frame so
03:01 - panel equals new J panel will
03:08 - instantiate our label so label equals
03:11 - new J label and then lastly our slider
03:16 - so slider equals new J slider
03:21 - parenthesis semicolon okay now with the
03:25 - slider there's a few values that we can
03:28 - add so with sliders we can have a
03:30 - spectrum of ranges and then we can have
03:33 - the user add just a knob and then they
03:37 - can enter in a value that way so the
03:40 - first set of values is the minimum and
03:42 - the maximum set of numbers for our
03:44 - slider so let's say that we want
03:46 - somebody to adjust a knob on a track
03:48 - between the numbers 0 and 100 so what
03:51 - we'll do for the first number the
03:52 - minimum is enter in 0 and then separate
03:55 - it with a comma then you can enter in
03:57 - the maximum number so let's say 100 so
04:00 - maybe we're finding the temperature of
04:03 - maybe water between the temperature of 0
04:06 - and 100 degrees Celsius so we're going
04:08 - to set a minimum of 0 and a max of 100
04:11 - and now there's a third value can add
04:13 - this is the starting point for the
04:15 - slider let's say we want this to start
04:17 - in the middle well we could say 50 for
04:19 - the starting point now before we get
04:21 - ahead of ourselves let's add everything
04:23 - to the frame so first we'll add the
04:26 - slider to the
04:27 - and later we're going to add the panel
04:29 - to the frame so we'll start with panel
04:31 - dot add slider and we're also going to
04:35 - add the label to the panel so panel dot
04:38 - add label and then frame dot add panel
04:45 - and then let's set the size for our
04:48 - frame so frame dot set size and I like
04:53 - to pick for 20 by for 20 and then we
04:56 - need to set the frame to be visible so
05:00 - frame dot set visible true alright so
05:04 - first let's work on our slider then so
05:08 - let's set the preferred size for this
05:10 - slider so we type in the name of the
05:12 - slider dot and then we're going to use
05:15 - the set preferred size method we're
05:19 - going to type in new dimension and we're
05:23 - going to give a width and a height so
05:26 - for hundreds of decent height I mean
05:28 - with so 400 for the width and 200 for
05:31 - the heights pretty decent I would say
05:33 - let's actually see what we have so far
05:36 - okay yeah here's our slider then so it's
05:39 - just a bar that's adjustable there's no
05:41 - markings or anything so we need to add
05:43 - that later all right now what we're
05:46 - going to do is add paint tics so slider
05:49 - dot set paint ticks and within
05:55 - parenthesis we're going to place the
05:57 - word true so let's see what this looks
05:59 - like now all right so we also need to
06:02 - add the tick spacing so these are little
06:05 - I want to say notches that kind of give
06:07 - you an idea of the range of numbers so
06:10 - what we'll type in here is slider dot
06:14 - set minor tick spacing so how often do
06:19 - you want a notch in this slider let's
06:22 - say every 10 units every 10 of whatever
06:26 - you're counting by in our case it's
06:28 - degrees Celsius so let's try it now so
06:33 - these are numbered yet but you can see
06:35 - about every 10 we should have at least
06:37 - like 10 ranges starting at 0 then they
06:40 - go all the way up to
06:41 - there's a little like not cheer now
06:43 - we're going to set some major tick
06:46 - spacing so that comes next
06:48 - so I'm just going to copy this and we're
06:51 - going to change a few things
06:52 - so set paint track and we want this to
06:58 - be true and the next thing is set major
07:02 - tick space and let's set this to 25 okay
07:10 - now after each 25 units there's a larger
07:14 - tick these are major ticks and the small
07:17 - ones are minor ticks then and now with
07:20 - the slider we can actually add values to
07:22 - each of these major ticks and let me
07:24 - show you how to do that so I'll add that
07:27 - maybe right here so what we're gonna
07:29 - type is slider dot set paint labels and
07:35 - we're going to set this to true now we
07:39 - have our numbers for each of our major
07:42 - ticks but not the minor ticks and it
07:44 - gives our whole range between 0 and 100
07:48 - and you can see that when we started
07:50 - this program it begun like right in the
07:53 - middle at 50 because we set this value
07:55 - this argument the third one to 50 the
07:58 - first one is the minimum which is zero
07:59 - and the second value is the maximum
08:02 - which is 100 so if you adjusted these
08:04 - numbers it would also adjust the numbers
08:06 - on our slider let's also change the font
08:08 - down here too so maybe I'll do that next
08:11 - so slider dot set font new font
08:18 - I really cannot spell today and maybe
08:24 - I'll give this a font of MV Bohle
08:26 - because that's one of my favorite fonts
08:28 - and then font dot plain we don't need to
08:32 - do any styling and I will pick a font
08:35 - size of 15 and let's see what this looks
08:39 - like now not too bad not too bad looks
08:42 - more modern now I would say so one trick
08:45 - you can do with this slider bar is that
08:47 - by default this is horizontal so we
08:50 - could actually change this to a vertical
08:52 - slider bar and that kind of resembles
08:54 - eight there
08:55 - rahmanir since we're taking the
08:56 - temperature so in order to change that
08:58 - to vertical then type the name of the
09:00 - slider dot set orientation and then
09:05 - within here we're going to type swing
09:08 - constants and then dot vertical and
09:18 - let's take a look yeah I would say that
09:22 - would fit a thermometer of sorts then if
09:26 - you want to change it back it's gonna be
09:27 - the same process but change vertical to
09:31 - horizontal and this is what we had
09:37 - previously but I think for this
09:39 - demonstration I'm going to keep it as
09:41 - vertical but I'll just turn this into a
09:43 - comment just so you have it for your
09:45 - notes alright let's add a label so we'll
09:50 - have a label underneath that will
09:51 - display the current temperature whatever
09:53 - this is set to so let's add that right
09:56 - underneath our slider but before we add
09:58 - everything to our panel and our frame
10:00 - now to set the text for the label type
10:03 - in the name of the label and we're going
10:04 - to use the set text function and then
10:08 - we're going to change the text so I'm
10:11 - going to insert the degree symbol I
10:13 - actually don't know how to do this
10:15 - normally so I copied it from Google then
10:18 - degrees C equals and then if we want to
10:22 - retrieve what the current value of the
10:24 - slider is set to we can add + slider and
10:28 - we'll use the get value function of the
10:32 - slider all right
10:34 - let's take a look at this now so it says
10:38 - it's set to 50 degrees Celsius but I
10:41 - think I'm going to increase the font so
10:43 - I'm just going to copy this paste it and
10:47 - change slider to label and let's set
10:50 - this to maybe 25 so it's more visible
10:53 - that's better
10:55 - okay so it's currently set to 50 but if
10:57 - we adjust this this number doesn't
10:59 - change so I'll teach you guys how to do
11:01 - that and we're going to do this within
11:03 - our state changed method so what we're
11:06 - gonna type in here is
11:08 - label dot set text actually we can just
11:13 - copy this and paste it that'd probably
11:15 - be easier
11:18 - so whenever the state changes for the
11:20 - slider it's going to execute this line
11:23 - of code and update it now the last thing
11:25 - that we need to do is that we need
11:26 - something to trigger our state changed
11:29 - method so we need to add a change
11:32 - listener to our slider and we can just
11:34 - add that here so type in slider dot add
11:38 - change listener and then within
11:41 - parentheses type in the word this so
11:44 - this should work now let's try it okay
11:48 - so the midpoint is 50 degrees Celsius
11:51 - the minimum is 0 which we have here in
11:54 - the max is 100 and now if we adjusted
11:56 - this slider this value is also changing
11:59 - whenever we adjust the knob on this
12:01 - track so it has a minimum of 0 and a max
12:04 - of 100 like we intended and it's
12:06 - adjusting whenever we actually moved the
12:09 - knob on this track then so that's how J
12:12 - sliders work it's a GUI component that
12:14 - lets the user enter a value by using an
12:16 - adjustable sliding knob on a track so if
12:19 - you're looking for extra practice your
12:21 - assignment is to post the code for a
12:23 - slider that you've made in the comments
12:25 - down below but yeah that's one of a few
12:28 - ways you can create a J slider in Java
12:31 - hey you yeah I'm talking to you if you
12:34 - learn something new then you can help me
12:36 - help you in 3 easy steps by smashing

Cleaned transcript:

hey I was it going everybody it's a bro here hope you're doing well and in this video I'm gonna be teaching you guys all about Jay sliders in Java and at the end of this video we're going to create a project where we can use a slider to adjust the temperature so let's get into it before you reach the end of this video make sure to LIKE comment and subscribe so that we together can challenge and defeat the mighty YouTube algorithm alright everyone so AJ slider is a GUI component that lets the user enter a value by using an adjustable sliding knob on a track so to best demonstrate this let's create another class to keep things organized so go to your source folder go to file new class and let's call this class slider demo click finish and then we're gonna go back to our main class and create an instance of this slider demo class so we're going to type slider demo and we'll call this slider demo with a lowercase s equals new slider demo parentheses semicolon so let's head to that class and start working here so we're going to need a few things to import so make sure you have these three imports java.awt asterisk Java xwing dot asterisk and Java xwing dot event asterisk now with this class we're going to implement the change listener interface so next to our class definition we're going to type implements change listener so then with our slider we can actually update something whenever we make a change now we're going to add an unimplemented method and it's going to be state changed but we're going to save that for the very end first let's work on our constructor

now there's a third value can add this is the starting point for the slider let's say we want this to start in the middle well we could say 50 for the starting point now before we get ahead of ourselves let's add everything to the frame so first we'll add the slider to the and later we're going to add the panel to the frame so we'll start with panel dot add slider and we're also going to add the label to the panel so panel dot add label and then frame dot add panel and then let's set the size for our frame so frame dot set size and I like to pick for 20 by for 20 and then we need to set the frame to be visible so frame dot set visible true alright so first let's work on our slider then so let's set the preferred size for this slider so we type in the name of the slider dot and then we're going to use the set preferred size method we're going to type in new dimension and we're going to give a width and a height so for hundreds of decent height I mean with so 400 for the width and 200 for the heights pretty decent I would say let's actually see what we have so far okay yeah here's our slider then so it's just a bar that's adjustable there's no markings or anything so

this to 25 okay now after each 25 units there's a larger tick these are major ticks and the small ones are minor ticks then and now with the slider we can actually add values to each of these major ticks and let me show you how to do that so I'll add that maybe right here so what we're gonna type is slider dot set paint labels and we're going to set this to true now we have our numbers for each of our major ticks but not the minor ticks and it gives our whole range between 0 and 100 and you can see that when we started this program it begun like right in the middle at 50 because we set this value this argument the third one to 50 the first one is the minimum which is zero and the second value is the maximum which is 100 so if you adjusted these numbers it would also adjust the numbers on our slider let's also change the font down here too so maybe I'll do that next so slider dot set font new font I really cannot spell today and maybe I'll give this a font of MV Bohle because that's one of my favorite fonts and then font dot plain we don't need to do any styling and I will pick a font size of 15 and let's see what this looks like now not too bad not too bad looks more modern now
