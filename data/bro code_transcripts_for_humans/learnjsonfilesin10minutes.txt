With timestamps:

00:00 - what's up everybody so today I got to
00:02 - talk about Json files using JavaScript
00:05 - Json means JavaScript object notation
00:08 - it's a data interchange format most of
00:10 - the time it's used for exchanging data
00:13 - between a server and a web application
00:15 - they can have a few different formats
00:17 - usually you'll see a Json file as an
00:20 - object an object made up of key value
00:23 - pairs or you may see them as an array an
00:26 - array of values or some combination of
00:28 - both you can have an object where one of
00:30 - the values is an array and or you could
00:33 - have an array of objects like this just
00:36 - to understand the format we'll create a
00:38 - new Json file let's go to our website
00:41 - folder create a new file we'll create an
00:43 - array of names the file extension is
00:47 - Json we'll Begin by writing an array
00:50 - with a set of straight brackets let's
00:52 - add a few names just some first names
00:55 - SpongeBob
00:58 - Patrick Squidward
01:02 - Sandy this is a valid Json format let's
01:06 - create a new Json file just for a single
01:08 - person this will be an object new file
01:12 - person.
01:15 - Json this time we will create a single
01:18 - object this object will have key value
01:20 - pairs we will have a name key and a
01:24 - value of
01:28 - SpongeBob each key value pair is going
01:30 - to be comma
01:31 - separated SpongeBob will have an AG
01:34 - key of
01:37 - 30 and a Boolean of is employed is
01:41 - SpongeBob currently employed that will
01:44 - be
01:44 - true this is also a valid format our
01:47 - Json file contains one object an object
01:51 - made up of key value pairs objects can
01:53 - even have arrays as one of their values
01:56 - we will create an array of
01:58 - hobbies what does SpongeBob like to do
02:01 - this will be an
02:02 - array jelly
02:06 - fishing
02:08 - karate and
02:10 - cooking let's create one more Json
02:14 - file we will create a Json file for
02:16 - people this will be an array of objects
02:19 - people.
02:21 - Json we're going to create an array of
02:23 - objects within this array we'll create
02:26 - one
02:26 - object what key value pairs should this
02:29 - object have
02:30 - we'll just reuse what we have for
02:31 - SpongeBob excluding the array to keep it
02:36 - simple okay that will be the first
02:38 - object let's create another object we
02:41 - need another set of curly
02:43 - braces the second object will have a
02:45 - name property of Patrick age 34 is
02:49 - employed will be
02:51 - false the next object this will be for
02:56 - Squidward age
02:58 - 50 is employed loyed true he works at
03:01 - the Crusty
03:02 - Crab one last object name Sandy
03:08 - h27 is employed false Sandy is
03:12 - self-employed all right we have an array
03:14 - of objects each object can have its own
03:17 - unique key value pairs so let's close
03:20 - out of these Json files but we'll hold
03:22 - on to
03:23 - them so Json formats they're one long
03:27 - string to represent that object or array
03:29 - using the stringify method of Json we
03:32 - can convert a JavaScript object or an
03:35 - array into a Json string so let's copy
03:38 - what we have for
03:40 - names I will create a constant of names
03:44 - equals that array we'll convert it to a
03:48 - Json
03:49 - string const Json string equals access
03:55 - Json Json is a built-in object that's
03:58 - provided to us to work with Json files
04:01 - we will use the stringify method then
04:04 - pass in our array or our
04:06 - object currently if I were to
04:09 - console.log my names before stringifying
04:11 - it here's the
04:13 - result we have an array of strings to
04:15 - work with after using the stringify
04:18 - method on names we'll be given one long
04:21 - string to represent this array if I was
04:24 - to use this on an object let's copy what
04:26 - we have for person
04:31 - I will create a const of person this
04:35 - will be an object I'll just paste what I
04:36 - have for SpongeBob first let's
04:39 - console.log person here's my person
04:43 - object then let's stringify it and
04:46 - display the Json
04:47 - string Json files work with one long
04:50 - string that represents an object or an
04:53 - array let's stringify our people it's an
04:57 - array of
04:58 - objects
05:02 - const people equals paste what we have
05:06 - let me show you what happens when I
05:08 - console.log people before stringifying
05:11 - it we have an array of
05:14 - objects each object has its own key
05:17 - value pairs then if I was to stringify
05:20 - it here's the
05:24 - result one extremely long
05:27 - string now we'll use parse parse
05:30 - converts a Json string to a JavaScript
05:32 - object so let me reformat
05:43 - these to convert these objects or arays
05:45 - into a string we can surround them with
05:47 - a pair of back
05:57 - ticks so let's rename these let's say
06:02 - Json
06:04 - names Json
06:08 - person then Json
06:14 - people these objects and arrays are all
06:16 - in a Json format to convert them to
06:19 - their original form we can use the parse
06:21 - method of Json I will create a constant
06:25 - of par data equals Json
06:31 - parse pass in our data of Json
06:36 - names and then let's
06:38 - console.log let me show you Json names
06:40 - first before parsing it we have a string
06:43 - representation of an array but after
06:45 - parsing it it becomes a JavaScript array
06:49 - let's do this with our string
06:50 - representation of an object Json person
06:54 - normally it looks like this then after
06:56 - parsing it we have a JavaScript object
07:00 - and then Json people it's an array of
07:03 - objects then we'll parse
07:05 - it and here's the result an array of
07:09 - objects now I'm going to show you how we
07:11 - can fetch a Json file we'll talk about
07:14 - fetch more in the next topic fetch is a
07:17 - function as an argument we can pass in a
07:19 - relative or absolute file path or a URL
07:23 - we'll discuss that in the next
07:24 - topic I would like to get my Json file
07:27 - of let's go with person
07:31 - so I will list the relative file path
07:33 - these files are right next to each other
07:36 - I just need to type person. Json fetch
07:40 - returns a promise we will follow this
07:42 - with the then method then do this we'll
07:46 - be provided with a response
07:49 - object take our response Arrow do this
07:53 - we will take our response object convert
07:56 - it to a Json format using the Json
07:58 - method then let's display what we have
08:01 - currently then take the value arrow
08:06 - console.log that
08:09 - value let's see what we have yep there's
08:12 - SpongeBob we have successfully fetched a
08:15 - Json file let's do this with our array
08:18 - of
08:19 - names we have an array of strings of
08:22 - first names and people people.
08:26 - Json we have an array of objects
08:30 - one object for each
08:32 - person if you would like to iterate
08:34 - through all the objects let's rename
08:36 - value as values we'll use the built-in
08:39 - for each method of arrays values. for
08:44 - each take each value Arrow do this
08:49 - console.log each
08:52 - value now we're iterating through and
08:55 - printing each object if you would like
08:57 - some of the specific properties like
08:59 - name follow the value with name
09:03 - SpongeBob Patrick Squidward Sandy or
09:07 - age or is
09:11 - employed oh and another thing that I'm
09:13 - forgetting be sure to add a catch method
09:15 - to catch any errors just in case we
09:17 - can't fetch this Json file for some
09:20 - reason console.log or console. error the
09:25 - error
09:26 - message we'll talk about fetch more in
09:28 - the next topic all right everybody so
09:31 - those are Json files Json means
09:33 - JavaScript object notation it's a data
09:36 - interchange format it's mostly used for
09:38 - exchanging data between a server and a
09:41 - web application Json files are usually
09:44 - objects or an array or some combination
09:46 - of both to convert a Json object to a
09:48 - string you can use the stringify method
09:50 - to convert a Json string to an object
09:53 - you can use the parse method to fetch a
09:55 - Json file you can use the fetch function
09:57 - which we'll talk about next and get more
09:59 - in depth with and well everybody those
10:01 - are Json files using
10:07 - JavaScript

Cleaned transcript:

what's up everybody so today I got to talk about Json files using JavaScript Json means JavaScript object notation it's a data interchange format most of the time it's used for exchanging data between a server and a web application they can have a few different formats usually you'll see a Json file as an object an object made up of key value pairs or you may see them as an array an array of values or some combination of both you can have an object where one of the values is an array and or you could have an array of objects like this just to understand the format we'll create a new Json file let's go to our website folder create a new file we'll create an array of names the file extension is Json we'll Begin by writing an array with a set of straight brackets let's add a few names just some first names SpongeBob Patrick Squidward Sandy this is a valid Json format let's create a new Json file just for a single person this will be an object new file person. Json this time we will create a single object this object will have key value pairs we will have a name key and a value of SpongeBob each key value pair is going to be comma separated SpongeBob will have an AG key of 30 and a Boolean of is employed is SpongeBob currently employed that will be true this is also a valid format our Json file contains one object an object made up of key value pairs objects can even have arrays as one of their values we will create an array of hobbies what does SpongeBob like to do this will be an array jelly fishing karate and cooking let's create one more Json file we will create a Json file for people this will be an array of objects people. Json we're going to create an array of objects within this array we'll create one object what key value pairs should this object have we'll just reuse what we have for SpongeBob excluding the array to keep it simple okay that will be the first object let's create another object we need another set of curly braces the second object will have a name property of Patrick age 34 is employed will be false the next object this will be for Squidward age 50 is employed loyed true he works at the Crusty Crab one last object name Sandy h27 is employed false Sandy is selfemployed all right we have an array of objects each object can have its own unique key value pairs so let's close out of these Json files but we'll hold on to them so Json formats they're one long string to represent that object or array using the stringify method of Json we can convert a JavaScript object or an array into a Json string so let's copy what we have for names I will create a constant of names equals that array we'll convert it to a Json string const Json string equals access Json Json is a builtin object that's provided to us to work with Json files we will use the stringify method then pass in our array or our object currently if I were to console.log my names before stringifying it here's the result we have an array of strings to work with after using the stringify method on names we'll be given one long string to represent this array if I was to use this on an object let's copy what we have for person I will create a const of person this will be an object I'll just paste what I have for SpongeBob first let's console.log person here's my person object then let's stringify it and display the Json string Json files work with one long string that represents an object or an array let's stringify our people it's an array of objects const people equals paste what we have let me show you what happens when I console.log people before stringifying it we have an array of objects each object has its own key value pairs then if I was to stringify it here's the result one extremely long string now we'll use parse parse converts a Json string to a JavaScript object so let me reformat these to convert these objects or arays into a string we can surround them with a pair of back ticks so let's rename these let's say Json names Json person then Json people these objects and arrays are all in a Json format to convert them to their original form we can use the parse method of Json I will create a constant of par data equals Json parse pass in our data of Json names and then let's console.log let me show you Json names first before parsing it we have a string representation of an array but after parsing it it becomes a JavaScript array let's do this with our string representation of an object Json person normally it looks like this then after parsing it we have a JavaScript object and then Json people it's an array of objects then we'll parse it and here's the result an array of objects now I'm going to show you how we can fetch a Json file we'll talk about fetch more in the next topic fetch is a function as an argument we can pass in a relative or absolute file path or a URL we'll discuss that in the next topic I would like to get my Json file of let's go with person so I will list the relative file path these files are right next to each other I just need to type person. Json fetch returns a promise we will follow this with the then method then do this we'll be provided with a response object take our response Arrow do this we will take our response object convert it to a Json format using the Json method then let's display what we have currently then take the value arrow console.log that value let's see what we have yep there's SpongeBob we have successfully fetched a Json file let's do this with our array of names we have an array of strings of first names and people people. Json we have an array of objects one object for each person if you would like to iterate through all the objects let's rename value as values we'll use the builtin for each method of arrays values. for each take each value Arrow do this console.log each value now we're iterating through and printing each object if you would like some of the specific properties like name follow the value with name SpongeBob Patrick Squidward Sandy or age or is employed oh and another thing that I'm forgetting be sure to add a catch method to catch any errors just in case we can't fetch this Json file for some reason console.log or console. error the error message we'll talk about fetch more in the next topic all right everybody so those are Json files Json means JavaScript object notation it's a data interchange format it's mostly used for exchanging data between a server and a web application Json files are usually objects or an array or some combination of both to convert a Json object to a string you can use the stringify method to convert a Json string to an object you can use the parse method to fetch a Json file you can use the fetch function which we'll talk about next and get more in depth with and well everybody those are Json files using JavaScript
