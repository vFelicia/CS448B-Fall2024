00:00 - hey everybody in this topic I'm going to
00:02 - explain Auto commit commit and rollback
00:04 - Auto commit is a mode by default Auto
00:07 - commit is set to on whenever you execute
00:09 - a transaction within MySQL that
00:12 - transaction is saved what if we were to
00:14 - make a transaction and we need to undo
00:16 - that transaction for example what if we
00:19 - accidentally delete all of the rows of
00:21 - this table don't do what I do but I'll
00:22 - give you a demonstration I accidentally
00:25 - type in delete from employees but I
00:29 - forget to add a where Clause well all my
00:31 - rows are now gone how do I undo these
00:33 - changes well what we're going to do is
00:36 - set
00:37 - Auto commit
00:40 - to equal off
00:43 - with this setting set to off our
00:45 - transactions will not save automatically
00:48 - we would need to manually save each
00:51 - transaction it creates a save point so
00:53 - to say
00:55 - I'm going to create a save point by
00:57 - typing commit
01:00 - then execute now I'm going to select my
01:03 - table select all from the name of my
01:06 - table
01:09 - then I'm going to go ahead and delete
01:11 - all the rows
01:13 - delete from employees
01:17 - oh shoot but I forgot to add a where
01:20 - Clause my whole table is gone now
01:22 - luckily we created a safe point with
01:24 - that commit statement
01:26 - to undo these changes
01:28 - I can execute the roll back statement
01:34 - this will restore my current transaction
01:36 - back to the previous save point where we
01:38 - used commit now if I were to select all
01:42 - from the name of my table
01:46 - our table is back to what it previously
01:48 - was
01:49 - and again to save any changes
01:51 - let's say I delete my whole table again
01:53 - delete from
01:55 - employees
01:57 - if I want to save this change I would
02:00 - commit
02:04 - then again I will select my table
02:10 - and that last change is now saved my
02:13 - whole table is gone
02:14 - so yeah that is auto commit commit and
02:17 - roll back by default Auto commit is set
02:20 - to be on any transactions after
02:22 - executing are saved if that mode is set
02:25 - to off you can commit any changes
02:27 - manually to undo any changes use that
02:29 - rollback statement so yeah that is auto
02:31 - commit commit and roll back in MySQL
