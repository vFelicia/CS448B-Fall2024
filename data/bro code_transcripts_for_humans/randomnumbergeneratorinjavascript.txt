00:00 - hey what's going on everybody so in
00:01 - today's video we're going to create a
00:03 - random number generator but first I need
00:05 - to explain how to create a random number
00:07 - in JavaScript let's store a random
00:09 - number within a variable which we will
00:11 - name random num
00:14 - to create a random number in JavaScript
00:16 - we can use the random method of math
00:19 - math dot random method this will
00:22 - generate a random number between 0 and
00:25 - 1. but it looks like we forgot to Output
00:28 - our random number so let's do that with
00:31 - console.log
00:32 - console.log randomnum this will generate
00:35 - a random number between 0 and 1. it will
00:38 - give us a number with a long decimal
00:40 - portion most likely let's say we would
00:43 - like to roll a six-sided dice I need a
00:45 - random number between one and six not
00:48 - including the decimal portion so the
00:50 - first step is that we will multiply
00:53 - math.random times six
00:56 - what this will do is give us a random
00:58 - number between 0 and 6 exclusive now I
01:01 - don't want the decimal portion I would
01:03 - like a whole integer we'll enclose this
01:05 - equation with the floor method of math
01:09 - dot floor then we will enclose our
01:12 - equation
01:14 - so now we have
01:15 - oops it looks like I misspelled math it
01:17 - should be Capital there so far a random
01:20 - number is going to be between zero and
01:22 - five so they're zero
01:25 - and there's five
01:28 - but I need one through six well we can
01:30 - increase the minimum by adding plus one
01:32 - or whatever you want the minimum to be
01:34 - so now that should give us a random
01:37 - number between one and six
01:40 - there's six
01:43 - and there's one
01:44 - for a random number between 1 and 100 I
01:47 - can set the maximum to be 100
01:49 - math.random times one hundred plus one
01:53 - so now the number is going to be between
01:55 - 1 and 100.
01:57 - if you're looking for a random number
01:59 - between a certain range let's say 50 and
02:01 - 100
02:03 - well we're going to change our equation
02:05 - just to make this easier to read I'm
02:07 - going to set two constants const Min
02:10 - what's the minimum let's say 50. and the
02:13 - max const max will be 100.
02:17 - let's replace 100 with our maximum and
02:21 - one with our minimum there's one
02:23 - additional change we need to make for
02:25 - example our random number is 139
02:29 - we're multiplying math.random times 100
02:33 - our maximum then adding an additional 50
02:36 - to it
02:37 - so one change we're going to make is
02:39 - that we will subtract our minimum from
02:42 - our maximum then I will surround this
02:44 - portion of our equation with the set of
02:46 - parentheses just to force operator
02:47 - precedence now the random number should
02:50 - be between 50 and 100 so depending on
02:53 - the range of numbers you're looking for
02:54 - you can change the minimum and the
02:56 - maximum all right now with that out of
02:58 - the way let's create our random number
03:00 - generator
03:01 - let's go to our HTML file I will create
03:04 - a button
03:07 - the ID will be my button the text on the
03:11 - button will be roll we will roll a
03:14 - six-sided dice
03:15 - within our CSS style sheet
03:18 - I will set the text of the body of our
03:21 - document
03:22 - the font family I will set to be verdana
03:26 - because I like that font
03:29 - to Center align everything to make this
03:31 - easy I will set text aligned Center
03:35 - all right we're getting somewhere
03:37 - let's work on the button I will select
03:39 - the ID of my button
03:42 - I will change the font size of the
03:44 - button to be 3 em meaning 300 percent
03:48 - I'll add a little bit of padding within
03:50 - our button 5 pixels by 25 pixels
03:54 - and I will set the Border radius to be 5
03:59 - pixels
04:01 - just to smooth the corners
04:03 - we're also going to need a label so
04:05 - let's go back to our HTML file
04:07 - I will add a label
04:10 - with an ID of my label
04:15 - within our CSS style sheet I will select
04:18 - the ID of my label then change the font
04:22 - size to be 3 em
04:24 - so be sure to save your CSS file
04:27 - save your HTML file
04:30 - then within our JavaScript file
04:33 - we will need to get our button and the
04:35 - label we'll store those within some
04:37 - constants
04:39 - const my button equals document dot get
04:44 - element by ID the ID of the element
04:48 - we're getting is my button
04:54 - then we will need to get my label
04:57 - my
04:59 - label the ID is my label
05:04 - let's set a minimum
05:06 - const Min equals I'll set that to be one
05:10 - as if we're rolling a six-sided dice
05:12 - const Max equals six
05:16 - then let random num will declare a
05:20 - random number variable but not assign it
05:22 - quite yet
05:23 - okay when we click on the button
05:26 - we'll execute a function
05:27 - we will take my button
05:30 - with the on click attribute I will set
05:33 - the SQL to a function what's the
05:36 - function going to do it's going to roll
05:38 - a random number
05:39 - random num equals math dot random times
05:45 - our maximum
05:49 - we'll enclose this equation with
05:51 - math.floor to round it math dot floor
05:56 - then add our minimum
05:59 - then we will change the text content of
06:02 - my label to display it my label dot text
06:06 - content equals our randomnum
06:10 - when we click on the button it should
06:12 - roll a random number
06:14 - uh what are we missing not a number
06:17 - oh okay it looks like I made a mistake I
06:19 - forgot to add a set of parentheses after
06:21 - random
06:22 - there we go
06:24 - I'm going to put the number on a new
06:25 - line so within our HTML file I'm just
06:27 - going to add a Break Tag
06:30 - there we go let's save everything roll
06:32 - again so I rolled a six three one two
06:35 - five three
06:37 - let's say we would like to roll three
06:39 - dice not just one we'll make a few
06:41 - changes
06:43 - I will replace my label with label one
06:46 - for the ID
06:48 - then I'm going to add a break after okay
06:51 - let's copy our label paste it two times
06:54 - we'll need labels two and three
06:58 - I'll also give these labels a class of
07:01 - my labels
07:04 - we can apply CSS styling to an entire
07:06 - class to make it easy
07:08 - all right within our CSS style sheet
07:11 - let's replace the ID of my label with
07:13 - the class of my labels
07:18 - be sure to save all of your files
07:20 - than within our Javascript file let's
07:24 - replace my label with label one
07:27 - the ID is label one
07:30 - copy this line of code
07:32 - then we need labels two and three
07:34 - label two
07:36 - label three
07:39 - let's rename randomnum as random num1
07:44 - copy it paste it two times then we need
07:47 - random number two random number three
07:51 - within our function for our button
07:53 - change random num to be random num1 copy
07:56 - this line paste it two times
07:59 - then we need random number two random
08:01 - number three
08:03 - we'll change the text content of my
08:05 - label to be label one
08:08 - equals random num1 copy this line paste
08:12 - it two times change one to B2
08:15 - then for the third line change one to be
08:18 - three
08:19 - what we'll do now is generate three
08:21 - random numbers between one and six as if
08:24 - we're rolling three dice
08:25 - two three two three six one two two five
08:29 - all right everybody that's how to create
08:30 - a random number generator in JavaScript

between one and six there's six and there's one for a random number between 1 and 100 I can set the maximum to be 100 math.random times one hundred plus one so now the number is going to be between 1 and 100. if you're looking for a random number between a certain range let's say 50 and 100 well we're going to change our equation just to make this easier to read I'm going to set two constants const Min what's the minimum let's say 50. and the max const max will be 100. let's replace 100 with our maximum and one with our minimum there's one additional change we need to make for example our

I will surround this portion of our equation with the set of parentheses just to force operator precedence now the random number should be between 50 and 100 so depending on the range of numbers you're looking for you can change the minimum and the maximum all right now with that out of the way let's create our random number generator let's go to our HTML file I will create a button the ID will be my button the text on the button will be roll we will roll a sixsided dice within our CSS style sheet I will set the text of the body of our document the font family I will set to be verdana because I like that font to Center align everything to make this easy I will set text aligned Center all right we're getting somewhere let's work on the button I will select the ID of my button I will change the font size of the button to be 3 em meaning 300 percent I'll add a little bit of padding within our button 5 pixels by 25 pixels and I will set the Border radius to be 5 pixels just to

the font size to be 3 em so be sure to save your CSS file save your HTML file then within our JavaScript file we will need to get our button and the label we'll store those within some constants const my button equals document dot get element by ID the ID of the element we're getting is my button then we will need to get my label my label the ID is my label let's set a minimum const Min equals I'll set that to be one as if we're rolling a sixsided dice const Max equals six then let random num will declare a random number variable but not assign it quite yet okay when we click on the button we'll execute a function we will take my button with the on click attribute I will set the SQL to a function what's the function going to do it's going to roll a random number random num equals math dot random times our maximum we'll enclose this equation with math.floor to round it math dot floor then add our minimum then we will change the text content of my label to display it my label dot text content equals our randomnum when we click on the button it should roll a random number uh what are we missing not a number oh okay it looks like I made a mistake I forgot to add a set of parentheses after random there we go I'm going to put the number on a new line so within our HTML file I'm just going to add a Break Tag there we go let's save everything roll again so I rolled a six three one two five three let's say we would like to roll three dice not just one we'll make a few changes I will replace my label with label one for the ID then I'm going to add a break after okay let's copy our label paste it two times we'll need labels two and three I'll also give these labels a class of my labels we can apply CSS styling to an entire class to make it easy all right within our CSS style sheet let's replace the ID of my label with the class of my labels be sure to save all of your files than within our Javascript file let's replace my label with label one the ID is label one copy this line of code then we need labels two and three label two label three let's rename randomnum as random num1 copy it paste it two times then we need random number two random number three within our function for our button change random num to be random num1 copy this line paste it two times then we need random number two random number three we'll change the text content of my label to be label one equals random num1 copy this line paste it two times change one to B2 then for the third line change one to be three what we'll do now is generate three random numbers between one and six as if we're rolling three dice two three two three six one two two five all right everybody that's how to create a random number generator in JavaScript
