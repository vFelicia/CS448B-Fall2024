00:00 - hey how's it going everybody in today's
00:02 - video I'm going to show you how we can
00:03 - include audio in a web page using HTML
00:06 - you'll need some audio files to work
00:08 - with one place you can download some MP3
00:10 - files is the YouTube audio library find
00:14 - some songs that you like and then you
00:15 - can download them let's download three
00:18 - for this lesson
00:19 - once you have your three songs let's
00:21 - move them to our website folder
00:24 - alright we are ready to begin so to
00:27 - include some audio we need a pair of
00:29 - audio tags
00:32 - then between the audio tags let's
00:34 - include a source element
00:37 - with the source element there is a
00:39 - source attribute we will set the source
00:42 - attribute to equal the name of an MP3
00:45 - file or other audio file
00:47 - so let me copy the name
00:50 - be sure to get the file extension
00:54 - and then I will paste that file the file
00:57 - name nothing appears to happen because
00:59 - we don't have any controls and the song
01:02 - doesn't play right away too so to add
01:04 - some controls within the opening audio
01:06 - tag type controls and that's it so we
01:10 - can now play our song
01:11 - [Music]
01:16 - or you can mute it fast forward it
01:19 - rewind it set the playback speed
01:21 - whatever you can set your audio file to
01:24 - auto play but people find that annoying
01:27 - [Music]
01:30 - so you should probably not do that if we
01:33 - do want our song to autoplay we should
01:35 - at least mute it using the muted
01:37 - attribute
01:38 - so our song is playing but it's muted
01:40 - until we unmute it
01:42 - [Music]
01:46 - we can even have our song Loop by using
01:48 - the loop attribute
01:50 - so let me play this turn up the volume a
01:53 - little bit fast forward to near the end
01:56 - and let's see if it loops
02:00 - and it does cool
02:03 - now in case your web browser doesn't
02:05 - support a certain audio type you can add
02:07 - fallbacks so let's say that we also have
02:10 - a wave version of our audio file I can
02:14 - include that as a fallback right
02:15 - underneath
02:16 - but we should also specify the type just
02:19 - to let the web browser know that this is
02:21 - an MP3 file and that this is a WAV file
02:23 - I'll include the type attribute I will
02:26 - type audio slash MPEG
02:30 - I will also let the web browser know
02:32 - that this is a WAV file audio slash wave
02:35 - so just in case a web browser doesn't
02:38 - support MP3 files I'm pretty sure that
02:40 - they all do nowadays we will resort to
02:42 - our WAV file if we have a backup of the
02:45 - same audio file in wave format let's
02:47 - include our two other audio files so
02:50 - again we need a pair of audio tags
02:55 - within the pair of audio tags we will
02:58 - need a source tag a source element and I
03:01 - will set the source to equal the name of
03:03 - an audio file
03:04 - so let's copy the name of our second
03:07 - audio file
03:08 - including the extension
03:11 - add some controls
03:15 - and there's our second song
03:17 - let me pause the first one
03:19 - [Music]
03:24 - let's add the last one
03:28 - so here's the name of my last song
03:35 - be sure to get the file extension we
03:36 - have our controls
03:39 - and here's my third song
03:41 - I feel like I'm losing my mind
03:46 - hey for fun let's add the name of each
03:49 - of these songs right before the controls
03:52 - I'll use a pair of paragraph tags
03:56 - then I will copy the name of the song
03:58 - and sandwich the name between the
04:00 - paragraph tags
04:01 - so that's the name of my first song
04:04 - let's do this again with the second song
04:11 - and the third
04:19 - so here are my three songs
04:21 - just to make everything a little more
04:22 - organized I'm going to create a music
04:25 - folder within my website folder to hold
04:27 - all of my audio files I will create a
04:29 - new folder I will name this music
04:32 - I'll place all of my audio files within
04:34 - the music folder
04:40 - so we no longer know where the location
04:42 - of those audio files are because we're
04:44 - using a relative file path I'm going to
04:46 - set the source attribute to be music
04:48 - slash the name of the file
04:53 - we can locate those files now
04:55 - so that's our first song our second song
05:00 - and our third song
05:02 - that's how to include audio files in a
05:05 - web page using HTML if you're enjoying
