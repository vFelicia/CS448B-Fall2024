00:24 - groove
00:26 - inset
00:27 - and
00:28 - outset we can change the border width by
00:32 - setting the border width property to
00:35 - some amount of pixels
00:36 - maybe five
00:38 - you can change the border color border
00:41 - dash color and pick a color
00:43 - i like gold let's stick with gold

00:48 - a border radius
00:50 - border dash radius the higher the number
00:53 - the smoother the rounding
00:55 - and i would like to add a little bit of
00:57 - spacing between my letters and my border

01:04 - so we have a little bit of spacing
01:06 - between our text and our border

01:13 - you can specify a border side such as
01:16 - top bottom left right
01:18 - border so we have bottom top left right
01:22 - i will set the border top
01:24 - style to maybe dotted
01:28 - i'll do the same thing with the bottom
01:29 - because i think it'll look cool
01:32 - and maybe the left side as well border
01:35 - left style
01:37 - let's make this
01:39 - i don't know double
01:41 - with the width color and radius you can
01:43 - also specify a side as well so let's
01:46 - change specifically the left border
