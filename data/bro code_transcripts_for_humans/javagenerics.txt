00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's bro
here hope you're doing well and in this
00:03 - video i'm going to be discussing with
you guys generic methods and generic
00:06 - classes in java so sit back relax and
enjoy the show
00:12 - if you find this video helpful please
remember to like comment
00:16 - and subscribe your support will help
keep this channel running
00:20 - alright guys let's talk about generics
so the definition for this
00:24 - is that generics enable types which are
classes and interfaces
00:28 - to be parameters when defining classes
interfaces and methods so a benefit of
00:34 - this
is that it eliminates the need to create
00:37 - multiple versions of methods or classes
for various data types so basically we
00:43 - can use
one version of a method or a class for
00:46 - all
reference data types so let me give you
00:49 - an example
so here's an example for you guys i have
00:52 - four different arrays here
they all have different data types and
00:56 - please note that these are
reference data types so we have an array
01:01 - of integers
doubles characters and strings so we're
01:05 - using the
wrapper class for some of these
01:07 - primitive values such as like integer
double and character so what if we
01:12 - wanted to display all of the elements in
each of these arrays
01:16 - so normally what we would have to do is
to create a method
01:19 - that can handle all of these individual
different data types
01:23 - so let's say for example we have a
method called display
01:27 - array and this accepts an integer
array so this is only compatible with
01:34 - our array of integers
that for our example we just called int
01:38 - array
now if we wanted a similar method for
01:42 - doubles characters and strings
we would have to create another method
01:46 - that can handle each of these different
data types
01:48 - that we have so we'll create another
array
01:52 - this one will accept doubles
so replace integer with double and let's
01:58 - do the same thing
for character and string so character
02:05 - character and then string
02:13 - and then let's just test this so we're
going to call the
02:17 - display array method and let's send in
our integer array
02:24 - then we're going to do the same thing
for double array
02:27 - character array and string
and let's run this so yes this does work
02:41 - but it's kind of inconvenient to have
four separate methods when they
02:45 - basically do the same thing
so here's a crazy idea how about we
02:49 - don't let's create
one version of this method that can
02:52 - handle all reference data types
so let's delete three out of these four
02:56 - methods that we painstakingly created
because we only are going to need one
03:01 - really so
in order to use generics we're going to
03:04 - be discussing both
generic methods and then generic classes
03:07 - so in order to use a generic method
right before the return type we're going
03:11 - to add a set of angle brackets
and then typically if people want to use
03:15 - generics the
common thing to do is just to place the
03:19 - letter t within here
that's just common practice but i like
03:23 - to type in thing just because it helps
me remember that this is a generic
03:27 - so this is now a generic method however
we can still only pass
03:32 - in an array of integers so with the data
type
03:35 - we're going to replace that with
whatever value
03:39 - or text is within these angle brackets
so we're going to accept an array of
03:45 - things
and then we're going to replace integer
03:48 - here as well with
thing or whatever value you placed here
03:52 - and remember it's usually t
that people write here that's just my
03:55 - quirk where i like to write things just
because it helps me remember this
03:59 - and if we were to run this this does the
exact same process as what we had
04:03 - previously
before we used the generic method so
04:07 - this is a i would say a shorthand or
more efficient way to write your code
04:11 - because you don't necessarily need an
individual method
04:14 - for each individual data type that you
have you can just have
04:18 - one version that will accept all
reference data types
04:21 - although you do have the capability of
limiting the data types that are
04:25 - entering into a generic method or class
by a concept called bounded parameters
04:29 - but we'll discuss that later on in this
video
04:32 - so let's create another generic method
but this time it's also going to return
04:36 - something that's generic
so it's going to be a similar process to
04:40 - what we have set up previously with this
generic method
04:43 - so we're going to type in public static
and then this is going to be a generic
04:47 - method so we're going to
type in a set of angle brackets and then
04:51 - people usually write t
here but i like to write thing but you
04:55 - do you i guess
and then with the return type this
04:58 - cannot be void because we're returning
something
05:01 - so we're going to be returning a thing
or whatever text you have within these
05:06 - angle brackets
and then let's name this method let's
05:11 - return the first element within
each of these arrays so let's call this
05:16 - get first for get first element i guess
and then we're going to pass in an array
05:23 - of things
05:26 - so what we're going to be returning is
return
05:30 - our array that we receive with this
parameter
05:34 - at index 0 so it's the first element
and then let's run this so i'm going to
05:39 - turn these into a comment for now
05:44 - so we will system.out.printline
for each of these and then we're going
05:52 - to call the
get first method within the print line
05:56 - statement so get first
and we're going to pass in our different
06:01 - arrays that we have
06:05 - so get first into ray
double array character array
06:12 - and string array
06:17 - and as you can see this works just fine
here's a more practical scenario so
06:22 - figuratively speaking let's say that
we're creating a video game
06:26 - and we have various game sprites that we
want to draw on the screen
06:30 - we have a player an enemy an item and a
tree
06:34 - and we want to display or draw these all
within our game
06:38 - so this really isn't set up you can see
that i've yet to create these classes
06:42 - but this will work just for our scenario
so instead of creating
06:46 - a draw method that can only draw players
another draw method that can only draw
06:50 - enemies another for items and
trees so on and so forth what we would
06:55 - like
is just a generic method it will accept
06:58 - a reference data type or a thing and
just draw it
07:02 - so you can just have one method that
will accept all data types because we
07:06 - really don't want to
have an individual method for all of
07:09 - these separate data types
we want just one method that will take
07:13 - care of everything for us
so that's the real benefit of generic
07:16 - methods let's move on to generic
classes
07:25 - okay guys let's discuss generic classes
so for this example i have a few
07:30 - instances of some classes that we're
going to create in just a moment
07:33 - and each of these classes is going to
store a different value and these all
07:37 - have different data types
so my int will store an integer and
07:42 - we're just going to pass in
one to the constructor my double will
07:46 - pass in maybe 3.14
character the at symbol and then my
07:50 - string will just pass in the word hello
so let's create these actual classes and
07:55 - then we're going to create a generic
class just to compare and contrast the
07:59 - differences between them
so let's create my integer class first
08:03 - so file
new class we'll call this my
08:07 - integer class
08:10 - and all this is going to do is store a
single
08:14 - integer value and we'll call it x and
let's create the constructor for this
08:18 - class so
my integer class and we're going to
08:23 - receive
one argument and that is going to be the
08:26 - value integer
x and we're going to assign this x
08:31 - equals whatever x that we receive and
then let's create a getter method
08:37 - so public and we're not going to type in
void we're going to return
08:41 - an integer public integer
get value
08:49 - and we're going to return x
then let's do the same thing for double
08:55 - character
and straight so i'm just going to fast
08:58 - forward the video at this point
09:24 - all right well welcome back so we have
four different classes one for my
09:28 - integer class my double class my
character class and
09:31 - my string class and they all will hold
one value of each of their respective
09:36 - types
now let's say that we want to display
09:38 - all these values
so we're going to use the first myint
09:42 - dot
get value function and then let's put
09:46 - this within a print line statement so
system.out.printline and then within the
09:51 - parentheses of this print line statement
myint.getvalue
09:56 - and let's do the same thing for my
double my character and
09:59 - my string so my double
my character and my string
10:08 - so this will display all of the values
that we have that we sent to the
10:12 - constructor for each of their respective
classes
10:15 - now let's do the same thing again but
this time instead of creating four
10:18 - different classes
we're going to create one generic class
10:21 - that can hold
all of these different data types so i'm
10:25 - actually going to delete all these
i know it was a lot of work to actually
10:29 - build these but
hey it's for the video so let's get rid
10:33 - of these
and this time we're going to create a
10:37 - generic class that will function
much the same so file
10:42 - new class we'll call this my
generic class
10:49 - finish so to make a class generic
after the class name we're going to add
10:55 - the angle brackets
and then people usually write t within
10:59 - here but i like to write thing like i've
mentioned before
11:02 - so now this is a generic class so now
instead of
11:06 - specifying a specific data type that we
want to store
11:10 - we're going to store a thing so we have
a variable that has a
11:16 - thing data type and then let's create
the constructor for this class
11:19 - so my generic class
and the parameter is that it's going to
11:27 - accept a thing
called x and this
11:32 - x equals x then let's work on the
getter method for this and this was
11:40 - public thing because we're returning a
thing
11:44 - and it is called i already forgot get
value get value
11:52 - return x
and now what we're going to need to do
11:58 - is change integer
double character and string all to
12:02 - generic
to match my generic class so let's just
12:06 - fast forward through this
so these should all say my generic class
12:10 - now and you can see that these are all
underlined and let's take a look
12:14 - so it says that there's a warning here
that the constructor
12:17 - my generic class belongs to raw type
my generic class references to generic
12:23 - type
my generic class then it has the angle
12:27 - brackets with our thing
should be parameterized so what this is
12:31 - telling us is that after these class
definitions
12:34 - we should add the angle brackets and
then list the data
12:38 - type of what we're sending to my generic
class
12:41 - so with this number this integer one we
should list that we're sending
12:46 - this class my generic class and integer
and we're going to do the same thing
12:50 - with double
character and string so
12:56 - double
13:00 - character and string
13:05 - and then just to get rid of this warning
we're going to add a empty set of angle
13:09 - brackets
after this part of the definition
13:15 - all right so this will work the same as
it has before
13:19 - where all of these values are displaying
and we only had to do this with
13:23 - one class one generic class so with
these instances of our generic class you
13:28 - may have noticed that
these are very similar to what we do to
13:32 - declare and instantiate
an arraylist so just as a refresher we
13:36 - create an arraylist by typing in
array list then a set of angle brackets
13:41 - and the data type
of what we're storing within this array
13:44 - list and this has to be a reference data
type
13:47 - so let's store an arraylist of strings
and this will be called
13:52 - my friends and this will currently be
empty
13:55 - so my friends equals new
array list angle brackets parentheses
14:02 - and then we just need to import this so
you can see that the way that we
14:06 - instantiated
this array list is very similar to what
14:10 - we did to create instances of our
generic
14:12 - class we list the class name
the data type within angle brackets of
14:18 - what we're storing
we need a name equals new then the
14:22 - data type again and then let's take a
look at arraylist
14:28 - so here's the class definition for our
arraylist and after the class name you
14:33 - can see that we have the parameter for
our generic
14:36 - class the angle brackets and for this
one it just says
14:39 - e but it really doesn't matter what you
type within the angle brackets
14:43 - so that's why with array lists they're
using a generic
14:46 - class so we can store different
reference data types
14:50 - so we can store strings integers
or even objects it really doesn't matter
14:55 - since this is a generic
class we don't need to find a specific
14:59 - array list that can hold a
singular data type like for example we
15:04 - don't need to find
a particular array list that holds
15:07 - integers then if we want to store
doubles we don't need a different array
15:10 - arraylist
this arraylist is a generic class so we
15:13 - can store whatever
reference data type that we want within
15:16 - it we just have to declare what we're
going to store within it
15:20 - so one thing you should be aware of is
that sometimes with generic
15:24 - classes there can be multiple parameters
so for example between the angle
15:28 - brackets you might see
each value separated with a comma and
15:32 - the second value
is usually named v as a common
15:35 - convention
but i'll just name this thing two just
15:39 - for learning purposes
so my generic class now has two generic
15:44 - parameters
and we can no longer create instances of
15:48 - this class
only by passing in a single value so we
15:52 - also need to list
the second value or the second reference
15:56 - data type that we're sending
to these instances when we construct
16:00 - them
so let's say that to create this
16:04 - instance
of my generic class we're going to pass
16:07 - in
an integer as well as another integer
16:11 - and let's pass in maybe two doubles
16:16 - two characters and then let's mix up the
next one
16:20 - let's say we're going to pass in a
string as well as a character
16:27 - so we're going to set up the constructor
to accept a thing to value or reference
16:34 - data type
so thing two and we'll call this y
16:38 - and let's set up the constructor so
thing
16:42 - two will be y so
this y equals y
16:50 - and let's return
16:54 - y this time and we're going to change
thing to thing
16:57 - two so now we also need to send in
another value
17:02 - of the matching reference data type that
we have
17:06 - so maybe i'll also send in 9
17:10 - 1.01
17:14 - maybe the money sign for the character
so for this one this requires a string
17:20 - and a character
so i need to send in a character this
17:24 - time so maybe
the exclamation point and then let's run
17:29 - this
so it looks like this works just fine we
17:33 - only wanted to return whatever
our y value was and that is the second
17:37 - value that we passed into our
constructors for
17:40 - my generic class so with our generic
classes that have two parameters
17:45 - this is very similar to our lesson on
hashmaps
17:49 - so a hashmap is a collection of key
value pairs
17:53 - and these accept reference data types so
let's say for example we have a
17:58 - hashmap of different users for our
website
18:01 - so we can store maybe an integer this
could be the user id
18:05 - and their string which could be their
username so
18:08 - this is very similar to how we created
our generic
18:12 - classes that have two generic parameters
this time
18:15 - and let's take a look at our hash map
class so this is going to be very
18:19 - similar to
our array list except here that it has
18:23 - two parameters k for probably key
and then v for value but like i said
18:28 - before it really doesn't matter what you
type in here
18:31 - like arraylist hat e and i think that's
for elements
18:34 - but yeah you can see that hash maps also
have two generic parameters
18:38 - same thing with how we set up our my
generic class
18:42 - so one last thing i'm going to introduce
for this video is the concept of
18:46 - bounded types and that allows us to
limit the scope of reference data types
18:50 - that we can send to a generic
18:54 - class
18:58 - so my last topic for this video is to
discuss bounded types
19:02 - so this allows you to create objects of
a generic
19:05 - class to have data of specified derived
types
19:08 - so for example let's take numbers so
with my generic class
19:12 - let's say that we only want to pass in
numbers
19:16 - integers and doubles are fine but we
don't want to send in any characters
19:20 - strings or anything else like that so
what we're going to do
19:24 - after let's say thing we're going to
have this
19:27 - extends the number class so we can send
in
19:30 - any reference data types but it has to
be a subclass of the number class
19:35 - so here's a list for you so here's some
documentation for the
19:39 - number class we have thing extends the
number class
19:43 - so we can pass in any reference data
type as long as it's one of these
19:48 - subclasses and many of these you
probably won't recognize
19:51 - like what the hell is an atomic lung but
you can see here that we have
19:54 - the double class as well as integer
and you probably know of float and long
20:00 - as well even though we really don't use
them too
20:02 - often since thing extends number you can
say that the scope of the reference data
20:07 - types that we can pass in
are limited to just this list any class
20:12 - that is a subclass of the number class
if we had
20:16 - thing extends a different parent class
we would be limited in our scope to a
20:21 - possible different set of subclasses so
that's why with our program we are
20:26 - limited right now
to sending in integers doubles and a few
20:30 - other things from that list
like you can see we can no longer send
20:33 - in characters
and strings for the first value
20:37 - so if we had thing two also extends
the number class we need to send in
20:44 - two reference data types that have
number as a parent class
20:48 - so these first two lines would work just
fine
20:52 - but we can no longer send in two
characters or
20:55 - a string and a character value so let's
just get rid of these for our example
21:00 - and then let's get rid of these as well
and then if we were to run this
21:04 - this will return the second value for
our instances of our generic class so
21:11 - that's pretty much it for this lesson
hopefully your brain didn't explode from
21:14 - all of the information and be sure to
hit that like button before your brain
21:18 - does explode
so yeah if you'd like a copy of
21:20 - everything that we've done i'll post
everything in the comments down below
21:24 - but yeah that's the basics of generics
in java
21:28 - hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you
learn something new
21:32 - then you can help me help you in three
easy steps

hey what's going on everybody it's bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to be discussing with you guys generic methods and generic classes in java so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running alright guys let's talk about generics so the definition for this is that generics enable types which are classes and interfaces to be parameters when defining classes interfaces and methods so a benefit of this is that it eliminates the need to create multiple

want to draw on the screen we have a player an enemy an item and a tree and we want to display or draw these all within our game so this really isn't set up you can see that i've yet to create these classes but this will work just for our scenario so instead of creating a draw method that can only draw players another draw method that can only draw enemies another for items and trees so on and so forth what we would like is just a generic method it will accept a reference data type or a thing and just draw it so you can just have one method that will accept all data types because we really don't want to have an individual method for all of these separate data types we want just one method that will take care of everything for us so that's the real benefit of generic methods let's move on to generic classes okay guys let's discuss generic classes so for this example i have a few instances of some classes that we're going to create in just a moment and each of these classes is going to store a different value and these all have different data types so my int will store an integer and we're just going to pass in one to the constructor my double will pass in maybe 3.14 character the at symbol and then my string will just pass in the word hello so let's create these actual classes and then we're going to create a generic class just to compare and contrast the differences between them so let's create my integer class first so file new class we'll call this my integer class and all this is going to do is store a single integer value and we'll call it x and let's create the constructor for this class so my integer class and we're going to receive one argument and that is going to be the value integer x and we're going to assign this x equals whatever x that we receive and then let's create a getter method so public and we're not going to type in void we're going to return an integer public integer get value and we're going to return x then let's do the same thing for double character and straight so i'm just going to fast forward the video at this point all right well welcome back so we have four different classes one for my integer class my double class my character class and my string class and they all will hold one value of each of their respective types now let's say that we want to display all these values so we're going to use the first myint dot get value function and then let's put this within a print line statement so system.out.printline and then within the parentheses of this print line statement myint.getvalue and let's do the same thing for my double my character and my string so my double my character and my string so this will display all of the values that we have that we sent to the constructor for each of their respective classes now let's do the same thing again but this time instead of creating four different classes we're going to create one generic class that can hold all of these different data types so i'm actually going to delete all these i know it was a lot of work to actually build these but hey it's for the video so let's get rid of these and this time we're going to create a generic class that will function much the same so file new class we'll call this my generic class finish so to make a class generic after the class name we're going to add the angle brackets and then people usually write t within here but i like to write thing like i've mentioned before so now this is a generic class so now instead of specifying a specific data type that we want to store we're going to store a thing so we have a variable that has a thing data type and then let's create the constructor for this class so my generic class and the parameter is that it's going to accept a thing called x and this x equals x then let's work on the getter method for this and this was public thing because we're returning a thing and it is called i already forgot get value get value return x and now what we're going to need to do is change integer double character and string all to generic to match my generic class so let's just fast forward through this so these should all say my generic class now and you can see that these are all underlined and let's take a look so it says that there's a warning here that the constructor my generic class belongs to raw type my generic class references to generic type my generic class then it has the angle brackets with our thing should be parameterized so what this is telling us is that after these class definitions we should add the angle brackets and then list the data type of what we're sending to my generic class so with this number this integer one we should list that we're sending this class my generic class and integer and we're going to do the same thing with double character and string so double character and string and then just to get rid of this warning we're going to add a empty set of angle brackets after this part of the definition all right so this will work the same as it has before where all of these values are displaying and we only had to do this with one class one generic class so with these instances of our generic class you may have noticed that these are very similar to what we do to declare and instantiate an arraylist so just as a refresher we create an arraylist by typing in array list then a set of angle brackets and the data type of what we're storing within this array list and this has to be a reference data type so let's store an arraylist of strings and this will be called my friends and this will currently be empty so my friends equals new array list angle brackets parentheses and then we just need to import this so you can see that the way that we instantiated this array list is very similar to what we did to create instances of our generic class we list the class name the data type within angle brackets of what we're storing we need a name equals new then the data type again and then let's take a look at arraylist so here's the class definition for our arraylist and after the class name you can see that we have the parameter for our generic class the angle brackets and for this one it just says e but it really doesn't matter what you type within the angle brackets so that's why with array lists they're using a generic class so we can store different reference data types so we can store strings integers or even objects it really doesn't matter since this is a generic class we don't need to find a specific array list that can hold a singular data type like for example we don't need to find a particular array list that holds integers then if we want to store doubles we don't need a different array arraylist this arraylist is a generic class so we can store whatever reference data type that we want within it we just have to declare what we're going to store within it so one thing you should be aware of is that sometimes with generic classes there can be multiple parameters so for example between the angle brackets you might see each value separated with a comma and the second value is usually named v as a common convention but i'll just name this thing two just for learning purposes so my generic class now has two generic parameters and we can no longer create instances of this class only by passing in a single value so we also need to list the second value or the second reference data type that we're sending to these instances when we construct them so let's say that to create this instance of my generic class we're going to pass in an integer as well as another integer and let's pass in maybe two doubles two characters and then let's mix up the next one let's say we're going to pass in a string as well as a character so we're going to set up the constructor to accept a thing to value or reference data type so thing two and we'll call this y and let's set up the constructor so thing two will be y so this y equals y and let's return y this time and we're going to change thing to thing two so now we also need to send in another value of the matching reference data type that we have so maybe i'll also send in 9 1.01 maybe the money sign for the character so for this one this requires a string and a character so i need to send in a character this time so maybe the exclamation point and then let's run this so it looks like this works just fine we only wanted to return whatever our y value was and that is the second value that we passed into our constructors for my generic class so with our generic classes that have two parameters this is very similar to our lesson on hashmaps so a hashmap is a collection of key value pairs and these accept reference data types so let's say for example we have a hashmap of different users for our website so we can store maybe an integer this could be the user id and their string which could be their username so this is very similar to how we created our generic classes that have two generic parameters this time and let's take a look at our hash map class so this is going to be very similar to our array list except here that it has two parameters k for probably key and then v for value but like i said before it really doesn't matter what you type in here like arraylist hat e and i think that's for elements but yeah you can see that hash maps also have two generic parameters same thing with how we set up our my generic class so one last thing i'm going to introduce for this video is the concept of bounded types and that allows us to limit the scope of reference data types that we can send to a generic class so my last topic for this video is to discuss bounded types so this allows you to create objects of a generic class to have data of specified derived types so for example let's take numbers so with my generic class let's say that we only want to pass in numbers integers and doubles are fine but we don't want to send in any characters strings or anything else like that so what we're going to do after let's say thing we're going to have this extends the number class so we can send in any reference data types but it has to be a subclass of the number class so here's a list for you so here's some documentation for the number class we have thing extends the number class so we can pass in any reference data type as long as it's one of these subclasses and many of these you probably won't recognize like what the hell is an atomic lung but you can see here that we have the double class as well as integer and you probably know of float and long as well even though we really don't use them too often since thing extends number you can say that the scope of the reference data types that we can pass in are limited to just this list any class that is a subclass of the number class if we had thing extends a different parent class we would be limited in our scope to a possible different set of subclasses so that's why with our program we are limited right now to sending in integers doubles and a few other things from that list like you can see we can no longer send in characters and strings for the first value so if we had thing two also extends the number class we need to send in two reference data types that have number as a parent class so these first two lines would work just fine but we can no longer send in two characters or a string and a character value so let's just get rid of these for our example and then let's get rid of these as well and then if we were to run this this will return the second value for our instances of our generic class so that's pretty much it for this lesson hopefully your brain didn't explode from all of the information and be sure to hit that like button before your brain does explode so yeah if you'd like a copy of everything that we've done i'll post everything in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of generics in java hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro you
