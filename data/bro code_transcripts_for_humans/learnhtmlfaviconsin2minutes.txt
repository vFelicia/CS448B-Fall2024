00:00 - hey everybody today I'm going to show
00:01 - you how we can create a fabicon for your
00:03 - web page to create a favicon you'll need
00:06 - an image to work with here's mine I
00:08 - would recommend an image that's at least
00:10 - 96 by 96 pixels in width and height once
00:14 - you have your image we'll save the image
00:16 - to our website folder I'll right click
00:19 - save image as
00:21 - find my website folder
00:25 - let's rename this image favicon
00:28 - for a favicon most modern web browsers
00:31 - accept Ico PNG GIF JPEG and SVG image
00:36 - files so let's save our image
00:40 - my image is now within my website folder
00:43 - if you do need to make any graphical
00:45 - changes to your image you can always use
00:47 - a program like paint this is a built-in
00:50 - program with most Windows operating
00:51 - systems I'm pretty sure Mac and Linux
00:53 - have something like it too
00:55 - if I do need to change the dimensions on
00:57 - my image I can open it
01:00 - let's find that image it's within my
01:02 - website folder
01:04 - and here it is
01:06 - if you do need to change the size of
01:08 - your image you can go to resize
01:11 - you can either resize or skew your image
01:13 - my image is at least 96 pixels it's 176
01:17 - for both the width and the height then
01:20 - you'll want to save your image
01:21 - afterwards to that website folder
01:26 - once you have your image we're going to
01:28 - create a link tag the link is
01:31 - self-closing
01:32 - the link tag specifies the relationship
01:35 - between this document and an external
01:37 - source
01:39 - the relationship attribute will be icon
01:43 - because well we're adding an icon to our
01:46 - web page
01:48 - the type will equal image slash
01:52 - the type of your file so I have a JPEG
01:54 - I'll list jpg
01:58 - then we need an href attribute
02:00 - that will be the relative file location
02:03 - my image is within my website folder I
02:06 - just have to list the file name
02:09 - fabicon.jpg
02:13 - let's take a look refresh everything
02:15 - and here is my favicon
02:18 - typically with a web page I like to
02:20 - place all of my images within one folder
02:22 - within my website folder I'll create a
02:24 - new folder named images
02:27 - and I'll place my favicon within my
02:30 - images folder
02:32 - so we no longer can locate that favicon
02:35 - I need to change the relative file path
02:37 - of the favicon because it's now within a
02:40 - separate folder
02:41 - preceding the name of my file I will
02:43 - list the folder that it's in Images
02:46 - slash favicon
02:49 - and there it is again
02:51 - all right everybody that's how to create
02:53 - a favicon fear web page using HTML
