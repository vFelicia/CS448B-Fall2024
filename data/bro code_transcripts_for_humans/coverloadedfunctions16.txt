00:00 - else going everybody its bro here hope
00:02 - you're doing well and in this video
00:03 - we're going to be discussing overloaded
00:05 - functions in C++ and at the end of this
00:08 - video we're going to be using overloaded
00:10 - functions to bake some pizzas so let's
00:13 - get into it before you reach the end of
00:17 - this video make sure to LIKE comment and
00:20 - subscribe so that we together can
00:22 - challenge and defeat the mighty YouTube
00:24 - algorithm so basically speaking
00:28 - overloaded functions is this concept
00:30 - that you can reuse a functions name as
00:32 - long as it has different parameter setup
00:35 - and for this example I have two
00:37 - functions both named bake pizza and this
00:39 - is legal because each of these has
00:41 - different parameters this first function
00:43 - accepts one argument as string bread and
00:47 - the other has two parameter setup that
00:49 - accepts two arguments bread and a sauce
00:52 - so this is actually legal then but if
00:55 - these two parameters for each of these
00:57 - functions was the same this would result
00:59 - in errors then so let's try and compile
01:01 - this and run it so it says their word
01:04 - build errors would you like to continue
01:05 - it no I don't so this obviously doesn't
01:07 - work but if we were to have different
01:09 - parameters setup this is actually legal
01:11 - done and you can see that it's already
01:13 - compiling with no problems although it
01:16 - doesn't do anything yet so let's create
01:17 - a program where we will have different
01:20 - overload functions and we can pass in
01:22 - varying amounts of ingredients as
01:24 - arguments so let's begin fresh then
01:27 - let's create a few variables related to
01:30 - pizzas so well we need a bread of some
01:32 - sort and we'll assign this later the
01:35 - values to each of these variables we'll
01:37 - need a string sauce string cheese
01:41 - no pun intended string and a topping all
01:46 - right now let's create four different
01:49 - functions all named baked pizza so let's
01:53 - begin with a function that it takes all
01:55 - four ingredients as arguments so this
01:58 - won't return anything we'll just say
02:00 - void baked pizza then for the parameters
02:06 - we're going to set up four different
02:08 - fields string bread comma string sauce
02:12 - string cheese and string topping and
02:19 - then maybe we'll just display all the
02:21 - ingredients so maybe we'll just see how
02:25 - here is your then we'll list all the
02:29 - ingredients for this pizza see out bread
02:34 - I'll probably add a space between these
02:37 - to see out sauce space see out cheese
02:50 - and lastly see out
02:55 - was it a topping yeah and then we'll
03:02 - just display the word pizza here at the
03:05 - end so pizza okay so that should be good
03:13 - then now we just need to copy this and
03:17 - then we're going to create another
03:19 - function with the same name but a
03:21 - different set of parameters like this
03:23 - one won't have any toppings that also
03:26 - will just take that out and we'll take
03:28 - that out here as well all right then
03:30 - we'll copy this paste it again and this
03:33 - time we will take out the cheese then
03:37 - and seriously who orders pizza without
03:40 - cheese all right and then just plain
03:45 - bread I guess which is kind of silly
03:51 - alright so we have four overloaded
03:55 - functions with for this function named
03:57 - bake pizza then so now we can actually
03:59 - pass in some ingredients but we'll
04:01 - probably want to assign these so for a
04:04 - bread maybe we'll say thick crust and
04:08 - for a sauce I don't really know many
04:12 - sauce name - maybe marinara actually red
04:17 - sauce is probably a more accurate term
04:20 - mozzarella I really don't know how to
04:22 - spell this and then toppings what about
04:26 - pepperoni okay so we have a bunch of
04:31 - ingredients set up now we can call the
04:33 - baked pizza function and send basically
04:37 - any of these values here as arguments so
04:42 - let's say we only want bread sauce and
04:46 - cheese well this will actually pass all
04:50 - of these as arguments then and it will
04:53 - perform whatever code is within each of
04:57 - these functions then so let's try it now
05:02 - so let me expand this a little bit here
05:07 - is your thick crust marinara mozzarella
05:09 - pizza now we can pass in the topping
05:13 - well it's pellet right here is your
05:22 - thick crust marinara mozzarella
05:24 - pepperoni pizza and then we could do
05:27 - just the bread - yep here is your thick
05:34 - crust pizza I just realized that I had a
05:38 - space before the word pizza and I didn't
05:40 - feel like refilling this whole video
05:42 - just to go back and correct that so
05:44 - basically with overloaded functions you
05:46 - can reuse the same function name as long
05:49 - as each of these functions has different
05:51 - parameters set up so this is fairly
05:53 - convenient because you can just call one
05:55 - function and pass in varying arguments
05:58 - depending on what you need so for our
06:00 - baked pizza example we can send whatever
06:03 - ingredients we want and we don't need
06:05 - multiple baked pizza functions like we
06:07 - don't need bake pizza one baked pizza
06:09 - two big pizza three so on and so forth
06:12 - we can just say bake pizza and then pass
06:14 - in the arguments that we want but yeah
06:17 - that's the basics of overloaded
06:19 - functions if you would like a copy of
06:21 - this code I'll post it in the comments
06:22 - down below if you have a program that
06:25 - you're working on that involves
06:26 - overloaded functions feel free to post
06:28 - that in the comments if you want to
06:30 - share it but yeah that's the basics of
06:32 - overloaded functions and C++ hey you
06:36 - yeah I'm talking to you if you learn
06:38 - something new then you can
06:40 - help me help you in three easy steps
06:43 - by smashing that light button drop a
06:45 - comment down below and subscribe if
06:48 - you'd like to become a fellow bro

else going everybody its bro here hope you're doing well and in this video we're going to be discussing overloaded functions in C++ and at the end of this video we're going to be using overloaded
