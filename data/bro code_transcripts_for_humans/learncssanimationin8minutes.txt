00:00 - hey it's you bro hope you're doing well
00:02 - and in this video i'm going to
00:03 - demonstrate a few simple animations
00:05 - using css so sit back relax and enjoy
00:08 - the show
00:11 - hey yeah let's create some very basic
00:13 - animations i'll create a simple box i'll
00:17 - use a div element and give this element
00:19 - a unique id of box one
00:21 - and within this box let's say hi and
00:24 - within our style sheet let's set the box
00:27 - one element to have a width of 250
00:32 - pixels
00:33 - same thing goes with the height
00:36 - let's change the background to maybe red
00:40 - i'll give the font a size of 225
00:45 - and text
00:46 - align
00:48 - center
00:49 - to use an animation we first well have
00:52 - to create an animation
00:53 - and we can do that by using the key
00:56 - frames rule so at keyframes and then
01:00 - follow this with a unique name for your
01:02 - animation for this first example let's
01:04 - have this element slide into place from
01:07 - the right i'll name this my
01:10 - slide something unique two keywords that
01:13 - we can add to our animation are from
01:16 - and two and follow each with a set of
01:18 - curly braces from will be any properties
01:21 - you would like to apply to this element
01:23 - when you begin the animation the two
01:25 - keyword are the ending properties
01:28 - let's have margin
01:29 - left
01:30 - begin at 100 percent
01:33 - so the margin on the left of our element
01:35 - is going to take up 100
01:38 - of the width of our window and this
01:40 - animation will end
01:42 - with margin left
01:45 - being zero percent there will be no
01:48 - margin on the left of this element
01:50 - this will be a gradual transition
01:52 - between these two properties
01:54 - but we have to set a length of time that
01:56 - this animation is going to take
01:58 - but before that we have to specify an
02:00 - animation
02:02 - by setting the animation property to the
02:04 - name of your animation mine is my slide
02:08 - and we need to set a duration
02:11 - animation
02:12 - duration
02:14 - let's say that this entire animation
02:16 - will take five seconds five s
02:20 - and there we go with our keyframes there
02:22 - is a gradual change between these
02:25 - properties
02:26 - anything within from and two we can
02:29 - repeat this animation as many times as
02:31 - what we would like
02:33 - animation
02:35 - iteration
02:37 - count
02:38 - you can set this to 1
02:39 - 2 3
02:41 - or infinite
02:43 - so this animation will loop when you set
02:46 - the animation iteration count to
02:48 - infinite a couple other things you can
02:50 - do too you can add animation
02:52 - play
02:54 - state
02:56 - and the default is running
02:59 - but you can set this to paused
03:02 - and the animation will pause in place
03:04 - but let's keep that at running
03:07 - you can add a delay
03:08 - animation
03:10 - delay
03:12 - maybe we'll have this begin after one
03:13 - second so it's been one second then the
03:15 - animation begins
03:17 - i'll keep that at zero
03:19 - okay this next one
03:20 - is animation
03:22 - timing
03:23 - function
03:25 - so right now our animation is occurring
03:27 - linearly we could have this is
03:30 - in so this accelerates
03:34 - but doesn't slow down
03:36 - ease out
03:38 - where we begin quickly and then slowly
03:41 - decelerate
03:43 - ease will do both it accelerates and
03:46 - then decelerates near the end or linear
03:51 - where it's a constant animation
03:56 - there is a shortcut where you can apply
03:58 - all six of these properties and just to
04:00 - demonstrate i will place all of these
04:02 - within one giant comment block so
04:05 - beginning in this order we begin with
04:07 - the duration
04:08 - this time let's say three seconds
04:11 - then the timing function linear
04:15 - a delay if you need one i will keep that
04:17 - as zero
04:19 - the iteration count
04:21 - that will be infinite
04:23 - the place date
04:24 - running
04:25 - then the animation
04:27 - my slide so this is a shortcut where you
04:30 - can combine all six of these separate
04:32 - properties
04:33 - you can also place this animation within
04:36 - a pseudo class
04:38 - in this next example i would like this
04:40 - element to only be animated while i have
04:43 - the cursor over this element so i can
04:46 - use a pseudo class for that so box 1 and
04:50 - the pseudo class of hover and i will
04:52 - place my animation within that pseudo
04:55 - class
04:56 - and then we should probably switch these
04:57 - margins around so that it slides to the
05:00 - right instead this animation will begin
05:02 - if i place my cursor over this image or
05:05 - we can set this to active
05:09 - it's going to play if i click on it
05:11 - box 1
05:12 - colon
05:14 - active
05:15 - and then let's place our animation
05:17 - within it so nothing's happening until i
05:19 - click down on this image but once i let
05:21 - go the animation ends
05:23 - so you can combine animations with
05:26 - pseudo classes
05:27 - let's create a couple more animations
05:29 - how about a rotation let's name this my
05:33 - rotate so you can use percentages too
05:36 - you don't necessarily have to use both
05:38 - from and to let's say that once this
05:41 - animation reaches 100
05:44 - i would like to apply the transform
05:47 - property
05:48 - and we will perform an x rotation of 360
05:53 - degrees
05:55 - so let's set the animation to my rotate
06:00 - so that is an x rotation
06:03 - let's do this with y
06:08 - and let's get rid of that
06:12 - here is a y rotation
06:14 - and a z rotation
06:16 - let's change the opacity so at key
06:19 - frames
06:20 - my opacity
06:25 - okay this time we will set this to 50
06:29 - then your animation will have these
06:31 - properties revert to what they
06:33 - originally were when you began the
06:34 - animation so at fifty percent let's set
06:37 - the opacity
06:39 - to zero
06:42 - so this will fade out then fade in
06:44 - see if i set this to one hundred percent
06:47 - this will fade out slowly
06:49 - and then snap back into place but if you
06:52 - set it to 50 there will be a gradual
06:54 - transition
06:55 - and then it's going to revert back after
06:57 - 50
06:58 - let's change the scale of our element
07:01 - at
07:02 - keyframes my scale
07:06 - let's have our image shrink
07:09 - and then grow back in place using
07:11 - transform
07:14 - scale
07:16 - 0.5 0.5
07:23 - so this will shrink
07:25 - and then grow
07:26 - and lastly let's change the colors this
07:28 - will be a challenge round
07:30 - keyframes
07:32 - my color change
07:35 - we'll go through the colors red orange
07:37 - yellow green blue and purple
07:40 - so let's have this begin at
07:42 - zero percent we will have the background
07:46 - color
07:47 - be red
07:48 - then at 20
07:51 - this will be orange
07:55 - 40 will be yellow
07:59 - 60 will be green
08:02 - 80 will be blue
08:05 - and 100
08:07 - will be purple
08:10 - actually since our element is beginning
08:12 - as the color red we don't necessarily
08:14 - need this specific portion
08:16 - okay let's try this my color change
08:20 - so we should be able to go through these
08:21 - colors
08:23 - and then it becomes red again at the end
08:26 - so yeah those are some simple animations
08:29 - in order to use an animation you have to
08:31 - create an animation so you use at
08:33 - keyframes and then come up with a unique
08:35 - animation name and then set some
08:37 - properties on what you need exactly so
08:40 - yeah those are some very basic
08:42 - animations in css if this video helped
08:45 - you out you can help me out by smashing
08:47 - that like button leave random comments
08:49 - down below and subscribe if you'd like
08:50 - to become a fellow bro

Cleaned transcript:

hey it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to demonstrate a few simple animations using css so sit back relax and enjoy the show hey yeah let's create some very basic animations i'll create a simple box i'll use a div element and give this element a unique id of box one and within this box let's say hi and within our style sheet let's set the box one element to have a width of 250 pixels same thing goes with the height let's change the background to maybe red i'll give the font a size of 225 and text align center to use an animation we first well have to create an animation and we can do that by using the key frames rule so at keyframes and then follow this with a unique name for your animation for this first example let's have this element slide into place from the right i'll name this my slide something unique two keywords that we can add to our animation are from and two and follow each with a set of curly braces from will be any properties you would like to apply to this element when you begin the animation the two keyword are the ending properties let's have margin left begin at 100 percent so the margin on the left of our element is going to take up 100 of the width of our window and this animation will end with margin left being zero percent there will be no margin on the left of this element this will be a gradual transition between these two properties but we have to set a length of time that this animation is going to take but before that we have to specify an animation by setting the animation property to the name of your animation mine is my slide and we need to set a duration animation duration let's say that this entire animation will take five seconds five s and there we go with our keyframes there is a gradual change between these properties anything within from and two we can repeat this animation as many times as what we would like animation iteration count you can set this to 1 2 3 or infinite so this animation will loop when you set the animation iteration count to infinite a couple other things you can do too you can add animation play state and the default is running but you can set this to paused and the animation will pause in place but let's keep that at running you can add a delay animation delay maybe we'll have this begin after one second so it's been one second then the animation begins i'll keep that at zero okay this next one is animation timing function so right now our animation is occurring linearly we could have this is in so this accelerates but doesn't slow down ease out where we begin quickly and then slowly decelerate ease will do both it accelerates and then decelerates near the end or linear where it's a constant animation there is a shortcut where you can apply all six of these properties and just to demonstrate i will place all of these within one giant comment block so beginning in this order we begin with the duration this time let's say three seconds then the timing function linear a delay if you need one i will keep that as zero the iteration count that will be infinite the place date running then the animation my slide so this is a shortcut where you can combine all six of these separate properties you can also place this animation within a pseudo class in this next example i would like this element to only be animated while i have the cursor over this element so i can use a pseudo class for that so box 1 and the pseudo class of hover and i will place my animation within that pseudo class and then we should probably switch these margins around so that it slides to the right instead this animation will begin if i place my cursor over this image or we can set this to active it's going to play if i click on it box 1 colon active and then let's place our animation within it so nothing's happening until i click down on this image but once i let go the animation ends so you can combine animations with pseudo classes let's create a couple more animations how about a rotation let's name this my rotate so you can use percentages too you don't necessarily have to use both from and to let's say that once this animation reaches 100 i would like to apply the transform property and we will perform an x rotation of 360 degrees so let's set the animation to my rotate so that is an x rotation let's do this with y and let's get rid of that here is a y rotation and a z rotation let's change the opacity so at key frames my opacity okay this time we will set this to 50 then your animation will have these properties revert to what they originally were when you began the animation so at fifty percent let's set the opacity to zero so this will fade out then fade in see if i set this to one hundred percent this will fade out slowly and then snap back into place but if you set it to 50 there will be a gradual transition and then it's going to revert back after 50 let's change the scale of our element at keyframes my scale let's have our image shrink and then grow back in place using transform scale 0.5 0.5 so this will shrink and then grow and lastly let's change the colors this will be a challenge round keyframes my color change we'll go through the colors red orange yellow green blue and purple so let's have this begin at zero percent we will have the background color be red then at 20 this will be orange 40 will be yellow 60 will be green 80 will be blue and 100 will be purple actually since our element is beginning as the color red we don't necessarily need this specific portion okay let's try this my color change so we should be able to go through these colors and then it becomes red again at the end so yeah those are some simple animations in order to use an animation you have to create an animation so you use at keyframes and then come up with a unique animation name and then set some properties on what you need exactly so yeah those are some very basic animations in css if this
