00:00 - yo what's going on everybody it's you
00:02 - bro hope you're doing well and in this
00:03 - video i'm going to show you all how
00:05 - radio buttons work in java fx
00:07 - so sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:12 - now the idea behind radio buttons is
00:14 - that we can only select one radio button
00:16 - from any one group
00:18 - let's say that i'm going to buy you
00:19 - lunch because i'm a nice guy
00:21 - and you have to pick only one item from
00:23 - the menu
00:24 - so we'll create a group of radio buttons
00:26 - to represent a sort of menu
00:28 - we'll just create three radio buttons
00:30 - just to keep things simple
00:31 - for the first item on our menu let's say
00:34 - we have pizza
00:35 - i'm going to change the text to pizza
00:38 - and i'll increase the font size too just
00:39 - so that we can read it
00:40 - okay so that's our first radio button we
00:43 - need to add all
00:44 - of our radio buttons to the same group
00:46 - so for the toggle group
00:47 - let's save food because we're creating
00:49 - radio buttons based on food
00:51 - and if you want you can have this be
00:53 - selected by default
00:54 - just by clicking this check box but i
00:57 - will keep it empty for now
00:59 - now i'm going to give this radio button
01:00 - a unique id let's say our
01:03 - button 1 then on action is the method
01:06 - that will be called when we select this
01:08 - radio button
01:09 - we still need to define it but let's say
01:11 - we'll have
01:12 - a method named get food okay so that is
01:15 - it for our first radio button i'm going
01:17 - to copy and paste it
01:19 - and create our second radio button
01:23 - for our second item on our menu let's
01:24 - say we have sushi
01:28 - make sure that the toggle group is set
01:31 - to food we want all of these radio
01:32 - buttons to be within the same toggle
01:34 - group
01:36 - then underneath id let's set this to
01:40 - r button two and make sure on action
01:44 - is set to get food okay let's create our
01:48 - last radio button
01:52 - how about ramen
01:55 - and let's change the id to r button
01:59 - three on action is set to get food which
02:02 - we'll define later
02:03 - and this should be in the same toggle
02:05 - group of food
02:07 - okay well we have our radio buttons what
02:09 - do we want to do exactly with them
02:11 - let's say that we would like to change
02:13 - the text of a label when we select one
02:16 - of these
02:16 - radio buttons so i'm going to create a
02:18 - label
02:19 - drag and drop it i'll place it near the
02:21 - center
02:23 - and for the text let's say select
02:26 - an item or better yet
02:29 - select what you want to eat
02:34 - okay i'm going to center this
02:39 - increase the font size
02:44 - and maybe 36 okay then
02:47 - center it and i'm going to give this
02:50 - label a unique id
02:52 - my label okay let's make sure that our
02:57 - controller class is linked
03:00 - and i'm going to save and let's head to
03:02 - our controller class
03:04 - okay now i'm going to head to my
03:06 - controller class and we will inject our
03:08 - fxml document for each of these
03:10 - different ids that we have
03:11 - so we have a label private label
03:15 - my label
03:18 - and we also have all of those radio
03:20 - buttons at fxml
03:23 - private radio button
03:27 - r button one comma
03:30 - r button two and r
03:33 - button three okay we need to declare
03:37 - that method of get food
03:39 - so public void get
03:42 - food and the one parameter
03:46 - is action event
03:49 - event so whenever we select one of those
03:52 - radio buttons it's going to call
03:54 - this method here but we're not sure
03:56 - which button was selected exactly
03:58 - so we can check that using a series of
04:00 - if statements if
04:01 - else so let's say if radio button 1
04:08 - dot is selected
04:13 - then let's change our label so my
04:17 - label dot set text
04:20 - we could say just the word pizza
04:24 - otherwise we can get the text from the
04:26 - radio button too that's another option
04:29 - so if we take that route it would be r
04:32 - button one
04:33 - dot get text
04:36 - okay let's write an elsif statement
04:40 - else if our button two is selected
04:49 - then we will take my label and set the
04:52 - text
04:53 - equal to r button two dot get text
04:57 - and then here we can use else or else if
05:00 - doesn't matter i suppose
05:03 - if r button three is selected
05:08 - we will change the text of my label
05:11 - to r button three dot get text
05:16 - and that should be everything let's run
05:18 - this
05:21 - okay select what you want to eat i would
05:23 - like pizza
05:25 - actually i changed my mind i want sushi
05:28 - but ramen's pretty good too i'll select
05:30 - ramen
05:31 - so that's kind of the idea behind radio
05:33 - buttons we can only select
05:34 - one radio button from any one group so
05:37 - if you would like a copy of all this
05:38 - code i will post this to the comment
05:40 - section down below
05:41 - but yeah those are how radio buttons
05:43 - work in javafx

yo what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to show you all how radio buttons work in java fx so sit back relax and enjoy the show now the idea behind radio buttons is that we can only select one radio button from any one group let's say that i'm going to buy you lunch because i'm a nice guy and you have to pick only one item from the menu so we'll create a group of radio buttons to represent a sort of menu we'll just create three radio buttons just to keep things simple for the first item on our menu let's say we have pizza i'm going to change the text to pizza and i'll increase the font size too just so that we can read it okay so that's our first radio button we need to add all of our radio buttons to the same group so for the toggle group let's save food because we're creating radio buttons based on food and if you want you can have this be selected by default just by clicking this check box but i will keep it empty for now now i'm going to give this radio button a unique id let's say our button 1 then on action is the method that will be called when we select this radio button we still need to define it but let's say we'll have a method named get food okay so that is it for our first radio button i'm going to copy and paste it and create our second radio button for our second item on our menu let's say we have sushi make sure that the toggle group is set to food we want all of these radio buttons to be within the same toggle group then underneath id let's set this to r button two and make sure on action is set to get food okay let's create our last radio button how about ramen and let's change the id to r button three on action is set to get food which we'll define later and this should be in the same toggle group of food okay well we have our radio buttons what do we want to do exactly with them let's say that we would like to change the text of a label when we select one of these radio buttons so i'm going to create a label drag and drop it i'll place it near the center and for the text let's say select an item or better yet select what you want to eat okay i'm going to center this increase the font size and maybe 36 okay then center it and i'm going to give this label a unique id my label okay let's make sure that our controller class is linked and i'm going to save and let's head to our controller class okay now i'm going to head to my controller class and we will inject our fxml document for each of these different ids that we have so we have a label private label my label and we also have all of those radio buttons at fxml private radio button r button one comma r button two and r button three okay we need to declare that method of get food so public void get food and the one parameter is action event event so whenever we select one of those radio buttons it's going to call this method here but we're not sure which button was selected exactly so we can check that using a series of if statements if else so let's say if radio button 1 dot is selected then let's change our label so my label dot set text we could say just the word pizza otherwise we can get the text from the radio button too that's another option so if we take that route it would be r button one dot get text okay let's write an elsif statement else if our button two is selected then we will take my label and set the text equal to r button two dot get text and then here we can use else or else if doesn't matter i suppose if r button three is selected we will change the text of my label to r button three dot get text and that should be everything let's run this okay select what you want to eat i would like pizza actually i changed my mind i want sushi but ramen's pretty good too i'll select ramen so that's kind of the idea behind radio buttons we can only select one radio button from any one group so if you would like a copy of all this code i will post this to the comment section down below but yeah those are how radio buttons work in javafx
