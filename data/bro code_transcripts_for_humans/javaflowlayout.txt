00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's your
00:01 - bro here hope you're doing well and in
00:03 - this video i'm going to teach you guys
00:04 - how the flow
00:05 - layout manager works in java so sit back
00:07 - relax and enjoy the show
00:11 - if you find this video helpful please
00:13 - remember to like
00:14 - comment and subscribe your support will
00:17 - help keep this channel running
00:19 - well the flow layout it places
00:21 - components in a row
00:23 - sized at their preferred size if the
00:25 - horizontal space in the container is too
00:28 - small
00:28 - then the flow layout class uses the next
00:31 - available row
00:32 - so we'll need a frame i'm just going to
00:34 - paste what i had previously
00:36 - so jframe frame equals new jframe
00:39 - frame dot set default close operation j
00:42 - frame x and on close
00:44 - set your preferred size and then frame
00:46 - dot set visible true
00:48 - to set up a frame or other container
00:50 - class with a flow layout
00:53 - we use a certain function called set
00:56 - layout
00:56 - and then we pass in a new layout
00:59 - manager so new flow
01:02 - layout so by default frames use a border
01:06 - layout
01:06 - so this time we're setting this with a
01:09 - flow layout
01:10 - now we'll need to add some components to
01:12 - this frame to demonstrate the effects of
01:14 - a flow layout
01:14 - so let's create some buttons so j button
01:17 - we'll call this button one
01:19 - equals new j button
01:23 - all right so i'm going to show you guys
01:24 - a shortcut too for creating components
01:27 - uh so let's say that we're adding this
01:30 - button to the frame
01:31 - so frame dot add then we say button one
01:34 - right
01:34 - uh one shortcut that we can do just to
01:36 - save time is that instead of
01:38 - calling this by name we can just say new
01:41 - j button
01:42 - and pass this in to the frame when we
01:45 - add this
01:45 - and then we can give this like a number
01:48 - if we wanted to
01:49 - so this will create a new j button for
01:51 - us
01:53 - all right so one problem that you might
01:54 - run into is that sometimes these
01:56 - components don't always display
01:58 - if you set the visibility to true before
02:01 - you actually add the components so
02:03 - actually if we were to move this window
02:04 - this button appears uh so i'm just going
02:06 - to
02:07 - set the visibility at the very end so we
02:09 - don't uh run into any problems
02:11 - so then this should display right away
02:14 - there it is all right let's create a
02:16 - bunch of buttons to demonstrate this
02:18 - so i'm going to copy this line of code
02:21 - where we create a new j button and now
02:23 - this is the frame
02:24 - maybe like nine times or so
02:27 - so we'll call this button two
02:30 - three four five six
02:33 - seven eight nine all right so we should
02:37 - have
02:37 - nine buttons now and they're all
02:40 - centered within the top row
02:42 - so with flow layouts if they run out of
02:46 - room
02:46 - within their first row the components
02:49 - will be pushed down to the next row kind
02:51 - of
02:51 - like this
02:55 - pretty sweet right so it's kind of like
02:56 - a waterfall or something it's flowing
02:59 - like water so we can also set
03:02 - an alignment for these components so
03:05 - when you pass in a new flow layout
03:07 - you can type in flow
03:11 - layout dot and if you want this to start
03:14 - on the left you can say leading and
03:15 - there's a few options here
03:18 - so now what these components do is that
03:20 - they stick to the
03:21 - left hand side they're leading
03:24 - and if you were to expand this frame
03:27 - they will stay in the top left corner
03:29 - and then when you compress this frame
03:32 - they will be pushed down
03:34 - so the default is actually center
03:38 - so we should see no change with what we
03:40 - had previously
03:42 - where they will all stay in the center
03:44 - and there's also trailing
03:46 - as well so let's switch this to trailing
03:54 - and now they will stick to the right
03:56 - hand side and if you were to compress
03:58 - this frame
04:00 - they will be pushed down you can also
04:02 - set the horizontal and vertical gaps
04:05 - between the components too so i'm going
04:08 - to change this back to center
04:10 - to set some spacing you pass in some
04:12 - integers when you actually create a new
04:15 - flow layout
04:16 - so the first number is the horizontal
04:19 - spacing and the second number
04:21 - is the vertical spacing so if we set
04:23 - these both to zero
04:24 - these buttons are going to be which they
04:28 - are
04:29 - so let's set the vertical spacing
04:32 - to 10.
04:36 - so now we have 10 pixels worth of space
04:39 - around the components and then let's set
04:42 - the horizontal spacing to also 10
04:46 - so now we have extra spacing between
04:48 - these components
04:49 - with layout managers you can also add
04:51 - layout managers to panels
04:53 - so let's create a panel and add all of
04:55 - these buttons
04:56 - to our panel then add the panel to the
04:58 - frame so we'll need to create a panel
05:00 - and set this up with a
05:02 - flow layout manager so let's create a
05:04 - panel
05:05 - jpanel we'll call this panel equals new
05:08 - j panel then let's set a size for this
05:12 - panel as well so
05:13 - panel dot set preferred size we need to
05:16 - pass in the dimensions
05:18 - by saying new dimension
05:22 - let's say this is 250 by 250
05:25 - and let's set the background color so we
05:27 - can better see this panel dot set
05:29 - background let's say light
05:33 - gray so color dot light gray
05:40 - all right so then with these buttons
05:43 - we're going to be adding these
05:44 - to the panel in place of the frame so
05:47 - one shortcut that you can do
05:48 - if you're using the eclipse ide select
05:51 - all of the code that you want to edit
05:52 - if you want to replace a certain word
05:55 - you can go to edit
05:57 - find replace i'm going to replace the
05:59 - word frame with
06:00 - panel and then replace all
06:04 - all right so we're going to be adding
06:06 - these buttons
06:07 - to the panel uh however we still need to
06:09 - set the layout manager for the panel
06:11 - because i forgot to do that so panel
06:13 - dot set layout
06:17 - and then we are passing in a new flow
06:19 - layout
06:20 - new flow layout and actually by default
06:23 - panels already use a flow layout but i'm
06:26 - just doing this again for teaching
06:27 - purposes
06:28 - so this panel has a flow layout and
06:31 - we're adding all of the buttons
06:33 - to the panel this time and then we need
06:35 - to add the panel to the frame
06:36 - so frame dot add panel
06:41 - so this is what this looks like now
06:46 - this panel is acting as the container
06:48 - and since these buttons
06:50 - ran out of room within the first row the
06:53 - next set of buttons got pushed down to
06:54 - the next row
06:55 - and if we were to change the width of
06:57 - this panel it's going to push the
06:59 - buttons down
07:00 - even further down further rows so let's
07:03 - set the width to now 100
07:06 - so these buttons are pushed down even
07:08 - further because
07:09 - this panel is using a flow layout just
07:12 - like
07:13 - what the frame was using in the previous
07:14 - example
07:16 - so that's the basics of the flow layout
07:18 - manager if you want to copy of all this
07:20 - code i'll post all of this in the
07:21 - comments down below
07:22 - but yeah that's the basics of the flow
07:25 - layout manager
07:26 - in java hey you yeah i'm talking to you
07:29 - if you learn something new
07:31 - then you can help me help you in three
07:34 - easy steps
07:35 - by smashing that like button drop a
07:37 - comment down below
07:38 - and subscribe if you'd like to become a
07:40 - fellow bro
07:46 - [Music]
08:01 - you

hey what's going on everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how the flow layout manager works in java so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running well the flow layout it places components in a row sized at their preferred size if the horizontal space in the container is too small then the flow layout class uses the next available row so we'll need a frame i'm just going to paste what i had previously so jframe frame equals new jframe frame dot set default close operation j frame x and on close set your preferred size and then frame dot set visible true to set up a frame or other container class with a flow layout we use a certain function called set layout and then we pass in a new layout manager so new flow layout so by default frames use a border layout so this time we're setting this with a flow layout now we'll need to add some components to this frame to demonstrate the effects of a flow layout so let's create some buttons so j button we'll call this button one equals new j button all right so i'm going to show you guys a shortcut too for creating components uh so let's say that we're adding this button to the frame so frame dot add then we say button one right uh one shortcut that we can do just to save time is that instead of calling this by name we can just say new j button and pass this in to the frame when we add this and then we can give this like a number if we wanted to so this will create a new j button for us all right so one problem that you might run into is that sometimes these components don't always display if you set the visibility to true before you actually add the components so actually if we were to move this window this button appears uh so i'm just going to set the visibility at the very end so we don't uh run into any problems so then this should display right away there it is all right let's create a bunch of buttons to demonstrate this so i'm going to copy this line of code where we create a new j button and now this is the frame maybe like nine times or so so we'll call this button two three four five six seven eight nine all right so we should have nine buttons now and they're all centered within the top row so with flow layouts if they run out of room within their first row the components will be pushed down to the next row kind of like this pretty sweet right so it's kind of like a waterfall or something it's flowing like water so we can also set an alignment for these components so when you pass in a new flow layout you can type in flow layout dot and if you want this to start on the left you can say leading and there's a few options here so now what these components do is that they stick to the left hand side they're leading and if you were to expand this frame they will stay in the top left corner and then when you compress this frame they will be pushed down so the default is actually center so we should see no change with what we had previously where they will all stay in the center and there's also trailing as well so let's switch this to trailing and now they will stick to the right hand side and if you were to compress this frame they will be pushed down you can also set the horizontal and vertical gaps between the components too so i'm going to change this back to center to set some spacing you pass in some integers when you actually create a new flow layout so the first number is the horizontal spacing and the second number is the vertical spacing so if we set these both to zero these buttons are going to be which they are so let's set the vertical spacing to 10. so now we have 10 pixels worth of space around the components and then let's set the horizontal spacing to also 10 so now we have extra spacing between these components with layout managers you can also add layout managers to panels so let's create a panel and add all of these buttons to our panel then add the panel to the frame so we'll need to create a panel and set this up with a flow layout manager so let's create a panel jpanel we'll call this panel equals new j panel then let's set a size for this panel as well so panel dot set preferred size we need to pass in the dimensions by saying new dimension let's say this is 250 by 250 and let's set the background color so we can better see this panel dot set background let's say light gray so color dot light gray all right so then with these buttons we're going to be adding these to the panel in place of the frame so one shortcut that you can do if you're using the eclipse ide select all of the code that you want to edit if you want to replace a certain word you can go to edit find replace i'm going to replace the word frame with panel and then replace all all right so we're going to be adding these buttons to the panel uh however we still need to set the layout manager for the panel because i forgot to do that so panel dot set layout and then we are passing in a new flow layout new flow layout and actually by default panels already use a flow layout but i'm just doing this again for teaching purposes so this panel has a flow layout and we're adding all of the buttons to the panel this time and then we need to add the panel to the frame so frame dot add panel so this is what this looks like now this panel is acting as the container and since these buttons ran out of room within the first row the next set of buttons got pushed down to the next row and if we were to change the width of this panel it's going to push the buttons down even further down further rows so let's set the width to now 100 so these buttons are pushed down even further because this panel is using a flow layout just like what the frame was using in the previous example so that's the basics of the flow layout manager if you want to copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of the flow layout manager in java hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro you
