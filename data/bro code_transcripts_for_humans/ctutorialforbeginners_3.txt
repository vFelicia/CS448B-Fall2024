00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's you
00:02 - bro hope you're doing well
00:03 - and in this video i'm going to show you
00:04 - all everything you need to know to get
00:06 - started writing code in c-sharp
00:08 - so sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:13 - if you wouldn't mind please like comment
00:15 - and subscribe
00:16 - one like equals one prayer for the
00:18 - youtube algorithm
00:20 - i'm gonna tell you why you need to learn
00:22 - c sharp c
00:23 - sharp is a very flexible language we can
00:26 - use c
00:27 - sharp for all sorts of things console
00:29 - apps web services
00:31 - games and if you're an aspiring game
00:32 - developer c sharp is definitely a
00:34 - language you want to learn
00:36 - along with c plus but why not learn both
00:38 - and the average salary for a c-sharp
00:41 - developer if you have some experience
00:43 - is 63 000 per year according to
00:45 - glassdoor
00:46 - if that all sounds good let's begin to
00:48 - code with c-sharp we'll need an ide
00:51 - that's an integrated development
00:52 - environment think of it as software that
00:54 - helps us write other software
00:56 - one that i would recommend is visual
00:58 - studio community
00:59 - so you can just google that then head to
01:01 - this url at the top here
01:03 - okay then we are going to download
01:05 - visual studio and just follow the
01:07 - installation procedures
01:08 - so let's open this and run it so
01:11 - continue and here we have a bunch of
01:13 - different packages that we can download
01:14 - you'll want to check
01:15 - dot net desktop development for using c
01:18 - sharp
01:19 - and if you're interested in using unity
01:20 - you might as well just download this
01:22 - package too
01:23 - then we are going to install you have
01:25 - the option to sign in but i'm just going
01:27 - to click not now maybe later
01:29 - you can also pick a color theme for your
01:30 - ide i'm going to go with dark because i
01:32 - like to feel like a pretend elite hacker
01:35 - then start visual studio now with this
01:37 - home screen we'll continue without code
01:39 - i'll show you all how we can create a
01:40 - new project
01:41 - all right now to create a new project
01:43 - we'll go to file
01:45 - new project select c sharp
01:48 - console application next we'll need a
01:51 - name for this project
01:52 - i'll call this my first
01:55 - program next then create
01:58 - all right now this font size is very
02:01 - small you can either zoom in here down
02:03 - at the bottom or you can change the font
02:05 - as well as the font size by going to
02:07 - tools options environment
02:10 - fonts and colors and you can change the
02:12 - size here what about
02:14 - 18 and we should be good and here we
02:17 - have a small program that was created
02:19 - for us automatically all this does
02:21 - is display some output the words hello
02:24 - world
02:24 - to compile and run a program you just
02:26 - have to click this green play button at
02:28 - the top
02:30 - and this will create a console window
02:32 - that displays our output of
02:34 - hello world whatever we have written
02:36 - here within quotes
02:37 - and this line of code is known as the
02:40 - main method
02:40 - it's the entry point for where our
02:42 - program begins
02:44 - and this set of curly braces after the
02:46 - main method is
02:47 - the body of the main method so our
02:49 - program
02:50 - will begin by executing any code at the
02:52 - top of the main method
02:53 - and it will work its way down and
02:55 - execute any subsequent code that follows
02:58 - so this main method is made up of a
02:59 - bunch of words that we don't quite
03:01 - understand yet
03:02 - static void main string args in time
03:05 - we'll learn what each of these words
03:06 - mean but that's more of an advanced
03:08 - topic
03:09 - so a textbook that i read once said to
03:11 - think of the main method
03:12 - as like a magical spell or incantation
03:15 - that we have to say
03:16 - in order for our program to run so let's
03:18 - see what happens if i remove the main
03:20 - method
03:20 - i'll still keep this line though
03:22 - console.writeline hello world
03:24 - and let's try it okay so it looks like
03:27 - there were build errors so we cannot run
03:29 - the program as it is now
03:30 - so we do need that main method and if
03:32 - you are missing it you can just type it
03:34 - in
03:34 - and it should work now now this is a
03:37 - standard
03:38 - writeline method whatever text that we
03:40 - put within quotes will appear within
03:42 - our console window to display as output
03:45 - so let's actually change it right now it
03:47 - says hello world but let's type
03:48 - something else
03:49 - so make sure that this is within double
03:51 - quotes let's change this to
03:53 - i like pizza
03:56 - and then run this again
04:00 - so now my output should say i like pizza
04:03 - and then you can add a second line of
04:04 - output just by writing
04:06 - console.writeline then within
04:08 - parentheses and within double quotes you
04:10 - can write something else
04:11 - like it's really
04:14 - good and now we have two lines of output
04:17 - i like pizza
04:18 - it's really good so to write output to
04:21 - the console window you type
04:23 - console.writeline then within quotes
04:25 - some text that you want to write one
04:27 - thing that you may want to change
04:29 - is the font and the font size of your
04:31 - console window because right now it's
04:33 - very difficult for me to read
04:35 - so to change that right click in the top
04:37 - left corner go to properties
04:40 - then go to font let's increase this to
04:42 - maybe 28
04:43 - you can pick a new font style as well
04:45 - i'll keep it the same
04:46 - then you can also change the color
04:48 - scheme too i'll change the screen text
04:50 - to maybe
04:51 - green then okay all right but now this
04:54 - window is huge so let's change that
04:56 - so again go to the top left corner go to
05:00 - properties
05:01 - then go to layout let's change the width
05:04 - to
05:04 - what about i don't know 50 and the
05:06 - height to
05:08 - let's say 15 i think that should be good
05:12 - okay yeah that's not too bad and here
05:14 - it's actually a lot easier to read
05:16 - i like pizza it's really good oh one
05:19 - last stupid thing that i wanted to show
05:20 - you all is how we can make our console
05:22 - beep
05:23 - type console dot beep parentheses
05:26 - semicolon so then our program is going
05:29 - to beep when it reaches the end
05:32 - it's not really important at all i just
05:34 - thought it would be something fun to
05:35 - throw in at the end of this video
05:37 - so that's how to make your console beep
05:38 - for some reason
05:40 - all right well that's the very basics of
05:42 - c sharp to get you started in the next
05:44 - video we'll cover more on
05:46 - output and comments so i'll post this
05:49 - code to the comment section down below
05:51 - and well that's the very basics to get
05:53 - you started in
05:54 - c sharp hey you yeah i'm talking to you
05:58 - if you learned something new then help
06:00 - me help you in three easy steps
06:03 - by smashing that like button drop a
06:05 - comment down below
06:06 - and subscribe if you'd like to become a
06:08 - fellow bro
06:21 - [Music]
06:30 - you
