00:00 - how's it going everybody it's your bro
00:01 - here hope you're doing well and in this
00:03 - video I'm going to teach you guys how we
00:04 - can compile and run Java programs using
00:07 - command prompt so sit back relax and
00:10 - enjoy the show
00:13 - if you find this video helpful please
00:15 - remember to Like comment and subscribe
00:18 - your support will help keep this channel
00:20 - running hey everybody so we're going to
00:22 - compile and run a Java file with command
00:25 - prompt and I made this cheat sheet here
00:27 - and I'll keep this off as we're going
00:28 - through the steps and I'll also post
00:30 - this in the comments down below if you'd
00:32 - like a copy of all the steps so let's
00:34 - begin with step number one we have to
00:36 - make sure we have a Java JDK a Java
00:39 - development kit installed and we did
00:41 - this in Lesson one so let's just be sure
00:44 - that we have it this is how to find your
00:46 - JDK so I'm going to go to my C Drive
00:49 - that is located right here it's within
00:52 - Program Files the Java folder and here
00:56 - are the JDK s so I actually downloaded
00:58 - the most recent version that came out
01:00 - recently so that's why I have two so if
01:02 - you're missing the JDK just go to any
01:04 - web browser and look up Java JDK
01:07 - download it's gonna be this first link
01:09 - and then go to JDK download and select
01:12 - the appropriate file for your operating
01:14 - system and that is step one
01:16 - now with step number two this is
01:18 - completely optional but we don't always
01:20 - necessarily need to rely on an IDE like
01:23 - eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA to create a
01:25 - Java file for us we can write Java code
01:28 - using a text editor such as notepad so
01:31 - let's actually do this for practice
01:32 - let's create a simple hello world
01:34 - program so I'm just going to open up
01:36 - notepad and then we're going to type in
01:38 - public class and the name of a class so
01:42 - let's call this class hello world then
01:45 - we need a set of curly braces and then
01:48 - we need to create a main method within
01:51 - this class and this is the starting
01:54 - point of the program so that's public
01:56 - static void main parentheses within the
02:00 - parenthesis we type in the string
02:02 - straight braces Arg s I think I'm gonna
02:06 - zoom in a little bit so I'm just holding
02:08 - ctrl + to zoom in and then we need to
02:11 - add a set of curly braces for
02:13 - this main method okay
02:17 - and then let's create a print line
02:19 - statements so system dot out dot print
02:23 - line parenthesis semicolon at the end
02:27 - and let's display a message within
02:30 - double quotes so maybe bro says to
02:37 - subscribe or else and now once you
02:43 - finish your code what we're going to do
02:45 - is save this to a convenient place so
02:47 - I'm just going to save this to my
02:48 - desktop and what we're going to type for
02:51 - the file name is the name of the class
02:53 - match this exactly it is case sensetive
02:56 - as well so that's hello world and the
03:00 - important part is to type in dot java so
03:04 - we're using the java file extension and
03:06 - we'll click Save
03:08 - alright and here is my Java file I'm
03:11 - just going to open this up and here it
03:13 - is alright let's move on to step three
03:16 - we're going to open command prompt or if
03:18 - you're using Mac I believe that is
03:20 - terminal on your computer so I'm going
03:23 - to look up command prompt okay
03:30 - now the first thing that we're going to
03:32 - do is we're going to set the path to
03:34 - where our Java development kit is so we
03:37 - can actually look this up so I'm going
03:39 - to go to my C Drive that is here it's
03:44 - within Program Files within the Java
03:48 - folder then click the latest JDK that
03:52 - you have and then we're going to go to
03:54 - the bin folder then we want to copy this
03:57 - address so I'm just going to right click
04:00 - copy address and then we're going to set
04:04 - the path to this address
04:06 - so set half equals the path to your JDK
04:12 - the bin folder and hit enter alright so
04:16 - that is step four now step five is that
04:18 - we're going to change the directory so
04:20 - it's pointing to your location for your
04:23 - Java file so CD and then let's get the
04:27 - address
04:27 - this file so properties and I'm going to
04:30 - copy this location so CD and the address
04:35 - so the directory changed to my desktop
04:39 - here now we can compile this Java code
04:43 - to bytecode which is actually portable
04:45 - so on step six we're going to type in
04:48 - Java C for Java compile and we're going
04:52 - to compile our hello world dot Java file
04:56 - so make sure you get the capitalization
04:58 - right and make sure that this ends with
05:00 - dot Java and hit enter so nothing
05:04 - appears to happen but that's okay though
05:06 - so now we have this class file and this
05:09 - is actually bytecode so it looks like
05:11 - it's in an alien language so this is
05:13 - Java bytecode if you remember from the
05:15 - very first lesson we take a Java file
05:18 - and compile it to bytecode and bytecode
05:21 - is actually portable between different
05:23 - operating systems and machines so if I
05:26 - wrote this with a Windows computer this
05:27 - file is portable to let's say a Mac but
05:30 - that Mac would need a JRE a Java runtime
05:33 - environment but that usually comes with
05:35 - the JDK that we installed so let's
05:38 - actually run this now so this is a dot
05:42 - class file and let's take a look at that
05:44 - and our java file was a dot java file so
05:49 - if we want to run this dot class file
05:51 - what we type in is java and the name of
05:54 - the file so that's hello world and hit
05:57 - enter and it runs our program and here
06:00 - it says bro says to subscribe or else no
06:04 - here's another thing that you can try it
06:05 - let's take a java project that we've
06:08 - made in the past I'll take this
06:09 - stopwatch program that I made and
06:11 - there's actually a GUI component with
06:13 - this so this contains at least two
06:15 - different files so I'm going to copy
06:18 - this and place this on my desktop all
06:21 - right and then we can actually run this
06:24 - using command prompt so what we actually
06:28 - need to find is the class file that
06:30 - contains the main method so that is
06:33 - located within the bin folder of this
06:35 - project and that is right here for men
06:39 - all right so here's that
06:41 - class file and actually if you look in
06:43 - the source folder these are the Java
06:45 - files that we compile so we need to run
06:48 - this main file within this folder so
06:52 - let's go through the steps we have a JDK
06:54 - installed we're going to open command
06:57 - prompt which we have we'll need to set
06:59 - the path so let's do that real quick so
07:02 - we'll make sure we set the path ok we're
07:06 - good and then we're going to change the
07:08 - directory of where this file is located
07:11 - so let's find the address for this so
07:14 - that is within here so I'm just going to
07:19 - copy this address and we're going to
07:22 - type CD and the address of this file
07:27 - alright and then this is already
07:30 - compiled so we can skip this step
07:32 - because it's a class file already so
07:34 - there's no need to compile all we need
07:36 - to do is type in Java and the name of
07:39 - the file that contains the main method
07:41 - so that is for my a project folder main
07:44 - and when I hit enter it's going to run
07:46 - my stopwatch program so that's the
07:50 - basics I'll post these steps in the
07:52 - description and in the comments down
07:53 - below if you would like a copy for
07:55 - yourself but yeah that's how to compile
07:57 - and run a Java program with command
07:59 - prompt hey you yeah I'm talking to you
08:03 - if you learn something new then you can
08:05 - help me help you in 3 easy steps by
