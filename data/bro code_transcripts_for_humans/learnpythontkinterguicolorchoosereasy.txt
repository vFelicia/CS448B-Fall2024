00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's your
00:01 - bro here hope you're doing well and in
00:03 - this video i'm going to teach you guys
00:04 - about the color chooser
00:06 - module in python so sit back relax and
00:08 - enjoy the show
00:11 - if you find this video helpful please
00:13 - remember to like
00:14 - comment and subscribe your support will
00:17 - help keep this channel running
00:19 - okay everybody so before we begin we'll
00:21 - need a second import so let's add this
00:23 - at the top
00:23 - so from tk enter import
00:27 - color chooser and the reason that we
00:30 - need a second import and it's not
00:32 - included with this first import
00:34 - is because this is a sub module
00:37 - it's not necessary to add this comment i
00:39 - just like to add comments for teaching
00:41 - purposes
00:42 - so make sure you have these two imports
00:44 - before we begin
00:45 - now we'll need a window and a button
00:47 - that we can add to the window
00:49 - and when we click on the button we're
00:50 - going to select a color
00:52 - and change the background color of the
00:54 - window so let's create a window
00:56 - window equals tk followed by window dot
01:00 - main loop and then let's set the
01:03 - geometry
01:03 - so we're going to change the background
01:05 - color of the window
01:07 - after we select a color so let's select
01:09 - a fairly
01:10 - large size for a window maybe 420 by 420
01:14 - so this is the width and the height and
01:16 - then let's create a button so
01:18 - button equals button let's set some text
01:22 - text equals click me
01:26 - and we're going to set a command for
01:28 - this button
01:29 - that is called so we're going to create
01:31 - a function maybe called click
01:33 - and then we just need to pack this
01:35 - button so we can add this to the window
01:36 - so button.pack
01:38 - now we're going to need to create a
01:40 - function and we'll call it click
01:42 - so when we click on the button this
01:44 - function is going to be called
01:46 - so def click and what do we want to do
01:50 - after clicking this button what we're
01:52 - going to do is take color
01:55 - chooser and we're going to use the ask
01:58 - color function so currently this is what
02:02 - this does
02:03 - we can select a color after clicking
02:05 - this button and pick whatever color you
02:07 - want
02:08 - then you hit ok however we need to store
02:10 - this color within
02:12 - let's say a variable so we'll create a
02:13 - variable called color color equals color
02:16 - chooser dot ask color
02:18 - and then we can do something with this
02:19 - color but for now let's just print this
02:21 - color
02:22 - just to take a look to see what it
02:23 - contains so print
02:25 - color
02:29 - so let's say that i want this green
02:32 - color
02:33 - click ok this is what this prints this
02:36 - is our color
02:37 - so this is the rgb values that we have
02:41 - in this
02:41 - first element so this is the amount of
02:43 - red
02:44 - then green and then blue and the second
02:48 - element is the hexadecimal
02:49 - representation
02:51 - of these values so what we want
02:54 - is this hexadecimal value so what we can
02:57 - do
02:58 - is create a second variable to store
03:00 - this so let's just call this
03:02 - color hex color hex
03:05 - equals color and we're going to
03:08 - get the first element well technically
03:11 - it's the second element but it's the
03:13 - element at position one so this one
03:17 - this is zero index zero so we're going
03:20 - to basically extract
03:22 - this hexadecimal value and let's just
03:24 - print this just to be sure that it's
03:25 - working fine
03:26 - so print color hex
03:29 - and let's try this again but select a
03:31 - different color
03:32 - maybe i want this purple color then
03:35 - click ok
03:36 - so this is cb42ff
03:40 - and here we have cb42ff
03:43 - now let's change the background color so
03:46 - since we have this hex value that's
03:48 - actually fairly simple
03:49 - so we're going to take window dot config
03:54 - bg for background color equals
03:58 - color hex
04:01 - and this will change background
04:04 - color
04:08 - and let's set this to a sky blue color
04:12 - maybe like this click ok and it changes
04:15 - the color
04:16 - however it's not really necessary to
04:17 - continue printing these values you can
04:20 - take these out if you want
04:23 - and this would work like just the same
04:25 - then
04:27 - now this part isn't necessary but if you
04:30 - want you can condense
04:31 - these three lines of code that we have
04:33 - for our click function
04:34 - into less lines of code so what you
04:37 - could do
04:38 - instead of assigning the value
04:41 - of color at index 1 to a separate
04:43 - variable
04:44 - we can take color at index 1 get rid of
04:47 - this line
04:48 - and assign bg equals color at index 1.
04:52 - so now this is done with just two lines
04:54 - of code
04:55 - and why stop there we can write this
04:57 - with just one line of code
04:59 - so now we're going to take color chooser
05:01 - dot ask color
05:03 - get rid of this line bg equals
05:06 - color chooser dot ask color at index
05:10 - one and now this is done with just
05:14 - one line of code however it's a i would
05:17 - say a little more difficult to
05:19 - teach so that's why i kind of like to
05:21 - separate this line by line
05:24 - so if you want you can condense all of
05:25 - this into just one line of code
05:28 - so here's some ideas of where the color
05:30 - chooser sub module could be helpful
05:32 - so of course you can change the
05:34 - background color too but let's say that
05:36 - you're creating a game
05:38 - and you can customize your character or
05:40 - avatar well it would be kind of nice if
05:42 - you could have some way for the user to
05:44 - actually change maybe the character's
05:46 - hair color eye color something like this
05:48 - would actually work fairly well
05:50 - so yeah that's the basics of color
05:52 - chooser if you would like a copy of all
05:54 - this code i'll post this in the comments
05:55 - down below
05:56 - but that's the basics of color chooser
05:58 - in python
06:00 - hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you
06:03 - learn something new
06:04 - then you can help me help you in three
06:07 - easy steps
06:08 - by smashing that like button drop a
06:10 - comment down below
06:12 - and subscribe if you'd like to become a
06:13 - fellow bro

hey what's going on everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys about the color chooser module in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running okay everybody so before we begin we'll need a second import so let's add
