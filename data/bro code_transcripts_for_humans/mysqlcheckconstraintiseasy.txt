00:00 - hey everybody in this topic I'm going to
00:01 - explain the check constraint the check
00:03 - constraint is used to limit what values
00:06 - can be placed in a column for example I
00:08 - live in the United States depending on
00:10 - which state you live in there is a
00:12 - minimum hourly wage that employers have
00:14 - to pay in this example let's set an
00:17 - hourly pay to our employees table every
00:19 - employee needs to be paid at least the
00:21 - minimum wage in that region and we can
00:23 - do that with the check constraint we
00:26 - have our table of employees if I were to
00:28 - recreate this table it would look like
00:30 - this
00:41 - foreign
00:42 - I think that was pretty close to add a
00:44 - check to a column at the end of our
00:46 - table this is what we would write
00:50 - check
00:52 - then within parentheses what sort of
00:54 - condition do we want
00:55 - let's check to see if our hourly
00:59 - pay column is greater than or equal to
01:01 - maybe ten dollars per hour that will be
01:04 - the minimum wage in this region this
01:07 - would work if we were to create this
01:08 - table however it's typically a good idea
01:11 - to give your check a name just in case
01:13 - you need to drop it later you can easily
01:15 - identify it
01:16 - so precede check with constraint then a
01:21 - constraint name what about
01:23 - chk meaning check underscore
01:26 - hourly
01:28 - pay
01:29 - this check will be known as check hourly
01:32 - pay so we can identify it then we can
01:34 - drop it or make any changes to it if we
01:36 - need to I do already have an employees
01:38 - table so I'm not going to execute this
01:40 - statement but to add a check constraint
01:42 - to a table you would just add a row like
01:44 - this to the bottom if you instead need
01:46 - to add a check constraint to a table
01:47 - that already exists this would be the
01:50 - syntax
01:51 - alter table the name of the table
01:56 - add constraint
01:58 - then we need a unique name for this
02:00 - constraint
02:01 - check
02:02 - hourly pay
02:04 - that's fine
02:06 - then the check within parentheses
02:09 - hourly
02:10 - pay is greater than or equal to 10.
02:15 - ten dollars per hour
02:18 - okay let's run this
02:19 - yeah that appears to have worked I'm
02:22 - going to select all from employees
02:26 - let's take a look at our table
02:28 - then we will attempt to add a new
02:30 - employee
02:31 - insert into
02:34 - employees
02:36 - values
02:37 - we need an employee ID first name last
02:40 - name hourly pay then a higher date
02:41 - employee ID will be six
02:44 - first name
02:46 - Sheldon
02:50 - plankton
02:52 - for hourly pay let's attempt to pay
02:54 - Plankton maybe five dollars per hour
02:57 - then a higher date
03:00 - [Music]
03:01 - 2023-01-07 let's see if that check
03:04 - constraint kicks in we're paying
03:06 - Plankton under ten dollars per hour
03:09 - yeah it doesn't appear that we can do so
03:11 - check constraint check hourly pay is
03:13 - violated now let's pay Plankton ten
03:16 - dollars per hour
03:18 - yeah that worked just fine if you need
03:21 - to delete a check you would type alter
03:24 - table the name of the table
03:28 - drop check then the name that you gave
03:31 - that check in my case it was check
03:34 - hourly pay
03:38 - and that check has been dropped yeah
03:41 - everybody that is the check constraint
03:43 - it's used to limit what values can be
03:46 - placed in a column it's another useful
03:48 - method for checking input and that is
03:51 - the check constraint in MySQL
