00:00 - hey it see bro I hope you're doing well
00:01 - and in this video we're going to be
00:03 - discussing the span and div tags in HTML
00:05 - let's get into it
00:09 - I promised that this will not be a long
00:11 - video it's going to be super quick so
00:13 - the span and div tags defined a section
00:15 - or division on an HTML page typically we
00:19 - use a pair of these tags as a container
00:21 - for HTML elements so that we can style
00:24 - something specific with CSS or perform
00:27 - some sort of procedure using javascript
00:29 - with anything marked with these tags so
00:31 - I'm going to create some sample text
00:33 - I'll create a header for our span tag
00:36 - and I'll just call this span for a title
00:39 - so span tag let's close this and let's
00:42 - do the same thing for our div tag so
00:45 - let's use an h1 header it doesn't really
00:48 - matter and we'll type in div tag and
00:51 - close this let's also create some sample
00:55 - text if you're using sublime text you
00:57 - can just type in lorem and hit tab let's
00:59 - surround this with a pair of paragraph
01:02 - tags and then we're just simply going to
01:04 - copy and paste this for the div tag
01:08 - example so then I can show you the
01:10 - similarities and differences of each of
01:12 - these tags then so let's save this
01:14 - reload the page and this will work for
01:17 - our demonstration let's begin by
01:18 - discussing span tags we can target an
01:21 - element or portion of our webpage that
01:23 - we want to style it depends on where we
01:25 - place our span tags within our text or
01:28 - our HTML document let's say that we want
01:31 - to change the color of a single sentence
01:34 - within our paragraph well we can just
01:36 - add a span tag around whatever we want
01:39 - to target and add some attributes or
01:42 - changes within the opening span tag so
01:44 - let's say that we want to change this
01:46 - sentence right here let's just add an
01:49 - opening span tag and a closing span tag
01:52 - where we want these changes to end all
01:55 - right so let's save this refresh the
01:57 - page no apparent changes right well
01:59 - let's add the style attribute to the
02:02 - opening span tag and let's just say that
02:05 - the color is going to be red we want the
02:07 - color to be red so let's save this
02:09 - reload now and now just this specific
02:13 - sentence is red it depends on where you
02:15 - place the span tags if we were to move
02:17 - the closing span tag to let's say I
02:20 - don't know right here I'm just placing
02:22 - in somewhere ran
02:22 - while everything between these two spam
02:25 - tags is going to be changed with
02:28 - whatever attributes you placed within
02:30 - the opening span tag but you want to
02:32 - make sure that you have a closing span
02:33 - tag because if you forget to close it
02:36 - it's going to change everything after
02:38 - the opening span tag now I'm going to
02:42 - place that closing span tag where this
02:44 - was previously I'll just reload the page
02:45 - now the div tag is almost identical to
02:48 - the span tag however anything within a
02:50 - pair of div tags is considered a block
02:53 - level element so it will begin on a new
02:55 - line and take up the full width
02:57 - available on your web page let's place a
02:59 - pair of div tags in the same place that
03:01 - we had previously in the other example
03:03 - so we'll have an opening div tag there
03:05 - and here as well and we're going to take
03:08 - our style that we had in the previous
03:10 - example and place it within our div tag
03:12 - let's save reload the page now the main
03:15 - difference between a DIF tag and a span
03:17 - tag is that with this dictate you can
03:19 - see that when we reach the div tag it
03:22 - begins on a new line and anything within
03:25 - the div tag takes up the entire width of
03:28 - your web browser and anything after that
03:31 - we'll also begin on a new line so that's
03:33 - the main difference between a span tag
03:35 - and a div tag so that's your super quick
03:37 - lesson on the difference between span
03:39 - tags and div tags and I'll post all the
03:42 - code that we have in the comments down
03:43 - below and in the next lesson we're going
03:45 - to be moving on to CSS heyyou if you
