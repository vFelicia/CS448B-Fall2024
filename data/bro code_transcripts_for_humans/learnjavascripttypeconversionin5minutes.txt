00:00 - all right so uh yeah type conversion
00:02 - type conversion is the process of
00:04 - changing the data type of a value to
00:07 - another data type for example we can
00:09 - convert strings to numbers numbers to
00:11 - booleans booleans to Strings numbers to
00:13 - strings booleans to numbers I think you
00:15 - get the idea why might we want to do
00:17 - this well when we accept user input the
00:20 - data type of that input is a string if
00:22 - we need to use it for any sort of math
00:24 - we need to convert it to a number here's
00:26 - an example let's say we have variable
00:28 - age I will create a window prompt window
00:31 - dot prompt
00:33 - we will ask a user how old are you
00:38 - I'm going to add 1 to our age age plus
00:41 - equals one
00:43 - then console.log
00:46 - age
00:48 - how old are you let's say I'm 25 press
00:50 - OK let's inspect our page go to console
00:54 - it shows that age is 251.
00:57 - when we accept user input it's a string
00:59 - data type a series of characters by
01:02 - adding one we appended one to the end of
01:04 - our string we're not increasing our age
01:07 - by one we're doing string concatenation
01:09 - we are going to convert our user input
01:12 - into a number and this is how
01:15 - so after accepting our user input and
01:18 - before making any changes to it let's
01:20 - reassign age equal to and this is a
01:23 - function the number function it will
01:26 - convert another data type such as a
01:28 - string or Boolean into a number then
01:30 - we'll place our Edge variable within
01:32 - that function
01:34 - so now this should work
01:36 - how old are you let's say I'm 25 press
01:38 - ok 26.
01:40 - so that's the reason you may want to
01:42 - type convert because different data
01:44 - types behave differently along with my
01:47 - age variable I'm going to display the
01:50 - type of age what's the data type
01:53 - how old are you 25 press OK 26 and it
01:57 - shows that the data type of age is
01:59 - number if we removed this type
02:01 - conversion
02:03 - and then run this again
02:05 - it shows that our age is 251 and it's a
02:09 - string which is not exactly what we
02:11 - would like that's a reason why type
02:13 - conversion is important let me give you
02:15 - another example let's create three
02:16 - variables let X let y
02:21 - and let Z I'll show you what happens
02:23 - when we convert different values into
02:25 - different data types let's say x is the
02:29 - word Pizza
02:31 - same thing with y and z
02:35 - I will type Cast X as a number
02:39 - then we need to place X within the
02:41 - number function I kind of want to see
02:43 - what happens when we try and convert
02:45 - pizza into a number
02:47 - it's probably not going to go well
02:49 - let's convert Y into a string
02:54 - then Z will be a Boolean
03:01 - let's console DOT log
03:05 - X as well as the type of x
03:11 - let's do the same thing with y and z
03:18 - alright what's gonna happen
03:21 - if you attempt to convert alphabetical
03:24 - characters into a number
03:25 - that variable will be Nan which means
03:29 - not a number the data type is still
03:31 - number though as you can see
03:33 - the word Pizza is already a string so
03:35 - converting it into a string really
03:37 - doesn't do anything that's why for this
03:39 - line the value is still pizza and the
03:42 - data type is still a string if you
03:45 - convert a string into a Boolean booleans
03:47 - again are either true or false
03:49 - converting the word pizza into a Boolean
03:51 - returns true and the data type is
03:54 - Boolean so basically as long as there's
03:56 - some value here and you convert it into
03:58 - a Boolean it will always be true
04:01 - let's replace pizza with zero
04:05 - what will happen
04:07 - we can convert 0 into a number
04:10 - it doesn't contain any alphabetical
04:11 - characters
04:13 - X contains zero it's a number
04:16 - Y is zero but it's treated as a string
04:19 - Z contains true
04:22 - and it's a Boolean what about empty
04:24 - strings
04:25 - just a set of quotes
04:27 - typecasting an empty string is a number
04:29 - is still zero
04:31 - we have an empty string for y
04:33 - then with our Boolean it's false why
04:36 - might you want to type cast a string as
04:38 - a Boolean that's one way in which you
04:40 - can check to see if user input is empty
04:43 - like did somebody type something in if a
04:45 - user skipped user input it's most likely
04:47 - going to be an empty string then you can
04:49 - check to see like if this is false then
04:52 - the user didn't type in anything and you
04:54 - can let them know
04:55 - what about a variable that's declared
04:57 - but not assigned a value
05:00 - converting an undefined variable to a
05:03 - number results in not a number
05:05 - our string is undefined
05:08 - and our Boolean variable returns false
05:10 - so that's the basics of type conversion
05:12 - it's the process of changing the data
05:15 - type of a value to another it's pretty
05:16 - important when you accept user input
05:18 - because when you accept user input it's
05:20 - a string data type at times you may want
05:22 - to convert it to a number if you need to
05:24 - include that number with any sort of
05:26 - arithmetic expressions or a Boolean if
05:28 - you're checking to see if that user
05:30 - input was completed
05:32 - we'll have more practice with this in
05:33 - the future and well that is type
05:35 - conversion in JavaScript

Cleaned transcript:

all right so uh yeah type conversion type conversion is the process of changing the data type of a value to another data type for example we can convert strings to numbers numbers to booleans booleans to Strings numbers to strings booleans to numbers I think you get the idea why might we want to do this well when we accept user input the data type of that input is a string if we need to use it for any sort of math we need to convert it to a number here's an example let's say we have variable age I will create a window prompt window dot prompt we will ask a user how old are you I'm going to add 1 to our age age plus equals one then console.log age how old are you let's say I'm 25 press OK let's inspect our page go to console it shows that age is 251. when we accept user input it's a string data type a series of characters by adding one we appended one to the end of our string we're not increasing our age by one we're doing string concatenation we are going to convert our user input into a number and this is how so after accepting our user input and before making any changes to it let's reassign age equal to and this is a function the number function it will convert another data type such as a string or Boolean into a number then we'll place our Edge variable within that function so now this should work how old are you let's say I'm 25 press ok 26. so that's the reason you may want to type convert because different data types behave differently along with my age variable I'm going to display the type of age what's the data type how old are you 25 press OK 26 and it shows that the data type of age is number if we removed this type conversion and then run this again it shows that our age is 251 and it's a string which is not exactly what we would like that's a reason why type conversion is important let me give you another example let's create three variables let X let y and let Z I'll show you what happens when we convert different values into different data types let's say x is the word Pizza same thing with y and z I will type Cast X as a number then we need to place X within the number function I kind of want to see what happens when we try and convert pizza into a number it's probably not going to go well let's convert Y into a string then Z will be a Boolean let's console DOT log X as well as the type of x let's do the same thing with y and z alright what's gonna happen if you attempt to convert alphabetical characters into a number that variable will be Nan which means not a number the data type is still number though as you can see the word Pizza is already a string so converting it into a string really doesn't do anything that's why for this line the value is still pizza and the data type is still a string if you convert a string into a Boolean booleans again are either true or false converting the word pizza into a Boolean returns true and the data type is Boolean so basically as long as there's some value here and you convert it into a Boolean it will always be true let's replace pizza with zero what will happen we can convert 0 into a number it doesn't contain any alphabetical characters X contains zero it's a number Y is zero but it's treated as a string Z contains true and it's a Boolean what about empty strings just a set of quotes typecasting an empty string is a number is still zero we have an empty string for y then with our Boolean it's false why might you want to type cast a string as a Boolean that's one way in which you can check to see if user input is empty like did somebody type something in if a user skipped user input it's most likely going to be an empty string then you can check to see like if this is false then the user didn't type in anything and you can let them know what about a variable that's declared but not assigned a value converting an undefined variable to a number results in not a number our string is undefined and our Boolean variable returns false so that's the basics of type conversion it's the process of changing the data type of a value to another it's pretty important when you accept user input because when you accept user input it's a string data type at times you may want to convert it to a number if you need to include that number with any sort of arithmetic expressions or a Boolean if you're checking to see if that user input was completed we'll have more practice with this in the future and well that is type conversion in JavaScript
