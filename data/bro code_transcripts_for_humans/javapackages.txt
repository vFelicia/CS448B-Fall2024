00:00 - how's it going everybody it's bro here
00:02 - hope you're doing well and in this video
00:03 - I'm going to be teaching you guys about
00:05 - packages in Java so sit back relax and
00:08 - enjoy the show
00:11 - if you find this video helpful please
00:13 - remember to Like comment and subscribe
00:16 - your support will help keep this channel
00:18 - running have you ever wondered what
00:20 - we're doing exactly whenever we added
00:22 - import to the top of our program well
00:24 - today is your lucky day because we're
00:25 - going to uncover this mystery so a
00:27 - package is a bundle of related files
00:30 - that we can use in our programs so with
00:33 - our main class I have this class within
00:35 - our default package now we can create
00:37 - another package within our project
00:39 - folder so let's create a package let's
00:41 - say tools so we're going to right click
00:43 - and we are going to create new package
00:47 - and I'm going to call this tools maybe
00:49 - it contains some useful tools that we
00:51 - can use and click finish so now within
00:54 - my source folder I have a package called
00:56 - tools and what we can do with this
00:58 - package is that we can actually add some
01:00 - classes or other files to this package
01:02 - so I'm going to create a new class and
01:04 - I'll call this class maybe tool box and
01:07 - click finish all right so we have this
01:11 - class called it toolbox and notice that
01:13 - at the top of this program it says
01:15 - package tools so if I actually were to
01:18 - take this out it's actually going to
01:20 - yell at us and we'll have an error
01:21 - basically because there's an expected
01:23 - package so if you have some class or
01:27 - files in another package that's not your
01:29 - default package you'll probably need to
01:32 - specify what package it's in at the top
01:34 - however if you're working within the
01:36 - default package you actually don't need
01:38 - to do this now that we have our tools
01:41 - package created let's create an instance
01:43 - of this toolbox class so within my main
01:46 - class I'm going to type in the name of
01:48 - the class
01:48 - so that's tool box and let's call this
01:53 - toolbox with a lowercase T equals new
01:57 - tool box okay so you can see that we
02:02 - have a problem and it says that toolbox
02:04 - cannot be resolved to a type that's
02:07 - because we need to import this package
02:09 - tools so it's kind of like what we do
02:11 - with any other imports
02:12 - type in import than the name of the
02:14 - package which is tools then we can
02:17 - import either everything or something
02:20 - specific so let's import this toolbox
02:22 - class so tool box semicolon and you can
02:27 - see that that error went away and we can
02:29 - now create an instance of this toolbox
02:31 - class that's located within our tools
02:34 - package now in past lessons whenever we
02:37 - imported a package for example icons
02:40 - related to Java X's graphical user
02:43 - interface of swing what we've been doing
02:45 - is importing a package within our JRE
02:48 - system library and this is something
02:51 - that we had downloaded during Lesson one
02:53 - when we installed the JDK the Java
02:55 - development kit
02:56 - so let's actually explore this JRE
02:58 - system library and see if we can find
03:00 - this file related to icons so it was
03:04 - import Java X dot swing daikons
03:07 - so that's located within our JRE system
03:09 - library and it's within this jar file
03:13 - called Java desktop and there should be
03:16 - a package for Java X dot swing located
03:19 - right here so here are all the related
03:22 - files for Java X dot swing and icons
03:25 - should be right here
03:27 - so let's actually take a look at this
03:29 - this is more specifically an interface
03:32 - so this is everything that is written
03:34 - for the icon class the icon interface so
03:38 - there's not really much here there's a
03:39 - few methods and a bunch of notes by the
03:41 - developers so whenever we import
03:44 - something at least in past lessons we've
03:46 - been importing these packages from the
03:49 - JRE system library located within our
03:51 - project folder so that's the basics of
03:54 - packages in Java if you want a copy of
03:56 - this code well really there's not much
03:58 - here but I'll post this in the comments
03:59 - anyways well yeah that's the basics of
04:02 - packages in Java hey you yeah I'm
04:06 - talking to you if you learn something
04:08 - new then you can help me help you in
04:11 - three easy steps
04:12 - by smashing that like button drop a

04:17 - you'd like to become a fellow bro
