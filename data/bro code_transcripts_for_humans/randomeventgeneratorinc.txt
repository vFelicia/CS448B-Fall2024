00:01 - hey everybody in this topic we're going
00:03 - to create a random event generator using
00:06 - random numbers and a switch this might
00:08 - be useful maybe if you're writing a game
00:11 - you need some random event to occur like
00:13 - random monsters show up or the weather
00:15 - changes anything like that we'll be
00:17 - working with random numbers you may need
00:19 - to include this header file
00:21 - include
00:22 - c time
00:24 - because we need access to the time
00:25 - function to work with random numbers
00:27 - we'll need to generate a seed srand
00:31 - function pass in time
00:33 - pass in zero
00:35 - this function will use the current time
00:37 - as a seed to generate random numbers
00:40 - we'll create a local variable to store
00:42 - our random number int
00:44 - rand num
00:46 - equals
00:48 - use the rand function
00:50 - modulus
00:52 - then what's the range of numbers you
00:54 - would like i would like the numbers one
00:56 - through five but this will give us zero
00:59 - through four so i'm going to add one to
01:01 - the end
01:03 - my integer randomnum will be a random
01:05 - number between one and five
01:08 - i'm going to create a switch to examine
01:10 - this random number against many matching
01:12 - cases
01:14 - so we have case one
01:17 - through five
01:21 - if the random number is one what would
01:23 - you like to do exactly
01:25 - so in this program i think we're going
01:27 - to give away prizes like it's a random
01:29 - prize generator depending on the random
01:31 - number we'll give a participant a random
01:33 - prize
01:35 - standard output
01:37 - you win
01:39 - how about a bumper sticker
01:41 - a bumper sticker
01:44 - that will be the lowest tier prize
01:47 - then we should probably add a break to
01:49 - break out of the switch
01:52 - okay let's think of some others
01:59 - i should probably break after these
02:09 - prize two will be a t-shirt
02:14 - prize three how about a free lunch
02:19 - prize for
02:21 - maybe a gift card
02:24 - case five
02:26 - concert tickets that sounds good
02:29 - so when i run this program we'll
02:31 - generate a random number between one and
02:33 - five depending on what that number is
02:35 - we'll execute the code found within one
02:37 - of these cases
02:41 - let's see what i won i want a free lunch
02:44 - if i try this again there's a good
02:46 - chance it'll be a different prize
02:48 - this time i want a bumper sticker
02:52 - i want a bumper sticker again come on i
02:54 - want those concert tickets
02:56 - i'll take a gift card that's not bad
02:58 - now if you don't add these break
03:00 - statements
03:01 - you'll just fall through the switch
03:08 - you want a gift card you want concert
03:10 - tickets
03:11 - so if you only want somebody to win one
03:13 - prize you'll want to exit out of the
03:15 - switch by including this break statement
03:17 - so yeah everybody i thought that might
03:18 - be an interesting program you can
03:20 - generate some random event maybe it's
03:22 - for a game or something i thought maybe
03:24 - a random prize giveaway would kind of be
03:26 - interesting this program is more or less
03:28 - for practice your assignment is to write
03:30 - a switch with some random events then
03:32 - post it in the comment section down
03:34 - below and well yeah that's a random
03:36 - event generator using c plus plus
