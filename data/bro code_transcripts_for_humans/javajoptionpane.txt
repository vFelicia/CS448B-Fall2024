00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's your
00:01 - bro here hope you're doing well and in
00:03 - this video i'm going to teach you guys
00:04 - how we can create
00:05 - dialogue boxes in java so sit back relax
00:08 - and enjoy the show
00:11 - if you find this video helpful please
00:12 - remember to like
00:14 - comment and subscribe your support will
00:16 - help keep this channel running
00:18 - hey i'm going to teach you guys about j
00:20 - option pain
00:21 - this is a pop-up standard dialog box
00:24 - that prompts the user for a value or
00:26 - informs them of something
00:27 - before we begin we'll need this import
00:29 - at the top java x dot swing dot j
00:32 - option pane there's a few variations of
00:34 - dialog boxes that we can create
00:36 - let's begin with a standard message that
00:39 - informs the user of something
00:40 - so in order to create a dialog box we
00:43 - need to type in the name
00:44 - of j option pane which is the name of
00:46 - this class
00:47 - j option pane dot and a simple message
00:50 - is show message dialog so that's
00:53 - show message dialog and there's three
00:57 - variations of this
00:58 - they each have different arguments that
01:00 - they accept so the second one
01:02 - accepts four arguments a parent
01:03 - component a message
01:05 - a title and a message type for now we'll
01:08 - just set the parent component to null
01:10 - because we don't have one
01:12 - a message this can be any sort of
01:14 - message so this is what will appear
01:16 - within the dialog box
01:17 - this is some useless
01:21 - info you can set a title for this box
01:25 - just set this to title
01:27 - and then a message type and there's a
01:28 - few variations of these
01:30 - so a plain vanilla message would be j
01:33 - option
01:34 - make sure you get the capitalization
01:35 - right j option pane
01:38 - dot plain message
01:42 - so this is a plain message with no
01:44 - styling whatsoever
01:46 - and this is what we have here is our
01:48 - dialog box the title is set to title
01:50 - this is some useless info okay thanks
01:53 - for letting me know
01:54 - this fourth argument is the message type
01:56 - so depending on
01:57 - what value we place here it's going to
01:59 - give our message dialog box a different
02:02 - look and feel
02:03 - so there's five i'm going to show you
02:05 - this is one of them i'm just going to
02:07 - copy and paste this five times and then
02:08 - give you a demonstration of each
02:10 - so the first one was a plain message the
02:13 - second one i'll introduce you guys
02:15 - is information message
02:19 - the third is going to be
02:22 - a question message
02:25 - then a warning message
02:30 - and then an error message
02:35 - and then i'll turn these into comments
02:37 - just so that they all don't appear at
02:39 - once
02:40 - so this is the look and feel for the
02:43 - information message
02:44 - the second one so maybe i'll change this
02:47 - to
02:49 - here is more useless info
02:55 - all right so what's different about this
02:56 - one is that there's this icon
02:58 - in the top left corner of this dialog
03:00 - box that just
03:01 - says i and it says here is more useless
03:04 - info
03:05 - okay great so our third
03:09 - dialog box is question message
03:13 - and i'll change the message here
03:17 - like we're asking a question really
03:22 - so we have a question mark icon and it
03:24 - says really
03:25 - okay this fourth one you guys will
03:29 - probably like this is a warning message
03:32 - so this is one thing that you might see
03:33 - during like those fake
03:35 - tech support scams where there'll be
03:36 - like a pop-up dialog box that says your
03:38 - computer has a virus
03:40 - let's mimic something like that your
03:43 - computer has a virus
03:48 - and this is a warning message
03:52 - your computer has a virus so if you want
03:55 - to be annoying
03:56 - what you could do is stick this within a
03:58 - while loop
04:01 - while true basically do this
04:04 - forever so this isn't going to go away
04:07 - even if we were to click okay or exit
04:09 - out of this
04:11 - so your computer has a virus okay i
04:14 - can't seem to click out of this so it's
04:15 - just going on forever
04:17 - uh so that's one annoying thing you can
04:18 - do that's a cool trick you can show your
04:20 - friends
04:21 - so let's go over the last one that is
04:23 - error message we can let the user know
04:25 - that something went wrong
04:27 - so that is this last one
04:31 - i'm going to turn that into a comment
04:32 - for now so this is
04:34 - j option pain dot error message
04:38 - call tech support now
04:42 - or else man they're really getting
04:44 - desperate these scams
04:46 - they're starting to threaten people and
04:49 - this is the
04:50 - error message it has a red x within what
04:52 - looks like a stop sign
04:54 - all right so those are basic message
04:56 - dialog boxes we can also have the user
04:58 - respond to something
05:00 - and we can actually ask for a yes no
05:03 - or cancel response so a different dialog
05:06 - box is
05:07 - show confirm dialog so j option pin
05:11 - dot show confirm dialog
05:16 - so it's the same as before we have a
05:18 - parent component message title and an
05:20 - option
05:21 - type so for parent component i'm going
05:23 - to set this to null
05:25 - message we can ask whatever we want
05:29 - bro do you even code
05:32 - pick a title this
05:35 - is my title
05:38 - and then an option type so j option pane
05:42 - dot and we can select what kinds of
05:45 - responses we want available
05:47 - we can have yes no cancel options just
05:50 - yes no
05:51 - or only yes let's go with yes no cancel
05:55 - and then we need a semicolon at the end
05:58 - and this is what we have
06:02 - here is our confirm dialog box it has
06:05 - our question
06:06 - bro to even code and there are different
06:08 - buttons you can add to
06:09 - this dialog box so we added the one with
06:12 - yes no and cancel
06:15 - but currently this doesn't do anything
06:17 - so let's actually display
06:19 - what this returns using a print line
06:21 - statement so
06:22 - system.out.printline i'm going to take
06:24 - this whole line of code
06:26 - and put this within the print line
06:27 - statement
06:29 - then i need to get rid of that semicolon
06:32 - there
06:33 - all right so if we were to select yes
06:36 - this returns a zero no
06:40 - returns one cancel returns two
06:44 - and then if you click the x button it
06:46 - returns negative one one
06:48 - technique available to you you could
06:49 - store this within a variable let's say
06:52 - int answer equals j option pane dot show
06:55 - confirm dialog
06:56 - based on the value that is stored within
06:58 - this variable you could run this
06:59 - through an if statement or a switch and
07:02 - depending on the answer or what value is
07:04 - stored within here
07:05 - you can do one of a few things so that's
07:07 - how show confirmed dialog works
07:09 - next we have show input dialog where the
07:12 - user can actually type in something
07:14 - so to do that it is j option pane
07:17 - dot show input dialog
07:20 - and we can simply just put a message
07:22 - within here like
07:24 - what is your name
07:30 - and then we can store the result in a
07:33 - variable like
07:34 - string name equals j option pane
07:38 - dot show input dialog and then i'm going
07:41 - to turn
07:41 - this into a comment and run this
07:45 - so what is your name my name is bro okay
07:49 - and then we can like display this or
07:52 - something so
07:53 - hello plus name
07:57 - and let's try that again what is your
08:00 - name
08:01 - bro okay hello bro okay people so the
08:04 - last one i have for you guys today is
08:06 - show option dialogue this combines all
08:09 - of them together into one
08:10 - so that is j option pain dot
08:13 - show option dialog and there are a ton
08:17 - of arguments within here but it's okay
08:18 - we're going to go through these one at a
08:20 - time
08:20 - so for the parent component we're going
08:22 - to set this to null what do we want our
08:24 - message to be
08:26 - maybe you are awesome you can set a
08:29 - title
08:31 - i'll set this to secret message
08:34 - you can set an option type so these are
08:36 - the buttons that you want to add
08:38 - or the response type for this dialog box
08:41 - so j option pane dot you can select
08:44 - whatever you want i'll just have the
08:46 - standard
08:47 - yes no cancel option
08:50 - then a message type that's what we added
08:52 - up here at the top for
08:54 - our message dialog boxes for now i'll
08:56 - just set this to perhaps
08:58 - information message so that is j option
09:01 - pane
09:02 - information message we can also add
09:05 - our own icon and our own options for our
09:08 - buttons but for now i'll just set these
09:09 - to null
09:10 - but we'll get into that in just a moment
09:12 - so null
09:13 - no and the initial value is what is
09:16 - initially selected i'll just set this to
09:17 - zero
09:19 - and then a semicolon at the end okay
09:21 - let's try this
09:24 - you are awesome no i'll be humbled this
09:27 - time
09:28 - okay so let's actually add our own icon
09:31 - to this it's going to replace whatever
09:32 - icon we have set for the message type
09:35 - so i'm going to create an image icon out
09:37 - of this image that i have
09:39 - it's just called smile.png so i need to
09:42 - create an image icon
09:44 - image icon i'll call this icon equals
09:48 - new image icon i need to set the file
09:51 - path or the file name if it's within the
09:53 - same project folder
09:54 - so this is smile.png
09:58 - i'll need an import as well for this
10:01 - okay so i have this image icon just
10:03 - called icon
10:04 - i'm going to add that to this argument
10:06 - here it's the
10:07 - third from the last one so that is icon
10:11 - and this should override the previous
10:13 - symbol that we have
10:14 - so now it's using my image in place of
10:16 - the uh
10:18 - i symbol that we had previously we can
10:20 - also add our own options for these
10:22 - buttons
10:23 - but this will take an array of
10:25 - components or reference data types
10:27 - so let's create an array of strings so a
10:30 - string an array of strings we'll call
10:32 - this responses
10:34 - what do we want to add to these buttons
10:36 - in place of yes no
10:38 - cancel so maybe for the first option
10:42 - no you're awesome
10:46 - then for the second option perhaps
10:51 - thank you and for the third option we'll
10:55 - just
10:55 - maybe blush alright so
10:59 - we take this array and we're going to
11:02 - place it in the
11:03 - second to last argument i think i'm
11:06 - going to add these
11:07 - all on a new line just uh just so we can
11:09 - see everything here
11:12 - because it's getting very long
11:19 - all right we should be good and this is
11:21 - the
11:22 - value that you initially want to be
11:23 - selected so if you want the first button
11:25 - selected
11:26 - set this to zero if you want the second
11:27 - one set this to one
11:30 - and here is our dialog box secret
11:34 - message
11:34 - you are awesome no you're awesome thank
11:36 - you or blush
11:38 - no you're awesome alright so that's the
11:41 - basics
11:42 - of j option pane if you want to copy
11:44 - evolve this code i'll post all of this
11:45 - in the comments down below
11:47 - but yeah that's the basics of j option
11:49 - pain in java
11:51 - hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you
11:54 - learn something new
11:55 - then you can help me help you in three
11:58 - easy steps
11:59 - by smashing that like button drop a

hey what's going on everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can create dialogue boxes in java so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running hey i'm going to teach you guys about j option pain this is a popup standard dialog box that prompts the user for a value or informs them of something before we begin we'll need this import at the top java x dot swing dot j option pane there's a few variations of dialog boxes that we can create let's begin with a standard message that informs the user of something so in order to create a dialog box we need to type in the name of j option pane which is the name of this class j option pane dot and a simple message is show message dialog so that's show message dialog and there's three variations of this they each have different arguments that they accept so the second one accepts four arguments a parent component a message a title and a message type for now we'll just set the parent component to null because we don't have one a message this can be any sort of message so this is what will appear within the dialog box this is some useless info you can set a title for this box just set this to title and then a message type and there's a few variations of these so a plain vanilla message would be j option make sure you get the capitalization right j option pane dot plain message so this is a plain message with no styling whatsoever and this is what we have here is our dialog box the title is set to title this is some useless info okay thanks for letting me know this fourth argument is the message type so depending on what value we place here it's going to give our message dialog box a different look and feel so there's five i'm going to show you this is one of them i'm just going to copy and paste this five times and then give you a demonstration of each so the first one was a plain message the second one i'll introduce you guys is information message the third is going to be a question message then a warning message and then an error message and then i'll turn these into comments just so that they all don't appear at once so this is the look and feel for the information message the second one so maybe i'll change this to here is more useless info all right so what's different about this one is that there's this icon in the top left corner of this dialog box that just says i and it says here is more useless info okay great so our third dialog box is question message and i'll change the message here like we're asking a question really so we have a question mark icon and it says really okay this fourth one you guys will probably like this is a warning message so this is one thing that you might see during like those fake tech support scams where there'll be like a popup dialog box that says your computer has a virus let's mimic something like that your computer has a virus and this is a warning message your computer has a virus so if you want to be annoying what you could do is stick this within a while loop while true basically do this forever so this isn't going to go away even if we were to click okay or exit out of this so your computer has a virus okay i can't seem to click out of this so it's just going on forever uh so that's one annoying thing you can do that's a cool trick you can show your friends so let's go over the last one that is error message we can let the user know that something went wrong so that is this last one i'm going to turn that into a comment for now so this is j option pain dot error message call tech support now or else man they're really getting desperate these scams they're starting to threaten people and this is the error message it has a red x within what looks like a stop sign all right so those are basic message dialog boxes we can also have the user respond to something and we can actually ask for a yes no or cancel response so a different dialog box is show confirm dialog so j option pin dot show confirm dialog so it's the same as before we have a parent component message title and an option type so for parent component i'm going to set this to null message we can ask whatever we want bro do you even code pick a title this is my title and then an option type so j option pane dot and we can select what kinds of responses we want available we can have yes no cancel options just yes no or only yes let's go with yes no cancel and then we need a semicolon at the end and this is what we have here is our confirm dialog box it has our question bro to even code and there are different buttons you can add to this dialog box so we added the one with yes no and cancel but currently this doesn't do anything so let's actually display what this returns using a print line statement so system.out.printline i'm going to take this whole line of code and put this within the print line statement then i need to get rid of that semicolon there all right so if we were to select yes this returns a zero no returns one cancel returns two and then if you click the x button it returns negative one one technique available to you you could store this within a variable let's say int answer equals j option pane dot show confirm dialog based on the value that is stored within this variable you could run this through an if statement or a switch and depending on the answer or what value is stored within here you can do one of a few things so that's how show confirmed dialog works next we have show input dialog where the user can actually type in something so to do that it is j option pane dot show input dialog and we can simply just put a message within here like what is your name and then we can store the result in a variable like string name equals j option pane dot show input dialog and then i'm going to turn this into a comment and run this so what is your name my name is bro okay and then we can like display this or something so hello plus name and let's try that again what is your name bro okay hello bro okay people so the last one i have for you guys today is show option dialogue this combines all of them together into one so that is j option pain dot show option dialog and there are a ton of arguments within here but it's okay we're going to go through these one at a time so for the parent component we're going to set this to null what do we want our message to be maybe you are awesome you can set a title i'll set this to secret message you can set an option type so these are the buttons that you want to add or the response type for this dialog box so j option pane dot you can select whatever you want i'll just have the standard yes no cancel option then a message type that's what we added up here at the top for our message dialog boxes for now i'll just set this to perhaps information message so that is j option pane information message we can also add our own icon and our own options for our buttons but for now i'll just set these to null but we'll get into that in just a moment so null no and the initial value is what is initially selected i'll just set this to zero and then a semicolon at the end okay let's try this you are awesome no i'll be humbled this time okay so let's actually add our own icon to this it's going to replace whatever icon we have set for the message type so i'm going to create an image icon out of this image that i have it's just called smile.png so i need to create an image icon image icon i'll call this icon equals new image icon i need to set the file path or the file name if it's within the same project folder so this is smile.png i'll need an import as well for this okay so i have this image icon just called icon i'm going to add that to this argument here it's the third from the last one so that is icon and this should override the previous symbol that we have so now it's using my image in place of the uh i symbol that we had previously we can also add our own options for these buttons but this will take an array of components or reference data types so let's create an array of strings so a string an array of strings we'll call this responses what do we want to add to these buttons in place of yes no cancel so maybe for the first option no you're awesome then for the second option perhaps thank you and for the third option we'll just maybe blush alright so we take this array and we're going to place it in the second to last argument i think i'm going to add these all on a new line just uh just so we can see everything here because it's getting very long all right we should be good and this is the value that you initially want to be selected so if you want the first button selected set this to zero if you want the second one set this to one and here is our dialog box secret message you are awesome no you're awesome thank you or blush no you're awesome alright so that's the basics of j option pane if you want to copy evolve this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of j option pain in java hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and
