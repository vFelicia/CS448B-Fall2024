00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's your
00:01 - bro hope you're doing well and in this
00:03 - video i'm going to teach you guys how
00:04 - arrays work in java so
00:06 - sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:11 - make sure you like comment and subscribe
00:14 - one like equals one prayer for the
00:16 - youtube algorithm
00:18 - all right welcome back ladies and
00:20 - gentlemen in this video i'm going to
00:22 - explain arrays an array
00:24 - is used to store multiple values in a
00:26 - single
00:27 - variable that is it they're really not
00:29 - that complicated but they can seem kind
00:31 - of intimidating
00:33 - so let's begin with a simple string
00:35 - variable called car
00:37 - and i will assign this a value of camaro
00:40 - what i could do
00:40 - is that i could store multiple values
00:43 - within
00:44 - the single variable by turning this
00:46 - variable into an array
00:47 - and these are the steps to do so next to
00:50 - the data type i'm going to add a set of
00:52 - straight brackets
00:53 - and then with the values i'm going to
00:55 - surround the values
00:57 - with a set of curly braces and that is
00:59 - it and for fun i'll rename this as cars
01:02 - because that makes more sense
01:03 - so it would make more sense to name this
01:05 - something that is plural
01:07 - because it contains more than one value
01:09 - so let's add a few other cars let's say
01:12 - i would like to add a
01:14 - corvette and a tesla
01:18 - and that is it that is an array of cars
01:21 - so in order to access one of these
01:23 - elements
01:24 - arrays have spots kind of like parking
01:27 - spots
01:28 - and they are called elements so let's
01:30 - say i would like to access
01:32 - this first element so i'm going to take
01:34 - the name
01:35 - of my array which is cars add a set of
01:38 - straight brackets and then list the
01:40 - element number
01:41 - so computers always start at zero if i
01:44 - want to access this first element
01:46 - i'm going to write zero and i could
01:49 - reassign this
01:50 - let's say i would like to instead place
01:53 - my mustang within
01:55 - element number zero and let's print
01:57 - whatever is within
01:59 - the first element of our array of cars
02:01 - cars
02:02 - straight brackets zero so this will
02:05 - print
02:06 - my string of mustang if i want to access
02:08 - the next element
02:09 - so this is zero element number zero and
02:12 - the next one is element one
02:13 - then two so on and so forth in my next
02:16 - element
02:17 - of my array of cars we have a corvette
02:21 - and then a tesla so what happens if i
02:24 - attempt to access an
02:25 - element that does not exist so let's put
02:28 - three here
02:29 - well what we'll get is an array index
02:31 - out of bound exception because
02:33 - this array does not have this element
02:35 - element number three it only has
02:37 - elements
02:38 - zero one and two but i could add another
02:41 - element
02:42 - let's say i'm going to add a bmw to
02:45 - element number three
02:47 - so then we no longer get that error
02:48 - because our array has a total of
02:51 - four elements zero one two
02:54 - three one thing that you should know
02:56 - with arrays
02:57 - when you assign values they all have to
02:59 - be the same
03:00 - data type they have to be consistent for
03:02 - example i couldn't add
03:04 - the primitive integer value of 1 2
03:07 - 3 because what this states is that this
03:10 - is a type
03:10 - mismatch cannot convert from int to
03:12 - string so if you have an array of
03:14 - strings for example
03:16 - you can only add strings if this was an
03:19 - array of integers
03:20 - well i could only add integers then to
03:22 - this array
03:23 - so you have to make sure that the data
03:25 - type of the values that you're adding
03:27 - are all consistent with the data type of
03:29 - the array
03:30 - now there is an additional way to create
03:32 - an array and that is by first allocating
03:35 - the amount of elements that we'll need
03:36 - and then storing
03:37 - the values later on in the program so
03:39 - this is an additional way to write an
03:41 - array we type in
03:42 - the data type of the array straight
03:44 - brackets
03:45 - the name of the array we'll call it cars
03:48 - equals
03:48 - new the data type again straight
03:50 - brackets semicolon
03:52 - within the straight brackets we'll
03:54 - assign how many
03:55 - elements we would like within this array
03:58 - let's say we would like three
03:59 - so we can assign a total of three
04:02 - strings to our array of cars
04:04 - and let's do that so later on in this
04:06 - program right here is a good spot
04:08 - we will assign each of the elements of
04:10 - our array of cars
04:11 - so cars at element number zero will
04:14 - equal my camaro
04:17 - and then cars at element one will equal
04:21 - a corvette and cars
04:25 - at element two will equal
04:29 - a tesla
04:32 - and then we can display each element of
04:34 - this array so
04:36 - let's begin with cars at zero this
04:38 - contains the
04:39 - camaro then the corvette
04:43 - and then the tesla so this is an
04:45 - additional way to write an array we can
04:47 - first declare the amount of elements
04:49 - that we would like for this array
04:51 - and then we could assign the values
04:53 - later on in the program
04:54 - before we finish this video i'm going to
04:57 - explain how we can use a for loop to
04:59 - iterate through all of the elements of
05:01 - an array
05:01 - let's say we would like to display all
05:03 - of the elements of this array
05:05 - so let's create a for loop to do that
05:07 - four a set of parenthesis and then a set
05:09 - of curly
05:10 - braces with for loops there are three
05:12 - statements the first
05:13 - is that we need some sort of index or
05:16 - counter
05:16 - so let's say int i equals zero
05:19 - that is the first statement for the
05:21 - second statement this is our condition
05:23 - we'll continue this for loop as long as
05:25 - i is less than
05:27 - our array cars dot length
05:32 - and lastly we will increment our index
05:34 - by one
05:36 - so let's display whatever is within
05:39 - our array of cars at element number
05:43 - i so i is going to begin at zero then
05:46 - after each iteration of this for loop
05:48 - it's going to increment by one so when
05:50 - we run this this will display
05:52 - all of the elements of our array of cars
05:55 - camaro
05:56 - corvette and tesla all right everybody
05:59 - so that's what an array is it's really
06:01 - just used to store
06:02 - multiple values within a single variable
06:04 - if you need to access
06:06 - one of the elements of an array you just
06:08 - list the name of the array
06:10 - and the element number in which you're
06:12 - trying to access
06:13 - so if you would like a copy of this code
06:15 - i will post all of this in the comments
06:17 - down below
06:18 - please don't forget to smash that like
06:20 - button drop a comment down below
06:22 - and subscribe if you'd like to become a
06:24 - fellow bro

my next element of my array of cars we have a corvette and then a tesla so what happens if i attempt to access an element that does not exist so let's put three here well what we'll get is an array index out of bound exception because this array does not have this element element number three it only has elements zero one and two but i could add another element let's say i'm going to add a bmw
