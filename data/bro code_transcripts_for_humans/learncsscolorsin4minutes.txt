00:07 - enjoy the show we'll need four
00:09 - paragraphs to begin with I'll name the
00:11 - first paragraph P1 the second will be P2
00:13 - followed by P3 then P4 we can change the
00:18 - background color of an element or the
00:20 - font color let's begin with the
00:22 - background color of the body of our
00:24 - document within our external style sheet
00:26 - I will select our body element I'll
00:30 - change the background color property to
00:33 - be
00:33 - now with colors we can use names we can
00:37 - use RGB values hexadecimal values or hsl
00:41 - values for the first example we'll use
00:43 - named colors there are multiple sites in
00:46 - which you can find named colors
00:48 - let's go with this one slate gray
00:52 - background color slate gray save your
00:55 - changes and there you go the background
00:58 - color is now slate gray let's change the
01:02 - font color of our P1 paragraph
01:04 - I will select the ID of P1 I will change
01:08 - the color that's the font color to be do
01:13 - they have tomato
01:15 - yes there is
01:17 - for P1 let's change the color to be
01:20 - tomato because I like tomatoes those are
01:23 - named colors
01:25 - another option is RGB values
01:28 - for paragraph two we will set the color
01:31 - to be a set of RGB values RGB then a set
01:36 - of parentheses
01:38 - R meaning red G meaning green B meaning
01:40 - blue
01:41 - I would recommend looking up a Color
01:43 - Picker for this
01:45 - I would like a light bluish color
01:49 - so let's select uh that's good
01:52 - you'll find a set of three values for
01:54 - RGB
01:55 - these values range from 0 to 255.
02:00 - we will paste those three values within
02:02 - the set of parentheses and there's that
02:05 - blue color
02:06 - let's do this with the background color
02:07 - too let's change the background color
02:09 - from a named color to RGB values RGB
02:13 - parentheses
02:15 - let's go with whatever color this is 41
02:19 - 41 41.
02:23 - and there's that new color then we have
02:25 - hexadecimal values
02:27 - for P3 we will change the color to B
02:32 - some hex value let's go with the green
02:34 - color
02:37 - that's decent hexadecimal values are a
02:40 - combination of numbers and letters the
02:42 - letters range from a to F we'll copy
02:45 - this hex value
02:47 - then paste it
02:49 - hex values with CSS should start with
02:52 - the hashtag and there's that green color
02:55 - let's change the background color again
02:57 - let's go with the lighter color this
02:59 - time
03:00 - 54 54 54.
03:06 - there we are okay lastly we have hsl
03:09 - values
03:10 - or P4
03:13 - color colon now if you're using vs code
03:16 - here's a little trick we can pull up a
03:18 - Color Picker
03:19 - let's type a color like black
03:22 - click on the box and there's a Color
03:25 - Picker that's built in
03:26 - for hsl we can click the top bar here
03:30 - H meaning Hue s meaning saturation l
03:33 - meaning lightness
03:35 - let's go with the purple color
03:41 - we have one value then two percentages
03:44 - let's change the background color again
03:46 - using hsl
03:48 - I'll pick something a little bit darker
03:52 - that's good all right everybody so in
03:54 - conclusion with CSS colors you can pick
03:57 - either color names RGB values
04:00 - hexadecimal values or hsl values through
04:03 - the remainder of the series we'll be
04:05 - using hsl and well everybody that's an
04:07 - introduction to CSS colors thank you
