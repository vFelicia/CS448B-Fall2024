00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's bro
00:02 - hope you're doing well
00:03 - and in this video i'm going to explain
00:04 - the basics of class variables in python
00:07 - so
00:07 - sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:12 - if you wouldn't mind please like comment
00:15 - and subscribe one like
00:16 - equals one prayer for the youtube
00:18 - algorithm
00:19 - here's a super quick video on the
00:21 - differences between class and instance
00:23 - variables
00:24 - for this example let's say we have two
00:26 - car objects
00:27 - named car 1 and car 2 and i'm just
00:30 - passing in a bunch of values to each of
00:32 - these car constructors
00:33 - now within my class car i have my init
00:36 - method
00:36 - also known as the constructor and what
00:38 - i'm doing is assigning all of these
00:40 - values
00:41 - to the variables found within my car
00:43 - constructor
00:44 - these variables declared inside the
00:46 - constructor
00:47 - are known as instance variables and each
00:50 - object
00:51 - can have their own unique values
00:53 - assigned to each of these variables
00:55 - now where a class variable is different
00:57 - is that a class variable
00:59 - is declared inside the class but outside
01:02 - of the constructor
01:03 - and what we can do is set some default
01:05 - values for some variables
01:07 - let's say we would like to add an
01:08 - additional variable let's say wheels
01:10 - wheels equals and we can set a default
01:13 - value
01:14 - for all instances of this class for each
01:16 - car object that we create
01:18 - so we set wheels to equal four this is
01:20 - an example of a class
01:22 - variable whenever we create a car object
01:25 - we can pass
01:26 - in a unique make model year in color but
01:28 - by default
01:29 - they will all have four wheels now if i
01:32 - was to print
01:33 - the amount of wheels that car 1 and car
01:36 - 2 have
01:36 - they will both have 4 wheels it's as if
01:39 - we're setting a default value
01:41 - if i change this to two wheels well then
01:44 - these cars have two wheels
01:45 - maybe they're motorcycles or something
01:47 - now you can actually
01:48 - change these values each object will
01:50 - have their own
01:51 - copy of this variable but you can set it
01:53 - to a default value
01:55 - so let's say car one
01:58 - is a motorcycle car one dot wheels
02:01 - equals two so if i were to print car
02:04 - ones wheels along with car two
02:06 - car one will have 2 wheels but car 2
02:09 - is still using that default amount of
02:11 - wheels which is 4.
02:13 - now there's another way in which you can
02:14 - access a class variable
02:16 - you don't necessarily need to create an
02:18 - object to do so you can just use the
02:20 - name of the class
02:21 - so what i'm going to do is turn all of
02:23 - these lines into comments
02:25 - and i will print the amount of wheels
02:28 - that our class has so type in the name
02:31 - of the class
02:32 - car with a capital c it should be the
02:34 - same name as your class name
02:36 - followed by the name of the class
02:37 - variable car
02:39 - dot wheels but make sure you spell it
02:41 - right
02:42 - all right so this will display for
02:44 - wheels
02:45 - now what if we decide to change the
02:47 - class variable
02:48 - through our class well that will affect
02:51 - all
02:52 - instances of our class so let's say car
02:55 - dot wheels equals two it's as if we
02:59 - change our mind and we have decided to
03:01 - create motorcycles instead of cars
03:03 - well if we were to change the wheels
03:06 - class variable through the use of our
03:08 - car class
03:09 - well then it's going to affect it for
03:11 - all instances of this class
03:13 - you can see that both car 1 and car 2
03:15 - now have two wheels
03:17 - when we just changed car 1's wheels it
03:19 - did not affect
03:20 - car 2 at all so that's the main
03:22 - difference between a class variable and
03:24 - an instance variable
03:25 - an instance variable is declared inside
03:28 - of constructor
03:29 - and they can be given unique values with
03:31 - class variables
03:32 - they are declared within a class but
03:34 - outside of the constructor
03:36 - and you can set a default value for all
03:38 - instances of this class
03:40 - for all unique objects that are created
03:42 - and then you can change those values
03:44 - later too
03:45 - so if you would like a copy of all this
03:46 - code i will post all of this in the
03:48 - comment section down below
03:49 - but yeah that is the basics of class
03:52 - variables
03:52 - in python

hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain the basics of class variables in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you wouldn't mind please like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm here's a super quick video on the differences between class and instance variables for this example let's say we have two car objects named car 1 and car 2 and i'm just passing in a bunch of values to each of these car constructors now within my class car i have my init method also known as the constructor and what i'm doing is assigning all of these values to the variables found within my car constructor these variables declared inside the constructor are known as instance variables and each object can have their own unique values assigned to each of these variables now where a class variable is different is that a class variable is declared inside the class but outside of the constructor and what we can do is set some default values for some variables let's say we would like to add an additional variable let's say wheels wheels equals and we can set a default value for all instances of this class for each car object that we create so we set wheels to equal four this is an example of a class variable whenever we create a car object we can pass in a unique make model year in color but by default they will all have four wheels now if i was to print the amount of wheels that car 1 and car 2 have they will both have 4 wheels it's as if we're setting a default value if i change this to two wheels well then these cars have two wheels maybe they're motorcycles or something now you can actually change these values each object will have their own copy of this variable but you can set it to a default value so let's say car one is a motorcycle car one dot wheels equals two so if i were to print car ones wheels along with car two car one will have 2 wheels but car 2 is still using that default amount of wheels which is 4. now there's another way in which you can access a class variable you don't necessarily need to create an object to do so you can just use the name of the class so what i'm going to do is turn all of these lines into comments and i will print the amount of wheels that our class has so type in the name of the class car with a capital c it should be the same name as your class name followed by the name of the class variable car dot wheels but make sure you spell it right all right so this will display for wheels now what if we decide to change the class variable through our class well that will affect all instances of our class so let's say car dot wheels equals two it's as if we change our mind and we have decided to create motorcycles instead of cars well if we were to change the wheels class variable through the use of our car class well then it's going to affect it for all instances of this class you can see that both car 1 and car 2 now have two wheels when we just changed car 1's wheels it did not affect car 2 at all so that's the main difference between a class variable and an instance variable an instance variable is declared inside of constructor and they can be given unique values with class variables they are declared within a class but outside of the constructor and you can set a default value for all instances of this class for all unique objects that are created and then you can change those values later too so if you would like a copy of all this code i will post all of this in the comment section down below but yeah that is the basics of class variables in python
