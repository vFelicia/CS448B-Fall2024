02:04 - function the event type is going to be
02:06 - click when we click on the button we're
02:08 - going to do something for the Callback
02:11 - we'll write an arrow function we are
02:14 - provided with an event parameter by the
02:16 - web browser Arrow do this when we click
02:20 - on the button what code do we want to
02:22 - perform we're going to take my image
02:25 - access its style access its display
02:28 - property set it to be a string of none
02:32 - so when you click on the button it's
02:34 - going to hide the image the display
02:36 - property is set to none not only that
02:39 - let's change the text on the button
02:41 - after we hide the element let's take my
02:45 - button change the text content equal to
02:49 - be show because now I want to show the
02:53 - element so hide BEC
02:56 - show when we click on the button a
02:58 - second time nothing nothing
03:00 - happens we would like to toggle between
03:02 - hiding and displaying this element we'll
03:05 - write an if statement let's check to see
03:08 - if the display of my image is strictly
03:12 - equal to
03:13 - none is the display of my image
03:16 - currently none if so we're going to set
03:18 - the display to block because it's a
03:20 - block level element take my image access
03:24 - its style access its display property
03:28 - set it to be
03:31 - BL then within an lse
03:33 - statement place these two lines of
03:40 - code and we will change the text content
03:43 - of my button to be
03:46 - hide now when clicking the button we can
03:49 - toggle between hiding and showing this
03:51 - element the
03:53 - image now let me demonstrate something
03:56 - if we were to take my button then add it
03:59 - after the
04:00 - image here's what would
04:03 - happen let me add a break
04:07 - to so by setting the display To None we
04:11 - don't Reserve any space for that image
04:13 - my button moves up near the top of the
04:15 - window until I show it again another
04:18 - option if we would like to reserve some
04:20 - space for the image is to toggle the
04:23 - visibility not the display property
04:25 - replace display with
04:28 - visibility
04:32 - we're going to check if the visibility
04:35 - is
04:37 - hidden set the visibility equal to be
04:41 - hidden if we would like to show the
04:43 - image the visibility is going to be set
04:45 - to
04:47 - visible when we toggle the visibility of
04:50 - this image we at least reserve the space
04:52 - for it the elements that come after
04:54 - aren't going to shift near the top of
04:56 - the
04:57 - window you can use visibility or display
04:59 - depending on the project you're creating
05:01 - all right everybody so that is how to
05:03 - show and hide HTML elements using
