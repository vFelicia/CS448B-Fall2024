00:00 - hey everybody in today's topic I'm going
00:01 - to show you how we can add images to a
00:03 - web page using HTML so sit back relax
00:06 - and enjoy the show
00:09 - all right everybody here's how to add an
00:11 - image to a web page but you'll need an
00:13 - image to work with I have a picture of a
00:16 - dog I'll add that to my website folder
00:19 - next to my index file I have a picture
00:21 - of a dog
00:22 - to add an image we'll use a self-closing
00:25 - image tag
00:27 - then set the source equal to B the name
00:30 - of your image including the extension
00:33 - mine is dog and this is a PNG file
00:38 - so this picture is fairly large you can
00:41 - change the dimensions with the height or
00:43 - width attributes
00:45 - I'll set the height to be 200 200 pixels
00:48 - now the width will adjust automatically
00:51 - however you could change that too if you
00:53 - wanted if I need this image to be a
00:55 - perfect square I will also set the width
00:57 - to be 200 however this does compress the
01:00 - image depending on the dimensions of
01:03 - your original picture you may need to
01:05 - change the height and or width I'll set
01:07 - the height to be 200 though
01:09 - then keep the width the same it'll
01:11 - adjust automatically
01:13 - now for some reason if your image isn't
01:15 - displaying let's say that I get the file
01:17 - extension wrong I'll say that this is a
01:19 - JPEG well the image won't display you
01:23 - can add alternative text with the alt
01:26 - attribute the alternative text you could
01:29 - say anything
01:30 - this is a picture of a dog
01:36 - this image doesn't display you at least
01:39 - display the alternative text now the
01:42 - nice thing about the alt attribute is
01:44 - that if somebody is visually impaired
01:46 - and they're using a screen reader the
01:48 - screen reader will read this alt
01:50 - description just to test my screen
01:52 - reader I'm going to add some text before
01:54 - and after this image as well
01:57 - let's add an H1 header tag
01:59 - this
02:00 - is a cute dog
02:05 - then I'll add some text after
02:08 - I'll use an H3 header tag
02:12 - woof woof
02:14 - I'll use my screen reader this is an
02:16 - extension on Chrome you can download
02:21 - my first website
02:23 - this is a cute dog this is a picture of
02:25 - a dog woof woof the screen reader read
02:28 - the alternative text for this image so
02:31 - it is good practice if you include an
02:32 - image to write a brief description of
02:34 - the image another cool thing you can do
02:37 - with images is that you can't turn them
02:38 - into hyperlinks I will surround our
02:41 - image element with a pair of a tags
02:44 - a meaning anchor
02:46 - then I will set the href attribute equal
02:49 - to a URL I'll find the Wikipedia page
02:53 - for dogs
02:55 - all right I'll copy this URL
02:58 - then I will set the href attribute to be
03:01 - this URL
03:02 - when I click on this image it takes me
03:05 - to the Wikipedia page for dogs
03:07 - so yeah you can turn an image into a
03:10 - hyperlink
03:10 - another cool thing you can do too is
03:12 - that you can include gifs in your web
03:14 - page
03:15 - this is my gift that I'll include
03:18 - I'll add that to my website folder
03:21 - I'll include a self-closing image tag
03:24 - set the source equal to B the name of my
03:27 - image
03:30 - then be sure to get the file extension
03:32 - right this is a gif
03:34 - I'll set the height attribute to be
03:36 - maybe 200 as well height equals 200.
03:41 - then I'll add some alternative text
03:45 - alt attribute will be
03:48 - smiling dog gif
03:53 - now with a website you may have all of
03:55 - your images within a separate folder
03:57 - like this I'll go to new folder I'll
04:01 - create a folder named images then I will
04:03 - move my images to the images folder
04:07 - so my images are no longer being
04:09 - displayed we have our alternative text
04:11 - this is a picture of a dog and smiling
04:14 - dog gif with your Source attribute we're
04:17 - using a relative file path
04:20 - we need to navigate to the images folder
04:22 - then find the appropriate image files
04:25 - I'm going to precede these images with
04:28 - the name of the folder they are found
04:30 - within the images folder
04:36 - you may also need another forward slash
04:39 - for me either work let's move on to an
04:42 - exercise in the last few videos we were
04:44 - working on a web page for song lyrics
04:46 - Let's include some album art
04:49 - for my song that I picked I have a
04:52 - picture of the original album art that
04:54 - this song is found from
04:56 - I will move that to my website folder
04:59 - then I will move it to the images folder
05:01 - within my website folder
05:04 - I need a self-closing image tag set the
05:07 - source equal to B we need to navigate to
05:10 - the images folder I will list that first
05:12 - Images slash the name of the file
05:17 - for me it's album
05:19 - cover
05:20 - dot jpeg
05:23 - then I'll change the dimensions I will
05:25 - set the height equal to B
05:28 - 200.
05:29 - I'll add some alternative text
05:32 - alt equals
05:35 - album
05:36 - art cover
05:39 - then a line break
05:42 - maybe two
05:44 - then I'll turn this into a hyperlink as
05:46 - well I will surround our image with a
05:48 - pair of a tags
05:52 - I will set the href attribute to be the
05:55 - original YouTube video where you can
05:57 - find this song
05:58 - so href equals the YouTube video that I
06:02 - linked before so this should take me to
06:04 - YouTube
06:07 - there we are
06:09 - all right everybody well that's how to
06:11 - include an image on a web page using
06:14 - HTML
