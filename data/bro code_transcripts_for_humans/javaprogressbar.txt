00:00 - hell's going everybody its Ebro here
00:02 - hope you're doing well and in this video
00:03 - I'm going to teach you guys how J
00:05 - progress bars work in Java so let's get
00:08 - into it if you find this video helpful
00:12 - please remember to Like comment and
00:15 - subscribe
00:15 - your support will help keep this channel
00:17 - running hey everybody we're gonna be
00:20 - building a progress bar and this is
00:22 - defined as a visual aid to let the user
00:24 - know that an operation is processing so
00:27 - it's usually good practice to let the
00:28 - user know what's going on behind the
00:30 - scenes
00:30 - if something's processing you're waiting
00:33 - on something otherwise if there's no
00:35 - sort of visual cue the user might close
00:38 - out of your application because they
00:39 - think it's frozen so let's create a
00:41 - progress bar we're going to create a new
00:42 - class within our project folder so file
00:45 - a new class I'll call this progress bar
00:49 - demo but call it whatever you want click
00:53 - finish then we're going to create an
00:55 - instance of this within our main class
00:57 - so we'll type the name of the class and
01:00 - I'll call this instance just demo equals
01:04 - new progress bar demo all right so we're
01:08 - done with this class let's go back to
01:10 - our progress bar demo class and we're
01:13 - going to import a few things import
01:16 - java.awt asterisk and import Java X dot
01:24 - swing dot asterisk then let's create the
01:28 - constructor for this class so we're
01:31 - going to type in the name of the class
01:32 - followed by a set of parentheses and
01:35 - curly braces and before the constructor
01:38 - we're going to declare a few things so
01:41 - we'll create a jframe and we'll call
01:43 - this frame equals new J frame and we're
01:48 - going to create a component called a J
01:50 - progress bar so J progress bar and we'll
01:55 - call this bar for short equals new J
01:59 - progress bar okay now within the
02:05 - constructor let's create the frame so we
02:06 - can add the bar to the frame so frame
02:10 - dot set default close operation
02:16 - jframe dot exit on close and then frame
02:23 - dot set size pick whatever size you want
02:27 - and then I usually set no layout manager
02:34 - so set layout to null only in certain
02:38 - situations
02:39 - I like layout managers and then we need
02:41 - to take our frame and set the visibility
02:43 - to true ok now we are going to create
02:49 - the J progress bar so we're gonna set
02:52 - the initial value first so we're going
02:54 - to type bar dot set value and if you
02:58 - want to start at zero type in zero here
03:00 - don't know why you'd want to start at a
03:02 - different number but hey maybe you can
03:04 - set this to 100 and countdown for
03:06 - something all right then we're going to
03:08 - set the bounce because we're using no
03:11 - layout manager so bar dot set bounds and
03:16 - let's start in the top left corner so
03:18 - we'll set X to 0 Y to 0 and then we'll
03:21 - need to choose a length for this so
03:23 - maybe I'll type in 420 to match the size
03:25 - of my frame and then maybe 50 pixels for
03:28 - the height and then we need to add this
03:30 - bar to our frame so we'll type in frame
03:33 - dot add bar and let's see what we got so
03:37 - far going on ok we got a nice little bar
03:41 - here so that's a good start so with this
03:43 - progress bar there is actually a special
03:45 - method so type in bar and this method is
03:48 - called set string painted and then pass
03:53 - in true within here and what this does
03:56 - is that it adds a percentage to your
03:58 - progress bar and when you fill the
04:01 - progress bar or set the value this
04:03 - percentage is going to change so that's
04:06 - kind of cool alright so let's fill this
04:08 - progress bar so all we really need to do
04:10 - is just take this bar and set the value
04:13 - to something else that's like the bare
04:14 - minimum I would say but I think what
04:17 - we'll do is actually put this within a
04:19 - while loop and we'll have the value of
04:22 - our progress bar increased by a certain
04:24 - amount every second or so there are so
04:26 - many different ways that
04:27 - you can create a progress bar this is
04:29 - just like a basic demonstration so let's
04:32 - do that within a fill method so at the
04:34 - end of our constructor will call a fill
04:37 - method and we're going to declare this
04:39 - so outside of the constructor we'll make
04:42 - a public void method called fill and
04:48 - what we'll do is just set the value
04:52 - whenever we call this all right so let's
04:54 - just set this to 10 to begin with so
04:57 - when we run this it's immediately set to
04:59 - 10 now what I think we'll do is actually
05:01 - put this within a while loop and we'll
05:04 - start at 0 so we'll create a counter so
05:08 - int counter set this equal to 0 create a
05:12 - while loop and within the while loop
05:14 - what we'll do is that will continue this
05:17 - while loop as long as our counter is
05:20 - less than or equal to 100 and we're
05:25 - going to take our bar and set the value
05:29 - to whatever our counter is so if we want
05:35 - to simulate the progress bar increasing
05:38 - over time we can use the thread dot
05:41 - sleep method here and we can set this to
05:45 - maybe 1,000 milliseconds so this is
05:47 - going to pause our program for 1 second
05:50 - after each iteration of the while loop
05:51 - and we're going to need to surround this
05:53 - with a try and catch block and then
05:56 - let's increase our counter maybe by 10
06:00 - percent so we can say counter plus
06:02 - equals 10 this is the shorthand for
06:06 - saying counter equals counter plus 10 so
06:09 - let's see what happens now all right so
06:12 - it starts at 0 and it's going up by 10
06:14 - percent every second almost there all
06:21 - right I think I'm gonna speed this up a
06:24 - little bit so maybe I'll change the
06:26 - counter to increment by 1 percent each
06:28 - time and change the thread dot sleep
06:31 - method to perhaps 50 milliseconds so
06:35 - it's going to appear to go actually
06:36 - faster this time and it's increasing by
06:39 - one percent after each iteration of the
06:41 - why
06:41 - Loup all right we can also add some text
06:43 - on our bar so maybe we'll set this after
06:47 - the while loop is complete we'll display
06:49 - a message such as done so we type in the
06:52 - name of the progress bar set string and
06:55 - then you can add some text so maybe
06:58 - we'll type in done and that should be
07:06 - good so let's try it again
07:11 - and then when it's finished it says done
07:15 - but it's a little difficult to see so
07:17 - let's change the font of the progress
07:19 - bar so if we want to change the font we
07:22 - can type in bar dot set font then within
07:26 - parenthesis we're going to pass in new
07:29 - font parentheses again we can pick a
07:33 - font style I like MV Bohle it's one of
07:36 - my favorite fonts then let's set this to
07:39 - bold so font da bold and for a size
07:44 - maybe 25 but bold has to be all capital
07:50 - I forget about that sometimes okay let's
07:53 - take a look at this now alright that's
07:55 - much better you can actually see it this
07:57 - time and when it says done that's
08:00 - actually visible this time and it's not
08:02 - so small let's also change the
08:04 - foreground color so bar dot set
08:08 - foreground then within here we just send
08:11 - in a color so maybe color dot maybe red
08:15 - and let's take a look and the fill color
08:20 - is now red actually this would be kind
08:22 - of cool for some sort of HP bar for a
08:24 - videogame but you'd probably want to
08:26 - start at maybe 100 and then just
08:29 - progress this downwards and let's also
08:32 - change the background color so bar dot
08:35 - set background maybe black color dot
08:41 - black so the background is black and the
08:47 - fill color is red so another thing with
08:51 - this J progress bar within the
08:52 - constructor you can pass in a
08:54 - and a maximum value for this progress
08:57 - bar so maybe we'll set the minimum to 0
09:00 - and then the max maybe 500 actually you
09:04 - know what let's create like some sort of
09:06 - HP bar in a video game so I think what
09:09 - we'll do is actually count down words so
09:12 - we'll change our while loop we'll
09:15 - continue this as long as counter is
09:17 - greater than or equal to 1 or 0 I guess
09:22 - actually greater than 0 would be better
09:25 - and then we'll decrease our counter by
09:28 - maybe 1 so that's minus equals 1 all
09:34 - right so let's try this oh we should
09:37 - probably set our counter to whatever
09:39 - this was 500 okay that kind of appears
09:45 - to be somebody's HP training like in a
09:48 - video game that's pretty cool too but
09:51 - we'll switch back to the example we had
09:53 - previously so I'm just going to undo all
09:55 - of this but yeah you can pass in a
09:57 - minimum and a maximum value to your
09:59 - progress bar all right everybody well
10:01 - that's the basics of J progress bars and
10:04 - with this set value method of the J
10:07 - progress bar there's so many different
10:09 - things you can do with this you won't
10:11 - necessarily have your thread asleep for
10:13 - so many milliseconds before updating
10:15 - this you might link this to some sort of
10:18 - like task after the task is complete you
10:20 - can increment this counter by something
10:22 - there's really no right way or wrong way
10:24 - to do this this is just like one of a
10:27 - few different ways to demonstrate this
10:29 - concept so if you want a copy of all
10:31 - this code I'll post this in the comments
10:33 - down below but yeah that's the basics of
10:35 - how J progress bars work in Java hey you
10:39 - yeah I'm talking to you if you learn
10:41 - something new
10:42 - then you can help me help you in 3 easy
