00:02 - hey guys in this video we're going to
00:03 - create a simple calculator program now
00:06 - that we know how switches work this will
00:08 - be a very simple program let's begin by
00:10 - declaring our variables at the top we'll
00:12 - need a character for an operator
00:15 - we'll name this op the operator will be
00:17 - either addition subtraction
00:19 - multiplication or division
00:21 - double
00:22 - num1
00:24 - double num2
00:27 - double
00:28 - result
00:29 - this next part isn't necessary but i'm
00:31 - just going to add one line of text when
00:33 - we begin the program
00:35 - i'll add a bunch of asterisks let's say
00:38 - calculator
00:42 - then i'll add a new line to the end
00:46 - wherever my program ends i will create
00:48 - another line of asterisks
00:52 - and i can get rid of that newline
00:54 - character
00:56 - our code for our program will be within
00:58 - these two lines of output let's ask the
01:00 - user what operand they would like
01:03 - standard output
01:06 - enter either
01:08 - addition subtraction multiplication or
01:11 - division
01:14 - standard
01:16 - input
01:18 - will store the response within the
01:19 - variable op
01:22 - standard
01:23 - output
01:25 - enter number one
01:32 - standard input
01:34 - num1
01:36 - let's copy these two lines
01:39 - paste them
01:41 - change one here
01:43 - and here
01:44 - now we need a switch
01:47 - switch parentheses curly braces
01:50 - we're examining our operator against
01:52 - matching cases the first case will be
01:55 - addition
01:57 - make sure the operand is within single
01:59 - quotes because it's a character if the
02:01 - user wants to add two numbers we'll take
02:04 - result equals num1 plus num2
02:09 - display the result standard output
02:12 - will display the word result
02:15 - followed by the variable result
02:18 - then i'll add a new line to the end
02:22 - then break
02:24 - then we need a case for subtraction
02:30 - case
02:31 - subtraction
02:32 - num1 minus num2
02:36 - multiplication
02:39 - case
02:40 - multiplication
02:41 - num1
02:43 - times num2
02:45 - then division
02:49 - case division
02:51 - num1 divided by num2
02:54 - what if somebody doesn't type in a valid
02:56 - operator let's add a default case
02:58 - default
03:01 - standard
03:02 - output that wasn't a valid
03:07 - response
03:10 - then break
03:11 - i'll add a new line too
03:14 - okay we are good to go let's save run
03:16 - this
03:21 - calculator
03:23 - let's add two numbers
03:25 - enter number one
03:27 - one point two three
03:29 - enter number two three point one 3.14
03:32 - the result is 4.37
03:35 - let's run this again
03:37 - we will subtract two numbers
03:40 - 1.23
03:42 - minus 3.14 is negative 1.91
03:46 - let's multiply two numbers
03:49 - 1.23
03:52 - times 3.14
03:54 - that's 3.8622
03:58 - now we will divide two numbers
04:00 - 1.23 divided by 3.14
04:04 - that is 0.39172
04:09 - let's type in an operator that's not
04:10 - valid
04:12 - how about a w enter number one one point
04:15 - two three three point one four
04:18 - that wasn't a valid response
04:20 - actually i think it would be better if
04:21 - we said that wasn't a valid operator
04:25 - all right everybody that is a simple
04:27 - calculator program in c plus using a
04:30 - switch
04:31 - if you would like a copy of this code
