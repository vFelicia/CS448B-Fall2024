00:02 - hey yeah what's going on people logical
00:04 - operators there are three logical
00:07 - operators we will discuss in the series
00:09 - and or
00:11 - and not but in this video we're going to
00:13 - focus on and first the and logical
00:16 - operator which is represented by two
00:19 - ampersands checks to see if two or more
00:22 - conditions are true here's an example
00:24 - we're going to create a program that
00:26 - will check to see if a given temperature
00:28 - falls within a range so let's say we
00:30 - have a floating point number named temp
00:33 - temp short for temperature and this will
00:34 - equal some number in celsius let's say
00:37 - 25 to begin with so using an if
00:39 - statement let's check to see if temp
00:42 - is greater than or equal to zero
00:45 - if that is true then we will print
00:47 - something
00:50 - the weather is good
00:52 - else
00:54 - the weather is
00:56 - bad okay so temp is 25 therefore the
01:00 - weather is good
01:02 - okay what if our temperature is
01:04 - something extreme like 1000 degrees
01:06 - celsius so technically this condition
01:09 - would still be true the weather is
01:11 - actually not good it's fairly
01:13 - catastrophic so let's check to see if
01:15 - another condition is also true by using
01:18 - the and logical operator we're checking
01:21 - to see if temp is greater than or equal
01:23 - to zero and some other condition such as
01:26 - temp
01:27 - is less than or equal to thirty
01:31 - so if temp is at one thousand
01:34 - then the weather is bad
01:36 - this condition is true but this one is
01:39 - false using the and logical operator
01:42 - both conditions must be true in order to
01:44 - execute this statement now if our
01:47 - temperature was 25 degrees well then
01:50 - both conditions are true and we will
01:52 - execute this statement the weather is
01:55 - good
01:56 - now you can add more than one condition
01:58 - let's throw in another variable let's
02:00 - say that we have a boolean variable
02:02 - named sunny let's say that it's cloudy
02:04 - outside now if we're working with
02:06 - booleans include this header file at the
02:08 - top stdbool.h
02:10 - then let's add another condition
02:13 - and let's check to see if sunny
02:16 - is equal to true if you're checking the
02:19 - value of a boolean variable you don't
02:21 - necessarily
02:22 - have to type out equals true you can say
02:25 - sunny is equal to one or you can just
02:27 - say sunny because this would contain
02:30 - true or false so this time we are
02:32 - checking to see if temp is greater than
02:35 - or equal to zero
02:36 - and temp is less than or equal to 30 and
02:40 - sunny is true the temp is 25 but sunny
02:44 - equals false therefore we do not execute
02:46 - the statement these first two conditions
02:49 - are true but this one is false and using
02:52 - the and logical operator all conditions
02:55 - must be true
02:56 - now if i set this to be true
02:59 - well then all three of these conditions
03:01 - are true and we will execute this
03:04 - statement the weather is good so yeah
03:06 - that is the and logical operator it is
03:09 - represented by two ampersands it checks
03:12 - to see if two or more conditions are
03:14 - true and one example we used is to check
03:17 - to see if our temperature falls within a
03:19 - certain range so yeah that is the and
03:22 - logical operator in the next video we
03:23 - will discuss the or logical operator so
03:27 - if this video helped you out you can
