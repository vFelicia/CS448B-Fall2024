00:00 - hey everybody in today's topic I'm going
00:02 - to explain the auto increment attribute
00:04 - in MySQL the auto increment attribute
00:06 - can be applied to a column that is set
00:09 - as a key whenever we insert a new row
00:11 - our primary key can be populated
00:13 - automatically then each subsequent row
00:16 - is auto incremented I'm going to
00:18 - recreate this table transactions but
00:20 - first I need to drop it
00:23 - drop table transactions
00:27 - then we will recreate this table but
00:29 - apply that auto increment feature
00:32 - create table transactions
00:38 - there were two columns a transaction
00:41 - ID the data type was int and an amount
00:45 - the data type was decimal
00:48 - five digits Precision of two
00:50 - the auto increment feature can only be
00:52 - applied to a column that is set as a key
00:55 - our transaction ID will set to be the
00:58 - primary key
01:00 - to apply the auto increment feature add
01:02 - the keyword Auto
01:05 - increment
01:07 - Now by default the primary key is going
01:09 - to be set to 1.
01:11 - so after creating this table I will
01:13 - select all from transactions
01:19 - okay we have successfully created our
01:21 - table then I will insert some values
01:25 - insert into
01:27 - transactions
01:30 - R values so we don't need to explicitly
01:33 - insert a transaction ID that'll be done
01:36 - for us automatically but we still need
01:38 - an amount
01:40 - I will insert 4.99 for the first amount
01:42 - since we're not inserting all of the
01:45 - values into a row explicitly we would
01:48 - need to specify what column this value
01:50 - is for
01:51 - that is for the amount
01:55 - okay let us execute this and take a look
01:58 - yeah so the transaction ID was set to
02:01 - one even though we did not manually
02:03 - insert that value
02:04 - let's insert the next amount
02:07 - so we have 289
02:09 - yep transaction ID 2 is 289
02:13 - 3 38
02:16 - transaction ID3
02:18 - 4.99
02:20 - transaction ID of four
02:23 - we could set our primary key to begin at
02:25 - a different value
02:26 - to do that we would type alter table the
02:30 - name of the table
02:32 - Auto
02:34 - increment
02:36 - let's begin at 1000 instead of one
02:40 - then I'm going to go ahead and drop all
02:42 - the rows we'll start fresh
02:45 - delete from
02:47 - transactions
02:49 - select all from
02:52 - transactions
02:55 - okay then let's insert those rows again
02:57 - and see what happens
02:58 - insert into
03:01 - transactions
03:03 - R values
03:06 - 4.99 was the first amount
03:09 - this value is for our amount column
03:13 - now this transaction ID
03:15 - it begins at one thousand then it should
03:18 - Auto increment
03:20 - the next value was 289
03:24 - our next transaction ID is 1001
03:28 - 338
03:30 - 1002
03:32 - then 4.99
03:35 - 1003
03:37 - all right everybody that is the auto
03:39 - increment feature it's a keyword that
03:41 - can be applied to a column that is set
03:43 - as a key whenever we insert a new row
03:45 - our key will be incremented by one for
03:48 - each row that we insert but yeah that is
03:50 - auto increment in MySQL

hey everybody in today's topic I'm going to explain the auto increment attribute in MySQL the auto increment attribute can be applied to a column that is set as a key whenever we insert a new row our primary key can be populated automatically then each subsequent row is auto incremented I'm going to recreate this table transactions but first I need to drop it drop table transactions then we will recreate this table but apply that auto increment feature create table transactions there were two columns a transaction ID the data type was int and an amount the data type was decimal five digits Precision of two the auto increment feature can only be applied to a column that is set as a key our transaction ID will set to be the primary key to apply the auto increment feature add the keyword Auto increment Now by default the primary key is going to be set to 1. so after creating this table I will select all from transactions okay we have successfully created our table then I will insert some values insert into transactions R values so we don't need to explicitly insert a transaction ID that'll be done for us automatically but we still need an amount I will insert 4.99 for the first amount since we're not inserting all of the values into a row explicitly we would need to specify what column this value is for that is for the amount okay let us execute this and take a look yeah so the transaction ID was set to one even though we did not manually insert that value let's insert the next amount so we have 289 yep transaction ID 2 is 289 3 38 transaction ID3 4.99 transaction ID of four we could set our primary key to begin at a different value to do that we would type alter table the name of the table Auto increment let's begin at 1000 instead of one then I'm going to go ahead and drop all the rows we'll start fresh delete from transactions select all from transactions okay then let's insert those rows again and see what happens insert into transactions R values 4.99 was the first amount this value is for our amount column now this transaction ID it begins at one thousand then it should Auto increment the next value was 289 our next transaction ID is 1001 338 1002 then 4.99 1003 all right everybody that is the auto increment feature it's a keyword that can be applied to a column that is set as a key whenever we insert a new row our key will be incremented by one for each row that we insert but yeah that is auto increment in MySQL
