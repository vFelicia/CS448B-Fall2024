00:00 - hey everybody so today I got to explain
00:02 - conditional expressions in Python a
00:05 - conditional expression is a oneline
00:07 - shortcut for using an IFL statement if
00:10 - you're familiar with other programming
00:11 - languages this is also known as the tary
00:14 - operator it behaves similarly using
00:17 - conditional Expressions we can print or
00:19 - assign one of two values based on a
00:22 - condition here's the formula return X if
00:25 - our condition is true else return y
00:28 - here's a basic example
00:30 - we will create a variable for number
00:32 - just num let's say our number is five
00:36 - I'm going to print then within our print
00:38 - statement I will write a conditional
00:40 - expression following this formula I'll
00:43 - just copy and paste it let's check to
00:45 - see if our number is positive let's
00:49 - print the text positive if our condition
00:53 - what are we checking let's check to see
00:55 - if num is greater than zero that means
00:59 - it's positive
01:00 - if this condition is false we will
01:02 - instead print whatever comes after else
01:06 - else negative number is five that will
01:10 - print positive if our number was Nega
01:12 - five well this condition would be false
01:15 - we would instead print negative let's go
01:18 - over another let's check to see if our
01:21 - number is even or odd let's set numb to
01:25 - be
01:26 - six this time I will assign the result
01:28 - to a variable
01:30 - our result
01:32 - equals take our
01:35 - formula let's
01:38 - assign even if our
01:42 - num modulus 2 is our number divisible by
01:47 - two does that equal zero else return odd
01:53 - then let's print our
01:55 - result
01:58 - result number six that is even if it's
02:01 - five then it's
02:03 - odd assign even if our number is
02:07 - divisible by two else return
02:11 - odd let's create variables A and
02:16 - B A will equal 6 B will equal
02:21 - 7 let's create a variable of Max num
02:26 - equals follow our formula again
02:31 - return variable a if a is greater than b
02:36 - else return B between A and B which is
02:39 - the maximum number that would be B of
02:43 - seven let's find the minimum this
02:47 - time Min num a if a is less than b else
02:54 - return B the minimum number between six
02:57 - and seven is six
03:02 - this time we'll take an age age equals
03:05 - 25 we will create a variable of status
03:08 - equals use our formula
03:12 - again return a string of adult if our
03:17 - age is greater than or equal to 18 else
03:21 - return a string of child then we will
03:24 - print our status our age is 25 that's
03:28 - greater than or equal to 18 we will
03:29 - print adult if our age was 13 then we
03:34 - are a child we will instead return
03:37 - child let's work with the
03:39 - temperature temperature equals 30°
03:44 - C so that's
03:47 - hot let's create a variable of weather
03:50 - assign a string of hot if our
03:54 - temperature is greater than 20 else we
03:58 - will return a string of cold what's the
04:02 - weather outside today based on the
04:03 - temperature it is hot if our temperature
04:07 - was
04:08 - 20 then the weather is cold okay last
04:14 - example we will work with a user role I
04:18 - will set this to be
04:21 - admin we will Define a variable of
04:24 - access level
04:26 - equals again follow our formula
04:32 - return the text of full access if our
04:37 - condition of user
04:40 - role is equal to a string of admin else
04:45 - we will
04:46 - return
04:48 - limited
04:50 - access our user role is an admin let's
04:53 - print our access level and we have full
04:56 - access but what if we were a guest
05:00 - well then we have limited access all
05:02 - right everybody those are conditional
05:04 - Expressions they're a oneline shortcut
05:07 - for the if else statement it's similar
05:09 - to the tary operator and other
05:11 - programming languages using conditional
05:13 - Expressions we can print or assign one
05:16 - of two values based on a condition you
05:19 - follow the formula of return X if our
05:23 - condition is true else return y if it's
05:26 - false and well everybody those are a few
05:28 - examples of condition expressions in
05:30 - Python

hey everybody so today I got to explain conditional expressions in Python a conditional expression is a oneline shortcut for using an IFL statement if you're familiar with other programming languages this is also known as the tary operator it behaves similarly using conditional Expressions we can print or assign one of two values based on a condition here's the formula return X if our condition is true else return y here's a basic example we will create a variable for number just num let's say our number is five I'm going to print then within our print statement I will write a conditional expression following this formula I'll just copy and paste it let's check to see if our number is positive let's print the text positive if our condition what are we checking let's check to see if num is greater than zero that means it's positive if this condition is false we will instead print whatever comes after else else negative number is five that will print positive if our number was Nega five well this condition would be false we would instead print negative let's go over another let's check to see if our number is even or odd let's set numb to be six this time I will assign the result to a variable our result equals take our formula let's assign even if our num modulus 2 is our number divisible by two does that equal zero else return odd then let's print our result result number six that is even if it's five then it's odd assign even if our number is divisible by two else return odd let's create variables A and B A will equal 6 B will equal 7 let's create a variable of Max num equals follow our formula again return variable a if a is greater than b else return B between A and B which is the maximum number that would be B of seven let's find the minimum this time Min num a if a is less than b else return B the minimum number between six and seven is six this time we'll take an age age equals 25 we will create a variable of status equals use our formula again return a string of adult if our age is greater than or equal to 18 else return a string of child then we will print our status our age is 25 that's greater than or equal to 18 we will print adult if our age was 13 then we are a child we will instead return child let's work with the temperature temperature equals 30° C so that's hot let's create a variable of weather assign a string of hot if our temperature is greater than 20 else we will return a string of cold what's the weather outside today based on the temperature it is hot if our temperature was 20 then the weather is cold okay last example we will work with a user role I will set this to be admin we will Define a variable of access level equals again follow our formula return the text of full access if our condition of user role is equal to a string of admin else we will return limited access our user role is an admin let's print our access level and we have full access but what if we were a guest well then we have limited access all right everybody those are conditional Expressions they're a oneline shortcut for the if else statement it's similar to the tary operator and other programming languages using conditional Expressions we can print or assign one of two values based on a condition you follow the formula of return X if our condition is true else return y if it's false and well everybody those are a few examples of condition expressions in Python
