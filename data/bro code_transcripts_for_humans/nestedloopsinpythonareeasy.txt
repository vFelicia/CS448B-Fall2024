00:00 - hey everybody so I guess in today's
00:01 - topic I'm going to be explaining nested
00:03 - Loops it looks like so a nested Loop
00:05 - think of it as a loop found within the
00:08 - code of another loop you have a loop
00:10 - right any code within that Loop is
00:13 - indented underneath that Loop well you
00:15 - could have a looping structure found
00:17 - within the code of another looping
00:19 - structure the loop on the outside is the
00:21 - outer loop the internal Loop within the
00:24 - outer loop is known as the inner loop
00:26 - where you'll encounter nested Loops it's
00:28 - really situational you could have a
00:30 - while loop inside of a while loop a for
00:32 - Loop inside of a for Loop a for Loop
00:34 - inside of a while loop a while loop
00:35 - inside of a for Loop Etc so here's a
00:38 - demonstration let's begin by displaying
00:40 - the numbers one through nine but we'll
00:42 - use a loop 4 x x is our counter in range
00:48 - one comma ten remember that the second
00:51 - number in this case 10 that's exclusive
00:55 - then I will print our counter X
00:59 - this program will print the numbers one
01:02 - through nine
01:03 - now we have an exercise at the end of
01:05 - this topic I should probably explain
01:06 - this feature so with a print statement
01:09 - we end each print statement with a new
01:11 - line character if I need all of these
01:14 - numbers on the same line at the end of
01:16 - my print statement I can add comma and
01:20 - equals an empty string
01:23 - normally with a print statement each
01:25 - ends with the new line character but we
01:27 - can set that to be something else
01:30 - so when I run this again all of these
01:32 - numbers are on the same line or you
01:34 - could add a different symbol like Dash
01:37 - or space
01:39 - each of these characters is now
01:40 - separated with the space but let's stick
01:43 - with an empty string
01:45 - okay so we have used a loop to count the
01:47 - numbers one through nine what if I would
01:50 - like to repeat this three times
01:52 - well I could create another loop
01:55 - four x in range
01:59 - you could say one comma four or you
02:01 - could just say three either way
02:04 - whatever code is within this Loop will
02:06 - be executed three times
02:08 - let's cut our original for Loop
02:11 - then place it within the code of our new
02:14 - Loop
02:15 - our outer loop will have this code
02:17 - repeat entirely three separate times but
02:21 - we do have one thing we need to pay
02:22 - attention to we have two counters with
02:25 - the same name you'll want to be sure
02:27 - that they're different
02:28 - let's rename the counter of the inner
02:31 - loop to be y instead of X and be sure to
02:34 - change that here as well
02:37 - now when I run this code we're
02:38 - completing let's see 27 iterations to
02:42 - exit this for Loop we need to count the
02:44 - numbers one through nine once we do so
02:47 - that is one iteration of the outer loop
02:50 - but our outer loop is saying hey we
02:52 - still need three total iterations now if
02:54 - you would like these on separate lines
02:56 - let's make this look a little different
02:58 - let's add each iteration of the outer
03:00 - loop onto a new line
03:03 - So within the outer loop but not within
03:06 - the inner loop I'm going to create just
03:08 - a blank print statement this will just
03:10 - print a new line
03:12 - let's try this again
03:14 - with the inner loop we count the numbers
03:16 - one through nine after we exit the for
03:18 - Loop we will print a new line
03:21 - then repeat this all over again until
03:24 - our outer loop is satisfied so that's
03:26 - basically a nested loop it's just a loop
03:28 - that's inside of another looping
03:30 - structure so let's create a project
03:31 - we're going to print a rectangle made of
03:34 - some symbol that we set we'll have the
03:36 - user type in how many rows and columns
03:38 - this rectangle will have we'll reuse
03:40 - this code that we have already written
03:43 - so this time let's accept some user
03:44 - input rows equals input
03:50 - enter the number of rows
03:53 - then we should type cast this input as
03:55 - an integer
03:57 - let's copy this line paste it
04:01 - change rows to columns for the second
04:03 - line enter the number of
04:06 - columns
04:09 - then let's create a symbol symbol equals
04:12 - input
04:14 - enter a symbol to use
04:19 - we already have this rectangle structure
04:21 - right think of it as the outer loop is
04:24 - in charge of the rows let's change in
04:27 - range 3 to in range rows
04:31 - the inner loop will be in charge of the
04:33 - columns
04:34 - 4y in range
04:37 - columns
04:39 - we will print our symbol whatever the
04:41 - user chooses
04:43 - so let's try this again enter the number
04:45 - of rows how about four rows
04:49 - 10 columns
04:51 - I'll use a dollar sign
04:53 - so here's our rectangle
04:56 - we have four rows
04:59 - then 10 columns 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10.
05:04 - let's try one more time
05:07 - three rows
05:09 - five columns and I'll use an asterisk
05:12 - yep three rows
05:15 - five columns
05:17 - so yeah that's a nested Loop really it's
05:19 - just a loop that's inside of another
05:21 - loop the type of loop really doesn't
05:23 - matter as well as what's within each
05:25 - loop it's just a situation where you
05:27 - have a loop inside of another loop and
05:29 - yeah those are nested Loops in Python

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody so I guess in today's topic I'm going to be explaining nested Loops it looks like so a nested Loop think of it as a loop found within the code of another loop you have a loop right any code within that Loop is indented underneath that Loop well you could have a looping structure found within the code of another looping structure the loop on the outside is the outer loop the internal Loop within the outer loop is known as the inner loop where you'll encounter nested Loops it's really situational you could have a while loop inside of a while loop a for Loop inside of a for Loop a for Loop inside of a while loop a while loop inside of a for Loop Etc so here's a demonstration let's begin by displaying the numbers one through nine but we'll use a loop 4 x x is our counter in range one comma ten remember that the second number in this case 10 that's exclusive then I will print our counter X this program will print the numbers one through nine now we have an exercise at the end of this topic I should probably explain this feature so with a print statement we end each print statement with a new line character if I need all of these numbers on the same line at the end of my print statement I can add comma and equals an empty string normally with a print statement each ends with the new line character but we can set that to be something else so when I run this again all of these numbers are on the same line or you could add a different symbol like Dash or space each of these characters is now separated with the space but let's stick with an empty string okay so we have used a loop to count the numbers one through nine what if I would like to repeat this three times well I could create another loop four x in range you could say one comma four or you could just say three either way whatever code is within this Loop will be executed three times let's cut our original for Loop then place it within the code of our new Loop our outer loop will have this code repeat entirely three separate times but we do have one thing we need to pay attention to we have two counters with the same name you'll want to be sure that they're different let's rename the counter of the inner loop to be y instead of X and be sure to change that here as well now when I run this code we're completing let's see 27 iterations to exit this for Loop we need to count the numbers one through nine once we do so that is one iteration of the outer loop but our outer loop is saying hey we still need three total iterations now if you would like these on separate lines let's make this look a little different let's add each iteration of the outer loop onto a new line So within the outer loop but not within the inner loop I'm going to create just a blank print statement this will just print a new line let's try this again with the inner loop we count the numbers one through nine after we exit the for Loop we will print a new line then repeat this all over again until our outer loop is satisfied so that's basically a nested loop it's just a loop that's inside of another looping structure so let's create a project we're going to print a rectangle made of some symbol that we set we'll have the user type in how many rows and columns this rectangle will have we'll reuse this code that we have already written so this time let's accept some user input rows equals input enter the number of rows then we should type cast this input as an integer let's copy this line paste it change rows to columns for the second line enter the number of columns then let's create a symbol symbol equals input enter a symbol to use we already have this rectangle structure right think of it as the outer loop is in charge of the rows let's change in range 3 to in range rows the inner loop will be in charge of the columns 4y in range columns we will print our symbol whatever the user chooses so let's try this again enter the number of rows how about four rows 10 columns I'll use a dollar sign so here's our rectangle we have four rows then 10 columns 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10. let's try one more time three rows five columns and I'll use an asterisk yep three rows five columns so yeah that's a nested Loop really it's just a loop that's inside of another loop the type of loop really doesn't matter as well as what's within each loop it's just a situation where you have a loop inside of another loop and yeah those are nested Loops in Python
