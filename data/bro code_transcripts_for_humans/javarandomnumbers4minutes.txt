00:00 - how's it going everybody to bro hope
00:02 - you're doing well and in this video i'm
00:03 - going to teach you guys how we can
00:05 - generate some random
00:06 - values in java so sit back relax
00:09 - and enjoy the show
00:13 - you can become a hero and save our
00:15 - channel by smashing that like button
00:17 - drop a comment down below and subscribe
00:19 - if you'd like to become a fellow bro
00:22 - all right welcome back ladies and
00:24 - gentlemen in this video we're going to
00:26 - be generating some random values
00:28 - some random integers doubles and boolean
00:31 - values
00:32 - so if you're interested in game design
00:34 - at all this video is a must for you
00:36 - so in order to use random values we
00:39 - should probably
00:40 - import the random class bond within the
00:42 - library
00:43 - so outside of the class this is where
00:44 - we're going to type we're going to
00:46 - import java dot util
00:50 - dot random semicolon and now we have
00:54 - access to the random class and that
00:56 - provides us a few options
00:58 - we need an instance of the random class
01:00 - for us to use
01:01 - within the main method we're going to
01:03 - create an instance of the random class
01:04 - by typing random with a capital r
01:06 - it's the same name as the class random
01:09 - we need a name for this instance
01:11 - let's call it random all lower case kind
01:12 - of like what we did with that video on
01:15 - scanners
01:16 - random random equals new random that's
01:18 - kind of random
01:19 - then a set of parenthesis then a
01:21 - semicolon we now have access to this
01:23 - random instance to generate some random
01:25 - values for us
01:27 - but there's a disclaimer here these are
01:29 - not true random numbers but something
01:31 - called
01:32 - pseudorandom numbers which are pretty
01:33 - darn close so i just wanted to give you
01:35 - that disclaimer before we got started
01:37 - so you don't call me a liar let's
01:39 - generate a random integer
01:41 - and store this within an integer
01:43 - variable like
01:44 - into x into x equals and to generate a
01:48 - random integer
01:50 - we're going to type the name of our
01:51 - random instance
01:53 - random dot next and
01:56 - there's also a few others like next
01:58 - boolean next double
02:00 - next float i'll get to those later what
02:02 - we would like for now is
02:04 - next int and then we will display
02:07 - the result with a print line statement
02:09 - we will display the value of
02:11 - x so the results are on
02:15 - a scale between i would say just under
02:18 - negative 2 billion to just over
02:21 - positive 2 billion so you'll probably
02:23 - want to limit that
02:25 - let's pretend that we're going to roll a
02:27 - six sided dice
02:28 - so to limit the scale or the size of the
02:32 - random number that will generate
02:33 - we can pass in a value to our next
02:37 - int method so within the parentheses of
02:39 - our next int method
02:41 - we'll limit the size of the integer
02:43 - that's going to generate
02:45 - if we would like a six-sided dice we're
02:47 - going to place
02:48 - six here but there's one catch with this
02:50 - though
02:51 - this will generate a random number
02:53 - between zero and five
02:54 - because computers always start with zero
02:57 - and let's see if i can roll a zero
03:00 - nope there we go all right so one way to
03:03 - solve this is that if we want the
03:04 - numbers
03:05 - one through six we can just add one so
03:08 - now we'll get a random
03:09 - number between one and six just like
03:12 - that
03:12 - this time let's generate a random double
03:15 - value
03:15 - for now i'll turn this line into a
03:18 - comment
03:19 - and let's create a new variable called
03:21 - double
03:22 - y double y equals random
03:26 - dot next where is it
03:29 - double and we will display
03:32 - the value of y next double is going to
03:35 - give us
03:36 - a random value between zero and one
03:39 - so this probably has some uses for
03:41 - something
03:42 - what that is i'm not really sure but hey
03:44 - you know you can do this now
03:46 - let's also generate a random boolean
03:49 - value so
03:50 - boolean z equals random
03:54 - dot next boolean
03:58 - and we will display the value of z so
04:01 - this is going to give us either true
04:03 - or false well everybody that's how we
04:07 - can use the random class to generate
04:09 - some
04:09 - pseudo-random values for us if you would
04:12 - like a copy of this code i will post
04:14 - this in the comments down below
04:16 - but yeah that's a few uses of the random
04:18 - class also be sure to
04:20 - leave a like drop a random comment down
04:23 - below
04:23 - and subscribe if you'd like to become a
04:25 - fellow bro
