00:00 - well hello again everybody in today's
00:02 - video I'm going to show you how we can
00:03 - work with check boxes in PHP we need a
00:07 - form element I have the action attribute
00:09 - set to my PHP file index.php for the
00:13 - method I'm using post
00:15 - to create a checkbox we can use a
00:17 - self-closing input tag the type will be
00:21 - check box
00:23 - and here it is
00:25 - if we were to use post we will get a key
00:28 - value pair from this checkbox element
00:30 - the key will be equal to our name
00:33 - attribute
00:34 - let's say that the name is pizza
00:37 - and for the value
00:39 - let's say pizza I'm going to capitalize
00:42 - the value just so that it's easier to
00:44 - differentiate between the key and the
00:47 - value the name is the key the value as
00:50 - well the value
00:52 - then let's add some text
00:54 - Pizza
00:55 - break element
00:57 - not sure why Google wants to translate
00:59 - this but okay
01:01 - let's copy these two lines of markup
01:03 - then paste them three additional times
01:07 - the second button will be hamburger the
01:09 - third will be hot dog the fourth will be
01:11 - taco
01:12 - let's change the names the values and
01:15 - the text
01:17 - the second checkbox is hamburger
01:24 - then hot dog
01:32 - then Taco
01:39 - here are the four check boxes then we'll
01:41 - need a submit button
01:43 - input type equal submit
01:48 - for the name that will be submit as well
01:53 - now within our PHP script when I press
01:56 - this button I would like to execute some
01:58 - code after we press the submit button I
02:01 - will enclose all of my code with an if
02:03 - statement we will check to see if our
02:06 - submit button is set we'll use the is
02:08 - set function
02:10 - we'll use the post variable
02:13 - we are accessing submit
02:15 - if we click the submit button then do
02:18 - stuff
02:19 - to check to see if a checkbox is set we
02:22 - can use the is set function again
02:25 - we'll use an if statement if is set
02:29 - now we are examining
02:31 - the key of pizza
02:34 - whatever the name attribute is set to
02:39 - if Pizza is set if it's checked what we
02:42 - want to do
02:43 - let's simply Echo
02:46 - you like pizza
02:52 - when I press Pizza click submit
02:55 - we will display you like pizza
02:58 - let's do this with the other check boxes
03:00 - let's copy this if statement paste it
03:02 - three times then we'll check the other
03:04 - Keys we have hamburger
03:07 - you like hamburgers
03:10 - hot dog
03:12 - you like hot dogs
03:14 - taco
03:16 - you like tacos
03:18 - oh then let me add a break after each of
03:20 - these sentences
03:22 - because I forgot to do that
03:25 - now I can press any combination of these
03:28 - check boxes
03:30 - if one of these check boxes is checked
03:32 - we'll execute one of these if statements
03:34 - you like pizza you like hot dogs you
03:36 - like tacos
03:38 - alternatively we can determine to see if
03:40 - a checkbox is empty using the empty
03:42 - function
03:43 - let's copy our if statements
03:46 - change is set to empty
03:50 - empty empty empty
03:53 - if Pizza is unchecked if it's empty
03:56 - we'll Echo you don't like pizza
04:01 - do this for hamburgers you don't like
04:03 - hamburgers hot dogs you don't like hot
04:06 - dogs and Tacos you don't like tacos
04:12 - if I were to click pizza and Tacos again
04:15 - then submit you like pizza you like
04:18 - tacos you don't like hamburgers you
04:21 - don't like hot dogs
04:22 - that's one way in which you can check to
04:24 - see if a check box is set you can use
04:26 - the is set function to determine if it's
04:28 - set or empty to determine if it's empty
04:32 - you can place all of these check boxes
04:34 - in an array but they would all need the
04:37 - same name attribute
04:39 - let's rename the name attribute to foods
04:41 - for all of these check boxes
04:44 - then add a set of straight brackets
04:47 - after each
04:50 - these will all be placed within an array
04:56 - let's get rid of our if statements
05:00 - after pressing the submit button let's
05:03 - create a Foods array
05:05 - then we will get via post
05:10 - the key name which is Foods
05:14 - Foods is technically going to be an
05:16 - array to prove it let's Echo Foods then
05:19 - see what happens
05:22 - Pizza hamburger hot dog taco
05:25 - warning a right to string conversion
05:27 - so Foods is an array
05:29 - we can access elements of an array with
05:31 - an index number
05:34 - Foods at index 0
05:36 - that would be Pizza
05:37 - one is hamburger
05:40 - two is hot dog
05:42 - three is Taco four should be out of
05:45 - bounds
05:46 - undefined array key for
05:48 - you can Loop through all of the elements
05:50 - of an array using a for each Loop
05:53 - for each
05:56 - list your array Foods as food
06:01 - then let's Echo each food
06:05 - then I will add a break
06:10 - Pizza hamburger hot dog taco
06:13 - all right everybody so that's how to
06:14 - work with check boxes in PHP the type
06:17 - set to checkbox the name attribute will
06:20 - be the key
06:21 - and the value as well the value
06:24 - you do have the option of placing all of
06:26 - these check boxes in the same group they
06:29 - would need the same name then add a set
06:31 - of square brackets after and well
06:33 - everybody that's how to work with check
06:34 - boxes and PHP

Cleaned transcript:

well hello again everybody in today's video I'm going to show you how we can work with check boxes in PHP we need a form element I have the action attribute set to my PHP file index.php for the method I'm using post to create a checkbox we can use a selfclosing input tag the type will be check box and here it is if we were to use post we will get a key value pair from this checkbox element the key will be equal to our name attribute let's say that the name is pizza and for the value let's say pizza I'm going to capitalize the value just so that it's easier to differentiate between the key and the value the name is the key the value as well the value then let's add some text Pizza break element not sure why Google wants to translate this but okay let's copy these two lines of markup then paste them three additional times the second button will be hamburger the third will be hot dog the fourth will be taco let's change the names the values and the text the second checkbox is hamburger then hot dog then Taco here are the four check boxes then we'll need a submit button input type equal submit for the name that will be submit as well now within our PHP script when I press this button I would like to execute some code after we press the submit button I will enclose all of my code with an if statement we will check to see if our submit button is set we'll use the is set function we'll use the post variable we are accessing submit if we click the submit button then do stuff to check to see if a checkbox is set we can use the is set function again we'll use an if statement if is set now we are examining the key of pizza whatever the name attribute is set to if Pizza is set if it's checked what we want to do let's simply Echo you like pizza when I press Pizza click submit we will display you like pizza let's do this with the other check boxes let's copy this if statement paste it three times then we'll check the other Keys we have hamburger you like hamburgers hot dog you like hot dogs taco you like tacos oh then let me add a break after each of these sentences because I forgot to do that now I can press any combination of these check boxes if one of these check boxes is checked we'll execute one of these if statements you like pizza you like hot dogs you like tacos alternatively we can determine to see if a checkbox is empty using the empty function let's copy our if statements change is set to empty empty empty empty if Pizza is unchecked if it's empty we'll Echo you don't like pizza do this for hamburgers you don't like hamburgers hot dogs you don't like hot dogs and Tacos you don't like tacos if I were to click pizza and Tacos again then submit you like pizza you like tacos you don't like hamburgers you don't like hot dogs that's one way in which you can check to see if a check box is set you can use the is set function to determine if it's set or empty to determine if it's empty you can place all of these check boxes in an array but they would all need the same name attribute let's rename the name attribute to foods for all of these check boxes then add a set of straight brackets after each these will all be placed within an array let's get rid of our if statements after pressing the submit button let's create a Foods array then we will get via post the key name which is Foods Foods is technically going to be an array to prove it let's Echo Foods then see what happens Pizza hamburger hot dog taco warning a right to string conversion so Foods is an array we can access elements of an array with an index number Foods at index 0 that would be Pizza one is hamburger two is hot dog three is Taco four should be out of bounds undefined array key for you can Loop through all of the elements of an array using a for each Loop for each list your array Foods as food then let's Echo each food then I will add a break Pizza hamburger hot dog taco all right everybody so that's how to work with check boxes in PHP the type set to checkbox the name attribute will be the key and the value as well the value you do have the option of placing all of these check boxes in the same group they would need the same name then add a set of square brackets after and well everybody that's how to work with check boxes and PHP
