00:00 - yeah what's going on people so uh today
00:03 - I'm going to show you how we can accept
00:04 - some user input in JavaScript generally
00:07 - there's two good ways of doing this the
00:09 - easy way is to create a window prompt
00:11 - the professional way is to create an
00:14 - html text box of some sort and you'll
00:17 - likely need a button to submit the user
00:19 - input let's begin with the easy way
00:20 - we'll create a window prompt the first
00:23 - thing we should do is declare all of the
00:25 - variables we're going to use let's
00:27 - create a variable named username we'll
00:30 - declare it but not yet assign it then
00:32 - when we assign it we can set username
00:35 - equal to then to create a window prompt
00:38 - we can type window dot prompt
00:42 - parentheses
00:44 - then within the parentheses our window
00:46 - prompt can contain some text
00:48 - let's ask what's your username
00:53 - okay let's run this and see what happens
00:56 - what's your username I will type in my
00:58 - username press ok
01:01 - we have this variable username it will
01:04 - have a value but we should do something
01:05 - with it
01:06 - let's console DOT log
01:11 - our username
01:13 - let's try that again
01:16 - what's your username I'll type in my
01:18 - username feel free to type in yours
01:21 - let's check our Dev tools
01:25 - and here is my username
01:27 - so that's the easy way to accept user
01:29 - input with this window prompt you could
01:31 - assign declaration and assignment
01:33 - together if you want to
01:35 - you know that would also work now we
01:37 - will accept user input the professional
01:39 - Way by creating an html text box
01:43 - we will navigate to our HTML file
01:46 - okay let's create an H1 element that
01:49 - says welcome
01:52 - we'll need a text box
01:54 - we'll use a self-closing input tag
01:58 - I will set the ID of this text box to be
02:01 - my text
02:04 - I'll create a label for this text box
02:06 - too because if we're a user we don't
02:08 - know what we're supposed to type in here
02:11 - I will create a label
02:15 - the text within the label will be
02:17 - username
02:20 - then a submit button
02:24 - button
02:26 - the text will be submit
02:28 - I'll put this on a new line I'll add a
02:30 - Break Tag
02:32 - maybe two
02:34 - make it look nice
02:35 - for the ID of the button
02:37 - I'll set the ID to be my submit
02:42 - let's see if this works
02:44 - this is a little Advanced when we click
02:47 - on this button we're going to execute a
02:49 - function but we need to select this
02:51 - button
02:52 - we will access the document of our web
02:55 - page
02:56 - get element by ID
03:00 - the ID that we're getting is the ID of
03:03 - the button my submit
03:05 - So within quotes type the name of the ID
03:09 - follow this with DOT on click
03:13 - equals
03:15 - here we'll write everything we're going
03:17 - to do after clicking the button
03:19 - we need a function
03:21 - function parentheses curly braces
03:24 - everything between this set of curly
03:26 - braces is everything we'll do when we
03:29 - click on the button
03:31 - so first we need a username variable
03:34 - outside of the function
03:36 - when we click on the button
03:38 - get the text from this text box
03:41 - we will reassign our username then set
03:43 - the SQL to the text from the text box
03:47 - we'll use document.getelementbyid
03:50 - [Music]
03:52 - the ID that we're getting this time is
03:54 - my text
03:59 - we need the value of the text box so
04:02 - follow this with DOT value
04:05 - all right then to test this let's
04:08 - console DOT log
04:10 - the username
04:14 - all right let's type in our username
04:16 - press submit
04:18 - then check devtools
04:21 - yeah there it is
04:23 - okay let's replace console.log
04:26 - we'll change the text content of our H1
04:28 - element
04:30 - I will give this H1 element a unique ID
04:33 - let's say my H1
04:37 - we need to select my H1 element
04:41 - document.getelementbyid the ID was my H1
04:46 - we are changing the text
04:49 - content equal to
04:52 - let's use a template literal hello
04:56 - username
04:58 - all right let's try this again type in
05:00 - your username
05:01 - press submit and that should change the
05:04 - H1 element hello whatever your name is
05:08 - all right everybody so those are two
05:10 - different ways to accept user input you
05:12 - can use a window prompt or you can use
05:14 - an html text box and that is how to
05:17 - accept user input in JavaScript
