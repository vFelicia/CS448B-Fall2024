00:02 - hey welcome back margins margins are the
00:05 - space around an element here's what
00:08 - we're gonna do we're going to create two
00:09 - boxes i'll use a development
00:12 - and give this development an id of box
00:15 - one
00:16 - and let's do the same thing for box two
00:19 - but change one to two and within each
00:21 - box we will generate some random content
00:23 - so type lorem and then tab to generate
00:26 - some sample text and do the same thing
00:28 - for box two okay that's everything we'll
00:31 - need within our html document within our
00:33 - css document let's style both of our
00:36 - boxes
00:37 - so let's begin with box one and we'll
00:39 - just copy everything over to box two
00:42 - so i would like a border of 5 pixels
00:45 - solid
00:46 - a width of 250
00:49 - a height of 250.
00:52 - let's change the font size to 22 pixels
00:57 - and change the background pick a
00:59 - background color that you like
01:02 - okay let's copy this and paste it for
01:04 - box two so change box one to box two and
01:07 - i would recommend picking a different
01:09 - color
01:10 - okay we have box one and box two margins
01:13 - are the space around an element you can
01:16 - see that we naturally have a little bit
01:18 - of margin between these boxes the body
01:20 - element of our document has about eight
01:23 - pixels worth of margin and let's take a
01:25 - look at that so i'm going to style our
01:27 - body and add a border
01:30 - maybe 2 pixel solid this is the boundary
01:33 - of our body wherever this border is so
01:35 - we have 8 pixels of margin outside of
01:38 - our border we can actually get rid of
01:40 - that so that these boxes are touching
01:42 - the sides of the viewport by setting
01:45 - margin within our body to zero pixels
01:48 - and these boxes are now touching the
01:51 - sides of our viewport so margin is the
01:53 - space around an element but margin is
01:56 - easily confused with padding padding is
01:59 - the space between the content and the
02:02 - border for example i'll add 10 pixels
02:05 - worth of padding to box one
02:07 - this space between the content and the
02:09 - border is padding
02:11 - and i'll just casually increase the
02:13 - padding just so it's more visible
02:16 - this space between the content and the
02:17 - border is padding it's easily confused
02:20 - with margin now margin is the space
02:23 - outside of a border we can select margin
02:26 - top bottom left right let's begin with
02:29 - top margin top i'll set this to 50
02:32 - pixels
02:34 - so we're saying at the top of this
02:36 - element add 50 pixels worth of margin
02:39 - this element along with any elements
02:42 - underneath it will be pushed down by 50
02:44 - pixels
02:45 - likewise i can apply this to the left
02:49 - and this will push this element 50
02:51 - pixels to the left same thing goes with
02:53 - the bottom
02:55 - any elements underneath this margin will
02:57 - be pushed by this amount
02:59 - and there's also margin right but
03:01 - there's nothing to the right of this
03:02 - element because it is a block level
03:04 - element
03:06 - if i need to apply some amount of margin
03:09 - all around an element i can just say
03:12 - margin
03:13 - then that amount 50 and then we don't
03:16 - need four separate lines this would do
03:18 - the same thing in one line
03:20 - you can use percentages instead of
03:22 - pixels so that way when you resize this
03:24 - window it resizes dynamically so if i
03:28 - were to set margin left to 50 percent
03:32 - this margin will use up as much space as
03:35 - 50 of the width of our window
03:39 - okay one trick if you need this element
03:41 - to stick to the right hand side of your
03:43 - window
03:44 - you can set margin to auto
03:47 - and the margin on the left hand side
03:49 - will be automatically calculated so it's
03:51 - going to push this element to the right
03:54 - this will all be margin
03:56 - and likewise you can do the same thing
03:58 - with margin right then this element will
04:00 - stick to the left hand side because the
04:03 - margin on the right is taking up all the
04:05 - space on the right side of this element
04:07 - here's a trick if you set both margin
04:10 - left and margin right to auto then this
04:14 - element will stay horizontally centered
04:16 - in the middle of your document so yeah
04:18 - that's a little bit about margins and if
04:20 - you ever forget how margins work if you
04:22 - right click on an element then go to
04:24 - inspect there will be a diagram right
04:26 - here so it shows that our content is 250
04:29 - by 250
04:31 - any padding if there is any the width of
04:33 - the border and the width of the margin
04:36 - and here are the values so yeah that's a
04:38 - little bit about margins it is the space
04:41 - around an element
04:42 - so yeah those are margins if you found
