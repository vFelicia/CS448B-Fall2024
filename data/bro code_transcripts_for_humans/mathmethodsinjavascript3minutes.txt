00:01 - all right everybody let's talk about
00:03 - javascript math math is an intrinsic
00:06 - object that provides basic mathematics
00:08 - functionality and constants there's a
00:11 - lot of functions i think that you would
00:12 - find useful in this example we have a
00:15 - variable x and x equals 3.14 feel free
00:19 - to choose any number that you want maybe
00:21 - i need to round this variable well
00:23 - there's a built-in function of math that
00:25 - can do that for us i could just type x
00:28 - equals then type math
00:31 - dot
00:32 - and then i have access to a bunch of
00:33 - different functions i would like to
00:35 - round x so add a set of parentheses and
00:38 - pass in a value or a variable that you
00:41 - would like to round and then if i was to
00:44 - display the value of x with console.log
00:48 - this would display my value or variable
00:50 - rounded whatever's within the set of
00:52 - parentheses of this function and x
00:54 - rounded is three let's cover a few more
00:58 - the floor function will always round a
01:01 - number down if this variable was 3.99
01:05 - the floor function will always round
01:07 - down x is still three if you need to
01:09 - round up there is the ceiling function
01:12 - which is shortened to c e i l
01:16 - if x is 3.14
01:18 - seal will round up
01:20 - x is now 4. you can raise a value to a
01:23 - given power
01:25 - x equals
01:26 - math.pow in the parentheses you'll give
01:29 - a base and an exponent each is separated
01:31 - with a comma
01:33 - x to the power of 2 is 9.8
01:36 - x to the power of 3
01:38 - is 30.9 their square root x equals math
01:42 - dot square root sqrt for short
01:46 - the square root of x
01:49 - is 1.77
01:51 - to find an absolute value you can use
01:53 - the absolute value function x equals
01:56 - math.abs the absolute value is the
01:59 - distance away from zero if x was
02:02 - negative 3.14 the distance away from
02:05 - zero would result in a positive number
02:07 - positive 3.14 this time we have a couple
02:10 - variables and we need to find the
02:11 - maximum and the minimum we'll create two
02:13 - more variables let y equal
02:16 - i don't know what about five
02:19 - let z
02:20 - equal nine i'll declare a maximum and a
02:24 - minimum
02:25 - let maximum
02:26 - let minimum
02:28 - i will assign maximum equal to
02:32 - math.max function
02:34 - and pass in x y and z
02:37 - this will return the maximum and assign
02:40 - it
02:40 - so the maximum between x y and z
02:43 - is nine then there's also minimum
02:47 - so minimum equals math.min
02:52 - the minimum between x y and z is x 3.14
02:57 - there's also some built-in constants too
02:59 - with x i assigned 3.14 i would like to
03:03 - assign pi with more digits well there is
03:06 - a built-in constant of math
03:08 - x equals
03:09 - math.pi and when i display x x is
03:13 - 3.141592653589793
03:18 - so math is an intrinsic object that
03:20 - provides basic mathematics functionality
03:23 - and constants there's a lot more
03:25 - functions and constants than what we
03:26 - covered but here's a few of the basics
03:28 - so yeah that is javascript math if you
03:31 - found this video helpful you can help me
03:33 - out by smashing that like button leave a
