00:00 - what's going on everybody it's you bro
00:02 - hope you're doing well and in this video
00:04 - i'm going to show you how you can create
00:05 - a button using html so sit back relax
00:08 - and enjoy the show
00:12 - hey in this video i'm going to show you
00:14 - how we can create buttons using html
00:16 - we'll need a pair of button tags there's
00:19 - an opening button tag and a closing
00:20 - button tag here's our button to add some
00:23 - text between the button tags we can add
00:26 - whatever text we want to the button like
00:28 - click me
00:29 - you can set this up as a hyperlink when
00:31 - you click on the button to do so just
00:33 - around your button element with a pair
00:35 - of a tags
00:36 - there's an opening a tag and a closing a
00:38 - tag
00:39 - and i will set the href attribute of the
00:42 - opening button tag to a url or relative
00:45 - file path of my choosing to make this
00:47 - simple let's set the url to google.com
00:54 - and then when i click on this button it
00:56 - takes me to google you can disable a
00:58 - button by adding a disabled boolean
01:01 - attribute to the opening button tag and
01:04 - we can no longer click on this button
01:06 - if you know a little bit of css you can
01:08 - add some css properties directly to a
01:10 - button by setting the style attribute
01:13 - equal to and list some css properties of
01:16 - your choosing let's change the
01:19 - background color
01:21 - you can pick a color name
01:25 - you can use rgb values
01:28 - or you can use hexadecimal values
01:32 - i think i'll set this to a dark gray
01:34 - color so maybe
01:36 - six threes
01:37 - four rgb values and hexadecimal values
01:40 - you can always use a color picker online
01:43 - so if you would like to add multiple css
01:45 - properties separate each css property
01:48 - with a semicolon and next i will change
01:50 - the color that's the font color and
01:53 - maybe i'll pick green one color i like
01:56 - is zero zero ff zero zero that's just a
01:59 - bright green color you can also round
02:02 - these borders too by using the border
02:04 - radius property
02:06 - so again separate each css property with
02:08 - a semicolon
02:10 - and i will set the border radius
02:13 - property to 5 pixels just around the
02:16 - corners
02:17 - okay cool
02:18 - that's a pretty fancy looking button if
02:20 - i do say so myself and yep it still
02:22 - takes us to google just by us using html
02:26 - this adds structure to a webpage but it
02:28 - doesn't necessarily add functionality
02:30 - that's where a language like javascript
02:32 - comes in when we click on a button we
02:34 - can have this button execute some
02:37 - function from a javascript file i'll
02:39 - show you how we can create a very simple
02:41 - javascript program but of course we'll
02:43 - cover this more in the javascript series
02:46 - so let's get rid of this hyperlink
02:49 - and have our button do something else
02:51 - there is an on
02:53 - click attribute that we can set to a
02:55 - javascript function
02:57 - so we just place the name of the
02:59 - function between a set of double quotes
03:02 - we haven't created a javascript function
03:04 - yet but let's say that we'll have a
03:06 - javascript function named do something
03:09 - and then follow that name with a set of
03:10 - parentheses and let's create a paragraph
03:13 - element
03:15 - and we will say hello and then close it
03:18 - with this paragraph element i'm going to
03:21 - set the id attribute equal to let's say
03:24 - test here's how we can code a very
03:26 - simple javascript program you're going
03:29 - to create a pair of script tags there's
03:32 - an opening script tag and a closing
03:34 - script tag
03:36 - and within the script i will say
03:38 - function
03:40 - do something
03:42 - parentheses curly braces
03:44 - so this function will perform some
03:47 - subsection of code so when we click on
03:49 - our button what do we want this program
03:51 - to do we will take document dot
03:55 - get
03:56 - element
03:57 - by
03:58 - id
03:59 - parentheses
04:00 - list the id of our paragraph element
04:03 - test
04:05 - dot
04:06 - inner
04:07 - html
04:08 - and i will set the sequel to
04:11 - good bye
04:13 - then add a semicolon at the end okay so
04:16 - when we click on this button it's going
04:17 - to execute this function do something
04:20 - and then perform whatever code is
04:22 - between this set of curly braces
04:25 - so you may need to save
04:27 - refresh your webpage and if done
04:29 - correctly when you click on this button
04:31 - it will change this text
04:34 - from hello
04:35 - to goodbye
04:36 - so that is a very small javascript
04:39 - program so there is an on click
04:42 - attribute that you can set equal to a
04:44 - javascript function but of course we'll
04:47 - cover more about javascript well in the
04:49 - javascript playlist but that's one way
04:51 - in which you can add functionality to a
04:53 - button in this video we were more
04:55 - focused on actually creating the button
04:57 - itself so yeah if this video helped you
04:59 - out you can help me out by smashing that
05:01 - like button leave a random comment down
05:03 - below and subscribe if you'd like to
05:05 - become a fellow bro
