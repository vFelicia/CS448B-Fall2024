00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's your
00:01 - bro here hope you're doing well and in
00:03 - this video i'm going to teach you guys
00:04 - all about
00:04 - mouse events in python so sit back relax
00:07 - and enjoy the show
00:10 - if you find this video helpful please
00:12 - remember to like
00:14 - comment and subscribe your support will
00:16 - help keep this channel running
00:18 - hey everyone we're going to be
00:19 - discussing mouse events in python so
00:21 - before we begin
00:22 - we'll need a window so window equals tk
00:25 - followed by window.main loop
00:27 - and in the last video we learned that we
00:29 - can bind
00:30 - a widget or a window so that when a
00:33 - certain event occurs we can call a
00:35 - function
00:35 - so we're going to do the same thing for
00:37 - this video but we have
00:39 - various mouse events that we can cover
00:41 - so we're going to use the window
00:43 - window.bind
00:44 - function and this takes two arguments an
00:47 - event
00:47 - as well as a function name so let's
00:50 - define
00:51 - a function let's call it the do
00:52 - something function
00:54 - so do something and we'll need to define
00:56 - this so at the top
00:58 - d e f do something
01:01 - and remember that we need to set up one
01:03 - parameter for this function
01:05 - the parameter is an event and then we'll
01:08 - just print something print
01:10 - you did a thing
01:14 - okay so there are various mouse events
01:17 - for a left
01:18 - button click within quotes and then
01:21 - within angle brackets
01:22 - a left button click is button dash one
01:26 - so then if we were to click within this
01:29 - window
01:30 - it's going to call our function you did
01:32 - a thing
01:33 - but if i were to right click it doesn't
01:35 - do anything
01:37 - so there are other mouse events too so
01:40 - button two
01:40 - is that scroll wheel not if you scroll
01:43 - up or down but if you press
01:44 - in on it so right now i'm clicking left
01:47 - i'm clicking right
01:48 - now i'm going to press in on the mouse
01:50 - wheel and it says
01:51 - you did a thing button three is a right
01:55 - mouse click
02:00 - so i'm clicking left nothing but i'm
02:02 - gonna click right
02:04 - and that seems to work all right so
02:06 - button one i'm just going to add a note
02:09 - left mouse click button two
02:14 - is the scroll wheel
02:18 - that's if you press in on it and then
02:20 - button three
02:21 - is a right mouse click
02:24 - so did you guys know we can actually get
02:27 - the x and y
02:28 - coordinates of where this event occurred
02:29 - so to do that we type in
02:31 - the name of the event dot x however
02:35 - since we're displaying this along with
02:36 - some text we'll need to
02:38 - convert this to a string so
02:41 - string event dot x then i'll add the y
02:45 - coordinates as well
02:48 - event event.y i think i'll just add a
02:51 - comma between these to separate them
02:55 - and we'll change our text so we'll say
02:58 - mouse coordinates
03:02 - all right let's try this again so this
03:04 - is going to
03:05 - give us the coordinates of where we
03:07 - click and right now i'm just left
03:08 - clicking
03:12 - so the top left corner is zero zero
03:15 - well at least close to it not there
03:17 - exactly
03:19 - all right so here's a few other events
03:21 - that we can cover
03:24 - i'm going to copy this we have button
03:27 - release
03:29 - if we were to release a button it's
03:31 - going to trigger
03:32 - our event so right now i'm holding in
03:35 - on the left mouse button but i'm going
03:37 - to let go
03:38 - then it triggers our event if i were to
03:41 - right click
03:42 - and hold it it doesn't do anything but
03:44 - as soon as i let go
03:45 - then our event is triggered we also have
03:48 - enter
03:49 - not to be confused with the enter button
03:52 - just going to get rid of that so that
03:55 - is enter if we were to enter our binded
03:59 - window
04:00 - or widget
04:03 - so if i were to enter it's going to give
04:05 - the coordinates of where i entered this
04:09 - there is also leave
04:12 - so i'm going to say that enter
04:16 - the window
04:21 - and leave is leave the window
04:28 - so if i enter nothing happens but as
04:30 - soon as i leave it gives the coordinates
04:35 - and the last one is motion as long as
04:38 - the cursor is in motion so this one
04:42 - might be good for
04:43 - a game so that is motion
04:48 - where the mouse
04:51 - moved
04:55 - so it's consistently giving me the
04:56 - coordinates if i'm moving the mouse but
04:58 - if i were
04:59 - stationary or stop moving it stops
05:03 - all right so that's the basics of mouse
05:05 - events in python if you want to copy of
05:07 - all this code
05:08 - i'll post all of this in the comments
05:09 - down below but yeah that's the basics
05:11 - of mouse events in python hey you
05:15 - yeah i'm talking to you if you learn
05:17 - something new then you can help me
05:19 - help you in three easy steps by smashing
