00:00 - what's going on everybody it's bro hope
00:02 - you're doing well and in this video i'm
00:04 - going to explain keyword arguments in
00:05 - python so
00:06 - sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:11 - if you find this video helpful please
00:13 - remember to like
00:14 - comment and subscribe your support will
00:17 - help keep this channel running
00:19 - all right everybody let's discuss
00:21 - keyword arguments
00:22 - these are arguments that are preceded by
00:25 - an identifier when we pass them to a
00:27 - function
00:28 - the order of the arguments doesn't
00:30 - matter unlike positional arguments
00:32 - which do matter and we've been working
00:34 - with positional arguments already
00:36 - and python knows the names of the
00:38 - arguments that our function receives
00:40 - when we use keyword arguments here's an
00:42 - example of us
00:43 - using positional arguments and then i'll
00:45 - demonstrate the benefits of
00:46 - keyword arguments let's say we have a
00:49 - function called hello
00:50 - that accepts three arguments a first
00:52 - name a middle name and a last name
00:54 - and the output will be hello first name
00:56 - middle name last name
00:58 - so if i were to run this this will
00:59 - display hello bro
01:01 - dude code so we're using positional
01:04 - arguments
01:04 - the order of the arguments does matter
01:06 - what do you think is going to happen if
01:08 - i were to replace some of these values
01:10 - let's say i will swap the first argument
01:12 - with the
01:14 - third argument so let's try it again
01:17 - hello code dude bro so obviously the
01:20 - order of the arguments matters
01:22 - and now if we were to use keyword
01:24 - arguments then the order of the
01:25 - arguments
01:26 - doesn't matter but with each argument we
01:28 - need to precede each argument with
01:31 - a unique identifier and that identifier
01:34 - is the name of the parameter we want to
01:36 - associate each argument with
01:38 - so for my intended last name i will use
01:41 - an identifier of
01:42 - last to match this parameter so
01:45 - dude will be middle middle equals dude
01:48 - and bro
01:49 - will be first even though they're not in
01:51 - the correct order so let's try this
01:53 - again
01:53 - and my output is hello bro dude code
01:57 - so that's all about keyword arguments
01:59 - they are arguments
02:00 - preceded with an identifier when we pass
02:02 - them to a function
02:04 - the order of the arguments doesn't
02:05 - matter unlike positional arguments
02:07 - which do matter and then python knows
02:09 - the names of the arguments
02:10 - that our function receives when we use
02:12 - keyword arguments
02:14 - so that's it for keyword arguments if
02:16 - you would like a copy of this code
02:18 - i will post this in the comment section
02:20 - down below but yeah that's how keyword
02:22 - arguments
02:22 - work in python
02:26 - hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you
02:28 - learned something new
02:29 - then help me help you in three easy
02:31 - steps
02:32 - by smashing that like button drop a
02:34 - comment down below
02:35 - and subscribe if you'd like to become a
02:37 - fellow bro
02:50 - [Music]
03:00 - you
