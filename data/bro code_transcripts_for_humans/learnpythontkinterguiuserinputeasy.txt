00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's you
00:01 - bro here hope you're doing well and in
00:03 - this video i'm going to teach you guys
00:04 - how we can use
00:05 - the entry widget in python to accept
00:08 - some user input
00:09 - so sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:14 - if you find this video helpful please
00:15 - remember to like
00:17 - comment and subscribe your support will
00:19 - help keep this channel running
00:21 - all right everybody let's discuss the
00:23 - entry widget
00:25 - what this is is that it's a text box
00:27 - that accepts a single line of user input
00:30 - a comparable example would be let's say
00:32 - that you're logging into a website with
00:34 - your user information and password
00:36 - well those text boxes that you enter
00:38 - your information into and hit submit
00:40 - could be an example of something similar
00:43 - to an entry widget for python
00:45 - so before we begin make sure you have
00:47 - this import at the top
00:48 - and then we'll create a window to add
00:50 - this entry widget to
00:51 - so we'll create a window called window
00:54 - window equals
00:55 - tk and then window.main
00:59 - loop to actually display this let's just
01:02 - test this
01:03 - yes it's working so in order to create
01:05 - the entry widget we'll create a name for
01:07 - this instance of the entry widget
01:09 - so let's just call this entry entry
01:12 - equals
01:13 - entry and we don't necessarily need to
01:16 - pass in any arguments at this time
01:18 - and then we're going to either pack this
01:20 - entry or place it on the window
01:22 - so entry and let's just use pack for now
01:26 - so this should display our entry widget
01:29 - however you can barely see it and it
01:31 - kind of blends in with the background
01:33 - but you can still type in something
01:36 - all right so let's mess with some of the
01:39 - configurations
01:40 - for this entry widget so let's begin by
01:43 - changing the
01:44 - font size so we can do that by typing in
01:48 - entry dot config
01:51 - font equals and then we can mess with
01:54 - the
01:54 - font style or the font size so i think
01:58 - i'll pick
02:00 - ink free but pick whatever font you want
02:03 - and then a size so font size 50
02:07 - and let's try this again that's a little
02:09 - bit better let's type in something
02:11 - bro code blah blah blah
02:14 - all right not too bad so let's change
02:17 - the background color now
02:18 - well there's not really any good reason
02:20 - to but you can so let's try it
02:22 - entry dot config
02:25 - bg for background color then you can
02:28 - always list a name
02:29 - like black you know
02:33 - blue red whatever you want
02:36 - uh but let's pick a hexadecimal value so
02:39 - you can always look those up
02:41 - i will pick all ones so that looks
02:44 - something like this
02:46 - so let's type in something again but you
02:47 - can barely see the text
02:49 - so let's change the foreground color so
02:52 - that is done
02:53 - with fg entry dot config
02:56 - fg for foreground and i will pick green
03:00 - so the hexadecimal value for that is 0
03:02 - zero
03:03 - f f zero zero otherwise you can just put
03:06 - something like
03:07 - green here and that works just fine too
03:09 - but make sure you take out the number
03:11 - sign
03:12 - and let's try it again bro
03:16 - i think i'll make this a very bright
03:19 - green though because that's kind of dull
03:21 - uh so that's zero zero ff zero zero
03:26 - and let's try it again
03:30 - what up bro all right that's not too bad
03:35 - let's also insert some text so this is
03:38 - some default text
03:39 - so we can do that with entry dot insert
03:43 - we'll place a positional argument we'll
03:47 - start with zero
03:48 - and then we can enter in some default
03:50 - text like
03:52 - spongebob so then when we run this
03:55 - the default text says whatever we type
03:57 - here so now it says
03:59 - spongebob but i think i'll remove that
04:02 - for now
04:04 - you can also disable this text box as
04:06 - well so we can do that with
04:08 - entry dot config
04:12 - state equals disabled
04:18 - so we can no longer type in anything
04:19 - within
04:21 - this entry text box so i'll add a
04:24 - comment that this is either active
04:26 - or disabled but i'll turn this into a
04:29 - comment because we still got a lot more
04:31 - to do with this
04:32 - we can also set a width so this width is
04:36 - in number of characters so that is
04:39 - entry dot config width
04:43 - and let's set the max to maybe 10.
04:49 - so this doesn't cap or max out the
04:52 - number of characters that you can type
04:53 - in
04:54 - it's just really for the size of the
04:57 - entry box
04:58 - so it's only going to display a max of
05:00 - 10 characters at once but
05:02 - let's test it out so one two three four
05:04 - five six seven eight nine
05:06 - zero all right so if we type in more
05:10 - numbers than that
05:11 - more than ten it's going to kind of
05:13 - scroll through the numbers
05:15 - but yeah i'll keep it at time that's
05:17 - fine oh i got a good one for you guys
05:20 - so this next one is entry dot config
05:23 - show show equals a certain character
05:26 - so let's set this to asterisk so this
05:30 - will hide all of the characters within
05:32 - the text box and it's going to replace
05:34 - them with whatever character you have
05:36 - here
05:36 - so this would work perfect for some sort
05:39 - of password
05:40 - so if i were to type in something it's
05:42 - only going to display
05:43 - whatever character that we have here so
05:45 - this works perfect
05:46 - for a password so we can actually change
05:49 - this to it doesn't necessarily have to
05:51 - be an asterisk
05:52 - let's replace this with the dollar sign
05:55 - so when we type in something it's only
05:57 - going to display
05:59 - as whatever character we placed here
06:02 - so that's how you can create a hidden
06:04 - password of some sort
06:06 - now what good is an entry text box if we
06:08 - can't actually submit something
06:10 - so let's create a submit button so make
06:14 - sure you've seen the video on
06:16 - buttons for python before you dive into
06:18 - this portion so let's create a button
06:21 - we'll call this submit it's going to be
06:23 - a submit button so submit
06:25 - equals button we're adding this to our
06:29 - window
06:30 - and let's set the text text equals
06:35 - submit and then we're going to set
06:38 - the command for this to equal
06:42 - submit so we're going to create a
06:44 - function called
06:45 - submit uh so we'll do that right before
06:48 - we create this window i think
06:51 - so d e f submit
06:56 - what do we want this button to do when
06:58 - we click it
07:00 - so we'll create a variable maybe
07:02 - username
07:04 - equals and then to retrieve the text
07:07 - from
07:07 - a entry widget we type in the name
07:11 - of the widget entry dot get
07:15 - so this retrieves the text that we
07:17 - entered in
07:18 - and stores it within a variable called
07:20 - user
07:21 - and then let's just print this print
07:25 - user name all right and then
07:28 - we need to add the button to the window
07:31 - so we can just simply do that with pack
07:34 - submit dot pack
07:38 - and let's take a look alright so this
07:41 - button is on the top we can actually
07:43 - change uh
07:43 - the position in which it's in so within
07:47 - the parenthesis of pack what we can do
07:49 - is place this
07:50 - on a particular side so let's say that
07:53 - we want this on the right side so
07:55 - side equals right and that's a little
07:58 - bit better
07:59 - let's type in a name like bro
08:03 - hit submit and it displays our name in
08:05 - the console window
08:07 - here's a crazy idea when we print our
08:09 - username let's concatenate this with
08:11 - another string
08:12 - so maybe we can display hello before the
08:15 - username
08:16 - so hello plus username
08:20 - so type in whatever your name is
08:23 - bro submit and it says hello bro
08:27 - pretty cool right now let's create a
08:30 - delete button
08:31 - so honestly we'll just copy all this
08:33 - that we have for our submit button
08:36 - and we'll change submit to delete
08:44 - and we'll change the text here as well
08:47 - to delete and the command to delete so
08:51 - we'll make a
08:52 - delete function so delete delete delete
08:56 - delete
08:57 - then let's create a delete function so
09:00 - def delete
09:05 - all right so to delete the text in an
09:08 - entry widget
09:09 - we can do entry dot
09:13 - delete we place two positional arguments
09:17 - within here
09:18 - so we want to clear everything with this
09:20 - delete button
09:21 - so the first positional argument is
09:23 - going to be zero
09:24 - the second is going to be end
09:27 - and what this does and i'll just make
09:29 - this a comment
09:31 - is that this deletes the
09:34 - line of text
09:37 - and we'll set this to the right side
09:40 - right next to the submit button
09:42 - and let's test this my name
09:45 - is bro something and we're going to
09:50 - delete this and everything is cleared
09:52 - out and even if we hit submit it doesn't
09:55 - really do anything it just displays
09:56 - hello
09:57 - let's create a backspace button so
10:01 - we'll copy this
10:04 - we'll change delete to backspace
10:08 - we're only going to delete one character
10:09 - at a time and that character is going to
10:12 - be at the very end of our string of text
10:14 - so backspace backspace text
10:18 - equals backspace
10:21 - and command backspace
10:24 - and we'll create a backspace function
10:28 - so we'll do that at the top d e f
10:32 - backspace
10:36 - all right so this is going to get a
10:37 - little bit tricky
10:39 - entry dot delete
10:42 - and we're going to place two positional
10:44 - arguments the second
10:47 - is going to be end because we want to
10:51 - delete the last character in our line of
10:54 - text
10:55 - and the first character the first
10:57 - positional argument
10:58 - is going to be entry
11:02 - dot get basically what we have here
11:06 - except we're going to take the length of
11:08 - this
11:10 - place this all within parentheses and
11:12 - then subtract
11:13 - one and this will delete
11:17 - last character
11:20 - and now let's test this
11:24 - so we have backspace delete and submit
11:27 - let's type in our name so for me that's
11:29 - bro
11:30 - code then when i hit backspace it only
11:32 - deletes the last character
11:35 - however the delete button will still
11:36 - clear everything
11:38 - and then for the last time let's check
11:40 - submit so
11:42 - bro code then submit hello bro code
11:46 - cool so all of our buttons are now
11:48 - working
11:49 - well ladies and gentlemen that is the
11:50 - basics of the entry widget for
11:52 - python if you would like a copy of all
11:54 - this code i'll post all of this in the
11:56 - comments down below
11:57 - but yeah that's the basics of the entry
11:59 - widget for python
12:02 - hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you
12:05 - learn something new
12:06 - then you can help me help you in three
12:09 - easy steps
12:10 - by smashing that like button drop a
12:12 - comment down below
12:13 - and subscribe if you'd like to become a
12:15 - fellow bro

hey what's going on everybody it's you bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can use the entry widget in python to accept some user input so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running all right everybody let's discuss the entry widget what this is is that it's a text box that accepts a single line of user input a comparable example would be let's say that you're logging into a website with your user information and password well those text boxes that you enter your information into and hit submit could be an example of something similar to an entry widget for python so before we begin make sure you have this import at the top and then we'll create a window to add this entry widget to so we'll create a window called window window equals tk and then window.main loop to actually display this let's just test this yes it's working so in order to create the entry widget we'll create a name for this instance of the entry widget so let's just call this entry entry equals entry and we don't necessarily need to pass in any arguments at this time and then we're going to either pack this entry or place it on the window so entry and let's just use pack for now so this should display our entry widget however you can barely see it and it kind of blends in with the background but you can still type in something all right so let's mess with some of the configurations for this entry widget so let's begin by changing the font size so we can do that by typing in entry dot config font equals and then we can mess with the font style or the font size so i think i'll pick ink free but pick whatever font you want and then a size so font size 50 and let's try this again that's a little bit better let's type in something bro code blah blah blah all right not too bad so let's change the background color now well there's not really any good reason to but you can so let's try it entry dot config bg for background color then you can always list a name like black you know blue red whatever you want uh but let's pick a hexadecimal value so you can always look those up i will pick all ones so that looks something like this so let's type in something again but you can barely see the text so let's change the foreground color so that is done with fg entry dot config fg for foreground and i will pick green so the hexadecimal value for that is 0 zero f f zero zero otherwise you can just put something like green here and that works just fine too but make sure you take out the number sign and let's try it again bro i think i'll make this a very bright green though because that's kind of dull uh so that's zero zero ff zero zero and let's try it again what up bro all right that's not too bad let's also insert some text so this is some default text so we can do that with entry dot insert we'll place a positional argument we'll start with zero and then we can enter in some default text like spongebob so then when we run this the default text says whatever we type here so now it says spongebob but i think i'll remove that for now you can also disable this text box as well so we can do that with entry dot config state equals disabled so we can no longer type in anything within this entry text box so i'll add a comment that this is either active or disabled but i'll turn this into a comment because we still got a lot more to do with this we can also set a width so this width is in number of characters so that is entry dot config width and let's set the max to maybe 10. so this doesn't cap or max out the number of characters that you can type in it's just really for the size of the entry box so it's only going to display a max of 10 characters at once but let's test it out so one two three four five six seven eight nine zero all right so if we type in more numbers than that more than ten it's going to kind of scroll through the numbers but yeah i'll keep it at time that's fine oh i got a good one for you guys so this next one is entry dot config show show equals a certain character so let's set this to asterisk so this will hide all of the characters within the text box and it's going to replace them with whatever character you have here so this would work perfect for some sort of password so if i were to type in something it's only going to display whatever character that we have here so this works perfect for a password so we can actually change this to it doesn't necessarily have to be an asterisk let's replace this with the dollar sign so when we type in something it's only going to display as whatever character we placed here so that's how you can create a hidden password of some sort now what good is an entry text box if we can't actually submit something so let's create a submit button so make sure you've seen the video on buttons for python before you dive into this portion so let's create a button we'll call this submit it's going to be a submit button so submit equals button we're adding this to our window and let's set the text text equals submit and then we're going to set the command for this to equal submit so we're going to create a function called submit uh so we'll do that right before we create this window i think so d e f submit what do we want this button to do when we click it so we'll create a variable maybe username equals and then to retrieve the text from a entry widget we type in the name of the widget entry dot get so this retrieves the text that we entered in and stores it within a variable called user and then let's just print this print user name all right and then we need to add the button to the window so we can just simply do that with pack submit dot pack and let's take a look alright so this button is on the top we can actually change uh the position in which it's in so within the parenthesis of pack what we can do is place this on a particular side so let's say that we want this on the right side so side equals right and that's a little bit better let's type in a name like bro hit submit and it displays our name in the console window here's a crazy idea when we print our username let's concatenate this with another string so maybe we can display hello before the username so hello plus username so type in whatever your name is bro submit and it says hello bro pretty cool right now let's create a delete button so honestly we'll just copy all this that we have for our submit button and we'll change submit to delete and we'll change the text here as well to delete and the command to delete so we'll make a delete function so delete delete delete delete then let's create a delete function so def delete all right so to delete the text in an entry widget we can do entry dot delete we place two positional arguments within here so we want to clear everything with this delete button so the first positional argument is going to be zero the second is going to be end and what this does and i'll just make this a comment is that this deletes the line of text and we'll set this to the right side right next to the submit button and let's test this my name is bro something and we're going to delete this and everything is cleared out and even if we hit submit it doesn't really do anything it just displays hello let's create a backspace button so we'll copy this we'll change delete to backspace we're only going to delete one character at a time and that character is going to be at the very end of our string of text so backspace backspace text equals backspace and command backspace and we'll create a backspace function so we'll do that at the top d e f backspace all right so this is going to get a little bit tricky entry dot delete and we're going to place two positional arguments the second is going to be end because we want to delete the last character in our line of text and the first character the first positional argument is going to be entry dot get basically what we have here except we're going to take the length of this place this all within parentheses and then subtract one and this will delete last character and now let's test this so we have backspace delete and submit let's type in our name so for me that's bro code then when i hit backspace it only deletes the last character however the delete button will still clear everything and then for the last time let's check submit so bro code then submit hello bro code cool so all of our buttons are now working well ladies and gentlemen that is the basics of the entry widget for python if you would like a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of the entry widget for python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down
