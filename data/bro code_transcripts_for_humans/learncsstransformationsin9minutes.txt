00:00 - hey what's going on everybody today
00:01 - we're going to cover the transform
00:03 - property in CSS the transform property
00:06 - lets you rotate scale skew or otherwise
00:09 - translate an element here's what we're
00:12 - gonna do we'll create a div section
00:15 - I will give this div an ID of box one
00:19 - then within the Box let's say the word
00:22 - hi
00:23 - let's head to our style sheet within my
00:26 - style sheet I will take our ID of box
00:29 - one
00:30 - set the width and height to be 250
00:33 - pixels
00:38 - then I will give this div section a
00:42 - border of 5 pixel solid
00:45 - let's increase the font size
00:48 - 13 em is fine
00:51 - then text align Center
00:56 - hey let's change the background color to
00:58 - while we're at it
01:00 - I'll pick a greenish color
01:05 - and that's pretty good I'm also going to
01:08 - remove some of the margin around the
01:10 - body of our document
01:12 - body margin zero
01:16 - all right so the transform property
01:19 - the First Transformation I'll show you
01:21 - is translate we can translate X on the
01:25 - x-axis Translate Y on the y-axis or both
01:29 - with just translate let's begin with
01:31 - translate X so after translate X add a
01:35 - set of parentheses whatever value you
01:37 - place within the set of parentheses we
01:39 - will translate this element on the
01:41 - x-axis if I were to set translate X to
01:44 - be 50 pixels this element will move to
01:47 - the right by 50 pixels
01:49 - that's 100
01:51 - 200
01:54 - negative numbers will move the element
01:55 - to the left
01:58 - percentages are fine too if I set
02:01 - translate X to be one hundred percent
02:03 - this element will translate to the right
02:06 - by 100 percent the width of this element
02:09 - with a negative percentage that will
02:11 - translate the element to the left
02:13 - it could effectively hide that element
02:15 - then with negative fifty percent we
02:18 - should see just half of this element A
02:20 - lot of these Transformations can be done
02:22 - in pixels
02:24 - or percentages
02:26 - there's also Translate Y for the y-axis
02:29 - if I were to translate by 50 pixels on
02:33 - the y-axis that moves the element down
02:36 - negative 50 would move the element up
02:39 - by one hundred percent we will move this
02:42 - element down by one hundred percent the
02:44 - height of the element that negative 100
02:47 - will effectively hide the element you
02:50 - can combine both of them too with just
02:51 - translate but you need two values the
02:55 - translation on the x-axis then the
02:57 - y-axis
02:58 - if I set the first number to be 50
03:01 - well 50 pixels
03:03 - that's an X translation the second value
03:06 - is a y translation now we're moving the
03:10 - element to the right and down negative
03:13 - values will move the element to the left
03:15 - and then up
03:17 - those are translations for the transform
03:19 - property
03:20 - then we have rotations we can rotate on
03:23 - the x-axis
03:25 - within rotate X we set a number of
03:28 - degrees if I were to set rotate X to be
03:31 - 45 degrees we'd begin rotating on the
03:34 - x-axis that's 45
03:37 - this is 90. you can't even see it
03:41 - 135
03:45 - with 180 it should be kind of upside
03:47 - down
03:48 - that is an X rotation then we have y
03:52 - rotate y we'll start with 45 degrees
03:56 - that's 45.
04:00 - 90 you can't even see it anymore
04:03 - 135
04:06 - 180.
04:08 - and lastly we have Z rotation
04:12 - that's 45
04:14 - this is 90.
04:17 - 135
04:20 - 180. those are different rotations
04:24 - their scale
04:26 - we can scale X or scale y
04:29 - 1 corresponds to 100 percent
04:32 - 1.1 is 110 percent
04:36 - if I were to set scale X to be 2 we're
04:39 - scaling this element on the x-axis by
04:42 - 200 percent
04:43 - 3 would be 300 percent
04:46 - any value below one
04:48 - would in a way compress it on the x-axis
04:52 - and here is 0.25
04:55 - we also have scale y
04:58 - scale Y is set to 2. would scale this
05:01 - element on the y-axis by 200 percent
05:05 - that's 300.
05:07 - here 0.5
05:09 - and here's 0.25
05:12 - you can combine both X and Y2 with just
05:15 - scale but you need two values
05:18 - so by default it's 1 1 for 100 let's
05:22 - scale on the x-axis and the y-axis by
05:25 - 200 percent
05:27 - and here's 300.
05:29 - that is scale
05:31 - then we have skew skew X or skew y
05:35 - if I were to set skew X to be 45 degrees
05:39 - we are skewing this element on the
05:41 - x-axis
05:43 - here's 90.
05:45 - 135
05:48 - and 180. the same applies for y
05:53 - Year's 45
05:56 - 90
05:58 - 135
06:00 - 180 you could combine them both with
06:03 - just SKU
06:04 - then again you need two values following
06:06 - that same pattern
06:08 - you can apply more than one
06:09 - transformation at a time let's begin
06:12 - with translate X
06:14 - by 100 percent
06:17 - and then we will rotate on the z-axis by
06:21 - 90 degrees
06:24 - let's add a scale as well
06:27 - I'll shrink this image by 50 percent
06:32 - so yes you can apply more than one
06:33 - transformation at a time
06:35 - these Transformations can also be
06:37 - applied to a class
06:39 - let's create two additional boxes
06:42 - box one box two box three
06:45 - I'll give each of these elements a class
06:49 - of box
06:54 - I'll remove this transformation
06:57 - I will select the Box class
07:00 - take all of these properties cut them
07:03 - besides the background color then paste
07:05 - them within the Box class
07:07 - then let's color in our two other boxes
07:10 - box one box two box three I'll make box
07:13 - two red
07:17 - box 3 will be blue
07:21 - all right let's apply some
07:22 - transformations to the class now I will
07:25 - set the transform property let's
07:27 - translate on the x-axis translate X
07:31 - by 100 pixels
07:35 - then let's rotate on the z-axis by 45
07:39 - degrees
07:41 - then I will shrink these with scale
07:45 - set to 0.5
07:48 - you also could apply these
07:49 - transformations to images I just so
07:52 - happen to have a picture of Shrek in my
07:54 - computer I think everybody should have
07:55 - at least one right that image just saved
07:57 - within my website folder
08:00 - let's delete these boxes that include
08:02 - that image
08:04 - image source equals the relative file
08:07 - path of the image
08:12 - all right
08:15 - let's take our image I will apply the
08:18 - transform property
08:20 - let's Translate
08:23 - our image on the x-axis by 100 percent
08:28 - then let's rotate Shrek on the z-axis
08:32 - by 180 degrees
08:34 - let's scale Shrek in the x-axis by 200
08:37 - percent
08:39 - scale X
08:41 - two
08:43 - all right I don't know what the point of
08:44 - that was but I thought it would be a fun
08:46 - exercise all right everybody so those
08:48 - are transformations it's a CSS property
08:50 - that lets you rotate scale skew or
08:53 - otherwise translate an element and those
08:55 - are a few basic CSS transformations

Cleaned transcript:

hey what's going on everybody today we're going to cover the transform property in CSS the transform property lets you rotate scale skew or otherwise translate an element here's what we're gonna do we'll create a div section I will give this div an ID of box one then within the Box let's say the word hi let's head to our style sheet within my style sheet I will take our ID of box one set the width and height to be 250 pixels then I will give this div section a border of 5 pixel solid let's increase the font size 13 em is fine then text align Center hey let's change the background color to while we're at it I'll pick a greenish color and that's pretty good I'm also going to remove some of the margin around the body of our document body margin zero all right so the transform property the First Transformation I'll show you is translate we can translate X on the xaxis Translate Y on the yaxis or both with just translate let's begin with translate X so after translate X add a set of parentheses whatever value you place within the set of parentheses we will translate this element on the xaxis if I were to set translate X to be 50 pixels this element will move to the right by 50 pixels that's 100 200 negative numbers will move the element to the left percentages are fine too if I set translate X to be one hundred percent this element will translate to the right by 100 percent the width of this element with a negative percentage that will translate the element to the left it could effectively hide that element then with negative fifty percent we should see just half of this element A lot of these Transformations can be done in pixels or percentages there's also Translate Y for the yaxis if I were to translate by 50 pixels on the yaxis that moves the element down negative 50 would move the element up by one hundred percent we will move this element down by one hundred percent the height of the element that negative 100 will effectively hide the element you can combine both of them too with just translate but you need two values the translation on the xaxis then the yaxis if I set the first number to be 50 well 50 pixels that's an X translation the second value is a y translation now we're moving the element to the right and down negative values will move the element to the left and then up those are translations for the transform property then we have rotations we can rotate on the xaxis within rotate X we set a number of degrees if I were to set rotate X to be 45 degrees we'd begin rotating on the xaxis that's 45 this is 90. you can't even see it 135 with 180 it should be kind of upside down that is an X rotation then we have y rotate y we'll start with 45 degrees that's 45. 90 you can't even see it anymore 135 180. and lastly we have Z rotation that's 45 this is 90. 135 180. those are different rotations their scale we can scale X or scale y 1 corresponds to 100 percent 1.1 is 110 percent if I were to set scale X to be 2 we're scaling this element on the xaxis by 200 percent 3 would be 300 percent any value below one would in a way compress it on the xaxis and here is 0.25 we also have scale y scale Y is set to 2. would scale this element on the yaxis by 200 percent that's 300. here 0.5 and here's 0.25 you can combine both X and Y2 with just scale but you need two values so by default it's 1 1 for 100 let's scale on the xaxis and the yaxis by 200 percent and here's 300. that is scale then we have skew skew X or skew y if I were to set skew X to be 45 degrees we are skewing this element on the xaxis here's 90. 135 and 180. the same applies for y Year's 45 90 135 180 you could combine them both with just SKU then again you need two values following that same pattern you can apply more than one transformation at a time let's begin with translate X by 100 percent and then we will rotate on the zaxis by 90 degrees let's add a scale as well I'll shrink this image by 50 percent so yes you can apply more than one transformation at a time these Transformations can also be applied to a class let's create two additional boxes box one box two box three I'll give each of these elements a class of box I'll remove this transformation I will select the Box class take all of these properties cut them besides the background color then paste them within the Box class then let's color in our two other boxes box one box two box three I'll make box two red box 3 will be blue all right let's apply some transformations to the class now I will set the transform property let's translate on the xaxis translate X by 100 pixels then let's rotate on the zaxis by 45 degrees then I will shrink these with scale set to 0.5 you also could apply these transformations to images I just so happen to have a picture of Shrek in my computer I think everybody should have at least one right that image just saved within my website folder let's delete these boxes that include that image image source equals the relative file path of the image all right let's take our image I will apply the transform property let's Translate our image on the xaxis by 100 percent then let's rotate Shrek on the zaxis by 180 degrees let's scale Shrek in the xaxis by 200 percent scale X two all right I don't know what the point of that was but I thought it would be a fun exercise all right everybody so those are transformations it's a CSS property that lets you rotate scale skew or otherwise translate an element and those are a few basic CSS transformations
