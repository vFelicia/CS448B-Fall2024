00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's you
00:01 - bro here hope you're doing well and in
00:03 - this video i'm going to be teaching you
00:04 - guys about
00:05 - check buttons in python so sit back
00:07 - relax and enjoy the show
00:11 - if you find this video helpful please
00:13 - remember to like
00:14 - comment and subscribe your support will
00:16 - help keep this channel running
00:19 - okay everybody so let's create a check
00:21 - button but first we'll need a window
00:23 - window equals tk and then we're going to
00:27 - follow this
00:28 - with window dot main
00:31 - loop now we'll need to create a check
00:34 - button to add to the window
00:36 - so i think i'm going to rename this as
00:38 - check box because i think that sounds
00:41 - better
00:42 - it's also shorter too so check box
00:44 - equals
00:45 - check button we're going to be adding
00:48 - this check button to our window
00:52 - we can set some text with text equals
00:55 - maybe i'll place python here
00:59 - we can also associate a variable with
01:01 - our check button
01:03 - variable equals and then we'll need to
01:05 - create a variable
01:07 - so i'm going to do this after we create
01:09 - our instance of our window
01:11 - let's create a variable just called x x
01:14 - equals int var
01:18 - so this is going to store an integer
01:20 - within x
01:22 - we're going to set the variable of check
01:24 - button
01:25 - to equal x or whatever else you named
01:27 - this basically
01:29 - so with this x variable we can assign
01:32 - x a value depending if the check button
01:35 - is
01:35 - checked or unchecked and we do this with
01:38 - on value
01:39 - and off value on value
01:42 - equals let's say one if we check our
01:45 - check button
01:46 - x is going to equal the on value which
01:49 - we'll just set to one
01:51 - and then off value is what x will equal
01:54 - if it's unchecked and we'll set this to
01:57 - zero
01:58 - then we can also associate a command
02:01 - with check button
02:02 - so command equals and let's create a
02:05 - function called
02:06 - display and we'll do that at the top
02:10 - def display
02:14 - we'll just print a message print
02:18 - i like python
02:23 - and then we'll need to add this checkbox
02:25 - so we can do that easily
02:27 - with pack checkbox.pack
02:32 - and let's give it a go here's our
02:35 - checkbox it says python
02:37 - and when you click on it it says i like
02:39 - python
02:40 - however if you uncheck this it still
02:42 - says i like python
02:44 - so why don't we upgrade our display
02:46 - function we'll check to see if the value
02:49 - stored within x
02:50 - is equal to one then we'll print i like
02:53 - python
02:54 - otherwise we'll display i don't like
02:57 - python
02:58 - so we'll check to see if the value in x
03:00 - is equal to one
03:02 - and it's not enough to say if x is equal
03:05 - to one
03:05 - since we're storing our value as an
03:08 - object by using
03:09 - int var we need to retrieve whatever
03:12 - value is within here
03:14 - so we can use x dot the get function
03:18 - if x dot get is equal to one we'll print
03:22 - i like python else
03:25 - will print a different message
03:28 - print i don't
03:32 - like python and i don't know why you
03:34 - wouldn't like python
03:36 - all right so let's give this a go then
03:40 - so i like python i don't like python
03:44 - i like python i don't like python all
03:47 - right
03:47 - now let's take a look at our checkbox
03:49 - it's somewhat dull
03:51 - so let's spice things up a little bit
03:53 - let's decorate this checkbox
03:55 - so let's begin by changing the font so
03:58 - we can do this
03:58 - with the config function font
04:02 - equals i will pick a font
04:05 - maybe ariel and a size maybe 20.
04:11 - that's a little bit better so this
04:13 - changes the font
04:16 - let's also change the font color so
04:19 - we can do that with another config
04:21 - function
04:22 - otherwise you can place this all within
04:24 - the same line but it's going to get kind
04:26 - of cramped in all one line
04:28 - so let's set the foreground color we can
04:31 - set this to a name
04:32 - like blue otherwise you can use a
04:34 - hexadecimal value so blue is
04:37 - 0 0 0 0 f f
04:42 - and now the fonts blue so this is the
04:44 - foreground
04:46 - color let's also change the background
04:48 - color
04:50 - that is bg for background color
04:55 - and i want this to be black so that's
04:58 - all zeros
05:02 - okay now pay attention to this if we
05:05 - check
05:05 - the checkbox this will flash to the
05:09 - original color
05:10 - or if i hold this down so we need to
05:13 - change the
05:13 - active foreground and active background
05:16 - if we want this to be consistent where
05:18 - it's not
05:19 - flashing every time you check this so
05:22 - we're going to change
05:23 - the active foreground
05:28 - and we're going to set this to the same
05:30 - color as our foreground
05:32 - so these are both the same values so
05:36 - this is
05:36 - active foreground we're also going to
05:39 - change the active
05:40 - background
05:45 - and we're also going to want this to be
05:46 - black as well
05:49 - active background so this should no
05:52 - longer flash colors when we check this
05:56 - it's all consistent and now what we're
05:59 - going to be doing at this point
06:00 - is adding an image next to our check
06:02 - button
06:04 - so i'm going to be adding this python
06:06 - logo that i downloaded
06:08 - and we're also going to be creating a
06:10 - second check button and i'm going to add
06:12 - a
06:13 - java logo to the second check button so
06:15 - if you need some time feel free to pause
06:17 - the video and download some images that
06:19 - you might want to use if you want to
06:20 - follow along
06:21 - otherwise let's get started so we're
06:24 - going to create
06:25 - a photo image i'll just name this photo
06:28 - photo
06:28 - equals photo image file
06:32 - equals either the file path or the file
06:34 - name
06:35 - since this is in the same folder as my
06:38 - python file
06:39 - i can just list the file name so i'm
06:41 - going to use
06:42 - my file called pythonunderscorelogo.png
06:46 - so i'm going to type that within file
06:51 - and then we're going to set the image of
06:53 - our check button to equal
06:55 - this photo so image equals
06:59 - whatever this name is photo
07:02 - sets image to
07:06 - photo image and let's try this
07:11 - so this image replaced our text
07:14 - if we want to keep the text we can use
07:18 - compound
07:22 - and we can set the image to the left
07:26 - right up down whatever i'll have this
07:30 - image be on the
07:31 - left
07:35 - and this should display the text yep it
07:37 - does
07:38 - now let's add some padding around our
07:41 - text
07:43 - so we can use pad x and pad y
07:50 - so pad x i'll set this to 25
07:54 - this should add some padding on the x
07:56 - axis so that gives us a little bit of
07:58 - space
07:59 - and pad y maybe 10.
08:05 - that's not too bad for spacing let's
08:07 - also set the width
08:08 - and the height width equals
08:12 - maybe 250 and height
08:17 - 50.
08:20 - okay that's not too shabby now let's
08:22 - create a second checkbox
08:24 - now why don't we create a second
08:26 - variable we'll call this y
08:28 - and this is also into var and let's
08:31 - copy everything that we have for our
08:33 - first checkbox
08:35 - paste this underneath and we're going to
08:37 - replace the name of checkbox with a
08:39 - different name
08:40 - so a shortcut is to select all of this
08:42 - go to edit
08:43 - find replace we're going to replace
08:48 - checkbox with checkbox
08:51 - 2 and then click replace all
08:54 - and then we can close out of this we're
08:56 - also going to make a few other changes
08:58 - so text equals let's say java
09:01 - variable equals y or whatever else you
09:05 - named your second variable
09:08 - let's see we're going to use a different
09:11 - image
09:12 - so we're going to use java underscore
09:14 - logo
09:16 - or whatever else you named your second
09:19 - image
09:20 - and let's name this photo two so make
09:23 - sure to change that as well
09:25 - and image equals photo two
09:29 - now this should work okay so
09:32 - we have two check buttons now and we
09:36 - can check these independently however we
09:38 - can actually
09:39 - align these on the x-axis because
09:41 - they're centered right now
09:43 - and it usually looks neat if you have
09:45 - these check boxes
09:47 - aligned on the same axis so we can do
09:49 - that by using
09:50 - anchor so we'll do checkbox.config again
09:57 - anchor and we can set this to a cardinal
10:01 - direction
10:02 - like w for west e for east and for north
10:06 - as for south
10:07 - uh there's a few other ones too but
10:09 - let's anchor these on the
10:11 - west side of our window
10:15 - so checkbox.config anchor equals w
10:18 - and the same thing for checkbox2 so
10:22 - these are now
10:22 - anchored on the west side of our window
10:26 - so they're kind of aligned now that
10:28 - makes it look a little more neat and
10:30 - professional
10:32 - i'm just going to add a quick comment
10:34 - that this anchors
10:36 - widget to relative
10:39 - cardinal direction
10:43 - now let's change our display function
10:45 - now that we have
10:47 - two check boxes and we don't want this
10:49 - to say
10:50 - i like python i don't like python when
10:52 - we select java
10:54 - and now with our if statement we're
10:56 - going to add something
10:58 - if x dot get is equal to one
11:01 - and y dot get is equal to zero
11:05 - will still display i like python let's
11:08 - copy this
11:10 - and add an else if statement else if
11:14 - x dot get is equal to zero
11:17 - and y dot get is equal to one
11:20 - i like java let's add another elsif
11:27 - else if x is equal to one
11:30 - and y is equal to one i like
11:33 - both python
11:37 - and java else will display
11:41 - perhaps i don't like
11:44 - either okay let's try this
11:49 - i like python i don't like either
11:53 - i like java i don't like either
11:56 - i like python i like both python and
11:59 - java all right everybody so that's the
12:03 - basics of check buttons if you would
12:05 - like a copy of all this code
12:06 - i'll post all of this in the comments
12:08 - down below but yeah that's the basics
12:10 - of check buttons in python
12:14 - hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you
12:16 - learn something new
12:17 - then you can help me help you in three
12:20 - easy steps
12:21 - by smashing that like button drop a

hey what's going on everybody it's you bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to be teaching you guys about check buttons in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running okay everybody so let's create a check button but first we'll need a window window equals tk and then we're going to follow this with window dot main loop now we'll need to create a check button to add to the window so i think i'm going to rename this as check box because i

going to be doing at this point is adding an image next to our check button so i'm going to be adding this python logo that i downloaded and we're also going to be creating a second check button and i'm going to add a java logo to the second check button so if you need some time feel free to pause the video and download some images that you might want to use if you want to follow along otherwise let's get started so we're going to create a photo image i'll just name this photo photo equals photo image file equals either the file path or the file name since this is in the same folder as my python file i can just list the file name so i'm going to use my file called pythonunderscorelogo.png so i'm going to type that within file and then we're going to set the image of our check button to equal this photo so image equals whatever this name is photo sets image to photo image and let's try this so this image replaced our text if we want to keep the text we can use compound and we can set the image to the left right up down whatever i'll have this image be on the left and this should display the text yep it does now let's add some padding around our text so we can use pad x and pad y

don't want this to say i like python i don't like python when we select java and now with our if statement we're going to add something if x dot get is equal to one and y dot get is equal to zero will

and y is equal to one i like both python and java else will display perhaps i don't like either okay let's try this i like python i don't like either i like java i don't like either i like python i like both python and java all right everybody so that's the basics of check buttons if you would like a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the
