00:00 - yo yo yo yo yo what's going on people so
00:02 - today I got to explain the onchange
00:04 - event handler in react onchange is an
00:07 - event handler used primarily with form
00:10 - elements including but not limited to
00:13 - input text area select and radio buttons
00:17 - onchange triggers a function every time
00:19 - the value of the input changes so let me
00:22 - give you an example we will be using the
00:25 - UST State hook so we need to import it
00:27 - import react I would like the use State
00:32 - Hook from
00:34 - react using the use State hook we're
00:37 - going to create a name variable a
00:38 - stateful variable const name and we need
00:43 - a Setter function for this variable set
00:46 - name equals the use State hook you can
00:51 - set an initial value I'll set mine to be
00:53 - an empty string I will be returning a
00:56 - div element to enclose all of our markup
01:01 - within my div element I will create an
01:03 - input
01:06 - element and here's my input element I
01:10 - will set the value of the input element
01:13 - to be some JavaScript my stateful name
01:17 - variable then I will set the on change
01:20 - event
01:21 - handler to be a reference to a
01:24 - JavaScript function which we still need
01:26 - to create this will be a call back let's
01:30 - create a function to handle a name
01:32 - change it's going to be similar to
01:34 - handle
01:35 - click function handle name change we
01:41 - have one parameter an event that's going
01:44 - to be provided to us when we change the
01:47 - value of this input element I will
01:49 - invoke our set name
01:52 - function we will set our name variable
01:55 - to be access our event
01:58 - object access ACC its Target then get
02:02 - the value property onchange is going to
02:04 - be set equal to a call back to this
02:07 - function when we type something or
02:09 - somehow change the value within here
02:11 - call this function and then afterwards I
02:15 - will include a paragraph element that
02:18 - has the text of name and include some
02:21 - JavaScript I will include my name
02:24 - variable so what should happen is when I
02:27 - type in a name it will update in real
02:29 - time
02:34 - time with use State I can set the
02:36 - initial value to be something to I'll
02:38 - set my initial value to be
02:43 - guessed the onchange event hander
02:46 - triggers a function every time the value
02:49 - of the input
02:50 - changes right now we have an initial
02:52 - value if I start deleting this my name
02:54 - is going to
02:55 - update this time we'll create an input
02:58 - element for a number inste out of text I
03:01 - will create a stateful variable for a
03:03 - quantity as if we're ordering something
03:07 - quantity and we need a Setter function
03:10 - set
03:12 - quantity equals the use State
03:16 - hook would we like an initial value not
03:20 - yet but we'll get to that later I will
03:22 - create a function to handle quantity
03:28 - change is the same formula as before we
03:31 - will be provided with an event so let's
03:34 - write a parameter for that we will use
03:36 - the setter function for the
03:38 - quantity set
03:42 - quantity we'll pass in Access our event
03:46 - access its Target then access its
03:50 - value then we need some HTML elements
03:53 - let me scroll down I will create an
03:56 - input
03:58 - element
04:00 - I will set the value of this element to
04:03 - be our
04:06 - quantity then I will set the onchange
04:09 - event handler to be a callback to a
04:11 - JavaScript function handle quantity
04:15 - change I will set the type of this
04:17 - element to be a
04:19 - number type
04:21 - equals
04:24 - number afterwards I will add a paragraph
04:28 - with our quantity
04:30 - and display our quantity
04:34 - variable so now we have arrows to select
04:38 - a number I will update the quantity to
04:41 - be 1 2 3 4
04:44 - 5 I'll set an initial value of one let's
04:49 - pretend that we're ordering something
04:51 - we're going to assume that the user
04:52 - wants to buy at least one of something
04:54 - that's how you can use onchange to
04:56 - reflect a number that's changing within
04:58 - an input element
05:00 - all right now we're going to create a
05:01 - text area a user is going to be buying
05:04 - something we'll have a user leave a
05:07 - comment I will create const
05:11 - comment set comment equals use
05:18 - State I'll set the initial state of my
05:20 - comment to be an empty
05:22 - string then I'll create a function to
05:25 - handle comment
05:27 - change function
05:30 - handle comment
05:33 - change we have one parameter an event we
05:37 - will use our Setter for our comment then
05:40 - pass in Access our event access its
05:43 - Target then access its
05:46 - value then we need our HTML
05:49 - elements we will create a text area
05:54 - element I will set the value to be our
05:59 - comment
06:00 - variable then set the onchange event
06:03 - handler to be a callback to handle
06:07 - comment
06:08 - change I'm also going to add a
06:10 - placeholder for some placeholder
06:13 - text
06:15 - placeholder
06:16 - equals in my specific example this text
06:20 - area will be for specific delivery
06:23 - instructions if somebody's shopping on
06:25 - your site and they order something they
06:27 - might want to provide additional
06:28 - delivery instructions leave package on
06:31 - the back porch ring the doorbell after
06:33 - the delivery is complete stuff like that
06:36 - so for my placeholder I'll type in enter
06:41 - delivery
06:43 - instructions and there's my placeholder
06:46 - text then just to see if this updates
06:49 - I'll add a paragraph
06:50 - element with my
06:53 - comment then insert my comment
06:56 - variable all right let's see if this
06:58 - works
07:01 - leave package on front porch and avoid
07:08 - the killer
07:11 - Chihuahua that's how we can use onchange
07:14 - with a text area all right the next
07:16 - one's going to be a little more
07:18 - complicated we're going to use a select
07:20 - element for a drop down menu we'll
07:22 - create a drop down menu for a payment is
07:24 - somebody going to pay with a Visa a
07:26 - MasterCard a gift card const
07:31 - payment set payment this will be a
07:35 - payment type we'll use use
07:39 - State I will set the initial value to be
07:41 - an empty
07:42 - string then we need a Handler
07:46 - function function
07:50 - handle payment
07:53 - change we have one parameter and
07:56 - event then we'll use that Setter
07:58 - function for the payment
08:00 - P set
08:02 - payment event access its Target then the
08:09 - value our select element has a pair of
08:13 - tags we'll Place option elements within
08:16 - our select element the opening select
08:19 - element is going to have a value equal
08:22 - to our payment
08:25 - variable I will set the unchange event
08:28 - handler
08:29 - equal to a call back to the handle
08:32 - payment change function we have some
08:35 - options within our select
08:39 - element the text on my first option will
08:42 - be select an
08:46 - option so now my drop- down menu has
08:49 - select an option for this option's value
08:52 - I will set it to be an empty string this
08:55 - will be the
08:56 - default let's create another option
09:02 - the text on this option element will be
09:03 - a Visa if somebody's paying with a Visa
09:06 - card the value will be a string of
09:11 - Visa besides the defaults we do have an
09:14 - option for Visa then Master
09:20 - Card Master
09:22 - Card the value will be a string of
09:27 - MasterCard and and a gift
09:32 - card gift card the value will be gift
09:38 - card so besides our default we have Visa
09:41 - Mastercard and gift
09:43 - card after our select element I'll
09:46 - create a
09:47 - paragraph the text on the paragraph will
09:49 - be payment then I'll display our payment
09:53 - stateful
09:55 - variable when I select Visa our payment
09:58 - is going to update with VIs
09:59 - Visa Mastercard and gift
10:03 - card with use State I can even set an
10:06 - initial value I could set the initial
10:08 - value to be for example
10:11 - Visa
10:13 - Mastercard or a gift
10:16 - card but I'll keep it as an empty string
10:18 - so we get that default text of Select an
10:22 - option the last form element I'll cover
10:24 - is radio buttons and these are going to
10:26 - be the most complicated we'll create a
10:28 - pair of two radio buttons for a delivery
10:30 - method either pickup or a delivery does
10:34 - somebody want to come into a store to
10:35 - pick up our package or is a driver going
10:37 - to take it to their
10:39 - residence I will create
10:42 - const let's say
10:44 - shipping for the shipping method and a
10:47 - Setter function for set shipping equals
10:52 - use State for the time being I will set
10:56 - the initial state to be an empty string
10:59 - we'll create a Handler
11:01 - function function handle shipping
11:06 - change we have one parameter of
11:10 - event I will use that Setter function of
11:13 - set
11:15 - shipping access our event argument
11:19 - access its Target access its
11:22 - value within our HTML
11:25 - markup we're going to create a pair of
11:27 - radio buttons we'll create a label we
11:30 - need a pair of label
11:32 - elements the text on the first label
11:34 - will be pickup are we're going to pick
11:37 - up our package from a store we'll create
11:39 - a second label I'll just copy what we
11:41 - have paste it the second label will be
11:45 - for a
11:47 - delivery within my label I'll create an
11:50 - input
11:54 - element I will set the type to equal
11:58 - radio
12:00 - I will set the value of this radio
12:02 - button to
12:04 - be
12:09 - pickup I'll place these additional
12:11 - properties on a new line just for
12:14 - readability I will set the checked
12:16 - attribute equal to a JavaScript
12:19 - expression let's check to see if our
12:22 - shipping stateful variable is strictly
12:26 - equal to our value of
12:30 - pickup this will evaluate to be true or
12:33 - false if this expression is
12:36 - true then we'll trigger our onchange
12:40 - vent Handler and set it equal to a
12:42 - JavaScript function it's going to be a
12:45 - call back to handle shipping
12:49 - change let's copy this input element
12:52 - then within our second label paste
12:55 - it but we'll change our value to be
12:58 - pickup to to
13:01 - delivery within our checked property
13:03 - check to see if shipping is strictly
13:06 - equal to
13:07 - delivery if this expression is true then
13:10 - checked will be true this will trigger
13:12 - the onchange event
13:14 - handler just to reflect the change I'm
13:16 - going to add a paragraph
13:18 - element with text of
13:21 - shipping I will insert some
13:24 - JavaScript I will insert our shipping
13:26 - stateful variable
13:29 - I'm going to add a break after our first
13:31 - label just for readability I think that
13:33 - looks better if I were to select pickup
13:36 - the shipping method changes to pickup
13:38 - we're going to pick up our delivery from
13:40 - a nearby store if I change it to
13:43 - delivery the shipping method changes to
13:46 - delivery with the use State hook we can
13:49 - set an initial State let's assume that
13:51 - if somebody is ordering something from
13:53 - our site they will want it delivered I
13:57 - will set the initial state to be
13:59 - delivery and that did update but if
14:02 - somebody does want to pick it up they
14:04 - can easily just change that by selecting
14:06 - this radio button all right everybody so
14:08 - that is the onchange event handler it's
14:10 - used primarily with form elements
14:13 - including but not limited to input text
14:16 - area select and radio buttons onchange
14:20 - triggers a function every time the value
14:22 - of the input changes so for example if I
14:25 - were to type in my name into this input
14:27 - element that change is immediately going
14:29 - to be reflected in real time and well
14:32 - everybody that is the onchange vent
14:34 - Handler in
14:38 - react

Cleaned transcript:

yo yo yo yo yo what's going on people so today I got to explain the onchange event handler in react onchange is an event handler used primarily with form elements including but not limited to input text area select and radio buttons onchange triggers a function every time the value of the input changes so let me give you an example we will be using the UST State hook so we need to import it import react I would like the use State Hook from react using the use State hook we're going to create a name variable a stateful variable const name and we need a Setter function for this variable set name equals the use State hook you can set an initial value I'll set mine to be an empty string I will be returning a div element to enclose all of our markup within my div element I will create an input element and here's my input element I will set the value of the input element to be some JavaScript my stateful name variable then I will set the on change event handler to be a reference to a JavaScript function which we still need to create this will be a call back let's create a function to handle a name change it's going to be similar to handle click function handle name change we have one parameter an event that's going to be provided to us when we change the value of this input element I will invoke our set name function we will set our name variable to be access our event object access ACC its Target then get the value property onchange is going to be set equal to a call back to this function when we type something or somehow change the value within here call this function and then afterwards I will include a paragraph element that has the text of name and include some JavaScript I will include my name variable so what should happen is when I type in a name it will update in real time time with use State I can set the initial value to be something to I'll set my initial value to be guessed the onchange event hander triggers a function every time the value of the input changes right now we have an initial value if I start deleting this my name is going to update this time we'll create an input element for a number inste out of text I will create a stateful variable for a quantity as if we're ordering something quantity and we need a Setter function set quantity equals the use State hook would we like an initial value not yet but we'll get to that later I will create a function to handle quantity change is the same formula as before we will be provided with an event so let's write a parameter for that we will use the setter function for

of this element to be our quantity then I will set the onchange event handler to be a callback to a JavaScript function handle quantity change I will set the type of this element to be a number type equals number afterwards I will add a paragraph with our quantity and display our quantity variable so now we have arrows to select a number I will update the quantity to be 1 2 3 4 5 I'll set an initial value of one let's pretend that we're ordering something we're going to assume that the user wants to buy at least one of something that's how you can use onchange to reflect a number that's changing within an input element all right now we're going to create a text area a user is going to be buying something we'll have a user leave a comment I will create const comment set comment equals use State I'll set the initial state of my comment to be an empty string then I'll create a function to handle comment change function handle comment change we have one parameter an event we will use our Setter for our comment then pass in Access our event access its Target then access its value then we need our HTML elements we will create a text area element I will set the value to be our comment variable then set the onchange event handler to be a callback to handle comment change I'm also going to add a placeholder for some placeholder text placeholder equals in my specific example this text area will be for specific delivery instructions if somebody's shopping on your site and they order something they might want to provide additional delivery instructions leave package on the back porch ring the doorbell after the delivery is complete stuff like that so for my placeholder I'll type in enter delivery instructions and there's my placeholder text then just to see if this updates I'll add a paragraph element with my comment then insert my comment variable all right let's see if this works leave package on front porch and avoid the killer Chihuahua that's how we can use onchange with a text area all right the next one's going to be a little more complicated we're going to use a select element for a drop down menu we'll create a drop down menu for a payment is somebody going to pay with a Visa a MasterCard a gift card const payment set payment this will be a payment type we'll use use State I will set the initial value to be an empty string then we need a Handler function function handle payment change we have one parameter and event then we'll use that Setter function for the payment P set payment event access its Target then the value our select element has a pair of tags we'll Place option elements within our select element the opening select element is going to have a value equal to our payment variable I will set the unchange event handler equal to a call back to the handle payment change function we have some options within our select element the text on my first option will be select an option so now my drop down menu has select an option for this option's value I will set it to be an empty string this will be the default let's create another option the text on this option element will be a Visa if somebody's paying with a Visa card the value will be a string of Visa besides the defaults we do have an option for Visa then Master Card Master Card the value will be a string of MasterCard and and a gift card gift card the value will be gift card so besides our default we have Visa Mastercard and gift card after our select element I'll create a paragraph the text on the paragraph will be payment then I'll display our payment stateful variable when I select Visa our payment is going to update with VIs Visa Mastercard and gift card with use State I can even set an initial value I could set the initial value to be for example Visa Mastercard or a gift card but I'll keep it as an empty string so we get that default text of Select an option the last form element I'll cover is radio buttons and these are going to be the most complicated we'll create a pair of two radio buttons for a delivery method either pickup or a delivery does somebody want to come into a store to pick up our package or is a driver going to take it to their residence I will create const let's say shipping for the shipping method and a Setter function for set shipping equals use State for the time being I will set the initial state to be

going to pick up our package from a store we'll create a second label I'll just copy what we have paste it the second label will be for a delivery within my label I'll create an input element I will set the type to equal radio I will set the value of this radio button to be pickup I'll place these additional properties on a new line just for readability I will set the checked attribute equal to a JavaScript expression let's check to see if our shipping stateful variable is strictly equal to our value of pickup this will evaluate to be true or false if this expression is true then we'll trigger our onchange vent Handler and set it equal to a JavaScript function it's going to be a call back to handle shipping change let's copy this input element then within our second label paste it but we'll change our value to be pickup to to delivery within our checked property check to see if shipping is strictly equal to delivery if this expression is true then checked will be true this will trigger the onchange event handler just to reflect the change I'm going to add a paragraph element with text of shipping I will insert some JavaScript I will insert our shipping stateful variable I'm going to add a break after our first label just for readability I think that looks better if I were to select pickup the shipping method changes to pickup we're going to pick up our delivery from a nearby store if I change it to delivery the shipping method changes to delivery with the use State hook we can set an initial State let's assume that if somebody is ordering something from our site they will want it delivered I will set the initial state to be delivery and that did update but if somebody does want to pick it up they can easily just change that by selecting this radio button all right

value of the input changes so for example if I were to type in my name into this input element that change is immediately going to be reflected in real time and well everybody that is the onchange vent Handler in react
