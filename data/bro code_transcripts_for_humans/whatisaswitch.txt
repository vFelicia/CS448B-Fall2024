00:02 - all right everybody today we're going to
00:04 - discuss switches a switch is an
00:06 - alternative to using many else if
00:08 - statements it compares one value against
00:11 - many matching cases here's an example of
00:14 - what you don't want to do i have this
00:16 - program we have variable month month is
00:18 - of the integer data type the user will
00:20 - type in a number 1 through 12 to
00:22 - represent the month if month is equal to
00:25 - 1 it is january
00:27 - else if month is equal to two it is
00:30 - february else if month is three
00:32 - four five so on and so forth this is
00:35 - what you don't want to do because it's
00:37 - inefficient it's how the game yandere
00:39 - simulator was created if you know what
00:41 - that is a better solution would be to
00:43 - use a switch this is how to write one
00:45 - i'm going to delete all of this
00:48 - we will type switch parentheses curly
00:52 - braces what value would we like to
00:54 - examine against matching cases let's
00:57 - examine our month
00:58 - to write a case we would type case
01:01 - then the value
01:02 - let's check to see if month is equal to
01:05 - one
01:06 - so case one colon on the next line what
01:09 - we want to do if month is equal to one
01:12 - let's display a message
01:14 - standard output
01:17 - it is
01:19 - january
01:21 - at the end of this case add break to
01:23 - break out of the switch
01:25 - so that is case one let's work on case
01:27 - two
01:28 - so case two
01:30 - it is february
01:32 - i think the rest is self-explanatory
01:34 - i'll speed up the footage
02:00 - we have our 12 cases 1 through 12. each
02:03 - case corresponding with a month of the
02:05 - year
02:06 - let's run this enter the month
02:09 - let's say that the month is 4 for april
02:13 - it is april
02:14 - one more time
02:15 - the month is 12 it is december so a
02:18 - switch is an alternative to using many
02:20 - else if statements it's more efficient
02:22 - and easier to read if there are no
02:24 - matching cases we can execute a default
02:27 - case type
02:29 - default
02:31 - then what would we like to do
02:33 - standard
02:34 - output let's say
02:37 - please enter in only numbers
02:43 - 1 through 12.
02:50 - enter the month
02:52 - uh let's type negative 42.
02:56 - please enter in only numbers 1 through
02:58 - 12. so the default case is kind of like
03:00 - the else statement if there are no
03:02 - matching cases we execute whatever's
03:04 - within the default case let's try one
03:06 - more example this time we'll have a user
03:09 - enter in a character a letter grade will
03:11 - display a custom message depending on
03:13 - what grade they have
03:15 - char
03:17 - grid
03:19 - standard
03:21 - output
03:24 - what
03:25 - letter grade
03:30 - standard
03:32 - input
03:35 - grade
03:37 - then we'll create a switch
03:38 - switch parentheses curly braces
03:41 - we're examining our letter grade against
03:43 - matching cases the first case will be
03:47 - the character a
03:48 - what will we display if somebody
03:50 - receives an a
03:52 - standard output
03:55 - you did great
03:59 - then break
04:01 - case
04:02 - b
04:05 - standard
04:06 - output
04:09 - you
04:10 - did
04:11 - good
04:13 - then break
04:16 - case c
04:20 - standard
04:21 - output
04:25 - you did
04:27 - okay
04:29 - break
04:31 - case d
04:36 - standard output
04:39 - you did
04:40 - not do
04:42 - good
04:45 - break
04:47 - case f
04:51 - standard output
04:54 - you failed
04:58 - break then let's add a default case
05:07 - please
05:08 - only enter in a letter grade
05:13 - a through f
05:16 - let's try it
05:18 - what letter grade i received in a you
05:20 - did great
05:22 - what letter grid f you failed then let's
05:25 - test our default case what letter grid
05:28 - pizza
05:30 - please only enter in a letter grade a
05:32 - through f so yeah that's a switch
05:34 - everybody it's an alternative to using
05:37 - many else if statements it's more
05:39 - efficient and easier to read your
05:41 - assignment is to create a switch and
05:43 - post it in the comments section and well
05:45 - yeah those are switches in c plus

all right everybody today we're going to discuss switches a switch is an alternative to using many else if statements it compares one value against many matching cases here's an example of what you don't want to do i have this program we have variable month month is of the integer data type the user will type in a number 1 through 12 to represent the month if month is equal to 1 it is january else if month is equal to two it is february else if month is three four five so on and so forth this is what you don't want to do because it's inefficient it's how the game yandere simulator was created if you know what that is a better solution would be to use a switch this is how to write one i'm going to delete all of this we will type switch parentheses curly braces what value would we like to examine against matching cases let's examine our month to write a case we would type case then the value let's check to see if month is equal to one so case one colon on the next line what we want to do if month is equal to one let's display a message standard output it is january at the end of this case add break to break out of the switch so that is case one let's work on case two so case two it is february i think the rest is selfexplanatory i'll speed up the footage we have our 12 cases 1 through 12. each case corresponding with a month of the year let's run this enter the month let's say that the month is 4 for april it is april one more time the month is 12 it is december so a switch is an alternative to using many else if statements it's more efficient and easier to read if there are no matching cases we can execute a default case type default then what would we like to do standard output let's say please enter in only numbers 1 through 12. enter the month uh let's type negative 42. please enter in only numbers 1 through 12. so the default case is kind of like the else statement if there are no matching cases we execute whatever's within the default case let's try one more example this time we'll have a user enter in a character a letter grade will display a custom message depending on what grade they have char grid standard output what letter grade standard input grade then we'll create a switch switch parentheses curly braces we're examining our letter grade against matching cases the first case will be the character a what will we display if somebody receives an a standard output you did great then break case b standard output you did good then break case c standard output you did okay break case d standard output you did not do good break case f standard output you failed break then let's add a default case please only enter in a letter grade a through f let's try it what letter grade i received in a you did great what letter grid f you failed then let's test our default case what letter grid pizza please only enter in a letter grade a through f so yeah that's a switch everybody it's an alternative to using many else if statements it's more efficient and easier to read your assignment is to create a switch and post it in the comments section and well yeah those are switches in c plus
