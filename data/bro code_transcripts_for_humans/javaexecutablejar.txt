00:00 - how's it going to everybody it's you bro
00:01 - here hope you're doing well and in this
00:03 - video I'm going to teach you guys how we
00:04 - can turn our Java programs into an
00:07 - executable application so sit back relax
00:09 - and enjoy the show if you find this
00:14 - video helpful please remember to Like
00:16 - comment and subscribe
00:18 - your support will help keep this channel
00:20 - running alright everybody so I'm going
00:23 - to be splitting up this video into
00:24 - different sections because it seems like
00:26 - you guys for the most part are either
00:28 - using the Eclipse IDE or IntelliJ IDEA
00:32 - so I'm going to teach you guys how to
00:33 - create executable jar files using each
00:36 - of these so I'll be splitting up this
00:38 - video into sections and I'll include
00:39 - some timestamps in the description I
00:41 - also have all of these steps written out
00:44 - if you like a physical copy of these
00:46 - I'll copy and paste this and post this
00:48 - in the comments down below if you'd like
00:49 - to follow along step-by-step so let's
00:52 - begin by creating an executable jar file
00:54 - with the Eclipse IDE so here I am within
00:57 - the Eclipse IDE now within your package
01:00 - Explorer select a project they want to
01:02 - create an executable of so select one
01:05 - that has a GUI component so you can
01:06 - actually see it so let's say that I want
01:09 - to create an executable of the stopwatch
01:11 - program so what I'm going to do is
01:13 - right-click this project folder go to
01:15 - export go to the Java folder let's
01:18 - pretend that that wasn't open and then
01:20 - you can either make it jar file or a
01:22 - runnable jar file so I'm going to select
01:25 - runnable jar file and click Next and
01:27 - then for the launch configuration make
01:30 - sure that this is set to the main class
01:32 - of your project so one mistake that I
01:35 - made I actually have two stopwatch
01:38 - programs I have one that's spelt
01:39 - slightly differently so that was given
01:41 - me some problems so make sure you select
01:43 - the right project it also doesn't help
01:45 - that I have like a billion projects
01:47 - within here now for the export
01:49 - destination you can choose where you
01:51 - want this to be exported to so I'm just
01:53 - going to save this to my desktop so this
01:56 - is going to be named stopwatch and it's
01:58 - a jar file click Save and then we are
02:01 - going to click finish and then it's okay
02:03 - if we have some warnings so I'm just
02:05 - going to click OK let's go to my desktop
02:08 - and here is the executable jar file so
02:11 - let's take a look at it
02:13 - it's an executable jar file the file
02:16 - extension is dot jar and when you click
02:19 - on this it runs my stopwatch program so
02:22 - now let's do this with IntelliJ IDEA so
02:25 - here I am within IntelliJ IDEA so if
02:28 - you're using this IDE this is how to
02:30 - make an executable jar file so I have
02:33 - this very same stopwatch program from
02:35 - the demonstration using the Eclipse IDE
02:37 - so I want to create an executable of
02:40 - this project so what I'm going to do is
02:43 - go to file project structure and then
02:46 - I'm going to go to artifacts click this
02:49 - plus button jar and then from modules
02:53 - with dependencies so make sure this
02:56 - module is selected for your project then
02:58 - we need to find the class that contains
03:00 - the main method and this is usually main
03:03 - and then click OK
03:05 - extract to the target jar that's fine
03:07 - and then click OK now within this
03:10 - project structure window if you want you
03:12 - can change the output directory so I'm
03:14 - actually going to change this to my
03:16 - desktop for convenience so let's click
03:19 - on my desktop and click OK then apply
03:23 - and then ok and the last step go to the
03:27 - top of this window for your IDE go to
03:30 - build build artifacts and then build so
03:34 - this jar file is going to be sent to my
03:37 - desktop momentarily there it is and
03:40 - let's run this and here is my stopwatch
03:45 - program now one question that you might
03:48 - be wondering is how can we change the
03:50 - icon for this executable jar well we
03:53 - normally can't change the icons for a
03:55 - jar file
03:56 - it's more of an operating system sort of
03:59 - deal so one thing that we can do is use
04:01 - an executable wrapper with the help of
04:03 - some third-party software but the first
04:05 - thing that we're going to need is an ICO
04:08 - file so you can actually take any image
04:10 - well most images and we can actually use
04:13 - some third-party software to convert
04:15 - this to an ICO file so let's say that I
04:18 - want to use this stopwatch image that I
04:21 - made here well it's really just an emoji
04:23 - that I expanded but it's a PNG
04:27 - so I'm going to want to convert this to
04:29 - an ICO file so one website I recommend
04:32 - that's been pretty good to me is I co
04:35 - convert comm so let's head there or you
04:39 - can just do a Google search I don't care
04:40 - do whatever you want so I'm just going
04:42 - to click this first link and this is ICO
04:44 - convert comm all right so we're going to
04:47 - choose a file I'm going to select this
04:49 - stopwatch and here it is so I'm going to
04:54 - open this and upload so this website has
04:58 - a few limitations it has to be PNG jpg
05:01 - or BMP and then there's some other
05:04 - things you can do if you want to format
05:06 - this all we need to do is click convert
05:09 - ICO at the bottom and download your
05:11 - icons alright so I moved that file from
05:15 - my downloads folder to my desktop and I
05:17 - just got rid of the old PNG file so
05:19 - let's right-click on this just to be
05:21 - sure it's an ICO file for icon so that's
05:24 - everything that we need
05:25 - now there's another third-party software
05:28 - that's pretty helpful we're going to use
05:30 - launch for J to create an exe with this
05:33 - custom icon so this is the URL I'll also
05:37 - post this in the description so here's
05:39 - the website launch for J dot
05:42 - sourceforge.net and then if you need to
05:44 - download this there's a download tab on
05:47 - the left hand side and you can select
05:48 - the appropriate download for your
05:51 - operating system so once that's
05:52 - downloaded open it up so here's the
05:56 - launch for J program so there's a few
05:58 - things that we need to do first we need
06:00 - to select the output destination for
06:02 - this exe file so we can browse for a
06:05 - location here I'm just going to set this
06:07 - to my desktop and I am going to name
06:10 - this stopwatch dot exe the dot exe is
06:15 - important click Save and next we need to
06:18 - select the appropriate jar file so this
06:20 - is also on my desktop so I'm going to
06:22 - select this and it is stopwatch dot jar
06:25 - and open and then if you have an icon
06:29 - that you want to use remember this has
06:30 - to be an ICO file and that is this one
06:33 - and click open and lastly we need to set
06:37 - the bundled JRE path
06:40 - so we need to place the path of where
06:42 - our JDK is located so we can actually
06:45 - find that within our seed drive so my
06:47 - JDK is located within the C Drive
06:50 - Program Files the Java folder and then
06:54 - select the most recent JDK that you're
06:56 - using and then I'm just going to copy
06:58 - this address by right clicking copy
07:01 - address and then I'm going to paste this
07:03 - within bundled JRE path and lastly we
07:07 - just need to click on this gear icon and
07:09 - this is to build wrapper and then this
07:12 - is going to create a launch Forge a
07:15 - config file you can name this whatever
07:16 - you want we're just going to delete this
07:18 - right away afterwards and click Save all
07:21 - right here is our stopwatch executable
07:24 - program and it has the icon that we used
07:26 - so we actually no longer need these
07:28 - three things this is the jar file the
07:30 - ICO file and that test config file that
07:33 - we just made so I'm just going to get
07:35 - rid of these and here is the file that
07:37 - we wanted so this is an exe file it's an
07:42 - application and if we were to click on
07:44 - this it's going to run our designated
07:46 - Java program so hopefully this
07:48 - walkthrough works for you I'll post all
07:50 - of the steps that I have written here in
07:52 - the comments and in the description down
07:54 - below but yeah that's how you can turn
07:56 - your Java program into an executable
07:58 - application hey you yeah I'm talking to
08:03 - you
08:04 - if you learn something new then you can
08:06 - help me help you in three easy steps
08:09 - by smashing that like button drop a
