00:00 - all right everybody in this video we're
00:02 - going to create a very simple calculator
00:04 - program the reason that I'm making this
00:06 - program is just for us to get some
00:08 - practice using IF statements let's begin
00:10 - we will ask a user for an operator
00:13 - will this be addition subtraction
00:15 - multiplication or division operator
00:17 - equals input
00:20 - enter and operator
00:25 - addition subtraction multiplication or
00:28 - division
00:32 - then we will have a user type in two
00:34 - numbers
00:35 - num1 equals input
00:40 - enter the first number
00:45 - we will Typecast our input as a floating
00:47 - Point number
00:50 - then with num2 we can just copy this
00:52 - paste it
00:54 - change num1 to num2 enter the second
00:57 - number
01:00 - then we can use an if statement
01:02 - if our operator is equal to the plus
01:07 - symbol
01:10 - then we will add these two numbers
01:12 - together
01:13 - results equals num1 plus num2
01:19 - else if our operator
01:22 - is equal to
01:24 - subtraction
01:27 - we will take our result
01:29 - equals num1 minus num2
01:34 - else if the operator is multiplication
01:39 - we will multiply num1 times num2
01:44 - else if our operator is equal to
01:47 - division
01:50 - then divide num1 by num2
01:55 - else
01:56 - the user must not have typed in a valid
01:58 - operator
02:00 - let's display a message to them
02:03 - I'll use an upstring
02:06 - operator
02:08 - is not a valid
02:12 - operator
02:15 - so where should we display the result
02:17 - let's do so within each if statement
02:20 - print result
02:22 - but I'm going to round our result to
02:24 - maybe three decimal places
02:28 - we'll copy the print statement and paste
02:31 - it within each of these if and else if
02:33 - statements
02:34 - except the else statement
02:36 - because we don't want to perform any
02:38 - calculations if the operator is invalid
02:41 - okay let's try this
02:44 - enter an operator let's do plus
02:47 - what is 3 plus 3.14
02:51 - that is 6.14
02:55 - let's do subtraction
02:57 - 3 minus 3.14 is negative 0.14
03:03 - multiplication
03:05 - 3 times 3.14 is 9.42
03:12 - enter an operator division first number
03:15 - three
03:16 - divided by 3.14 that is 0.955 then let's
03:22 - pick an operator that's not valid uh
03:24 - like the word Pizza
03:26 - we still have to type in a number though
03:28 - unfortunately
03:29 - 3.14 Pizza is not a valid operator
03:33 - well okay then everybody that's just a
03:36 - simple calculator program more or less
03:37 - just for practice all we did is just
03:40 - perform an arithmetic operation on two
03:42 - numbers then display a result maybe
03:44 - later on in the series we'll make
03:46 - something more complex but yeah that is
03:48 - a simple calculator program in Python

all right everybody in this video we're going to create a very simple calculator program the reason that I'm making this program is just for us to get some practice using IF statements let's begin we will ask a user for an operator will this be addition subtraction multiplication or division operator equals input enter and operator addition subtraction multiplication or division then we will have a user type in two numbers num1 equals input enter the first number we will Typecast our input as a floating Point number then with num2 we can just copy this paste it change num1 to num2 enter the second number then we can use an if statement if our operator is equal to the plus symbol then we will add these two numbers together results equals num1 plus num2 else if our operator is equal to subtraction we will take our result equals num1 minus num2 else if the operator is multiplication we will multiply num1 times num2 else if our operator is equal to division then divide num1 by num2 else the user must not have typed in a valid operator let's display a message to them I'll use an upstring operator is not a valid operator so where should we display the result let's do so within each if statement print result but I'm going to round our result to maybe three decimal places we'll copy the print statement and paste it within each of these if and else if statements except the else statement because we don't want to perform any calculations if the operator is invalid okay let's try this enter an operator let's do plus what is 3 plus 3.14 that is 6.14 let's do subtraction 3 minus 3.14 is negative 0.14 multiplication 3 times 3.14 is 9.42 enter an operator division first number three divided by 3.14 that is 0.955 then let's pick an operator that's not valid uh like the word Pizza we still have to type in a number though unfortunately 3.14 Pizza is not a valid operator well okay then everybody that's just a simple calculator program more or less just for practice all we did is just perform an arithmetic operation on two numbers then display a result maybe later on in the series we'll make something more complex but yeah that is a simple calculator program in Python
