00:04 - thought we could do something a little
00:05 - bit different in this video i'm going to
00:07 - direct you to a useful resource in which
00:09 - you can use free icons for your websites
00:12 - the name of this website is font awesome
00:14 - this isn't a sponsorship or anything
00:16 - like that i just tend to like to use
00:18 - this website for free icons so there is
00:20 - a free version i'm going to start for
00:22 - free and you just need to set up an
00:24 - account so enter an email address
00:27 - and then create and use this kit
00:30 - then it's just a matter of verifying
00:32 - your email address to create an account
00:34 - after signing in you'll need to add your
00:37 - kids code to a project this is a small
00:40 - script so i'm going to copy this kit
00:42 - code
00:44 - and within the head of my html document
00:47 - i'm going to paste it
00:49 - and now we can search for some icons
00:51 - at the top menu of this website we'll go
00:53 - to icons
00:55 - and we can search a lot of these you do
00:57 - need a paid account but there's a lot of
00:58 - free icons as well so let's look up any
01:01 - free icons let's look for a home
01:05 - so click on an icon
01:07 - you can select a size and a background
01:10 - color and choose this icon click on
01:12 - start using this icon
01:14 - all you have to do is copy this html
01:17 - code
01:18 - and then someplace within the body of
01:19 - your document you can paste it
01:23 - and we now have that house icon so let's
01:25 - search for a few more
01:27 - how about twitter
01:29 - select a size and a background start
01:32 - using this icon
01:34 - copy the html code
01:36 - and then paste it
01:39 - okay one more how about youtube so again
01:42 - select an icon select a size select a
01:45 - background start using this icon copy
01:47 - this code
01:49 - and paste it okay let's style some of
01:51 - these elements let's change the color of
01:54 - our twitter icon
01:56 - so this portion here is the class name f
01:59 - a dash twitter so type dot for classes f
02:03 - a dash twitter and let's change the
02:05 - color property i think aqua is fairly
02:08 - close to the original logo color
02:11 - and let's do the same thing with youtube
02:14 - so
02:15 - dot fa
02:17 - youtube and i will change the color to
02:20 - red
02:22 - and you can add really any css
02:23 - properties we can also turn these into
02:25 - hyperlinks
02:27 - so i will surround one of these elements
02:29 - with a pair of a tags
02:32 - then i will set the href attribute equal
02:34 - to a url
02:38 - then when i click on this icon
02:41 - it takes me to youtube it wouldn't be a
02:43 - bad idea to place some of these within
02:45 - the header or the footer of your webpage
02:47 - so yeah those are font awesome icons and
02:50 - how to style them using css so if this
