00:00 - hello again friends today I'm going to
00:02 - explain how we can create a form using
00:04 - HTML to create a form we'll need a pair
00:07 - of form tags
00:10 - the opening form tag has a few
00:11 - attributes we need to fill in
00:13 - first is an action attribute after
00:16 - submitting our form to what location do
00:18 - we want to send our form to form
00:20 - submission is done with the back end
00:22 - language such as PHP you might see a
00:25 - file name such as index.php or action
00:28 - page or something of that nature within
00:30 - your action attribute we're not actually
00:32 - going to do a form submission but just
00:34 - be aware that the action attribute sends
00:36 - data to this location to this file the
00:39 - file listed really can be anything but
00:41 - that's outside the scope of this lesson
00:43 - you'll also see a method the method
00:45 - attribute specifies if this is a get
00:48 - request or a post request post is used
00:51 - for confidential information such as a
00:54 - username and a password get is for
00:56 - insensitive data basically again this is
00:58 - outside the scope of HTML at this point
01:00 - in time if we have a form and we're
01:03 - sending sensitive data we should use
01:05 - post now let's create some elements
01:07 - within our form the first thing we'll
01:09 - create is a text box we need a
01:11 - self-closing input tag
01:13 - so here's our text box by default the
01:16 - type is a text box but we can specify
01:19 - that with the type
01:21 - so type text there's other different
01:24 - types like passwords emails telephone
01:27 - numbers we'll cover that pretty soon we
01:29 - have a text box but if a user sees this
01:32 - text box they probably don't know what
01:34 - they should enter in let's add a label
01:36 - to the text box
01:37 - preceding my input tag I will create a
01:40 - pair of label tags what do we want our
01:43 - label to say
01:44 - maybe username we're telling the user
01:46 - hey we want you to enter in your
01:48 - username if somebody is using a screen
01:50 - reader if they're visually impaired we
01:52 - should add a four attribute what is this
01:55 - for well this is for my username another
01:59 - benefit of adding the four attribute to
02:01 - a label when you click on the label your
02:03 - cursor will move to the text box but we
02:06 - need a matching ID attribute within the
02:08 - input tag
02:09 - so the ID is going to be the same as the
02:12 - four attribute then when I click on the
02:15 - label our cursor moves to the text box
02:17 - there are a few other attributes you
02:19 - might be interested in as well but
02:21 - before we get to that we should create a
02:23 - submit button to submit our data at the
02:25 - end of our form we'll create an input
02:28 - tag
02:29 - the type will be submit
02:34 - it's a submit button but it currently
02:37 - doesn't do anything we're not using a
02:39 - back-end language to submit form data to
02:42 - there are some useful attributes for
02:43 - text boxes within the input element for
02:46 - our text box let's add the required
02:49 - attribute
02:50 - in order to submit this form we need to
02:52 - type in a password if I just leave it
02:54 - blank then hit submit we have this
02:57 - little prompt please fill out this field
03:00 - I can't submit this form until I type in
03:02 - something
03:04 - then I can submit it you could set a
03:07 - minimum and maximum length
03:09 - that's another attribute Min length
03:12 - equals then some length the minimum
03:16 - length per username is six characters
03:20 - let's type in just three or some other
03:23 - number below six submit
03:25 - please lengthen this text to six
03:27 - characters or more
03:29 - I'll come up with a different username
03:31 - then submit and that appears to work
03:34 - you also have the capability of setting
03:36 - a maximum length
03:37 - with the max length attribute let's make
03:41 - the max length 15 characters
03:43 - so let's type in a username
03:47 - I'll add a bunch of characters
03:48 - afterwards so I can type in any more
03:51 - than 15 characters there's a maximum
03:54 - to reset your form there's a reset
03:56 - button let's copy this input tag
04:00 - paste it then change type to reset
04:04 - so here's my reset button I'll type in a
04:07 - username press reset then we can reset
04:10 - the data for our form but afterwards I'm
04:13 - just going to add a break line just to
04:14 - put the submit button on a new line with
04:17 - text boxes you can add a placeholder to
04:19 - give the user an idea of what we want
04:21 - them to enter in and in what format I'm
04:24 - going to add a place holder attribute
04:29 - what do we want our placeholder to be I
04:32 - don't know SpongeBob SquarePants or
04:34 - maybe just SpongeBob so the placeholder
04:36 - is faded it gives a hint to the user as
04:39 - to the format in which they should enter
04:40 - in information if I were to click on
04:42 - this text box the hint is still there
04:44 - until we type in something
04:47 - okay let's cover passwords
04:50 - to create a password we'll use an input
04:52 - tag the type
04:55 - is going to be password
04:58 - we should probably add a label to let
05:00 - the user know that we would like a
05:02 - password
05:03 - so I'm just going to copy the label that
05:05 - we have for our username
05:07 - the four attribute of our label should
05:09 - match the ID attribute of our input tag
05:12 - so the ID is going to be password the
05:17 - for attribute of the label will be
05:19 - password and then change the text to
05:23 - there we are
05:25 - I'm just going to change one thing after
05:28 - my password I'm going to add a break
05:29 - line so I will add that here
05:33 - all right so with the password the text
05:35 - is hidden I can type in a bunch of
05:37 - characters and you can't see it
05:39 - you could add some of these attributes
05:40 - as well like a minimum length maximum
05:42 - length and the required attribute
05:45 - so I'll copy those and paste them within
05:47 - the input tag from my password
05:50 - I can type in a username if I attempt to
05:53 - submit this form data without a password
05:55 - we have that prompt please fill out this
05:58 - field that's because we have the
05:59 - required attribute set there's also a
06:02 - minimum length and a maximum length set
06:03 - too I'm required to type in a password
06:05 - that's at least six characters long
06:08 - right now this is only five anything
06:10 - between 6 and 15 is okay
06:12 - for the rest of this demonstration I'm
06:14 - going to get rid of these attributes
06:16 - let's cover email next I'll create a
06:19 - label first
06:21 - this will be for email the text will be
06:25 - email
06:26 - then we'll need a corresponding input
06:28 - tag
06:29 - input type equals email for the ID I
06:34 - will also set that to be email
06:37 - I'll add a line break after then I'll
06:39 - add a placeholder
06:42 - s
06:43 - Square Pants
06:45 - at gmail.com
06:47 - again the placeholders letting the user
06:49 - know the format in which they should
06:51 - type in their information if I were to
06:54 - type in some text but we're missing that
06:56 - at sign
06:58 - hold on let me type in something real
07:00 - quick
07:01 - all right click submit we have a prompt
07:04 - please include an at sign in the email
07:06 - address because we're looking for a
07:08 - valid email address format that's input
07:11 - for email let's copy our label
07:14 - for
07:16 - phone
07:18 - the text will be phone number
07:23 - again we need an input tag the type will
07:27 - be Tel for telephone
07:30 - we need a matching ID that matches the
07:32 - for attribute
07:34 - phone
07:35 - I'll add a break element to the end
07:38 - we can type in a phone number I'll add a
07:40 - placeholder too
07:43 - placeholder equals with American
07:46 - telephone numbers you have three digits
07:48 - such as one two three dash then another
07:51 - three digits like four five six dash
07:54 - then four digits seven eight nine zero
07:56 - So currently we can type in any numbers
07:59 - then submit them uh hold on I need a
08:01 - username
08:03 - we can limit the format in which a user
08:05 - can type in some numbers for a phone
08:07 - number
08:08 - we would need a pattern attribute
08:10 - for the digits 0 through 9 within a set
08:13 - of straight brackets you would type 0-9
08:17 - then how many digits do you allow
08:19 - afterwards
08:20 - three then we'll need a dash that's
08:23 - required add a dash
08:25 - then another three digits zero through
08:27 - nine zero Dash nine
08:30 - then another three digits Dash
08:34 - number zero through nine let me move
08:37 - this in a little bit then I would like
08:39 - four digits so now our phone number
08:41 - needs to be in this format three digits
08:43 - Dash three digits Dash four digits one
08:47 - two three dash four five six seven eight
08:49 - nine zero
08:51 - hold on I'm going to get rid of this
08:53 - required attribute just because it's
08:54 - kind of annoying right now one two
08:56 - three-456-7890
09:00 - there that seems to work but if I were
09:02 - to type in a random amount of numbers
09:05 - well then we don't meet this pattern
09:07 - matching this pattern is required in
09:10 - order to submit this data
09:12 - all right then we have dates like a
09:15 - birth date we'll need a label
09:18 - this will be for a birth date
09:21 - four b day
09:25 - input type equals date
09:30 - the ID should match the four attribute
09:33 - of the label
09:35 - then I'll add a break element
09:38 - so with dates there's an interactive
09:40 - calendar to select a date
09:42 - pretty simple then we have a number
09:44 - element a user is going to enter in a
09:47 - quantity like they're buying something
09:49 - like how many do you want
09:52 - let's change the text to quantity
09:55 - for
09:57 - quantity
10:00 - we need an input element
10:02 - the type will be number
10:06 - ID equals
10:08 - quantity
10:10 - then I'll add a break
10:12 - so here's our quantity
10:14 - we can use these arrows to go up or down
10:18 - however normally you can go into
10:19 - negative numbers we can set a minimum
10:22 - and a maximum with the Min and Max
10:25 - attributes so the minimum will be zero
10:27 - we don't want to go below zero the max I
10:31 - think 99 is good
10:33 - so we can't go below zero but we can go
10:35 - all the way to 99 and no further you can
10:38 - add a default value with the value
10:40 - attribute I'll set the default to be one
10:42 - that is for number input it's good if
10:44 - you need a quantity of something
10:46 - all right then radio buttons radio
10:48 - buttons are a little tricky with radio
10:50 - buttons you can only select one from a
10:52 - group I think a good label will be for a
10:55 - title are you a mister a miss a doctor
10:58 - whatever like what's your title so title
11:02 - for title
11:04 - we have our title so far then we'll need
11:07 - individual buttons I'll create a label
11:09 - for Mr Miss and doctor
11:12 - Mr
11:15 - Miss
11:17 - in the U.S doctor is p h d
11:23 - the four attribute will be Mr for Mr
11:26 - Miss for Miss
11:29 - then p h d for PhD
11:33 - I'm gonna get rid of these colons
11:36 - so after each label we'll create a radio
11:38 - button
11:40 - input type equals radio
11:44 - the ID will match the four attribute of
11:47 - the label we have Mr
11:49 - then we'll want to add a value to when
11:52 - we submit this form so mister
11:55 - okay let's copy this input then apply it
11:58 - to miss add PhD so type radio ID will be
12:03 - Miss value Miss
12:05 - then we have PhD
12:08 - ID will be PhD value PhD
12:13 - so we have three radio buttons
12:16 - um let me just add a break afterwards
12:18 - with a group of radio buttons you should
12:20 - only be able to select one
12:22 - however we can select all three that's
12:25 - because we need to add all of these
12:27 - radio buttons to the same group we're
12:29 - going to add a name attribute
12:32 - we'll name this attribute title
12:34 - whichever radio buttons you would like
12:36 - in the same group they need to share the
12:38 - same title
12:39 - now we only can select one those are
12:42 - radio buttons
12:44 - okay let's create a drop down menu
12:48 - this will be for a payment like what
12:51 - kind of card are you paying with is it a
12:53 - Visa card MasterCard gift card
12:56 - four
12:57 - payment instead of an input element
13:00 - we're going to be using a pair of Select
13:02 - tags
13:03 - for a select element
13:07 - then add a break afterwards
13:10 - so we have a drop down menu but there's
13:11 - no options
13:13 - we will add option elements within our
13:15 - select element
13:17 - so these have opening and closing tags
13:21 - let's create three options
13:24 - an option for Visa Mastercard then gift
13:27 - card for option one the value will be
13:31 - Visa
13:33 - the text will be Visa
13:37 - so we have one option let's add two more
13:41 - value
13:43 - MasterCard
13:44 - the text will be
13:46 - MasterCard
13:49 - then a gift card
13:51 - value equals
13:54 - gift card the text will be gift card
13:57 - then I forgot to add an ID to the
14:00 - opening select element
14:01 - ID equals payment
14:05 - there we are all right so that is a drop
14:07 - down menu you need a pair of Select tags
14:10 - within the select tags you can create
14:12 - option tags then we have a check box
14:14 - again let's create a label this will be
14:17 - for a check box
14:19 - I think a good use of a checkbox will be
14:22 - a subscribe button the four attribute
14:24 - will be subscribed
14:27 - the text will be
14:29 - subscribe
14:32 - we'll need an input element input
14:35 - type
14:37 - equals checkbox
14:40 - the ID will match the four attribute of
14:43 - the label
14:45 - then add a break element after
14:48 - I can subscribe by checking the check
14:50 - box
14:51 - or by clicking on the label this one's a
14:54 - little tricky we're going to create a
14:56 - text area
14:57 - again we'll need a label the text next
15:00 - to the text area will be comment
15:03 - for
15:04 - comment
15:06 - we'll create a pair of text area tags
15:11 - so we have a text area
15:13 - the ID of the text area will match the
15:16 - four attribute of the label so comment
15:19 - you can change the dimensions of your
15:22 - text box by adjusting the rows and
15:24 - columns I would like three rows rows
15:27 - equals three
15:29 - columns that will be 25. so now we have
15:33 - different dimensions for our comment you
15:35 - can type in anything you suck bro code
15:39 - that's how to create a text area for a
15:42 - file submission again we'll create a
15:44 - label we're kind of following the same
15:45 - pattern
15:47 - file
15:48 - for file
15:52 - again we need an input tag
15:54 - input type equals file
16:00 - the ID will match the four attribute of
16:03 - the label
16:04 - file
16:07 - then I'll add a break
16:09 - so now we can choose a file however by
16:12 - default we can accept all files
16:14 - to limit the type of file that you're
16:16 - looking for there is an accept attribute
16:20 - what file types will we accept Let's do
16:23 - an image for a PNG that would be image
16:26 - slash PNG
16:29 - when I choose a file we're looking for a
16:32 - PNG now you can add more than one file
16:35 - type each file type is comma separated
16:38 - let's also look for any jpegs
16:42 - so that would be jpeg
16:46 - so now we're looking for a bunch of
16:48 - files anything within this range
16:51 - now if you're sending a large amount of
16:52 - data there's one change we'll make to
16:54 - the form
16:55 - we're going to change the encryption
16:57 - type within the opening form tag let's
17:00 - say we're sending an image and the image
17:02 - is a large file so we will set the
17:04 - encryption type
17:06 - equal to B multi
17:09 - part slash form
17:12 - data in simple terms when we send our
17:16 - large amount of data we'll break it into
17:18 - multiple parts then when all of that
17:20 - data is received those multiple parts
17:22 - will be reassembled it's a little more
17:25 - complicated than that but at this level
17:27 - that's all you need to know so if you're
17:29 - sending a large file such as an image
17:32 - I would recommend changing the
17:34 - encryption type to multi-part slash form
17:36 - data alright everybody so that's how to
17:39 - create a very basic form using HTML it
17:42 - really doesn't look too pretty right now
17:44 - you can always style it with CSS which
17:46 - we'll be covering very soon and well
17:49 - yeah that's how to create a form using
17:51 - HTML

Cleaned transcript:

hello again friends today I'm going to explain how we can create a form using HTML to create a form we'll need a pair of form tags the opening form tag has a few attributes we need to fill in first is an action attribute after submitting our form to what location do we want to send our form to form submission is done with the back end language such as PHP you might see a file name such as index.php or action page or something of that nature within your action attribute we're not actually going to do a form submission but just be aware that the action attribute sends data to this location to this file the file listed really can be anything but that's outside the scope of this lesson you'll also see a method the method attribute specifies if this is a get request or a post request post is used for confidential information such as a username and a password get is for insensitive data basically again this is outside the scope of HTML at this point in time if we have a form and we're sending sensitive data we should use post now let's create some elements within our form the first thing we'll create is a text box we need a selfclosing input tag so here's our text box by default the type is a text box but we can specify that with the type so type text there's other different types like passwords emails telephone numbers we'll cover that pretty soon we have a text box but if a user sees this text box they probably don't know what they should enter in let's add a label to the text box preceding my input tag I will create a pair of label tags what do we want our label to say maybe username we're telling the user hey we want you to enter in your username if somebody is using a screen reader if they're visually impaired we should add a four attribute what is this for well this is for my username another benefit of adding the four attribute to a label when you click on the label your cursor will move to the text box but we need a matching ID attribute within the input tag so the ID is going to be the same as the four attribute then when I click on the label our cursor moves to the text box there are a few other attributes you might be interested in as well but before we get to that we should create a submit button to submit our data at the end of our form we'll create an input tag the type will be submit it's a submit button but it currently doesn't do anything we're not using a backend language to submit form data to there are some useful attributes for text boxes within the input element for our text box let's add the required attribute in order to submit this form we need to type in a password if I just leave it blank then hit submit we have this little prompt please fill out this field I can't submit this form until I type in something then I can submit it you could set a minimum and maximum length that's another attribute Min length equals then some length the minimum length per username is six characters let's type in just three or some other number below six submit please lengthen this text to six characters or more I'll come up with a different username then submit and that appears to work you also have the capability of setting a maximum length with the max length attribute let's make the max length 15 characters so let's type in a username I'll add a bunch of characters afterwards so I can type in any more than 15 characters there's a maximum to reset your form there's a reset button let's copy this input tag paste it then change type to reset so here's my reset button I'll type in a username press reset then we can reset the data for our form but afterwards I'm just going to add a break line just to put the submit button on a new line with text boxes you can add a placeholder to give the user an idea of what we want them to enter in and in what format I'm going to add a place holder attribute what do we want our placeholder to be I don't know SpongeBob SquarePants or maybe just SpongeBob so the placeholder is faded it gives a hint to the user as to the format in which they should enter in information if I were to click on this text box the hint is still there until we type in something okay let's cover passwords to create a password we'll use an input tag the type is going to be password we should probably add a label to let the user know that we would like a password so I'm just going to copy the label that we have for our username the four attribute of our label should match the ID attribute of our input tag so the ID is going to be password the for attribute of the label will be password and then change the text to there we are I'm just going to change one thing after my password I'm going to add a break line so I will add that here all right so with the password the text is hidden I can type in a bunch of characters and you can't see it you could add some of these attributes as well like a minimum length maximum length and the required attribute so I'll copy those and paste them within the input tag from my password I can type in a username if I attempt to submit this form data without a password we have that prompt please fill out this field that's because we have the required attribute set there's also a minimum length and a maximum length set too I'm required to type in a password that's at least six characters long right now this is only five anything between 6 and 15 is okay for the rest of this demonstration I'm going to get rid of these attributes let's cover email next I'll create a label first this will be for email the text will be email then we'll need a corresponding input tag input type equals email for the ID I will also set that to be email I'll add a line break after then I'll add a placeholder s Square Pants at gmail.com again the placeholders letting the user know the format in which they should type in their information if I were to type in some text but we're missing that at sign hold on let me type in something real quick all right click submit we have a prompt please include an at sign in the email address because we're looking for a valid email address format that's input for email let's copy our label for phone the text will be phone number again we need an input tag the type will be Tel for telephone we need a matching ID that matches the for attribute phone I'll add a break element to the end we can type in a phone number I'll add a placeholder too placeholder equals with American telephone numbers you have three digits such as one two three dash then another three digits like four five six dash then four digits seven eight nine zero So currently we can type in any numbers then submit them uh hold on I need a username we can limit the format in which a user can type in some numbers for a phone number we would need a pattern attribute for the digits 0 through 9 within a set of straight brackets you would type 09 then how many digits do you allow afterwards three then we'll need a dash that's required add a dash then another three digits zero through nine zero Dash nine then another three digits Dash number zero through nine let me move this in a little bit then I would like four digits so now our phone number needs to be in this format three digits Dash three digits Dash four digits one two three dash four five six seven eight nine zero hold on I'm going to get rid of this required attribute just because it's kind of annoying right now one two three4567890 there that seems to work but if I were to type in a random amount of numbers well then we don't meet this pattern matching this pattern is required in order to submit this data all right then we have dates like a birth date we'll need a label this will be for a birth date four b day input type equals date the ID should match the four attribute of the label then I'll add a break element so with dates there's an interactive calendar to select a date pretty simple then we have a number element a user is going to enter in a quantity like they're buying something like how many do you want let's change the text to quantity for quantity we need an input element the type will be number ID equals quantity then I'll add a break so here's our quantity we can use these arrows to go up or down however normally you can go into negative numbers we can set a minimum and a maximum with the Min and Max attributes so the minimum will be zero we don't want to go below zero the max I think 99 is good so we can't go below zero but we can go all the way to 99 and no further you can add a default value with the value attribute I'll set the default to be one that is for number input it's good if you need a quantity of something all right then radio buttons radio buttons are a little tricky with radio buttons you can only select one from a group I think a good label will be for a title are you a mister a miss a doctor whatever like what's your title so title for title we have our title so far then we'll need individual buttons I'll create a label for Mr Miss and doctor Mr Miss in the U.S doctor is p h d the four attribute will be Mr for Mr Miss for Miss then p h d for PhD I'm gonna get rid of these colons so after each label we'll create a radio button input type equals radio the ID will match the four attribute of the label we have Mr then we'll want to add a value to when we submit this form so mister okay let's copy this input then apply it to miss add PhD so type radio ID will be Miss value Miss then we have PhD ID will be PhD value PhD so we have three radio buttons um let me just add a break afterwards with a group of radio buttons you should only be able to select one however we can select all three that's because we need to add all of these radio buttons to the same group we're going to add a name attribute we'll name this attribute title whichever radio buttons you would like in the same group they need to share the same title now we only can select one those are radio buttons okay let's create a drop down menu this will be for a payment like what kind of card are you paying with is it a Visa card MasterCard gift card four payment instead of an input element we're going to be using a pair of Select tags for a select element then add a break afterwards so we have a drop down menu but there's no options we will add option elements within our select element so these have opening and closing tags let's create three options an option for Visa Mastercard then gift card for option one the value will be Visa the text will be Visa so we have one option let's add two more value MasterCard the text will be MasterCard then a gift card value equals gift card the text will be gift card then I forgot to add an ID to the opening select element ID equals payment there we are all right so that is a drop down menu you need a pair of Select tags within the select tags you can create option tags then we have a check box again let's create a label this will be for a check box I think a good use of a checkbox will be a subscribe button the four attribute will be subscribed the text will be subscribe we'll need an input element input type equals checkbox the ID will match the four attribute of the label then add a break element after I can subscribe by checking the check box or by clicking on the label this one's a little tricky we're going to create a text area again we'll need a label the text next to the text area will be comment for comment we'll create a pair of text area tags so we have a text area the ID of the text area will match the four attribute of the label so comment you can change the dimensions of your text box by adjusting the rows and columns I would like three rows rows equals three columns that will be 25. so now we have different dimensions for our comment you can type in anything you suck bro code that's how to create a text area for a file submission again we'll create a label we're kind of following the same pattern file for file again we need an input tag input type equals file the ID will match the four attribute of the label file then I'll add a break so now we can choose a file however by default we can accept all files to limit the type of file that you're looking for there is an accept attribute what file types will we accept Let's do an image for a PNG that would be image slash PNG when I choose a file we're looking for a PNG now you can add more than one file type each file type is comma separated let's also look for any jpegs so that would be jpeg so now we're looking for a bunch of files anything within this range now if you're sending a large amount of data there's one change we'll make to the form we're going to change the encryption type within the opening form tag let's say we're sending an image and the image is a large file so we will set the encryption type equal to B multi part slash form data in simple terms when we send our large amount of data we'll break it into multiple parts then when all of that data is received those multiple parts will be reassembled it's a little more complicated than that but at this level that's all you need to know so if you're sending a large file such as an image I would recommend changing the encryption type to multipart slash form data alright everybody so that's how to create a very basic form using HTML it really doesn't look too pretty right now you can always style it with CSS which we'll be covering very soon and well yeah that's how to create a form using HTML
