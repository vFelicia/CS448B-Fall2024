00:00 - hey everybody in today's video I need to
00:02 - explain for Loops a for Loop will repeat
00:05 - some code a certain amount of times for
00:08 - example I will display the word hello
00:12 - then I will add a line break I can write
00:15 - code once then repeat it however many
00:18 - times that I want with the for Loop to
00:21 - create a for Loop Type 4 parentheses
00:24 - curly braces then place your code you
00:27 - want to be repeated Within These set of
00:29 - curly braces
00:31 - I would like to display the word hello a
00:34 - certain amount of times that's the nice
00:35 - thing about for Loops you can write code
00:37 - once then repeat it but we'll need to
00:40 - calculate how many times we're going to
00:41 - repeat it within the parentheses of the
00:43 - for Loop we can write up to three
00:46 - optional statements each separated with
00:48 - a semicolon the first statement is that
00:51 - we can create a counter it's as if we're
00:54 - assigning a variable a common naming
00:56 - convention for a counter is variable I I
00:59 - meaning index I can set this equal to
01:02 - zero to begin with the next statement is
01:05 - a stopping condition
01:07 - when this condition is no longer true we
01:10 - escape the for loop I would like to
01:12 - display the word hello five times my
01:15 - condition will be variable I
01:17 - is less than five
01:20 - once I is no longer less than five we
01:23 - will escape
01:24 - the third optional statement we can use
01:27 - to increment or decrement our counter
01:30 - after each iteration I will increment I
01:32 - by One I plus plus
01:36 - this code will be repeated five times
01:39 - here we are one two three four five
01:43 - instead of displaying the word hello
01:45 - let's display our index I
01:48 - then add a line break
01:54 - I currently holds our counter we set the
01:57 - counter to begin at zero and it will
02:00 - stop when I reaches five zero one two
02:04 - three four maybe we would like to start
02:06 - at one
02:07 - and continue as long as I is less than
02:10 - or equal to five then we're no longer
02:13 - beginning at zero
02:15 - we could change this condition to be ten
02:18 - we will count up to ten
02:20 - or one hundred
02:22 - we will count up to one hundred
02:24 - when you increment your variable you can
02:27 - increment by a different number like two
02:28 - I plus equals two
02:32 - we are now counting up by twos one three
02:35 - five seven if we change our counter to
02:38 - be two we'll start at two then count up
02:41 - by two or maybe we can count up by
02:43 - threes
02:44 - two five eight eleven
02:47 - now to decrement let's begin at ten our
02:50 - counter will be at ten
02:52 - we'll continue this for loop as long as
02:54 - I is greater than zero
02:58 - then to decrement take I then add minus
03:02 - minus
03:03 - so now we begin at 10 and decrement by
03:06 - one during each iteration
03:08 - or we can even decrement by twos I minus
03:11 - equals two
03:13 - so we begin at ten and we're
03:15 - decrementing by twos so that's a for
03:17 - Loop you repeat some code a certain
03:20 - amount of times there are three optional
03:22 - statements within the for Loop a counter
03:25 - we can declare a condition then we can
03:28 - increment our counter by a certain
03:29 - amount or decrement
03:31 - let's go over an exercise
03:34 - we will create an HTML form
03:37 - in vs code hit exclamation point tab
03:40 - that will generate some HTML code
03:43 - we'll create a form
03:49 - the opening form tag will have an action
03:51 - attribute of
03:53 - our PHP page index.php
03:57 - the method let's assign to post
04:02 - we'll create a label
04:04 - label
04:05 - close it
04:08 - enter a number two count two
04:17 - we will add a text box input type
04:21 - the type is text
04:23 - the name will be counter
04:28 - then a submit button
04:30 - input type equals submit
04:34 - for the value
04:36 - let's say start
04:38 - the user is going to type in a number to
04:40 - count up to we'll need to get that value
04:43 - from the text box
04:45 - let's say variable counter
04:47 - we will access the post super Global
04:50 - variable
04:53 - we would like our counter
04:58 - then we'll create a for Loop four
05:00 - parentheses curly braces
05:02 - we'll need our index for our for Loop
05:06 - so variable I
05:08 - equals zero to begin with we're counting
05:11 - up our condition will be variable I
05:15 - is less than or equal to our counter
05:20 - then we will increment variable I by 1
05:22 - during each iteration
05:24 - during each iteration let's Echo
05:27 - whatever variable I is
05:29 - then add a line break
05:32 - let's see what happens
05:34 - let's refresh this let's count up to ten
05:37 - I'll enter ten Press Start then we count
05:40 - up to 10. if you would like to exclude
05:43 - zero we can set I to be one
05:46 - there we are we have counted up to ten
05:48 - or I could pick a different number like
05:50 - 100. Press Start we now count up to 100.
05:55 - now what we're going to do is count down
05:57 - from a number enter a number to count
06:01 - down from
06:04 - we're going to change our for Loop a
06:05 - little bit we will set our counter of I
06:08 - to equal
06:09 - the number that we receive our counter
06:12 - variable
06:14 - will continue as long as I is greater
06:17 - than zero then we will decrement I
06:22 - so let's save
06:24 - you might have to refresh let's count
06:26 - down from 10. Press Start and here we
06:29 - are we have started at 10 and we have
06:31 - counted down to one
06:33 - or I can enter a different number like
06:35 - 100
06:36 - so we start at 100 then count down to
06:39 - one
06:40 - so that's a for Loop everybody you can
06:43 - repeat some code a certain amount of
06:45 - times you only have to write it once
06:48 - then repeat it however many times that
06:50 - you need and well everybody those are
06:52 - for Loops in PHP

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody in today's video I need to explain for Loops a for Loop will repeat some code a certain amount of times for example I will display the word hello then I will add a line break I can write code once then repeat it however many times that I want with the for Loop to create a for Loop Type 4 parentheses curly braces then place your code you want to be repeated Within These set of curly braces I would like to display the word hello a certain amount of times that's the nice thing about for Loops you can write code once then repeat it but we'll need to calculate how many times we're going to repeat it within the parentheses of the for Loop we can write up to three optional statements each separated with a semicolon the first statement is that we can create a counter it's as if we're assigning a variable a common naming convention for a counter is variable I I meaning index I can set this equal to zero to begin with the next statement is a stopping condition when this condition is no longer true we escape the for loop I would like to display the word hello five times my condition will be variable I is less than five once I is no longer less than five we will escape the third optional statement we can use to increment or decrement our counter after each iteration I will increment I by One I plus plus this code will be repeated five times here we are one two three four five instead of displaying the word hello let's display our index I then add a line break I currently holds our counter we set the counter to begin at zero and it will stop when I reaches five zero one two three four maybe we would like to start at one and continue as long as I is less than or equal to five then we're no longer beginning at zero we could change this condition to be ten we will count up to ten or one hundred we will count up to one hundred when you increment your variable you can increment by a different number like two I plus equals two we are now counting up by twos one three five seven if we change our counter to be two we'll start at two then count up by two or maybe we can count up by threes two five eight eleven now to decrement let's begin at ten our counter will be at ten we'll continue this for loop as long as I is greater than zero then to decrement take I then add minus minus so now we begin at 10 and decrement by one during each iteration or we can even decrement by twos I minus equals two so we begin at ten and we're decrementing by twos so that's a for Loop you repeat some code a certain amount of times there are three optional statements within the for Loop a counter we can declare a condition then we can increment our counter by a certain amount or decrement let's go over an exercise we will create an HTML form in vs code hit exclamation point tab that will generate some HTML code we'll create a form the opening form tag will have an action attribute of our PHP page index.php the method let's assign to post we'll create a label label close it enter a number two count two we will add a text box input type the type is text the name will be counter then a submit button input type equals submit for the value let's say start the user is going to type in a number to count up to we'll need to get that value from the text box let's say variable counter we will access the post super Global variable we would like our counter then we'll create a for Loop four parentheses curly braces we'll need our index for our for Loop so variable I equals zero to begin with we're counting up our condition will be variable I is less than or equal to our counter then we will increment variable I by 1 during each iteration during each iteration let's Echo whatever variable I is then add a line break let's see what happens let's refresh this let's count up to ten I'll enter ten Press Start then we count up to 10. if you would like to exclude zero we can set I to be one there we are we have counted up to ten or I could pick a different number like 100. Press Start we now count up to 100. now what we're going to do is count down from a number enter a number to count down from we're going to change our for Loop a little bit we will set our counter of I to equal the number that we receive our counter variable will continue as long as I is greater than zero then we will decrement I so let's save you might have to refresh let's count down from 10. Press Start and here we are we have started at 10 and we have counted down to one or I can enter a different number like 100 so we start at 100 then count down to one so that's a for Loop everybody you can repeat some code a certain amount of times you only have to write it once then repeat it however many times that you need and well everybody those are for Loops in PHP
