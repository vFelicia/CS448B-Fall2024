00:00 - hey everybody in this video I'm going to
00:02 - show you all of the different math that
00:04 - we'll need throughout the rest of the
00:05 - series I have a lot to cover and I'll
00:07 - split this video into different sections
00:09 - we'll cover some basic arithmetic
00:11 - operators built-in math functions a few
00:15 - functions from the math module and then
00:17 - a few exercises be sure to look at the
00:19 - timestamps if you would like to skip
00:21 - ahead to another section let's begin
00:22 - with some really easy stuff we're going
00:24 - to cover some basic arithmetic operators
00:26 - let's say we have a variable
00:29 - friends
00:31 - currently you have zero friends if you
00:34 - need to increment a variable by one you
00:36 - could say
00:37 - friends
00:39 - the name of the variable equals the name
00:41 - of the variable again plus one so the
00:44 - plus sign is the addition operator and I
00:47 - think we do have a little bit of
00:48 - experience with that already so if I
00:50 - were to print my variable friends
00:55 - guess what you now have one friend we
00:57 - could also shorten this line of code
01:00 - you could say
01:02 - friends plus equals one that would do
01:06 - the same thing this is known as an
01:08 - augmented assignment operator
01:11 - that will give you the same result I
01:13 - prefer to use augmented assignment
01:15 - operators just because they take less
01:17 - text and I think they're easier to read
01:19 - now let's use subtraction
01:21 - friends equals friends
01:25 - minus two so of course minus is the
01:27 - subtraction operator you have negative
01:30 - two friends I guess
01:31 - if you were to use the augmented
01:33 - assignment operator that would be
01:35 - friends minus equals two
01:39 - there you still have negative two
01:41 - friends
01:42 - okay multiplication let's change friends
01:44 - to
01:46 - how about five
01:48 - friends equals friends
01:50 - times three
01:53 - you now have 15 friends
01:56 - then the augmented assignment operator
01:58 - version of this would be friends
02:00 - times equals three
02:06 - so again you have 15 friends let's cover
02:09 - division
02:12 - friends equals friends
02:15 - divided by two
02:19 - so we have 2.5 friends somebody was cut
02:22 - in half we have half a friend maybe it's
02:25 - just their legs or torso or something
02:27 - then the augmented assignment operator
02:29 - would be friends
02:31 - divided by equals two
02:34 - and the result is still the same
02:38 - now exponents friends equals friends
02:43 - to the power of two so friends is
02:46 - currently five
02:48 - friends to the power of two would be
02:49 - five times five which is 25.
02:55 - the augmented assignment operator
02:57 - version of this equation would be
02:59 - friends
03:01 - exponent equals two
03:05 - and again friends is 25.
03:08 - then we have modulus modulus gives you
03:10 - the remainder of any division suppose we
03:13 - have 10 friends instead of five I will
03:15 - assign a new variable remainder
03:19 - remainder equals friends
03:22 - the percent signed is known as the
03:24 - modulus operator it will give us the
03:26 - remainder of any Division if I were to
03:29 - divide my group of friends by three we
03:31 - will have one remaining I'll store the
03:33 - remainder within a separate variable we
03:35 - would have a remainder of one it's kind
03:37 - of like in class when the teacher says
03:39 - for everybody in the class to go into
03:41 - groups of three then there's always that
03:43 - one kid that's by themselves
03:45 - that's kind of the same concept we're
03:47 - dividing our friends into groups of
03:49 - three then the modulus will give you the
03:51 - remainder if we divided our group of
03:53 - friends into groups of two well ten
03:56 - divides by two evenly so there is no
03:58 - remainder
03:59 - so that is the modulus operator it's
04:02 - fairly popular to use this operator to
04:04 - find if a number is even or odd because
04:06 - it will divide by two evenly if that
04:08 - number is even if the remainder is 1
04:10 - that means that the original number is
04:12 - odd okay so yeah those are some basic
04:15 - arithmetic operators addition
04:17 - subtraction multiplication division
04:19 - exponentiation then modulus
04:23 - now what we're going to do is cover some
04:25 - built-in math related functions suppose
04:27 - we have three variables x equals 3.14
04:31 - y equals four
04:35 - Z equals five it doesn't matter if these
04:38 - are floating Point numbers or whole
04:40 - integers
04:41 - the first is the round function we have
04:43 - a variable named result
04:45 - I'm going to round X
04:49 - so there is a built-in round function
04:51 - after the set of parentheses
04:53 - we can add some value or variable to be
04:56 - rounded
04:57 - so we will round x to the nearest whole
05:00 - integer then print the result
05:04 - so our result
05:05 - is three so that's the round function
05:10 - with the absolute value function we can
05:12 - find the absolute value of a number
05:14 - let's change y to be negative four
05:17 - instead of four
05:19 - we'll take result equals ABS which means
05:23 - absolute value of y the absolute value
05:27 - is the distance away from zero as a
05:29 - whole number
05:31 - the absolute value of negative 4 is 4.
05:36 - let's change y back to four
05:41 - there's a built-in power function
05:44 - result equals pow
05:47 - then we'll need a base and an exponent
05:50 - what's y to the power of three
05:56 - that would be four times four times four
05:58 - which is 64. that's the power function
06:02 - you can raise the base to a given power
06:06 - the next two are really useful
06:08 - using the max function we can find the
06:11 - maximum value
06:12 - of various values what's the maximum
06:15 - value between X Y and Z then I'll just
06:19 - need to store this value
06:21 - result equals the max between X Y and Z
06:26 - well the maximum value is five
06:30 - otherwise there's min
06:36 - what's the minimum value between x y and
06:38 - z
06:39 - that would be 3.14
06:43 - now in this next section we do have some
06:45 - very useful constants and functions from
06:47 - the math class but we'll need to import
06:50 - the math module at the top of our text
06:52 - editor
06:53 - so import math if you need the value of
06:57 - pi you'll type the name of the math
06:59 - module
07:00 - dot pi
07:02 - and I'm just going to print this
07:04 - print math dot pi
07:07 - the value of pi is
07:10 - 3.14159 and a bunch of digits that come
07:13 - after
07:14 - if you're working with physics I do know
07:16 - that people use the constant e a lot we
07:19 - won't be using e in this video series
07:21 - but if you ever need access to it just
07:23 - type math dot e
07:26 - and that will give you e which is 2.71
07:28 - something something something I believe
07:31 - e is known as the exponential constant
07:34 - if you need the square root of a number
07:37 - let's say result equals math dot s q r t
07:43 - we can place a variable or a value
07:46 - within the square root function let's
07:48 - say we have X again
07:49 - x equals 9.
07:52 - what is the square root of x
07:55 - then I will print whatever the result is
07:59 - the square root of 9 is 3. that is the
08:03 - square root function
08:06 - there's a ceiling function result equals
08:09 - math
08:11 - dot seal
08:13 - seal will always round a floating Point
08:15 - number up suppose X is 9.1
08:21 - so 9.1 rounded up is 10.
08:25 - otherwise there's floor which will
08:28 - always round a number down result equals
08:31 - math dot floor let's change X to 9.9
08:36 - .9 rounded down is 9. those are some
08:41 - useful math functions let's go over some
08:43 - exercises
08:45 - okay this first exercise we are going to
08:47 - calculate the circumference of a circle
08:50 - we'll need the help of the math module
08:52 - because there's some good functions in
08:54 - there to calculate the circumference of
08:56 - a circle
08:57 - the formula is 2 times pi times R let's
09:01 - ask a user for a radius
09:04 - because that's what R is we'll accept
09:06 - some user input
09:09 - enter the radius of a circle
09:15 - we will Typecast the input as a floating
09:18 - Point number
09:21 - to calculate the circumference
09:26 - again the equation is 2 times pi we can
09:30 - get that from the math module
09:33 - times whatever the radius is
09:35 - and the user is going to type that in
09:37 - then we will print whatever the
09:39 - circumference is
09:41 - print we'll use an upstring
09:43 - the
09:45 - circumference
09:47 - is
09:48 - our variable circumference
09:52 - enter the radius of a circle
09:54 - I'll enter 10. actually 10.5
09:58 - their circumference is
10:00 - 65.97 if you want to round and truncate
10:03 - some of these numbers
10:05 - we can use the round function around
10:08 - circumference
10:09 - then round to a given decimal place I'll
10:11 - round to two digits
10:14 - again 10.5 rounded is
10:17 - 65.97 you could add a unit of
10:20 - measurement to let's say centimeters
10:22 - 10.5 is 65.97 centimeters all right that
10:27 - is the first exercise
10:30 - for this next exercise let's calculate
10:32 - the area of a circle we'll import the
10:35 - math module
10:37 - we'll ask for a radius much like before
10:40 - radius equals input
10:45 - enter the radius of a circle
10:50 - we'll cast our input as a floating Point
10:52 - number
10:55 - the equation for the area of a circle is
11:00 - pi
11:02 - times radius squared we could easily use
11:06 - the built-in power function to raise our
11:08 - radius to the power of 2.
11:11 - then we will display the area
11:13 - print I'm using an F string
11:16 - the area
11:18 - of the circle
11:21 - is
11:22 - our area to some unit of measurement
11:25 - let's say centimeters
11:27 - squared
11:30 - enter the radius of a circle 10.5
11:34 - the area of the circle is
11:37 - 346.36 but I would like to round this
11:39 - number to two decimal places
11:42 - I'll use that round function
11:45 - and I'll Place area
11:47 - and the number of digits to round two
11:48 - within this function let's try that
11:50 - again
11:51 - 10.5
11:53 - the area of the circle is
11:56 - 346.36 centimeters squared that is the
11:59 - second exercise
12:01 - for this last program we're going to
12:03 - find the hypotenuse of a right triangle
12:06 - the formula to calculate the hypotenuse
12:08 - of a right angled triangle is C equals
12:12 - the square root of a squared plus b
12:15 - squared we'll Begin by importing the
12:17 - math module
12:19 - we'll ask the user for the lengths of
12:21 - side A and B
12:23 - a equals
12:26 - input
12:28 - enter side a
12:32 - will cast the input as a floating Point
12:34 - number
12:37 - we'll do the same thing with side B
12:40 - equals
12:45 - enter side B
12:49 - now this part's going to be confusing
12:50 - we'll calculate C we'll need a squared
12:53 - plus b squared
12:55 - we'll take a to the power of 2
12:59 - Plus
13:01 - B to the power of 2.
13:04 - then we'll need the square root of all
13:06 - of this whatever the result is
13:08 - I will surround this equation with math
13:13 - dot square root
13:15 - and that should give us our answer
13:18 - let's print
13:21 - using an F string
13:23 - side C
13:26 - equals
13:27 - whatever C is
13:30 - so enter side a three side B will be
13:34 - four
13:35 - side C is five
13:37 - all right everybody so that was
13:38 - everything related to some arithmetic
13:40 - operators and math related functions in
13:43 - Python
13:44 - and in the next video we're going to
13:45 - cover a few things involving string
13:47 - formatting

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody in this video I'm going to show you all of the different math that we'll need throughout the rest of the series I have a lot to cover and I'll split this video into different sections we'll cover some basic arithmetic operators builtin math functions a few functions from the math module and then a few exercises be sure to look at the timestamps if you would like to skip ahead to another section let's begin with some really easy stuff we're going to cover some basic arithmetic operators let's say we have a variable friends currently you have zero friends if you need to increment a variable by one you could say friends the name of the variable equals the name of the variable again plus one so the plus sign is the addition operator and I think we do have a little bit of experience with that already so if I were to print my variable friends guess what you now have one friend we could also shorten this line of code you could say friends plus equals one that would do the same thing this is known as an augmented assignment operator that will give you the same result I prefer to use augmented assignment operators just because they take less text and I think they're easier to read now let's use subtraction friends equals friends minus two so of course minus is the subtraction operator you have negative two friends I guess if you were to use the augmented assignment operator that would be friends minus equals two there you still have negative two friends okay multiplication let's change friends to how about five friends equals friends times three you now have 15 friends then the augmented assignment operator version of this would be friends times equals three so again you have 15 friends let's cover division friends equals friends divided by two so we have 2.5 friends somebody was cut in half we have half a friend maybe it's just their legs or torso or something then the augmented assignment operator would be friends divided by equals two and the result is still the same now exponents friends equals friends to the power of two so friends is currently five friends to the power of two would be five times five which is 25. the augmented assignment operator version of this equation would be friends exponent equals two and again friends is 25. then we have modulus modulus gives you the remainder of any division suppose we have 10 friends instead of five I will assign a new variable remainder remainder equals friends the percent signed is known as the modulus operator it will give us the remainder of any Division if I were to divide my group of friends by three we will have one remaining I'll store the remainder within a separate variable we would have a remainder of one it's kind of like in class when the teacher says for everybody in the class to go into groups of three then there's always that one kid that's by themselves that's kind of the same concept we're dividing our friends into groups of three then the modulus will give you the remainder if we divided our group of friends into groups of two well ten divides by two evenly so there is no remainder so that is the modulus operator it's fairly popular to use this operator to find if a number is even or odd because it will divide by two evenly if that number is even if the remainder is 1 that means that the original number is odd okay so yeah those are some basic arithmetic operators addition subtraction multiplication division exponentiation then modulus now what we're going to do is cover some builtin math related functions suppose we have three variables x equals 3.14 y equals four Z equals five it doesn't matter if these are floating Point numbers or whole integers the first is the round function we have a variable named result I'm going to round X so there is a builtin round function after the set of parentheses we can add some value or variable to be rounded so we will round x to the nearest whole integer then print the result so our result is three so that's the round function with the absolute value function we can find the absolute value of a number let's change y to be negative four instead of four we'll take result equals ABS which means absolute value of y the absolute value is the distance away from zero as a whole number the absolute value of negative 4 is 4. let's change y back to four there's a builtin power function result equals pow then we'll need a base and an exponent what's y to the power of three that would be four times four times four which is 64. that's the power function you can raise the base to a given power the next two are really useful using the max function we can find the maximum value of various values what's the maximum value between X Y and Z then I'll just need to store this value result equals the max between X Y and Z well the maximum value is five otherwise there's min what's the minimum value between x y and z that would be 3.14 now in this next section we do have some very useful constants and functions from the math class but we'll need to import the math module at the top of our text editor so import math if you need the value of pi you'll type the name of the math module dot pi and I'm just going to print this print math dot pi the value of pi is 3.14159 and a bunch of digits that come after if you're working with physics I do know that people use the constant e a lot we won't be using e in this video series but if you ever need access to it just type math dot e and that will give you e which is 2.71 something something something I believe e is known as the exponential constant if you need the square root of a number let's say result equals math dot s q r t we can place a variable or a value within the square root function let's say we have X again x equals 9. what is the square root of x then I will print whatever the result is the square root of 9 is 3. that is the square root function there's a ceiling function result equals math dot seal seal will always round a floating Point number up suppose X is 9.1 so 9.1 rounded up is 10. otherwise there's floor which will always round a number down result equals math dot floor let's change X to 9.9 .9 rounded down is 9. those are some useful math functions let's go over some exercises okay this first exercise we are going to calculate the circumference of a circle we'll need the help of the math module because there's some good functions in there to calculate the circumference of a circle the formula is 2 times pi times R let's ask a user for a radius because that's what R is we'll accept

times whatever the radius is and the user is going to type that in then we will print whatever the circumference is print we'll use an upstring the circumference is our variable circumference enter the radius of a circle I'll enter 10. actually 10.5 their circumference is 65.97 if you want to round and truncate some of these numbers we can use the round function around circumference then round to a given decimal place I'll round to two digits again 10.5 rounded is 65.97 you could add a unit of measurement to let's say centimeters 10.5 is 65.97 centimeters all right that is the first exercise for this next exercise let's calculate the area of a circle we'll import the math module we'll ask for a radius much like before radius equals input enter the radius of a circle we'll cast our input as a floating Point number the equation for the area of a circle is pi times radius squared we could easily use the builtin power function to raise our radius to the power of 2. then we will display the area print I'm using an F string the area of the circle is our area to some unit of measurement let's say centimeters squared enter the radius of a circle 10.5 the area of the circle is 346.36 but I would like to round this number to two decimal places I'll use that round function and I'll Place area and the number of digits to round two within this function let's try that again 10.5 the area of the circle is 346.36 centimeters squared that is the second exercise for this last program we're going to find the hypotenuse of a right triangle the formula to calculate the hypotenuse of a right angled triangle is C equals the square root of a squared plus b squared we'll Begin by importing the math module we'll ask the user for the lengths of side A and B a equals input enter side a will cast the input as a floating Point number we'll do the same thing with side B equals enter side B now this part's going to be confusing we'll calculate C we'll need a squared plus b squared we'll take a to the power of 2 Plus B to the power of 2. then we'll need the square root of all of this whatever the result is I will surround this equation with math dot square root and that should give us our answer let's print using an F string side C equals whatever C is so enter side a three side B will be four side C is five all right everybody so that was everything related to some arithmetic operators and math related functions in Python and in the next video we're going to cover a few things involving string formatting
