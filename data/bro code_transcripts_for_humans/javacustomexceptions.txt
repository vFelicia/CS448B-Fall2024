00:00 - hey how's it going everybody it's bro
00:02 - here hope you're doing well and in this
00:03 - video I'm going to be teaching you guys
00:05 - how to create your own custom exceptions
00:08 - also known as user-defined exceptions
00:11 - there is a previous video called
00:13 - exception handling in this playlist so
00:15 - make sure you've seen that one before
00:17 - moving on to this video and at the end
00:19 - of this video we're going to be creating
00:20 - a project where we will verify
00:22 - somebody's edge for some sort of like
00:24 - fake membership and if they are under a
00:27 - certain age then what happens is that
00:29 - our custom exception will be thrown so
00:32 - that's it let's get started before you
00:37 - reach the end of this video make sure to
00:39 - LIKE comment and subscribe so that we
00:42 - together can challenge and defeat the
00:44 - mighty YouTube algorithm hey welcome
00:48 - back everyone so for this video I'm
00:50 - going to teach you guys how to create
00:51 - your own custom exceptions also known as
00:54 - user-defined exceptions so there's a
00:57 - video in this playlist called exception
00:59 - handling or something like that so you
01:02 - want to be sure to watch that before you
01:04 - watch in this video so just as a
01:06 - reminder an exception is an event after
01:09 - execution that disrupts the normal flow
01:12 - of a program so a few examples we've
01:14 - covered in the past where arithmetic
01:16 - exceptions if somebody divides by 0 for
01:19 - instance or an array index out of bounds
01:21 - exception and then file not found
01:24 - exception if we're working with files
01:26 - and we can't locate a file so we can
01:28 - create our own custom exceptions that
01:31 - can handle something very specific for
01:33 - our programs so a few ideas that I
01:35 - thought of where maybe like a duplicate
01:38 - email exception if somebody's signing up
01:40 - for an account and they're registering
01:42 - with an email and we do a database query
01:45 - and then that email already exists we
01:48 - can create a duplicate email exception
01:50 - to let the user know that that email
01:52 - already exists or maybe if somebody's
01:55 - paying with a credit card and they enter
01:57 - in invalid information we could create
01:59 - an exception called
02:00 - invalid credit exception I'm just making
02:03 - these names up by the way they're not
02:05 - actually exceptions but they're
02:07 - descriptive of what they can do and then
02:09 - one that we'll be working on for this
02:11 - project is age exception
02:14 - where maybe if somebody signing up for a
02:16 - membership or something online and if
02:18 - they're under a certain age we can throw
02:20 - a age exception and that'll let the user
02:23 - know that hey you're not old enough to
02:25 - sign up for this membership so that's
02:28 - just a few examples of custom exceptions
02:30 - that we can make there's all tons of
02:32 - different exceptions that you could do
02:34 - for very specific situations so let's
02:36 - get started what we're going to do is to
02:38 - create a new class so if you're using
02:40 - eclipse go to file new and then class
02:44 - and then we will call this the name of
02:47 - whatever exception we want so I'm just
02:49 - going to call this age exception and
02:52 - then we'll click finish now you're going
02:56 - to want your custom exception class to
02:59 - extends the exception class so this
03:04 - exception class is going to be the
03:06 - parent class for the child age exception
03:10 - or whatever else you called this class
03:11 - so we're going to set up the constructor
03:14 - for age exception so we're going to type
03:16 - in age exception parentheses and we're
03:21 - actually going to set up a parameter
03:22 - maybe a string and we'll call this
03:25 - message so if this exception is thrown
03:27 - we're actually going to display a
03:29 - message such as you're not old enough to
03:31 - sign up for this membership or something
03:34 - like that so within the constructor for
03:37 - your age exception class or whatever
03:39 - else you called this you're going to
03:42 - call the super constructor class so
03:46 - super and then we're going to send a
03:49 - message to here to actually take care of
03:51 - this message and that's it that's all we
03:53 - have to do for this class so just a
03:55 - quick summary of what we did here this
03:57 - age exception class if this exception is
04:00 - thrown we're going to pass a message
04:02 - that says something like you are not old
04:05 - enough to sign up and we're immediately
04:07 - going to take this message that's passed
04:09 - in and send it to the super constructor
04:11 - for the exception class and that's going
04:14 - to handle exceptions like it normally
04:16 - would so that's all that this class does
04:18 - we're going to do everything else within
04:19 - our main class then so let's accept some
04:23 - user input let's set up a scanner and
04:25 - we're going to ask the user
04:27 - for what their edges so we'll set up a
04:29 - scanner first we'll just say scanner and
04:31 - we'll call the skin equals new scanner
04:34 - system dot in and then we'll need to
04:38 - import something so make sure you have
04:42 - this import and then we'll create a
04:44 - prompt and we will have the user enter
04:48 - their edge so enter your edge and we'll
04:53 - place this within a variable and we'll
04:55 - call this edge so int age equals scan
05:00 - dot next int okay the next step we're
05:07 - actually going to create a method to
05:10 - check our edge so we'll call this method
05:13 - check edge and we're going to pass in
05:16 - the edge variable so with this check
05:21 - edge we're going to surround this with a
05:23 - try block and we're going to catch
05:29 - exception e and then we'll just print
05:38 - out a message so system dot out dot
05:41 - print line a problem occurred and then
05:50 - it's going to list what exception was
05:52 - thrown so we'll just say plus e which is
05:57 - the exception object now we need to
06:00 - create a method called check edge so it
06:02 - actually does something now outside of
06:04 - your main method we're going to create
06:06 - another method so this is going to be a
06:09 - static method it's void it won't return
06:12 - anything and it's called check edge and
06:15 - it's going to have one parameter set up
06:17 - it's going to accept an integer and
06:21 - we'll call it edge now we're going to
06:23 - have this method throws age exception
06:29 - and then we need a set of curly braces
06:32 - now with our check age method that
06:35 - throws age exception we're going to list
06:37 - the condition which will throw it new
06:41 - age exception so what we'll check is
06:43 - that if age is less than 18 then we're
06:47 - going to throw new age exception so if
06:51 - age is less than 18 what we're going to
06:56 - do is throw new than the name of the
07:00 - exception here so age exception in this
07:03 - case and then we'll pass in a message
07:06 - because we have it set up so this
07:09 - accepts a message as a parameter so
07:12 - maybe we'll add a new line character
07:15 - plus a message such as you must be 18 or
07:22 - older to sign up so if they're not less
07:30 - than 18 they're either 18 or greater
07:33 - than so maybe we'll put an else
07:34 - statement that says system dot out dot
07:39 - print line you are now signed up and
07:43 - that's it let's run this enter your age
07:47 - let's say that I'm 18 years old so
07:50 - that's the minimum requirement and it
07:52 - says you are now signed up so since we
07:55 - used this check edge method and our age
07:59 - was not less than 18 we used this else
08:02 - statement and no exception was thrown
08:05 - then now let's try it again so enter
08:08 - your age let's say that we're 12 years
08:09 - old trying to sign up and it says a
08:12 - problem occurred and it lists the
08:14 - exception that we have the age exception
08:16 - that we made and you can see that it
08:18 - occurs here it just does a print line of
08:21 - a problem occurred and it displays the
08:24 - exception object and here it throws the
08:28 - new age exception and it displays our
08:30 - custom message that we want to display
08:32 - to the user or it says you must be 18 or
08:35 - older to sign up so that's basically
08:37 - custom exceptions also known as
08:40 - user-defined exceptions so you'll create
08:43 - a custom exception for something
08:45 - specific in your own program and then
08:48 - you'll probably want to have a custom
08:50 - method that will throw that specific
08:53 - exception
08:54 - and within that your method that throws
08:56 - at that custom exception what you'll do
08:59 - is usually list some sort of criteria or
09:01 - condition where that exception is thrown
09:04 - or not thrown depending on how you want
09:07 - to write your program but yeah that's
09:09 - the basics of user-defined exceptions so
09:12 - if you would like a copy of all this
09:14 - code I'll post it in the comments down
09:16 - below and your assignment is to create a
09:18 - method that throws some sort of custom
09:21 - exception you made and then post it in
09:23 - the comments down below but yeah that's
09:25 - the basics of user-defined exceptions in
09:28 - Java hey you yeah I'm talking to you if
09:33 - you learn something new then you can
09:34 - help me help you in three easy steps

hey how's it going everybody it's bro here hope you're doing well and in this video I'm going to be teaching you guys how to create your own custom exceptions also known as userdefined exceptions there is a previous video called exception handling in this playlist so make sure you've seen that one before moving on to this video and at the end of this video we're going to be creating a project where we will verify somebody's edge for some sort of like fake membership and if they are under a certain age then what happens is that our custom exception will be thrown so that's it let's get started before you reach the end of this video make sure to LIKE comment and subscribe so that we together can challenge and defeat the mighty YouTube algorithm hey welcome back everyone so for this video I'm going to teach you guys how to create your own custom exceptions also known as userdefined exceptions so there's a video in this playlist called exception handling or something like that so you want to be sure to watch that before you watch in this video so just as a reminder an exception is an event after execution that disrupts the normal flow of a program so a few examples we've covered in the past where arithmetic exceptions if somebody divides by 0 for instance or an array index out of bounds exception and then file not found exception if we're working with files and we can't locate a file so we can create our own custom exceptions that can handle something very specific for our programs so a few ideas that I thought of where maybe like a duplicate email exception if somebody's signing up for an account and they're registering with an email and we do a database query and then that email already exists we can create a duplicate email exception to let the user know that that email already exists or maybe if somebody's paying with a credit card and they enter in invalid information we could create an exception called invalid credit exception I'm just making these names up by the way they're not actually exceptions but they're descriptive of what they can do and then one that we'll be working on for this project is age exception where maybe if somebody signing up for a membership or something online and if they're under a certain age we can throw a age exception and that'll let the user know that hey you're not old enough to sign up for this membership so

parameter so maybe we'll add a new line character plus a message such as you must be 18 or older to sign up so if they're not less than 18 they're either 18 or greater than so maybe we'll put an else statement that says system dot out dot print line you are now signed up and that's it let's run this enter your age let's say that I'm 18 years old so that's the minimum requirement and it says you are now signed up so since we used this check edge method and our age was not less than 18 we used this else statement and no exception was thrown then now let's try it again so enter your age let's say that we're 12 years old trying to sign up and it says a problem occurred and it lists the exception that we have the age exception that we made and you can see that it occurs here it just does a
