00:01 - hey everybody we're talking about method
00:03 - chaining method chaining is a
00:05 - programming technique where you call one
00:07 - method after another in one continuous
00:10 - line of code here's an example of where
00:12 - it could be useful let's say we have a
00:14 - username
00:16 - and assign this whatever your first name
00:18 - is but i'm going to make this all
00:20 - lowercase in this example what i would
00:22 - like to do is take the first character
00:24 - of the string and make it uppercase
00:27 - without using method chaining we could
00:29 - do something like this
00:30 - we'll create a temporary variable to
00:32 - store a letter and i will return the
00:35 - first letter in the string
00:38 - user name dot and i will use the char at
00:42 - method
00:43 - and the first letter has an index of
00:45 - zero letter is now b but now i would
00:48 - like to make it uppercase i will need to
00:50 - reassign my letter variable equals
00:53 - letter dot
00:55 - to
00:56 - uppercase
00:58 - and then we can display this
01:02 - console.log letter this should display
01:05 - the letter capital b to write this code
01:08 - a little more elegantly we could use
01:10 - method chaining after calling one method
01:12 - we can call subsequent methods i'll
01:15 - eliminate this line and follow the char
01:18 - at method with
01:20 - 2
01:21 - uppercase
01:23 - then add that set of parentheses this
01:25 - single line of code will do the exact
01:27 - same thing and it's easier to read and
01:29 - understand you can follow one method
01:32 - call it with another if i would like to
01:34 - invoke another method i don't know like
01:36 - trim i could just add that to the end
01:38 - you have the capability of calling one
01:40 - method after another in one continuous
01:43 - line of code it makes your code cleaner
01:45 - and more readable so yeah that's method
01:47 - chaining if you found this video helpful
