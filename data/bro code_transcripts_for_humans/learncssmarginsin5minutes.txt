00:00 - hey how's it going people today I'm
00:01 - going to explain margins in CSS margins
00:05 - are the space around an element I'll
00:07 - create an H1 element type in your name
00:11 - or something that's kind of short and
00:13 - we'll need a paragraph I'll generate
00:15 - some text by typing lorem then hitting
00:17 - tab let me just zoom in a little bit to
00:20 - give you a diagram of margins I'm going
00:22 - to right click our H1 element and go to
00:25 - inspect at the bottom of my elements
00:28 - window we have this diagram it kind of
00:30 - resembles an onion because it has layers
00:32 - we have the element itself and its
00:34 - Dimensions padding border then margins
00:38 - padding is between the element itself
00:40 - and any borders margins are the area
00:44 - outside of any borders today we'll be
00:46 - working with margins the area outside of
00:48 - any elements let's close this window
00:51 - naturally there's a few pixels of margin
00:54 - around our body the letters in our H1
00:56 - element and our paragraph aren't
00:58 - directly next to the border of our
01:00 - window
01:01 - so we can eliminate that
01:03 - we will select the body element within
01:06 - our CSS style sheet we will set the
01:08 - margin to be 0 pixels
01:11 - so now the letters are directly next to
01:14 - the edge of the web browser
01:16 - and if I were to expand this you can
01:18 - kind of see that
01:19 - so that's all that margin is it's the
01:21 - area outside of an element to give you
01:24 - another example let's delete our H1
01:26 - element along with our paragraph we'll
01:28 - create two div boxes
01:31 - we need two pairs of developments
01:38 - I'll create a class for each of these
01:39 - divs class
01:41 - box
01:44 - then they will each have a unique id id
01:47 - equals box one the ID for the second box
01:51 - will be box two
01:53 - and then I'll give each of these some
01:55 - text
01:57 - box one
01:59 - box two
02:02 - all right now let's style these boxes
02:05 - so after our body element let's select
02:08 - the Box class anything that's a box
02:12 - let's add a border
02:15 - 5 pixel solid is fine
02:19 - I'll change the font size to be
02:23 - 5 em
02:27 - with
02:28 - 250 pixels
02:31 - height
02:32 - 250 pixels and I'm just gonna zoom out a
02:36 - little bit until our view is at 100 let
02:40 - me color box one in box two
02:42 - we are selecting the ID of box one
02:45 - for the background color
02:48 - let's set that to be red
02:50 - but let's select a more custom red
02:52 - because it's cool
02:54 - all right then box two will be blue
03:01 - all right there are marginal directions
03:03 - we can apply margin to the top of an
03:06 - element the right the bottom or the left
03:09 - or all sides with box one I will set the
03:12 - margin top property to be 50 pixels
03:17 - that's going to add 50 pixels of margin
03:19 - at the top of this element box one
03:23 - there's also margin bottom now there's
03:27 - 50 pixels a margin after box one
03:30 - margin left
03:32 - the margins now on the left
03:34 - margin right
03:37 - the margins now on the right but you
03:39 - can't see that because divs are Block
03:41 - Level elements they take up the entire
03:43 - horizontal space
03:44 - you could apply margin to all sides
03:46 - evenly just with margin so margin 50
03:49 - pixels
03:50 - that applies 50 pixels of margin to the
03:53 - top right bottom left
03:55 - so if we were to apply this margin to a
03:58 - class like the Box class both box 1 and
04:01 - box 2 will have 50 pixels of margin
04:03 - around each element
04:05 - there's also margin Auto
04:08 - it is possible to set an element's
04:10 - margin to take up the entire space I can
04:13 - take any of these elements such as box
04:15 - one and push it all the way to the right
04:17 - of my web browser using margin left
04:20 - margin Dash left then I will set it to
04:24 - be Auto
04:25 - the margin on the left side of box 1
04:27 - will take up as much room as possible
04:30 - so box one is going to stick to the
04:32 - right hand side of the web browser
04:34 - margin right won't appear to do anything
04:39 - because it's already left Justified
04:41 - now if you would like an element to stay
04:43 - in the center of your web browser
04:45 - you can just set margin to be Auto
04:48 - so box one is going to stay in the
04:50 - middle of my web page
04:52 - if I were to apply this property to the
04:54 - Box class that will affect Box 2 as well
04:58 - so now box 1 and box 2 should stay in
05:00 - the middle of my web browser alright
05:02 - everybody so those are margins in simple
05:05 - terms it's the space around an element
05:07 - and that is an introduction to margins
05:10 - in CSS
