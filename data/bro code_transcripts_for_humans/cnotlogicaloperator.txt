00:02 - hey yeah let's discuss the notch logical
00:04 - operator which is represented by an
00:06 - exclamation point its purpose is to
00:08 - reverse the state of a condition let's
00:10 - write a small program let's say that we
00:12 - have a boolean variable named sunny and
00:14 - this will be either true or false let's
00:16 - say it's true to begin with so to work
00:18 - with boolean variables include this
00:20 - header file at the top and we will write
00:22 - an if-else statement to check to see if
00:24 - it's sunny outside and print a custom
00:26 - message
00:28 - so if sunny is equal to true
00:31 - then we will print
00:35 - it's sunny outside else it must be
00:38 - cloudy outside
00:40 - so this does work it's sunny outside
00:43 - another way of writing this is that we
00:44 - could say sunny is equal to one because
00:47 - true represents one false represents
00:49 - zero this would also work or you could
00:52 - just say sunny this would work as well
00:55 - so by using the not logical operator
00:58 - this will reverse the state of condition
01:00 - by using the not logical operator we're
01:02 - checking to see if something is not true
01:05 - so if i try this again
01:07 - this program states it's cloudy outside
01:10 - so i think it would be better if we were
01:12 - to switch these print statements around
01:15 - now what we're checking is if it's not
01:17 - sunny if it's not sunny then we will
01:19 - print it's cloudy outside
01:22 - else it's sunny outside
01:24 - it is sunny outside and if i change this
01:26 - to be false
01:28 - well then
01:29 - it's cloudy outside so yeah that's the
01:32 - not logical operator you can just
01:34 - precede a condition or a boolean
01:36 - variable with the not logical operator
01:39 - and that gives you a few more options in
01:41 - the way in which you can write a program
01:43 - so yeah that is the not logical operator
