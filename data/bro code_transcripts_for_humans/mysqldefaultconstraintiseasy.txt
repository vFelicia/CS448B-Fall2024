00:00 - hey everybody in this topic I'm going to
00:02 - explain the default constraint when
00:04 - inserting a new row if we do not specify
00:07 - a value for a column by default we can
00:10 - add some value that we set here's an
00:12 - example let's select all from our
00:14 - products table select all from products
00:19 - in an earlier example we have a table of
00:22 - products a few items on the menu for
00:24 - sale are hamburgers fries soda and ice
00:26 - cream let's add a few items on the menu
00:28 - that would be free this could include
00:30 - napkins straws forks and spoons
00:33 - something you would commonly see at a
00:35 - fast food restaurant if we're not using
00:37 - the default constraint we would have to
00:39 - enter in those prices manually
00:41 - so let's insert into our table products
00:46 - R values
00:48 - product ID 104 will be
00:52 - a straw
00:54 - the price will be zero dollars and zero
00:57 - cents
00:58 - let's do this all together
01:03 - we have 105.
01:05 - 106
01:07 - 107.
01:09 - product number 105 will be a napkin
01:16 - the napkin is zero dollar zero cents
01:19 - 106 is a plastic fork
01:23 - again zero dollars and zero cents
01:27 - 107 is a plastic spoon
01:32 - the price is zero dollars and zero cents
01:36 - then I will select all from my products
01:39 - table
01:42 - here's our new products table we have
01:44 - our four items that actually cost
01:46 - something then our free items which are
01:49 - included with whatever we buy in place
01:51 - of explicitly stating a price one way in
01:54 - which we can make our lives easier if
01:56 - we're adding a bunch of free items to
01:58 - the menu we could set a default
02:00 - constraint where if we don't explicitly
02:03 - set a price the price will default to be
02:06 - zero it will be free so I'm going to
02:08 - undo everything that we just did
02:11 - delete from products
02:15 - where product ID is greater than or
02:19 - equal to 104.
02:22 - and then we can execute that statement
02:26 - if we were recreating this table with
02:28 - the default constraint we would type
02:30 - create table the name of the table
02:33 - products in this case
02:35 - add our columns we have a product ID
02:40 - the data type is integer
02:43 - we have a product
02:45 - name
02:47 - the data type is VAR Char and I forgot
02:49 - what the size was
02:51 - looks like 25.
02:55 - than a price
02:58 - which is a decimal
03:00 - Max digit size of four Precision of two
03:03 - now let's use the default constraint
03:05 - after the column you would like to add
03:07 - that constraint to type default then
03:10 - some value I will set the default value
03:13 - to be zero dollars and zero cents or you
03:15 - could just say zero too that'd be fine
03:17 - you would just add this constraint when
03:19 - creating a new table however I do
03:21 - already have a products table so this
03:23 - technically wouldn't work because that
03:25 - table already exists now to alter a
03:28 - table to include that constraint you
03:30 - would instead type alter table the name
03:33 - of the table
03:36 - alter the name of the column price
03:39 - set
03:40 - default constraint then the value so
03:43 - zero
03:46 - and that appears to have worked let's
03:48 - select our products table select all
03:50 - from
03:51 - products
03:54 - then we will insert some new rows
03:58 - insert
03:59 - into
04:01 - products
04:04 - than our values
04:06 - so we had four rows
04:14 - 104.
04:16 - that was a straw
04:19 - 105 was a napkin
04:24 - 106.
04:26 - was a fork
04:29 - 107.
04:31 - is a spoon then finished the statement
04:34 - with a semicolon so since we set that
04:37 - default constraint we don't need to
04:38 - explicitly list the price but we are
04:41 - missing one thing though
04:42 - when I execute this statement the column
04:45 - count doesn't match
04:47 - so when we insert into products
04:49 - we will list what we're inserting
04:51 - explicitly the product ID
04:54 - and the product name after our table
04:56 - name within parentheses type
04:59 - product ID then product name now this
05:04 - should work
05:06 - yeah and here's our products table with
05:08 - our four inserts all of the prices were
05:11 - set to zero and we did not need to
05:13 - explicitly state that this time if you
05:16 - don't specify a value you'll use
05:18 - whatever the default is
05:19 - here's another example I think you'll
05:21 - like this one let's say we have a table
05:23 - of transactions after inserting a new
05:25 - transaction we will insert a timestamp
05:28 - of when that transaction took place and
05:30 - that time stamp will be the default
05:32 - create table transactions
05:37 - at the end of this topic we will delete
05:39 - this table so don't get too attached to
05:41 - it
05:42 - we will have three columns
05:45 - transaction
05:47 - ID which will be of the data type
05:50 - integer
05:51 - a transaction amount let's just say
05:53 - amount
05:55 - the data type will be decimal
05:58 - five digits Precision of two is good
06:02 - then a transaction
06:05 - date
06:06 - the data type will be date actually
06:09 - let's make this date time I'd like to
06:11 - include the time of when this
06:12 - transaction happened now for the default
06:15 - constraint after the date time let's add
06:17 - default then the Now function we don't
06:21 - need to explicitly add the date and time
06:23 - that will be done automatically which is
06:26 - kind of cool
06:27 - so I'm going to create this table
06:31 - let's select all from transactions
06:36 - if we're going to insert some values
06:38 - we'll need at least a transaction ID and
06:40 - amount the transaction date will be
06:42 - included automatically
06:45 - so let's insert
06:47 - into
06:49 - transactions
06:52 - some values let's do one at a time
06:55 - the first transaction of the day will
06:57 - have a transaction ID of 1 I suppose a
07:00 - customer came in and bought a hamburger
07:02 - and a soda for a total of 4.99
07:05 - then we do need to list the transaction
07:08 - ID then the amount
07:10 - after our table name add transaction ID
07:15 - then amount
07:17 - so let's run this
07:19 - yeah cool so there's our transaction ID
07:21 - this was order number one the total
07:24 - amount was 4.99 and we do have a time
07:27 - stamp of when this transaction occurred
07:30 - so the second order of the day
07:32 - will be for a total of 2.89 and that
07:36 - happened at this time then the third
07:38 - order of the day
07:40 - will have a total price of eight dollars
07:43 - 37 cents
07:45 - yep there we are so we don't need this
07:48 - table anymore I'm going to drop table
07:51 - transactions we will recreate this table
07:54 - in the future but I'd rather start fresh
07:57 - all right everybody that is the default
07:59 - constraint when you create a table or
08:02 - alter a table you can set a default
08:04 - value of some value you specify then
08:07 - whenever you insert a row that value
08:09 - will be included automatically which is
08:12 - pretty useful but yeah that is the
08:14 - default constraint in MySQL

and that appears to have worked let's select our products table select all from products then we will insert some new rows insert into products than our values so we had four rows 104. that was a
