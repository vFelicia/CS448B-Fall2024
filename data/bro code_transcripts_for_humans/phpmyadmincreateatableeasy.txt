00:00 - all right everybody so in today's video
00:02 - I'm going to explain how we can create a
00:05 - table using
00:06 - phpmyadmin there's two ways to get here
00:09 - you can either go to your zamp control
00:11 - panel then press this admin button next
00:13 - to mySQL or you can head to this URL to
00:16 - create a table let's go to our databases
00:18 - we should have a database already
00:20 - created in the last video we created a
00:23 - database named businessdb so let's click
00:26 - on it
00:27 - let's begin by creating a table name
00:29 - I'll create a table of users these will
00:32 - be registered users
00:34 - then set the number of columns I'll
00:36 - stick with four
00:37 - then we will hit the create button
00:41 - in this column we will set the name of
00:43 - each column our first column will be for
00:46 - user IDs let's name this column ID we
00:50 - will set the data type to be int
00:53 - we won't specify a length
00:55 - if you would like a default value you
00:58 - can set that here we're going to use the
01:00 - ID field to be set to Auto increment you
01:03 - can set the characters but we will keep
01:05 - that as the default like for some reason
01:07 - if you need I don't know Greek you can
01:09 - use Greek but let's just use the default
01:11 - to add an index you can do that here we
01:15 - will set our ID to be our primary index
01:20 - then I will click the Go Button to
01:23 - enable auto increment on a column you
01:25 - can check the AI button it's for auto
01:27 - increment that should be it for this
01:30 - column let's create a column for
01:32 - usernames
01:33 - the column name will be user
01:35 - for the data type let's say varchar then
01:39 - set a Max size I think 25 is good
01:43 - for our users let's have each user be
01:46 - unique
01:47 - then press go
01:49 - then let's move on to the next column
01:51 - this will be for passwords
01:53 - for the data type let's set that to be
01:56 - char
01:57 - which is right here
01:59 - I recommend hashing passwords in our
02:02 - database we won't be storing plain text
02:04 - passwords in case you know we get hacked
02:06 - or in case somebody uses SQL injection
02:08 - we'll be storing a hash of a password
02:11 - I'll set the size to be 255. encrypting
02:14 - and hashing algorithms are always
02:16 - changing and updating let's future proof
02:18 - our password field just by setting it to
02:20 - something large then let's add a
02:23 - registration date maybe we'll name the
02:25 - column
02:26 - register underscore date
02:30 - let's select not just date but date time
02:34 - I want to know the time that they
02:35 - register
02:37 - for the default let's use a current
02:39 - timestamp
02:40 - that should be good for our table if you
02:42 - would like some SQL code you can preview
02:44 - the SQL
02:47 - this is what we would be writing
02:50 - but we're going to be doing this
02:51 - automatically with phpmyadmin so let's
02:53 - save
02:55 - and we now have our table
02:57 - if I were to go to browse this is our
02:59 - table but there's currently no rows
03:01 - we'll be adding some rows with PHP but
03:04 - for testing purposes let's insert one
03:07 - manually using phpmyadmin
03:09 - so we will insert some test values with
03:12 - our ID it's set to Auto increment we
03:14 - don't necessarily need to put in a value
03:16 - for the user let's say the user is
03:18 - SpongeBob
03:20 - and for the password his password will
03:22 - be pineapple one you can also encrypt
03:25 - this password using password hash we'll
03:28 - cover hashing passwords in the next
03:30 - video with our registration date this is
03:32 - set to a current timestamp so that's
03:34 - going to be done automatically
03:36 - let's press go
03:39 - this would be the SQL query but yeah one
03:43 - row has been inserted let's go back to
03:45 - our table
03:47 - the username is SpongeBob password is
03:50 - pineapple1 and here is the registration
03:52 - date well date and time
03:55 - then to delete a row you can click this
03:57 - delete button then press ok
04:00 - and that is how to create a table in
04:02 - phpmyadmin and in the next topic we will
04:05 - be inserting some rows into our table
04:07 - using PHP
