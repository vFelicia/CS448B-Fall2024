With timestamps:

00:02 - all right what's going on people so in
00:04 - this video i'm going to show you how we
00:05 - can swap the values of two variables now
00:08 - you may be wondering why the heck do we
00:09 - need to know this so swapping variables
00:11 - is actually very common within sorting
00:14 - algorithms and when we reach the next
00:16 - topic on sorting arrays we'll need to
00:18 - learn how to do this so let's begin i
00:20 - have two variables x and y x contains
00:23 - the letter x y contains the letter y and
00:26 - let's print these values i'll use a
00:27 - printf statement let's display x
00:33 - and y
00:37 - x equals x y equals y so how can we swap
00:41 - these let's try x equals y and see what
00:44 - happens within both x and y the value is
00:46 - y what about y equals x
00:50 - well then both variables contain the
00:52 - character x so what can we do it seems
00:54 - like we're stuck what we could do is
00:56 - that we could introduce a third variable
00:59 - let's say char and let's name this temp
01:01 - because it's a temporary variable so we
01:03 - have a third variable to work with as
01:06 - temporary storage for some value so
01:08 - let's assign
01:10 - temp is equal to x
01:13 - and then we will assign
01:15 - x equals y
01:17 - and then lastly y equals temp
01:20 - and this should work let's try it
01:23 - yep x equals y and y equals x
01:26 - now this is a little bit different if
01:28 - you're working with strings so let's say
01:30 - these are character arrays
01:33 - and we'll pretend that these are maybe
01:35 - glasses holding some fluid x contains
01:38 - water and y contains maybe lemonade
01:43 - and let's make temp a character array as
01:45 - well but we need to declare a size let's
01:47 - say 15. okay so this isn't gonna work
01:50 - we're already receiving problems
01:52 - expression must be a modifiable l value
01:55 - so when working with arrays it's not
01:57 - enough to simply assign values
02:00 - we could use the string copy function
02:03 - so let's get rid of these and we will
02:05 - use string copy oh also make sure that
02:08 - you include this header file okay so we
02:11 - will copy the contents
02:13 - of x
02:14 - over to temp
02:16 - and it's the same procedure as before
02:18 - string
02:20 - copy y
02:22 - over to x
02:24 - and string
02:26 - copy
02:29 - temp over to y
02:31 - and then make sure you change these
02:32 - format specifiers to strings
02:35 - did contain water now it contains
02:37 - lemonade y did contain lemonade and now
02:39 - it contains water
02:41 - when swapping variables i like to
02:42 - imagine my variables as glasses and they
02:45 - contain some fluid if we pour the
02:47 - contents of one glass into the other
02:50 - well then the contents will be pushed
02:52 - out and overflow so it would be wise of
02:54 - us to introduce a third glass that's
02:56 - empty to hold one of these fluids so
02:59 - then we can pour the contents of one
03:00 - variable into the other now here's one
03:03 - issue that you may run into when using
03:05 - the string copy function if the length
03:08 - of the second argument is less than the
03:10 - first argument this can lead to
03:12 - unexpected behavior i'm going to replace
03:14 - lemonade with soda and let's see what
03:17 - happens so x doesn't contain anything
03:19 - but y contains water one solution is
03:22 - that we can make these character arrays
03:24 - the same size
03:25 - let's say that they're both 15
03:28 - and that should solve that issue so
03:29 - that's something you may need to take
03:30 - into consideration when using the string
03:32 - copy function if you're going to swap
03:34 - strings so yeah everybody that's how to
03:37 - swap the values of two variables if you
03:40 - would like a copy of this code i'll post
03:41 - this to the comment section down below
03:43 - and in the next video i'm going to show
03:45 - you how we can sort the elements within
03:46 - an array and well yeah that's how to
03:48 - swap the values of two variables in c
