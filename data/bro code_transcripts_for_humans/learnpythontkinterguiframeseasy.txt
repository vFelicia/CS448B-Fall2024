00:00 - what's going on everybody it's bro here
00:02 - hope you're doing well and in this video
00:03 - i'm going to teach you guys how
00:05 - frames work in python so sit back relax
00:08 - and enjoy the show
00:11 - if you find this video helpful please
00:13 - remember to like
00:14 - comment and subscribe your support will
00:16 - help keep this channel running
00:18 - what's going on people we're going to be
00:20 - discussing frames today
00:22 - a frame is really just a rectangular
00:25 - container to group and hold widgets
00:26 - together
00:27 - so we're going to practice using frames
00:29 - today but first we'll need a window
00:31 - we're going to create a frame and add a
00:33 - frame to the window
00:35 - so window equals tk followed by
00:38 - window.main loop
00:40 - well we're going to need some widgets to
00:42 - add to our frame
00:43 - so let's create a bunch of buttons
00:46 - because why not
00:47 - so i'm going to show you guys a shortcut
00:49 - too so let's say
00:51 - button equals button
00:54 - and then for now we're going to add this
00:57 - to our window but we're going to replace
00:58 - this eventually
00:59 - with frame when we create this and i'm
01:02 - just going to set the text
01:04 - to equal let's say w
01:07 - we're going to have four different
01:08 - buttons wasd
01:10 - like the buttons on the keyboard if
01:12 - you're playing a game and you want to
01:13 - move forward
01:14 - left back or right so we're adding this
01:17 - to the window
01:18 - for now let's set the text to w
01:22 - and what else can we do uh let's change
01:24 - the font so font
01:25 - equals i'll pick the font consoles
01:29 - because
01:30 - that tends to be even with buttons
01:34 - the size of the button adjusts to the
01:37 - size of the
01:38 - letter that you're using or the size of
01:40 - the text
01:42 - so let's set this to 25 and then
01:46 - a width so maybe width equals
01:49 - three all right and then button.pack
01:54 - and i just want to take a look at this
01:58 - so here's our button w so i'd like to
02:01 - show you guys a
02:01 - shortcut if you don't plan on using this
02:05 - button by name
02:06 - you don't really need to give it a name
02:07 - you can just say button
02:09 - and then have all your uh options here
02:13 - and then instead of having button.pack
02:15 - just add
02:16 - dot pack to the end so this will do the
02:18 - same thing
02:19 - however you can't adjust this button by
02:22 - its name though because it doesn't have
02:23 - a name anymore
02:24 - so let's create a few other buttons one
02:27 - for a
02:28 - s and d so we have w
02:31 - a s d
02:37 - and by default they're all top and
02:39 - center
02:40 - so with pack we can actually put these
02:43 - on a certain side
02:44 - so let's say we want uh w on the top
02:48 - and then the other three will be all
02:51 - left so side equals left and then after
02:55 - i show this to you
02:56 - you'll see the benefits of using a frame
03:00 - all right so right now they're all at
03:02 - least it appears that they're all within
03:03 - a container
03:04 - so what if i were to expand this well w
03:07 - is just drifting off
03:08 - it's sailing away by w so what if we
03:12 - could put these within
03:13 - a frame or container to actually contain
03:16 - all of these widgets well we can so
03:18 - let's create a frame
03:20 - frame equals frame
03:25 - and instead of adding these buttons to
03:27 - the window we're going to add
03:29 - these buttons to our frame
03:36 - and now we need to add the frame to the
03:38 - window
03:41 - and this is what this looks like however
03:43 - we need to
03:44 - actually add this by using pack or place
03:47 - so frame
03:48 - dot pack so now what this looks like
03:52 - is that all of these buttons all of
03:54 - these widgets are now contained within a
03:56 - frame
03:57 - a container let's change the background
04:00 - color of this frame just so that we can
04:01 - see
04:02 - the width and the height of this frame
04:05 - so
04:05 - when you create your frame there is an
04:08 - option for background color it's just bg
04:11 - and let's set this to a color we haven't
04:13 - done pink yet
04:14 - pink is a very masculine color so now
04:17 - the background of our frame is pink and
04:20 - that might be a better visual cue
04:23 - to the balance of the frame let's also
04:26 - give this frame a border
04:27 - so let's set a width of 5 using
04:30 - bd and then the type of border that we
04:34 - want
04:34 - and we can specify that with relief so
04:37 - relief
04:37 - equals let's say raised so this will
04:40 - have a
04:41 - 3d pop effect kind of like that let's
04:44 - try sunken there's a few other ones as
04:46 - well but i don't feel like it's
04:47 - necessary to
04:48 - go over all the border types let's stick
04:51 - with sunken for now
04:52 - that'll work alright so with this frame
04:56 - we are currently packing this we can set
04:58 - this on
04:59 - a certain side within our window so
05:01 - currently
05:02 - it's at the top let's set this to maybe
05:04 - the bottom so side
05:05 - equals bottom
05:09 - now this frame is sticking to the bottom
05:12 - of the window
05:13 - and it still contains all of the buttons
05:15 - all of the widgets
05:16 - that we added another function available
05:18 - to you is the place function
05:21 - we can place this frame at certain
05:23 - coordinates within our window
05:25 - so let's set x to equal zero and y to
05:29 - equal zero
05:30 - so then when we place this frame within
05:33 - our window and set some coordinates
05:35 - this entire frame is going to stick at
05:38 - these coordinates even if we were to
05:41 - resize this window and we can change
05:43 - these too let's say
05:44 - x is now 100 and y is also 100
05:50 - so the frame along with all of the
05:52 - components all of the widgets that it
05:54 - contains
05:55 - are sticking within the container and
05:57 - they move along with this
05:59 - so that's the basics of frames it's
06:01 - really just a rectangular container to
06:04 - group and hold widgets together
06:06 - so if you want a copy of all this code
06:08 - i'll post all of this in the comments
06:09 - down below
06:10 - and well yeah that's how frames work in
06:13 - python
06:14 - hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you
06:17 - learn something new
06:18 - then you can help me help you in three
06:21 - easy steps
06:22 - by smashing that like button drop a
06:25 - comment down below
06:26 - and subscribe if you'd like to become a
06:28 - fellow bro
