00:00 - what's up everybody so in today's video
00:02 - I'm going to explain date objects in
00:04 - JavaScript date objects are objects that
00:07 - contain values that represent dates and
00:09 - times these date objects can be changed
00:12 - and formatted to suit our needs here's
00:14 - an example we will create a date object
00:17 - that contains the current date and time
00:20 - to do so let's create a constant named
00:22 - date date will be an object we will call
00:25 - the date Constructor with the new
00:27 - keyword date then C in no arguments for
00:31 - the current date and time so I'm going
00:33 - to
00:35 - console.log my date object which gives
00:38 - me my current date and time as of right
00:41 - now I'm filming this video on a Thursday
00:43 - November 9th the year 2023 at about 7:
00:47 - in the morning so depending on when
00:49 - you're watching this video the date and
00:51 - time is going to be different if you
00:53 - would like to create your own custom
00:54 - date and time object you'll have to pass
00:56 - in some arguments you can follow this
00:58 - order for the date Constructor
01:00 - the first argument corresponds to a year
01:03 - then month day hour minute second and
01:06 - milliseconds even so for the year let's
01:08 - say
01:09 - 2024 the month zero corresponds to
01:13 - January one is February then that means
01:16 - a month of 11 is December let's say
01:19 - January so that will be zero for the day
01:22 - one for the 1 for the hour uh 2 2 in the
01:26 - morning this isn't military time by the
01:28 - way for the minute 3 minutes after the
01:30 - hour for the seconds 4 seconds after the
01:34 - minute we can even add milliseconds if
01:36 - we would like so for the milliseconds
01:38 - let's say five and here's my new date
01:41 - object Monday January 1st 2024 about 2:
01:45 - in the morning passing in a string
01:48 - representation of time to the date
01:49 - Constructor is also valid let's say the
01:52 - year is
01:53 - 2024 January 2nd for the time you're
01:56 - going to type t for
01:58 - time 12 12 noon then add Z for UTC time
02:04 - and there's my new date again Tuesday
02:06 - January 2nd 2024 6:00 in the morning
02:10 - another format you can use is within the
02:12 - date Constructor pass in a given amount
02:14 - of time in Mill seconds since epic if I
02:17 - could describe epic I would describe it
02:19 - as when the date your computer thinks
02:21 - time began if you were to pass in zero
02:23 - to the date Constructor you'll be given
02:26 - a date and time around December 31st 196
02:29 - 9 So within the DAT Constructor you can
02:32 - pass in a given amount of milliseconds
02:35 - since this date so if I was to pass in
02:38 - 1.7 billion
02:45 - milliseconds what I'm telling the day
02:47 - Constructor is give me the date and time
02:50 - that's 1.7 billion milliseconds since
02:53 - that epic date when I pass in 1.7
02:57 - billion milliseconds the date that I'm
02:59 - given is Tuesday November 14th 2023
03:03 - about 400 p.m. passing in milliseconds
03:05 - would be good for some sort of timer now
03:08 - let's use the current date and time I
03:10 - will pass in no arguments you can
03:12 - extract individual values from a date
03:14 - object I would like the year const year
03:18 - equals take our date object I will use
03:21 - the get full year method to get the year
03:25 - then I will
03:28 - console.log the year and this will be a
03:30 - number
03:32 - 2023 let's get the
03:35 - month const month equals our date object
03:40 - use the built-in get month method then I
03:44 - will
03:45 - console.log the
03:47 - month currently for me it's November not
03:50 - October so remember January is zero
03:53 - December is 11 let's get the day const
03:59 - day equals date get date not day if you
04:04 - get the day that will give you the day
04:06 - of the week like Sunday Monday Tuesday
04:08 - that sort of thing let's
04:11 - console.log the
04:13 - day so for me it's the
04:15 - 9th let's get the hour const hour equals
04:21 - date get hours
04:24 - plural
04:26 - console.log the
04:28 - hour for me at 7:00 in the
04:31 - morning let's get
04:33 - minutes const minutes equals get
04:40 - minutes console.log the
04:44 - minutes it is 7:45 in the
04:48 - morning get
04:53 - seconds get
04:58 - seconds
05:00 - console.log the
05:02 - seconds so
05:04 - 745 21 seconds after the minute now if
05:08 - you need the day of the week here's what
05:10 - you can do const day of week equals date
05:16 - get day that will give you the day of
05:19 - the
05:20 - week
05:22 - console.log day of week for me that is
05:25 - for Sunday is zero Monday is one so that
05:29 - means it is Thursday now with a date
05:32 - object you can even set the date with a
05:34 - method let's
05:37 - console.log the
05:41 - date I'm going to set the Year date set
05:46 - full year I will set the year to be
05:50 - 2024 yep Saturday November 9th
05:53 - 2024 let's set the
05:56 - month set month
06:00 - I will set the month to be January so I
06:02 - will pass in zero Tuesday January 9th
06:07 - let's set the
06:09 - day that would be with set date not day
06:13 - I will set it to be the 1 January
06:17 - 1 the hours with set
06:20 - hours let's go with two for 2: in the
06:24 - morning set
06:27 - minutes 3 minutes P the
06:31 - hour set
06:35 - seconds 4 seconds past the minute you
06:39 - can even compare dates as well let's
06:42 - create two date objects const date one
06:45 - equals a new date I'll pass in a string
06:48 - representation of a date we won't
06:50 - include the time though for the year
06:52 - let's say
06:54 - 2023 December that would be 12 31st New
06:58 - Year's Eve basically
07:00 - and for date
07:02 - 2 let's say date 2 is New Year's Day
07:06 - 2024 January
07:10 - 1st using an if statement let's compare
07:13 - to see if date 2 is greater than date
07:19 - 1 if it is then let's
07:23 - console.log happy New
07:26 - Year so date 2 is greater than date 1
07:30 - will print happy New Year let's change
07:33 - date two to be
07:35 - 2023 December
07:38 - 30th well nothing happens then but
07:41 - that's to be
07:42 - expected all right everybody so those
07:44 - are date objects they're objects that
07:47 - contain values that represent dates and
07:49 - times these date objects can be changed
07:51 - and formatted to suit our needs and well
07:54 - everybody those are date objects in
07:58 - JavaScript

Cleaned transcript:

what's up everybody so in today's video I'm going to explain date objects in JavaScript date objects are objects that contain values that represent dates and times these date objects can be changed and formatted to suit our needs here's an example we will create a date object that contains the current date and time to do so let's create a constant named date date will be an object we will call the date Constructor with the new keyword date then C in no arguments for the current date and time so I'm going to console.log my date object which gives me my current date and time as of right now I'm filming this video on a Thursday November 9th the year 2023 at about 7 in the morning so depending on when you're watching this video the date and time is going to be different if you would like to create your own custom date and time object you'll have to pass in some arguments you can follow this order for the date Constructor the first argument corresponds to a year then month day hour minute second and milliseconds even so for the year let's say 2024 the month zero corresponds to January one is February then that means a month of 11 is December let's say January so that will be zero for the day one for the 1 for the hour uh 2 2 in the morning this isn't military time by the way for the minute 3 minutes after the hour for the seconds 4 seconds after the minute we can even add milliseconds if we would like so for the milliseconds let's say five and here's my new date object Monday January 1st 2024 about 2 in the morning passing in a string representation of time to the date Constructor is also valid let's say the year is 2024 January 2nd for the time you're going to type t for time 12 12 noon then add Z for UTC time and there's my new date again Tuesday January 2nd 2024 600 in the morning another format you can use is within the date Constructor pass in a given amount of time in Mill seconds since epic if I could describe epic I would describe it as when the date your computer thinks time began if you were to pass in zero to the date Constructor you'll be given a date and time around December 31st 196 9 So within the DAT Constructor you can pass in a given amount of milliseconds since this date so if I was to pass in 1.7 billion milliseconds what I'm telling the day Constructor is give me the date and time that's 1.7 billion milliseconds since that epic date when I pass in 1.7 billion milliseconds the date that I'm given is Tuesday November 14th 2023 about 400 p.m. passing in milliseconds would be good for some sort of timer now let's use the current date and time I will pass in no arguments you can extract individual values from a date object I would like the year const year equals take our date object I will use the get full year method to get the year then I will console.log the year and this will be a number 2023 let's get the month const month equals our date object use the builtin get month method then I will console.log the month currently for me it's November not October so remember January is zero December is 11 let's get the day const day equals date get date not day if you get the day that will give you the day of the week like Sunday Monday Tuesday that sort of thing let's console.log the day so for me it's the 9th let's get the hour const hour equals date get hours plural console.log the hour for me at 700 in the morning let's get minutes const minutes equals get minutes console.log the minutes it is 745 in the morning get seconds get seconds console.log the seconds so 745 21 seconds after the minute now if you need the day of the week here's what you can do const day of week equals date get day that will give you the day of the week console.log day of week for me that is for Sunday is zero Monday is one so that means it is Thursday now with a date object you can even set the date with a method let's console.log the date I'm going to set the Year date set full year I will set the year to be 2024 yep Saturday November 9th 2024 let's set the month set month I will set the month to be January so I will pass in zero Tuesday January 9th let's set the day that would be with set date not day I will set it to be the 1 January 1 the hours with set hours let's go with two for 2 in the morning set minutes 3 minutes P the hour set seconds 4 seconds past the minute you can even compare dates as well let's create two date objects const date one equals a new date I'll pass in a string representation of a date we won't include the time though for the year let's say 2023 December that would be 12 31st New Year's Eve basically and for date 2 let's say date 2 is New Year's Day 2024 January 1st using an if statement let's compare to see if date 2 is greater than date 1 if it is then let's console.log happy New Year so date 2 is greater than date 1 will print happy New Year let's change date two to be 2023 December 30th well nothing happens then but that's to be expected all right everybody so those are date objects they're objects that contain values that represent dates and times these date objects can be changed and formatted to suit our needs and well everybody those are date objects in JavaScript
