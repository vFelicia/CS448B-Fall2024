With timestamps:

00:00 - hey everybody in this topic we're going
00:02 - to create a temperature conversion
00:03 - program as an exercise we'll Begin by
00:06 - asking what the current unit of
00:07 - measurement is unit equals
00:11 - will accept some user input
00:14 - is this temperature
00:18 - in
00:20 - Celsius
00:23 - or Fahrenheit
00:29 - C slash F
00:32 - then we will ask for the temperature
00:35 - I'll store the temperature in a variable
00:37 - named temp meaning temperature temp
00:40 - equals input
00:43 - enter the
00:46 - temperature
00:48 - then we should cast our user input as a
00:50 - floating Point number
00:54 - if unit is equal to C
01:01 - I'll fill this in momentarily I'm just
01:02 - going to write pass as a placeholder
01:06 - else if unit is equal to F we will do
01:11 - something else
01:15 - let's print something just an error
01:17 - message of some sort using an F string
01:21 - unit
01:23 - is
01:25 - an invalid unit of measurement
01:30 - Let's test this else statement
01:33 - is the temperature in Celsius or
01:35 - Fahrenheit what if I were to type K for
01:38 - Kelvin I'll make up some temperature
01:40 - like 100
01:41 - K is an invalid unit of measurement
01:44 - all right we know the else statement
01:46 - Works let's convert Fahrenheit to
01:48 - Celsius using this formula we will take
01:51 - our temperature
01:53 - equals
01:55 - 9 times our temp
01:59 - divided by five
02:02 - Plus 32.
02:04 - I'll take all of this and use the round
02:06 - function
02:07 - we'll round to one decimal place
02:11 - then we will print the current
02:13 - temperature in Fahrenheit
02:15 - I'll use an F string
02:18 - that temperature in
02:23 - Fahrenheit is
02:26 - our temp variable
02:28 - degrees Fahrenheit
02:31 - Let's test the if statement
02:34 - is the temperature in Celsius or
02:36 - Fahrenheit it is currently in Celsius
02:39 - what is 33 degrees in Celsius converted
02:42 - to Fahrenheit
02:45 - the temperature in Fahrenheit is 91.4
02:47 - degrees
02:48 - all right so this section is working
02:50 - let's work on the else statement else if
02:54 - our unit is currently in Fahrenheit
02:55 - we'll convert to Celsius
02:59 - that formula is temp equals
03:03 - our temperature minus 32.
03:06 - times 5
03:08 - divided by 9.
03:10 - then I will round the result to one
03:13 - decimal place
03:18 - then we'll print the temperature in
03:20 - Celsius
03:22 - the temperature in Celsius is 10 degrees
03:27 - C for Celsius
03:30 - is the temperature in Celsius or
03:32 - Fahrenheit it is currently in Fahrenheit
03:37 - enter the temperature 91.4
03:41 - the temperature in Celsius is 33.0
03:44 - degrees Celsius
03:46 - well everybody that is a simple
03:48 - temperature conversion program in Python
03:50 - I thought we could use some practice
03:51 - with if statements edit the next video
03:54 - we're going to create a calculator
03:55 - program

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody in this topic we're going to create a temperature conversion program as an exercise we'll Begin by asking what the current unit of measurement is unit equals will accept some user input is this temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit C slash F then we will ask for the temperature I'll store the temperature in a variable named temp meaning temperature temp equals input enter the temperature then we should cast our user input as a floating Point number if unit is equal to C I'll fill this in momentarily I'm just going to write pass as a placeholder else if unit is equal to F we will do something else let's print something just an error message of some sort using an F string unit is an invalid unit of measurement Let's test this else statement is the temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit what if I were to type K for Kelvin I'll make up some temperature like 100 K is an invalid unit of measurement all right we know the else statement Works let's convert Fahrenheit to Celsius using this formula we will take our temperature equals 9 times our temp divided by five Plus 32. I'll take all of this and use the round function we'll round to one decimal place then we will print the current temperature in Fahrenheit I'll use an F string that temperature in Fahrenheit is our temp variable degrees Fahrenheit Let's test the if statement is the temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit it is currently in Celsius what is 33 degrees in Celsius converted to Fahrenheit the temperature in Fahrenheit is 91.4 degrees all right so this section is working let's work on the else statement else if our unit is currently in Fahrenheit we'll convert to Celsius that formula is temp equals our temperature minus 32. times 5 divided by 9. then I will round the result to one decimal place then we'll print the temperature in Celsius the temperature in Celsius is 10 degrees C for Celsius is the temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit it is currently in Fahrenheit enter the temperature 91.4 the temperature in Celsius is 33.0 degrees Celsius well everybody that is a simple temperature conversion program in Python I thought we could use some practice with if statements edit the next video we're going to create a calculator program
