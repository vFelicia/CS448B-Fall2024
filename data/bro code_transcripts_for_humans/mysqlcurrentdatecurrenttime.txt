With timestamps:

00:00 - hey everybody in this topic I have a
00:02 - super quick video on getting the current
00:04 - date and time in MySQL let's create a
00:07 - temporary table at the end of this topic
00:08 - we'll delete it
00:10 - create table I'll name this table test
00:14 - we will have three columns
00:17 - the current date I'll name the column my
00:20 - date the data type is date
00:24 - my time the data type is time
00:28 - then we'll combine both
00:30 - my
00:31 - date time the data type is date time
00:36 - let's create this table it was created
00:38 - successfully then I will select all from
00:41 - our table test
00:44 - we have three columns a date a time and
00:47 - a date time which combines both so how
00:49 - do we get the current date maybe we need
00:51 - to create a timestamp of when some event
00:53 - happened maybe a higher date for our
00:56 - employees so I'm going to insert
00:59 - into the name of my table test
01:03 - some values
01:06 - for the current date there is a built-in
01:09 - function
01:10 - current underscore date then add a set
01:13 - of parentheses this function will return
01:15 - the current date
01:18 - for the current time there is a current
01:21 - time function add a set of parentheses
01:24 - to the end of that function
01:27 - for the date time you could just say now
01:29 - the net a set of parentheses
01:32 - after inserting this row let's select
01:35 - all from our table test
01:39 - here's the current date of me filming
01:41 - this video October 21st 2022 the time is
01:45 - seven in the morning
01:47 - the current date time is October 21st
01:49 - 2022 7 in the morning a date time would
01:52 - probably be good for some sort of
01:54 - transaction you need to record for the
01:56 - time being I'm going to set the current
01:58 - time to be null as well as the date time
02:01 - to be null now if you were to take your
02:03 - current date then add plus one
02:05 - this part of my statement would refer to
02:08 - tomorrow
02:09 - October 22nd if you were to take your
02:12 - current date minus one that would
02:15 - technically be yesterday October 20th
02:18 - you could do something similar with your
02:20 - time and date time you can add or
02:22 - subtract seconds but I think that's
02:23 - pretty self-explanatory we don't need
02:26 - this test table anymore so we can delete
02:28 - it
02:29 - drop table test
02:32 - and it's gone
02:34 - all right everybody so that was a super
02:36 - quick topic but I thought I needed to
02:37 - cover it that is how to get the current
02:39 - date time and date time in MySQL
