00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's you
bro here and in this video we're going
00:03 - to be discussing output and a few other
miscellaneous features with C++ let's
00:08 - get into it
00:11 - first things first I want to discuss
with you guys the use of namespaces in
00:15 - programming we can't have variables
functions and other things with the same
00:19 - name so to avoid that from happening we
can use a namespace different namespaces
00:24 - allow us to reuse the same names for
things as long as they are within a
00:28 - different namespace we can reuse that
same name in a different namespace in
00:33 - our standard output we are saying that
we are using the standard namespace for
00:38 - our output and it can be annoying to
have to type STD before every line but
00:43 - there's a trick that we can use where we
don't have to write this every time so
00:47 - outside of your main method this is what
we're going to type type using namespace
00:53 - STD so this is telling the C++ compiler
that just assume everything here is
01:02 - using this namespace so we no longer
have to type this out explicitly and
01:06 - this will work just the same then next
let's discuss the return 0 statement
01:11 - that you might see at the end of a main
method so programs may calculate or
01:15 - process something and return the result
what you may see at the bottom of many
01:19 - functions in C++ is this return keyword
and they usually return some sort of
01:25 - value at the bottom of your main
function we're going to want to return 0
01:30 - and this isn't necessary but I'll
explain what this does in just a moment
01:34 - so in C++ this is sometimes referred to
as the exit status what this does is
01:40 - that our program if it runs fine without
any errors it will return 0 and this is
01:46 - like a success status like saying the
program ran fine with zero errors
01:51 - however this is only required in C
programs it's optional in c++ the
01:57 - compiler automatically adds you return 0
if we don't explicitly write this but in
02:03 - case you do see this this is what this
means let's move on to line breaks when
02:07 - we write output statements our output
will only add a line break if we
02:11 - explicitly let the compiler know that we
intend it to so for example let's remove
02:16 - these newline characters and see what
happens when we run the program so our
02:23 - output is all
one long run-on sentence it's all on the
02:27 - same line even though our code is in two
different separate statements so you
02:32 - have to let the compiler know that you
intend to break this line and go down to
02:37 - the next line as if you're hitting Enter
and there's actually two ways to do this
02:40 - the first is that we covered it in the
first lesson you just use the newline
02:44 - character and I'll get into this more in
depth later on in this video the other
02:49 - way is that we can add these two left
angle brackets and these are sometimes
02:54 - referred to as the insertion operator
they basically pass along data and then
02:59 - add and L then semicolon and this is
short for end line but make sure you
03:06 - take out that other semicolon and this
will work just the same then so let's
03:10 - add that here as well so this is another
way of writing what we had before each
03:15 - has their own uses yeah and you can see
that each line has a line break and
03:23 - shifts down to the next line after it's
finished the second option to use a line
03:27 - break is to use backslash n which is
what we did previously but I'll explain
03:31 - this more in detail so the backslash
portion is part of something called an
03:36 - escape sequence depending on what
character that we add after the
03:40 - backslash it will have a certain effect
on our output if we add backslash n it
03:45 - will add a new line and for example if I
add backslash and before each of these
03:49 - words it's actually going to print each
of these words on a new line so let's
03:54 - try it out and you can see that changed
our output so you can use this escape
04:02 - sequence for a new line anywhere you
want within here and there's other
04:06 - escape sequences as well besides new
line like backslash t is for tab so
04:11 - let's try that out so this will add a
tab before each word and you can tap
04:18 - things in space things if you need to
write a set of quotes like you're
04:21 - quoting something you might have trouble
because your program won't know where
04:26 - our string of characters begins and
where our string of characters ends then
04:30 - so you can use an escape sequence to add
some quotes which is backslash and then
04:36 - single quote or double
so if you want to like quote something
04:40 - like we're quoting lyrics to a song here
you could just add backslash and then a
04:44 - set of double quotes and let's try this
out and you can see that our first line
04:51 - is not within quotes as if we're quoting
something and for some reason if you
04:55 - need to print out a backslash you
actually have to type double backslashes
04:59 - and let's try that out and here's our
backslash because remember if you have
05:08 - just a single backslash the compiler
thinks it's a beginning of an escape
05:13 - sequence so if you need to print it out
you need double backslashes so those are
05:18 - a few of the basic escape sequences they
should be aware of there's still many
05:22 - more out there and if you have time I
would suggest looking through online to
05:26 - see what else is out there if there's
anything that would be relevant for you
05:29 - but those are just a few of the basics
before we really start to dive into
05:33 - programming with c++ lastly for this
video we are going to discuss comments
05:37 - comments are a portion of code that is
ignored by the compiler it's like a
05:42 - secret message and it won't be displayed
or processed there used to leave notes
05:46 - for yourself or for other people
reviewing your code to read it's like a
05:50 - secret message here's an example of us
using a single line comment so what
05:55 - you're going to need to do is to type in
two forward slashes and you can see on
06:00 - my screen that this text became a green
color and we can write a comment here so
06:05 - perhaps for a comment I'll write lyrics
for a song that I enjoy so if we were to
06:15 - run this program it's not actually going
to display this comment and you can see
06:21 - that it skipped it it's basically like a
secret message for yourself or for
06:26 - somebody else that's looking over this
code so you can also write a multi-line
06:32 - comment all text that you want to be
included within a multi-line comment
06:36 - should begin with a forward slash
followed by a asterisk and you'll notice
06:41 - that all this text now became green
because we're saying that we want all of
06:46 - this to become a comment everything
after these two characters so you'll
06:50 - want to put
ending position for where you want this
06:54 - comment to end if it's on multiple lines
so let's say that we want our comment to
06:58 - end here what we need to type is then
asterisk and then a forward slash
07:02 - so everything within here will be a
comment and we can add multiple lines to
07:07 - here like I can say something such as
these lyrics are actually very good
07:19 - alright so then let's run this and all
of this will be ignored it's like a
07:25 - secret message that either I myself can
read or other people can read well that
07:30 - will conclude this topic on writing
output escape sequences comments and a
07:34 - few other things I forgot to discuss in
the first lesson so in the next lesson
07:38 - I'll be teaching you guys about
variables but yeah that will conclude
07:42 - this topic on some of the fundamentals
of C++ hey you if you enjoyed this
07:47 - lesson then you can help me help you in
3 easy steps by smashing that like
07:53 - button drop a comment down below and

07:57 - fellow bro
