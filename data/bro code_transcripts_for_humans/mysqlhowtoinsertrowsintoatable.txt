00:00 - hey everybody in this topic I'm going to
00:02 - show you how we can insert rows into a
00:04 - table we have a table named employees I
00:07 - will select everything from my table
00:08 - employees
00:12 - here are the columns we have an employee
00:15 - ID first name last name hourly pay and
00:18 - higher date to insert a row into a table
00:20 - we would type insert into
00:24 - the name of the table
00:26 - followed by values parentheses semicolon
00:31 - between this set of parentheses we will
00:34 - add all of the data for a row we will
00:37 - follow this order beginning with
00:39 - employee ID first name last name so on
00:42 - and so forth but we do have to pay
00:43 - attention to the data types too each
00:46 - piece of data will be separated with a
00:48 - comma let's begin with an employee ID
00:50 - the first employee will be Mr Krabs he's
00:54 - the first employee I'll give him an
00:56 - employee ID of one then we'll need a
00:58 - first name I'll put that within quotes
01:00 - because the data type of our first name
01:03 - is varchar basically speaking that's
01:05 - text
01:08 - Mr crab's first name is Eugene according
01:11 - to SpongeBob lore
01:13 - then we have a last name
01:16 - last name crabs
01:18 - hourly pay this is a decimal
01:21 - Mr Krabs hourly pay will be
01:24 - 25.50 I'm just making up numbers here
01:28 - higher date here's the format for a date
01:31 - with anesthetic quotes we will list the
01:34 - year followed by the month then the day
01:37 - I'll set Mr Krabs hired date to be
01:39 - January 2nd 2023
01:43 - now we can execute these statements
01:47 - yeah here we go here's the first row
01:49 - employee ID one
01:51 - first name Eugene last name crabs hourly
01:54 - pay 2550 higher date January 2nd 2023 it
01:58 - can be somewhat tedious to manually
02:01 - insert each row one statement at a time
02:03 - let's insert multiple rows at once
02:06 - to do that after my set of parentheses
02:10 - I will add another set of parentheses
02:13 - each separated with a comma depending on
02:15 - how many rows I would like to enter so I
02:17 - have four employees I would like to
02:19 - enter
02:19 - I will add four sets of parentheses each
02:22 - separated with the combo
02:24 - and let me just do some formatting to
02:26 - make this look pretty
02:29 - each set of parentheses corresponds to a
02:31 - new row so let's enter all the data that
02:34 - we'll need for this table
02:36 - employee ID number two will be
02:40 - Squidward
02:45 - tentacles
02:47 - Squidward's hourly pay will be maybe a
02:50 - solid fifteen dollars
02:53 - Squidward's higher date
02:55 - the year 2023 January
02:58 - I think January 3rd is good
03:01 - all right so that is the next row let's
03:03 - work on employee number three
03:05 - employee number three will be a
03:07 - SpongeBob
03:09 - last name will be
03:12 - Square Pants
03:15 - SpongeBob's hourly pay will be 12.50
03:20 - SpongeBob's higher date is the year 2023
03:23 - January 4th
03:26 - employee for
03:28 - will be Patrick
03:32 - star
03:33 - Patrick's hourly pay will be 12.50 as
03:37 - well
03:39 - higher day
03:40 - 2023 January
03:43 - 5th
03:45 - okay last employee
03:47 - employee ID number five
03:49 - first name Sandy
03:53 - last name
03:55 - cheeks
03:56 - Sandy's hourly pay will be 17.25 she'll
04:00 - be an assistant manager
04:03 - Sandy's start date will be the year 2023
04:07 - January 6th we can execute this
04:10 - statement to insert multiple rows all at
04:13 - once
04:14 - yep here's our table
04:16 - we have five rows each corresponding to
04:19 - a different employee we have Mr Krabs
04:22 - Squidward SpongeBob Patrick and Sandy
04:25 - I'm going to demonstrate what happens
04:27 - when we attempt to insert a row with
04:30 - missing data
04:34 - I will insert employee number six
04:37 - their first name is Sheldon
04:41 - last name Plankton but we will not
04:44 - insert an hourly rate of pay or a higher
04:46 - date here's what will happen
04:50 - so we have an error
04:51 - column count doesn't match the value at
04:54 - count at Row one we're missing data for
04:56 - our hourly pay and higher date you could
04:59 - insert just select columns that is done
05:02 - by adding after the name of the table
05:04 - add a set of parentheses then name the
05:07 - columns you would like to insert data
05:09 - into
05:09 - all we're adding is an employee ID
05:14 - first name
05:16 - then last name
05:21 - okay now we've inserted a new employee
05:23 - but there is data missing and that's
05:25 - okay we plan on hiring Mr Plankton but
05:28 - we have not yet negotiated an hourly pay
05:30 - or start date we still need to run a
05:32 - background check on him but we want to
05:34 - add him to the system at least so if you
05:36 - ever need to insert data into a row but
05:40 - you need to Omit certain columns you can
05:42 - simply just list the name of the columns
05:44 - you would like to sort data into
05:46 - all right everybody that is how to
05:48 - insert rows into a table in MySQL
