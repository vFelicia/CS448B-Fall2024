00:00 - hey everybody today I'm going to show
00:01 - you how we can create a table using HTML
00:04 - let's create a table of store hours for
00:06 - a fictional business I'll create a title
00:10 - using H3 header tags the title will be
00:14 - store hours what are the hours of
00:17 - operation for our store
00:19 - to create a table we need a pair of
00:20 - table tags
00:24 - for the first row we need a pair of TR
00:27 - tags meaning table row
00:30 - so the first row is going to be filled
00:32 - with table headers how many columns do
00:35 - we have well if we have a table of store
00:37 - hours they're seven days in a week
00:40 - we will need seven pairs of table header
00:44 - tags
00:45 - so let's copy and paste these tags six
00:48 - additional times for a total of seven
00:50 - one two three four five six seven
00:53 - all right now for the First Column the
00:56 - header will be Sunday we have Sunday
01:00 - then Monday
01:03 - Tuesday
01:06 - Wednesday
01:10 - Thursday
01:13 - Friday
01:15 - Saturday
01:19 - so here's my first row
01:21 - the first row is your table headers add
01:25 - one header for each column in your table
01:29 - for another row we need another pair of
01:32 - TR tags meaning table row
01:35 - so for my second row
01:37 - I'll include table data
01:40 - we need TD tags
01:43 - so we'll need a total of seven
01:50 - on Sunday our fictional store is going
01:52 - to be closed I'll type closed as we can
01:55 - see that this data is underneath this
01:58 - header for the second row
02:00 - Monday the hours will be nine to five
02:04 - let's apply that for the other days
02:05 - besides Saturday
02:08 - Monday through Friday the store is open
02:11 - between nine to five
02:12 - Saturday will be reduced hours ten to
02:15 - two
02:16 - alright not too bad
02:18 - to align the table data what you're
02:21 - going to do is within the table row take
02:23 - the Align attribute set this to Center
02:28 - or otherwise if you would like to write
02:30 - justify it you would type right
02:33 - but let's stick with Center
02:36 - let's align the first row as well
02:39 - we can also add a border within the
02:42 - opening table tag set border equal to
02:45 - zero that's for no border
02:48 - then increase the number depending on
02:50 - the thickness that you want
02:52 - so one will give us a border that is
02:54 - this thick
02:56 - two
02:59 - and three
03:01 - let's stick with one
03:05 - let me move this a little
03:07 - these table cells aren't exactly the
03:10 - same size the word Wednesday has a lot
03:12 - of characters
03:14 - within each of these header tags I will
03:16 - set the width
03:17 - to be maybe 100.
03:20 - this column is a little bit larger now
03:22 - let's copy the width and make each
03:25 - header have a width of 100.
03:31 - okay this table is All Uniform now
03:34 - but if we were to shrink this window
03:37 - the cells would be compressed
03:39 - okay let's change the background color
03:41 - let's begin with the table
03:43 - I will set the style attribute to be a
03:46 - CSS property
03:48 - let's set the background
03:50 - Dash color to be black
03:54 - the whole table is black now so let's
03:57 - change the color for the headers
04:01 - and I'm just going to copy this style
04:03 - attribute
04:05 - let's change the first row to have a
04:07 - color of
04:09 - light blue
04:12 - we can at least see the text now
04:16 - and then for the second row let's pick a
04:19 - different color
04:20 - I think this color would be good
04:22 - Alice blue
04:25 - yeah that's not too bad
04:27 - if you need additional rows for your
04:29 - table use another set of TR tags meaning
04:32 - table row then you can add another set
04:34 - of data alright everybody that is how to
04:37 - create a table using HTML
