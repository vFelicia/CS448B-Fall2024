With timestamps:

00:00 - all right we're moving on everybody now
00:02 - I'm gonna show you how we can insert
00:03 - documents into a mongodb database let's
00:06 - be sure that we're using our current
00:08 - database in the last topic we were using
00:11 - the database of school
00:13 - let's clear our screen
00:15 - to insert a document within the database
00:17 - we're working with type DB then the name
00:20 - of a collection if a collection is found
00:22 - within this database we have created a
00:25 - collection of students if this
00:27 - collection doesn't exist one will be
00:29 - created for you
00:32 - db.students.we will use the insert one
00:35 - method within the set of parentheses we
00:38 - will place a document which is enclosed
00:41 - within a set of curly braces within the
00:43 - set of curly braces we can list as many
00:45 - field value pairs as we would like
00:48 - let's create a name field with the value
00:51 - of SpongeBob
00:52 - each field value pair is comma separated
00:55 - let's add another field value pair
00:58 - maybe an age age will be 30.
01:03 - then a GPA
01:05 - grade point average
01:06 - SpongeBob has a solid 3.2 GPA
01:11 - let's enter this command that was
01:14 - acknowledged to return all documents
01:16 - within a collection type DB the name of
01:19 - the collection in this case students dot
01:22 - we can use the find method here are the
01:25 - current documents within my collection
01:26 - we only have one
01:28 - here's the object ID that's created
01:30 - automatically the name is SpongeBob age
01:33 - 30 GPA 3.2
01:36 - now you can insert more than one
01:38 - document at a time by using the insert
01:40 - many function
01:42 - DB type the name of the collection
01:44 - students in this case
01:46 - we will insert many documents we will
01:50 - place all documents to be inserted
01:52 - within an array add a set of straight
01:54 - brackets this is the exact same kind of
01:57 - array from different programming
01:59 - languages however in Python I think that
02:01 - would be a list technically
02:02 - maybe we need to insert three documents
02:05 - we would need three sets of curly braces
02:08 - each comma separated
02:12 - within each set of curly braces we would
02:15 - list all of the different field value
02:17 - pairs so let's begin with the first
02:20 - we have name
02:22 - Patrick
02:24 - separate each field value pair with a
02:27 - comma
02:27 - then we have age of let's make Patrick
02:30 - 38
02:32 - then GPA
02:34 - Patrick is at 1.5
02:38 - that's enough for our first document
02:39 - let's go to the second document move
02:41 - over to the second set of curly braces
02:44 - for the name
02:46 - this will be
02:47 - Sandy
02:50 - Sandy's age is
02:53 - I don't know 27 sounds good
02:56 - GPA Sandy smart she has a solid 4.0
03:01 - then let's go to the last document
03:04 - name
03:06 - maybe Gary
03:09 - 's age is 18.
03:13 - GPA
03:16 - 2.5
03:17 - that's good enough for now this array
03:20 - contains several documents each document
03:23 - is enclosed within a set of curly braces
03:25 - within each document you can have as
03:27 - many field value pairs as you like
03:30 - they all don't need to be consistent
03:31 - let's insert all of these documents they
03:34 - were all acknowledged we have three new
03:36 - object IDs
03:38 - let's use the find method again to
03:40 - display all of them DB dot students dot
03:43 - find here are the four objects found
03:46 - within our database
03:47 - SpongeBob Patrick Sandy Gary
03:50 - that's how to insert documents using the
03:53 - Shell next we'll do the same thing but
03:54 - use Compass instead if you're using
03:57 - Compass here's how to insert documents
03:59 - into a collection here are the four
04:00 - documents we created previously I'm just
04:02 - going to go ahead and delete these
04:07 - to add a new document to make sure
04:08 - you're within the current database
04:10 - you're working with go to the current
04:12 - collection RS students we will add data
04:16 - you can import a Json or CSV file or you
04:20 - can type them manually by inserting
04:22 - document
04:23 - a document is pre-generated for you I'm
04:25 - just going to go ahead and delete that
04:27 - we'll Begin by inserting SpongeBob you
04:29 - need a set of curly braces
04:31 - then list all of the name value pairs
04:35 - name SpongeBob
04:37 - separate each field value pair with a
04:39 - comma
04:41 - age 30
04:43 - GPA 3.2
04:46 - if you have this warning you will need
04:47 - to probably hit the format button that
04:49 - should go away
04:51 - then insert and that is how to insert
04:53 - one document to insert many it's the
04:55 - same process as before
04:58 - but you're going to enclose all of your
05:00 - documents within an array a set of
05:02 - straight brackets
05:04 - so if we need three documents
05:06 - add three sets of curly braces all comma
05:09 - separated
05:10 - we had Patrick
05:15 - age I think he was 38.
05:18 - GPA 1.5
05:22 - name
05:24 - Sandy
05:26 - age 27 I'm going to move this down a
05:29 - little bit so you can see
05:31 - GPA
05:32 - 4.0
05:35 - then name
05:37 - Gary
05:39 - age 18.
05:43 - GPA
05:44 - 2.5
05:46 - let's reformat insert and here are the
05:49 - three documents we have inserted all
05:51 - right and that is how to insert
05:53 - documents into a mongodb database using
05:56 - Compass

Cleaned transcript:

all right we're moving on everybody now I'm gonna show you how we can insert documents into a mongodb database let's be sure that we're using our current database in the last topic we were using the database of school let's clear our screen to insert a document within the database we're working with type DB then the name of a collection if a collection is found within this database we have created a collection of students if this collection doesn't exist one will be created for you db.students.we will use the insert one method within the set of parentheses we will place a document which is enclosed within a set of curly braces within the set of curly braces we can list as many field value pairs as we would like let's create a name field with the value of SpongeBob each field value pair is comma separated let's add another field value pair maybe an age age will be 30. then a GPA grade point average SpongeBob has a solid 3.2 GPA let's enter this command that was acknowledged to return all documents within a collection type DB the name of the collection in this case students dot we can use the find method here are the current documents within my collection we only have one here's the object ID that's created automatically the name is SpongeBob age 30 GPA 3.2 now you can insert more than one document at a time by using the insert many function DB type the name of the collection students in this case we will insert many documents we will place all documents to be inserted within an array add a set of straight brackets this is the exact same kind of array from different programming languages however in Python I think that would be a list technically maybe we need to insert three documents we would need three sets of curly braces each comma separated within each set of curly braces we would list all of the different field value pairs so let's begin with the first we have name Patrick separate each field value pair with a comma then we have age of let's make Patrick 38 then GPA Patrick is at 1.5 that's enough for our first document let's go to the second document move over to the second set of curly braces for the name this will be Sandy Sandy's age is I don't know 27 sounds good GPA Sandy smart she has a solid 4.0 then let's go to the last document name maybe Gary 's age is 18. GPA 2.5 that's good enough for now this array contains several documents each document is enclosed within a set of curly braces within each document you can have as many field value pairs as you like they all don't need to be consistent let's insert all of these documents they were all acknowledged we have three new object IDs let's use the find method again to display all of them DB dot students dot find here are the four objects found within our database SpongeBob Patrick Sandy Gary that's how to insert documents using the Shell next we'll do the same thing but use Compass instead if you're using Compass here's how to insert documents into a collection here are the four documents we created previously I'm just going to go ahead and delete these to add a new document to make sure you're within the current database you're working with go to the current collection RS students we will add data you can import a Json or CSV file or you can type them manually by inserting document a document is pregenerated for you I'm just going to go ahead and delete that we'll Begin by inserting SpongeBob you need a set of curly braces then list all of the name value pairs name SpongeBob separate each field value pair with a comma age 30 GPA 3.2 if you have this warning you will need to probably hit the format button that should go away then insert and that is how to insert one document to insert many it's the same process as before but you're going to enclose all of your documents within an array a set of straight brackets so if we need three documents add three sets of curly braces all comma separated we had Patrick age I think he was 38. GPA 1.5 name Sandy age 27 I'm going to move this down a little bit so you can see GPA 4.0 then name Gary age 18. GPA 2.5 let's reformat insert and here are the three documents we have inserted all right and that is how to insert documents into a mongodb database using Compass
