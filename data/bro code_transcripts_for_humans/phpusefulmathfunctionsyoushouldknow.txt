00:00 - hey everybody in today's topic I'm going
00:02 - to explain a few useful math related
00:04 - functions in PHP that you might be
00:06 - interested in we'll need an HTML
00:08 - document followed by a PHP script we
00:11 - will enter in some user input via an
00:13 - HTML form
00:15 - so let's create a form in our HTML
00:17 - document
00:18 - open it close it
00:22 - we will set the action equal to B our
00:26 - index page index.php
00:31 - for the method let's use post
00:36 - let's create a label
00:38 - label
00:40 - close it
00:43 - the label will be X we'll have a user
00:46 - enter in a number
00:48 - then let's add an input tag
00:50 - it's a self-closing tag
00:53 - the type will be text
00:56 - the name will be X
01:00 - then we need a submit button
01:04 - input type equals submit
01:10 - for the value let's say total
01:13 - it's a total button that's good enough
01:16 - for now
01:17 - if I'm using the post super Global
01:20 - variable
01:22 - let's say we need X Type post add a set
01:25 - of square brackets we would like the
01:28 - value of x
01:29 - I will cache this value within a local
01:32 - variable within my PHP script for
01:34 - convenience
01:35 - variable x equals whatever value for x
01:39 - that we receive just so that we're sure
01:41 - that everything's working fine let's
01:43 - Echo whatever X is Echo X
01:48 - So currently there's nothing in there
01:50 - let's type three hit total and there's
01:53 - our number X which is three so here's a
01:56 - few math related functions you may be
01:58 - interested in the first is the absolute
02:00 - value function let's say we have a total
02:03 - variable as well
02:07 - I'll declare this variable but not
02:08 - assign it quite yet I'll set that to be
02:11 - null then later on in my program we can
02:13 - assign total of value total equals to
02:17 - find the absolute value of a number type
02:20 - abs for absolute value followed by a set
02:23 - of parentheses semicolon whatever number
02:27 - or variable you put within this function
02:29 - ABS it will return the absolute value of
02:33 - that number we can either put a number
02:35 - in here or a variable let's put an X so
02:38 - variable X
02:40 - then I will Echo our total
02:45 - so I'm going to save
02:47 - I'll type in negative four this should
02:49 - return positive four
02:51 - which it does
02:53 - negative 100.123
02:59 - 100.123 that is the absolute value
03:02 - function let's cover a few more
03:04 - we have the round function we can round
03:06 - a number let's assign total equal to use
03:11 - the round function
03:12 - then we will pass in our variable X so
03:15 - let's save again
03:17 - refresh that
03:19 - 3.14 rounded is 3.
03:23 - 3.99 would be four
03:27 - now to always round down you can use the
03:29 - floor function
03:32 - so let's copy this line replace round
03:35 - with floor
03:37 - we will always round down so 3.99
03:41 - rounded is 3.
03:43 - 4.99 rounded down is 4. there's also
03:47 - seal meaning ceiling which will always
03:50 - round up
03:51 - replace floor with seal
03:54 - let's save
03:56 - refresh everything
03:59 - 3.14 rounded up is for 4.14 rounded up
04:03 - is 5. for this next example we'll need
04:06 - another number let's copy our label and
04:09 - our text box
04:11 - paste it replace x with Y here and here
04:17 - we'll need two numbers this time let's
04:19 - get whatever Y is
04:21 - so y equals within the post super Global
04:26 - variable we are looking for y
04:29 - we can use the power function to raise a
04:32 - base to a given power
04:33 - let's take our total variable equals
04:36 - power
04:38 - we'll need two numbers or two variables
04:41 - what is X raised to the power of Y
04:45 - so what is 2 to the power of 3. that
04:48 - would be eight two to the power of four
04:51 - is sixteen what about 3 to the power of
04:54 - three that is 27 3 to the power of four
04:57 - that is 81. that is the power function
05:00 - you can raise a base to a given power
05:03 - then we have square root I'm going to
05:05 - put that here
05:07 - total equals sqrt add a set of
05:11 - parentheses let's find the square root
05:13 - of x
05:16 - so we don't need Y in this case what is
05:18 - the square root of 100 that is 10.
05:22 - 144 that is 12. that's the square root
05:26 - function
05:27 - we will need three variables let's
05:30 - create another label and a text box
05:34 - the third number will be Z
05:36 - be sure to change the name too
05:39 - then we will create one more variable
05:43 - variable Z
05:45 - post Z then we have the max function
05:48 - total equals Max
05:51 - whatever values or variables you place
05:53 - within the max function the max function
05:55 - will give you the greatest value what is
05:58 - the maximum number between variables X
06:01 - y
06:03 - and z
06:04 - so let's save
06:06 - I'll refresh that
06:09 - one two three the highest number is
06:12 - three
06:14 - Thirty twenty ten the highest number is
06:18 - 30.
06:20 - then we do have the Min function which
06:23 - will give you the minimum
06:27 - what is the minimum number between 10 20
06:30 - 30.
06:32 - the minimum is 10.
06:34 - 3 2 1. the minimum is one
06:38 - that's the Min function
06:41 - the next function is an unusual one it
06:44 - is the pi function
06:46 - total equals Pi function so add a set of
06:50 - parentheses
06:51 - this will print 3.14
06:55 - and the remaining digits of pi if you
06:57 - ever need Pi you can use the pi function
07:01 - the next one's pretty useful it is the
07:03 - random function
07:05 - total equals Rand
07:10 - this will give you a completely random
07:11 - number I think up to just over 2 billion
07:15 - within the parentheses of the Rand
07:16 - function you can list two numbers for a
07:19 - minimum and a maximum if you're rolling
07:21 - a six-sided dice the minimum would be
07:24 - one the maximum would be six
07:26 - so now we're generating a random number
07:28 - between one and six
07:32 - we can either raise the minimum or raise
07:34 - the maximum
07:35 - for a random number between 1 and 100
07:38 - within the Rand function the first digit
07:41 - is one the second digit is one hundred
07:43 - so we have 10 85 17 84.
07:47 - if I were to raise the minimum let's say
07:49 - 90 we'll generate a random number
07:51 - between 90 and 100. maybe you could use
07:54 - this for a game
07:56 - now we're going to go over an exercise
07:58 - for this exercise we will have a user
08:01 - enter in a radius the radius of a circle
08:04 - using PHP we will calculate what the
08:07 - circumference would be the area and the
08:10 - volume if that radius is for a sphere
08:13 - so we will need to accept some user
08:15 - input we'll do that with an HTML form So
08:18 - within our HTML document let's create a
08:20 - form
08:21 - then close it
08:25 - the action will equal our index PHP file
08:31 - the method
08:33 - will be post
08:39 - we will need a label
08:42 - close it
08:46 - the label will be radius
08:51 - let's add a text box we need a
08:54 - self-closing input tag the type will be
08:56 - text
08:58 - the name will be radius because we're
09:01 - accepting a radius
09:03 - then a submit button
09:06 - input type equals submit
09:12 - for the value let's say
09:15 - calculate
09:18 - that's all we need
09:19 - within our PHP script let's create a
09:22 - local radius variable we will get the
09:25 - value from this text box via the post
09:28 - super Global variable
09:30 - let's access the post variable we are
09:33 - looking for the radius
09:37 - and now we have a radius
09:39 - we'll declare a circumference variable
09:44 - I think that's how to spell
09:45 - circumference
09:46 - that will be null
09:49 - to calculate the circumference of a
09:50 - circle we can follow this formula
09:53 - circumference equals
09:56 - 2 times Pi Pi we can use the pi function
10:00 - times our variable
10:03 - radius
10:07 - then let's Echo let's say circumference
10:12 - equals add a placeholder then insert our
10:16 - variable circumference
10:19 - let's say that this is in centimeters
10:21 - then I'll add a line break
10:23 - maybe the radius is 5 I'll calculate
10:26 - that the circumference is 31.4 and we
10:30 - have a lot of digits after
10:32 - there's one thing I'm going to change
10:33 - real quick I'm going to add a line break
10:35 - after our form
10:37 - for the radius let's say it's 10.
10:40 - I'm going to hit calculate here's our
10:42 - circumference
10:44 - 62.83 and some change centimeters
10:48 - we can use the round function to round
10:50 - to a given digit I would like to round
10:53 - to the second digit after the decimal
10:55 - before we display our output let's
10:58 - reassign circumference
11:00 - equal to use the round function
11:04 - then pass in our circumference
11:07 - but I'm going to make one change
11:09 - normally the round function will round a
11:11 - number to the nearest whole integer to
11:14 - round to a given digit add a comma then
11:17 - that digit place let's round to the
11:20 - second digit
11:21 - so our circumference is 62.83
11:24 - centimeters let's also calculate the
11:27 - area and the volume
11:29 - we'll need a area variable I'll set that
11:32 - to be null
11:34 - to calculate the area let's set area
11:37 - equal to we'll need the pi function
11:41 - times our radius to the power of 2 we
11:44 - can use the power function
11:46 - enter in our radius
11:50 - to the power of 2.
11:54 - then we can round our area
11:56 - equals round within the round function
11:59 - enter in your area
12:01 - we would like to round to the second
12:03 - digit after the decimal
12:06 - then we will display the area
12:10 - area equals our area variable
12:15 - I think technically that should be
12:17 - centimeter squared
12:21 - so let's save I'll enter in a new radius
12:23 - okay so if our radius is 15 this time
12:26 - I'll calculate that
12:28 - with the radius of 15 their
12:29 - circumference is
12:31 - 94.25 centimeters the area is
12:34 - 706.86 centimeter squared
12:37 - now we'll calculate volume if the radius
12:40 - is for a sphere
12:42 - volume equals no
12:50 - volume equals here's the formula
12:54 - 4 divided by 3
12:57 - times pi function
13:00 - times our radius to the power of 3 we
13:03 - can use the power function
13:05 - we are raising R radius to the power of
13:09 - 3.
13:11 - then we will take our volume and round
13:14 - to two decimal places
13:17 - volume comma 2.
13:21 - then we will display the result with
13:23 - Echo
13:25 - volume
13:27 - equals add a placeholder
13:30 - our volume
13:32 - centimeters I think that's cubed
13:34 - technically
13:36 - if our radius is 5
13:39 - their circumference is 31.42 the area is
13:43 - 78.54 and the volume is
13:46 - 523.60 centimeters cubed
13:49 - all right everybody well I thought that
13:51 - would be some good practice with some
13:53 - math functions now we're a little more
13:55 - comfortable using them if you would like
13:56 - a copy of this code I'll post it in the
13:58 - comments section down below and well
14:00 - those are some useful math related
14:02 - functions in PHP

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody in today's topic I'm going to explain a few useful math related functions in PHP that you might be interested in we'll need an HTML document followed by a PHP script we will enter in some user input via an HTML form so let's create a form in our HTML document open it close it we will set the action equal to B our index page index.php for the method let's use post let's create a label label close it the label will be X we'll have a user enter in a number then let's add an input tag it's a selfclosing tag the type will be text the name will be X then we need a submit button input type equals submit for the value let's say total it's a total button that's good enough for now if I'm using the post super Global variable let's say we need X Type post add a set of square brackets we would like the value of x I will cache this value within a local variable within my PHP script for convenience variable x equals whatever value for x that we receive just so that we're sure that everything's working fine let's Echo whatever X is Echo X So currently there's nothing in there let's type three hit total and there's our number X which is three so here's a few math related functions you may be interested in the first is the absolute value function let's say we have a total variable as well I'll declare this variable but not assign it quite yet I'll set that to be null then later on in my program we can assign total of value total equals to find the absolute value of a number type abs for absolute value followed by a set of parentheses semicolon whatever number or variable you put within this function ABS it will return the absolute value of that number we can either put a number in here or a variable let's put an X so variable X then I will Echo our total so I'm going to save I'll type in negative four this should return positive four which it does negative 100.123 100.123 that is the absolute value function let's cover a few more we have the round function we can round a number let's assign total equal to use the round function then we will pass in our variable X so let's save again refresh that 3.14 rounded is 3. 3.99 would be four now to always round down you can use the floor function so let's copy this line replace round with floor we will always round down so 3.99 rounded is 3. 4.99 rounded down is 4. there's also seal meaning ceiling which will always round up replace floor with seal let's save refresh everything 3.14 rounded up is for 4.14 rounded up is 5. for this next example we'll need another number let's copy our label and our text box paste it replace x with Y here and here we'll need two numbers this time let's get whatever Y is so y equals within the post super Global variable we are looking for y we can use the power function to raise a base to a given power let's take our total variable equals power we'll need two numbers or two variables what is X raised to the power of Y so what is 2 to the power of 3. that would be eight two to the power of four is sixteen what about 3 to the power of three that is 27 3 to the power of four that is 81. that is the power function you can raise a base to a given power then we have square root I'm going to put that here total equals sqrt add a set of parentheses let's find the square root of x so we don't need Y in this case what is the square root of 100 that is 10. 144 that is 12. that's the square root function we will need three variables let's create another label and a text box the third number will be Z be sure to change the name too then we will create one more variable variable Z post Z then we have the max function total equals Max whatever values or variables you place within the max function the max function will give you the greatest value what is the maximum number between variables X y and z so let's save I'll refresh that one two three the highest number is three Thirty twenty ten the highest number is 30. then we do have the Min function which will give you the minimum what is the minimum number between 10 20 30. the minimum is 10. 3 2 1. the minimum is one that's the Min function the next function is an unusual one it is the pi function total equals Pi function so add a set of parentheses this will print 3.14 and the remaining digits of pi if you ever need Pi you can use the pi function the next one's pretty useful it is the random function total equals Rand this will give you a completely random number I think up to just over 2 billion within the parentheses of the Rand function you can list two numbers for a minimum and a maximum if you're rolling a sixsided dice the minimum would be one the maximum would be six so now we're generating a random number between one and six we can either raise the minimum or raise the maximum for a random number between 1 and 100 within the Rand function the first digit is one the second digit is one hundred so we have 10 85 17 84. if I were to raise the minimum let's say 90 we'll generate a random number between 90 and 100. maybe you could use this for a game now we're going to go over an exercise for this exercise we will have a user enter in a radius the radius of a circle using PHP we will calculate what the circumference would be the area and the volume if that radius is for a sphere so we will need to accept some user input we'll do that with an HTML form So within our HTML document let's create a form then close it the action will equal our index PHP file the method will be post we will need a label close it the label will be radius let's add a text box we need a selfclosing input tag the type will be text the name will be radius because we're accepting a radius then a submit button input type equals submit for the value let's say calculate that's all we need within our PHP script let's create a local radius variable we will get the value from this text box via the post super Global variable let's access the post variable we are looking for the radius and now we have a radius we'll declare a circumference variable I think that's how to spell circumference that will be null to calculate the circumference of a circle we can follow this formula circumference equals 2 times Pi Pi we can use the pi function times our variable radius then let's Echo let's say circumference equals add a placeholder then insert our variable circumference let's say that this is in centimeters then I'll add a line break maybe the radius is 5 I'll calculate that the circumference is 31.4 and we have a lot of digits after there's one thing I'm going to change real quick I'm going to add a line break after our form for the radius let's say it's 10. I'm going to hit calculate here's our circumference 62.83 and some change centimeters we can use the round function to round to a given digit I would like to round to the second digit after the decimal before we display our output let's reassign circumference equal to use the round function then pass in our circumference but I'm going to make one change normally the round function will round a number to the nearest whole integer to round to a given digit add a comma then that digit place let's round to the second digit so our circumference is 62.83 centimeters let's also calculate the area and the volume we'll need a area variable I'll set that to be null to calculate the area let's set area equal to we'll need the pi function times our radius to the power of 2 we can use the power function enter in our radius to the power of 2. then we can round our area equals round within the round function enter in your area we would like to round to the second digit after the decimal then we will display the area area equals our area variable I think technically that should be centimeter squared so let's save I'll enter in a new radius okay so if our radius is 15 this time I'll calculate that with the radius of 15 their circumference is 94.25 centimeters the area is 706.86 centimeter squared now we'll calculate volume if the radius is for a sphere volume equals no volume equals here's the formula 4 divided by 3 times pi function times our radius to the power of 3 we can use the power function we are raising R radius to the power of 3. then we will take our volume and round to two decimal places volume comma 2. then we will display the result with Echo volume equals add a placeholder our volume centimeters I think that's cubed technically if our radius is 5 their circumference is 31.42 the area is 78.54 and the volume is 523.60 centimeters cubed all right everybody well I thought that would be some good practice with some math functions now we're a little more comfortable using them if you would like a copy of this code I'll post it in the comments section down below and well those are some useful math related functions in PHP
