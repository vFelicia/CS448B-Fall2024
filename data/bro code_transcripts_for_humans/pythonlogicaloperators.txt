00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's bro
00:02 - hope you're doing well in this video i'm
00:03 - going to explain
00:04 - logical operators in python so sit back
00:07 - relax
00:08 - and enjoy the show
00:11 - if you wouldn't mind please like comment
00:13 - and subscribe
00:14 - one like equals one prayer for the
00:16 - youtube algorithm
00:18 - all right everybody let's talk about
00:20 - logical operators
00:21 - these are used to check if two or more
00:24 - conditional statements
00:26 - are true so we'll be discussing the and
00:28 - as well as the or logical operators
00:31 - there's also a third one called not but
00:33 - that works a little bit different and
00:34 - i'll explain why
00:36 - so let's create a program to demonstrate
00:38 - this let's create a program where we
00:40 - will ask somebody for the temperature
00:41 - outside
00:42 - and then depending on the temperature if
00:44 - it falls within a certain range we will
00:45 - print a message
00:47 - so we'll need to use and as well as or
00:49 - logical operators to do this
00:50 - so here i have a prompt temp for
00:52 - temperature equals input what is the
00:54 - temperature outside
00:56 - so i'm going to cast this as an integer
00:58 - data type
01:00 - so what if we want to check to see if
01:01 - our temperature is within a certain
01:03 - range
01:04 - we can use the and logical operator to
01:07 - check
01:07 - two or more conditional statements this
01:09 - is how we might do that
01:11 - let's check if temp
01:14 - is greater than or equal to zero zero
01:17 - degrees celsius
01:18 - and we can check another condition too
01:20 - if temp
01:22 - is less than or equal to 30 degrees
01:24 - celsius
01:26 - so we need to add a colon at the end to
01:28 - finish this if statement
01:30 - and let me just fix some of the spacing
01:33 - okay so
01:34 - with the and logical operator in order
01:36 - for this entire condition to be true
01:39 - both conditions must be true this needs
01:42 - to be true
01:42 - and this needs to be true so if our
01:45 - temperature
01:46 - is equal to or above zero as well
01:49 - as being less than or equal to 30 that
01:52 - means our temperature
01:53 - falls within a certain range so let's
01:55 - print a message
01:56 - such as the temperature
02:00 - is good today
02:04 - print go outside
02:08 - all right let's try it so what is the
02:12 - temperature outside let's say it's 20
02:14 - degrees celsius
02:15 - well the temperature is good today go
02:18 - outside
02:18 - this condition is true 20 is greater
02:21 - than or
02:22 - equal to zero and temperature is less
02:24 - than or equal to 30.
02:26 - let's try a different temperature like
02:28 - negative 20 degrees celsius so it's
02:30 - really freaking cold outside right now
02:32 - as you can see nothing happened because
02:34 - our first condition
02:36 - was false our temperature is not greater
02:38 - than or equal to zero
02:40 - but our temperature is less than or
02:42 - equal to 30
02:43 - so our second condition is true but our
02:46 - first condition was false
02:47 - and in order for this entire statement
02:49 - to be true since we're using the and
02:51 - logical operator
02:52 - both conditions must be true in order
02:54 - for this statement
02:55 - to be true now let's discuss the or
02:58 - logical operator
02:59 - we can check to see if our temperature
03:01 - is below
03:02 - or above a certain range so let's write
03:04 - else if
03:06 - temp is less than zero or
03:09 - temp is greater than 30. so that means
03:13 - it's going to be either
03:14 - very cold outside or very hot outside so
03:17 - let's print a message
03:20 - the temperature
03:23 - is bad today
03:28 - print stay
03:32 - inside all right let's try this again
03:37 - what is the temperature outside it is
03:38 - negative 20 degrees outside
03:41 - the temperature is bad today stay inside
03:43 - so with the orological operator as
03:46 - long as one of these conditions is true
03:48 - then the entire statement
03:50 - is true it doesn't matter if one of them
03:52 - is false as long as one of them is true
03:54 - then the entire statement is true last
03:56 - but not least we have the
03:57 - not logical operator this works a little
03:59 - bit different from the and as well as
04:01 - the orological operator because
04:03 - we can check one or more conditional
04:06 - statements instead of
04:07 - two or more conditional statements so
04:09 - what the not logical operator will do
04:11 - is that it'll take a conditional
04:13 - statement if it's true
04:14 - it's going to flip it to false if it's
04:16 - normally false it's going to flip it to
04:18 - true
04:18 - so for this example we have another way
04:20 - in which we could write this
04:22 - although it's a little more complex so
04:24 - if our statement is true
04:26 - what we can do is that we can flip it to
04:28 - false using the
04:29 - not logical operator if it's normally
04:31 - false we can change it to true
04:33 - so what we'll do is surround one or more
04:35 - conditional statements with a set of
04:37 - parentheses
04:38 - and precede everything within the
04:39 - parentheses with the not
04:41 - logical operator so if the statement is
04:43 - normally true
04:44 - it's going to become false using the not
04:46 - logical operator
04:47 - if it's normally false it's going to be
04:49 - true then let's do the same with the
04:51 - else if statement
04:52 - so surround one or more conditional
04:54 - statements with the not
04:56 - logical operator so now these roles are
04:58 - going to be kind of reversed so let's
05:00 - try this again
05:00 - what is the temperature outside it is
05:02 - negative 20 degrees outside
05:04 - the temperature is good today go outside
05:06 - so what we should probably do
05:07 - is kind of reverse these rolls so i'm
05:10 - just going to swap everything within
05:12 - these if statements with each other
05:15 - and now this should work the same as it
05:17 - did before but we just wrote it a little
05:18 - bit different
05:19 - what is the temperature outside it is 15
05:22 - degrees outside 15 degrees celsius
05:24 - the temperature is good today go outside
05:27 - so with the not
05:28 - logical operator you can surround one or
05:30 - more conditional statements
05:32 - with the not logical operator and what
05:34 - this will do is flip it from being
05:36 - false to true or from true to false well
05:39 - everybody that's the basics of logical
05:41 - operators in python if you would like a
05:43 - copy of all this code i will post this
05:45 - in the comments down below
05:47 - but yeah that's the basics of logical
05:49 - operators
05:50 - in python hey you yeah i'm talking to
05:53 - you
05:54 - if you learned something new then help

hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well in this video i'm going to explain logical operators in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you wouldn't mind please like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm all right everybody let's talk about logical operators these are used to check if two or more conditional statements are true so we'll be discussing the and as well as the or logical operators there's also a third one called not but that works a little bit different and i'll explain why so let's create a program to demonstrate this let's create a program where we will ask somebody for the temperature outside and then depending on the temperature if it falls within a certain range we will print a message so we'll

if temp is greater than or equal to zero zero degrees celsius and we can check another condition too if temp is less than or equal to 30 degrees celsius so we need to add a colon at the end to finish this if statement and let me just fix some of the spacing okay so with the and logical operator in order for this entire condition to be true both conditions must be true this needs to be true and this needs to be true so if our temperature is equal to or above zero as well as being less than or equal to 30 that means our temperature falls within a certain range so let's print a message such as the temperature is good today print go outside all right let's try it so what is the temperature outside let's say it's 20 degrees celsius well the temperature is good today go outside this condition is true 20 is greater than or equal to zero and temperature is less than or equal to 30. let's try a different temperature like negative 20 degrees celsius so it's really freaking cold outside right now as you can see nothing happened because our first condition was false our temperature is not greater than or equal to zero but our temperature is less than or equal to 30 so our second condition is true but our first condition was false and in order for this entire statement to be true since we're using the and logical operator both conditions must be true in order for this statement to be true now let's discuss the or logical operator we can check to see if our temperature is below or above a certain range so let's write else if temp is less than zero or temp is greater than 30. so that means it's going to be either very cold outside or very hot outside so let's print a message the temperature is bad today print stay inside all right let's try this again what is the temperature outside it is negative 20 degrees outside the temperature is bad today stay inside so with the orological operator as long as one of these conditions is true then the entire statement is true it doesn't matter if one of them is false as long as one of them is true then the entire statement is true last but not least we have the not logical operator this works a little bit different from the

so what we should probably do is kind of reverse these rolls so i'm just going to swap everything within these if statements with each other and now this should work the same as it did before but we just wrote it a little bit different what is the temperature outside it is 15 degrees outside 15 degrees celsius the temperature is good today go outside so with the not logical operator you can surround one or more conditional statements with the not logical operator and what this will do is flip it from being false to true or from true to false well everybody that's the basics of logical
