00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's you
00:01 - bro hope you're doing well and in this
00:03 - video i'm going to teach you guys about
00:04 - the file class
00:06 - in java so sit back relax and enjoy the
00:08 - show
00:11 - make sure you like comment and subscribe
00:14 - one like equals one prayer for the
00:16 - youtube algorithm
00:18 - welcome back guys and gals in this video
00:20 - we're going to be discussing the file
00:22 - class now a file
00:23 - is an abstract representation of file
00:26 - and directory path names
00:27 - what we'll be doing in this video is
00:29 - detecting to see if we have a certain
00:31 - file
00:32 - someplace within our computer so here's
00:34 - an example here's my desktop
00:36 - please excuse the mess i'm going to
00:37 - create a new text file on my desktop
00:40 - so i'm going to go to file new text
00:43 - document
00:44 - i'll call this secret underscore
00:47 - message and i'm going to copy and paste
00:51 - this text document within my project
00:53 - folder so i'm going to click on my
00:55 - project folder
00:56 - and paste it so now within my project
00:59 - folder i have
01:00 - a txt file called secret message what
01:03 - i'm going to do
01:03 - is just detect to see if i have a file
01:07 - called secretmessage.txt within my
01:10 - project folder to begin with
01:12 - so we need to create a file object using
01:14 - the file class
01:15 - but we'll need this import at the top
01:17 - too so
01:18 - let's create a file object file file
01:22 - equals new file and within the
01:25 - constructor of
01:26 - this file object we're going to list the
01:28 - file that we're going to associate with
01:30 - this file object
01:31 - so i'm going to list the name of this
01:34 - file
01:35 - so within quotes this title is
01:38 - secret underscore message dot txt be
01:42 - sure to include the file extension if it
01:44 - has one
01:45 - so in order to check to see if a file
01:47 - exists or not
01:48 - there is a method to do so
01:51 - so within an if statement we're going to
01:54 - write
01:54 - file dot exists so if
01:58 - our file exists if there is a match
02:01 - we will execute this if statement and
02:03 - let's just write a message
02:05 - that file exists
02:10 - surprise space else
02:13 - that file won't exist so within an else
02:15 - statement
02:16 - we'll display that file
02:20 - doesn't exist frowny face
02:24 - all right let's try this and it states
02:27 - that file exists so what if i don't have
02:30 - the file extension
02:33 - right now we're just looking for a plain
02:34 - file that says secret message
02:36 - and it states that file doesn't exist so
02:39 - be sure to include the file extension if
02:41 - it has one
02:42 - so what if i removed this file so i'm
02:45 - going to delete it
02:47 - and let's run this again and it states
02:49 - that that file doesn't exist
02:51 - so with the file constructor of our file
02:54 - object
02:55 - when we list a file name we're going to
02:57 - begin
02:58 - looking within our project folder as the
03:00 - initial directory
03:02 - but what if a file is located someplace
03:05 - else within our computer
03:06 - and not necessarily within the same
03:08 - project folder
03:10 - what we're instead going to do is list
03:12 - the full file path
03:13 - within the constructor plus the file
03:15 - name too well here we are again back in
03:18 - my desktop so i would like to
03:20 - see or detect if my secret message is on
03:23 - my desktop
03:24 - but i need to get the full file path so
03:26 - i'm going to right click on my file
03:28 - go to properties and then copy this
03:31 - location
03:34 - so this is the file path within the file
03:36 - constructor
03:37 - i'm going to paste my file location
03:40 - plus the name of the file that i'm
03:42 - looking for
03:43 - so if you have backslashes make sure to
03:46 - include double backslashes because
03:48 - that's an escape sequence
03:50 - on the other hand forward slashes would
03:51 - work too so just to demonstrate
03:53 - let's switch these to one forward slash
03:56 - each
03:57 - kind of like that alright so let's run
03:59 - this again if i have
04:01 - this file name at this file location
04:04 - it's going to
04:06 - state that file exists or it doesn't
04:08 - exist if it's not there
04:10 - and it states that file exists so
04:12 - remember
04:13 - if your file is within your project
04:15 - folder you only need
04:17 - the file name if it's anyplace else
04:19 - you'll want to list the file
04:21 - path so let's cover a few other useful
04:23 - methods of file class
04:25 - but for now i'm going to move my secret
04:27 - message back into my project folder
04:30 - and with the file path i'm just going to
04:32 - list the file name
04:34 - so it states that this file exists let's
04:36 - cover the
04:37 - get path method so i'm going to write
04:39 - this within a print line statement
04:41 - file dot get path so
04:44 - the path is whatever you have listed
04:46 - within
04:47 - the constructor of the file class so
04:50 - this is just going to display that
04:52 - secretmessage.txt now if you want the
04:55 - location of where this file is within
04:57 - your computer
04:58 - that is the absolute path and there is a
05:00 - separate function for that
05:02 - file dot get absolute path
05:05 - and this file of mine here is at
05:08 - this location within my computer this is
05:10 - the full
05:11 - file path the is file method will return
05:14 - true or false depending if your file is
05:17 - in fact a
05:18 - file so let's use the file dot is file
05:21 - method so if this file is a file it's
05:25 - going to return true which it is
05:27 - if you select a folder well this is
05:29 - going to be false then
05:30 - so that's one way in which you can
05:32 - verify if a file is in fact a file and
05:34 - not a folder
05:36 - we can also delete a file too file dot
05:39 - delete so this is actually going to
05:42 - delete
05:43 - my file within my project folder or i
05:45 - can set a
05:46 - file path if i would like to delete a
05:48 - file that's someplace else within my
05:50 - computer
05:51 - so this is going to delete this file
05:53 - after running it
05:54 - so i'm going to run this program well
05:57 - what the heck
05:58 - it appears that this file is still
05:59 - within my project folder even though i
06:02 - called the delete function
06:03 - well that's because we need to refresh
06:05 - this so i'm going to right click and
06:07 - click
06:08 - refresh or you can type f5 so you can
06:11 - see that that file is no longer there
06:12 - and if we were to run this program one
06:14 - more time
06:15 - well our file no longer exists and it
06:18 - states
06:18 - that file doesn't exist so those are
06:21 - just a few
06:22 - relevant methods there's still way more
06:24 - methods out there you can always take a
06:25 - look
06:26 - through a few of these too but i thought
06:28 - those are some of the more useful and
06:30 - pertinent ones to you
06:31 - so that's everything you need to know to
06:33 - get started using files in java if you
06:35 - would like a copy of all this code
06:37 - i will post all of this in the comments
06:39 - down below but yeah that's how the file
06:41 - class
06:42 - works in java hey you
06:45 - yeah i'm talking to you if you learn
06:47 - something new then you can help
06:49 - me help you in three easy steps
06:52 - by smashing that like button drop a
06:54 - comment down below
06:56 - and subscribe if you'd like to become a
06:57 - fellow bro
07:03 - [Music]
07:18 - you
