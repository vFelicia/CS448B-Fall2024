00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's your
00:01 - bro here hope you're doing well and in
00:03 - this video i'm going to teach you guys
00:04 - how we can create
00:05 - message boxes in python so sit back
00:08 - relax and enjoy the show
00:12 - if you find this video helpful please
00:14 - remember to like comment
00:16 - and subscribe your support will help
00:18 - keep this channel running
00:20 - okay people let's create some message
00:22 - boxes but first we'll need an import so
00:24 - from
00:25 - tk enter import
00:28 - message box and what this will do
00:32 - is import the message box
00:35 - library so it's not necessary to add
00:38 - this comment
00:39 - uh so we'll need a window window equals
00:42 - tk
00:42 - followed by window.main loop
00:46 - let's create a button so button
00:49 - equals button we're going to add this to
00:52 - the window
00:53 - we're going to set the command to
00:55 - execute a click function that will have
00:58 - a message box appear when we click on
01:00 - the button and let's set the text
01:03 - so text equals click me
01:07 - and then we will need to pack this
01:09 - button so button.pack
01:11 - now we'll need to create a click
01:12 - function so let's do that at the top
01:15 - def click and what do we want to do
01:20 - so there's a few different message
01:22 - dialog boxes that you can use
01:24 - so let's begin with a basic show info
01:26 - message box
01:27 - so message box dot and there's a few
01:31 - options let's begin with
01:33 - show info show info
01:36 - this just displays a simple message so
01:38 - if we were to run this
01:40 - we have a button we click on the button
01:42 - and it's going to create a message box
01:44 - for us
01:45 - and it just shows some info but we don't
01:47 - really have any info to show yet
01:49 - so we can set a title and we can set a
01:51 - message
01:52 - so let's set the title title equals
01:57 - this is an info
02:00 - message box
02:05 - although part of the title got cut off
02:08 - let's also set the message message
02:11 - equals
02:13 - you are a person
02:19 - click me you are a person thanks i
02:22 - didn't know that
02:24 - so there's a few other message boxes
02:26 - that we can use too
02:27 - so for now i'm just going to turn this
02:28 - into a comment and i'll just copy this
02:31 - just to save some time
02:35 - and the next one that we have is
02:38 - show warning
02:41 - so this will have a different icon so
02:44 - the title
02:45 - let's say warning and the message
02:49 - you have a virus
02:56 - so now we get this annoying warning
02:58 - message but you can just click okay to
03:00 - get rid of it
03:01 - uh so one thing that you might see with
03:04 - tech support scams
03:05 - they'll have a message box like this
03:08 - that shows a warning
03:09 - but they'll put this within a while loop
03:11 - that's set to true
03:13 - so this will just continue on and on
03:18 - kind of like this so if we were to try
03:21 - and close out of this
03:22 - it's just going to reappear while
03:26 - true is true basically uh so that's just
03:29 - something funny that i wanted to show
03:30 - you
03:31 - so let's move on i'm going to turn this
03:33 - into a comment
03:36 - then the next one we have is show error
03:42 - so show error
03:46 - title set it to whatever you want
03:50 - error message
03:53 - something went wrong
04:02 - there's a few more sophisticated ones
04:03 - too we can ask for some user input
04:07 - so this next one is message box
04:11 - dot ask and there's a few to choose from
04:15 - let's go with ask okay cancel first
04:18 - we'll set the title title equals
04:22 - ask okay cancel
04:26 - and a message message
04:31 - do you want to
04:34 - do the thing
04:41 - so we can actually put this within an if
04:43 - statement
04:44 - so this returns either true or false
04:47 - depending on what you click
04:49 - so let's put this within an if statement
04:52 - if this is true
04:54 - print you did
04:57 - a thing
05:00 - if it returns false we can use an else
05:02 - statement
05:04 - else what else do we want to do we'll
05:06 - say else
05:08 - print you
05:11 - cancelled a thing
05:14 - and let's test this
05:22 - but i am forgetting a colon there
05:27 - do you want to do the thing okay you did
05:29 - a thing
05:30 - let's try it again do you want to do the
05:33 - thing
05:33 - cancel you cancelled a thing cool
05:37 - there's a few others
05:38 - so i'll turn all of these into comments
05:43 - and the next one we can go over is ask
05:46 - retry cancel
05:47 - and this is fairly similar to what we
05:49 - had before i'm going to copy this
05:54 - let's change this to ask
05:58 - retry cancel ask retry
06:01 - cancel do you want
06:05 - retry the thing
06:10 - you retried a thing
06:14 - or you cancelled a thing so it's very
06:16 - similar to what we had before
06:18 - do you want to retry the thing retry you
06:21 - retried a thing
06:24 - and cancel you cancelled a thing
06:29 - okay the next one we have is ask yes
06:32 - no so we can get some user input
06:36 - if it's a yes or a no
06:40 - so this returns a boolean value a true
06:43 - or false value
06:44 - so message box dot
06:48 - ask yes no
06:53 - and we'll set the title title equals
06:57 - ask yes or no
07:01 - and a message
07:06 - do you like cake
07:13 - so let's put this within an if statement
07:15 - because this returns
07:17 - a true or false answer print
07:22 - i like cake too
07:27 - else they answered no then if this is
07:30 - false
07:31 - print why do you
07:34 - not like cake
07:41 - and i'm missing a colon there we go
07:45 - so if they click yes this returns true
07:48 - and we execute this line of code
07:50 - i like cake 2. if they answer no
07:53 - it's going to execute this else
07:55 - statement do you like cake
07:57 - no why do you not like cake now what we
08:00 - have next
08:01 - is ask question and this doesn't return
08:04 - a boolean value of true or false
08:06 - it actually returns a string of yes or
08:09 - no
08:09 - so this is message box
08:13 - dot ask question
08:16 - and we'll set the title to ask
08:20 - question and a message
08:23 - message equals do
08:26 - you like pi
08:31 - so let's just print the result what this
08:33 - returns
08:35 - so print everything within here
08:39 - so like i said this doesn't return it
08:41 - true or false but
08:42 - yes or no
08:46 - so what we could do is assign the
08:48 - response
08:49 - to a variable such as answer
08:52 - so answer equals whatever the answer is
08:56 - whatever they
08:57 - click whatever button they click on so
08:59 - if
09:00 - our answer is equal to yes
09:04 - we'll print a message print
09:08 - i like pie too
09:13 - then else the answer is no
09:17 - will print why do
09:20 - you not like pie
09:26 - so do you like pie yes i like pie too do
09:29 - you like pie
09:30 - no why do you not like pie so this next
09:34 - one
09:34 - is probably the most difficult it's ask
09:37 - yes no cancel
09:41 - so it's message box dot
09:44 - ask yes no cancel it's this last one
09:48 - so let's set the title title equals
09:52 - whatever you want yes no
09:55 - cancel and a message
09:59 - message equals
10:03 - do you like to code
10:07 - so let's just print the results what
10:10 - this returns
10:12 - so print everything just so we can take
10:15 - a look
10:17 - so the possible answers are
10:20 - true false
10:24 - or none so we can just run some if
10:27 - statements for this
10:30 - so if
10:33 - answer is equal to true
10:37 - what we can do is print
10:41 - you like to code
10:46 - oh but we need to assign this to an
10:48 - answer so answer
10:49 - equals all of this
10:55 - else if
10:59 - answer is equal to false
11:03 - let's print
11:06 - then why are you watching
11:09 - a video on coding
11:14 - and then else the response is none so we
11:17 - can just use an else statement
11:18 - so else
11:22 - you have dodged the question
11:28 - let's try this do you like to code
11:32 - yes you like to code uh but this should
11:35 - really be
11:35 - a smiley face right do you like to code
11:40 - no then why are you watching a video on
11:42 - coding
11:43 - do you like to code cancel you have
11:46 - dodged the question
11:48 - no one other option available to you is
11:50 - that you can change
11:51 - the icon that you're using so let's say
11:53 - that we want to change this icon so
11:55 - right now
11:56 - it is currently this question mark so we
11:59 - can set this to
12:00 - one of a few preset icons so icon
12:04 - equals and let's set this to warning
12:08 - so instead of that question mark we get
12:09 - this yellow exclamation point
12:12 - and you can also use info
12:20 - it's just an i and error
12:28 - so do it fits best for you all right
12:31 - well
12:31 - that's the basics on message boxes in
12:34 - python if you'd like a copy of all this
12:36 - code
12:36 - i'll post all of this in the comments
12:38 - down below but yeah that's the basics of
12:40 - message boxes in python
12:43 - hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you
12:46 - learn something new
12:47 - then you can help me help you in three
12:50 - easy steps
12:51 - by smashing that like button drop a
12:53 - comment down below
12:55 - and subscribe if you'd like to become a
12:56 - fellow bro
13:12 - [Music]
13:18 - you
