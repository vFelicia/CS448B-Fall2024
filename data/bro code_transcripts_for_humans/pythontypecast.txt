00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's your
00:01 - bro hope you're doing well
00:03 - and in this video i'm going to teach you
00:04 - guys all about typecasting in python so
00:06 - sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:11 - if you find this video helpful please
00:13 - remember to like
00:14 - comment and subscribe your support will
00:16 - help keep this channel running
00:18 - all right welcome back everybody i have
00:20 - a super quick video for you guys today
00:22 - on the subject of typecasting now
00:24 - typecasting is the ability to convert
00:26 - the data type of a value to another data
00:29 - type
00:30 - here's an example that i've written
00:31 - already i'm just going to paste it
00:33 - i have three variables for this example
00:35 - x
00:36 - y and z x contains one this is a
00:39 - whole integer into for short y contains
00:42 - 2.0 this is a floating point number
00:45 - float4 short you can tell it's a float
00:47 - because it ends with a decimal portion
00:49 - and z contains a string of three a
00:52 - string is a series of characters
00:54 - and you can tell it's a string because
00:55 - it's surrounded with a set of quotes and
00:58 - remember with strings we cannot normally
01:00 - perform
01:00 - math on strings so i have three print
01:04 - statements for x
01:05 - y and z and as you would expect they
01:07 - contain the values of
01:08 - one two point zero and three now let's
01:11 - begin by converting both
01:12 - y and z to the integer data type via
01:16 - typecasting in order to perform
01:17 - typecasting on a value or variable type
01:20 - that value or variable and surround this
01:22 - with a set of parentheses
01:24 - whoops i missed and then pre-save this
01:27 - with the data type you'd like to convert
01:29 - this value or variable to
01:31 - i would like to convert y to an integer
01:33 - and then you can use this for whatever
01:35 - you need
01:35 - so i'm going to replace y within my
01:38 - print statement
01:39 - with y after we typecast it as an
01:42 - integer
01:43 - and this will display 1 2 not 2.0 it's
01:46 - the
01:47 - whole integer of 2 and then 3.
01:50 - so this is not a permanent change if you
01:53 - need to make this as a permanent change
01:56 - to y you'd have to reassign it so let's
01:58 - say
01:59 - y equals y and then we're going to
02:02 - typecast
02:03 - y so let's run this with a set of
02:05 - parentheses and precede this with the
02:06 - data type we'd like to convert
02:08 - y2 so now y is a whole integer
02:12 - and then we will print y without the
02:14 - typecast this time
02:16 - and our result is one two three
02:19 - now z z is storing a string and with
02:22 - strings we cannot normally perform any
02:25 - math on strings
02:26 - for example within my print statement i
02:28 - will state z
02:29 - times three you would think that the
02:31 - result would be nine right
02:33 - well you're wrong it's going to print
02:35 - three three times
02:37 - if you need to convert a string to a
02:40 - int or a float you would just have to
02:42 - typecast it so this time let's type cast
02:45 - z as an integer z int
02:48 - and we will type cast z as an integer
02:52 - so then if we have z times 3 the result
02:55 - is now
02:56 - 9 instead of 333 so that's the basic
02:59 - formula for type casting now let's
03:02 - convert these to
03:03 - floating point numbers but let's include
03:05 - x as well because
03:06 - x is feeling left out so let's convert x
03:09 - to
03:09 - a floating point number so float
03:12 - parenthesis and we will surround
03:14 - this with x and display x
03:17 - and actually let's convert y and z to
03:20 - floats as well because why not
03:23 - so the results are now 1.0 2.0 and 9.0
03:28 - remember that we multiplied z times
03:30 - three
03:31 - and then if we need to convert these
03:33 - values to a string
03:35 - we would use the string cast
03:40 - so the results now are 1 2.0
03:44 - and 333 now you might be thinking to
03:47 - yourself
03:48 - when would you need to convert an
03:49 - integer or a float to a string
03:52 - here's a situation let's say within our
03:54 - print statements we need to print
03:56 - these variables along with another
03:58 - string so within our print statement
04:00 - let's say x is plus
04:03 - x we would like to display these
04:05 - together and let me copy this and do the
04:08 - same thing for
04:09 - y we'll say y is plus
04:12 - y you cannot normally display a string
04:15 - along with an integer or a float because
04:18 - we're using some string concatenation
04:20 - so this will result in a compilation
04:22 - error can only concatenate
04:24 - string not int to string so that's a
04:28 - situation
04:29 - in which you might need to use
04:30 - typecasting to convert an integer
04:33 - or float to a string so let's display x
04:36 - and y as strings via typecasting
04:39 - so we'll surround x and y with a set of
04:41 - parenthesis and precede this with the
04:43 - data type we'd like to convert these
04:45 - values to
04:46 - we would like to convert x and y to both
04:48 - strings and now this will compile and
04:50 - run
04:50 - just fine well everybody that's the
04:52 - basics of type casting
04:54 - if you would like a copy of all my code
04:56 - i will post everything in the comments
