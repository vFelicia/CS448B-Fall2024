00:00 - hey everybody today I will explain text
00:02 - formatting in html text formatting gifs
00:05 - text special emphasis we can create bold
00:08 - text italic text underline text so on
00:12 - and so forth let's begin let's create a
00:15 - pair of paragraph tags
00:17 - and between this first set of paragraph
00:19 - tags let's type this is normal text
00:25 - let's copy this line of markup and then
00:28 - paste it like 10 times
00:32 - okay I lost count whatever text you
00:34 - would like to add emphasis to you
00:36 - surround that with a pair of tags but
00:38 - there's different pairs of tags that
00:40 - have different effects for a bold effect
00:42 - we use a pair of B tags let's surround
00:45 - it normal in the second line with B then
00:48 - change normal to the word bold
00:52 - this is bold text
00:55 - I is for italic
00:57 - so let's surround the next line with I
01:02 - this is italic text
01:07 - then underlined as you
01:14 - this is
01:16 - underlined text
01:19 - deleted text
01:21 - we would type Del
01:27 - this is deleted text
01:31 - big
01:36 - this is big text
01:39 - so this text is a little bit bigger than
01:41 - the other text surrounding it
01:44 - then they're small
01:52 - this is small text
01:55 - subscript
01:58 - type sub
02:01 - this is subscript text I misspelled that
02:06 - there the subscript text is smaller and
02:10 - it's just underneath the other text
02:11 - surrounding it
02:13 - then their superscript
02:16 - type sup like you're saying Sup like
02:19 - what's up
02:21 - this is superscript text
02:26 - then you have mono spaced
02:28 - which is TT
02:33 - this is mono spaced text
02:38 - oops I forgot to close it this is a good
02:40 - example of why you should add closing
02:42 - tags because the markup will Cascade
02:44 - through the rest of your document so be
02:46 - sure to close any opening tags
02:49 - all right then the last one is Mark
02:54 - creates a highlight effect
02:57 - kind of like you're taking a highlighter
02:59 - and highlighting some text you can use
03:01 - CSS to change the color too
03:04 - I haven't really discussed CSS yet but
03:06 - to add a little bit of inline CSS within
03:09 - the opening mark tag
03:10 - take the style attribute set that equal
03:14 - to take the background Dash color
03:19 - colon then we can pick a color how about
03:21 - light green I think that would look good
03:24 - and our highlight effect is now light
03:27 - green or pick some other color of your
03:29 - choosing we'll discuss colors more when
03:31 - we reach CSS all right everybody so that
03:34 - is text formatting text formatting gives
03:37 - text special emphasis you can create
03:40 - text that is bold italic underline
03:42 - deleted big small subscript superscript
03:44 - model space and highlighted text and
03:46 - well that is text formatting in HTML
