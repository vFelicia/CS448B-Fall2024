00:00 - hey everybody in this video I'm going to
00:02 - show you how we can update and delete
00:04 - data from a table
00:06 - in my example we have a table of
00:08 - employees however Sheldon Plankton is
00:11 - missing some information and hourly pay
00:13 - and a higher date let's update those
00:15 - fields to update some data in a table we
00:18 - would use the update keyword
00:22 - the name of the table
00:24 - employees in my example
00:26 - then set which column would we like to
00:30 - interact with first let's interact with
00:32 - hourly pay set hourly
00:36 - pay
00:38 - let's pay Plankton ten dollars and 25
00:41 - cents per hour we should probably add a
00:44 - where Clause I need to specifically
00:47 - select Plankton where
00:50 - let's select his employee ID where
00:53 - employee ID equals six
00:58 - then semicolon to end the statement
01:01 - you could also select Plankton by his
01:03 - first name or last name as well when I
01:06 - execute the script
01:09 - Plankton's hourly pay is now 10.25 cents
01:13 - per hour
01:14 - to update multiple columns you can
01:18 - change more than one field at once after
01:21 - your first change you can add a comma
01:24 - then change another field let's change
01:27 - Plankton's higher date to be the
01:29 - following higher date equals
01:34 - 10
01:36 - 23-0 Dash
01:38 - zero seven
01:39 - I'll make his hourly pay 10.50 I'm
01:42 - feeling generous
01:46 - here we are Plankton's hourly pay is now
01:48 - ten dollars fifty cents his higher date
01:51 - is January 7th 2023.
01:55 - to set a field to null meaning no value
01:58 - you would just say equals null for
02:01 - example let's take Plankton's higher
02:03 - date
02:05 - set the higher date equal to null
02:10 - Plankton's higher date is now null
02:13 - so maybe we're gonna fire him or
02:15 - something
02:16 - in this next example I'll give you a
02:18 - demonstration but you don't want to
02:19 - follow along to update all of the rows
02:22 - within a column you would exclude the
02:25 - where clause
02:26 - if I were to set hourly pay equal to
02:29 - 10.25 that would affect all of the rows
02:32 - after executing this statement
02:35 - the hourly pay for everybody is now
02:38 - 10.25. that's an example of how you
02:41 - could set a column to be one consistent
02:43 - value
02:45 - to delete a row from a table
02:47 - you would type delete
02:50 - from the name of the table
02:53 - now don't write just the statement it
02:56 - will delete all rows in your table
02:57 - here's an example do not do this I will
03:01 - delete from employees
03:04 - there my whole table is gone do not do
03:06 - this be sure to add a where Clause when
03:09 - deleting from a table otherwise this
03:11 - will delete all your rows where
03:14 - employee ID
03:16 - equals six
03:20 - yep and Plankton is no longer there all
03:23 - right everybody that is a super quick
03:25 - video on how to update and delete data
03:28 - from a table
