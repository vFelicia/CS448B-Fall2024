00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's your
00:01 - bro here hope you're doing well and in
00:02 - this video i'm going to be teaching you
00:04 - guys how we can create
00:05 - radio buttons in python so sit back
00:07 - relax and enjoy the show
00:11 - if you find this video helpful please
00:12 - remember to like
00:14 - comment and subscribe your support will
00:16 - help keep this channel running
00:18 - okay everybody let's create some radio
00:20 - buttons now these are similar to check
00:22 - boxes but you can only select one from
00:25 - any single grouping
00:26 - so let's pretend that i'm buying you
00:28 - lunch and you can only select
00:30 - one item from a menu you can select
00:32 - either a
00:33 - slice of pizza a hamburger or a hot dog
00:36 - so let's begin by creating a list i will
00:38 - call this list
00:39 - food food equals
00:43 - pizza hamburger
00:48 - hot dog and let's create a window
00:51 - window equals tk followed by
00:55 - window dot main loop
00:59 - so to create a radio button we'll need a
01:00 - name so i'll call this radio button
01:03 - radio button equals radio button
01:07 - and we're going to be adding this to our
01:09 - window and we're going to put this
01:11 - within
01:12 - a for loop so we're going to iterate
01:14 - through all of the items within our list
01:17 - so let's create a for loop so we'll save
01:19 - for
01:21 - index in range
01:26 - length of food
01:29 - so this is going to iterate once through
01:32 - all of the elements within our list
01:34 - so when we run this it's going to create
01:37 - three
01:38 - radio buttons for us because we're
01:40 - instantiating
01:41 - one radio button for each item in the
01:43 - list
01:44 - now what i'm going to do is set the text
01:48 - equal to
01:51 - our list of food at a certain index
01:54 - so when we first run this for loop it's
01:57 - going to be zero for the index
01:59 - then one and then two and then so on and
02:02 - so forth
02:03 - for each item within our list and then
02:06 - we just need to pack this
02:08 - so radio button dot
02:11 - pack and then let's take a look at this
02:16 - alright so here are all of the radio
02:18 - buttons that we have
02:20 - currently they're all selected though so
02:22 - we'll need to link these within a single
02:24 - grouping
02:25 - the next thing we'll add is a variable
02:27 - and we'll set this equal to
02:28 - x and we'll need to declare this after
02:31 - we create an instance of our window
02:33 - so x equals int var
02:36 - so this will hold an integer object
02:39 - so these are all within the same
02:42 - grouping
02:42 - however if we try to run this again and
02:45 - select one of these options
02:47 - they all become selected so we're going
02:49 - to need to give
02:50 - each of these individual radio buttons
02:52 - their own
02:53 - value because right now they're all
02:55 - sharing the same value
02:57 - so we can add value equals
03:00 - whatever the index is currently so the
03:03 - first
03:04 - item within our list of food is going to
03:06 - have an
03:07 - index value of zero then one
03:10 - then two so let's try that again and you
03:13 - can see by default it's
03:15 - zero so pizza is already selected then
03:17 - we can select either hamburger or hot
03:19 - dog
03:20 - but we can only select one so that's
03:22 - kind of what we want then
03:24 - so do you guys usually know how i call
03:26 - the config function after each change
03:28 - that i make for an object
03:30 - well that's because i like to add
03:31 - comments just for teaching purposes
03:33 - for what each change does however it
03:36 - might be easier for you instead of
03:38 - calling the config function a bunch of
03:39 - times
03:40 - just to list all of the changes within
03:43 - the parentheses when you create an
03:44 - instance of the object that you're
03:46 - working with
03:47 - however just for teaching purposes i'm
03:49 - going to put this all within
03:51 - separate lines that allows me to add
03:53 - some comments
03:54 - so i think i'm going to start doing that
03:56 - from now on
03:57 - so what this does is that this adds text
04:00 - to radio buttons
04:04 - and this groups radio buttons
04:08 - together if they share
04:11 - the same variable
04:15 - so if you wanted a completely different
04:17 - grouping of radio buttons you can give
04:19 - them a different variable
04:21 - like y and what this line does
04:24 - is that this assigns
04:27 - each radio button a
04:32 - different value
04:37 - all right so let's make some cosmetic
04:39 - changes to our radio buttons so right
04:42 - now
04:43 - they are centered let's anchor these to
04:45 - the west
04:46 - so we'll place this within the pack
04:48 - function so
04:50 - anchor equals w alternatively you can
04:54 - just say capital w without
04:56 - the quotes this would also work too
04:59 - so now they're all lined up let's add
05:01 - some padding
05:03 - so i'm going to add pad x
05:06 - and i'll set this to 25
05:09 - and this adds
05:12 - padding on x
05:16 - axis
05:19 - let's also change the font
05:23 - so we'll say font
05:27 - equals maybe i'll pick impact for a font
05:30 - style
05:31 - and set the font size to 50.
05:36 - and now we can actually read these
05:37 - because the font is large enough
05:40 - now let's add some images so let's
05:42 - create some photo images
05:44 - you'll want to be sure to create these
05:46 - after you create your instance of your
05:48 - window
05:49 - so let's create a pizza image first
05:52 - pizza image
05:53 - equals photo image
05:57 - file equals the file path or the file
06:00 - name
06:01 - and my file is pizza.png and it kind of
06:04 - looks like this
06:05 - it's just the pizza emoji so
06:08 - pizza dot png
06:11 - and then i'll do the same thing for
06:13 - hamburger and hot dog
06:16 - so this will be hamburger image
06:20 - file equals hamburger.png
06:24 - and then hotdog image
06:34 - and this is what the other emojis look
06:37 - like
06:39 - and then let's create a list of the
06:42 - photo images that we have
06:43 - i'll call this food images
06:46 - equals then the names of these images
06:51 - pizza image hamburger image
06:56 - and hot dog image
07:00 - so then we can set the image for each
07:02 - radio button
07:04 - image equals
07:07 - the name of the list food images
07:10 - followed by
07:11 - the index that we're currently on within
07:14 - our for loop
07:16 - so this adds image
07:19 - to radio button and
07:22 - let's test this cool here's our images
07:27 - now if you want some images as well as
07:29 - text you'll have to use compound
07:32 - so let's add that next so i'm just going
07:35 - to add a comma
07:36 - followed by compound
07:42 - equals let's say left so this will add
07:46 - the image
07:47 - to the left of the text
07:52 - adds image and text i'll just say left
07:56 - side
07:58 - so this will display both an image and
08:01 - text
08:03 - so with these radio buttons you can
08:05 - eliminate these
08:06 - circle indicators and there's actually a
08:09 - way to do that
08:10 - so what we'll add if you want to get rid
08:13 - of those
08:14 - is indicator
08:17 - on equals zero
08:20 - so this will i should say eliminate
08:27 - circle indicators
08:31 - so it's going to change these to these
08:33 - push buttons
08:34 - however they are going to be of uneven
08:37 - size you can set the width
08:39 - if you want to so we'll do that
08:42 - so we'll say width equals
08:46 - what about 75 i'm not sure if that's a
08:49 - good size or not
08:52 - okay that's way too small let's try 375.
08:58 - so yeah you can have some push buttons
09:00 - if you want to if you don't like the
09:01 - circle indicators
09:03 - so this sets width
09:07 - of radio buttons
09:10 - now let's actually set a function to
09:13 - uh be called when we click one of these
09:16 - buttons
09:17 - so let's call this function maybe order
09:19 - like we're ordering one of these items
09:23 - so d e f we'll call this order like
09:26 - we're ordering something
09:29 - and what we'll do is just a few if
09:30 - statements because i'm feeling lazy
09:33 - so we'll just say if x that's
09:36 - the value that's going to be stored
09:39 - because each of these radio buttons is
09:42 - grouped together by the variable x
09:45 - if x dot get
09:48 - is equal to zero that's our first index
09:51 - for pizza what we'll display is
09:56 - print you
10:00 - oops you ordered
10:04 - pizza then we'll just add
10:07 - else if x dot get
10:12 - is equal to one we will print
10:17 - you ordered a hamburger
10:25 - and then else if two
10:30 - you ordered a hot dog
10:36 - else
10:40 - print huh
10:44 - so there's probably a more efficient way
10:46 - to write this however i was just feeling
10:48 - lazy and this is probably the best way
10:50 - to keep this simple and easy to
10:52 - understand
10:53 - so let's try this now oh however we need
10:55 - to set the command
10:57 - for our radio buttons so
11:00 - command equals then the
11:03 - function name which is order and make
11:06 - sure you do not add the parentheses
11:09 - so don't do this do that
11:12 - and this will set
11:15 - command of
11:18 - radio button to function
11:24 - all right let's test this so if we click
11:27 - on pizza it says you ordered pizza
11:30 - you ordered a hamburger and you ordered
11:32 - a hot dog
11:34 - okay everybody so that's the basics of
11:36 - radio buttons if you would like a copy
11:38 - of all this code i'll post all of this
11:40 - in the comments down below
11:41 - but yeah that's the basics of radio
11:43 - buttons in python
11:46 - hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you
11:49 - learn something new
11:50 - then you can help me help you in three
11:53 - easy steps
11:54 - by smashing that like button drop a

Cleaned transcript:

hey what's going on everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to be teaching you guys how we can create radio buttons in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running okay everybody let's create some radio buttons now these are similar to check boxes but you can only select one from any single grouping so let's pretend that i'm buying you lunch and you can only select one item from a menu you can select either a slice of pizza a hamburger or a hot dog so let's begin by creating a list i will call this list food food equals pizza hamburger hot dog and let's create a window window equals tk followed by window dot main loop so to create a radio button we'll need a name so i'll call this radio button radio button equals radio button and we're going to be adding this to our window and we're going to put this within a for loop so we're going to iterate through all of the items within our list so let's create a for loop so we'll save for index in range length of food so this is going to iterate once through all of the elements within our list so when we run this it's going to create three radio buttons for us because we're instantiating one radio button for each item in the list now what i'm going to do is set the text equal to our list of food at a certain index so when we first run this for loop it's going to be zero for the index then one and then two and then so on and so forth for each item within our list and then we just need to pack this so radio button dot pack and then let's take a look at this alright so here are all of the radio buttons that we have currently they're all selected though so we'll need to link these within a single grouping the next thing we'll add is a variable and we'll set this equal to x and we'll need to declare this after we create an instance of our window so x equals int var so this will hold an integer object so these are all within the same grouping however if we try to run this again and select one of these options they all become selected so we're going to need to give each of these individual radio buttons their own value because right now they're all sharing the same value so we can add value equals whatever the index is currently so the first item within our list of food is going to have an index value of zero then one then two so let's try that again and you can see by default it's zero so pizza is already selected then we can select either hamburger or hot dog but we can only select one so that's kind of what we want then so do you guys usually know how i call the config function after each change that i make for an object well that's because i like to add comments just for teaching purposes for what each change does however it might be easier for you instead of calling the config function a bunch of times just to list all of the changes within the parentheses when you create an instance of the object that you're working with however just for teaching purposes i'm going to put this all within separate lines that allows me to add some comments so i think i'm going to start doing that from now on so what this does is that this adds text to radio buttons and this groups radio buttons together if they share the same variable so if you wanted a completely different grouping of radio buttons you can give them a different variable like y and what this line does is that this assigns each radio button a different value all right so let's make some cosmetic changes to our radio buttons so right now they are centered let's anchor these to the west so we'll place this within the pack function so anchor equals w alternatively you can just say capital w without the quotes this would also work too so now they're all lined up let's add some padding so i'm going to add pad x and i'll set this to 25 and this adds padding on x axis let's also change the font so we'll say font equals maybe i'll pick impact for a font style and set the font size to 50. and now we can actually read these because the font is large enough now let's add some images so let's create some photo images you'll want to be sure to create these after you create your instance of your window so let's create a pizza image first pizza image equals photo image file equals the file path or the file name and my file is pizza.png and it kind of looks like this it's just the pizza emoji so pizza dot png and then i'll do the same thing for hamburger and hot dog so this will be hamburger image file equals hamburger.png and then hotdog image and this is what the other emojis look like and then let's create a list of the photo images that we have i'll call this food images equals then the names of these images pizza image hamburger image and hot dog image so then we can set the image for each radio button image equals the name of the list food images followed by the index that we're currently on within our for loop so this adds image to radio button and let's test this cool here's our images now if you want some images as well as text you'll have to use compound so let's add that next so i'm just going to add a comma followed by compound equals let's say left so this will add the image to the left of the text adds image and text i'll just say left side so this will display both an image and text so with these radio buttons you can eliminate these circle indicators and there's actually a way to do that so what we'll add if you want to get rid of those is indicator on equals zero so this will i should say eliminate circle indicators so it's going to change these to these push buttons however they are going to be of uneven size you can set the width if you want to so we'll do that so we'll say width equals what about 75 i'm not sure if that's a good size or not okay that's way too small let's try 375. so yeah you can have some push buttons if you want to if you don't like the circle indicators so this sets width of radio buttons now let's actually set a function to uh be called when we click one of these buttons so let's call this function maybe order like we're ordering one of these items so d e f we'll call this order like we're ordering something and what we'll do is just a few if statements because i'm feeling lazy so we'll just say if x that's the value that's going to be stored because each of these radio buttons is grouped together by the variable x if x dot get is equal to zero that's our first index for pizza what we'll display is print you oops you ordered pizza then we'll just add else if x dot get is equal to one we will print you ordered a hamburger and then else if two you ordered a hot dog else print huh so there's probably a more efficient way to write this however i was just feeling lazy and this is probably the best way to keep this simple and easy to understand so let's try this now oh however we need to set the command for our radio buttons so command equals then the function name which is order and make sure you do not add the parentheses so don't do this do that and this will set command of radio button to function all right let's test this so if we click on pizza it says you ordered pizza you ordered a hamburger and you ordered a hot dog okay everybody so that's the basics of radio buttons if you would like a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of radio buttons in python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a
