00:00 - hey how's it going everybody it's bro
00:02 - here hope you're doing well and in this
00:04 - video I'm going to be teaching you guys
00:05 - about two-dimensional arrays and C++ and
00:09 - at the end of this video we're going to
00:10 - be working on a project where we can
00:12 - create a virtual computer keyboard it
00:16 - currently doesn't do anything all it
00:17 - does is look pretty but I'll teach you
00:19 - guys how to create this using a
00:20 - two-dimensional array so let's get
00:22 - started
00:25 - before you reach the end of this video
00:27 - make sure to LIKE comment and subscribe
00:30 - so that we together can challenge and
00:32 - defeat the mighty YouTube algorithm
00:36 - think of a basic array as one
00:39 - dimensional as in it only contains a
00:41 - single row of elements while a
00:43 - two-dimensional array can contain many
00:46 - rows of elements think of it as an array
00:48 - of arrays so on your screen right now I
00:51 - have a basic one-dimensional array well
00:54 - we can turn this into a multi
00:56 - dimensional array by adding more arrays
00:58 - to it but there's a few changes that we
01:00 - have to make so if this is going to be a
01:02 - two-dimensional array we need two sets
01:05 - of straight brackets right next to the
01:06 - array name and we're going to need to
01:08 - place the amount of rows and columns
01:11 - that we have in our multi dimensional
01:13 - array into each of these straight
01:15 - brackets so this is going to end up
01:17 - looking like some sort of grid or matrix
01:20 - instead of just a single row so we are
01:22 - going to create multiple rows and
01:24 - separate each with a comma and surround
01:27 - our entire set of rows and columns with
01:30 - another set of curly braces so all I'm
01:32 - going to do is just add another row so
01:34 - we need another set of curly braces and
01:36 - I'll put some more numbers in here so 4
01:39 - 5 6 7 I'm just going in order we'll
01:42 - separate each array with a comma then
01:44 - we'll add another array so we need
01:46 - another set of curly braces and I'll
01:48 - type in 8 9 10 11 all right now what we
01:53 - need to do is surround all these rows
01:56 - with its own set of curly braces so
01:59 - we'll put that here and here alright so
02:02 - this might be difficult to see it what I
02:04 - like to do with 2d arrays is just to put
02:06 - each of these rows on a new line just so
02:09 - it's easier to see and work with
02:14 - okay so what you see now is that this is
02:18 - starting to look like some sort of grid
02:20 - which is kind of the point of a
02:22 - two-dimensional array
02:23 - so there's rows and columns to this with
02:27 - the first set of straight brackets we're
02:29 - going to place the amount of rows that
02:31 - we have which is 1 2 3 so we're going to
02:34 - place 3 here and this set of straight
02:37 - brackets is for the columns and we have
02:39 - 1 2 3 4 so we'll place 4 here and that
02:43 - ladies and gentlemen is a
02:44 - two-dimensional array now if you ever
02:47 - want to determine how many elements that
02:49 - you have in your 2d array just multiply
02:51 - the amount of rows by the amount of
02:52 - columns that you have so in this example
02:54 - we have three rows times four columns so
02:57 - that's 12 elements so here we have 12
03:00 - but remember that we start with 0 though
03:02 - so it's going to be the numbers 0
03:04 - through 11 let's say that you want to
03:07 - work with or display one of these
03:09 - elements in the two-dimensional array
03:10 - you'll need to retrieve that specific
03:12 - element so it's going to be very similar
03:14 - to a one-dimensional array but there's
03:16 - one extra step so let's say that we just
03:18 - want to display one of these elements so
03:20 - well just see out then we need to type
03:23 - in the name of the array so for my
03:25 - example the array name is numbers but we
03:27 - need two sets of straight brackets we're
03:30 - going to place the row number here and
03:32 - the column number here of what we want
03:34 - to retrieve so let's say that we want to
03:36 - retrieve this number six so we need to
03:39 - find out which row that it's in and
03:41 - remember that we start with 0 so this is
03:43 - row number 0 and this is row number 1 so
03:46 - we're going to place one here and then
03:48 - let's count the columns so this is
03:50 - column number 0 column number one column
03:53 - number two so we'll place two here
03:56 - because we want this six and that's
03:58 - pretty much it
03:59 - let's run this just prove that I'm not a
04:01 - liar yep here's our number at 6 all
04:05 - right
04:05 - here's an exercise for you what do we
04:08 - place here for the rows and columns if
04:10 - we want to retrieve this number 11 take
04:13 - a moment to figure it out yep
04:16 - that's right we're going to place 2 here
04:18 - and then we're going to place the number
04:20 - 3 let's test this out
04:24 - yep there's our number 11 so let's say
04:28 - that you want to display all the
04:30 - elements of this array well one easy way
04:32 - to do that is to use a nested loop will
04:35 - have a outer loop that's in charge of
04:37 - the row that we're on and an inner loop
04:40 - that's in charge of the columns so for
04:42 - the statements for the outer loop this
04:44 - is what we're right so usually you can
04:45 - write it I and set this equal to zero
04:48 - right we could do that but I think for
04:50 - this demonstration I'm actually going to
04:52 - rename I to row all right and then we're
04:56 - going to continue this while our row is
04:58 - less than the amount of rows that we
05:01 - have which is three and then we're just
05:04 - going to increment our row by one and
05:06 - it's going to be basically the same
05:08 - thing for the columns so we can say int
05:11 - column equals zero we'll continue this
05:15 - column as long as column is less than
05:18 - the amount of columns that we have which
05:20 - is four and then we're going to
05:22 - increment our column by one so within
05:25 - the inner for loop what we'll type is C
05:29 - out and we're just going to display our
05:31 - array numbers at the index of row as
05:35 - well as the index of column and then
05:40 - inside the outer loop we'll just want to
05:42 - move down to the next line we can easily
05:43 - just do that with C out en DL and before
05:47 - we run this I'm just going to add a
05:48 - space after each of these elements just
05:52 - so everything's lined up nicely
05:54 - okay let's run this yeah and here is our
05:58 - two-dimensional array it got kind of
06:00 - funky with these two-digit numbers but
06:03 - you can still see that it's a grid of
06:06 - some sort a matrix of rows and columns
06:08 - that contains values so that's the
06:11 - basics of two-dimensional arrays if you
06:13 - would like to continue we're going to
06:14 - work on a project where we create a
06:16 - virtual keyboard kind of like the
06:18 - keyboard that's in front of your
06:19 - computer right now assuming you're not
06:21 - on a mobile device so if you want to
06:23 - continue let's work on that project
06:30 - well welcome back so for this project
06:33 - we're going to create a virtual computer
06:35 - keyboard maybe not the entire thing but
06:37 - we'll just include maybe the numbers and
06:40 - the letters and some of the other
06:42 - special characters and then afterwards
06:44 - if you want to go crazy and add like an
06:46 - escape button a backspace button and
06:48 - turn shift you could do so but I'll just
06:50 - keep it simple for now then you can go
06:52 - crazy afterwards so let's begin by
06:54 - making a 2d array of maybe characters so
06:58 - we'll make this up the charred data type
06:59 - and let's call this 2d array maybe
07:02 - keyboard and then we need two sets of
07:05 - straight brackets and we're going to set
07:08 - this equal to then all of the keys that
07:10 - we want to add to this keyboard so I'm
07:13 - just going to stick with the numbers 1
07:15 - through 0 well 1 through 9 and 0 and
07:18 - then the first three rows of letters
07:21 - so that's qwe rty so on and so forth all
07:25 - the way until the last row of letters so
07:28 - I'm actually going to fast forward this
07:30 - video because it's gonna take a lot of
07:31 - time to actually enter in all these
07:33 - individual characters so feel free to
07:35 - pause the video otherwise I should have
07:38 - all of this code completed and post it
07:40 - in the comments down below so you can
07:41 - always copy this portion of the 2d array
07:44 - if you don't feel like typing this by
07:45 - hand so I'm just going to fast forward
07:47 - the video until the point in time where
07:49 - I already type out all of these
07:51 - individual characters and then I'll walk
07:53 - you through it a few moments later
07:55 - alright well welcome back again so here
07:59 - is our two-dimensional array of
08:00 - characters the first row is the numbers
08:03 - then we have qwe rty blah blah blah blah
08:07 - the second row is asdf blah blah blah
08:10 - then Z X C V and then we had some extra
08:13 - space so I just added a few special
08:16 - characters here alright so then with the
08:18 - straight brackets we need to list the
08:20 - amount of rows and columns that we have
08:22 - so we have 4 rows we're going to place
08:25 - the number 4 within the first set of
08:27 - straight brackets and we have 10 columns
08:30 - so we're going to place 10 here so this
08:33 - is now our 2d array now let's say that
08:36 - we want to display this we're going to
08:37 - use a nested loop to do this kind of
08:40 - like what we did before so we need an
08:42 - outer loop for
08:43 - the Rose and an inner loop for the
08:46 - columns so what we'll type in here is
08:48 - maybe int then let's go with rose again
08:52 - so into row then we'll continue this as
08:55 - long as Rho is less than the amount of
08:58 - rows that we have so we can put four
09:00 - here all right and then we'll increment
09:04 - our row and we'll do the same thing but
09:06 - with columns so int column equals zero
09:11 - then column is less than ten all right
09:17 - and then column plus plus and then we
09:21 - are going to display each of these
09:23 - characters so we will see out our
09:26 - keyboard at whatever our row is as well
09:33 - as our column and then we'll just add a
09:36 - space between each of these characters
09:39 - when we display them all right and then
09:42 - we just need to move down to the next
09:43 - line so we'll place that within the
09:46 - outer for loop so I'll just see out en
09:50 - DL okay we should be good then let's run
09:53 - this yep and here is our virtual
09:59 - keyboard so someday if you ever learn
10:02 - about graphics for C++ you could easily
10:04 - replace all of these individual
10:06 - characters with labelled buttons and
10:08 - then you can click on each of these
10:09 - buttons to actually enter in a character
10:12 - or letter so that would be really useful
10:14 - then one day so basically a 2d array can
10:19 - be used to display like a grid or matrix
10:21 - of information whether it's like a table
10:24 - a chart a grid a 2d array is pretty
10:28 - useful because you can organize it in
10:30 - rows and columns so that's basically how
10:32 - a 2d array works if you would like a
10:35 - copy of all the code that we worked on
10:36 - I'll post it in the comments down below
10:38 - and if you're looking for additional
10:40 - practice why don't you post a program
10:43 - that you worked on that involves a 2d
10:45 - array but yeah that is how to do rays
10:47 - work in C++ hey you yeah I'm talking to
10:52 - you if you learn something new then you
10:54 - can
10:55 - help me help you in three easy steps
10:58 - by smashing that like button drop a

Cleaned transcript:

hey how's it going everybody it's bro here hope you're doing well and in this video I'm going to be teaching you guys about twodimensional arrays and C++ and at the end of this video we're going to be working on a project where we can create a virtual computer keyboard it currently doesn't do anything all it does is look pretty but I'll teach you guys how to create this using a twodimensional array so let's get started before you reach the end of this video make sure to LIKE comment and subscribe so that we together can challenge and defeat the mighty YouTube algorithm think of a basic array as one dimensional as in it only contains a single row of elements while a twodimensional array can contain many rows of elements think of it as an array of arrays so on your screen right now I have a
