00:00 - hey what's going on everybody today I'm
00:01 - going to explain pseudo elements in CSS
00:04 - pseudo elements are keywords added after
00:07 - a selector that are used to style a
00:10 - specific part of an element you have a
00:12 - selector for example H1 then two colons
00:15 - then a pseudo element one you might see
00:18 - is first Dash letter
00:21 - we can add some CSS properties and style
00:23 - the first letter of our H1 element
00:25 - that's the formula selector two colons
00:28 - pseudo element let's begin
00:31 - in this example we will need an H1
00:33 - element
00:35 - why don't you go ahead and type in the
00:37 - word hello or something I really don't
00:39 - care and we will need a paragraph
00:43 - to generate some text you can type lorem
00:45 - then hit tab
00:48 - and a list
00:50 - let's create an unordered list
00:54 - with an ID of fruit
00:59 - we'll have three list items
01:06 - the first list item will be apple
01:09 - second will be orange third banana
01:13 - let's give each of these list items a
01:15 - unique ID as well ID will be apple
01:21 - Orange
01:24 - then banana
01:26 - all right that is good enough for now
01:28 - let's head to our style sheet
01:32 - we will use the first letter pseudo
01:34 - element to change the first letter in
01:36 - our H1 element
01:38 - we have our selector H1 two colons then
01:41 - a pseudo element
01:43 - first letter is one
01:45 - what would we like to do with the first
01:47 - letter
01:48 - let's set the font size to be 2 em
01:52 - basically that's 200 percent
01:55 - the H and hello is larger now
01:58 - and I will set the font style to be
02:01 - italic
02:04 - that is the first letter pseudo element
02:07 - let's select our paragraph paragraph two
02:10 - colons
02:11 - we can apply CSS properties to the first
02:13 - line of some text
02:15 - first dash line what would we like to do
02:19 - let's change the background color
02:21 - background Dash color I'll pick a yellow
02:24 - color
02:26 - something like that's fine
02:30 - all right so the first line is now a
02:32 - highlighter yellow color
02:34 - if I change the size of the window
02:36 - the first line is still going to have
02:38 - that background color
02:40 - then the selection pseudo class is
02:42 - anything that's currently selected with
02:44 - our Mouse
02:45 - we're selecting our paragraph element
02:47 - two colons then we will use the
02:50 - selection pseudo element
02:52 - anything that's selected with our Mouse
02:54 - normally the text is white and the
02:56 - background is blue let's change that
02:59 - let's set the color to be white well I
03:02 - guess that's the same and the background
03:04 - color
03:06 - to be
03:08 - let's go with the dark grayish color
03:14 - no better yet let's make the color green
03:16 - for the text
03:19 - yeah that's kind of cool
03:21 - so anything that's selected will have a
03:24 - font color that's green and a background
03:26 - color that's dark gray
03:28 - now let's go to our list
03:30 - the list had an ID of fruit then I would
03:34 - like to select any list items with any
03:36 - list item we will use the before pseudo
03:39 - element
03:41 - we can add something before each list
03:43 - item
03:44 - I'll add a check mark Emoji we can do
03:47 - that with the content property
03:50 - then within a set of quotes I can select
03:53 - an emoji so if you're on Windows you can
03:55 - hold the Windows button then semicolon
03:58 - and there's a prompt for an emoji
04:01 - I will find a check mark that looks good
04:05 - now before any list item add a check
04:07 - mark
04:09 - which we have
04:10 - there's also the after pseudo element we
04:13 - have a list item with an ID of Apple
04:16 - after after this selector
04:20 - let's add some content
04:22 - I will add an emoji of an apple
04:25 - Apple
04:27 - there we are
04:29 - let's do this with orange and banana as
04:31 - well
04:34 - Apple
04:36 - Orange
04:37 - banana
04:39 - let's change these emojis Orange
04:45 - then banana
04:51 - those are the before and after pseudo
04:53 - elements before or after some element we
04:56 - can add or change some content
04:58 - now with the list item you can change
05:00 - the marker for an unordered list the
05:03 - default is a bullet point but let's
05:05 - change that
05:06 - with our unordered list of fruit
05:10 - let's select any list items
05:13 - and use the marker pseudo element
05:17 - let's change the marker to be a check
05:19 - mark
05:20 - but I'll delete what we have with the
05:21 - before pseudo element
05:24 - I will also change the color of this
05:26 - check mark to be green
05:32 - pretty cool
05:33 - let's make it a little bit bigger too
05:36 - font size 1.2 em
05:39 - there all right everybody so those are
05:42 - pseudo elements you have a selector two
05:44 - colons then a pseudo element which can
05:47 - add specific CSS properties to that
05:49 - selector and those are a few pseudo
05:52 - elements in CSS
