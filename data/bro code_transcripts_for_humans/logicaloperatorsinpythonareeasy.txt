00:00 - all right another day another video in
00:02 - this topic I'm going to explain logical
00:05 - operators logical operators are used on
00:08 - conditional statements such as an if
00:10 - statement there's three types we'll talk
00:12 - about and or not each exhibits different
00:16 - behavior and we'll check to see if two
00:20 - or more conditions are true or checks if
00:23 - at least one condition is true
00:25 - not is a little different not will
00:28 - change the result of a condition if a
00:31 - condition is true it's now false if it
00:33 - was originally false it's now true
00:35 - here's an example say we have a program
00:38 - to check the temperature temp equals 25
00:42 - the temperature will be in Celsius in
00:44 - this example if the temperature Falls
00:46 - within a certain range I would like to
00:49 - print a message that says the
00:51 - temperature is good I can check more
00:54 - than one condition using the and logical
00:56 - operator
00:58 - let's check if our temperature Falls
01:00 - between the range of between 0 and 30 if
01:04 - temp is greater than zero
01:08 - and temp
01:10 - is less than
01:12 - 30.
01:13 - then we will print
01:17 - the
01:19 - temperature
01:21 - is good if this condition is true and
01:25 - this condition is true then we will
01:28 - execute this code
01:31 - else we will print
01:35 - the temperature is bad
01:39 - our temp is currently 25
01:42 - the temperature is good what if it was
01:45 - negative 10 degrees Celsius
01:47 - well the temperature is bad
01:50 - what if it was over 30 like 40 degrees
01:52 - Celsius
01:55 - well then the temperature is still bad
01:57 - using an andalogical operator if one of
02:00 - these conditions is false then this
02:03 - entire statement will evaluate to be
02:05 - false we would then skip over any sub
02:08 - code and continue on using the and
02:11 - logical operator is pretty convenient if
02:13 - you need to check to see if something is
02:15 - within a certain range like a
02:16 - temperature there is another way we can
02:19 - write this too using the or logical
02:21 - operator let's replace and with or
02:25 - if at least one of these conditions is
02:27 - true then the entire statement is true
02:30 - How about if temp is less than or equal
02:33 - to zero or if temp is greater than or
02:36 - equal to 30 then the temperature is bad
02:40 - else the temperature is good currently
02:44 - our temperature is set to 40.
02:47 - well the temperature is bad
02:49 - this is false but this is true using the
02:53 - orological operator only one of these
02:56 - conditions needs to be true
02:58 - if our temperature was negative 15
03:01 - well the temperature is still bad
03:04 - but if it was
03:06 - 20.
03:07 - well then the temperature is good and as
03:11 - well as ore are fairly similar with and
03:14 - two or more conditions need to be true
03:16 - for the statement to be true with or
03:19 - only one of them needs to be true is
03:22 - this true or is this true
03:24 - now not is a little different let's say
03:27 - we have a Boolean variable named sunny
03:30 - is it sunny outside I'll set this to be
03:33 - true
03:36 - using an if statement if Sunny is equal
03:39 - to true but if you're working with a
03:42 - Boolean
03:43 - you can just shorten this to the Boolean
03:45 - itself
03:46 - if sunny
03:47 - then print
03:50 - it is sunny
03:53 - outside
03:56 - else
03:58 - print
04:01 - it is cloudy outside Sunny is set to
04:06 - true
04:08 - therefore it is sunny outside if Sunny
04:11 - were set to false
04:13 - it is cloudy outside using the not
04:16 - logical operator that would flip the
04:19 - result
04:21 - so if not sunny
04:24 - then it is cloudy outside
04:27 - else it is sunny outside
04:31 - Sony is set to false it is cloudy
04:33 - outside
04:34 - if Sunny were true
04:36 - well then it's sunny outside the not
04:39 - logical operator will change something
04:41 - that's true to be false or if it was
04:44 - originally false it's now true alright
04:47 - everybody so those are logical operators
04:49 - they're used with conditional statements
04:51 - theirs and or not we'll have more
04:55 - practice with these in the future and
04:57 - yeah those are a few logical operators
04:59 - in Python

all right another day another video in this topic I'm going to explain logical operators logical operators are used on conditional statements such as an if statement there's three types we'll talk about and or not each exhibits different behavior and we'll check to see if two or more conditions are true or checks if at least one condition is true not is a little different not will change the result of a condition if a condition is true it's now false if it was originally false it's now true here's an example say we have a program to check the temperature temp equals 25 the temperature will be in Celsius in this example if the temperature Falls within a certain range I would like to print a message that says the temperature is good I can check more than one condition using the and logical operator let's check if our temperature Falls between the range of between 0 and 30 if temp is greater than zero and temp is less than 30. then we will print the temperature is good if this condition is true and this condition is true then we will execute this code else we will print the temperature is bad our temp is currently 25 the temperature is good what if it was negative 10 degrees Celsius well the temperature is bad what if it was over 30 like 40 degrees Celsius well then the temperature is still bad using an andalogical operator if one of these conditions is false then this entire statement will evaluate to be false we would then skip over any sub code and continue on using the and logical operator is pretty convenient if you need to check to see if something is within a certain range like a temperature there is another way we can write this too using the or logical operator let's replace and with or if at least one of these conditions is true then the entire statement is true How about if temp is less than or equal to zero or if temp is greater than or equal to 30 then the temperature is bad else the temperature is good currently our temperature is set to 40. well the temperature is bad this is false but this is true using the orological operator only one of these conditions needs to be true if our temperature was negative 15 well the temperature is still bad but if it was 20. well then the temperature is good and as well as ore are fairly similar with and two or more conditions need to be true for the statement to be true with or only one of them needs to be true is this true or is this true now not is a little different let's say we have a Boolean variable named sunny is it sunny outside I'll set this to be true using an if statement if Sunny is equal to true but if you're working with a Boolean you can just shorten this to the Boolean itself if sunny then print it is sunny outside else print it is cloudy outside Sunny is set to true therefore it is sunny outside if Sunny were set to false it is cloudy outside using the not logical operator that would flip the result so if not sunny then it is cloudy outside else it is sunny outside Sony is set to false it is cloudy outside if Sunny were true well then it's sunny outside the not logical operator will change something that's true to be false or if it was originally false it's now true alright everybody so those are logical operators they're used with conditional statements theirs and or not we'll have more practice with these in the future and yeah those are a few logical operators in Python
