00:02 - all right guys in this video i'm going
00:03 - to show you how we can iterate over the
00:05 - elements of an array suppose we have an
00:08 - array of students these will be strings
00:10 - standard
00:11 - string
00:13 - i'll name this array
00:14 - students set the sequel to some student
00:18 - names pick a few
00:21 - spongebob
00:24 - patrick
00:26 - then squidward
00:30 - suppose i would like to display all
00:32 - these students normally to do that i
00:34 - would type standard output
00:36 - my array followed by an index number so
00:39 - the first student would be spongebob
00:41 - which has an index of 0
00:43 - and my first student is spongebob
00:45 - if i need to display all of the elements
00:47 - of this array i would have to one by one
00:50 - access each element
00:52 - then i'll just add a new line
00:56 - we have spongebob patrick and squidward
00:59 - if i need to display all of the elements
01:01 - of an array a better approach would be
01:04 - to use a for loop
01:06 - i'm going to type four parentheses curly
01:08 - braces
01:10 - we'll need an index int i i'll set this
01:13 - equal to zero because the first element
01:15 - in our array has an index of zero
01:18 - i'll continue this as long as i is less
01:21 - than the length of our array currently
01:23 - it's three
01:25 - increment i by 1.
01:28 - during each iteration i would like to
01:30 - display each element standard
01:33 - output
01:35 - students
01:36 - now instead of an index number like 0 1
01:39 - 2 or whatever i'm going to use my
01:41 - counter variable i students at index of
01:44 - i during the first iteration i will be 0
01:47 - then 1 then 2
01:49 - once we reach 3 we'll stop
01:52 - i'll add a new line
01:55 - this for loop will print the elements of
01:57 - my array
02:00 - spongebob patrick squidward
02:02 - there's one issue with this though what
02:04 - if we add another student
02:06 - such as
02:07 - sandy
02:11 - well this for loop will stop once i
02:13 - reaches three if we make any adjustments
02:15 - to this array we would have to go into
02:17 - our code and make some changes such as
02:20 - setting this for loop so that we
02:21 - discontinue when i reaches 4.
02:25 - this would work but it's not the best
02:26 - solution for our stopping condition in
02:28 - place of just setting i to be less than
02:30 - some number let's calculate how many
02:32 - elements are within this array to do
02:34 - that we can use the size of operator
02:38 - i'll type size of
02:40 - my array
02:41 - this will give me the total size in
02:43 - bytes of my array to calculate the
02:45 - number of elements i can divide size of
02:48 - students by the size of
02:51 - the data type
02:53 - string
02:54 - or even an element
02:56 - this will loop through all of the
02:57 - elements of this array spongebob patrick
03:00 - squidward sandy if we change the number
03:02 - of elements well then there's no need to
03:04 - touch this for loop
03:06 - it will calculate the size automatically
03:08 - see now we just have spongebob and
03:10 - patrick let's create one last example
03:12 - i'll create an array of grades
03:15 - char
03:17 - grades
03:20 - we have an a
03:23 - b
03:24 - c
03:26 - d
03:27 - then f
03:30 - if i need to iterate over this array of
03:32 - characters i would find the size of my
03:34 - array grades divided by the size of a
03:38 - character the character data type
03:41 - during each iteration i will display
03:44 - grades at index of i our counter
03:48 - and this will display all of the
03:50 - elements of this array so yeah that's
03:52 - how to iterate over an array using a for
03:55 - loop in the next topic i will explain
03:57 - the for each loop which has different
03:59 - syntax
04:00 - and well yeah that's how to iterate over
04:02 - an array using a for loop in c plus plus

Cleaned transcript:

all right guys in this video i'm going to show you how we can iterate over the elements of an array suppose we have an array of students these will be strings standard string i'll name this array students set the sequel to some student names pick a few spongebob patrick then squidward suppose i would like to display all these students normally to do that i would type standard output my array followed by an index number so the first student would be spongebob which has an index of 0 and my first student is spongebob if i need to display all of the elements of this array i would have to one by one access each element then i'll just add a new line we have spongebob patrick and squidward if i need to display all of the elements of an array a better approach would be to use a for loop i'm going to type four parentheses curly braces we'll need an index int i i'll set this equal to zero because the first element in our array has an index of zero i'll continue this as long as i is less than the length of our array currently it's three increment i by 1. during each iteration i would like to display each element standard output students now instead of an index number like 0 1 2 or whatever i'm going to use my counter variable i students at index of i during the first iteration i will be 0 then 1 then 2 once we reach 3 we'll stop i'll add a new line this for loop will print the elements of my array spongebob patrick squidward there's one issue with this though what if we add another student such as sandy well this for loop will stop once i reaches three if we make any adjustments to this array we would have to go into our code and make some changes such as setting this for loop so that we discontinue when i reaches 4. this would work but it's not the best solution for our stopping condition in place of just setting i to be less than some number let's calculate how many elements are within this array to do that we can use the size of operator i'll type size of my array this will give me the total size in bytes of my array to calculate the number of elements i can divide size of students by the size of the data type string or even an element this will loop through all of the elements of this array spongebob patrick squidward sandy if we change the number of elements well then there's no need to touch this for loop it will calculate the size automatically see now we just have spongebob and patrick let's create one last example i'll create an array of grades char grades we have an a b c d then f if i need to iterate over this array of characters i would find the size of my array grades divided by the size of a character the character data type during each iteration i will display grades at index of i our counter and this will display all of the elements of this array so yeah that's how to iterate over an array using a for loop in the next topic i will explain the for each loop which has different syntax and well yeah that's how to iterate over an array using a for loop in c plus plus
