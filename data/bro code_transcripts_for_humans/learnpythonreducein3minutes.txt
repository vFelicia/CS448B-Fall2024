00:00 - sup people today I'm going to talk about
00:02 - the reduced function the reduced
00:04 - function in Python reduces elements in a
00:06 - collection to a single value kind of
00:09 - like we're getting a sum we're adding
00:11 - everything together just so you know a
00:13 - for Loop tends to be better in most
00:16 - cases using the reduce function is an
00:18 - alternative it provides a more
00:20 - functional approach and has better
00:23 - readability honestly I prefer to use
00:25 - four Loops rather than the reduce
00:27 - function but you should still be
00:28 - familiar with both you'll understand the
00:30 - reduce function in case you run into it
00:33 - to use the reduce function we'll need to
00:34 - import it from the module a funk
00:39 - tools import
00:42 - reduce in this demonstration we will
00:45 - create a list of
00:47 - prices using the reduce function we will
00:49 - sum up all the prices together to give a
00:52 - total let's make up some numbers just
00:55 - type in whatever numbers come to mind
01:00 - these will all be
01:06 - prices here is my list of
01:09 - prices I will sum them all together
01:11 - using the reduce function with the
01:14 - result we will assign it to be total
01:17 - what is the total price that we're
01:19 - paying after adding all these prices
01:20 - together maybe this is a shopping cart
01:22 - program of some sort we will call the
01:25 - reduce
01:27 - function we have to pass in a function
01:29 - and a
01:30 - collection so for the
01:33 - function let's say we have a function to
01:37 - add x x will be the first parameter y
01:41 - will be the second then I will return x
01:44 - + y we will pass in the name of our
01:47 - function to add let me zoom in a
01:51 - little then we pass in our collection of
01:56 - prices then I will print my total
02:00 - I'll use an F string add a
02:03 - placeholder display my total then prefix
02:06 - this with the unit of currency such as
02:08 - American dollars here's my
02:11 - total
02:14 - $50.7 rather than defining a function I
02:17 - would rather pass in a Lambda function
02:19 - so let's delete our function and instead
02:22 - use a Lambda function to do so we will
02:25 - type that keyword of
02:27 - Lambda we have our parameters of X and
02:31 - Y what would we like to do we would like
02:34 - to add X and Y
02:38 - together and that should work too the
02:41 - total is
02:43 - $50.7 So this can get a little confusing
02:46 - with how this works X is going to be the
02:48 - first value y will be the second we're
02:52 - going to add them together we're
02:54 - returning the result and using it as the
02:56 - parameter for the next iteration by
02:59 - doing doing so we're going to reduce all
03:01 - these values into one single value all
03:04 - right everybody so that is the reduce
03:06 - function we reduce the elements in a
03:08 - collection to a single value there is a
03:11 - lot of overlap where you could use a for
03:13 - Loop or the reduce function honestly I
03:15 - still think a for Loop is better in most
03:17 - cases however the reduceed function
03:19 - gives a functional approach and it has
03:21 - better readability so if you see the
03:24 - reduce function you'll know that it
03:26 - reduces the elements in a collection to
03:28 - a single value and that is the reduce
03:30 - function in Python
