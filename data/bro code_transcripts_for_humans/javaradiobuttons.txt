00:00 - what's going on everybody it's bro here
00:02 - hope you're doing well and in this video
00:03 - i'm going to teach you guys all about
00:05 - radio buttons in java so sit back relax
00:07 - and enjoy the show
00:11 - if you find this video helpful please
00:12 - remember to like
00:14 - comment and subscribe your support will
00:16 - help keep this channel running
00:18 - well howdy y'all we're gonna be talking
00:20 - about radio buttons in this video
00:22 - so the definition of j radio buttons is
00:25 - that these are one or more buttons in a
00:27 - grouping in which
00:28 - only one may be selected per group so
00:31 - let me give you a demonstration of my
00:33 - setup before we actually get into radio
00:36 - buttons
00:36 - i have two classes one just called main
00:38 - it contains my main method
00:40 - and an instance of my other class my
00:42 - frame so my
00:43 - frame extends jframe it behaves exactly
00:46 - like a jframe
00:47 - it also implements an action listener
00:50 - and within
00:50 - this constructor i just have this dot
00:53 - set default close operation jframe exit
00:55 - on close
00:56 - i'm using a new flow layout this dot
00:59 - pack
00:59 - and this dot set visible set to true and
01:02 - then i also have an action performed
01:03 - method within here
01:05 - so let's get started by making some j
01:07 - radio buttons
01:08 - here's a scenario for this example let's
01:10 - say that i'm buying you lunch because
01:12 - i'm such a nice guy but you can only
01:14 - pick
01:14 - one item from the menu you can pick
01:16 - either a slice of pizza
01:18 - a hamburger or a hot dog so we're going
01:20 - to create three radio buttons and you
01:22 - can select
01:22 - one of those choices and we're going to
01:24 - place all of these within
01:26 - one grouping so let's begin by creating
01:28 - a radio button for pizza
01:30 - so to create a radio button it is j
01:34 - radio button and we'll call this radio
01:37 - button
01:38 - the pizza button j radio button
01:41 - pizza button equals new j
01:45 - radio button
01:50 - all right let's do the same thing for a
01:52 - hamburger button and a
01:54 - hot dog button so j radio button this
01:57 - will be
01:57 - our hamburger button
02:00 - and then a hot dog button
02:05 - so we can set some text we can either
02:07 - use the set text
02:08 - method or we can just pass in a string
02:11 - within the constructor
02:12 - so just for convenience i'm going to
02:14 - pass in pizza then hamburger then hot
02:16 - dog
02:20 - and then we need to add these buttons to
02:22 - the frame so
02:23 - this dot add let's add our pizza button
02:27 - first
02:29 - followed by hamburger and then hot dog
02:41 - and this is what we should have
02:45 - all right we have pizza hamburger and
02:47 - hot dog
02:48 - but wait a second we've been bamboozled
02:51 - we can select
02:51 - all of these items if we wanted so we
02:54 - can actually limit
02:55 - the choice selection to only one item
02:57 - but we have to put all of these radio
02:59 - buttons within the same grouping
03:00 - because right now we can select all of
03:02 - these and i promised you only one thing
03:04 - for lunch today
03:05 - so we need to place these within a
03:08 - button group
03:09 - so let's place this here we're going to
03:11 - create a
03:12 - new button group and we'll just call
03:15 - this group
03:17 - equals new button
03:20 - group and then we need to add
03:25 - these radio buttons to this group we can
03:27 - do that by
03:28 - typing in the name of the group dot add
03:31 - and what are we adding all of these
03:32 - buttons
03:34 - so let's add the pizza button followed
03:37 - by
03:38 - the hamburger button so group dot add
03:41 - hamburger button
03:44 - and then the hot dog button
03:53 - and now we can only select one item
03:57 - one thing you should know every time
03:58 - that you select one of these choices
04:00 - it's actually triggering an event and we
04:02 - can use our action performed method
04:05 - to detect which button was selected so
04:08 - within our action performed method we
04:10 - can place a simple
04:11 - if statement if e dot get
04:15 - source is equal to let's begin
04:18 - with our pizza button if somebody
04:20 - selects the pizza button
04:22 - then they get pizza so let's do a
04:25 - system.out.printline
04:27 - you ordered pizza
04:31 - but notice this action performed method
04:34 - does not recognize
04:35 - our pizza button that's because we
04:37 - declared our pizza button within the
04:39 - constructor of
04:40 - our my frame class so this is a local
04:43 - component we need to turn this global
04:46 - so we can do that by just declaring this
04:48 - outside of our constructor
04:49 - since we've declared this pizza button
04:51 - outside of the constructor
04:53 - this action performed method does
04:55 - recognize it now
04:56 - however we want to get rid of this
04:58 - portion where we declare this pizza
05:00 - button twice
05:01 - but we do want to finish instantiating
05:03 - this and we should do the same thing for
05:05 - our hamburger button as well as our hot
05:07 - dog button
05:08 - so we're going to declare these but not
05:10 - yet instantiate them until we're within
05:12 - our constructor
05:13 - so hamburger button equals new j radio
05:15 - button and then we want to
05:17 - declare the hotdog button outside of the
05:19 - constructor
05:20 - and then instantiate it within the
05:23 - constructor
05:24 - so then the action performed method can
05:26 - actually recognize
05:27 - all of these components so if e that
05:30 - gets source is equal to the pizza button
05:32 - we'll print you order pizza
05:33 - then we'll do the same thing for our
05:35 - hamburger button
05:36 - and our hotdog button and let's just use
05:39 - an else if statement to keep this simple
05:41 - there's more sophisticated ways of doing
05:42 - this but we're still noobs so it's okay
05:44 - if we do if statements
05:46 - so if e dot get source is equal to
05:49 - the hamburger button i don't feel like
05:52 - typing all this i'm going to paste it
05:54 - then we will just system.out.printline
05:58 - you ordered a hamburger
06:04 - and then else if
06:08 - e dot get source
06:11 - is equal to our hot dog button
06:18 - system.out.println you
06:22 - ordered a hotdog
06:26 - and let's run this here we have our
06:29 - pizza button hamburger button
06:31 - and our hotdog button but wait a second
06:33 - we've been bamboozled again because
06:35 - when we select these it's not printing
06:37 - out our message
06:38 - well that's because we still need to add
06:41 - an action
06:41 - listener to each of these buttons so
06:43 - let's work on that next
06:45 - i'll just add them here so let's select
06:48 - each of these buttons
06:49 - so we have our pizza button and we need
06:51 - to add an action listener so pizzabun
06:53 - dot add action listener
06:58 - now since we're implementing an action
07:00 - listener interface
07:01 - we can simply just pass in this
07:05 - and then let's do the same thing for our
07:06 - hamburger button and our hotdog button
07:12 - now these radio buttons will be able to
07:14 - listen for events
07:16 - and when we click on one of our radio
07:18 - buttons
07:19 - we will order our selected item you
07:21 - ordered a pizza you ordered a hamburger
07:23 - and you ordered a hot dog
07:25 - this is entirely optional but you can
07:27 - actually change
07:28 - the icons that you're using for these
07:30 - radio buttons so within my project
07:32 - folder i have
07:33 - three images that i want to use an emoji
07:36 - of a slice of pizza
07:38 - a hot dog and a hamburger so i'm going
07:41 - to create some image icons out of these
07:43 - and we're going to
07:44 - set the icon for each of these radio
07:46 - buttons
07:47 - to that image so if you have a few in
07:49 - mind let's begin
07:50 - so let's create a few image icons so for
07:54 - my first icon this will be
07:55 - my pizza icon
07:59 - then i'll do the same thing for
08:01 - hamburger
08:02 - and hot dog
08:14 - and then within the constructor i'll
08:16 - finish instantiating this
08:18 - so pizza icon
08:21 - equals new image icon
08:25 - and i'm going to list the file path of
08:27 - where this is located
08:29 - since this is within my same project
08:31 - folder
08:32 - i can just simply list the file name so
08:35 - my first image is pizza.png
08:42 - and then hamburger then hot dog
09:04 - all right so i have all of my image
09:06 - icons set up now to
09:08 - add an icon to a button there is a
09:10 - function to do so
09:12 - i'll add them here so type in the name
09:15 - of the button
09:16 - uh there it is pizza button
09:19 - dot you can either set
09:22 - icon or set selected icon
09:26 - i'm just going to use set icon and list
09:29 - the icon that you want to use i want to
09:31 - use my pizza icon
09:34 - so i'll put that here and then let's do
09:36 - the same for the other buttons
09:39 - so hamburger button dot set icon
09:43 - hamburger icon
09:46 - and then lastly hot dog
09:57 - and now those circles are going to be
09:59 - replaced
10:00 - with our images and they work just the
10:02 - same so we have a slice of pizza
10:05 - a hamburger and a hot dog alright so
10:08 - that's the basics of creating radio
10:10 - buttons in java if you want a copy of
10:12 - all this code i'll post all of this in
10:14 - the comments down below
10:15 - but yeah that's the basics of creating
10:17 - radio buttons in java
10:19 - hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you
10:22 - learned something new
10:23 - then you can help me help you in three
10:26 - easy steps
10:27 - by smashing that like button drop a
