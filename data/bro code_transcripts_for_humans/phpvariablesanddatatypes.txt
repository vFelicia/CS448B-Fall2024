00:00 - well hello everybody Welcome to lesson
00:02 - two today I'm going to discuss variables
00:04 - in PHP a variable think of it as a
00:08 - reusable container that holds data we
00:11 - give that container a name that is the
00:13 - variable name there's different data
00:16 - types we'll discuss they include but are
00:18 - not limited to Strings integers floats
00:22 - and booleans there are still more than
00:24 - this but these are a few of the basics
00:26 - for beginners let's get started
00:29 - to declare a variable you type a dollar
00:32 - sign then a unique variable name
00:35 - I'm going to store a user's name a
00:38 - unique identifier could be just name
00:41 - I will set this variable name equal to
00:45 - a string of text so place your string of
00:48 - text within a set of double quotes
00:51 - add a semicolon to the end because we
00:53 - always do that why don't you enter in
00:55 - your first name
00:57 - then to display this variable as output
01:00 - we can type our Echo statement then add
01:03 - the variable name so type dollar sign
01:06 - name semicolon
01:08 - let's save
01:11 - and there is our name rendered as HTML
01:14 - the data type of this variable is a
01:17 - string it's a string of text and it can
01:20 - include spaces
01:21 - add a space followed by your last name
01:26 - as output we're displaying my first name
01:28 - and my last name all as one long string
01:32 - of text
01:33 - if you Echo a message directly that is
01:36 - known as a string literal
01:38 - I will display a message such as
01:41 - hello
01:43 - then I want to add this variable name
01:46 - the easiest way to do that is to add a
01:49 - set of curly braces as a placeholder and
01:51 - within the curly braces add your
01:53 - variable name so dollar sign name
01:58 - hello whatever your name is
02:01 - let's add a few more variables how about
02:04 - a food variable
02:06 - what's the food you like
02:09 - I like pizza of course which we learned
02:11 - from the last video
02:14 - hello
02:15 - name
02:17 - I'll display another message
02:20 - Echo
02:23 - you like at our placeholder
02:27 - our variable name
02:29 - food
02:31 - let's save
02:35 - I'm going to disable this
02:37 - page is not in Dutch for some reason
02:42 - our output is all on one line I'm just
02:45 - going to add a line break
02:49 - a low bro code you like pizza
02:53 - what's another example of a string maybe
02:55 - an email
02:58 - let's declare our variable which we will
03:00 - name email
03:02 - add a set of quotes semicolon to the end
03:06 - uh fake at gmail.com
03:13 - so let's add another line break
03:19 - let's Echo
03:22 - your email is at our placeholder for a
03:26 - variable
03:28 - then our variable name
03:30 - email
03:33 - your email is fake gmail.com
03:37 - that's the string data type it's just a
03:40 - series of text
03:41 - your text can contain numbers
03:44 - such as fake123 gmail.com
03:49 - so even though these are numbers we
03:51 - treat them more as characters we can't
03:53 - use these for any sort of math
03:55 - that's where our next data type comes in
03:58 - integers whole integers
04:00 - an example of a whole integer would be
04:03 - somebody's age let's say that I'm 21 age
04:06 - equals 21. I'm not 21 anymore but I like
04:10 - to think that I still am
04:11 - the data contained within this variable
04:13 - age is an integer we don't have any
04:16 - quotes around this number
04:19 - I will Echo my age variable
04:23 - Echo
04:25 - you are are variable age
04:29 - years old
04:33 - let me add a blind break here
04:38 - there you are 21 years old
04:41 - and int is simply a whole integer
04:45 - you know somebody wouldn't be like half
04:47 - a year old like 21.5
04:50 - and age would be a whole number
04:53 - another example of a whole integer
04:55 - variable could be users
04:59 - let's create a variable named users and
05:02 - there are maybe two users online
05:05 - you wouldn't have half a user users
05:08 - would be a whole number
05:10 - let's Echo the amount of users
05:15 - there are at a placeholder
05:18 - are variable users
05:21 - online
05:26 - there are two online
05:28 - after the variable users let's add the
05:32 - word users
05:33 - there are two users online
05:37 - one more example of a whole integer
05:39 - could be a quantity
05:43 - you wouldn't have half a product you
05:45 - would have a whole product
05:47 - let's create a variable named quantity
05:50 - I'll just set it to three
05:53 - let's Echo
05:55 - you would like to buy
05:58 - are variable
06:00 - quantity
06:04 - items
06:06 - then a line break
06:09 - you would like to buy three items
06:12 - okay those are whole integers
06:15 - let's discuss floats next a float is a
06:18 - floating Point number it's a number that
06:20 - contains a decimal portion
06:23 - these variables are ins integers they're
06:25 - whole numbers
06:27 - an example of a float could be
06:30 - a grade point average
06:32 - maybe my grade point average is 2.5
06:37 - so let's Echo
06:43 - your GPA is
06:47 - then our GPA variable
06:50 - then line break
06:55 - your GPA is 2.5
06:58 - I think we're getting the hang of this
06:59 - I'm going to speed things up another
07:02 - float could be a price
07:06 - with the merry concurrency a price
07:08 - contains dollars and cents with the
07:11 - cents being a decimal portion
07:13 - suppose a pizza is 4.99
07:19 - let's Echo
07:23 - your Pizza is
07:27 - I'll add my price variable
07:29 - your pizza is
07:31 - price
07:33 - line break
07:37 - your pizza is 4.99 I'm going to add the
07:41 - dollar sign before 4.99
07:45 - but we have a problem
07:47 - PHP is getting confused because we
07:49 - precede our variable names with the
07:51 - dollar sign
07:53 - undefined variable 4.99
07:57 - if you would like to display a dollar
07:59 - sign as output you need an escape
08:01 - sequence I will precede my dollar sign
08:04 - with a backslash then it works just fine
08:08 - let me add your
08:10 - your pizza is 4.99
08:14 - so that's another example of a floating
08:16 - Point number a float another could be
08:19 - a tax rate
08:21 - tax
08:23 - rate
08:25 - I'll make up a tax rate like a sales tax
08:27 - rate 5.1 sounds good
08:31 - let's Echo
08:34 - the sales tax rate is
08:43 - tax rate
08:46 - oop I'm forgetting a dollar sign
08:49 - tax rate percent
08:52 - then a line break
08:55 - the sales tax rate is 5.1 percent
08:59 - those are floats floating Point numbers
09:02 - they're numbers that contain a decimal
09:04 - portion integers are whole numbers
09:07 - the last data type we'll cover are
09:10 - booleans booleans are either true or
09:13 - they're false
09:15 - it's like a light switch it can only be
09:17 - on or off
09:19 - so what are some variables that could be
09:21 - considered booleans
09:24 - what if somebody is employed they either
09:27 - are employed or they're not employed
09:30 - equals true
09:34 - another could be online
09:36 - is somebody online or offline
09:39 - maybe a user's offline I will set that
09:42 - to be false
09:44 - what about for sale
09:47 - something is for sale or it's not for
09:50 - sale
09:50 - I'll set that to be true
09:54 - now with booleans when you display them
09:55 - as output
09:57 - you don't see true or false rather this
10:00 - is what you see
10:02 - let's Echo
10:05 - online
10:07 - status
10:08 - colon then I'll add my Boolean variable
10:13 - online
10:16 - so online is false
10:19 - online status and then nothing appears
10:21 - the Boolean values when you output them
10:24 - if it's false it doesn't display
10:26 - anything however if online was true that
10:30 - will output a one one means true zero
10:34 - means false however we won't display
10:36 - zero nothing is displayed for false
10:39 - usually with Boolean variables we don't
10:42 - normally display them as output we use
10:45 - them internally within a program we
10:47 - might use these within an if statement
10:49 - or a loop which we'll discuss in the
10:51 - future but at this point you should be
10:53 - aware of the existence of Boolean
10:55 - variables in summary a Boolean variable
10:58 - is either true or false
11:01 - I'm going to get rid of these Echo
11:03 - statements you can mix and match
11:05 - variables when you display output with
11:07 - Echo I will add two variables this time
11:10 - here's a hypothetical situation you own
11:13 - a pizza restaurant and somebody places
11:16 - an online order for a given amount of
11:19 - pizzas
11:20 - you have
11:22 - ordered let's add our variable
11:26 - quantity
11:29 - X then our variable
11:32 - food
11:35 - you have ordered three x Pizza let's add
11:38 - an S to the end to make it plural
11:41 - you have ordered three x pizzas
11:44 - then let's calculate a total what I'm
11:46 - going to do now is declare a variable
11:49 - but I'm not going to assign it a value
11:51 - quite yet we will calculate a total
11:54 - total equals null null means no value
11:58 - We'll add a value later
12:01 - after displaying our message you have
12:04 - ordered quantity X food
12:06 - let's reassign our total variable
12:10 - equal to
12:12 - are quantity
12:15 - times
12:16 - to use multiplication you use an
12:18 - asterisk
12:20 - our variable price
12:24 - so now our total should contain a number
12:28 - let's output it
12:30 - Echo
12:32 - your total is
12:37 - let's add our variable
12:40 - total
12:41 - and see what we have
12:43 - ooh I need a line break I'm forgetting
12:45 - about that
12:49 - you have ordered three x pizzas your
12:52 - total is 14.97 So I need to add a dollar
12:56 - sign or you can pick some other unit of
12:58 - currency however PHP is currently
13:00 - confused because we're preceding our
13:02 - placeholder with a dollar sign
13:04 - so I need to use an escape sequence
13:08 - your total is 14.97
13:13 - now in my program if I were to change
13:15 - the quantity
13:17 - well this total is going to be updated
13:19 - four pizzas is 19.96
13:24 - if I were to change the price that would
13:26 - also be reflected
13:27 - now the total is 23.96
13:31 - all right everybody so those are
13:33 - variables they are just a named
13:35 - container for storing reusable data
13:38 - there are a few different data types
13:40 - strings which are a series of text
13:44 - ins which are whole integers
13:47 - floats which are floating Point numbers
13:50 - and booleans which are either true or
13:53 - false in the next topic we'll have more
13:55 - practice with arithmetic and PHP and
13:58 - well those are variables in PHP

well hello everybody Welcome to lesson two today I'm going to discuss variables in PHP a variable think of it as a reusable container that holds data we give that container a name that is the variable name there's different data types we'll discuss they include but are not limited to Strings integers floats and booleans there are still more than this but these are a few of the basics for beginners let's get started to declare a variable you type a dollar sign then a unique variable name I'm going to store a user's name a unique identifier could be just name I will set this variable name equal to a string of text so place your string of text within a set of double quotes add a semicolon to the end because we always do that why don't you enter in your first name then to display this variable as output we can type our Echo statement then add the variable name so type dollar sign name semicolon let's save and there is our name rendered as HTML the data type of this variable is a string it's a string of text and it can include spaces add a space followed by your last name as output we're displaying my first name and my last name all as one long string of text if you Echo a message directly that is known as a string literal I will display a message such as hello then I want to add this variable name the easiest way to do that is to add a set of curly braces as a placeholder and within the curly braces add your variable name so dollar sign name hello whatever your name is let's add a few more variables how about a food variable what's the food you like I like pizza of course which we learned from the last video hello name I'll display another message Echo you like at our placeholder our variable name food let's save I'm going to disable this page is not in Dutch for some reason our output is all on one line I'm just going to add a line break a low bro code you like pizza what's another example of a string maybe an email let's declare our variable which we will name email add a set of quotes semicolon to the end uh fake at gmail.com so let's add another line break let's Echo your email is at our placeholder for a variable then our variable name email your email is fake gmail.com that's the string data type it's just a series of text your text can contain numbers such as fake123 gmail.com so even though these are numbers we treat them more as characters we can't use these for any sort of math that's where our next data type comes in integers whole integers an example of a whole integer would be somebody's age let's say that I'm 21 age equals 21. I'm not 21 anymore but I like to think that I still am the data contained within this variable age is an integer we don't have any quotes around this number I will Echo my age variable Echo you are are variable age years old let me add a blind break here there you are 21 years old and int is simply a whole integer you know somebody wouldn't be like half a year old like 21.5 and age would be a whole number another example of a whole integer variable could be users let's create a variable named users and there are maybe two users online you wouldn't have half a user users would be a whole number let's Echo the amount of users there are at a placeholder are variable users online there are two online after the variable users let's add the word users there are two users online one more example of a whole integer could be a quantity you wouldn't have half a product you would have a whole product let's create a variable named quantity I'll just set it to three let's Echo you would like to buy are variable quantity items then a line break you would like to buy three items okay those are whole integers let's discuss floats next a float is a floating Point number it's a number that contains a decimal portion these variables are ins integers they're whole numbers an example of a float could be a grade point average maybe my grade point average is 2.5 so let's Echo your GPA is then our GPA variable then line break your GPA is 2.5 I think we're getting the hang of this I'm going to speed things up another float could be a price with the merry concurrency a price contains dollars and cents with the cents being a decimal portion suppose a pizza is 4.99 let's Echo your Pizza is I'll add my price variable your pizza is price line break your pizza is 4.99 I'm going to add the dollar sign before 4.99 but we have a problem PHP is getting confused because we precede our variable names with the dollar sign undefined variable 4.99 if you would like to display a dollar sign as output you need an escape sequence I will precede my dollar sign with a backslash then it works just fine let me add your your pizza is 4.99 so that's another example of a floating Point number a float another could be a tax rate tax rate I'll make up a tax rate like a sales tax rate 5.1 sounds good let's Echo the sales tax rate is tax rate oop I'm forgetting a dollar sign tax rate percent then a line break the sales tax rate is 5.1 percent those are floats floating Point numbers they're numbers that contain a decimal portion integers are whole numbers the last data type we'll cover are booleans booleans are either true or they're false it's like a light switch it can only be on or off so what are some variables that could be considered booleans what if somebody is employed they either are employed or they're not employed equals true another could be online is somebody online or offline maybe a user's offline I will set that to be false what about for sale something is for sale or it's not for sale I'll set that to be true now with booleans when you display them as output you don't see true or false rather this is what you see let's Echo online status colon then I'll add my Boolean variable online so online is false online status and then nothing appears the Boolean values when you output them if it's false it doesn't display anything however if online was true
