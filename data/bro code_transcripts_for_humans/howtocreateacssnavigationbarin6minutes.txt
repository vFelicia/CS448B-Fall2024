00:00 - hey everybody in today's video we're
00:02 - going to create a navigation bar using
00:03 - HTML and CSS so let's get started we'll
00:07 - Begin by creating an H1 title for the
00:10 - title of our web page why don't you go
00:12 - ahead and type in your name or your
00:14 - employer's name or your business name
00:16 - really doesn't matter then I'm going to
00:19 - use a nav element also known as a
00:22 - navigation element
00:24 - navigation elements are typically used
00:27 - for a set of navigation links I will
00:29 - give this nav element a class of navbar
00:33 - then within this navigation element I'll
00:35 - create an unordered list
00:39 - my unordered list will contain one list
00:43 - item for each category in my navigation
00:45 - bar
00:49 - for the first list item let's create a
00:51 - category for home I would like to turn
00:54 - this category into a hyperlink I'll
00:56 - surround this text with a pair of a tags
00:59 - within the opening a tag I will set the
01:02 - href attribute to B I'll just keep it
01:04 - empty for now we'll fill that in later
01:06 - let's copy our list item paste it a few
01:10 - times maybe a total of four links
01:13 - for the categories let's have home
01:16 - about
01:19 - products
01:20 - and contact
01:22 - these are a few common categories you
01:24 - may see for a navigation bar
01:27 - all right then outside of our navigation
01:29 - bar let's use a main element for the
01:32 - main content for our web page
01:35 - I'll add an H3 element for a sort of
01:38 - subtitle for the main section of our
01:40 - content
01:42 - this is the home page
01:46 - then I'll add a paragraph a text
01:49 - to generate some text in vs code you can
01:51 - type lorem then hit tab
01:54 - alright that is what we need for now
01:57 - let's go to our style sheet the first
01:59 - thing I'm going to do is text align our
02:02 - H1 element and set it to Center
02:05 - text align Center
02:08 - the text in our H1 element should be
02:10 - right in the center
02:12 - I will take our navigation bar class
02:15 - select our unordered list set the list
02:19 - style type to be none to remove the
02:22 - bullet points and they are gone now I'll
02:26 - also change the background color
02:28 - let's pick a dark gray color
02:34 - I'll set the lightness to be 25.
02:37 - I'll remove any padding
02:41 - as well as any margins
02:45 - let's style these hyperlinks within our
02:48 - navigation bar class take any a elements
02:52 - set the color to be white
02:56 - remove the text decoration text
02:59 - decoration will be none that removes the
03:03 - underline
03:04 - I'll add some padding of 15 pixels
03:08 - I will display these elements as a block
03:13 - then text
03:15 - align Center
03:18 - there we are this navigation bar is a
03:20 - vertical style navigation bar this is a
03:23 - style you may see at the bottom of a web
03:25 - page when I hover over one of these
03:27 - links I want to change the background
03:29 - color
03:30 - we will take our navigation bar class
03:33 - take any a elements then apply the hover
03:36 - pseudo class
03:38 - when I hover over one of these
03:40 - hyperlinks I'll change the background
03:42 - color
03:45 - I'll turn down the lightness slightly
03:47 - to 10 lightness
03:50 - there we are
03:51 - if you would like a horizontal
03:53 - navigation bar here's a change we can
03:55 - make
03:56 - with our navigation bar class take any
04:00 - list items
04:01 - then we will float left
04:05 - one change we'll make within our
04:07 - unordered list set the Overflow property
04:10 - to be hidden
04:14 - all right that's pretty good so far
04:17 - there is a little bit of margin around
04:19 - the body of my document I am going to
04:21 - set margin to be zero
04:23 - with our body element set any margin to
04:27 - be zero pixels
04:29 - if you would like margin around the main
04:31 - content of your page
04:33 - we will take our main element
04:36 - then set margin to be
04:39 - let's stick with 20 pixels
04:42 - you also could put margin just on the
04:44 - left side and the right side you know
04:46 - what I'm going to set margin left to be
04:48 - 20. and margin right to be 20.
04:53 - all right then lastly let's fill in
04:56 - these href attributes for the href
04:58 - attributes I will set my home link to be
05:01 - index.html about will be about.html
05:06 - products.html
05:09 - and contact.html
05:13 - we're going to go to our website folder
05:15 - we'll create a few copies of our index
05:17 - file we need three more files
05:21 - one two three
05:24 - let's rename one of these as about.html
05:30 - then products.html
05:35 - then contact.html
05:42 - so let's open about
05:44 - I'll change the header element of our
05:47 - main element to be this is the about
05:50 - page
05:52 - let's apply that for products this is
05:54 - the products page
05:58 - then contact
06:00 - this is the contact page
06:03 - all right and that should be everything
06:05 - let's see if this works
06:07 - we're currently on the home page I can
06:09 - go to the about page products contact
06:12 - and home
06:15 - in this example they're all relatively
06:16 - the same except for the H3 title all
06:20 - right everybody and that's how to create
06:21 - a navigation bar using HTML and CSS
