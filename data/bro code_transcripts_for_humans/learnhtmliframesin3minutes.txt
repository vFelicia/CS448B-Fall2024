00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's you
00:01 - bro hope you're doing well and in this
00:03 - video i'm going to explain how we can
00:05 - use iframes to embed web pages and other
00:08 - documents within your website so sit
00:10 - back relax and enjoy the show
00:14 - hey welcome back iframes the iframe
00:17 - element is used to embed content from
00:20 - another source into an html document
00:23 - they're commonly used for advertisements
00:26 - and they're easily abused with many
00:28 - hacking techniques so basically using an
00:30 - iframe we can embed another web page
00:32 - within our webpage or we could embed our
00:35 - current html document with another html
00:38 - document here's how we can create an
00:39 - iframe this is a self-closing tag and we
00:42 - set the source equal to this can be an
00:45 - external website such as a url or we can
00:48 - place a relative file path to a file of
00:51 - our choosing so this doesn't work with
00:53 - many websites and i'll demonstrate that
00:56 - so let's set the source equal to
00:58 - google.com and then save and reload so
01:02 - google.com refused to connect that's
01:05 - because a lot of major websites have
01:07 - disabled the use of iframes since we're
01:09 - embedding another web page within our
01:11 - webpage
01:12 - a common hacking technique is that you
01:15 - can have this embedded web page take up
01:17 - the entire frame of your html document
01:20 - your website could pose as another
01:22 - website and that could be considered
01:23 - dangerous let's say that you embed a
01:26 - banking website like bank of america so
01:28 - if somebody visits your website it's
01:30 - actually a facade and somebody will type
01:32 - in their banking information like their
01:34 - login credentials and you could capture
01:36 - that so a lot of major websites have
01:38 - disabled the use of iframes so you
01:40 - cannot pose as their website one website
01:43 - that i checked that does work is bing
01:46 - so let's switch our url to that save and
01:49 - reload
01:51 - yeah see we have embedded the home page
01:53 - of bing uh but let's change the width
01:56 - and height attributes because this is
01:57 - fairly small let's say the width is
02:00 - 750 pixels and for the height let's say
02:03 - maybe 250.
02:06 - so save and reload cool yeah we have
02:09 - embedded bing within our web page and
02:11 - you can use this normally
02:13 - bro
02:13 - code
02:16 - now let's embed another document so
02:18 - let's create a new file
02:20 - let's pretend that this is an
02:21 - advertisement we would like to display
02:23 - within our webpage i'll name this
02:25 - add.html
02:27 - so if you're using vs code to generate
02:29 - an html document a plain one type
02:32 - exclamation point then hit tab
02:34 - so let's say something
02:36 - i'll use an h1 header tag
02:38 - this is an advertisement
02:41 - and then close it
02:43 - uh let's change the background color too
02:45 - using the style attribute
02:47 - and i will pick the background color
02:50 - property and set this to maybe i don't
02:52 - know that color uh then let's change the
02:55 - width and height for the height maybe
02:57 - 100
02:59 - oh then make sure to change your source
03:01 - as well so we need to list the relative
03:03 - file path since these files are right
03:05 - next to each other i only have to list
03:07 - the file name
03:09 - add.html save reload
03:13 - cool and there is my fake advertisement
03:15 - embedded pages do have a border this is
03:18 - how to remove that set the style
03:20 - attribute
03:22 - equal to the border css property and set
03:26 - this to zero
03:28 - so i'm going to save reload
03:30 - and this no longer has that border so
03:33 - yeah everybody those are iframes they're
03:36 - used to embed content from another
03:38 - source into an html document they're
03:41 - useful for advertisements and they're
03:43 - easily abused with a lot of hacking
03:45 - techniques so yeah those are iframes if
03:48 - you learned something new be sure to
03:49 - smash that like button drop a random
03:51 - comment down below and subscribe if
03:53 - you'd like to become a fellow bro
