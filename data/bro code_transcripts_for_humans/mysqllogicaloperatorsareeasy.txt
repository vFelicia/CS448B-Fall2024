00:00 - why hello again everybody guess who it's
00:02 - me again today I will be explaining
00:05 - logical operators in MySQL I would think
00:08 - of them as keywords that are used to
00:10 - combine more than one condition for my
00:13 - examples to make more sense I will add
00:15 - one more column a job column so let's
00:18 - alter our table of employees alter table
00:22 - employees add
00:24 - column job the data type will be
00:29 - varchar25 I'll add this column after our
00:32 - hourly pay column
00:35 - then select all from my table employees
00:41 - here is our job column
00:43 - let's add some jobs to our employees
00:46 - let's update employees
00:51 - set job equal to Let's select Mr Krabs
00:55 - he will be a manager
00:57 - then be sure to add a where Clause
00:59 - employee ID equals one
01:03 - Mr Krabs is a manager
01:06 - Squidward will be a cashier employee ID
01:09 - equals to
01:10 - SpongeBob employee ID3 he will be a cook
01:16 - Patrick will also be a cook
01:19 - Sandy will be an assistant manager
01:22 - let's abbreviate the word assistant
01:25 - manager
01:27 - Plankton Plankton will be a janitor
01:32 - how is this related to logical operators
01:34 - you're wondering well using logical
01:36 - operators we can check more than one
01:38 - condition suppose that our boss wants us
01:41 - to find any Cooks that were hired before
01:44 - January 5th how can we write a query
01:47 - that can satisfy those two conditions
01:48 - here's how we will use the and logical
01:52 - operator
01:53 - select all
01:55 - from our table employees
01:58 - using a where Clause we will write two
02:00 - conditions find any employees where the
02:03 - higher date is less than
02:07 - the year 2023
02:09 - January 5th
02:12 - so far this would give us three results
02:15 - Mr Krabs Squidward and SpongeBob from
02:18 - these three employees how do we find any
02:20 - Cooks well we can add the and logical
02:23 - operator
02:24 - and we can write some other condition
02:27 - job is equal to
02:30 - cook
02:31 - there we have SpongeBob
02:34 - he is a cook that was hired before
02:36 - January 5th
02:38 - so that's the analogical operator you
02:41 - will return any results that match these
02:44 - two criteria another logical operator is
02:47 - or you can check more than one condition
02:49 - as long as one of those conditions is
02:52 - true that row will be true let's find
02:55 - any cooks or cashiers
02:57 - where the job is equal to cook
03:02 - that gives us both SpongeBob and Patrick
03:04 - they're both Cooks
03:06 - or job is equal to
03:09 - cashier
03:11 - that would also include Squidward he's
03:14 - not a cook but he is a cashier with the
03:17 - or logical operator only one condition
03:20 - needs to be true whereas with the
03:22 - andological operator both conditions
03:25 - must be true so that's the main
03:27 - difference between the and as well as or
03:29 - logical operators
03:31 - with the not logical operator not is a
03:34 - little different not basically reverses
03:37 - anything you say let's find any
03:39 - employees that are not a manager
03:42 - where not
03:44 - job equals
03:47 - manager
03:49 - we have all of our employees besides Mr
03:51 - Krabs we have cashiers Cooks assistant
03:54 - managers and janitors
03:56 - you can combine logical operators too
04:00 - let's find anybody that's not a manager
04:02 - and not an assistant manager let's add
04:07 - and not job equals assistant manager
04:14 - we have everybody besides a manager and
04:18 - besides an assistant manager Mr Krabs
04:21 - and Sandy are not within the results
04:23 - so that is the not logical operator it
04:26 - basically reverses whatever condition
04:28 - you write
04:29 - there's also between
04:31 - is used within a single column
04:34 - it's very similar to the andalogical
04:37 - operator except people prefer to use the
04:39 - between logical operator when working
04:41 - with the same column just because of its
04:43 - readability let's find any employees
04:45 - where the higher date is between January
04:48 - 4th and January 7th where higher date
04:52 - between two values
04:54 - 2023
04:56 - 0 1
04:58 - 0 4
04:59 - and
05:01 - 2023
05:04 - 0 1-07
05:08 - so we have SpongeBob Patrick Sandy
05:10 - Sheldon
05:11 - there's also the in logical operator we
05:14 - can find any values that are within a
05:16 - set let's find where job is in
05:23 - cook
05:25 - cashier
05:27 - or a janitor
05:31 - yep we have a cashier a cook a cook and
05:34 - a janitor there is more than one way to
05:36 - write a query where you need to match
05:38 - more than one condition really the best
05:40 - way depends on your data set basically
05:42 - speaking logical operators are used to
05:45 - check more than one condition but
05:47 - they're done so in different ways
05:48 - depending on the logical operator that
05:50 - you're using but yeah those are logical
05:52 - operators in MySQL

why hello again everybody guess who it's me again today I will be explaining logical operators in MySQL I would think of them as keywords that are used to combine more than one condition for my examples to make more sense I will add one more column a job column so let's alter our table of employees alter table employees add column job the data type will be varchar25 I'll add this column after our hourly pay column then select all from my table employees here is our job column let's add some jobs to our employees let's update employees set job equal to Let's select Mr Krabs he will be a manager then be sure to add a where Clause employee ID equals one Mr Krabs is a manager Squidward will be a cashier employee ID equals to SpongeBob employee ID3 he will be a cook Patrick will also be a cook Sandy will be an assistant manager let's abbreviate the word assistant manager Plankton Plankton will be a janitor how is this related to logical operators you're wondering well using logical operators we can check more than one condition suppose that our boss wants us to find any Cooks that were hired before January 5th how can we write a query that can satisfy those two conditions here's how we will use the and logical operator select all from our table employees using a where Clause we will write two conditions find any employees where the higher date is less than the year 2023 January 5th so far this would give us three results Mr Krabs Squidward and SpongeBob from these three employees how do we find any Cooks well we can add the and logical operator and we can write some other condition job is equal to cook there we have SpongeBob he is a cook that was hired before January 5th so that's the analogical operator you will return any results that match these two criteria another logical operator is or you can check more than one condition as long as one of those conditions is true that row will be true let's find any cooks or cashiers where the job is equal to cook that gives us both SpongeBob and Patrick they're both Cooks or job is equal to cashier that would also include Squidward he's not a cook but he is a cashier with the or logical operator only one condition needs to be true whereas with the andological operator both conditions must be true so that's the main difference between the and as well as or logical operators with the not logical operator not is a little different not basically reverses anything you say let's find any employees that are not a manager where not job equals manager we have all of our employees besides Mr Krabs we have cashiers Cooks assistant managers and janitors you can combine logical operators too let's find anybody that's not a manager and not an assistant manager let's add and not job equals assistant manager we have everybody besides a manager and besides an assistant manager Mr Krabs and Sandy are not within the results so that is the not logical operator it basically reverses whatever condition you write there's also between is used within a single column it's very similar to the andalogical operator except people prefer to use the between logical operator when working with the same column just because of its readability let's find any employees where the higher date is between January 4th and January 7th where higher date between two values 2023 0 1 0 4 and 2023 0 107 so we have SpongeBob Patrick Sandy Sheldon there's also the in logical operator we can find any values that are within a set let's find where job is in cook cashier or a janitor yep we have a cashier a cook a cook and a janitor there is more than one way to write a query where you need to match more than one condition really the best way depends on your data set basically speaking logical operators are used to check more than one condition but they're done so in different ways depending on the logical operator that you're using but yeah those are logical operators in MySQL
