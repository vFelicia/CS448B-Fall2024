00:00 - all right welcome back everybody in this
00:02 - topic I'm going to explain typecasting
00:05 - type casting is the process of
00:07 - converting a value of one data type to
00:10 - another we can convert integers to
00:12 - floats floats to integers strings to
00:14 - booleans booleans to Strings floats to
00:16 - Strings strings to integers integers to
00:18 - booleans I think you get the idea why
00:20 - might you want to use typecasting when
00:22 - we get to the lesson on accepting user
00:24 - input the user input is always a string
00:26 - if somebody were to type in a number and
00:28 - we need to perform math involving that
00:30 - number we would want to convert it to
00:32 - either an integer or a float another
00:34 - example is that if we had a floating
00:36 - Point number and we need to round that
00:38 - number to an integer one possible way is
00:40 - to cast it as an integer we can truncate
00:43 - the decimal portion there's two
00:44 - different ways we can do this explicitly
00:46 - and implicitly let's cover some explicit
00:50 - type casting I have four variables we
00:52 - need a string let's say a name type in
00:55 - your first name
00:56 - age that's good
01:00 - float how about a grade point average
01:02 - GPA for short
01:04 - my GPA will be a solid
01:07 - um 1.9 then we'll need a Boolean uh what
01:11 - about student are we a student if we're
01:13 - a student that would be true if not that
01:15 - would be false here's four variables of
01:18 - the four basic data types we have a
01:20 - string
01:21 - an integer a float and a Boolean if you
01:24 - ever need the data type of a variable
01:26 - you can use the built-in type function
01:29 - type the word type followed by a set of
01:33 - parentheses place a variable within the
01:35 - set of parentheses however when I run
01:37 - this we can't see anything so we need to
01:39 - place this statement within a print
01:41 - statement
01:42 - I'm going to type print add a set of
01:44 - parentheses
01:45 - we will cut this line of code
01:48 - and paste it within the print statement
01:50 - so we are printing the type of my
01:52 - variable name
01:54 - and that is Str which means it's a
01:57 - string let's do that with age GPA and
01:59 - student just so you're more familiar
02:01 - with using the type function
02:03 - we have age
02:06 - GPA
02:08 - and student
02:10 - here we are python says the data type of
02:13 - name is a string Str
02:15 - age is an integer int means integer
02:18 - GPA is a float
02:21 - then student is bull which means Boolean
02:24 - let's do some explicit conversion for
02:27 - practice I need to convert my variable
02:29 - age into a floating Point number I could
02:32 - take my variable age I could reassign
02:35 - this a value by using equals then I will
02:38 - explicitly cast age into a float by
02:41 - typing float a set of parentheses add my
02:44 - variable to be typecasted within the set
02:46 - of parentheses
02:48 - then let's print whatever age currently
02:50 - is look at that age is now
02:53 - 21.0 you can tell it's a float because
02:56 - it has a decimal portion if I were to
02:58 - use that type function again we can see
03:00 - what the data type of age is now
03:03 - and my variable age is a floating Point
03:06 - number that's how to cast a value as a
03:09 - float you type float add a set of
03:11 - parentheses place your value or variable
03:13 - within that set of parentheses then you
03:15 - may need to reassign it to something
03:17 - here we're just reassigning our variable
03:19 - age we know how to convert a value to a
03:21 - float let's try an integer I'll convert
03:24 - my GPA into an integer I'll take GPA set
03:27 - this equal to type int set of
03:30 - parentheses place my variable within the
03:33 - parentheses
03:34 - then I will print whatever my GPA is
03:38 - my GPA is now one so an integer it's a
03:42 - whole number we can't contain that
03:43 - decimal portion so it's truncated that's
03:45 - how to convert a value into an integer
03:49 - let's convert a value into a string how
03:51 - about this Boolean
03:54 - so student
03:55 - equals to convert a value or variable
03:58 - into a string type Str add a set of
04:02 - parentheses place your value or variable
04:04 - within that set of parentheses
04:06 - then let's print whatever our variable
04:09 - is after we reassign it
04:11 - so student still says true it appears
04:14 - the same as it did before but now it's
04:17 - treated as a series of characters rather
04:19 - than a Boolean just to prove to you that
04:21 - student is a string let's use the type
04:23 - function and Surround our student
04:25 - variable when we print it
04:28 - student is now a string so to convert a
04:31 - value or variable into a string you can
04:34 - use the built-in string function just
04:36 - type Str set of parentheses add your
04:38 - value or variable boom there you go
04:40 - all right lastly we can convert a value
04:42 - or variable into a Boolean so a Boolean
04:46 - can only be true or false what if we
04:48 - were to convert a number into a Boolean
04:50 - what would happen so let's take age
04:53 - equals to cast the value or variable
04:55 - into a Boolean you type bull set of
04:59 - parentheses add your value or variable
05:01 - I'll Place Edge within the set of
05:03 - parentheses
05:04 - then let's print whatever age is do you
05:06 - think the result is going to be true or
05:08 - false
05:10 - it's actually true when converting a
05:12 - number to a Boolean if that number is
05:15 - anything but zero it will always be true
05:18 - let's say age is like a million well
05:21 - it's still going to be true
05:23 - what about negative 1 million
05:25 - that is still true but if age were zero
05:30 - then it's false why would casting
05:32 - something as a Boolean be useful let's
05:34 - say that we ask a user to enter in their
05:36 - name I need to check to see if they
05:38 - entered in something let's type cast my
05:40 - name as a Boolean
05:44 - that is true but if this was an empty
05:46 - string
05:48 - that would be false
05:50 - even a space registers as true like I
05:52 - said we could use typecasting to check
05:54 - to see if somebody typed in their name
05:56 - or not if we cast the name as a Boolean
05:58 - and it's true that means they typed in
06:00 - something we'll have more practice with
06:02 - that later that is explicit typecasting
06:05 - all explicit typecasting is is manually
06:07 - converting a value or variable into a
06:10 - different data type by using one of
06:12 - these cast keywords we only covered four
06:14 - strings integers floats and booleans
06:17 - alright now let's go over implicit
06:19 - typecasting implicit typecasting is when
06:22 - a value or variable is converted into a
06:25 - different data type automatically for
06:27 - example let's say we have x x equals two
06:31 - then we have y y equals how about 2.0
06:36 - what if I were to reassign X and set x
06:39 - equal to x divided by y well we're
06:44 - dividing an integer by a float so what's
06:47 - the result going to be is X going to be
06:49 - an integer or a float so let's print
06:52 - whatever X's
06:55 - is now a float even though we assigned
06:58 - it to be an integer originally a whole
07:00 - number so that's implicit typecasting a
07:02 - variable's data type can be converted
07:05 - when you perform certain operations on
07:07 - it such as arithmetic expressions like
07:09 - this all right everybody so that is
07:10 - typecasting it's the process of
07:12 - converting a value of one data type to
07:14 - another you can convert strings to
07:16 - integers integers to floats floats to
07:18 - booleans booleans to Strings any
07:19 - combination of those and there's still
07:21 - more data types we didn't cover but
07:23 - that's the general idea so that is
07:25 - typecasting hey if you found this video
07:27 - helpful please be sure to smash that
