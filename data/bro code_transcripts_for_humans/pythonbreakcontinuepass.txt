00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's bro
00:02 - hope you're doing well
00:03 - and in this video i'm going to explain
00:05 - loop control statements in python so
00:07 - sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:12 - if you find this video helpful please
00:14 - remember to like
00:15 - comment and subscribe your support will
00:17 - help keep this channel running
00:19 - all right ladies and gentlemen let's
00:21 - talk about loop control statements
00:23 - these are used to change a loop's
00:25 - execution from its normal sequence
00:28 - and there are three we're going to
00:29 - discuss break continue
00:31 - and pass let's begin with break break is
00:33 - used to terminate the loop entirely
00:36 - now here's a good example of where a
00:37 - break would be useful
00:39 - let's say while true we're going to
00:42 - continually ask
00:43 - for somebody's name if they don't type
00:45 - in anything then we'll continue the
00:46 - while loop over and over again
00:48 - so let's say name equals input
00:53 - enter your name now
00:57 - if name does not equal
01:00 - a set of quotes that means they don't
01:02 - type in anything then
01:04 - we will break and break out of this
01:06 - while loop and
01:07 - let's test it enter your name nah i
01:10 - don't think so
01:11 - i'm too lazy to enter my name all right
01:13 - i can see that i'm not going to escape
01:14 - this while loop so i'm going to type in
01:16 - my name because i give up
01:18 - and hit enter therefore i will break and
01:20 - exit out of this while loop
01:22 - so a break is used to terminate the loop
01:24 - entirely when it's encountered
01:26 - next we have continue continue skips to
01:28 - the next iteration of the loop
01:30 - now let's say we have a phone number
01:33 - phone
01:34 - underscore number and i will set the
01:36 - sequel to
01:37 - let's say a random phone number
01:38 - including dashes 123-456-7890
01:44 - what i would like to do is to display
01:46 - this number within the console window
01:48 - without these dashes
01:49 - this is how to do that using a continue
01:52 - control statement
01:53 - for i in phone number
01:59 - so for each character within our string
02:01 - of phone number
02:02 - what we'll do is check to see if we
02:04 - encounter a dash character
02:07 - if i i is our index is equal to
02:11 - a dash then we want to continue
02:14 - and skip over this iteration of the loop
02:18 - so continue
02:21 - then i would like to print
02:24 - whatever our indexes whatever character
02:27 - we're working on
02:29 - so if i were to run this as it is it's
02:31 - going to print each digit
02:32 - on a new line so with print statements
02:35 - they will add a new line character to
02:37 - the end of your string
02:39 - and you can actually change that by
02:40 - adding to the end comma
02:42 - end equals and then a set of quotes so
02:45 - this will print my phone number without
02:47 - any dashes
02:48 - one two three four five six seven eight
02:50 - nine zero so that's a use of
02:52 - the continue control statement it skips
02:54 - to the next iteration of the loop
02:57 - last but not least we have pass pass
02:59 - does nothing
03:00 - it acts as a placeholder let's say that
03:02 - i would like to print the numbers
03:04 - 1 through 20 using a for loop for i
03:07 - in range 1 through 21 and remember that
03:11 - the second digit is
03:13 - exclusive so this will iterate once
03:15 - through the digits of 1 through
03:16 - 20. let's pretend that i'm highly
03:19 - superstitious and i don't want to print
03:21 - the number 13 because 13 is considered
03:23 - an unlucky number
03:24 - if i is equal to 13
03:28 - what we'll do is pass and pass acts as a
03:30 - placeholder and it won't do anything
03:32 - else print
03:35 - i that's one i there we go
03:39 - this will print the numbers 1 through 20
03:41 - and skip 13 because we used
03:43 - the past control statement which does
03:45 - nothing it acts as a placeholder
03:47 - so everybody those are loop control
03:49 - statements they change
03:51 - a loop's execution from its normal
03:53 - sequence we have break
03:54 - continue and pass so if you would like a
03:57 - copy of all this code i will post all of
03:59 - this in the comments section down below
04:01 - but yeah those are a few loop control
04:03 - statements in python
04:06 - hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you
04:08 - learned something new
04:09 - then help me help you in three easy
04:11 - steps
04:12 - by smashing that like button drop a
