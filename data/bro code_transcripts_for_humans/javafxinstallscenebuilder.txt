00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's bro
00:02 - hope you're doing well
00:03 - and in this video i'm going to
00:04 - demonstrate how we can install and set
00:06 - up
00:06 - scene builder for javafx so sit back
00:09 - relax and enjoy the show
00:13 - if you find this video helpful please
00:15 - remember to like
00:16 - comment and subscribe your support will
00:19 - help keep this channel running
00:21 - oh yeah are you ready for this in this
00:24 - video i'm going to be demonstrating how
00:26 - we can download and install
00:27 - scene builder for java fx this will be
00:29 - for both
00:30 - eclipse and intellij be sure to look in
00:33 - the description for any time stamps
00:34 - now the first step is to go to the
00:36 - internets and look this up
00:39 - javafx scenebuilder and then go to this
00:41 - website gluonhq.com
00:44 - oracle does have scene builder but it's
00:46 - not up to date so i would not recommend
00:48 - going to that site
00:49 - so let's go to gluonhq.com
00:52 - then go to download now and select
00:55 - whatever version you want i'm going to
00:56 - download the most recent version
00:58 - in this case it is 15 and select the
01:01 - appropriate download for your operating
01:02 - system
01:03 - i'm running windows so i'm going to
01:05 - download the windows version
01:07 - and then wait like a million years and
01:09 - it's done
01:10 - so once this is finished downloading you
01:12 - can open up this bad boy and finish the
01:14 - installation process
01:19 - i accept the terms in this license
01:21 - agreement yes i actually did read it
01:23 - that fast
01:24 - and click install and then
01:27 - wait like another million years and then
01:29 - click
01:30 - finish all right let's move on you'll
01:33 - want to remember
01:34 - the location of where this scene builder
01:36 - executable application is
01:38 - for me it's within my c drive program
01:42 - files
01:42 - within the scene builder folder and i
01:45 - would like to remember
01:46 - this location because it's going to be
01:47 - relevant later scenebuilder.exe
01:50 - for the next part of this video i'm
01:52 - going to walk you through how we can set
01:53 - up scene builder for eclipse
01:55 - if you're using intellij look in the
01:57 - description for any time stamps because
01:59 - i will walk you through intellij as well
02:01 - so if you're using eclipse we're ready
02:03 - to begin let's move on to
02:04 - step one we need to create a new fxml
02:07 - file to do that right click on your
02:09 - project folder then go to
02:11 - new other new
02:14 - fxml document next come up with a
02:18 - name for this file i'm going to name
02:19 - this main and finish
02:22 - step two is to link the scene builder
02:24 - executable
02:25 - to do that go to window preferences
02:29 - javafx and then browse for that location
02:33 - for the
02:33 - scene builder executable file so you can
02:36 - go to browse
02:37 - and then take a look for it for me this
02:39 - is within the
02:40 - c drive program files scene builder and
02:43 - then look for
02:45 - scenebuilder.exe open apply
02:48 - then apply and close step three is to
02:50 - open scene builder and to do that
02:52 - right click on your fxml file then go to
02:56 - open
02:56 - with scene builder
03:01 - and now we are within the scene builder
03:04 - gui application
03:05 - now if i may direct your attention to
03:07 - the left-hand side we have a
03:08 - library that contains various drop-down
03:11 - menus that have all sorts of different
03:13 - things
03:14 - there are various containers controls
03:17 - nodes menu items shapes charts and
03:20 - 3d effects so feel free to take a moment
03:23 - to browse through these menus
03:24 - for anything that you might find
03:26 - interesting and below our library
03:28 - is a hierarchy of different containers
03:31 - and
03:31 - nodes that we can add to our container
03:33 - by default you may have an anchor pin
03:35 - and for whatever reason it doesn't like
03:37 - to appear when you start up scene
03:38 - builder
03:39 - so an easy fix for that is to just go to
03:42 - containers
03:42 - and then add your pane that you would
03:45 - like i would recommend
03:46 - adding the anchor pan to begin with and
03:48 - then just drag this
03:49 - to our work surface and now we have a
03:52 - pane that we can reshape
03:53 - and add different nodes to so let's add
03:55 - some nodes
03:56 - what about buttons but you can pick
03:58 - something different if you want
04:00 - click on a node that you want and then
04:02 - drag it and drop it wherever you want
04:04 - so i'll just add a whole bunch of
04:06 - buttons for no reason
04:08 - you get a button you get a button
04:10 - everybody gets a button
04:11 - okay i would say that i'm fairly
04:13 - satisfied with this to
04:15 - save your project go to file save and
04:18 - once your file is saved you can close
04:20 - out of scene builder and
04:22 - let's head back to eclipse now we are on
04:24 - the last step
04:25 - we need to add one line of code to our
04:28 - start method
04:29 - so replace this line that contains
04:32 - our root node because we're going to
04:34 - create a
04:35 - root node based on our fxml file so
04:38 - add this line of code if this is not
04:40 - here already
04:42 - parent root equals
04:45 - fx ml loader
04:50 - dot load and within this method here we
04:53 - have a few things to add
04:55 - get class dot
04:58 - get resource and the resource that we're
05:02 - going to get
05:03 - is the name of our fxml file so
05:06 - within quotes main dot fx
05:10 - ml and then i am just missing that
05:13 - semicolon at the end
05:15 - all right you may need to add any
05:16 - necessary imports so be sure to do that
05:18 - as well
05:20 - so i need to import parent add fxml
05:23 - loader
05:24 - now if you were to run this the way it
05:26 - is you may run into a
05:27 - null pointer exception location is
05:30 - required
05:31 - that's because our fxml file is located
05:34 - outside of our application package there
05:36 - are two different fixes
05:38 - to this one when we name our resource we
05:40 - could precede this with a
05:42 - forward slash so that we know to look
05:44 - outside of our application package
05:47 - and this should work or what you could
05:50 - do
05:51 - is delete that forward slash and take
05:53 - your fxml file
05:55 - and drag it to your application package
05:57 - and this would work as well
05:59 - just like that now you may have noticed
06:01 - that the size of the window does not
06:03 - display
06:04 - the entire scene that's because you may
06:07 - have some dimensions
06:08 - passed in as arguments to the scene
06:10 - constructor so if you were to delete
06:12 - those
06:13 - and only pass in our root node well then
06:15 - you should be able to see
06:16 - the entire scene just like that
06:20 - well everybody that is how to set up
06:22 - scene builder for eclipse for part two
06:25 - we're going to set up scene builder for
06:26 - intellij
06:28 - all right part two of this video i'm
06:30 - going to demonstrate how we can set up
06:32 - javafx scene builder for intellij i have
06:36 - a fresh new project so the first thing
06:38 - that i'm going to do
06:39 - is link scene builder to intellij and to
06:42 - do that
06:43 - go to file then settings
06:46 - right here go to languages and
06:48 - frameworks
06:49 - java fx and then find the path
06:52 - to your scene builder exe so for me that
06:55 - is located within the c
06:57 - drive program files scene builder
07:00 - scenebuilder.exe
07:01 - and you can always open this folder to
07:03 - browse for it so once you have that
07:05 - click apply then okay step two is to
07:09 - open scene builder and to do that
07:10 - navigate to your fxml file and that for
07:14 - me is located within my
07:16 - source folder so i'm going to right
07:17 - click on this then
07:19 - open in scene builder
07:24 - all right we are now within scene
07:26 - builder if you look to the left we have
07:28 - a library with a bunch of drop down
07:30 - menus
07:31 - we have different components for
07:33 - containers controls
07:35 - nodes menu items shapes charts and 3d
07:38 - effects
07:39 - and on the bottom here we have a
07:41 - hierarchy of all of our different items
07:44 - that we have
07:45 - now to begin i'm just going to delete
07:46 - this grid pane because
07:48 - i wouldn't recommend that for beginners
07:50 - let's create an anchor pin
07:52 - so go to containers and then drag and
07:54 - drop your anchor pane
07:55 - to your workspace here and then you can
07:57 - reshape this
07:59 - let's make it a square now you can
08:01 - navigate through these drop down menus
08:03 - and
08:03 - drag and drop any nodes that you might
08:05 - like let's add a bunch of buttons for no
08:07 - apparent reason
08:08 - so you just click on it then drag it
08:10 - then drop it wherever you want
08:12 - once you're satisfied with whatever
08:14 - monstrosity that you built it's time to
08:16 - save it so to save this file go to
08:18 - file then save and that's how to save it
08:21 - and now we can close out of scene
08:22 - builder and head back to intellij
08:25 - now within your start method make sure
08:27 - you have this line of code
08:28 - this is to create the root node and this
08:30 - is linked to our
08:32 - fxml file that we used with scene
08:34 - builder
08:35 - so make sure you have this line parent
08:38 - root
08:38 - equals fxml loader dot load
08:42 - within the load method add get class
08:46 - get resource and the resource should
08:48 - have the same name as your fxml file
08:51 - and when you run this this should
08:53 - display your scene that you created
08:56 - but there is one catch to this it's not
08:59 - displaying the entire scene although you
09:01 - can resize it
09:02 - so if you have some dimensions passed in
09:05 - to your scene constructor
09:06 - you'll probably want to get rid of those
09:09 - now if i were to run this again
09:10 - only passing in the root node to our
09:13 - scene
09:14 - this window should display the entire
09:16 - scene that we created
09:19 - all right it works well everyone that is
09:22 - how to
09:23 - download install and set up scene
09:25 - builder for java fx
09:27 - if you would like a copy of all the
09:28 - steps i will post those in the
09:30 - description and in the comments section
09:32 - down below but yeah that is how to set
09:35 - up scene builder
09:36 - for javafx hey you
09:39 - yeah i'm talking to you if you learned
09:41 - something new then help me
09:43 - help you in three easy steps by smashing
09:46 - that like button
