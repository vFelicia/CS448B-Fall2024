00:00 - hey everybody today I need to explain
00:01 - pagination in HTML and CSS pagination is
00:05 - the method by which a document is
00:07 - separated into pages and numbers are
00:09 - given using pagination on a website we
00:12 - can move between Pages easily it's kind
00:14 - of like you're reading a book each page
00:15 - has a number pagination might also be
00:17 - useful on your web page if you need to
00:19 - limit the results maybe you only want so
00:21 - many results per page then you can
00:23 - easily navigate between the pages
00:25 - there's many different uses so let's
00:27 - begin
00:28 - we'll start with our index file I will
00:31 - create an H1 element
00:33 - with the title of this is page number
00:36 - one
00:37 - then we'll create some sample text
00:41 - within a paragraph element I'll type
00:43 - lorem then hit tab to generate some text
00:46 - usually with pagination it's found at
00:49 - the bottom of a web page so that's a
00:51 - good place for it right here there's
00:53 - many different ways in which we can
00:55 - create pagination but using only what we
00:57 - know so far that I've covered in this
00:58 - series here's one way we'll create a
01:01 - development
01:02 - with a class of pagination
01:06 - then be sure to close it
01:09 - within this development we'll create
01:11 - several hyperlinks
01:14 - we'll need an a tag I'll set the href
01:17 - attribute just to be empty for now and
01:19 - then we'll close it
01:21 - for this example let's create a total of
01:23 - seven links we have one two three four
01:27 - five six seven
01:29 - beginning with the second link that will
01:31 - be one then two three four five
01:36 - for my first link I'll use a left angle
01:38 - bracket this is so we can navigate
01:40 - backwards depending on what page we're
01:41 - on and with the last link I'll use a
01:44 - right angle bracket so we can navigate
01:46 - forwards
01:48 - we'll revisit this page let's head to
01:50 - our style sheet
01:51 - the first thing I'm going to do is
01:53 - Center all of these links within my div
01:55 - element
01:56 - I'm selecting my class of pagination
02:00 - I will use the text align property set
02:04 - it to Center
02:07 - then I would like to style all of these
02:09 - links these hyperlinks
02:13 - we're starting with our pagination class
02:15 - then I would like any a elements found
02:18 - within the pagination class
02:20 - let's change the color
02:22 - I will set the color to be black
02:26 - let's eliminate the text decoration that
02:29 - is the underlining
02:32 - text decoration none
02:36 - I'll add a little bit of padding
02:40 - eight pixels by 15 pixels
02:43 - I will display these elements as an
02:46 - inline block
02:49 - basically by setting these elements to
02:51 - have a display property of inline block
02:53 - we can adjust the width and height of
02:55 - these elements but what we have is good
02:57 - already alright so far so good
03:00 - going back to our HTML file I'm going to
03:02 - make one change we're beginning with
03:04 - page one
03:06 - that's our index file
03:08 - with this anchor tag I will set the
03:10 - class to be active
03:14 - within our CSS file we're taking our
03:17 - pagination class
03:19 - find all a elements within our
03:21 - pagination class then find any active
03:24 - classes
03:28 - so it's going to look a little strange
03:29 - within the pagination class
03:31 - within any anchor tags find the class
03:35 - that's active
03:36 - so in this case it would be page one
03:39 - I will change the background color of
03:42 - that element
03:43 - background color
03:45 - let's pick a greenish color
03:48 - but feel free to pick any color you like
03:52 - that's pretty good
03:55 - let's try and make the font weight bold
03:57 - I want to see what that looks like
04:00 - okay not bad
04:02 - this part's optional but I'll add a
04:04 - border radius around this element the
04:06 - one that's currently highlighted
04:08 - border radius
04:10 - 5 pixel seems fine yeah that looks
04:13 - pretty good
04:14 - all right now if any element is not
04:17 - active we can style them
04:20 - this part's going to look a little
04:21 - strange
04:22 - select the pagination class
04:25 - with any a elements we will use the
04:29 - hover pseudo class
04:30 - if these elements are hovered over but
04:33 - they're not active then I'd like to
04:35 - highlight them we'll use the not pseudo
04:38 - class
04:39 - find any elements that are not within
04:42 - the active class
04:44 - I will change the background color
04:48 - to something maybe Gray like that
04:54 - then I'll add a border radius of 5
04:55 - pixels
04:57 - when we hover over these inactive links
05:00 - they should change in color
05:02 - let me make that a little bit lighter
05:04 - though
05:06 - that looks pretty good
05:09 - now we need some functionality for these
05:10 - pages
05:14 - if we click on one that should take us
05:16 - to our first file which is named
05:19 - index.html or it could be named
05:21 - something else for you the second link
05:23 - will bring us to a page named page two
05:25 - which we still need to create
05:28 - then page 3.html
05:32 - page4.html
05:35 - page five dot HTML now with these back
05:39 - and forwards buttons
05:40 - we can easily navigate through pages
05:42 - using JavaScript but unfortunately we
05:44 - really don't know JavaScript at this
05:46 - point at this point in time the easiest
05:48 - way for us to move forwards or backwards
05:50 - using these arrows is to list a specific
05:53 - file if we're on page one and we need to
05:55 - move forwards that will bring us to page
05:57 - two
05:58 - for the last hyperlink I will set that
06:01 - to be page 2. if we're on page one then
06:04 - we hit the backwards button while we're
06:06 - really not going to go anywhere we can
06:08 - either leave this link empty or we can
06:10 - refresh the page just by listing the
06:13 - page that we're currently on now we need
06:15 - to create these pages
06:17 - what I'm going to do is go to our
06:19 - website folder I will copy this index
06:22 - file paste it
06:24 - then rename this copy as page2.html
06:31 - let's copy page two paste it change page
06:35 - to copy to page three
06:39 - we're going to do this all the way until
06:40 - we reach page five
06:52 - now if we go to page two
06:54 - let's change the title to be page two
06:58 - the back button will bring us to our
07:00 - index file also known as page 1 in this
07:02 - case
07:04 - let's set the class of active to be
07:07 - within the anchor tag page two
07:11 - then if we move forwards we want to go
07:14 - to page three
07:16 - so then if we go to page three
07:19 - if we move backwards we're going to page
07:21 - two
07:24 - set the class that's currently active to
07:26 - be on page three
07:31 - then if we go forwards we're on page
07:33 - four
07:37 - oh be sure to change the title too I
07:39 - forgot
07:40 - one two three we're good
07:43 - then on page four this is Page four
07:46 - if we move backwards we're going to go
07:48 - to page three
07:51 - change the class to reflect page four
07:56 - if we move forwards we'll go to page
07:58 - five
08:01 - then lastly on page five this is page
08:04 - five
08:06 - if we move backwards we're going to page
08:08 - four
08:11 - move the class over to page five
08:15 - then we can't really go forwards so I'm
08:17 - just going to set the forward button to
08:20 - be page five again just to refresh it
08:22 - or you can eliminate it either way
08:25 - all right let's see if this works be
08:27 - sure to save everything
08:29 - so we should be able to move between the
08:30 - pages by clicking on these buttons or
08:32 - the arrows we're on page one we can go
08:35 - to page two three four five
08:39 - we can also use the arrows
08:41 - two three four five four three two one
08:47 - all right everybody so that's pagination
08:49 - it's a method by which a document is
08:51 - separated into pages and that is simple
08:53 - pagination in CSS
