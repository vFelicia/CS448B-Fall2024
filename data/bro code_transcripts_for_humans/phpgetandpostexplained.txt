00:00 - hey again everybody it's me and in
00:02 - today's topic I'm going to explain the
00:04 - get and post variables in PHP get and
00:07 - post are both special variables
00:09 - technically they're super Global
00:11 - variables but that's a topic for another
00:13 - day just think of them as special
00:15 - variables for now these variables are
00:17 - used to collect data from an HTML form
00:20 - if you have an opening form tag in HTML
00:22 - you can use the action attribute then
00:25 - send some data to some PHP file whatever
00:27 - you list here there's two different
00:29 - methods get and post they each have
00:32 - their own advantages and disadvantages
00:34 - which we'll discuss later for the time
00:37 - being before our PHP script let's create
00:39 - an HTML document in vs code to do that
00:43 - you would type exclamation point then
00:45 - hit tab then be sure to follow our HTML
00:48 - document with a PHP script then I'm
00:50 - going to open up a web browser in our
00:52 - HTML document we're going to create a
00:54 - form a user is going to type in a
00:56 - username a password then to log in
00:59 - they're going to a login button let's
01:01 - create that we'll need a label to begin
01:03 - with
01:05 - we'll need to close the label
01:09 - I'll add a line break
01:11 - the label will say user name
01:14 - then we'll add a text box use the input
01:17 - tag it's a self-closing tag
01:20 - add a line break
01:22 - within the input tag we will set the
01:25 - type to equal text because it's a text
01:28 - box
01:29 - then we will set the name to be
01:33 - user name
01:36 - let's copy our label and our text box
01:41 - paste these two lines again
01:43 - but change username to password this
01:45 - time
01:46 - the type will be password
01:49 - the name will be password
01:53 - so you can type something into your
01:54 - username if you were to type within the
01:57 - password box it should be hidden which
01:59 - is good then lastly We'll add a button
02:01 - we'll use a self-closing input tag
02:05 - the type will be submit it's a submit
02:08 - button
02:09 - the value is the text on the button
02:12 - let's set that to be a log in
02:15 - so we have a button but it currently
02:17 - doesn't do anything we will enclose all
02:19 - of our elements within a form tag
02:25 - be sure to open it then close it
02:28 - I will indent all of this within my
02:31 - opening form tag I will set the action
02:33 - attribute to be a file in which I want
02:36 - to send this data to I will send this
02:39 - data to the PHP script of the same file
02:42 - so my file is index.php I will list that
02:46 - here
02:47 - index.php if you had a separate PHP file
02:50 - you would just change the file name to
02:52 - reflect that or the file path then we
02:55 - will set the method attribute to be
02:57 - either get or post we'll begin with get
03:01 - so let's type in a username make up a
03:04 - password
03:05 - and this still doesn't do anything
03:07 - within our PHP script we're going to
03:09 - utilize the get variable because we're
03:12 - using the get method
03:14 - let's Echo then type dollar sign
03:17 - underscore the word get so get is a
03:21 - special type of variable it can hold
03:23 - more than one value if you're familiar
03:25 - with arrays it's technically an array
03:27 - within get we have both a username and a
03:30 - password I would like just the username
03:32 - to get just the username after the get
03:35 - variable add a set of square brackets
03:38 - then within a set of quotes type in the
03:40 - name of the information you're getting I
03:42 - would like the username
03:45 - let's see what happens
03:48 - I'm going to save
03:49 - type in a username make up a password
03:53 - log in
03:54 - and there's my username
03:56 - now let's do this with the password as
03:58 - well
04:00 - Echo get password
04:03 - so let's refresh everything I'll make up
04:05 - a username type in a password
04:09 - there's my username there's my password
04:11 - I'm going to put my password on a new
04:13 - line I need a line break there's a
04:16 - couple different ways in which we can do
04:17 - this you can use some string
04:19 - concatenation
04:20 - one way to do that is to type dot
04:23 - followed by a line break within quotes
04:28 - I'll do that for the second line as well
04:30 - so that would work my preferred method
04:33 - is to do something like this
04:36 - I'm going to surround my get variable
04:38 - with quotes
04:40 - then add a set of curly braces around
04:42 - our get variable
04:48 - then add a line break
04:56 - bro make up a password log in there we
05:00 - are if using the get variable and you
05:02 - need to add a line break this is my
05:04 - preferred way although there's more than
05:05 - one way use whatever suits you now with
05:08 - get we have one problem if we were to
05:10 - take a look at the URL of this document
05:14 - when using the get method of a form any
05:16 - data sent over to a PHP form is appended
05:19 - to the URL username equals bro and
05:22 - password equals pizza123 there's no
05:25 - security because we're appending some
05:27 - sensitive information such as a password
05:28 - to the URL that's where post comes in I
05:32 - will change the method to post let's see
05:35 - what happens
05:38 - I'll type in my first name
05:40 - make up a password
05:42 - and login
05:44 - so we have an undefined array key if
05:47 - you're using the post method let's
05:49 - change get to be post
05:55 - make up a username type in a password
05:59 - log in there's my username there's my
06:01 - password
06:02 - and if I were to take a look at the URL
06:05 - my sensitive data isn't appended to the
06:08 - URL the post method is more secure than
06:11 - get but they each have their own
06:13 - advantages and disadvantages
06:15 - with the get method data is appended to
06:17 - the URL it's not secure I wouldn't pass
06:20 - any like usernames or passwords using a
06:22 - get method there's a character limit
06:24 - however with the get method bookmarking
06:28 - a page with values as possible get
06:30 - requests can be cached get tends to be
06:33 - better for a search page now with post
06:35 - data is packaged inside the body of the
06:39 - HTTP request it's more secure than get
06:42 - there's no data limit Pages involving a
06:45 - post request can't be bookmarked and the
06:48 - requests are not cached post tends to be
06:50 - better for submitting credentials like a
06:52 - username and a password any sensitive
06:54 - information so if security matters use
06:57 - post if it doesn't get might be better
06:59 - now let's cover an exercise let's clear
07:02 - our PHP form
07:05 - then within the body of our document we
07:08 - will create an order page for a
07:09 - restaurant we will Begin by creating a
07:12 - form
07:13 - we'll need a pair of form tags then be
07:15 - sure to close it
07:18 - within my opening form tag I will set
07:21 - the action attribute
07:23 - to be a file or a file location
07:27 - I will send this data to my index.php
07:30 - file
07:31 - for the method let's use post
07:37 - for my order form let's create a text
07:39 - box for a quantity
07:42 - I'll create a label
07:43 - I'll close it right away
07:47 - let's change the text to quantity
07:51 - then I'll add a line break
07:54 - we'll add a text box
07:57 - input the type is text
08:02 - the name will be quantity
08:07 - we'll use the input tag
08:09 - set the type attribute to B submit
08:14 - then value
08:16 - equals
08:17 - how about total we're calculating a
08:20 - total now within my PHP script let's say
08:23 - we have a food item I'll create a
08:26 - variable item equals make up some food
08:29 - like pizza
08:32 - we'll need a price
08:34 - price equals make up a price 5.99 sounds
08:37 - good
08:38 - then a quantity whatever the user is
08:40 - going to type in that is found within
08:42 - the post variable
08:45 - dollar sign underscore post
08:48 - add a set of square brackets semicolon
08:51 - within the square brackets I would like
08:53 - the quantity
08:56 - now this is a personal choice what I
08:58 - like to do is that if I'm accessing the
09:00 - get or post super variable
09:03 - I like to store the result within a
09:05 - local variable
09:07 - so I'm going to create a quantity
09:09 - variable
09:11 - quantity equals whatever our quantity is
09:14 - from our HTML form I find caching one of
09:17 - these values within a local variable
09:19 - more convenient to work with
09:22 - so let's Echo a message like an order
09:24 - total
09:26 - you have ordered
09:31 - let's use our quantity
09:33 - to T
09:35 - X what's our item pizzas
09:39 - item I'll add s because it may be plural
09:46 - then we'll calculate a total Echo
09:50 - you know what let's create a total
09:51 - variable as well
09:53 - total I'll set that to be null because
09:55 - we'll assign a value later
09:59 - total equals
10:03 - quantity
10:06 - times variable price
10:10 - then we'll Echo
10:12 - your total is
10:16 - add a placeholder our variable total
10:18 - then I will precede our placeholder with
10:21 - the dollar sign
10:22 - but we need to use that escape sequence
10:26 - all right let's save everything
10:29 - enter in a quantity I want three pizzas
10:33 - oh we need a line break as well
10:39 - you have ordered three x pizzas your
10:41 - total is 17.97
10:46 - and if I were to look at the URL
10:48 - we're using the post method so our
10:50 - quantity is not going to be appended to
10:52 - the URL
10:54 - if I were to use get let's replace post
10:56 - with get
10:58 - do that here as well
11:03 - I'm going to type in three pizzas again
11:05 - hit total I can change the url to
11:09 - reflect a different quantity like maybe
11:11 - I want 30 pizzas
11:12 - then resubmit you have ordered 30 pizzas
11:16 - the grand total is
11:19 - 179.70 that's one of the reasons why
11:22 - post is more secure than get you can
11:24 - change the url to reflect a different
11:26 - value alright everybody so that is both
11:28 - the get and post variables in PHP if
11:32 - you're enjoying my Series so far let me

hey again everybody it's me and in today's topic I'm going to explain the get and post variables in PHP get and post are both special variables technically they're super Global variables but that's a
