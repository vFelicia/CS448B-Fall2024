00:00 - hey everybody in this video I'm going to
00:01 - show you how we can connect to an API
00:03 - using python in this demonstration we're
00:06 - going to connect to the Poke API to get
00:08 - some information on a Pokémon of our
00:10 - choosing I'm assuming that most of us
00:12 - are familiar with Pokémon I thought it'd
00:13 - be a fun example so according to this
00:16 - API we can look up a Pokémon such as
00:21 - Pikachu then we can get the stats for
00:24 - Pikachu such as Pikachu's
00:27 - name height ID number and all sorts of
00:31 - moves and abilities that a Pikachu may
00:33 - have we will need this URL but we'll
00:36 - handle that
00:39 - later our first step is that we're going
00:41 - to import the requests library to make
00:44 - an API request however when I run this I
00:48 - have a module not found error no module
00:51 - named requests requests is one package
00:54 - will have to install it's not normally
00:56 - included with the standard python
00:57 - download if I was to go to my folder go
01:01 - to my virtual environment library site
01:04 - packages there is no package for
01:07 - requests we'll have to download that
01:10 - with pycharm and vs code there is a
01:12 - built-in terminal that we can
01:13 - use to download the request package we
01:16 - can use pip pip is a package manager for
01:19 - python it's normally included when you
01:21 - install python we'll type pip install
01:26 - requests it'll take just a second
01:31 - and now we have that package of requests
01:32 - within our project
01:34 - folder if I run this
01:36 - again that error goes away process
01:39 - finished with exit Code Zero that means
01:42 - there were no
01:43 - errors going back to our Pokemon API we
01:46 - will need this
01:48 - URL let me zoom in so you can see
01:54 - it I'm going to store that as a base URL
01:58 - so it's easier to work with
02:01 - for convenience I'm going to create a
02:03 - function name get
02:07 - Pokemon
02:08 - info to get some info on a Pokémon we'll
02:11 - have to pass in the name of a Pokemon
02:13 - for now I'll write pass outside of this
02:17 - function let's say we have a variable of
02:20 - Pokemon
02:21 - name pick a
02:23 - Pokemon I will pick Pikachu for now then
02:27 - I will call the get Pokemon info
02:29 - function
02:30 - then pass in my Pokémon
02:32 - name remember that your parameters can
02:35 - be named different than your arguments
02:37 - when you send data to a function you can
02:39 - rename it to something else
02:41 - temporarily now that we have the name of
02:43 - the Pokémon we would like to look up we
02:45 - can complete the
02:47 - URL this will be an F
02:50 - string so with our Pokemon API we have
02:53 - the base URL followed by the word
02:56 - Pokemon then the name of a Pokemon
03:00 - so we have the basee URL I'll add a
03:03 - placeholder and insert it forward slash
03:06 - the word
03:07 - Pokemon slash the name of that
03:11 - Pokémon in this example it's going to be
03:14 - Pikachu we now have the full
03:17 - URL we'll access the request module use
03:21 - the get method and pass in that
03:24 - URL this method is going to return a
03:27 - response object which I will assign to
03:30 - response response is a response
03:33 - object and I'm just going to print our
03:36 - response just to see what we're working
03:40 - with here's our response object it has a
03:43 - status code this is an HTTP status code
03:46 - of 200 200 means the response was
03:50 - okay here's a few examples of response
03:53 - codes you're probably familiar with 404
03:57 - not found
04:00 - so we are looking for 200 the response
04:03 - is
04:05 - okay after we get our
04:08 - response I'll add an if
04:10 - statement if our response our response
04:14 - object does have an attribute of status
04:16 - code to read what the status code is if
04:19 - this status code is equal to 200 that
04:23 - means the response is okay but for now
04:26 - I'll write
04:27 - pass else I'm going to print the
04:30 - following else I'm going to print failed
04:35 - to retrieve
04:38 - data and I will print the status code of
04:41 - the response
04:45 - object so temporarily I will print data
04:49 - retrieved if it was
04:53 - successful I can't spell
04:56 - okay we have our data data was retrieved
05:01 - if our status code of our response
05:03 - object is equal to
05:05 - 200 I will take our response object and
05:09 - use the Json
05:10 - method our response is a Json format
05:14 - using this method we'll convert it to a
05:15 - python dictionary it will consist of key
05:18 - value pairs much like a Json file but
05:21 - I'm going to assign that to a variable
05:24 - of Pokemon data so it's easier to work
05:28 - with
05:31 - then I will print our Pokemon
05:37 - data so here's the data on Pikachu it's
05:41 - really difficult to read all
05:43 - this you can see some keywords we have
05:46 - abilities base experience this is an
05:49 - extremely large
05:52 - dictionary once we have our dictionary I
05:55 - will return that dictionary of Pokemon
05:58 - data back to the place where we called
06:01 - this
06:01 - function and I will store that as a
06:04 - variable Pokemon info equals get Pokemon
06:09 - info pass in a Pokemon's
06:12 - name and now we should have a dictionary
06:15 - that we can work with let me zoom
06:19 - out if our dictionary exists we can use
06:22 - the if
06:23 - keyword if Pokémon info if that's true
06:27 - if it exists this will be true
06:30 - I will print the following I'll use an F
06:34 - string to access the value of a
06:36 - dictionary we can access it by a key
06:39 - we'll take our dictionary of Pokemon
06:41 - info access the key of
06:45 - name let's see what happens
06:48 - exactly we get Pikachu let's get
06:51 - Pikachu's ID
06:53 - number we will access the key of ID the
06:57 - given value is 25 Pikachu is the 25th
07:01 - Pokemon in the
07:05 - franchise let's get Pikachu's
07:09 - height Pikachu's height is four I don't
07:12 - know what unit of measurement they use
07:13 - in that franchise 4et or 4 Ines I don't
07:17 - know let's get Pikachu's
07:22 - weight Pikachu's weight is 60 60 lb 60
07:27 - kog I don't know just to make this look
07:30 - nice I'm going to add
07:32 - Name
07:36 - ID
07:38 - height and
07:41 - weight that looks much better let's pick
07:45 - a different Pokemon I will pick my
07:47 - favorite Pokemon of
07:54 - tyion failed to retrieve
07:57 - data does that have to be a lowercase
08:01 - yes it does okay so name
08:04 - tyan I'll follow the name with the
08:06 - capitalize method to make it
08:12 - capital there we go so my favorite
08:15 - Pokemon is
08:16 - tyan ID is 157 Ty loan's height is 17
08:21 - and weight is
08:23 - 795 all right everybody that is one way
08:26 - in which we can connect to an API using
08:28 - python also tell tell me what your
08:29 - favorite Pokémon is in the comment
08:31 - section down below

hey everybody in this video I'm going to show you how we can connect to an API using python in this demonstration we're going to connect to the Poke API to get some information on a Pokémon of our

such as Pikachu's name height ID number and all sorts of moves and abilities that a Pikachu may have we will need this URL but we'll handle that later our first step is that we're going to import the requests library to make an API request however when I run this I have a module not found error no module named requests requests is one package will have to install it's not normally included with the standard python download if I was to go to my folder go to my virtual environment library site packages there is no package for requests we'll have to download that with pycharm and vs code there is a builtin terminal that we can use to download the request package we can use pip pip is a package manager for python it's normally included when you install python we'll type pip install requests it'll take just a second and now we have that package of requests within our project folder if I run this again that error goes away process finished with exit Code Zero that means there were no errors going back to our Pokemon API we will need this URL let me zoom in so you can see it I'm going to store that as a base URL so it's easier to work with for convenience I'm going to create a function name get Pokemon info to get some info on a Pokémon we'll have to pass in the name of a Pokemon for now I'll write pass outside of this function let's say we have a variable of Pokemon name pick a Pokemon I will pick Pikachu for now then I will call the get Pokemon info function then pass in my Pokémon name remember that your parameters can be named different than your arguments when you send data to a function you can rename it to something else temporarily now that we have the name of the Pokémon we would like to look up we can complete the URL this will be an F string so with our

temporarily I will print data retrieved if it was successful I can't spell okay we have our data data was retrieved if our status code of our response object is equal to 200 I will take our response

store that as a variable Pokemon info equals get Pokemon info pass in a Pokemon's name and now we should have a dictionary that we can work with let me zoom out if our dictionary exists we can use the if keyword if Pokémon info if that's true if it exists this will be true I will print the following I'll use an F string to access the value of a dictionary we can access it by a key we'll take our dictionary of Pokemon info access the key of name let's see what happens exactly we get Pikachu let's get Pikachu's ID number we will access the key of ID the given value is 25 Pikachu is the 25th Pokemon in the franchise let's get Pikachu's height Pikachu's height is four I don't know what unit of measurement they use in that franchise 4et or 4 Ines I don't know let's get Pikachu's weight Pikachu's weight is 60 60 lb 60 kog I don't know just to make this look nice I'm going to add Name ID height and weight that looks much better let's pick a different Pokemon I will pick my favorite
