00:00 - all right let's do this thing today I
00:02 - got to talk about radio buttons in pi
00:04 - qt5 to work with radio buttons we will
00:06 - need the following imports from the
00:08 - module of QT widgets we will need the
00:12 - class of Q radio button as well as Q
00:17 - button group to group together different
00:21 - buttons let's create three radio buttons
00:24 - within the Constructor of my main window
00:27 - we will construct three radio buttons
00:29 - for the first radio button this will be
00:31 - named radio one we will call the
00:34 - Constructor of the class Q radio button
00:38 - then we can pass in some text what is
00:40 - the radio button going to say let's say
00:43 - that we're working with payment options
00:45 - let's say visa for the first option then
00:48 - for the second argument I will pass
00:50 - inself we will add this radio button
00:53 - directly to our window that would be
00:55 - self let's create two more additional
00:58 - radio buttons radio Radio 2 and radio 3
01:02 - the text of radio button two will be
01:05 - MasterCard and three will be a gift card
01:09 - we are selecting different payment
01:11 - options we need to set the geometry of
01:14 - these radio buttons because we're not
01:16 - using a layout
01:17 - manager I have a method to initialize my
01:20 - user interface this is where I will set
01:22 - the geometry of my radio buttons so
01:25 - let's say self. radio1 we will call the
01:29 - set set geometry method pass in some
01:32 - coordinates 0 0 is good that applies to
01:35 - the top left corner of my window for the
01:38 - width 300 and the height 50 is good
01:42 - let's do this with radio buttons 2 and
01:44 - three Radio 2 radio 3 we'll just move
01:48 - each radio button down on the Y AIS by
01:51 - 50 pixels each so 50 then
01:55 - 100 here are the three radio buttons
01:58 - however the font is kind of small we can
02:00 - barely see it so let's apply a
02:03 - stylesheet here's a trick that we can do
02:05 - with stylesheets we can apply multiple
02:08 - CSS like properties to an entire group
02:11 - of widgets rather than having to type
02:13 - them and apply them individually we will
02:16 - select our window of self set the
02:19 - stylesheet of our window with the set
02:22 - stylesheet
02:24 - method we will add a selector the
02:27 - selector is going to be the name of the
02:28 - widget
02:30 - Q radio button in this case then add a
02:32 - set of curly
02:36 - braces we can apply CSS like properties
02:39 - to an entire group of widgets this way
02:43 - so let's set the font size of all radio
02:46 - buttons to be 40
02:50 - pixels
02:52 - better let's set the font
02:54 - family to be
02:57 - aial then I will add a little bit of P
02:59 - padding around each radio
03:01 - button padding 10
03:06 - pixels that's pretty good so with radio
03:10 - buttons we can only select one from any
03:12 - one radio button group if I was making a
03:15 - payment I can't pay with a Visa and
03:18 - Mastercard at the same time I can only
03:20 - select one option that's the point of
03:23 - radio buttons we're limited to just one
03:25 - option with the default behavior of Pi
03:28 - qt5 all radio buttons unless explicitly
03:32 - stated are all part of the same group to
03:35 - demonstrate that let's create two
03:37 - additional radio buttons Radio 4 and
03:40 - Radio 5 radio button 4 will be for a
03:43 - payment method rather than a payment
03:45 - type for example we could say we're
03:47 - paying in
03:50 - store radio button 5 will be we're
03:53 - paying online radio buttons 1 through 3
03:56 - will be for the payment type radio
03:59 - buttons 4 5 will be for the payment
04:01 - method we're either paying in store or
04:03 - we're ordering something online we do
04:06 - need to set the geometry for these two
04:08 - radio buttons I'll just copy these two
04:11 - lines add Radio 4 Radio 5 we'll set the
04:15 - y-coordinate of four to be 150 and 5 to
04:20 - be 200 all radio buttons will be within
04:23 - the same button group if I was to select
04:25 - in store we deselect one of these
04:28 - options what I would like is one option
04:31 - from this first group and another option
04:33 - from this other group these buttons are
04:35 - all in the same group I can only select
04:38 - one if I would like to pay with the VISA
04:41 - in store and I click the in store radio
04:44 - button we unelect the radio button for
04:47 - Visa I would like these radio buttons
04:49 - within different groups we need to
04:52 - create two different groups and add them
04:54 - accordingly here's
04:57 - how within our Constructor we will act
04:59 - access self declare a button group let's
05:03 - name it button group one for
05:05 - Simplicity equals call The Constructor
05:09 - of the class Q button group then pass in
05:13 - to set the parent widget to be the
05:15 - window then we will create button group
05:21 - two we're going to access self select
05:24 - the radio button
05:26 - group button group one
05:30 - call the add button method then pass in
05:34 - a radio
05:35 - button self. Radio
05:38 - 1 then we'll add Radio 2 and radio
05:44 - 3 we'll select button group two this
05:47 - time button group
05:49 - two add radio button 4 and radio button
05:56 - 5 the first three radio buttons are
05:58 - within the same group radio buttons four
06:00 - and five are within a different group we
06:03 - can only select one radio button from
06:05 - any one radio button
06:07 - group maybe I would like to pay with a
06:09 - Visa card in store or a master card
06:13 - online or a gift card in store these
06:17 - radio buttons are within different
06:18 - button groups we're limited to one
06:21 - selection in any one radio button group
06:24 - when we select these radio buttons they
06:26 - don't quite do anything for each radio
06:28 - button we have to connect a signal to a
06:30 - slot here's
06:32 - how let's define a method of
06:36 - radio button changed there will be no
06:41 - parameters beside
06:43 - self temporarily I'll write pass we'll
06:46 - fill this in in a
06:48 - moment we will take each radio button
06:51 - let's start with radio one Radio One the
06:55 - signal will be toggled when this radio
06:58 - button is toggled we will connect a slot
07:02 - we will pass in a function or a method
07:06 - self do radio button
07:09 - changed then we will do this with the
07:11 - other radio
07:13 - buttons 1 through
07:18 - 5 let's print a test
07:21 - message you selected
07:24 - something just to be sure that
07:26 - everything is working
07:29 - you selected
07:31 - something okay we know that that works
07:36 - currently what we're going to need to do
07:38 - is get the sender widget which radio
07:41 - button sent the signal of
07:44 - toggled I will create a local radio
07:47 - button to store that radio button
07:51 - whichever one emitted the signal we can
07:53 - determine that with self. sender method
07:57 - the sender method is going to return the
07:59 - widget that sent the signal so if we
08:02 - select radio button one our radio button
08:05 - will be radio button one if it was five
08:08 - then it's five in this
08:10 - case then we'll determine if our radio
08:13 - button is checked take our radio button
08:17 - use the is checked method this will
08:20 - return a Boolean true or false if it's
08:24 - checked if this returns true then let's
08:27 - print the following all an F string we
08:31 - will get the text of the radio button
08:34 - radio button called the text method to
08:37 - return the text of the radio
08:39 - button is
08:42 - selected all right then let's see if
08:45 - this
08:46 - works let's select Visa Visa is selected
08:50 - MasterCard is selected gift card is
08:53 - selected in store is selected and online
08:56 - is
08:57 - selected that's how to to determine
09:00 - which radio button was selected which
09:02 - one is the sender which one sent the
09:05 - signal all right everybody so that is an
09:08 - introduction to radio buttons in pi qt5

Radio 1 then we'll add Radio 2 and radio 3 we'll select button group two this time button group two add radio button 4 and radio button 5 the first three radio buttons are within the same group radio buttons four and five are within a different group we can only select one radio button from any one radio button group maybe I would like to pay with a Visa card in store or a master card online or a gift card in store these radio buttons are within different button groups we're limited to one selection in any one radio button group when we select these radio buttons they don't quite do anything for each radio button we have to connect a signal to a slot here's how let's define a method of radio button changed there will be no parameters beside self temporarily I'll write pass we'll fill this in in a moment we will take each radio button let's start with radio one Radio One the signal will be toggled when this radio button is toggled we will connect a slot we will pass in a function or a method self do radio button changed then we will do this with the other radio buttons 1 through 5 let's print a test message you selected something just to be sure that everything is working you selected something okay we know that that works currently what we're going to need to do is get the sender widget which radio button sent the signal of toggled I will create a local radio button to store that radio button whichever one emitted the signal we can determine that with self. sender method the sender method is going to return the widget that sent the signal so if we select radio button one our radio button will be radio button one if it was five then it's five in this case then we'll determine if our radio button is checked take our radio button use the is checked method this will return a Boolean true or false if it's checked if this returns true then let's print the following all an F string we will get the text of the radio button radio button called the text method to return the text of the radio button is selected all right then let's see if this works let's select Visa Visa is selected MasterCard is selected gift card is selected in store is selected and online is selected that's how to to determine which radio button was selected which one is the sender which one sent the signal all right everybody so that is an introduction to radio buttons in pi qt5
