00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's you
00:02 - bro hope you're doing well
00:03 - and i'm going to explain the purpose of
00:05 - if name equals main
00:06 - in python so sit back relax
00:09 - and enjoy the show
00:13 - during your programming journey you may
00:15 - have encountered this strange statement
00:17 - of
00:17 - if name equals main now what the heck
00:19 - does that mean
00:21 - so with python files also referred to as
00:24 - modules by including this statement it
00:26 - gives our modules some flexibility
00:29 - one a module that has the statement can
00:31 - be run as a standalone program
00:33 - or two this module can be imported
00:36 - and used by other modules if there's
00:39 - some sort of useful functions
00:40 - or other resources within this module to
00:43 - be imported
00:44 - by including the statement of if name
00:46 - equals main
00:47 - we're checking to see if a user is
00:49 - running this module
00:50 - as either a standalone program or
00:53 - they're importing it from another module
00:55 - behind the scenes the python interpreter
00:58 - will set special
00:59 - variables one of which is double
01:01 - underscore name
01:02 - it's a variable and python will assign
01:05 - the name
01:06 - variable a value of main if it's the
01:09 - initial
01:10 - module being run and we can actually
01:12 - test that by printing
01:14 - double underscore name so since
01:17 - this is the initial module being run
01:19 - module 1
01:20 - for my example name is going to be
01:23 - assigned a value
01:24 - a string of main now check this out
01:28 - i have two modules what if i were to
01:30 - import
01:31 - module 2 and check the name variable of
01:34 - module 2.
01:35 - let's try it import module
01:39 - two
01:42 - in order to access a variable from
01:45 - another module i need to type the name
01:46 - of the module
01:47 - module two dot and i would like to check
01:51 - the special name variable of module 2
01:54 - and print it
01:56 - so when you import a module this name
01:58 - variable is going to be assigned
02:00 - the name of the module in this case
02:02 - module 2.
02:03 - this time what if we change the roles
02:05 - around i'm going to copy
02:07 - all of this text and paste it within
02:09 - module 2.
02:10 - we're going to import from module 1
02:14 - we will print that special name variable
02:17 - of this module module 2 and then
02:20 - print the name variable of module 1
02:23 - which is being imported
02:25 - now when i run this program i'm going to
02:27 - instead run
02:28 - from module 2.
02:31 - now this time that special name variable
02:34 - of module 2
02:35 - is main and the special name variable of
02:38 - module 1
02:40 - is module 1 the name of the module
02:43 - so by including a statement such as
02:46 - if name equals main we're checking to
02:49 - see if this module
02:50 - is being run directly or indirectly
02:53 - so let's test it within this statement
02:56 - of if name
02:57 - equals main let's print running
03:01 - this module directly
03:05 - else that must mean that we're running
03:08 - this module indirectly
03:10 - so let's print running
03:14 - other module indirectly
03:19 - okay so i'm going to go to module 1
03:22 - and run from here running this module
03:25 - directly
03:27 - now let's do the same thing with module
03:29 - 2 but we need to
03:31 - import module
03:35 - one and let's run for module two
03:43 - running other module indirectly for the
03:46 - time being i'm just going to write pass
03:47 - within
03:48 - our if name equals main as a placeholder
03:50 - and get rid of our if statement
03:52 - so let's say within module 1 there's a
03:54 - useful function
03:55 - or resource we would like to access from
03:58 - module 2.
03:59 - so let's say we have a function named
04:01 - hello and all this will do is print
04:03 - the word hello let's just pretend that
04:07 - it's a useful function
04:08 - not really but let's pretend so in order
04:11 - to use
04:12 - this function from module 2 i need to
04:15 - import module 1
04:17 - then type module 1 dot and
04:20 - then the name of the function so i'm
04:22 - going to run
04:23 - from module 2 and this will print
04:27 - hello but what if i run this program
04:30 - from module one
04:31 - so right now module one cannot be run
04:34 - directly as a standalone program
04:37 - so i cannot print the word hello so what
04:39 - i could do
04:40 - is within if name equals main i can
04:44 - call that hello function directly
04:47 - so let's run from module 1.
04:50 - hello one other thing that you might see
04:53 - too within
04:54 - the if statement if name equals main
04:56 - there might be a call for a main
04:58 - function
04:59 - and you can write the main body of your
05:01 - program within a main function
05:03 - so everybody in conclusion the reason
05:06 - that people may include
05:07 - the statement if name equals main is
05:10 - that it allows our modules to have some
05:12 - flexibility
05:13 - they can be run as a standalone program
05:16 - or
05:16 - they can be imported and used by other
05:18 - modules and
05:19 - this is because the python interpreter
05:21 - sets that special variable of name
05:24 - with a value of main if it's the initial
05:28 - module being run if you would like a
05:30 - copy of my code and
05:31 - my notes i will post all of this to the
05:33 - comment section down below
05:35 - but yeah that's the purpose of if name
05:37 - equals main
05:38 - in python

hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and i'm going to explain the purpose of if name equals main in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show during your programming journey you may have encountered this strange statement of if name equals main now what the heck does that mean so with python files also referred to as modules by including this statement it gives our modules some flexibility one a module that has the statement can be run as a standalone program or two this module can be imported and used by other modules if there's some sort of useful functions or other resources within this module to be imported by including the statement of if name equals main we're checking to see if a user is running this module as either a standalone program or they're importing it from another module behind the scenes the python interpreter will set special variables one of which is double underscore name it's a variable and python will assign the name variable a value of main if it's the initial module being run and we can actually test that by printing double underscore name so since this is the initial module being run module 1 for my example name is going to be assigned a value a string of main now check this out i have two modules what if i were to import module 2 and check the name variable of module 2. let's try it import module two in order to access a variable from another module i need to type the name of the module module two dot and i would like to check the special name variable of module 2 and print it so when you import a module this name variable is going to be assigned the name of the module in this case module 2. this time what if we change the roles around i'm going to copy all of this text and paste it within module 2. we're going to import from module 1 we will print that special name variable of this module module 2 and then print the name variable of module 1 which is being imported now when i run this program i'm going to instead run from module 2. now this time that special name variable of module 2 is main and the special name variable of module 1 is module 1 the name of the module so by including a statement such as if name equals main we're checking to see if this module is being run directly or indirectly so let's test it within this statement of if name equals main let's print running this module directly else that must mean that we're running this module indirectly so let's print running other module indirectly okay so i'm going to go to module 1 and run from here running this module directly now let's do the same thing with module 2 but we need to import module one and let's run for module two running other module indirectly for the time being i'm just going to write pass within our if name equals main as a placeholder and get rid of our if statement so let's say within module 1 there's a useful function or resource we would like to access from module 2. so let's say we have a function named hello and all this will do is print the word hello let's just pretend that it's a useful function not really but let's pretend so in order to use this function from module 2 i need to import module 1 then type module 1 dot and then the name of the function so i'm going to run from module 2 and this will print hello but what if i run this program from module one so right now module one cannot be run directly as a standalone program so i cannot print the word hello so what i could do is within if name equals main i can call that hello function directly so let's run from module 1. hello one other thing that you might see too within the if statement if name equals main there might be a call for a main function and you can write the main body of your program within a main function so everybody in conclusion the reason that people may include the statement if name equals main is that it allows our modules to have some flexibility they can be run as a standalone program or they can be imported and used by other modules and this is because the python interpreter sets that special variable of name with a value of main if it's the initial module being run if you would like a copy of my code and my notes i will post all of this to the comment section down below but yeah that's the purpose of if name equals main in python
