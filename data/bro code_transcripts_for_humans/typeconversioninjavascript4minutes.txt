00:01 - hey guys in this video i'm going to
00:03 - explain type conversion type conversion
00:05 - is the ability to change the data type
00:08 - of a value to another and i'll explain
00:10 - how to do this with strings numbers and
00:12 - booleans here's one issue when accepting
00:14 - some user input let's say we have
00:16 - variable age and i'll create a window
00:18 - prompt to ask a user to enter in their
00:21 - age how old are you once we accept some
00:24 - user input i'm going to increment age by
00:27 - one because let's say it's the user's
00:29 - birthday then let's display the user's
00:31 - age
00:32 - console.log
00:34 - happy birthday
00:38 - u
00:38 - r
00:40 - our age variable
00:43 - years old how old are you let's say that
00:46 - i'm 21 i press ok happy birthday you are
00:50 - 211 years old when we accept user input
00:53 - it's of a string data type we can't
00:56 - normally use strings for any sort of
00:57 - arithmetic expressions what i intended
01:00 - was to add our age 21 plus 1. that would
01:03 - give me 22. if you add a number to a
01:06 - string you just concatenate that number
01:08 - to the end of the string because a
01:09 - string is just a series of characters if
01:12 - i need to take some user input and use
01:14 - it with some sort of arithmetic
01:15 - expression i want to convert that string
01:18 - to a number and one way i can do that is
01:20 - to use the number constructor so i'm
01:22 - going to set age equal to then type
01:26 - number
01:27 - make sure it's capital
01:28 - parentheses and then pass in age this
01:32 - will convert a string to a number how
01:34 - old are you 21. press ok happy birthday
01:37 - you are now 22 years old if you ever
01:39 - need to get the data type of a variable
01:42 - there is a type of keyword
01:44 - let's display it type
01:46 - of
01:47 - age
01:48 - so before we convert our age variable
01:50 - it's a string then let's display the
01:52 - data type of age after we convert it
01:55 - at first it's a string we convert it and
01:58 - now it's a number and then we can use it
01:59 - in arithmetic expressions here's a few
02:02 - other examples we have three variables x
02:04 - y and z
02:07 - i'm going to set x to equal
02:09 - and we will use the number constructor
02:11 - and we will convert the string 3.14
02:15 - into a number
02:17 - and then i will display whatever x is
02:20 - as well as the data type
02:23 - type of x remember we're converting a
02:26 - string into a number
02:29 - so 3.14 is now a number let's convert a
02:32 - number into a string y equals and we can
02:36 - use the string constructor
02:38 - and we will convert the number 3.14 into
02:41 - a string
02:43 - console.log
02:46 - y
02:46 - and type of y
02:48 - 3.14 is now a string
02:51 - and to convert something to a boolean
02:53 - you can use the boolean constructor
02:56 - so if you pass in an empty string just a
02:58 - set of quotes this will give you false
03:02 - console.log variable z and the type of z
03:07 - so converting an empty string to a
03:09 - boolean will result in false and this is
03:12 - of the boolean data type but if you type
03:14 - in anything else it will give you true
03:17 - so maybe i try and convert the word
03:19 - pizza when you convert a string to a
03:21 - boolean that's not empty this will give
03:23 - you true if it's an empty string just a
03:26 - set of quotes it results in false this
03:28 - would be useful if you need to accept
03:30 - some user input or user types in their
03:32 - name if they skip that step and using an
03:34 - if statement which we'll talk about
03:36 - later you can check to see if a user
03:38 - typed in something or not based on if
03:40 - that boolean is true or false but we'll
03:42 - get into that later so yeah those are a
03:44 - few basic ways of type conversion you
03:47 - can change the data type of one value to
03:49 - another if you need to get the data type
03:51 - of a variable just precede that variable
03:53 - with the type of keyword and to convert
03:56 - a value or variable into another data
03:58 - type you can surround that value or
04:01 - variable with a given constructor the
04:03 - number constructor the string
04:05 - constructor or the boolean constructor
04:07 - oh one fun fact too if you try and
04:09 - convert something into a number that
04:11 - normally shouldn't be a number like the
04:13 - word pizza well then this will result in
04:16 - n-a-n not a number that's just a fun
04:19 - fact so yeah that is type conversion in
04:22 - javascript if this video helped you out
