00:00 - hey everyone we're going to cover some
00:01 - basic arithmetic
00:03 - in c sharp so sit back relax and enjoy
00:06 - the show
00:08 - everyone i thought we could just cover
00:10 - some basic arithmetic real quick
00:12 - let's say we have a variable friends and
00:14 - i will assign this a value of what about
00:16 - five
00:16 - and within a writeline statement i will
00:18 - display the value stored within friends
00:21 - so of course friends will have a value
00:24 - of five
00:24 - but what if i need to update this like
00:26 - increment it i could say
00:28 - friends equals friends and we make a
00:31 - friend so we could say friends equals
00:33 - friends plus one
00:34 - because remember the value stored within
00:36 - friends is five
00:37 - this is no different from saying friends
00:39 - equals five plus one which would be six
00:41 - so let me display the value stored
00:43 - within friends and of course
00:45 - that's six of course you can change this
00:47 - to a different number too you could say
00:49 - friends equals friends plus two then the
00:51 - amount of friends that we have
00:52 - is seven so there is a shortcut of
00:56 - writing this too because this can be
00:57 - somewhat
00:58 - tedious what you could say is friends
01:00 - plus
01:01 - equals then the amount that you want to
01:03 - increment this variable by
01:05 - so if i need to increment friends by two
01:07 - i could say friends
01:08 - plus equals two and that would do the
01:10 - same thing that's like a shortcut
01:13 - so of course that would be seven so
01:15 - there's a third way to increment and
01:17 - decrement two
01:18 - this method is found within loops you
01:20 - could say friends
01:21 - plus plus however this will only
01:23 - increment a
01:24 - variable by one so if friends is
01:27 - initially five
01:27 - then we say plus plus well then friends
01:30 - will equal six
01:31 - so there's three different ways to
01:33 - increment a variable
01:34 - this way is found within loops this is
01:36 - the standard way and that's kind of the
01:38 - shortcut this line right here okay so
01:40 - let's decrement friends
01:42 - so we could say friends equals friends
01:45 - minus one or we could say friends
01:48 - minus equals one or friends
01:52 - minus minus so if we combine all these
01:55 - the amount of friends that we have
01:56 - is two let's work on some multiplication
02:00 - if we need to double the amount of
02:01 - friends that we have we would say
02:03 - friends equals friends times
02:06 - we use an asterisk for multiplication
02:08 - and programming
02:09 - times two then the amount of friends
02:11 - that we have
02:14 - is ten and the shortcut would be
02:18 - friends asterisk equals two
02:22 - and that would do the same thing now
02:25 - division
02:25 - let's say that steve breaks up our group
02:28 - of friends
02:29 - so we could say friends equals friends
02:31 - divided by two and for division we use a
02:33 - forward slash
02:34 - now pay attention to this our current
02:37 - number of friends is five but what if we
02:38 - divide this by two
02:40 - well you would think that we get two
02:42 - point five right well you're wrong we
02:44 - end up with two
02:45 - that's because friends is an integer we
02:47 - can only store whole numbers
02:49 - we can't store that decimal portion that
02:51 - 0.5
02:52 - so if this was a double well then that
02:54 - would be 2.5
02:56 - so that's referred to as integer
02:58 - division and that's something you have
02:59 - to look out for
03:01 - so if friends equals friends divided by
03:03 - two
03:04 - well then the shortcut would be friends
03:06 - forward slash
03:07 - equals two and that would do the same
03:09 - thing and then remember i'm storing this
03:11 - within an integer so we will truncate
03:13 - that decimal portion and we end up with
03:15 - two
03:16 - and our last operator for this topic is
03:19 - the modulus
03:20 - also known as the remainder operator now
03:23 - for this example i'm going to change the
03:25 - amount of friends that we have to 10
03:27 - so we can find the remainder of any
03:29 - division but i'm going to store this
03:30 - within a new variable
03:32 - int remainder and to find the remainder
03:36 - we could say friends
03:38 - then modulus which is represented by a
03:40 - percent sign
03:41 - than 3. so 10 divided by 3 will have a
03:45 - remainder and we will store that
03:46 - remainder within
03:47 - a new variable so let's pretend that we
03:50 - have a total of 10 people and we have to
03:52 - break up into
03:53 - groups of three so there's going to be
03:55 - one person remaining
03:56 - and i will just display that remainder
03:58 - of 1 but if this was in groups of 2
04:01 - so friends modulus 2 well 10 divides by
04:04 - 2 evenly
04:06 - so there will be no remainder and the
04:08 - value will be 0.
04:10 - so if you need to find the remainder you
04:12 - can always use this modulus the
04:14 - remainder operator and it's also pretty
04:16 - good for finding if numbers are even or
04:18 - odd too
04:19 - so that's always a plus as well all
04:20 - right everybody so that is some basic
04:23 - arithmetic i will post this code to the
04:24 - comment section down below
04:26 - and well that's some basic arithmetic in
04:28 - c sharp

hey everyone we're going to cover some basic arithmetic in c sharp so sit back relax and enjoy the show everyone i thought we could just cover some basic arithmetic real quick let's say we have a variable friends and i will assign this a value of what about five and within a writeline statement i will display the value stored within friends so of course friends will have a value of five but what if i need to update this like increment it i could say friends equals friends and we make a friend so we could say friends equals friends plus one because remember the value stored within friends is five this is no different from saying friends equals five plus one which would be six so let me display the value stored within friends and of course that's six of course you can change this to a different number too you could say friends equals friends plus two then the amount of friends that we have is seven so there is a shortcut of writing this too because this can be somewhat tedious what you could say is friends plus equals then the amount that you want to increment this variable by so if i need to increment friends by two i could say friends plus equals two and that would do the same thing that's like a shortcut so of course that would be seven so there's a third way to increment and decrement two this method is found within loops you could say friends plus plus however this will only increment a variable by one so if friends is initially five then we say plus plus well then friends will equal six so there's three different ways to increment a variable this way is found within loops this is the standard way and that's kind of the shortcut this line right here okay so let's decrement friends so we could say friends equals friends minus one or we could say friends minus equals one or friends minus minus so if we combine all these the amount of friends that we have is two let's work on some multiplication if we need to double the amount of friends that we have we would say friends equals friends times we use an asterisk for multiplication and programming times two then the amount of friends that we have is ten and the shortcut would be friends asterisk equals two and that would do the same thing now division let's say that steve breaks up our group of friends so we could say friends equals friends divided by two and for division we use a forward slash now pay attention to this our current number of friends is five but what if we divide this by two well you would think that we get two point five right well you're wrong we end up with two that's because friends is an integer we can only store whole numbers we can't store that decimal portion that 0.5 so if this was a double well then that would be 2.5 so that's referred to as integer division and that's something you have to look out for so if friends equals friends divided by two well then the shortcut would be friends forward slash equals two and that would do the same thing and then remember i'm storing this within an integer so we will truncate that decimal portion and we end up with two and our last operator for this topic is the modulus also known as the remainder operator now for this example i'm going to change the amount of friends that we have to 10 so we can find the remainder of any division but i'm going to store this within a new variable int remainder and to find the remainder we could say friends then modulus which is represented by a percent sign than 3. so 10 divided by 3 will have a remainder and we will store that remainder within a new variable so let's pretend that we have a total of 10 people and we have to break up into groups of three so there's going to be one person remaining and i will just display that remainder of 1 but if this was in groups of 2 so friends modulus 2 well 10 divides by 2 evenly so there will be no remainder and the value will be 0. so if you need to find the remainder you can always use this modulus the remainder operator and it's also pretty good for finding if numbers are even or odd too so that's always a plus as well all right everybody so that is some basic arithmetic i will post this code to the comment section down below and well that's some basic arithmetic in c sharp
