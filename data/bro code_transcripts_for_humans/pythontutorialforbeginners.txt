00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's bro
00:02 - hope you're doing well and in this video
00:04 - i'm going to help you get started with
00:05 - python so sit back relax and enjoy the
00:09 - show
00:11 - if you wouldn't mind please like comment
00:13 - and subscribe one like equals one prayer
00:16 - for the youtube algorithm
00:18 - i'm gonna tell you why you need to learn
00:20 - python it's the easiest programming
00:22 - language to learn as well as being the
00:24 - most popular in the world right now and
00:26 - according to glassdoor the salary for
00:29 - new python developers in the united
00:31 - states is 64 000
00:34 - if any of this sounds good to you well
00:35 - then let's get started if you need to
00:37 - download python go to python.org
00:41 - downloads and click this yellow download
00:43 - python button
00:44 - open when done
00:46 - check add python 3.9 or another version
00:50 - to path
00:51 - install now
00:52 - and then give it a little bit it stays
00:54 - here that setup was successful so let's
00:57 - close out of this our next step is to
00:59 - download an ide that's an acronym for
01:02 - integrated development environment think
01:04 - of it as software that helps us write
01:06 - other software one ide that i recommend
01:09 - is pycharm you can find it at
01:11 - jetbrains.com
01:13 - pycharm go to download
01:16 - if you would like to pay for a
01:18 - professional version you can click this
01:20 - download button but since i don't like
01:22 - to pay for things i'm going to use the
01:24 - free community version at this point we
01:26 - just have to follow the standard
01:28 - installation procedure click next you
01:30 - can pick a destination folder but i'll
01:33 - keep the default
01:34 - next
01:35 - if you would like a desktop shortcut
01:38 - then check this
01:39 - i would also recommend updating the path
01:41 - variable
01:43 - next
01:44 - install
01:46 - and then give it a minute or two
01:48 - then after finishing i have a desktop
01:50 - shortcut so i can just click on this to
01:52 - run pycharm
01:53 - let's create a new project
01:56 - name this project whatever you like i'm
01:58 - going to name this project hello
02:00 - world and i recommend not creating a
02:03 - main dot pi welcome script right now
02:05 - i'll show you how to do that manually
02:07 - and let's create
02:09 - if you need a python file to work with
02:12 - this is how to create one go to file new
02:15 - python file and i'm going to name this
02:18 - main and then click python file
02:23 - all right ladies and gentlemen we now
02:25 - have an empty python script that we can
02:27 - use to begin coding now if you checked
02:29 - this box create a main.pi welcome script
02:32 - and then created a new project then your
02:35 - main python file will probably look a
02:37 - little something like this but that's
02:39 - completely fine we can just delete this
02:41 - i don't know about you guys but the font
02:43 - is very small for me so let's change
02:46 - that we can change that by going to file
02:49 - settings
02:50 - editor
02:51 - font and you can increase the font size
02:54 - let's say 25 you can also change the
02:56 - font too
02:57 - what's a good one
02:59 - uh how about that
03:02 - then click apply and okay
03:05 - much better we can actually see
03:06 - something to run a python script just
03:09 - click the screen play button in the
03:10 - corner alternatively you can go to the
03:13 - run tab and then go to run
03:15 - okay so this box that appeared at the
03:17 - bottom this is referred to as a terminal
03:20 - window this will display any output that
03:22 - your program has and this line at the
03:24 - end process finished with exit code zero
03:27 - that just means that there were no
03:29 - errors in this program so currently this
03:31 - program doesn't do anything but let's
03:33 - change that let's print something let's
03:35 - print a message so to print a message to
03:38 - the terminal window type print and then
03:41 - add a set of parentheses and then you
03:43 - can type a message but it has to be
03:45 - within quotes either double quotes or
03:47 - single quotes it doesn't matter so
03:50 - let's think of a message i don't know i
03:53 - love
03:54 - pizza
03:55 - then let me run this
03:57 - and in my terminal window it says i love
04:00 - pizza to print another line just add
04:03 - another print statement print and then
04:05 - your message within quotes
04:08 - it's
04:09 - really
04:10 - good
04:13 - and well what do you know it printed i
04:16 - love pizza it's really good so ladies
04:18 - and gentlemen you just wrote your first
04:20 - python program by the way you can change
04:23 - the font as well as the font color of
04:25 - your terminal window by going to file
04:28 - settings
04:29 - then go to editor color scheme console
04:32 - font and console colors let's change the
04:35 - font
04:37 - let's say i would like
04:39 - whatever this font is
04:41 - then click apply
04:43 - let's change the font color too by going
04:45 - to console colors for any output you can
04:48 - click number two
04:51 - and select a color
04:53 - let's say i would like bright green
04:57 - that should be decent
04:59 - and for anything else let's say this
05:02 - will be a dark color so i can barely see
05:04 - it
05:05 - so then let's click apply and okay
05:08 - oh yeah that's much better well
05:10 - everybody that was your very first
05:12 - python program i'll post any useful
05:14 - links and time stamps for this video in
05:16 - the comments section down below but yeah
05:19 - welcome to coding with python
