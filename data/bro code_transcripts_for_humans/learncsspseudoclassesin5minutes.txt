00:02 - hey
00:03 - pseudo classes a pseudo class is a
00:05 - keyword added to a selector that
00:07 - specifies a special state of the
00:10 - selected elements what the heck does
00:11 - that mean so with elements elements can
00:14 - be in a special state like if you hover
00:16 - over them you click on them things of
00:19 - that nature so let's create a hyperlink
00:21 - for this first example let's create a
00:22 - hyperlink that will take us to google
00:25 - because i can't think of anything else
00:26 - at the moment
00:27 - so let's set the href attribute equal to
00:30 - the url for google
00:35 - by default this hyperlink is blue but we
00:37 - can actually change that type the
00:39 - element you would like to change the css
00:41 - properties of
00:42 - followed by a colon and then we have
00:44 - access to all of these pseudo classes so
00:47 - a pseudo class is a special state so
00:49 - anything that is a link let's change
00:52 - maybe the color
00:54 - color what about
00:56 - lawn green i guess anything that is
00:58 - using an a element that is a link is now
01:01 - lawn green so if i click on this link it
01:04 - takes me to google anything that's
01:06 - visited is also another state a pseudo
01:08 - class and the default color is purple
01:11 - let's change that to a colon the pseudo
01:14 - class is visited
01:16 - maybe gray for the color
01:19 - like it's been disabled so the color is
01:22 - now gray since we've already visited
01:23 - this link what if we hover our cursor
01:26 - over this link that is another state a
01:29 - hover
01:31 - color
01:32 - what about
01:34 - tomato i like tomatoes
01:36 - so by hovering my cursor over this link
01:40 - the state of this element is now hover
01:42 - and these css properties will apply when
01:45 - this element is within this state and
01:48 - there's another useful one for
01:49 - hyperlinks and that is active
01:52 - if we were to hold down our mouse over
01:54 - this element then let's change the color
01:57 - to what about
02:00 - i don't know yellow so with active if i
02:02 - hold down the mouse then this link is
02:05 - active it's within the active state now
02:08 - let's create a button this time
02:11 - button
02:12 - click me
02:15 - so anything that's a button we'll use
02:18 - the pseudo class of hover this time
02:20 - and let's change the color to
02:24 - light
02:25 - gray
02:26 - so by hovering my mouse over this button
02:30 - it's going to change the color let's
02:31 - make that background color actually
02:34 - background color
02:37 - if you have a navigation bar or menu bar
02:40 - setup it's actually fairly useful to
02:41 - have the background color change based
02:44 - on what the user is hovering over to let
02:46 - them know that they can select something
02:48 - let's change the active pseudo class for
02:50 - buttons as well
02:51 - uh let's say if we click on this then it
02:53 - will be white
02:57 - cool all right here's another we'll need
02:58 - a list it doesn't matter what kind of
03:00 - list i'll just make an unordered list
03:02 - and let's add 10 list item elements
03:14 - this next pseudo class is really useful
03:16 - it is the m child pseudo class
03:19 - so with these list items i would like to
03:21 - change the background of selected
03:23 - elements think of a child as an element
03:26 - within an element so these list items
03:29 - are all siblings and what we're going to
03:30 - do is change the background color of a
03:33 - few selected elements we will select our
03:36 - list item and say that the nth child
03:40 - will be
03:41 - will have a background
03:43 - color of yellow as if we're selecting
03:46 - something so place a value as an
03:48 - argument within these parentheses these
03:51 - list items are all siblings so let's say
03:53 - that the first child will have a
03:55 - background color of yellow so i will
03:57 - pass in a one
03:59 - or two
04:00 - three
04:01 - four
04:02 - five you get the idea this is really
04:05 - useful with javascript because you can
04:07 - place a variable within here and then
04:09 - increment or decrement to the variable
04:11 - so you can select a given item from a
04:13 - list i'm just going to turn this into a
04:15 - comment real quick
04:19 - now with this next one let's say that
04:21 - the color will be sky blue
04:24 - and i would like to apply this css
04:26 - property to all
04:29 - even siblings
04:30 - and let's do the same thing with all odd
04:32 - siblings
04:35 - and let's make the color what about
04:37 - powder blue so in this way we can
04:40 - alternate the highlighting of our
04:41 - elements so that they may be easier to
04:44 - read this next value is going to be
04:46 - somewhat strange it's a formula that we
04:48 - can pass in as an argument so what if i
04:50 - need every third element highlighted i
04:54 - would say three n n is the current
04:57 - number that we're on
04:58 - so elements three six and nine are
05:01 - highlighted
05:03 - if we change this to four n every fourth
05:06 - element is highlighted
05:08 - five n is every fifth element
05:10 - you can place an offset too if i need
05:12 - this to start at one
05:14 - i would add plus one
05:15 - or plus two
05:17 - plus three
05:18 - plus four so yeah you can pass in a
05:21 - formula as an argument to the nth child
05:24 - pseudo class and this is useful if you
05:26 - need some sort of pattern so yeah those
05:29 - are pseudo classes
05:30 - it's a keyword added to a selector that
05:33 - specifies a special state of the
05:36 - selected element so yeah those are
05:38 - pseudo classes if this video helped you
