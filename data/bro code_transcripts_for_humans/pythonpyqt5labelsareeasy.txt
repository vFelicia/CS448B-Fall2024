00:00 - what's up everybody in today's topic
00:02 - we're going to create some labels using
00:04 - pi qt5 we will import the widget of Q
00:09 - label this label class is used to create
00:12 - label widgets that can display text or
00:15 - images within the Constructor of our
00:17 - main window this is where we'll create a
00:20 - label we will declare a label object
00:23 - label equals call The Constructor for Q
00:28 - label for the text of the label we'll
00:31 - pass in a string that's the first
00:33 - argument let's say the word
00:36 - hello for the second argument we will
00:38 - pass in self self refers to this window
00:42 - object that we're calling and
00:44 - instantiating all right let's do a test
00:48 - run here is my label although you can
00:51 - barely see it the font is really small
00:53 - but it does say
00:55 - hello let's set the font we'll need
00:58 - another import
01:00 - from PI
01:03 - qt5 do QT
01:08 - GUI import Q
01:12 - font by importing the Q font class we
01:16 - can begin working with
01:17 - fonts we're going to take our label call
01:20 - the set font
01:23 - method within this method we will call
01:26 - the Constructor of Q
01:28 - font pick a font that would like I will
01:32 - pick aial but feel free to choose really
01:34 - any font then the second argument is a
01:37 - font size I'll pick
01:40 - 30 let's do another test
01:43 - run that's much better let's increase
01:47 - this to 40 for the font
01:49 - size now I'm going to set the geometry
01:52 - of this label such as the positioning
01:55 - and the width and the
01:58 - height let's let's take our
02:01 - label use the set geometry method we
02:06 - will pass in X and Y coordinates 0 0
02:09 - corresponds to the top left corner for
02:12 - the width let's set the width to be 500
02:14 - and the height to be
02:17 - 100 that's better I'll cover more
02:20 - advanced alignments
02:22 - momentarily let's add a Styles
02:24 - sheet pqt does have styles that are very
02:27 - similar to CSS if you would like to
02:30 - learn more about CSS I do have a full
02:31 - course on that topic we will add some
02:34 - CSS like Properties by accessing our
02:37 - label object call the method of set
02:41 - style
02:44 - sheet within this method we will pass in
02:47 - some CSS like properties such as a
02:51 - color for the color let's say blue these
02:55 - CSS like properties should end with a
02:58 - semicolon and now the font color is blue
03:02 - you could also use RGB values or heximal
03:05 - values you could always look up a Color
03:08 - Picker and pick a very specific
03:11 - color let's pick something
03:14 - green we can either use RGB values or
03:18 - heximal values so I will copy this
03:23 - value so I will paste that heximal value
03:27 - and now we have a very specific shade of
03:30 - green but I think I'll go with something
03:34 - dark such as
03:38 - that so this color is going to be a dark
03:42 - gray
03:43 - color we could set a background color
03:45 - this will be a new
03:50 - string background dasc
03:54 - color and I will pick a new
03:56 - color I will pick something blue
04:04 - that's a decent
04:09 - color we have a blue background with
04:12 - dark gray
04:13 - text we can set the font to be bold font
04:17 - weight will be
04:21 - bold so the font is now
04:24 - bold the font style can be italic font
04:29 - style
04:32 - italic so our font is italic and we can
04:37 - underline text
04:40 - decoration
04:44 - underline the text on our label is now
04:47 - underlined let's work on positioning
04:50 - next currently my text is left Justified
04:53 - and set to the center
04:55 - vertically to work with alignments we
04:57 - need this import from
05:00 - Pi
05:02 - qt5 QT
05:06 - core import
05:09 - QT the class of QT is used for
05:14 - alignments to Center the text of our
05:16 - label at the top vertically we will take
05:19 - our label use the set alignment
05:23 - method then pass in a flag access the
05:26 - class of qot access the flag
05:30 - of align
05:32 - top this will align our text vertically
05:36 - to the
05:39 - top so then our text is aligned
05:42 - vertically to the top rather than the
05:45 - center for the
05:49 - bottom we will use the flag of Al line
05:55 - bottom we will align vertically on the
05:58 - bottom
06:00 - the text is now on the
06:02 - bottom to align vertically in the
06:05 - center align V
06:11 - Center this will be vertically
06:14 - Center which it was
06:17 - originally now for horizontal alignment
06:19 - we can add the
06:21 - following okay to align right we will
06:24 - pass in a flag of align
06:28 - right or is
06:31 - onally align
06:35 - right the text is now all the way to the
06:40 - right for the
06:42 - center align H H for
06:46 - horizontal
06:50 - Center the text is now horizontally
06:53 - aligned in the
06:56 - center for the left
07:03 - Al line
07:08 - left the text will be aligned to the
07:11 - left we could combine both horizontal
07:14 - and vertical
07:17 - positioning here's how take our label
07:21 - call the set alignment
07:24 - method we will align horizontally in the
07:27 - center follow this with the or or
07:29 - bitwise operator which is a vertical bar
07:32 - this allows us to combine Flags we will
07:35 - align horizontally in the center then
07:38 - vertically let's align to the
07:41 - top so our text should be aligned
07:44 - horizontally we're aligned in the center
07:47 - and vertically we're aligned to the
07:50 - top align bottom
07:55 - vertically horizontally we are in the
07:57 - center vertically we're on the bottom
08:01 - then for the very center of our
08:09 - label Al line horizontal
08:13 - Center and Al line vertical
08:21 - Center our text will now be in the very
08:24 - middle of our label both horizontally
08:27 - and
08:27 - vertically now there is a shortcut for
08:30 - the very center we don't need both of
08:32 - these
08:34 - flags the shortcut is the
08:36 - following set
08:39 - alignment align
08:42 - Center that will align the text both
08:44 - horizontally and
08:46 - vertically so that is Center and Center
08:50 - all right everybody so that is an
08:51 - introduction to labels in pi qt5

Cleaned transcript:

what's up everybody in today's topic we're going to create some labels using pi qt5 we will import the widget of Q label this label class is used to create label widgets that can display text or images within the Constructor of our main window this is where we'll create a label we will declare a label object label equals call The Constructor for Q label for the text of the label we'll pass in a string that's the first argument let's say the word hello for the second argument we will pass in self self refers to this window object that we're calling and instantiating all right let's do a test run here is my label although you can barely see it the font is really small but it does say hello let's set the font we'll need another import from PI qt5 do QT GUI import Q font by importing the Q font class we can begin working with fonts we're going to take our label call the set font method within this method we will call the Constructor of Q font pick a font that would like I will pick aial but feel free to choose really any font then the second argument is a font size I'll pick 30 let's do another test run that's much better let's increase this to 40 for the font size now I'm going to set the geometry of this label such as the positioning and the width and the height let's let's take our label use the set geometry method we will pass in X and Y coordinates 0 0 corresponds to the top left corner for the width let's set the width to be 500 and the height to be 100 that's better I'll cover more advanced alignments momentarily let's add a Styles sheet pqt does have styles that are very similar to CSS if you would like to learn more about CSS I do have a full course on that topic we will add some CSS like Properties by accessing our label object call the method of set style sheet within this method we will pass in some CSS like properties such as a color for the color let's say blue these CSS like properties should end with a semicolon and now the font color is blue you could also use RGB values or heximal values you could always look up a Color Picker and pick a very specific color let's pick something green we can either use RGB values or heximal values so I will copy this value so I will paste that heximal value and now we have a very specific shade of green but I think I'll go with something dark such as that so this color is going to be a dark gray color we could set a background color this will be a new string background dasc color and I will pick a new color I will pick something blue that's a decent color we have a blue background with dark gray text we can set the font to be bold font weight will be bold so the font is now bold the font style can be italic font style italic so our font is italic and we can underline text decoration underline the text on our label is now underlined let's work on positioning next currently my text is left Justified and set to the center vertically to work with alignments we need this import from Pi qt5 QT core import QT the class of QT is used for alignments to Center the text of our label at the top vertically we will take our label use the set alignment method then pass in a flag access the class of qot access the flag of align top this will align our text vertically to the top so then our text is aligned vertically to the top rather than the center for the bottom we will use the flag of Al line bottom we will align vertically on the bottom the text is now on the bottom to align vertically in the center align V Center this will be vertically Center which it was originally now for horizontal alignment we can add the following okay to align right we will pass in a flag of align right or is onally align right the text is now all the way to the right for the center align H H for horizontal Center the text is now horizontally aligned in the center for the left Al line left the text will be aligned to the left we could combine both horizontal and vertical positioning here's how take our label call the set alignment method we will align horizontally in the center follow this with the or or bitwise operator which is a vertical bar this allows us to combine Flags we will align horizontally in the center then vertically let's align to the top so our text should be aligned horizontally we're aligned in the center and vertically we're aligned to the top align bottom vertically horizontally we are in the center vertically we're on the bottom then for the very center of our label Al line horizontal Center and Al line vertical Center our text will now be in the very middle of our label both horizontally and vertically now there is a shortcut for the very center we don't need both of these flags the shortcut is the following set alignment align Center that will align the text both horizontally and vertically so that is Center and Center all right everybody so that is an introduction to labels in pi qt5
