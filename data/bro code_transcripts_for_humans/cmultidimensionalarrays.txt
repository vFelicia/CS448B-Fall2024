00:02 - all right what's going on
00:03 - multi-dimensional arrays
00:04 - so just a fair warning this is a
00:06 - difficult topic if you want you can skip
00:08 - this video you won't hurt my feelings
00:10 - but if you'd like to know what a
00:11 - multi-dimensional array is well here we
00:13 - go
00:14 - so a multi-dimensional array is an array
00:16 - of arrays
00:17 - so i have three standard arrays i have
00:19 - different car manufacturers
00:21 - ford chevy and toyota so each array has
00:25 - three different kinds of cars a
00:26 - multi-dimensional array is good if you
00:28 - need like
00:29 - some sort of grid or matrix of data so
00:31 - what i would like to do is to create an
00:33 - array of arrays to simulate maybe like a
00:35 - parking lot to park all of these cars
00:38 - so to create a multi-dimensional array
00:40 - this will be a two-dimensional array
00:42 - we need to list the data type of what
00:43 - we're storing strings
00:45 - then a set of straight brackets and
00:48 - then within the straight brackets add a
00:51 - comma
00:52 - so now i'm going to name this array
00:54 - let's say
00:55 - parking lot
00:59 - equals and then we add our curly braces
01:01 - much like what we do with standard
01:03 - arrays
01:03 - however i'm going to add each array
01:05 - within the set of curly braces
01:08 - and then separate each with a comma
01:15 - so this can be somewhat difficult to
01:16 - read i like to kind of condense it all
01:20 - and just make it look nice
01:24 - so you can see that this resembles sort
01:26 - of like a grid with rows and columns
01:28 - and that visual is going to help us so
01:31 - to access one of these elements
01:33 - we need to list an index for the row and
01:35 - an index for the column
01:37 - so let's say i would like to change this
01:39 - explorer to something else
01:41 - so in order to access this element i'm
01:44 - going to type the name of our
01:45 - multi-dimensional array
01:47 - straight brackets and then i need a row
01:49 - and column
01:50 - so these always start with zero this
01:52 - would be row zero
01:54 - row one row two i need to access
01:57 - row one so that would be zero then comma
02:00 - for column and then i need to count the
02:03 - row number
02:03 - zero one two so that would be
02:06 - zero comma two for this element within
02:09 - my
02:10 - two-dimensional array so i'm going to
02:12 - change this to something else
02:14 - so let's say that this is a ford fusion
02:17 - and then let's display these elements we
02:19 - can use a for each loop
02:22 - for each the data type is string
02:25 - let's say car in parking lot
02:30 - and then i will just iterate through
02:31 - this console.writeline
02:33 - card so this will iterate nine times
02:37 - one for each element within our
02:39 - two-dimensional array
02:42 - so we have a mustang f-150 then fusion
02:45 - so we updated
02:46 - explorer to fusion so let's update maybe
02:49 - this corolla to something else
02:50 - so let's count the row number that would
02:53 - be zero
02:54 - one two parking lot
02:58 - two and the column number is zero
03:03 - and let's say that this is a tacoma
03:06 - and try this again okay we have
03:10 - instead of a corolla a tacoma
03:13 - now if you would like to display this as
03:15 - like a grid we can use
03:17 - nested for loops for that so let's get
03:19 - rid of this for each loop
03:21 - i'll just turn this all into one giant
03:23 - comment
03:24 - okay so to display this as like a grid
03:27 - we'll use
03:28 - nested for loops the outer loop will be
03:30 - four
03:32 - and i equals zero we will continue this
03:35 - as long as i
03:37 - is less than parking lot
03:40 - dot get length method and then pass
03:43 - in the dimension so pass in zero for the
03:47 - first dimension
03:48 - i plus plus and then we need a nested
03:52 - for loop
03:53 - so change i to j get
03:56 - length one so this represents the second
04:00 - dimension remember that these always
04:01 - start with zero
04:03 - and then change i to j plus plus so
04:06 - during each iteration of the inner for
04:08 - loop
04:09 - let's change this from right line to
04:11 - right i will display
04:14 - parking lot straight brackets
04:18 - i comma j then i'm just going to add a
04:21 - space to separate
04:23 - each car and then when we escape our for
04:26 - loop we
04:27 - need to go down to the next row so i'll
04:29 - use an empty right line statement
04:31 - so by using nested for loops we can
04:33 - display
04:34 - our two-dimensional array as sort of a
04:36 - grid or matrix
04:38 - so we have our mustang f-150 our fusion
04:42 - corvette camaro silverado tacoma camry
04:45 - and rav4
04:47 - so if you ever need like a grid or
04:48 - matrix of data you can always use a
04:50 - multi-dimensional array
04:52 - and these are kind of the steps to set
04:54 - it up so yeah those are
04:56 - multi-dimensional arrays if you found

Cleaned transcript:

all right what's going on multidimensional arrays so just a fair warning this is a difficult topic if you want you can skip this video you won't hurt my feelings but if you'd like to know what a multidimensional array is well here we go so a multidimensional array is an array of arrays so i have three standard arrays i have different car manufacturers ford chevy and toyota so each array has three different kinds of cars a multidimensional array is good if you need like some sort of grid or matrix of data so what i would like to do is to create an array of arrays to simulate maybe like a parking lot to park all of these cars so to create a multidimensional array this will be a twodimensional array we need to list the data type of what we're storing strings then a set of straight brackets and then within the straight brackets add a comma so now i'm going to name this array let's say parking lot equals and then we add our curly braces much like what we do with standard arrays however i'm going to add each array within the set of curly braces and then separate each with a comma so this can be somewhat difficult to read i like to kind of condense it all and just make it look nice so you can see that this resembles sort of like a grid with rows and columns and that visual is going to help us so to access one of these elements we need to list an index for the row and an index for the column so let's say i would like to change this explorer to something else so in order to access this element i'm going to type the name of our multidimensional array straight brackets and then i need a row and column so these always start with zero this would be row zero row one row two i need to access row one so that would be zero then comma for column and then i need to count the row number zero one two so that would be zero comma two for this element within my twodimensional array so i'm going to change this to something else so let's say that this is a ford fusion and then let's display these elements we can use a for each loop for each the data type is string let's say car in parking lot and then i will just iterate through this console.writeline card so this will iterate nine times one for each element within our twodimensional array so we have a mustang f150 then fusion so we updated explorer to fusion so let's update maybe this corolla to something else so let's count the row number that would be zero one two parking lot two and the column number is zero and let's say that this is a tacoma and try this again okay we have instead of a corolla a tacoma now if you would like to display this as like a grid we can use nested for loops for that so let's get rid of this for each loop i'll just turn this all into one giant comment okay so to display this as like a grid we'll use nested for loops the outer loop will be four and i equals zero we will continue this as long as i is less than parking lot dot get length method and then pass in the dimension so pass in zero for the first dimension i plus plus and then we need a nested for loop so change i to j get length one so this represents the second dimension remember that these always start with zero and then change i to j plus plus so during each iteration of the inner for loop let's change this from right line to right i will display parking lot straight brackets i comma j then i'm just going to add a space to separate each car and then when we escape our for loop we need to go down to the next row so i'll use an empty right line statement so by using nested for loops we can display our twodimensional array as sort of a grid or matrix so we have our mustang f150 our fusion corvette camaro silverado tacoma camry and rav4 so if you ever need like a grid or matrix of data you can always use a multidimensional array and these are kind of the steps to set it up so yeah those are multidimensional arrays if you found this video helpful please be sure to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
