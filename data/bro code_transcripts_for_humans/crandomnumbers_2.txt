00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's bro
00:01 - hope you're doing well and in this video
00:03 - i'm going to explain how we can generate
00:04 - some random numbers in c
00:06 - sharp so sit back relax and enjoy the
00:09 - show
00:11 - all right people here's how to generate
00:13 - some random numbers
00:14 - just so you know these are not true
00:16 - random numbers but rather
00:18 - pseudo-random numbers and they're fairly
00:19 - darn close so to create some random
00:22 - numbers
00:22 - we'll need to instantiate a random
00:24 - object type random with an uppercase r
00:27 - random with lowercase r equals new
00:30 - random parentheses semicolon
00:33 - so the name of our random object is
00:35 - random really you couldn't name this
00:36 - anything but i usually just call it
00:38 - random
00:39 - and we can use this object to generate
00:41 - random numbers and there's a few
00:42 - built-in methods of this random object
00:44 - to access them add a dot and we'll focus
00:47 - on
00:48 - the next method and next double method
00:51 - next we'll generate a random whole
00:52 - integer so we'll want to specify a range
00:55 - this by itself will generate a random
00:57 - number between i believe
00:59 - zero and just over two billion so we'll
01:01 - probably want to set a range
01:03 - let's pretend that we're rolling a six
01:05 - sided dice i need a random number
01:07 - between
01:07 - one and six so i can set that range
01:10 - within the parentheses
01:11 - so the minimum would be 1 comma and the
01:14 - max would be
01:15 - technically 7 because the second number
01:17 - is going to be exclusive
01:19 - so this will give us a random number
01:21 - between 1 and
01:22 - 6. just specify the range and we'll
01:25 - store this within a variable
01:26 - int num equals random.next a random
01:30 - number between
01:30 - one and a six all right then let's
01:33 - display this
01:35 - console.writeline num and we should have
01:37 - a random number between
01:39 - one and six
01:42 - and we got six all right then you can
01:45 - always make adjustments to this too like
01:46 - you can add i don't know 100
01:49 - and that should give us a number between
01:51 - 101 and 106.
01:53 - so that's always an option too okay now
01:56 - what if you need to roll a 20-sided dice
01:58 - like we're playing dungeons and dragons
02:00 - we use polyhedral dice so that would be
02:03 - 1
02:03 - comma 21 and this will give us a random
02:06 - number between
02:07 - 1 and 20 and we rolled an 8.
02:10 - now there is a next double method which
02:13 - will generate a random decimal number
02:15 - so let's say double num equals random
02:19 - dot next double
02:23 - and the random number will be between
02:25 - zero and
02:26 - one so we have 0.7016 something
02:31 - something something something
02:32 - so if you need a random decimal or
02:35 - random double number
02:36 - you can use random.next double otherwise
02:39 - if you need a random whole integer
02:41 - you're better off using the next method
02:44 - of random
02:45 - now if you need let's say three random
02:46 - numbers we can keep on reusing the same
02:48 - random object we only need to
02:50 - instantiate it once
02:51 - let's say we're going to roll three dice
02:54 - so three
02:55 - six sided dice let's copy what we have
02:57 - and paste it twice
02:59 - so we have num1 num2 num3
03:03 - then let's display these
03:04 - console.writeline num1
03:07 - num2 and num3
03:10 - so we will have 3 random numbers and the
03:14 - result is
03:15 - 3 6 and 4. well okay then everybody that
03:18 - is how to
03:19 - generate random numbers in c sharp i
03:22 - will post this code to the comment
03:23 - section down below
03:24 - if you can give this video a thumbs up
03:26 - drop a random comment down below
03:28 - and well that's how to generate random
03:30 - numbers in c sharp

hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain how we can generate some random numbers in c sharp so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right people here's how to generate some random numbers just so you know these are not true random numbers but rather pseudorandom numbers and they're fairly darn close so to create some random numbers we'll need to instantiate a random object type random with an uppercase r random with lowercase r equals new random parentheses semicolon so the name of our random object is random really you couldn't name this anything but i usually just call it random and we can use this object to generate random numbers and there's a few builtin methods of this random object to access them add a dot and we'll focus on the next method and next double method next we'll generate a random whole integer so we'll want to specify a range this by itself will generate a random number between i believe zero and just over two billion so we'll probably want to set a range let's pretend that we're rolling a six sided dice i need a random number between one and six so i can set that range within the parentheses so the minimum would be 1 comma and the max would be technically 7 because the second number is going to be exclusive so this will give us a random number between 1 and 6. just specify the range and we'll store this within a variable int num equals random.next a random number between one and a six all right then let's display this console.writeline num and we should have a random number between one and six and we got six all right then you can always make adjustments to this too like you can add i don't know 100 and that should give us a number between 101 and 106. so that's always an option too okay now what if you need to roll a 20sided dice like we're playing dungeons and dragons we use polyhedral dice so that would be 1 comma 21 and this will give us a random number between 1 and 20 and we rolled an 8. now there is a next double method which will generate a random decimal number so let's say double num equals random dot next double and the random number will be between zero and one so we have 0.7016 something something something something so if you need a random decimal or random double number you can use random.next double otherwise if you need a random whole integer you're better off using the next method of random now if you need let's say three random numbers we can keep on reusing the same random object we only need to instantiate it once let's say we're going to roll three dice so three six sided dice let's copy what we have and paste it twice so we have num1 num2 num3 then let's display these console.writeline num1 num2 and num3 so we will have 3 random numbers and the result is 3 6 and 4. well okay then everybody that is how to generate random numbers in c sharp i will post this code to the comment section down below if you can give this video a thumbs up drop a random comment down below and well that's how to generate random numbers in c sharp
