00:22 - all right everybody welcome back in this
00:24 - video i'm going to be explaining 2d
00:26 - arrays
00:26 - a 2d array is an array of arrays think
00:29 - of a 2d array as having
00:31 - a number of rows and columns that's how
00:34 - i think of it at least
00:35 - we're going to be assigning some cars
00:37 - some card names into
00:38 - each element of our 2d array think of it
00:41 - like
00:42 - a parking lot and each element has
00:45 - a row and column kind of like a parking
00:47 - spot number
00:48 - so to begin let's declare a 2d array and
00:51 - allocate some memory
00:53 - so the data type will be string then for
00:55 - a 2d array we need
00:57 - two sets of straight brackets this time
00:59 - and then the name of the array we will
01:01 - call this cars
01:02 - equals new the data type again which is
01:05 - string
01:06 - two sets of straight brackets and then
01:09 - we will list
01:10 - the amount of rows and columns so
01:13 - let's say this will be three by three
01:15 - three arrays and each array is going to
01:17 - have
01:18 - three elements so let's begin assigning
01:20 - some cars into
01:21 - our 2d array let's begin with row
01:25 - zero so in order to access a certain
01:28 - element of our array we type in the
01:29 - array name
01:30 - and this time we will add two sets of
01:32 - straight braces
01:34 - we would like to access element
01:37 - zero zero so this is
01:40 - row zero column zero equals
01:43 - and let's assign a name of camaro
01:47 - now we would like to access row zero
01:51 - column one and let's assign a different
01:54 - car
01:54 - maybe a corvette cars
01:58 - at row zero index two
02:02 - will equal maybe a silverado
02:06 - all right we're going to move to row
02:09 - one now actually i'm just going to copy
02:11 - what we have here
02:12 - paste it so we are now on row one
02:15 - column zero and let's assign a different
02:18 - car
02:18 - maybe a mustang and let's repeat the
02:21 - process
02:22 - just to speed this up i'm going to do a
02:24 - little bit of copying and pasting
02:25 - so we're within row one and then we have
02:28 - column
02:29 - zero one and two and let's change some
02:32 - of these names
02:34 - for row one column one i will assign a
02:36 - value of ranger
02:38 - and row one column two maybe f
02:42 - one fifty okay so we are now within
02:45 - row two column zero so i'm going to copy
02:49 - that
02:50 - change some of the values row 2 column 0
02:53 - i will assign a value of ferrari
02:57 - we are now on row 2
03:00 - column 1 i will assign a value of maybe
03:04 - lambo for lamborghini and then lastly
03:07 - row two column two and i will place a
03:11 - tesla in this element and there we have
03:15 - it we have assigned all of the values
03:16 - within our 2d array
03:18 - so let's display all of the elements of
03:21 - our 2d array
03:22 - using a nested for loop so we will have
03:25 - a outer for loop in charge of the rows
03:28 - and an inner for loop in charge of the
03:30 - columns
03:30 - so let's create a nested for loop so
03:33 - this is the outer for loop
03:35 - we'll need an index int we'll call it i
03:37 - for index
03:38 - equals zero and then we will continue
03:41 - this for loop as long as i
03:43 - is less than cars dot
03:46 - length and lastly we will increment our
03:51 - counter our index i by one within the
03:54 - for loop
03:54 - let's add a blank print line just so
03:56 - that we move our cursor down to the next
03:59 - row within the console window when we
04:01 - display
04:01 - each row of cars that we have now we
04:04 - need an inner for loop to display
04:07 - each column each element within each
04:09 - column of our 2d array
04:10 - so we'll need an index let's call this
04:12 - int j because j
04:14 - comes after i set this equal to zero
04:16 - that's the first statement
04:18 - our condition is going to look a little
04:20 - funky we'll continue this inner for loop
04:22 - as long as
04:23 - j is less than cars
04:26 - at index i dot length
04:31 - so this will take the length of our
04:33 - first row
04:34 - and we'll continue our counter our index
04:37 - of j
04:38 - as long as it's less than the length of
04:42 - our row that we're currently on and then
04:43 - we will increment
04:45 - our index j by one within
04:48 - the inner for loop all we'll do is
04:51 - print our array of cars
04:55 - at element i for this first set
04:58 - of straight brackets and
05:02 - j cars at row i column j
05:06 - and then maybe i'll add a space just to
05:08 - separate these
05:09 - and what we get here is that this will
05:11 - display our 2d
05:12 - array of cars that we have now there is
05:15 - an additional way
05:16 - to write this 2d array instead of
05:18 - allocating all of the memory for this 2d
05:21 - array
05:21 - what we could have done is assign all of
05:23 - the values right away to this 2d array
05:25 - when we declared it
05:27 - if you prefer to write it that way this
05:29 - is what we'll change
05:30 - instead of allocating all of the space
05:32 - all of the elements that we would like
05:34 - for this 2d array
05:35 - we're instead going to assign all of the
05:37 - values so let's get rid of this portion
05:39 - and we're first going to assign all of
05:41 - the values within
05:43 - row number zero this is our first array
05:47 - so within our set of curly braces we
05:49 - will add
05:50 - our camaro followed by our corvette
05:55 - and lastly our silverado
05:59 - so this is row one it's its own array
06:02 - we will add a second array for row
06:05 - number
06:06 - one the first row was row number zero
06:09 - so in our second array
06:12 - of row one we have our mustang
06:17 - followed by our ranger
06:21 - and lastly our f-150
06:26 - okay that is array number two also known
06:30 - as
06:30 - row one we are now on row two
06:34 - so let's add another array and we have
06:37 - our ferrari
06:41 - followed by our lambo
06:48 - and lastly our tesla
06:53 - all right and then with all of this i'm
06:55 - going to enclose
06:56 - all of these arrays within another set
06:59 - of curly braces
07:02 - then i'll need to add a semicolon to the
07:04 - end
07:05 - and just so that this is easier to read
07:07 - i'm going to separate each
07:08 - array within a new line
07:16 - so it should look something like this
07:22 - ah that's good enough
07:27 - sorry i'm very particular about the
07:28 - appearance okay so this is our
07:30 - 2d array of cars that we have and you
07:33 - can see that it will work much the same
07:35 - even if i remove
07:37 - all of these lines of code
07:40 - the only difference is that we're
07:42 - assigning all of the values to our 2d
07:44 - array when we declare it
07:46 - alright everybody so that is the basics
07:48 - of 2d arrays it's really just an array
07:51 - of arrays think of it as having rows and
07:54 - columns
07:54 - if you'd like a copy of this code i will

going to be explaining 2d arrays a 2d array is an array of arrays think of a 2d array as having a number of rows and columns that's how i think of it at least we're going to be assigning some cars some card names into each element of our 2d array think of it like a parking lot and each element has a row and column kind of like a parking spot number so to begin let's declare a 2d array and allocate some memory so the data type will be string then for a 2d array we need two sets of straight brackets this time and then the name of the array we will call this cars equals new the data type again which is string two sets of straight brackets and then we will list the amount of rows and columns so let's say this will be three by three three arrays and each array is going to have three elements so let's begin assigning some cars into our 2d array let's begin with row zero so in order to access a certain element of our array we type in the array name and this time we will add two sets of straight braces we would like to access element zero zero so this is row zero column zero equals and let's assign a name of camaro now we would like to access row zero column one and let's assign a different car maybe a corvette cars at row zero index two will equal maybe a silverado all right we're going to move to row one now actually i'm just going to copy what we have here paste it so we are now on row one column zero and let's assign a different car maybe a mustang and let's repeat the process just to speed this up i'm going to do a little bit of copying and pasting so we're within row one and then we have column zero one and two and let's change some of these names for row one column one i will assign a value of ranger and row one column two maybe f one fifty okay so we are now within row two column zero so i'm going to copy that change some of the values row 2 column 0 i will assign a value of ferrari we are now on row 2 column 1 i will assign a value of maybe lambo for lamborghini and then lastly row two column two and i will place a tesla in this element and there we have it we have assigned all of the values within our 2d array so let's display all of the elements of our 2d array using a nested for loop so we will have a outer for loop in charge of the rows and an inner for loop in charge of the columns so let's create a nested for loop so this is the outer for loop we'll need an index int we'll call it i for index equals zero and then we will continue this for loop as long as i is less than cars dot length and lastly we will increment our counter our index i by one within the for loop let's add a blank print line just so that we move our cursor down to the next row within the console window when we display each row of cars that we have now we need an inner for loop to display each column each element within each column of our 2d array so we'll need an index let's call this int j because j comes after i set this equal to zero that's the first statement our condition is going to look a little funky we'll continue this inner for loop as long as j is less than cars at index i dot length so this will take the length of our first row and we'll continue our counter our index of j as long as it's less than the length of our row that we're currently on and then we will increment our index j by one within the inner for loop all we'll do is print our array of cars at element i for this first set of straight brackets and j cars at row i column j and then maybe i'll add a space just to separate these and what we get here is that this will display our 2d array of cars that we have now there is an additional way to write this 2d array instead of allocating all of the memory for this 2d array what we could have done is assign all of the values right away to this 2d array when we declared it if you prefer to write it that way this is what we'll change instead of allocating all of the space all of the elements that we would like

within our set of curly braces we will add our camaro followed by our corvette and lastly our silverado so this is row one it's its own array we will add a second array for row number one the first row was row number zero so in our second array of row one we have our mustang followed by our ranger and lastly our f150 okay that is array number two also known as row one we are now on row two so let's add another array and we have our ferrari followed by our lambo and lastly our tesla all right and then with all of this i'm going to enclose all of these arrays within another set of curly braces then i'll need to add a semicolon to the end and just so that this is easier to read i'm going to separate each array within a new line so it should look something like this ah that's good
