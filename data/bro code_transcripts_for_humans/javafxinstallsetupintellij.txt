00:00 - hey what's going on people it's bro hope
00:02 - you're doing well and in this video i'm
00:03 - going to explain how we can download and
00:05 - set up
00:06 - javafx for intellij so sit back
00:09 - relax and enjoy the show
00:13 - if you wouldn't mind please like comment
00:15 - and subscribe
00:16 - one like equals one prayer for the
00:18 - youtube algorithm
00:20 - step one is to download the java fx sdk
00:24 - you can just google this
00:25 - so go to this first link open jfx
00:29 - dot io scroll down to getting started
00:32 - click this visit button
00:34 - go to java fx and intellij
00:37 - non-modular from ide and there should be
00:40 - a link here download the appropriate
00:42 - javafx sdk
00:45 - scroll down to latest release and select
00:48 - the correct sdk for your operating
00:50 - system i'm running windows so i'm going
00:53 - to download this first link
00:55 - once that's downloaded you may need to
00:57 - extract this file
00:58 - i'm going to right click on this file
01:01 - and extract all
01:02 - and you'll probably want to extract this
01:04 - file to a location that you'll remember
01:07 - i'm just going to keep this my downloads
01:08 - folder because i'm really lazy
01:10 - so we just need to extract this file and
01:12 - give it a second
01:14 - all right and then once that file is
01:16 - extracted we can move on to step two
01:19 - step two is to create a new javafx
01:22 - project within intellij we can do so by
01:24 - going to
01:25 - file new project
01:28 - go to javafx project select the
01:31 - appropriate
01:32 - sdk next we
01:35 - should come up with a name for this
01:36 - project let's call this hellofx
01:39 - and finish
01:43 - and you can click this window
01:48 - all right so then if everything checks
01:50 - out you should have
01:51 - a main.java file and there's going to be
01:55 - some warnings here
01:57 - this will be a sample that will create a
01:59 - basic window for you but there's still a
02:01 - few more things that we need to do to
02:03 - get this up and running
02:04 - which will bring us to step three step
02:06 - three is to add
02:08 - our sdk library go to file
02:11 - project structure libraries plus
02:15 - java and then find wherever you placed
02:19 - that
02:19 - sdk download that you extracted so for
02:22 - me
02:23 - that's in downloads probably not the
02:25 - best spot but i don't really care
02:27 - so open up that sdk folder and go to
02:30 - your library folder
02:32 - okay okay
02:36 - apply okay if you did everything
02:40 - correctly then all of those red warnings
02:42 - should go away
02:43 - step four is to add virtual machine
02:46 - options head back to this webpage
02:48 - open jfx dot io go to java fx and
02:52 - intellij
02:53 - non-modular from ide and scroll down to
02:56 - the portion regarding adding
02:58 - virtual machine options so we'll need to
03:00 - copy some text
03:02 - if you're using linux or mac copy this
03:04 - line of text
03:05 - if you're using windows copy this other
03:08 - line of text
03:08 - so i'm running windows i will copy this
03:11 - line of text
03:12 - and i'll include both of these in the
03:13 - description for this video
03:15 - so you don't have to navigate to this
03:16 - webpage if you don't want to let's head
03:18 - back to intellij
03:20 - within intellij to add virtual machine
03:22 - options go to the top toolbar
03:24 - under run edit configurations
03:27 - vm options and then paste all of that
03:31 - text
03:31 - that we copied within the quotes there
03:34 - is currently a
03:35 - file path we need to delete this and
03:37 - replace this with the file path of that
03:39 - sdk
03:40 - that we downloaded so locate the sdk
03:44 - that you extracted
03:47 - and navigate to the library folder we
03:49 - need
03:50 - this address so i'm going to right click
03:53 - copy address go back to vm options and
03:57 - within the quotes i'm going to
03:59 - paste this new file path to the library
04:02 - folder of my extracted sdk
04:04 - apply then okay if you've done
04:07 - everything correctly
04:08 - after running this program a small
04:11 - window
04:11 - should appear and this will serve as the
04:14 - foundation for all of our javafx
04:16 - gui applications alright everybody
04:19 - that's how to download and set up
04:21 - javafx for intellij if you would like a
04:24 - copy of all these steps and the relevant
04:26 - links
04:27 - i will post those in the description
04:28 - down below but yeah that's how to set up
04:31 - javafx for intellij
04:34 - hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you
04:36 - learned something new
04:37 - then help me help you in three easy
04:40 - steps
