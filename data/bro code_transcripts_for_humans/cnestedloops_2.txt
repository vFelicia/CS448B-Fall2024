00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's you
00:01 - bro hope you're doing well
00:03 - and in this video we're going to use
00:04 - nested loops to create a program
00:06 - to draw a rectangle for us made out of a
00:08 - certain symbol that we choose
00:10 - so sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:15 - all right welcome back so nested loops a
00:18 - nested loop is a
00:20 - loop that's inside of another loop there
00:22 - is an outer loop
00:23 - and an inner loop and both of these
00:25 - combined are nested
00:27 - loops so the uses they vary they're used
00:30 - a lot in sorting algorithms so i thought
00:32 - let's create a program
00:33 - where we will draw a rectangle we'll
00:36 - have the outer loop in charge of
00:37 - counting the rows
00:39 - and the inner loop in charge of counting
00:40 - the columns and we will let the user
00:43 - choose a symbol that they would like to
00:44 - create their rectangle of
00:46 - so we'll need to accept some user input
00:48 - so console.writeline
00:50 - let's ask how many rows how many
00:54 - rows actually let's make this a write
00:58 - statement
01:00 - okay and then we will store this within
01:02 - int rows
01:04 - equals then we will need to convert some
01:06 - user input
01:07 - convert 2 and 32
01:10 - because user input's always a string
01:13 - then within the parenthesis console.read
01:17 - line okay let's ask
01:21 - for columns so let's copy this paste it
01:27 - how many columns int
01:31 - columns then let's ask the user for a
01:35 - symbol to use
01:41 - what symbol or character
01:45 - and let's use a string i guess you can
01:47 - use a char
01:48 - as well string symbol
01:51 - and we do not need to convert this
01:53 - because it's already a string
01:54 - okay we'll have an outer loop in charge
01:57 - of counting the rows
01:58 - and the inner loop is in charge of
02:00 - counting the columns
02:02 - so for then we need our index
02:06 - by the way it doesn't matter if you use
02:07 - a while loop or a for loop
02:09 - it's just the concept of having a loop
02:11 - inside of another loop
02:12 - i just so happen to be using a for loop
02:15 - for the outer loop and a for loop for
02:17 - the inner loop
02:18 - so int i equals zero
02:23 - we will continue this as long as i is
02:26 - less than
02:27 - our rows because we're letting the user
02:29 - choose how many rows
02:31 - then we will increment i by one during
02:33 - each iteration
02:35 - now we need an inner for loop and let's
02:37 - just copy this
02:39 - now one naming convention with the index
02:42 - of the inner for loop
02:43 - since i is already taken what people
02:45 - usually use for an index
02:47 - for the inner loop is j because j comes
02:49 - after i
02:50 - i guess so into j equals zero
02:53 - j is less than columns
02:57 - then j plus plus okay
03:00 - now what we'll do within the inner for
03:02 - loop is
03:03 - display our symbol so console
03:06 - dot right make sure you use right and
03:09 - not right line
03:10 - we will display our symbol so
03:13 - this inner loop is in charge of the
03:15 - columns the outer loop is a charge of
03:17 - rows basically how this is going to work
03:19 - is that once we enter our outer for loop
03:23 - we will immediately enter our inner for
03:25 - loop in order to complete
03:27 - one iteration of the outer for loop we
03:30 - have to finish
03:31 - all iterations of the inner for loop and
03:33 - once we finish
03:34 - all iterations of the inner for loop we
03:37 - can complete
03:38 - one iteration of the outer for loop and
03:40 - during the next iteration we have to do
03:42 - it all over again
03:43 - so on the next iteration we would have
03:45 - to complete all the iterations for the
03:47 - inner for loop
03:49 - so this will display a rectangle made
03:52 - out of a certain symbol
03:53 - however there is one thing missing and
03:55 - i'll show you how many rows
03:57 - let's say four how many columns five and
04:00 - what symbol
04:00 - uh what about the i don't know that sign
04:04 - all right so this ended up in one long
04:07 - row
04:08 - so after we complete our iterations for
04:11 - the inner for loop we should probably
04:12 - move down to the next row
04:14 - kind of like a typewriter we finish one
04:15 - line then we move down to the next row
04:17 - so let's use an empty writeline
04:19 - statement just to move down to the next
04:21 - line
04:22 - so if we try this again okay four rows
04:25 - five columns let's use an at sign there
04:28 - we go there's a rectangle we have
04:30 - one two three four five columns
04:33 - and one two three four four rows
04:37 - so basically a nested loop is really
04:39 - just a loop that's inside of another
04:41 - loop when you'll encounter it
04:43 - it really varies but they're used a lot
04:44 - in sorting algorithms
04:46 - and this was a small program just to
04:48 - practice
04:49 - working with nested loops all right so
04:51 - if you want a copy of this code i will
04:53 - post this to the comment section down
04:54 - below
04:55 - if you liked this video give it a thumbs
04:57 - up drop a random comment down below
04:59 - and that is an example of nested loops
05:01 - in c
05:02 - sharp

Cleaned transcript:

hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video we're going to use nested loops to create a program to draw a rectangle for us made out of a certain symbol that we choose so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right welcome back so nested loops a nested loop is a loop that's inside of another loop there is an outer loop and an inner loop and both of these combined are nested loops so the uses they vary they're used a lot in sorting algorithms so i thought let's create a program where we will draw a rectangle we'll have the outer loop in charge of counting the rows and the inner loop in charge of counting the columns and we will let the user choose a symbol that they would like to create their rectangle of so we'll need to accept some user input so console.writeline let's ask how many rows how many rows actually let's make this a write statement okay and then we will store this within int rows equals then we will need to convert some user input convert 2 and 32 because user input's always a string then within the parenthesis console.read line okay let's ask for columns so let's copy this paste it how many columns int columns then let's ask the user for a symbol to use what symbol or character and let's use a string i guess you can use a char as well string symbol and we do not need to convert this because it's already a string okay we'll have an outer loop in charge of counting the rows and the inner loop is in charge of counting the columns so for then we need our index by the way it doesn't matter if you use a while loop or a for loop it's just the concept of having a loop inside of another loop i just so happen to be using a for loop for the outer loop and a for loop for the inner loop so int i equals zero we will continue this as long as i is less than our rows because we're letting the user choose how many rows then we will increment i by one during each iteration now we need an inner for loop and let's just copy this now one naming convention with the index of the inner for loop since i is already taken what people usually use for an index for the inner loop is j because j comes after i i guess so into j equals zero j is less than columns then j plus plus okay now what we'll do within the inner for loop is display our symbol so console dot right make sure you use right and not right line we will display our symbol so this inner loop is in charge of the columns the outer loop is a charge of rows basically how this is going to work is that once we enter our outer for loop we will immediately enter our inner for loop in order to complete one iteration of the outer for loop we have to finish all iterations of the inner for loop and once we finish all iterations of the inner for loop we can complete one iteration of the outer for loop and during the next iteration we have to do it all over again so on the next iteration we would have to complete all the iterations for the inner for loop so this will display a rectangle made out of a certain symbol however there is one thing missing and i'll show you how many rows let's say four how many columns five and what symbol uh what about the i don't know that sign all right so this ended up in one long row so after we complete our iterations for the inner for loop we should probably move down to the next row kind of like a typewriter we finish one line then we move down to the next row so let's use an empty writeline statement just to move down to the next line so if we try this again okay four rows five columns let's use an at sign there we go there's a rectangle we have one two three four five columns and one two three four four rows so basically a nested loop is really just a loop that's inside of another loop when you'll encounter it it really varies but they're used a lot in sorting algorithms and this was a small program just to practice working with nested loops all right so if you want a copy of this code i will post this to the comment section down below if you liked this video give it a thumbs up drop a random comment down below and that is an example of nested loops in c sharp
