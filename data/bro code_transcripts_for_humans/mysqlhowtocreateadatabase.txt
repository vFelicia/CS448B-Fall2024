00:00 - hey everybody in this topic I'm going to
00:02 - show you how we can create alter and
00:04 - drop a database what is a database
00:06 - exactly think of it as a folder it acts
00:09 - as a container tables on the other hand
00:12 - would be the files found within the
00:14 - folder in this topic I'm going to show
00:16 - you how we can create the database
00:18 - itself but we won't be working with any
00:20 - tables until the next topic
00:22 - we'll need to begin by heading to our
00:24 - query window which is this large window
00:26 - right here we're going to write a
00:28 - statement to create a database we will
00:30 - type create there is no case sensitivity
00:33 - in MySQL these keywords such as create
00:36 - they can be all uppercase
00:39 - just the first letter could be capital
00:40 - or you could do all lowercase
00:43 - with the keywords I like to make them
00:45 - all uppercase but that's just me create
00:49 - database
00:50 - and then we'll need a unique database
00:52 - name what about my DB then it's
00:56 - important with all SQL statements to end
00:58 - each statement with a semicolon it's
01:01 - like the period at the end of a sentence
01:03 - that's how we know that the statement is
01:05 - complete so you'll need these three
01:07 - words create database then a database
01:10 - name we just named our database mydb hit
01:13 - this lightning bolt button to execute
01:15 - this statement
01:18 - and in my output window unfortunately I
01:20 - can't increase the font size but I can
01:22 - zoom in this action was successful
01:25 - we have created database mydb if you
01:28 - head to your schemas tab then hit the
01:31 - refresh button you should see a database
01:33 - in here named mydb
01:36 - there's also a database for sys sys is
01:39 - the internal database that MySQL uses
01:42 - we'll want to be sure that we're using
01:44 - the database that we just created to use
01:46 - a database we can either right click on
01:48 - the database
01:49 - then click on set as default schema or
01:53 - you could use a statement
01:54 - use
01:57 - then the name of the database my DB
01:59 - semicolon
02:01 - execute this statement
02:03 - we are now using my database to drop a
02:07 - database type drop
02:09 - database
02:11 - then the name of the database
02:13 - and our database is gone unfortunately
02:16 - we do need a database for this series so
02:18 - let's go ahead and recreate our database
02:21 - create database mydb
02:25 - refresh
02:27 - then just to be sure we're using this
02:29 - database we can either use that keyword
02:31 - use
02:33 - or you can right click on the database
02:34 - and set as default schema
02:37 - all right so we can create use and drop
02:39 - a database how about alter there's two
02:42 - features for beginners I'll mention
02:43 - setting a database to read only the
02:46 - other is enabling encryption let's set
02:48 - our database to be read-only type alter
02:52 - database
02:54 - the name of the database
02:57 - read only equals one this statement
03:02 - would make our database read only
03:05 - if a database is in read-only mode we
03:07 - can't make any modifications to it but
03:09 - we can still access the data Within
03:12 - let's attempt to drop our database drop
03:16 - database mydb
03:20 - uh then we have a red X right here that
03:23 - means we could not complete this action
03:24 - drop database my DB
03:27 - schema my DB is in read-only mode to
03:31 - disable read-only mode you would set
03:33 - read only equal to zero
03:37 - now we would be able to drop this
03:39 - database if
03:41 - all right everybody that is how to
03:42 - create use drop and alter a database
03:45 - think of a database as just a folder a
03:48 - folder can hold files the files will be
03:51 - the tables that we'll create which will
03:53 - store within the database and in the
03:55 - next topic I'll show you how we can
03:56 - create some tables

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody in this topic I'm going to show you how we can create alter and drop a database what is a database exactly think of it as a folder it acts as a container tables on the other hand would be the files found within the folder in this topic I'm going to show you how we can create the database itself but we won't be working with any tables until the next topic we'll need to begin by heading to our query window which is this large window right here we're going to write a statement to create a database we will type create there is no case sensitivity in MySQL these keywords such as create they can be all uppercase just the first letter could be capital or you could do all lowercase with the keywords I like to make them all uppercase but that's just me create database and then we'll need a unique database name what about my DB then it's important with all SQL statements to end each statement with a semicolon it's like the period at the end of a sentence that's how we know that the statement is complete so you'll need these three words create database then a database name we just named our database mydb hit this lightning bolt button to execute this statement and in my output window unfortunately I can't increase the font size but I can zoom in this action was successful we have created database mydb if you head to your schemas tab then hit the refresh button you should see a database in here named mydb there's also a database for sys sys is the internal database that MySQL uses we'll want to be sure that we're using the database that we just created to use a database we can either right click on the database then click on set as default schema or you could use a statement use then the name of the database my DB semicolon execute this statement we are now using my database to drop a database type drop database then the name of the database and our database is gone unfortunately we do need a database for this series so let's go ahead and recreate our database create database mydb refresh then just to be sure we're using this database we can either use that keyword use or you can right click on the database and set as default schema all right so we can create use and drop a database how about alter there's two features for beginners I'll mention setting a database to read only the other is enabling encryption let's set our database to be readonly type alter database the name of the database read only equals one this statement would make our database read only if a database is in readonly mode we can't make any modifications to it but we can still access the data Within let's attempt to drop our database drop database mydb uh then we have a red X right here that means we could not complete this action drop database my DB schema my DB is in readonly mode to disable readonly mode you would set read only equal to zero now we would be able to drop this database if all right everybody that is how to create use drop and alter a database think of a database as just a folder a folder can hold files the files will be the tables that we'll create which will store within the database and in the next topic I'll show you how we can create some tables
