00:01 - hey guys in this topic i'm going to
00:04 - explain overloaded functions in c plus
00:06 - plus and actually with many other
00:08 - programming languages you can have
00:10 - different versions of the same function
00:12 - here's what i mean i have a function to
00:15 - bake a pizza because well i like pizza
00:17 - bake
00:18 - pizza
00:20 - this function will have no parameters
00:23 - all i'm gonna do within this function is
00:25 - display the words
00:26 - here is your pizza
00:30 - then i'll add a new line
00:33 - uh then i should probably add a
00:34 - declaration at the top
00:37 - void baked pizza then to invoke this
00:39 - function i would type the function name
00:44 - here is your pizza
00:46 - this time i would like to bake a pizza
00:48 - that has toppings
00:50 - right now we just have a plain pizza
00:52 - with no toppings and that's kind of lame
00:54 - i'm going to create an additional
00:56 - version of this baked pizza method but
00:58 - it's going to have different parameters
01:01 - void
01:02 - bake
01:03 - pizza
01:05 - we will accept a string
01:07 - standard
01:09 - string i'll name this string topping one
01:13 - we'll accept one topping as an argument
01:17 - standard output here is your
01:20 - i'll add my topping here
01:22 - topping one
01:25 - pizza
01:26 - then be sure to add your function
01:28 - declaration to
01:30 - bake pizza
01:32 - then this time we are accepting a string
01:34 - it is valid for functions to share the
01:36 - same name but you need a different set
01:38 - of parameters a function's name plus its
01:41 - parameters is known as a function
01:44 - signature i can bake a pizza that has no
01:47 - toppings here is your pizza or i could
01:50 - pass in a topping like
01:53 - pepperoni
01:55 - here is your pepperoni pizza let's
01:58 - create an additional function that
01:59 - accepts two toppings
02:03 - so we have topping one topping two
02:06 - here is your topping one
02:10 - and
02:13 - topping two
02:16 - pizza
02:18 - then add your function declaration
02:22 - topping one topping two
02:24 - now i can bake a pizza that has two
02:26 - toppings
02:27 - i would like pepperoni and mushrooms
02:34 - here is your pepperoni and mushroom
02:36 - pizza so yeah everybody those are
02:39 - overloaded functions functions can share
02:41 - the same name but you need a different
02:44 - set of parameters a function's name plus
02:47 - its parameters is known as a functions
02:50 - signature and each function signature
02:52 - needs to be unique kind of like an id so
02:55 - yeah those are overloaded functions if
02:57 - you would like a copy of this code i'll
02:59 - post this in the comments section down
03:00 - below and well yeah those are overloaded
03:03 - functions in c plus plus

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys in this topic i'm going to explain overloaded functions in c plus plus and actually with many other programming languages you can have different versions of the same function here's what i mean i have a function to bake a pizza because well i like pizza bake pizza this function will have no parameters all i'm gonna do within this function is display the words here is your pizza then i'll add a new line uh then i should probably add a declaration at the top void baked pizza then to invoke this function i would type the function name here is your pizza this time i would like to bake a pizza that has toppings right now we just have a plain pizza with no toppings and that's kind of lame i'm going to create an additional version of this baked pizza method but it's going to have different parameters void bake pizza we will accept a string standard string i'll name this string topping one we'll accept one topping as an argument standard output here is your i'll add my topping here topping one pizza then be sure to add your function declaration to bake pizza then this time we are accepting a string it is valid for functions to share the same name but you need a different set of parameters a function's name plus its parameters is known as a function signature i can bake a pizza that has no toppings here is your pizza or i could pass in a topping like pepperoni here is your pepperoni pizza let's create an additional function that accepts two toppings so we have topping one topping two here is your topping one and topping two pizza then add your function declaration topping one topping two now i can bake a pizza that has two toppings i would like pepperoni and mushrooms here is your pepperoni and mushroom pizza so yeah everybody those are overloaded functions functions can share the same name but you need a different set of parameters a function's name plus its parameters is known as a functions signature and each function signature needs to be unique kind of like an id so yeah those are overloaded functions if you would like a copy of this code i'll post this in the comments section down below and well yeah those are overloaded functions in c plus plus
