00:02 - hey let's talk about shadows there are
00:04 - two varieties of shadows we'll discuss
00:07 - text shadows and box shadows in this
00:10 - example i have a basic h1 element let's
00:13 - begin with text
00:14 - shadows with this css property there are
00:18 - three numbers and a color that follow
00:21 - the first three are in pixels and then
00:23 - pick whatever color you want for a
00:25 - shadow maybe gray the first number is
00:27 - for the positioning on the x-axis
00:30 - a positive number will result in the
00:32 - shadow being moved to the right a
00:34 - negative number to the left
00:36 - the second number is for the y-axis
00:40 - a positive number will move your shadow
00:42 - below your text a negative number and
00:45 - your shadow will appear above the text
00:47 - and you can combine these two if i need
00:50 - the shadow to the bottom and to the
00:51 - right i will set these first two numbers
00:54 - to be positive the larger the numbers
00:56 - the greater the displacement of your
00:58 - shadow this third number is for the
01:00 - spread a higher number results in a
01:03 - further spread so if i set this to 15 we
01:05 - can barely see our shadow anymore
01:08 - maybe let's set that to five that's a
01:10 - decent looking shadow
01:12 - okay you can also add more than one
01:14 - shadow i'm thinking for this example
01:16 - we'll create a sort of fire effect
01:18 - around our text
01:19 - so maybe i'll set the color to be yellow
01:22 - and i would like the shadow to appear
01:23 - directly around our text so i will set
01:26 - the first two values to zero
01:29 - and the spread to five or some other
01:31 - number so this kind of looks like our
01:33 - text is glowing so separate each
01:35 - individual shadow with a comma
01:39 - and i would like a red shadow this time
01:43 - and i'll place this directly above our
01:45 - text
01:46 - and set a spread to maybe five
01:48 - yeah there we go that's not a bad
01:50 - looking effect okay now let's discuss
01:53 - box shadows
01:54 - it's the same values as before there's
01:56 - three numbers and a color
01:58 - except this shadow will appear around
02:01 - our entire element
02:03 - let's set this to black i would like the
02:05 - shadow to appear to the bottom right of
02:07 - this element
02:08 - so five five and a spread of five works
02:12 - that's not too bad
02:13 - remember with box shadows the entire
02:16 - element is going to have that shadow
02:18 - effect so you may want to consider
02:20 - setting width and height properties of
02:21 - your elements we can set this so that a
02:24 - shadow appears when you hover your
02:26 - cursor over this element but you need to
02:28 - use the hover selector so h1 colon hover
02:33 - so if i were to hover my cursor over
02:35 - this element
02:36 - then this shadow will appear
02:39 - so it's kind of like a 3d pop-out effect
02:42 - so yeah those are shadows we discussed
02:44 - text shadows and box shadows if you
