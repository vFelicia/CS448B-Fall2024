00:01 - hey welcome back everybody so let's talk
00:03 - about some useful string properties and
00:05 - methods i have a variable user name and
00:09 - assign this whatever your first and last
00:11 - name is if we type this variable and add
00:14 - a dot we have access to a bunch of
00:15 - different properties and methods of this
00:17 - string one of which is the length
00:19 - property this will give us the length of
00:22 - a string how many characters are within
00:24 - the string we could assign this to a
00:26 - variable name length equal username dot
00:30 - length or we could display it i'm going
00:32 - to display this with a console.log
00:35 - statement
00:36 - console.log username.length the length
00:39 - of my name is 8 characters but yours
00:41 - will likely be something different let's
00:43 - cover a few more we can get the
00:45 - character of a string at a given index
00:48 - type the name of the string variable dot
00:52 - char
00:53 - at add a set of parentheses whatever
00:55 - character you would like to return you
00:57 - will add the index of that character
00:59 - computers always start with zero so the
01:01 - first character in the string would have
01:04 - an index of zero so maybe i would like
01:06 - to assign this to a variable let
01:09 - first letter equal username dot char at
01:14 - index zero or you know i could display
01:17 - it with
01:17 - console.log and then just add this
01:20 - variable and method within the
01:22 - parentheses the character at index zero
01:25 - of my string is b then index 1 would be
01:29 - r
01:29 - 2
01:30 - would be o that is the char at method
01:34 - you can find the index of the first
01:36 - occurrence of a letter type the variable
01:38 - name user name
01:40 - dot
01:42 - index
01:43 - of then pass in a character you would
01:46 - like to find the first index of how
01:48 - about o and then i will display this
01:50 - with console.log
01:52 - the index of the first occurrence of the
01:54 - character o is at index 2
01:57 - 0 1 2. there's also last index of
02:03 - last
02:05 - index of and we'll keep that as o
02:08 - the last occurrence of o
02:10 - has an index of five
02:12 - zero one two
02:14 - three four five we can also trim spaces
02:17 - before and after a string
02:19 - so i'm going to display this as it is
02:22 - and i'll turn these into comments
02:25 - okay console.log username
02:29 - and we have all the space that we would
02:30 - like to get rid of
02:32 - so to do that we will reassign username
02:35 - with username.trim
02:39 - this gets rid of any empty spaces before
02:41 - and after any other characters we could
02:43 - make our string all uppercase username
02:46 - equals
02:47 - username.2 uppercase
02:52 - and my name is all uppercase there is
02:54 - also lowercase
02:56 - to
02:57 - lowercase and all the characters are now
02:59 - lowercase okay here's another replace
03:02 - all but this time let's create a phone
03:04 - number
03:05 - let phone number
03:08 - equal then within a set of quotes make
03:10 - up some phone number with dashes
03:16 - 123-456-7890 okay using the replace all
03:19 - method i can replace all given
03:21 - characters with another one so phone
03:24 - number
03:26 - equals
03:27 - phone number
03:30 - dot replace
03:32 - all
03:34 - so this has two arguments the character
03:36 - we would like to replace
03:39 - add a comma
03:40 - the second character is what we'll be
03:42 - replacing all of these dashes with how
03:44 - about a forward slash
03:46 - and we will display phone number
03:49 - so here's my phone number
03:50 - if you would like to eliminate these
03:52 - dashes then just don't type in anything
03:55 - and those dashes are gone so yeah those
03:57 - are a few useful string properties and
04:00 - methods if you have a string variable
04:02 - add a dot and you have access to a bunch
04:04 - of different properties and methods a
04:06 - lot of which we didn't cover but these
04:08 - are just a few of the basics so yeah
04:10 - those are some useful string properties
04:12 - and methods if this video helped you out

hey welcome back everybody so let's talk about some useful string properties and methods i have a variable user name and assign this whatever your first and last name is if we type this variable and add a dot we have access to a bunch of different properties and methods of this string one of which is the length property this will give us the length of a string how many characters are within the string we could assign this to a variable name length equal username dot length or we could display it i'm going to display this with a console.log statement console.log username.length the length of my name is 8 characters but yours will likely be something different let's cover a few more we can get the character of a string at a given index type the name of the string variable dot char at add a set of parentheses whatever character you would like to return you will add the index of that character computers always start with zero so the first character in the string would have an index of zero so maybe i would like to assign this to a variable let first letter equal username dot char at index zero or you know i could display it with console.log and then just add this variable and method within the parentheses the character at index zero of my string is b then index 1 would be r 2 would be o that is the char at method you can find the index of the first occurrence of a letter type the variable name user name dot index of then pass in a character you would like to find the first index of how about o and then i will display this with console.log the index of the first occurrence of the character o is at index 2 0 1 2. there's also last index of last index of and we'll keep that as o the last occurrence of o has an index of five zero one two three four five we can also trim spaces before and after a string so i'm going to display this as it is and i'll turn these into comments okay console.log username and we have all the space that we would like to get rid of so to do that we will reassign username with username.trim this gets rid of any empty spaces before and after any other characters we could make our string all uppercase username equals username.2 uppercase and my name is all uppercase there is also lowercase to lowercase and all the characters are now lowercase okay here's another replace all but this time let's create a phone number let phone number equal then within a set of quotes make up some phone number with dashes 1234567890 okay using the replace all method i can replace all given characters with another one so phone number equals phone number dot replace all so this has two arguments the character we would like to replace add a comma the second character is what we'll be replacing all of these dashes with how about a forward slash and we will display phone number so here's my phone number if you would like to eliminate these dashes then just don't type in anything and those dashes are gone so yeah those are a few useful string properties and methods if you have a string variable add a dot and you have access to a bunch of different properties and methods a lot of which we didn't cover but these are just a few of the basics so yeah those are some useful string properties and methods if this video helped you out you can help me out by smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
