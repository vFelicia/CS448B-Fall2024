00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's you
00:02 - bro hope you're doing well and in this
00:03 - video i'm going to show you a few useful
00:05 - things we can do with backgrounds using
00:07 - css so sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:13 - hey welcome back so in this video i'm
00:15 - going to show you how we can change the
00:17 - background color set a linear gradient
00:20 - and how we can set an image as our
00:23 - background so like we discussed in
00:25 - previous videos you can set the
00:26 - background color by changing the
00:28 - background color property and set this
00:31 - to some color of your choosing
00:33 - now another option is to set a linear
00:36 - gradient the property name is background
00:39 - and the value is linear gradient
00:42 - and within the parentheses you can add
00:44 - two or more colors
00:46 - perhaps sky blue and light
00:50 - green
00:52 - that's kind of nice but unfortunately
00:55 - this background repeats itself once it
00:56 - reaches the last element so we can
00:59 - actually change that with another
01:00 - property and to change that we can set
01:03 - the background
01:05 - repeat property to a value of no
01:09 - repeat
01:11 - here's another issue now we have all of
01:13 - this white space after our last element
01:15 - so there is another property if we would
01:18 - like to stretch this background
01:21 - background
01:23 - attachment
01:24 - and the value is fixed
01:28 - so we can resize this window
01:30 - and the background will adjust
01:32 - dynamically
01:33 - we can change the direction in which the
01:35 - colors head
01:37 - so we will precede our colors with two
01:40 - either top bottom left or right so two
01:43 - top would reverse these colors so green
01:46 - is at the top blue is at the bottom
01:48 - or two left
01:51 - or two
01:52 - right pretty cool right so this time i'm
01:56 - going to apply these colors to the h1
01:58 - header tag as well as the ptag
02:06 - so the background of these elements is
02:08 - this linear gradient but not the
02:10 - background of the body of our html
02:12 - document i'm gonna change this color
02:15 - from light green to white for both
02:18 - and with the p tag let's say two left
02:20 - instead okay now this is how we can set
02:23 - an image as our background
02:25 - so find an image that you like here's a
02:28 - picture of central park and i placed
02:30 - this image along with my index.html file
02:33 - as well as my css file so i will set the
02:37 - background image
02:39 - to a value of url
02:42 - you can place an external url in here
02:45 - but since these files are right next to
02:46 - each other i only have to list the file
02:48 - name
02:49 - my background
02:51 - dot
02:52 - jpg
02:54 - but this is probably going to be a
02:55 - different name for you okay so this
02:58 - image is gigantic i'm going to copy
03:00 - background repeat and background
03:02 - attachment
03:04 - and i will set the background
03:07 - position
03:09 - to center
03:11 - but then i would like this image to
03:13 - expand and shrink based on the size of
03:16 - the window so there's one more property
03:18 - that we need and that is background size
03:22 - and we will set this to cover
03:26 - okay now if i resize this window
03:29 - this image will resize dynamically so
03:32 - yeah everybody that's a little bit about
03:34 - backgrounds using css you can set a
03:36 - background color you can set the
03:38 - background to a linear gradient and you
03:41 - can even set an image as your background
03:43 - so yeah those are a few things you can
03:45 - do to change the background using css if
03:48 - you found this video helpful you can
