With timestamps:

00:01 - hey guys in this video i'm going to
00:03 - discuss the and or as well as not
00:06 - logical operators we'll begin with and
00:09 - the and logical operator will check to
00:11 - see if two conditions are true here's an
00:14 - example we'll ask a user what the
00:15 - temperature is int temp short for
00:18 - temperature
00:19 - standard output this will be a prompt
00:23 - enter the
00:24 - temperature
00:29 - standard
00:30 - input
00:32 - temp
00:33 - with the andological operator we check
00:35 - to see if two or more conditions are
00:38 - true let's see if our temperature falls
00:40 - within a certain range
00:42 - if
00:42 - condition then a set of curly braces
00:45 - we'll check to see if our temperature is
00:47 - above zero if temp
00:50 - is above zero
00:52 - and
00:54 - temp
00:54 - is less than let's say 30. in order for
00:58 - us to execute this if statement both of
01:00 - these conditions must be true
01:03 - this condition and this condition must
01:05 - be true if one of them is false we skip
01:08 - over this if statement so if our
01:10 - temperature falls within that range
01:14 - the
01:15 - temperature
01:18 - is
01:19 - good
01:22 - else
01:24 - standard
01:25 - output
01:28 - the temperature
01:32 - is bad
01:35 - okay let's try it
01:38 - enter the temperature uh let's say it's
01:41 - 25 degrees this will be in celsius
01:44 - the temperature is good let's try it
01:46 - again uh what about negative 100 degrees
01:50 - celsius
01:52 - uh the temperature is bad yeah no
01:53 - kidding one more time uh positive 100
01:57 - degrees celsius
01:58 - the temperature is bad so with the and
02:01 - logical operator we check to see if two
02:03 - or more conditions are true there's
02:05 - another way of writing the same program
02:07 - too we can use the or logical operator
02:10 - which is represented by two vertical
02:12 - bars it checks to see if at least one of
02:15 - two conditions are true
02:17 - if temp
02:19 - is less than or equal to zero
02:23 - or
02:24 - temp is greater than or equal to thirty
02:27 - the temperature
02:28 - is bad else the temperature is good
02:32 - in order for us to execute this if
02:34 - statement only one condition has to be
02:36 - true if both of them are false we don't
02:39 - do anything
02:40 - what's the temperature the temperature
02:42 - is 25 that's within that range
02:45 - the temperature is good
02:47 - one more time enter the temperature it
02:49 - is negative 100 degrees celsius
02:53 - the temperature is bad
02:54 - all right so that's the and as well as
02:57 - the or logical operator there's one more
03:00 - the not logical operator which is an
03:02 - exclamation point it reverses the
03:04 - logical state of its operand meaning if
03:07 - a condition is true it becomes false if
03:10 - it's originally false it becomes true
03:12 - let's create another variable this will
03:14 - be a boolean
03:16 - sunny
03:17 - sunny can be true or false
03:20 - i'll write another if statement
03:23 - if
03:24 - sunny
03:25 - is equal to true
03:28 - now if you're examining to see if a
03:30 - boolean variable is true you don't
03:32 - necessarily need to say
03:34 - equals true you could just type the name
03:37 - of the boolean variable
03:38 - if sunny
03:40 - if sunny is true we'll display a message
03:44 - standard output it is sunny outside
03:52 - else
03:53 - standard
03:54 - output
03:56 - it is
03:58 - cloudy
03:59 - outside
04:01 - okay one more time
04:05 - enter the temperature it's 20 degrees
04:07 - celsius
04:09 - i should probably add some new line
04:10 - characters
04:12 - there enter the temperature it's 25
04:14 - degrees celsius the temperature is good
04:17 - it is sunny outside if we use the not
04:19 - logical operator we can precede a
04:22 - condition with an exclamation point
04:24 - we're checking to see if it's not sunny
04:27 - that means we would want to change our
04:29 - output
04:30 - it is cloudy outside else it is sunny
04:33 - outside
04:35 - let's change sunny to be false
04:37 - enter the temperature it is 50 degrees
04:40 - celsius
04:41 - the temperature is bad it is cloudy
04:43 - outside so yeah everybody those are
04:45 - logical operators and or
04:48 - not your assignment is to use either the
04:51 - and or or otherwise not logical operator
04:54 - then post it in the comment section down
04:56 - below whatever you wrote so yeah those
04:58 - are logical operators in c plus

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys in this video i'm going to discuss the and or as well as not logical operators we'll begin with and the and logical operator will check to see if two conditions are true here's an example we'll ask a user what the temperature is int temp short for temperature standard output this will be a prompt enter the temperature standard input temp with the andological operator we check to see if two or more conditions are true let's see if our temperature falls within a certain range if condition then a set of curly braces we'll check to see if our temperature is above zero if temp is above zero and temp is less than let's say 30. in order for us to execute this if statement both of these conditions must be true this condition and this condition must be true if one of them is false we skip over this if statement so if our temperature falls within that range the temperature is good else standard output the temperature is bad okay let's try it enter the temperature uh let's say it's 25 degrees this will be in celsius the temperature is good let's try it again uh what about negative 100 degrees celsius uh the temperature is bad yeah no kidding one more time uh positive 100 degrees celsius the temperature is bad so with the and logical operator we check to see if two or more conditions are true there's another way of writing the same program too we can use the or logical operator which is represented by two vertical bars it checks to see if at least one of two conditions are true if temp is less than or equal to zero or temp is greater than or equal to thirty the temperature is bad else the temperature is good in order for us to execute this if statement only one condition has to be true if both of them are false we don't do anything what's the temperature the temperature is 25 that's within that range the temperature is good one more time enter the temperature it is negative 100 degrees celsius the temperature is bad all right so that's the and as well as the or logical operator there's one more the not logical operator which is an exclamation point it reverses the logical state of its operand meaning if a condition is true it becomes false if it's originally false it becomes true let's create another variable this will be a boolean sunny sunny can be true or false i'll write another if statement if sunny is equal to true now if you're examining to see if a boolean variable is true you don't necessarily need to say equals true you could just type the name of the boolean variable if sunny if sunny is true we'll display a message standard output it is sunny outside else standard output it is cloudy outside okay one more time enter the temperature it's 20 degrees celsius i should probably add some new line characters there enter the temperature it's 25 degrees celsius the temperature is good it is sunny outside if we use the not logical operator we can precede a condition with an exclamation point we're checking to see if it's not sunny that means we would want to change our output it is cloudy outside else it is sunny outside let's change sunny to be false enter the temperature it is 50 degrees celsius the temperature is bad it is cloudy outside so yeah everybody those are logical operators and or not your assignment is to use either the and or or otherwise not logical operator then post it in the comment section down below whatever you wrote so yeah those are logical operators in c plus
