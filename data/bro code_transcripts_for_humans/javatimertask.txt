00:00 - hey how's it going everybody it's bro
00:01 - here hope you're doing well and in this
00:03 - video I'm going to teach you guys all
00:04 - about timer tasks in Java and at the end
00:07 - of this video we're going to work on a
00:09 - project where we can have a countdown
00:11 - timer that will display a Happy New Year
00:13 - on New Year's Eve so let's get into it
00:18 - if you find this video helpful please
00:20 - remember to Like comment and subscribe
00:22 - your support will help keep this channel
00:25 - running alright everybody I have two
00:27 - definitions here for you
00:28 - the first is timer and this is a
00:30 - facility for threads to schedule tasks
00:33 - for future execution in a background
00:35 - thread and basically what this means is
00:37 - that it keeps track of the time in a
00:39 - background thread and then we have timer
00:41 - tasks and this is a task that can be
00:43 - scheduled for one-time or repeated
00:45 - execution by a timer so this is a class
00:49 - that contains an abstract method called
00:51 - run and when our timer reaches a certain
00:54 - point a certain time it will execute a
00:57 - task either once or repeatedly and we
01:00 - can have that task be whatever we want
01:02 - so we're going to have a timer task that
01:05 - is linked to a specific timer so let's
01:07 - begin by creating an instance of a timer
01:10 - so we're going to type in timer and
01:12 - let's just call this timer with a
01:13 - lowercase T equals new timer and this
01:16 - will just keep track of the time but
01:18 - we'll need an import so let's add that
01:19 - now so import Java dot util dot timer
01:23 - now we're going to create a timer task
01:25 - so let's add that to the next line so
01:28 - timer task and let's call this task
01:31 - equals new timer task then a set of
01:35 - parenthesis then we'll need an import
01:37 - for this as well so make sure that you
01:40 - have these two imports now an easy
01:43 - implementation of the timer task is to
01:45 - add an anonymous inner class so with
01:48 - this timer task we're just going to add
01:49 - a set of curly braces after this and
01:51 - then we need to add unimplemented
01:54 - methods and it's just the run method so
01:57 - this timer task is going to be linked to
02:00 - this timer so when time is up it's going
02:02 - to execute this run function here so
02:05 - when our timer reaches a certain point
02:07 - it's going to execute this run function
02:09 - of our timer task instance so you can do
02:12 - whatever you want with
02:13 - in this run function but let's just
02:15 - start with something simple for this
02:16 - demonstration so I'm just going to
02:18 - create a simple print line statement
02:20 - that says task is complete now what
02:26 - we'll want to do is link this task to
02:29 - this timer so we can use the schedule
02:32 - function of this timer instance so I'm
02:34 - going to add that after our timer task
02:37 - so type in the name of the timer dot and
02:40 - we can use the schedule function and
02:42 - there's a few options here if you have
02:44 - intellisense there's a few variations
02:46 - and different ways to do this but we're
02:48 - gonna start with something simple so
02:49 - this schedule function has two arguments
02:53 - a task and a time and you can see that
02:55 - it filled in the tasks that we're gonna
02:57 - use within this first argument and the
02:59 - second is a time so this is normally in
03:02 - milliseconds so if you were to set this
03:04 - to zero and we ran our program this run
03:07 - function is going to execute immediately
03:09 - so let's try it and our task is complete
03:12 - now this is a delay the second argument
03:15 - so if we were to set this to 3,000
03:18 - milliseconds there would be a
03:20 - three-second delay so you can see that
03:22 - it's not doing anything right now
03:23 - because it's waiting and once that delay
03:25 - is over then it executes our task so for
03:28 - our next example I just turned this line
03:30 - into a comment so you don't have to
03:33 - necessarily just pass in only a numeric
03:36 - value we can pass in a date here if we
03:39 - want this task to be completed at a
03:40 - certain date in the future so we can
03:43 - actually do that utilizing the calendar
03:45 - class so let's create an instance of the
03:48 - calendar class and set the date so we're
03:50 - gonna type in calendar and let's call
03:52 - this date equals calendar dot get
03:57 - instance and then we're going to set
04:00 - things such as the year the month the
04:02 - day the hour so on and so forth so we're
04:05 - going to type in the name of this
04:06 - instance dot set and then within
04:12 - parentheses we're going to type in
04:14 - calendar dot and there's a few
04:17 - recommendations here if you have in the
04:19 - intellisense setup so let's set the year
04:22 - and this is all in caps and then we're
04:25 - going to add a comma and we'll
04:27 - this for 2020 and then we're gonna do
04:30 - the same thing for like the month the
04:32 - day of the month the hour so on and so
04:34 - forth
04:35 - but I'm also gonna change the clock on
04:38 - my computer just to demonstrate this so
04:41 - let's have this task perform at like
04:44 - midnight this day basically so we're
04:47 - gonna do the same thing here and let's
04:50 - set the month so month and let's set
04:55 - this to June
04:56 - so that would be calendar dot June and
05:04 - let's set the day of the month so day of
05:10 - month and we'll set this to June 20th
05:15 - and then we'll do our of day so this is
05:24 - in military time so if you want midnight
05:26 - that's going to be zero
05:29 - so it's zero through 24 basically and
05:32 - let's set the minutes so calendar dot
05:36 - minute and we'll set this to zero then
05:44 - you can do seconds as well so ii will
05:49 - set that to zero and that milliseconds
05:56 - okay so this task is going to execute at
06:01 - midnight june 20th of the year 2020 so
06:05 - I'm actually going to fast forward the
06:07 - clock on my computer to demonstrate this
06:09 - but first we actually need to have this
06:11 - task so we'll add that after here so
06:14 - timer that scheduled task and then for
06:19 - the time what we're going to write is
06:21 - date dot get time and that's it so let's
06:28 - run this okay so here I changed the
06:31 - clock on my computer to just a minute
06:34 - before midnight so once it hits midnight
06:36 - it's going to execute this task so we
06:38 - got three seconds to
06:41 - u10 task is complete now birth they're
06:44 - an example we're going to use a
06:46 - different method of the timer class and
06:48 - that is the schedule at fixed rate
06:51 - method and what this allows us to do is
06:53 - to repeat a task every so often and I
06:56 - think this would be good for some sort
06:58 - of like countdown timer so let's create
07:01 - something like that so timer dot
07:04 - scheduled at fixed rate so this will
07:08 - take a task the time or delay of the
07:12 - first instance or when you want this to
07:14 - be executed and we're going to set this
07:16 - to zero for now and this third value is
07:19 - how often do you want this repeated
07:21 - let's say that we want this to repeat
07:23 - every one second so we'll put 1000 here
07:25 - for 1000 milliseconds so this run method
07:29 - is going to execute every second so
07:31 - let's create a countdown timer so we'll
07:35 - create a variable within here and let's
07:37 - call it counter and set this equal to
07:39 - ten and within this function let's
07:43 - create an if statement in place of this
07:44 - so if counter is greater than zero
07:51 - what we'll do is that we will just
07:54 - display whatever our counter is and then
07:58 - maybe add seconds and then we want to
08:02 - decrement our counter by one so counter
08:05 - - - alright so this is just going to
08:08 - keep on running so we'll want some
08:10 - weight to cancel our timer so we'll add
08:13 - an else statement and then within here
08:15 - why don't we display something such as
08:17 - Happy New Year so will system that out a
08:20 - print line happy new year and then in
08:25 - order for our timer to stop we type in
08:28 - the name of our timer dot cancel all
08:34 - right so since there's no delay on this
08:36 - this is going to begin immediately when
08:38 - we run this so let's try it so it began
08:43 - at ten seconds and it's gonna keep on
08:44 - going down until it reaches zero and
08:47 - then display happy new year so two one
08:51 - happy new year now let's take this
08:54 - even further so let's have this task
08:56 - begin right before New Year's Day like
08:59 - 10 seconds before New Year's Day on New
09:02 - Year's Eve and then we'll have a
09:03 - countdown timer and then once it hits
09:07 - zero midnight of New Year's Day it's
09:10 - going to display Happy New Year so we
09:12 - can use schedule at fixed rate and for
09:15 - the delay we're going to use date get
09:17 - time so I'm just going to copy this
09:20 - paste underneath for our next example
09:22 - and we're going to use date get time in
09:25 - place of our delay here and then we're
09:28 - going to set the day that we want this
09:30 - to begin so let's set this to let's set
09:34 - it to 2020 calendar dot December date of
09:39 - the month the 31st hour of the day so
09:42 - this is in military time so 23 minutes
09:46 - 59 and then seconds let's put 50 here
09:50 - okay so I'm going to move the clock on
09:54 - my computer ahead to just before this
09:56 - time hey you know what why don't I show
09:58 - you guys how to change the time on your
10:00 - computer so I'm currently doing this
10:02 - with Windows so I'm going to hover over
10:04 - the time right click adjust time and I'm
10:09 - going to set the date and time manually
10:12 - and let's change this to December 31st
10:16 - of the year 2020 11:59 p.m. and let's
10:25 - change it and run this okay so let's see
10:30 - the time right now okay so we have about
10:34 - a minute I'm just going to fast forward
10:35 - this video all right everybody our task
10:39 - is about to begin right about now so ten
10:43 - seconds nine seconds eight seconds I'll
10:45 - shut up now so four three two one
10:51 - happy new year alright everybody well
10:54 - that's the basics of timer tasks so you
10:56 - can execute some block of code either
10:58 - once at a specific time or immediately
11:01 - or repeatedly either immediately or at a
11:04 - set date in the future so if you want a
11:07 - copy of all this code
11:08 - I'll post this in the comments down
11:09 - below and yeah that's the basics of
11:12 - timer tasks in Java hey you yeah I'm
11:16 - talking to you if you learn something
11:17 - new then you can help me help you
11:21 - in 3 easy steps by smashing that like

hey how's it going everybody it's bro here hope you're doing well and in this video I'm going to teach you guys all about timer tasks in Java and at the end of this video we're going to work on a project where we can have a countdown timer that will display a Happy New Year on New Year's Eve so let's get into it if you find this video helpful please remember to Like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running alright everybody I have two definitions here for you the first is timer and this is a facility for threads to schedule tasks for future execution in a

let's just call this timer with a lowercase T equals new timer and this will just keep track of the time but we'll need an import so let's add that now so import Java dot util dot timer now we're

delay so you can see that it's not doing anything right now because it's waiting and once that delay is over then it executes our task so for our next example I just turned this line into a comment so you don't have to necessarily just pass in only a numeric value we can pass in a date here if we want this task to be completed at a certain date in the future so we can actually do that utilizing the calendar class so let's create an instance of the calendar class and set the date so we're gonna type in calendar and let's call this date equals calendar dot get instance and then we're going to set

like midnight this day basically so we're gonna do the same thing here and let's set the month so month and let's set this to June so that would be calendar dot June and let's set the day of the month so day of month and we'll set this to June 20th and then we'll do our of day so this is in military time so if you want midnight that's going to be zero so it's zero through 24 basically and let's set the minutes so calendar dot minute and we'll set this to zero then you can do seconds as well so ii will set that to zero and that milliseconds okay so this task is going to execute at midnight june 20th of the year 2020 so I'm actually going to fast forward the clock on my computer to demonstrate this but first we actually need to have this task so we'll add that after here so timer that scheduled task and then for the time what we're going to write is date dot get time and that's it so let's run this okay so here I changed the clock on my computer to just a minute before midnight so once it hits midnight it's going to execute this task so we got three seconds to u10 task is complete now birth they're an example we're going to use a different method of the timer class and that is the schedule at fixed rate method and what this allows us to do is to repeat a task every so often and I think this would be good for some sort of like countdown timer so let's create something like

third value is how often do you want this repeated let's say that we want this to repeat every one second so we'll put 1000 here for 1000 milliseconds so this run method is going to execute every second so let's create a countdown timer so we'll create a variable within here and let's call it counter and set this equal to ten and within this function let's create an if statement in place of this so if counter is greater than zero what we'll do is that we will just display whatever our counter is and then maybe add seconds and then we want to decrement our counter by one so counter alright so this is just going to keep on running so we'll want some weight to cancel our timer so we'll add an else statement and then within here why don't we display something such as Happy New Year so will system that out a print line happy new year and then in order for our timer to stop we type in the name of our timer dot cancel all right so since there's no delay on this this is going to begin immediately when we run this so let's try it so it began at ten seconds and it's gonna keep on going down until it reaches zero and then display happy new year so two one happy new year now let's take this even further so let's have this task begin right before New Year's Day like 10 seconds before New Year's Day on New Year's Eve and then we'll have a countdown timer and then once it hits zero midnight of New Year's Day it's going to display Happy New Year so we can use schedule at fixed rate and for the delay we're going to use date get time so I'm just going to copy this paste underneath for our next example and we're going to use date get time in place of our delay here and then we're going to set the day that we want this to begin so let's set this to let's set it to 2020 calendar dot December date of the month the 31st hour of the day so this is in military time so 23 minutes 59 and then seconds let's put 50 here okay so I'm going to move the clock on my computer ahead to just before this time hey you know what why don't I show you guys how to change the time on your computer so I'm currently doing this with Windows so I'm going to hover over the time right click adjust time and I'm going to set the date and time manually and let's change this to December 31st of the year 2020 1159 p.m. and let's change it and run this okay so let's see the time right now okay so we have about a minute I'm just going to fast forward this video all right everybody our task is about to begin right about now so ten seconds nine seconds eight seconds I'll shut up now so four three two one happy new year alright everybody well that's the basics of timer tasks so you can execute some block of code either once at a specific time or immediately or repeatedly either immediately or at a set date in the future so if you want a copy of all this code I'll post this in the comments down below and yeah that's the basics of timer tasks in Java hey you yeah I'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in 3 easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
