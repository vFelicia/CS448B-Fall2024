00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's bro
here again and in this video we're gonna
00:04 - be covering some useful math functions
and C++ let's get into it
00:10 - I promise that this video won't be as
boring as the last one on string
00:14 - functions it's probably going to be even
worse no it won't be that bad but here's
00:19 - a few math functions that you might find
useful for your programs first thing
00:23 - that we're going to want to do is
include something at the top of our
00:26 - program so outside of your main method
we're going to type this hashtag include
00:30 - then within angle brackets
I'll go rhythm but make sure you spell
00:36 - it right just like that not all
functions that we'll be covering will
00:41 - need this but a few will and I might
forget to mention this later on in this
00:44 - video and it would be a pain in the butt
to have to re-edit this and show you the
00:49 - part of the video where I include this
so let's just get this out of the way
00:52 - and include this now so this video is
going to be more of a showcase of
00:55 - different math functions that we can use
in C++ and if you want to skip around in
01:00 - this video that's completely fine I'll
include some timestamps in the
01:03 - description if there's any math
functions that you'd be interested in
01:06 - the first math function we'll cover is
the max function we can find the higher
01:11 - of two numbers and return the higher
number so let's write a program that
01:16 - will ask the user to enter in two
numbers and the program is going to
01:20 - return the higher number so let's create
two double variables so these can store
01:27 - a decimal portion it doesn't need to be
a whole integer when we write this
01:31 - program so double X and double y we're
not going to assign these value quite
01:35 - yet and then let's create a prompt
perhaps this program will enter the max
01:45 - of two numbers all right and then we are
going to create a prompt to enter in
01:53 - number one enter in number one and then
C in X for our first number and we'll do
02:06 - the same thing for y but we're going to
change a few things enter in number two
02:11 - and we're going to change X to Y and we
can place the result within another
02:16 - variable if we so choose like double Z
so if we want to find the max of two
02:23 - numbers we're going to use the max
function so type in max and then a set
02:27 - of parentheses and we're going to put
two numbers within here and we can just
02:31 - put the variables x and y and then let
us display the result so we'll just see
02:39 - out Z okay everything looks good let's
run this false alarm I have to make a
02:47 - few edits so I forgot to end the line
and I'm just going to add a space after
02:54 - this : space alright it should look
better now all right
03:01 - this program will enter the max of two
numbers enter in number one how about
03:06 - the number 24 and to read number two you
know it's better than 24 25 and the max
03:14 - number is 25 all right now with the
minimum function it's going to be the
03:18 - same process as before but we're just
going to change a few things we're going
03:21 - to change max to men within our little
message here and we're going to switch
03:27 - max to men so this will find the minimum
between two numbers so let's from the
03:35 - same process that we did last time 24
and 25 and the minimum is obviously 24
03:43 - big surprise there right the power
function men that's a pretty cool name
03:48 - power function it returns a number to
the power of another number so in our
03:54 - message what we'll say is this program
will return X to the power of Y all
04:05 - right so enter in number 1 that's right
entry number 2 now we're going to use
04:10 - the powell function that also kind of
reminds me of like those old comic books
04:15 - like Batman where they have like sound
effects for all their kicks and attacks
04:19 - but I'm getting off track again ok let's
run this
04:23 - pow-pow BAM
all right this program will return X to
04:29 - the power of Y entering number 1 perhaps
3 entering number 2 let's say 4 so the
04:36 - result is going to be
81 and that sounds right 3 ^ for is 81
04:41 - let's talk about square roots so the
square root function will return the
04:46 - square root of a variable or number that
you place within the function for this
04:50 - demonstration we will no longer need the
Y variable and we can get rid of this
04:55 - prompt all right so this program will
return square root of a number
05:05 - all right so enter in the number okay so
then what we're going to do here is just
05:15 - type in s Q R T for square root and then
a set of parenthesis and we're going to
05:21 - place the number or variable that we
want to find the square root of within
05:25 - the parenthesis here and then this
variable Z will store it and we can
05:30 - display this all right let's run this
05:37 - all right and turn the number to find
the square root of perhaps 64 that's a
05:42 - nice number and the square root of 64 is
8 the absolute value function will
05:48 - return the absolute value of a number
that's basically its magnitude think of
05:53 - it like how far away the number is from
zero is going to return a positive
05:58 - number so let's change our message to
this program will return the absolute
06:07 - value of a number and turn the number
that's good all right what we're going
06:13 - to do here is change this sq RT to abs
like abs six-pack ABS but it's short for
06:22 - absolute value all right let's run this
06:28 - this program will return the absolute
value of a number and turn the number so
06:33 - let's say negative 42 so this will
return the magnitude of the number
06:39 - basically how far it is away from zero
and it's always a positive number so the
06:43 - answer is 42 the round function will
round a number to the nearest whole in
06:50 - so what will change here is this program
will round a number to the nearest whole
07:01 - integer all right enter in the number
and what we're going to do here is type
07:08 - in round parentheses and then place our
number within here so X all right
07:20 - this program will round a number to the
nearest whole integer enter in the
07:25 - number let's type in the number 3.14 the
first few digits of pi and the result is
07:31 - three so the nearest whole integer to
3.14 in regards to the decimal portion
07:36 - is three now what if we were to type in
a different number like three point five
07:41 - it's actually going to round it up as
long as the decimal portion is at least
07:47 - 0.5 so there's a few other round methods
to you might be interested in the
07:52 - sealing function will always round a
number up to the nearest whole integer
07:56 - so this program will round a number up
I'm gonna feel like typing that much and
08:03 - what we're going to type in here or the
sealing function is it's shorthand C e
08:10 - il-4 sealing like you're touching the
roof the ceiling so let's type in 3.14
08:17 - again and see what the result this so
it's always going to round it up if
08:22 - there's at at least a decimal portion if
this was like 3.0 this would stay the
08:28 - same as 3 but it's always going to round
it up and the opposite of this function
08:33 - is the floor function if there's a
ceiling there's a floor then so this
08:37 - program will round a number down to the
nearest whole integer and we're going to
08:42 - replace this CEI out with floor like the
floor of your house and we'll run this
08:50 - okay so let's type in a number with a
very high decimal portion like three
08:56 - point nine nine and a nine and a nine
and this rounded down to the nearest
09:00 - whole integer which was three
so those are just a few of the math
09:06 - functions available to you we only went
over a few of the basics there's still
09:09 - way more out there I'll post a resource
that you can go to if you're interested
09:14 - in more math functions but these were
just the basics I'll also post the code
09:18 - that we worked on in the comments down
below and pin it to the top if you would
09:22 - like a copy but yeah those are some
basic math functions and C++
09:27 - heyyou if you enjoyed this lesson then
you can help me help you in three easy
09:33 - steps
