00:00 - hey everybody it's your bro hope you're
00:01 - doing well and in today's video I'm
00:03 - going to teach you guys everything you
00:05 - need to know to get started working with
00:06 - PHP so sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:10 - if you would like to be notified if I
00:12 - release new courses in the future be
00:13 - sure to subscribe because I kind of
00:15 - release them randomly that is all PHP is
00:18 - a server-side scripting language it's
00:21 - used to build Dynamic web pages it runs
00:24 - on a server not the user's web browser
00:26 - although haters say PHP is dead it's
00:28 - still used on 70 percent of all known
00:31 - websites I don't know that doesn't sound
00:33 - dead to me many developers prefer PHP
00:35 - for its speed Simplicity and flexibility
00:38 - it's a popular choice for small
00:40 - businesses and Freelancers especially
00:42 - since in the news lately you hear about
00:43 - layoffs in the tech industry PHP was
00:46 - released in 1995 it was originally an
00:48 - acronym for personal home page but that
00:51 - was later changed to PHP hypertext
00:53 - preprocessor to reflect the language's
00:55 - evolution in fact PHP was never intended
00:58 - to be a new programming language it grew
01:00 - organically and out of control until it
01:02 - became the Behemoth that it is today fun
01:04 - fact the mascot of PHP is an elephant
01:06 - which is named elephant Ella PHP find I
01:11 - don't know how I would describe the
01:12 - basics of PHP is as follows a browser
01:15 - sends a request to a server PHP on that
01:17 - server processes that request then the
01:19 - server sends HTML back to the browser
01:22 - our server running PHP can even
01:24 - communicate to a database then back to
01:26 - the web browser PHP is most commonly
01:28 - used with relational databases such as
01:31 - MySQL postgres and Oracle PHP can be
01:35 - written alongside with HTML before
01:37 - beginning the series you'll want to have
01:39 - a solid foundation on HTML you will need
01:41 - to know MySQL but that won't be until
01:43 - about video 20. for your web server I
01:46 - recommend zamp zamp is a cross-platform
01:49 - web server solution stack it's basically
01:52 - a software suite it contains an Apache
01:54 - server MySQL and PHP you'll also need
01:57 - some sort of text editor where are you
01:59 - going going to write the code vs code
02:01 - tends to be the most popular nowadays
02:03 - and that's what I use for my own
02:04 - personal projects we'll write our code
02:07 - with vs code then run our code on our
02:09 - xampp server since we can't run it on a
02:11 - web browser I'll show you how we can
02:13 - download both the xampp server and the
02:15 - vs code text editor now we will begin
02:18 - the installation process of a server
02:20 - that we can execute PHP code within go
02:23 - to this URL
02:26 - apachefriends.org like I said before PHP
02:28 - code is executed on a server and
02:31 - returned to a web browser click on one
02:33 - of the relevant download links for your
02:35 - operating system I'm running Windows I
02:37 - will download the windows version
02:41 - okay for me the installation process has
02:43 - started and it's done so let's open it
02:47 - for setup we're going to click next
02:50 - all we really need is MySQL
02:53 - and phpmyadmin it looks like PHP is
02:57 - already selected for us then next
02:58 - remember this file location my folder
03:02 - containing all of my zamp files is
03:04 - located in my C drive next you can
03:07 - select a language I'll pick English
03:10 - next
03:11 - and give it a minute
03:16 - do you want to start the control panel
03:18 - now we might as well and finish
03:21 - here's the control panel for my zamp
03:23 - server we will start the Apache service
03:26 - if everything works the Apache module is
03:30 - highlighted green that means it's
03:31 - working if you ever need to stop this
03:33 - module you can hit the stop button let's
03:36 - start MySQL as well
03:39 - and our MySQL server is working if you
03:42 - see any red text within this log that
03:45 - means there is an error if you run into
03:46 - any problems just check to see what that
03:48 - error was but everything for me is
03:50 - running fine this control panel will run
03:52 - behind the scenes I can close out of it
03:55 - but it's still running which is
03:56 - important hey this is bro from the
03:58 - future I forgot to mention in this video
04:00 - that if you ever shut down your computer
04:02 - you will have to open up the control
04:04 - panel again and restart these Services
04:06 - yeah I forgot to mention that so be sure
04:09 - to do that now that our xampp server is
04:11 - downloaded we will need that vs code
04:13 - text editor I'm assuming that some of
04:15 - you have that downloaded already but if
04:17 - you don't here's how if you need a text
04:19 - editor I recommend Visual Studio code if
04:22 - you're interested in downloading this
04:23 - text editor head to this URL
04:25 - code.visualstudio.com
04:28 - I'm going to click this blue download
04:30 - button select the correct download link
04:33 - for my operating system I'm running
04:34 - Windows I will select this one
04:37 - then we will run this executable
04:40 - accept the license agreement yes I did
04:43 - read it that fast
04:45 - you do have the option of selecting a
04:47 - destination location
04:49 - I'll keep it as the default
04:51 - next next
04:54 - I'll create a desktop icon then next
04:58 - and install
05:00 - we might as well launch vs code then
05:03 - finish
05:05 - I have vs code open along with the
05:07 - modern web browser I'm using Google
05:09 - Chrome in the series we're going to
05:11 - create a new file within our zamp folder
05:14 - so let's open a folder remember that
05:16 - file path for the zamp server that's
05:18 - where you're going to look for me that
05:20 - was in my C drive go to xampp under
05:23 - htdocs we're going to create a new
05:25 - folder
05:27 - new folder I'll name this folder website
05:30 - to contain my website stuff
05:33 - then I will select folder
05:36 - within my website folder I'm going to
05:38 - create a new file I will name this file
05:42 - index.php the reason that I'm naming
05:45 - this file index is because that is the
05:48 - default for a home page so we now have a
05:50 - PHP file
05:52 - in vs code If you're receiving a warning
05:54 - that states cannot validate since a PHP
05:57 - installation could not be found we need
06:00 - to validate the executable path of the
06:03 - PHP executable found within our xampp
06:06 - server to do that we're going to find
06:08 - our settings file it's a Json file
06:11 - PHP validate executable path edit in the
06:15 - settings Json file
06:17 - let me maximize this
06:19 - next to PHP validate executable path we
06:22 - need to find the file path to the PHP
06:25 - executable
06:27 - again within my C drive
06:30 - within my zamp folder
06:33 - go to PHP
06:36 - then copy this file path for the
06:37 - executable
06:39 - I'll right click
06:41 - go to properties
06:43 - copy this location
06:46 - close out of this window
06:49 - paste that executable path
06:51 - then add PHP dot EXE
06:56 - then these may have to be forward
06:58 - slashes
07:01 - let's save on Windows you can press Ctrl
07:04 - s to save
07:06 - close out of these settings and that
07:08 - warning goes away
07:10 - I also recommend a few extensions
07:13 - the first extension is PHP
07:17 - intellifence
07:22 - it should be this one
07:24 - it gives you access to a few tools that
07:26 - are useful for PHP development let's
07:28 - install that plugin then look up the
07:31 - live server extension it offers a live
07:33 - reload feature
07:38 - then lastly PHP server
07:45 - it allows you to serve your project with
07:47 - PHP
07:48 - those are the three extensions that I
07:51 - recommend
07:55 - alright we are now ready to get started
07:58 - in a web browser to access your xampp
08:00 - server you can type
08:03 - localhost as the URL
08:06 - this will bring you to the zamp
08:07 - dashboard we would like to access the
08:10 - website folder of the zamp server so
08:13 - let's add localhost slash
08:16 - the name of that folder website
08:19 - our PHP code will execute on the server
08:22 - and be returned to this web browser
08:25 - whatever the output is to write some PHP
08:28 - code Type left angle bracket question
08:31 - mark PHP
08:33 - wherever our PHP code ends type question
08:37 - mark right angle bracket
08:39 - our PHP code will be between these two
08:42 - angle brackets to display a message you
08:45 - can type Echo
08:47 - either single quotes or double quotes
08:50 - then a semicolon at the end a semicolon
08:54 - is kind of like the period at the end of
08:56 - a sentence in English I will type a
08:58 - message I like pizza
09:01 - to save you can go to the top file save
09:06 - or use the shortcut which I'll be using
09:09 - so for me that's Ctrl s
09:11 - if I were to reload this webpage it
09:14 - displays my message I like pizza
09:17 - to make your life a lot easier we can
09:20 - add a live server extension to your web
09:22 - browser currently I'm using Chrome to
09:25 - add a live server extension I'm going to
09:27 - go to settings
09:31 - extensions
09:36 - open Chrome web store
09:40 - then search live server
09:45 - and that should be this one
09:48 - add to Chrome
09:52 - ADD extension
09:58 - let's close out of these tabs
10:01 - I'm going to go to extensions
10:03 - select live server web extension
10:07 - enable live reload
10:10 - we'll need the actual server address as
10:13 - well as your live server address
10:15 - this URL is the actual server address if
10:19 - you're on a Mac it may contain a port
10:21 - number such as 8080. so let's copy this
10:25 - address
10:26 - go to extensions
10:30 - then add the actual server address
10:33 - now we need the live server address
10:36 - to find this we can go to vs code press
10:39 - this go live button
10:44 - there should be a new tab that pops up
10:46 - copy this address that is the live
10:49 - server address
10:52 - then we will paste it within the live
10:54 - server address of this live server web
10:57 - extension then press apply
11:01 - you may need to restart your web browser
11:03 - as well
11:06 - all right that was localhost Slash
11:09 - website
11:13 - you know what I don't just like pizza I
11:16 - love pizza
11:18 - if I were to save this file it should
11:21 - update automatically see within our
11:23 - website it now says I love pizza
11:26 - let's add a second line with Echo Echo
11:29 - double quotes add a semicolon to the end
11:33 - let's add another line it's really good
11:39 - the output is all on one line to add a
11:42 - line break
11:43 - within your set of quotes you can add a
11:46 - Break Tag
11:50 - I love pizza it's really good
11:53 - to add a comment a comment is used as a
11:56 - note for yourself or other Developers
11:58 - all you have to type is double forward
12:00 - slashes then some message this is a
12:05 - comment
12:06 - our comment is not displayed as output
12:09 - it's mostly just used for notes
12:12 - for a multi-line comment you would type
12:14 - forward slash asterisk that will begin a
12:18 - multi-line comment
12:20 - this
12:21 - is
12:23 - a multi-line
12:25 - [Music]
12:27 - comment
12:29 - the end of our PHP script is currently
12:31 - green that means it's being included
12:34 - within this multi-line comment wherever
12:36 - you need your multi-line comment to end
12:38 - you would type asterisk then forward
12:41 - slash
12:42 - the end of the script is blue again
12:44 - and you can see that this multi-line
12:46 - comment isn't being displayed as output
12:49 - now the cool thing about PHP files is
12:52 - that they can contain HTML CSS
12:55 - JavaScript and well of course PHP so I
12:58 - will also include some HTML code within
13:01 - this PHP file so in vs code to generate
13:05 - some boilerplate code you can type
13:07 - exclamation point and then tab
13:10 - we now have some HTML markup within our
13:13 - PHP file within the body of our document
13:16 - I'll add maybe a button
13:22 - I'll create a button to order a pizza
13:27 - I should probably precede this button
13:29 - with a line break
13:32 - so there's our button it currently
13:34 - doesn't do anything but that's just a
13:36 - demonstration that you can include more
13:39 - than just PHP code within a PHP file
13:41 - alright everybody so that is an
13:43 - introduction to PHP in the next video
13:46 - we'll discuss variables hey if you're
13:48 - enjoying this video please let me know
13:50 - by Smashing that like button leave a

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody it's your bro hope you're doing well and in today's video I'm going to teach you guys everything you need to know to get started working with PHP so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you would like to be notified if I release new courses in the future be sure to subscribe because I kind of release them randomly that is all PHP is a serverside scripting language it's used to build
