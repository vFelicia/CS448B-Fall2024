00:00 - hello everybody today we will be
00:02 - creating a dice roller program in Python
00:04 - we will be utilizing some ASCII art I'll
00:07 - post all of the ASCII art that we'll
00:09 - need in the description of this video
00:10 - you can copy and paste it to save time
00:12 - if you'd like
00:14 - all right let's get started everybody we
00:16 - will Begin by importing the random
00:18 - module because we will be rolling some
00:20 - random numbers between one through six
00:22 - if we're going to create some ASCII art
00:24 - we'll be utilizing Unicode characters to
00:27 - enter in a Unicode character it really
00:29 - varies depending on your operating
00:30 - system I think the easiest way would
00:33 - just be to use Python to enter a Unicode
00:35 - character type a forward slash then a
00:38 - given code for each character here are
00:40 - all of the codes that we'll need
00:52 - after writing these seven Unicode
00:54 - characters let's run this program these
00:56 - symbols that are output let's copy them
00:59 - I'll add them to a comment
01:01 - then we can delete this line
01:03 - these are the Unicode characters we'll
01:05 - need to build some ASCII art some dice
01:08 - each die will be made out of five lines
01:14 - let's begin with the first we'll need a
01:16 - left corner
01:18 - nine dashes
01:21 - then the right corner
01:24 - for the second line
01:26 - copy this vertical bar add nine spaces
01:32 - then a vertical bar
01:34 - we can copy this whole line
01:36 - paste it two times
01:39 - let's use the left bottom corner
01:42 - add a nine of these dashes
01:46 - then the bottom right corner
01:49 - and here's a basic box shape depending
01:51 - on what the number die is we can add one
01:53 - of these bullet points for a one we can
01:56 - add that right to the middle so that's
01:57 - good for now we'll delete this later
02:00 - let's create a dictionary I will name
02:02 - this dictionary
02:04 - dice art
02:07 - our dictionary is made out of key value
02:09 - pairs so the keys will be the numbers
02:11 - one through six
02:13 - beginning with one the value will be a
02:17 - tuple it's a dictionary made out of key
02:20 - value pairs where the value is a tuple
02:23 - within the Tuple let's add these lines
02:27 - each separated with the comma
02:40 - I'm going to format these so they form a
02:42 - box shape
02:46 - let's take our bullet point
02:48 - place it right in the middle then add a
02:51 - comma to the end of this key value pair
02:53 - that is the first key value pair let's
02:56 - copy all of this
02:58 - paste it again change one to two let's
03:01 - move this bullet point we need two
03:03 - bullet points
03:05 - about right here
03:07 - and here let's repeat this process for
03:10 - Keys three through six
03:36 - be sure to get rid of the comma at the
03:37 - end
03:39 - and here is our dictionary of Dysart
03:42 - each key is a number each value is a
03:45 - tuple made of strings
03:48 - let's create a list of dice our dice
03:52 - will be numbers randomly generated
03:54 - between one and six
03:57 - a total to calculate the total I'll set
03:59 - that to be zero
04:01 - then we will ask a user for a number of
04:04 - dice
04:07 - this will be some input
04:10 - how many dice
04:14 - then Typecast the input as an integer
04:17 - we don't want somebody to write you know
04:19 - 2.5 dice you can't roll half a die to
04:22 - generate a random number you can use the
04:24 - Rand int method of the random module
04:28 - we need a random number between one and
04:31 - six
04:32 - then we need to append this number to
04:34 - our list of dice
04:36 - dice dot append
04:39 - then we can move this line to within the
04:41 - append method
04:44 - we need to do this a number of times
04:46 - depending on how many dice the user
04:48 - enters in
04:49 - we can place this line within a for Loop
04:52 - for every
04:55 - die
04:56 - in our range
04:58 - number of dice this will be a number
05:02 - let's print our list of dice to see what
05:05 - numbers we have in here
05:07 - how many dice I would like five dice
05:09 - five three three four six
05:12 - okay we know that that works let's
05:14 - calculate a total
05:15 - we'll need to iterate and sum all of the
05:19 - elements within our list we can do that
05:21 - with the for Loop
05:23 - for every die
05:26 - in our list dice
05:28 - take our total variable
05:31 - plus equals
05:33 - the current value within our dice
05:36 - then we will print a total I'll use an F
05:39 - string
05:40 - total colon space
05:43 - our total variable
05:46 - let's see what we have so far
05:50 - how many dice I would like five dice
05:52 - our total is 19. now between these two
05:56 - for Loops we will display our ASCII art
05:58 - the easiest way would be to create some
06:01 - nested for loops
06:03 - the outer for Loop will be in charge of
06:05 - the number of dice
06:07 - for every die
06:10 - in our range
06:12 - number of dice
06:17 - the inner for Loop
06:19 - will be in charge of printing every
06:21 - Tuple
06:24 - for every line
06:26 - in
06:28 - than to get a value in our dictionary we
06:30 - would type the name of the dictionary
06:32 - dice art
06:34 - then use the get method
06:36 - what are we getting we're getting a
06:39 - value at a given key
06:41 - let's take our list of numbers dice
06:44 - at index
06:47 - of die our counter
06:49 - depending on what the user types in for
06:51 - the number of dice dye will begin at 1
06:53 - then increment
06:55 - within the inner for Loop we will print
06:59 - the line
07:01 - so let's take a look
07:03 - how many dice I would like three dice
07:06 - and here's our ASCII art six plus two
07:08 - plus four that equals 12.
07:11 - if you would prefer we can display all
07:14 - of these dice on a single horizontal
07:17 - line instead of one vertical line it's a
07:20 - little more tricky though if you would
07:21 - prefer that approach let's turn this
07:24 - chunk of code into comments
07:27 - we will write this nested Loop a little
07:29 - different
07:31 - so each Tuple is made up of five
07:33 - elements right
07:36 - so if we're printing a horizontal line
07:39 - let's say we roll the numbers one
07:41 - through three we would first need to
07:43 - display this line of the first dice
07:46 - then the first line of the second dice
07:49 - then the first line of the third dice
07:52 - during the next iteration of the outer
07:54 - loop we would display the second line of
07:57 - the first dice the second line of the
07:59 - second dice the second line of the third
08:02 - dice
08:03 - so it's a little more complex
08:05 - let's create an outer loop that will
08:07 - iterate five times for every line in
08:11 - range five
08:15 - then the nested Loop will be for every
08:17 - die in dice
08:22 - how many dice do we have within our list
08:27 - we will print we're going to get one of
08:30 - the values found at one of the numbers
08:32 - that we roll
08:35 - take our dictionary of Dysart
08:38 - dot get then a number one through six
08:43 - that will be the value found within our
08:45 - list of dice
08:47 - get the current die remember that this
08:50 - is a number one through six
08:52 - we would then need one of the elements
08:54 - found within our Tuple so get the first
08:57 - line then the second line third fourth
09:01 - fifth
09:04 - so let's add the index operator
09:07 - place our counter of line within the
09:09 - index operator
09:11 - let's see what we have so far
09:13 - we need to add one more thing how many
09:15 - dice three
09:18 - this is an Abomination there's one more
09:21 - change we need to make
09:24 - at the end of our print statement let's
09:26 - set the ending character to be an empty
09:29 - string
09:30 - and that should fix that how many dice
09:32 - three
09:34 - okay we're getting better results
09:36 - then when we escape the inner loop we
09:38 - will print a new line
09:41 - how many dice three
09:43 - and there we are three plus six plus one
09:46 - is ten
09:48 - all right everybody so that is a dice
09:50 - roller program it is kind of complex but
09:53 - I thought this might be a good exercise
09:54 - if you would like a copy of this code I
09:57 - will post all of this in the comments
09:58 - section down below and well yeah that's
10:00 - a dice roller program in Python

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody today we will be creating a dice roller program in Python we will be utilizing some ASCII art I'll post all of the ASCII art that we'll need in the description of this video you can copy and paste it to save time if you'd like all right let's get started everybody we will Begin by importing the random module because we will be rolling some random numbers between one through six if we're going to create some ASCII art we'll be utilizing Unicode characters to enter in a Unicode character it really varies depending on your operating system I think the easiest way would just be to use Python to enter a Unicode character type a forward slash then a given code for each character here are all of the codes that we'll need after writing these seven Unicode characters let's run this program these symbols that are output let's copy them I'll add them to a comment then we can delete this line these are the Unicode characters we'll need to build some ASCII art some dice each die will be made out of five lines let's begin with the first we'll need a left corner nine dashes then the right corner for the second line copy this vertical bar add nine spaces then a vertical bar we can copy this whole line paste it two times let's use the left bottom corner add a nine of these dashes then the bottom right corner and here's a basic box shape depending on what the number die is we can add one of these bullet points for a one we can add that right to the middle so that's good for now we'll delete this later let's create a dictionary I will name this dictionary dice art our dictionary is made out of key value pairs so the keys will be the numbers one through six beginning with one the value will be a tuple it's a dictionary made out of key value pairs where the value is a tuple within the Tuple let's add these lines each separated with the comma I'm going to format these so they form a box shape let's take our bullet point place it right in the middle then add a comma to the end of this key value pair that is the first key value pair let's copy all of this paste it again change one to two let's move this bullet point we need two bullet points about right here and here let's repeat this process for Keys three through six be sure to get rid of the comma at the end and here is our dictionary of Dysart each key is a number each value is a tuple made of strings let's create a list of dice our dice will be numbers randomly generated between one and six a total to calculate the total I'll set that to be zero then we will ask a user for a number of dice this will be some input how many dice then Typecast the input as an integer we don't want somebody to write you know 2.5 dice you can't roll half a die to generate a random number you can use the Rand int method of the random module we need a random number between one and six then we need to append this number to our list of dice dice dot append then we can move this line to within the append method we need to do this a number of times depending on how many dice the user enters in we can place this line within a for Loop for every die in our range number of dice this will be a number let's print our list of dice to see what numbers we have in here how many dice I would like five dice five three three four six okay we know that that works let's calculate a total we'll need to iterate and sum all of the elements within our list we can do that with the for Loop for every die in our list dice take our total variable plus equals the current value within our dice then we will print a total I'll use an F string total colon space our total variable let's see what we have so far how many dice I would like five dice our total is 19. now between these two for Loops we will display our ASCII art the easiest way would be to create some nested for loops the outer for Loop will be in charge of the number of dice for every die in our range number of dice the inner for Loop will be in charge of printing every Tuple for every line in than to get a value in our dictionary we would type the name of the dictionary dice art then use the get method what are we getting we're getting a value at a given key let's take our list of numbers dice at index of die our counter depending on what the user types in for the number of dice dye will begin at 1 then increment within the inner for Loop we will print the line so let's take a look how many dice I would like three dice and here's our ASCII art six plus two plus four that equals 12. if you would prefer we can display all of these dice on a single horizontal line instead of one vertical line it's a little more tricky though if you would prefer that approach let's turn this chunk of code into comments we will write this nested Loop a little different so each Tuple is made up of five elements right so if we're printing a horizontal line let's say we roll the numbers one through three we would first need to display this line of the first dice then the first line of the second dice then the first line of the third dice during the next iteration of the outer loop we would display the second line of the first dice the second line of the second dice the second line of the third dice so it's a little more complex let's create an outer loop that will iterate five times for every line in range five then the nested Loop will be for every die in dice how many dice do we have within our list we will print we're going to get one of the values found at one of the numbers that we roll take our dictionary of Dysart dot get then a number one through six that will be the value found within our list of dice get the current die remember that this is a number one through six we would then need one of the elements found within our Tuple so get the first line then the second line third fourth fifth so let's add the index operator place our counter of line within the index operator let's see what we have so far we need to add one more thing how many dice three this is an Abomination there's one more change we need to make at the end of our print statement let's set the ending character to be an empty string and that should fix that how many dice three okay we're getting better results then when we escape the inner loop we will print a new line how many dice three and there we are three plus six plus one is ten all right everybody so that is a dice roller program it is kind of complex but I thought this might be a good exercise if you would like a copy of this code I will post all of this in the comments section down below and well yeah that's a dice roller program in Python
