00:00 - hey there it's me again in today's topic
00:02 - we're going to create a weight converter
00:04 - program in Python this is an exercise
00:07 - that will follow up the lesson on if
00:09 - statements we'll convert pounds to
00:11 - kilograms or kilograms to pounds the
00:13 - user is going to decide we will Begin by
00:16 - creating a weight variable we will
00:18 - assign some user input
00:20 - enter your weight
00:23 - we will convert this input into a
00:25 - floating Point number
00:27 - so add that cast then we will ask for a
00:31 - unit is this weight in kilograms or
00:33 - pounds
00:35 - input
00:37 - kilograms or
00:40 - pounds
00:43 - we want the user to type in either K for
00:45 - kilograms or L for pounds
00:49 - and these are capital letters by the way
00:52 - using an if statement let's first check
00:54 - to see if our unit is equal to a capital
00:58 - K that means the current weight is in
01:01 - kilograms we need to convert that weight
01:03 - to pounds
01:06 - let's reassign weight equal to
01:10 - our weight times
01:13 - 2.205
01:16 - else if unit
01:18 - is equal to l we need to convert to
01:22 - kilograms
01:24 - weight equals weight divided by 2.205
01:30 - else the user did not type in something
01:32 - that was valid
01:33 - let's print
01:35 - using an F string
01:38 - unit
01:40 - was not valid
01:43 - at the end of our program
01:45 - we will print the new weight I'll use an
01:47 - F string
01:49 - your weight is
01:54 - our new weight after it's reassigned now
01:57 - we need a unit of measurement this is
01:59 - what I'm thinking we'll do within our if
02:01 - and else if statements let's reassign
02:04 - our unit
02:05 - we're reassigning unit to be
02:08 - lbs for pounds
02:11 - else if unit equals kgs four kilograms
02:18 - in our results we will display our new
02:21 - unit
02:22 - let's take a look
02:24 - enter your weight actually I'm just
02:26 - going to make one change I'm going to
02:27 - add colon space
02:30 - there that's much better
02:32 - enter your weight
02:35 - let's say I'm 180 pounds
02:37 - this is in pounds I'll type capital l
02:41 - your weight in kilograms is 81.63
02:45 - I think I'm going to round this
02:47 - I will enclose the weight variable
02:49 - within a round function
02:51 - we will round to one decimal place let's
02:54 - try this again
02:56 - enter your weight maybe I'm 81 kilograms
02:59 - I'll type K for kilograms
03:02 - your weight is
03:04 - 178.6 pounds
03:06 - let's make sure that this else statement
03:08 - works too
03:09 - and to your weight
03:11 - 180 pizzas
03:14 - pizzas was not valid so we're still
03:17 - displaying our output we would want to
03:19 - avoid that if somebody doesn't type in a
03:21 - valid unit
03:23 - so let's cut this line
03:26 - then paste each within the if and else
03:29 - if statements
03:31 - when we exit the else statement we're
03:32 - not printing the output
03:34 - so let's make sure that this works
03:37 - and to your weight I am 100 80 pizzas
03:42 - pizza was not valid
03:45 - alright everybody well that is a weight
03:47 - converter program in Python I thought
03:49 - this would be a helpful exercise now
03:51 - that we have finished the section on if
03:53 - statements and yeah that is a weight
03:55 - converter program in Python

Cleaned transcript:

hey there it's me again in today's topic we're going to create a weight converter program in Python this is an exercise that will follow up the lesson on if statements we'll convert pounds to kilograms or kilograms to pounds the user is going to decide we will Begin by creating a weight variable we will assign some user input enter your weight we will convert this input into a floating Point number so add that cast then we will ask for a unit is this weight in kilograms or pounds input kilograms or pounds we want the user to type in either K for kilograms or L for pounds and these are capital letters by the way using an if statement let's first check to see if our unit is equal to a capital K that means the current weight is in kilograms we need to convert that weight to pounds let's reassign weight equal to our weight times 2.205 else if unit is equal to l we need to convert to kilograms weight equals weight divided by 2.205 else the user did not type in something that was valid let's print using an F string unit was not valid at the end of our program we will print the new weight I'll use an F string your weight is our new weight after it's reassigned now we need a unit of measurement this is what I'm thinking we'll do within our if and else if statements let's reassign our unit we're reassigning unit to be lbs for pounds else if unit equals kgs four kilograms in our results we will display our new unit let's take a look enter your weight actually I'm just going to make one change I'm going to add colon space there that's much better enter your weight let's say I'm 180 pounds this is in pounds I'll type capital l your weight in kilograms is 81.63 I think I'm going to round this I will enclose the weight variable within a round function we will round to one decimal place let's try this again enter your weight maybe I'm 81 kilograms I'll type K for kilograms your weight is 178.6 pounds let's make sure that this else statement works too and to your weight 180 pizzas pizzas was not valid so we're still displaying our output we would want to avoid that if somebody doesn't type in a valid unit so let's cut this line then paste each within the if and else if statements when we exit the else statement we're not printing the output so let's make sure that this works and to your weight I am 100 80 pizzas pizza was not valid alright everybody well that is a weight converter program in Python I thought this would be a helpful exercise now that we have finished the section on if statements and yeah that is a weight converter program in Python
