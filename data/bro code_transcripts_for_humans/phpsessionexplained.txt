00:00 - hey everybody how's it going in today's
00:02 - video I need to explain sessions in PHP
00:05 - because well it's an important topic in
00:07 - PHP a session is a super Global variable
00:11 - that's used to store information on a
00:13 - user to be used across multiple Pages
00:16 - once a session is created a user is
00:18 - assigned a session ID for example these
00:22 - can be used for login credentials once
00:24 - you log into a site like Facebook for
00:26 - example you can visit different pages on
00:29 - that site and stay logged in we'll do
00:31 - something like that with PHP let's get
00:33 - started we have our index PHP file but
00:37 - let's create another our index page will
00:39 - be our login page
00:41 - then we'll create a PHP page named home
00:45 - home.php the idea is that once we log in
00:48 - with our index file we will be
00:51 - redirected to our home page so we have
00:53 - two PHP files Now to create a session
00:55 - before you display any HTML we will use
00:59 - the session start function within my PHP
01:02 - script I will type session
01:04 - start
01:06 - and that's how to start a session then
01:08 - after you start a session then you can
01:10 - add any HTML let's generate some HTML
01:15 - I'll add some text to our HTML page
01:18 - this is the login page
01:23 - then I'll add a hyperlink for the home
01:26 - page
01:27 - we'll use an a tag set the href
01:30 - attribute to equal home.php
01:34 - this goes to the home page then be sure
01:39 - to close it
01:42 - I'll add a break as well
01:45 - perfect after our HTML document let's
01:48 - add another PHP script
01:52 - we can create name value pairs within
01:55 - our session super Global variable
01:58 - let's create a key of username
02:01 - set this equal to a username of your
02:03 - choosing
02:06 - then let's do that with the password as
02:08 - well
02:08 - so we will access our session super
02:10 - Global variable
02:12 - we will create a key of password
02:16 - then make up some password
02:20 - for testing purposes let's Echo our
02:23 - username and our password
02:25 - Echo
02:26 - session
02:28 - we're accessing the key of username then
02:32 - we will be returned to the value
02:34 - then I'll add a break
02:37 - then do this with password as well
02:42 - let's see if this works
02:45 - okay here's my username here's my
02:47 - password they are stored within the
02:49 - session variable but we can access the
02:51 - values with a given key they're in key
02:53 - value pairs I would like these values to
02:56 - be accessible from another page from my
02:59 - home page
03:00 - for demonstration purposes I am going to
03:02 - Echo our username and our password
03:05 - from our home page
03:07 - but we need to create a PHP script so
03:09 - PHP
03:12 - then I will Echo our username and our
03:14 - password let's see what happens it's an
03:16 - experiment
03:18 - so I'm going to save everything
03:20 - on our index page we have our username
03:22 - and our password that works fine but if
03:24 - I were to go to our home page our second
03:26 - page
03:27 - well we don't have a username or a
03:29 - password
03:30 - undefined Global variable session
03:33 - within any additional files that we
03:35 - create we will also need to start a
03:37 - session with the session start function
03:39 - and I'll just copy this
03:41 - you'll need to do this before any HTML
03:43 - is displayed we'll start the session
03:46 - I'll create some HTML
03:50 - I'll copy these two lines
03:53 - but make a few changes to them
03:56 - okay this is the home page
04:01 - then I'll create a link to our index
04:03 - page
04:05 - this goes to the
04:07 - we'll call the login page
04:11 - let's reload this
04:13 - okay this is the home page this goes to
04:15 - the login page we do have our username
04:18 - and our password
04:19 - so I'm just switching between the home
04:21 - page and the login page
04:24 - we can access our session variable from
04:26 - either page as long as you start a
04:28 - session for some additional practice
04:31 - let's change our login page to actually
04:33 - reflect a login page we'll have a text
04:35 - box for both a username and a password
04:37 - and a login button so let's go to our
04:40 - index page so this is the login page
04:44 - let's change a few things around
04:48 - we'll create a form
04:54 - set the action attribute to equal
04:56 - index.php
04:59 - for the method since we're using
05:01 - credentials we should use post
05:04 - let's say username add a line break
05:08 - I guess that can be a label too
05:11 - we'll need a text box input type equals
05:14 - text
05:16 - for the name attribute let's set that to
05:18 - be username
05:21 - add a break
05:23 - let's copy these two lines of markup
05:26 - then paste them
05:29 - change the second username to be
05:31 - password
05:33 - also do that with the name attribute
05:36 - then we need a login button
05:39 - input type equals submit
05:43 - for the name this will be login
05:47 - or the value
05:48 - let's say that this is login as well
05:55 - then let's get rid of these lines
05:58 - I'm going to minimize this Explorer
05:59 - window just so we have more room to work
06:01 - with what we're going to do now is after
06:03 - somebody clicks the login button then
06:06 - we'll assign our session variable to
06:08 - check to see if somebody interacts with
06:10 - our login button we can use the is set
06:12 - function within an if statement if
06:15 - is set let me scroll down a little bit
06:19 - we are accessing our post variable
06:22 - at the Key of login
06:26 - if this button is interacted with if
06:28 - it's set we will assign our session
06:31 - variable
06:33 - we'll create a key of username
06:36 - we will assign whatever is within our
06:38 - text box for our username in a real
06:40 - world scenario I would probably use a
06:43 - filter but just for learning purposes
06:45 - I'm going to keep it simple and not use
06:47 - one maybe in a project we will I need to
06:50 - access our post variable
06:53 - at the Key of username
06:55 - whatever is in our text box we will
06:57 - assign to our session variable of
06:59 - username
07:01 - then do that with our password as well
07:07 - before we log in we have to check to see
07:09 - if our username and our password fields
07:10 - are empty we could write using an if
07:13 - statement
07:15 - if not empty function
07:18 - we are checking if our username is not
07:21 - empty
07:23 - and let's check to see if our password
07:27 - is not empty
07:30 - I'll put that down here
07:35 - if our username is not empty and our
07:38 - password is an empty then let's assign
07:41 - our session variables
07:45 - so for testing purposes let's Echo those
07:48 - values Echo
07:50 - the sessions username
07:52 - I'll add a break
07:56 - then do that with the password
08:02 - all right type in a username
08:04 - make up a password
08:06 - oop that should be a password Field hold
08:08 - on
08:10 - type equals password
08:17 - there we go here's our username here's
08:19 - our password if I were to refresh
08:21 - everything type in either a username or
08:24 - password we shouldn't display anything
08:26 - which is correct
08:28 - if one of these two fields are empty
08:30 - let's add an else clause
08:32 - else let's Echo
08:36 - missing username slash password one of
08:40 - those is missing
08:42 - then I'll add a break
08:45 - I'll type in a username but not a
08:47 - password
08:48 - missing username slash password
08:51 - let's type in a password but not a
08:53 - username
08:55 - missing username slash password
08:58 - let's type in both
09:04 - and that seems to work now let's get rid
09:06 - of these Echo statements we no longer
09:08 - need them we were using them for testing
09:10 - purposes what we're going to do now is
09:12 - after hitting the login button we will
09:14 - redirect our browser to our home page
09:18 - there's a function for that it is the
09:20 - header function
09:22 - we'll add that right here after we
09:24 - assign our username and password to jump
09:27 - to our home page within the header
09:29 - function and within quotes we will type
09:31 - location colon space then the name of
09:35 - the page home.php
09:38 - home dot PHP
09:41 - let's save everything
09:43 - make sure you're on your login page
09:46 - I will type a username and a password
09:50 - Press login and we are directed to our
09:53 - home page we are still maintaining that
09:55 - session we have our username and our
09:57 - password still
09:59 - let's create a log out button we'll do
10:01 - this within our home page
10:03 - let's get rid of our hyperlink
10:06 - we'll create a form that just has a
10:08 - button
10:12 - so the action attribute will be home.php
10:18 - or the method
10:20 - let's use post again
10:25 - I will add a button the input type will
10:27 - be submit
10:30 - for the name
10:32 - this will be log out
10:35 - for the value that will be log out as
10:37 - well
10:42 - we will use the is set function to see
10:44 - if our logout button is set
10:47 - so let's use an if statement
10:51 - if
10:52 - is set
10:54 - is our log out button set
10:58 - we will access post the key is log out
11:03 - if this button is set we will use the
11:06 - session destroy function
11:08 - we would like to end our session if
11:09 - we're logging out we will use the
11:12 - session
11:12 - destroy function
11:14 - to destroy the session
11:17 - after logging out let's go back to our
11:19 - login page the index file
11:22 - we will use the header function again
11:26 - set the location to be index.php
11:31 - I will log out and that should bring me
11:34 - back to my login page
11:35 - all right everybody that's how to create
11:37 - a session in PHP you can store
11:39 - information about a user that can be
11:41 - used across multiple pages and well
11:44 - everybody that is an introduction to
11:46 - sessions in PHP
