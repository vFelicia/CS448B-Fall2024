00:02 - hey uh what's going on everybody i
00:04 - thought in this video we could create a
00:06 - simple calculator program in c for
00:08 - practice let's begin by declaring all of
00:10 - the different variables that we'll need
00:12 - we'll need a character to store an
00:14 - operator
00:16 - so are we going to add subtract multiply
00:19 - or divide
00:21 - we'll need double num1
00:24 - double num2
00:26 - and double
00:28 - result
00:31 - let's ask the user what type of
00:33 - operation they would like to use
00:36 - enter an operator
00:41 - so we can use addition subtraction
00:44 - multiplication or division
00:46 - and we will use scanf to accept some
00:49 - user input if we're accepting a
00:52 - character the format specifier is c
00:55 - and we will use the address of operator
00:57 - the name of our variable we would like
00:59 - to store some user input into
01:02 - then let's accept num1
01:05 - enter
01:06 - number one
01:10 - then scanf the format specifier for a
01:13 - double
01:14 - is lf
01:18 - num1
01:19 - okay do the same thing with number two
01:24 - replace one with two
01:28 - then to examine our operator let's use a
01:30 - switch
01:32 - switch
01:34 - and we will examine our operator for any
01:36 - matching cases let's add a default case
01:39 - because i might forget to add this later
01:41 - so if a user does not enter in anything
01:43 - that has a matching case one of these
01:45 - four symbols
01:47 - let's print a message
01:49 - let's say that our operator is
01:52 - not valid
01:55 - our first case will be edition so case
01:59 - addition
02:02 - result
02:03 - equals num1 plus num2
02:06 - and let's display our result
02:11 - result
02:15 - and the format specifier for a double is
02:18 - lf
02:21 - and then at the end of your case you
02:22 - should break to break out of the switch
02:25 - then we can copy this
02:27 - paste it
02:28 - and then change any plus to minus
02:31 - then do the same thing with
02:33 - multiplication
02:36 - and lastly division
02:40 - and that is it so let's try this
02:43 - enter an operator i would like to add
02:46 - enter number one four point two zero
02:48 - plus
02:49 - 3.14
02:51 - that is 7.34
02:53 - and you can limit the amount of digits
02:55 - after the decimal that is displayed if
02:57 - you would like to adjust that with the
02:59 - format specifier with result type dot
03:02 - then the amount of digits you would like
03:04 - to display so i'm just going to go ahead
03:06 - and change that real quick
03:09 - okay so by adding 0.2 to our format
03:12 - specifier this will only display it two
03:15 - digits after the decimal but you can
03:17 - keep it the original way if you'd like
03:19 - okay let's subtract so minus
03:23 - 4.20
03:25 - minus 3.14
03:27 - is 1.06
03:30 - okay multiplication
03:32 - 3.14 times 4.20
03:36 - is 13.19
03:39 - and lastly division
03:41 - 3.14
03:43 - divided by 4.20
03:45 - is
03:46 - 0.75
03:48 - and we do have a default case if there
03:50 - are no matching cases
03:52 - let's type in a character besides one of
03:54 - these four symbols how about
03:57 - i don't know a dollar sign
03:59 - unfortunately we still need to enter
04:01 - into numbers and then this states our
04:04 - operator is not valid
04:06 - so yeah everybody that is a very simple
04:09 - calculator program in c
04:11 - if you would like a copy of all this
04:13 - code i'll post a copy in the comments
04:15 - section down below so this calculator
04:18 - can add subtract multiply and divide
04:20 - there are four cases but you can expand
04:23 - upon this if you'd like so yeah
04:25 - everybody that was a very simple
04:28 - calculator program in c
