00:01 - bro hope you're doing well in today's
00:03 - video i'm going to show you all how we
00:04 - can switch scenes using scene builder so
00:06 - sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:11 - if i could have just a moment of your
00:13 - time please like
00:14 - comment and subscribe i would greatly
00:17 - appreciate it
00:18 - hey all you cool cats in this video i'm
00:19 - going to show you all how we can switch
00:21 - scenes using scene builder the first
00:23 - thing that we'll need are
00:24 - two fxml files one for each scene as
00:26 - well as a
00:27 - scene controller so let's create two
00:29 - fxml files
00:30 - go to your application package right
00:32 - click go to
00:33 - new other new fxml document
00:37 - i'm going to name this scene one but
00:39 - feel free to call it whatever you want
00:41 - and i'll create a second fxml file right
00:44 - click again
00:45 - then go to new other new fxml document
00:49 - next and i will call this scene to
00:53 - finish and now we need a controller
00:55 - class right click again
00:57 - new class
01:00 - and i will name this let's say scene
01:03 - controller
01:04 - and that is it and finish now before we
01:07 - move on to filling in the scene
01:09 - controller class let's make sure that we
01:10 - have a few things filled out within our
01:12 - main java file
01:13 - we should have at least these four lines
01:15 - within the start method
01:16 - parent root equals fxml loader blah blah
01:19 - blah blah blah
01:20 - and then pass in the file name of the
01:22 - scene that you initially want to be
01:23 - displayed
01:24 - i would like scene 1 to initially be
01:26 - displayed so i will pass in
01:27 - that file name scene1.fxml
01:30 - scene scene equals new scene pass in the
01:33 - root node as an argument
01:35 - stage.set scene pass in the scene as an
01:38 - argument
01:38 - and lastly stage thought show and that
01:40 - should be good let's fill in our scene
01:42 - controller class now
01:43 - within our scene controller class let's
01:45 - declare a few things
01:46 - private stage stage
01:50 - private scene scene
01:54 - and lastly private
01:57 - parent root and be sure to get these
02:01 - imports as well
02:02 - make sure you're importing from javafx
02:04 - and not anyplace else
02:07 - and now we'll create two methods one
02:09 - named switch to scene one and the other
02:11 - switch to scene two
02:12 - these will be public void
02:15 - switch to scene one there is one
02:19 - parameter
02:20 - action event and let's say
02:23 - event okay make sure to get this import
02:27 - too
02:29 - copy this paste it
02:34 - and rename the second method as switch
02:36 - to scene two
02:37 - now there's four lines of code we need
02:39 - within each of these methods the first
02:40 - line of code
02:41 - is actually this line from our start
02:43 - method parent root
02:45 - equals fxml loader then all that jazz
02:47 - let's copy this
02:48 - paste it within switch to scene one now
02:51 - the second line of code is a little more
02:53 - complex
02:55 - oh then add throws declaration or
02:56 - surround with the try and catch block
02:58 - be sure to do that too all right the
03:00 - second line of code
03:01 - stage equals then within a set of
03:04 - parentheses we're going to
03:05 - get the source of this event and cast it
03:08 - to a node
03:10 - so that would be event dot
03:13 - get source then we will cast
03:16 - the source to a node
03:21 - then at the end we'll do some method
03:23 - training dot
03:24 - get scene dot
03:28 - get window
03:32 - then we need to take all of this and
03:34 - cast it to a stage
03:38 - looks like you'll need an import for
03:39 - node as well so hover your cursor over
03:41 - node
03:42 - and import node from javafx dot scene
03:45 - now the second line of code will be
03:47 - scene
03:49 - equals new scene
03:52 - and pass in your root node as an
03:54 - argument
03:56 - and lastly i guess there's five lines of
03:58 - code i lied stage
04:00 - dot set scene and we will add
04:04 - our scene and lastly
04:07 - stage dot show
04:11 - and we are good now let's copy all this
04:13 - paste it within switch to scene two
04:15 - and make a few changes
04:18 - add thrills declaration or surround with
04:20 - a try and catch block
04:22 - okay so for this line parent root equals
04:24 - fxml loader
04:25 - make sure that you're getting the
04:27 - resource of scene
04:28 - two and not scene one because within
04:30 - this method we're switching to scene two
04:32 - so we don't wanna switch back to scene
04:34 - one right all right and that should be
04:36 - good for our scene controller class
04:38 - let's open up scene builder and
04:40 - build some of these scenes let's begin
04:41 - with scene one so i'm going to right
04:43 - click on my
04:44 - fxml file then open with scene builder
04:48 - all right within scene builder we're
04:50 - working on scene1.fxml i'm going to
04:52 - delete this anchor pane that was
04:54 - generated for us and create a new one i
04:55 - will
04:56 - click anchor pane drag and drop it let's
04:58 - create a label and a button
05:00 - for labels and buttons go to controls
05:03 - and these are all in alphabetical order
05:05 - let's go to label drag and drop it i'll
05:07 - change the text to perhaps
05:10 - this is scene one
05:13 - i'll increase the font size too so go to
05:16 - font
05:17 - and let's change this to something large
05:20 - 50 would be good
05:21 - and i'll recenter and we'll create a
05:24 - button
05:25 - because we'll need a button to switch
05:27 - scenes i'll change the text
05:29 - let's say switch
05:32 - to scene 2
05:36 - and i'll increase the font as well 20
05:39 - would be good
05:42 - and center this okay now we need to add
05:45 - our controller class
05:47 - so under controller class you should
05:49 - have the name your package
05:51 - dot scene controller and we need to add
05:54 - an event
05:55 - to this button so click on your button
05:58 - go to
05:58 - code on action switch to
06:02 - scene two and let's save this
06:06 - you can go to file save or save as and
06:09 - let's open scene two now file
06:13 - open scene two
06:18 - okay let's delete this anchor pane
06:22 - same process as before really
06:25 - let's create a label
06:28 - there it is
06:32 - for the text let's change this to
06:37 - this is scene
06:40 - two let's increase the font size
06:43 - i think last time it was 50. let's
06:47 - recenter this
06:49 - we'll create a button
06:52 - drag and drop it i'll place it in the
06:54 - center
06:56 - and the text will be switch
07:00 - to scene one
07:03 - i think last time the font was 20
07:07 - recenter it
07:10 - add your controller class under
07:12 - controller class
07:14 - select the name your package dot scene
07:16 - controller
07:17 - click your button and then we need to
07:19 - add our action
07:21 - on action switch to scene one
07:24 - let's save this and close out of
07:28 - everything
07:30 - let's make sure that we update and save
07:32 - scene two fxml and scene one fxml
07:35 - because sometimes these don't like to
07:36 - update
07:37 - all right then we can run and test
07:39 - everything we are currently within scene
07:41 - one
07:41 - and if i were to click this button we'll
07:43 - switch to scene 2. boom boom
07:45 - boom boom boom all right people well
07:48 - that's how to switch scenes using scene
07:50 - builder
07:51 - if you would like a copy of all this
07:52 - code i will post all of this to the
07:54 - comment section down below
07:55 - but yeah that is how to switch scenes
07:57 - using scene builder
07:59 - hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you
08:02 - learned something new

set scene and we will add our scene and lastly stage dot show and we are good now let's copy all this paste it within switch to scene two and make a few changes add thrills declaration or surround with a try and catch block okay so for this line parent root equals fxml loader make sure that you're getting the resource of scene two and not scene one because within this method we're switching to scene two so we don't wanna switch back to scene one right all right and that should be good for our scene controller class let's open up scene builder and build some of these scenes let's begin with scene one so i'm going to right click on my fxml file then open with scene builder all right within scene builder we're working on scene1.fxml i'm going to delete this anchor pane that was generated

place it in the center and the text will be switch to scene one i think last time the font was 20 recenter it add your controller class under controller class select the name your package dot scene controller click your button and then we need to add our action on action switch to scene one let's save this and close out of everything let's make sure that we update and save scene two fxml and scene one fxml because sometimes these don't like to update all right then we can run and test everything we are currently within scene one and if i were to click this button we'll switch to scene 2. boom boom boom boom boom all right people well that's how to switch scenes using scene builder if you would like a copy of all this code i will post all of this to the comment section down below but yeah that is how to switch scenes using scene builder hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learned something new then help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment
