00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's bro
00:02 - hope you're doing well and in this video
00:04 - we're going to be writing files in
00:05 - python so
00:06 - sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:11 - if you wouldn't mind please like comment
00:13 - and subscribe
00:14 - one like equals one prayer for the
00:16 - youtube algorithm
00:18 - so to begin it's kind of similar to the
00:20 - last video on reading files
00:22 - with open within the open function list
00:25 - the file name or the file path so what
00:28 - do you want to call this file i will
00:30 - call this file test.txt
00:33 - now normally with the open function
00:35 - there is a mode
00:36 - and you can actually change that there's
00:38 - a second argument that you can pass in
00:40 - by default this is r for read but if you
00:43 - want to write a file this would be
00:45 - w so now we're going to write a file
00:48 - called
00:49 - test.txt so to finish with
00:52 - open as file what are we going to do
00:55 - file dot write and within the write
00:58 - function
00:59 - we can write some text so let's create
01:02 - a text variable and we will add a string
01:05 - so let's say text equals
01:10 - yo and if you need to go down to a new
01:13 - line
01:14 - be sure to use the new line character so
01:16 - after this new line character
01:18 - the text that comes after is going to be
01:20 - on the next line as if we're hitting
01:22 - enter
01:22 - so yo this is some
01:26 - text have
01:29 - a good one
01:33 - all right so after i run this program we
01:36 - should have a file
01:37 - a text file within our project folder
01:39 - that appears
01:41 - and it is right here and it says yo this
01:44 - is some text
01:45 - have a good one now this is in write
01:48 - mode
01:48 - if this text was something else it will
01:51 - actually
01:52 - overwrite your current file so if i were
01:54 - to change this to
01:56 - uh oh this text has
02:00 - been over written well then
02:03 - this will overwrite the text that we
02:06 - have
02:06 - uh oh this text has been overwritten so
02:09 - you can actually append a file by
02:11 - changing the mode
02:12 - to a for append so let me change this
02:15 - back
02:16 - we will rewrite this this will save over
02:18 - our current file
02:20 - now we can append some text so let's add
02:22 - maybe a new line
02:24 - uh have a nice
02:27 - day see ya so
02:30 - i would like to append some text to this
02:32 - file i'm going to change the mode
02:34 - to a for append and we can now append
02:37 - some text onto the end of this file well
02:40 - everybody that's how to write to a file
02:42 - and or append a file if you would like a
02:44 - copy of this code
02:45 - i will post this in the comment section
02:47 - down below but yeah that's how to write
02:50 - to
02:50 - and or append a file in python
