00:02 - all right everybody welcome back in this
00:04 - video i'm going to show you all how we
00:05 - can compile and run a c program using
00:08 - command prompt in my text editor i have
00:11 - a simple c program that prints i love
00:14 - pizza it's really good what we'll need
00:15 - to do is open command prompt now before
00:18 - we begin we should make sure that we
00:19 - have a gcc compiler and to check that
00:22 - just type gcc
00:24 - minus minus version
00:27 - and it looks like i have one so if
00:29 - you're missing a gcc compiler check the
00:31 - first video in the series and i'll show
00:33 - you how to download one now step one to
00:35 - compiling a c file is that we need to
00:37 - change our active working directory so
00:40 - that it's pointing to the folder
00:41 - containing our c file an easy way to
00:43 - change that is that we need the file
00:45 - location so i'm going to right click on
00:46 - my c file go to properties copy this
00:49 - location and within command prompt i
00:51 - will type cd to change directory and
00:54 - then paste that location so our current
00:56 - active directory is pointing to that
00:58 - folder containing our c file and to
01:00 - compile a c file you type
01:02 - gcc
01:04 - the name of the file
01:05 - and mine is hello world dot c then hit
01:09 - enter so nothing appears to happen and
01:11 - that's good so let's take a look at the
01:12 - c folder again this is the file that we
01:15 - compiled it is an executable and all we
01:17 - have to do is run that so that is the
01:19 - third step a dot e x e enter
01:23 - i love pizza it's really good so yeah
01:26 - that's how to compile and run a c file
01:29 - in command prompt first make sure that
01:31 - you have a gcc compiler that would be i
01:33 - guess step zero step one is to change
01:36 - the active working directory to the
01:38 - folder containing your c file compile
01:40 - the c file with gcc the name of the file
01:43 - and then run the compiled file a.exe so
01:46 - yeah that is how to compile and run a c
01:49 - file with command prompt if you found
01:51 - this video helpful please be sure to
