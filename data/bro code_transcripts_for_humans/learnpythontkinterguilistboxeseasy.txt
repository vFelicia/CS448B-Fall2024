00:00 - hey what's going on everybody it's you
00:01 - bro here hope you're doing well and in
00:03 - this video i'm going to teach you guys
00:04 - how we can create a list box in python
00:07 - so sit back relax and enjoy the show
00:12 - if you find this video helpful please
00:13 - remember to like
00:15 - comment and subscribe your support will
00:17 - help keep this channel running
00:19 - all right you wonderful people let's
00:21 - create a list box a
00:22 - list box is a listing of selectable text
00:25 - items within its own container
00:27 - so as always we'll need a window window
00:30 - equals tk
00:31 - followed by window dot main loop let's
00:34 - create a list box
00:35 - simply called list box big surprise
00:38 - there right
00:38 - so list box equals list box what are we
00:42 - adding this list box to
00:43 - we're going to place that here within
00:44 - the parentheses of the constructor
00:46 - we're adding this to our window and then
00:48 - we're going to follow this with
00:50 - listbox.pack you can also do
00:52 - listbox.place as well and place some
00:54 - coordinates but
00:55 - we've always done pack let's just stick
00:57 - with that for now all right so this is
00:59 - what our list box looks like
01:01 - it's a small rectangular box and we're
01:03 - going to add some text items that are
01:05 - selectable
01:06 - and eventually we'll be able to submit a
01:08 - choice so i have an idea
01:10 - let's create an online menu like we're
01:13 - ordering food from a restaurant
01:14 - let's say it's bros italian restaurant
01:17 - so let's add some food items to our menu
01:19 - and somebody can submit an order so
01:22 - we'll need to use
01:23 - the insert function of the list box to
01:25 - add some items
01:26 - so list box dot insert
01:29 - we place an index and a text item
01:32 - so let's say for index 1 we'll have
01:36 - pizza and this is what we end up with
01:39 - we have the item pizza it's selectable
01:42 - and
01:42 - well that's really it we'll need to
01:44 - create a submit button and populate the
01:46 - rest of this list box
01:47 - so let's add a few other items for our
01:49 - menu so let's say we'll have five items
01:52 - and we need an index for each so one two
01:56 - three four and five so we have
01:59 - pizza for the first item for the second
02:01 - item let's have pasta
02:03 - and third let's say garlic bread because
02:06 - garlic bread is awesome
02:08 - and restaurants usually have appetizers
02:10 - so why not
02:11 - soup and salad and that should be enough
02:14 - for this example
02:16 - and this is what we have we have our
02:19 - menu and we can select
02:20 - an item from this menu so let's
02:23 - customize the appearance of this menu
02:25 - well because we can so let's do that
02:28 - let's change the background color so we
02:29 - do that with the option
02:31 - bg for background and you can set this
02:33 - equal to a color of your choice or
02:36 - a hex value so i have a hex color value
02:39 - already picked out
02:40 - it is f7ffde and this has the appearance
02:44 - of i would say
02:45 - paper like it's kind of faded i think
02:47 - that would fit some sort of
02:49 - menu for a restaurant but pick whatever
02:51 - background color you want
02:53 - so let's change the font next so we can
02:56 - do that with the option font
02:59 - and i will pick the font
03:02 - constant it's somewhat fancy i think it
03:07 - would fit like a restaurant menu
03:08 - and then a size of 35.
03:12 - yeah we're getting somewhere we can also
03:15 - change the width
03:16 - and the height so width equals
03:20 - let's say 12. that's not too bad for a
03:24 - width
03:24 - let's also change the height so we can
03:26 - do that
03:27 - with a function of our list box
03:30 - so let's get the current size of the
03:32 - list box
03:33 - and let's actually do that after we
03:36 - insert all of the items within our list
03:38 - box
03:38 - so to change the size of our list box
03:41 - what we do
03:42 - is type in list box
03:45 - dot config you usually use config if you
03:48 - need to change any uh
03:49 - options and we want to change the
03:52 - length of or the height of this list box
03:56 - so we're going to say height equals
04:00 - listbox dot
04:04 - size function so then this will adjust
04:07 - the size
04:08 - of our list box dynamically even if we
04:11 - were to remove an item
04:13 - then the size of our list box is going
04:15 - to shrink
04:17 - just like that but let's keep salad in
04:20 - there for now because we need
04:21 - salad all right so how do we actually
04:25 - submit
04:26 - one of these options we'll need to
04:27 - create a submit button
04:29 - so let's do that after we create our
04:31 - list box so near the bottom
04:33 - we'll call this submit button
04:36 - submit button equals button we're adding
04:39 - this
04:39 - to our window let's set the text to
04:42 - submit
04:44 - and we'll need a command so we'll create
04:46 - a function called
04:48 - submit and then we need to pack
04:51 - this submit button
04:54 - submit button.pack now at the top of
04:57 - this program
04:58 - let's create a submit function
05:02 - so at the top def submit
05:06 - so to retrieve or get the current
05:10 - selected item of a list box there is a
05:12 - certain function that you can use
05:14 - so we'll begin by saying
05:18 - list box dot get
05:21 - what are we getting we want to get
05:22 - anything that is currently selected and
05:24 - there is a function
05:26 - for that so what we're going to do
05:28 - within the parentheses of the get
05:30 - function
05:31 - is type in listbox dot
05:35 - current it's shortened to
05:38 - cur selection all right and then we can
05:41 - either store this within a variable or
05:43 - we can just print this but i think we'll
05:45 - just print this to keep it simple
05:49 - now when we select an item and
05:52 - click on the submit button it's going to
05:54 - submit our order
05:55 - actually better yet let's actually uh
05:59 - print you have
06:02 - ordered whatever item that
06:08 - we select so garlic bread you have
06:10 - ordered garlic bread
06:12 - cool what we're going to work on now is
06:14 - a way to submit or
06:16 - insert an item to our list box after
06:19 - this program is compiled
06:21 - and already running so we'll create an
06:23 - entry box within
06:24 - our window where we can submit a custom
06:27 - item to this menu
06:28 - so let's create an entry box and let's
06:32 - do that before the submit button that
06:33 - would be a good spot for this
06:35 - so let's call this entry box where
06:37 - somebody can
06:38 - type in something to add to the menu so
06:41 - entry box equals entry and we're adding
06:44 - this
06:45 - to our window and then entry box
06:48 - dot pack then we're going to create a
06:52 - button
06:53 - called add and i'm just going to copy
06:55 - everything from the
06:56 - submit button and we'll change submit to
06:59 - add
07:00 - we're going to add an item to the menu
07:03 - so we'll change the text
07:04 - to add and command add
07:07 - add button dot pack then we're going to
07:11 - create
07:12 - a function called add and we'll do that
07:14 - at the top
07:15 - def add parentheses
07:18 - colon so to add an item to the list box
07:22 - first we need to get what is currently
07:24 - in the
07:24 - entry box so we can do that by
07:28 - typing in list box dot insert
07:33 - then within the parentheses we need to
07:35 - get an index number
07:38 - as well as a text item so
07:41 - for the number what we can type here is
07:43 - the listbox
07:44 - dot size so this will give us the
07:48 - current position
07:49 - of the index that we're currently on for
07:51 - the list box
07:52 - and then we need to get the text in the
07:55 - entry box so we type in the name of the
07:57 - entry box
07:58 - entry box dot get
08:02 - and this will insert a new item within
08:05 - our menu
08:05 - our list box so let's try it again
08:10 - so we can type in an item let's say soda
08:12 - we want to add soda to the menu
08:14 - and then we click add all right there's
08:17 - our soda but we have to scroll down to
08:19 - see it
08:20 - so let's change the size of our list box
08:24 - so there's actually a line of code that
08:26 - we did that already
08:27 - list box dot config height equals list
08:29 - box
08:30 - size so let's add that within the add
08:33 - function at the very end
08:35 - so then the height of our list box will
08:38 - adjust
08:39 - so currently there's no soda within our
08:40 - menu let's type in soda or some other
08:43 - item
08:44 - click add and then that item will appear
08:46 - and the size of the list box will change
08:48 - to accommodate any new items
08:50 - let's say now that we serve sushi we're
08:53 - now an italian
08:54 - and japanese restaurant now we have
08:57 - sushi on the menu
08:58 - you know what why stop there let's
09:00 - create a delete button to delete an item
09:02 - from this menu
09:04 - so we'll create a delete button
09:07 - i'll just copy everything for add and
09:09 - change this to
09:10 - delete so delete button text equals
09:13 - delete
09:14 - command equals delete as well and
09:18 - delete button dot pack and then at the
09:21 - very top
09:22 - we'll create a delete function so we'll
09:25 - do that here
09:26 - d e f delete
09:32 - and to delete an item from a list box
09:34 - there's actually a function to do that
09:35 - so
09:36 - listbox dot delete
09:39 - and then within the parenthesis of the
09:41 - delete function we can pass
09:43 - in list box dot current selection or
09:47 - just
09:47 - cur selection for short and then we want
09:50 - to readjust the height of this list box
09:53 - after we delete an item
09:55 - so we'll just add listbox.config height
09:58 - equals
09:59 - listbox dot size because the size of all
10:02 - the items within the list box is going
10:04 - to shrink after we delete an item
10:06 - so let's try this so here's our menu
10:09 - let's say we no longer want salad
10:11 - because salad is healthy
10:12 - well we can delete it same thing with
10:14 - soup and you know what let's also delete
10:17 - the pasta
10:18 - and the pizza so we're only left with
10:20 - sweet sweet garlic bread
10:22 - well ladies and gentlemen we're going to
10:23 - get into some more advanced stuff with
10:25 - list boxes
10:26 - what if you want to select more than one
10:28 - item from this list box
10:30 - we're going to need to change a few
10:31 - things so when we create our list box
10:34 - there is a select mode select mode
10:37 - and we are going to set this equal to
10:39 - multiple
10:40 - so now we can actually select multiple
10:43 - items
10:44 - from this list box like i want to select
10:46 - one of everything
10:47 - but what happens when we submit this
10:50 - well we're gonna run into some problems
10:51 - so we're going to need to change this
10:53 - program around
10:54 - so let's begin with the submit option
10:57 - so what we're going to do within the
10:58 - submit option is first
11:00 - get rid of this line let's say we no
11:03 - longer need this anymore
11:05 - and then before we print out the items
11:08 - that we ordered
11:10 - let's create a list called food
11:13 - and we'll just leave this empty for now
11:14 - we'll fill this later
11:16 - so we'll create a for loop for index
11:20 - in list box
11:23 - dot current selection
11:27 - what we're going to do after each
11:29 - iteration
11:31 - food dot insert
11:35 - our index number as well as
11:38 - list box dot get
11:42 - the item name at this index what this
11:45 - for loop is doing
11:46 - is that it's going to iterate once for
11:49 - each item that we select
11:51 - so since we have three items that are
11:53 - currently selected
11:54 - this is going to iterate three times get
11:56 - the index number as well as the item
11:58 - at that index number and now we just
12:00 - need to display the contents of what we
12:02 - have
12:03 - within our list of food so we can do
12:06 - that with another for loop so let's
12:08 - add that after you have ordered then
12:11 - for index
12:15 - in our list food
12:19 - all we'll do is print index
12:22 - so this will print out everything that
12:25 - we ordered
12:26 - so let's say that we want one of
12:28 - everything and submit this
12:29 - you have ordered pizza pasta garlic
12:32 - bread soup and salad
12:34 - now what happens if we try to delete
12:36 - multiple items
12:37 - so let's say we want to delete soup and
12:39 - salad and we click delete
12:41 - well we're going to run into an error
12:43 - because our function is not set up to
12:45 - accommodate for multiple items
12:47 - so we'll need to change a few things
12:48 - around so let's get rid of this line for
12:50 - now list box dot delete
12:52 - list box dot current selection and we're
12:54 - going to place a for loop here so for
12:57 - index in list box
13:01 - dot current selection then after each
13:04 - iteration
13:05 - what we're going to do is use
13:08 - listbox.delete
13:10 - and we're deleting the item at whatever
13:13 - index we're currently on
13:15 - so you would think this would work at
13:17 - first glance
13:18 - let's say we want to delete pizza and
13:20 - pasta we're going to click delete
13:22 - so pizza was deleted but not pasta
13:25 - that's because the indexes are changing
13:28 - after we delete an item
13:29 - so when we use this for loop we should
13:32 - actually reverse this
13:34 - so with listbox.currentselection we are
13:37 - going to enclose this with
13:39 - reversed so then we're going to start at
13:43 - the
13:44 - last index and work our way to zero in
13:46 - that order
13:48 - so now if we want to delete pizza and
13:50 - pasta
13:51 - i don't know why we would because
13:53 - they're amazing and we click
13:55 - delete it deletes pizza and pasta but we
13:58 - still have garlic bread soup and salad
14:00 - then we can add an item let's say we
14:02 - want to add sushi against the menu
14:04 - we can do that and then we can order one
14:06 - of everything because we're really
14:08 - hungry
14:09 - you have ordered garlic bread soup salad
14:11 - and sushi
14:12 - so that's the basics of creating a list
14:15 - box in python
14:16 - if you want a copy of all this code i'll
14:18 - post all of this in the comments down
14:19 - below
14:20 - but yeah that's the basics of list boxes
14:22 - in python
14:25 - hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you
14:27 - learn something new
14:29 - then you can help me help you in three
14:32 - easy steps
14:33 - by smashing that like button drop a
14:35 - comment down below
14:36 - and subscribe if you'd like to become a

hey what's going on everybody it's you bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can create a list box in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running all right you wonderful people let's create a list box a list box is a listing of selectable text items within its own container so as always we'll need a window window equals tk followed by window dot main loop let's create a list box simply called list box big surprise there right so list box equals list box what are we adding this list box to we're going to place that here within the parentheses of the constructor we're adding this to our window and then we're going to

size of our list box what we do is type in list box dot config you usually use config if you need to change any uh options and we want to change the length of or the height of this list box so we're going to say height equals listbox dot size function so then this will adjust the size of our list box dynamically even if we were to remove an item then the size of our list box is going to shrink just like that but let's keep salad in there for now because we need salad all right so how do we actually submit one of these options we'll need to create a submit button so let's do that after we

better yet let's actually uh print you have ordered whatever item that we select so garlic bread you have ordered garlic bread cool what we're going to work on now is a way to submit or insert an item to our list box after this program is compiled and already running so we'll create an entry box within our window where we can submit a custom item to this menu so let's create an entry box and let's

to our window and then entry box dot pack then we're going to create a button called add and i'm just going to copy everything from the submit button and we'll change submit to add we're going to add an item to the menu so we'll change the text to add and command add add button dot pack then we're going to create a function called add and we'll do that at the top def add parentheses colon so to add an item to the list box first we need to get what is currently in the entry box so we can do that by typing in list box dot insert then within the parentheses we need to get an index number as

get the text in the entry box so we type in the name of the entry box entry box dot get and this will insert a new item within our menu our list box so let's try it again so we can type in an item let's say soda we want to add soda to the menu and then we click add all right there's our soda but we have to scroll down to see it so let's change the size of our list box so there's actually a line of code that we did that already list box dot config height equals list box size so let's add that within the add function at the very end so then the height of our list box will adjust so currently there's no soda within our menu let's type in soda or some other item click add and then that item will appear and the size of the list box will change to accommodate any new items let's say now that we serve sushi we're now an italian and japanese restaurant now we have sushi on the menu you know what why stop there let's create a delete button to delete an item from this menu so we'll create a delete button i'll just copy everything for add and change this to delete so delete button text equals delete command equals delete as well and delete button dot pack and then at the very top we'll

ladies and gentlemen we're going to get into some more advanced stuff with list boxes what if you want to select more than one item from this list box we're going to need to change a few things so when we create our list box there is a select mode select mode and we are going to set this equal to multiple so now we can actually select multiple items from this list box like i want to select one of everything but what happens when we submit this well we're gonna run into some problems so we're going to need to change this program around so let's begin with the submit option so what we're going to do within the submit option is first get rid of this line let's say we no longer need this anymore and then before we print out the items that we ordered let's create a list called food and we'll just leave this empty for now we'll fill this later so we'll create a for loop for index in list box dot current selection what we're going to do after each iteration food dot insert our index number as well as list box dot get the item name at this index what this for loop is doing is that it's going to iterate once for each item that we select so since we have three items that are currently selected this is going to iterate three times get the index number as well as the item at that index number and now we just need to display the contents of what we have within our list of food so we can do that with another for loop so let's add that after you have ordered then for index in our list food all we'll do is print index so this will print out everything that we ordered so let's say that we want one of everything and submit this you have ordered pizza pasta garlic bread soup and salad now what happens if we try to delete multiple items so let's say we want to delete soup and salad and we click delete well we're going to run into an error because our function is not set up to accommodate for multiple items so we'll need to change a few things around so let's get rid of this line for now list box dot delete list box dot current selection and we're going to place a for loop here so for index in list box dot current selection then after each iteration what we're going to do is use listbox.delete and we're deleting the item at whatever index we're currently on so you would think this would work at first glance let's say we want to delete pizza and pasta we're going to click delete so pizza was deleted but not pasta that's because the indexes are changing after we delete an item so when we use this for loop we should actually reverse this so with listbox.currentselection we are going to enclose this with reversed so then we're going to start at the last index and work our way to zero in that order so now if we want to delete pizza and pasta i don't know why we would because they're amazing and we click delete it deletes pizza and pasta but we still have garlic bread soup and salad then we can add an item let's say we want to add sushi against the menu we can do that and then we can order one of everything because we're really hungry you have ordered garlic bread soup salad and sushi so that's the basics of creating a list box in python if you want a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of list boxes in python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro you
