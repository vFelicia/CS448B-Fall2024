00:00 - hey what's going on everybody so in
00:01 - today's video I'm going to show you a
00:03 - few ways in which we can format currency
00:05 - in JavaScript it involves this pretty
00:07 - sweet method the two local string method
00:10 - basically what this method does is that
00:11 - it returns a string with a language
00:14 - sensitive representation of a number
00:17 - depending on which country you're in you
00:18 - format numbers a different way for
00:20 - example I'm in the United States we
00:22 - separate every thousand's place with a
00:24 - comma then follow any decimal numbers on
00:26 - the right hand side however if you were
00:28 - in let's say Germany you would format it
00:31 - this way personally I have no idea how
00:33 - to read this number sorry Germany
00:35 - representing numbers to a foreign
00:37 - audience is fairly important because
00:39 - honestly if I saw this number it would
00:41 - confuse me now in today's video we're
00:43 - going to be covering the two local
00:45 - string method another way to format
00:47 - currency is with international number
00:49 - format but that's a little Advanced for
00:51 - us once you're at the intermediate or
00:53 - advanced level I would definitely take a
00:55 - look at international number format but
00:57 - that will be outside the scope of
00:58 - today's lesson the two local string
01:00 - method is a simple and beginner friendly
01:02 - way to format currency and other numbers
01:05 - so you have a number numbers have a
01:07 - built-in two local string method the
01:10 - first argument is a string
01:11 - representation of a location a local it
01:14 - specifies the language to use if you set
01:17 - this to be undefined you'll use the
01:19 - default set in the viewer's browser
01:21 - that's a good option for the second
01:23 - argument you can send an object an
01:26 - object of formatting options I'll give
01:29 - you an example
01:31 - let's say we have a number let number
01:34 - equal 1 2 3 4 5
01:37 - 6
01:40 - 789 to format this number I will take
01:43 - our number reassign it equal to number
01:47 - use the builtin to local string method
01:53 - we have two arguments a string location
01:56 - and an object let's start with the
01:58 - string location for a United States
02:01 - local that would be n for
02:04 - english-us Capital then we should
02:07 - display our number
02:09 - console.log
02:11 - number yep and there is United States
02:14 - formatting let's pass in a string local
02:17 - for
02:17 - India again following the same
02:21 - format we will change the location to be
02:25 - hi for Hindi Das I in based on that
02:30 - geographic location there's different
02:32 - number
02:33 - formatting let's cover
02:37 - Germany
02:38 - D- capital
02:41 - de to use the viewer's default set for
02:44 - the browser you're going to pass in
02:49 - undefined so I will pass in
02:52 - undefined for me personally that will
02:54 - give me the United States
02:56 - formatting now you can pass in options
02:59 - we can can take this number with this
03:00 - formatting and give it a unit of
03:05 - currency so again we're going to
03:07 - reassign our number number equals number
03:10 - use the built-in to local string method
03:15 - my location will be the United States
03:17 - feel free to pick a different one if you
03:19 - would like the second argument is going
03:21 - to be an object we need to set a curly
03:23 - braces to represent an object objects
03:26 - can have properties properties that hold
03:28 - values if you need currency you will set
03:31 - the style property you'll set the style
03:33 - property to have a string value of
03:36 - currency the next property would
03:39 - be
03:41 - currency colon I'm going to zoom out a
03:44 - little bit for United States dollars
03:46 - that would be USD and let's see what we
03:49 - have there we go we have American
03:53 - dollars with United States number
03:56 - formatting let's do this with Indian
03:58 - rupees so again number equals number to
04:04 - local
04:07 - string the local will be hi- I comma for
04:12 - the next argument we're passing in an
04:14 - object I'm going to zoom in
04:17 - again the style property will be
04:22 - currency We'll add another
04:24 - property this property will be currency
04:28 - colon space
04:31 - for rupes that would be I
04:34 - NR and here is our new number with
04:38 - different currency
04:39 - formatting okay then I think Germany
04:41 - uses
04:43 - zos number equals number to local
04:50 - string what's the location Germany that
04:53 - would be
04:55 - d-de Capital comma space the next
04:59 - argument is an
05:00 - object the style property will be
05:05 - currency the next property will be
05:11 - currency and the currency is going to be
05:14 - EU for
05:16 - euros and that has appeared to work all
05:20 - right everybody so that is a beginner
05:21 - friendly way in which you can format
05:23 - currency in
05:28 - JavaScript
