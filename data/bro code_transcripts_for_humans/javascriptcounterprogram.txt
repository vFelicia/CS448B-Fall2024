00:00 - hey what's going on everybody so in
00:02 - today's video we're going to create a
00:03 - counter program using JavaScript HTML
00:06 - and CSS so sit back relax and enjoy the
00:10 - show
00:11 - all right let's begin everybody so what
00:13 - we're going to do is start with our
00:16 - index.html file we'll add any necessary
00:19 - elements then we will style those
00:21 - elements with our CSS file then lastly
00:24 - we will add functionality via JavaScript
00:27 - so let's begin with our HTML file
00:30 - within the body of our document I will
00:34 - create a label to store the count
00:36 - so I will create a label
00:40 - with an ID
00:42 - of count
00:44 - label the text will be zero
00:48 - it's a little small but that's okay
00:50 - we'll increase the font size with CSS
00:53 - I'll add a break afterwards with the
00:56 - brake tag
00:57 - we'll need three buttons decrease reset
01:00 - and increase
01:04 - so we have button one
01:06 - let's copy this button paste it two
01:09 - additional times
01:11 - the ID for the first button will be
01:15 - decrease
01:17 - btn4 button
01:21 - the text will be decrease
01:27 - then for the second button the ID will
01:30 - be reset button
01:33 - the text will be reset
01:36 - then increase ID
01:40 - increase
01:41 - button
01:43 - the text will be increase
01:48 - what I'm also going to do is place our
01:50 - buttons within a div section
01:54 - let's cut our buttons
01:57 - then place the buttons within the div
02:01 - I will give the div a unique ID
02:05 - of button
02:07 - container
02:09 - we'll Center align our button container
02:11 - so it's in the middle of the window
02:13 - okay that is everything we need with our
02:15 - HTML file let's move to our CSS file
02:19 - let's style the account label it's a
02:22 - little small right now
02:23 - I will select the ID
02:26 - count label
02:31 - I will display the label
02:33 - as a block level element
02:37 - I will text align Center so it's in the
02:40 - center of our screen
02:43 - let's increase the font size
02:47 - I tend to like to use the EM unit of
02:50 - measurement
02:51 - the text will be 10 times the size
02:55 - then let's change the font family
02:58 - pick a font of your choosing for this
03:00 - example I'll use helvetica
03:08 - let's Center the button container that
03:11 - should surround all three buttons
03:13 - as you can see here
03:16 - the ID was button
03:19 - container
03:22 - text align Center
03:27 - okay the buttons should be in the middle
03:31 - one thing I forgot to do let's actually
03:33 - add a class to our buttons too
03:36 - class equals
03:40 - buttons
03:45 - there
03:47 - all right we will select the buttons
03:49 - class
03:51 - I'll add some padding
03:54 - padding 10 pixels and 20 pixels
04:01 - let's increase the font size font size
04:03 - 1.5 em
04:06 - that translates to 150 percent
04:10 - let's pick a font color
04:12 - I'll just pick White
04:15 - then a background color for the buttons
04:17 - background Dash color
04:20 - I'll use hsl values
04:27 - how's that
04:28 - not feeling it
04:31 - that's pretty good
04:36 - let's round the corners with border
04:38 - radius
04:40 - 5 pixels
04:44 - I'll change the cursor into a pointer
04:46 - when we hover over a button
04:49 - cursor
04:51 - pointer
04:54 - then we'll add a transition animation
05:00 - transition
05:03 - background
05:06 - Dash color
05:07 - after 0.25 seconds
05:11 - then we'll apply the hover pseudo class
05:13 - when we hover over one of the buttons
05:16 - take our buttons class
05:19 - use the hoverseudo class
05:22 - we will change the background color
05:25 - after a quarter of a second then change
05:28 - the background color to something
05:30 - slightly darker
05:38 - yeah that looks good
05:40 - there should be a delay when you hover
05:42 - over one of the buttons
05:44 - our HTML file is done same with our CSS
05:46 - now we need to add functionality because
05:49 - well these buttons don't do anything
05:51 - I will individually assign all of these
05:54 - buttons so that each is stored within a
05:56 - constant
05:58 - so const
06:01 - decrease
06:02 - button
06:03 - equals then we need to select each
06:06 - button by accessing our document dot get
06:09 - element by ID
06:13 - what's the id we're selecting we will
06:15 - begin with our decrease button
06:21 - all right
06:22 - then we need our reset button
06:26 - reset button the ID is reset button
06:31 - then increase button
06:35 - increase button
06:37 - the ID is increase button
06:42 - we need our count label
06:45 - okay then we will set const
06:49 - count label
06:52 - equals then we need to get the ID of our
06:54 - count label
06:57 - so
06:58 - document.getelementbyid count label
07:05 - then we will use let count
07:09 - equals zero
07:12 - we'll be reassigning count we'll be
07:15 - incrementing and decrementing count with
07:17 - our HTML elements we do not plan on
07:20 - reassigning them so we can set them as
07:22 - constants
07:23 - now we need a few functions three
07:25 - functions
07:26 - one for each of these buttons decrease
07:28 - reset increase let's begin with increase
07:33 - so we are taking our increase button
07:35 - that we assigned
07:37 - with the on click attribute of this
07:40 - button set the SQL to a function
07:44 - What's it gonna do when we want to
07:46 - increase this value of our count label
07:49 - let's increment count by one count plus
07:52 - plus
07:54 - then we will set the text content of our
07:56 - label
07:58 - count label dot text
08:01 - content equals whatever the count
08:04 - currently is let's see if this works
08:09 - it looks like I misspelled on click
08:12 - all right let's see if this works
08:15 - yep every time we press the button our
08:17 - counter label increases by one
08:20 - okay let's work on decrease
08:22 - really we can just copy this function
08:26 - paste it let's change increase to
08:28 - decrease
08:31 - count minus minus
08:34 - save everything
08:37 - and we should be able to increase and
08:39 - decrease
08:41 - then the reset button
08:43 - let's copy one of these functions
08:46 - change decrease button to reset button
08:50 - when we want to reset we will set count
08:53 - back to zero
08:54 - then update our account label with the
08:57 - current count which should be zero
08:59 - we can increase
09:01 - we can decrease and we can reset
09:04 - then increase and decrease again
09:07 - all right everybody so that is a counter
09:09 - program with JavaScript HTML and CSS
