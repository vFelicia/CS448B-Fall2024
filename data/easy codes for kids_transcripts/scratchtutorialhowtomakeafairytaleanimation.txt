00:00 - I love to make animations in scratch it
00:05 - is so much fun
00:07 - and it's so easy once you get down a
00:10 - couple of main steps so let's take the
00:14 - classic fairy tale Hansel and Gretel and
00:18 - let's put our own little spin on this
00:22 - fantastic tale we'll write our own
00:25 - version and in our own version there's
00:28 - only going to be Gretel just going to be
00:34 - her mom in this version her mom actually
00:40 - might be trying to tell her something
00:43 - and create some values in her instead of
00:48 - just trying to get rid of her because
00:49 - they're so poor as in the original fairy
00:53 - tale version welcome to my modern day
00:57 - play based on the fairy tale Hansel and
01:00 - Gretel
01:01 - I'm Gretel my mom sat me down to chat
01:06 - about not doing my homework and chores
01:09 - because while she worked I just played
01:13 - on my phone one day my mom decided to
01:18 - test my skills we headed to camp on your
01:22 - own in the middle of the park to test my
01:25 - survival skills I had heard rumors that
01:28 - there was a witch deep in the woods here
01:31 - but who believes in witches anymore it
01:36 - didn't take me long to see that finding
01:38 - food and shelter was a big deal I missed
01:43 - my mom and my home and the meals she
01:47 - gave to me even the veggies I started
01:52 - wandering around and fell asleep as soon
01:55 - as it became night in the morning I was
01:59 - lost cold and so hungry I started
02:04 - looking for a house
02:06 - anyhow at all when I saw a house made of
02:10 - candy I had been warned to never go near
02:15 - strangers but I didn't listen to my mom
02:19 - and soon found myself trapped inside of
02:23 - a witch's kitchen she magically locked
02:26 - all the doors and said she was going to
02:29 - cook me for dinner I outsmarted her
02:33 - though by pretending I didn't know how
02:36 - to use wood and fire to cook Oh mrs.
02:41 - witch
02:42 - I don't know how to use fire and wood to
02:46 - cook things hello I use a microwave he
02:52 - started laughing at me with a very
02:55 - familiar laugh I looked at her and took
02:59 - off her big wig and glasses and it was
03:03 - my mom he told me how to light the open
03:07 - fire and we made delicious veggie
03:10 - burgers and ate ice cream and then went
03:13 - for a wonderful evening stroll I loved
03:17 - every minute of spending time with her
03:20 - we decided that we would go camping
03:23 - together more often and that when we got
03:26 - home I would do my homework and
03:28 - cheerfully do my chores
03:31 - sometimes the end I hope you loved this
03:35 - version of Hansel and Gretel and write
03:38 - your own
03:47 - you
03:55 - hello okay so this is part 2 of how to
03:59 - make an animation with scratch so the
04:02 - first thing that I did with this I love
04:06 - to create assignments using fairytales
04:09 - because you can go a million different
04:11 - directions with them so for this
04:14 - assignment we are going to follow along
04:19 - with Hansel and Gretel and that's going
04:21 - to be the overall fairy tale theme but
04:23 - we are actually going to create an
04:25 - adaptive fairy tale where we are going
04:27 - to tell our story that we've
04:29 - brainstormed and the script that we've
04:32 - written and we're going to use scratch
04:35 - to make a character and different
04:39 - backgrounds and then step our character
04:42 - through our version of Hansel and Gretel
04:44 - so the first thing that I did was say
04:48 - you know I love the classic fairy tale
04:50 - Hansel and Gretel and now let's go ahead
04:53 - and write our own version open scratch
04:56 - and then I'm giving the project link of
05:01 - my scratch project of this of my version
05:05 - of Hansel and Gretel right here and I
05:07 - will make sure that it's in the
05:08 - description as well so the characters in
05:12 - our modern version include Gretel and
05:15 - her mother that's it
05:17 - only Gretel is shown the backgrounds
05:20 - include one white background a living
05:24 - room background which is gradalls living
05:26 - room a forest background a witch's house
05:29 - and the last scene is a party room so
05:32 - there are five different backgrounds I
05:34 - have a challenge in here to go ahead and
05:37 - draw your own version of the witch's
05:39 - house and what you believe
05:40 - Gretel looks like so I went ahead and
05:44 - did it myself
05:45 - and then I have a house for the kiddos
05:49 - to color and then I have Gretel for the
05:53 - kiddos to color and they can also import
05:55 - these into scratch if they want to or
05:57 - they can use them as they can just look
05:59 - at them just just for fun so what I did
06:03 - was I brainstormed out a script before I
06:07 - started anything
06:08 - and changing around how Gretel would
06:11 - actually move through the story and move
06:15 - through the backgrounds I decided that I
06:17 - would record her talking and then also
06:21 - record the words on screen and now I've
06:24 - gone ahead and here's this script and
06:28 - then I have every single scene and the
06:31 - code that I've used for each scene so
06:35 - this should be a good guide once you
06:39 - read this and once you see how I'm doing
06:40 - every single scene with when clicked
06:45 - play sounds which background plays sound
06:47 - and how I've recorded everything that
06:50 - you should be able to do this with any
06:53 - adaptive fairytale so I have five
06:56 - different scenes one for each background
06:59 - that's how I decided to break up my
07:00 - animation then I wrote everything down
07:03 - the script that I have beforehand and
07:06 - that's those are all my seis and then I
07:09 - recorded myself going ahead and reading
07:13 - my script and I only read one piece or
07:17 - one line of the script per little tiny
07:21 - bit per se so I didn't feel like I was
07:24 - rushed and I didn't feel like I had to
07:27 - read something really big where I was
07:30 - gonna like flub the lines or get really
07:33 - overwhelmed by it so basically all it is
07:36 - is just a wait and then play the be
07:40 - recorded sentence or two sentences and
07:43 - then this day and attach the say to it
07:47 - for a couple of seconds and then another
07:50 - wait and then play the sound and that's
07:52 - the exact I heard rumors I heard rumors
07:54 - these are the exact same things so she's
07:57 - saying them out loud and the kiddos he
08:01 - rehearsed hear her talking and then they
08:03 - can also read her words and those are
08:05 - those days so basically the code is a
08:09 - lot of weights and playing sounds and
08:12 - then saying the words which means typing
08:14 - the words on screen and then you go
08:17 - through the different backgrounds and
08:19 - that's how I broke it up she
08:22 - days she stays still I don't have her
08:24 - walking around and I don't have her
08:25 - conversing with anybody else I wanted
08:28 - the emphasis to be on the different
08:30 - types of seams so this gives you a
08:34 - behind-the-scenes tour of how I created
08:37 - this animation in scratch and I am going
08:40 - to download this and I will create a PDF
08:44 - if you would like to have the PDF you
08:47 - can just go ahead and email me and I
08:49 - will email you the PDF okay
