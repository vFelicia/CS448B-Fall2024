00:41 - alike

00:45 - favorite cyborg armed badger

01:01 - cut out meow meow do you see the
01:04 - comparison
01:06 - come on cut out mel mel you know you see
01:08 - it
01:09 - okay let's go watch some eyes glowing
01:11 - and then
01:12 - let's check out how we can make glowing
01:14 - eyes in scratch
01:16 - fabulous
01:19 - so here we see the code that i used
01:22 - for making mao mao's eyes follow
01:26 - a mouse pointer and thereby glow
01:30 - this would be a very simple effect
01:34 - to capture in a screen capture that you
01:37 - could
01:38 - make his eyes look like laser beams or
01:42 - look really powerful as they're glaring
01:44 - at his opponent
01:45 - or cut across the screen really quickly
01:49 - as if he is like throwing blasts from
01:53 - them
01:54 - your imagination can do a thousand
01:57 - different things with this
01:58 - really cool ghost effect and that's all
02:00 - it is i'm just repeating a ghost effect
02:04 - and then i am deleting the clone
02:07 - so it does not slow down the animation
02:11 - and let's go ahead and check out some
02:13 - more effects
02:16 - let's go to our color effect oh i love
02:19 - this
02:20 - look at all those fantastic colors and
02:23 - we're just
02:24 - changing within a radius of 10 so
02:27 - if you want to change that effect by 20
02:30 - i'm assuming you'll get
02:31 - all the colors in the rainbow i hope
02:34 - somebody checks that out i think one of
02:35 - my students did that
02:37 - and got all the colors all right let's
02:39 - change it to
02:40 - fisheye which just sort of elongates it
02:44 - um and makes it like clump
02:47 - which is really cool i like that
02:54 - let's change it to this little swirly
02:57 - whirl swirl
03:01 - look at that this is lots of fun just to
03:04 - like play with this is super fun i want
03:05 - to change the shape too let's do
03:07 - pixelate which is always going to be
03:09 - these fun little boxes
03:11 - a pixel is just a little square in and
03:13 - of itself so
03:14 - going all around with the pixelation
03:16 - let's change it to
03:19 - oh mosaic look at these tiny little
03:21 - boxes i love this
03:23 - it's so much fun this is one of my
03:25 - students favorites
03:27 - everybody loves the pixelate and if you
03:30 - can combine the color in the pixelate
03:32 - that's super fun
03:34 - and this is brightness so you can see
03:37 - it's changing all of those different
03:39 - shades of that green
03:41 - which is nice and then finally back to
03:45 - ghost
03:45 - which is what i used to create sort of
03:47 - like the laser beams coming out of his
03:48 - eyes
03:50 - fabulous
03:57 - and thank you so much to our amazing
04:00 - content creators and actors
