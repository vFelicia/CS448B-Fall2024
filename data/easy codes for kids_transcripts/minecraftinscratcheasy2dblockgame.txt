00:00 - this is what we're making today
00:03 - ah look at him go he's
00:06 - fabulous okay let's do it
00:09 - okay let's go ahead and create this
00:11 - really fun minecraft
00:12 - blocks game in scratch so the first
00:15 - thing that i want to do
00:16 - is create a really good block
00:20 - for us to use i'm going to use canva to
00:23 - do this
00:24 - you can do this right inside of scratch
00:26 - but canva is free and i always encourage
00:29 - my students to use it
00:30 - so i just opened up canva.com
00:34 - and typed in box just on one of its
00:38 - little white templates you don't have to
00:40 - have any particular size
00:42 - then in the search i typed in grass
00:45 - and i turned the box a nice deep brown
00:48 - color
00:49 - so this is the little box uh block that
00:53 - we're going to be
00:53 - using in our little minecraft game today
00:58 - so isn't it cute now i'm going to type
01:00 - in rock
01:01 - and there's a cool rock right there i
01:03 - like it but i don't like the color
01:05 - so at the top left i'm going to go ahead
01:08 - and edit the colors
01:09 - there are four shades of gray and
01:11 - they're i'm just going to turn them
01:12 - different shades of brown
01:15 - and that looks really cute and then i
01:18 - get rid of that guy
01:19 - and then copy paste so
01:22 - one block has two like little rocks in
01:26 - it
01:27 - and some grass on top if i can get this
01:30 - to copy and paste
01:34 - there we go and i'm gonna save that
01:41 - and i'm going to download it from canva
01:45 - as a png and it's free to download
01:50 - and you can build anything you want in
01:52 - canva then i'm going to add it to my
01:53 - photos
01:56 - and now i'm going to go ahead and open
01:57 - scratch and i go to
01:59 - upload sprite and photo library
02:03 - and there it be awesome
02:07 - and so i import it
02:10 - and this is going to be our terrain and
02:13 - then we're going to have
02:15 - another costume called soil and that's
02:17 - just going to be the exact same thing
02:18 - without grass on it
02:20 - all right now let's go ahead and draw
02:21 - steve he's just our little minecraft
02:24 - dude
02:25 - so let's start out with a nice little
02:27 - aqua color
02:28 - and let's do a box for his chest
02:31 - then let's do two brownish colored um
02:35 - blocks for his arms and i'm going to put
02:38 - them right in the middle
02:40 - of my block for his chest
02:43 - for his shirt and i sort of made a
02:46 - rectangle then copy and paste and put
02:48 - one
02:49 - on the right and left sides and that's
02:51 - just going to be a simple
02:52 - little symbol for his arms then i made
02:56 - a fourth block and that's going to be
02:58 - his a block for his legs
03:00 - and i turned that like an electric blue
03:02 - now i just copied and paste
03:04 - from his arms and then make a bigger
03:07 - block for his head
03:09 - and i'll zoom in here and
03:12 - i make just a nice little rectangle of
03:15 - black
03:16 - for his um hair
03:19 - and then i will make two
03:23 - block eyes so i just did one then copy
03:26 - and pasted
03:27 - the other to the other side
03:29 - [Music]
03:30 - and i just did a straight line for his
03:33 - mouth
03:35 - and then i'll do copy and paste and
03:38 - turn um a little or block
03:41 - white so it just gives him a little bit
03:44 - of dimension
03:44 - that he's like really alive
03:49 - there we go oh he's looking more human
03:51 - and human-esque as we go
03:54 - awesome oh i like steve
03:58 - he's very fantastic he's not quite the
04:01 - right size but we will fix
04:02 - the size all right let me make his i
04:04 - selected his mouth and made it size five
04:07 - just so we can see it a little bit
04:08 - better all right now let's go ahead and
04:10 - make
04:11 - two costumes for our terrain
04:14 - so one is the one that we just
04:16 - downloaded from canva
04:18 - with the pretty grass and the blocks and
04:21 - we're going to duplicate that
04:24 - and we are going to call this first one
04:28 - with the grass
04:29 - terrain and so we duplicate it
04:33 - and then we are in our bitmap
04:38 - um so not vector and i just went ahead
04:41 - and grabbed
04:42 - a square of that brown and i'm going to
04:45 - go ahead
04:46 - and plop it right over the grass so we
04:48 - keep it the same
04:49 - size and now this is going to be called
04:53 - soil so we have terrain with the grass
04:56 - and soil
04:57 - with just brown and so we have two
05:00 - different costumes that we can go
05:02 - between
05:03 - and so if you want to add on to this
05:04 - game and make inventory like in a
05:06 - creative mode
05:07 - for minecraft you can make both costumes
05:10 - about 198x171
05:14 - now let's go ahead and make more
05:15 - costumes for our steve's because steve
05:17 - is going to be
05:18 - moving moving moving moving
05:24 - okay so there is steve
05:28 - and
05:33 - i want to make him a little bit smaller
05:37 - because so i go ahead and and select
05:40 - all of him then i make steve about 34 by
05:44 - 16
05:46 - and i do that just so he can move along
05:48 - our game
05:50 - quickly you don't want the only thing
05:54 - with
05:54 - scratches that it can lag so if we do
05:57 - ten
05:58 - too many blocks at a time it will start
06:01 - um just not working so we want to
06:05 - keep these um pictures a little bit
06:08 - smaller
06:08 - so steve is 34 by 16.
06:12 - hi steve bye steve okay
06:15 - let's do um we're gonna go ahead and do
06:18 - five duplicates of steve
06:20 - so this is duplicate number one and this
06:22 - is gonna be costume
06:24 - up so just take his little arms
06:27 - and flip them up so he's just pointing
06:30 - up
06:32 - so this is costume up
06:37 - all right costume down i think we can
06:39 - just go ahead and move his arms to the
06:41 - side a little bit
06:42 - and that'll be it for costume down
06:45 - costume right let's go ahead and move
06:47 - his arms to the right hand side of our
06:49 - screen
06:50 - and angle them costume left
06:54 - let's go ahead and do the same thing
06:55 - with costume left let's angle his arms
06:57 - to the left
07:02 - so when he's moving we're going to call
07:04 - upon these costumes
07:05 - and we'll see his arms moving to that
07:07 - side and it just looks
07:09 - a little bit more fun oh i'm having
07:11 - trouble getting this over to the left a
07:13 - little bit
07:14 - and um it just gives an indication of
07:16 - the direction that we're going in
07:18 - since he's just sort of a block his arms
07:21 - sort of give us more of a
07:23 - directional sense then okay i think i
07:26 - i think i like that oh move both of them
07:28 - over here come on
07:32 - and you can see him right there on top
07:33 - of the blocks
07:36 - and he's starting to be a little bit
07:37 - okay let's go ahead and do
07:39 - one more and let's call this costume
07:41 - start
07:43 - and so he can just be in the costume
07:45 - down position
07:46 - but let's make his mouth an oval or a
07:49 - circle
07:51 - okay so up down
07:57 - right left and start
08:01 - up down right
08:05 - left cool
08:10 - okay cool okay now you know what i
08:13 - noticed
08:14 - is um you're gonna see when we do this
08:16 - code
08:17 - let's go ahead and for left let's put
08:19 - his arms in an open pac-man face to the
08:22 - right
08:22 - and you'll see when we go ahead and make
08:24 - the code all right terrain code we'll
08:26 - talk about that in a minute
08:27 - let's go ahead and go to our code blocks
08:29 - for our terrain
08:30 - so when green flag is clicked
08:36 - set size to 25 percent
08:41 - [Music]
08:44 - then let's switch the costume to terrain
08:55 - then let's go to x 215
09:00 - by y negative 65.
09:05 - oh that's much better
09:09 - okay if we play around we can press play
09:11 - anytime we want okay
09:13 - let's go ahead and get a repeat 10 times
09:19 - and create clone of myself
09:27 - so we're going to get this terrain
09:29 - looking really fun
09:31 - and then we're going to erase it change
09:33 - x by 10.
09:38 - and let's do change x by 49 instead of
09:41 - 10.
09:46 - and then go to 215 by
09:52 - let's take negative 215
09:56 - where is it oh i did negative 210 by
10:00 - negative
10:01 - 100 and we might play around with that
10:04 - as i press play
10:06 - as i press the green flag so that's down
10:09 - a little bit too far
10:11 - oh i know what i did okay we're gonna
10:14 - have to play with these numbers a little
10:16 - bit
10:24 - okay let's go ahead and do negative 215
10:32 - okay so let's do negative 215 by
10:35 - negative 100
10:39 - i'm sorry negative 225 by negative 100
10:42 - that's still not right but that's okay
10:47 - i'm going to keep playing with this
10:53 - let's go back to 215 negative 215.
10:57 - and then let's move on let's go to
10:59 - switch costume to soil
11:01 - and just regular i'm sorry switch
11:03 - costume to regular soil
11:06 - so there's somehow a soil too in there
11:07 - you can just ignore that
11:12 - and then grab our repeat again so repeat
11:14 - by 10
11:17 - and this is just going to make our soil
11:20 - go in nice little blocks underneath
11:23 - steve
11:24 - create clone of myself
11:36 - um we're gonna do create clone of myself
11:39 - change
11:39 - by x by 49 again
11:43 - paste those right into our repeat we're
11:45 - almost done
11:48 - then tell our blocks where to go again
11:52 - so negative
11:55 - 215 by
11:59 - this one's a little larger negative 140.
12:03 - okay that's still not quite lining up
12:05 - the way i want it to
12:07 - so i think i have to adjust the very
12:10 - first one
12:11 - but we'll do that in a minute all right
12:12 - let's add another repeat block
12:15 - so repeat 10 times
12:19 - [Music]
12:20 - and create a clone of myself
12:27 - change x by 49
12:34 - and let's create another row x
12:38 - go to
12:46 - 215
12:50 - and 155 okay
12:53 - looking good just have to fix that first
12:56 - row
12:58 - and we can play along with these numbers
13:00 - and you can play around with them
13:02 - depending upon how big your block is
13:06 - so you can do really big blocks you can
13:08 - do really small ones all right let's go
13:09 - ahead and fix that very first one
13:11 - i think i know which one is wrong let's
13:13 - do negative 2
13:17 - to 12. so instead of positive i think i
13:21 - forgot a little negative there we go
13:23 - okay now the blocks are lining up nicely
13:25 - under steve
13:26 - now we just have to tell him so we're
13:29 - still in the terrain code
13:31 - and it's looking really good
13:36 - and we have to tell our code
13:39 - what's going to happen with this terrain
13:41 - as we move
13:42 - our steve around we want it to disappear
13:47 - just like it does in minecraft and then
13:48 - we want to recreate it
13:50 - so we need to do some more coding to do
13:52 - that
13:54 - all right so when i receive broadcast
13:58 - disappear ooh can you can you guess
14:00 - what's gonna happen
14:04 - something's going to disappear if then
14:08 - and dragging my touch um
14:13 - when it touches the soil
14:17 - then
14:24 - okay actually when i touch steve then
14:27 - delete this
14:28 - clone so when steve touches the soil
14:31 - it's gonna go bye-bye
14:33 - and then when green flagged is clicked
14:36 - let's do a forever code
14:39 - okay um when green flag is clicked let's
14:41 - do a forever loop
14:42 - then an if then and then when the
14:46 - um f key is pressed
14:49 - we are actually going to create more
14:52 - blocks
14:53 - so go to steve
14:57 - so everything that steve touches will
15:00 - then
15:00 - create a terrain block fabulous
15:04 - and then we can um go ahead and switch
15:05 - between terrain and soil
15:07 - so go ahead and clone of myself
15:12 - save i'm i always save your project you
15:14 - don't want to
15:15 - end up with doing a whole lot of work
15:17 - and you didn't save it
15:18 - now go to 215 and why by 155.
15:24 - oh looky looky let's hit play
15:31 - and those blocks are lining up nicely
15:37 - and let's just do one more thing
15:41 - let's grab when the sprite is clicked so
15:43 - when we click that terrain block
15:44 - let's just do next costume so it will go
15:47 - to soil
15:48 - so some will have grass and some will
15:50 - just be dirt
15:51 - all right let's hit steve's code now
15:56 - [Music]
15:59 - okay so go to steve and in his code
16:03 - window
16:05 - drag over when green flag is clicked
16:12 - forever loop forever and ever
16:16 - and if then statement
16:20 - and key pressed
16:23 - let's do
16:26 - [Music]
16:33 - all right let's leave it space uh key
16:36 - and let's do broadcast disappear
16:38 - okay so let's try it out here
16:43 - i don't know if anything's gonna happen
16:46 - all right
16:47 - when green flag is clicked
16:53 - let's tell him where to go
16:56 - go to negative
17:01 - 215 by y
17:05 - negative 70.
17:10 - and then point in direction 90
17:14 - and then switch costume to costume start
17:17 - yay okay now let's put a forever loop
17:30 - and if then
17:33 - move up so we can see what we're doing
17:38 - go to our sensing and what are we going
17:42 - to do now
17:43 - key i think i'm gonna do my arrows
17:47 - some people like to use different
17:49 - letters i i like to use the up
17:51 - down right and left on my keyboard i
17:53 - don't know about you what do you like to
17:54 - use
17:55 - all right so um key up arrow switch
17:59 - costume two you guessed it
18:02 - costume up costume up costume up
18:06 - why am i waiting
18:09 - okay costume my um code is lagging a
18:12 - little bit
18:13 - i don't know if it's my connection or
18:16 - i've just
18:16 - started to make a lot of blocks okay
18:19 - point in direction
18:23 - so up is
18:32 - zero not negative 15. it is zero up is
18:35 - zero
18:38 - and for up remember our little costume
18:39 - is his is steve with his arms raised
18:43 - so when we press the up arrow steve goes
18:45 - up with his arms raised and hopefully
18:47 - we'll be able to see that very clearly
18:49 - and move ten steps so it's not just a
18:52 - little up
18:53 - it's a big up with ten steps
18:58 - okay let's move up a little bit let's
19:00 - duplicate that um
19:02 - that if then block not the forever block
19:04 - let me get that out of there
19:08 - we just want that if then block okay
19:11 - there we go oh
19:12 - get out of there forever bye okay we
19:14 - just need one forever
19:16 - okay now we just did up let's go ahead
19:18 - and do
19:19 - down all right switch costume two
19:22 - costume down
19:23 - fabulous now this will not point in the
19:25 - same direction as costume up obviously
19:28 - can you guess before i type it
19:31 - where costume down will point it will
19:33 - point down
19:34 - so how many degrees is that bump
19:39 - 180
19:44 - yay and again move 10 steps
19:47 - or else it'll just be the tiniest little
19:49 - movement
19:50 - okay let's duplicate again now let's do
19:53 - right and left
19:57 - pull down so we can see what we're doing
20:04 - and key pressed left arrow can you guess
20:08 - the degrees on the left costume left
20:13 - and this is where we're going to put in
20:15 - an extra piece of code here too
20:18 - we're going to put in set rotation style
20:21 - to left right
20:25 - and i played with this okay so our point
20:28 - of direction is
20:29 - negative 90 for everybody who said
20:30 - negative 90 congratulations you were
20:33 - right
20:34 - um and i played with this and it does
20:36 - make him go left
20:38 - so i like that and he looks like he's
20:40 - going left all right let's add one more
20:42 - if then block i don't know why i didn't
20:44 - duplicate this
20:46 - i just felt like typing key
20:50 - and this is gonna be right so think
20:52 - about what my degrees are gonna be if i
20:55 - go right
20:55 - right arrow switch costume to
21:00 - right
21:03 - switch costume to costume right awesome
21:07 - point in direction of 90 degrees
21:14 - perfect
21:20 - and move 10 steps when we do that 90
21:22 - degrees
21:26 - awesome and i'm playing with it right
21:28 - now
21:29 - oh and look there he's going he's going
21:33 - okay there he's going yay and it looks
21:35 - like the space bar is working
21:39 - all right i'm pressing the space bar and
21:41 - now i'm just now i'm just going
21:43 - up and down and now i'm pressing the
21:46 - space bar yay
21:48 - and he is deleting the grass as we go
21:52 - and then i'm pressing the f because he
21:54 - is now
21:55 - adding blocks awesome
21:59 - adding blocks adding blocks adding
22:01 - blocks
22:03 - and i am seeing a little lag in my
22:05 - computer
22:06 - so like if all of a sudden your or your
22:09 - my ipad if all of a sudden your
22:10 - scratch stops working that's okay save
22:13 - it make sure you're saving it as you go
22:16 - and it will be fine thank you so much
22:18 - for watching
22:19 - what can you make leave me a comment
