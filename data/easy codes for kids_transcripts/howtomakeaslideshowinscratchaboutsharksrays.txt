00:02 - let's learn about sharks and rays
00:06 - using scratch first
00:10 - let's gather our pictures from pixabay
00:13 - then we'll build our code in scratch
00:16 - finally we'll educate people to help
00:19 - save these beautiful sharks and rays
00:42 - so
01:30 - so the first thing that we need to do is
01:33 - to create
01:33 - a new folder on our desktops named
01:36 - sharks and rays
01:38 - so here i am on my desktop and i am
01:41 - going to right click
01:44 - go down to new select folder
01:48 - and type in sharks
01:51 - and rays
02:04 - step two let's go to google
02:09 - and in this search bar let's type
02:12 - pixabay p-i-x-a-b-a-y
02:19 - pixabay is a great resource for grabbing
02:22 - copyright free photos we'll use these
02:26 - in our photo montage of sharks and rays
02:30 - so i see right here pixabay
02:34 - 1.8 million stunning free images to use
02:37 - anywhere
02:37 - let's go ahead and click on it
02:41 - now all of these are not copyright free
02:44 - and i'm going to show you how to
02:45 - determine which ones we can use
02:47 - and which ones we can't so in the search
02:49 - bar go ahead and type
02:51 - shark and then hit this little guy right
02:55 - here
02:59 - the first row of images that we see are
03:02 - not
03:03 - copyright free
03:06 - these are sponsored images and that
03:08 - means that we have to pay for them
03:11 - so we don't want to select any of those
03:15 - the first image that we want to select
03:17 - is a sawfish which is a rey
03:19 - and it's really super cool it has a huge
03:22 - snout
03:23 - that has little spikes on it like a
03:26 - hedge trimmer
03:27 - so it has little teeth on it all coming
03:29 - out right here you can see them a little
03:31 - bit right here
03:32 - so i click on this
03:36 - and now i go over here
03:39 - to my free download and click on free
03:43 - download
03:44 - and then click on download again
03:57 - our sawfish photo is now
04:00 - in our downloads folder
04:03 - so we don't want it to just sit there
04:07 - we want it to actually live in our
04:10 - sharks
04:11 - and rays folder that we created
04:14 - just for this scratch project so
04:17 - i am going to go ahead and click on
04:21 - the little box next to my picture of my
04:24 - sawfish
04:26 - and i am going to use my home tab
04:29 - and i'm going to hit copy and then i'm
04:32 - going to go to my desktop
04:35 - and find that new folder that we just
04:37 - created
04:38 - so there it is sharks and rays
04:42 - i'm going to go home again and click
04:44 - paste
04:46 - now instead of this being
04:49 - named a random name from
04:52 - pixabay i am going to call this sawfish
04:58 - and all i did to rename it was just
05:00 - click on it
05:03 - so if i click on it lightly
05:06 - i can rename it
05:17 - okay step four let's select
05:21 - and download more sharks and raise

09:57 - step six open scratch
10:00 - go ahead and log in so you can save
10:04 - and share your projects now
10:07 - we are ready to go ahead and to create
10:10 - our
10:11 - awesome new slideshow
10:14 - that is going to feature sharks and rays
10:17 - with a little bit of text
10:18 - on top of each picture so we can give
10:21 - our audience
10:22 - a little bit more understanding of what
10:26 - these creatures are all about so go
10:29 - ahead and hit create
10:33 - and scratch will begin to set up your
10:35 - program
10:39 - step six so i am at my desktop
10:43 - and i see my sharks and rays folder
10:47 - i double click on it
10:50 - and i open up to see all of my amazing
10:55 - pictures of these fantastic
10:58 - amazing sharks and rays so i have a
11:01 - basking shark
11:03 - i have a great white uh shark with a
11:05 - blue background
11:07 - i have pictures of a great white with a
11:10 - transparent background or a clear
11:12 - background
11:13 - and it looks to be about five different
11:16 - pictures
11:17 - of the same great white i have a
11:20 - gray shark with his teeth showing
11:23 - i have three hammer heads with a
11:25 - transparent background or clear
11:27 - background
11:28 - i have manta rays i have my sawfish
11:31 - picture
11:32 - and i have an under wreath underneath
11:34 - rey picture
11:36 - okay so i've labeled all of them so i
11:39 - clearly understand what each picture is
11:42 - about
11:43 - and i'm not going to get them confused
11:45 - with any other picture
11:47 - now i go back into my scratch program
11:50 - that's already opened and the first
11:53 - thing that i want to do is get rid of my
11:55 - scratch cat bye-bye
11:59 - and the next thing that i want to do is
12:01 - i want to go ahead and upload
12:02 - all of my shark and rape my shark and
12:06 - rey
12:08 - pictures so i go into my upload
12:11 - window it's sort of down here on the
12:13 - right hand side
12:15 - and i choose this option upload sprite
12:20 - i go to my desktop
12:25 - and i go down to my sharks and rays
12:28 - folder i double click it
12:32 - and i wonder if i select
12:36 - my first picture and hold shift key down
12:39 - and then select my last picture oh look
12:43 - they can all be selected at one time
12:46 - and all be imported into my scratch
12:48 - picture at one time
12:49 - so all i did i'll do that again is i
12:52 - selected my very first
12:54 - shark picture then on my keyboard i'm
12:57 - holding my shift key down
12:59 - and i'm selecting my last picture so my
13:02 - first to my last picture with my shift
13:04 - key down on my keyboard
13:05 - and it selects all eight pictures at one
13:08 - time
13:09 - and i hit open
13:13 - and now my scratch program tells me that
13:16 - these are importing
13:20 - so there's basking there's great white
13:21 - with blue
13:23 - great white transparent gray shark with
13:27 - teeth
13:28 - three hammerheads
13:33 - manta rays sawfish underneath rey
13:38 - one two three four five six
13:41 - seven eight awesome okay let's go to my
13:45 - and they are
13:46 - all on top of each other and that's no
13:48 - big deal we're going to go ahead and fix
13:50 - that with code
13:52 - so the first thing that i want to do is
13:53 - i want to rename these
13:55 - in my scratch program
13:58 - because as i go through the slideshow
14:00 - i'm going to call all of these
14:01 - individually
14:03 - and when i call them i want to call them
14:06 - by a letter
14:07 - so i don't have to write basking shark
14:09 - and great white shark with blue
14:10 - background and great white shark with
14:12 - clear background
14:13 - that type of thing so i'm going to
14:15 - rename all of them and to do that i'm
14:17 - just going to be in my sprite window
14:19 - right here
14:21 - and the first one i have here is my
14:23 - basking shark
14:24 - so instead of it having the long name of
14:27 - basking shark
14:29 - i want to just name it b and you'll see
14:32 - why we do that in just a minute
14:33 - that is going to be our code part of our
14:36 - code
14:37 - for calling that picture great white
14:40 - shark let's go to him next
14:45 - so great white shark with the blue
14:47 - background i want to name
14:49 - him w
14:55 - the great white shark with the
14:58 - transparent background or the clear
14:59 - background
15:00 - i want to name him g
15:04 - for great the gray shark
15:08 - with the teeth with the scary teeth
15:12 - i want to name him tea for teeth
15:16 - the hammer heads you know what i'm going
15:18 - to name hammer heads
15:20 - h manta rays you know what i'm going to
15:25 - name them
15:28 - m sawfish
15:33 - s underneath rey
15:36 - which is this guy right here
15:40 - you so basking b
15:44 - great white with blue background w for
15:46 - white
15:48 - great whites um with the transparent
15:51 - background g
15:52 - for great
15:55 - t for
15:59 - the gray shark with the teeth h for the
16:02 - hammerheads
16:03 - m for the manta rays s for the sawfish
16:06 - and u for the underneath
16:08 - part of this ray picture okay so they
16:10 - are all layered on top of each other and
16:12 - that's fine
16:13 - because we are going to right now start
16:16 - putting some code in
16:18 - so we're just going to call each picture
16:20 - one at a time
16:21 - with that specific letter you'll see
16:24 - what i mean don't worry just follow me
16:27 - so the first shark that we are going to
16:30 - do is this basking shark
16:32 - and that's what he looks like when we
16:35 - look at his
16:36 - costume if we go into code
16:40 - we don't really see anything because his
16:42 - picture is sort of layered underneath
16:43 - all of these and hidden
16:45 - so the first thing that we want to do is
16:47 - we want to say okay
16:49 - when the green flag is clicked and we
16:51 - start our game
16:53 - we want him to hide because we don't
16:56 - want to see him until we
16:58 - press the letter b so when green flag
17:01 - clicked
17:01 - hide him and then we're going to go
17:03 - through all of these
17:05 - when w is clicked hide him when g is
17:07 - clicked tied him when t
17:09 - is clicked hide him when h is clicked
17:12 - hide him when
17:13 - m is clicked hide him when s is clicked
17:16 - hide him
17:17 - when u is clicked hide him when b is
17:20 - clicked
17:20 - show him so let's go ahead and put that
17:23 - first
17:24 - so i go to events
17:28 - when space key is pressed so instead of
17:32 - space put b when b
17:35 - key is pressed then let's go into our
17:38 - looks
17:40 - and down here is our show
17:45 - and let's check it out
17:48 - so he is hidden we can't really see it
17:50 - but it did
17:51 - it did hide from beneath this when this
17:54 - is clicked
17:55 - he hides and then let's go ahead and hit
17:58 - b
18:00 - see that he's behind here when b is
18:02 - clicked he shows up
18:04 - now let's go ahead and make that a
18:06 - little bit clearer so
18:08 - go back to events
18:16 - and let's go through all of these so the
18:18 - next one in line is w
18:20 - so let's hide w when w
18:25 - is pressed go into looks
18:30 - grab that hide hide him
18:35 - go back to events
18:39 - what's next g when
18:42 - g
18:49 - is pressed go into looks
18:55 - hide him
19:05 - when tea
19:10 - is pressed
19:18 - hide him
19:24 - when h
19:30 - is pressed
19:33 - hide him
19:41 - what's our next one m okay when m is
19:44 - pressed
19:49 - hide him
19:56 - two more two more when s is pressed
20:08 - hide him and then i'm going to show you
20:11 - a shortcut here
20:15 - if i right click here i can say
20:18 - duplicate
20:20 - and it gives me a duplicate of the block
20:25 - so the last one is you
20:29 - which is our great big manta picture
20:31 - right here underneath manta
20:35 - so hide him then okay so now let's go
20:38 - ahead
20:39 - we have hidden everything except our
20:42 - basking
20:43 - shark but we only show him when we press
20:45 - b so let's go ahead and
20:47 - and hit green flag
20:51 - now let's press b
20:54 - now wait a second i see him popping up
20:56 - back here
20:58 - but i don't see anything else happening
21:00 - well because none of these other
21:02 - pictures
21:03 - have any code on them so they don't know
21:06 - how to behave themselves
21:09 - so they're just hanging out
21:12 - basking shark is the only one who knows
21:15 - how to behave because he has code behind
21:17 - them
21:17 - behind him right now so we have to put
21:19 - in code
21:21 - to a couple more of these before we see
21:23 - any real change
21:24 - but that's okay let's go ahead and go to
21:28 - so basking shark has when green flag is
21:31 - click tied
21:32 - when b is pressed show and then the rest
21:34 - of the pictures
21:36 - go ahead and hide in until
21:39 - their letter is shown so let's do the
21:42 - same thing for
21:43 - our great white shark
21:51 - so when green flag is clicked hide
21:56 - now we want our great white with a blue
21:59 - background to show when
22:01 - our w is clicked so we go to
22:05 - when w
22:11 - then show now the rest of the time we
22:15 - want to hide
22:16 - so b g t h m s
22:20 - u we have to hide all of those now there
22:23 - is a shortcut for doing this there is a
22:25 - code way for doing this
22:27 - i teach this letter by letter so let's
22:30 - go ahead and pick b
22:33 - because i want my students to really
22:35 - understand
22:36 - what they're doing and so the first time
22:39 - they go
22:40 - through this if they have to hide every
22:42 - single letter
22:43 - i've found it helps them understand this
22:44 - lesson a little bit better
22:47 - and it's just fun to be on here and to
22:49 - click around
22:51 - okay so when g is pressed
22:54 - hide
22:58 - and let's see when
23:01 - t is pressed
23:09 - t for teeth hide
23:17 - and when h is pressed
23:24 - then we're going to go ahead and hide
23:31 - and when m is pressed we're going to go
23:33 - ahead and hide
23:44 - and then let's go ahead and do our right
23:46 - click duplicate
23:50 - our little shortcut and when s
23:53 - is pressed we hide
23:57 - so right click duplicate
24:01 - when you is pressed we're going to go
24:05 - ahead and hide
24:07 - okay so let's make sure we have
24:08 - everybody so when it's a w we show
24:11 - b g t
24:15 - h m s u
24:18 - okay awesome let's see if anything
24:19 - happens see if we can see anything
24:21 - happening
24:24 - now i'm pressing some of the keys
24:25 - nothing really is happening because we
24:27 - have so many layers
24:29 - okay let's go to g now g is the great
24:32 - white sharks with the transparent
24:34 - background
24:35 - so the first thing we want to do is when
24:37 - green flag is clicked
24:40 - we want to hide
24:43 - and then we want to do events
24:48 - when we'll do this one for the show
24:51 - when g is pressed
24:56 - we show that's the only one
25:00 - now let's go to we'll duplicate the next
25:04 - one
25:06 - when b let's start with b
25:09 - when b is pressed we hide
25:15 - now let's do right click duplicate
25:20 - when w oops
25:26 - nope not v when w
25:29 - is pressed we hide duplicate
25:40 - when t is pressed we hide
25:53 - when h
25:57 - is pressed we hide
26:01 - right click duplicate i'm going to put
26:03 - this up here
26:06 - when m is pressed we hide
26:10 - duplicate whoops it just gave me the
26:12 - hide
26:17 - now if i have a mistake i just pull it
26:19 - off
26:22 - okay so when s is pressed
26:28 - we hide and then duplicate this
26:36 - when you
26:40 - is pressed we hide okay awesome
26:50 - okay now once all of the code is in
26:54 - our pictures i want to then go back to
26:58 - my very first picture which is my
27:00 - basking shark
27:02 - and i want to make sure that my sprite
27:04 - is
27:05 - the name is b just because i don't want
27:08 - to confuse it with anything
27:10 - and then
27:13 - i want to go to my text
27:17 - and for each picture i have written
27:20 - something different about each animal so
27:23 - i just put right on my animal that text
27:26 - so for instance on my basking shark i
27:29 - have don't worry this big mouth
27:31 - only eats tiny plankton fish eggs and
27:33 - krill
27:35 - and then more importantly i have down
27:37 - here
27:38 - press green flag for directory and that
27:41 - will mean
27:42 - that our audience can go back to
27:45 - the green flag and click it and they'll
27:47 - be given a little
27:48 - preview of what letters they need to
27:52 - click
27:52 - to go to each animal okay
27:56 - so i have all of this text written down
27:58 - in my matching
28:00 - online lesson tutorial for this at
28:04 - easycodesforkids.com
28:06 - so you can see that in the description
28:08 - or if you want to write your own
28:10 - about each animal you can do that as
28:12 - well so teachers here
28:14 - is a great chance for your kids to get
28:17 - onto google
28:18 - and to do some research about all of
28:20 - these different animals and then come up
28:22 - with their own text
28:23 - to put on top of the picture
28:42 - okay so i opened up a fresh
28:46 - scratch program to show you how i made
28:50 - the beginning piece of our slideshow
28:53 - just so it's a little less confusing
28:56 - so when you have all of
29:00 - when we have all of our different
29:02 - pictures here
29:05 - we can go through them because
29:09 - we have code on each of them telling
29:12 - them to hide
29:13 - until a certain letter is pressed
29:17 - well people who are going to come to
29:20 - this program are not going to know
29:22 - automatically
29:23 - what letter they need to press to see a
29:26 - basking shark
29:28 - or to see manta rays
29:32 - or to see a sawfish unless we give them
29:36 - a nice little directory and i
29:40 - think the easiest way to go from
29:43 - let's say basking shark if i'm in a
29:45 - basking shark
29:46 - and i can't remember all the other
29:49 - different sharks and ray pictures that
29:51 - are available
29:53 - i think you know what i'll just go back
29:55 - to my green flag for the directory
29:58 - so all of them in the bottom corner have
30:01 - press green flag for directory so they
30:03 - know after they're done looking at this
30:05 - picture
30:06 - i can press green flag for the directory
30:09 - and find what is the next
30:12 - letter i need to press to go to the next
30:15 - animal
30:17 - okay so this is going to be the very
30:20 - start of our slideshow and it's going to
30:22 - say welcome to our slideshow
30:24 - it has a nice little cartoon shark and
30:26 - then it gives sort of an explanation
30:29 - press the following keys whoops i messed
30:32 - that up
30:33 - press the following keys to see and read
30:35 - about
30:36 - sharks and rays okay super simple
30:40 - and then they will
30:44 - know that when they go back to the start
30:47 - they don't have to memorize oh i want to
30:49 - see
30:50 - great white so i have to press g okay
30:53 - so what i'd like to show you is how i'm
30:55 - going to make this
30:56 - welcome to our slideshow and it's going
30:59 - to be a lot
31:00 - it's going to be very similar to
31:03 - the code that we use for the other
31:05 - animals
31:06 - a lot of hide and show so the first
31:09 - thing that i want to do
31:10 - is go down here and choose a sprite
31:19 - and i'm going to type shark into my
31:22 - search and there's my little shark
31:26 - now he has some animation he has some
31:29 - different costumes
31:32 - so he animates to this guy so he goes
31:35 - from a great white
31:37 - to a hammerhead but we are not
31:40 - necessarily concerned about that we i
31:42 - like to use him just as
31:44 - a great white and i'm going to add the
31:48 - text here
31:49 - and then i'll add the code and that will
31:53 - be
31:54 - our beginning piece of our slideshow
31:57 - so you are going to do this right in
32:00 - your program i'm just doing this on a
32:03 - separate piece
32:04 - so it doesn't look confusing okay all
32:07 - right so
32:08 - i want to make sure that this guy is
32:12 - grouped
32:17 - and now i can move him up here
32:21 - so i just used my arrow
32:26 - i drew a box around him and then i hit
32:28 - group
32:29 - just so i can move him around correctly
32:32 - and he doesn't
32:33 - i don't move him in pieces now i'm going
32:36 - to choose my text
32:37 - and i'm going to say welcome to
32:41 - our slideshow
32:45 - about sharks and
32:48 - rays
32:55 - now i can see in this corner over here
32:56 - that that is a little bit
32:59 - out of alignment
33:03 - so i move it a little bit
33:08 - okay now
33:11 - here comes the important part
33:16 - the directory so i'm going to go in
33:18 - alphabetical order so i'm going to
33:20 - say b or basking shark
33:29 - the second one is g
33:32 - [Music]
33:33 - a space great
33:38 - white shark
33:44 - with clear and
33:49 - let's see if it goes up here
34:03 - i'm going to scroll out a little bit
34:05 - okay that looks good
34:16 - okay let's see the third one
34:20 - is h hammerhead
34:24 - the fourth one is m
34:28 - and ray
34:31 - the fifth one is s
34:35 - for saw fish
34:39 - and that up a little better
34:44 - the sixth one is
34:47 - t re
34:50 - shark with teeth
34:56 - seven is you
35:00 - sting ray
35:03 - with underneath
35:11 - picture finally
35:15 - we have w for great
35:18 - white shark with blue
35:22 - background
35:29 - okay so the final thing that we have to
35:31 - do
35:33 - is just add our code
35:36 - so we need to have our code
35:40 - that tells our slideshow when to show
35:44 - and when to hide okay super simple and
35:47 - it's a lot like
35:49 - the rest of our slideshow
35:52 - so we go into code and we do events
35:57 - when green flag is clicked we're going
36:00 - to show
36:00 - [Music]
36:02 - our beginning slide when
36:06 - let's go to events
36:12 - when b is clicked or
36:15 - pressed we are going to hide
36:22 - okay and let's right click duplicate
36:27 - when g is pressed we're going to hide
36:37 - okay duplicate
36:41 - when h is pressed we're going to hide
36:45 - duplicate when
36:52 - m is pressed we're going to hide
37:04 - when s is pressed we're going to hide
37:12 - [Music]
37:16 - when t is pressed
37:19 - we're going to hide
37:25 - when u is pressed we're going to hide
37:31 - [Music]
37:33 - and finally
37:40 - when w is pressed
37:45 - we're going to hide so only on
37:49 - green flag are we going to see our
38:02 - beginner
38:58 - do
39:04 - you
