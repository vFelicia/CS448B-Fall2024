00:01 - hi let's make a roblox type game in
00:04 - scratch
00:04 - this tutorial is not for beginners the
00:07 - objective of this game is
00:08 - easy to make money and play the lotto
00:12 - the lotto is super easy
00:16 - just click the click me button and guess
00:19 - a number from
00:20 - 1 to 10. if you lose a red screen
00:24 - appears and your make money account goes
00:26 - down by one point
00:27 - if you win a green screen appears and
00:30 - you gain a point
00:32 - but to play the lotto you must first
00:35 - make
00:35 - money now in this tutorial you can
00:39 - learn about the three different jobs
00:42 - and about how we play the lotto
00:45 - step one let's create three different
00:48 - jobs with three different sprites
00:50 - there's the pizza shop guy or gal
00:53 - he chases brown bread avoiding green
00:56 - bread
00:57 - and his job is the easiest so he only
01:00 - earns one
01:00 - point for every single piece of bread he
01:04 - catches all right the candy store guy
01:07 - or gal he chases little colored hearts
01:10 - and avoids the dark hearts super simple
01:14 - there he is in that fun little
01:15 - background he goes up down all around
01:18 - and he gets two points for everything
01:20 - that he catches
01:21 - the flower shop guy this is the hardest
01:23 - level watch out for the bad guy there is
01:26 - a bad guy
01:27 - in this uh job and he is coming after
01:31 - you with his ray gun
01:32 - and um the flower shop guy actually
01:35 - tries to catch the little beetle
01:37 - and he wins three points when he does
01:38 - all right step two let's go ahead and
01:41 - upload three different colored strips of
01:43 - running sprites
01:44 - and then in step three we're going to
01:47 - make
01:48 - each sprite into its own costume so
01:50 - let's go ahead and unpack that
01:52 - so there are my six um
01:55 - little flower shop guys and they are
01:59 - all in a state of running so i uploaded
02:02 - the entire
02:03 - strip of them and now i'm just gonna go
02:06 - ahead and put each of them
02:08 - in their own different costume
02:11 - and then i'm going to go ahead and label
02:13 - them
02:15 - run right one through six
02:19 - so i'm just duplicating
02:22 - and copying pasting here so they're all
02:25 - in their own
02:26 - little costume so there's
02:29 - run right one two three four five and
02:33 - six
02:34 - and then we're going to add some code so
02:36 - it looks as if
02:38 - they are running
02:45 - okay now let's go ahead and duplicate
02:47 - them and
02:48 - turn them flip them horizontal and turn
02:51 - them to the left
02:52 - and then label them run left one through
02:55 - six
02:57 - easy easy easy and with these stripes or
03:00 - these uh sprites we are going to be able
03:04 - to run
03:04 - not only right and left but also up and
03:16 - down
03:18 - go ahead and place the all the rights
03:20 - together and all the lefts together all
03:21 - right step
03:22 - four let's code the sprites to run let's
03:25 - stay with
03:26 - our red flower guy so we're gonna code
03:28 - them to run
03:29 - up down left and right and it's actually
03:33 - really simple we're going to use blocks
03:36 - so first let's go ahead and code run
03:39 - left
03:42 - alright so choose make a block and let's
03:44 - call it run left
03:50 - now let's go ahead and choose switch
03:52 - costume to
03:53 - run left one
03:57 - then change x by negative 10 because
04:00 - we're running
04:00 - to the left side of our screen then
04:03 - we're gonna do
04:04 - uh weight point zero one seconds
04:07 - then let's go ahead and add next costume
04:10 - now let's click that run block oops
04:12 - can you see my mistake
04:15 - instead of run left i have run right so
04:17 - let's go ahead and switch that and now
04:19 - he looks right
04:20 - yay or left
04:23 - there he goes
04:27 - now let's go ahead and add a key here
04:30 - our left key so when we type it on the
04:34 - keyboard
04:34 - he actually runs to the left so i
04:37 - dragged out my when green flag is
04:38 - clicked then a forever loop
04:40 - then an if then and
04:43 - key when left arrow is pressed
04:48 - drag in our run left block
04:55 - and let's add a couple more things
04:58 - set point direction in can you guess it
05:02 - negative 90. so he points to the left
05:07 - and let's set his rotation style
05:10 - for don't rotate so he doesn't flip over
05:14 - and let's try it out okay looks pretty
05:17 - good
05:21 - all right now let's run right so my
05:24 - block
05:24 - let's name it run right and click ok
05:35 - now let's go ahead and repeat here so
05:37 - switch costume to
05:38 - run right one
05:44 - and
05:48 - change x by 10.
05:53 - let's grab a weight 0.01 seconds
05:59 - and then let's add a next costume
06:10 - okay if we click that run right block
06:14 - he'll go ahead and he'll move and he'll
06:15 - run to the right perfect
06:18 - now let's add in our forever loop
06:22 - the same blocks and let's just duplicate
06:26 - that left arrow
06:27 - and then change some of the parameters
06:31 - so if when the key right arrow is
06:35 - pressed
06:36 - let's get rid of these guys so we don't
06:39 - need that run block
06:42 - run left we don't need that let's go
06:44 - ahead and grab
06:45 - our run right block
06:48 - and then instead of point in direction
06:53 - instead of point in direction negative
06:55 - 90
06:56 - we plane in direction 90
07:00 - and then let's leave that don't rotate
07:04 - and make sure that that block is right
07:07 - underneath it forever
07:08 - okay so there is our running left
07:13 - and our running right perfect
07:17 - easy all right now let's run up and run
07:20 - down
07:28 - so go ahead and click make a block hit
07:31 - okay
07:33 - and run up and hit okay again
07:37 - now you know the drill switch costume
07:44 - and this is going to be left
07:49 - so run left
07:53 - they're all left except the right
07:56 - so left up and down are all
07:59 - left costumes all right change y
08:03 - by 10 because we're running up which is
08:06 - in positive
08:07 - territory wait .01 seconds again
08:10 - and then go ahead and grab that switch
08:13 - costume
08:15 - perfect now let's test it out
08:19 - we can just go ahead and click let's go
08:22 - ahead and duplicate
08:23 - that left arrow and
08:26 - choose the up arrow key get rid of
08:30 - those blocks underneath choose the run
08:33 - up block perfect
08:36 - point in direction can you guess the
08:39 - direction we're going to point in
08:44 - 180 and let's set a rotation style of
08:48 - all around now i think that there are
08:51 - different parameters that we can use i'm
08:52 - wondering if any of you
08:54 - know how to run up and not use those
08:57 - so just let me know in the comments okay
09:00 - so our run up is working
09:02 - left right
09:06 - up can't go any further up awesome
09:13 - i like how he drags his leg okay let's
09:15 - go ahead and make down
09:17 - so make a block call it run down hit
09:22 - okay
09:31 - let's go ahead and switch costume two
09:36 - left
09:40 - and then change by
09:46 - negative 10 good
09:52 - and then let's add our weight 0.01
09:55 - seconds
09:59 - and then let's add our next costume
10:13 - okay let's go ahead and duplicate that
10:14 - up
10:16 - let's make it a down take out that run
10:19 - up block
10:20 - put in our run or our um run down block
10:26 - and then point direction can you guess
10:29 - what this is going to be
10:30 - zero yay if you guessed zero great job
10:35 - and leave that rotation style okay let's
10:37 - see if he can run down
10:38 - yay he's running down he's running up
10:41 - left right
10:43 - up down
10:46 - left up
10:50 - awesome all right step five let's go
10:52 - ahead and create the make money variable
10:54 - without money we can't do anything this
10:58 - is super easy
10:59 - just go into variables
11:04 - click make a variable
11:07 - and for the new variable name go ahead
11:09 - and type make
11:10 - money and then you can add a dollar sign
11:13 - or two
11:14 - and hit okay all right step six let's
11:18 - upload the bad guy that lives in the
11:20 - flower shop this is the only store with
11:21 - a bad guy
11:22 - he has a deadly ray gun so i drew this
11:26 - little character with a top hat and a
11:28 - funny little gun
11:30 - and there are six of him
11:33 - seven of him and seven
11:36 - and each in a different position and
11:40 - so the same thing with the flower shop
11:43 - guy we're gonna do with the bad guy
11:45 - which is give him um his own costume
11:49 - and so the first picture of him he's
11:52 - just sort of holding his ray gun
11:54 - and the last picture of him there's just
11:57 - a puff of smoke
11:58 - so in like the fifth and sixth the puffs
12:01 - of smoke get bigger
12:02 - so it gives the illusion um
12:06 - that he is shooting this crazy
12:09 - i don't know this crazy gas gun or
12:11 - something
12:12 - so i'm just duplicating and then i copy
12:15 - and paste
12:16 - and each picture is a little bit
12:18 - different
12:19 - so when we go ahead and code him it's
12:21 - going to give the
12:24 - illusion of an animation of him actually
12:26 - moving
12:28 - and his gun going off now i can take
12:31 - that white off just by using my fill
12:36 - transparent
12:38 - and i put him right in the middle of the
12:50 - screen
12:55 - almost done
13:02 - okay perfect now make sure that you
13:04 - label all of them bad guy
13:06 - right one through seven and then let's
13:10 - go ahead and make
13:12 - you guessed it we're gonna duplicate
13:14 - these and make him
13:15 - run to the left as well all right let's
13:18 - say we're done with that
13:19 - now let's step seven code the bad guy
13:23 - so we're in the bad guy and when green
13:26 - flag is clicked
13:30 - let's go x to
13:36 - 221
13:39 - and y to negative 129.
13:43 - so we're going to be moving the bad guy
13:44 - from right to left
13:46 - across the screen and then he's gonna
13:48 - jump into a random position
13:50 - now let's add a glide one
13:54 - second to x same numbers two two one and
13:58 - negative one two nine
14:05 - now let's pull in that forever loop
14:12 - and let's go ahead and add a weight
14:15 - point one second
14:16 - we're going to make him a little faster
14:18 - than the
14:20 - red guy
14:24 - and you can adjust this however you'd
14:26 - like and make it your own game
14:28 - and then we go ahead and put in next
14:29 - costume so he looks as if he is
14:32 - really running and shooting his ray gun
14:44 - now we're going to do change y by you
14:47 - guessed it negative 5
14:48 - and you can do negative 10 you can do
14:50 - negative 7 if you want him to move
14:52 - faster
14:53 - this way he really looks um at negative
14:55 - 5. you can really see
14:56 - each pose that we've drawn all right
14:59 - let's add a
15:01 - if then statement if
15:06 - x position is less than
15:11 - 170 negative 170
15:16 - then
15:20 - go to random position awesome
15:24 - so when you get to the end of the screen
15:25 - then jump
15:33 - set x
15:37 - to 180 and let's try it out
15:41 - there he goes
15:53 - step eight let's go ahead and upload the
15:55 - beetle in the flower shop
15:56 - remember this is the objective of the
15:59 - flower shop guy
16:00 - is to catch the beetle and get three
16:02 - points stay away from the bad guy if the
16:04 - bad guy touches them
16:05 - it's minus three points so i went into
16:08 - my upload a sprite
16:10 - i'm gonna go ahead in the search bar and
16:12 - type beetle
16:13 - there's the beetle let's go ahead and
16:15 - first thing let's make him a little
16:16 - smaller
16:18 - he's a little too easy to catch that
16:20 - size so
16:22 - i go ahead and i
16:25 - draw a box around his entire body and
16:28 - just
16:29 - drag him to a smaller size okay perfect
16:32 - let's add some code when green flag is
16:35 - clicked
16:39 - show him
16:43 - and then in a forever loop
16:48 - weight point
16:53 - did i do 0.2 seconds yes 0.2 seconds
16:56 - and then hit the next costume we're
16:58 - going to make a couple more costumes for
17:00 - him
17:01 - and then wait 0.2 seconds again
17:12 - and then go to random position so he
17:14 - should be jumping all over the place
17:16 - right now let's make him look a little
17:19 - bit more like a real bug
17:21 - by um having him jump and move in a
17:23 - different
17:25 - spot so he actually does look like he's
17:28 - jumping
17:28 - so he's not always just facing to the
17:30 - right hand side so let's go ahead and
17:33 - duplicate
17:34 - this beetle so there's four different
17:36 - beetles
17:37 - and each of them should be facing a
17:39 - different way and you can use the flip
17:40 - horizontal foot vertical
17:42 - i just wanted to rotate because rotating
17:44 - is fun
18:17 - okay let's try it out hit the green flag
18:20 - okay now he looks more beatily because
18:23 - he's actually
18:24 - just sort of like jumping all over and
18:25 - moving and it
18:27 - sort of looks cute okay let's go back to
18:30 - the red
18:31 - flower guy code and i added when green
18:35 - flag is clicked
18:36 - for everloop let's go ahead and start
18:38 - adding um some things to make this into
18:41 - like a real game
18:42 - so inside the forever loop let's do if
18:45 - then statement so
18:46 - if i am touching the bad guy
18:51 - what happens then say
18:58 - ouch
19:04 - and let's do something with our money
19:07 - let's go ahead and change
19:09 - make money by negative three
19:13 - because it's a penalty we don't want to
19:15 - get hit by the
19:17 - naughty bad guy
19:20 - with his ray gun okay wait 0.1 second
19:24 - then let's go ahead and add an if then
19:27 - and let's do the same thing for the
19:28 - beetle except let's say
19:31 - got you and let's add three points
19:34 - and then we'll wait point one again so
19:36 - it's the exact same
19:38 - code for each the beetle and the bad guy
19:41 - and it's going to be the same thing in
19:42 - all of the different jobs
19:44 - we're going to say something we're going
19:46 - to have a negative and positive
19:49 - and we're going to have a little bit of
19:50 - a wait time so this is actually i'm
19:52 - trying to catch the beetle right now
19:53 - it's actually pretty hard
19:56 - okay i've seen my first mistake i don't
19:58 - like that when i
20:00 - hit the um beetle it just keeps saying
20:03 - got you
20:04 - so let's go ahead and change that
20:08 - so instead of it just saying it let's do
20:11 - a say for two seconds
20:24 - all right so let's get rid of the
20:27 - regular stay
20:28 - and we'll just have a say for two
20:29 - seconds
20:32 - so got you for two seconds and plus
20:35 - three
20:35 - and then wait point zero one second and
20:38 - let's go ahead and do the same thing for
20:41 - the um bad guy if the bad guy touches me
20:43 - i'm gonna say ouch for two seconds
20:46 - i'm gonna get a minus three on in my
20:48 - money
20:52 - and then we're gonna do a little weight
20:53 - on there too
21:04 - okay this is actually really hard to
21:06 - catch him got you yay
21:14 - he's too fast okay step nine let's go
21:17 - ahead and add a really fun moving
21:19 - background for our flower shop just to
21:21 - make things a little bit more
21:22 - interesting when we work at the flower
21:23 - shop
21:24 - so i um downloaded these
21:27 - two or this one um green
21:30 - block minecraft type back drop and
21:34 - i want to go ahead and upload it into a
21:36 - sprite
21:37 - so it's not a backdrop it's in a sprite
21:41 - so sprite sprite sprite there is my
21:44 - little green
21:46 - it's gonna be a backdrop but it's in a
21:48 - sprite um i duplicated it so i have two
21:50 - and they're gonna layer over each other
21:52 - and constantly move
21:54 - it's gonna be super cool let's make it's
21:56 - gonna make the
21:57 - flower shop an interesting place to work
21:59 - all right so let's go ahead and add a
22:01 - broadcast message
22:02 - the broadcast message is going to be
22:04 - flowers we're going to have one for
22:05 - every single job
22:07 - so if i receive flowers then i'm going
22:09 - to go backwards
22:12 - 10 layers because these are going to be
22:13 - more these aren't sprites these are
22:15 - going to be more of a backdrop
22:16 - so when i receive my new message i'm
22:18 - going to go backwards and then
22:20 - i'm let's go ahead and add a new
22:22 - variable x position 1.
22:24 - so i'm just going to call that xpos1
22:27 - and ypos1
22:31 - so two new variables x position one and
22:35 - y position one easy that's how we're
22:38 - going to tell this guy to start moving
22:45 - okay now let's go ahead and set
22:49 - you guessed it x position one two
22:59 - zero and y possession position one to
23:03 - zero
23:05 - and then let's go ahead and go to x
23:08 - and y and instead of typing anything
23:11 - in let's go ahead and put our variables
23:14 - in there
23:15 - go to x position one y position one
23:20 - perfect and then let's do a forever loop
23:34 - and change x position one
23:38 - by
23:41 - negative ten
23:52 - and next
23:55 - go to x equals
24:00 - x position y equals y position
24:03 - so i've just made it move a little tiny
24:05 - bit
24:11 - then let's add an if then
24:21 - and we'll add a less than operator
24:24 - if x position one is less than
24:29 - negative 480 which is the width of our
24:31 - little screen
24:38 - then what happens so if it's less than
24:40 - our screen
24:42 - then we set x position to our screen
24:45 - 480.
24:48 - it'll make sense in a minute
24:54 - okay so i'm going to take out that
24:56 - broadcast message right now just to try
24:58 - it and i'll put in a green flag
25:00 - so do you see in the upper left hand
25:02 - corner our variables they're going
25:04 - x position is going up to 480 and then
25:07 - down to negative 480 and that's right
25:08 - that's what we want
25:12 - we have to layer it with something and
25:14 - that's where we need that second sprite
25:16 - that second green backdrop sprite
25:18 - so let's go into the first sprite
25:21 - because the second sprite has no code
25:23 - let's go into that first sprite and
25:25 - let's go ahead and drag that code into
25:27 - the second
25:28 - now we're going to change the variables
25:30 - here we're going to make two new
25:32 - variables in that second
25:34 - backdrop x position 2 and y
25:37 - position 2. so let's get rid of that
25:39 - green flag clicked
25:41 - let's go to variables make a variable x
25:44 - position 2
25:45 - and y position 2. so we have four new
25:48 - variables
25:50 - now go ahead and set that x
25:53 - to x position 2 and y position two to
25:56 - zero
25:57 - now let's take out
26:05 - let's go ahead and pull this apart so i
26:07 - can take things out a little better oops
26:13 - let's take out go to x y
26:16 - and let's do
26:19 - go to x position two
26:24 - and y position two
26:42 - okay now change x position two two
26:47 - by negative ten
26:50 - and let's take out those position ones
26:53 - and put in x position two y position two
27:07 - all right if x position 2 is less than
27:10 - negative 480
27:14 - and let's go ahead and leave that as x
27:17 - position one
27:19 - now let's try it out
27:25 - so we need green flag clicked
27:29 - let's go back into that one add green
27:30 - flag clicked
27:32 - and um go ahead and click our green flag
27:34 - perfect it's running
27:36 - all right step 10 let's add a broadcast
27:38 - message
27:43 - all right so we are in our bad guy code
27:48 - and i want to go ahead and say when when
27:51 - he hears the message flowers that's when
27:53 - he's gonna
27:54 - go ahead and do his thing so when i
27:56 - receive new message
27:58 - flowers hit okay
28:03 - that's when his code is going to start
28:05 - running
28:06 - and we're going to make this for anybody
28:08 - that works in the flower shop
28:13 - so when i receive the message flowers
28:18 - i'm going to show myself as the bad guy
28:20 - because that's where i work
28:21 - in the flower shop
28:29 - all right let's go to the beetle
28:40 - and when i receive flowers then my code
28:43 - starts now let's go to
28:45 - our red sprite guy in the flower shop
28:49 - our flower guy
28:51 - and let's take off those when green flag
28:54 - is clicked
28:54 - and when i receive flowers put those on
28:57 - top of our
28:59 - move tools our move code
29:20 - okay so we're in
29:25 - the bad guy sprite now let's go ahead
29:29 - and start making buttons to jump to the
29:33 - three different jobs that you can have
29:36 - okay so you can work at the pizza shop
29:38 - the flower shop or the candy store
29:40 - let's do the pizza shop first so we're
29:41 - gonna make a little button
29:43 - so i've downloaded a little pizza
29:46 - shop sign and i uploaded it as
29:50 - a sprite now let's go ahead and make it
29:54 - look a little bit like a button
29:55 - and we're going to stick it on the home
29:56 - page so
29:58 - our players can click it and say hey i
30:00 - want to work at the pizza shop
30:02 - so i'm going to make it just the right
30:04 - size put it over to the left-hand part
30:06 - of the screen and then in
30:08 - text red text write pizza shop
30:12 - above it and then go ahead and
30:16 - make a box around it in red
30:19 - again so it looks like a button and then
30:21 - we're just going to code it
30:23 - there's the box so that when our players
30:27 - press it they go to a pizza store
30:29 - and they see our little pizza guy and
30:31 - they can play
30:33 - our little pizza bread catch game and
30:34 - win money
30:36 - to play the lotto okay so we're in the
30:39 - pizza shop
30:41 - guy sprite or we're in the pizza shop
30:44 - button sprite
30:45 - when message received we'll go ahead
30:48 - oh when message received flowers we're
30:50 - going to hide that button
30:52 - so hiding different sprites is important
30:55 - in this game because we only want the
30:56 - sprites to show up
30:58 - in their specific jobs so
31:01 - when green flag is clicked we want to
31:05 - show the pizza shop button because it's
31:07 - going to be on the home page
31:09 - and the home page is going to be when we
31:11 - click the green flag
31:13 - and let's add a couple more little
31:16 - simple codes here when this sprite is
31:19 - clicked
31:20 - now let's go ahead step 12 and make a
31:22 - pizza shop background so when that
31:24 - sprite's clicked it goes to this
31:25 - background
31:28 - so when the sprite is clicked let's do a
31:31 - new message
31:32 - that says pizza or pizza store or pizza
31:35 - shop whatever you want
31:39 - and let's upload a picture of the inside
31:42 - of a like a minecraft or a roblox game
31:45 - of a pizza shop
31:49 - so this one that i got is sort of red
31:51 - and black and it has
31:53 - um i don't know if you can see it but it
31:56 - has different
31:57 - a menu on the wall and it has sort of
32:00 - like a kitchen
32:00 - and some benches and it i like it
32:03 - because it's red
32:05 - now go ahead and fill up your entire
32:08 - backdrop with your picture
32:10 - you can have any picture you like you
32:11 - can even just have like a red background
32:13 - here it doesn't have to be a shop
32:14 - background
32:16 - i just like these little images i think
32:17 - it's more fun
32:19 - okay so i make sure that it fills the
32:21 - entire backdrop
32:23 - now i go back to my pizza store sprite
32:27 - and remember this is going to be a
32:29 - button that clicks
32:30 - us and what we're going to say that
32:32 - clicks us into the game
32:33 - into the pizza shop so when so we're
32:37 - going to say when this sprite is clicked
32:38 - go ahead and go to that backdrop now
32:40 - number 13 let's go ahead and make a home
32:43 - button
32:45 - so let's go into the sprites and upload
32:49 - and in the search bar let's type home
32:52 - and there's a little home button right
32:53 - there and
32:56 - let's drag that to the top right of the
32:57 - screen
32:59 - and it's a little big let's make it a
33:01 - little smaller
33:10 - a little bigger and
33:14 - it is always going to be seen because um
33:17 - we're going to allow our players to
33:19 - always go back home
33:21 - so let's go into the code and when this
33:25 - sprite is clicked
33:29 - same thing with the pizza store switch
33:32 - backdrop to
33:33 - home so it's just a blank white screen
33:36 - and there's our pizza shop button
33:39 - awesome so those two things are on our
33:41 - home page
33:43 - when the green flag is clicked we're
33:45 - going to show
33:47 - our home button good
33:55 - okay let's test it out all right let's
33:58 - go back to the
34:00 - flower shop guide
34:03 - and let's add when green flag is clicked
34:06 - we're going to hide
34:07 - our flower shop guide because we don't
34:08 - want to see him until we're actually
34:10 - in working in our flower shop okay so
34:13 - let's go to the bad guy
34:16 - and when green flag is clicked
34:20 - let's hide the bad guy because we don't
34:22 - want to see him until we click
34:24 - into our flower shop
34:27 - oh there's the beetle still in the pizza
34:29 - shop so let's hide him so let's go into
34:31 - the beatles code
34:32 - and when green flag is clicked hide
34:42 - all right so let's test it out go to
34:44 - home go to pizza shop
34:45 - okay back to home
34:49 - okay step 14
34:52 - let's make the flower shop button so
34:54 - same steps
34:56 - as the pizza store but
34:59 - so upload and this i just
35:02 - have a nice little picture of flowers
35:05 - and
35:05 - in purple or pink some type of cute
35:08 - flower color
35:09 - go ahead and add the text flower shop on
35:11 - top of it and then add a box around it
35:13 - so it looks like a little button and
35:16 - then sort of make it the same size
35:18 - now let's make that flower shot button
35:20 - go to the moving
35:21 - background that we clicked or that we
35:24 - created i'm sorry
35:26 - okay so
35:30 - we are in the moving background the
35:32 - first
35:33 - sprite of the moving background when i
35:35 - receive flowers let's go ahead and
35:37 - change that broadcast message to when i
35:39 - receive flowers
35:41 - we show this background good
35:50 - when the backdrop switches to
35:53 - lottery we're gonna hide it so basically
35:57 - we're going to hide it
35:58 - until hide these until they're um we
36:01 - have the flower shop so when backdrop
36:04 - switches to home hide
36:05 - when backdrop switches to pizza shop
36:07 - hide when backdrop switches to
36:09 - candyland hide we don't want to see any
36:12 - of these
36:13 - except in when somebody clicks the
36:15 - flowers when somebody broadcasts flower
36:17 - or goes into the flower shop
36:22 - so i'm just hiding hiding hiding hiding
36:24 - this
36:26 - okay so i go into my second green
36:28 - backdrop
36:29 - which is a skype and i'm just going to
36:32 - go ahead and drag all these little hide
36:34 - codes
36:35 - into the second one as well
36:44 - that's going to be a big part of this
36:45 - game is just hiding the sprites until
36:48 - you go to their store
36:52 - and you can do it a number of different
36:54 - ways
36:57 - you don't have to just do what i'm
36:58 - saying
37:02 - okay i'm going to go ahead and lay these
37:03 - out so i can see them neatly
37:14 - okay let's go ahead and let's now make
37:17 - the
37:17 - candy store button
37:22 - so same thing i got a picture of the
37:24 - outside of a candy store
37:26 - called sweeties candy warehouse it is a
37:29 - real place and it's awesome i've been
37:31 - there
37:32 - in cleveland it is fantastic it has tons
37:35 - and tons of different types of candy
37:36 - that
37:37 - i've never seen before and i've seen a
37:39 - lot of candies
37:40 - okay so i want to shrink this down to be
37:42 - sort of sort of kind of the same size
37:45 - as the other stores now i'm going to go
37:47 - into the fire shop
37:49 - or the fire fire the pizza shop
37:52 - and i'm just gonna go ahead and drag and
37:54 - drop some of this code
37:55 - into my candy store button
37:59 - now let's go ahead and make the candy
38:00 - store backdrop
38:04 - so when we actually click that little
38:06 - candy store button
38:08 - where do we go well i grabbed this fun
38:11 - little
38:11 - um minecraft type roblox type
38:15 - background it's just tons of different
38:17 - colors it reminds me of candy
38:20 - so i went ahead and made that as a
38:22 - backdrop
38:23 - called candyland and i'm going to go
38:26 - ahead and just resize it and fill it all
38:28 - the way up so it takes up the entire
38:30 - screen of candy candyland
38:43 - okay now let's go back to the candy
38:46 - store button that we just created
38:48 - and say when we receive when this spread
38:52 - is clicked broadcast candyland which is
38:54 - a new broadcast
38:55 - and then go to the backdrop of candyland
38:58 - now let's go into the bad guy and let's
39:01 - hide him
39:03 - from candyland and basically anything
39:05 - else that he
39:06 - that is not the flower shop so he
39:09 - shouldn't be seen in the lottery the
39:11 - pizza store
39:11 - the candy land all he should be seen is
39:14 - in the flower
39:15 - all right so step 18 let's make the
39:17 - candy store
39:19 - code um so let's go into
39:23 - or let's make the candy store guy so i
39:26 - the easiest thing to do is just
39:27 - duplicate
39:28 - the flower store guy and then change his
39:31 - colors
39:32 - so there's our flower shop guy in red
39:34 - now we're going to change him to
39:37 - wearing all purple and having a yellow
39:39 - hair and beard
39:41 - and sometimes i have to redraw the beard
39:43 - and the hair a little bit because i get
39:45 - too
39:45 - happy with the colors okay looking good
39:48 - all right where is this okay i want to
39:50 - color recolor all of these
39:53 - so i pick a nice purple
39:57 - and then i use my eyedropper i can pick
39:59 - that yellow and just recolor his beard
40:02 - and his hair
40:04 - then use the eyedropper and grab that
40:06 - same purple and recolor
40:08 - and recolor his beard and his hair no
40:10 - problem
40:14 - and i like to do this because i like to
40:15 - color
40:18 - and again sometimes i have to redraw the
40:20 - outline a little bit
40:23 - but it does not take long and then that
40:25 - way i have everybody looking the same
40:27 - that's why i like to use the same
40:29 - sprites
40:32 - and i like to use the same code
40:36 - all right step 19 code the candy store
40:39 - guy
40:41 - so he's gonna have the exact same code
40:43 - as the flower shop guy
40:45 - so let's make sure he's running right
40:47 - right right
40:49 - now he's running left left left left
40:52 - left left
40:55 - awesome now let's go into his code
41:01 - and make sure that his costumes are all
41:04 - correct
41:05 - so they say purple right and purple left
41:12 - just check all of his codes now when we
41:15 - receive the broadcast message candyland
41:17 - not flowers
41:18 - because we're now in the candy store and
41:21 - make sure that his run codes are correct
41:23 - now when again switch the bat the
41:25 - broadcast message on this
41:27 - and then when he's touching we haven't
41:30 - made
41:31 - anything for him to um use
41:34 - as his earning money in his store
41:38 - so i'm just going to leave some of these
41:41 - just as placeholders
41:45 - but we're going to end up changing them
41:46 - so it's changed by two and negative two
41:49 - we can change that now and let's just
41:52 - get rid of those says
41:56 - all right so our purple guy our purple
41:57 - sprite um
41:59 - is working really nicely for having
42:02 - spent just like a couple minutes on him
42:04 - and that's why it's awesome to duplicate
42:07 - all right so duplicate that
42:09 - when i receive so instead of flowers
42:11 - when i receive pizza store i hide
42:15 - because he does not belong in the pizza
42:17 - store
42:19 - okay there he is
42:23 - there he is running up left
42:27 - down terrific all right
42:30 - step 20. let's go ahead and code um some
42:33 - candy hearts
42:34 - to make this more into a job for him
42:38 - so let's go ahead and go to choose a
42:42 - sprite
42:44 - and in the search bar let's type
42:49 - candy and there's our heart candy
42:52 - and then let's go ahead and go into the
42:54 - costume because i need to change this
42:56 - costume
42:58 - so instead of it just saying
43:01 - code it and and being in these light
43:04 - colors
43:05 - i want to change them to my own colors
43:07 - that i like better and i'm going to get
43:08 - rid of that coated
43:10 - so i made the heart smaller so it's
43:12 - easier so it's harder to grab
43:14 - we don't want the job to be too easy
43:18 - and let's just go ahead and delete the
43:20 - rest of these other hearts
43:22 - they're too big now um let's go ahead
43:25 - and duplicate
43:26 - this candy heart and give it a different
43:29 - color just to make the game a little bit
43:31 - more of our own
43:32 - that color is fine i like to keep these
43:35 - colors nice and light
43:39 - and let's get like maybe a little purple
43:43 - and then duplicate the purple heart
43:48 - maybe a little pink
43:53 - okay um now let's go ahead and add some
43:57 - code to our hearts
44:01 - so when green flag is clicked we're
44:03 - going to hide
44:04 - because we're only going to show the
44:06 - hearts when we receive
44:08 - the candyland message or we're in the
44:10 - candy shop
44:12 - okay so when we receive candyland
44:16 - message we show our hearts
44:20 - candy hearts let's duplicate
44:24 - when we receive the flower message we
44:26 - hide
44:27 - and i'll just go through those other
44:29 - hides now when we receive candyland
44:33 - let's do a forever loop and wait 0.2
44:35 - seconds
44:41 - then we'll switch costumes so he's
44:42 - always turning different costume colors
44:45 - now let's make him move a little bit and
44:48 - let's wait point another point
44:50 - two seconds
44:55 - and then we'll make him move jump to
44:56 - random position
44:58 - okey dokey and that's just like the
45:01 - bread
45:02 - so let's click um candy store the sprite
45:06 - takes us to this cool background
45:09 - the heart is working awesome all right
45:12 - let's go
45:12 - back
45:17 - into our candy store guy and let's do a
45:20 - couple of things here
45:21 - let's start him off in a position to the
45:24 - bottom left
45:25 - so whatever coordinates you have on the
45:27 - bottom left let's go ahead and start the
45:28 - game there
45:30 - so i'm going to put under when i receive
45:32 - candyland show and then go to
45:34 - x at those coordinates
45:39 - 180 and minus 100. now
45:43 - let's go ahead and change this in our
45:45 - when i receive candyland
45:46 - in my forever loop if i'm touching
45:51 - the heart candy then make money goes up
45:54 - by two
46:01 - okay now let's go ahead and duplicate
46:03 - that um pink heart
46:04 - those those little cute hearts and let's
46:07 - go into the costume this is gonna be the
46:09 - let's turn this into the bad guy
46:10 - of the candyland store all right so
46:12 - let's get rid of the all but one
46:15 - costume of the heart
46:18 - and we're gonna call this a bad heart
46:21 - it's a bad candy let's turn it a rotten
46:25 - color candy
46:26 - dark and maybe like a dark red
46:29 - okay so this heart has some this bad
46:32 - heart has some code already with it
46:35 - so let's speed it up instead of point
46:37 - two let's make it point one
46:40 - go to candy store now it's flipping all
46:42 - over the place okay good there it is
46:46 - all over okay now let's go back into the
46:48 - candy store guy
46:50 - code and when we touch that bad heart
46:52 - let's do minus two
46:56 - now let's play a little bit see if i can
46:58 - make this score
47:00 - go up and down
47:08 - seems to be working good good good
47:12 - okay now let's do um a little bit of a
47:15 - say
47:16 - on each of these so
47:19 - when we touch the bad candy heart let's
47:21 - say oh no for two seconds
47:25 - and we touch the good candy heart let's
47:27 - say
47:30 - yummy for two seconds okay let's try it
47:33 - out yummy
47:34 - yummy oh no
47:38 - all right step 21 let's make the pizza
47:40 - shop guy so the
47:41 - we're doing the exact same thing with
47:43 - the
47:44 - pizza shop guy that we did with the
47:46 - candy store so let's just duplicate that
47:47 - candy store guy
47:49 - go ahead and rename him pizza shop guy
47:51 - now
47:52 - go ahead and color him differently
47:56 - i did brown hair and a yellow suit
48:02 - and i make all my rights and then i make
48:05 - all my lefts
48:06 - and i make sure that they're grouped
48:07 - together
48:09 - it's just easier to code them that way
48:16 - okay and i'm just using my eyedropper
48:18 - tool so i get the colors
48:20 - exactly the same from costume to costume
48:23 - just so he looks as good as he can
48:32 - good and i love the coloring process
48:36 - it's super easy super fun and then that
48:38 - way they all look
48:39 - exactly the same
48:59 - almost done
49:04 - okay and we only have a couple more
49:06 - things to do in this game before it's
49:08 - done
49:09 - okay let's keep coloring and there's the
49:12 - brown
49:13 - and brown and one more guy to go brown
49:16 - yellow whoops yellow okay
49:20 - awesome all right let's code the pizza
49:23 - shop guy so we just have to make a
49:24 - couple of changes
49:26 - and then his code will be good
49:30 - so when we receive pizza shop
49:33 - we're going to show
49:36 - good and if you haven't made the pizza
49:38 - shop broadcast message just go ahead and
49:40 - make it
49:41 - and then we show when we have the
49:44 - backdrop to pizza shop
49:46 - and we hide it when it's green flag
49:48 - click and we hide it when it flowers and
49:50 - we hide it when it's candyland and we
49:52 - hide him when
49:54 - we're in the home backdrop so there's
49:57 - all kinds of hiding to do
49:59 - with these candy store
50:02 - all right make sure his costumes are
50:04 - correct
50:06 - which they all should be because the
50:08 - candy store was cracked so the flower
50:10 - so that this guy copied it so he should
50:12 - be correct all right go ahead and change
50:14 - that broadcast message to pizza store
50:17 - and broadcast message to pizza store now
50:19 - what we're gonna do is
50:21 - instead of touching candy heart or heart
50:23 - candy we're gonna get rid of that
50:25 - because we're gonna be doing some bread
50:27 - so these can just be placeholders for a
50:29 - minute we're gonna change this by one
50:32 - and negative one because the pizza shop
50:35 - should be the easiest
50:36 - because the bread isn't super small
50:46 - all right so let's go ahead and make the
50:47 - pizza shop breads and then we'll finish
50:49 - the rest of the coat on the pizza shop
50:51 - guy
50:53 - so go into choose a sprite
50:57 - and then in the search bar type in bread
51:02 - and there's a little loaf of bread
51:06 - fabulous
51:08 - and that's just the right size you can
51:10 - adjust the size if you want okay when we
51:12 - receive the pizza shop
51:13 - broadcast message then what do we do
51:17 - then we do our forever loop
51:25 - then we do wait 0.2 seconds
51:34 - and next costume although i'm not sure
51:35 - i'm gonna do another costume for bread
51:38 - i might just leave that one costume but
51:41 - maybe you can do a different costume and
51:42 - flip it around
51:43 - okay and wait point two seconds and then
51:45 - go to random position
51:51 - all right let's go to home go to pizza
51:53 - shop and there's the bread and it's
51:54 - flipping all over the place
51:56 - yay or it's jumping all over the place i
51:58 - should say
51:59 - and there's our pizza shop guy and he
52:01 - can go up and down and right and left
52:04 - fabulous it's working all right let's
52:07 - hit stop
52:11 - now let's go into our black
52:15 - heart for a minute something's showing
52:18 - oh okay
52:18 - let's actually let's drag some of these
52:21 - um
52:23 - show and hides into our bread
52:28 - because we're gonna need the same things
52:30 - in our bread we only want the bread
52:32 - to be seen inside the pizza shop that
52:34 - makes sense
52:35 - right
52:42 - let me rearrange this code nicer and
52:44 - let's go ahead and
52:46 - do some duplicates of this so
52:49 - when i receive pizza shop i show
52:53 - my bread
53:01 - duplicate
53:05 - when i receive candy store
53:12 - i don't want my bread to show in the
53:14 - candy store
53:17 - okay it doesn't look like it's there
53:18 - good
53:23 - all right let's go back into the candy
53:25 - store the pizza shop guy
53:27 - so let's go ahead and adjust this so if
53:31 - i
53:32 - receive my pizza shop broadcast message
53:35 - forever
53:36 - i'm in a loop if i touch the bread
53:41 - then my money goes up by one
53:44 - and i wait 0.1 seconds
53:53 - okay and i'm also going to go to say
53:59 - yes
54:07 - and i'll duplicate that red
54:10 - and go into costume and this is i'm
54:12 - going to make a green bread because this
54:14 - is the yucky bread you don't want to
54:15 - touch this bread
54:16 - so let's make that green all over
54:27 - and let's wait point one second and
54:30 - point one second
54:31 - in our green bread and let's
54:34 - get rid of that next costume and let's
54:38 - just
54:38 - so it's just gonna wait point one second
54:39 - then it's just gonna go to random
54:40 - position all over
54:42 - and we're gonna say yes when we catch
54:44 - the brown bread
54:52 - and then when we touch the green bread
54:55 - or the bad bread whatever we want to
54:57 - call it
55:01 - let's call it bad bread
55:15 - then it's gonna be minus one all right
55:16 - step 24 let's make the play the lotto
55:19 - button
55:20 - so this is our fourth button that we're
55:21 - making
55:23 - so let's go into paint
55:26 - in our backdrop and let's just make a
55:30 - plain white background that says lottery
55:33 - now let's go into choose a sprite and
55:36 - let's
55:36 - i typed in the the um description
55:40 - button and i got this little green
55:41 - button and i just added the text play
55:43 - the lotto
55:44 - now for the code let's go into
55:48 - when
55:51 - we receive lotto
55:56 - show actually when we receive home
55:59 - show and then when this sprite is
56:01 - clicked
56:06 - switch back drop to lottery perfect
56:15 - and then let's go ahead and add when
56:17 - green flag is clicked
56:24 - show because we always want the lotto
56:26 - button to show it's sort of like the
56:27 - home button
56:28 - step 25 make the click me button to
56:32 - lay the lotto yay okay this is that big
56:35 - rectangle that i made
56:36 - that you might have seen earlier so we
56:39 - want sort of a light
56:41 - yellow and a light green rectangle one
56:43 - inside the other
56:45 - so there's rectangle one
56:49 - there's rectangle two and i'll just put
56:50 - that to the background
56:52 - and then let's go ahead and type click
56:56 - me
56:58 - let's make it a little bit bigger and
57:01 - then let's go ahead and type
57:03 - one dollar scratch off ticket
57:08 - one in ten chances
57:12 - winning
57:17 - you don't have to do one in ten you can
57:19 - do one in 20 you can do one in 100
57:21 - you can do one in five all right let's
57:24 - create some new variables so new
57:25 - variable name
57:26 - winning number
57:30 - and this is inside that click me sprite
57:32 - that we just made
57:34 - and new variable name your
57:37 - number guess
57:41 - and we don't have to leave those out
57:42 - there we can for now okay so broadcast
57:44 - new message
57:48 - number
57:52 - and let's make another broadcast message
57:55 - new
57:58 - message one message i won
58:02 - and then let's duplicate that and this
58:04 - can be a message lost
58:05 - or message i lost message i lost
58:12 - okay so number i want i lost three
58:14 - different new broadcast messages
58:16 - all right let's create a new backdrop
58:17 - that says one
58:20 - and let's just make this green do you
58:21 - remember this from the beginning of the
58:23 - video a big green backdrop
58:27 - and we're going to add some text just to
58:29 - let the people know that they won the
58:30 - lotto they guessed the correct number
58:32 - from one to ten
58:34 - all right so at the bottom let's put
58:36 - some text in black
58:37 - we're almost done congratulations
58:44 - you won click me
58:48 - to play again
58:55 - awesome okay and let's duplicate that
58:58 - background
58:59 - that backdrop and let's make it red
59:02 - except let's not go ahead and say
59:04 - congratulations because this is what
59:06 - they get when they lost
59:07 - so instead of congratulations we're
59:09 - gonna put sorry
59:14 - you lost click me to play again
59:17 - because they can certainly play again
59:20 - and move that over a little bit now in
59:22 - the click me
59:23 - um code we have our new broadcast
59:26 - messages we have some hides
59:28 - and we have a show
59:32 - so when this sprite is clicked if
59:36 - make money is
59:39 - less than zero
59:44 - or is less than one and it can be equal
59:46 - to zero or less than zero two
59:48 - there's a lot of different ways you can
59:49 - do this say
59:55 - you must make money to play the lotto
60:12 - elves choose
60:14 - a number from one to ten
60:18 - between one and ten that's better
60:21 - between i like that better
60:24 - so when this sprite is clicked if your
60:26 - money is less than one you can't play
60:29 - else you're telling the person to choose
60:32 - a number between one and ten
60:34 - then you're gonna say
60:42 - join i bet you know what we're going to
60:44 - do
60:46 - answer
60:50 - bye this is your guess
60:53 - you can leave a little blank too so it's
60:54 - not out crowded is
60:56 - your guess so if i type two it will say
60:59 - my answer is your guess for two seconds
61:03 - it's just a little makes it more
61:04 - interactive so that people know that
61:06 - something's happening
61:08 - okay then we set
61:17 - your number guess two
61:20 - you guessed it the answer
61:29 - and something's gonna happen if it's
61:30 - right or wrong
61:34 - it's so simple then broadcast number
61:38 - the message or new message
61:41 - number we already did that one so
61:45 - broadcast number
61:46 - we're not going to do too much with the
61:47 - broadcast number right here but you
61:48 - could do like a high score
61:51 - set winning number
61:55 - so it's good to have that in there two
62:01 - pick random one to ten so that's where
62:03 - the code is picking a number for us
62:10 - and then pick an if-then-else statement
62:23 - if winning number
62:28 - equals
62:32 - your number guess then
62:36 - change
62:39 - make money by one
62:42 - yay and if not change winning number by
62:46 - negative one
62:49 - and also let's go ahead and add in there
62:53 - our broadcast message i won
62:56 - and then a broadcast message i lost
63:00 - super simple
63:04 - now what happens when you win and lose
63:07 - so if the broadcast message says i lost
63:11 - then i want to switch backdrops to the
63:13 - lost backdrop which is that red one
63:17 - and then if the winning if the um
63:20 - message
63:20 - says i won
63:26 - then i want to switch the backdrop to
63:28 - one which is the green backdrop
63:33 - i just have one one nothing and one two
63:36 - i didn't switch the names okay so let's
63:39 - try it out
63:41 - click me pick a number between one and
63:44 - ten
63:44 - and i chose it and i lost all right
63:48 - awesome almost done step 26 let's make
63:51 - some background music i suggest
63:53 - different background music
63:54 - for every store so all you do go to
63:58 - freesounds.org
63:59 - download some music
64:02 - then go into your store
64:06 - so i'm in my flower shop and i go to
64:10 - sounds upload a sound
64:23 - and it's importing and let's i always
64:26 - rename it
64:27 - because it comes out with this crazy
64:29 - sound so flower shop
64:31 - background music or background
64:36 - and then we just have to code it
64:44 - okay that sounds good you guys can't
64:46 - hear it but it sounds good on my end
64:49 - now when i receive the message flowers
64:56 - forever
65:02 - play my song
65:05 - okay so let's test it out go to my
65:06 - flower store got you
65:12 - good and there's my lotto button there's
65:13 - my make money there's my home button
65:15 - awesome and my score is changing
65:18 - terrific
65:20 - got you got you
65:24 - all right step 27 this is our last step
65:27 - less than a minute to go
65:29 - let's make some directions on our
65:30 - homepage
65:32 - so go to our home page and write
65:36 - where would you like to
65:39 - work question mark pizza shop easiest
65:42 - one dollar
65:44 - per bread candy store harder
65:47 - two dollars per candy heart flower store
65:51 - hardest three dollars per bug
65:55 - you're done congratulations all right
65:58 - let's go ahead and
65:59 - show that text just on the home page and
66:03 - hide it everywhere else
66:06 - and you know how to do this because
66:08 - you've done this with all the different
66:09 - sprites
66:12 - it's just a game
