06:07 - a folder on my desktop called husky
06:11 - awesome okay so the next thing that we
06:15 - want to do
06:16 - is to open up our scratch
06:20 - and create a new page
06:23 - and i have logged in so i can
06:26 - share and save my work um
06:29 - we are just going to flip through
06:32 - the pictures of the huskies after we
06:35 - upload them and we're going to upload
06:37 - them as backdrops
06:39 - so um let's go ahead and create our very
06:42 - first backdrop
06:43 - so i am in the bottom right hand side of
06:46 - my
06:46 - page and i'm going to go to
06:50 - choose a backdrop and for my beginning
06:54 - backdrop where i'm just going to welcome
06:56 - people
06:56 - and tell people what this slideshow is
06:59 - all about
07:00 - i think i'm going to just pick something
07:01 - really super plain like the circles
07:04 - and then in the circles
07:08 - i'm going to go to my backdrops tab
07:11 - and i'm going to click inside the
07:15 - costume here of my backdrops
07:18 - and i'm going to add some text
07:21 - so i click on my text tool
07:24 - and i'm going to go ahead and choose the
07:26 - color red
07:29 - and i am going to say five
07:33 - husky
07:35 - [Music]
07:39 - and that's really super small
07:44 - so i'm going to select it
07:48 - i want to make it that big i'm going to
07:49 - make it a little bit bigger
07:53 - and i'll try and center it just a little
07:55 - bit
07:56 - [Music]
07:57 - now i still am having like a little bit
07:59 - of trouble seeing that
08:02 - so i'm going to draw a rectangle
08:05 - right over the husky text
08:11 - and i am going to push it backward
08:16 - so it sort of highlights my text five
08:19 - husky pictures
08:21 - okay perfect now let's go ahead and
08:24 - let's
08:25 - upload those pictures that we just got
08:27 - from pixabay
08:28 - so i go to the bottom right hand of my
08:31 - screen
08:32 - and i have several options here choose a
08:35 - backdrop
08:37 - choose a backdrop paint
08:40 - surprise and finally upload backdrop so
08:44 - that this is what we want to choose
08:46 - upload backdrop so i'm going to go ahead
08:48 - and click on it
08:48 - [Music]
08:51 - and it takes me to my downloads
08:54 - folder but i know what folder i really
08:57 - want i want to go to my desktop
09:00 - and i want to go to the folder that i
09:01 - just created for this project
09:03 - called husky so i double click on it
09:06 - and the first picture that i want to
09:08 - choose is
09:09 - husky face picture which is just this
09:12 - really great close-up picture
09:14 - all right that's awesome now um i'm
09:17 - going to go ahead and play with this a
09:18 - little bit so i sort of like the way
09:20 - it's
09:20 - looking right here in my preview screen
09:23 - if i wanted to i could convert it to a
09:25 - vector just by clicking on it
09:28 - and then i could select it and make it
09:30 - bigger
09:32 - i don't have to do that but if i wanted
09:35 - to try and just sort of
09:37 - um fill this screen
09:41 - i could do that and let me try and pull
09:42 - it over a little bit
09:44 - now i don't want to just distort the
09:46 - picture too much and i can't really see
09:48 - the top of his little ears which are so
09:49 - cute
09:50 - so i'm gonna pull it down and i've sort
09:52 - of made him a little wider
09:54 - than he needs to be so i'll just
09:58 - go from i'll drag from the corner
10:02 - and then that makes him a little bit
10:04 - less wide
10:07 - i want him to fill the picture though so
10:09 - i'm going to keep him like that
10:11 - now i'm going to go ahead and do these
10:14 - same steps again
10:15 - four more times so i go to the corner of
10:19 - the right hand of my screen and i go all
10:22 - the way up to
10:23 - upload a backdrop i click on it
10:27 - and i think i want a picture of
10:30 - several dogs now so i'll do this
10:33 - huskies pulling the sled the huskies in
10:36 - the harness
10:38 - and that's really beautiful too so i'm
10:42 - going to go ahead
10:42 - and select the convert to
10:46 - vector then i'm going to click on it and
10:48 - i'm going to pull from the corner
10:51 - to try and keep the proportions a little
10:53 - bit
10:55 - the way they are in the picture
10:58 - and i'm gonna just pull this out and
11:01 - then i'll
11:02 - center it a little bit better
11:05 - [Music]
11:07 - and beautiful oh these are great
11:10 - pictures

11:54 - it
11:56 - i'm going to like move this over a
11:58 - little tiny bit
12:00 - [Music]
