hello everybody my name is nyan i'm the black female engineer i provide content for new and aspiring software engineers and today we're going to be talking about github readme now if this is not your first video you know make sure you hit that subscribe button it really helps me out really helps support my channel and so also make sure you follow me on instagram you can engage with me more there and so yeah let's just build this community now the github project we're going to be working with is an old project of mine while it's going through coding boot camp it's called piggy for piggy bank it was a financial literacy uh like web app where people would track their expenses and then see like a chart auto populate of the proportions of you know their expenses going to wear and all of that so yeah we're going to work with that so let's get to it so this is what our readme is going to look like we're going to go into very deep detail about how to make it look like this but i wanted to show you what the end result is code examples picky features status why contact and license so let's scroll back up and click on yeah click on edit you all would have a blank like default readme that github would have created automatically after you create a repo it would have just like just default stuff and so you'd click this pencil button to edit it so right away the first thing we want to do is tell people what this app is what is the title of your app and you know make that the first thing they see and so we do that in github by putting this you know hashtag pound symbol um and then followed by a space and then the title you want your audience to see so for me that was piggy web app front end i've also done it where it's just the name of the app and front end i always make sure it says front end or back and because for me i never have combined projects i make sure that there's always a separation of concern that's really for me the most efficient way to develop and so my repos always say front end or back end and so there that was and then there's the table of contents so in github your headers start with a pound or one hashtag and then your sub headers are two hashtags and so everything else in here are two hashtags and the next thing i put here are the table of contents so that people can very quickly from the getgo know what to expect out of this readme without having to parse through it all but we're going to get back to this and there's actually something really cool about the table of contents which i really like so we're going to get back here because for me the table of contents is always something i do last because it's based on the structure of the readme and so if i don't know the structure yet how can i create a table of contents i i it's no so so i always do that last and so we'll get back to that but now the next thing i do is provide an about x and x app so about piggy and so i just say how piggy is an expense tracker for users it gives users insights as to what's in their piggy bank by being by providing a list breakdown of all of the expenses they log and it also provides users with resources on to better their financial literacy and so you know it doesn't have to be you know some wall street journal article or anything just something quick and just saying look this is what this is about because here's the thing you want to remember that a lot of people who are going to your github specifically i tailor things like this to recruiters when i'm looking specifically for when i'm looking for a job and recruiters don't have the time to open the app and try it out themselves and go into their code base especially because a lot of recruiters aren't engineers themselves so they likely don't know how to deal with all of this and so i try to just provide them with all the information they need on my apps on my projects without them actually needing to go into the code same thing with people who would interview you they those people may be engineers maybe project managers so they may have you know the better abilities to actually go through your code and things like that but still odds are they won't so just provide them with something easy to look at and just see what you're about and so on that theme the next thing i would always provide was a walkthrough video of my app i would film the walkthrough the same way i'm doing here just putting you know quicktime player screen record and hitting play and i would really just the video was always just me using it i wouldn't really explain um like the technologies i used i wouldn't i wouldn't really explain anything i would just be a user providing um and showing what the user experience would look like so they'd be very quick videos one to three minutes depending on how big the app was so in github the way to add you know links to certain texts so that it's the text that shows and not the link but once they click on the text they go to that link it's by putting brackets let me do it here it's by putting brackets putting text within brackets so you can say click me if you wanted a link that said that and then if you wanted it to go to google.com like that and that's how you do it you would put the url within parentheses make sure you don't have a space having a space changes um the ability for it to be linked so you wouldn't put a space just back to back and so so i can show you what this now looks like let's see let's zoom out a little tiny bit okay so you see now click me and i'm not going to click it because we haven't saved certain changes and it might mess things up so yeah now you can say click me and you see how there's no link being shown or anything no um url being shown yeah so that's something really cool about github that i really really like so i use that really everywhere where were we oh right here so yeah you have to click me right here but i'll take it out from now so the next thing i do is provide a list of technologies that i used in creating this frontend portion or backend portion depending on what portion you're on for me it's end so defining the technologies i used the languages i used the frameworks i used for me this was built in vanilla javascript so i didn't use any frameworks like react angular view i didn't use any of those it was just javascript and so i put javascript es6 and then html css and i wanted to put the versions there um just so this readme withstands the test of time and i always know what version i used no matter how long time goes by you know things like that because that affects you know certain variables and scope and functions and things like that what version you use so that's why i put that there but yeah if i had used a framework i also would have included you know react and angular and things like that but yeah i list the technology so that the recruiter seeing this the interviewer seeing this can can see that i am not lying on my resume during my interviews when i say i'm proficient in javascript i'm proficient in angular things like that then i go down to the setup so the setup this is something that um honestly it's kind of like my least favorite part um even though it's so small but these setup i use this section to just provide people seeing um this read me just the instructions on how to have the project on their local computers um to mess around with and play around with on their own so they're not playing around my code no no i don't i don't play those games but they themselves can um you know alter things and see how the code really works and things like that and really just fostering their own learning that is where the license at the bottom comes up though so we'll get to that but yes i provide setup instructions and so i say to run this project please go to the backend repo which i made sure i linked to the actual github url all the urls here are you know adjusted so that certain confidential information of mine stays confidential but yeah you would have the full url here that would connect to the back end repo of this project because yeah you for me for this app you needed both a back end and a front end which were separate then two after you follow the instructions on the back end repo whatever was provided there run light server in your front end directory then click here and then that was the local host you know 2001 so they can preview the app on their local machine instead of looking on youtube or things like that now i find this section so so so so important code examples code examples was just somewhere i put you know some type of um look into how i develop how i use functions how i create you know the functions and the variables and things like that and just showing like look this is yeah what i can do and so it's a very small of course like when it comes to the entire project this is point zero one percent of the entire project but it's still nice to see that you know the person actually okay they can create a iterative function they can um create like work with arrays and map through them and all of that and so i provided code examples now to provide code examples this is what you do you provide these backticks so not an apostrophe like this for me i use a macbook and so um this backtick is under the escape button on the top left of my keyboard so if you're also on the macbook on the top left of your keyboard um it's under this kit for me so for me it's the second button down from the top left that is where you put the backtick if you can't find it it's the same button as this like sideways s right here i know there's a name for it someone comment the name please for this i can't think of the name but um yeah it's the same uh button as this sideways s but it's the back tick portion so you do three of the back ticks then put example here and then you close it out with three more backticks and so let's see what it looks like in preview mode so preview changes let's zoom out and see you see how now it has its own little section right here the example here yes that's why code examples um specifically like using backticks is important because it really shows it as like code with i hope if you can't see what i'm talking about maybe bring your brightness down a little bit let's see can i bring my brightness down i feel like that doesn't help anything but yeah it creates these like little boxes this these like super light gray boxes around the code so that it really differentiates text from code and then i had provided different code examples two code examples and so it breaks them up into their own portions and so that's very important both for the look and also just the functionality of this readme and so let's go back to the editing of this go back to code examples and yeah now just take that out and so for me i wouldn't type this in readme specifically it i would just look through my app because the readme was always created after the app was finished always um if i if i was eager i would maybe put an about but really nothing else because the thing is you think you're creating one app and then a month goes by and you're finished and you realize it's a whole different app and so it's just better to leave things like readmes and all of that to the very end so that you're not in this loop of constantly editing your readmes and all of these different things so anyway yeah i would go into my code go into my project and find somewhere that i liked what i put you know and i would want it to be just a couple of lines like five to eight lines of code um and yeah make sure it was as efficient as possible something something to say like look like i write decent code for the level i'm in or something like that so then i would just copy and paste it and then put the backticks before before the back ticks after that coding section and so i did two different examples so that's why there's the two sets of the backticks i hope that made sense i really really hope it did but no we're just moving along here so next we have the piggy features this was where i provided the reader with what to expect with this app so input and track expenses visualize expenses through a colored donut chart and then provide finance and budgeting resources then i provided a todo list part of the piggy features because i wanted to also just show that i have plans for this app i i don't consider myself done i never with specifically app development i never consider myself done it's app development and just development in general is something that you can constantly go at over and over so i always provided a todo list and for here it was ad expense breakdown options labeling expense type status completed this app is built to carry out the crutch framework crud so crud stands for create read update delete basically every well maybe not every app but basically the core of most apps is to carry out the crud framework if you think about facebook instagram blogs you want to be able to create a post read other people's posts update your own posts or your own um what you call it wall or your own you know update pictures update any things like that or delete pictures delete post delete blog posts so that's really the base of um i say kind of every app but i may be wrong with every but with most apps that's the base you always want to see so yeah i say this app is built to carry out the crud framework then down here i say why i decided to create this specific app and it's the same thing um i shared with you all just moments ago because i care about financial literacy as a finance major myself and so i wanted to provide a resource for individuals to do the same to be their best selves when it comes to money habits and things like that then at the bottom here is some of the most important portions i would put a contact field in which i linked my name to my linkedin so created by and then my name in the brackets because i wanted it to directly link to my linkedin and so like my linkedin like url so it would be like slash like nia something like that and so then in the actual readme they'd be just able to click on my name it would take them to my linkedin then license so the license part is what allows other viewers other readers to use your code to develop with your code um but also say like hey you can't just steal this or you can maybe they can and that's okay with you i personally don't play those games but saying like yeah you can use this um but at the end of the day this is my work you can use it for your own learning and development and things like that but this is my work and so the license i'm going to have to look um here i'll make sure to actually provide a link to the license because i always use the same exact license every time so i'll provide a link to the license in the description box because i can't specifically remember i think i just searched github license types there were three main types i saw um like the three most popular ones and i chose one that i just preferred but um yeah i'll link the license um down in the description box that way it's just one less thing for you all to do and so yeah there we go and so then we would we would click commit changes i'm not going to go all the way down because some personal information is down there but um i'll just go into the preview that way you can see what it would look like so yeah oh shoot hold on wait a minute i am so sorry i forgot about the table of contents that is my bad y'all i'm so sorry so table of contents so table of contents i would go in and look at each of the sections i put in and in brackets place all of those sections here now we're talking about linking to link to outside resources we use the parentheses and the you know just the url to link inside your own readme you use a hashtag so you do i'll draw at the bottom here so i'll say example oh no hold on so i'll say example within brackets and then right away no space or anything right away you put parentheses and then you say whatever the name of that header was so example dash header there are no spaces allowed if there's a space you replace it with the dash so you see how about piggy has a space right here and the table of content name is about so to link to it i was i put hashtag about dash piggy then you see how underneath it's piggy walk through video and then but all i name it here in the table of contents is video so i would put hashtag piggy dash walkthrough dash video in the parentheses and so if we look at the preview again it would just be about video technology setup but it links to the different portions and so if i click it i'll wait let me get out of this so i will be right back hey all we're back so we have our table of contents let's say i want to jump right into code examples right away so i click code examples and it jumps you see how the screen jumps to that section and so now if i scroll back up i see all the other sections that were before it and i can you know go back to table of contents if i want to jump to the license i click license boom jumps right to the license the license is the last part of the page and so that's why it's not like up here because there's nothing to show below that but anyway but yeah so it jumps the license that's why the table of contents is important it is just a nice efficient way of providing the user with a more seamless easy experience and you know we're developers y'all like all we want to do is provide seamless efficient experiences to our users and so that does not change with readme and honestly if you're looking at you know companies and things like that it's that shows them that like no you think about the user process first you think about their experience first and they see that in these examples features piggy features boom just so i can show you just a little bit of the license i think you guys would appreciate seeing that this is what it is so the license is a you know for me it was like just a general license and yeah it provides like the rights and copyrights and the yada yada yada so make sure you're putting that in your readme because if you're building the next uber we don't want someone you know from down the hall who just stumbled upon your readme to get those millions y'all that's important don't forget to hit that subscribe button i hope you liked this really comprehensive detailed look into creating a really nice standard readme for your projects and yeah please let me know if you have any questions down below but don't forget to follow me on instagram at the black female engineer and i look forward to see y'all later so no bye all
