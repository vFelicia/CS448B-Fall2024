With timestamps:

00:03 - hello everybody good to see you
00:06 - hope this thing is on my name is Eric
00:09 - also known as speak busy on scratch so
00:11 - excited to have you all here for our
00:13 - create along
00:14 - hopefully this is working you might be
00:16 - wondering where is Zoey who is normally
00:18 - the host of the creative long sorry
00:20 - you're stuck with me today
00:21 - Zoey unfortunately lost her voice and is
00:23 - resting it so I'm gonna be walking me
00:26 - all through this next hour where we're
00:28 - going to be working on our own video
00:30 - sensing projects with scratch and so if
00:33 - you're completely new and have never
00:35 - been to a create along the idea is we're
00:38 - gonna for the next hour to work on the
00:40 - project
00:40 - I'll be here answering your questions
00:43 - and we're gonna hopefully there's a lot
00:46 - of tech in front of me right now this is
00:47 - my first time kind of doing this so
00:49 - there's computer here there's computer
00:51 - back there I actually have Zoey in the
00:52 - background and she's helping with the
00:54 - questions giving feedback how the texts
00:56 - working I got Jacy looking at the
00:59 - questions too so shout out to both of
01:00 - them behind the scenes so if you're new
01:03 - welcome and if you've already been here
01:05 - thanks for coming back and so I guess
01:08 - the idea is what we want to start with
01:10 - is just talking a bit about how the
01:14 - cradle longs are sort of a good
01:15 - opportunity for us now that we find
01:17 - ourselves sort of at home I think this
01:19 - is a great opportunity for us to sort of
01:21 - come together and to connect and to
01:23 - share and there's nothing better that I
01:25 - like to do on my downtime think rate
01:26 - with scratched and today I'm going to be
01:28 - showing you some amazing things you can
01:30 - do with video sensing and so to give a
01:32 - quick pitch video sensing is essentially
01:34 - controlling your scratch project without
01:36 - using your keyboard we'll talk more
01:38 - about this it sounds kind of fake but I
01:40 - trust me it's real and we'll do that so
01:43 - what we're going to do now is sort of
01:45 - talk about what the the hour is gonna
01:49 - look like and so I'm gonna pull up two
01:51 - super fancy graphic that we have that is
01:53 - the plan for today I hope that works
01:56 - also everything is mirrored so I have to
01:58 - point the opposite way at the point of
02:00 - things so we'll go ahead and walk
02:02 - through the schedule for today so today
02:05 - we're gonna gather so we've totally done
02:07 - that happy to see it there's 70 people
02:10 - all around the world that's super
02:11 - awesome
02:12 - and then we're going to look at last
02:14 - week's project so last week at our trade
02:16 - along Zoey taught us how to make virtual
02:19 - pets and so we'll check out all the
02:21 - amazing projects that were created then
02:23 - and then what we're gonna do is we're
02:25 - gonna kind of just share the prompt so
02:28 - to get people's I sort of mines going on
02:30 - what they want to do with video sensing
02:33 - and then we'll learn about scratch and
02:35 - create a project and then we'll answer
02:38 - questions live and so I didn't mention
02:40 - this earlier but there's a link right
02:41 - here where you can send in your
02:43 - questions and so please keep them coming
02:45 - in and I'll answer them to the best of
02:48 - my ability but I assure you we will make
02:51 - some mistakes along the way which is
02:52 - just a part of scratch so I can't
02:54 - promise that it can answer every single
02:55 - question so I've been talking kinda fast
02:58 - cuz I'm super excited so I'm gonna slow
03:01 - down a little bit and Wow
03:04 - while this is all happening I would
03:06 - suggest maybe having two windows open so
03:08 - maybe you have the YouTube video in one
03:10 - window and then scratch in another
03:13 - window so you can kind of be following
03:14 - along so if that all sounds good I'm
03:17 - gonna keep going and we'll take a chance
03:19 - to look at some of the past projects so
03:22 - I'm also gonna try to do a pro move here
03:24 - so I'm going to pull up the window and
03:27 - then I'm gonna switch to see if this
03:29 - works okay so hopefully what you can see
03:34 - is the studio with all of our virtual
03:37 - pets from last week and so I wanted to
03:40 - take a second just to cruise through all
03:42 - of these projects check out their
03:43 - thumbnails and so Zoe and a bunch of
03:47 - other folks created animal projects and
03:50 - so we see there's a cat icon creator we
03:52 - see rainbow exercise Cat nyan cat Tara
03:56 - pet hedgehog house dreamy I love this
04:00 - one the scratch Creed along that's an
04:01 - amazing name for a pet and so super
04:06 - excited to see this we'll have a chance
04:07 - today to when we're making our video
04:08 - sensing projects to share those as well
04:11 - to the studio you also might be
04:12 - wondering what this is in the corner of
04:15 - my screen I'm actually using my cat tree
04:18 - too as a laptop stand so if you see my
04:21 - cat jump up here that is because I'm
04:23 - currently
04:23 - using Gus's cat tree as a laptop stand
04:26 - anyways um so we can check out some of
04:29 - these projects I want to pull up one
04:31 - this is from Panda Girl it's about my
04:34 - dog super cute so let's go ahead and
04:36 - play it see if you can hear it so it
04:39 - looks like press space to make it say a
04:41 - word so my name is my dog's name is come
04:44 - you know he loves me and he's cute super
04:47 - cute I love that project so let's check
04:50 - out another one looks like we have the
04:52 - scratch create along love this name
04:54 - again this looks like we have hi my name
04:57 - is scratch dog and then I think what we
04:59 - can do is we can interact and we can
05:02 - drink some water
05:03 - eat some cheesy poof's quite amazing and
05:07 - then let's check out one more so my pet
05:09 - rock looks like this is a story so I
05:16 - think the idea is the pet rock is now
05:18 - gonna go play oh jesus there's a
05:20 - question so I want a small rock okay so
05:23 - now the rock is going to I guess play
05:27 - play ball looking good okay drag me to
05:29 - the ball this is a very complex project
05:32 - I'm pretty amazed by this this is so
05:35 - good okay and then I think there's
05:37 - actually I think if you play music okay
05:41 - well so you can play a little bit of
05:42 - music and then also like me getting very
05:44 - sleepy and going to bed pretty amazing
05:47 - so what a huge shout out to everyone
05:50 - that was creating projects again you'll
05:53 - have an opportunity at the end of this
05:54 - hour to be sharing your projects that
05:58 - you're making with video sensing so I'll
05:59 - share more about that soon so with all
06:03 - of that I think we want to take a chance
06:05 - to talk now about the prompt and so as I
06:09 - mentioned video sensing is the way in
06:11 - which you can not use your keyboard but
06:13 - rather your body to play with projects
06:15 - so what does that even mean because it's
06:16 - just kind of a weird concept and you
06:19 - might have done something like this with
06:20 - like an Xbox Kinect where again like
06:22 - you're dancing or you're you know
06:24 - pressing things on the screen using your
06:26 - hands so let's show what that looks like
06:28 - really quickly with scratch so I'm gonna
06:30 - try to again do my fancy seam switch
06:34 - here and pull up up
06:36 - Jax called eat the cheesy poof's with a
06:38 - wind-up toy so again I'm in scratch you
06:43 - can see me moving in the background and
06:44 - I'm gonna hit the green flag and we'll
06:46 - see what happens
06:46 - so we see there's some cheesy poof's
06:49 - here so let's see if I were to kind of
06:52 - eat them cool so maybe you've never done
07:00 - that with scratch it's one of my
07:01 - favorite things to do in scratch well
07:03 - eat cheesy poof's and video sensing so
07:05 - we'll get a chance to make our own
07:07 - project using this and that's it turns
07:09 - out that video sensing is quite quite
07:12 - simple and very very powerful so it's
07:14 - again one of my favorite things to do in
07:16 - scratch so let's go ahead and before we
07:20 - sort of dive in to making our project
07:22 - think a bit more about the theme so this
07:24 - is gonna be really important because we
07:26 - don't only want to sort of make a rant
07:28 - well I think making a random scratch
07:29 - project is pretty great but maybe it
07:31 - would be good to think about what kind
07:33 - of project you're interested in making
07:34 - so let me go ahead and exit out of this
07:37 - and find my cursor cool so with video
07:45 - sensing it enables you to make games you
07:48 - can make interactive Ted we could kind
07:50 - of do anything that you can sort of
07:52 - trigger with your hands or any movement
07:54 - or even an object so if you could think
07:56 - for a second about what it is you can do
07:58 - now that you have this superpower so to
08:02 - give you an idea
08:03 - I turned my fridge into a basketball
08:05 - hoop so I would throw a sock at the
08:07 - fridge and then I hit the basketball
08:08 - hoop and then also I turned my bathtub
08:14 - into a kayak and so these are some of
08:17 - the ideas that I had been thinking of
08:20 - and so it'd be good to think about what
08:22 - it is you want to create with video
08:24 - sensing so that said before we even
08:31 - start with video sensing maybe we should
08:33 - just get familiar with scratch and so
08:36 - what I'll do now is I'll pull up the
08:37 - scratch editor and so if you're not
08:40 - familiar with scratch what you're going
08:42 - to want to do is go to scratch.mit.edu
08:46 - so I will pull that up
08:48 - in my browser okay so now I have scratch
08:53 - up and this is the scratch online
08:56 - community you're saying here this is
08:58 - where millions of projects have been
09:01 - shared you can check them out here but I
09:03 - think my favorite part of the scratch
09:04 - community is this create button so if
09:07 - you hit create that pulls up what we
09:10 - call the scratch editor so the scratch
09:13 - editor is kind of where the magic
09:14 - happens this is where you're creating a
09:17 - project and this window right here I'm
09:19 - going to close this for now this is the
09:20 - tutorials window so this is where you
09:22 - have sort of resources to help you
09:24 - produce your project so this is the
09:28 - editor a few things that you want to
09:31 - know about the editor this is what we
09:34 - call this stage so you can kind of think
09:36 - of this one way I think of it on the
09:38 - right here the stage is it's kind of
09:39 - like a stage and a theater or maybe even
09:42 - like a movie theater screen this is kind
09:44 - of where your project will play okay so
09:47 - this is where the project is gonna be
09:48 - playing and then if we go with that
09:51 - metaphor kind of like the cast of
09:52 - characters are down here and we can
09:55 - control this character with coding
09:58 - blocks and the coding blocks are over
09:59 - here in the palette so again think of it
10:03 - sorry scratch cat on stage and then what
10:05 - do we want the scratch cat to do and so
10:07 - what we can do is we can pull out some
10:09 - of these blocks to control scratch cat
10:11 - so I'll go ahead and pull out the move
10:14 - ten steps and I'll zoom in so you can
10:15 - see it so we have scratch cat and I'm
10:18 - gonna hit move ten steps and we'll see
10:20 - what happens okay so the scratch guys
10:22 - kind of move in pretty cool pretty cool
10:24 - what if we had it moved and then maybe
10:27 - say something so we can have it place
10:31 - down meow so I'll connect those two and
10:34 - what's gonna do is gonna play in order
10:36 - it's gonna move ten steps and then play
10:37 - sound meow pretty cool now you notice
10:41 - what I'm doing is I can use my cursor to
10:43 - preview and play the blocks which is
10:46 - cool but if we're making a computer
10:48 - program we're gonna want to trigger it
10:50 - with something so we have these things
10:51 - called event blocks which again are
10:54 - triggers to start your script so we have
10:56 - plenty to choose from so we see here we
11:00 - have wind green flag clicked this
11:01 - a super common block the green flag is
11:04 - kind of like if you start a race it's
11:05 - what you start your project with so
11:07 - let's try that one okay pretty cool but
11:12 - maybe even cooler is this this block
11:14 - when key pressed so now instead of
11:18 - hitting the green flag when I hit this
11:19 - space key it will run my program so this
11:24 - is a super simple program it kind of
11:25 - shows you what it what what scratch is
11:28 - capable of it's an event block followed
11:31 - by sort of a line of sort of commands
11:34 - and code blocks and so that's like the
11:36 - very basic sort of functionality of the
11:38 - coding and so you might be wondering
11:40 - well this fat cat is cool but what about
11:43 - a background well we call these
11:44 - backdrops in scratch and if you want to
11:47 - add a background you just go to the
11:48 - bottom right here and then you click
11:51 - that to add choose a backdrop then say
11:54 - we want scratch cat hanging out like a
11:56 - basketball court I'll go ahead and
11:57 - choose that so now you're starting to
11:59 - sort of make your own story with this
12:01 - right and likewise you can choose other
12:03 - characters too so if I want scratch cat
12:06 - playing basketball with another
12:07 - character I can go ahead choose a sprite
12:11 - something like maybe hanging out with a
12:13 - bat so the bat and cat playing
12:15 - basketball the rhyme sounds nice and you
12:19 - can also add you can also add code to
12:22 - the bat so for instance you see there's
12:25 - no code in the bat but there's still the
12:27 - code that remains from the cat sprite so
12:30 - I'll go ahead and go with the bat when I
12:32 - hit the space key to say hello so now
12:36 - when I hit space key both characters are
12:39 - moving at once so that's super cool
12:42 - that's kind of like the quick intro to
12:44 - scratch please do some questions if that
12:47 - didn't make sense and I think that was
12:50 - kind of an important place for us to
12:52 - start because with video sentencing
12:54 - we're gonna keep it we're gonna keep it
12:55 - very simple and really rely heavily on
12:58 - these event blocks and so without
13:02 - further ado let's go ahead and talk
13:04 - about video sensing so when you're in
13:09 - the editor I'm gonna go ahead and make a
13:10 - new project so if you're in the editor
13:14 - I want us all to quickly pull up the
13:17 - tutorial for video sensing so if you
13:20 - look in the top top left you'll see a
13:21 - tutorials button okay and that's gonna
13:24 - load an array of amazing tutorials I
13:27 - would totally recommend checking out
13:29 - some of these but today we're gonna look
13:32 - at video sensing so we'll scroll down
13:34 - and we'll see video sensing here so I'm
13:38 - gonna go ahead and click that okay so if
13:41 - you've never used a tutorial in scratch
13:43 - this is kind of the general sort of
13:45 - layout is it's gonna start with a video
13:47 - that gives you inspiration let's go
13:49 - ahead and check that video out really
13:50 - quick you can see here we have Zoe who
14:04 - is joining us via the video who is
14:07 - playing a musical instrument
14:09 - we had champ eeka who was petting the
14:11 - cat and then we also had sort of saving
14:14 - these minifigs as they were falling and
14:15 - so you can kind of get a glimpse of what
14:18 - is possible with video sensing and if
14:22 - you were to click the green arrow you'll
14:24 - then see the different steps that show
14:26 - you how it is you can make a video
14:27 - sensing project now fortunately you all
14:31 - have me today so I can help sort of
14:33 - guide you through this tutorial and we
14:36 - don't have to look at the steps but I
14:37 - would highly encourage folks to check
14:39 - out the de toros if you want so I got
14:41 - some feedback here that I should hide
14:43 - the bitly and add the extension yeah
14:46 - that's a really good that's a really
14:47 - good point so the first step that we
14:50 - want to do is to add the extension and
14:54 - so video sensing is what we call an
14:56 - extension and if you're not familiar
14:58 - with extensions extensions can be
15:00 - software so they could live on your
15:01 - computer or if they can be hardware so
15:04 - they can be a robot or some kind of
15:06 - device that you plug into your computer
15:09 - and so this video sensing is going to be
15:13 - a software extensions because it's using
15:15 - our webcam so I'm gonna go ahead and
15:17 - make sure you can see the extensions
15:20 - button so I'm gonna try to grab my
15:21 - cursor don't know where it is there it
15:24 - is Oh
15:24 - oh okay this is the most difficult part
15:27 - of this is finding it so no no you know
15:33 - okay you know what we're gonna we're
15:36 - gonna wing this right now I'm going to
15:38 - try something oh there we go okay so to
15:41 - add the extension step number one to a
15:43 - video sensing project
15:45 - check this out with me so the extensions
15:47 - live in the bottom left of the screen so
15:51 - we're gonna go ahead and click the
15:52 - bottom left this button here and we'll
15:54 - see all the different extensions so you
15:57 - can see we have Hardware extensions and
15:59 - software extensions so let's go ahead
16:01 - and click video sensing okay so we have
16:07 - just turned on video sensing and we
16:09 - noticed a couple of things happened two
16:12 - things one we now see ourselves in the
16:15 - stage which is looking good
16:17 - and two we see a number of new blocks to
16:21 - choose from so let's go ahead and
16:23 - quickly talk about the different blocks
16:25 - sort of introduce ourselves get familiar
16:27 - with the blocks so we can see here video
16:29 - sensing this is a hat block so when
16:31 - video motion exceeds ten this is one of
16:33 - my favorite blocks in scratch and we'll
16:35 - spend some time digging into this block
16:38 - in a second but I also want to show the
16:40 - set video transparency so this is an
16:43 - important block because as you can see
16:45 - you can see myself in in this stage but
16:49 - you notice it's kind of there's a little
16:51 - white haze that's going over my face
16:53 - right now
16:53 - and that's because the transparency of
16:56 - the video on the stage is at fifty
16:59 - percent and so if you don't feel like
17:01 - transparency is like how see-through
17:02 - something is so I would like you all to
17:05 - see me better so I would like it to be
17:07 - less transparent so if we were to say
17:10 - let's make it twenty you can now see me
17:13 - a bit better so maybe I'll go to ten I
17:16 - like even better and maybe zero so now
17:20 - you can see me there is zero percent
17:21 - transparency I'm coming really clear
17:23 - it's just kind of like a webcam it's
17:25 - looking good
17:26 - I want to show you what 100 looks like
17:28 - okay so 100 you can't see anything
17:30 - right
17:33 - so let's go back to zero looking good
17:36 - all right so there's a couple other
17:38 - there's a couple other blocks here too
17:40 - that I want to check out one is turning
17:42 - the video on so video sensing it's going
17:44 - to turn the video on automatically and
17:46 - if that's not the case make sure that
17:49 - you give permissions in your browser you
17:51 - might have seen when you try to turn on
17:52 - video sensing something that appeared on
17:55 - your computer that said you do allow or
17:57 - disallow access your webcam you want to
17:59 - make sure that you say allow and if you
18:01 - do that it should automatically appear
18:04 - if for some reason during your project
18:06 - you want to turn off the video you could
18:08 - use this this block to turn off the
18:10 - video so I'm going to leave it on and
18:16 - then I thinkwell will pause and not sort
18:19 - of dig into this next box here this is a
18:21 - variable that's gonna store some of the
18:22 - values of video motion but we'll talk
18:25 - about that a bit later so let's dive in
18:28 - to the magic of video sensing and we're
18:32 - gonna hang out for maybe 10 15 minutes
18:35 - just using one one of these blocks and
18:38 - that is I think the most powerful Block
18:39 - in scratch and I'm super excited to
18:42 - share this with you and this I see a
18:45 - question is what's the straightforward
18:46 - definition of video sensing in scratch I
18:48 - hopefully it is hard to define so I'm
18:51 - hoping this can sort of help you
18:53 - understand what video sensing is so this
18:56 - block is saying when video motion
18:58 - exceeds ten so one thing to think about
19:01 - is video motion is the amount of motion
19:03 - that's gonna happen on the screen and
19:06 - it's specifically looking for video
19:07 - motion underneath the sprite so this is
19:10 - our sprite here and it's on a scale of 0
19:13 - to 100 and so 0 would be no movement
19:18 - behind the sprite and 100 would be as
19:20 - much movement as we could possibly do so
19:23 - using that simple concept when video
19:26 - motion exceeds 10 which is just a light
19:28 - movement something can happen so I'll go
19:32 - ahead and try that so how about we I
19:36 - don't know make the cat meow when we
19:38 - touch it so go ahead grab a play sound
19:41 - meow until done
19:44 - okay so if all goes according to plan
19:47 - when we move oh sorry
19:52 - when we move our hand over the cat with
19:57 - some amount of motion a little bit
19:59 - amount of motion hopefully the Hat block
20:01 - will start the meow sound so let's go
20:04 - ahead and try this okay so this is like
20:10 - a noose it keeps me super powered
20:12 - because this is like a superpower so now
20:15 - you are controlling with your body
20:18 - actions that happen on the computer and
20:22 - you notice it sometimes it'll trigger
20:23 - even though I'm not doing anything and
20:25 - that's because it's somehow is seeing
20:27 - some type of movement on the wall it
20:29 - might be a shadow it might be a change
20:31 - of the light so what you might want to
20:32 - do is change the value to 30 so it's
20:35 - less sensitive let's try it just for the
20:40 - heck of it to make it 80 and see if it
20:42 - even works okay so if Easy's like a lot
20:48 - I'm getting an arm workout that's good
20:50 - but that's probably too high so one
20:52 - thing to know is tweak this value see
20:56 - what seems natural to you so I would say
20:58 - 20 in this condition 20 seems like
21:02 - natural enough I'm not over doing it and
21:05 - it is yeah so I think 20 feels good so
21:10 - like I said it's a one tip that I have
21:13 - above all else with video sensing is
21:15 - think about the code can be simple think
21:19 - about what it is you're trying to make
21:20 - so for instance with just this 2 block
21:24 - stack we have an awesome thing where the
21:26 - cat meows when we when we pet it so
21:29 - maybe we can say maybe we can try
21:31 - something else like I don't know maybe
21:34 - maybe we have the cat change color so
21:38 - one of my favorite blocks that we have
21:40 - in scratch is the change color effect
21:43 - block so it's in looks and then change
21:46 - color effect so now what's going to
21:48 - happen is when we pet the cat it will
21:51 - play the sound meow and then change the
21:53 - color of that
21:55 - okay cool so here's one thing with
21:58 - scratches I think I would like it when I
22:01 - pet it to change color and then yow
22:04 - so you'll notice the block sacs are kind
22:06 - of running in order so what I'm gonna do
22:09 - is I want to move up the block stack so
22:12 - now when I pet it it'll change color and
22:14 - then meow pretty cool all right let's
22:18 - try one other thing so it's kind of cool
22:20 - that the cat is change of color and
22:23 - meowing but let's have it move when we
22:26 - pet the cat so if we go to the motion
22:31 - blocks up top motion blocks are super
22:34 - see it is triggering a nothing motion
22:36 - blocks super powerful and I use them in
22:40 - almost every single project one of my
22:42 - favorite of the motion blocks is the
22:44 - slide to random position so the glide to
22:49 - random position is gonna do exactly what
22:50 - it says it's gonna take your character
22:52 - and have a glide to somewhere else on
22:55 - the screen so let's go ahead and do that
22:58 - so I will pull that in I think I want it
23:01 - to change color glide invent me I'll so
23:04 - let's see if it works okay cool very
23:10 - nice so you can see with with with just
23:14 - three blocks
23:15 - seriously just three blocks we've
23:17 - already created this like pretty cool
23:18 - program with video sensing I see there's
23:22 - a question of can we add more extensions
23:26 - with the video sensing you absolutely
23:29 - can
23:29 - so let's do that really quickly okay
23:33 - let's try let's try the voice extension
23:38 - this text-to-speech extension so I will
23:41 - find my mouse cursor which is always
23:44 - missing okay and then I'm gonna add
23:46 - another extension which is
23:49 - text-to-speech text-to-speech is another
23:52 - it's like pretty simple to explain
23:53 - text-to-speech let me actually get rid
23:55 - of I see you can see my video twice
23:59 - let's get rid of that no need to see me
24:01 - twice
24:02 - so text-to-speech awesome extension
24:05 - super easy to explain to
24:07 - you just grab the blocker to speak and
24:09 - then you say what it is you want to
24:11 - speak so instead of them yell maybe I'll
24:14 - do maybe I'll do this meow meow meow
24:21 - okay the now doesn't sound totally like
24:24 - a cat
24:24 - so I'll maybe you can set the voice to
24:27 - to Alto which is I think a bit higher or
24:30 - squeaked let's try that as you can see
24:37 - meow
24:38 - super chill having fun okay cool so I
24:45 - promised you that it doesn't take a lot
24:47 - of blocks so oh here's one here's one
24:49 - here's an interesting that's happening
24:52 - normally when you make a scratch project
24:54 - you can hit the stop sign and the stop
24:56 - sign kind of shuts everything down which
24:59 - is good because sometimes have a project
25:00 - is going really crazy I should stop
25:01 - doing that project oh I'm really crazy
25:03 - you hit the stop sign and everything's
25:05 - pauses and stops with video sensing this
25:08 - half block is always gonna trigger no
25:10 - matter what I can hit the stop sign so
25:13 - I'm blue in the face but it's gonna keep
25:15 - going and that's because this hat block
25:17 - overrides the green flag so if ever like
25:20 - oh my gosh just too much going on what
25:22 - you do is disconnect disconnect your
25:25 - scripts from the hat block nothing's
25:27 - gonna happen it doesn't know what to do
25:29 - this event block has nothing hanging out
25:31 - underneath so you'll be good I run into
25:35 - that it's one of the biggest issues
25:36 - video sensing is what be in the
25:38 - background like they get a bunch of
25:39 - noise so yeah that is a pro tip right
25:42 - there so can you make an animation with
25:47 - video sensing that is a good question
25:49 - thanks for asking it and let's let's go
25:52 - ahead and do one now so I wanted to show
25:53 - you this anyways so let's go ahead win
25:57 - make a new project don't worry it's easy
26:00 - enough with video sensing to make
26:01 - something new really quickly so again
26:03 - you see me I'm ghosted I kind of don't
26:05 - like that ghosted book so I'm gonna make
26:07 - sure that I'm setting my transparency to
26:10 - zero now you see me better so let's make
26:13 - an animation let's make a drum let's
26:15 - make a drum that we can hit
26:17 - let's make an instrument yeah so a
26:19 - scratch cat I'm gonna have to say
26:21 - goodbye to you so I'm gonna go ahead and
26:23 - remove scratch cat so scratch that's
26:26 - gone I have no sprites let's go ahead
26:29 - and pick a drum sprite so go ahead I
26:32 - just hope so I did that really quickly
26:33 - again I'm gonna add a new sprite going
26:36 - down here click add I am going to click
26:40 - the drum looks like the drum I'm going
26:42 - to search for a drum and notice that we
26:44 - have so many drums to choose from but
26:46 - it's kind of wild
26:47 - let's try as let's try the drum kit okay
26:51 - so we're gonna keep it this might look
26:54 - pretty similar to the cat animation that
26:56 - we did so I want I want us to think
26:59 - about animation so animation can mean a
27:01 - lot of things it can mean it can mean
27:03 - growing and shrinking it can mean
27:06 - tilting it could mean changing costumes
27:08 - and so I want to show you both so when
27:13 - video motion exceeds 10 our super power
27:16 - block the best Block in scratch wind
27:18 - video motion exceeds 10 let's have it
27:20 - grow and shrink
27:22 - let's have bad animations over okay so
27:26 - let's go to the looks category looks
27:30 - category purple category it's gonna have
27:33 - your size in there it's gonna have like
27:35 - that color effect block that we had
27:36 - earlier so let's go ahead and look at
27:39 - the set size block so set size to 100
27:44 - this is currently 100 if we set size to
27:46 - say 200 let's see what looks like boom
27:48 - okay cool so how about wind video motion
27:51 - exceeds 10 let's set the size to 100 now
27:55 - let's set it to 200 okay so when we hit
28:00 - that it's gonna go 200 and then let's
28:02 - have a wait one second and then shrink
28:05 - back down so 200 wait one second let's
28:09 - have a wait point five seconds and then
28:12 - let's have it go back down so again
28:14 - that's good oh now are you triggered
28:17 - okay cool it's like I feel like it needs
28:21 - a sound and so it's cool about the the
28:24 - drum sprites any any instruments right
28:26 - is they have some
28:27 - sounds built-in so if we go to the
28:30 - sounds category here we can drag out
28:34 - play low-tom which i think is the sound
28:37 - so it may be 0.5 Seulong I think playing
28:42 - fives too long probably my thighs a
28:44 - little too long so maybe we do like
28:46 - point two okay
28:50 - I can't use I actually hit Siri on my
28:53 - laptop okay cool and then one other
28:56 - things I said
28:56 - so maybe to use okay a little sensitive
29:00 - so let me disconnect the block I also
29:02 - mentioned so you can change the size
29:04 - that is certainly one way to animate it
29:06 - but I also want to show you this concept
29:07 - of costumes so if you're not familiar we
29:11 - see our character our sprite here
29:13 - there's this magical tab called costumes
29:16 - where in the drum set in this case has
29:20 - another sort of costume another look to
29:22 - it so you see it says drum kit and drum
29:26 - kit B and so these are the two costumes
29:28 - it has and so you can see as I toggle
29:30 - between these costumes this is changing
29:33 - yeah so what if we could do this with
29:37 - like code and I don't have to continue
29:38 - to click this that would be nice
29:40 - well there is a way in scratch so what
29:42 - we'll do is we'll go to looks there is
29:44 - the next costume block so that will
29:47 - switch automatic to the next costume so
29:50 - but let's let's think we're to add this
29:52 - into our script so so we expand to 200%
29:57 - we're playing the sound let's change the
30:00 - costume okay
30:03 - expand sound costume change weight set
30:06 - size
30:10 - okay cool I mean I don't know simple
30:12 - animation using wow there's so many
30:15 - questions out sorry there's so many
30:16 - questions so that you get to but
30:18 - hopefully that helps you put understand
30:19 - how it is you can I really gotta undo
30:22 - these blots how it is you can animate
30:24 - drums in scratch can you use color
30:27 - sensing with video sensing yes you
30:31 - absolutely can I will get to that a bit
30:34 - later cuz that's a bit more complex can
30:37 - you make a platformer with video sensing
30:38 - you know what I'm glad you asked you can
30:43 - you can make even like one better than a
30:46 - platformer
30:46 - so here's it here let me show you this
30:48 - is gonna sound kind of silly but imagine
30:51 - you could actually play Mario which
30:54 - sounds weird but one thing to know about
30:56 - video sensing is what if you what if you
30:58 - stood way back from the camera what if
31:01 - your way back here and you were running
31:04 - and you were grabbing things as they
31:06 - came and so I could probably quickly
31:11 - show you what that might look like but
31:14 - let me let me suggest to you that that
31:17 - is totally possible that would probably
31:19 - take about 15 minutes to show you but
31:22 - let me show you a somewhat similar idea
31:25 - that might get you inspired by this and
31:28 - so let me create a game that kind of
31:30 - exists in that sort of platformer space
31:33 - and so that is a game that we're gonna
31:36 - play where were the character and we're
31:38 - really small and we're gonna be running
31:39 - from something so I'm going to I'm gonna
31:44 - create a bug I'm gonna create a bug so
31:49 - no I'll go with our friend in the back
31:51 - so what if instead of a platformer we
31:53 - did something where the bat is flying
31:55 - around trying to touch us which I don't
31:59 - know yeah not a bad thing maybe it's a
32:02 - good thing maybe we want to get touched
32:03 - by that back so anyways I will set the
32:07 - size because if that's a little little
32:09 - big a little small now well that's too
32:11 - big so I'm gonna set the size of the bat
32:13 - to 50 I think
32:15 - okay so we have a bat flying around so
32:18 - what if the game was we have to avoid
32:20 - the bat
32:20 - yeah not quite a platformer but again
32:23 - it's like I'm using my body I'm like
32:25 - running so simple let's have the bat
32:29 - flyer on the screen I can do this with
32:32 - three blocks when greenside clicked I
32:35 - told you my spike one of my favorite
32:37 - motion blocks glide to random position
32:40 - so let's click that so we see okay
32:44 - that's cool when we hit the green flag
32:46 - it's gonna glide but we want that to
32:48 - continue to happen so I'm gonna go ahead
32:50 - and wrap that in forever forever loop so
32:53 - the bat is always moving okay so you can
32:56 - see I'm kind of trying to avoid it okay
33:00 - cool but but it's not interactive right
33:03 - like I could do that it's kind of fun
33:05 - it's kind of cool but like what if what
33:07 - if we made it a game where I like if it
33:09 - touches me it says something or makes a
33:12 - sound so we can do that with video
33:13 - sensing and we'll do it with the same
33:14 - kind of sort of setup that we had
33:16 - earlier so wind video sensing exceeds
33:19 - ten so when the bat is kind of hitting
33:22 - me because I'm in the way it'll it'll do
33:25 - something so maybe we'll have it play a
33:29 - sound the stand let's do a laugh yeah so
33:34 - I'm gonna add a sound so I'm doing that
33:36 - really quick so the bat it's right has
33:40 - the owl sound but the owl sound isn't
33:42 - kind of like what I'm going for
33:43 - so I'm going to change the sound by
33:47 - going down here sorry the url's
33:50 - blocking this but there's just a little
33:53 - speaker icon to choose a sound and then
33:55 - I'll choose something weird I don't know
34:01 - if the basketball sound why not
34:02 - so with so when when the bat touches me
34:06 - it's going to play the basketball sound
34:10 - okay so the game is to avoid the bat
34:12 - okay so now it's triggering like crazy
34:18 - so I'm going to change the sensitivity
34:20 - to 30 because it's triggering on
34:23 - something that I don't know what what
34:24 - it's triggering on and again that's that
34:26 - idea of 10 might not be the best
34:28 - so let's go ahead okay
34:33 - figure down a watt now so let me try to
34:34 - go 60 okay so it's not perfect I told
34:48 - you I was gonna make mistakes
34:49 - so what's happening is the bat is
34:53 - triggering on some type of motion that
34:55 - it's seeing on the background and not
34:57 - just me so that is to say the biggest
34:59 - sensing is not perfect but the kind of
35:02 - concept of what we're doing here what
35:04 - the logic does works let me try 90 and
35:07 - see if we can't get it to work and then
35:09 - if it doesn't I'm gonna stop this demo
35:17 - yeah it is so interesting that is
35:20 - triggering on the background so video
35:23 - sensing isn't perfect and we should be
35:25 - guys just as you're creating build
35:27 - around knowing that it's not gonna be
35:28 - perfect
35:29 - cool so how do you get your own sounds
35:32 - is a good question thanks for asking so
35:35 - say we didn't want the basketball sound
35:39 - what we can do is we can go to the
35:41 - sounds tab of the of the sprite and
35:44 - record our own sounds so there's a
35:46 - couple ways to do this I mean get rid of
35:51 - let me get rid of the thing on the
35:55 - bottom
35:56 - get rid of bitly okay so the question is
35:59 - how can you get your own sounds there's
36:01 - a number different ways so one way you
36:03 - can do it is you can record your own
36:05 - sound so if you go down to the bottom
36:08 - left here you can hit record give
36:12 - permission to use their microphone then
36:15 - go boom and then you can save your sound
36:20 - you can name it so that's one way to do
36:22 - it there's another way in which you can
36:25 - upload from your computer so if you have
36:26 - a sound that you saved on your computer
36:27 - already you can go ahead and upload it
36:30 - this way and then you can also choose
36:32 - from the library of sounds the libraries
36:35 - like super awesome there's so
36:37 - different sounds in their toy check that
36:39 - out I'm kind of bummed that our little
36:41 - back game didn't work let me try it one
36:45 - more time at 95 to shoot the 95
36:47 - sensitivity is gonna is gonna do it for
36:49 - us now it's just so sensitive on that
36:54 - wall anyways so I'm gonna play with so
36:59 - how do you get your own sound we did
37:01 - that one would have let me pull up some
37:03 - of these questions thank you so much for
37:05 - all these amazing questions I'm just
37:07 - gonna try to again find my mouse cursor
37:08 - because it's always disappearing on me
37:12 - what if you don't know where the blocks
37:14 - are because my first time using scratch
37:16 - oh that's a good question so I think the
37:19 - question is what it what if is your
37:20 - first time using scratching don't know
37:21 - where the blocks are I would suggest if
37:25 - it's your first time using scratch maybe
37:28 - what I would do is I would check out in
37:31 - the tutorials window I would check out
37:34 - the getting started with scratch
37:35 - activity or the imagine a world activity
37:38 - so I just clicked imagine the world this
37:43 - particular tutorial introduces you to a
37:46 - lot of the introductory blocks in
37:48 - scratch or some of the more basic blocks
37:49 - in scratch and it's gonna give you sort
37:52 - of a nice understanding of what is
37:53 - available and so it's gonna introduce
37:55 - you to looks blocks to sound blocks to
38:00 - event blocks things like that and to be
38:05 - honest it might seem like there's a lot
38:07 - of blocks in scratch but I kind of
38:11 - typically hang out with just like maybe
38:13 - like 15 to 20 of them I tend to use the
38:16 - motion blocks a lot I'm always making my
38:18 - characters move and turn I'm using the
38:21 - glide block as I mentioned I think the
38:24 - looks block again thus a block is super
38:26 - powerful some of these more introductory
38:28 - blocks and I say introductory but I just
38:32 - mean that they're there I don't know
38:34 - pretty straightforward and they are
38:35 - incredibly powerful and then I also
38:38 - think that the play sound and play sound
38:40 - until done blocks are super super
38:43 - powerful and
38:45 - I use them quite a lot so I would say
38:48 - it's doing those two things okay how do
38:53 - you make a pong game using video sensing
38:58 - that is a good question
39:00 - so just like any sort of any and any
39:06 - game in scratch can be converted to a
39:08 - video sensing game so if you were to
39:10 - create a a pong game I guess you could
39:15 - say when when I touch we can play pong
39:19 - with the bat so when I sort of touch the
39:23 - bat have it glide across the screen so
39:28 - let's try to make that script really
39:29 - quick so when video motion exceeds ten
39:33 - let's have it move ten steps so let's
39:38 - see what happens okay cool
39:40 - so not quite there let's try it again
39:43 - okay so not quite palm so what we can do
39:50 - is instead of having it move just ten
39:52 - steps we can have it move ten steps in a
39:54 - loop so that will make it move even more
39:57 - so let's go ahead and put that in a loop
39:59 - so ten times so now I'll take it off
40:02 - from the biggest sensing when I click
40:04 - that it will move so let's do that
40:09 - yeah okay so we see it's moving now ten
40:12 - steps ten times so it's 100 pixels
40:14 - across the screen let's try something
40:16 - more like 30 so you can see now it's
40:19 - moving quite fast across the screen so
40:23 - we can attach that now to our stack
40:31 - okay pretty cool I'm trying to think how
40:35 - it is we would do this in a way where
40:38 - it's like pong where it bounces back and
40:39 - forth you know I wish I had a co-host
40:42 - cuz I I have a feeling Zoey would know
40:44 - how to do this that's a really good
40:45 - question I'm trying to think what I
40:47 - would suggest doing is checking out in
40:51 - the scratch community I'll pull this up
40:53 - right now it's okay not to have the
40:55 - answers I'm sorry I do think a pong game
40:57 - might take it take some time so I'm
40:59 - gonna model when I have an idea that I
41:02 - don't quite know how to solve now what I
41:04 - do is for pong game and what I'll do is
41:07 - I'll pull up a pong game for instance
41:08 - starter pong and what I'll do is I'll
41:11 - play the project and go like okay cool I
41:13 - see how this works okay pretty cool so
41:19 - what I'll do is I'll bet and say like
41:20 - okay let's see inside let's see what the
41:22 - code looks like
41:23 - so the code it looks like the paddle has
41:26 - its own sprite and we're setting the
41:30 - paddle to Mouse X and so then what I
41:33 - would do is I would probably add the
41:34 - video sensing extension so I'm gonna go
41:38 - ahead and do that and then I would start
41:41 - to manipulate this project to say okay
41:43 - Winn have bit of sensing on trying to
41:46 - hit the ball and see what happened so it
41:49 - looks like there is something here the
41:51 - code says when the ball is touching the
41:55 - paddle go in the random position start
41:58 - sound I don't know why today I'm sorry I
42:01 - can't I can't no I don't it's not kind
42:04 - of there's a way you should do it you
42:08 - know what here's you should do it and
42:09 - then share it in the studio and then
42:12 - next week next week when I do is well
42:16 - Zoey will do cos Zoey we closed ting
42:17 - we're gonna show that project we're
42:19 - gonna show a video sensing pong sorry so
42:21 - that that is my non answer answer which
42:24 - is check out other projects in the
42:25 - community and get the gear spinning on
42:27 - what it is you might do what is the
42:30 - difference between play sound thanks to
42:32 - the question by the way what is the
42:33 - difference between play sound and play
42:35 - sound until done that is a good question
42:37 - that haunts everyone as they get used to
42:41 - scratch so there's a very
42:44 - important difference between place on
42:47 - place sound done so let's pull out both
42:48 - of those blocks really quick so play
42:51 - sound play sound until done so let's go
42:55 - let's let's model this so if we were to
42:59 - play the sound you know what I want to
43:01 - get a longer sound for this I want to
43:04 - model it with a longer sound and I'm
43:06 - also gonna pull up the URL so you all
43:09 - could ask more questions sorry friends
43:17 - jeez Louise okay so I want to model this
43:22 - with a with a much longer sound so you
43:24 - can kind of get the understanding of
43:26 - what's going on here we go okay so I
43:29 - will pull up I'm gonna choose what I
43:31 - know is the long sound so and the bat
43:33 - sprite I'm gonna go to sounds I'm gonna
43:35 - pull up a sound from the library that is
43:40 - the loop okay so that is an eight-second
43:46 - song it's very chill so the play sound
43:51 - until done is going to play that sound
43:55 - until it is done it's gonna play the
43:57 - entire eight seconds
43:59 - of that really chill awesome majestic
44:03 - sound so it's gonna that's gonna play
44:04 - all eight seconds so if I were to put
44:06 - that into a loop what happens
44:10 - [Music]
44:12 - playing as playing and playing for six
44:15 - seconds in were seven seconds in so okay
44:19 - now we've read every started so it's
44:20 - gonna play the eight seconds in loop
44:22 - forever good for the background of your
44:25 - project do that let's try something else
44:28 - let's try it now the play sound block
44:30 - just a place on block sound
44:37 - so what what it's trying to do is it's
44:39 - like hitting the play button like 100
44:43 - times a second and so it's not gonna
44:44 - play all 80 seconds it's gonna just try
44:46 - to keep starting to sound start time so
44:47 - that's um so you only get like the first
44:49 - millisecond of the sound so never put
44:52 - start sounds into a forever loop that's
44:56 - the number one thing well yeah if you're
44:58 - gonna get this you're gonna get this
45:02 - so but so that that's that's kind of
45:05 - like the one reason but I also want to
45:07 - share something that is important and I
45:09 - shouldn't say you should never use them
45:10 - in a forever loop I'm going to show you
45:12 - why say you want your cat to like you to
45:15 - be like moving as it's like playing the
45:19 - chill music so we'll bring up our back
45:21 - here so we have our bat here and if we
45:28 - want to have the bat the gliding around
45:30 - the screen as the music is playing we'll
45:34 - want to do start sound and I'll show you
45:35 - why so start sound chill and then we'll
45:41 - have the bat move so again this script
45:44 - is gonna say start the sound chill play
45:49 - that eight seconds and while that's
45:50 - happening why so we see the sound
45:55 - started playing
45:58 - now the difference is if you if you
46:00 - wanted to that effect but use place on
46:02 - until done you have to wait eight
46:05 - seconds waiting waiting
46:11 - reading and then it moves so if you want
46:14 - the music to play underneath start the
46:16 - sound and then other things could happen
46:18 - in the script yeah so that's that's the
46:21 - difference between play sound plays on
46:22 - until then I gotta tell you the amount
46:25 - of times that I've done this is wild so
46:29 - don't feel bad if you've done that I do
46:31 - it all the time
46:33 - you're awesome thank you I've slowed
46:35 - down how quickly I'm talking when I
46:38 - started I was really excited I'm still
46:40 - really excited but I was talking too
46:42 - quickly so sorry about that anyways I
46:47 - wanted to show you one of the cool thing
46:48 - with video sensing that involves the
46:53 - play sound and I think play sounds chill
46:55 - is the perfect example of what it is you
46:57 - can do with this so remember we just
47:00 - created some really cool background
47:02 - music so we're like chillin it's cool so
47:07 - what if we made a dance party and the
47:09 - idea is if you are moving the song would
47:12 - play and if you're not moving this one
47:15 - doesn't play so let's try that so again
47:19 - we have our background spray
47:21 - [Music]
47:22 - it sounds cool it's chill okay so how do
47:26 - we do this I want to show you a block
47:28 - that we haven't talked about yet messing
47:31 - the video sensing blocks so I'm going
47:32 - back to video sensing and it's this
47:35 - block right here
47:36 - so let's take 10 to 15 seconds to talk
47:39 - about this block this is a variable so
47:43 - this is gonna have stored values in it
47:44 - stored values yeah from 0 to 100 and the
47:49 - values can change so in this case it's
47:50 - the motion on the sprite so let's see
47:53 - quickly with what that looks like
47:55 - there's values in it if we click the
47:57 - value we can see the value pop up really
47:58 - quickly so 9 0 2 4 that's the amount of
48:02 - motion that's happening underneath the
48:03 - sprite you can also detect the amount of
48:07 - motion on this stage so the entire stage
48:10 - happening here so as I move around the
48:13 - stage we can see it's like 80 90 okay so
48:18 - what if we did this what if we said set
48:22 - the volume set the volume of the sound
48:26 - to the amount of movement so if there's
48:28 - a lot of movement on the stage 100 it's
48:31 - gonna be a hundred volume it's gonna be
48:32 - really loud and if there's no movement
48:34 - we're not gonna hear anything okay
48:37 - so using this block let's let's try that
48:39 - so so when I hit the green flag when I
48:44 - hit the green flag for ever be doing
48:47 - this and what we wanted to be doing for
48:48 - ever we wanted to be setting the volume
48:51 - so there is a set volume block here set
48:54 - volume so forever he's setting the
48:57 - volume to the amount of motion on the
48:59 - stage before we do this I also want to
49:02 - create a really really simple script
49:05 - that's going to show us the value of the
49:07 - variable so I also want it to forever be
49:10 - showing us the value of the variable and
49:12 - the way in which you show the value of
49:14 - the variable is to put it in a safe lock
49:17 - so when I hit the green flag forever
49:24 - forever say the value so grab a save
49:26 - lock forever say this value and this
49:32 - value again is gonna be hanging out
49:33 - between 0 and 100 so I'll grab that and
49:38 - again it's forever say the amount of
49:40 - motion on the backdrop so let's see if
49:43 - it works so again sorry that was a lot
49:45 - of things so and this is what I like to
49:47 - do when I'm when I'm scratching and I
49:49 - and I've just done a couple things I
49:50 - like to just digest and say what did I
49:52 - just do so we have and you can even you
49:56 - can even comment the code I'll add a
49:59 - comment this is for background music
50:02 - okay that's our background music that's
50:05 - for ever play the sound chill this is
50:08 - I'm gonna add a comment
50:09 - this is letting us know a little say box
50:12 - neck up here here on the thing on this
50:14 - right it's gonna say the value so that's
50:17 - gonna be value and then this is our set
50:21 - volume script which is setting the
50:23 - volume to the amount of emotion on stage
50:24 - let's try it out
50:40 - okay I don't know if it's coming through
50:44 - on the speakers that well but it does
50:46 - work so if I if I have like no movement
50:48 - on the screen no one's here
50:53 - [Music]
50:57 - it's you know it's weird it's cool I
51:02 - would suggest trying that you can make
51:04 - your own little dance party get weird
51:06 - with it so yeah the amount of motion on
51:08 - the stage linked in with another block
51:10 - is super super fun so anyways that was a
51:15 - long way to answer that question what
51:19 - occasions are good for video sensing I
51:22 - would say I would say but with video
51:29 - sensing you can make stories you can
51:31 - make games you can make animations I
51:32 - really do think anything that you feel
51:36 - like can be triggered so if you're
51:40 - thinking about collecting coins shooting
51:47 - a basketball interacting with an object
51:49 - those are all really great things for
51:51 - video tempting but I do think what I
51:53 - chose like 10 minutes ago were used to
51:55 - going this fast community look at their
51:56 - product and say like hey like how can i
51:58 - how can I use video sensing now I even
52:01 - show you there's also something like
52:03 - super simple for kid even about let's
52:07 - just do the simplest code let's just do
52:08 - this simplest code to make like a filter
52:10 - like a snapchat filter so I'll choose a
52:13 - new sprite nom to do the Hat
52:15 - so here we see the Hat okay
52:19 - pretty cool maybe make it a little bit
52:21 - bigger make it 200 so like even just
52:24 - like that there's no code here and it's
52:27 - super cool but maybe we can actually we
52:29 - can do something even cooler maybe when
52:32 - we hit the space key we can change the
52:36 - costume so we notice there's four
52:39 - different hats here so we can make super
52:43 - simple script win space key switch to
52:46 - the next costume
52:48 - yeah just just play with I mean there's
52:52 - just there's just too much here there's
52:53 - just it's good for everything
52:55 - that's another not answer I'm sorry I do
52:58 - I do want to be mindful of time thank
53:00 - you all so much for your questions
53:02 - looks like we have now about eight
53:03 - minutes and so I want to make sure that
53:07 - we have a chance to show you how it is
53:10 - you can save your project and then share
53:13 - your project into a studio and I'm just
53:17 - gonna double check with my handy dandy
53:20 - schedule to make sure that's what videos
53:22 - we're doing next okay yeah so now that
53:27 - we've made a project I want to introduce
53:29 - this idea of like what what do you do
53:31 - with the project so want to make sure
53:33 - that the project is saved somewhere and
53:36 - so you can see here in the scratch
53:39 - editor we have we have to have no
53:42 - project let me just make a project
53:43 - really quick let's go back here let's go
53:48 - ahead and let's do our cat meowing
53:50 - project really quick so again that was
53:53 - super easy I've got a AB cat at the cat
53:56 - at the camp okay add the cat win video
54:00 - and motion ten starts ah meow okay make
54:06 - sure it works
54:08 - okay that's going okay so I have a
54:10 - project that I feel oh my god let's see
54:12 - the the the stop sign isn't gonna stop
54:16 - it you have to disconnect the box
54:18 - anyways so if you want to save it to
54:21 - your account you'll need an account so
54:22 - if you don't already have a scratch
54:24 - account you should make one scratch is
54:26 - awesome it's free do it so you hit the
54:29 - join button here if you already have an
54:31 - account you can go ahead and sign in so
54:34 - I'm gonna go ahead and sign into my cow
54:36 - speak locally which is a play off of
54:40 - speak visually which is my other
54:41 - username so you can see now I'm logged
54:47 - in to my scratch count and I'm going to
54:51 - hit the giant share button maybe before
54:54 - I share I want to name it so pet the cat
54:57 - okay get the cat okay and then I'm gonna
55:02 - hit that big ol orange share button okay
55:06 - now what happens when I hit the share
55:07 - button
55:08 - okay now I'm taken to this screen this
55:11 - screen yin is where the project is now
55:13 - shared in the scratch online community
55:15 - it is now available to the millions of
55:19 - scratchers out there what you might want
55:20 - to do is give instructions for people so
55:23 - like use all caps use your hands to look
55:29 - at the CAD tool and now you can if you
55:35 - want to share it like you're super
55:37 - excited and you'd like blasts it to all
55:39 - your friends and family the URL to the
55:42 - project is up here so you just copy
55:44 - paste this URL right here you can send
55:47 - it to anyone they'll be taken to this
55:48 - page they can love it they can favorite
55:50 - it they can play with your virtual cat
55:52 - it's super cool and if you want you can
55:56 - share your project into the studio that
55:59 - we have for today's create along which I
56:03 - actually lost the tab for so I'm gonna
56:06 - try to reopen it which is two video
56:10 - sensing which is you know what I didn't
56:13 - lose it it was just in another it was in
56:15 - another tab so if you want to share your
56:18 - project into the studio what you can do
56:21 - is you can have to log in eat locally
56:31 - okay so the studio by the way the studio
56:34 - description is in the link below this
56:39 - video so the studio description is in
56:41 - the link below and so you can go ahead
56:43 - and do it that way and then you just hit
56:45 - add project when you hit add project
56:48 - what you'll see is this button here to
56:52 - add and then you go ahead and add it
56:54 - like that and you've successfully added
56:56 - your project to the studio and so next
57:00 - week what we'll do is we will check out
57:02 - all of the incredible projects that were
57:04 - created doing this
57:07 - video sensing and in the meantime I'm
57:11 - kind of out of stuff for us to talk
57:13 - about I want to thank you for all the
57:18 - questions that you that you shared
57:21 - thanks for bearing with me as I was kind
57:24 - of getting my feet wet with all this
57:26 - whole live streaming thing I am so glad
57:29 - that next week
57:31 - Zoe is going to be taking over maybe I
57:34 - can go host another another week but it
57:36 - was a lot of fun and I really do
57:38 - encourage folks when you're making a
57:40 - video sensing project to think about
57:44 - keeping it simple
57:45 - thinking about that magical I'm gonna
57:48 - pull this up again that super magical
57:50 - wind video motion exceeds ten block that
57:53 - is just like the portal to so many cool
57:55 - things don't think about over
57:57 - complicating it and if you want to if
58:00 - you're kind of struggling for
58:01 - inspiration do check out the scratch
58:03 - online community there's a lot of really
58:05 - great projects and you can easily remix
58:07 - by introducing video sensing and so as
58:12 - you work on your projects throughout the
58:13 - week please do share in the studio super
58:15 - excited to next week show it off and
58:17 - definitely talking to you the person who
58:19 - asked the question about making a video
58:21 - sensing pong because I can't wait to
58:22 - play it so I hope you end up doing that
58:24 - and I want to thank again so EJC Natalie
58:29 - other folks from the rock team who have
58:31 - been helping behind the scenes with the
58:33 - create along and with that I think I'm
58:35 - going to get my long overdue glass of
58:38 - water say goodbye and want to thank you
58:42 - all again for hanging out for the entire
58:44 - hour I see there's 350 of you so happy
58:47 - scratching scratch on I'm gonna log off
58:50 - might take a nap kind of tired I hope
58:53 - you take a nap that was a lot of
58:54 - creating anyways wishing everyone well
58:57 - see you later as well
58:59 - I'm gonna have to figure out how to stop
59:00 - the stream so you're gonna awkwardly be
59:02 - looking at me for the next five seconds
59:04 - as I try to find a mouse cursor okay I
59:07 - found the end stream button I'm going to
59:09 - end the stream see y'all later

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody good to see you hope this thing is on my name is Eric also known as speak busy on scratch so excited to have you all here for our create along hopefully this is working you might be wondering where is Zoey who is normally the host of the creative long sorry you're stuck with me today Zoey unfortunately lost her voice and is resting it so I'm gonna be walking me all through this next hour where we're going to be working on our own video sensing projects with scratch and so if you're completely new and have never been to a create along the idea is we're gonna for the next hour to work on the project I'll be here answering your questions and we're gonna hopefully there's a lot of tech in front of me right now this is my first time kind of doing this so there's computer here there's computer back there I actually have Zoey in the background and she's helping with the questions giving feedback how the texts working I got Jacy looking at the questions too so shout out to both of them behind the scenes so if you're new welcome and if you've already been here thanks for coming back and so I guess the idea is what we want to start with is just talking a bit about how the cradle longs are sort of a good opportunity for us now that we find ourselves sort of at home I think this is a great opportunity for us to sort of come together and to connect and to share and there's nothing better that I like to do on my downtime think rate with scratched and today I'm going to be showing you some amazing things you can do with video sensing and so to give a quick pitch video sensing is essentially controlling your scratch project without using your keyboard we'll talk more about this it sounds kind of fake but I trust me it's real and we'll do that so what we're going to do now is sort of talk about what the the hour is gonna look like and so I'm gonna pull up two super fancy graphic that we have that is the plan for today I hope that works also everything is mirrored so I have to point the opposite way at the point of things so we'll go ahead and walk through the schedule for today so today we're gonna gather so we've totally done that happy to see it there's 70 people all around the world that's super awesome and then we're going to look at last week's project so last week at our trade along Zoey taught us how to make virtual pets and so we'll check out all the amazing projects that were created then and then what we're gonna do is we're gonna kind of just share the prompt so to get people's I sort of mines going on what they want to do with video sensing and then we'll learn about scratch and create a project and then we'll answer questions live and so I didn't mention this earlier but there's a link right here where you can send in your questions and so please keep them coming in and I'll answer them to the best of my ability but I assure you we will make some mistakes along the way which is just a part of scratch so I can't promise that it can answer every single question so I've been talking kinda fast cuz I'm super excited so I'm gonna slow down a little bit and Wow while this is all happening I would suggest maybe having two windows open so maybe you have the YouTube video in one window and then scratch in another window so you can kind of be following along so if that all sounds good I'm gonna keep going and we'll take a chance to look at some of the past projects so I'm also gonna try to do a pro move here so I'm going to pull up the window and then I'm gonna switch to see if this works okay so hopefully what you can see is the studio with all of our virtual pets from last week and so I wanted to take a second just to cruise through all of these projects check out their thumbnails and so Zoe and a bunch of other folks created animal projects and so we see there's a cat icon creator we see rainbow exercise Cat nyan cat Tara pet hedgehog house dreamy I love this one the scratch Creed along that's an amazing name for a pet and so super excited to see this we'll have a chance today to when we're making our video sensing projects to share those as well to the studio you also might be wondering what this is in the corner of my screen I'm actually using my cat tree too as a laptop stand so if you see my cat jump up here that is because I'm currently using Gus's cat tree as a laptop stand anyways um so we can check out some of these projects I want to pull up one this is from Panda Girl it's about my dog super cute so let's go ahead and play it see if you can hear it so it looks like press space to make it say a word so my name is my dog's name is come you know he loves me and he's cute super cute I love that project so let's check out another one looks like we have the scratch create along love this name again this looks like we have hi my name is scratch dog and then I think what we can do is we can interact and we can drink some water eat some cheesy poof's quite amazing and then let's check out one more so my pet rock looks like this is a story so I think the idea is the pet rock is now gonna go play oh jesus there's a question so I want a small rock okay so now the rock is going to I guess play play ball looking good okay drag me to the ball this is a very complex project I'm pretty amazed by this this is so good okay and then I think there's actually I think if you play music okay well so you can play a little bit of music and then also like me getting very sleepy and going to bed pretty amazing so what a huge shout out to everyone that was creating projects again you'll have an opportunity at the end of this hour to be sharing your projects that you're making with video sensing so I'll share more about that soon so with all of that I think we want to take a chance to talk now about the prompt and so as I mentioned video sensing is the way in which you can not use your keyboard but rather your body to play with projects so what does that even mean because it's just kind of a weird concept and you might have done something like this with like an Xbox Kinect where again like you're dancing or you're you know pressing things on the screen using your hands so let's show what that looks like really quickly with scratch so I'm gonna try to again do my fancy seam switch here and pull up up Jax called eat the cheesy poof's with a windup toy so again I'm in scratch you can see me moving in the background and I'm gonna hit the green flag and we'll see what happens so we see there's some cheesy poof's here so let's see if I were to kind of eat them cool so maybe you've never done that with scratch it's one of my favorite things to do in scratch well eat cheesy poof's and video sensing so we'll get a chance to make our own project using this and that's it turns out that video sensing is quite quite simple and very very powerful so it's again one of my favorite things to do in scratch so let's go ahead and before we sort of dive in to making our project think a bit more about the theme so this is gonna be really important because we don't only want to sort of make a rant well I think making a random scratch project is pretty great but maybe it would be good to think about what kind of project you're interested in making so let me go ahead and exit out of this and find my cursor cool so with video sensing it enables you to make games you can make interactive Ted we could kind of do anything that you can sort of trigger with your hands or any movement or even an object so if you could think for a second about what it is you can do now that you have this superpower so to give you an idea I turned my fridge into a basketball hoop so I would throw a sock at the fridge and then I hit the basketball hoop and then also I turned my bathtub into a kayak and so these are some of the ideas that I had been thinking of and so it'd be good to think about what it is you want to create with video sensing so that said before we even start with video sensing maybe we should just get familiar with scratch and so what I'll do now is I'll pull up the scratch editor and so if you're not familiar with scratch what you're going to want to do is go to scratch.mit.edu so I will pull that up in my browser okay so now I have scratch up and this is the scratch online community you're saying here this is where millions of projects have been shared you can check them out here but I think my favorite part of the scratch community is this create button so if you hit create that pulls up what we call the scratch editor so the scratch editor is kind of where the magic happens this is where you're creating a project and this window right here I'm going to close this for now this is the tutorials window so this is where you have sort of resources to help you produce your project so this is the editor a few things that you want to know about the editor this is what we call this stage so you can kind of think of this one way I think of it on the right here the stage is it's kind of like a stage and a theater or maybe even like a movie theater screen this is kind of where your project will play okay so this is where the project is gonna be playing and then if we go with that metaphor kind of like the cast of characters are down here and we can control this character with coding blocks and the coding blocks are over here in the palette so again think of it sorry scratch cat on stage and then what do we want the scratch cat to do and so what we can do is we can pull out some of these blocks to control scratch cat so I'll go ahead and pull out the move ten steps and I'll zoom in so you can see it so we have scratch cat and I'm gonna hit move ten steps and we'll see what happens okay so the scratch guys kind of move in pretty cool pretty cool what if we had it moved and then maybe say something so we can have it place down meow so I'll connect those two and what's gonna do is gonna play in order it's gonna move ten steps and then play sound meow pretty cool now you notice what I'm doing is I can use my cursor to preview and play the blocks which is cool but if we're making a computer program we're gonna want to trigger it with something so we have these things called event blocks which again are triggers to start your script so we have plenty to choose from so we see here we have wind green flag clicked this a super common block the green flag is kind of like if you start a race it's what you start your project with so let's try that one okay pretty cool but maybe even cooler is this this block when key pressed so now instead of hitting the green flag when I hit this space key it will run my program so this is a super simple program it kind of shows you what it what what scratch is capable of it's an event block followed by sort of a line of sort of commands and code blocks and so that's like the very basic sort of functionality of the coding and so you might be wondering well this fat cat is cool but what about a background well we call these backdrops in scratch and if you want to add a background you just go to the bottom right here and then you click that to add choose a backdrop then say we want scratch cat hanging out like a basketball court I'll go ahead and choose that so now you're starting to sort of make your own story with this right and likewise you can choose other characters too so if I want scratch cat playing basketball with another character I can go ahead choose a sprite something like maybe hanging out with a bat so the bat and cat playing basketball the rhyme sounds nice and you can also add you can also add code to the bat so for instance you see there's no code in the bat but there's still the code that remains from the cat sprite so I'll go ahead and go with the bat when I hit the space key to say hello so now when I hit space key both characters are moving at once so that's super cool that's kind of like the quick intro to scratch please do some questions if that didn't make sense and I think that was kind of an important place for us to start because with video sentencing we're gonna keep it we're gonna keep it very simple and really rely heavily on these event blocks and so without further ado let's go ahead and talk about video sensing so when you're in the editor I'm gonna go ahead and make a new project so if you're in the editor I want us all to quickly pull up the tutorial for video sensing so if you look in the top top left you'll see a tutorials button okay and that's gonna load an array of amazing tutorials I would totally recommend checking out some of these but today we're gonna look at video sensing so we'll scroll down and we'll see video sensing here so I'm gonna go ahead and click that okay so if you've never used a tutorial in scratch this is kind of the general sort of layout is it's gonna start with a video that gives you inspiration let's go ahead and check that video out really quick you can see here we have Zoe who is joining us via the video who is playing a musical instrument we had champ eeka who was petting the cat and then we also had sort of saving these minifigs as they were falling and so you can kind of get a glimpse of what is possible with video sensing and if you were to click the green arrow you'll then see the different steps that show you how it is you can make a video sensing project now fortunately you all have me today so I can help sort of guide you through this tutorial and we don't have to look at the steps but I would highly encourage folks to check out the de toros if you want so I got some feedback here that I should hide the bitly and add the extension yeah that's a really good that's a really good point so the first step that we want to do is to add the extension and so video sensing is what we call an extension and if you're not familiar with extensions extensions can be software so they could live on your computer or if they can be hardware so they can be a robot or some kind of device that you plug into your computer and so this video sensing is going to be a software extensions because it's using our webcam so I'm gonna go ahead and make sure you can see the extensions button so I'm gonna try to grab my cursor don't know where it is there it is Oh oh okay this is the most difficult part of this is finding it so no no you know okay you know what we're gonna we're gonna wing this right now I'm going to try something oh there we go okay so to add the extension step number one to a video sensing project check this out with me so the extensions live in the bottom left of the screen so we're gonna go ahead and click the bottom left this button here and we'll see all the different extensions so you can see we have Hardware extensions and software extensions so let's go ahead and click video sensing okay so we have just turned on video sensing and we noticed a couple of things happened two things one we now see ourselves in the stage which is looking good and two we see a number of new blocks to choose from so let's go ahead and quickly talk about the different blocks sort of introduce ourselves get familiar with the blocks so we can see here video sensing this is a hat block so when video motion exceeds ten this is one of my favorite blocks in scratch and we'll spend some time digging into this block in a second but I also want to show the set video transparency so this is an important block because as you can see you can see myself in in this stage but you notice it's kind of there's a little white haze that's going over my face right now and that's because the transparency of the video on the stage is at fifty percent and so if you don't feel like transparency is like how seethrough something is so I would like you all to see me better so I would like it to be less transparent so if we were to say let's make it twenty you can now see me a bit better so maybe I'll go to ten I like even better and maybe zero so now you can see me there is zero percent transparency I'm coming really clear it's just kind of like a webcam it's looking good I want to show you what 100 looks like okay so 100 you can't see anything right so let's go back to zero looking good all right so there's a couple other there's a couple other blocks here too that I want to check out one is turning the video on so video sensing it's going to turn the video on automatically and if that's not the case make sure that you give permissions in your browser you might have seen when you try to turn on video sensing something that appeared on your computer that said you do allow or disallow access your webcam you want to make sure that you say allow and if you do that it should automatically appear if for some reason during your project you want to turn off the video you could use this this block to turn off the video so I'm going to leave it on and then I thinkwell will pause and not sort of dig into this next box here this is a variable that's gonna store some of the values of video motion but we'll talk about that a bit later so let's dive in to the magic of video sensing and we're gonna hang out for maybe 10 15 minutes just using one one of these blocks and that is I think the most powerful Block in scratch and I'm super excited to share this with you and this I see a question is what's the straightforward definition of video sensing in scratch I hopefully it is hard to define so I'm hoping this can sort of help you understand what video sensing is so this block is saying when video motion exceeds ten so one thing to think about is video motion is the amount of motion that's gonna happen on the screen and it's specifically looking for video motion underneath the sprite so this is our sprite here and it's on a scale of 0 to 100 and so 0 would be no movement behind the sprite and 100 would be as much movement as we could possibly do so using that simple concept when video motion exceeds 10 which is just a light movement something can happen so I'll go ahead and try that so how about we I don't know make the cat meow when we touch it so go ahead grab a play sound meow until done okay so if all goes according to plan when we move oh sorry when we move our hand over the cat with some amount of motion a little bit amount of motion hopefully the Hat block will start the meow sound so let's go ahead and try this okay so this is like a noose it keeps me super powered because this is like a superpower so now you are controlling with your body actions that happen on the computer and you notice it sometimes it'll trigger even though I'm not doing anything and that's because it's somehow is seeing some type of movement on the wall it might be a shadow it might be a change of the light so what you might want to do is change the value to 30 so it's less sensitive let's try it just for the heck of it to make it 80 and see if it even works okay so if Easy's like a lot I'm getting an arm workout that's good but that's probably too high so one thing to know is tweak this value see what seems natural to you so I would say 20 in this condition 20 seems like natural enough I'm not over doing it and it is yeah so I think 20 feels good so like I said it's a one tip that I have above all else with video sensing is think about the code can be simple think about what it is you're trying to make so for instance with just this 2 block stack we have an awesome thing where the cat meows when we when we pet it so maybe we can say maybe we can try something else like I don't know maybe maybe we have the cat change color so one of my favorite blocks that we have in scratch is the change color effect block so it's in looks and then change color effect so now what's going to happen is when we pet the cat it will play the sound meow and then change the color of that okay cool so here's one thing with scratches I think I would like it when I pet it to change color and then yow so you'll notice the block sacs are kind of running in order so what I'm gonna do is I want to move up the block stack so now when I pet it it'll change color and then meow pretty cool all right let's try one other thing so it's kind of cool that the cat is change of color and meowing but let's have it move when we pet the cat so if we go to the motion blocks up top motion blocks are super see it is triggering a nothing motion blocks super powerful and I use them in almost every single project one of my favorite of the motion blocks is the slide to random position so the glide to random position is gonna do exactly what it says it's gonna take your character and have a glide to somewhere else on the screen so let's go ahead and do that so I will pull that in I think I want it to change color glide invent me I'll so let's see if it works okay cool very nice so you can see with with with just three blocks seriously just three blocks we've already created this like pretty cool program with video sensing I see there's a question of can we add more extensions with the video sensing you absolutely can so let's do that really quickly okay let's try let's try the voice extension this texttospeech extension so I will find my mouse cursor which is always missing okay and then I'm gonna add another extension which is texttospeech texttospeech is another it's like pretty simple to explain texttospeech let me actually get rid of I see you can see my video twice let's get rid of that no need to see me twice so texttospeech awesome extension super easy to explain to you just grab the blocker to speak and then you say what it is you want to speak so instead of them yell maybe I'll do maybe I'll do this meow meow meow okay the now doesn't sound totally like a cat so I'll maybe you can set the voice to to Alto which is I think a bit higher or squeaked let's try that as you can see meow super chill having fun okay cool so I promised you that it doesn't take a lot of blocks so oh here's one here's one here's an interesting that's happening normally when you make a scratch project you can hit the stop sign and the stop sign kind of shuts everything down which is good because sometimes have a project is going really crazy I should stop doing that project oh I'm really crazy you hit the stop sign and everything's pauses and stops with video sensing this half block is always gonna trigger no matter what I can hit the stop sign so I'm blue in the face but it's gonna keep going and that's because this hat block overrides the green flag so if ever like oh my gosh just too much going on what you do is disconnect disconnect your scripts from the hat block nothing's gonna happen it doesn't know what to do this event block has nothing hanging out underneath so you'll be good I run into that it's one of the biggest issues video sensing is what be in the background like they get a bunch of noise so yeah that is a pro tip right there so can you make an animation with video sensing that is a good question thanks for asking it and let's let's go ahead and do one now so I wanted to show you this anyways so let's go ahead win make a new project don't worry it's easy enough with video sensing to make something new really quickly so again you see me I'm ghosted I kind of don't like that ghosted book so I'm gonna make sure that I'm setting my transparency to zero now you see me better so let's make an animation let's make a drum let's make a drum that we can hit let's make an instrument yeah so a scratch cat I'm gonna have to say goodbye to you so I'm gonna go ahead and remove scratch cat so scratch that's gone I have no sprites let's go ahead and pick a drum sprite so go ahead I just hope so I did that really quickly again I'm gonna add a new sprite going down here click add I am going to click the drum looks like the drum I'm going to search for a drum and notice that we have so many drums to choose from but it's kind of wild let's try as let's try the drum kit okay so we're gonna keep it this might look pretty similar to the cat animation that we did so I want I want us to think about animation so animation can mean a lot of things it can mean it can mean growing and shrinking it can mean tilting it could mean changing costumes and so I want to show you both so when video motion exceeds 10 our super power block the best Block in scratch wind video motion exceeds 10 let's have it grow and shrink let's have bad animations over okay so let's go to the looks category looks category purple category it's gonna have your size in there it's gonna have like that color effect block that we had earlier so let's go ahead and look at the set size block so set size to 100 this is currently 100 if we set size to say 200 let's see what looks like boom okay cool so how about wind video motion exceeds 10 let's set the size to 100 now let's set it to 200 okay so when we hit that it's gonna go 200 and then let's have a wait one second and then shrink back down so 200 wait one second let's have a wait point five seconds and then let's have it go back down so again that's good oh now are you triggered okay cool it's like I feel like it needs a sound and so it's cool about the the drum sprites any any instruments right is they have some sounds builtin so if we go to the sounds category here we can drag out play lowtom which i think is the sound so it may be 0.5 Seulong I think playing fives too long probably my thighs a little too long so maybe we do like point two okay I can't use I actually hit Siri on my laptop okay cool and then one other things I said so maybe to use okay a little sensitive so let me disconnect the block I also mentioned so you can change the size that is certainly one way to animate it but I also want to show you this concept of costumes so if you're not familiar we see our character our sprite here there's this magical tab called costumes where in the drum set in this case has another sort of costume another look to it so you see it says drum kit and drum kit B and so these are the two costumes it has and so you can see as I toggle between these costumes this is changing yeah so what if we could do this with like code and I don't have to continue to click this that would be nice well there is a way in scratch so what we'll do is we'll go to looks there is the next costume block so that will switch automatic to the next costume so but let's let's think we're to add this into our script so so we expand to 200% we're playing the sound let's change the costume okay expand sound costume change weight set size okay cool I mean I don't know simple animation using wow there's so many questions out sorry there's so many questions so that you get to but hopefully that helps you put understand how it is you can I really gotta undo these blots how it is you can animate drums in scratch can you use color sensing with video sensing yes you absolutely can I will get to that a bit later cuz that's a bit more complex can you make a platformer with video sensing you know what I'm glad you asked you can you can make even like one better than a platformer so here's it here let me show you this is gonna sound kind of silly but imagine you could actually play Mario which sounds weird but one thing to know about video sensing is what if you what if you stood way back from the camera what if your way back here and you were running and you were grabbing things as they came and so I could probably quickly show you what that might look like but let me let me suggest to you that that is totally possible that would probably take about 15 minutes to show you but let me show you a somewhat similar idea that might get you inspired by this and so let me create a game that kind of exists in that sort of platformer space and so that is a game that we're gonna play where were the character and we're really small and we're gonna be running from something so I'm going to I'm gonna create a bug I'm gonna create a bug so no I'll go with our friend in the back so what if instead of a platformer we did something where the bat is flying around trying to touch us which I don't know yeah not a bad thing maybe it's a good thing maybe we want to get touched by that back so anyways I will set the size because if that's a little little big a little small now well that's too big so I'm gonna set the size of the bat to 50 I think okay so we have a bat flying around so what if the game was we have to avoid the bat yeah not quite a platformer but again it's like I'm using my body I'm like running so simple let's have the bat flyer on the screen I can do this with three blocks when greenside clicked I told you my spike one of my favorite motion blocks glide to random position so let's click that so we see okay that's cool when we hit the green flag it's gonna glide but we want that to continue to happen so I'm gonna go ahead and wrap that in forever forever loop so the bat is always moving okay so you can see I'm kind of trying to avoid it okay cool but but it's not interactive right like I could do that it's kind of fun it's kind of cool but like what if what if we made it a game where I like if it touches me it says something or makes a sound so we can do that with video sensing and we'll do it with the same kind of sort of setup that we had earlier so wind video sensing exceeds ten so when the bat is kind of hitting me because I'm in the way it'll it'll do something so maybe we'll have it play a sound the stand let's do a laugh yeah so I'm gonna add a sound so I'm doing that really quick so the bat it's right has the owl sound but the owl sound isn't kind of like what I'm going for so I'm going to change the sound by going down here sorry the url's blocking this but there's just a little speaker icon to choose a sound and then I'll choose something weird I don't know if the basketball sound why not so with so when when the bat touches me it's going to play the basketball sound okay so the game is to avoid the bat okay so now it's triggering like crazy so I'm going to change the sensitivity to 30 because it's triggering on something that I don't know what what it's triggering on and again that's that idea of 10 might not be the best so let's go ahead okay figure down a watt now so let me try to go 60 okay so it's not perfect I told you I was gonna make mistakes so what's happening is the bat is triggering on some type of motion that it's seeing on the background and not just me so that is to say the biggest sensing is not perfect but the kind of concept of what we're doing here what the logic does works let me try 90 and see if we can't get it to work and then if it doesn't I'm gonna stop this demo yeah it is so interesting that is triggering on the background so video sensing isn't perfect and we should be guys just as you're creating build around knowing that it's not gonna be perfect cool so how do you get your own sounds is a good question thanks for asking so say we didn't want the basketball sound what we can do is we can go to the sounds tab of the of the sprite and record our own sounds so there's a couple ways to do this I mean get rid of let me get rid of the thing on the bottom get rid of bitly okay so the question is how can you get your own sounds there's a number different ways so one way you can do it is you can record your own sound so if you go down to the bottom left here you can hit record give permission to use their microphone then go boom and then you can save your sound you can name it so that's one way to do it there's another way in which you can upload from your computer so if you have a sound that you saved on your computer already you can go ahead and upload it this way and then you can also choose from the library of sounds the libraries like super awesome there's so different sounds in their toy check that out I'm kind of bummed that our little back game didn't work let me try it one more time at 95 to shoot the 95 sensitivity is gonna is gonna do it for us now it's just so sensitive on that wall anyways so I'm gonna play with so how do you get your own sound we did that one would have let me pull up some of these questions thank you so much for all these amazing questions I'm just gonna try to again find my mouse cursor because it's always disappearing on me what if you don't know where the blocks are because my first time using scratch oh that's a good question so I think the question is what it what if is your first time using scratching don't know where the blocks are I would suggest if it's your first time using scratch maybe what I would do is I would check out in the tutorials window I would check out the getting started with scratch activity or the imagine a world activity so I just clicked imagine the world this particular tutorial introduces you to a lot of the introductory blocks in scratch or some of the more basic blocks in scratch and it's gonna give you sort of a nice understanding of what is available and so it's gonna introduce you to looks blocks to sound blocks to event blocks things like that and to be honest it might seem like there's a lot of blocks in scratch but I kind of typically hang out with just like maybe like 15 to 20 of them I tend to use the motion blocks a lot I'm always making my characters move and turn I'm using the glide block as I mentioned I think the looks block again thus a block is super powerful some of these more introductory blocks and I say introductory but I just mean that they're there I don't know pretty straightforward and they are incredibly powerful and then I also think that the play sound and play sound until done blocks are super super powerful and I use them quite a lot so I would say it's doing those two things okay how do you make a pong game using video sensing that is a good question so just like any sort of any and any game in scratch can be converted to a video sensing game so if you were to create a a pong game I guess you could say when when I touch we can play pong with the bat so when I sort of touch the bat have it glide across the screen so let's try to make that script really quick so when video motion exceeds ten let's have it move ten steps so let's see what happens okay cool so not quite there let's try it again okay so not quite palm so what we can do is instead of having it move just ten steps we can have it move ten steps in a loop so that will make it move even more so let's go ahead and put that in a loop so ten times so now I'll take it off from the biggest sensing when I click that it will move so let's do that yeah okay so we see it's moving now ten steps ten times so it's 100 pixels across the screen let's try something more like 30 so you can see now it's moving quite fast across the screen so we can attach that now to our stack okay pretty cool I'm trying to think how it is we would do this in a way where it's like pong where it bounces back and forth you know I wish I had a cohost cuz I I have a feeling Zoey would know how to do this that's a really good question I'm trying to think what I would suggest doing is checking out in the scratch community I'll pull this up right now it's okay not to have the answers I'm sorry I do think a pong game might take it take some time so I'm gonna model when I have an idea that I don't quite know how to solve now what I do is for pong game and what I'll do is I'll pull up a pong game for instance starter pong and what I'll do is I'll play the project and go like okay cool I see how this works okay pretty cool so what I'll do is I'll bet and say like okay let's see inside let's see what the code looks like so the code it looks like the paddle has its own sprite and we're setting the paddle to Mouse X and so then what I would do is I would probably add the video sensing extension so I'm gonna go ahead and do that and then I would start to manipulate this project to say okay Winn have bit of sensing on trying to hit the ball and see what happened so it looks like there is something here the code says when the ball is touching the paddle go in the random position start sound I don't know why today I'm sorry I can't I can't no I don't it's not kind of there's a way you should do it you know what here's you should do it and then share it in the studio and then next week next week when I do is well Zoey will do cos Zoey we closed ting we're gonna show that project we're gonna show a video sensing pong sorry so that that is my non answer answer which is check out other projects in the community and get the gear spinning on what it is you might do what is the difference between play sound thanks to the question by the way what is the difference between play sound and play sound until done that is a good question that haunts everyone as they get used to scratch so there's a very important difference between place on place sound done so let's pull out both of those blocks really quick so play sound play sound until done so let's go let's let's model this so if we were to play the sound you know what I want to get a longer sound for this I want to model it with a longer sound and I'm also gonna pull up the URL so you all could ask more questions sorry friends jeez Louise okay so I want to model this with a with a much longer sound so you can kind of get the understanding of what's going on here we go okay so I will pull up I'm gonna choose what I know is the long sound so and the bat sprite I'm gonna go to sounds I'm gonna pull up a sound from the library that is the loop okay so that is an eightsecond song it's very chill so the play sound until done is going to play that sound until it is done it's gonna play the entire eight seconds of that really chill awesome majestic sound so it's gonna that's gonna play all eight seconds so if I were to put that into a loop what happens playing as playing and playing for six seconds in were seven seconds in so okay now we've read every started so it's gonna play the eight seconds in loop forever good for the background of your project do that let's try something else let's try it now the play sound block just a place on block sound so what what it's trying to do is it's like hitting the play button like 100 times a second and so it's not gonna play all 80 seconds it's gonna just try to keep starting to sound start time so that's um so you only get like the first millisecond of the sound so never put start sounds into a forever loop that's the number one thing well yeah if you're gonna get this you're gonna get this so but so that that's that's kind of like the one reason but I also want to share something that is important and I shouldn't say you should never use them in a forever loop I'm going to show you why say you want your cat to like you to be like moving as it's like playing the chill music so we'll bring up our back here so we have our bat here and if we want to have the bat the gliding around the screen as the music is playing we'll want to do start sound and I'll show you why so start sound chill and then we'll have the bat move so again this script is gonna say start the sound chill play that eight seconds and while that's happening why so we see the sound started playing now the difference is if you if you wanted to that effect but use place on until done you have to wait eight seconds waiting waiting reading and then it moves so if you want the music to play underneath start the sound and then other things could happen in the script yeah so that's that's the difference between play sound plays on until then I gotta tell you the amount of times that I've done this is wild so don't feel bad if you've done that I do it all the time you're awesome thank you I've slowed down how quickly I'm talking when I started I was really excited I'm still really excited but I was talking too quickly so sorry about that anyways I wanted to show you one of the cool thing with video sensing that involves the play sound and I think play sounds chill is the perfect example of what it is you can do with this so remember we just created some really cool background music so we're like chillin it's cool so what if we made a dance party and the idea is if you are moving the song would play and if you're not moving this one doesn't play so let's try that so again we have our background spray it sounds cool it's chill okay so how do we do this I want to show you a block that we haven't talked about yet messing the video sensing blocks so I'm going back to video sensing and it's this block right here so let's take 10 to 15 seconds to talk about this block this is a variable so this is gonna have stored values in it stored values yeah from 0 to 100 and the values can change so in this case it's the motion on the sprite so let's see quickly with what that looks like there's values in it if we click the value we can see the value pop up really quickly so 9 0 2 4 that's the amount of motion that's happening underneath the sprite you can also detect the amount of motion on this stage so the entire stage happening here so as I move around the stage we can see it's like 80 90 okay so what if we did this what if we said set the volume set the volume of the sound to the amount of movement so if there's a lot of movement on the stage 100 it's gonna be a hundred volume it's gonna be really loud and if there's no movement we're not gonna hear anything okay so using this block let's let's try that so so when I hit the green flag when I hit the green flag for ever be doing this and what we wanted to be doing for ever we wanted to be setting the volume so there is a set volume block here set volume so forever he's setting the volume to the amount of motion on the stage before we do this I also want to create a really really simple script that's going to show us the value of the variable so I also want it to forever be showing us the value of the variable and the way in which you show the value of the variable is to put it in a safe lock so when I hit the green flag forever forever say the value so grab a save lock forever say this value and this value again is gonna be hanging out between 0 and 100 so I'll grab that and again it's forever say the amount of motion on the backdrop so let's see if it works so again sorry that was a lot of things so and this is what I like to do when I'm when I'm scratching and I and I've just done a couple things I like to just digest and say what did I just do so we have and you can even you can even comment the code I'll add a comment this is for background music okay that's our background music that's for ever play the sound chill this is I'm gonna add a comment this is letting us know a little say box neck up here here on the thing on this right it's gonna say the value so that's gonna be value and then this is our set volume script which is setting the volume to the amount of emotion on stage let's try it out okay I don't know if it's coming through on the speakers that well but it does work so if I if I have like no movement on the screen no one's here it's you know it's weird it's cool I would suggest trying that you can make your own little dance party get weird with it so yeah the amount of motion on the stage linked in with another block is super super fun so anyways that was a long way to answer that question what occasions are good for video sensing I would say I would say but with video sensing you can make stories you can make games you can make animations I really do think anything that you feel like can be triggered so if you're thinking about collecting coins shooting a basketball interacting with an object those are all really great things for video tempting but I do think what I chose like 10 minutes ago were used to going this fast community look at their product and say like hey like how can i how can I use video sensing now I even show you there's also something like super simple for kid even about let's just do the simplest code let's just do this simplest code to make like a filter like a snapchat filter so I'll choose a new sprite nom to do the Hat so here we see the Hat okay pretty cool maybe make it a little bit bigger make it 200 so like even just like that there's no code here and it's super cool but maybe we can actually we can do something even cooler maybe when we hit the space key we can change the costume so we notice there's four different hats here so we can make super simple script win space key switch to the next costume yeah just just play with I mean there's just there's just too much here there's just it's good for everything that's another not answer I'm sorry I do I do want to be mindful of time thank you all so much for your questions looks like we have now about eight minutes and so I want to make sure that we have a chance to show you how it is you can save your project and then share your project into a studio and I'm just gonna double check with my handy dandy schedule to make sure that's what videos we're doing next okay yeah so now that we've made a project I want to introduce this idea of like what what do you do with the project so want to make sure that the project is saved somewhere and so you can see here in the scratch editor we have we have to have no project let me just make a project really quick let's go back here let's go ahead and let's do our cat meowing project really quick so again that was super easy I've got a AB cat at the cat at the camp okay add the cat win video and motion ten starts ah meow okay make sure it works okay that's going okay so I have a project that I feel oh my god let's see the the the stop sign isn't gonna stop it you have to disconnect the box anyways so if you want to save it to your account you'll need an account so if you don't already have a scratch account you should make one scratch is awesome it's free do it so you hit the join button here if you already have an account you can go ahead and sign in so I'm gonna go ahead and sign into my cow speak locally which is a play off of speak visually which is my other username so you can see now I'm logged in to my scratch count and I'm going to hit the giant share button maybe before I share I want to name it so pet the cat okay get the cat okay and then I'm gonna hit that big ol orange share button okay now what happens when I hit the share button okay now I'm taken to this screen this screen yin is where the project is now shared in the scratch online community it is now available to the millions of scratchers out there what you might want to do is give instructions for people so like use all caps use your hands to look at the CAD tool and now you can if you want to share it like you're super excited and you'd like blasts it to all your friends and family the URL to the project is up here so you just copy paste this URL right here you can send it to anyone they'll be taken to this page they can love it they can favorite it they can play with your virtual cat it's super cool and if you want you can share your project into the studio that we have for today's create along which I actually lost the tab for so I'm gonna try to reopen it which is two video sensing which is you know what I didn't lose it it was just in another it was in another tab so if you want to share your project into the studio what you can do is you can have to log in eat locally okay so the studio by the way the studio description is in the link below this video so the studio description is in the link below and so you can go ahead and do it that way and then you just hit add project when you hit add project what you'll see is this button here to add and then you go ahead and add it like that and you've successfully added your project to the studio and so next week what we'll do is we will check out all of the incredible projects that were created doing this video sensing and in the meantime I'm kind of out of stuff for us to talk about I want to thank you for all the questions that you that you shared thanks for bearing with me as I was kind of getting my feet wet with all this whole live streaming thing I am so glad that next week Zoe is going to be taking over maybe I can go host another another week but it was a lot of fun and I really do encourage folks when you're making a video sensing project to think about keeping it simple thinking about that magical I'm gonna pull this up again that super magical wind video motion exceeds ten block that is just like the portal to so many cool things don't think about over complicating it and if you want to if you're kind of struggling for inspiration do check out the scratch online community there's a lot of really great projects and you can easily remix by introducing video sensing and so as you work on your projects throughout the week please do share in the studio super excited to next week show it off and definitely talking to you the person who asked the question about making a video sensing pong because I can't wait to play it so I hope you end up doing that and I want to thank again so EJC Natalie other folks from the rock team who have been helping behind the scenes with the create along and with that I think I'm going to get my long overdue glass of water say goodbye and want to thank you all again for hanging out for the entire hour I see there's 350 of you so happy scratching scratch on I'm gonna log off might take a nap kind of tired I hope you take a nap that was a lot of creating anyways wishing everyone well see you later as well I'm gonna have to figure out how to stop the stream so you're gonna awkwardly be looking at me for the next five seconds as I try to find a mouse cursor okay I found the end stream button I'm going to end the stream see y'all later
