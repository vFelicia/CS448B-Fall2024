00:10 - Today, I'm working on a Scratch
project that involves sound.
00:13 - Let's explore some of the ways
that you can add sound
00:15 - to Scratch projects.
00:16 - Under the Sounds tab
on the project editor,
00:19 - when you're looking 
at the Sound menu,
00:20 - you'll notice there are options
to choose a sound,
00:23 - record a sound,
or upload a sound.
00:27 - Do not upload
materials under copyright.
00:30 - Please keep each of your files
under ten megabytes.
00:33 - And be sure that your upload
follows the Community Guidelines
00:36 - and does not reveal
personal information.
00:38 - I'm going to show you choosing
a sound from the sound library
00:41 - and recording a sound.
00:42 - I'm also going to show you
an additional technique
00:45 - to add sound to Scratch
using text to speech blocks.
00:48 - You can scroll through 
the sound library
00:49 - and choose a sound you like.
00:53 - Hover over the sounds
to hear what they sound like.
00:56 - Back on the Code tab,
00:57 - I have a couple of choices
for sound blocks.
00:59 - Let's choose the “start
a sound” block.
01:01 - And I'm going to
choose the “meow” sound.
01:03 - Let's put it before this “say”
block and see what happens.
01:06 - [Meow]
01:08 - Now, let's see what 
the difference is
01:10 - if we use the “play sound
until done” block.
01:12 - [Meow]
01:15 - Did you notice the difference?
01:18 - To record a sound, choose
“record” from the Sound menu.
01:20 - You can see the audio meter
01:22 - here on the side
registering the sounds
01:24 - that it's hearing in the room.
01:25 - And when I'm ready,
I'll hit the “record” button.
01:29 - Let's fly.
01:32 - I can check it out
to see what it sounds like.
01:34 - [Let's fly.]
01:35 - I can also use these sliders
01:37 - to edit out the parts
that I don't need,
01:39 - like the empty space before
and after I was talking.
01:43 - Let's play my recording 
after “meow.”
01:46 - [Meow] [Let's fly.]
01:50 - What if I want the parrot
to have a different voice
01:52 - than Scratch Cat?
01:53 - I can record my voice
in different ways.
01:57 - Silly Scratch Cat,
cats can't fly.
02:00 - Silly Scratch Cat,
cats can't fly.
02:04 - Or I can record my normal
voice and edit the sounds later.
02:09 - Silly Scratch Cat,
cats can't fly.
02:13 - Once I have my sound recorded,
I can also use tools
02:16 - in the sound editor to 
edit the sound.
02:18 - Let's cut out the parts
that I don't need.
02:20 - [Silly Scratch Cat,
cats can't fly.]
02:23 - That's the part I’m keeping.
02:24 - So I'm going to select
the other parts
02:25 - that I don't want
and click to delete.
02:27 - If I have my sound
go slower or faster,
02:30 - it can change
the pitch of the sound.
02:32 - [Silly Scratch Cat,
cats can't fly.]
02:38 - Now, let's test
our whole program.
02:40 - [Meow] [Let's fly.]
02:42 - [Silly Scratch Cat, 
cats can’t fly.]
02:45 - Maybe I don't want to 
record my own voice.
02:47 - Maybe it's too loud in 
the room where I'm at.
02:49 - But I would still love my users
to be able to hear the words
02:52 - as they're being 
shown on the screen.
02:53 - Let's try the 
text to speech extension.
02:55 - To find that extension, I'm 
going to go down to this menu
02:58 - in the lower left-hand corner,
03:00 - and I'm going to look for
“text to speech.”
03:02 - Notice that it says
this requires the Internet.
03:05 - Once I click on the text
to speech extension,
03:07 - you see I have 
some new blocks here.
03:09 - I'm first going to 
select a voice.
03:11 - Now, I'm going to 
add a “speak” block,
03:12 - and I'm going to type
my words into the “speak” block.
03:15 - Let's add these blocks 
to my code.
03:17 - [Meow] [Let's fly.]
03:21 - This is all looking pretty good.
03:23 - But let's try a little technique
that I like so that the words
03:26 - appear on the screen
03:27 - at the same time
that they are being spoken.
03:28 - To do this, I'm going to go back
to my Looks category, and instea
03:31 - of grabbing a “say” block with 
a time associated with it, 
03:34 - I'm going to grab two 
“say” blocks 
03:35 - that have no time
associated with them.
03:37 - In the first one, I'm going
to type the text that I want.
03:40 - In the second one,
03:41 - I'm going to delete all the text
to leave it blank.
03:43 - Now what I will do is
I will move
03:45 - the first “say” block
with the text 
03:47 - above the “speak” block.
03:48 - I will then put the second
“say” block that is blank
03:51 - below the “speak” block.
03:53 - I'm going to quickly 
remove this wait.
03:56 - [Silly Scratch Cat,
cats can't fly.]
03:59 - The words appear on the screen
04:00 - for as long as it takes
to speak them.
04:03 - [Meow] [Let's fly.]
04:05 - [Silly Scratch
Cat, cats can't fly.]
04:09 - The possibilities are endless.
What will you create?
