00:00 - - Hi everyone, it's Zoë
from the Scratch team,
00:02 - also known as Zinnea.
00:03 - Today I wanted to show you
00:05 - how to make a catch game in Scratch.
00:07 - A game where objects
are falling from the sky
00:09 - and you catch them to score points.
00:10 - It could be any object that's falling,
00:12 - and it can be any character
or object that's catching it.
00:14 - We'll break this into five steps.
00:16 - Move the catcher, make
your object go to the top,
00:20 - fall down, catch it, and keep score.
00:25 - Let's get started.
00:26 - First, let's pick the character or object
00:28 - that you want to be catching things,
00:30 - and we're gonna make it
move with the arrow keys.
00:32 - You can just click this button
that says, Choose a Sprite,
00:34 - and you can pick anything you want.
00:36 - I'll use the bowl, and
let's add a backdrop too.
00:39 - I'll use the boardwalk.
00:41 - So, we want the bowl to be
able to move side to side
00:44 - with the arrow keys, so that it can catch
00:46 - whatever's gOnna be falling.
00:47 - We can use this block, change X by 10
00:49 - to make the ball go this way.
00:51 - Let's make the ball do this,
00:53 - if the right arrow key is pressed.
00:55 - There's a really helpful block for this,
00:57 - which is an if then block.
00:58 - In case you haven't seen
an if then block before,
01:00 - here's how they work.
01:01 - I find that they're really easy to use.
01:03 - If then blocks will make a Sprite
01:05 - do the code that's in here,
01:07 - only if the thing that's in here is true.
01:11 - So in this example,
01:12 - if the cat is touching the mouse pointer
01:14 - it will play the sound, meow,
01:16 - but if it's not touching
the mouse pointer,
01:18 - it won't play any sound.
01:19 - So in our game, if the
right arrow key is pressed,
01:24 - we can make the bowl change X by 10.
01:26 - Let's try it out, and let's make it start
01:28 - when I click the green flag.
01:30 - So, I'm pressing the right arrow key
01:32 - but nothing is happening.
01:34 - That's because this if then block
01:36 - is only being checked once.
01:37 - When I click the green flag,
01:39 - it's asking, is the right
arrow being pressed right now?
01:42 - But then it just stops doing the code.
01:43 - And what we want it to
do, is always be checking
01:47 - if the right arrow key
is pressed at any moment.
01:49 - So, we can just put this
inside a forever loop.
01:52 - And now, now this is what we want.
01:55 - It's always checking, is the
right arrow key being pressed?
01:58 - And to make the bowl go to the left,
01:59 - instead of changing X by
10, we can change X by -10.
02:04 - Let's make it do this, if the
left arrow key is pressed.
02:07 - And let's put this in
the forever loop too.
02:10 - There we go, now we have a catcher
02:12 - that we can move with the arrow keys.
02:14 - Next, let's pick the object
that we want to be falling
02:16 - and make it go to the top of the screen.
02:18 - You can use any object you want.
02:20 - I'll use the apple.
02:22 - At the beginning of the game,
02:23 - We want the apple to start
at a random place at the top.
02:27 - This block, go to random position,
02:29 - will make it go to a random place.
02:31 - And this block, set Y, can
set how high up a Sprite is.
02:36 - In Scratch, Y represents
how far a Sprite is
02:39 - from the bottom of the screen
to the top of the screen.
02:41 - So if we set Y to zero,
02:43 - the apple goes up to about the middle.
02:45 - If we set Y at 20, it
goes up a little higher,
02:47 - and 180 makes it go
all the way to the top.
02:50 - Now, if we make the apple
go to a random position
02:52 - and then set Y to 180,
it goes to a random place
02:55 - but then Y is always set to be at the top,
02:58 - And that's just what we want.
02:59 - When the game starts,
03:00 - it starts at a random place
at the top of the screen.
03:02 - Now, let's make our apple fall down.
03:04 - If we change, Y by 10,
the apple goes upwards.
03:08 - To make it go down, we can
put in a negative number.
03:11 - And if we put this inside a forever loop,
03:13 - it'll keep falling until
it hits the bottom.
03:15 - But now it's stuck.
03:16 - So right now, we have an
apple that can fall one time,
03:19 - what we would like it to do
03:20 - is if it's at the bottom,
it goes to the top.
03:23 - This is another good time
to use an if then block.
03:25 - So let's drag one out.
03:27 - In here, we need to put some code
03:29 - that checks if the apple is at the bottom.
03:31 - Now, how can we tell if
the apple is at the bottom?
03:34 - Well, remember how I said
03:35 - that Y represents how high up a Sprite is,
03:38 - let's look at the apple's
Y while it's falling.
03:40 - Its Y position starts at 180,
03:43 - then it goes to 170, 160, it gets to zero,
03:46 - then it goes to -10, -20.
03:48 - And then down here, it's like -170.
03:50 - So what we can test in here is,
03:52 - we can just check if the
Y position of the apple
03:54 - is less than -170.
03:56 - 'Cause if the apple's
Y position is that low,
03:59 - then we know it must be at the bottom.
04:01 - So to test that, we can drag
out this round blue block
04:04 - that says Y position, and drag
out the green less than block
04:08 - from the operator's category.
04:10 - This block just checks
if the thing on this side
04:13 - is less than the thing on this side.
04:14 - We want to check if Y is less than -170.
04:17 - So we can put Y on this
side, and write -170.
04:21 - Now, if the apple is at the bottom,
04:23 - what do we want it to do?
04:24 - Well, we want it to go back up to the top,
04:26 - and we actually already
have the code for that
04:28 - because we wrote it right here.
04:29 - So, let's just put a copy
of that same code in here.
04:32 - And let's put this code
inside our forever loop.
04:35 - So every time the apple moves down by -5,
04:38 - it asks, am I at the bottom?
04:40 - There we go.
04:41 - Now we have an apple that can fall,
04:42 - and when it gets to the bottom,
it goes back up to the top.
04:44 - Now, let's make it so that we
can actually catch the apples
04:47 - instead of them just
falling through the bowl.
04:49 - If the apple touches the bowl,
then the player caught it.
04:52 - So it should stop falling
04:54 - and go back to the top somewhere else
04:56 - so it can start falling again.
04:57 - So, this is another good
time for an if then block.
05:00 - There's this helpful block that says,
05:01 - touching mouse-pointer,
05:02 - and instead of mouse-pointer,
I can choose bowl.
05:06 - And now this block will test
05:07 - if the apple is touching the bowl.
05:09 - And if the apple is touching the bowl,
05:11 - we want it to go back to the top.
05:13 - And again, that's just
our same code from before
05:15 - that makes it go to the top.
05:17 - Let's put this inside a forever loop,
05:20 - and let's make it play a
sound when we catch it.
05:22 - Nice. Lastly, let's add a score
05:25 - so that you get points
for every apple you catch.
05:28 - To make a score, We can add a variable.
05:31 - If you haven't seen this before,
05:32 - a variable lets you keep track
05:34 - of a certain number in your project.
05:36 - So, we can make a variable called Score
05:39 - and use it to keep track of
how many points we've scored.
05:42 - We can use this change score by one block
05:44 - to make the score increase,
05:46 - and we can put this block here
05:48 - so every time we catch the apple,
05:50 - the score increases by one.
05:52 - And when the game starts,
let's set the score to zero.
05:56 - So it resets, there we go.
05:58 - That's a catch game.
05:59 - Anyway, that's basically what
I wanted to show you today.
06:02 - I love catch games 'cause
I feel like they can be
06:04 - any type of game based on
the objects that are falling
06:07 - and the character or the
object that's catching them,
06:09 - and the backdrop you choose.
06:11 - You could be catching pieces of trash
06:12 - to keep an ocean clean,
06:14 - or a pet could be catching
treats, or just really anything.
06:18 - I'm so excited to see
all the things you make.
06:20 - Well, I'll see you next
time, and Scratch on.
06:23 - (upbeat music)

Hi everyone, it's Zoë from the Scratch team, also known as Zinnea. Today I wanted to show you how to make a catch game in Scratch. A game where objects are falling from the sky and you catch them to score points. It could be any object that's falling, and it can be any character or object that's catching it. We'll break this into five steps. Move the catcher, make your object go to the top, fall down, catch it, and keep score. Let's get started.

This block just checks if the thing on this side is less than the thing on this side. We want to check if Y is less than 170. So we can put Y on this side, and write 170. Now, if the apple is at the bottom, what do we want it to do? Well, we want it to go back up to the top, and we actually already have the code for that because we wrote it right here. So, let's just put a copy of that same code in here. And let's put this code inside our forever loop. So every time the apple moves down by 5, it asks, am I at the bottom? There we go.

So it should stop falling and go back to the top somewhere else so it can start falling again. So, this is another good time for an if then block. There's this helpful block that says, touching mousepointer, and instead of mousepointer, I can choose bowl. And now this block will test if the apple is touching the bowl.
