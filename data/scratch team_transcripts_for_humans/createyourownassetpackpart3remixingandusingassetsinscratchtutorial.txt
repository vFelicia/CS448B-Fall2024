00:09 - Hi, I'm Maren 
00:10 - (a.k.a. algorithmar
from the Scratch Team),
00:13 - and I just found
this great asset
00:15 - from STEAM for Vietnam that
I want to use in my project.
00:18 - If you find an asset
from another user's asset pack
00:22 - that you'd like to use
in your project,
00:24 - let's explore ways to add
the asset to your project.
00:27 - #1) If I'm logged in, I can
remix the asset pack project
00:32 - to access all the assets.
00:35 - #2) If I only want to use
specific objects
00:38 - from the asset pack, rather
than remixing the whole project,
00:42 - I can use the backpack feature
to collect individual sprites,
00:45 - costumes, or sounds.
00:47 - However, I need to be logged in
to access the backpack feature.
00:52 - #3) Whether logged in or not,
or using the online
00:56 - or offline editor,
00:58 - I could also export
individual sprites, costumes, or
01:01 - sounds to my computer desktop
and then upload them
01:04 - into my project
in the online or offline editor.
01:09 - If using the backpack,
01:10 - at the bottom of the screen,
click to expand the backpack.
01:13 - Then drag and drop
01:14 - the desired assets to the
backpack area to save them.
01:20 - If you're
using the offline editor
01:22 - and have no way of publicly
sharing your project,
01:25 - you can export assets
you've created 
01:27 - to share them 
with friends and fellow users.
01:29 - You can also use the export
feature to collect assets
01:33 - if you're accessing the online
editor while not logged in,
01:36 - or if you prefer the export
method over the backpack.
01:40 - If exporting,
right-click on the asset
01:43 - and choose “export”
from the menu.
01:46 - Backpacking or exporting
an entire sprite will create one
01:49 - file containing all the sprite’s
costumes, sounds, and code.
01:53 - That's why creating backdrop 
assets as sprites,
01:55 - instead of backdrops,
can be helpful.
01:58 - If the backdrop was created
as a sprite,
02:00 - you'll need to first
02:01 - drag it from the backpack
into the sprite area,
02:04 - or upload it as a sprite.
02:06 - Then, you may choose to drag
the backdrop sprite costume
02:09 - to the backdrop area,
as well as any sounds.
02:13 - Once it is set as a backdrop,
you can delete it as a sprite.
02:16 - Now, you can use the backdrop
code blocks like
02:19 - “switch backdrop”
to code it as usual.
02:22 - Or if I exported the asset
in the online or offline editor,
02:26 - I can use the upload options
in the sprite, costume, and
02:30 - sound menus to upload the asset
into my project from my files.
02:35 - Scratch embraces remix culture.
02:37 - Remixing is when you build upon
someone else's projects, code, 
02:41 - ideas, images, or anything else 
they share on Scratch 
02:45 - to make your own 
unique creation.
02:47 - When you've added an asset
from another Scratcher
02:50 - into your project,
02:51 - consider what you might add
to make it your own.
02:54 - Perhaps you add code
to animate the asset
02:57 - or place it in a new scene
with other assets.
03:00 - Add related sounds.
03:02 - Use the tools in the paint
or sound editor
03:04 - to make adjustments to it.
03:06 - Add additional assets
03:07 - to the pack
that you felt were missing, etc.
03:11 - Just make sure that before
you share your new creation,
03:13 - you've given credit to whomever
created the asset 
03:15 - in the Notes and Credits
section of your project page.
03:28 - We can't wait
to see what you’ll create!
