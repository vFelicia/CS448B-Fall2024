programming language on the Internet and
00:04 - I came across Scratch as soon as I
shared my first project I got instant
00:08 - feedback and I was like okay I want to
continue with this I remember my first
00:11 - project was a super simple animation I'm
still actually really proud of my first
00:15 - project it opened my eyes to the
different possibilities that coding can
00:19 - present so I've been drawing basically
since preschool when I liked how to hold
00:24 - a crayon I think making art with scratch
is different because I can collaborate
00:29 - with other people and make something
interactive that other people can use
00:32 - there was a song that said happy happy
birthday
00:36 - I put scratch in there it just became an
instant hit on the side and fire going
00:42 - people to make their own songs and
remixes everyone can do anything with my
00:47 - products and sometimes it's really funny
how they change things at the end it
00:51 - just goes to show like how much you can
actually do with all the things you have
00:55 - in scratch when you're looking at other
people's projects you're engaging on
00:59 - such a different level which really
encourages this kind of mindset of
01:04 - seeing yourself and each other as makers
of things and not just consumers so I
01:09 - never thought that I could do like the
coding part like I thought like
01:13 - absolutely I'm a grown-up and like hire
someone to code it for me but then I was
01:16 - like hey I can actually do this myself
it gets more complex but once you know
01:21 - the basics you can add on to your
knowledge and move at your own pace
01:24 - if you like solving problems if you like
drawing if you like making music if
01:29 - you're into anything scratchy is for you
you
