00:00 - everyone its feet visually here from the
00:02 - scratch team at MIT and I have something
00:04 - to share with you something pretty cool
00:05 - so imagine this imagine you're creating
00:08 - a scratch project for space so the
00:10 - person playing it is floating around
00:12 - what would you create maybe a game where
00:14 - they float and they collect coins or
00:16 - maybe it's an animation where they're
00:18 - flying through the sky
00:19 - it sounds pretty surreal but here's the
00:21 - thing I have been invited yes this is
00:24 - true I haven't been invited to attend a
00:27 - zero gravity flight where I will
00:29 - experience the weightlessness of those
00:32 - in space
00:33 - so imagine astronauts that are floating
00:35 - in the International Space Station or
00:37 - anyone else in space so I will be
00:39 - floating around on this flight and even
00:41 - cooler I will be able to play scratch
00:44 - projects yes that is right I will be
00:45 - able to play scratch projects as I float
00:48 - around and we're inviting you to create
00:51 - scratch scratch projects for this
00:53 - special event we have a couple things
00:56 - that we want to share with you one is I
00:59 - will not be able to touch the keyboard
01:01 - when I am on this gyro gravity flight so
01:03 - how could you how could you play with a
01:05 - scratch project well we ask that you use
01:07 - video sensing blocks and if you're not
01:09 - familiar those blocks allow someone
01:11 - using the webcam to interact with
01:13 - scratch projects so here's a scratch
01:15 - project where we're using video sensing
01:17 - blocks to save the Lego minifigs as they
01:20 - fall and don't worry if you haven't used
01:23 - many if you haven't used minifigs if you
01:24 - haven't used video sensing before I've
01:26 - created a tutorial that will explain how
01:29 - you might use those blocks second thing
01:31 - to keep in mind is the plane is kind of
01:34 - small that'll be on so I actually only
01:36 - have about five feet of space from left
01:38 - to right to move around about seven feet
01:41 - to go up and down and I'll be about six
01:44 - to eight feet behind the laptop so not a
01:46 - whole bunch of room to move around and
01:48 - play with these scratch projects but a
01:49 - lot of room to I think experiment with
01:51 - and play with the third thing to keep in
01:54 - mind is I will only experience
01:56 - weightlessness in sort of twenty to
01:58 - thirty second chunks of time so when you
02:01 - create a project think about a game or
02:03 - an animation that takes roughly twenty
02:05 - to thirty seconds and so that's the gist
02:08 - of this initiative we are super super
02:10 - super excited to see what you create
02:13 - and if you have any questions check out
02:15 - the studio description or feel free to
02:17 - ask fellow people who are submitting
02:19 - projects to this initiative and we
02:20 - cannot wait to see what you create
02:22 - sketch on
02:23 - [Music]
