With timestamps:

00:00 - oh yeah oh we like I realize well I
00:05 - realize every why hi everyone this is
00:08 - working yeah this is good do you wanna
00:13 - introduce yourself and yeah hi everybody
00:15 - I'm Zoe
00:17 - from the scratch team I helped make
00:19 - learning resources here my name is Eric
00:22 - also known as people visually on scratch
00:24 - and I also help with learning resources
00:26 - and happy to use webinar we're gonna
00:29 - talk about power of code so welcome to
00:31 - educators who are about to be doing an
00:32 - hour of code coming up here to two weeks
00:35 - yeah no we we it's a week away yes so
00:39 - what what can the educators today look
00:42 - for it we are gonna start by sort of
00:46 - talking a bit about the three new
00:48 - tutorials we have for an hour of code
00:50 - this year on scratch and then we are
00:52 - going to open it up to you all for
00:54 - questions yeah and sort of share about
00:55 - what people are doing for their hour of
00:56 - codes as well yeah I do they share it so
00:58 - you might notice the fancy graphic at
01:00 - the bottom alright so a really important
01:02 - link is this link right here so
01:04 - throughout the webinar there's gonna be
01:06 - a bunch of important links that you
01:08 - might want to bookmark or save for later
01:09 - also you can kind of follow along
01:11 - because that it's a kind of an outline
01:13 - of what it is we'll talk about today in
01:15 - the webinar so it's bitly slash scratch
01:18 - - hoc - web so for all the educators
01:22 - this is kind of like your go to the holy
01:25 - grail of Google box for you so check
01:28 - that out follow along as we talk about
01:30 - all the things as we say a link you
01:32 - don't have to remember it there and then
01:34 - so hi everyone in the chat we invite you
01:38 - to ask hour of code questions and yeah
01:43 - just write well will probably answer
01:44 - most of the question is active like the
01:46 - latter half of the hour super excited to
01:48 - see people from Egypt Brazil yeah just
01:51 - all over yeah welcome everybody cool so
01:54 - let's let's dig in so we have a graphic
01:57 - here oh yeah the old fashioned kind
01:59 - what is our codes how our code started I
02:03 - think in 20 2013 through initiative
02:06 - code.org and the idea was to sort of
02:08 - introduce kids to sort of an
02:11 - introductory one-hour session
02:13 - with coding and obviously over the years
02:16 - it's gotten bigger and bigger and so now
02:18 - you can kind of host an hour of code a
02:20 - bed using code that org or using scratch
02:23 - or using a variety of other programming
02:25 - languages and we today are going to
02:28 - share with you some of the new
02:30 - activities we have for a scratch yeah
02:32 - so uh I think we want to talk just a
02:35 - little bit about the philosophy and the
02:38 - things we think about when we're making
02:39 - resources yes yeah yeah um you know we
02:42 - we like it we try to make resources that
02:45 - are as generative as possible um so that
02:48 - like things that will spark kids going
02:50 - in as many learners going in as many
02:52 - different directions yeah that's
02:53 - possible um you know it's where people
02:56 - can really add their own ideas maybe we
02:59 - really like making things that are kind
03:01 - of thematic so some kind of a theme but
03:04 - it can be sort of based on interests so
03:06 - maybe if a kid likes storytelling or a
03:08 - learner likes storytelling
03:09 - yeah animations or something yeah so
03:12 - very very generative yeah so really
03:14 - bringing your own ideas and sort of
03:16 - around themes so thematic those stories
03:19 - so and and that's I think important
03:22 - context because per hour of code what
03:25 - you can sort of expect sort of your
03:27 - session to look like is to have a lot of
03:29 - sort of tinkering and exploring with
03:32 - these themes and hopefully at the end of
03:35 - your session your activity that all the
03:38 - projects will look different and you
03:39 - kind of have a sense of sort of again
03:42 - that expression that comes with coding
03:44 - and so I think with these activities
03:47 - you'll find there's a lot of ways in
03:48 - which kids can really make these their
03:50 - own yeah yeah yeah um so I guess what
03:55 - scratch resources can one use for a week
03:59 - there was a graphic for that lesson in
04:00 - Africa well there's one more thing we
04:03 - wanted to talk to about the philosophy
04:04 - and read and resources well today when
04:08 - we're sharing you sharing with you these
04:10 - activities they're also sort of in this
04:13 - structure that we'll talk more about it
04:14 - which is the imagine create share
04:16 - structure I could imagine create share
04:19 - which is at the beginning spending some
04:21 - time to imagine brainstorm around the
04:23 - theme and then you create so it's been
04:26 - some of the vocals I'm creating
04:27 - and sharing at the end and so as as we
04:29 - present these resources be thinking of
04:32 - that in your mind so without further ado
04:34 - drumroll do-do-do-do what scratch
04:37 - resources do we have for our codes
04:40 - that's a good question so we have three
04:43 - new resources and maybe I can actually
04:45 - if you go to the homepage of scratch as
04:48 - of today so watch this fancy draft
04:50 - because if I examine so as of today when
04:54 - you visit the scratch website and you're
04:56 - not logged in you can see the three new
04:58 - our code activities we have so we
05:01 - promise though and I promise in the next
05:03 - hour to go through each of these
05:05 - activities so we thought it would be
05:07 - nice to first we want to just kind of
05:10 - dive into one of these activities to
05:13 - show you how it is you might run it in
05:15 - your classroom yeah okay so should we go
05:18 - to the scratch editor yeah let's just do
05:20 - it
05:20 - we're also mindful that there may be our
05:22 - people here who haven't used scratch too
05:25 - much so I think we want to just start
05:26 - out by saying we want to make sure this
05:29 - explanation is kind of giving you that
05:31 - if you've never touched the website
05:33 - before so if you've never touch scratch
05:35 - before if you go and click the Create
05:37 - button that'll take you into the scratch
05:38 - editor that you make a new project but
05:41 - you make a new project and then you'll
05:43 - see front-and-center here this is the
05:45 - tutorials window so right now when
05:48 - you're not logged in you'll see a
05:49 - getting started video and a getting
05:50 - started tutorial this is great just to
05:53 - sort of get your feet wet
05:54 - so let's actually minimize that for now
05:57 - and then in the top laughs we hit plus a
06:00 - few times so you'll see a tutorials
06:06 - button so Zoey and I are going to click
06:09 - that and then you will see this is a
06:13 - list of all the activities that you have
06:15 - our tutorials library yes okay so let's
06:18 - click yeah no more Arnold okay and yeah
06:23 - well you hit the plus down at the bottom
06:26 - gets me to meet the code that we good so
06:29 - later on you'll see while we're clicking
06:30 - that last button
06:31 - but let's talk a bit about this let's
06:33 - talk about what it is we're looking at
06:34 - right now yeah so right here are our
06:37 - tutorials we'll start with a video
06:39 - that's sort of
06:40 - therefore like letting people like
06:42 - imagine sort of generate ideas so this
06:45 - one the the theme of this tutorial is
06:47 - imagine a world and magining a world
06:50 - where anything is possible so the video
06:52 - sort of gives some wacky scenarios and
06:55 - and cool different peptides ideas of
06:58 - worlds you could imagine and and just to
07:01 - sort of give learners ideas and then if
07:04 - you click the green arrow that's to the
07:07 - right of the video just right there yeah
07:10 - then it's the videos followed by a bunch
07:12 - of images that sort of step by step have
07:16 - a simple blocks of scratch code you can
07:20 - put together to get your project going
07:22 - on that beam yeah and so I think we're
07:25 - talking about the imagined section so
07:26 - the first half to imagine I think that
07:28 - video that you saw gives you like a good
07:30 - sense is very inspirational and what it
07:32 - is you can try it you can have a globe
07:33 - that flies a zebra that's playing the
07:36 - saxophone whatever it is you want and
07:38 - then yeah then to sort of get into the
07:40 - coding here with the different steps
07:42 - should we kind of just create just
07:44 - somebody follow this so just to give you
07:49 - a sense of who I'm gonna try to zoom out
07:50 - and make sure this works nice so for
07:54 - instance we when we're developing a
07:56 - tutorial want to make sure that we have
07:58 - like a really low floor easy tour to get
08:00 - started so what you have here in the
08:02 - first couple of steps of this tutorial
08:04 - is essentially just pulling out a very
08:06 - simple of that block really fundamental
08:08 - to scratch is the wind green flag is
08:10 - clicked that's something that you think
08:11 - you really want learners that your
08:12 - students to kind of understand it like
08:13 - this is a triggering event here yeah and
08:16 - then something that's super super
08:17 - generative like what is more generative
08:19 - than say blocks yeah all right so you
08:21 - can add whatever you want and that's
08:23 - another thing too with these tutorials
08:25 - is sort of self-directed and like there
08:28 - should be invitations for you to sort of
08:30 - add whatever it is you want and so
08:32 - you'll see that here with the the next
08:35 - step which is choose any backdrop so
08:38 - automatically with choosing a backdrop
08:40 - you have you have a huge variety so
08:42 - you're already sort of introducing that
08:44 - sort of customization and so maybe a big
08:47 - clinical city yeah I think we put that
08:48 - step so early in this tutorial because
08:50 - we wanted to like
08:53 - let people really imagine their world
08:56 - right away like what are these backdrops
08:57 - feels like a world so so we are so so we
09:00 - just picked that the kind of colorful
09:01 - city Zoe what what what's right should
09:04 - we choose oh man let's go into there I
09:06 - know bananas are pretty great alright so
09:12 - and this kind of gets that it's like
09:14 - yeah it can be wacky it can't be fun and
09:17 - so we can kind of we can now kind of go
09:19 - through the rest of the tutorial and we
09:22 - can see here there's gonna be a number
09:24 - of different sort of code block stacks
09:28 - that kind of give you really powerful
09:30 - simple concept so for this one this is
09:32 - using a key to trigger the changing of a
09:36 - book position
09:37 - super easy stack you'll see choosing
09:40 - another spray move right and left with
09:42 - arrow keys I mean this is maybe like
09:44 - this is one of the most popular things
09:46 - in spice what about most viewed
09:47 - tutorials yeah so go behind the curtain
09:49 - a little bit like exactly yeah so like
09:51 - already it's like well imagine a world
09:54 - where let's imagine a world where
09:55 - bananas can move back and forth let's do
09:58 - that really quick so again I would like
10:01 - to be in that world yeah so we can have
10:03 - it move to the right let's go ahead and
10:05 - duplicate the stack goal at minus sign
10:12 - so there you have we already have the
10:14 - walking banana banana in the street and
10:17 - so the idea is as as you progress
10:20 - through this tutorial you're you're
10:22 - introduced to I think like the most
10:24 - basic but most powerful concepts in
10:27 - scratch or some of those powerful
10:28 - concepts in scratch and so I I cannot
10:31 - say enough about how this tutorial i
10:33 - think is great for folks that are just
10:35 - getting started and if you're thinking
10:37 - about what they introduce i think this
10:39 - has this has a lot yeah and i think this
10:41 - one we really tried to design this one
10:43 - to be but beginner friendly and really
10:46 - like yeah as like blocks that are pretty
10:49 - easy to snap together and they go wrong
10:51 - yeah i mean this is one of my new
10:53 - favorite tutorials that we have and I'm
10:55 - not just saying I mean it's great
10:57 - alright so let's come back and and what
11:00 - else do we want to talk about this Oh
11:01 - doesn't matter well I think we could
11:03 - also talk a bit about this tutorial
11:06 - because is wonderful as bananas walking
11:09 - through the streets are you also could
11:10 - think about sort of blending this into
11:12 - maybe a lesson that you're doing maybe
11:14 - about like social justice or climate
11:16 - change or something that meaningful yeah
11:19 - you take the idea imagine a world it
11:21 - could be just openly imagine whatever
11:24 - world whatever whatever wacky things you
11:25 - want could also do imagine a world where
11:27 - people weren't hungry or you know yeah
11:30 - and again this is like a great jumping
11:32 - off plane you know even if they veered
11:35 - off the tutorial after 10 minutes you'd
11:37 - still have like those basic fundamental
11:39 - building blocks to scratch and so I
11:42 - really love imagine a world and I can't
11:44 - wait to see it's relatively new yeah
11:46 - so we can't talk about imagined world
11:49 - the whole time yeah we're gonna do that
11:51 - and then that's our little deep dive
11:53 - into that one I think we won't yeah go
11:56 - as deep into the other two but uh we
11:58 - will still without further ado next up
12:01 - what's that
12:02 - it's cartoon so I'd recognize this
12:06 - character I think Oh could that be from
12:08 - Cartoon Network's craigger the crease
12:10 - yes so this one just dominant it's
12:12 - Jessica Cartoon Network fans or just
12:15 - fans oh yeah awesome thing yeah we
12:18 - collaborated with Cartoon Network to run
12:20 - this neck tutorial which is how would
12:21 - you describe it it is also designed to
12:24 - be pretty beginner friendly with like
12:26 - blocks that lets start a new project
12:30 - with blocks that you know you can
12:32 - combine together a lot of you know a lot
12:35 - of like come you know easy too easy to
12:37 - put together blocks but that's sort of
12:39 - the theme of this one actually get in
12:46 - yeah and but with the theme of this one
12:51 - being sort of animating a cartoon
12:53 - character yeah and so the video for this
12:57 - one also gives a little like and you
12:59 - probably yeah also something important
13:01 - so when we when you when you select code
13:04 - a cartoon yeah it brings up a new tab oh
13:07 - yeah that's not important to note yeah
13:08 - so let's to run that again let's run
13:10 - that again so if you're in a blank
13:12 - project and you selected coded cartoon
13:14 - you'll notice it creates a new tab and
13:17 - then in that tab it okay
13:19 - to start a project that has these
13:20 - characters this one we wanted like crank
13:22 - of the Creek characters there for you
13:24 - already the Cody if you want yeah okay
13:27 - yeah um so yes it gets a little bit of
13:29 - inspiration with the different types of
13:31 - ways you could animate a character um
13:33 - and annually could be one of these Craig
13:35 - of the Creek characters could also just
13:36 - be a character from scratch or when they
13:38 - drop and you know it walks through the
13:41 - first first few things you can do and
13:43 - then after the video and it's got lots
13:47 - of sort of code stacks that yeah that
13:50 - you can build to animate the different
13:53 - characters got them growing and
13:54 - shrinking and I think one of them jumps
13:57 - and yeah it's great it's kind of like
14:00 - bringing your cast of characters to life
14:02 - kind of giving them superpowers giving
14:04 - them personalities making them do things
14:07 - it's it's really great for it kind of
14:10 - like the the wind sprite click kind of
14:11 - interactions again yeah a whole bunch of
14:14 - characters and you click on them and
14:15 - they do different things yeah a lot of a
14:17 - lot of pretty simple a lot of again very
14:20 - like kind of simple but powerful scripts
14:22 - I'm also really excited about this one
14:25 - also one thing to note which is
14:28 - important at the end it's kind of like
14:30 - this invitation to sort of add your own
14:32 - characters to sort of make sure that
14:35 - it's not just Cartoon Network like
14:36 - that's not bringing in you saw your own
14:38 - drawings or whatever characters you
14:41 - think should be air magic yeah so that
14:44 - one I would say that that one and
14:45 - imagined world are both I that's also a
14:49 - bit I'm pretty yeah it's designed to be
14:51 - pretty beginner-friendly yeah yeah I
14:54 - think so again yeah a lot of those short
14:55 - but powerful scripts so let's talk about
14:57 - last but certainly not least talking
15:00 - tales okay so talking tales it's a cool
15:03 - title oh yeah
15:05 - so tell me more about talking tales so
15:07 - talking tales uh is a little bit more
15:10 - probably for perhaps a better level for
15:13 - someone who's a bit more comfortable
15:14 - with stretch um or maybe has done a few
15:17 - tutorials already it uses um the
15:21 - text-to-speech exact you we have to
15:24 - scratch which lets you is down our
15:27 - extensions button in the bottom left
15:29 - corner of the editor
15:31 - so yes so maybe before we jump into sort
15:34 - of looking at the tutorial it's
15:35 - important to note yeah this is using an
15:37 - extension and for folks that aren't
15:39 - familiar with extensions extensions
15:41 - allow you to connect to software
15:43 - extensions yeah by translation yep stuff
15:48 - where you don't need to have any
15:49 - additional equipment for it to work you
15:51 - have the computer that you have been
15:53 - excreme' also hardware and extensions
15:55 - yes so like some micro bits and things
15:57 - like that so if you wanted to add an
15:59 - extension what you do is you go to the
16:01 - lower left here that little square but
16:04 - yeah zoom in you okay and you'll see the
16:06 - the list of extensions here this one's
16:09 - gonna use text-to-speech and see that
16:13 - adds some new blocks zoom in can we zoom
16:16 - in on the blocks oh come on computer
16:19 - well I'll pull in a boxes yeah there you
16:21 - go speak hello
16:24 - we're not saying we're not fancy enough
16:25 - to have this work would we click it here
16:28 - so it'll say hello if you were in this
16:30 - room with that would you work here it's
16:33 - like a robot voice hello mmm yes hello
16:37 - yes that's the idea and then you can set
16:41 - the tone of the voice altos a bit higher
16:44 - [Music]
16:46 - squeak is really really high giant a bit
16:49 - lower so anyways yeah so that's the kind
16:52 - of the basic sort of scratch extensions
16:56 - text-to-speech yeah okay yes sites and
16:59 - and so this tutorial is sort of about
17:03 - using those text-to-speech blocks where
17:06 - you can make characters talk aloud to
17:09 - take your characters on an adventure and
17:12 - you sort of go to different backdrops
17:13 - and they say different things in the
17:15 - different places yeah and so it's it's
17:18 - using text-to-speech and I think a
17:21 - really unique way which is and also
17:24 - event block so as though we mentioned a
17:27 - lot of the scripts are triggered when
17:29 - you click a sprite and move to the next
17:31 - backdrop so you've got this we have this
17:34 - when backdrop switches to black in
17:36 - scratch yeah
17:37 - so it uses a lot of like when backdrop
17:40 - switches to underwater that as an
17:42 - example the dinosaur could like
17:44 - around as if it's swimming yeah and so
17:46 - if we go back to the video actually
17:47 - there's there's a beautiful example of
17:49 - this so we're watching it in the video
17:50 - here the first thing is we're in the
17:52 - city and then the ghost is clicked very
17:55 - sorry
17:55 - she's click and then it goes to space
17:57 - and so that's what you're doing you're
17:59 - kind of stepping through these different
18:00 - scenes with your two characters or more
18:02 - than one can take more than two
18:03 - characters and that's triggering these
18:06 - things that are said and done I think
18:07 - that's what sort of I was making us
18:09 - think of this is something for people
18:11 - who are a little bit more comfortable
18:12 - with scratch is that sort of it's
18:13 - getting into okay I want to have this
18:16 - these backdrops and have these things
18:19 - happen sort of the event triggering yeah
18:21 - so we like when when the backdrop is
18:23 - switched to Jurassic which is this
18:25 - backdrop the dinosaur says there's no
18:28 - place like home when it's switched to
18:32 - spotlight you see the dinosaur will say
18:35 - check out these moves and then dance so
18:37 - that day was so cute yeah there's really
18:40 - I personally I'm obviously a bit more
18:42 - familiar with scratch and I found I
18:45 - found this to be like so generative and
18:48 - fun because it's kind of like you never
18:50 - know what's gonna happen next and you
18:52 - can trade many stories like mini dancing
18:55 - with a dinosaur I mean II like shopping
18:56 - spree with a dinosaur I don't know and
18:59 - it really just it's fun to like share
19:01 - out - it's really looking to have your
19:04 - friends the projects we were making is
19:06 - we were like designing it and making the
19:07 - samples we're just like laughing and to
19:10 - be honest like wind background switches
19:12 - when backdrops switches it has like a
19:14 - half of that block is like underused
19:16 - it's like really a super light awesome
19:19 - way to a project okay so please do send
19:27 - us your questions at our code questions
19:30 - yeah so we've talked again about the
19:33 - three new activities which you can
19:36 - access on the home page of scratch is
19:39 - that all that can be done for hour of
19:43 - code
19:43 - why no it's not there are also more
19:48 - scratch resource wait there's more do we
19:50 - have a scientist oh you bet we do so of
19:54 - course we've created three new
19:55 - activities for hour of code and if you
19:57 - go on the our code
19:58 - so I quote that org or hour of code calm
20:01 - I didn't have it I don't know the
20:03 - exactly you know what I bet does Google
20:04 - document the document yes the Bentley
20:06 - document yeah has it in there yeah
20:11 - we create you'll find these three
20:12 - activities and some ones from previous
20:14 - years however big however however you
20:17 - should do whatever you want and we have
20:18 - the plenty of other activities that
20:20 - would be perfectly suited for your hour
20:23 - of code experience yeah so you take a
20:25 - little trip to ideas page the ideas page
20:28 - so let's go back we'll get to
20:30 - Fantagraphics so one of the the most
20:35 - powerful buttons on the scratch website
20:37 - is the ideas button here and then a half
20:40 - fire so we'll go to the ideas page and
20:43 - if we scroll down the ideas page we'll
20:47 - see a little mosaic here of a number of
20:49 - different activities this one makes
20:50 - familiar yeah but we have on this page
20:54 - nine different activities to choose from
20:57 - I would say Anna made a name make a
21:01 - chase game and imagine a world these are
21:03 - like especially good for beginners I
21:06 - think we roughly have the sort of the
21:09 - the top row is especially good for
21:10 - beginners kind of yeah basically yeah so
21:15 - there's more than meets the eye though
21:17 - so especially especially for folks that
21:20 - are looking for some more support
21:22 - materials for running an activity with
21:24 - scratch if you click an activity so for
21:27 - instance will click will click animate a
21:29 - name it's gonna pop up this modal I'll
21:32 - zoom in in in this you'll see a number
21:35 - of resources you'll three three
21:36 - different resources this blue button is
21:39 - gonna take you to the editor and it's
21:41 - gonna open the tutorial and that's kind
21:43 - of exactly what we were doing the first
21:45 - three examples yeah so that's the in
21:47 - editor tutorial the coding cards oh my
21:50 - god so the coding card she won't explain
21:52 - these yeah I love the coding card so
21:54 - much the coding cards are uh they're
21:57 - they're sort of like a print version of
21:59 - what the tutorial is um where they have
22:02 - lots of sort of code blocks steps yet
22:06 - you can go through um and it's so you
22:09 - know it'll on the front
22:10 - each card it'll sort of sort of at least
22:12 - roll up just a tiny bit okay yeah that a
22:15 - so it'll show you the like is is called
22:17 - color clicker until you click a letter
22:19 - to make it change color and then on the
22:21 - back of that card if you just scroll
22:24 - down yeah it shows you the code to do it
22:26 - which is just changing the color effect
22:28 - so so anyway they've got lots of
22:31 - activities almost of different themes
22:33 - creating a story making a virtual pet
22:35 - making a pong game yeah it's great to
22:39 - have these available they're a bit like
22:41 - more verbose there's like some more
22:43 - explanatory things I'm like where things
22:45 - are
22:46 - sorry Association I would highly
22:49 - recommend printouts and copies I love
22:52 - sometimes nice to like have a physical
22:54 - to be going by yeah yeah okay so that
22:58 - was one really awesome one of the links
23:00 - that we have let's go back okay so he
23:04 - also has here's this other one it's
23:06 - called an educator guide and the
23:07 - educator guide is going to help support
23:10 - you in running the in this case a
23:13 - one-hour workshop yeah of course it's
23:15 - not at all prescriptive that says it has
23:17 - to be one hour I think this is just a
23:20 - framework that helps support you and
23:21 - thinking about how it is you might chunk
23:23 - however much time you have and so right
23:27 - up top we kind of give the suggestion
23:29 - again we talked about this earlier the
23:31 - imagine creates share sort of framework
23:34 - which is spend the first 10 minutes or
23:37 - what I think would be like maybe 10% of
23:39 - the time gathering to come up with ideas
23:43 - around the theme and then spend the bulk
23:48 - of the time creating and then you spend
23:51 - time at the end really important sharing
23:53 - and reflected yeah and so even if you
23:55 - just even if this was just the extent of
23:57 - a guide I think that's a good reminder
23:59 - but there's more which is this is sort
24:04 - of a guide that helps support you in
24:06 - each of those steps so you have how to
24:09 - prepare and then this is the imagine
24:11 - section so for instance in the imagine
24:14 - section you might have a warm act
24:17 - activity where everyone says their name
24:19 - and then everyone in the group packs out
24:21 - the shape of the first letter of their
24:23 - name you might also show the video which
24:27 - shows some really kind of inspiring
24:29 - examples or creating there's some great
24:34 - facilitation tips here and for sharing
24:37 - there's great tips on sharing like
24:40 - questions you might ask like what was
24:43 - the hardest part if you had more time
24:45 - what would you add change and so this is
24:48 - this is like a really really great
24:49 - resource to have to look at through
24:51 - yourself and again try to make it fit
24:55 - for however much time you have but I
24:57 - really do think the imagine create share
24:59 - is there's a framework that's really
25:01 - worth sort of investigating and I think
25:02 - you do get like really great results
25:03 - from that yeah yeah so so if we zoom
25:08 - back out and we look at this again so
25:10 - there's nine there's right now nine
25:12 - activities that have like this complete
25:14 - set of educator guide cards
25:17 - it's toriel and so imagine the world is
25:20 - the only one of the three this year that
25:22 - has that complete set but again think
25:25 - about how it is you can come up with
25:27 - your own icebreaker and I think the
25:29 - share section you can look at any
25:31 - educator guide and match that to
25:32 - whatever it is you're going totally and
25:34 - it's so inspiring to see how educators
25:36 - will remix these things and change them
25:38 - and yeah and make them fit their own
25:40 - contacts yeah yeah oh and talk about the
25:44 - logistics sure that's probably important
25:46 - right there's logistics oh so so much
25:49 - just to think about is like well not
25:52 - just like like should students have
25:56 - accounts why would a student want an
25:58 - account on to ash if you want to work
26:01 - online and save the work online they'll
26:03 - need help don't need to have accounts
26:05 - that that is an important thing and and
26:08 - and I think related to that is you
26:11 - probably want an easy way to generate
26:13 - these accounts and so what I what we
26:16 - suggest doing and there's a link in this
26:18 - guy for educator accounts so we can
26:21 - probably just actually walk you we can
26:23 - show you where it is you get those yeah
26:24 - so an educator account is gonna let you
26:27 - easily create a
26:29 - of scratch accounts associated with your
26:32 - account I know there is so much good
26:34 - stuff in the scratch footer so right yes
26:36 - is for educators down there in the
26:40 - footer a lot of good stuff yep so we'll
26:43 - click that yeah it does feel sad to like
26:46 - blow through all this content but but
26:51 - this one's problem so you can request a
26:54 - teacher account and 24 or 48 hours we'll
26:57 - approve it and there's a great FAQ
27:01 - here if we really have questions it
27:02 - helps walk you through the features of a
27:05 - educator account and I think probably
27:07 - like maybe most importantly to share it
27:09 - today is that you can upload a CSV that
27:12 - has usernames and passwords for your for
27:16 - your class you can also quickly manually
27:19 - create accounts it's like I think it's
27:21 - there nice nice to have it also allows
27:23 - you to more like easily share to Studios
27:25 - plate again check out the fat yeah
27:26 - definitely suggest doing that so there's
27:29 - also another link in the footer let's
27:32 - talk about this let's come back to us so
27:35 - we just talked about being online
27:37 - we understand sometimes the internet
27:41 - goes that there's a giant snow so we're
27:43 - having like yeah your net the internet
27:45 - can drop out of here in any moment
27:47 - there's a huge session about yet so just
27:49 - in case as a contingency plan it might
27:51 - be nice to have the offline editor also
27:53 - some schools would prefer to be offline
27:56 - yeah and so we got you covered
27:58 - let's let's let's show you how we have
28:00 - you covered so we will go back to our
28:02 - browser where can they find so right
28:07 - down here under support you've got this
28:11 - download button download ok and here you
28:15 - can select your OS we have just within
28:19 - the last month a released scratch for a
28:22 - Chrome OS for an Android so scratch
28:25 - works on Chrome but Chromebooks now as
28:27 - its own app which means you can connect
28:29 - to extensions yeah super exciting anyway
28:32 - YUM yes you select your your OS and then
28:35 - it's got all the stuff you need for down
28:40 - for downloading scratch offline yeah and
28:42 - again that's like probably snap that's
28:46 - like an app and you can connect to
28:48 - extensions yeah super cool this was also
28:51 - scratch 3 is like a kind of a single
28:54 - download thing you need to download
28:55 - Adobe AIR and you like that it's super
28:57 - simple couldn't hurt to have it on a
28:59 - flash drive just in case or installed on
29:01 - Chromebooks or your students laptops
29:03 - yeah so you got coverage they're also
29:05 - important the tutorials are also on yes
29:08 - the tutorials are on the offline editor
29:10 - so you don't have to worry about them
29:13 - not being accessible yeah I think we
29:22 - ready to open it up for sharing the the
29:27 - chat has been going like crazy right now
29:30 - so we have a number of socialism I think
29:33 - we also have a llk life on kindergarten
29:39 - scratch team or lily here who is
29:41 - off-screen okay who has been has been
29:46 - helping out in the chat we also have
29:48 - rueful Natalie in the other room and Keo
29:50 - the chat so for this this this this
29:54 - half-hour the last half hour this
29:56 - session we want to exclusively focus on
29:58 - what questions you might have about our
30:00 - code and scratch resources and also we
30:04 - want to highlight a few sort of few
30:09 - stories of how other educators do want
30:11 - to be using hour of code this year how
30:14 - their amazing traps our code yeah yeah
30:16 - are there any questions Lily that you
30:18 - think we should we should try to address
30:31 - yeah question
30:32 - really good how would you say that what
30:36 - do you think say to start but also
30:38 - definitely want to open it up to the
30:40 - chat so answer yeah yeah yes
30:42 - that okay so here's what we wanted to do
30:44 - we are not the sage on the stage we
30:46 - don't have all the answers and in fact
30:48 - we would like to hear from the entire
30:51 - chat this
30:52 - be like a hybrid Twitter chat YouTube
30:54 - thing that is a fantastic question so if
30:57 - you also have suggestions we could use
31:00 - the entire brain trust of who is here
31:02 - right now to help support that so the
31:03 - question is how how do you support folks
31:07 - at different challenge levels um as you
31:10 - put your answers in the chat um I think
31:13 - that we try to design our tutorial our
31:17 - tutorials to be easy to do them in kind
31:22 - of mix them up in any order so - and
31:25 - unlike you could take one and then go to
31:27 - two other ones like they're sort of all
31:29 - compatible so you could start with
31:30 - imagine a world and maybe one kid spends
31:33 - the whole time on imagine the world but
31:34 - if you really reinforce to other
31:37 - learners like you could do okay you sort
31:40 - of they say oh I'm done with this one
31:42 - you could say oh well do you want to
31:44 - make it talk and then you can do the
31:47 - talking tails or create animations that
31:49 - talk which also uses the same
31:51 - text-to-speech extension as that so you
31:53 - could sort of like uh because you can
31:55 - then combine whatever you would do in
31:57 - the talking tails one could be combined
31:58 - with an imagining world one so I think
32:00 - that I think that's a strategy that I
32:03 - have when we do workshops is to try to
32:07 - encourage that like the tutorials can
32:09 - kind of be like puzzle pieces that can
32:11 - go in any order yeah the tutorials are
32:13 - good jumping-off points and there's
32:15 - certainly tutorials that have concepts
32:18 - are a bit more challenging yep yep yeah
32:20 - so I would I would say that's that's one
32:22 - way to address it if you have the the
32:26 - means to have a hardware extension like
32:29 - a micro bit or a we do kit
32:33 - I think connecting any of these reefs or
32:36 - any of these activities with a
32:38 - connection to a physical world device is
32:40 - a way to sort of peek a lot of sort of
32:43 - interests and folks that maybe want to
32:44 - kind of get off of the screen a little
32:46 - bit and take their project in a
32:48 - direction of bringing into the physical
32:50 - world I've found a lot of success in
32:51 - that and then I often mention the online
32:56 - community because I think it's a
32:59 - wonderful space filled with a lot of
33:02 - inspirational projects that of course
33:04 - you can see in
33:05 - side and so I would not shy away from
33:10 - inviting folks to sort of check out the
33:13 - online community and think about remix
33:16 - in or building off of another project
33:20 - again and and I if you if you're not
33:23 - familiar with the online community again
33:25 - you can play a project and you can see
33:27 - inside and then if you're logged in you
33:30 - can remix and build on that so I do
33:33 - think there's ways in which you can sort
33:35 - of peek kids interest by showing them
33:37 - inspirational projects in the online
33:38 - community and have them build off of
33:40 - something that is maybe a bit more
33:41 - challenging yeah yeah and focusing the
33:45 - chatter mentioning that like the coding
33:46 - cards have helped with student learners
33:50 - at different levels know that the you
33:54 - know letting them choose their own
33:55 - coding card set to work through it in
33:57 - their own direction one thing also that
34:00 - I should note is it is funny because
34:02 - sometimes that might one way to frame
34:04 - that question is like the complexity of
34:06 - the code becomes maybe like
34:09 - uninteresting whoa like it becomes like
34:11 - too simple okay I'm just like right it's
34:13 - it's like I want I wanna do something
34:15 - more complex and it's like a very code
34:17 - specific very Co specific like want but
34:20 - also like thinking about the audio and
34:23 - the armory there's so many like
34:25 - wonderful artwork tutorials in the
34:28 - online community if you search like
34:29 - vector art tutorials if you search like
34:32 - yeah so so searching for tutorials in
34:36 - the online community whether that's art
34:37 - or like sound is a great thing but also
34:40 - if someone wants to like add gravity or
34:45 - add a high score leaderboard to be
34:48 - honest like if you type in high score
34:51 - tutorial on the scratch website there's
34:54 - going to be hundreds of tutorials that
34:57 - can help so so the search bar is really
34:59 - an important thing yeah to get a good
35:02 - question and like getting that
35:03 - motivation
35:04 - we're like the the there's there's you
35:08 - know making a slideshow project that
35:10 - maybe it's the code is is just switching
35:13 - to the next slide if they're really if
35:14 - you're really motivated to make that
35:15 - slideshow yeah any stage of challenge
35:18 - that was a really good question yeah eh
35:21 - at first time and as well so what
35:24 - question do we have next for us in the
35:26 - chat such a good question will the live
35:44 - chat please please yeah while we
35:46 - ruminate I have won you that one great
35:48 - mic as I see create a story could be a
35:51 - cool one because you could sort of
35:53 - brainstorm a story or brainstorm a story
35:56 - together maybe like before you really
36:00 - with a pencil and paper or just just
36:01 - talking and then with the help of the
36:04 - older kids yeah start making the story
36:06 - it could be yeah there's um there's
36:09 - probably some games too so let me let me
36:12 - jump to let me jump back to our editor
36:14 - here let's make a new project there's a
36:16 - few games where I can see where you
36:18 - might want to make it like a two-player
36:19 - game and that would be fun so like for
36:22 - instance chase game chase game the the
36:26 - idea behind the chase game sorry I'm
36:27 - gonna get like super specific into an
36:29 - example I don't know if this is exactly
36:31 - what you should do but for instance
36:32 - chase game is you have a character that
36:35 - chases an object and you are sort of
36:38 - shown in this tutorial
36:40 - to move a character with right arrow
36:42 - keys and left arrow keys but of course
36:45 - you could add a second character and
36:47 - instead of having the right arrow go
36:49 - right you could have the W key and you
36:51 - can have the Q key go left and so you
36:52 - could have instead of just one character
36:55 - and you're gonna have two people two
36:57 - characters either competitively or
36:59 - collaboratively playing a game like this
37:01 - and it would only kind of just take a
37:03 - little bit of hacking of this idea
37:05 - because again this is kind of a single
37:07 - player one sprite chases that's right
37:10 - but I could totally see kind of some
37:11 - cool stuff of having both kids on the
37:14 - keyboard controlling characters totally
37:16 - that could be cool pong game is totally
37:19 - talking the same thing partly the front
37:22 - page of the coding cards of pong game
37:24 - actually show and even the beginning of
37:26 - the tutorial show just a hint that you
37:28 - could easily make it
37:29 - declare anyway they yeah I've had
37:32 - success with animated name actually cuz
37:34 - it doesn't have to be a name it could be
37:37 - it could be something I shared interest
37:39 - or something or it could be something
37:41 - silly because a very beginner activity
37:44 - at a younger audience yeah but actually
37:46 - no no I think a lot of these work like
37:48 - telling a story it's fun to come up with
37:50 - a story together yeah yeah and I had to
37:54 - talk to a educator um history this year
37:57 - who had an awesome project where third
38:00 - graders and eighth graders would would
38:03 - work on would make a monster creature
38:06 - together but the third graders would
38:08 - decide what the head would be in the
38:10 - body and the arms and then the eighth
38:12 - graders would Cody and scratch and bring
38:14 - back to the third graders like the
38:15 - Ephesian so there's also stuff yeah
38:18 - that's a good question thanks yeah thank
38:19 - you so much we don't have any robots
38:39 - back to Jesus so I you know the there's
38:48 - there's the you don't have a robotics
38:52 - webinar or like robotics like Lego
38:54 - robotics or anything on hoc activities
38:56 - this year we do though on the on the
39:00 - extension pages for us Lego so our our
39:06 - extensions we have like scratchy or
39:08 - scratch for instance not dry like you
39:11 - gotyou slash we do oh it's
39:17 - scratch.mit.edu slash in this case we do
39:20 - yeah and so here it's got um a little
39:24 - video that actually we made yeah that um
39:28 - it shows a bunch of like sort of
39:31 - projects you can do what we do and then
39:33 - it shows the basics that face might be
39:35 - familiar uh shows um some starter
39:38 - projects to get started in the stuff so
39:40 - not hoc it's specific for
39:42 - here but there is stuff and the same
39:45 - thing if you instead it in the URL bar
39:47 - in it instead of we do you did Eevee
39:48 - three um or boost I'm pretty sure they
39:52 - have the same one yeah and so again this
39:58 - is like the inspiration you can see here
39:59 - so these starter projects we have a set
40:04 - of three and each of the starter
40:07 - projects will kind of highlight one kind
40:09 - of feature of the robotics kid or
40:12 - whatever hardware device so like play
40:15 - the play basketball you're using the
40:17 - distance sensor for music you're using
40:21 - the buttons on the ev3 and for space
40:23 - tacos tilting you're using or like
40:26 - turning the motor direction yeah to like
40:29 - guide your thing and so it kind of like
40:30 - I get introduces in a very fun
40:32 - generative way different parts so yeah
40:38 - the landing page it's like /eb three and
40:40 - / redo I do wish and I'm not sure this
40:43 - is the case there's an easier way to get
40:45 - to the landing it's a shame that right
40:48 - now it's sorta you have to just know
40:49 - they're there they there they're either
40:51 - link to them from the extensions library
40:53 - if you back at this button this square
40:54 - button in the bottom left any hardware
40:56 - extension if you click on it to add it
40:59 - this is Lego boost how you can it help
41:01 - but gosh that would be it would be great
41:06 - yeah that's a good question
41:08 - um yeah and then I think in terms of
41:11 - more webinars this is the only hoc yeah
41:14 - are people like in it I mean we should
41:16 - probably do more webinars it's fine yeah
41:19 - so I don't know it's probably not
41:22 - between now and yeah it would now now
41:25 - but this will also be available as a
41:27 - video on demand later at this same link
41:29 - yeah um and and we want to do more
41:33 - webinars in the future yeah
41:40 - but in the meantime I want you to play
41:42 - we can talk about languages and scratch
41:44 - this comes up a lot yeah yeah yeah so
41:48 - actually I think not everyone may know
41:51 - this uh but you can change the light
41:55 - scratches translated into over 60
41:56 - languages and if you click on that globe
41:59 - icon up in the top yes right there um
42:02 - then and then the menu small but you can
42:07 - change the language and then all of the
42:09 - blocks will change the yeah which is
42:13 - pretty great uh the tutorials the videos
42:16 - have captions which are translated into
42:19 - a lot of languages and I think that most
42:22 - of the tutorials have translated into at
42:24 - least thirty languages and then and then
42:27 - up for a you know after the videos there
42:31 - are those images those images that have
42:33 - that different like sort of steps um and
42:37 - in the all of our all of those things
42:42 - having oh that all of our tutorials are
42:44 - in Spanish and so for this hour of code
42:47 - all of our our code activities are
42:48 - available are fully available in Spanish
42:50 - English in Spanish but and more
42:53 - languages coming to come in tutorial
42:57 - translations yeah I think that's kind of
42:59 - fun so Zoey and I and others on the
43:01 - resources team we're trying to think
43:02 - through exactly like how it is we can
43:05 - easily create localized look like
43:08 - translated versions of all of our
43:11 - resources and it's like a
43:12 - labor-intensive manual process yeah
43:15 - currently though we have a wonderful
43:17 - shout out huge shot up to the
43:19 - translators who are translating scratch
43:21 - so many different languages
43:23 - it would not be those languages they use
43:25 - size 60 because people have love scratch
43:28 - and want to come back really hard and
43:32 - like every time we make a piece of text
43:35 - on the website and then change the
43:36 - wording slightly they go in and I think
43:38 - the work is
43:49 - it's a good question I would wreck this
43:56 - isn't like oh my gosh there's not
43:57 - options it's just I would like to phone
44:00 - a friend in the chat I don't we have
44:02 - some scratch steamers out here that I'm
44:04 - sure have good ideas as well what comes
44:07 - to mind for you Zoey
44:09 - I think that anime a name you can go you
44:13 - can you can like I think there's that
44:17 - moment where it clicks and you make
44:21 - something do something that was sounded
44:23 - vague but in animate a name it's like
44:25 - you click on a letter and it changes
44:26 - color and I think inanimate name it's so
44:28 - quick it's such a short and and and you
44:32 - could do even like animate a word you
44:33 - could all animate the same word if
44:35 - you've got 30 minutes or you know but
44:39 - but um you know it's like two blocks and
44:43 - and then you've got something happening
44:47 - so I I think that that's that could be
44:51 - an option
44:52 - yeah I I've done workshops that are 30
44:57 - minutes my introduction is scratch I
44:58 - don't know if I've ever told you this a
44:59 - week my introduction distract was a like
45:02 - 30 minute workshop and what happened was
45:04 - it was it was a very basic introduction
45:06 - to react like a very getting started
45:08 - like here's scratch
45:09 - we actually I'll throw this out there
45:11 - I'm sorry we haven't mentioned this yet
45:12 - I'm gonna go back we have a brilliant I
45:15 - think getting started video Oh which I
45:18 - shouldn't say that cuz we made it
45:19 - brilliant but absolutely brilliant this
45:22 - arrogance okay
45:25 - yeah the getting started has a one
45:28 - minute video that essentially says like
45:31 - what is scratch
45:33 - how do blocks work how do you run blocks
45:37 - how do you trigger the blocks
45:40 - what are sprites and it's like in one
45:43 - minute you can like automatically feel
45:46 - like a bit more comfortable about like
45:48 - what it is you might be doing so again
45:50 - this is like oh you can connect blocks
45:51 - you can then run them and then
45:54 - introduced this idea of there's events
45:56 - so if you want to start your code you
45:59 - drag out an event block and then you
46:02 - know we say you can also rearrange the
46:04 - blocks you can also then toss out the
46:07 - blocks you can add multiple sprites and
46:09 - code them and so like in a minute in
46:11 - literally a minute you get like a good
46:13 - kind of bearing of like okay what is
46:16 - scratch and so I think I can't emphasize
46:19 - enough just giving it the lay of the
46:20 - land is important also I think
46:23 - explaining to folks that it's totally
46:25 - okay to experiment and scratch is about
46:28 - tinkering yeah and if you want to do a
46:31 - tutorial animated names of crazy
46:34 - Christian in the chat one of our friends
46:37 - who helps us make all awesome resources
46:39 - um working our resources team with us is
46:41 - saying said that um for a 30 minute
46:43 - lesson she'll also do group coding so
46:45 - like yes together yes one project and
46:47 - things another awesome idea yeah that
46:49 - could be yeah that's interesting yeah
46:51 - also group together like that 39
46:54 - introduction what was I was with someone
46:57 - and and it was it had a lot yeah because
47:00 - you're kind of going through it with
47:01 - someone you can bounce ideas off of yeah
47:03 - and I guess thinking about the imagine
47:05 - program share it would still be nice to
47:08 - have like a short imagine section where
47:09 - you show what is possible with scratch
47:12 - yeah and so X on the home page of the
47:15 - scratch website just the home page blog
47:17 - out there's a about scratch video that
47:21 - is like I think I'm minute long which
47:23 - shows you different scratch projects
47:24 - because that's another important thing
47:25 - it's like what the heck is scratch like
47:26 - why would I want to like what is like
47:28 - Cody why am I not inspiration that
47:29 - buy-in yeah like I can make games that
47:32 - can make stories Anika make animations
47:34 - so like hit him hit him with a hole
47:35 - inspiration yeah yeah that's great
47:38 - question yeah and I think like a very
47:42 - good to remember that like the time
47:43 - constraints but I don't know how it goes
47:45 - to if you're honest wit yeah if you're
47:47 - on Twitter you should like totally make
47:48 - sure to tweet that that scratch would be
47:50 - in super inches a see how it goes yeah
47:52 - yeah okay we got 12 minutes I'm sure
47:55 - we've got more questions yeah you're
47:57 - more questions
48:03 - and so wondering both like maybe enemy
48:06 - this isn't the time for the places to go
48:09 - can find out more about scratch yeah um
48:14 - the the there is a scratch FAQ which has
48:19 - answers to some of those there's also on
48:22 - the about scratch page that Eric
48:24 - mentioned I think it has some stats
48:27 - about users and stuff yeah I know so
48:30 - yeah we can answer quickly just some of
48:33 - these yeah so so so specifically there's
48:35 - this statistics page where you can see
48:38 - how many people you could via the footer
48:41 - technical questions if there's a
48:44 - specific question you could always use
48:45 - contact us mmm so you can send a message
48:48 - where is contact us contact us down here
48:52 - in the footer contact us have you ask a
48:54 - question if you really want to like dig
48:57 - into like the code that scratch is built
48:59 - on it's all open source so if you google
49:03 - scratch github I'm sure you can find a
49:06 - repository that will have a bunch of
49:09 - documentation and all the all the stuff
49:11 - that you want guys so I would 528 point
49:15 - you there yeah there's one thing about
49:17 - and generally speaking about scratch is
49:19 - them oh it's all open space yeah - the
49:24 - website I mean a website there's
49:25 - probably things on the website that's
49:26 - clearly yeah and like the scratch 3 was
49:32 - built on like full requests and like
49:34 - code from other not only within the
49:36 - scratch team but like contributors so
49:38 - like yeah yeah you know there's a lot of
49:40 - folks on better scratch users that
49:42 - contribute to be actively
49:44 - yeah I see caffeinated mention with
49:45 - scratch scratch wiki yeah yeah
49:48 - somebody's asking about being able to
49:51 - create code in scratch that the that
50:02 - that would be super super cool and yeah
50:06 - I am going to write that down sweetie
50:08 - well I was also say so um we had a
50:12 - master student here yeah Tina
50:15 - who is looking at coding for the folks
50:18 - that I've like visual impairments and
50:20 - she was digging into like what could a
50:22 - coding platform might be like if you had
50:25 - to use your voice only and so there's
50:29 - actually a scratch would you update if
50:30 - he wants to scratch video updates which
50:32 - is a video blog series that's on YouTube
50:34 - I think the most recent episode Tina
50:36 - co-hosted with me and she actually
50:38 - talked the last three minutes about her
50:40 - work that she was doing around that but
50:42 - we're always thinking about how to sort
50:43 - of make scratch more accessible and I
50:45 - think even in 2020 that's something that
50:46 - like we're really really focused on the
50:49 - s3 is launched we covered them all just
51:01 - kidding how there's so there's so many
51:03 - um so maybe that maybe we can plug the
51:07 - educator page again so let's go back
51:09 - again we will scoot down all this good
51:14 - stuff is who would have thought we spend
51:16 - so much time in the footer but here we
51:17 - are the educators page front and center
51:23 - on the educator page is a wonderful
51:25 - resource called scratch and practice I
51:27 - would describe scratch and practice as
51:31 - well was a monthly every month we'd have
51:33 - a new theme that would help you bring
51:36 - scratch into your practice so the
51:38 - previous themes we had were getting
51:41 - started with scratch connecting to the
51:44 - curriculum peer learning projects with
51:47 - the purpose and then for each of these
51:50 - themes we'd have content that would help
51:52 - you with this so for instance in
51:54 - February we had getting started with
51:55 - scratch we had a workshop so we talked
52:00 - about a workshop that you might want to
52:01 - lead animated character Mitch talked to
52:03 - kind of a high level of sort of how he
52:06 - used sort of the importance of giving
52:08 - kids started with scratch experimenting
52:11 - exploring expressing themselves natalie
52:14 - dove a bit deeper to talk about sort of
52:17 - exploration and an app explanation and
52:19 - then we had educators just like you kind
52:22 - of sharing thoughts on how to get
52:23 - started with scratch and so there's a
52:26 - lot of great themes here to dig into
52:28 - we're not doing a month
52:29 - anymore yeah but there's more important
52:34 - or more cordially I guess you could say
52:36 - yeah so scratch in practice I believe
52:39 - that's also in the handy-dandy link and
52:41 - that you that you see in the title on
52:43 - the webinar so that's one that comes to
52:46 - mind there here we've got alternative
52:48 - links to the educator guides also the
52:50 - creative computing curriculum guide yeah
52:53 - which is awesome yeah this is how you
52:56 - might plan sort of coding activities
53:01 - introduce scratch and like really just
53:03 - amazing ways over and over several weeks
53:06 - it's it's a it's it's free fantastic
53:11 - guide that's also good yeah so and and
53:17 - there's probably other resources that we
53:20 - sorry it's highly suggest checking out
53:23 - the educator page cool all right we got
53:27 - a couple more minutes seven more minutes
53:29 - let's go back so that's a good question
53:38 - so you might see something if you search
53:42 - hour of code on Twitter you'll see hash
53:45 - of our and you see a lot of kids that
53:46 - hold those certificates like I complete
53:47 - an arc and so we don't scratch does not
53:50 - have those certificates so that's the
53:53 - kind of sharing that you can see at the
53:55 - end is hopefully is like a an exhibition
53:57 - of the projects so so we don't have
53:59 - anything no badges or any certificates
54:02 - for completing it but again hopefully
54:04 - you have time to sort of show off again
54:07 - these projects that hopefully are whoa
54:21 - that's a great question yeah I think
54:28 - we're really we really want to think
54:30 - about that and like how we can support
54:33 - deeper learning yeah it's just some
54:35 - stuff we've been talking about and like
54:36 - how how to really like support all these
54:41 - pathways friendly
54:42 - the first getting started tutorial and I
54:45 - think we were thinking a lot about like
54:46 - what shapes they could take how can we
54:47 - involve more like starter projects I
54:49 - think when we ask people about how they
54:51 - got into making bigger bigger projects a
54:54 - lot of people talk about starter
54:55 - projects yep so I think we probably
54:59 - prioritized we prioritize creating a lot
55:03 - of entry-level generative thematic
55:06 - tutorials to start with yeah because
55:08 - there's some carryover from 2.0 it's a
55:10 - 3.0 I keep missing on my handi yeah from
55:13 - 2.0 to 3.0 there's some tutorials that
55:16 - came over then we added a bunch of new
55:17 - tutorials and now that we've built out I
55:19 - think a nice sort of library of
55:21 - tutorials or that's one of the things
55:24 - I'm most excited about in 2020 is
55:25 - thinking about how it is we get into
55:26 - sort of these more advanced stuff it's
55:28 - not completely obvious how did you do
55:31 - that I think there's a lot that we can
55:33 - learn from how it's kind of happening on
55:34 - YouTube I think there's a learn from
55:36 - starter projects from whoever asked that
55:39 - question if you have suggestions like
55:40 - you should totally write to us I almost
55:42 - wanted to say like you could put in the
55:44 - chat like where you'd want an advanced
55:46 - tutorial to live like yeah or do you
55:49 - want to paint like when you want to find
55:51 - in this like in the tutorials library we
55:53 - want it to be a scratch project a
55:55 - scratch studio yeah or like a thing
55:57 - online and like and what kind of stuff
55:59 - you want to be like we will listen to
56:01 - all of that might my suspicion is my
56:05 - intuition says it might not take the
56:07 - same form as the tutorial where you step
56:10 - by step starting from a blank slate yeah
56:12 - it might be more starter project he base
56:15 - where you explain the code in the
56:16 - concepts or it might be wrong form I
56:18 - don't know so it's not that we forgotten
56:21 - that we don't it's nothing thank using
56:23 - up today it's a great question and we
56:25 - want to do more of it yeah something
56:27 - we're really excited about yeah
56:34 - there hasn't been a mighty one but I
56:36 - wonder
56:42 - yeah so scratch days are held all around
56:45 - the world I think especially in May but
56:47 - all year round and also in the footer I
56:50 - think it's also in the footer this is
56:53 - less of an HSE webinar and more but the
56:55 - footer so yeah is we have one at MIT
57:05 - have where like folks can come are all
57:08 - around for like as long as MIT is here
57:12 - scratch they will be here I just like
57:13 - it's like that's that is yeah there's
57:16 - the saying I don't know yeah it's got so
57:19 - it's gonna rise in the morning and
57:20 - scratch they will be at MIT today it's
57:21 - like things that are obviously gonna
57:23 - happen
57:24 - yeah so yes so scratch day at MIT I
57:27 - don't actually know the date for this
57:29 - year
57:30 - tonight May 9th May night May night 2010
57:33 - you you heard of here first
57:34 - that's great that's that's wonderful yes
57:35 - I yeah and if folks are interested in
57:38 - scratch they I figure that's the first
57:39 - time you've heard about this scratch day
57:40 - thing it's as exciting as it sounds its
57:43 - global network where people come
57:44 - together to host to host events to
57:47 - celebrate scratch and the people who
57:48 - scratch it yeah folks will make like
57:50 - scratch projects folks make like cookies
57:52 - with the scratch pad on them folks will
57:53 - make like a scratch projects and new and
57:56 - weird ways and so you can see here
57:58 - there's a lot and not too many these
58:00 - other parallel universes there's
58:08 - thousands and then you can kind of host
58:10 - that explains this this is man resources
58:14 - talking about resource design this is
58:15 - great it's tough you through imagine
58:17 - planning and sort of organizing and
58:19 - inviting it's like everything you need
58:21 - to run a scratch day and poster scratch
58:22 - day yeah two minutes I would point you
58:36 - to that would point you to the downloads
58:39 - page so it's a good question on the
58:42 - download Pam on the scratch day so yeah
58:44 - it takes you away took me away I would
58:49 - point you to the downloads page that
58:52 - should hopefully give
58:53 - you requirements it does give
58:56 - requirements of sort of what sort of
58:59 - operating system you need if if you have
59:02 - a specific question and it's not
59:04 - answered in the FAQ or on this page you
59:07 - can send us a message to contact us but
59:09 - but I think to pop up a level like it's
59:13 - available on Windows Mac and Chrome OS
59:16 - offline so maybe that dish that's
59:20 - covering a lot of bases yeah and the oh
59:23 - one thing to note is with Chrome OS and
59:26 - Android is an Android tablets yeah so I
59:28 - learned this that if it's important
59:30 - distinction so Android could mean phone
59:32 - and tablets phone and tablets but this
59:36 - version of scratch works on android
59:39 - tablet devices not Android phones yeah
59:43 - so are they 30 ready 30 so I I guess we
59:48 - want to thank you all for hanging out
59:50 - contributing to answering the questions
59:52 - thank you so much it's been so fun we've
59:55 - been thinking about this webinar for a
59:57 - long time so we hope you enjoyed it yeah
60:01 - and maybe we should post more of these
60:02 - and we hope you have a wonderful
60:03 - wonderful hour of code and again thank
60:05 - you everyone in the chat who is
60:06 - answering questions and thanks for all
60:08 - the folks out there helping with the
60:10 - chat Thank You Lily the ideas coming of
60:13 - tutorials you'd like to see yeah we want
60:15 - to make uh stuff you you you all have
60:18 - such good ideas you wanna make them cool
60:21 - okay well I guess till next time yes we
60:24 - hope you have a good night and we'll see
60:26 - you later
60:27 - scratch on scratch on bye

Cleaned transcript:

oh yeah oh we like I realize well I realize every why hi everyone this is working yeah this is good do you wanna introduce yourself and yeah hi everybody I'm Zoe from the scratch team I helped make learning resources here my name is Eric also known as people visually on scratch and I also help with learning resources and happy to use webinar we're gonna talk about power of code so welcome to educators who are about to be doing an hour of code coming up here to two weeks yeah no we we it's a week away yes so what what can the educators today look for it we are gonna start by sort of talking a bit about the three new tutorials we have for an hour of code this year on scratch and then we are going to open it up to you all for questions yeah and sort of share about what people are doing for their hour of codes as well yeah I do they share it so you might notice the fancy graphic at the bottom alright so a really important link is this link right here so throughout the webinar there's gonna be a bunch of important links that you might want to bookmark or save for later also you can kind of follow along because that it's a kind of an outline of what it is we'll talk about today in the webinar so it's bitly slash scratch hoc web so for all the educators this is kind of like your go to the holy grail of Google box for you so check that out follow along as we talk about all the things as we say a link you don't have to remember it there and then so hi everyone in the chat we invite you to ask hour of code questions and yeah just write well will probably answer most of the question is active like the latter half of the hour super excited to see people from Egypt Brazil yeah just all over yeah welcome everybody cool so let's let's dig in so we have a graphic here oh yeah the old fashioned kind what is our codes how our code started I think in 20 2013 through initiative code.org and the idea was to sort of introduce kids to sort of an introductory onehour session with coding and obviously over the years it's gotten bigger and bigger and so now you can kind of host an hour of code a bed using code that org or using scratch or using a variety of other programming languages and we today are going to share with you some of the new activities we have for a scratch yeah so uh I think we want to talk just a little bit about the philosophy and the things we think about when we're making resources yes yeah yeah um you know we we like it we try to make resources that are as generative as possible um so that like things that will spark kids going in as many learners going in as many different directions yeah that's possible um you know it's where people can really add their own ideas maybe we really like making things that are kind of thematic so some kind of a theme but it can be sort of based on interests so maybe if a kid likes storytelling or a learner likes storytelling yeah animations or something yeah so very very generative yeah so really bringing your own ideas and sort of around themes so thematic those stories so and and that's I think important context because per hour of code what you can sort of expect sort of your session to look like is to have a lot of sort of tinkering and exploring with these themes and hopefully at the end of your session your activity that all the projects will look different and you kind of have a sense of sort of again that expression that comes with coding and so I think with these activities you'll find there's a lot of ways in which kids can really make these their own yeah yeah yeah um so I guess what scratch resources can one use for a week there was a graphic for that lesson in Africa well there's one more thing we wanted to talk to about the philosophy and read and resources well today when we're sharing you sharing with you these activities they're also sort of in this structure that we'll talk more about it which is the imagine create share structure I could imagine create share which is at the beginning spending some time to imagine brainstorm around the theme and then you create so it's been some of the vocals I'm creating and sharing at the end and so as as we present these resources be thinking of that in your mind so without further ado drumroll dodododo what scratch resources do we have for our codes that's a good question so we have three new resources and maybe I can actually if you go to the homepage of scratch as of today so watch this fancy draft because if I examine so as of today when you visit the scratch website and you're not logged in you can see the three new our code activities we have so we promise though and I promise in the next hour to go through each of these activities so we thought it would be nice to first we want to just kind of dive into one of these activities to show you how it is you might run it in your classroom yeah okay so should we go to the scratch editor yeah let's just do it we're also mindful that there may be our people here who haven't used scratch too much so I think we want to just start out by saying we want to make sure this explanation is kind of giving you that if you've never touched the website before so if you've never touch scratch before if you go and click the Create button that'll take you into the scratch editor that you make a new project but you make a new project and then you'll see frontandcenter here this is the tutorials window so right now when you're not logged in you'll see a getting started video and a getting started tutorial this is great just to sort of get your feet wet so let's actually minimize that for now and then in the top laughs we hit plus a few times so you'll see a tutorials button so Zoey and I are going to click that and then you will see this is a list of all the activities that you have our tutorials library yes okay so let's click yeah no more Arnold okay and yeah well you hit the plus down at the bottom gets me to meet the code that we good so later on you'll see while we're clicking that last button but let's talk a bit about this let's talk about what it is we're looking at right now yeah so right here are our tutorials we'll start with a video that's sort of therefore like letting people like imagine sort of generate ideas so this one the the theme of this tutorial is imagine a world and magining a world where anything is possible so the video sort of gives some wacky scenarios and and cool different peptides ideas of worlds you could imagine and and just to sort of give learners ideas and then if you click the green arrow that's to the right of the video just right there yeah then it's the videos followed by a bunch of images that sort of step by step have a simple blocks of scratch code you can put together to get your project going on that beam yeah and so I think we're talking about the imagined section so the first half to imagine I think that video that you saw gives you like a good sense is very inspirational and what it is you can try it you can have a globe that flies a zebra that's playing the saxophone whatever it is you want and then yeah then to sort of get into the coding here with the different steps should we kind of just create just somebody follow this so just to give you a sense of who I'm gonna try to zoom out and make sure this works nice so for instance we when we're developing a tutorial want to make sure that we have like a really low floor easy tour to get started so what you have here in the first couple of steps of this tutorial is essentially just pulling out a very simple of that block really fundamental to scratch is the wind green flag is clicked that's something that you think you really want learners that your students to kind of understand it like this is a triggering event here yeah and then something that's super super generative like what is more generative than say blocks yeah all right so you can add whatever you want and that's another thing too with these tutorials is sort of selfdirected and like there should be invitations for you to sort of add whatever it is you want and so you'll see that here with the the next step which is choose any backdrop so automatically with choosing a backdrop you have you have a huge variety so you're already sort of introducing that sort of customization and so maybe a big clinical city yeah I think we put that step so early in this tutorial because we wanted to like let people really imagine their world right away like what are these backdrops feels like a world so so we are so so we just picked that the kind of colorful city Zoe what what what's right should we choose oh man let's go into there I know bananas are pretty great alright so and this kind of gets that it's like yeah it can be wacky it can't be fun and so we can kind of we can now kind of go through the rest of the tutorial and we can see here there's gonna be a number of different sort of code block stacks that kind of give you really powerful simple concept so for this one this is using a key to trigger the changing of a book position super easy stack you'll see choosing another spray move right and left with arrow keys I mean this is maybe like this is one of the most popular things in spice what about most viewed tutorials yeah so go behind the curtain a little bit like exactly yeah so like already it's like well imagine a world where let's imagine a world where bananas can move back and forth let's do that really quick so again I would like to be in that world yeah so we can have it move to the right let's go ahead and duplicate the stack goal at minus sign so there you have we already have the walking banana banana in the street and so the idea is as as you progress through this tutorial you're you're introduced to I think like the most basic but most powerful concepts in scratch or some of those powerful concepts in scratch and so I I cannot say enough about how this tutorial i think is great for folks that are just getting started and if you're thinking about what they introduce i think this has this has a lot yeah and i think this one we really tried to design this one to be but beginner friendly and really like yeah as like blocks that are pretty easy to snap together and they go wrong yeah i mean this is one of my new favorite tutorials that we have and I'm not just saying I mean it's great alright so let's come back and and what else do we want to talk about this Oh doesn't matter well I think we could also talk a bit about this tutorial because is wonderful as bananas walking through the streets are you also could think about sort of blending this into maybe a lesson that you're doing maybe about like social justice or climate change or something that meaningful yeah you take the idea imagine a world it could be just openly imagine whatever world whatever whatever wacky things you want could also do imagine a world where people weren't hungry or you know yeah and again this is like a great jumping off plane you know even if they veered off the tutorial after 10 minutes you'd still have like those basic fundamental building blocks to scratch and so I really love imagine a world and I can't wait to see it's relatively new yeah so we can't talk about imagined world the whole time yeah we're gonna do that and then that's our little deep dive into that one I think we won't yeah go as deep into the other two but uh we will still without further ado next up what's that it's cartoon so I'd recognize this character I think Oh could that be from Cartoon Network's craigger the crease yes so this one just dominant it's Jessica Cartoon Network fans or just fans oh yeah awesome thing yeah we collaborated with Cartoon Network to run this neck tutorial which is how would you describe it it is also designed to be pretty beginner friendly with like blocks that lets start a new project with blocks that you know you can combine together a lot of you know a lot of like come you know easy too easy to put together blocks but that's sort of the theme of this one actually get in yeah and but with the theme of this one being sort of animating a cartoon character yeah and so the video for this one also gives a little like and you probably yeah also something important so when we when you when you select code a cartoon yeah it brings up a new tab oh yeah that's not important to note yeah so let's to run that again let's run that again so if you're in a blank project and you selected coded cartoon you'll notice it creates a new tab and then in that tab it okay to start a project that has these characters this one we wanted like crank of the Creek characters there for you already the Cody if you want yeah okay yeah um so yes it gets a little bit of inspiration with the different types of ways you could animate a character um and annually could be one of these Craig of the Creek characters could also just be a character from scratch or when they drop and you know it walks through the first first few things you can do and then after the video and it's got lots of sort of code stacks that yeah that you can build to animate the different characters got them growing and shrinking and I think one of them jumps and yeah it's great it's kind of like bringing your cast of characters to life kind of giving them superpowers giving them personalities making them do things it's it's really great for it kind of like the the wind sprite click kind of interactions again yeah a whole bunch of characters and you click on them and they do different things yeah a lot of a lot of pretty simple a lot of again very like kind of simple but powerful scripts I'm also really excited about this one also one thing to note which is important at the end it's kind of like this invitation to sort of add your own characters to sort of make sure that it's not just Cartoon Network like that's not bringing in you saw your own drawings or whatever characters you think should be air magic yeah so that one I would say that that one and imagined world are both I that's also a bit I'm pretty yeah it's designed to be pretty beginnerfriendly yeah yeah I think so again yeah a lot of those short but powerful scripts so let's talk about last but certainly not least talking tales okay so talking tales it's a cool title oh yeah so tell me more about talking tales so talking tales uh is a little bit more probably for perhaps a better level for someone who's a bit more comfortable with stretch um or maybe has done a few tutorials already it uses um the texttospeech exact you we have to scratch which lets you is down our extensions button in the bottom left corner of the editor so yes so maybe before we jump into sort of looking at the tutorial it's important to note yeah this is using an extension and for folks that aren't familiar with extensions extensions allow you to connect to software extensions yeah by translation yep stuff where you don't need to have any additional equipment for it to work you have the computer that you have been excreme' also hardware and extensions yes so like some micro bits and things like that so if you wanted to add an extension what you do is you go to the lower left here that little square but yeah zoom in you okay and you'll see the the list of extensions here this one's gonna use texttospeech and see that adds some new blocks zoom in can we zoom in on the blocks oh come on computer well I'll pull in a boxes yeah there you go speak hello we're not saying we're not fancy enough to have this work would we click it here so it'll say hello if you were in this room with that would you work here it's like a robot voice hello mmm yes hello yes that's the idea and then you can set the tone of the voice altos a bit higher squeak is really really high giant a bit lower so anyways yeah so that's the kind of the basic sort of scratch extensions texttospeech yeah okay yes sites and and so this tutorial is sort of about using those texttospeech blocks where you can make characters talk aloud to take your characters on an adventure and you sort of go to different backdrops and they say different things in the different places yeah and so it's it's using texttospeech and I think a really unique way which is and also event block so as though we mentioned a lot of the scripts are triggered when you click a sprite and move to the next backdrop so you've got this we have this when backdrop switches to black in scratch yeah so it uses a lot of like when backdrop switches to underwater that as an example the dinosaur could like around as if it's swimming yeah and so if we go back to the video actually there's there's a beautiful example of this so we're watching it in the video here the first thing is we're in the city and then the ghost is clicked very sorry she's click and then it goes to space and so that's what you're doing you're kind of stepping through these different scenes with your two characters or more than one can take more than two characters and that's triggering these things that are said and done I think that's what sort of I was making us think of this is something for people who are a little bit more comfortable with scratch is that sort of it's getting into okay I want to have this these backdrops and have these things happen sort of the event triggering yeah so we like when when the backdrop is switched to Jurassic which is this backdrop the dinosaur says there's no place like home when it's switched to spotlight you see the dinosaur will say check out these moves and then dance so that day was so cute yeah there's really I personally I'm obviously a bit more familiar with scratch and I found I found this to be like so generative and fun because it's kind of like you never know what's gonna happen next and you can trade many stories like mini dancing with a dinosaur I mean II like shopping spree with a dinosaur I don't know and it really just it's fun to like share out it's really looking to have your friends the projects we were making is we were like designing it and making the samples we're just like laughing and to be honest like wind background switches when backdrops switches it has like a half of that block is like underused it's like really a super light awesome way to a project okay so please do send us your questions at our code questions yeah so we've talked again about the three new activities which you can access on the home page of scratch is that all that can be done for hour of code why no it's not there are also more scratch resource wait there's more do we have a scientist oh you bet we do so of course we've created three new activities for hour of code and if you go on the our code so I quote that org or hour of code calm I didn't have it I don't know the exactly you know what I bet does Google document the document yes the Bentley document yeah has it in there yeah we create you'll find these three activities and some ones from previous years however big however however you should do whatever you want and we have the plenty of other activities that would be perfectly suited for your hour of code experience yeah so you take a little trip to ideas page the ideas page so let's go back we'll get to Fantagraphics so one of the the most powerful buttons on the scratch website is the ideas button here and then a half fire so we'll go to the ideas page and if we scroll down the ideas page we'll see a little mosaic here of a number of different activities this one makes familiar yeah but we have on this page nine different activities to choose from I would say Anna made a name make a chase game and imagine a world these are like especially good for beginners I think we roughly have the sort of the the top row is especially good for beginners kind of yeah basically yeah so there's more than meets the eye though so especially especially for folks that are looking for some more support materials for running an activity with scratch if you click an activity so for instance will click will click animate a name it's gonna pop up this modal I'll zoom in in in this you'll see a number of resources you'll three three different resources this blue button is gonna take you to the editor and it's gonna open the tutorial and that's kind of exactly what we were doing the first three examples yeah so that's the in editor tutorial the coding cards oh my god so the coding card she won't explain these yeah I love the coding card so much the coding cards are uh they're they're sort of like a print version of what the tutorial is um where they have lots of sort of code blocks steps yet you can go through um and it's so you know it'll on the front each card it'll sort of sort of at least roll up just a tiny bit okay yeah that a so it'll show you the like is is called color clicker until you click a letter to make it change color and then on the back of that card if you just scroll down yeah it shows you the code to do it which is just changing the color effect so so anyway they've got lots of activities almost of different themes creating a story making a virtual pet making a pong game yeah it's great to have these available they're a bit like more verbose there's like some more explanatory things I'm like where things are sorry Association I would highly recommend printouts and copies I love sometimes nice to like have a physical to be going by yeah yeah okay so that was one really awesome one of the links that we have let's go back okay so he also has here's this other one it's called an educator guide and the educator guide is going to help support you in running the in this case a onehour workshop yeah of course it's not at all prescriptive that says it has to be one hour I think this is just a framework that helps support you and thinking about how it is you might chunk however much time you have and so right up top we kind of give the suggestion again we talked about this earlier the imagine creates share sort of framework which is spend the first 10 minutes or what I think would be like maybe 10% of the time gathering to come up with ideas around the theme and then spend the bulk of the time creating and then you spend time at the end really important sharing and reflected yeah and so even if you just even if this was just the extent of a guide I think that's a good reminder but there's more which is this is sort of a guide that helps support you in each of those steps so you have how to prepare and then this is the imagine section so for instance in the imagine section you might have a warm act activity where everyone says their name and then everyone in the group packs out the shape of the first letter of their name you might also show the video which shows some really kind of inspiring examples or creating there's some great facilitation tips here and for sharing there's great tips on sharing like questions you might ask like what was the hardest part if you had more time what would you add change and so this is this is like a really really great resource to have to look at through yourself and again try to make it fit for however much time you have but I really do think the imagine create share is there's a framework that's really worth sort of investigating and I think you do get like really great results from that yeah yeah so so if we zoom back out and we look at this again so there's nine there's right now nine activities that have like this complete set of educator guide cards it's toriel and so imagine the world is the only one of the three this year that has that complete set but again think about how it is you can come up with your own icebreaker and I think the share section you can look at any educator guide and match that to whatever it is you're going totally and it's so inspiring to see how educators will remix these things and change them and yeah and make them fit their own contacts yeah yeah oh and talk about the logistics sure that's probably important right there's logistics oh so so much just to think about is like well not just like like should students have accounts why would a student want an account on to ash if you want to work online and save the work online they'll need help don't need to have accounts that that is an important thing and and and I think related to that is you probably want an easy way to generate these accounts and so what I what we suggest doing and there's a link in this guy for educator accounts so we can probably just actually walk you we can show you where it is you get those yeah so an educator account is gonna let you easily create a of scratch accounts associated with your account I know there is so much good stuff in the scratch footer so right yes is for educators down there in the footer a lot of good stuff yep so we'll click that yeah it does feel sad to like blow through all this content but but this one's problem so you can request a teacher account and 24 or 48 hours we'll approve it and there's a great FAQ here if we really have questions it helps walk you through the features of a educator account and I think probably like maybe most importantly to share it today is that you can upload a CSV that has usernames and passwords for your for your class you can also quickly manually create accounts it's like I think it's there nice nice to have it also allows you to more like easily share to Studios plate again check out the fat yeah definitely suggest doing that so there's also another link in the footer let's talk about this let's come back to us so we just talked about being online we understand sometimes the internet goes that there's a giant snow so we're having like yeah your net the internet can drop out of here in any moment there's a huge session about yet so just in case as a contingency plan it might be nice to have the offline editor also some schools would prefer to be offline yeah and so we got you covered let's let's let's show you how we have you covered so we will go back to our browser where can they find so right down here under support you've got this download button download ok and here you can select your OS we have just within the last month a released scratch for a Chrome OS for an Android so scratch works on Chrome but Chromebooks now as its own app which means you can connect to extensions yeah super exciting anyway YUM yes you select your your OS and then it's got all the stuff you need for down for downloading scratch offline yeah and again that's like probably snap that's like an app and you can connect to extensions yeah super cool this was also scratch 3 is like a kind of a single download thing you need to download Adobe AIR and you like that it's super simple couldn't hurt to have it on a flash drive just in case or installed on Chromebooks or your students laptops yeah so you got coverage they're also important the tutorials are also on yes the tutorials are on the offline editor so you don't have to worry about them not being accessible yeah I think we ready to open it up for sharing the the chat has been going like crazy right now so we have a number of socialism I think we also have a llk life on kindergarten scratch team or lily here who is offscreen okay who has been has been helping out in the chat we also have rueful Natalie in the other room and Keo the chat so for this this this this halfhour the last half hour this session we want to exclusively focus on what questions you might have about our code and scratch resources and also we want to highlight a few sort of few stories of how other educators do want to be using hour of code this year how their amazing traps our code yeah yeah are there any questions Lily that you think we should we should try to address yeah question really good how would you say that what do you think say to start but also definitely want to open it up to the chat so answer yeah yeah yes that okay so here's what we wanted to do we are not the sage on the stage we don't have all the answers and in fact we would like to hear from the entire chat this be like a hybrid Twitter chat YouTube thing that is a fantastic question so if you also have suggestions we could use the entire brain trust of who is here right now to help support that so the question is how how do you support folks at different challenge levels um as you put your answers in the chat um I think that we try to design our tutorial our tutorials to be easy to do them in kind of mix them up in any order so and unlike you could take one and then go to two other ones like they're sort of all compatible so you could start with imagine a world and maybe one kid spends the whole time on imagine the world but if you really reinforce to other learners like you could do okay you sort of they say oh I'm done with this one you could say oh well do you want to make it talk and then you can do the talking tails or create animations that talk which also uses the same texttospeech extension as that so you could sort of like uh because you can then combine whatever you would do in the talking tails one could be combined with an imagining world one so I think that I think that's a strategy that I have when we do workshops is to try to encourage that like the tutorials can kind of be like puzzle pieces that can go in any order yeah the tutorials are good jumpingoff points and there's certainly tutorials that have concepts are a bit more challenging yep yep yeah so I would I would say that's that's one way to address it if you have the the means to have a hardware extension like a micro bit or a we do kit I think connecting any of these reefs or any of these activities with a connection to a physical world device is a way to sort of peek a lot of sort of interests and folks that maybe want to kind of get off of the screen a little bit and take their project in a direction of bringing into the physical world I've found a lot of success in that and then I often mention the online community because I think it's a wonderful space filled with a lot of inspirational projects that of course you can see in side and so I would not shy away from inviting folks to sort of check out the online community and think about remix in or building off of another project again and and I if you if you're not familiar with the online community again you can play a project and you can see inside and then if you're logged in you can remix and build on that so I do think there's ways in which you can sort of peek kids interest by showing them inspirational projects in the online community and have them build off of something that is maybe a bit more challenging yeah yeah and focusing the chatter mentioning that like the coding cards have helped with student learners at different levels know that the you know letting them choose their own coding card set to work through it in their own direction one thing also that I should note is it is funny because sometimes that might one way to frame that question is like the complexity of the code becomes maybe like uninteresting whoa like it becomes like too simple okay I'm just like right it's it's like I want I wanna do something more complex and it's like a very code specific very Co specific like want but also like thinking about the audio and the armory there's so many like wonderful artwork tutorials in the online community if you search like vector art tutorials if you search like yeah so so searching for tutorials in the online community whether that's art or like sound is a great thing but also if someone wants to like add gravity or add a high score leaderboard to be honest like if you type in high score tutorial on the scratch website there's going to be hundreds of tutorials that can help so so the search bar is really an important thing yeah to get a good question and like getting that motivation we're like the the there's there's you know making a slideshow project that maybe it's the code is is just switching to the next slide if they're really if you're really motivated to make that slideshow yeah any stage of challenge that was a really good question yeah eh at first time and as well so what question do we have next for us in the chat such a good question will the live chat please please yeah while we ruminate I have won you that one great mic as I see create a story could be a cool one because you could sort of brainstorm a story or brainstorm a story together maybe like before you really with a pencil and paper or just just talking and then with the help of the older kids yeah start making the story it could be yeah there's um there's probably some games too so let me let me jump to let me jump back to our editor here let's make a new project there's a few games where I can see where you might want to make it like a twoplayer game and that would be fun so like for instance chase game chase game the the idea behind the chase game sorry I'm gonna get like super specific into an example I don't know if this is exactly what you should do but for instance chase game is you have a character that chases an object and you are sort of shown in this tutorial to move a character with right arrow keys and left arrow keys but of course you could add a second character and instead of having the right arrow go right you could have the W key and you can have the Q key go left and so you could have instead of just one character and you're gonna have two people two characters either competitively or collaboratively playing a game like this and it would only kind of just take a little bit of hacking of this idea because again this is kind of a single player one sprite chases that's right but I could totally see kind of some cool stuff of having both kids on the keyboard controlling characters totally that could be cool pong game is totally talking the same thing partly the front page of the coding cards of pong game actually show and even the beginning of the tutorial show just a hint that you could easily make it declare anyway they yeah I've had success with animated name actually cuz it doesn't have to be a name it could be it could be something I shared interest or something or it could be something silly because a very beginner activity at a younger audience yeah but actually no no I think a lot of these work like telling a story it's fun to come up with a story together yeah yeah and I had to talk to a educator um history this year who had an awesome project where third graders and eighth graders would would work on would make a monster creature together but the third graders would decide what the head would be in the body and the arms and then the eighth graders would Cody and scratch and bring back to the third graders like the Ephesian so there's also stuff yeah that's a good question thanks yeah thank you so much we don't have any robots back to Jesus so I you know the there's there's the you don't have a robotics webinar or like robotics like Lego robotics or anything on hoc activities this year we do though on the on the extension pages for us Lego so our our extensions we have like scratchy or scratch for instance not dry like you gotyou slash we do oh it's scratch.mit.edu slash in this case we do yeah and so here it's got um a little video that actually we made yeah that um it shows a bunch of like sort of projects you can do what we do and then it shows the basics that face might be familiar uh shows um some starter projects to get started in the stuff so not hoc it's specific for here but there is stuff and the same thing if you instead it in the URL bar in it instead of we do you did Eevee three um or boost I'm pretty sure they have the same one yeah and so again this is like the inspiration you can see here so these starter projects we have a set of three and each of the starter projects will kind of highlight one kind of feature of the robotics kid or whatever hardware device so like play the play basketball you're using the distance sensor for music you're using the buttons on the ev3 and for space tacos tilting you're using or like turning the motor direction yeah to like guide your thing and so it kind of like I get introduces in a very fun generative way different parts so yeah the landing page it's like /eb three and / redo I do wish and I'm not sure this is the case there's an easier way to get to the landing it's a shame that right now it's sorta you have to just know they're there they there they're either link to them from the extensions library if you back at this button this square button in the bottom left any hardware extension if you click on it to add it this is Lego boost how you can it help but gosh that would be it would be great yeah that's a good question um yeah and then I think in terms of more webinars this is the only hoc yeah are people like in it I mean we should probably do more webinars it's fine yeah so I don't know it's probably not between now and yeah it would now now but this will also be available as a video on demand later at this same link yeah um and and we want to do more webinars in the future yeah but in the meantime I want you to play we can talk about languages and scratch this comes up a lot yeah yeah yeah so actually I think not everyone may know this uh but you can change the light scratches translated into over 60 languages and if you click on that globe icon up in the top yes right there um then and then the menu small but you can change the language and then all of the blocks will change the yeah which is pretty great uh the tutorials the videos have captions which are translated into a lot of languages and I think that most of the tutorials have translated into at least thirty languages and then and then up for a you know after the videos there are those images those images that have that different like sort of steps um and in the all of our all of those things having oh that all of our tutorials are in Spanish and so for this hour of code all of our our code activities are available are fully available in Spanish English in Spanish but and more languages coming to come in tutorial translations yeah I think that's kind of fun so Zoey and I and others on the resources team we're trying to think through exactly like how it is we can easily create localized look like translated versions of all of our resources and it's like a laborintensive manual process yeah currently though we have a wonderful shout out huge shot up to the translators who are translating scratch so many different languages it would not be those languages they use size 60 because people have love scratch and want to come back really hard and like every time we make a piece of text on the website and then change the wording slightly they go in and I think the work is it's a good question I would wreck this isn't like oh my gosh there's not options it's just I would like to phone a friend in the chat I don't we have some scratch steamers out here that I'm sure have good ideas as well what comes to mind for you Zoey I think that anime a name you can go you can you can like I think there's that moment where it clicks and you make something do something that was sounded vague but in animate a name it's like you click on a letter and it changes color and I think inanimate name it's so quick it's such a short and and and you could do even like animate a word you could all animate the same word if you've got 30 minutes or you know but but um you know it's like two blocks and and then you've got something happening so I I think that that's that could be an option yeah I I've done workshops that are 30 minutes my introduction is scratch I don't know if I've ever told you this a week my introduction distract was a like 30 minute workshop and what happened was it was it was a very basic introduction to react like a very getting started like here's scratch we actually I'll throw this out there I'm sorry we haven't mentioned this yet I'm gonna go back we have a brilliant I think getting started video Oh which I shouldn't say that cuz we made it brilliant but absolutely brilliant this arrogance okay yeah the getting started has a one minute video that essentially says like what is scratch how do blocks work how do you run blocks how do you trigger the blocks what are sprites and it's like in one minute you can like automatically feel like a bit more comfortable about like what it is you might be doing so again this is like oh you can connect blocks you can then run them and then introduced this idea of there's events so if you want to start your code you drag out an event block and then you know we say you can also rearrange the blocks you can also then toss out the blocks you can add multiple sprites and code them and so like in a minute in literally a minute you get like a good kind of bearing of like okay what is scratch and so I think I can't emphasize enough just giving it the lay of the land is important also I think explaining to folks that it's totally okay to experiment and scratch is about tinkering yeah and if you want to do a tutorial animated names of crazy Christian in the chat one of our friends who helps us make all awesome resources um working our resources team with us is saying said that um for a 30 minute lesson she'll also do group coding so like yes together yes one project and things another awesome idea yeah that could be yeah that's interesting yeah also group together like that 39 introduction what was I was with someone and and it was it had a lot yeah because you're kind of going through it with someone you can bounce ideas off of yeah and I guess thinking about the imagine program share it would still be nice to have like a short imagine section where you show what is possible with scratch yeah and so X on the home page of the scratch website just the home page blog out there's a about scratch video that is like I think I'm minute long which shows you different scratch projects because that's another important thing it's like what the heck is scratch like why would I want to like what is like Cody why am I not inspiration that buyin yeah like I can make games that can make stories Anika make animations so like hit him hit him with a hole inspiration yeah yeah that's great question yeah and I think like a very good to remember that like the time constraints but I don't know how it goes to if you're honest wit yeah if you're on Twitter you should like totally make sure to tweet that that scratch would be in super inches a see how it goes yeah yeah okay we got 12 minutes I'm sure we've got more questions yeah you're more questions and so wondering both like maybe enemy this isn't the time for the places to go can find out more about scratch yeah um the the there is a scratch FAQ which has answers to some of those there's also on the about scratch page that Eric mentioned I think it has some stats about users and stuff yeah I know so yeah we can answer quickly just some of these yeah so so so specifically there's this statistics page where you can see how many people you could via the footer technical questions if there's a specific question you could always use contact us mmm so you can send a message where is contact us contact us down here in the footer contact us have you ask a question if you really want to like dig into like the code that scratch is built on it's all open source so if you google scratch github I'm sure you can find a repository that will have a bunch of documentation and all the all the stuff that you want guys so I would 528 point you there yeah there's one thing about and generally speaking about scratch is them oh it's all open space yeah the website I mean a website there's probably things on the website that's clearly yeah and like the scratch 3 was built on like full requests and like code from other not only within the scratch team but like contributors so like yeah yeah you know there's a lot of folks on better scratch users that contribute to be actively yeah I see caffeinated mention with scratch scratch wiki yeah yeah somebody's asking about being able to create code in scratch that the that that would be super super cool and yeah I am going to write that down sweetie well I was also say so um we had a master student here yeah Tina who is looking at coding for the folks that I've like visual impairments and she was digging into like what could a coding platform might be like if you had to use your voice only and so there's actually a scratch would you update if he wants to scratch video updates which is a video blog series that's on YouTube I think the most recent episode Tina cohosted with me and she actually talked the last three minutes about her work that she was doing around that but we're always thinking about how to sort of make scratch more accessible and I think even in 2020 that's something that like we're really really focused on the s3 is launched we covered them all just kidding how there's so there's so many um so maybe that maybe we can plug the educator page again so let's go back again we will scoot down all this good stuff is who would have thought we spend so much time in the footer but here we are the educators page front and center on the educator page is a wonderful resource called scratch and practice I would describe scratch and practice as well was a monthly every month we'd have a new theme that would help you bring scratch into your practice so the previous themes we had were getting started with scratch connecting to the curriculum peer learning projects with the purpose and then for each of these themes we'd have content that would help you with this so for instance in February we had getting started with scratch we had a workshop so we talked about a workshop that you might want to lead animated character Mitch talked to kind of a high level of sort of how he used sort of the importance of giving kids started with scratch experimenting exploring expressing themselves natalie dove a bit deeper to talk about sort of exploration and an app explanation and then we had educators just like you kind of sharing thoughts on how to get started with scratch and so there's a lot of great themes here to dig into we're not doing a month anymore yeah but there's more important or more cordially I guess you could say yeah so scratch in practice I believe that's also in the handydandy link and that you that you see in the title on the webinar so that's one that comes to mind there here we've got alternative links to the educator guides also the creative computing curriculum guide yeah which is awesome yeah this is how you might plan sort of coding activities introduce scratch and like really just amazing ways over and over several weeks it's it's a it's it's free fantastic guide that's also good yeah so and and there's probably other resources that we sorry it's highly suggest checking out the educator page cool all right we got a couple more minutes seven more minutes let's go back so that's a good question so you might see something if you search hour of code on Twitter you'll see hash of our and you see a lot of kids that hold those certificates like I complete an arc and so we don't scratch does not have those certificates so that's the kind of sharing that you can see at the end is hopefully is like a an exhibition of the projects so so we don't have anything no badges or any certificates for completing it but again hopefully you have time to sort of show off again these projects that hopefully are whoa that's a great question yeah I think we're really we really want to think about that and like how we can support deeper learning yeah it's just some stuff we've been talking about and like how how to really like support all these pathways friendly the first getting started tutorial and I think we were thinking a lot about like what shapes they could take how can we involve more like starter projects I think when we ask people about how they got into making bigger bigger projects a lot of people talk about starter projects yep so I think we probably prioritized we prioritize creating a lot of entrylevel generative thematic tutorials to start with yeah because there's some carryover from 2.0 it's a 3.0 I keep missing on my handi yeah from 2.0 to 3.0 there's some tutorials that came over then we added a bunch of new tutorials and now that we've built out I think a nice sort of library of tutorials or that's one of the things I'm most excited about in 2020 is thinking about how it is we get into sort of these more advanced stuff it's not completely obvious how did you do that I think there's a lot that we can learn from how it's kind of happening on YouTube I think there's a learn from starter projects from whoever asked that question if you have suggestions like you should totally write to us I almost wanted to say like you could put in the chat like where you'd want an advanced tutorial to live like yeah or do you want to paint like when you want to find in this like in the tutorials library we want it to be a scratch project a scratch studio yeah or like a thing online and like and what kind of stuff you want to be like we will listen to all of that might my suspicion is my intuition says it might not take the same form as the tutorial where you step by step starting from a blank slate yeah it might be more starter project he base where you explain the code in the concepts or it might be wrong form I don't know so it's not that we forgotten that we don't it's nothing thank using up today it's a great question and we want to do more of it yeah something we're really excited about yeah there hasn't been a mighty one but I wonder yeah so scratch days are held all around the world I think especially in May but all year round and also in the footer I think it's also in the footer this is less of an HSE webinar and more but the footer so yeah is we have one at MIT have where like folks can come are all around for like as long as MIT is here scratch they will be here I just like it's like that's that is yeah there's the saying I don't know yeah it's got so it's gonna rise in the morning and scratch they will be at MIT today it's like things that are obviously gonna happen yeah so yes so scratch day at MIT I don't actually know the date for this year tonight May 9th May night May night 2010 you you heard of here first that's great that's that's wonderful yes I yeah and if folks are interested in scratch they I figure that's the first time you've heard about this scratch day thing it's as exciting as it sounds its global network where people come together to host to host events to celebrate scratch and the people who scratch it yeah folks will make like scratch projects folks make like cookies with the scratch pad on them folks will make like a scratch projects and new and weird ways and so you can see here there's a lot and not too many these other parallel universes there's thousands and then you can kind of host that explains this this is man resources talking about resource design this is great it's tough you through imagine planning and sort of organizing and inviting it's like everything you need to run a scratch day and poster scratch day yeah two minutes I would point you to that would point you to the downloads page so it's a good question on the download Pam on the scratch day so yeah it takes you away took me away I would point you to the downloads page that should hopefully give you requirements it does give requirements of sort of what sort of operating system you need if if you have a specific question and it's not answered in the FAQ or on this page you can send us a message to contact us but but I think to pop up a level like it's available on Windows Mac and Chrome OS offline so maybe that dish that's covering a lot of bases yeah and the oh one thing to note is with Chrome OS and Android is an Android tablets yeah so I learned this that if it's important distinction so Android could mean phone and tablets phone and tablets but this version of scratch works on android tablet devices not Android phones yeah so are they 30 ready 30 so I I guess we want to thank you all for hanging out contributing to answering the questions thank you so much it's been so fun we've been thinking about this webinar for a long time so we hope you enjoyed it yeah and maybe we should post more of these and we hope you have a wonderful wonderful hour of code and again thank you everyone in the chat who is answering questions and thanks for all the folks out there helping with the chat Thank You Lily the ideas coming of tutorials you'd like to see yeah we want to make uh stuff you you you all have such good ideas you wanna make them cool okay well I guess till next time yes we hope you have a good night and we'll see you later scratch on scratch on bye
