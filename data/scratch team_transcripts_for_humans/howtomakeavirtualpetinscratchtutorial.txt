00:00 - - Hi everyone,
00:00 - It's Zoë from the Scratch team,
00:02 - also known as Zinnea.
00:03 - Today, I wanted to show you
00:04 - how to make a virtual pet in Scratch,
00:06 - a pet you can interact with,
take care of, give food to.
00:10 - In this tutorial,
00:10 - I'll show you how to make
a virtual pet simulator,
00:13 - where you can introduce your pet,
00:15 - animate your pet, feed your pet,
00:17 - and keep track of how hungry your pet is.
00:19 - Let's get started.
00:20 - So first, let's pick a
pet and introduce it.
00:23 - You could draw your own pet.
00:24 - You could upload an image,
00:25 - or you could pick one of the
characters we have in Scratch
00:27 - by clicking this button that
says, "choose a sprite."
00:30 - You could pick any pet you want.
00:31 - You could have a pet dragon
or a pet rock or a pet dog.
00:33 - I will have a pet hedgehog.
00:35 - And let's also choose a backdrop.
00:37 - It can be anywhere you want.
00:38 - I will pick the garden rock.
00:40 - So to introduce our pet,
00:41 - let's have our pet say something.
00:43 - In the looks category,
00:44 - you can drag out a "say" block
00:45 - and write something for your pet to say.
00:48 - And it would be nice if it did this
00:50 - whenever we click the green flag,
00:51 - so we can add a "when green
flag clicked" block on top.
00:55 - Nice.
00:55 - Next let's animate our pet
00:57 - so that it can do a little
animation like this.
00:59 - (hedgehog squeaking)
00:59 - To animate a character in Scratch,
01:01 - you can make it switch
between different poses
01:03 - with this "switch costume" block.
01:05 - So if I drag out two
"switch costume" blocks
01:08 - and pick different poses,
01:10 - I can make it animate between them.
01:12 - Let's connect these blocks
01:13 - by adding a "wait" block in between.
01:15 - I'll have it wait .2 seconds.
01:18 - Nice.
01:18 - It would be cool if we could
get it to repeat this animation
01:21 - and in Scratch, that's really easy.
01:22 - Just use a repeat loop.
01:24 - I'll make this repeat two times.
01:27 - Okay, it repeated,
01:28 - but it looked a little glitchy
01:30 - because it needs to wait
01:31 - after it switches to this costume too.
01:34 - So let's add another wait block.
01:37 - Almost done with our animation.
01:38 - To finish it off, let's
also make it play a sound.
01:41 - You can just go to the sounds tab
01:43 - and click the choose a sound button
01:45 - and then pick whatever sound you want.
01:47 - To make it play the sound,
01:48 - we just need to add a
"start sound" block on top.
01:50 - (hedgehog squeaking)
01:53 - Nice.
01:53 - And let's also add a "when
the sprite clicked" block
01:57 - so that we can make it play this animation
01:58 - every time we click the sprite.
02:00 - (hedgehog squeaking)
02:01 - There we go.
02:02 - Now you've animated your pet.
02:03 - Next, let's feed our pet.
02:05 - Here's what we'll make by
the end of this section,
02:07 - we will make a piece of food,
02:08 - and when we click on it,
02:09 - the pet will go over to it, take a bite,
02:12 - (hedgehog chomping)
02:13 - and then come back to where
it was sitting. Let's do it.
02:15 - So first let's add a piece of food.
02:17 - I'll add an apple.
02:19 - Let's drag out a "when
this sprite clicked" block,
02:22 - because we want to click on the apple
02:24 - and make the hedgehog come over to it.
02:26 - Now, how do we tell the hedgehog
to come over to the apple?
02:29 - There's a really easy way
to do that in Scratch,
02:31 - which is with a broadcast.
02:33 - A broadcast is like an invisible message
02:35 - that one sprite sends out
02:37 - and you can make another
sprite do something specific
02:39 - when it gets that broadcast.
02:41 - So let's make the apple
02:42 - broadcast this invisible
message to the world
02:45 - that will mean that it's
time for the hedgehog to eat.
02:48 - And let's call that message "Food".
02:51 - And now, to make the hedgehog
respond to that message,
02:54 - we can click on the hedgehog
02:56 - and you see this block,
"When I receive food,"
03:00 - we can give it this block.
03:01 - Just to check if it's working,
03:02 - I'll have it say something
when it gets the broadcast.
03:08 - Okay, nice.
03:09 - We can click on the apple.
03:10 - It sends out the broadcast
and the hedgehog receives it,
03:13 - but we don't actually want
the hedgehog to say something
03:15 - when it gets the broadcast,
03:16 - we want it to go over to the apple.
03:18 - We can make it glide over to the apple
03:20 - by dragging out this block
03:21 - that says, "glide to random position"
03:23 - and just choosing, "apple".
03:27 - Nice.
03:28 - It glides right to it.
03:29 - Now let's make it glide back
03:30 - to the position where it was sitting.
03:31 - To do that, we can use this block.
03:33 - In Scratch, if you want
to make your sprite
03:35 - go to a certain position,
03:37 - you can tell it to go
to a certain number X
03:40 - and a certain number Y.
03:42 - If you don't know what X and Y are,
03:44 - X represents how far your sprite is
03:46 - from this side of the screen
03:48 - to this side of the screen.
03:49 - You can see the X and Y that
your sprite is at right here.
03:52 - So over here X is really big, like 240.
03:55 - And if you bring it this way,
03:56 - X is a little lower, like 100.
03:58 - X is zero if you're in
the middle of the screen.
04:00 - And if you go over here,
04:01 - X gets lower than zero
04:03 - and becomes a negative
number like negative 100.
04:05 - And then Y represents how
high up your sprite is.
04:08 - Like if you're up here, Y is 180.
04:11 - And Y is zero if you're in the middle.
04:13 - And if you go below the
middle of the screen,
04:15 - Y is a negative number.
04:16 - Now, here's a handy trick
04:17 - for having your sprite glide
to the X and Y that you want.
04:20 - I'll drag my sprite to
where I want it to glide to.
04:24 - And then the "glide" block
that's in the menu over here,
04:27 - actually updates to that
specific X and that specific Y
04:31 - so I can just drag that out,
04:33 - and now it glides back to
that position on the rock.
04:37 - And let's also add a bite sound
when it gets to the apple.
04:39 - I know we have the sound chomp.
04:42 - So after it gets to the apple,
04:43 - I'll have it start
playing the sound chomp,
04:45 - and then wait 0.5 seconds
and then glide back.
04:48 - (hedgehog chomping)
04:50 - Nice, now we can feed our pet.
04:51 - And lastly, let's make
our project keep track
04:54 - of how hungry our pet is,
04:56 - so that you have to keep feeding it.
04:58 - To do this, let's make a variable.
05:00 - A variable just keeps
track of a certain number
05:03 - in your game, like your score,
05:05 - or in this case, our pet's hunger level.
05:07 - So let's make a variable
and call it, "hunger".
05:10 - And we'll say that the
bigger this number is,
05:13 - the more hungry our pet is.
05:14 - So if it's 100,
05:16 - our pet is really, really hungry.
05:17 - And if it's zero, our
pet's not hungry at all.
05:19 - We want the hedgehog to
get more hungry over time.
05:22 - And for that, we can use this block,
05:24 - "change hunger by one".
05:26 - So that's increasing the hunger.
05:27 - To make it so that the hedgehog
05:28 - is always getting more hungry,
05:30 - we can put this "forever" block around it.
05:33 - Oh my gosh, the hedgehog
got really hungry!
05:35 - So we probably don't want
it to change hunger by one
05:38 - every single instant.
05:39 - Instead, let's have it
always wait five seconds
05:42 - and then change the hunger by one.
05:44 - Okay, now the hunger is
increasing at a nice slow rate,
05:47 - but it's still way too high.
05:49 - So let's set the hunger to
zero when the project starts.
05:52 - Now, we want the hunger level to go down
05:54 - when we eat the food.
05:56 - How do we do that?
05:57 - Well, we can change the
hunger by negative one
06:00 - to have the hedgehog get less hungry.
06:02 - Now the hunger's going down
06:03 - and let's have this happen
when it chomps on the apple.
06:06 - So let's try it out.
06:07 - The hunger's at one,
06:08 - we click on the food
06:10 - and now the hunger goes back down to zero.
06:12 - So there you go.
06:12 - Now you can feed your pet
to make it less hungry.
06:14 - Anyway, that's what I
wanted to show you today.
06:16 - You could take this in so
many different directions.
06:18 - Just like we added the apple,
06:19 - you could add more things
for your pet to interact with
06:21 - like a ball or a toy,
06:22 - and you could add more
variables, like thirst and fun,
06:25 - and the player has to make sure
06:26 - they all stay at a good level.
06:27 - You could add day and nighttime.
06:29 - You could add a sleeping animation.
06:30 - You could have multiple pets.
06:32 - Oh my gosh, that would be so cute.
06:33 - I'm so excited to see
all the things you make.
06:35 - Anyway, I'll see you next time
06:37 - and Scratch on.
