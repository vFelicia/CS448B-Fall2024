00:03 - (applause)
So welcome to
00:04 - Scratch Conference 2018, it's really great
00:07 - to have so many people from so many places
00:10 - joining us here at the Media Lab.
00:13 - It's great to see a lot of
long time friends who have been
00:16 - using and supporting
Scratch for so many years.
00:19 - In some ways, the conference feels
00:20 - a little bit like a family reunion.
00:22 - You could see it last night with people
00:24 - just getting back together,
hugging one another.
00:26 - At the same time, it's great
seeing so many new faces
00:28 - and people joining, some of them
00:30 - just getting started with Scratch.
00:32 - I wanna welcome them
to the Scratch family.
00:34 - I really look forward
to the next three days
00:36 - to have the opportunity for all of us
00:37 - to be sharing ideas and exchanging stories
00:39 - and learning from one another.
00:41 - I really felt it last
night at the reception,
00:44 - kick things off in a really special way.
00:47 - For me, it highlighted the diversity
00:49 - of the Scratch community.
00:51 - At the end of the
evening, as I thought back
00:54 - about the conversations
I had during the evening,
00:56 - I realized that I talked to people
00:58 - from more than 25 countries.
01:00 - I actually counted them.
01:01 - It was from Mexico to Brazil to Chile
01:04 - to France to Poland to Italy to Morocco
01:07 - to Nigeria, Kenya, China, Japan, Korea,
01:10 - all over the world and many more,
01:13 - so it's just really exciting
to have people coming together.
01:16 - But it's not just a geographic diversity.
01:18 - Through those conversations,
it was just great to see
01:22 - all the different ways that people
01:23 - around the world are using Scratch.
01:26 - I remember talking to one teacher
01:29 - from an all girls
elementary school in Mexico
01:32 - and she was telling me
about how in their class
01:35 - the second graders are
creating interactive bracelets
01:39 - using Scratch to program micro-bits
01:41 - to flash hearts and other patterns.
01:43 - And I talked to a teacher from Austria
01:46 - who really has a deep commitment
01:48 - to supporting the culture of integrity
01:51 - and respect in his classroom, so he really
01:53 - engages his kids in using
the Scratch online community,
01:56 - diving in and getting a
different understanding
02:00 - of the opportunities and importance
02:03 - and also the challenges of building
02:05 - an inclusive and respectful community.
02:07 - And I talked to one retired
teacher from Detroit
02:10 - here in the United States who actually
02:12 - had never used Scratch in her
classroom, but after retiring,
02:15 - she learned Scratch from her granddaughter
02:17 - and they were working on Scratch projects
02:20 - throughout the whole
day and translating them
02:23 - for relatives in Spain and in Italy
02:26 - and looking to see how
she can start developing
02:29 - some professional
development opportunities
02:31 - so she can share her
enthusiasm with other teachers.
02:35 - So to me, it just is clear that
02:36 - there's a real incredible
diverse and extraordinary
02:40 - collection of people here
and I really can't wait
02:43 - to have more conversations
over the next few days.
02:45 - As we started planning this conference,
02:48 - I realized that this conference is falling
02:51 - almost exactly 10 years after
02:53 - our very first Scratch conference.
02:56 - It was July 24-26, 2008, almost
to the day, 10 years ago,
03:02 - and through those 10 years, obviously,
03:05 - a lot has changed in those 10 years.
03:07 - At the first Scratch conference,
we had about 200 people.
03:11 - This year we have about 600 people.
03:13 - We're bursting at the seams
and we could have a lot more.
03:15 - As many of you know, we sold
out a few months ahead of time.
03:18 - 10 years ago, at the
first Scratch conference,
03:21 - there was about 150000 projects shared
03:24 - in the Scratch community and
we thought that was a lot.
03:27 - Today, there's more
than 37 million projects
03:31 - shared in the community and everyday
03:33 - there's about 30000 new projects,
03:35 - so every five days, there's
as many projects shared
03:37 - as in the whole first year of Scratch.
03:40 - Also, 10 years ago, the focus
was really just on Scratch,
03:44 - and today, there's all these different
03:48 - Scratch associated
initiatives from Scratch Ed
03:51 - to ScratchJr to Scratch Day,
03:53 - and you have opportunities
in the next few days
03:56 - to learn a lot more about all
of those other initiatives.
04:01 - As we move forward with this,
I think that even though
04:05 - some things have changed a
lot in the last 10 years,
04:08 - there are a lot of things that
have really stayed the same.
04:11 - Some things that haven't changed,
04:13 - important things that haven't changed
04:15 - are the goals and the
motivations and the values
04:20 - that underlie our work on Scratch.
04:22 - From the very beginning, we saw Scratch
04:25 - as more than just a programming language.
04:27 - We saw it as a way to provide
children around the world
04:31 - an opportunity to express
themselves creatively
04:33 - and to develop those creative thinkers.
04:35 - We've taken seriously the idea of Scratch
04:39 - as a new type of literacy,
so we really always
04:42 - are working hard and we
want kids to be able to,
04:45 - we want to provide those opportunities
04:47 - to express their ideas and
to organize their ideas
04:51 - and to share their ideas with others,
04:53 - just as they do when
they're learning to write.
04:56 - And I think as we do that, we see that
05:00 - it's one of the most
important ways that kids,
05:03 - that for all kids, need
these new opportunities.
05:07 - It's not just for a limited number,
05:09 - but these types of
capabilities of expressing,
05:11 - organizing, sharing ideas,
are important for everyone,
05:14 - from all backgrounds, in
all parts of the world.
05:17 - So we've had this deep
commitment to make sure
05:19 - that Scratch is always accessible
05:23 - and appealing and
empowering to all children
05:27 - in all places and in all backgrounds.
05:29 - Of course, as Scratch continues to grow
05:32 - and change and extend
itself around the world,
05:36 - there's real challenges of how we can
05:39 - stay true to those values
and to its mission.
05:42 - I think that's one of the
big challenges ahead of us,
05:44 - to make sure that we stay true to it
05:45 - so that Scratch isn't just used to teach
05:48 - some particular concepts,
as important they may be,
05:51 - but to provide the
opportunities for children
05:54 - to develop their thinking
and to develop their voice.
05:57 - And we know that's not easy to do.
05:59 - It's a lot easier to just
spread the technology
06:02 - than to spread the ideas and the values.
06:05 - I think that's one reason I'm so excited
06:08 - about having all of us together
for this Scratch conference.
06:11 - The conference provides us an opportunity
06:14 - to all of us to come
together and to share ideas
06:18 - and to share stories of
how children are creating
06:22 - and sharing with Scratch and
strategies for supporting them.
06:26 - So, there'll be lots of
opportunities over the next few days
06:29 - for all of you to be sharing
ideas with one another,
06:32 - but maybe just to start, let's
take just a couple minutes,
06:34 - we'll take two or three minutes
06:35 - just to talk to people around
you, to introduce yourself,
06:37 - and just share what
you're doing with Scratch
06:39 - and some of the things you're hoping
06:40 - to learn from the conference.
06:42 - So, we're gonna do that,
just two, three minutes.
06:45 - So, I hope you were able to
get started on conversations.
06:47 - There'll be lots more opportunities
06:49 - over the next few days to continue.
06:51 - As you know, the theme
of this year's conference
06:53 - is the next generation and part of it,
06:58 - of what brings us together,
is I think all of us
07:00 - have this deep commitment to supporting
07:02 - the next generation of children,
07:04 - to provide them with opportunities,
07:06 - to image, create, and share so that
07:09 - they can help shape the future.
07:12 - And I think if we really
want to get an appreciation
07:15 - of how children are using Scratch
07:17 - to imagine, create, and share,
07:20 - it's best to hear from
the children themselves,
07:23 - to hear their stories and their voices.
07:25 - So I'd like to share three stories
07:28 - of three Scratchers, three
members of the Scratch community.
07:32 - And the first story comes from a Scratcher
07:36 - whose username is CoolJewels.
07:38 - And we first found out about CoolJewels
07:41 - when she responded to a prompt
07:44 - that was put up by Natalie
Rusk in the Scratch community
07:47 - and now they posted a
question to Scratchers saying
07:49 - why do you Scratch and asked them to
07:52 - post projects about why do they Scratch.
07:54 - And hundreds of kids posted projects
07:57 - explaining what brought them to Scratch.
07:59 - A graduate student in our
group, Shruti Dhariwal,
08:02 - collected some of those stories
into a lovely book called
08:05 - "Why Do Scratchers Scratch",
so I'll be telling the story
08:08 - that Shruti captured from
"Why Do Scratchers Scratch",
08:12 - and this is the project that CoolJewels
08:14 - had shared on the community and I'll share
08:16 - some screenshots that
were then put in the book
08:19 - where CoolJewels talks
about why she Scratches.
08:22 - And she says, "So, why do I Scratch?
08:25 - Scratch is something I
can express myself with
08:27 - and share my creativity, ideas,
inspirations, and art with.
08:33 - You can make anything
here, from art to a game
08:39 - and so much more, the
possibilities are endless.
08:43 - The whole community is amazing
08:45 - and you make so many friends here.
08:47 - Everybody here is so kind,
creative, and accepting.
08:50 - To be really honest, I never thought
08:53 - I'd be into coding until I found Scratch.
08:57 - It was love first sight."
(audience laughing)
09:01 - And I think CoolJewels is
exactly the type of young person
09:04 - we were trying to attract
as we created Scratch.
09:07 - As I read through CoolJewels' story,
09:09 - it made me think about
some of the principles
09:12 - that we've had for guiding us
as we've developed Scratch.
09:16 - We sometimes call them the
four P's of creative learning,
09:20 - projects, passion, peers, and play.
09:24 - As I read CoolJewels'
story, to me it seemed,
09:27 - her learning and her creative
really were supported
09:30 - by projects, passion, peers, and play,
09:33 - that she was working on
projects based on her passions
09:37 - in collaboration with
peers in a playful spirit.
09:41 - I think that's what really helped her
09:42 - develop her ability to
express herself creatively
09:46 - and to think creatively.
09:48 - And for me, I think this is a key
09:50 - as we all try to spread the spirit
09:52 - and the values of
Scratch around the world.
09:54 - These four P's can serve
as a guiding framework.
09:58 - We can all work to say how can we better
10:01 - support young people to work on projects
10:04 - based on their passions in
collaboration with peers
10:07 - in a playful spirit?
10:09 - I'll go on to my second story,
highlights a young person
10:14 - in the community whose
Scratch username is Forever-,
10:19 - and his real name is
Jinho, and here's a video
10:23 - that was made, Champika
Fernando and Eric Schilling,
10:26 - in our group worked on this video,
highlighting some of the ways
10:29 - that Jinho has interacted in Scratch.
10:38 - I remember reading the news and thinking
10:41 - that I should do something about this,
10:44 - but I didn't know what
I should do about it
10:46 - and then I listened to the song Hands.
10:48 - It featured different
artists coming together
10:52 - and singing a song together and I thought,
10:55 - "Why couldn't we, as Scratchers,
create something together?"
11:00 - (soft music)
I have multi-animator projects
11:03 - that we as Scratchers made together
11:07 - after the Orlando tragedy that happened
11:10 - to honor the people who
died in the Orlando tragedy.
11:14 - This project is a multi-animator project,
11:17 - which means that each part was animated
11:21 - by a different animator
and we stitched it together
11:25 - to create the final product.
11:27 - I think around 40 or 50 people
11:30 - were involved making that project.
11:33 - Scratch is a really
open place where you can
11:36 - share anything you want and you can
11:40 - express your feelings however you want
11:43 - and I think that's a really
beautiful part of it.
11:46 - ("Hands" - A Song for Orlando)
12:01 - And hopefully, the project when I share it
12:03 - with the community was
to be able to reach out
12:09 - to some of the other
people in this generation
12:13 - and know that there are
people who support them and...
12:25 - (applause)
12:34 - If you look at the
project, clearly you can see
12:36 - that Jinho and his colleagues
that he worked with
12:39 - are developing lots of
computational skills,
12:42 - also they're clearly being
guided by those four P's
12:45 - of work on a project that was
clearly based on passions,
12:48 - it is collaborative,
multi-animator project,
12:51 - working with peers and experimenting
12:53 - in new ways in a playful spirit.
12:55 - We look at this project, we also, to me,
12:58 - it brings to mind a
fifth P, the P of purpose
13:02 - and I think this time,
we see more and more
13:03 - of young people using Scratch
to work on projects that
13:06 - they really wanna try to make
a difference in the world,
13:10 - to see how they can work on things
13:12 - that really make a difference
in their community,
13:13 - and this, I think we're
thinking about more,
13:15 - in fact, at this session, the conference,
13:16 - about the fifth P of purpose.
13:18 - And also we wanna continue to think about
13:20 - adding purpose to the projects,
passion, peers, and play.
13:24 - I'll tell my third and final story.
13:28 - And this is a story about
a project by a Scratcher
13:32 - with the username ZeptoPower006
13:35 - who's on the Autism spectrum
and shared this project
13:40 - as a way of sharing some of his thoughts
13:42 - about his interactions in the world.
13:45 - So let me share the project with you.
13:53 - Hi, my name is Alex
and this is my story.
13:59 - Some of my favorite hobbies are
14:00 - playing video games and drawing.
14:02 - I've been creating comics
for a very long time.
14:05 - I'm very good at math and coding.
14:08 - I'm very funny, kind, and smart.
14:10 - I also have Autism. Autism
affects me in many ways.
14:14 - It makes me think different.
14:16 - Sometimes in math I would solve problems
14:18 - in ways that even my
teachers didn't think of.
14:22 - You think they'd know it, but no.
14:25 - (audience laughing)
Sometimes, when I need
14:27 - to think, I pace.
14:28 - It helps me concentrate
and it's called stemming.
14:31 - My teachers let me do this,
because it helps me think.
14:34 - Autism makes me a very picky eater.
14:37 - I like crunchy foods and
I don't like mushy foods,
14:40 - because they make me gag.
14:42 - The texture of the food bothers my senses.
14:44 - My senses are supercharged and sometimes,
14:47 - that makes me feel uncomfortable.
14:49 - Sometimes I get really
overwhelmed by bad feelings
14:52 - and I just want people to be
understanding and patient.
14:56 - It's okay to be different.
14:57 - However, some people don't treat
14:59 - different people very nicely.
15:02 - And there's just so much
no with that decision.
15:05 - I wish people would treat
15:07 - different people completely normally.
15:10 - Being different makes
the world more diverse.
15:13 - If everyone was the same,
then the world would not be
15:16 - very interesting.
(audience laughing)
15:18 - I think that the secret to a good life
15:20 - is to just you be you.
15:23 - Pick your own path and accept others
15:25 - for which path they choose.
15:27 - Be kind. That is my story.
15:31 - (applause)
15:40 - That was one of my
favorite Scratch projects
15:41 - from the last few years, because to me,
15:43 - it really captured some of the essence
15:45 - of what we're trying to
do, provide opportunities
15:47 - to everyone from all backgrounds
15:49 - to develop their voice
and to share their ideas.
15:51 - And the way he says, "You be you."
15:53 - That's what we wanna do with Scratch.
15:55 - We want everyone to you be you.
15:56 - We know there are many different pathways
15:58 - that kids are gonna engage in the world
15:59 - and trying to make sure that
everyone has an opportunity
16:02 - to be themselves and to
find their own pathways
16:05 - to be able to live up
to their full potential.
16:09 - So I think all of these projects
16:11 - from CoolJewels to Jinho
Forever- to ZeptoPower006,
16:17 - I think they sort of capture
some of the spirit of Scratch.
16:21 - For those of us on the
Scratch team here at MIT,
16:24 - as we look at projects like this,
16:27 - and of course there are millions of others
16:28 - like this on the website, I
just chose these few examples,
16:31 - you would get lots of, we're
always taken by surprise
16:35 - by the type of things kids
do that we never imagined
16:37 - and we're always amazed
and delighted and inspired
16:41 - by what it is the kids do.
16:42 - And we always try to take it into account
16:45 - as we think about extending
and further developing Scratch,
16:49 - whether it's the software, the
community, or the activities,
16:52 - trying to get inspiration from
16:54 - the members of the Scratch community.
16:56 - And that really brings
us to another aspect
16:59 - of the theme of the next generation,
17:01 - as many of you know, we've been working on
17:04 - a next generation of Scratch itself
17:06 - that we call Scratch 3.0
and I think we've always
17:08 - been inspired by the community.
17:10 - We really want to make
sure that we develop
17:12 - the next generation of Scratch
17:14 - that's worthy of the
next generation of kids.
17:16 - So we've been working hard at it.
17:19 - There's a team here working on it.
17:21 - I hope you have a chance
through the conference
17:23 - to meet some of the couple dozen of people
17:25 - that are working on Scratch here.
17:27 - But I'd like to sometime to give an update
17:29 - on some of the things
we're working on in Scratch
17:31 - and invite three leaders of the team
17:33 - to come join me on the stage,
17:34 - Andrew Sliwinski, Natalie
Rusk, and Champika Fernando.
17:38 - (cheering and applause)
17:54 - I think we'll start with Andrew
who's been leading the team
17:57 - developing this next
generation of Scratch,
17:59 - leading it to big design
and engineering efforts.
18:02 - So Andrew'll give a bit of an update
18:03 - about some of the
thinking that's gone into
18:06 - the work on Scratch 3.0 and the sneak peek
18:08 - of some of the things with it.
Sure.
18:14 - So, thank you.
18:15 - So I think, as Mitch was just saying,
18:18 - when we look around the Scratch community,
18:21 - we see just such an incredible diversity
18:23 - of the things that kids are making
18:25 - and it's incredibly inspiring.
18:27 - And when we look at the kind
of scale that we're reaching,
18:30 - over the last 12 months,
both the online and offline
18:34 - versions of Scratch have been
used by over 200 million kids.
18:38 - That's a whole heck of a lot of kids,
18:40 - but when we think about our mission,
18:43 - we're really thinking
about, how do we make sure
18:45 - that all of these kids are reaching
18:48 - and being touched by
the big, powerful ideas
18:51 - that underlie our work that
Mitch was just talking about.
18:54 - And so, when we're thinking about
18:55 - the next generation of Scratch,
18:57 - I think the question for us was really,
18:59 - and the foundational
goal for us was really,
19:01 - how do we make sure that we're
19:02 - reaching kids where they're at?
19:04 - How do we make sure
that these opportunities
19:06 - are available for all children,
19:08 - everywhere, from all backgrounds?
19:11 - And so, a major way in which we do that
19:13 - is we use the creative learning spiral
19:16 - that some of you may have seen before
19:18 - where we hope that kids
who are using Scratch
19:22 - are imagining, creating,
playing, sharing, and reflecting
19:25 - as they're using Scratch,
as they're doing these
19:28 - creative learning activities,
but in the same way,
19:31 - that same process can be
used to describe our process
19:36 - for how we develop Scratch,
for how we build Scratch,
19:39 - for how we interact with children,
19:41 - see the way that they're using
19:43 - the types of tools that
we're building for them
19:45 - and make it better, make it stronger,
19:47 - make sure that these powerful
ideas are accessible to all.
19:51 - And so, when we think about
the goals that we have
19:53 - for the next think of Scratch
that we call Scratch 3.0,
19:56 - really the primary foundation
really is this idea
20:00 - of reaching kids where they are.
20:03 - And there's a lot of
different dimensions of that.
20:05 - There's everything from making sure that
20:07 - Scratch is easy enough to
use, that it's intuitive,
20:09 - that it's easy to pick
up and start to play with
20:12 - and start to have a creative
tinkerable experience with,
20:15 - but it also talks about
localization and accessibility
20:19 - and all of these different dimensions
20:20 - that are so important for
us to fulfill our mission.
20:23 - So, when we look at
Scratch 3.0 as it is today,
20:28 - we're really excited about the progress
20:29 - and really excited
that, at the conference,
20:32 - there's gonna be lots of
opportunities for you folks
20:34 - to take a look at this
next generation of Scratch,
20:36 - and when you look at
the coding area, right,
20:39 - so this is Scratch 3.0, it still kinda
20:43 - looks and feels like Scratch,
but the team has done
20:46 - a lot of work to make a
lot of these refinements,
20:50 - to make things simpler, to make it easier
20:52 - to kind of get started, to make it easier
20:54 - to really go from zero to hello world
20:58 - and then hello world to whoa, right?
21:00 - Like we wanna get kids
to that moment of joy,
21:03 - that moment of seeing the
possibilities in Scratch.
21:06 - And we've done a lot of work
in the coding side of things,
21:09 - but we also know that Scratch is more
21:10 - than just a programming language.
21:12 - There's also a paint editor,
which is incredibly important
21:16 - as you just saw in some of the projects
21:17 - that Mitch just showed, and
the team's done a great job
21:20 - of refining a lot of the paint editor
21:24 - to make it easier to get started with,
21:26 - but also to make it a
little bit more powerful
21:28 - so that kids can do
the types of animations
21:30 - that they wanna do, and also to make
21:32 - some of the features of the paint editor
21:34 - that today are a little bit
tricky to get working with,
21:37 - things like gradients,
and try to make those
21:39 - more accessible, make those
easier for all kids to use.
21:42 - Another place where we've
spend a lot of time is sound.
21:47 - And the team really
sort of took a step back
21:50 - and through doing a lot
of workshops with kids,
21:52 - tried to look at how are
kids using sound in Scratch?
21:56 - What are the opportunities for us
21:57 - to sort of transform sound from something
22:00 - that you just kind of grab from
22:02 - the library and add to your project,
22:03 - to something that you can paly with,
22:05 - something that you can tinker with,
22:06 - something that you can
really have fun with?
22:08 - Make that a part of the medium as well.
22:10 - And another area where
we spent a lot of time
22:14 - is the actual libraries themselves.
22:16 - So, in addition to adding a whole bunch
22:19 - of new sprites and sounds
and backdrops to the library,
22:23 - we've also spent a lot of time
22:24 - making the libraries a
little bit easier to use
22:26 - and introducing search into the libraries,
22:28 - which is something that we all know
22:30 - from our experience working with kids,
22:32 - that kids find it incredibly intuitive
22:34 - just to be able to search
for what they're looking for.
22:36 - And on the library side,
we were lucky enough
22:40 - to be able to partner with a large number
22:42 - of incredibly talented artists.
22:44 - Some of those artists
are actually Scratchers,
22:47 - to produce new assets for the library.
22:50 - So now we're making sure
that we have everything
22:53 - from food trucks to boom
boxes to toucans to zebras,
22:56 - really making sure that we're going broad
22:59 - with the range of interests
that kids bring to Scratch.
23:03 - And last but not least, I
think one of the other parts
23:07 - that's really important about
reaching kids where they are
23:09 - is making sure that we're on
the platforms where kids are.
23:13 - So, Scratch 3.0 is the
first version of Scratch
23:16 - that we've ever had that
works on desktop devices,
23:18 - just as it does today, but it
also works on touch devices,
23:22 - including Android and iOS
tablets, as well as Chromebooks.
23:26 - (applause)
23:32 - And early next year, when we launch
23:35 - the full version of Scratch, this will be
23:38 - the first version of
Scratch where you'll also
23:40 - be able to play Scratch
projects on your phone.
23:43 - (cheering and applause)
23:46 - I think one of the other
major pieces of Scratch 3.0
23:50 - and one of the big, big goals for us
23:53 - has been expanding the possibilities
of what Scratch can do.
23:55 - We know that so many
kids love making games.
23:59 - They love making animations.
24:00 - They love making multi-player projects.
24:02 - They love doing all
these different things.
24:04 - They love making pen
projects, you name it.
24:07 - But we also know that there's
24:08 - a lot more opportunity out there
24:10 - and we've seen through our testing
24:13 - and through working with kids,
24:14 - just how excited they can get when we
24:16 - connect Scratch to hardware,
when we connect Scratch
24:18 - to the physical world,
when we connect Scratch
24:20 - to things like speech, and so,
24:22 - we've spend a lot of time
developing a new platform
24:26 - within Scratch 3.0 called extensions
24:29 - that really change the possibilities
24:32 - and expand what you can do with Scratch.
24:34 - So one of the first examples
that I'm gonna show,
24:38 - and hopefully this all works,
24:40 - is we've been really excited about
24:43 - working with the micro:bit team
24:45 - on our integration with the micro:bit.
24:49 - And one of the things that
I'm really excited to show you
24:52 - is kind of how that works,
24:53 - so let's build a little project here.
24:57 - So I'm gonna add the space backdrop
25:03 - and then I'm going to get rid of the cat.
25:08 - We're gonna replace the cat with a dog.
25:09 - Hopefully that's okay.
25:11 - So we're gonna search for
dog and I get all the dogs.
25:14 - And now I have Dot and so down here,
25:20 - in the bottom left hand corner,
25:21 - this is the extensions library,
so I'm gonna click on that,
25:24 - and then I'm gonna
connect to the micro-bit.
25:26 - I'm gonna make sure that
my micro-bit is powered on.
25:28 - It's gonna look for devices.
I'm gonna connect it.
25:31 - Connected, and now that it's connected,
25:34 - what I can do is just
start to really quickly
25:37 - build an interactive program.
25:38 - So I can connect the A button press
25:40 - (dog barking)
25:43 - to just playing the sound of bark.
25:45 - And I can make another little stack here
25:48 - and I'm gonna use another new feature,
25:51 - which is changing sound effects.
25:54 - So I can change the pitch effect
25:55 - and I can change that to the
tilt angle of the micro:bit.
25:58 - And so now, if I start
this stack we can go:
26:02 - (dog barking)
(high pitch dog barking)
26:06 - (laughing)
(applause)
26:12 - And we can move our little puppy here
26:14 - and let's add a little
bit more interactivity.
26:16 - We'll make Dot, the dog, the space dog,
26:20 - move and oh, we'll activate
this and then we can go:
26:23 - (high and low pitched dog barking)
26:28 - Very musical dog.
26:29 - And so, just using
something as simple as that,
26:37 - we can go from zero to
a playful experience
26:40 - really, really quickly and I
think that's trying to deliver
26:43 - on both the simplicity of Scratch,
26:44 - but also expanding the possibilities
26:48 - of what kids can do, right?
26:49 - Using low cost hardware
like the micro-bit,
26:52 - we really see a lot of potential.
26:53 - And the micro-bit is by no means
the only hardware extension
26:59 - or software extension
that we're working on.
27:01 - Micro:bit is one of many.
27:03 - So micro:bit's been a
great partner for us,
27:05 - but we're also working with
folks like Lego and Sphero
27:08 - and the Raspberry Pi folks are here,
27:10 - who we're also working
on extending Scratch
27:14 - into the physical world with all of these
27:17 - different types of platforms.
27:18 - And then on the software side,
27:20 - there's also a bunch of really
tremendous opportunities
27:22 - for us to extend Scratch to do things
27:24 - like speech recognition or text to speech
27:27 - or object detection, all
sorts of different things
27:31 - that we're working on with
27:32 - different types of software partners
27:33 - like Amazon Web Services and Google,
27:36 - but that's by no means the end.
27:38 - This is just the beginning of what
27:40 - we're working on right now.
27:42 - And so, I guess if you
frequently ask questions,
27:46 - that's kind of the next piece.
27:48 - One of the questions that
I know that you folks
27:51 - are gonna ask me is when
can you get access to this.
27:53 - I'm very happy to say you
can get to it right now.
27:56 - So, the team pushed this live yesterday,
28:00 - so you can go to beta.scratch.mit.edu
28:05 - and use that during the conference.
28:08 - And there's going to be a whole bunch
28:09 - of different workshops and sections
28:10 - that'll be using this beta
throughout the next couple days.
28:14 - The other big question is when will
28:16 - the full version launch, right?
28:18 - When will it be available in the community
28:20 - for all kids to use?
28:21 - And the answer for that is January 2nd,
28:24 - so right after the New Years.
28:26 - And one thing that you'll notice on here
28:29 - is the beta, we're actually not going to,
28:32 - you all are getting a
special preview of it today,
28:34 - but the beta will
actually become available
28:38 - for all kids on the Scratch community
28:40 - on August 1st, so next Wednesday.
28:43 - And we're really excited and
the kids are also very excited.
28:46 - And I think, last but not least...
28:49 - And also, just to be clear,
the beta, when it comes out,
28:52 - will be separate from the community,
28:54 - so they can still go to
the current Scratch website
28:56 - to kind of just share
things in the community
28:59 - and that'll be integrated
into the community on January. Yep, on January 2nd, the
Scratch 3.0 will become
29:06 - the sort of foundation
for the community as well.
29:09 - And then last but not least is
29:11 - how can I learn more about
Scratch 3.0 at the conference?
29:14 - So there's a lot of
different opportunities.
29:16 - There's a whole range
of different sessions.
29:18 - Today there's two
workshops that many of you
29:21 - have signed up for that are now
full, Scratch 3.0 workshops,
29:25 - but have no fear, there's lots
29:26 - of other opportunities as well.
29:28 - Tomorrow, there are gonna be multiple
29:31 - Scratch 3.0 studios happening in the cube
29:33 - with a whole bunch of different members
29:35 - of the Scratch 3.0 design
and development team
29:38 - and resources team supporting that.
29:40 - And then in addition to that, on Saturday,
29:43 - we have a special session
that's going to be
29:46 - a whole bunch of members
of the actual team
29:50 - that built Scratch 3.0 on a panel together
29:53 - talking a little bit about the process,
29:54 - talking a little bit about the design,
29:56 - and answering questions
that you might have.
29:58 - So if you wanna learn
more about extensions
30:01 - or you have questions
about how we built 3.0
30:04 - or have questions about the process,
30:06 - that would be a great session for you.
30:08 - And then last but not least, I think
30:10 - the most important thing is to look
30:11 - for the orange ask me
buttons that a lot of members
30:16 - of the team are all wearing.
30:18 - And if you have questions,
if you see us during lunch
30:21 - or during dinner or any other time,
30:23 - feel free to ask us questions
30:24 - and we'd be happy to chat about it.
30:26 - Great, okay, thanks, Andrew.
(applause)
30:34 - As we introduce Scratch 3.0,
of course we wanna make sure
30:37 - that there are lots of ways to help
30:40 - kids and educators get
started with Scratch,
30:42 - so we've put a lot of thought into
30:44 - how can we better support
those introductory experiences
30:47 - and what resources and support
materials can we provide
30:51 - to help support people who
are just getting started?
30:53 - So, Natalie Rusk will talk about that.
30:56 - Natalie has been working
on the Scratch project
30:58 - since day one, since before
it even had the name Scratch,
31:01 - has led a lot of the efforts
and learning research
31:04 - around Scratch and leading up
31:05 - the development of
resources around Scratch.
31:09 - (applause)
31:15 - So our resource team, we now have
31:18 - a great Scratch learning resource team
31:20 - and our challenge is
really, how do you design
31:23 - learning resources that
spark that creative learning,
31:27 - those four P's, and some of the things
31:30 - that I wanna share with
you and that we're gonna be
31:33 - interested in sharing with
you throughout the conference
31:35 - are some of those ideas
that we've been working on.
31:40 - And it's been inspired by some of you,
31:43 - have used the Scratch coding cards,
31:46 - so these cards, these were
really developed with this idea
31:50 - that we're inspired by actually,
31:52 - Seymour Papert's idea that
education has little to do
31:56 - with explanation and how do you dive in?
32:01 - He also talked about how using ideas
32:04 - comes before understanding them,
32:06 - so rather than explaining the concepts,
32:08 - how do you have something that right away,
32:10 - oh I wanna make this happen,
32:12 - I wanna make something jump
around, how do I do that?
32:15 - On the back it has some
coding and it shows you
32:19 - how do I do that and we've been doing it
32:21 - in different interest
areas and a lot of these
32:23 - are inspired by projects that we see
32:26 - young people on the community
making, like virtual pets.
32:30 - Okay, that's a topic that has sparked
32:33 - a lot of interest and ideas and thinking,
32:36 - so how do we make that
available to more people
32:39 - through these Scratch coding
cards that have been available.
32:43 - And now, thanks to a lot of you,
32:44 - translated into different languages.
32:47 - So, how do we bring that so that
32:49 - when someone opens up Scratch 3.0,
32:51 - they can have a similar experience
32:53 - of just diving in and starting to play?
32:56 - So yeah, we've also had
these educator guides
33:02 - that help show how do you use those cards,
33:04 - so here in Scratch 3.0, you're gonna find
33:08 - a whole set of tutorials
that have that idea
33:12 - of just diving in and getting started.
33:14 - I'm gonna show you in Scratch.
33:17 - So, in Scratch, you'll
now find there's a button
33:21 - at the top that says tutorials.
33:23 - Let me get my cursor. There it is.
33:27 - So if you click on that,
33:28 - there's a little light bulb next to it.
33:30 - You'll get popping up choices,
33:33 - and these are just the beginning.
33:34 - We're gonna be expanding on
it, but let's see for example,
33:36 - how do I change size of something?
33:39 - And if I look at that,
I can play the video.
33:43 - - With a change size block,
you can make a sprite
33:45 - get bigger or smaller.
(clicking)
33:49 - To keep going, you can use a repeat loop.
33:54 - Or type in a minus sign to
get smaller and smaller.
33:59 - To reset size, you can
use the set size block.
34:03 - 100 will get it back to the original size,
34:06 - or try a bigger or smaller number,
34:08 - depending on what you want.
34:13 - Choose your own sprite and try it out.
34:16 - - So we're hoping that that will help,
34:18 - just a little short
thing, but it gives you
34:21 - some sense of some idea and some concept
34:24 - to start playing around
with with your own things.
34:27 - We also have in the tutorial window
34:31 - some of the more starter projects,
34:35 - like how would I get
started on making something?
34:37 - So that's one thing I
can start trying out,
34:39 - but how would I do
something like making a game
34:42 - or animating my name or making music?
34:45 - So these also, you'll see if you play it,
34:48 - it has a video that shows you
34:49 - what are some possibilities
that you could do
34:52 - and then you can see what are the steps
34:54 - and just right here in the editor,
34:56 - without going anywhere else,
you can start following along.
35:00 - It just has enough, again,
to hopefully spark interest,
35:03 - get ideas started, and then
seeing how young people
35:08 - start remixing, using their own ideas
35:10 - and just building on these ideas.
35:14 - So we're looking forward to, again,
35:15 - at the Scratch studio,
we'll be sharing those
35:18 - and talking about how you can
just start exploring those
35:20 - at the beta of that Scratch.
35:22 - And just a really important
mention, as I said,
35:26 - that these have been
translated into other languages
35:28 - and right now, the
current version of Scratch
35:31 - is translated thanks to a
lot of you in the community,
35:34 - translated into more than 50 languages.
35:37 - Scratch 3 is getting there
and a lot of you also
35:40 - have been working on that.
35:42 - We could really use more translators.
35:44 - And also more reviewers.
35:46 - If you speak a language, to
see okay, is this making sense?
35:49 - And we especially need people like you
35:50 - who've tried out Scratch, who've
used it with young people,
35:53 - what are the words that really
35:54 - make sense for localizing this?
35:57 - So this is both for the
resources and for this,
36:00 - and to find out more about that
36:02 - and just to talk to us, we'd love to meet
36:05 - those of you who've been working on it
36:06 - or are interested in contributing.
36:08 - There's gonna be a poster today
36:10 - at 4:30 to 5:30 on the third floor.
36:12 - If you can't make it then,
there's also an email.
36:16 - You can email our translation team
36:19 - at translate@scratch.mit.edu
and let us know
36:24 - what you're interested in doing
and we'll connect with you.
36:27 - Thanks.
hanks, Natalie.
36:29 - (applause)
36:34 - And with all the things
we're trying to do,
36:37 - even though the Scratch
team here has been growing,
36:39 - we know we can't do things by ourselves,
36:41 - the same way we're reaching out
36:42 - to partner with others on translation,
36:44 - we're having a growing number of ways
36:46 - of collaborations, of partnerships,
36:48 - and that's one thing that
Champika will talk about.
36:51 - Champika has contributed to the team
36:52 - in many different ways over the years.
36:54 - She actually was helping on the team
36:56 - that put out Scratch 2.0 and
helped in the development
36:58 - of Scratch 2.0, went away for a while,
37:01 - was a student for awhile, came back,
37:02 - and is now heading up the efforts
37:04 - in outreach and communications.
37:06 - And she'll talk about some
of the work we're doing
37:07 - in connecting with
others around the world.
37:10 - Thanks.
(applause)
37:17 - Alright, thanks, Mitch.
37:18 - So I'm gonna bring it full
circle, back to community,
37:21 - what Mitch was talking
about in the beginning.
37:23 - So just to reiterate, when
we think about Scratch,
37:25 - when we talk about Scratch, it's not just
37:28 - the programming language and the editor,
37:30 - it's this massive global community,
37:32 - all of you who share our ideas
37:35 - and this commitment to the
next generation of kids,
37:37 - the next generation of creators.
37:40 - And so I wanna take a
moment and just highlight,
37:42 - you've heard some of the things
37:44 - that we're working on with Scratch 3.0,
37:45 - but I'm gonna take a moment and
highlight some of the things
37:48 - you guys are doing in the community.
37:53 - Actually, I'll start
with a few organizations
37:57 - that we've had the
opportunity to work with
37:58 - to make suer that when
Scratch 3 comes out,
38:00 - there's lots and lots of really great
38:03 - free resources available.
38:04 - So our friends at Harvard
on the Scratch Ed team
38:07 - have been working to update their
38:09 - Creative Computing Curriculum Guide
38:12 - so that it's ready for Scratch 3.0
38:14 - when it launches in January.
38:16 - Our friends over at Code Club,
38:20 - sponsored by the Raspberry Pi Foundation,
38:23 - are working on updating
all of their tutorials
38:26 - and activities online so
that all the code clubs
38:28 - around the world will
have updated resources
38:31 - for Scratch 3.0 as well.
38:32 - CS First, our friends at Google,
38:36 - will be updating all of
their video tutorials
38:38 - to make sure that those are ready.
38:42 - And we've been continuing to do our work
38:44 - with Cartoon Network to
create some new tutorials
38:46 - around Scratch 3.0 using their characters,
38:50 - some of my favorites, the Powerpuff Girls.
38:54 - We feel really lucky to be working with
38:57 - some of these really
amazing organizations,
38:58 - but we're actually even more inspired
39:01 - by the thousands of other folks,
39:03 - including many of you in the room,
39:06 - who are producing resources and materials
39:09 - for your local communities.
39:11 - And so actually, if you do do that,
39:12 - we would love to hear about the resources
39:15 - that you're creating.
39:16 - If you go to this link,
bit.ly/scratch-resources-developers,
39:23 - you can fill out a form and tell us
39:25 - about the resources you're developing
39:27 - and also join our resource
developers mailing list
39:30 - so that we can keep you updated
39:31 - on sort of the development of Scratch 3.0
39:35 - and how you can think about
updating your resources
39:37 - and getting them ready for the launch.
39:40 - And so it's not just
resources and activities
39:45 - that people are producing and sort of,
39:47 - that's not the only way people
in the community are engaged.
39:49 - Some of you may have been to
39:51 - or even hosted your own Scratch day.
39:53 - These are activities that are
hosted all around the world
39:57 - in homes, community
centers, schools, offices,
40:02 - and they're organized,
they're one day activities
40:07 - that bring together
kids, parents, families,
40:09 - to create and share around Scratch.
40:12 - And the first one was
actually hosted here at MIT
40:15 - and then in 2009, we put out resources
40:18 - for how to host your own, and since then,
40:21 - it's grown to be this global thing
40:22 - that's hosted all around the world.
40:23 - And actually this year,
there's been already
40:27 - more than 1000 that have been hosted
40:29 - in more than 60 countries
around the world.
40:32 - And of course, there's
a Scratch conference,
40:36 - which is where you are right now,
40:38 - in case you didn't know.
40:39 - And that again, the first one
was hosted, as Mitch said,
40:43 - here at MIT, with the
idea of bringing together
40:46 - educators to share ideas
and learn from one another.
40:49 - And each year, it's been hosted
40:52 - either here at MIT or elsewhere,
40:54 - there's been one Scratch conference.
40:56 - But last year, there were actually
40:58 - half a dozen Scratch conferences
41:00 - hosted all around the world
led by people in the community.
41:04 - We found that really inspiring.
41:06 - At this year's Scratch conference,
41:10 - we actually got more than 400 proposals
41:12 - and it's just really inspiring to see
41:15 - all the different ways
people are using Scratch
41:17 - in their local communities.
41:19 - You can' really read that schedule,
41:22 - but the schedule's out on the wall there
41:24 - and you'll have it in your booklet.
41:26 - We hope you'll check out
a lot of the sessions
41:29 - and meet new people, share ideas,
41:31 - and take things away with you
41:33 - that you can use in your own communities.
41:36 - But even if you're not hosting a session
41:40 - at the Scratch conference this year,
41:43 - we wanna hear your stories and so,
41:44 - some of the folks on the team have come up
41:47 - with these prompts to help you
41:50 - think about sharing your story.
41:52 - And actually, find at lunch
today these Scratch cards,
41:56 - these little cards with questions on them
41:59 - that help you think about
how you can share your story.
42:03 - And there's a few different ways
42:04 - we want you to think about doing that.
42:06 - So at lunch, at your table, you can share,
42:08 - you can start a
conversation with the person
42:10 - next to you at your table,
42:11 - talk about how you're using Scratch.
42:14 - You can also, we'll have a kiosk
42:17 - set up on the fifth floor
where if you feel inspired
42:20 - you can go and record your story.
42:22 - And then, if you wanna tell the world,
42:24 - you can go on Twitter and share your story
42:28 - with the hashtag, #ScratchStories.
42:31 - So we hope that you'll share
what you're working on.
42:36 - We'd love to learn from you
42:38 - and we hope that you'll
share with one another.
42:41 - And again, I'll end on sort of saying,
42:43 - as we think about the future of Scratch
42:46 - and all the things with Scratch 3.0,
42:48 - we're really excited to think about
42:50 - how the community will grow along with us.
42:54 - Okay, thank you, Champika.
(applause)
43:02 - So we're gonna wrap up with giving you
43:03 - a little bit of an overview
and guide to the conference
43:05 - as we're getting started
with the conference.
43:07 - I think to navigate the conference
43:10 - might require some little guidance.
43:13 - So one thing that was
helpful, Champika mentioned
43:16 - in the back of your name
tag, there is a guide,
43:20 - if you haven't seen already,
that you can pull out
43:22 - that is your conference guide.
43:24 - In there, you'll see one
thing is a quick overview,
43:30 - the conference in a glance.
43:31 - So I just wanted to say
a few things about this.
43:33 - So you'll see Thursday, Friday, Saturday,
43:35 - and each day will be starting
43:37 - with a keynote session like this one,
43:39 - so we'll be in this hall to get started
43:42 - on Friday and Saturday
with a keynote session,
43:44 - and then there'll be
various parallel sessions,
43:46 - where you'll see the morning
and afternoon sessions.
43:48 - There'll be more than a dozen
things happening in parallel.
43:51 - Those sessions you'll be able
to look at the listing also
43:55 - in the program, to choose
different things to go to.
44:03 - As we do this, the three
days are so much different.
44:06 - Today is a little different
and then all of the sessions,
44:09 - the breakout sessions,
are all workshops today.
44:12 - In the future days, there'll also be
44:14 - night talks and panel discussions.
44:16 - We thought it was great,
in the spirit of Scratch,
44:18 - to get started with more hands on
44:20 - participatory sessions on day one,
44:22 - so there'll be 90-minute sessions,
44:24 - one in the morning, one in the afternoon.
44:27 - These were ones that you were asked
44:30 - to register for ahead of time,
44:31 - so in your name tag,
you should have tickets
44:33 - for the two sessions you registered for.
44:35 - If you didn't, you should be able
44:37 - to pick up some extra
tickets at registration
44:40 - or just go to the tables
right outside here
44:42 - if you don't have a ticket.
44:43 - But for today, you need to go to
44:44 - the sessions that are registered for.
44:46 - If you're not registered
yet, pick up a ticket
44:48 - at the tables right outside
the hall and go there.
44:50 - For the next couple days,
for Friday and Saturday,
44:54 - the session's will be going in parallel
44:56 - and just be going around
no pre-registration,
44:59 - but just go to the sessions
you're interested in.
45:00 - We hope people will be understanding.
45:03 - As you can tell, we had
several overflow session rooms.
45:06 - We really tried to accommodate
as many people as possible.
45:11 - There was such demand for the conference.
45:13 - We're somewhat stretched to the limits.
45:14 - We're doing our best to handle it.
45:16 - We really wanted to try to
let as many people come,
45:18 - because it's great that so
many people are interested.
45:20 - It does mean we have a
large number of people.
45:23 - Some of the sessions might get filled up,
45:25 - so hopefully you'll be
patient and understanding.
45:28 - If a session's filled up,
there are a dozen other
45:30 - great sessions you can go to.
45:32 - There'll always be sessions at each
45:33 - of the slots in this room and
the auditorium across the hall
45:36 - and a large auditorium next door.
45:39 - They'll accommodate
large numbers of people,
45:41 - so there'll be some places you'll always
45:43 - be able to get into, so
hope you'll be understanding
45:45 - as you try to select among
sessions on Friday and Saturday.
45:49 - I mentioned something's next door,
45:51 - so I wanna say a few things.
45:52 - So before that, I do wanna
say, each of those time slots,
45:56 - we're also gonna have there about
45:57 - 13 or 14 schedules sessions, but also,
46:00 - a couple conferences-conferences sessions.
46:02 - On the wall right outside the hall,
46:04 - there's a whiteboard where you can decide
46:07 - to sign up for an un-conferenced session,
46:10 - sort of an impromptu session.
46:12 - On there, you can write it up, and I think
46:14 - if you see something similar,
46:16 - you can sort of write
your name next to it.
46:17 - So hopefully we can use this board
46:19 - where people sort of match up,
46:21 - find things going on and
they're with similar interests
46:24 - and lineup together around
these un-conferenced sessions.
46:27 - It's in two different rooms.
46:29 - Now I'll mention a
little about navigating,
46:32 - which in past conferences, it was almost
46:34 - everything was in this building,
46:36 - which is called E14 in MIT speak.
46:40 - But in order to accommodate
more people this time,
46:42 - we're also connecting, there's a building
46:45 - that's connected, the
original media lab building,
46:47 - which is E15, so workshops
and other sessions
46:51 - will be going on in both
of those two buildings.
46:55 - So the bottom row here is E15, sorry E14.
47:01 - The building we're in right now.
47:03 - To situate yourself, this is sixth floor,
47:05 - so as you go across, it
shows the different floors.
47:07 - So right now we're on the sixth floor
47:09 - and this is like conference central.
47:11 - So this is where all the meals will be,
47:13 - the lunches, the breakfast,
47:15 - the dinner on Friday night will be here,
47:17 - and some of the larger rooms
47:19 - for the sessions here on the sixth floor.
47:22 - There's also in this building
down at the third floor,
47:24 - it's one of the overflow rooms.
47:26 - If some of you are probably
watching this right now
47:28 - down at the third floor atrium.
47:29 - That's another large space
that we have for overflow
47:32 - and also some of the poster
sessions will be there.
47:34 - We also on the fifth floor
have the Scratch lounge,
47:36 - a place just to go hang out.
47:38 - It's also where the kiosk will be
47:39 - for sharing your Scratch
stories that Shampika mentioned.
47:43 - But then, you can see
scattered through the map,
47:46 - there are all sorts of other
rooms in both buildings.
47:48 - So if we try just to think
about how to navigate through,
47:51 - there's also the other building
and there's the arrows here.
47:55 - The two buildings are next to each other,
47:57 - but there are only two floors connected.
47:59 - The way I generally think about it,
48:02 - if you wanna get to something
in the other building,
48:04 - go to the third or the fourth floor,
48:06 - cut across the other building
48:08 - and that's the way to move between them.
48:10 - So if you wanna get from the sixth floor
48:13 - down to the other
building, you go down to,
48:17 - there's elevators and stairs,
48:19 - lots of different elevators and stairs,
48:20 - go down, cut across third or fourth floor,
48:22 - go to elevators and stairs
48:24 - in the other building and cut across.
48:26 - So, in the other building, in E15,
48:28 - here are the different
places to cut across.
48:31 - In E15, as Andrew mentioned,
the Scratch 3.0 studio
48:37 - is in the lower level
of the other building,
48:39 - just about as far
diagonally across from here,
48:42 - but you can't go diagonally.
48:44 - So you'll go across, across, and down
48:46 - into the lower level.
48:48 - Also, the lower level
of the other building
48:49 - is where the other poster session will be.
48:52 - So hopefully you'll be able to figure out
48:53 - how to navigate around.
48:54 - We also have some navigation cards.
48:57 - Outside this room, there are little cards
48:59 - that'll tell you how to get
49:01 - from the sixth floor of
this building right here
49:03 - to any of the other spaces.
49:05 - So if you're going
somewhere, pick up a card,
49:07 - follow the directions on how to get there.
49:09 - Again, a lot of these were done by,
49:11 - we have two great
organizers, Kate Shanahan
49:13 - and Kate Straus and our designer Trish
49:16 - who worked on a lot of these things
49:18 - to help people figure their way around.
49:20 - Also, as Andrew mentioned,
members of the Scratch team
49:23 - and some other volunteers
are wearing ask me buttons,
49:26 - so if you have trouble
finding your way around,
49:29 - have other questions,
just look for someone
49:32 - with an ask me button.
49:33 - You an also tweet #askScratchMIT
and we'll have somebody
49:37 - looking at that and
hopefully they'll be able
49:39 - to answer questions for you as well.
49:44 - There should be wifi through
all of the buildings.
49:46 - You don't need any password.
49:47 - Just the network is MIT
Guest, just go to MIT Guest.
49:51 - Shouldn't have any problems.
49:53 - If you do, ask people
at the desks out here.
49:59 - As you wanna tweet about the conference,
50:00 - many of you already discovered,
50:02 - I was told that last night the
#ScratchMIT2018 was trending.
50:06 - So a lot of people are
already tweeting about it,
50:08 - so we'd love people to share
things you're learning,
50:11 - photos you take, please share things.
50:13 - We'd all like to see it as a community
50:15 - to have a record of the conference.
50:17 - So please tweet from there and finally,
50:20 - I'd just like to thank, none
of this would be possible
50:24 - without many generous people
who've been supporting
50:26 - the Scratch project in general.
50:27 - In particular, for the
conference we've had
50:29 - a lot of great sponsors who
were supporting the work here.
50:32 - So I wanna thank all of them.
50:34 - So, with that, I'll also mention,
50:36 - in between all the sessions,
we've tried to leave
50:38 - a good amount of time for breaks,
50:40 - 'cause we do a good part of what people
50:41 - get out of conferences is just
interacting with one another,
50:45 - so there's half hour breaks
between all the sessions.
50:47 - So we'll move now to a half hour break.
50:49 - There'll be snacks outside.
50:51 - Think about what sessions you want.
50:52 - If there are sessions, you
should have the tickets
50:54 - for your morning workshops
and that will start
50:56 - in roughly half an hour at 11 o'clock.
50:59 - So, again, welcome
everybody to Scratch 2018.
51:02 - We really look forward to
working, to being together
51:04 - the next few days.
(cheering and applause)

Cleaned transcript:

(applause) So welcome to Scratch Conference 2018, it's really great to have so many people from so many places joining us here at the Media Lab. It's great to see a lot of long time friends who have been using and supporting Scratch for so many years. In some ways, the conference feels a little bit like a family reunion. You could see it last night with people just getting back together, hugging one another. At the same time, it's great seeing so many new faces and people joining, some of them just getting started with Scratch. I wanna welcome them to the Scratch family. I really look forward to the next three days to have the opportunity for all of us to be sharing ideas and exchanging stories and learning from one another. I really felt it last night at the reception, kick things off in a really special way. For me, it highlighted the diversity of the Scratch community. At the end of the evening, as I thought back about the conversations I had during the evening, I realized that I talked to people from more than 25 countries. I actually counted them. It was from Mexico to Brazil to Chile to France to Poland to Italy to Morocco to Nigeria, Kenya, China, Japan, Korea, all over the world and many more, so it's just really exciting to have people coming together. But it's not just a geographic diversity. Through those conversations, it was just great to see all the different ways that people around the world are using Scratch. I remember talking to one teacher from an all girls elementary school in Mexico and she was telling me about how in their class the second graders are creating interactive bracelets using Scratch to program microbits to flash hearts and other patterns. And I talked to a teacher from Austria who really has a deep commitment to supporting the culture of integrity and respect in his classroom, so he really engages his kids in using the Scratch online community, diving in and getting a different understanding of the opportunities and importance and also the challenges of building an inclusive and respectful community. And I talked to one retired teacher from Detroit here in the United States who actually had never used Scratch in her classroom, but after retiring, she learned Scratch from her granddaughter and they were working on Scratch projects throughout the whole day and translating them for relatives in Spain and in Italy and looking to see how she can start developing some professional development opportunities so she can share her enthusiasm with other teachers. So to me, it just is clear that there's a real incredible diverse and extraordinary collection of people here and I really can't wait to have more conversations over the next few days. As we started planning this conference, I realized that this conference is falling almost exactly 10 years after our very first Scratch conference. It was July 2426, 2008, almost to the day, 10 years ago, and through those 10 years, obviously, a lot has changed in those 10 years. At the first Scratch conference, we had about 200 people. This year we have about 600 people. We're bursting at the seams and we could have a lot more. As many of you know, we sold out a few months ahead of time. 10 years ago, at the first Scratch conference, there was about 150000 projects shared in the Scratch community and we thought that was a lot. Today, there's more than 37 million projects shared in the community and everyday there's about 30000 new projects, so every five days, there's as many projects shared as in the whole first year of Scratch. Also, 10 years ago, the focus was really just on Scratch, and today, there's all these different Scratch associated initiatives from Scratch Ed to ScratchJr to Scratch Day, and you have opportunities in the next few days to learn a lot more about all of those other initiatives. As we move forward with this, I think that even though some things have changed a lot in the last 10 years, there are a lot of things that have really stayed the same. Some things that haven't changed, important things that haven't changed are the goals and the motivations and the values that underlie our work on Scratch. From the very beginning, we saw Scratch as more than just a programming language. We saw it as a way to provide children around the world an opportunity to express themselves creatively and to develop those creative thinkers. We've taken seriously the idea of Scratch as a new type of literacy, so we really always are working hard and we want kids to be able to, we want to provide those opportunities to express their ideas and to organize their ideas and to share their ideas with others, just as they do when they're learning to write. And I think as we do that, we see that it's one of the most important ways that kids, that for all kids, need these new opportunities. It's not just for a limited number, but these types of capabilities of expressing, organizing, sharing ideas, are important for everyone, from all backgrounds, in all parts of the world. So we've had this deep commitment to make sure that Scratch is always accessible and appealing and empowering to all children in all places and in all backgrounds. Of course, as Scratch continues to grow and change and extend itself around the world, there's real challenges of how we can stay true to those values and to its mission. I think that's one of the big challenges ahead of us, to make sure that we stay true to it so that Scratch isn't just used to teach some particular concepts, as important they may be, but to provide the opportunities for children to develop their thinking and to develop their voice. And we know that's not easy to do. It's a lot easier to just spread the technology than to spread the ideas and the values. I think that's one reason I'm so excited about having all of us together for this Scratch conference. The conference provides us an opportunity to all of us to come together and to share ideas and to share stories of how children are creating and sharing with Scratch and strategies for supporting them. So, there'll be lots of opportunities over the next few days for all of you to be sharing ideas with one another, but maybe just to start, let's take just a couple minutes, we'll take two or three minutes just to talk to people around you, to introduce yourself, and just share what you're doing with Scratch and some of the things you're hoping to learn from the conference. So, we're gonna do that, just two, three minutes. So, I hope you were able to get started on conversations. There'll be lots more opportunities over the next few days to continue. As you know, the theme of this year's conference is the next generation and part of it, of what brings us together, is I think all of us have this deep commitment to supporting the next generation of children, to provide them with opportunities, to image, create, and share so that they can help shape the future. And I think if we really want to get an appreciation of how children are using Scratch to imagine, create, and share, it's best to hear from the children themselves, to hear their stories and their voices. So I'd like to share three stories of three Scratchers, three members of the Scratch community. And the first story comes from a Scratcher whose username is CoolJewels. And we first found out about CoolJewels when she responded to a prompt that was put up by Natalie Rusk in the Scratch community and now they posted a question to Scratchers saying why do you Scratch and asked them to post projects about why do they Scratch. And hundreds of kids posted projects explaining what brought them to Scratch. A graduate student in our group, Shruti Dhariwal, collected some of those stories into a lovely book called "Why Do Scratchers Scratch", so I'll be telling the story that Shruti captured from "Why Do Scratchers Scratch", and this is the project that CoolJewels had shared on the community and I'll share some screenshots that were then put in the book where CoolJewels talks about why she Scratches. And she says, "So, why do I Scratch? Scratch is something I can express myself with and share my creativity, ideas, inspirations, and art with. You can make anything here, from art to a game and so much more, the possibilities are endless. The whole community is amazing and you make so many friends here. Everybody here is so kind, creative, and accepting. To be really honest, I never thought I'd be into coding until I found Scratch. It was love first sight." (audience laughing) And I think CoolJewels is exactly the type of young person we were trying to attract as we created Scratch. As I read through CoolJewels' story, it made me think about some of the principles that we've had for guiding us as we've developed Scratch. We sometimes call them the four P's of creative learning, projects, passion, peers, and play. As I read CoolJewels' story, to me it seemed, her learning and her creative really were supported by projects, passion, peers, and play, that she was working on projects based on her passions in collaboration with peers in a playful spirit. I think that's what really helped her develop her ability to express herself creatively and to think creatively. And for me, I think this is a key as we all try to spread the spirit and the values of Scratch around the world. These four P's can serve as a guiding framework. We can all work to say how can we better support young people to work on projects based on their passions in collaboration with peers in a playful spirit? I'll go on to my second story, highlights a young person in the community whose Scratch username is Forever, and his real name is Jinho, and here's a video that was made, Champika Fernando and Eric Schilling, in our group worked on this video, highlighting some of the ways that Jinho has interacted in Scratch. I remember reading the news and thinking that I should do something about this, but I didn't know what I should do about it and then I listened to the song Hands. It featured different artists coming together and singing a song together and I thought, "Why couldn't we, as Scratchers, create something together?" (soft music) I have multianimator projects that we as Scratchers made together after the Orlando tragedy that happened to honor the people who died in the Orlando tragedy. This project is a multianimator project, which means that each part was animated by a different animator and we stitched it together to create the final product. I think around 40 or 50 people were involved making that project. Scratch is a really open place where you can share anything you want and you can express your feelings however you want and I think that's a really beautiful part of it. ("Hands" A Song for Orlando) And hopefully, the project when I share it with the community was to be able to reach out to some of the other people in this generation and know that there are people who support them and... (applause) If you look at the project, clearly you can see that Jinho and his colleagues that he worked with are developing lots of computational skills, also they're clearly being guided by those four P's of work on a project that was clearly based on passions, it is collaborative, multianimator project, working with peers and experimenting in new ways in a playful spirit. We look at this project, we also, to me, it brings to mind a fifth P, the P of purpose and I think this time, we see more and more of young people using Scratch to work on projects that they really wanna try to make a difference in the world, to see how they can work on things that really make a difference in their community, and this, I think we're thinking about more, in fact, at this session, the conference, about the fifth P of purpose. And also we wanna continue to think about adding purpose to the projects, passion, peers, and play. I'll tell my third and final story. And this is a story about a project by a Scratcher with the username ZeptoPower006 who's on the Autism spectrum and shared this project as a way of sharing some of his thoughts about his interactions in the world. So let me share the project with you. Hi, my name is Alex and this is my story. Some of my favorite hobbies are playing video games and drawing. I've been creating comics for a very long time. I'm very good at math and coding. I'm very funny, kind, and smart. I also have Autism. Autism affects me in many ways. It makes me think different. Sometimes in math I would solve problems in ways that even my teachers didn't think of. You think they'd know it, but no. (audience laughing) Sometimes, when I need to think, I pace. It helps me concentrate and it's called stemming. My teachers let me do this, because it helps me think. Autism makes me a very picky eater. I like crunchy foods and I don't like mushy foods, because they make me gag. The texture of the food bothers my senses. My senses are supercharged and sometimes, that makes me feel uncomfortable. Sometimes I get really overwhelmed by bad feelings and I just want people to be understanding and patient. It's okay to be different. However, some people don't treat different people very nicely. And there's just so much no with that decision. I wish people would treat different people completely normally. Being different makes the world more diverse. If everyone was the same, then the world would not be very interesting. (audience laughing) I think that the secret to a good life is to just you be you. Pick your own path and accept others for which path they choose. Be kind. That is my story. (applause) That was one of my favorite Scratch projects from the last few years, because to me, it really captured some of the essence of what we're trying to do, provide opportunities to everyone from all backgrounds to develop their voice and to share their ideas. And the way he says, "You be you." That's what we wanna do with Scratch. We want everyone to you be you. We know there are many different pathways that kids are gonna engage in the world and trying to make sure that everyone has an opportunity to be themselves and to find their own pathways to be able to live up to their full potential. So I think all of these projects from CoolJewels to Jinho Forever to ZeptoPower006, I think they sort of capture some of the spirit of Scratch. For those of us on the Scratch team here at MIT, as we look at projects like this, and of course there are millions of others like this on the website, I just chose these few examples, you would get lots of, we're always taken by surprise by the type of things kids do that we never imagined and we're always amazed and delighted and inspired by what it is the kids do. And we always try to take it into account as we think about extending and further developing Scratch, whether it's the software, the community, or the activities, trying to get inspiration from the members of the Scratch community. And that really brings us to another aspect of the theme of the next generation, as many of you know, we've been working on a next generation of Scratch itself that we call Scratch 3.0 and I think we've always been inspired by the community. We really want to make sure that we develop the next generation of Scratch that's worthy of the next generation of kids. So we've been working hard at it. There's a team here working on it. I hope you have a chance through the conference to meet some of the couple dozen of people that are working on Scratch here. But I'd like to sometime to give an update on some of the things we're working on in Scratch and invite three leaders of the team to come join me on the stage, Andrew Sliwinski, Natalie Rusk, and Champika Fernando. (cheering and applause) I think we'll start with Andrew who's been leading the team developing this next generation of Scratch, leading it to big design and engineering efforts. So Andrew'll give a bit of an update about some of the thinking that's gone into the work on Scratch 3.0 and the sneak peek of some of the things with it. Sure. So, thank you. So I think, as Mitch was just saying, when we look around the Scratch community, we see just such an incredible diversity of the things that kids are making and it's incredibly inspiring. And when we look at the kind of scale that we're reaching, over the last 12 months, both the online and offline versions of Scratch have been used by over 200 million kids. That's a whole heck of a lot of kids, but when we think about our mission, we're really thinking about, how do we make sure that all of these kids are reaching and being touched by the big, powerful ideas that underlie our work that Mitch was just talking about. And so, when we're thinking about the next generation of Scratch, I think the question for us was really, and the foundational goal for us was really, how do we make sure that we're reaching kids where they're at? How do we make sure that these opportunities are available for all children, everywhere, from all backgrounds? And so, a major way in which we do that is we use the creative learning spiral that some of you may have seen before where we hope that kids who are using Scratch are imagining, creating, playing, sharing, and reflecting as they're using Scratch, as they're doing these creative learning activities, but in the same way, that same process can be used to describe our process for how we develop Scratch, for how we build Scratch, for how we interact with children, see the way that they're using the types of tools that we're building for them and make it better, make it stronger, make sure that these powerful ideas are accessible to all. And so, when we think about the goals that we have for the next think of Scratch that we call Scratch 3.0, really the primary foundation really is this idea of reaching kids where they are. And there's a lot of different dimensions of that. There's everything from making sure that Scratch is easy enough to use, that it's intuitive, that it's easy to pick up and start to play with and start to have a creative tinkerable experience with, but it also talks about localization and accessibility and all of these different dimensions that are so important for us to fulfill our mission. So, when we look at Scratch 3.0 as it is today, we're really excited about the progress and really excited that, at the conference, there's gonna be lots of opportunities for you folks to take a look at this next generation of Scratch, and when you look at the coding area, right, so this is Scratch 3.0, it still kinda looks and feels like Scratch, but the team has done a lot of work to make a lot of these refinements, to make things simpler, to make it easier to kind of get started, to make it easier to really go from zero to hello world and then hello world to whoa, right? Like we wanna get kids to that moment of joy, that moment of seeing the possibilities in Scratch. And we've done a lot of work in the coding side of things, but we also know that Scratch is more than just a programming language. There's also a paint editor, which is incredibly important as you just saw in some of the projects that Mitch just showed, and the team's done a great job of refining a lot of the paint editor to make it easier to get started with, but also to make it a little bit more powerful so that kids can do the types of animations that they wanna do, and also to make some of the features of the paint editor that today are a little bit tricky to get working with, things like gradients, and try to make those more accessible, make those easier for all kids to use. Another place where we've spend a lot of time is sound. And the team really sort of took a step back and through doing a lot of workshops with kids, tried to look at how are kids using sound in Scratch? What are the opportunities for us to sort of transform sound from something that you just kind of grab from the library and add to your project, to something that you can paly with, something that you can tinker with, something that you can really have fun with? Make that a part of the medium as well. And another area where we spent a lot of time is the actual libraries themselves. So, in addition to adding a whole bunch of new sprites and sounds and backdrops to the library, we've also spent a lot of time making the libraries a little bit easier to use and introducing search into the libraries, which is something that we all know from our experience working with kids, that kids find it incredibly intuitive just to be able to search for what they're looking for. And on the library side, we were lucky enough to be able to partner with a large number of incredibly talented artists. Some of those artists are actually Scratchers, to produce new assets for the library. So now we're making sure that we have everything from food trucks to boom boxes to toucans to zebras, really making sure that we're going broad with the range of interests that kids bring to Scratch. And last but not least, I think one of the other parts that's really important about reaching kids where they are is making sure that we're on the platforms where kids are. So, Scratch 3.0 is the first version of Scratch that we've ever had that works on desktop devices, just as it does today, but it also works on touch devices, including Android and iOS tablets, as well as Chromebooks. (applause) And early next year, when we launch the full version of Scratch, this will be the first version of Scratch where you'll also be able to play Scratch projects on your phone. (cheering and applause) I think one of the other major pieces of Scratch 3.0 and one of the big, big goals for us has been expanding the possibilities of what Scratch can do. We know that so many kids love making games. They love making animations. They love making multiplayer projects. They love doing all these different things. They love making pen projects, you name it. But we also know that there's a lot more opportunity out there and we've seen through our testing and through working with kids, just how excited they can get when we connect Scratch to hardware, when we connect Scratch to the physical world, when we connect Scratch to things like speech, and so, we've spend a lot of time developing a new platform within Scratch 3.0 called extensions that really change the possibilities and expand what you can do with Scratch. So one of the first examples that I'm gonna show, and hopefully this all works, is we've been really excited about working with the microbit team on our integration with the microbit. And one of the things that I'm really excited to show you is kind of how that works, so let's build a little project here. So I'm gonna add the space backdrop and then I'm going to get rid of the cat. We're gonna replace the cat with a dog. Hopefully that's okay. So we're gonna search for dog and I get all the dogs. And now I have Dot and so down here, in the bottom left hand corner, this is the extensions library, so I'm gonna click on that, and then I'm gonna connect to the microbit. I'm gonna make sure that my microbit is powered on. It's gonna look for devices. I'm gonna connect it. Connected, and now that it's connected, what I can do is just start to really quickly build an interactive program. So I can connect the A button press (dog barking) to just playing the sound of bark. And I can make another little stack here and I'm gonna use another new feature, which is changing sound effects. So I can change the pitch effect and I can change that to the tilt angle of the microbit. And so now, if I start this stack we can go (dog barking) (high pitch dog barking) (laughing) (applause) And we can move our little puppy here and let's add a little bit more interactivity. We'll make Dot, the dog, the space dog, move and oh, we'll activate this and then we can go (high and low pitched dog barking) Very musical dog. And so, just using something as simple as that, we can go from zero to a playful experience really, really quickly and I think that's trying to deliver on both the simplicity of Scratch, but also expanding the possibilities of what kids can do, right? Using low cost hardware like the microbit, we really see a lot of potential. And the microbit is by no means the only hardware extension or software extension that we're working on. Microbit is one of many. So microbit's been a great partner for us, but we're also working with folks like Lego and Sphero and the Raspberry Pi folks are here, who we're also working on extending Scratch into the physical world with all of these different types of platforms. And then on the software side, there's also a bunch of really tremendous opportunities for us to extend Scratch to do things like speech recognition or text to speech or object detection, all sorts of different things that we're working on with different types of software partners like Amazon Web Services and Google, but that's by no means the end. This is just the beginning of what we're working on right now. And so, I guess if you frequently ask questions, that's kind of the next piece. One of the questions that I know that you folks are gonna ask me is when can you get access to this. I'm very happy to say you can get to it right now. So, the team pushed this live yesterday, so you can go to beta.scratch.mit.edu and use that during the conference. And there's going to be a whole bunch of different workshops and sections that'll be using this beta throughout the next couple days. The other big question is when will the full version launch, right? When will it be available in the community for all kids to use? And the answer for that is January 2nd, so right after the New Years. And one thing that you'll notice on here is the beta, we're actually not going to, you all are getting a special preview of it today, but the beta will actually become available for all kids on the Scratch community on August 1st, so next Wednesday. And we're really excited and the kids are also very excited. And I think, last but not least... And also, just to be clear, the beta, when it comes out, will be separate from the community, so they can still go to the current Scratch website to kind of just share things in the community and that'll be integrated into the community on January. Yep, on January 2nd, the Scratch 3.0 will become the sort of foundation for the community as well. And then last but not least is how can I learn more about Scratch 3.0 at the conference? So there's a lot of different opportunities. There's a whole range of different sessions. Today there's two workshops that many of you have signed up for that are now full, Scratch 3.0 workshops, but have no fear, there's lots of other opportunities as well. Tomorrow, there are gonna be multiple Scratch 3.0 studios happening in the cube with a whole bunch of different members of the Scratch 3.0 design and development team and resources team supporting that. And then in addition to that, on Saturday, we have a special session that's going to be a whole bunch of members of the actual team that built Scratch 3.0 on a panel together talking a little bit about the process, talking a little bit about the design, and answering questions that you might have. So if you wanna learn more about extensions or you have questions about how we built 3.0 or have questions about the process, that would be a great session for you. And then last but not least, I think the most important thing is to look for the orange ask me buttons that a lot of members of the team are all wearing. And if you have questions, if you see us during lunch or during dinner or any other time, feel free to ask us questions and we'd be happy to chat about it. Great, okay, thanks, Andrew. (applause) As we introduce Scratch 3.0, of course we wanna make sure that there are lots of ways to help kids and educators get started with Scratch, so we've put a lot of thought into how can we better support those introductory experiences and what resources and support materials can we provide to help support people who are just getting started? So, Natalie Rusk will talk about that. Natalie has been working on the Scratch project since day one, since before it even had the name Scratch, has led a lot of the efforts and learning research around Scratch and leading up the development of resources around Scratch. (applause) So our resource team, we now have a great Scratch learning resource team and our challenge is really, how do you design learning resources that spark that creative learning, those four P's, and some of the things that I wanna share with you and that we're gonna be interested in sharing with you throughout the conference are some of those ideas that we've been working on. And it's been inspired by some of you, have used the Scratch coding cards, so these cards, these were really developed with this idea that we're inspired by actually, Seymour Papert's idea that education has little to do with explanation and how do you dive in? He also talked about how using ideas comes before understanding them, so rather than explaining the concepts, how do you have something that right away, oh I wanna make this happen, I wanna make something jump around, how do I do that? On the back it has some coding and it shows you how do I do that and we've been doing it in different interest areas and a lot of these are inspired by projects that we see young people on the community making, like virtual pets. Okay, that's a topic that has sparked a lot of interest and ideas and thinking, so how do we make that available to more people through these Scratch coding cards that have been available. And now, thanks to a lot of you, translated into different languages. So, how do we bring that so that when someone opens up Scratch 3.0, they can have a similar experience of just diving in and starting to play? So yeah, we've also had these educator guides that help show how do you use those cards, so here in Scratch 3.0, you're gonna find a whole set of tutorials that have that idea of just diving in and getting started. I'm gonna show you in Scratch. So, in Scratch, you'll now find there's a button at the top that says tutorials. Let me get my cursor. There it is. So if you click on that, there's a little light bulb next to it. You'll get popping up choices, and these are just the beginning. We're gonna be expanding on it, but let's see for example, how do I change size of something? And if I look at that, I can play the video. With a change size block, you can make a sprite get bigger or smaller. (clicking) To keep going, you can use a repeat loop. Or type in a minus sign to get smaller and smaller. To reset size, you can use the set size block. 100 will get it back to the original size, or try a bigger or smaller number, depending on what you want. Choose your own sprite and try it out. So we're hoping that that will help, just a little short thing, but it gives you some sense of some idea and some concept to start playing around with with your own things. We also have in the tutorial window some of the more starter projects, like how would I get started on making something? So that's one thing I can start trying out, but how would I do something like making a game or animating my name or making music? So these also, you'll see if you play it, it has a video that shows you what are some possibilities that you could do and then you can see what are the steps and just right here in the editor, without going anywhere else, you can start following along. It just has enough, again, to hopefully spark interest, get ideas started, and then seeing how young people start remixing, using their own ideas and just building on these ideas. So we're looking forward to, again, at the Scratch studio, we'll be sharing those and talking about how you can just start exploring those at the beta of that Scratch. And just a really important mention, as I said, that these have been translated into other languages and right now, the current version of Scratch is translated thanks to a lot of you in the community, translated into more than 50 languages. Scratch 3 is getting there and a lot of you also have been working on that. We could really use more translators. And also more reviewers. If you speak a language, to see okay, is this making sense? And we especially need people like you who've tried out Scratch, who've used it with young people, what are the words that really make sense for localizing this? So this is both for the resources and for this, and to find out more about that and just to talk to us, we'd love to meet those of you who've been working on it or are interested in contributing. There's gonna be a poster today at 430 to 530 on the third floor. If you can't make it then, there's also an email. You can email our translation team at translate@scratch.mit.edu and let us know what you're interested in doing and we'll connect with you. Thanks. hanks, Natalie. (applause) And with all the things we're trying to do, even though the Scratch team here has been growing, we know we can't do things by ourselves, the same way we're reaching out to partner with others on translation, we're having a growing number of ways of collaborations, of partnerships, and that's one thing that Champika will talk about. Champika has contributed to the team in many different ways over the years. She actually was helping on the team that put out Scratch 2.0 and helped in the development of Scratch 2.0, went away for a while, was a student for awhile, came back, and is now heading up the efforts in outreach and communications. And she'll talk about some of the work we're doing in connecting with others around the world. Thanks. (applause) Alright, thanks, Mitch. So I'm gonna bring it full circle, back to community, what Mitch was talking about in the beginning. So just to reiterate, when we think about Scratch, when we talk about Scratch, it's not just the programming language and the editor, it's this massive global community, all of you who share our ideas and this commitment to the next generation of kids, the next generation of creators. And so I wanna take a moment and just highlight, you've heard some of the things that we're working on with Scratch 3.0, but I'm gonna take a moment and highlight some of the things you guys are doing in the community. Actually, I'll start with a few organizations that we've had the opportunity to work with to make suer that when Scratch 3 comes out, there's lots and lots of really great free resources available. So our friends at Harvard on the Scratch Ed team have been working to update their Creative Computing Curriculum Guide so that it's ready for Scratch 3.0 when it launches in January. Our friends over at Code Club, sponsored by the Raspberry Pi Foundation, are working on updating all of their tutorials and activities online so that all the code clubs around the world will have updated resources for Scratch 3.0 as well. CS First, our friends at Google, will be updating all of their video tutorials to make sure that those are ready. And we've been continuing to do our work with Cartoon Network to create some new tutorials around Scratch 3.0 using their characters, some of my favorites, the Powerpuff Girls. We feel really lucky to be working with some of these really amazing organizations, but we're actually even more inspired by the thousands of other folks, including many of you in the room, who are producing resources and materials for your local communities. And so actually, if you do do that, we would love to hear about the resources that you're creating. If you go to this link, bit.ly/scratchresourcesdevelopers, you can fill out a form and tell us about the resources you're developing and also join our resource developers mailing list so that we can keep you updated on sort of the development of Scratch 3.0 and how you can think about updating your resources and getting them ready for the launch. And so it's not just resources and activities that people are producing and sort of, that's not the only way people in the community are engaged. Some of you may have been to or even hosted your own Scratch day. These are activities that are hosted all around the world in homes, community centers, schools, offices, and they're organized, they're one day activities that bring together kids, parents, families, to create and share around Scratch. And the first one was actually hosted here at MIT and then in 2009, we put out resources for how to host your own, and since then, it's grown to be this global thing that's hosted all around the world. And actually this year, there's been already more than 1000 that have been hosted in more than 60 countries around the world. And of course, there's a Scratch conference, which is where you are right now, in case you didn't know. And that again, the first one was hosted, as Mitch said, here at MIT, with the idea of bringing together educators to share ideas and learn from one another. And each year, it's been hosted either here at MIT or elsewhere, there's been one Scratch conference. But last year, there were actually half a dozen Scratch conferences hosted all around the world led by people in the community. We found that really inspiring. At this year's Scratch conference, we actually got more than 400 proposals and it's just really inspiring to see all the different ways people are using Scratch in their local communities. You can' really read that schedule, but the schedule's out on the wall there and you'll have it in your booklet. We hope you'll check out a lot of the sessions and meet new people, share ideas, and take things away with you that you can use in your own communities. But even if you're not hosting a session at the Scratch conference this year, we wanna hear your stories and so, some of the folks on the team have come up with these prompts to help you think about sharing your story. And actually, find at lunch today these Scratch cards, these little cards with questions on them that help you think about how you can share your story. And there's a few different ways we want you to think about doing that. So at lunch, at your table, you can share, you can start a conversation with the person next to you at your table, talk about how you're using Scratch. You can also, we'll have a kiosk set up on the fifth floor where if you feel inspired you can go and record your story. And then, if you wanna tell the world, you can go on Twitter and share your story with the hashtag, #ScratchStories. So we hope that you'll share what you're working on. We'd love to learn from you and we hope that you'll share with one another. And again, I'll end on sort of saying, as we think about the future of Scratch and all the things with Scratch 3.0, we're really excited to think about how the community will grow along with us. Okay, thank you, Champika. (applause) So we're gonna wrap up with giving you a little bit of an overview and guide to the conference as we're getting started with the conference. I think to navigate the conference might require some little guidance. So one thing that was helpful, Champika mentioned in the back of your name tag, there is a guide, if you haven't seen already, that you can pull out that is your conference guide. In there, you'll see one thing is a quick overview, the conference in a glance. So I just wanted to say a few things about this. So you'll see Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and each day will be starting with a keynote session like this one, so we'll be in this hall to get started on Friday and Saturday with a keynote session, and then there'll be various parallel sessions, where you'll see the morning and afternoon sessions. There'll be more than a dozen things happening in parallel. Those sessions you'll be able to look at the listing also in the program, to choose different things to go to. As we do this, the three days are so much different. Today is a little different and then all of the sessions, the breakout sessions, are all workshops today. In the future days, there'll also be night talks and panel discussions. We thought it was great, in the spirit of Scratch, to get started with more hands on participatory sessions on day one, so there'll be 90minute sessions, one in the morning, one in the afternoon. These were ones that you were asked to register for ahead of time, so in your name tag, you should have tickets for the two sessions you registered for. If you didn't, you should be able to pick up some extra tickets at registration or just go to the tables right outside here if you don't have a ticket. But for today, you need to go to the sessions that are registered for. If you're not registered yet, pick up a ticket at the tables right outside the hall and go there. For the next couple days, for Friday and Saturday, the session's will be going in parallel and just be going around no preregistration, but just go to the sessions you're interested in. We hope people will be understanding. As you can tell, we had several overflow session rooms. We really tried to accommodate as many people as possible. There was such demand for the conference. We're somewhat stretched to the limits. We're doing our best to handle it. We really wanted to try to let as many people come, because it's great that so many people are interested. It does mean we have a large number of people. Some of the sessions might get filled up, so hopefully you'll be patient and understanding. If a session's filled up, there are a dozen other great sessions you can go to. There'll always be sessions at each of the slots in this room and the auditorium across the hall and a large auditorium next door. They'll accommodate large numbers of people, so there'll be some places you'll always be able to get into, so hope you'll be understanding as you try to select among sessions on Friday and Saturday. I mentioned something's next door, so I wanna say a few things. So before that, I do wanna say, each of those time slots, we're also gonna have there about 13 or 14 schedules sessions, but also, a couple conferencesconferences sessions. On the wall right outside the hall, there's a whiteboard where you can decide to sign up for an unconferenced session, sort of an impromptu session. On there, you can write it up, and I think if you see something similar, you can sort of write your name next to it. So hopefully we can use this board where people sort of match up, find things going on and they're with similar interests and lineup together around these unconferenced sessions. It's in two different rooms. Now I'll mention a little about navigating, which in past conferences, it was almost everything was in this building, which is called E14 in MIT speak. But in order to accommodate more people this time, we're also connecting, there's a building that's connected, the original media lab building, which is E15, so workshops and other sessions will be going on in both of those two buildings. So the bottom row here is E15, sorry E14. The building we're in right now. To situate yourself, this is sixth floor, so as you go across, it shows the different floors. So right now we're on the sixth floor and this is like conference central. So this is where all the meals will be, the lunches, the breakfast, the dinner on Friday night will be here, and some of the larger rooms for the sessions here on the sixth floor. There's also in this building down at the third floor, it's one of the overflow rooms. If some of you are probably watching this right now down at the third floor atrium. That's another large space that we have for overflow and also some of the poster sessions will be there. We also on the fifth floor have the Scratch lounge, a place just to go hang out. It's also where the kiosk will be for sharing your Scratch stories that Shampika mentioned. But then, you can see scattered through the map, there are all sorts of other rooms in both buildings. So if we try just to think about how to navigate through, there's also the other building and there's the arrows here. The two buildings are next to each other, but there are only two floors connected. The way I generally think about it, if you wanna get to something in the other building, go to the third or the fourth floor, cut across the other building and that's the way to move between them. So if you wanna get from the sixth floor down to the other building, you go down to, there's elevators and stairs, lots of different elevators and stairs, go down, cut across third or fourth floor, go to elevators and stairs in the other building and cut across. So, in the other building, in E15, here are the different places to cut across. In E15, as Andrew mentioned, the Scratch 3.0 studio is in the lower level of the other building, just about as far diagonally across from here, but you can't go diagonally. So you'll go across, across, and down into the lower level. Also, the lower level of the other building is where the other poster session will be. So hopefully you'll be able to figure out how to navigate around. We also have some navigation cards. Outside this room, there are little cards that'll tell you how to get from the sixth floor of this building right here to any of the other spaces. So if you're going somewhere, pick up a card, follow the directions on how to get there. Again, a lot of these were done by, we have two great organizers, Kate Shanahan and Kate Straus and our designer Trish who worked on a lot of these things to help people figure their way around. Also, as Andrew mentioned, members of the Scratch team and some other volunteers are wearing ask me buttons, so if you have trouble finding your way around, have other questions, just look for someone with an ask me button. You an also tweet #askScratchMIT and we'll have somebody looking at that and hopefully they'll be able to answer questions for you as well. There should be wifi through all of the buildings. You don't need any password. Just the network is MIT Guest, just go to MIT Guest. Shouldn't have any problems. If you do, ask people at the desks out here. As you wanna tweet about the conference, many of you already discovered, I was told that last night the #ScratchMIT2018 was trending. So a lot of people are already tweeting about it, so we'd love people to share things you're learning, photos you take, please share things. We'd all like to see it as a community to have a record of the conference. So please tweet from there and finally, I'd just like to thank, none of this would be possible without many generous people who've been supporting the Scratch project in general. In particular, for the conference we've had a lot of great sponsors who were supporting the work here. So I wanna thank all of them. So, with that, I'll also mention, in between all the sessions, we've tried to leave a good amount of time for breaks, 'cause we do a good part of what people get out of conferences is just interacting with one another, so there's half hour breaks between all the sessions. So we'll move now to a half hour break. There'll be snacks outside. Think about what sessions you want. If there are sessions, you should have the tickets for your morning workshops and that will start in roughly half an hour at 11 o'clock. So, again, welcome everybody to Scratch 2018. We really look forward to working, to being together the next few days. (cheering and applause)
