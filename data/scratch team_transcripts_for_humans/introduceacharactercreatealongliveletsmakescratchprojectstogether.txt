04:36 - is introduce a character uh maybe with
04:41 - all this time at home maybe you've been
04:44 - reading a lot of books
04:45 - maybe you've been watching a TV show
04:47 - that in love maybe there's just a
04:49 - character that you love from your
04:50 - childhood maybe you know you sewing that
04:51 - maybe those books or TV shows you've
04:53 - been watching there's a character that
04:55 - you just enjoy so much
04:56 - maybe you have an original character oh
04:59 - I know so we people who have original
05:02 - characters and I always love seeing them
05:03 - I am so excited to see all the original
05:06 - characters people have um or maybe um
05:09 - you're like I don't know what character
05:11 - I want to do and don't worry we will
05:13 - find a character for you but yes that's
05:17 - the idea for today is make any project
05:19 - about a character in some way um the all
05:24 - all there's a link and I'll go into this
05:27 - in a second but there's a link in the
05:29 - description too we have a starter
05:32 - project that can show you what like a
05:34 - character introduction could be like so
05:36 - we have this project that like
05:38 - introduces a character and has a little
05:42 - bit of info about them so that's you
05:45 - know one thing you can do you can use
05:46 - this project as a as a starting point
05:48 - I'll show you how to do that um but
05:51 - anyway and and you know sending in your
05:54 - questions to the link um yeah and enjoy
05:58 - it now welcome to the create along we're
06:01 - about to start making scratch projects
06:03 - together so what you're going to do to
06:08 - open scratch is go to scratch.mit.edu
06:16 - and I'll let me put up the link for
06:21 - where that you can go to do this um
06:25 - anyway go to scratch.mit.edu and click
06:28 - on create
06:29 - I'll keep this link up for a little
06:32 - while
06:32 - so that you can
06:35 - so that you can see it in case you're
06:36 - joining just now but I'll try to take it
06:38 - down soon and think last week I forgot
06:39 - to take the link down I'm gonna meant to
06:43 - but yes so scratch.mit.edu and click
06:47 - create and then once you're in here in
06:52 - scratch um you can close this tutorial
06:55 - it you can watch it if you want to but
06:56 - it shows you the basics of getting
06:58 - started but but this is a scratch in
07:01 - case you haven't seen it before I will
07:04 - give you just a little explanation Oh
07:06 - kind of the idea of scratch um so it's
07:11 - right you have these characters that are
07:14 - called sprites and over here you've got
07:17 - all these blocks of you know sort of
07:21 - code that you can drag out and then you
07:25 - can click on them to have the characters
07:26 - do the thing it says on the walk so you
07:30 - give this a click it says move ten steps
07:31 - and when I click it you know the cat
07:33 - moves ten steps and you know you can
07:37 - combine it with tons of other blocks if
07:39 - you have it move and then turn and have
07:42 - it just turn a lot spinning around you I
07:48 - don't know this one says go to random
07:49 - position you click that makes it go to
07:52 - somewhere around them um and you know
07:55 - you can you can make a character say
07:58 - something you drag out you know say
08:01 - hello and then go to a random position
08:04 - so that is a the idea of scratch is that
08:11 - you have characters and you can make
08:13 - them do stuff with the blocks over here
08:16 - ah so let's get started making projects
08:21 - about characters um you can just start
08:25 - making and if you'd like some ideas for
08:28 - how to begin on a project with a
08:31 - character I'll give you some ideas right
08:33 - now so let me make a new project and I
08:39 - think even before we jump in to you know
08:44 - how you make a project about a character
08:46 - it could be nice to think about what
08:48 - character you'd like to make a project
08:50 - about so I there's there's a favorite
08:55 - book character could be a character you
08:58 - do you could think if yeah one of your
09:00 - favorite TV shows like I said there's
09:02 - character that you just love you could
09:03 - make a project about them oh yeah if
09:06 - there's like a historical figure you
09:08 - love you can make a project about then
09:09 - if you're educator and you're studying
09:12 - uh you know some figure with your class
09:15 - you can make it right about that person
09:17 - um you could also um make i if i'm yeah
09:23 - as i mentioned you could do an original
09:25 - character of yours that would be so
09:27 - awesome to see
09:28 - and you also if you're stumped on idea
09:32 - for a character you're still nothing is
09:34 - coming to mind something I like to do is
09:37 - just hover over this choose a right
09:40 - button and just click surprise spray
09:45 - okay
09:46 - saxophone okay I want to see who will be
09:49 - playing this saxophone Oh Anna guitar
09:52 - okay they're gonna be a very musical
09:53 - character but so you can okay so yeah
09:56 - this character hannah has a guitar kind
10:00 - of want to keep choosing getting more
10:02 - that's a line that's maybe not that
10:05 - inspiring but um oh my gosh I got Andy
10:09 - again I got Andy last week um you know
10:12 - you can keep just doing surprise stuff
10:15 - until you get some idea for a character
10:19 - to do and I'm just getting lots of
10:21 - musical instruments and people and but
10:24 - so yeah maybe you've got like a fairy
10:26 - who plays the saxophone and then that's
10:28 - your that's your character who knows big
10:30 - I don't know what will come up for you
10:32 - but that that could be one way of just
10:33 - getting an idea of something random um
10:36 - but I don't think about what character
10:38 - I'll do first one of my favorite books
10:42 - is Matilda um and I I love Matilda so
10:47 - much of a character also the book but
10:49 - definitely the character um so maybe
10:51 - don't do a little something about her
10:53 - and the we have a tutorial that can help
10:58 - you get started and I'll show walk you
11:00 - through the first few steps of it with
11:02 - Matilda
11:02 - character um so if you go to the
11:06 - tutorials library click on that button
11:09 - that says tutorials you can go down and
11:13 - we have this tutorial called animate a
11:15 - character so let's open it up actually
11:19 - I'm going to make a new project with all
11:22 - these lovely people maybe not very
11:26 - Matilda's project um so when you click
11:30 - on the tutorial get this this video pops
11:33 - up I won't watch it right now because
11:35 - that would be like a video within a
11:36 - video but the video walks you through
11:39 - how you can animate a character and also
11:41 - you can click the next step and it'll
11:47 - show you a step towards making a
11:49 - character so this one says to add a
11:50 - backdrop so I'll hover over the choose a
11:53 - backdrop button and click Choose and
11:57 - Matilde spends a lot of time at school
12:00 - so and I think there is a school
12:02 - background okay yes okay
12:06 - I think it's school background would be
12:07 - a pretty a nice one for Matilda um and
12:11 - then it says you have to add a sprite
12:14 - okay now this I'll have I'll add this
12:16 - character to be Matilda see if I'm gonna
12:19 - see if I can find someone who looks sort
12:21 - of like Matilda and then that could be
12:23 - at least a nice starting point so I'll
12:26 - hover over choose a sprite button and
12:28 - click Choose new D I actually something
12:35 - okay something about the ballerina
12:37 - reminds me of Matilda I don't know
12:39 - really something about the energy about
12:41 - her uh I might change her dress from
12:43 - pink to like on dark blue cuz I feel
12:45 - like dark blue is more like Matilda's
12:47 - outfit color but I think that's a good
12:49 - like base to be Matilda um so then I'll
12:53 - like click to the next step and the and
12:58 - I'll show how I'll make her oh you know
13:01 - what and I should take off the create
13:02 - link now uh I probably should have done
13:06 - it a little bit earlier still gotta keep
13:07 - myself remembering about that um so okay
13:13 - so the first step and also
13:15 - think I will get rid of the scratch cat
13:18 - just click on it and click the trash
13:20 - icon you'll never forgotten I will see
13:23 - you in the next mute project i me so um
13:27 - trying to find place to put this is
13:29 - tutorial window um so i the first step
13:34 - if this animated character has me says
13:37 - you can drag out a when green flag
13:39 - clicked block which is yellow so i'll go
13:42 - to the events categories yellow one drag
13:45 - out that and then you know i also may
13:48 - change her name to Mathilde because that
13:50 - is who she is
13:51 - um and then then it says you can drag
13:56 - out uh say hello for two seconds block
13:58 - so I will go and grab that um also I
14:03 - will get to answering some questions
14:05 - from the from the questions but first
14:07 - I'm just gonna show how you can use the
14:09 - anime character tutorial a little bit
14:12 - since I think that could be a nice
14:13 - starting point um so okay so say hello
14:17 - for two seconds that seems like a fair
14:19 - thing for to do for introducing Matilda
14:21 - yes and also I can add on more things so
14:26 - I can ever say my name is seems good for
14:32 - introducing her and also you're like one
14:36 - of her character traits is that she
14:38 - loves reading so maybe I will have her
14:42 - then say like like I love reading could
14:47 - write out a longer version of that but I
14:49 - also don't to type that much yeah my
14:55 - name is Matilda I love reading yeah so
14:58 - this is just a way that you could use
15:00 - this tutorial to like just get started
15:03 - with making the character introducing
15:05 - them telling the world a little bit
15:07 - about them before I oh you know I just
15:12 - saw from the comments back the tutorial
15:17 - windows a little hard to see because of
15:19 - the UM because of the questions link so
15:21 - I'm gonna put the tutorial up seer yeah
15:25 - let me know that that's what the
15:27 - tutorial window showed is like how
15:28 - you say hello um thanks for sending in
15:31 - the questions and comments um yes and
15:35 - actually I'll get two more questions and
15:37 - comments in a second but I promised I
15:39 - would show you how to use this um this
15:42 - base this um introduce a character or
15:47 - like starter project we have so I'll
15:49 - show you how you could use that as like
15:52 - a base because that could be another way
15:53 - to get started with making a project
15:57 - about your character so and this link by
15:59 - the way is in the description of this
16:02 - YouTube video there's a link to this
16:04 - starter project so you can open that up
16:06 - and yeah I mean you can just click see
16:11 - inside and and so now you can sort of
16:17 - look at how this person did this project
16:19 - and you know you could go in oh and I
16:24 - just remembered that I also wanted to
16:25 - show how to change the color of
16:27 - Matilda's dress and then show that
16:28 - insight um yeah you could go in and
16:31 - instead of this person's character you
16:33 - could choose a costume and add your
16:39 - character takes it a moment when you are
16:42 - also live streaming but you know
16:44 - whatever your character might be you can
16:48 - add admin do a my yeah you could add
16:55 - your character in and then that would be
16:57 - the it's not what I meant
17:00 - pic but yeah like this is a good one um
17:07 - so yeah you could put your character
17:08 - there if your character is Amina dance
17:11 - um and then that that's how like this
17:15 - something this could be about your
17:16 - character you could also go click on
17:18 - this sprite that has a text description
17:20 - and then change what the text is so you
17:24 - know favorite color maybe instead of any
17:25 - kind of green it's her favorite words
17:31 - probably not
17:31 - uh so favorite word is dance so anyway
17:37 - that's that's a one way that it's like
17:40 - super
17:41 - to start making a project about a
17:43 - character that I just want to show you I
17:45 - also said I would show you how to change
17:48 - Matilda's dress color I'm going to
17:49 - shrink this tutorial window um so yeah
17:53 - because I think that uh one it's nice
17:56 - when you can find a sprite in the
18:00 - library that's sort of it gets the idea
18:02 - of your character and then you can just
18:03 - change them a little bit to UM to both
18:07 - your character a bit more so instead of
18:09 - this blue color for her dress you pick
18:11 - out a saree exceda the pink color I can
18:14 - pick out up something in the blue range
18:16 - and then maybe darken it a bit by having
18:18 - a brightness feel lower and then yeah
18:21 - click on this fill bucket tool and then
18:24 - yeah I feel like that
18:26 - suddenly is more like a school uniform
18:28 - and you know just to complete it all all
18:32 - you know change the color of her maybe
18:36 - make her tights like kind of gray or
18:38 - something like that goes in and yeah now
18:43 - suddenly that's like I pervy that's
18:45 - totally Matilda um yeah all right uh now
18:49 - I wanted to get to some questions that
18:51 - were coming in Oh someone says can we
18:56 - make a character from a book any
18:58 - character absolutely any character it
19:01 - could be a character from a book but it
19:03 - could be you know truly any character
19:06 - one you came up with you could make a
19:09 - character by just drawing random
19:10 - squiggles in the costumes tab and you
19:14 - know go like that's something I'll do
19:16 - sometimes you put if you hover over the
19:19 - choose a sprite button and click think
19:20 - and I'll show a few more ways of drawing
19:22 - a character probably later in this dream
19:24 - but you know you could just draw
19:28 - something totally random I don't know
19:31 - that's a circle that's a face and then
19:35 - you can have like eyes with some more
19:39 - circles I change the color and then get
19:43 - the paintbrush and like and I just
19:46 - created this character and I already
19:47 - love it and I want to know his story
19:51 - name
19:54 - smile we very very creative name it's
20:01 - actually a family name
20:02 - um but yeah anyway truly any character
20:06 - um oh okay
20:09 - can we make a character who loves pizza
20:11 - bagels and speaks Morse code it's a very
20:14 - important question and the answer is yes
20:15 - you can do that I I'm glad I'm glad uh
20:18 - that you know we uh we got sort of an
20:22 - out you can make a character who loves
20:25 - pizza bagels and speaks Morse code Oh
20:29 - someone asks how do you delete a
20:33 - character um uh well I can't bring
20:36 - myself to delete smiley so I'm not gonna
20:38 - show on smiley because I I they're too
20:41 - wonderful
20:42 - but um I'll show you no new link so
20:48 - going to scratch.mit.edu slash create um
20:51 - and if you have oh gosh I should this is
20:57 - gonna take a long time to load but I
20:58 - couldn't delete smiley um
21:01 - actually wait I have a better idea okay
21:04 - so say I so the way to delete a
21:06 - character is you can click on this trash
21:08 - icon
21:09 - you should once key so you select them
21:11 - and then click on the trash icon so say
21:13 - I say that I wanted to delete smiley I
21:15 - could click on them and then click the
21:18 - trash so that's how you would do beep
21:20 - but I want smiley back and this is how
21:25 - you can do that say I'm like oh no wait
21:27 - I don't want to delete smiley you can go
21:29 - up to edit and click restore sprite and
21:32 - that will bring your character back if
21:34 - you accidentally deleted someone that
21:36 - you did not want to delete um yes thank
21:39 - you for the questions Oh someone else
21:41 - asks a flower asks can a person be
21:44 - ourselves yes I think they totally can
21:47 - be yourself that would be awesome I
21:48 - think that the only important thing is
21:50 - to just not include any personal
21:52 - information like your name um or
21:55 - anything don't put a picture of yourself
21:57 - but I think as long as you know it's a
22:00 - drawing of yourself or a representation
22:02 - of yourself then that is totally fine i
22:05 - think that's one
22:06 - oh thanks for the question Oh Oh another
22:10 - question someone asks can we animate it
22:13 - yes totally I think that would be
22:15 - awesome
22:16 - uh in fact uh maybe all showed how you
22:20 - can animate a character um let me make a
22:23 - new project
22:28 - actually I've made a new one here didn't
22:30 - I yes I did
22:31 - haha um so all all another there are
22:39 - technically two characters but I can
22:40 - kind of gonna count them as one another
22:42 - favorite characters of mine is Fred and
22:45 - George so I think I want to show a I'll
22:49 - show this with Fred and George um I'm
22:51 - gonna see if I can find someone people
22:54 - category I think this could be a pretty
22:58 - good Fred and George character it might
23:01 - be a hair a little tiny bit more orange
23:07 - bucket pick out an orange nice okay yes
23:20 - that's gonna duplicate them and this
23:25 - would be George this one red so one way
23:33 - to animate character is you can oh you
23:36 - know what I'm gonna change their hair
23:38 - color in the many costumes that they
23:41 - have cuz this character has many poses
23:44 - and I'm gonna change them okay there we
23:50 - go now they're all orange um so one way
23:55 - of animating a character if it happens
23:57 - to have multiple costumes and you can is
24:00 - and you can click on this block to see
24:02 - if the character does have multiple
24:03 - costumes is with this next costume block
24:07 - so you could you can click on that you
24:10 - can also have that happen inside of a
24:13 - loop so you could have now Fred change
24:16 - costumes many times look okay that was
24:19 - very fast
24:20 - needed going to the next costume many
24:22 - times but I think I will slow that down
24:25 - [Music]
24:26 - maybe like wait putting a week block and
24:30 - have it wait point five seconds so yeah
24:32 - anyway um now this character has poses
24:36 - built in but say uh it was a character
24:39 - that didn't have opposed built in uh you
24:43 - could take your first pose and uh and
24:47 - you could duplicate it and then try and
24:53 - sort of move the the points around or
24:57 - let move the parts of the sprite around
25:00 - so maybe I can take this arm and move it
25:04 - oh oh no it's not quite an arm under
25:07 - there so that is one thing about some of
25:09 - the scrap sprites and scratches they
25:10 - don't all you don't are also easy to
25:13 - animate um but the you can uh you can
25:18 - experiment around see if you can make
25:20 - different poses oh boy that's not great
25:23 - um but you can also like draw your own
25:28 - character so I could draw my own fret
25:30 - and then uh do pick out some kind of the
25:37 - color for the head of Fred and get a
25:42 - color for the UM hair could be a sort of
25:49 - very oval based Fred and do the circle I
25:55 - really like just making characters out
25:56 - of circles um
25:58 - do all make some eyes actually taller
26:05 - eyes there's one there's two going to
26:11 - make mouth and you can then duplicate
26:18 - this costume because once you draw
26:21 - yourself are probably gonna be easier to
26:23 - animate than ones from the scratch
26:24 - library as as you can see sometimes it
26:27 - depends based on sprite but then you can
26:30 - go in and like
26:31 - for instance with this this tool which
26:33 - lets you hit the points of a shape you
26:35 - can make in this one mate he and be like
26:37 - smiling and then you can animate between
26:41 - these two and that's like way to make a
26:43 - character be talking so that's just some
26:46 - ideas of how to animate a character oh I
26:50 - just saw that there are more questions
26:52 - coming in oh okay
26:54 - someone asks how do you create a
26:57 - character from a PNG file it's a great
27:00 - question I will show you um so let's say
27:04 - let me Oh No well it wasn't that I want
27:08 - to go to scratch alright let's say you
27:10 - find an image of your character online
27:13 - that can be a great thing to do if there
27:16 - isn't a scratch sprite that reminds you
27:17 - of them or if you don't feel like
27:19 - drawing or whatever it might be um and
27:21 - so one character I really love also is
27:25 - there's a book I read when I was younger
27:27 - called amazing grace where named
27:29 - character is increased or she plays
27:30 - Peter Pan in her school play
27:32 - he's such a good book she's one of my
27:37 - favorite characters of all time so if I
27:39 - go to Google Images and look up a
27:42 - picture of her oh here she is
27:44 - okay yes um there's her playing Peter
27:47 - Pan um I can go and find a you know some
27:52 - image your purse um um a JPEG or PNG
27:55 - image and then I can right click on it
27:58 - and save it my computer I want to show
28:03 - this so that you can see a howl howl um
28:07 - uh what's your getting a character so
28:10 - you can show it as you can see an image
28:12 - to have so I added I saved to my
28:16 - computer this picture of grace and then
28:19 - so how to make a new project for her a
28:22 - different from this wonderful friend
28:25 - George project um I'll show you how you
28:32 - can upload that JPEG or PNG into your
28:36 - project it'll just take a moment for my
28:39 - computer is truly truly laboring
28:47 - okay so so how you can bring in a PNG or
28:52 - a JPEG these hover over this choose a
28:56 - sprite button and what you do is you go
29:00 - up to the top option which is upload
29:02 - sprite and then you can click on that
29:04 - and and click on the image that I loaded
29:14 - that I that I downloaded and then you've
29:18 - got the character in the project uh I
29:21 - will once again delete the scratchpad
29:24 - cat by clicking on it clicking delete um
29:26 - so yeah so now you have this character
29:30 - in there so in case you missed that to
29:32 - get an image from the internet or from
29:34 - your computer into your project as your
29:36 - character you just hover over this
29:39 - choose a sprite button and go all the
29:41 - way up to upload and click upload and
29:43 - then you'll be able to pick a file from
29:45 - your computer that's a great question
29:50 - someone raincloud asks can you use the
29:54 - text-to-speech or mathilde yes totally
29:57 - oh that's a great question um for those
29:59 - of you which one is my Matilda project
30:01 - uh yes sir she is okay uh smiley maybe
30:05 - will hide he'll be sort of a secret
30:07 - surprise in this project um so for those
30:10 - of you that don't know on the
30:12 - text-to-speech blocks that you can add
30:15 - to scratch um are are um really good for
30:20 - making a character say something out
30:21 - loud and so let me go to to to add the
30:28 - text-to-speech blocks go to UM this
30:32 - square button down here which is add an
30:35 - extension and you click on it the
30:38 - extensions that we have to scratch which
30:40 - are things you can but even more blocks
30:42 - train Adam to scratch will show up and
30:45 - so this is this one text-to-speech uh I
30:48 - had kinda thought of showing I use this
30:50 - one but this is such a good fit for this
30:53 - project Thank You brain cloud I love
30:55 - this idea
30:57 - you click the added text to speech by
31:00 - clicking this button and now these new
31:02 - box show up so make sure that this sound
31:06 - will play on you can drag out one of
31:11 - these blocks and click on it whatever
31:14 - you write here the character will say
31:16 - hello
31:17 - hope you all could hear that um so you
31:20 - know here you can how the characters say
31:21 - my name is Mathilda
31:24 - my name is Mathilda and my teacher is
31:33 - Miss my teacher is Miss Honey and you
31:39 - know so anyways you can have the
31:40 - character say whatever you want to in
31:43 - there and so you you can also set the
31:49 - voice to something different in here
31:52 - this is the voice Alto but you can set
31:54 - it to Turner you could say um let's see
31:58 - like I can move things with my mind I
32:03 - can move things with my mind
32:06 - maybe that voice doesn't fit right over
32:07 - that well but there's also the voice
32:09 - squeak you try I can they're staying
32:11 - right in my mind so anyway that's the
32:13 - text-to-speech blocks that's some of
32:15 - what they can do a great way of
32:17 - introducing a character um yeah and you
32:19 - can also set the language that you want
32:22 - them to be speaking in so if you set the
32:24 - language to do to Spanish and then if
32:29 - you write words in Spanish it will read
32:31 - them actually in Spanish so you can have
32:33 - them say oh I was yeah oops trying to do
32:42 - the upside-down exclamation point oh
32:43 - yeah yeah so then the character says
32:46 - hola and they'll say it in Spanish so
32:48 - you can set the language and have them
32:49 - speaking whatever language you want um
32:52 - yeah so great question um let's see okay
32:57 - oh and I wanted to remember I wanted to
32:59 - mention something about using images for
33:02 - your that you can put in your project
33:05 - one good thing to remember is that oh
33:07 - it's always important to give credit
33:09 - for the images so if I were going to
33:11 - share this project I would put in the
33:13 - notes and credits um you know Oh like I
33:16 - got this image from and I find whatever
33:18 - the source was that I you know it's got
33:20 - it from Google Images wherever I got it
33:22 - so or if it's image but you know found
33:25 - by an artist online to give credit so
33:27 - just wanted to mention that um okay more
33:31 - questions uh someone asks what if you do
33:35 - meet some code thanks in advance Robert
33:38 - in advance um if you delete some code uh
33:41 - what you can do let's say I'll make some
33:44 - code I'll have a grace say when green
33:50 - flag clicked I'll have her say my name
33:53 - is Grace Oh didn't mean to switch the
34:01 - view there oh that's um so however say
34:06 - my name is Grace and then let's say I
34:08 - accidentally delete this code by
34:10 - dragging it over there uh what you can
34:13 - do is hit command Z I will bring it back
34:16 - so command-z or control-z um that will
34:21 - there's like the undo key that you would
34:22 - use um we'll bring back the code and I
34:26 - think you can do that until you've
34:28 - exited out of the project um you should
34:31 - be able to undo and get the code back um
34:33 - so yes that's a really good question
34:36 - um someone asks um there's so many good
34:41 - questions which border which oh okay
34:45 - okay someone asks I am trying to rotate
34:48 - sprite around a circle but when I use
34:51 - the rotate block it doesn't rotate
34:53 - around the circle it rotates around the
34:55 - middle how could I fix this I am going
34:59 - to I think I know what you mean
35:01 - so let me I'm just gonna get a sprite to
35:06 - show it with um so here's say the the
35:14 - let me make sure I really have then it
35:17 - can you understand the question so try
35:19 - to rotate a spray
35:20 - around a circle it doesn't retire
35:22 - outraged okay yeah so if I understand
35:26 - right you have a sprite say to the Apple
35:28 - um and I'll actually group all this by
35:32 - selecting it all on clicking group so
35:34 - you have a sprite and you want it to
35:36 - rotate around like this but instead it's
35:40 - rotating around uh like this so you can
35:45 - see in scratch where the center of the
35:48 - costume is and that's like this little
35:51 - like cross hairs right here so what you
35:55 - can do is if so during your the spray is
35:59 - going to rotate around this this point
36:03 - in the in the costume then this point
36:06 - right here so by default it's rotating
36:08 - around like this but if you put your
36:12 - sprite outs here then it will it will
36:16 - still be rotating around at this point
36:17 - and so then it'll rotate out here in the
36:19 - circle so now if I'm on the Apple and I
36:22 - click uh turn fifteen degrees it will
36:26 - rotate out in this big circle and in the
36:29 - opposite direction if what you want is
36:31 - for it to rotate around its middle then
36:33 - you can drag it to this sort of center
36:36 - mark and then uh this will rotate around
36:40 - there I hope that answered your question
36:42 - if it didn't sound good number oh um oh
36:45 - my gosh these questions are also
36:47 - wonderful um okay uh someone asks um how
36:52 - do you make it so your character will
36:54 - wait till you press space to say
36:56 - something great question on I will I'll
37:00 - show you maybe on a grace so so let's
37:05 - say that I want her to say this my name
37:06 - is Grace but I don't want to say it when
37:08 - the green flag is clicked I want her to
37:10 - say it when the space key is pressed so
37:12 - there's a couple of options um if I want
37:15 - her to say it every time that someone
37:18 - presses the space key then I can drag
37:20 - out this when space key pressed block
37:23 - and then attach it to that and now I
37:27 - guess you'll be able to see this but I
37:28 - have pressing space key now she says my
37:31 - name is Grace every
37:32 - that I press the space key so that's one
37:35 - way the when space key press block is
37:37 - great for that now on the other hand you
37:41 - might want her to only say it the first
37:43 - time you click the space key and there's
37:46 - an easy way to do that too so in in the
37:51 - control category there's this helpful
37:53 - block wait until and wait until will
37:58 - wait until some certain thing happens
38:01 - and then it will go and do this the
38:04 - block next to it those are lock under it
38:07 - so if I say wait until blank I haven't
38:10 - filled in this blank yet but once that
38:13 - blank thing happens then it will
38:15 - progress and start doing this so have
38:17 - them say my name is Grace um but let me
38:21 - so what what how do I put in something
38:25 - to fill this blank you see this blank
38:26 - has these angles and block that has
38:29 - these angles will go in there it's any
38:33 - block where the answer to that block is
38:35 - like a yes or no so you know for
38:38 - instance like no touching mouse pointer
38:41 - question mark that's either gonna be a
38:43 - yes or a no for any sprite so if it's if
38:46 - the if the character is touching the
38:49 - mouse pointer it will start doing the
38:51 - next thing but if it isn't it'll keep
38:52 - waiting and as you'll see this is key
38:56 - space pressed block um say like a
39:00 - question um it also has these angles on
39:03 - it so it can go in here and so now when
39:08 - I click the green flag you can see with
39:11 - this yellow highlight that this code is
39:13 - happening and it it still hasn't gotten
39:16 - to this save awk so it's still on this
39:18 - wait until it's still waiting until I
39:21 - press the space key and so then when I
39:22 - do and I am gonna do it there we go
39:27 - it says she says my name is Grace um but
39:31 - now if I do it again she won't say it
39:35 - again because as you can see it's it's
39:37 - not this highlight is gone it's done
39:39 - with this block it's not going to it's
39:43 - not going to
39:45 - keep waiting for me to press again I did
39:47 - it once so it's like okay I'm done
39:49 - um anyway so that's a wonderful question
39:54 - I love this wait until block it can be
39:57 - useful for so many things
39:59 - um anyway yes so thank you for asking
40:02 - that someone asks can we introduce two
40:09 - characters for example two brothers
40:11 - totally uh actually I guess I kind of
40:14 - did that you asked us before but um yeah
40:18 - you can totally have two brothers you
40:21 - could make two characters talk to each
40:23 - other uh actually maybe I'll show you
40:25 - how to do that really quickly
40:27 - um so I'll click on friend and I have oh
40:34 - that's like okay wait so this one is
40:37 - gonna be Fred and this one is gonna be
40:39 - George it's a little confusing because
40:40 - they're twins um I'll have Fred strike a
40:43 - different pose I'll pick this pose for
40:46 - Fred um so so I'll get rid of this um
40:51 - one way you can make two characters talk
40:53 - to each other is you got this you can
40:56 - have when dreams likely so when the when
40:59 - the project starts with someone starts
41:03 - the project um you can have one of them
41:06 - say something so uh Fred could say hi
41:10 - I'm Fred and then it's a red we'll do
41:16 - that when this starts and then you can
41:19 - click on the other character and have a
41:20 - jour also how this also happen when the
41:23 - green flag is clicked we have George
41:26 - also say something so let's see if this
41:28 - works also have George say and I'm
41:32 - George uh so now the other thing is that
41:39 - they talk at the same time because when
41:41 - I click the green flag a friend is
41:43 - saying hi I'm Fred and George is saying
41:45 - hi I'm George they both start right then
41:47 - so you could use a wait block to make
41:50 - George talk after Fred and
41:53 - Fred talks for two seconds so Jorge all
41:57 - also having wait two seconds and then
42:00 - save and then introduce himself hi I'm
42:03 - Fred and I'm George um awesome oh my
42:07 - gosh it is so awesome I just saw that a
42:08 - lot of new people are joining the stream
42:10 - Oh welcome everyone it's so great to
42:13 - have you in case you are doing just now
42:15 - uh this is the scratch create along
42:18 - where we make scratch projects together
42:21 - for an hour in a week and all I've given
42:25 - up prompt which is to make a project
42:27 - introducing a character so I've shown a
42:30 - couple ways you could get started with
42:31 - that you could you can make a project
42:34 - introducing a couple of characters you
42:36 - could make I made this project
42:37 - introducing Matilda from the book
42:39 - Matilda there's this project introducing
42:41 - they character briefs from amazing grace
42:43 - so you can make a project about any
42:47 - character from a book or a TV show or
42:49 - one of your original characters which I
42:51 - know so many people have I any any
42:54 - character you want make up a character
42:56 - for this totally random character um and
42:59 - we are we're we got probably we got 17
43:02 - minutes left so you don't have to finish
43:05 - your project in this time but rather you
43:07 - think of this time as a time when you
43:08 - could start the project and then
43:09 - throughout the week you can keep you can
43:12 - share the project to a studio because
43:14 - you have a studio where everyone can
43:16 - submit the prior it not submit but you
43:19 - can just add the projects you make
43:20 - everyone mad projects to that studio um
43:23 - in fact at the end of the stream I will
43:26 - show you how you can add to the studio
43:28 - because I saw there was a question where
43:29 - someone asks um how to share this
43:32 - project and I will show you at the end
43:35 - of the of the stream how you can share
43:37 - um so yeah anyway excited to have new
43:40 - people join me um okay uh oh oh great
43:45 - question someone asked um how to have a
43:47 - person move and say a thing at the same
43:49 - time from Hayden okay that's a great
43:52 - question thank you asking it so let me I
43:56 - can show you on grace again um I'll have
44:00 - her not wait until the space key press
44:03 - to start talking so
44:05 - for those joining just now now I have
44:07 - this project where when I click the
44:09 - green flag
44:10 - my character grace says my name is Grace
44:12 - and a way to make a character do two
44:16 - things at the same time is so I have
44:19 - this walk that the when green flag
44:21 - clicked that and this thing will start
44:23 - happening when the green flag is clicked
44:25 - but I can have another one I can have
44:27 - two blocks that book the start uh when
44:29 - the green flag is clicked actually I can
44:32 - have as many as I want so also when the
44:35 - green flag is clicked I could have let's
44:39 - see what else could I have great stood I
44:40 - could have her glide to a random
44:43 - position so just like wide somewhere on
44:46 - the screen so this is gonna happen and
44:48 - this is gonna happen at the same time so
44:51 - I click the green fly she does the both
44:54 - at the same time I thought gliding
44:55 - somewhere could be kind of nice because
44:56 - like she could fly anywhere she wants to
44:59 - um so yes so I correctly replied both of
45:02 - these things happen at the same time um
45:04 - in fact that can be so earlier in the
45:07 - stream I showed how to use the
45:10 - text-to-speech blocks to make a
45:12 - character talk aloud and that can be I'm
45:17 - gonna get clean up this is my Mathilda
45:21 - project I'm gonna clean up these blocks
45:23 - a little bit um I'm the she's gonna
45:27 - clean it up
45:29 - so the text-to-speech blocks can be a
45:33 - great thing to have that the the sticks
45:36 - of speech where they really speak block
45:37 - you can have that happen at the same
45:40 - time as they're saying it in a speech
45:41 - bubble because with these purple like
45:44 - say hello blocks the character said that
45:48 - in a speech bubble but with this speak
45:50 - into this green speak block if I say
45:52 - hello hello oh I still have the language
45:57 - set to English sorry to Spanish so I'm
45:59 - gonna set the language back to English
46:01 - um hello so I click on that and the
46:06 - character says aloud hello
46:07 - um so uh you that say I want those two
46:12 - things to have at the same time I can do
46:13 - the same thing where I have to when
46:15 - green flag clicked blocks drag them out
46:18 - and then I don't think I'll close this
46:20 - tutorials window um hello so then it's
46:25 - really nice effect when you click the
46:27 - green flag the character says it in
46:29 - trouble and also says it out loud it can
46:32 - be nice because sometimes it's actually
46:33 - kind of hard to hear what they're saying
46:36 - with the text-to-speech if you don't see
46:38 - it usually also so anyway that's just a
46:40 - tip but I wanted to share oh okay Oh
46:43 - someone asks um how can I make my
46:46 - letters move side to side this is a
46:48 - great question um let me make a new
46:52 - project and add a letter oh and you know
46:54 - what I see that it is now 147 this time
46:58 - passes so fast uh with you all the
47:01 - stream will last actually just saw a
47:02 - question come in of when how long will a
47:03 - stream last it will last until 2 p.m. by
47:06 - thinking about 3 to 5 minutes I'm gonna
47:09 - start showing how you could make an
47:11 - account if you don't have an account and
47:13 - also how you could share to the studio
47:15 - but I'm gonna try to answer a couple of
47:18 - a couple of less questions before that
47:21 - so for instance this question of um uh
47:24 - and also you don't have the link you're
47:27 - just doing now go to scratch.mit.edu
47:30 - slash create and then you can uh that's
47:34 - that's that's where you can make a
47:36 - project like this one it'll open up this
47:38 - page um so so how to make letters move
47:45 - around so uh actually first let me just
47:48 - show how you could get a letter sprite
47:49 - so you can hover over that choose a
47:53 - sprite button and click Choose and
47:55 - actually up here we have this letters
47:57 - category um
47:59 - so say you know that I was doing project
48:04 - about Matilda so I'll use an M um so you
48:07 - have now this letter sprite and there's
48:09 - a couple of ways of making a lair move
48:11 - from side to side um you can have it uh
48:15 - move ten steps that'll make it move in
48:19 - whatever direction it's pointing and it
48:21 - starts pointing this direction so you
48:23 - haven't letter move like that maybe you
48:26 - want it to start out over here so if you
48:29 - drag
48:31 - sprite anywhere this block go to a
48:35 - position in this position which is X&Y
48:38 - tells you the position of a sprite um
48:40 - this box will update with the position
48:44 - that that sprite is so if I drag it to
48:46 - them here the position is negative 11
48:50 - and 6 but if I drag it to here it
48:53 - changes to that so I can drag it to
48:57 - where I want it to start and then drag
49:00 - out this go to block and the sprite will
49:03 - start there and then you could have it
49:06 - once it starts there but move many times
49:11 - moved like that you can have it then
49:14 - this will reset it back to there you can
49:16 - also have it instead of having to click
49:18 - this move block over and over again you
49:20 - can have this repeat loop around the
49:22 - move block and then attach that there
49:25 - and then it moves like that yeah that's
49:28 - just one way you can also have you can
49:32 - use the the change X by ten block makes
49:36 - the sprite move it also be the my prime
49:39 - move side-to-side
49:39 - so there's lots of different ways of
49:42 - doing it um and then also if you want it
49:44 - to go back
49:45 - you could one thing I can do is I can
49:47 - right click on these blocks and
49:49 - duplicate them and then I can attach it
49:54 - down here and I could make it change X
49:58 - by putting a mind I prefer minus sign
50:00 - and then it will go in the opposite
50:02 - direction so it will go it will start
50:06 - there and then go back there so anyway
50:08 - that's some ways of moving letters side
50:10 - to side um and I saw another question
50:13 - that I'll try to answer before before I
50:17 - um before I have to start wrapping up um
50:20 - someone asks how do I take a picture of
50:23 - my dog to add as a sprite and love that
50:25 - um so you can go to the copy action
50:31 - theory ellamy you can hover over choose
50:33 - a sprite and click paint to create a new
50:37 - sprite and then
50:40 - oh sure once you've painted in news when
50:42 - you clicked paints to make a new sprite
50:44 - you can hover over this button and go to
50:47 - here and click camera and then I'll give
50:51 - it permission to use my camera um and
50:54 - then you probably see me twice uh and so
50:58 - you can take a photo with your camera
50:59 - and I you shouldn't take a photo of
51:02 - yourself so I make to take a photo of my
51:05 - lamp and have that be my dog hover over
51:15 - that and click camera okay my lamp is
51:19 - gonna be my dog yeah very good
51:24 - um and um and so then you have this
51:32 - photo and now that can be your spray and
51:35 - just pretend the instead of my lamp and
51:36 - my chair it was your dog which is
51:39 - possibly much cuter so and then you know
51:43 - you can do all the you know drag out all
51:45 - these code blocks and have them apply to
51:48 - your picture of your dog or lamp and see
51:51 - if you have it spin around or whatever
51:53 - you want so anyway I love that question
51:54 - I'd love to see figures or people's dog
51:56 - oh it looks like we have eight minutes
52:00 - left so I think in case you don't have
52:03 - an account I will show you how you can

Cleaned transcript:

are we are we alive I think that we are live hello everybody it is so great to have you all wait a minute or two before starting just to let people come in in case people are still joining now but welcome to this episode of the scratch create along if this is your first time joining welcome I'm so happy you're here if you were here last week welcome back it's great to have you again last week was so much fun and I am so excited that we are doing this again yeah if this is your first time joining let me tell you a little bit about what the create belong is in the create belong I we thought it would be nice if the we had a time an hour in the week where we all scratched community got to make projects together with a project idea that will share with you all and then everyone can make a project with that prompt or with that project idea um if you're a caregiver or a parent this could be something that you do with the scratcher or scratchers in your house if you're an educator this could be an activity that maybe gives you an idea for an activity to do with your students we actually saw a couple of educators saying that last week that was so exciting so happy to hear that um but if you're anyone this is just a time to make a scratch project we'll all be together uh and yeah uh that's the guy that's the idea um let me uh show you what the plan for today's live stream is so we're gathering now um I will we'll take a look at last week's projects uh for last week's theme which was I'll create an animated animated greeting card people made all these projects it was amazing so we'll take a look at those in the studio um then right after that I will share with you what the prompt is for this week and then we will have a lot of time to just create together um everyone you know you can all be making scratch projects you can have this YouTube window open is when you YouTube open in one window I have your scratch project open another be working on that during that project creation time if you have questions or comments you can send them to me at this link uh bit dot ly / create a log and I'll keep that out the whole time so yeah send in your questions I'll be answering questions that come in you can ask for an idea for a project or for help doing a certain thing or just let me know how the streak is going uh so yeah and then at the end you will have I will show you how to share your project if you want to uh so yeah that is the plan for today and uh so speaking of looking at last week's projects let's take a look at the projects from last week these were so wonderful with the prompt uh make a greeting card people just made there's so many positive messages they're like you know may all be well have a nice day got this stay at home lots of good messages around you know what to do in these times you know about staying safe a lot of people say me missed each other birthday so cute uh you know people saying they're thinking of each other you're awesome uh you know so many words for their dad this has lots of random kind messages I dished this is so wonderful to see all of these you like you all added so much positivity to the world you know cards for people it's just michype go in and look at every project right now but that would probably take up the whole stream time but I will always look at the projects on my scratch account afterward because it is so fun to see all the different directions people take the prompts so everyone who joined will ask me this was just amazing um yeah and speaking of this week's that speaking of prompts uh let me share with you this week's prompt uh so the prompt for this create along is introduce a character uh maybe with all this time at home maybe you've been reading a lot of books maybe you've been watching a TV show that in love maybe there's just a character that you love from your childhood maybe you know you sewing that maybe those books or TV shows you've been watching there's a character that you just enjoy so much maybe you have an original character oh I know so we people who have original characters and I always love seeing them I am so excited to see all the original characters people have um or maybe um you're like I don't know what character I want to do and don't worry we will find a character for you but yes that's the idea for today is make any project about a character in some way um the all all there's a link and I'll go into this in a second but there's a link in the description too we have a starter project that can show you what like a character introduction could be like so we have this project that like introduces a character and has a little bit of info about them so that's you know one thing you can do you can use this project as a as a starting point I'll show you how to do that um but anyway and and you know sending in your questions to the link um yeah and enjoy it now welcome to the create along we're about to start making scratch projects together so what you're going to do to open scratch is go to scratch.mit.edu and I'll let me put up the link for where that you can go to do this um anyway go to scratch.mit.edu and click on create I'll keep this link up for a little while so that you can so that you can see it in case you're joining just now but I'll try to take it down soon and think last week I forgot to take the link down I'm gonna meant to but yes so scratch.mit.edu and click create and then once you're in here in scratch um you can close this tutorial it you can watch it if you want to but it shows you the basics of getting started but but this is a scratch in case you haven't seen it before I will give you just a little explanation Oh kind of the idea of scratch um so it's right you have these characters that are called sprites and over here you've got all these blocks of you know sort of code that you can drag out and then you can click on them to have the characters do the thing it says on the walk so you give this a click it says move ten steps and when I click it you know the cat moves ten steps and you know you can combine it with tons of other blocks if you have it move and then turn and have it just turn a lot spinning around you I don't know this one says go to random position you click that makes it go to somewhere around them um and you know you can you can make a character say something you drag out you know say hello and then go to a random position so that is a the idea of scratch is that you have characters and you can make them do stuff with the blocks over here ah so let's get started making projects about characters um you can just start making and if you'd like some ideas for how to begin on a project with a character I'll give you some ideas right now so let me make a new project and I think even before we jump in to you know how you make a project about a character it could be nice to think about what character you'd like to make a project about so I there's there's a favorite book character could be a character you do you could think if yeah one of your favorite TV shows like I said there's character that you just love you could make a project about them oh yeah if there's like a historical figure you love you can make a project about then if you're educator and you're studying uh you know some figure with your class you can make it right about that person um you could also um make i if i'm yeah as i mentioned you could do an original character of yours that would be so awesome to see and you also if you're stumped on idea for a character you're still nothing is coming to mind something I like to do is just hover over this choose a right button and just click surprise spray okay saxophone okay I want to see who will be playing this saxophone Oh Anna guitar okay they're gonna be a very musical character but so you can okay so yeah this character hannah has a guitar kind of want to keep choosing getting more that's a line that's maybe not that inspiring but um oh my gosh I got Andy again I got Andy last week um you know you can keep just doing surprise stuff until you get some idea for a character to do and I'm just getting lots of musical instruments and people and but so yeah maybe you've got like a fairy who plays the saxophone and then that's your that's your character who knows big I don't know what will come up for you but that that could be one way of just getting an idea of something random um but I don't think about what character I'll do first one of my favorite books is Matilda um and I I love Matilda so much of a character also the book but definitely the character um so maybe don't do a little something about her and the we have a tutorial that can help you get started and I'll show walk you through the first few steps of it with Matilda character um so if you go to the tutorials library click on that button that says tutorials you can go down and we have this tutorial called animate a character so let's open it up actually I'm going to make a new project with all these lovely people maybe not very Matilda's project um so when you click on the tutorial get this this video pops up I won't watch it right now because that would be like a video within a video but the video walks you through how you can animate a character and also you can click the next step and it'll show you a step towards making a character so this one says to add a backdrop so I'll hover over the choose a backdrop button and click Choose and Matilde spends a lot of time at school so and I think there is a school background okay yes okay I think it's school background would be a pretty a nice one for Matilda um and then it says you have to add a sprite okay now this I'll have I'll add this character to be Matilda see if I'm gonna see if I can find someone who looks sort of like Matilda and then that could be at least a nice starting point so I'll hover over choose a sprite button and click Choose new D I actually something okay something about the ballerina reminds me of Matilda I don't know really something about the energy about her uh I might change her dress from pink to like on dark blue cuz I feel like dark blue is more like Matilda's outfit color but I think that's a good like base to be Matilda um so then I'll like click to the next step and the and I'll show how I'll make her oh you know what and I should take off the create link now uh I probably should have done it a little bit earlier still gotta keep myself remembering about that um so okay so the first step and also think I will get rid of the scratch cat just click on it and click the trash icon you'll never forgotten I will see you in the next mute project i me so um trying to find place to put this is tutorial window um so i the first step if this animated character has me says you can drag out a when green flag clicked block which is yellow so i'll go to the events categories yellow one drag out that and then you know i also may change her name to Mathilde because that is who she is um and then then it says you can drag out uh say hello for two seconds block so I will go and grab that um also I will get to answering some questions from the from the questions but first I'm just gonna show how you can use the anime character tutorial a little bit since I think that could be a nice starting point um so okay so say hello for two seconds that seems like a fair thing for to do for introducing Matilda yes and also I can add on more things so I can ever say my name is seems good for introducing her and also you're like one of her character traits is that she loves reading so maybe I will have her then say like like I love reading could write out a longer version of that but I also don't to type that much yeah my name is Matilda I love reading yeah so this is just a way that you could use this tutorial to like just get started with making the character introducing them telling the world a little bit about them before I oh you know I just saw from the comments back the tutorial windows a little hard to see because of the UM because of the questions link so I'm gonna put the tutorial up seer yeah let me know that that's what the tutorial window showed is like how you say hello um thanks for sending in the questions and comments um yes and actually I'll get two more questions and comments in a second but I promised I would show you how to use this um this base this um introduce a character or like starter project we have so I'll show you how you could use that as like a base because that could be another way to get started with making a project about your character so and this link by the way is in the description of this YouTube video there's a link to this starter project so you can open that up and yeah I mean you can just click see inside and and so now you can sort of look at how this person did this project and you know you could go in oh and I just remembered that I also wanted to show how to change the color of Matilda's dress and then show that insight um yeah you could go in and instead of this person's character you could choose a costume and add your character takes it a moment when you are also live streaming but you know whatever your character might be you can add admin do a my yeah you could add your character in and then that would be the it's not what I meant pic but yeah like this is a good one um so yeah you could put your character there if your character is Amina dance um and then that that's how like this something this could be about your character you could also go click on this sprite that has a text description and then change what the text is so you know favorite color maybe instead of any kind of green it's her favorite words probably not uh so favorite word is dance so anyway that's that's a one way that it's like super to start making a project about a character that I just want to show you I also said I would show you how to change Matilda's dress color I'm going to shrink this tutorial window um so yeah because I think that uh one it's nice when you can find a sprite in the library that's sort of it gets the idea of your character and then you can just change them a little bit to UM to both your character a bit more so instead of this blue color for her dress you pick out a saree exceda the pink color I can pick out up something in the blue range and then maybe darken it a bit by having a brightness feel lower and then yeah click on this fill bucket tool and then yeah I feel like that suddenly is more like a school uniform and you know just to complete it all all you know change the color of her maybe make her tights like kind of gray or something like that goes in and yeah now suddenly that's like I pervy that's totally Matilda um yeah all right uh now I wanted to get to some questions that were coming in Oh someone says can we make a character from a book any character absolutely any character it could be a character from a book but it could be you know truly any character one you came up with you could make a character by just drawing random squiggles in the costumes tab and you know go like that's something I'll do sometimes you put if you hover over the choose a sprite button and click think and I'll show a few more ways of drawing a character probably later in this dream but you know you could just draw something totally random I don't know that's a circle that's a face and then you can have like eyes with some more circles I change the color and then get the paintbrush and like and I just created this character and I already love it and I want to know his story name smile we very very creative name it's actually a family name um but yeah anyway truly any character um oh okay can we make a character who loves pizza bagels and speaks Morse code it's a very important question and the answer is yes you can do that I I'm glad I'm glad uh that you know we uh we got sort of an out you can make a character who loves pizza bagels and speaks Morse code Oh someone asks how do you delete a character um uh well I can't bring myself to delete smiley so I'm not gonna show on smiley because I I they're too wonderful but um I'll show you no new link so going to scratch.mit.edu slash create um and if you have oh gosh I should this is gonna take a long time to load but I couldn't delete smiley um actually wait I have a better idea okay so say I so the way to delete a character is you can click on this trash icon you should once key so you select them and then click on the trash icon so say I say that I wanted to delete smiley I could click on them and then click the trash so that's how you would do beep but I want smiley back and this is how you can do that say I'm like oh no wait I don't want to delete smiley you can go up to edit and click restore sprite and that will bring your character back if you accidentally deleted someone that you did not want to delete um yes thank you for the questions Oh someone else asks a flower asks can a person be ourselves yes I think they totally can be yourself that would be awesome I think that the only important thing is to just not include any personal information like your name um or anything don't put a picture of yourself but I think as long as you know it's a drawing of yourself or a representation of yourself then that is totally fine i think that's one oh thanks for the question Oh Oh another question someone asks can we animate it yes totally I think that would be awesome uh in fact uh maybe all showed how you can animate a character um let me make a new project actually I've made a new one here didn't I yes I did haha um so all all another there are technically two characters but I can kind of gonna count them as one another favorite characters of mine is Fred and George so I think I want to show a I'll show this with Fred and George um I'm gonna see if I can find someone people category I think this could be a pretty good Fred and George character it might be a hair a little tiny bit more orange bucket pick out an orange nice okay yes that's gonna duplicate them and this would be George this one red so one way to animate character is you can oh you know what I'm gonna change their hair color in the many costumes that they have cuz this character has many poses and I'm gonna change them okay there we go now they're all orange um so one way of animating a character if it happens to have multiple costumes and you can is and you can click on this block to see if the character does have multiple costumes is with this next costume block so you could you can click on that you can also have that happen inside of a loop so you could have now Fred change costumes many times look okay that was very fast needed going to the next costume many times but I think I will slow that down maybe like wait putting a week block and have it wait point five seconds so yeah anyway um now this character has poses built in but say uh it was a character that didn't have opposed built in uh you could take your first pose and uh and you could duplicate it and then try and sort of move the the points around or let move the parts of the sprite around so maybe I can take this arm and move it oh oh no it's not quite an arm under there so that is one thing about some of the scrap sprites and scratches they don't all you don't are also easy to animate um but the you can uh you can experiment around see if you can make different poses oh boy that's not great um but you can also like draw your own character so I could draw my own fret and then uh do pick out some kind of the color for the head of Fred and get a color for the UM hair could be a sort of very oval based Fred and do the circle I really like just making characters out of circles um do all make some eyes actually taller eyes there's one there's two going to make mouth and you can then duplicate this costume because once you draw yourself are probably gonna be easier to animate than ones from the scratch library as as you can see sometimes it depends based on sprite but then you can go in and like for instance with this this tool which lets you hit the points of a shape you can make in this one mate he and be like smiling and then you can animate between these two and that's like way to make a character be talking so that's just some ideas of how to animate a character oh I just saw that there are more questions coming in oh okay someone asks how do you create a character from a PNG file it's a great question I will show you um so let's say let me Oh No well it wasn't that I want to go to scratch alright let's say you find an image of your character online that can be a great thing to do if there isn't a scratch sprite that reminds you of them or if you don't feel like drawing or whatever it might be um and so one character I really love also is there's a book I read when I was younger called amazing grace where named character is increased or she plays Peter Pan in her school play he's such a good book she's one of my favorite characters of all time so if I go to Google Images and look up a picture of her oh here she is okay yes um there's her playing Peter Pan um I can go and find a you know some image your purse um um a JPEG or PNG image and then I can right click on it and save it my computer I want to show this so that you can see a howl howl um uh what's your getting a character so you can show it as you can see an image to have so I added I saved to my computer this picture of grace and then so how to make a new project for her a different from this wonderful friend George project um I'll show you how you can upload that JPEG or PNG into your project it'll just take a moment for my computer is truly truly laboring okay so so how you can bring in a PNG or a JPEG these hover over this choose a sprite button and what you do is you go up to the top option which is upload sprite and then you can click on that and and click on the image that I loaded that I that I downloaded and then you've got the character in the project uh I will once again delete the scratchpad cat by clicking on it clicking delete um so yeah so now you have this character in there so in case you missed that to get an image from the internet or from your computer into your project as your character you just hover over this choose a sprite button and go all the way up to upload and click upload and then you'll be able to pick a file from your computer that's a great question someone raincloud asks can you use the texttospeech or mathilde yes totally oh that's a great question um for those of you which one is my Matilda project uh yes sir she is okay uh smiley maybe will hide he'll be sort of a secret surprise in this project um so for those of you that don't know on the texttospeech blocks that you can add to scratch um are are um really good for making a character say something out loud and so let me go to to to add the texttospeech blocks go to UM this square button down here which is add an extension and you click on it the extensions that we have to scratch which are things you can but even more blocks train Adam to scratch will show up and so this is this one texttospeech uh I had kinda thought of showing I use this one but this is such a good fit for this project Thank You brain cloud I love this idea you click the added text to speech by clicking this button and now these new box show up so make sure that this sound will play on you can drag out one of these blocks and click on it whatever you write here the character will say hello hope you all could hear that um so you know here you can how the characters say my name is Mathilda my name is Mathilda and my teacher is Miss my teacher is Miss Honey and you know so anyways you can have the character say whatever you want to in there and so you you can also set the voice to something different in here this is the voice Alto but you can set it to Turner you could say um let's see like I can move things with my mind I can move things with my mind maybe that voice doesn't fit right over that well but there's also the voice squeak you try I can they're staying right in my mind so anyway that's the texttospeech blocks that's some of what they can do a great way of introducing a character um yeah and you can also set the language that you want them to be speaking in so if you set the language to do to Spanish and then if you write words in Spanish it will read them actually in Spanish so you can have them say oh I was yeah oops trying to do the upsidedown exclamation point oh yeah yeah so then the character says hola and they'll say it in Spanish so you can set the language and have them speaking whatever language you want um yeah so great question um let's see okay oh and I wanted to remember I wanted to mention something about using images for your that you can put in your project one good thing to remember is that oh it's always important to give credit for the images so if I were going to share this project I would put in the notes and credits um you know Oh like I got this image from and I find whatever the source was that I you know it's got it from Google Images wherever I got it so or if it's image but you know found by an artist online to give credit so just wanted to mention that um okay more questions uh someone asks what if you do meet some code thanks in advance Robert in advance um if you delete some code uh what you can do let's say I'll make some code I'll have a grace say when green flag clicked I'll have her say my name is Grace Oh didn't mean to switch the view there oh that's um so however say my name is Grace and then let's say I accidentally delete this code by dragging it over there uh what you can do is hit command Z I will bring it back so commandz or controlz um that will there's like the undo key that you would use um we'll bring back the code and I think you can do that until you've exited out of the project um you should be able to undo and get the code back um so yes that's a really good question um someone asks um there's so many good questions which border which oh okay okay someone asks I am trying to rotate sprite around a circle but when I use the rotate block it doesn't rotate around the circle it rotates around the middle how could I fix this I am going to I think I know what you mean so let me I'm just gonna get a sprite to show it with um so here's say the the let me make sure I really have then it can you understand the question so try to rotate a spray around a circle it doesn't retire outraged okay yeah so if I understand right you have a sprite say to the Apple um and I'll actually group all this by selecting it all on clicking group so you have a sprite and you want it to rotate around like this but instead it's rotating around uh like this so you can see in scratch where the center of the costume is and that's like this little like cross hairs right here so what you can do is if so during your the spray is going to rotate around this this point in the in the costume then this point right here so by default it's rotating around like this but if you put your sprite outs here then it will it will still be rotating around at this point and so then it'll rotate out here in the circle so now if I'm on the Apple and I click uh turn fifteen degrees it will rotate out in this big circle and in the opposite direction if what you want is for it to rotate around its middle then you can drag it to this sort of center mark and then uh this will rotate around there I hope that answered your question if it didn't sound good number oh um oh my gosh these questions are also wonderful um okay uh someone asks um how do you make it so your character will wait till you press space to say something great question on I will I'll show you maybe on a grace so so let's say that I want her to say this my name is Grace but I don't want to say it when the green flag is clicked I want her to say it when the space key is pressed so there's a couple of options um if I want her to say it every time that someone presses the space key then I can drag out this when space key pressed block and then attach it to that and now I guess you'll be able to see this but I have pressing space key now she says my name is Grace every that I press the space key so that's one way the when space key press block is great for that now on the other hand you might want her to only say it the first time you click the space key and there's an easy way to do that too so in in the control category there's this helpful block wait until and wait until will wait until some certain thing happens and then it will go and do this the block next to it those are lock under it so if I say wait until blank I haven't filled in this blank yet but once that blank thing happens then it will progress and start doing this so have them say my name is Grace um but let me so what what how do I put in something to fill this blank you see this blank has these angles and block that has these angles will go in there it's any block where the answer to that block is like a yes or no so you know for instance like no touching mouse pointer question mark that's either gonna be a yes or a no for any sprite so if it's if the if the character is touching the mouse pointer it will start doing the next thing but if it isn't it'll keep waiting and as you'll see this is key space pressed block um say like a question um it also has these angles on it so it can go in here and so now when I click the green flag you can see with this yellow highlight that this code is happening and it it still hasn't gotten to this save awk so it's still on this wait until it's still waiting until I press the space key and so then when I do and I am gonna do it there we go it says she says my name is Grace um but now if I do it again she won't say it again because as you can see it's it's not this highlight is gone it's done with this block it's not going to it's not going to keep waiting for me to press again I did it once so it's like okay I'm done um anyway so that's a wonderful question I love this wait until block it can be useful for so many things um anyway yes so thank you for asking that someone asks can we introduce two characters for example two brothers totally uh actually I guess I kind of did that you asked us before but um yeah you can totally have two brothers you could make two characters talk to each other uh actually maybe I'll show you how to do that really quickly um so I'll click on friend and I have oh that's like okay wait so this one is gonna be Fred and this one is gonna be George it's a little confusing because they're twins um I'll have Fred strike a different pose I'll pick this pose for Fred um so so I'll get rid of this um one way you can make two characters talk to each other is you got this you can have when dreams likely so when the when the project starts with someone starts the project um you can have one of them say something so uh Fred could say hi I'm Fred and then it's a red we'll do that when this starts and then you can click on the other character and have a jour also how this also happen when the green flag is clicked we have George also say something so let's see if this works also have George say and I'm George uh so now the other thing is that they talk at the same time because when I click the green flag a friend is saying hi I'm Fred and George is saying hi I'm George they both start right then so you could use a wait block to make George talk after Fred and Fred talks for two seconds so Jorge all also having wait two seconds and then save and then introduce himself hi I'm Fred and I'm George um awesome oh my gosh it is so awesome I just saw that a lot of new people are joining the stream Oh welcome everyone it's so great to have you in case you are doing just now uh this is the scratch create along where we make scratch projects together for an hour in a week and all I've given up prompt which is to make a project introducing a character so I've shown a couple ways you could get started with that you could you can make a project introducing a couple of characters you could make I made this project introducing Matilda from the book Matilda there's this project introducing they character briefs from amazing grace so you can make a project about any character from a book or a TV show or one of your original characters which I know so many people have I any any character you want make up a character for this totally random character um and we are we're we got probably we got 17 minutes left so you don't have to finish your project in this time but rather you think of this time as a time when you could start the project and then throughout the week you can keep you can share the project to a studio because you have a studio where everyone can submit the prior it not submit but you can just add the projects you make everyone mad projects to that studio um in fact at the end of the stream I will show you how you can add to the studio because I saw there was a question where someone asks um how to share this project and I will show you at the end of the of the stream how you can share um so yeah anyway excited to have new people join me um okay uh oh oh great question someone asked um how to have a person move and say a thing at the same time from Hayden okay that's a great question thank you asking it so let me I can show you on grace again um I'll have her not wait until the space key press to start talking so for those joining just now now I have this project where when I click the green flag my character grace says my name is Grace and a way to make a character do two things at the same time is so I have this walk that the when green flag clicked that and this thing will start happening when the green flag is clicked but I can have another one I can have two blocks that book the start uh when the green flag is clicked actually I can have as many as I want so also when the green flag is clicked I could have let's see what else could I have great stood I could have her glide to a random position so just like wide somewhere on the screen so this is gonna happen and this is gonna happen at the same time so I click the green fly she does the both at the same time I thought gliding somewhere could be kind of nice because like she could fly anywhere she wants to um so yes so I correctly replied both of these things happen at the same time um in fact that can be so earlier in the stream I showed how to use the texttospeech blocks to make a character talk aloud and that can be I'm gonna get clean up this is my Mathilda project I'm gonna clean up these blocks a little bit um I'm the she's gonna clean it up so the texttospeech blocks can be a great thing to have that the the sticks of speech where they really speak block you can have that happen at the same time as they're saying it in a speech bubble because with these purple like say hello blocks the character said that in a speech bubble but with this speak into this green speak block if I say hello hello oh I still have the language set to English sorry to Spanish so I'm gonna set the language back to English um hello so I click on that and the character says aloud hello um so uh you that say I want those two things to have at the same time I can do the same thing where I have to when green flag clicked blocks drag them out and then I don't think I'll close this tutorials window um hello so then it's really nice effect when you click the green flag the character says it in trouble and also says it out loud it can be nice because sometimes it's actually kind of hard to hear what they're saying with the texttospeech if you don't see it usually also so anyway that's just a tip but I wanted to share oh okay Oh someone asks um how can I make my letters move side to side this is a great question um let me make a new project and add a letter oh and you know what I see that it is now 147 this time passes so fast uh with you all the stream will last actually just saw a question come in of when how long will a stream last it will last until 2 p.m. by thinking about 3 to 5 minutes I'm gonna start showing how you could make an account if you don't have an account and also how you could share to the studio but I'm gonna try to answer a couple of a couple of less questions before that so for instance this question of um uh and also you don't have the link you're just doing now go to scratch.mit.edu slash create and then you can uh that's that's that's where you can make a project like this one it'll open up this page um so so how to make letters move around so uh actually first let me just show how you could get a letter sprite so you can hover over that choose a sprite button and click Choose and actually up here we have this letters category um so say you know that I was doing project about Matilda so I'll use an M um so you have now this letter sprite and there's a couple of ways of making a lair move from side to side um you can have it uh move ten steps that'll make it move in whatever direction it's pointing and it starts pointing this direction so you haven't letter move like that maybe you want it to start out over here so if you drag sprite anywhere this block go to a position in this position which is X&Y tells you the position of a sprite um this box will update with the position that that sprite is so if I drag it to them here the position is negative 11 and 6 but if I drag it to here it changes to that so I can drag it to where I want it to start and then drag out this go to block and the sprite will start there and then you could have it once it starts there but move many times moved like that you can have it then this will reset it back to there you can also have it instead of having to click this move block over and over again you can have this repeat loop around the move block and then attach that there and then it moves like that yeah that's just one way you can also have you can use the the change X by ten block makes the sprite move it also be the my prime move sidetoside so there's lots of different ways of doing it um and then also if you want it to go back you could one thing I can do is I can right click on these blocks and duplicate them and then I can attach it down here and I could make it change X by putting a mind I prefer minus sign and then it will go in the opposite direction so it will go it will start there and then go back there so anyway that's some ways of moving letters side to side um and I saw another question that I'll try to answer before before I um before I have to start wrapping up um someone asks how do I take a picture of my dog to add as a sprite and love that um so you can go to the copy action theory ellamy you can hover over choose a sprite and click paint to create a new sprite and then oh sure once you've painted in news when you clicked paints to make a new sprite you can hover over this button and go to here and click camera and then I'll give it permission to use my camera um and then you probably see me twice uh and so you can take a photo with your camera and I you shouldn't take a photo of yourself so I make to take a photo of my lamp and have that be my dog hover over that and click camera okay my lamp is gonna be my dog yeah very good um and um and so then you have this photo and now that can be your spray and just pretend the instead of my lamp and my chair it was your dog which is possibly much cuter so and then you know you can do all the you know drag out all these code blocks and have them apply to your picture of your dog or lamp and see if you have it spin around or whatever you want so anyway I love that question I'd love to see figures or people's dog oh it looks like we have eight minutes left so I think in case you don't have an account I will show you how you can make an account um and oh my gosh I am so excited to see the project that you've been making I'm like it's the highlight of my week looking at them uh so yes let me show um how do we get a count so uh let's yeah you know that's looking which of my projects you know all say okay so I've made this project with with race from Amazing Grace and I I want to make an account so that I can share it um and so you can click join the scratch uh to what we and you can click that from within this project and it will actually it'll save this project to your account to be your new account me makes you can click join scratch make a username you know it shouldn't have your real name in it so it could be like funny wah 300,000 um I don't know whatever mutilated you want to make make a password write it down somewhere so you can remember it um I don't know I'll write like la la la la la as my password again something that last time um and then uh you can you still out this form and you'll be able to make an account once you make an account you just want to check your email from for an email to confirm your account and once you click the link in that email to confirm then you can uh you can you'll be able to share your project and let me then let me now log into my account and show end so do ya I log into my account so I can show you how you would share a project that's just gonna take me a second to log so yeah sure actually all these from my account because they're all fun but all for now I'll shared the Matilda one so I went sack logging in oh okay yes so I'll show you my screen again so I have uh I have logged into my account zoetrope and now I will name this project about Matilda and then I can click on the seed project page I can just say put in the instructions something about it like click the green flag if you want to give me nice to put any little instructions and then um and then uh you can click share click this button share and now uh you uh you your project is shared in the world and now you can send that link to anybody I can also mention you if you are living in the same house but the person you want to show your project to you could also just show it's them on your computer so if you don't want to make an account you can get active um and and now um how you can I'll show you how you can add this project to a studio so this is my first time looking at the studio I am so excited to see it to add to the studio now a studio link is in this video description so click on that link I already opened it up for myself so I would have it let me refresh and oh my gosh these are amazing i I'll be right after the stream ends I'm literally gonna go and look at all these this is awesome so so just so you go to this link that is in the description below and then you can just click add projects and you're in some there we go okay so your projects you made will show up down here and I can just add my project about Matilda and now it's in the studio we made it so that anyone can add projects so that answers the person who asked at one point how do you share that's how you can share make a project and click that orange share button and be able to do that you have to make sure you've logged into an account and then go to the studio link and add your project by just doing this add projects thing that is that is how to share so I hope you all saw y'all got that I'm definitely gonna share some of these other ones add them in they were very fun my gosh this lamp is hilarious but the eye we're almost almost out of time so I just wanted to thank you all so so much for joining this create along it is truly so fun I just love seeing all your questions there's so many wonderful questions asked here I belong I'm beyond excited to look at these projects I just know there is so much creativity uh in all everyone who uses scratch dreams up projects like I can't wait to see how you talk about your favorite characters out what all your original characters are like so yeah that's that's basically what I wanted to do I don't know if there any last questions coming in it's gonna look and see if anybody had any last questions to ask we will be doing more of these create alongs there will definitely be one next week on we will make sure all the time when we put up our our Twitter and our YouTube and yeah so so there will be one next week I can't wait to have see all of you then you can keep working on this project also don't have to share if you don't want to that's totally fine but if you do I'm so excited to see it oh yeah you know let me just go to the video of myself so you can actually see me oh yeah let us know um how these cool creative lungs are going you know you can keep putting questions into this form because uh yeah is that does the time work is there a time that you would rather that yeah I know some people have mentioned that the it's like at 200 a.m. where they are so hopefully we can find they find some ways to do some that are back we have a time that works for you yeah any anything anything that uh that you would like us to know no different kinds of prompts how how is the tip section going really anything want to know it because this is seriously like the best part of my week he's doing this with you also want to make it fun for you all to know you all inspire me very much and oh my gosh I cannot wait to see all those characters I just saw some glimpses and oh my goodness oh yeah thank you mention next week any of next week stream we will take a look in the projects that were shared over the course of last week so if you can add a product to that studio any time before next week's stream uh yeah we will take a look at that whole studio so anyway I think that's pretty much all it's that idea for what we should do for a future create along so make that question to we'll read it mmm yeah you all seriously just bring a lot of joy to all of our lives in this time so and see you next week and scratch on
