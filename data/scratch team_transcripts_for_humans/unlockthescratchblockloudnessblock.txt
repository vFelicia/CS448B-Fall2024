00:10 - gives high numbers if I on it while I'm
00:12 - being pretty loud and lower numbers if I'm being quieter.
00:17 - If I go to the Motion Section
00:20 - and get a Set Y Block
00:22 - and put this Loudness Block inside it
00:24 - then when I click on it and I'm being loud
00:27 - my sprite is going to be high up,
00:29 - if I'm being quieter, it's going to go further down.
00:32 - I could also go to the Control Section
00:34 - and get a Forever Block.
00:36 - If I click on this
00:38 - it'll keep updating the Y value
00:40 - based on my loudness.
00:42 - Another thing I can do
00:45 - is go to the Events Section
00:46 - and get this When Loudness is Greater Than Block.
00:50 - Maybe I want this to only run when I'm being pretty loud,
00:53 - greater than 50.
00:55 - And let's say I want the rabbit 
00:58 - to change to it's next costume
01:01 - and make a magic sound.
01:05 - Now when I clap my hands...
01:07 - [hand clap]
01:09 - It transforms!
01:10 - What will you create with the Loudness Block?
