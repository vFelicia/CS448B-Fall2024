00:00 - Hey, everyone! My name is Eric.
00:01 - Also known as speakvisually on Scratch.
00:03 - Hi, everyone! I'm Tina. 
Also know as quacht on Scratch.
00:07 - And welcome to the Scratch Video Update!
00:09 -  
00:21 - Hey, everyone. Welcome to the Scratch Video Update. Episode #26.
00:25 - I'm joined by Tina!
00:27 - Hi! I'm a member of the Scratch
Team, and also a graduate student from
00:31 - Lifelong Kindergarten where Scratch was made.
00:34 - We're loving the weather outside, so
we figured we walked outside the MIT
00:37 - campus for this episode.
00:39 - We're also loving a bunch of projects!
00:41 - Oh, that segue to the "Love It" section! I love it!
00:44 - These are projects we're loving in the community, 
though we love them all.
00:48 - I'll start. 
There's this really cute project
00:50 - called "Steppin On The
Beach" and the author of this project
00:55 - invited people to add themselves dancing
on the beach. It's been remixed hundreds of times.
01:00 - Actually, the project was created
in 2011.
01:03 - I invite everyone to add yourself stepping on the beach.
01:07 - How about you, what are you loving?
01:09 - One project I'm really loving is one that helps you bring nature to your projects.
01:13 - It is a forest generator project.
01:15 - By switching costumes and growing sizes,
01:18 - you can get a full forest.
01:20 - And I think it's
like every time you've run the project
01:22 - it's a different forest.
01:23 - It's cool you should totally try that out!
01:25 - Speaking of things to try, we have
our "Things to Try" section!
01:29 - Triple T "Tina Tina, Tina"
01:33 - This section we
want to talk about cool things happen in
01:36 - the community or just things happen with
Scratch.
01:39 - I have one I want to start with
01:41 - I really like this idea of like bringing
Scratch outside and so what I've been
01:45 - doing is using video sensing
to code live backdrops.
01:50 - Cool!
01:51 - Here's an example of
one I went outside of the MIT Media Lab
01:54 - where we work.
I had the webcam facing outward and I
01:57 - just started like playing with things I
sort of in that environment I added a
02:01 - rocket ship added some new buildings. It's just like my first attempt
02:06 - at it but I think people should try it.
02:07 - What about you?
02:09 - One thing that I think people should try is
checking out the photography studio
02:14 - where people are going outside taking
pictures of landscapes
02:19 - animals of just things in their daily
life and their surroundings and bringing
02:24 - them to share with the community.
02:26 - Super cool.
02:27 - I have one more studio that I want to share.
02:30 - It's the news it's the
Scratch Design Studio and it's called
02:32 - "Growing" and the theme is things that
grow, so plants, trees, people, piles of homework.
02:38 - It's actually pretty popular
already there's a couple thousand
02:42 - projects in there but totally check it
out totally again fits in with our theme
02:45 - of being outside in nature.
02:48 - We're so lucky Tina to have
02:50 - you here on the Scratch Video Updates, so we thought the message from the Scratch
02:53 - Team would be learning a bit more about
how it is you've been sort of
02:57 - contributing to Scratch over the years.
02:59 - Something I've been interested in and what brought me to the Scratch Team.
03:02 - is the idea of accessibility, which
it means that anyone no matter what
03:08 - their abilities are can still engage
with and interact with that thing the is accessible
03:14 - I wanted to explore how Scratch could be made accessible to people who can't see
03:18 - and in exploring
03:19 - that I also thought about how Scratch
projects could be made more accessible
03:23 - through their design.
03:25 - Have you considered how your projects could be made
03:28 - accessible to people with different
abilities?
03:30 - I haven't until you mentioned it so I'm
glad you're mentioning this.
03:32 - All right, cool.
03:33 - So there's a bunch of things you
could do to make your projects more accessible.
03:36 - For someone who can't see,
adding in text to speech blocks to
03:41 - voice what is being said and
shown in little speech bubbles.
03:45 - You could also add keyboard controls instead of relying on mouse for people who don't
03:51 - have fine motor skills.
03:53 - You could also,
03:55 - if you're using sound effects on music
maybe add in additional ways to convey
04:00 - the same emotions or the same cues visually.
04:03 - It could help for people who are deaf.
04:06 - Three very nice tips! Thank you
so much for sharing! And so I think we're
04:11 - at the end of the episode and it's
actually kind of fitting I want to turn
04:14 - around here so Tina graduated not more
than a week ago
04:17 - Tina where are you? Tina was
in right in front of the dome here at
04:22 - MIT graduating so congratulations that
make you so much video update!
04:29 - so we'll see everyone in about a month
for another video update. Scratch on!
