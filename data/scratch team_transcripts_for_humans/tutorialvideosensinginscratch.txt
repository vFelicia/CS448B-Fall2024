00:00 - hey everyone its peak usually here from
00:02 - the scratch team at MIT and today I want
00:04 - to show you how to use video sensing
00:06 - blocks if you're not familiar with video
00:09 - sensing it allows someone to interact
00:12 - with your scratch project using the
00:14 - webcam on their computer so it's a
00:16 - really cool set of blocks I'm excited to
00:18 - show you how to use those today so we
00:20 - will find the video sensing blocks in
00:22 - the sensing category so let's go ahead
00:24 - and click that and the three video
00:27 - sensing specific blocks are right here
00:29 - so we see one is a variable and it's
00:31 - video motion on this sprite we see a
00:35 - block that says turn video on and
00:37 - finally set video transparency so we'll
00:40 - dig into all three of these how about we
00:42 - start with this middle one here turned
00:44 - video on so this is really turning the
00:48 - webcam on which will enable the ability
00:52 - to have video sensing on your project so
00:55 - we'll go ahead I just drag that out
00:56 - let's go ahead and make it an event so
00:58 - when green flag clicked turn video on
01:01 - okay cool so the webcam has been turned
01:03 - on and you can see the image in the
01:07 - background is actually the feed from the
01:09 - webcam and so this is really important
01:11 - because well we will use this later on
01:13 - when we use when you create these sort
01:15 - of interactions in our project so you
01:18 - notice there's actually kind of a bit of
01:19 - a white haze over the webcam and that is
01:23 - actually the backdrop that is being
01:25 - displayed on top of the webcam image and
01:29 - that can be manipulated here with the
01:33 - set video transparency so right now it's
01:36 - at 50 percent so it's 50 percent sort of
01:38 - see-through if we make it a zero and
01:41 - then click the green flag we can see
01:43 - that we are seeing zero percent of the
01:45 - backdrop and if we likewise if we change
01:48 - it to 100 we see 100 percent of our
01:51 - white backdrop okay so let's try to find
01:54 - a happy medium so let's go 50 percent so
01:57 - we see some of the backdrop overlaid
01:59 - with some of the webcam footage ok the
02:02 - road cam feed I should say so let's go
02:04 - ahead now and create some sort of
02:06 - interaction I think the most fun part of
02:08 - video sensing so the third and final
02:11 - block that we haven't talked about yet
02:13 - is
02:13 - right down here and this is a variable
02:15 - and this variable is going to detect the
02:18 - amount of motion and so we we have a
02:22 - scale between zero which is like in no
02:24 - motion and 100 which is like going crazy
02:27 - and we can measure that on a sprite okay
02:31 - so how much motion is happening
02:32 - underneath the sprite here so video
02:35 - motion on this sprite we could also
02:38 - detect it based on how much is how much
02:40 - motion is happening on the entire stage
02:42 - right so we could just change that trap
02:44 - down to save that so let's stick with
02:46 - the video motion on this sprite and so I
02:49 - mention it's on a zero to 100 scale so
02:52 - let's see what that scale looks like so
02:54 - if we go down here next to the block we
02:57 - can click this little box here which is
03:00 - going to turn on a reporter which is
03:03 - going to give us the amount of motion
03:05 - that's happening here so we can see
03:07 - right now if nothing's happening it
03:10 - fluctuates between 0 and 1 but if I were
03:13 - to go like this we see we see these
03:16 - values approaching 20 30 100 okay and so
03:20 - you can do that with a lot of other
03:21 - variables too with these so by clicking
03:23 - this checkbox yeah all right so let's go
03:27 - ahead and make a little mini script a
03:29 - little mini project to show how you
03:30 - might use this this new block that we
03:34 - have so let's make it when I go like
03:36 - this we have the cat meow so what we'll
03:40 - do is we'll take our nice little simple
03:42 - script here and let's go ahead and say
03:45 - forever
03:47 - let's ask a question so forever be
03:50 - asking an if/then question and let's
03:53 - drag out an operator and let's say if
03:58 - something is greater so a video motion
04:02 - here is greater than 20 again remember
04:07 - we're measuring it from 0 to 100 so 20
04:09 - is going to be kind of moving like this
04:12 - over the cat if that happens let's have
04:15 - the cat meow so I'll go ahead and drag
04:18 - out the block play sound meow until done
04:22 - and so again the script will say if
04:24 - video motion which we're calculating
04:26 - here
04:27 - seeds is greater than 20 how about you
04:30 - go ahead and play the sound Jin meow so
04:31 - let's go ahead and try this okay very
04:35 - nice so it is working we're see we were
04:38 - hearing the cap now so that is a very
04:40 - simple script how you might use the
04:43 - video sensing blocks to create some
04:46 - small interactions in your scratch
04:48 - project so I hope that was helpful and I
04:50 - look forward to seeing what it is you
04:52 - create with video sensing blocks
