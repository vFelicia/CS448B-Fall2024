00:04 - excited to show you scratch teacher
00:06 - accounts so these are accounts that
00:07 - allow you to more easily manage your
00:09 - class on scratch through a number of new
00:11 - features which we'll show you in this
00:12 - video so we'll start by assuming you've
00:15 - already created a teacher account and
00:17 - remember it can take up to 24 hours for
00:19 - your teacher account to be confirmed so
00:22 - let's go ahead and start by logging into
00:23 - our teacher account so I'll log into
00:25 - mine teach
00:26 - visually okay great so we've landed on
00:29 - the homepage and you'll notice that we
00:30 - have a new purple Banner uh and in this
00:33 - purple Banner we have some helpful
00:34 - resources for teachers that are using
00:36 - scratch so let's start by looking at
00:38 - these three buttons let's start here to
00:40 - the right so we see teacher account
00:42 - frequently asked questions so this is a
00:45 - page that has questions and answers
00:47 - related to sort of anything and
00:48 - everything related to teacher accounts
00:50 - so check that out if you have any
00:52 - questions about sort of teacher account
00:54 - functionalities and things of the like
00:56 - so let's go ahead and check out the next
00:58 - button here which is Educator resources
01:01 - this is a wonderful new page we created
01:03 - that has a bunch of tutorials uh that
01:05 - you can use um for scratch with your
01:07 - students and also stories of folks like
01:09 - you who are using scratch in a variety
01:11 - of educational settings so definitely
01:13 - check out this page for more
01:15 - information great so let's talk about
01:18 - this third and last button here and that
01:20 - is the my classes so my classes is a
01:22 - space where you can find all the teacher
01:24 - features like opening a class managing a
01:26 - class adding students adding Studios and
01:29 - things like that so you can see we've
01:31 - landed on the my class page I've already
01:32 - created two classes here so Dutch 102
01:34 - and world history but let's go ahead and
01:36 - create another class so I'll go ahead
01:39 - and add a new class by clicking the add
01:41 - new class button we can go ahead and
01:43 - give the class name let's call it
01:45 - scratch
01:46 - 101 and let's just for now write test
01:50 - for this class the class description and
01:52 - we'll go ahead and we'll add the class
01:54 - great and you can see that we
01:56 - successfully added the class and we're
01:57 - presented with a number of options here
01:59 - so we can go ahead and change the icon
02:02 - of the class which will appear on the
02:03 - class page we can change what the class
02:06 - is working on and if we want we can end
02:08 - the class probably doesn't make sense to
02:10 - do that now but what happens is when you
02:11 - end a class students will effectively no
02:13 - longer be able to log into their
02:15 - accounts to access the class but we
02:17 - probably shouldn't do that now but no
02:19 - you can also reopen the class at any
02:21 - point in the future um let's talk about
02:24 - uh adding students to a class because so
02:26 - what is a class without adding students
02:28 - so we'll go ahead to the students tab
02:29 - here
02:30 - uh and you'll be happy to know that with
02:33 - scratch teacher accounts we've added a
02:34 - number of new ways for you to to add
02:36 - students multiple students at a time so
02:39 - we'll talk about the different ways in
02:40 - which you can add multiple students uh
02:43 - let's start with the student signup link
02:45 - so if we click this we can generate a
02:48 - link that our students can follow to
02:50 - create their accounts that will
02:51 - automatically be added to our class so
02:53 - if we go ahead and click that
02:55 - generate button it will create a link
02:58 - for us and then let's go ahead and check
02:59 - out this this link to see what it looks
03:00 - like so again I'll open up a new window
03:03 - here we'll send this over to the
03:05 - students in our class and they'll see
03:08 - something like this which is a signup
03:09 - page uh and then they can say okay do
03:11 - you want to join the scr uh the class
03:13 - scratch 101 sure let's get started
03:16 - they'll put in a username they'll put in
03:17 - a password and they'll continue on to
03:19 - create their
03:21 - account great and another way in which
03:23 - we can add students is through a CSV
03:25 - upload so we click the CSV upload button
03:27 - here and if you're not familiar with the
03:29 - CSV it's just a text file with a list of
03:31 - items uh separated by commas so you can
03:33 - see an example of a CSV file that you
03:35 - would use to create accounts is the uh
03:38 - the username of the account you want to
03:40 - create followed by a comma and then the
03:43 - password of that account uh and so we
03:45 - have an example here that you can
03:46 - download uh and you can start adding
03:48 - your accounts that way if you want I did
03:50 - that earlier and created a CSV let's
03:52 - pull it up so we can see here I have
03:55 - like one account I want to create create
03:57 - is goo loves dancing 5 comma the
04:00 - password for that account so I'm going
04:02 - to create three accounts here I'll go
04:04 - ahead save that file and then we'll go
04:06 - here to choose the file the CSV that we
04:09 - have cool and then I'll hit that big old
04:12 - upload button now let's see uh oh okay
04:15 - so we ran into an error it says Row
04:17 - three username already exists so please
04:20 - update the CSV file so let's go back to
04:22 - our CSV file so Row three one two 3
04:25 - speak visually so that's actually my
04:26 - account that I own so I I'll go ahead
04:29 - let's remove this row this account uh
04:31 - from our CSV or if we wanted we could
04:33 - change the username uh just make sure
04:36 - that it doesn't already exist on the
04:37 - scratch website so I'll just go ahead
04:39 - and delete that let's just try to add
04:40 - two accounts here so I'll hit
04:43 - save now uh it's already there uploaded
04:45 - so I'll just go ahead and hit
04:49 - upload great and so there we have it we
04:51 - created two accounts uh here uh for our
04:54 - scratch 101 class now there's another
04:57 - way in which you can add students uh you
04:59 - can add them individually so we can hit
05:01 - this button here the new student button
05:03 - to add individual accounts so let's go
05:05 - ahead and say
05:08 - goo loves dancing six okay so we can
05:13 - create this account so you notice we
05:15 - weren't prompted to put in a password
05:17 - this account will take on the password
05:19 - of the teacher's username so in this
05:21 - case it' be capital T teach capital V
05:25 - visually awesome so we have our three
05:27 - accounts here for our scratch one one
05:29 - class let's go ahead and check out some
05:31 - of the account settings uh for our
05:33 - student accounts so you'll notice in
05:35 - this we have multiple ways to help a
05:38 - student sort of change their password
05:40 - one we can manually change the student's
05:42 - password by clicking this button so we
05:44 - can go ahead and give a new password to
05:45 - the student another one is we can have
05:49 - the student's password be reset to your
05:52 - username so in this case it' be teach
05:54 - visually and then they would use that
05:56 - password teach visually to log in and
05:58 - when they log in they would be requested
06:00 - to then create a new password and we
06:02 - also have the ability to remove an icon
06:05 - uh from a student if we so choose so
06:08 - great so those are some of the settings
06:09 - that we have for the students in our
06:12 - class let's go ahead now and check out
06:14 - uh the way in which we can create
06:15 - Studios for our class so we can go ahead
06:18 - and click this tab Studios uh and we can
06:21 - create a new class Studio which is very
06:23 - similar to a studio that you would
06:25 - create on the scratch website except
06:26 - when you create these Studios your
06:28 - students will automatically be added as
06:31 - curators to the studio so we can go
06:33 - ahead create uh a new studio let's call
06:35 - it scratch 101 Week 1 uh and really
06:38 - quickly we'll just have the studio
06:39 - description test uh and then you can see
06:43 - there we have it we created a new class
06:44 - studio and again our students will be
06:47 - curators of that studio cool so we've
06:49 - talked about settings we've talked about
06:51 - how how to add students how to manage
06:53 - students how to create Studios let's
06:55 - peek at this which is activity so this
06:57 - is the activity for the class we noticed
06:59 - we don't have much activity let's go
07:01 - ahead and check out another class that I
07:02 - have that probably has a bit more
07:03 - activity so we can go to the world
07:05 - history class that I have uh let's check
07:07 - out the activity and we can see that uh
07:09 - some of my students have made uh shared
07:12 - projects or made updates to their
07:13 - profile uh and things like
07:15 - that great so let's also talk about some
07:18 - of the other features that we have as a
07:20 - teacher which is we can now actually
