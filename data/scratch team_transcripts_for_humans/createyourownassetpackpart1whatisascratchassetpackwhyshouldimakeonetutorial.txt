00:09 - Hello! I’m Justin from 
STEAM for Vietnam.
00:12 - I’m collaborating with the 
Scratch Team to explore creating
00:16 - a culturally and geographically-
relevant asset pack 
00:19 - in the Scratch editor 
00:20 - that can be shared with other 
Scratchers around the globe.
00:24 - STEAM for Vietnam is a 
501(c)(3) nonprofit organization
00:29 - And our mission is to 
bring free and quality
00:32 - STEM/STEAM education to 
millions of Vietnamese students.
00:36 - As part of our work, 
we have created an asset pack 
00:39 - to share with our learners.
00:41 - “What is an asset pack?” 
you might ask.
00:43 - Assets, in Scratch,
can include sprites, costumes,
00:49 - sounds, or backdrops,
as well as code snippets.
00:54 - And an asset pack is 
a collection of assets
00:57 - related to a specific theme,
project type, cultural event,
01:02 - cultural symbols or customs, 
geographical region, or idea.
01:07 - As the use of Scratch 
continues to grow globally, 
01:11 - we know users want to create 
projects that represent 
01:15 - where they are from 
and their culture.
01:16 - While the default sprite, 
backdrop, and sound libraries 
01:20 - are limited, users can 
create their own assets
01:24 - and share them in a project. 
So other users 
01:26 - can access them and 
employ them in their projects.
01:31 - Let me show you how!
01:32 - I’m going to create an asset
showing a bowl of phở.
01:36 - Phở is a traditional cuisine
in Vietnam that consists of 
01:40 - phở noodles, beef, 
beef broth, basil,
01:46 - lime, bean sprouts, 
and some other herbs.
01:51 - This is super delicious.
01:53 - And you should definitely try it
if you have a chance.
01:57 - I’m choosing to create this 
asset because I know
02:00 - learning through what we love
is much more engaging and fun!
02:04 - And a food asset 
02:05 - can be used in a variety of 
ways in Scratch projects.
02:10 - Hi, it’s Maren, aka algorithmar,
from the Scratch Team.
02:14 - As you’re creating your asset, 
you might ask yourself  
02:17 - what are the 
unique characteristics 
02:19 - that give your asset 
a sense of place?
02:22 - You may want to consider 
creating an asset pack 
02:24 - surrounding a certain theme.
For example, 
02:27 - assets related to a local 
holiday, festival, or custom.
02:31 - Or consider adding assets 
from categories like
02:34 - food items, cultural dress, 
home architecture styles, 
02:38 - modes of transportation, 
native plants or animals, 
02:42 - urban or rural landscapes, 
or important landmarks.
02:47 - Just be sure that 
your asset 
02:48 - follows the 
Community Guidelines
02:50 - and does not reveal 
personal information 
02:51 - like the city you live in 
or a photo of your face.
02:56 - Join us in our next video 
02:57 - where we explore 
creating an asset.
