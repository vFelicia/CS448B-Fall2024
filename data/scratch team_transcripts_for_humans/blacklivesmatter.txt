02:14 - - Doesn't matter what your age is,
02:17 - because sometimes when you're
younger, you're braver.
02:20 - - I can be a part of change

impact on the world.
02:25 - - I hope that Black
lives don't get treated
02:27 - the same like they do now.
02:29 - I hope that they actually do
matter like they're saying.
