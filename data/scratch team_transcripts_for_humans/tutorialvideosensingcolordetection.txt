00:04 - [Music]
00:11 - hey everyone its erik here from the
00:14 - scratch team I'm super excited to show
00:16 - you how it is you can use video sensing
00:18 - and color detection in scratch to create
00:21 - some pretty remarkable programs so I
00:23 - think we should start with just
00:25 - Rifa miliar izing ourselves with this
00:27 - notion of color detection in scratch so
00:30 - I've read a simple program here where as
00:32 - you can see if I press the right arrow
00:34 - key the cat is moving to the right and
00:36 - if I press the left arrow key the cat is
00:38 - moving to the left so what if we want to
00:40 - add some color sensing into this project
00:43 - so what I'll do is I'll go to the
00:45 - backdrop and say we want to have the cat
00:48 - hit something that is red and the cat
00:50 - says ow so I've clicked the backdrop I'm
00:53 - gonna go ahead and draw a shape and I'm
00:55 - just gonna go ahead and make it a giant
00:57 - red circle I'll go ahead and always drop
00:59 - it here okay now I'll go back to my
01:02 - scratch cat sprite I'll go back to the
01:04 - scripts and what we want to say is if
01:07 - the cat is touching this red blob let's
01:10 - pretend it's lava have the cat say out
01:12 - and what we do is we'll use a sensing
01:14 - block for this so we'll make a statement
01:17 - that uses this block here touching color
01:20 - let's go ahead and drag this out and we
01:24 - can go ahead and select the color that
01:25 - we want to sort of interact with so you
01:28 - do that by clicking this button and that
01:29 - will have a color picker so you can see
01:31 - as I mouse over things it's showing me
01:33 - the color go ahead click the red okay so
01:36 - the color is touch now nothing's gonna
01:38 - happen we haven't really built a script
01:39 - yet around this but this is sort of the
01:41 - magical block if you will so let's go
01:44 - ahead and build a script that says when
01:46 - touching so when green flag is clicked
01:49 - let's go ahead and make an if-then
01:51 - statement so if then so if scratch cat
01:56 - is touching this color let's go ahead
01:59 - and have scratch cat say oh okay cool
02:04 - now this isn't going to actually work if
02:07 - we hit and we try it and it's not gonna
02:09 - work cuz this is a question that only
02:11 - gets asked once so an if-then statement
02:13 - gets asked
02:14 - once and that happens immediately after
02:16 - I hit the green flag so I want to do is
02:18 - I want to wrap this question here in a
02:21 - forever loop so I'm gonna forever be
02:24 - asking if I'm touching this color so
02:27 - let's go ahead and run it again and see
02:28 - okay cool so we're in good shape so we
02:31 - made a really simple program here on the
02:34 - screen that says win scratch cat hits
02:36 - the red blob on our backdrop say ow
02:39 - objectively that is a really useful
02:41 - thing to know how to do in scratch but
02:43 - let's take this a step further wouldn't
02:46 - it be cool if scratch cat can interact
02:48 - with objects not on the backdrop but
02:50 - sort of in the physical world and we can
02:53 - do this using video sensing which
02:55 - enables us to use the webcam to interact
02:57 - with scratch projects so to do this what
03:00 - I'm gonna do is actually let's just
03:02 - start with a white backdrop so I'll put
03:05 - my backdrops and I'll just click a white
03:07 - backdrop let's go back to our scratch
03:08 - cat here now first things first let's go
03:12 - ahead and start video sensing and what
03:14 - you can do it's really simple we'll just
03:16 - run the script that says win green flag
03:18 - clicked let's go ahead in the sensing
03:21 - category you'll see this block turned
03:23 - video on and when I click this it's
03:27 - going to enable video sensing which
03:30 - turns on the webcam so you can see the
03:32 - webcam here I have pointing down on a
03:34 - sheet of white paper so video sensing
03:38 - has been enabled and what we can do is
03:40 - let's use the same concept we have here
03:43 - but instead of drawing anything on the
03:45 - backdrop remember we did this let's go
03:48 - ahead and use a Lego piece that is red
03:51 - and see what happens so let me go to my
03:53 - bin here let me grab a Lego and let me
03:57 - set it down here on our little stage
04:01 - here and the same concept of when
04:05 - touching is going to actually work here
04:07 - so I will go to the right and see okay
04:10 - nothing is happening so that looks like
04:12 - this red color here doesn't match the
04:15 - red of the Lego so I'll go ahead and
04:17 - select the red of the Lego which looks
04:19 - like a little bit of a darker red and
04:21 - I'll go ahead and do it and so you can
04:23 - see the webcam and video sensing all
04:27 - so detects color so no matter where I
04:29 - move this will see whoops I can't move
04:32 - up yet so it's going to be able to
04:35 - detects it so this is really the magic
04:37 - that unlocks a lot of things and really
04:39 - the possibilities of what you can do are
04:41 - like not to be cliche they're really
04:43 - endless and so I just want to show you
04:45 - here I'll jump to like three examples of
04:48 - what it is you can do using again video
04:51 - sensing and color detection this simple
04:54 - script that we just put together so
04:56 - here's a music making program that I
04:58 - created super simple scripts these are
05:00 - all the scripts here I just created a
05:02 - black bar that travels from the left
05:05 - side of the screen to the right side of
05:06 - the screen and that's here in this
05:07 - script and when that black bar touches a
05:11 - leggo of a certain color it'll play a
05:12 - specific note so you know when it's
05:14 - touching a green it will play see when
05:18 - it's touching orange will play E when
05:19 - it's touching a it'll play when touching
05:21 - red it'll play the a note so here it is
05:41 - so I don't know it's kind of a silly
05:43 - project but you can be sort of mixing
05:45 - music live and changing the code and
05:47 - it's quite cool it's a good project to
05:49 - sort of start playing with so here's a
05:52 - project that allows you to juggle cats
05:53 - and dogs and so what that's doing is I'm
06:05 - triggering the sounds based on the color
06:07 - of the balloon and there's something
06:09 - kind of cool about this project is
06:11 - actually I made a really large blacks
06:14 - right that takes up the entire screen
06:16 - and using the ghosts effect I hid that
06:19 - sprite so you can see here it goes to
06:21 - effect 99 I'll change it to zero so you
06:23 - can see what I'm talking about
06:24 - this is the sprite and so whenever I
06:27 - touch that which is pretty much the
06:29 - whole stage it'll trigger these sounds
06:31 - but to hide this bright I went ahead and
06:34 - set the transparency of that to sort of
06:37 - 99 so now you see this bright kind of
06:39 - looks like it disappeared but it's
06:40 - really there so
06:41 - whenever something touches it look down
06:44 - here it's really touching this bright
06:46 - even though it's quite hidden and I'm
06:49 - using the simple scripts here touching
06:51 - color to play to sounds so this final
06:53 - example I want to share with you is a
06:55 - simple platform game than it made using
06:57 - video sensing so you can see here the
07:00 - green acts as like a bounce pad the red
07:03 - acts as lava so you want to avoid that
07:05 - and the black is the ground and so what
07:08 - I've done is I've just sort of remixed
07:10 - an existing platform game and I want to
07:12 - point you to this code here where you
07:14 - can see the floor script here is using
07:17 - wind touching color and I've selected
07:19 - the color of the floor by sort of
07:21 - mousing over I'm selecting my black and
07:23 - that's the case for the lava and the
07:25 - bounce pad and etc anything you want to
07:27 - add to this I'm gonna sort of wave my
07:29 - hands above the rest of the scripts here
07:31 - and encourage you to check out some
07:33 - platformer tutorials there are plenty
07:35 - out there on YouTube and on scratch but
07:37 - the basic concept of this idea of having
07:40 - your objects be moveable and that you
07:42 - can interact with them sort of it works
07:44 - in this real time for the game creation
07:46 - so I've encourage you to check that out
07:47 - and all of the projects that I've shared
07:50 - with you I'll provide a link in the
07:52 - description of the video or even at the
07:53 - end of this video so you can check it
07:55 - out and remix and so I wish everyone a
07:58 - great time creating and tinkering with
08:01 - the video sensing and color detection
08:03 - it's really remarkable to see what is
08:05 - you can make
08:07 - you

hey everyone its erik here from the scratch team I'm super excited to show you how it is you can use video sensing and color detection in scratch to create some pretty remarkable programs so I think we should start with just Rifa miliar izing ourselves with this notion of color detection in scratch so I've read a simple program here where as you can see if I press the right arrow key the cat is

want to have the cat hit something that is red and the cat says ow so I've clicked the backdrop I'm gonna go ahead and draw a shape and I'm just gonna go ahead and make it a giant red circle I'll go ahead and always drop it here okay now I'll go back to my scratch cat sprite I'll go back to the scripts and what we want to say is if the cat is touching this red blob let's pretend it's lava have the cat say out and what we do is we'll use a sensing block for this so we'll make a statement that uses this block here touching color let's go ahead and drag this out and we can go ahead and select

the red okay so the color is touch now nothing's gonna happen we haven't really built a script yet around this but this is sort of the magical block if you will so let's go ahead and build a script that says when touching so when green flag is clicked let's go ahead and make an ifthen statement so if then so if scratch cat is touching this color let's go ahead and have scratch cat say oh okay cool now this isn't going to actually work if we hit and we try it and it's not gonna work cuz this is a question that only gets asked once so an ifthen statement gets asked once and that happens
