00:08 - welcome to episode number 13 lucky
00:12 - episode number 13 and happy New Year
00:13 - happy New Year it's been a while since
00:15 - the last update I think it's been we're
00:16 - overdue by a couple weeks so sorry about
00:19 - that but you have been busy since then
00:21 - yes um actually before I jump in where
00:23 - are we we're in the MIT media lab oo
00:26 - this is where we walk in every day there
00:28 - there's also Lego model
00:30 - the media lab super beautiful yes so
00:32 - we've been busy and uh for me I've been
00:35 - traveling to different parts of the
00:36 - world one of which was Tokyo and at
00:39 - Tokyo Japan and while I was there I met
00:41 - scratchers scratch teachers researchers
00:44 - developers all working on Scratch and I
00:46 - got to see some pretty cool projects and
00:49 - meet some new people and we also worked
00:51 - on projects together I'm super jealous I
00:53 - actually went home I was back in Ohio I
00:54 - was not in Tokyo uh and I got a
00:56 - quadcopter and I have no idea how to fly
00:58 - it so if anyone has advice on how to fly
00:59 - the things let me know please but with
01:03 - that let's get to it our first segment
01:05 - love it love it so the love it section
01:08 - is projects that Rick Rose and I found
01:09 - in the community that we love though we
01:11 - love all projects equally um so one
01:13 - project I want to talk about was uh it's
01:15 - project by pixel and it's called when I
01:17 - photobomb people and if you're not
01:18 - familiar with photob bombing it's just
01:20 - when someone like walks in the back of
01:21 - your shot and the person like doesn't
01:23 - know that it's happening and I guess it
01:25 - happens quite often um but anyway so
01:27 - they made a project where a skier comes
01:29 - by and photob bombs their picture it's
01:31 - hilarious but then even cooler is
01:33 - there's like over 600 remixes of people
01:35 - having different people photo bomb them
01:37 - so I really enjoy that project so
01:40 - another project that I loved and a bunch
01:42 - of us also loved it too is this uh
01:44 - pillow fight made by Squig 3 Squig and
01:48 - you can join this project and it's
01:50 - multiplayer you can actually pillow
01:52 - fight with other people from anywhere in
01:55 - scratches using this project and you you
01:58 - you fight with pillows yes crazy it's
02:00 - using Cloud variables for like a real
02:02 - time multiplayer game I think it's one
02:03 - of my favorite Cloud variable projects I
02:05 - actually am res and I did a pel fight
02:07 - and I think he let me win anyways who
02:11 - really wins in a pillow fight everyone
02:13 - wins uh so so with that those are PR we
02:16 - love but we have our other segment
