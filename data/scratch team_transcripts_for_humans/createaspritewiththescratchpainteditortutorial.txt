your own original sprite
00:12 - using the Scratch paint
editor tools.
00:14 - If I go down to the Choose
a Sprite menu and click “Paint,”
00:18 - I now have vector tools
to draw my own sprite.
00:20 - If you're creating
your own sprites, it's important
00:23 - you stay in the default vector
mode to create your artwork.
00:26 - There are two modes
for drawing in Scratch.
00:28 - Bitmap mode allows you to edit
photos and paint with pixels.
00:32 - Vector mode allows users
to adjust colors, 
00:35 - change the shape of an object, 
00:36 - add or remove elements, etc.
00:38 - If users remix your sprites,
this flexibility is important.
00:43 - Say I want to draw a cat face.
00:44 - I'm going to
choose the Circle tool.
00:46 - And if I hold down
the “shift” key,
00:48 - I can create a perfect circle.
00:50 - Now, I need to create some ears.
00:51 - I don't see any triangles 
in my available menu,
00:54 - but I do see a Rectangle tool.
00:56 - If I hold down the “shift”
key again
00:58 - while I'm drawing the rectangle,
I get a perfect square.
01:01 - Now, I can use a tool
called the Reshape tool.
01:03 - The Reshape tool
allows me to select points
01:06 - on my vector drawing 
that I can manipulate.
01:08 - I can grab a point and move it
around to change the shape.
01:11 - I can also use the Delete tool
to delete a point.
01:14 - Now, I've got a triangle.
01:16 - If the triangle is too wide
or not tall enough,
01:19 - I can use the Reshape tool
to manipulate other points.
01:22 - If I change the point
to a curve,
01:24 - I can use these handles to
adjust the shape of the curve.
01:27 - Once I've got a shape
that I like,
01:29 - I can use this Select tool
to rotate it, to resize it,
01:32 - and to drag it to where
I need it to be on my drawing.
01:35 - This cat needs two ears,
01:36 - so I'm going to use
01:37 - the Copy option, Paste,
and then Flip my copy
01:41 - so that I have
two identical ears on my cat.
01:44 - Now for some whiskers.
01:46 - I could use my Line tool to draw
perfectly straight whiskers
01:49 - or I can use the Brush tool.
01:51 - I can adjust the size I need
and then hand draw my whiskers.
01:55 - Uh oh, I made these
whiskers in yellow.
01:57 - I can select those
individual lines
01:59 - that I just brushed
on and change the color.
02:02 - Now, I just need to add some
code to bring my sprite to life.
02:06 - [Scream]
02:07 - The possibilities are endless. 
What will you create?
