00:00 - - Hi, everyone, it's Zoe
from the Scratch Team,
00:01 - (upbeat music)
00:02 - also known as Zinnea.
00:03 - Today I wanted to show you three ways
00:05 - of making pixel art in Scratch.
00:08 - If you're wondering what pixel art is,
00:09 - it's this kind of art, it's
used all the time in games,
00:12 - and animations, and lots
of different art forms,
00:15 - and I think it's really fun
and really easy to try out.
00:18 - And there are three easy
ways of doing it in Scratch.
00:20 - So, method one, this is a
way of turning any sprite
00:23 - into pixel with just one code block.
00:25 - So, to show you, I will choose a sprite,
00:28 - I'll hover over the Choose a
Sprite button and click Choose,
00:32 - and I think I'll choose the chick.
00:37 - So, what you're gonna do is
go to the Looks category,
00:41 - scroll down to the Set Color Effect block.
00:44 - Let me make this a little bigger.
00:46 - But this block has lots of other effects,
00:48 - including pixelate, so
if I click the block now,
00:52 - nothing happens, set
Pixelate Effect to zero,
00:54 - just makes the sprite look
normal, but if I put in 60.
00:59 - Ah, it's so cute, yeah, so as you can see,
01:02 - it gets sort of blocky, and
if I put in something smaller,
01:05 - like 40, it becomes a bit more defined.
01:08 - And if you put in
something bigger like 80,
01:11 - it's super blocky, oh,
my god, that's so cute.
01:14 - So, yeah, this method doesn't
work that well on all sprites,
01:17 - it doesn't so well on
sprites that are photos,
01:19 - but sometimes it turns out great,
01:20 - so I really recommend trying it out.
01:22 - It's also a great way of making
pixel-art-style backdrops.
01:26 - So, I'll hover the
Choose a Backdrop button,
01:29 - and click Choose, I'll pick
something like the desert.
01:34 - And if I drag out the Set
Color Effect block again,
01:38 - and choose Pixelate, and set it to 60.
01:43 - Ah, there you go, now the backdrop
01:44 - is in that pixel-art style.
01:46 - So, that's method one, method two is a way
01:48 - of changing a sprite into pixel art
01:50 - by changing it's
appearance in a really way.
01:52 - So, I'll grab another sprite,
01:54 - this time I think I'll pick the dragon.
01:59 - So, for this, you're gonna want
to go into the Costumes tab.
02:02 - If this button says Convert to Bitmap,
02:05 - then you want to click Convert to Bitmap.
02:07 - There are two drawing modes
in Scratch, Vector and Bitmap.
02:11 - Vector mode is good for creating shapes,
02:14 - and then moving them
around, while Bitmap mode
02:16 - is good for drawing
directly on the canvas.
02:19 - So, for this, we want
it to be in Bitmap mode,
02:21 - so if it say Convert to Bitmap,
click Convert to Bitmap,
02:25 - drag to select everything,
and then drag it
02:28 - down to be pretty small,
I'll go maybe this small.
02:34 - Click away from it to
deselect it, that's important,
02:37 - and then drag to select
everything again, and enlarge it.
02:42 - And yeah, there you go, now the dragon
02:44 - is in this pixel-art style,
I think it looks great.
02:46 - So, that's method two, method
three is to draw pixel art
02:50 - from a blank canvas, and
I'll show you how to do that.
02:53 - So, again, we're gonna hover
over the Choose a Sprite
02:56 - button, but this time
we're gonna click Paint.
03:00 - And we want to click Convert to Bitmap,
03:02 - we want to be drawing in Bitmap mode.
03:05 - And then you want to
zoom in a lot of times,
03:09 - just keep zooming, and finally
when it's pretty small,
03:15 - click on the paintbrush.
03:17 - It starts out at size
10, which is this circle,
03:20 - but you want to set it to one,
03:22 - which is the smallest square possible.
03:24 - And then you can just
draw whatever you want.
03:28 - I will draw a blob, and give
it some eyes, and a mouth.
03:35 - Yeah, that's pretty cute,
03:36 - and I think I'll click the fill bucket
03:38 - and pick out a blue color, make
it a little less saturated.
03:45 - Yeah, that's a good blob,
so where is this sprite?
03:47 - It's tiny because we
zoomed in so many times
03:50 - to draw at this small scale,
03:52 - so what I usually do
is set the size to 800
03:55 - or something like that,
yeah, that's pretty good.
03:59 - And so now, you can see it.
04:01 - So, yeah, that's basically
what I wanted to show you.
04:04 - I think pixel art is really fun to make,
04:05 - and really easy to get started with.
04:07 - I hope this video has given you some ideas
04:09 - of things to try, or things to draw.
04:12 - So, I'd love to see what you make.
04:13 - See you next time, and Scratch on!
04:18 - (blob beeps)
