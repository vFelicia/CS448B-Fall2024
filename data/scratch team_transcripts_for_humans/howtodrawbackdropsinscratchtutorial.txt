00:00 - - Hi everyone, it's Zoë
from the Scratch team,
00:02 - also known as Zinnea.
00:03 - Today, I wanted to show you how I draw
00:05 - really simple backdrops in Scratch.
00:07 - Adding a backdrop to a Scratch project
00:09 - has this ability to really set the scene.
00:12 - And I have found that there
are really simple ways
00:14 - of drawing an effective backdrop.
00:16 - So that's what I wanted to show you today.
00:17 - Let's get started.
00:18 - To draw a backdrop in Scratch,
just hover over this button
00:21 - that says, choose a
backdrop and click paint.
00:25 - I found that a good base
for drawing a backdrop
00:27 - is to create two rectangles
of different colors.
00:30 - One to be the sky or the wall
00:32 - and the other to be the
ground or the floor.
00:34 - So if I was doing an outdoor scene,
00:36 - I would probably do a blue
rectangle for the sky,
00:38 - and the way I would do that is
click on the rectangle tool,
00:41 - change the color to blue and
drag out a big rectangle.
00:45 - I usually click here to edit the outline
00:48 - and make there be no outline on the shape.
00:50 - And then, to make the grass,
I will set the color to green
00:53 - and drag out another rectangle
sort of on the bottom.
00:56 - And then once I finished the base,
00:57 - I like to add one item in the backdrop.
00:59 - And I usually like to create this item
01:01 - with either the circle
tool or the rectangle tool.
01:05 - So, what's something that could
be in an outdoor backdrop?
01:07 - I could add a rock to it.
01:09 - So if I click on the circle
tool and set the color to gray
01:13 - and then drag out an oval
and click on this tool
01:16 - to edit the points of the shape
01:18 - and move the bottom point inward,
01:20 - yeah, that looks like a rock
01:21 - and I could even change the color slightly
01:23 - and make another smaller rock next to it.
01:25 - And there you go.
01:26 - That's a pretty simple backdrop
01:28 - and it's really quick to make.
01:29 - So, for drawing your own backdrops,
01:30 - one way you can start is
by thinking of two colors
01:33 - for your scene.
01:34 - If it's an indoor scene,
it could be a yellow wall
01:37 - and a blue floor.
01:38 - If it's a city scene, it could
be a brownish reddish wall
01:41 - and a gray street.
01:42 - If it's a scene in a spaceship
01:43 - or a secret hideout or something,
01:44 - it could be a light gray
wall and a dark gray floor.
01:48 - And then, you can think of
some small object or detail
01:50 - to add with the rectangle
or the circle tool.
01:53 - A flat brown rectangle
could be a shelf in a house
01:55 - and you could even put
a square on top of it,
01:58 - and then that looks like
a vase on the shelf.
02:00 - Some flat rectangles of a
slightly different shade of brown
02:02 - could be bricks on a wall.
02:03 - A light blue rectangle
could be a window in a house
02:05 - and a dark blue rectangle could
be a window in a spaceship
02:08 - out to the night sky.
02:09 - One particular type of
object you might wanna add
02:12 - is a plant or a bush
or the leaves of trees.
02:14 - And I have found for this,
that the paintbrush tool
02:16 - is really helpful.
02:17 - So you have this color set in green,
02:19 - you could click on the paint brush tool
02:21 - and just draw sort of
squiggly rough lines,
02:24 - they don't have to be
anything in particular.
02:25 - Make some squiggly shape and fill it in
02:27 - with the fill bucket, and
then that could be a bush,
02:31 - you could make a plant,
you could even make
02:32 - sort of the canopy of leaves
at the top of the forest,
02:35 - which could give the idea that
your scene is a forest scene
02:38 - without you having to
draw every single tree.
02:40 - For any object that you'd
like to have a rough edge,
02:42 - I definitely recommend experimenting
02:44 - with the paintbrush tool.
02:45 - And lastly, let me show you
how you could get started
02:47 - with a top down backdrop,
02:48 - a backdrop where your
project is seen from above.
02:50 - What I'll do for a top down backdrop
02:52 - is just do one big rectangle
for the base ground,
02:55 - and then just drop paths
with the paintbrush tool
02:58 - set to whatever color
I'd like the paths to be.
03:00 - And you could even use the
circle tool or the rectangle tool
03:03 - to create shapes that
would be seen from above.
03:04 - Anyway, there are so many ways
to draw backdrops in Scratch.
03:07 - I wanted to give you some ideas
03:09 - that could give you inspiration,
03:11 - but you can take these ideas
in any direction you want.
03:14 - See what you like drawing and
what works for your characters
03:16 - and your projects.
03:17 - I'll see you next time and Scratch on!
