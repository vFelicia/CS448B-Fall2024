00:01 - hey everyone greetings from outside of
00:03 - the scratch headquarters on the MIT
00:05 - campus my name is Eric also known as
00:07 - speak vigil on Scratch and I'm Rick Rose
00:10 - also known as Rick Rose on scratch
00:12 - welcome to the third episode of the
00:13 - scratch update um so we've been having a
00:16 - lot of snow coming through Boston so we
00:17 - thought it was only appropriate to take
00:19 - you guys outside in the elements with us
00:21 - for this video update just kidding it's
00:24 - really cold out it's way too cold look
00:25 - at my glasses they're all gross I can't
00:27 - feel my fingers yeah yeah so joining you
00:29 - from inside
00:30 - so last week we highlighted Studios and
00:33 - this week we thought we'd highlight the
00:34 - way scratchers help each other in the
00:36 - community Through tutorial projects cool
00:38 - so our first segment love it um so my
00:42 - love it project is by the user theore
00:45 - grits and it's a tutorial project and
00:47 - it's called Fix It pong and a lot of
00:49 - tutorials sort of follow step-by-step
00:52 - instructions um and then you sort of
00:54 - create something um but the Grits sort
00:56 - of switched it up so they shared a
00:59 - project that had had a pong game but it
01:01 - was broken and so the first step was to
01:03 - click the C inside button and the Grits
01:06 - put little hints in the code of how to
01:08 - fix it and what that did is you sort of
01:11 - you learned by fixing the code and
01:13 - seeing it affect the scratch project
01:16 - which I thought was a really sort of uh
01:18 - cool inventive way to come up with a way
01:20 - to teach scratch cool well my tutorial
01:24 - is done by day 30 it's a vector tutorial
01:28 - and day 30 shows this cool uh tool
01:30 - called a reshape tool and you can take
01:32 - any of the vector objects and it shows
01:35 - these dots that you can move around and
01:37 - shape it any way you like it and through
01:39 - like a step-by-step process day 30 shows
01:42 - some cool tricks that you can do like
01:43 - some cool line art tricks to like do
01:45 - different sizes and uh as the says like
01:48 - the best part shading and so it's kind
01:51 - of adding like more Dimension to your
01:53 - vector art which is and using the other
01:55 - editor in scratch yeah those I guess are
01:58 - two examples of tutorials that we found
02:00 - were pretty cool um but there are there
02:02 - are thousands probably thousands of
02:03 - tutorials out there and so that sort of
02:06 - leads us to our next segment which is
02:07 - things to try things to try oop we lost
02:11 - the the ruler's
02:13 - gone there's a lot of wind the snowstorm
02:17 - we should get that after this
02:19 - we're um sorry so things to try um so on
02:23 - the point of having a lot of different
02:25 - tutorials I found a studio I found two
02:27 - Studios actually um that talk that have
02:30 - different uh tutorials in them and so
02:33 - one is called tutorial Madness and there
02:35 - must be there must be at least like 300
02:38 - tutorials in there it's Madness and so
02:40 - there's there's there's scratch
02:41 - tutorials there's sort of artwork
02:43 - tutorials there's even a Photoshop
02:45 - tutorial in there outside of scratch too
02:47 - yeah and then there's another there's
02:48 - another studio called scratch tutorials
02:50 - that has I think like 20 or 30 sort of
02:53 - scratch specific tutorials that are I
02:55 - think worth checking out yeah so you
02:56 - might go and like learn something new as
02:58 - well so uh if you haven't found uh
03:02 - starter projects in scratch we have
03:03 - these starter projects that are fairly
03:05 - simple but they show different things
03:07 - that you can do with scratch for example
03:09 - video sensing one of my favorite video
03:12 - sensing starter projects is one where
03:13 - you're trying to lift a pizza up and
03:14 - keep it up you can use your hands you
03:16 - can use your head and uh other projects
03:19 - there's some interactive art projects
03:21 - and you can use like your internal mic
03:23 - to do some really cool artwork um one of
03:25 - my other favorites is a dance project so
03:28 - you can show some moves and code with
03:30 - music you saw my moves last week um well
03:33 - what's cool about starter projects is
03:36 - there's actually something in there for
03:37 - everyone even scratchers like I've been
03:39 - around for a while you've been around
03:40 - for a while but it's cool because
03:41 - there's sort of different genres like
03:42 - for instance video sensing is something
03:44 - I didn't know a lot about so I think
03:46 - everyone can learn something from the
03:47 - stter projects yeah cool cool so that
03:50 - brings us to the message we did a drum
03:52 - roll last time I thought that was cool
03:54 - okay our message from the scratch team
03:57 - and we thought we'd build on top of last
03:58 - week's tour of kind of the scratch
04:01 - headquarters there's one that we just
04:02 - kind of had to pass by fairly quickly
04:05 - which is Em's office but inside there's
04:08 - some pretty cool things it looks like a
04:10 - normal office but I think we'll show you
04:12 - some really neat things inside as well
04:14 - cool let's see it welcome to my office
04:17 - I'm Mitch Resnik M res on the scratch
04:19 - website let me show you around my office
04:21 - see over here on the Whiteboard I like
04:22 - to collect some letters that I get about
04:24 - scratch here's one from a proud scratch
04:26 - parent there's a note that I got from a
04:28 - scratch work shop in Italy from one of
04:30 - the kids who was there there's a letter
04:32 - I got just yesterday from a scratcher in
04:34 - Tennessee love getting those letters uh
04:37 - here's some also some different scratch
04:39 - items that people have made there's a
04:40 - great scratch hat that some from Mexico
04:43 - made uh or when I went to Japan they
04:46 - gave me a nice scratch
04:48 - fan actually over here we have a bunch
04:50 - of books that have been written about
04:52 - scratch it's exciting that people around
04:53 - the world are writing books about
04:55 - scratch here's one from
04:58 - Japan here's one from
05:00 - China actually here's a very special
05:02 - book it was made by a former member of
05:04 - the scratch team Tommy Stern and it
05:07 - shows different stages of the
05:09 - development of scratch when we started
05:10 - 10 years ago of how scratch has evolved
05:13 - over the last decade if you come on the
05:16 - table here you have some special treats
05:19 - these are little crafty scratch
05:22 - cats made made with pipe cleaners any
05:25 - hope you enjoyed tour of the office I
05:27 - look forward to seeing you on the
05:28 - scratch website and keep on scratching
05:31 - so that about wraps up our scratch video
05:33 - update cool what should we do now I
05:35 - think we should probably find that ruler
05:37 - to keep this going up so we're going to
05:38 - go back in the snow see you later see
05:41 - you next week oh there it is we found
05:44 - the
05:45 - ruler yes right
