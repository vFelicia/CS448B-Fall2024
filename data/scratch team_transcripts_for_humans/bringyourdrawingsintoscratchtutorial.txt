00:16 - or photograph.
00:20 - For instance,
00:21 - I'm going to upload Starry Night

00:25 - You can use a 
JPEG, PNG, or SVG file.
00:28 - Please keep each of your files
under ten megabytes.
00:31 - Do not upload
materials under copyright.
00:34 - And be sure that your upload
follows the Community Guidelines
00:37 - and does not reveal
personal information.
00:39 - Let's say
I only need part of this image.
00:41 - Let's just crop out the moon.
00:43 - I can use tools
such as the Eraser tool,
00:46 - and I can erase around 
the moon carefully
00:48 - to remove those pixels
that I don't want.
00:51 - I can then use this Select tool
to select
00:53 - big chunks of the drawing that
I don't want and delete them.
00:56 - There are two modes
for drawing in Scratch.
00:58 - Bitmap mode allows you to edit
photos and paint with pixels.
01:02 - Vector mode allows you
to create and edit shapes.
01:06 - JPEG and PNG 
upload in bitmap mode.
01:09 - SVG upload in vector mode.
01:12 - You'll know if you are in bitmap
or vector mode
01:15 - because there is a button
at the bottom of the screen
01:18 - that will say “convert to
bitmap” or “convert to vector.”
01:22 - Or perhaps I've made a drawing
of my own that I want to upload.
01:25 - This mouse has been edited
so that there's no
01:28 - white background.
01:29 - It is best
01:30 - if the images you choose
have a transparent background,
01:33 - such as a PNG with a transparent
background or SVG file.
01:37 - You can remove the background
using the tools in the 
01:39 - Scratch paint editor
after a file has been uploaded,
01:42 - or before you upload the file,
using online tools or software.
01:47 - I chose to draw the wheels
separately.
01:49 - If I upload the wheels
01:50 - as a separate piece
of the drawing,
01:52 - I can always add code in order
to make them move.
01:55 - When the green flag is clicked,
forever turn.
01:59 - That mouse is on the go.
02:00 - Let's make a second wheel.
02:01 - I'm going to right
click on my wheel sprite
02:04 - and duplicate,
drag it to where I want,
02:07 - and now
that mouse is on the move.
02:09 - The possibilities are endless.
What will you create?

Let's explore creating a sprite in the Scratch editor using an uploaded original, handdrawn image or photograph. For instance, I'm going to upload Starry Night by Vincent van Gogh. You can use a JPEG, PNG, or SVG file. Please keep each of your files under ten megabytes. Do not upload materials under copyright. And be sure that your upload follows the Community Guidelines and does not reveal personal information. Let's say I only need part of this image. Let's just crop out the moon. I can use tools such as the Eraser tool, and I can erase around the moon carefully to remove those pixels that I don't want. I can then use this Select tool to select big chunks of the drawing that I don't want and delete them. There are two modes for drawing in Scratch. Bitmap mode allows you to edit photos and paint with pixels. Vector mode allows you to create and edit shapes. JPEG and PNG upload in bitmap mode. SVG upload in vector mode. You'll know if you are in bitmap or vector mode because there is a button at the bottom of the screen that will say “convert to bitmap” or “convert to vector.” Or perhaps I've made a drawing of my own that I want to upload.
