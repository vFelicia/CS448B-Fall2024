00:00 - hi everyone I'm Rick Rose also known as
00:02 - Rick Rose on scratch hi I'm Eric also
00:05 - known as speak visually on Scratch and
00:07 - welcome to
00:15 - the that was so awesome hey everyone uh
00:18 - welcome again to the scratch video
00:20 - update uh we're joining you in Paris
00:22 - France uh we took a hop over from
00:24 - scratch conference in Amsterdam to Paris
00:27 - uh to film here well if you're wondering
00:29 - what the scratch conf conference is uh
00:31 - it's an opportunity for teachers
00:32 - developers and researchers to come
00:34 - together to talk about scratch and share
00:36 - different resources and ideas and um by
00:39 - the way that's notredam behind that's
00:41 - the notredam cathedral in the center of
00:42 - par is yeah and uh so we're going to
00:45 - show you some clips of our Reflections
00:47 - from The Experience starting with our
00:48 - love it the loveed section oh gosh the
00:50 - love section from scratch conference one
00:52 - of the Keynotes that was offered was
00:54 - done by Linda Lucas who's an author uh
00:57 - she created this amazing children's book
01:00 - uh that she's going to tell you about
01:01 - and she wanted to create a book uh to
01:03 - introduce young kids to computational
01:05 - culture and thinking in a friendly and
01:07 - fun way cool so here's Linda let's check
01:09 - it out my name is Linda luas I'm a
01:11 - children's book author and illustrator
01:13 - and I write stories about computers and
01:16 - the computational thinking world and and
01:18 - this is my first book it's about a
01:20 - little uh girl called Ruby and her best
01:22 - friend the computer and here you can see
01:27 - Ruby in her own little room and can you
01:29 - recognize who is on Ruby's wall but Ruby
01:33 - is actually a really special little girl
01:35 - because when her dad tells her that she
01:37 - needs to dress up for school she does
01:39 - dress up but she leaves her pajamas on
01:41 - because Dad didn't specifically tell her
01:43 - to take the pajamas off and when Ruby is
01:45 - told that oh your room is such a mess
01:47 - you need to clean up all your toys they
01:49 - are everywhere she does clean up the
01:51 - toys but she leaves her pens and papers
01:53 - on the floor because pens and papers are
01:55 - not really toys and in the same way when
01:57 - you give instructions to a computer you
01:59 - need to give them in the right order uh
02:01 - in the right sequence be very specific
02:03 - with the names and yeah that way you'll
02:06 - be able to instruct also Ruby for
02:08 - early very very cool okay so I think one
02:11 - of my Levits from the conference we had
02:13 - what was called a poster session which
02:15 - is essentially people working on cool
02:17 - things set up a booth and they sort of
02:19 - talked about what it is they're doing
02:20 - with scratch and so a lot of things
02:22 - stuck out but maybe just to mention a
02:24 - couple one was a uh a a device in which
02:28 - it could it could track when you were
02:29 - linking uh and uh a young person his his
02:33 - mom is a doctor and works with someone
02:36 - who can't actually move their limbs or
02:38 - speak and so using this device uh when
02:41 - she blinked the scratch project would
02:43 - move on a letter and she could actually
02:45 - communicate via blinking through a
02:47 - scratch project which I thought was like
02:48 - a really inspiring use of scratch in the
02:50 - real world uh and so that made me think
02:53 - uh a lot and uh I have to say I was
02:56 - really excited so scratch on tablets is
02:59 - like a thing that's being worked on and
03:00 - so some of the developers on the scratch
03:02 - team uh showed off the early stage demo
03:06 - of scratch on tablets and it is very
03:08 - cool there's still more work that needs
03:09 - to be done but it was there and then one
03:12 - final thing uh is so the scratch is
03:14 - you're always using it on the computer
03:16 - screen but uh someone said oh how cool
03:18 - would it be if you actually like took
03:20 - blocks in real life and put them
03:22 - together and ran uh like a a scratch
03:25 - project so they this one guy had a
03:27 - device where you can put scratch blocks
03:29 - on this sort of panel and then it would
03:31 - make this horse Spin and so you can
03:33 - program like with with using your hands
03:35 - which was really cool cool so now let's
03:37 - move on to our next session things to
03:40 - try things to try all the way in France
03:43 - and so one thing to try is also we ran
03:46 - into Eric rosenbom who's the co-creator
03:48 - of miy Makey and he had a new project to
03:50 - share called Beetle blocks and um Eric
03:53 - is going to show us a quick clip of what
03:55 - that looks like hi I'm Eric Rosen bomb
03:59 - I'm former member of the scratch team
04:01 - you may know me as Eric r on scratch
04:04 - also co-inventor of the Makey Makey uh
04:08 - but now I'm going to show you my project
04:09 - Beetle blocks which is like scratch for
04:13 - 3D printing you can write some code
04:16 - which generates a 3D shape which you can
04:18 - then print out uh so I'll show you how
04:21 - that works a little bit so over here
04:25 - there's a little
04:28 - beetle the beetle we can make move
04:30 - around using the blocks so I click on
04:32 - this move block mle takes a step forward
04:36 - the rotate block makes it
04:39 - turn and then I can make it put a little
04:43 - Cube down at each
04:46 - step and then I can use the repeat
04:52 - block to make it put those cubes around
04:55 - a
04:57 - ring so what else can you do
05:00 - um this
05:02 - project makes a hexagon and then rotates
05:06 - the hexagon and scales it so it makes it
05:09 - bigger as it rotates around pretty cool
05:14 - shape um this
05:17 - is a beetle blocks snail and here is a
05:23 - little
05:28 - Beetle so you can try it out at be
05:30 - blocks.com we're still working on it um
05:32 - we'd love to hear your feedback cool and
05:35 - so I think my things to try you know I'm
05:37 - always talking about the scratch Design
05:38 - Studios and so we do have a new scratch
05:40 - design studio uh it's around the theme
05:42 - of custom blocks so make a block uh and
05:45 - if you're not familiar with makeup Block
05:46 - it's just you can actually Define your
05:48 - own custom block and scratch uh and if
05:50 - you're not familiar with custom blocks
05:52 - don't worry because the scratch Design
05:53 - Studio curators have created two
05:55 - projects that will help you learn more
05:57 - about custom block so I encourage you
05:58 - all to check it out yeah awesome
06:00 - actually one other thing I'd add about
06:02 - Eric's project is that it's still in the
06:03 - very very early stages so it might be a
06:05 - little glitchy Beetle blocks it's in the
06:07 - early stages very cool though we'll
06:08 - share a link okay so now we'll move on
06:10 - to message from the scratch team yes
06:13 - we're drumming okay we're drumming oh
06:14 - yeah yeah yeah sorry so one of the
06:16 - Keynotes that emres uh delivered also
06:19 - known as Mitchell Resnik uh we thought
06:21 - it was a great message to the community
06:22 - and we thought we shareed with you and
06:24 - he wanted to talk about why coding and
06:26 - why scratch and he talked about three
06:28 - ideas to you know to think about why why
06:31 - we code and one was your voice you know
06:34 - expressing yourself another was thinking
06:36 - and how the ways that coding can help
06:38 - you think in creative ways and finally
06:41 - identity and how you can see yourself as
06:43 - a Creator and see the ways that you can
06:45 - shape the world and we thought that was
06:47 - a beautiful message to share with uh
06:49 - with everybody else so I think as a
06:52 - final thing yeah and as a final thing so
06:54 - in the spirit of voice we actually
06:56 - walked around uh the scratch conference
06:58 - which is very International
07:00 - and we wanted to hear from the
07:01 - participants in the scratch Pro uh
07:03 - scratch conference if there were three
07:05 - words that in which you can describe
07:07 - scratch how would you define scratch uh
07:10 - and so check out we got about six or
07:12 - seven people to to say what they what
07:14 - they thought scratch was yeah they had a
07:15 - really hard time but I guess anybody
07:18 - else would okay all right so we'll end
07:20 - with that and we'll see you in a month
07:23 - all right scratch on scratch on bye
07:25 - three words that I think of when I think
07:28 - of scratch are programming creativity
07:30 - and
07:35 - fun creativity freedom and teamwork
07:58 - [Music]
08:00 - me

Cleaned transcript:

hi everyone I'm Rick Rose also known as Rick Rose on scratch hi I'm Eric also known as speak visually on Scratch and welcome to the that was so awesome hey everyone uh welcome again to the scratch video update uh we're joining you in Paris France uh we took a hop over from scratch conference in Amsterdam to Paris uh to film here well if you're wondering what the scratch conf conference is uh it's an opportunity for teachers developers and researchers to come together to talk about scratch and share different resources and ideas and um by the way that's notredam behind that's the notredam
