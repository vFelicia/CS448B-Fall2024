00:00 - - Hi everyone.
00:01 - It's Zoë from the Scratch team,
00:02 - also known as Zinnea.
00:03 - Today, I wanted to show you how to make
00:05 - a character designer in Scratch.
00:07 - Basically, it's a kind of
project where the player
00:10 - can customize their own
character of whatever kind.
00:12 - If you've ever seen a game that's like,
00:14 - make your own cupcake
or design your own fox,
00:17 - this is that type of game.
00:18 - And by the end of this
video, you'll be able
00:20 - to make your own game like this.
00:22 - Let's get started.
00:23 - So first, let's pick
what you want the theme
00:25 - of your project to be.
00:27 - Do you want to make a
design your own cat game
00:29 - or design your own dragon
or design your own outfit?
00:32 - It can be anything you want.
00:33 - As an example, I'm going to
make a create your own dog game
00:37 - but this video will work no
matter what theme you pick.
00:39 - So first we're going to draw one version
00:42 - of the character in our game.
00:43 - If you haven't drawn much in Scratch
00:44 - or you don't really enjoy
drawing, don't worry.
00:46 - I'm gonna show you a drawing style
00:48 - that's really easy to do,
00:49 - and actually doesn't require
any drawing experience.
00:52 - To draw a character, I'll hover over
00:54 - Choose a Sprite and click Paint.
00:57 - Here's the drawing style
I find really easy to use.
01:00 - I basically make the character
out of simple circles.
01:03 - I'm making a dog, so I will click
01:05 - on the circle tool and drag out
01:09 - the ovalish circle thing to be the head.
01:10 - Then I'll click on this purple square
01:12 - to change the color to black.
01:14 - And now I'm gonna draw
small circles for the eyes.
01:17 - One thing I like to do is
once I've drawn the first eye,
01:20 - I will click on it and click
copy and then click paste.
01:24 - And now I have a second eye
01:25 - which I can just put over here.
01:26 - So I could have a purple dog in my game
01:28 - but I think I want the
dog's fur to be brown.
01:31 - To change the color of the circle,
01:32 - I just have to click on it to select it
01:35 - and then click this square again.
01:36 - To make a brown color,
01:38 - I'll switch the color up here
01:39 - to something in the orange
section of the rainbow
01:42 - and then I can change the brightness
01:44 - to get a darker shade of brown.
01:46 - Okay, so now I want to give the dog
01:48 - sort of fluffy ears.
01:49 - How do you make shapes
that aren't circles?
01:52 - What you can do is make a
circle with the circle tool
01:55 - and then click on the point editing tool.
01:58 - And you can click and drag on
these points to mold the shape
02:03 - into the shape you want it.
02:05 - So to make floppy ears, I'll
drag this point over here
02:09 - and maybe this goes over
here and I can also click
02:12 - on a point and move these
arrows to control the shape
02:16 - around that point.
02:17 - So that's how I draw
shapes that aren't circles.
02:19 - I start with a circle
02:20 - and then I'll just move
the points a little bit.
02:23 - And now that I've drawn
one ear, I can click on it
02:25 - and just like with the eyes,
I can click copy and paste.
02:29 - And then now I have a second ear
02:30 - and I can also click flip horizontal
02:33 - so that it's pointing in this direction.
02:34 - Now I'll set the color to pink
02:36 - and draw a circle to give my dog
02:38 - on nose and I'll use the eyedropper tool
02:40 - to get the same color I used
02:42 - for the head and draw
a circle for the body.
02:46 - And I'll drag these
points down a little bit
02:48 - so it looks like it's sitting down
02:49 - and I'll give the dog a tail.
02:51 - So for that, I'll make a circle
02:53 - and then move this point
this way and move this.
02:58 - Okay, so we've drawn one
version of our character
03:01 - and you, of course, don't
have to draw what I did.
03:02 - It can have totally different parts.
03:04 - You could have one of
the parts be the donut
03:06 - and one be the frosting on the donut
03:07 - or cat ears and a cat's face
03:09 - or an ice cream cone
and an ice cream scoop.
03:11 - And you can make all these shapes
03:13 - out of really simple
circles and rectangles.
03:15 - So how do we make this a
character designer game
03:18 - where the player can actually
modify the character?
03:20 - So you see how the character is made up
03:22 - of these different parts?
03:24 - I'm going to take each of these parts
03:26 - and put it in its own Sprite
03:27 - like a Sprite for the ears
and a Sprite for the tail.
03:30 - And then the player will be
able to mix and match them.
03:33 - So here's how you do that.
03:34 - Pick one thing that's going to
be a part of your character.
03:37 - So for me, the tail will be one part.
03:39 - I'll select the tail.
03:41 - I'll click copy.
03:43 - And now I'm going to
hover over choose a Sprite
03:47 - and click paint to paint a new Sprite
03:50 - and then I'll click paste.
03:53 - And there you go.
03:54 - Now you have a Sprite
03:55 - with just the tail.
03:57 - I'll name this Sprite, tail.
03:58 - So let's do that for
all the other parts too.
04:00 - So I'll go back to my base character.
04:02 - I want both the ears to be one part.
04:04 - So to copy them both
04:05 - I can click on one ear,
then hold down shift.
04:09 - And while I'm holding down
shift, click on the other ear.
04:12 - And that way I select both of them,
04:14 - and then I'll press copy again
04:17 - and make a new Sprite
and then click paste.
04:20 - There you go.
04:21 - I will call this one ears.
04:22 - I will select the eyes and the nose
04:24 - and copy them and make that be the face.
04:28 - And I will copy the head and
body and make that be the body.
04:33 - Oh, and I'm also going
to pick a background.
04:35 - You can use any background you want.
04:36 - I'll use stripes.
04:39 - Okay, now I have all the parts
04:41 - of my character as individual Sprites.
04:43 - Let's hide the base character.
04:45 - We don't need it anymore.
04:46 - Now that we have all the pieces.
04:47 - So we want to make all these
pieces go to the same spot.
04:51 - We don't want like the ears over here.
04:52 - So here's how I do that.
04:54 - I'll click on one of the
sprites, like the body
04:56 - and make it go to a
certain position like 0,0
05:01 - and I'll make it go there
05:02 - when the green flag is clicked.
05:03 - And then for each of the
other pieces like the tail,
05:06 - I'll make that piece go to the body.
05:08 - When the green flag is clicked.
05:11 - So now the tail goes to
the same spot as the body.
05:13 - I'll give that same code
to all of the pieces.
05:16 - Ah, one problem is that the
face is behind the body.
05:20 - So for any Sprite that you
want to be at the front,
05:22 - you just need to give it
this code, go to front layer
05:25 - and I want the tail to be behind the body.
05:28 - So I'll give it the
code, go to back layer.
05:31 - Okay, we have all our pieces
starting in the same spot.
05:33 - Now comes the really fun part.
05:34 - We get to draw all the different options
05:37 - that the player can choose from.
05:38 - So I'll go to the ears
05:40 - and I'll add a new costume and draw a pair
05:43 - of pointy ears 'cause that could be
05:44 - a different option for the dog.
05:46 - You can start with a circle and
then move these points down.
05:49 - I will click copy and then paste.
05:51 - And I can also flip it this way.
05:54 - I sometimes need to move them
05:55 - so that they are
positioned right the head.
05:57 - And I can also add
different color options.
05:59 - So if I duplicate this costume,
06:01 - I can just set the ears
to a different color
06:03 - and you can have whatever colors you want.
06:05 - You could have purple
ears, blue ears, pink ears.
06:06 - It's your game.
06:08 - Now let's make it so that the player
06:09 - can actually switch between the ears.
06:11 - If we go to the code tab,
06:13 - we can use this next costume
block to switch between them.
06:17 - And how about we make it do
that when the ears are clicked.
06:20 - So now the player can click
on the ears to change them.
06:23 - And you can basically do this
with all the different pieces.
06:26 - So let's design a few
other options for the body.
06:28 - Maybe I'll switch the color
to a different shade of brown
06:31 - and add a white patch on the belly.
06:33 - And for the body, I'll also make it go
06:35 - to the next costume when
the Sprite is clicked.
06:38 - So there you go.
06:39 - Now you have a game where the player
06:40 - can customize their character.
06:41 - Now, if you don't feel like drawing,
06:43 - I'll show you another way of doing this
06:44 - that doesn't take any drawing at all.
06:46 - You can always pick a base Sprite
06:48 - from the Sprite library.
06:49 - So maybe I'll pick the penguin.
06:51 - And then we have a lot of Sprites
06:53 - that are items of clothing.
06:54 - You can find them in the fashion category.
06:56 - So I'll choose the party hat and add that.
06:59 - And then you can make
this item that you added
07:01 - change costume when you click it.
07:03 - So now I can customize my little penguin.
07:06 - So you can still totally
make this kind of project
07:08 - if you don't feel like drawing.
07:09 - And also, there's a link
07:10 - to this starter project that I made today
07:12 - in the video description below
07:14 - so you can always remix that
07:16 - and modify it to make your own project.
07:17 - Anyway, that's what I
wanted to show you today.
07:19 - I hope you have fun making
character designer projects.
07:21 - I cannot wait to see them.
07:23 - I'll see you next time and Scratch on.
