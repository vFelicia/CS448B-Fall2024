00:00 - um okay yes we have 22 viewers now hello
00:02 - everyone uh welcome back in
00:04 - um i think maybe i'll uh pick up
00:07 - now um yeah i think i think we'll just
00:11 - resume here uh like youtube never
00:13 - interrupted our stream but that's
00:14 - that's fine we're all figuring things
00:16 - out here uh so
00:18 - okay where were we uh where we were was
00:21 - that i was telling you that
00:22 - today the prompt of today is uh creating
00:26 - a story
00:26 - uh so the idea is that
00:30 - you can make a a story of any kind i'm
00:33 - not sure when the stream
00:35 - uh broke off so i'm not sure if i'm
00:37 - repeating myself
00:38 - uh so let me you can send me in the
00:41 - google form if uh
00:42 - if i'm repeating myself too much but
00:44 - basically the idea of today is that
00:46 - you can make absolutely any kind of
00:48 - story you could interpret it in any
00:49 - direction
00:50 - the uh making characters talk to each
00:53 - other
00:53 - um making uh uh
00:56 - like uh a character just go between
00:59 - multiple backgrounds
01:00 - it could be a totally random story i'm
01:02 - gonna show you how to do a random story
01:04 - with
01:04 - two uh objects from my house um
01:07 - and uh yeah that is the idea for today
01:12 - um but i will start by uh
01:15 - showing you how to um
01:18 - open up scratch and make a scratch
01:21 - studio
01:21 - um and thank you everyone so much for
01:23 - bearing with the technical difficulties
01:25 - i'm glad we got the stream back going
01:27 - and we've got
01:28 - lots of you here i hope more people will
01:30 - keep joining um
01:32 - so uh edit
01:34 - [Music]
01:38 - um all right so uh let me show you
01:41 - how to open up
01:46 - scratch.mit.edu
01:48 - uh so let me switch to uh showing the
01:52 - url so you're gonna go to uh
01:56 - scratch.mit.edu
01:58 - uh and then uh you're going to
02:01 - uh go to uh this link up here that says
02:05 - create uh just click on that and you can
02:07 - also go to this url
02:10 - scratch.mit.edu create i'll keep this
02:12 - url up for a few moments but i will try
02:14 - not to keep it up for too long
02:15 - uh the i know every past time i have
02:18 - forgotten and left the url
02:19 - up it's all the learning process here
02:22 - we're uh we're figuring it all out um so
02:25 - yes
02:27 - scratch.mit.edu create and that will
02:29 - open up
02:30 - uh this page which is the uh scratch
02:32 - editor
02:33 - um so uh the scratch editor in case you
02:37 - haven't
02:37 - seen it before or if it's been a while
02:40 - um i'll give you just
02:41 - a little uh uh explanation of
02:44 - sort of how it works and then i'll show
02:46 - you how to start
02:47 - making a story also if you're already
02:50 - you know ready to get started on your
02:51 - creative story project you could totally
02:53 - do that
02:54 - um but for anybody who would like to
02:56 - here's a little explanation of
02:58 - scratch so in scratch
03:01 - you have these uh characters uh down
03:04 - here right now we have
03:05 - just the one this cat and you have all
03:08 - these
03:09 - blocks over here on the left that you
03:11 - can
03:12 - click on to make the characters do
03:15 - things so
03:16 - this one uh says turn 15 degrees and
03:19 - when i click on it
03:20 - the cat is a turn and a turn
03:24 - um so you can drag these
03:27 - this is sort of like the menu of options
03:30 - you can pick from
03:31 - there's tons of them and you can drag
03:33 - that into here
03:34 - to sort of work with with these blocks
03:38 - so you know here i can click it have the
03:40 - cat turn
03:41 - uh you can try out other ones this one
03:43 - says go to random position
03:46 - click on that and makes the cat go to a
03:48 - random position
03:49 - um and there's all these different
03:51 - categories these
03:52 - uh blocks are in the motion category
03:56 - so they're kind of affecting how the cat
03:58 - moves but there's other stuff like
04:00 - you can affect the looks of the cat so
04:03 - you can go down see what's here there's
04:05 - this one says
04:06 - change size by 10. you could click that
04:08 - and now we have a
04:10 - cat that is getting bigger um you can
04:13 - combine them so there's this block that
04:16 - says
04:16 - change color effect by 25 and so if i
04:20 - i now have attached it to this change
04:22 - size by 10 block and now if i click the
04:24 - both of them
04:25 - it gets bigger change the size by 10 and
04:27 - it changes the color
04:28 - uh by like 25 around the color wheel 25
04:32 - degrees i think
04:33 - so or something like that so um
04:36 - anyway this great colorful cat we have
04:39 - that's
04:40 - like the basic idea of scratch
04:43 - which is you have all of these blocks
04:46 - that are things for characters to do and
04:48 - then if you have a character
04:50 - you can use the blocks and make them do
04:52 - these things
04:53 - and you can also this cat is the default
04:55 - character it comes with but you can also
04:57 - click on you know what i did that kind
04:59 - of fast and it's going to take a long
05:00 - time to go back because
05:02 - my computer is chugging but um
05:05 - and you know what maybe i hope you all
05:07 - have this link here that
05:09 - um uh scratch.mit.edu
05:12 - create and i will take it down now
05:15 - but if you do need a help
05:18 - still finding link if you join later in
05:20 - the stream uh just write into the google
05:22 - form and i'll put the link back up or
05:23 - i'll i'll tell it to you
05:24 - uh so hiding the link ha ha
05:27 - it's done uh so
05:31 - um the uh you you can
05:34 - hover over this button here that says
05:36 - choose a sprite click on that
05:39 - and add any character that you might
05:42 - like to
05:43 - you know you could add uh this character
05:45 - avery um
05:47 - walking next to this uh very large
05:50 - colorful cat
05:51 - um so you can and now you might wonder
05:54 - oh
05:54 - where did all of those blocks go that we
05:56 - put out for the scratch cat
05:58 - they only apply to the scratch cat so if
06:01 - you click on the scratch cat's little
06:02 - icon here then they didn't go anywhere
06:04 - you can see them right here
06:05 - um but avery we haven't made any any
06:08 - blocks
06:09 - for avery and these if we but if we now
06:11 - that we've clicked on avery if we put
06:12 - out blocks here
06:13 - they'll affect avery so you can drag out
06:15 - this block that says say hello for two
06:17 - seconds
06:19 - now if we click on that avery is the one
06:21 - who says hello so
06:23 - that's the basic basic idea of scratch
06:26 - um now how might one create a story in
06:30 - scratch
06:31 - well we happen to have a tutorial that
06:35 - is pretty useful for this
06:36 - it is actually called create a story
06:39 - um let me open up a new scratch project
06:44 - i'm just gonna go to scratch.mit.edu
06:47 - create to make a new scratch project
06:50 - um and if you're joining just now the
06:53 - stream welcome we had a little bit of
06:54 - technical difficulties but i think we're
06:56 - back on track thank you so much
06:58 - everybody for
06:58 - bearing with us as we learn what youtube
07:01 - does and does not
07:02 - consider a reason to cancel a live
07:04 - stream uh yes
07:06 - very grateful to everyone for bearing
07:08 - with as
07:09 - our uh you know you know this is just we
07:11 - were creating a story today

07:15 - stream happen so you've all been part of
07:17 - the story
07:19 - um so uh yes but if you wanted to create
07:22 - a story
07:23 - in your scratch project open up this
07:26 - scratch project
07:27 - and uh you can click on tutorials this
07:30 - button up here
07:32 - and you'll get all these tutorials we
07:33 - have and right here
07:35 - uh we have create a story you can click
07:38 - on that
07:39 - and then this window will pop up you
07:41 - could watch the video the video will
07:43 - explain some stuff about creating a
07:45 - story um
07:46 - but you can also if you click this green
07:48 - arrow here
07:50 - you can walk through the steps of the
07:52 - tutorial
07:53 - so uh you can so this first step
07:57 - says to add a backdrop and i do think
07:59 - that's a nice
08:00 - uh first step for making a story
08:03 - uh i actually helped make this tutorial
08:06 - so i feel a little
08:07 - uh bad saying that's a great first step
08:10 - but i think it is a pretty good one uh
08:13 - so yeah you can hover over this choose a
08:16 - backdrop
08:16 - button and then uh pick
08:20 - any backdrop you would like if there's
08:22 - one that sort of sparks your imagination
08:24 - and you're like okay i want to tell a
08:25 - back a story where the backdrop is
08:27 - castle 3 or colorful city click on that
08:30 - one
08:30 - uh i'm not sure exactly what story i
08:32 - want to do yet but this
08:33 - one blue sky i feel like is a very good
08:36 - backdrop that could go to
08:37 - many many many kinds of stories um so
08:40 - i'll just pick that for now i like blue
08:41 - sky a lot
08:42 - um and so then you can click the next
08:44 - the arrow here to see the next steps the
08:46 - next one is add a character
08:48 - uh so let us hover over this button
08:51 - and click choose and we can add
08:54 - a character for our story and i think
08:56 - this is uh one place where you can be
08:58 - like okay
08:59 - uh what what kind of story do i want to
09:02 - do
09:02 - uh maybe um let's see
09:06 - uh you can i'll let you do the bat oh
09:09 - and i just saw a question coming in i
09:11 - have no story ideas can you help with
09:12 - prompts
09:13 - yes uh i i will i will help with prompts
09:16 - hi flower
09:17 - uh who sent that in um i will help with
09:19 - prompts uh very soon
09:21 - uh that's a great idea um so uh yes okay
09:24 - so we've added a character
09:26 - um and you know now uh let's go to the
09:29 - next step
09:30 - and so this one has is uh say something
09:33 - where to put this window i think that's
09:35 - an okay place to put it for now
09:37 - um so uh it says
09:40 - to uh okay purple uh say
09:44 - block it's gonna be the looks category
09:46 - because it sort of matches that color
09:48 - so uh say this one says
09:52 - say welcome oh you know what let me make
09:53 - the size a little bit bigger this one
09:55 - says
09:56 - you could have it say welcome to magic
09:57 - school but you can have it say whatever
09:59 - you want and now i have this bat
10:01 - here uh so uh maybe y'all have in the
10:04 - back we've got the bat in the cat uh so
10:05 - maybe i'll have
10:06 - the bat say um uh
10:10 - um how is your
10:13 - day scratch cat
10:17 - um yeah so now that that
10:20 - has a little bit of dialogue and then it
10:22 - also says you can
10:23 - add this uh yellow when green flag
10:25 - clicked block on top so
10:27 - that that matches this color so i will
10:30 - go in and add
10:31 - that and what that does is now uh
10:34 - you can click the green flag to make it
10:36 - happen and this is useful because
10:38 - you could have lots and lots of
10:40 - different characters doing things that
10:41 - start when the green flag is clicked so
10:43 - you can
10:43 - start all of that by just clicking the
10:46 - green flag if you add this
10:48 - uh when green flag clicked block to
10:50 - start the
10:51 - the this same block so
10:54 - that's the the first step of this create
10:56 - a story tutorial that i just wanted to
10:58 - walk through it um oh i just saw a
11:01 - question
11:02 - come in that i can answer pretty quickly
11:03 - that says how can you change the color
11:05 - of the sky
11:06 - it's a great question um and you click
11:09 - on the stage
11:10 - um so yeah the to change the color of
11:13 - the sky uh you can click on the stage
11:15 - here which is like where all the
11:16 - backdrops are stored
11:18 - and then right up here there's this
11:21 - backdrops
11:22 - tab so you can click on that
11:25 - and then you can click on this
11:28 - uh uh this
11:31 - chunk that is the sky and then you can
11:34 - go
11:35 - up here to this color section the
11:38 - color square and then change it to
11:40 - whatever color you want so maybe you
11:41 - want a bit of a more
11:42 - blue blue or maybe it's a sort of a
11:45 - sunset
11:46 - times or so you want like an orange um
11:49 - and yeah basically you can just uh grab
11:52 - any shape and uh and change its color
11:56 - up here so you can also so purple sky
11:59 - you can also click
12:00 - on this fill bucket and change the color
12:03 - so if you want a green sky
12:05 - uh you can do that so yeah that's how
12:07 - you can change the color of the sky
12:08 - make it your own um uh so let me so
12:12 - flower asked um can i help with story
12:15 - prompts
12:15 - yes uh let's see let's think of a few
12:18 - props
12:19 - and actually if you se if you want to
12:21 - send in
12:22 - prompts that you come up with you could
12:23 - send them to the to the google form
12:25 - um let's see you could uh
12:28 - uh tell that you could have uh
12:31 - a character that you love like uh
12:35 - uh maybe like
12:38 - explaining to another character like i i
12:41 - don't know
12:41 - uh their backstory or kind of yeah like
12:44 - their history
12:46 - or uh something like that you could show
12:48 - a flashback
12:50 - um from characters like past
12:53 - uh that's like a prompt idea you could
12:56 - you could
12:56 - i i know i often show this but i think
12:58 - it's it can be nice for just getting
13:00 - ideas going
13:00 - you can click a couple by hovering over
13:04 - this button here you can click uh
13:06 - surprise
13:08 - and create a couple of random characters
13:10 - and you can also add a
13:12 - hover over this choose a backdrop and
13:14 - click uh surprise here oh my gosh oh
13:17 - someone
13:17 - anyways and you can get like random
13:19 - backdrops and you're like okay so why is
13:21 - the knight in the bedroom with giga
13:23 - who looks very very happy um and a
13:25 - scratch cat and a bat
13:27 - that can be a place to get an idea um oh
13:29 - okay uh i've got a couple of story ideas
13:31 - coming in
13:32 - someone said you could make a story
13:33 - about a dog trying to learn how to swim
13:35 - i love that uh and uh story idea it's
13:38 - safe patrick's day and you see a little
13:40 - green hat
13:41 - i love that too uh so yeah oh okay
13:44 - someone says uh do a castle story
13:46 - i am a huge fan of castle stories uh
13:49 - okay someone says
13:50 - i have an idea for a prompt scratch cat
13:52 - accidentally hits a button
13:54 - that teleports them into real life i
13:56 - love that
13:57 - oh my gosh these are all so good uh oh
14:01 - uh tell a story about a unicorn
14:03 - adventure someone says
14:04 - thank you for sending in all these story
14:05 - ideas um uh flower and anybody who
14:08 - is still wondering about an idea i hope
14:11 - uh that you can
14:12 - uh hope these have given you some ideas
14:14 - but i'll keep coming saying more ideas
14:16 - and keep going
14:17 - uh someone also asks uh oh your
14:20 - questions are so wonderful
14:21 - i love answering all these questions
14:23 - someone asks can i make an interactive
14:25 - story
14:26 - yes you totally can um and
14:29 - i uh can show you some ways of of doing
14:32 - that
14:33 - um oh there are such good questions i
14:34 - want to get to them all okay so yeah
14:36 - um uh can you make an interactive story
14:39 - totally
14:40 - let me show you a few ways you could
14:42 - make a story interactive um
14:44 - so and and and maybe in case you're
14:47 - wondering
14:48 - what uh do we mean by like what's an
14:50 - interactive story i guess it's it would
14:51 - be some kind of story
14:53 - where the player can who's watching it
14:56 - uh can kind of affect the story in some
15:00 - way or control when something happens
15:02 - um so uh yeah
15:06 - uh the the the
15:09 - there's a couple sort of quick ways in
15:12 - scratch to make a story interactive
15:14 - so one is this wonderful block uh when
15:17 - space key pressed so right now i'm in
15:19 - the back i
15:20 - did this i did this code for the bat
15:22 - where uh it's
15:23 - it says when green flag clicked say
15:25 - how's your day scratch cat
15:27 - but you could have instead of having
15:28 - that happen happen when the green flag
15:30 - is clicked you could have that
15:32 - when a key is pressed so i could just
15:34 - detach that this from there
15:36 - and put it here and now trust me i'm
15:38 - gonna press the space key
15:41 - every time the player presses the space
15:43 - key this bat will say
15:45 - this um you could also uh
15:48 - have the um you know you you could have
15:52 - uh something a character say something
15:54 - when it is clicked this is another one
15:56 - of my favorite ways to make a story
15:58 - interactive like really easily
16:00 - um so you can uh
16:03 - you can i you know let me get another
16:06 - thing um another block you could have
16:09 - um maybe when the bat is we're still in
16:13 - the bat so when this sprite clicked
16:15 - uh we could have it say um like
16:18 - oh hello there
16:22 - so now every time i click on the bat
16:26 - it says a little thing it's sort of like
16:28 - interactive because it's responding to
16:30 - me
16:31 - um so those are some ways of making it
16:34 - interactive and i'll
16:35 - show one more that i really love
16:38 - um so uh let's
16:42 - let's there is this block in the uh
16:45 - sensing category
16:46 - uh and sensing is basically a category
16:49 - full of lots of blocks
16:50 - that uh can be used to make your project
16:53 - interactive
16:54 - i almost think it would be really fun to
16:55 - do a live stream where i just
16:57 - kind of explain like show lots of ways
17:00 - of using
17:01 - these because they're they're they all
17:03 - have it's really cool stuff they can do
17:05 - but i think until you see it used it can
17:07 - be i i didn't really
17:09 - know how to approach these vlogs but let
17:11 - me show you a way of using
17:13 - one of my favorite ones in this category
17:15 - so
17:16 - uh you can let's let's let's go
17:19 - to uh the scratch cat let's have the
17:22 - scratch cat do this
17:23 - um the scratch cat you can
17:27 - drag out this block um ask
17:31 - make it bigger um ask what's your name
17:34 - and wait uh so
17:38 - the the if once this gets clicked on the
17:40 - scratch cat will say like what's your
17:41 - name
17:42 - and then i can say uh zoey
17:46 - but it doesn't do anything after that
17:48 - but so where did my answer
17:50 - go it is stored in this little round
17:53 - block called answer and you can always
17:56 - click on these rounded blocks
17:58 - to see uh what what
18:01 - that thing is so right now answer is
18:04 - zoe because that's what i wrote but
18:07 - what's cool is
18:08 - you remember those say blocks from
18:09 - earlier you can actually
18:11 - put the answer block
18:14 - into a say block because it has the same
18:16 - rounded shape so it actually
18:18 - fits inside it so i can drag out it
18:21 - saying hello and then i can drag out
18:23 - it's saying
18:26 - it's just put in answer so
18:29 - let's do now so what's your name zoe
18:33 - hello zoe so it
18:36 - it does something sort of responding to
18:38 - what i wrote um
18:40 - so anyway that is another one of my
18:42 - favorite ways of making a project
18:43 - interactive
18:44 - um anyway thanks for the question oh
18:47 - okay couple other
18:48 - questions coming in uh someone asks um
18:51 - how can you make a sprite appear or
18:53 - disappear
18:54 - this is a great question and can be
18:55 - useful in so many stories
18:57 - um let me show you in a new project so
19:00 - i'm going to scratch.mit.edu
19:03 - create um and
19:06 - uh and welcome to anyone joining now uh
19:08 - this is the create a long
19:10 - uh live stream episode three uh we're
19:12 - making story projects in this time
19:14 - together
19:15 - uh so yeah you can make any kind of
19:17 - story um and then you'll be able to
19:18 - share it if you want to at the end
19:21 - um and you can send in your questions if
19:22 - you want any help getting started
19:24 - getting ideas
19:25 - and i'll answer them if i can um
19:28 - so opening up a new project um and this
19:31 - is to show how to make a character
19:33 - disappear or appear
19:35 - so in the we've got the scratch cat here
19:38 - in the looks category we have he scroll
19:41 - down
19:42 - there are these blocks uh let me make
19:45 - this bigger
19:47 - uh show and hide
19:50 - so you can click on them to see what
19:53 - they do
19:54 - if you click hide this character you can
19:56 - see this
19:57 - after this eye turns to being like
19:58 - invisible it can't be seen
20:01 - uh so you can and then if you click the
20:02 - show block it shows up again it's like
20:05 - visible
20:05 - so you can hide and show a character
20:09 - um and make it appear and disappear with
20:12 - these blocks
20:13 - but uh so that's how the blocks you'd
20:15 - use to make a character appear and
20:17 - disappear but
20:18 - possibly even more useful is let me show
20:20 - you
20:21 - how you could use this so um
20:24 - let's let's let's say you want let's say
20:27 - so let's add a couple of backdrops to
20:29 - our project because i'll show you how
20:31 - let's say you wanted the scratch cat to
20:32 - appear in one backdrop
20:34 - and then disappear when you go to
20:36 - another backdrop because say you want it
20:38 - to be in one scene of your story but not
20:39 - the other one
20:40 - i'll show you how to do that right now
20:42 - so to do that let's get a couple of
20:44 - backdrops
20:45 - okay one um you know someone mentioned
20:47 - doing a castle story before i love that
20:49 - so i'm going to add
20:50 - castle 3. um and let's get another
20:54 - backdrop someone also mentioned having a
20:56 - dog who
20:58 - has to learn how to swim and so let me
21:00 - see if there's something
21:01 - that has a pool oh yes yes i remember i
21:04 - knew there had to be a pool background
21:06 - uh so we've got these two backgrounds um
21:09 - and you can you can click on the stage
21:12 - and go to backdrops to uh see the
21:15 - background drops you
21:16 - have you have we have castle three and
21:17 - we have pool and we can we have this
21:18 - blank one but i will
21:20 - delete that so
21:23 - um if let's go back to the scratch cat
21:26 - and go back to the code
21:28 - tab so uh let's say we
21:32 - want you can switch between backdrops
21:35 - with this uh switch you know what make
21:37 - this a tiny bit smaller
21:39 - you can switch between backdrops with
21:41 - this switch backdrop
21:43 - block so you can click right now it says
21:45 - switch backdrop to pool
21:47 - and switch to pool uh and i can actually
21:49 - also
21:50 - let me drag out another one because i
21:52 - can drag this out again
21:54 - and in this one pick castle 3
21:57 - and then i can this with this i can
21:59 - switch to castle three
22:00 - so this is an extremely useful block for
22:03 - controlling
22:04 - what the backdrop or what the scene of
22:06 - your of your uh story is
22:08 - so you can switch between them like this
22:11 - now let's say
22:12 - let me make this a little smaller again
22:14 - let's say that at the beginning
22:17 - of the project we want uh we'll say the
22:19 - beginning of the project we want the
22:20 - scratch cat to be at the castle
22:22 - and then and we want it to show up with
22:24 - this show block but then
22:26 - once it gets to the pool we want it to
22:28 - hide like let's say the scratch cat is
22:30 - not in the scene at the pool
22:32 - so when the green flag is clicked you
22:35 - can do
22:35 - switch backdrop oh we wanted it to start
22:38 - at the castle so
22:39 - when the green flag is clicked we'll
22:40 - have it start at the castle we'll switch
22:41 - the backdrop to that
22:43 - and then uh we'll and when
22:46 - the green flag is clicked uh
22:50 - you know how's the best way to do this
22:52 - uh maybe
22:53 - when the backdrop switches to the castle
22:57 - we'll have the scratch catch shut so
23:00 - uh it starts the backdrop switches to
23:02 - the castle and because the backdrop
23:04 - switched to the castle the scratch cat
23:05 - shows up
23:06 - and this this block that i just dragged
23:09 - out when backdrop switches to
23:11 - um can also be used to make it hide when
23:13 - we go to another scene
23:15 - so when the backdrop switches to pool
23:19 - we want the scratch cat to hide drag
23:21 - that out
23:22 - and so let's uh say
23:26 - uh so yeah let's just test it out i'm
23:28 - gonna click this and this will switch
23:29 - the backdrop to the pool
23:31 - so we switch to the pool and the scratch
23:32 - cat hides um
23:34 - but then if we if we restart the project
23:37 - and switch because that switches the
23:39 - backdrop to castle 3
23:41 - then the cat shows because when the
23:43 - backdrop switches to castle 3 it shows
23:45 - up
23:45 - um and then uh
23:49 - let's let's let's just test it all out
23:50 - by having when the project starts it'll
23:53 - wait one second at the castle and then
23:55 - switch the backdrop to the pool
23:57 - so it's gonna should start at the castle
24:00 - wait
24:00 - and then switch the pool and it should
24:03 - it has these instructions that say
24:05 - when it goes to the castle show up and
24:07 - when it switches to the pool
24:08 - hide so let's test it out it starts it's
24:11 - at the castle
24:12 - and it goes to the pool so i hope that
24:14 - helped as a way to
24:16 - make uh the make a character show and
24:19 - hide and how you could use that just to
24:21 - do different scenes
24:22 - um oh okay someone else asks um how to
24:26 - add sound when they talk uh so uh
24:29 - that's a great question uh let me go
24:31 - back to one of the ones where i had a
24:32 - character
24:33 - uh be talking uh so there's this uh bat
24:36 - uh that uh uh
24:39 - um when the space key pressed if you
24:42 - remember in this project
24:43 - when the space key pressed uh this bat
24:45 - says uh how was your day scratch cat so
24:47 - if i press the space key
24:48 - says how's your day scratch cat let's uh
24:50 - show
24:51 - how you would add sound to this uh i'll
24:54 - show
24:54 - how first i'll just show so there's this
24:57 - block
24:58 - start sound which is really great it
25:01 - will
25:01 - start a sound playing and then uh that
25:04 - sound will be playing as the
25:06 - character keeps doing the other stuff
25:07 - you wanted it to do so
25:09 - uh i could drag this start sound block
25:12 - uh
25:12 - when so when the space key is pressed
25:15 - the bat will uh
25:16 - start the sound and then say how's your
25:18 - day scratch cat so i'll press the space
25:20 - key
25:22 - oh wait do i have my volume on
25:26 - okay i'm not sure if you can hear that
25:28 - because it's making this little quiet
25:29 - owl sound but
25:31 - i hope you heard that uh it makes this
25:33 - sort of whoosh owl sound
25:35 - uh because we didn't have a bat sound
25:36 - and we decided owl was the closest thing
25:38 - um so uh the um
25:42 - what i was gonna show you is uh that's
25:45 - one way
25:46 - of um of making a sound play but also
25:49 - you could record yourself
25:50 - saying what you want the character to
25:52 - say and
25:54 - uh and have that play so to do that
25:57 - uh i went through that quickly let me
25:59 - show you more slowly uh
26:00 - click on the sounds tab
26:04 - and then you can go down to this button
26:06 - down here
26:07 - choose a sound and you can go up to here
26:10 - record and uh click
26:13 - record oh i'm gonna allow it to use my
26:16 - microphone
26:18 - and now you can record something so uh
26:23 - how was your day scratch cat
26:27 - how was your day scratch cat okay hope
26:30 - you can hear that
26:30 - so and it seems pretty good save that
26:34 - now saved is recording one and now to
26:37 - make that sound
26:38 - play you just go back to the code tab
26:40 - and
26:41 - uh from this start sound block right now
26:43 - it's selecting owl but you can go down
26:45 - to
26:46 - recording one and now i'm going to press
26:48 - the space key
26:50 - how was your day scratch cat yeah there
26:53 - you go
26:53 - so you could have it be actually saying
26:55 - aloud uh what you wrote for it to say
26:58 - um so yeah that's how you could add um
27:02 - sound to what the characters say um
27:04 - great question uh
27:06 - oh uh someone says uh uh
27:09 - hello hope you are having a great day
27:11 - thank you i am this is seriously the
27:13 - highlight of my week
27:14 - uh i hope you're having a great day too
27:15 - and then they say uh how do you get
27:17 - different sprites
27:19 - uh so it's great question um i'll go
27:21 - back to this
27:22 - scratch this project with the actually
27:23 - you know what i'll just open up a new
27:25 - project
27:25 - so i'm going to scratch.mit.edu slash
27:28 - create i'm just going to say this link
27:29 - every time in case you're joining now
27:31 - uh you go to scratch.mit.edu create
27:34 - uh you can open up a scratch project and
27:36 - start making one and also if you're
27:38 - joining now in the stream but welcome
27:40 - uh so the question was how to add
27:43 - different characters to your project
27:45 - so one way which i i showed in the
27:48 - stream but in case you missed it i'm
27:49 - gonna show it again
27:50 - uh you hover over this button that says
27:52 - choose a sprite
27:53 - and if you click there's a lot of
27:54 - options one is you can say click choose
27:57 - and then you can choose from all these
27:59 - well they all look blank right now okay
28:02 - all these default sprites that we have
28:04 - uh that could just be
28:06 - a a way to just get a character into
28:08 - your project uh so we've got
28:09 - uh you know all these different
28:10 - categories we got animals we got
28:13 - people uh you got fantasy characters
28:17 - uh dance characters uh
28:20 - you know music musical instruments
28:22 - sports all this stuff
28:24 - so that so that's a great way you can
28:26 - add add a character
28:28 - like that and you can add as many as you
28:30 - want you know yeah i'd say i picked the
28:31 - batter
28:32 - uh let's also get um uh um
28:36 - you know the the uh
28:39 - you know come on mom looks cool so
28:43 - you know you can add in you know as many
28:45 - characters as you want that's one way
28:47 - um another way is that you can upload
28:50 - um a picture from your computer so uh
28:53 - yeah you could
28:54 - upload uh if you just click on here
28:56 - upload sprite i don't really have a
28:57 - picture at hand
28:58 - but you can uh you can just bring any
29:01 - picture that you have into the scratch
29:04 - project like that you could take a
29:05 - screenshot of something on the internet
29:06 - and then
29:06 - upload it uh so yeah that's that that'll
29:09 - you know bring
29:10 - a character in like that um yeah so
29:14 - that's that's those are some ways of
29:15 - getting uh different sprites um oh man
29:17 - so many good questions okay
29:19 - um so uh uh oh
29:22 - and you know what i just want to mention
29:23 - we had another uh story prompt idea
29:26 - that came in um in espanol
29:30 - a bat that doesn't know how to fly i
29:32 - love that idea also and we do have a
29:34 - murcielago or bat
29:35 - sprite so you could use that gracias for
29:38 - uh
29:43 - uh questions in spanish are very welcome
29:45 - thank you for the question in spanish
29:47 - um so uh the um
29:52 - uh we oh so okay oh oh my gosh all these
29:55 - great questions okay i'm gonna try to
29:56 - answer them all because they're all
29:57 - really good
29:58 - um the i just love reading all your
30:00 - questions
30:01 - uh so someone asks um uh someone asks
30:04 - how do you animate a sprite and
30:05 - someone also asks how do you get sprites
30:07 - to change costume i think i can
30:09 - uh answer these in one uh in one answer
30:13 - so yes to animate a sprite um
30:17 - the you you could use this uh chain
30:20 - these
30:20 - next costume blocks because in scratch
30:23 - the
30:24 - costumes of a character up here that you
30:26 - can see up here are sort of considered
30:27 - to be different
30:28 - poses for the character pretty often
30:30 - that's usually how we think about it is
30:32 - so this batter has all these different
30:34 - poses and
30:35 - uh some sprites like i'm on i wasn't
30:37 - actually intending this but this is kind
30:39 - of a good example
30:40 - amman only comes with one costume um but
30:42 - i could show you how you could
30:44 - make multiple costumes if you wanted to
30:46 - but first i'll show you
30:47 - on the batter who does come with
30:49 - multiple costumes
30:50 - so a way to animate a sprite is and a
30:53 - way to use the
30:54 - to change costumes and let me make the
30:56 - size bigger
30:58 - is you can use this next costume block
31:02 - to switch between costumes um you can
31:04 - also
31:05 - switch to a specific costume so let me
31:07 - go and see what batter d
31:09 - is okay batter d is this one
31:12 - um and and then you've got like
31:15 - uh batter c is this one so i can
31:19 - switch costume to batter d and then pick
31:22 - out the other specific one i wanted
31:23 - batter c
31:24 - because that kind of looked like like
31:25 - she was hitting ball uh
31:28 - so i can do today uh
31:31 - yes um so anyway uh
31:34 - i thought i just i thought my microphone
31:36 - got unplugged but it did not
31:38 - um so you can switch to uh
31:41 - batter d and then wait one second
31:46 - and then they attach these together and
31:48 - then switch to batter c
31:49 - so she's sort of ready to swing and then
31:53 - swings and you could have that right now
31:56 - i'm just clicking on this to make it
31:57 - happen but you could have that happen
31:59 - uh when the green flag is clicked uh you
32:01 - know
32:02 - so i could just click the green flag to
32:04 - start that um or you could have that
32:06 - happen when the space key is pressed or
32:07 - something like that
32:08 - you can also animate a character so like
32:10 - this character amman who only had one
32:13 - costume
32:14 - you know you can uh you could duplicate
32:16 - that costume
32:18 - and then you could go in and
32:21 - uh you know change something okay i
32:23 - don't want to like
32:25 - uh photoshop this really badly or not
32:27 - photoshop but you know scratch photoshop
32:29 - but here so i could what you could do is
32:32 - you can
32:32 - with this uh selection tool right here
32:35 - you could
32:36 - select a part of the person and then you
32:39 - could
32:39 - drag that around and repose it so
32:43 - you know what i'm gonna count that it's
32:44 - not such a terrible of a scratch
32:46 - photoshop job just don't look at it too
32:48 - closely
32:49 - um so now you know you've got these
32:51 - different costumes
32:53 - as a mod kind of looks like he's flying
32:55 - uh and now you could use the
32:57 - the next costume block to switch between
32:59 - those so
33:01 - do fly and pay no attention to the
33:03 - pixelation
33:04 - um anyway so thanks for questions
33:07 - about animating a character um let's see
33:11 - uh more questions oh um okay uh
33:14 - uh someone asks uh can you import your
33:16 - own design yes
33:17 - totally i think that is wonderful that's
33:19 - one of those i love
33:21 - this about scratch um you can you can
33:23 - either draw your own design
33:25 - by uh hovering over this choose a sprite
33:27 - button and clicking
33:28 - paint uh and then you can draw
33:32 - anything you want you know you could use
33:33 - this paint brush to
33:35 - draw a face that could be your design or
33:38 - maybe your design is
33:39 - different than my design that i just
33:41 - made um
33:43 - and you can you can also uh hover over
33:46 - this
33:46 - choose a sprite button and click upload
33:48 - to upload any design that you have on
33:50 - your computer um so yes you can
33:53 - um uh uh someone asks um uh
33:57 - uh how to use a text to speech block
33:59 - this is a great question i loved seeing
34:01 - uh in last week's studio so many people
34:02 - did projects with text to speech it's so
34:05 - fun for introducing characters and
34:06 - telling stories
34:07 - so let me show you so text to speech
34:10 - uh they're not in any of these
34:13 - categories
34:14 - here they are some other blocks that you
34:16 - can add to scratch by just clicking on
34:18 - this button
34:19 - down here so just click on that and
34:23 - uh just click on uh right here text to
34:26 - speech these are extensions to scratch
34:28 - which just add
34:29 - more blocks that you can use um so
34:32 - uh click on text to speech and then we
34:36 - have these new blocks that you can use
34:38 - to make characters talk so uh
34:41 - you can uh drag out uh one of these
34:45 - uh and click on it hello
34:49 - so the character uh actually speaks a
34:51 - loud and says
34:52 - hello i think the one that's speaking
34:53 - right now is this face uh
34:55 - i'll i'll make uh the i'll make the
34:58 - scratch cat
35:00 - speak
35:07 - it can say that um the you can also
35:10 - control
35:11 - the voice you can have it say
35:14 - different voice you can also add lots of
35:17 - uh
35:18 - speak blocks one after another and just
35:20 - write whatever you want to say
35:21 - um i am the scratch cat
35:25 - hello i am the scratch cat yeah or you
35:28 - could add this squeak voice
35:30 - hello i am the scratch cat and uh
35:33 - and the other thing one other thing i'll
35:35 - show you about text-to-speech blocks
35:38 - is um that you can also uh
35:41 - you can add a say block along with it
35:44 - so uh there's this say block that uh
35:47 - says
35:48 - say hello for two seconds and that's uh
35:50 - really useful for
35:52 - uh making it say hello for that period
35:54 - of time
35:55 - but you could also have this there's
35:57 - this block say hello and you might
35:59 - wonder why
36:00 - why are there these two different blocks
36:02 - it's because
36:03 - this one you can uh drag it out
36:07 - and then it will say this thing in this
36:11 - say block
36:11 - until another block comes up to have it
36:14 - say something else
36:16 - so uh i can
36:19 - drag another one of these say blocks
36:21 - here and put it in there and then
36:24 - write i am the scratch cat
36:27 - here because this this
36:31 - these green speak blocks are going to be
36:32 - controlling what the cat is saying out
36:34 - loud
36:35 - but then these say blocks are
36:36 - controlling what it will say in the
36:37 - speech bubble so let me show you how
36:39 - that will go
36:40 - hello i am the scratch cat that went a
36:42 - little fast with the ulta with the
36:43 - squeak voice let me change it to alto
36:45 - um so i am the scratch cat
36:49 - it says hello uh in this box while it's
36:53 - um you know it says hello in the speech
36:55 - bubble
36:56 - and then once it finishes speaking hello
36:59 - it says the next thing so
37:00 - that uh can be a really nice way
37:04 - of using text-to-speech and also having
37:06 - speech bubbles along with it
37:08 - um so thanks for the question uh let's
37:10 - see
37:11 - uh someone asks uh
37:14 - you do um how to make the characters
37:16 - move and then talk to other characters
37:18 - it's a great question maybe uh we can
37:21 - show it with
37:22 - a mom um so uh
37:25 - to make a character move uh you'd want
37:28 - to go to this motion category
37:30 - and now there's tons and tons of ways
37:32 - that you could make a character move
37:34 - uh you could have it uh you know
37:38 - uh like so let's let's say we want this
37:40 - to happen when the green flag is clicked
37:41 - it will drag out when green flag clicked
37:44 - um you could have it uh
37:47 - okay so we want to go to this motion
37:49 - category it could be that when the green
37:50 - flag clicked
37:51 - you want it to just move ten steps and
37:53 - move ten steps will just make it move
37:55 - kind of
37:55 - forward in whatever direction it's
37:57 - pointing and right now it's
37:58 - the amount is pointing this way um and
38:01 - so
38:02 - you could move 10 step when the green
38:05 - flag is clicked
38:05 - amon will then move 10 steps oh yeah and
38:08 - the batter is doing this little
38:10 - animation um so
38:13 - uh so that's one way of making a
38:15 - character move um
38:16 - you could also um have let's let's have
38:20 - a mon
38:21 - start over here you can have a character
38:24 - start at one point and then
38:26 - glide to another so let's
38:29 - say start over here uh
38:32 - and and if you drag it to a position you
38:34 - can use this
38:36 - go to block to make it just go to that
38:39 - position
38:39 - so this so this go to block when i'll
38:43 - make him go here so if i
38:44 - drag over here and click that again go
38:47 - back here
38:48 - uh and then you could use a glide block
38:52 - to make him go like here so
38:55 - and because i dragged it out here this
38:58 - glide block will now
39:00 - cause them to glide there so
39:03 - i drag these out this one is so let let
39:06 - me just
39:08 - drag them somewhere random this glide
39:10 - block makes him glide to right there
39:12 - so uh you can attach these together
39:17 - and so then he's the uh elan starts
39:20 - over here where i drag him first and
39:21 - then glides over here so that
39:23 - is one way of care making characters
39:24 - move with these using these go-to
39:27 - and glide blocks um and then
39:30 - uh and then to make a character say
39:33 - something there's these
39:34 - you know these say blocks so then uh
39:37 - amman could say
39:38 - hi batter scratch cat
39:42 - and smiley face
39:46 - um so
39:49 - let me move the scratch cat perhaps a
39:52 - little bit out of the way
39:53 - this story is truly truly wonderful um
39:56 - uh so uh so when the green flag is
39:59 - clicked
40:00 - uh amman will like go over here
40:03 - and then uh and then glide over there
40:06 - and talk to the other characters so
40:07 - that's a way you could
40:08 - uh talk have a character move and then
40:10 - talk to other characters
40:12 - so uh oh my gosh there are still so many
40:14 - great questions
40:15 - uh now we only have 10 minutes left so
40:18 - uh in a few moments
40:19 - i am going to start wrapping up and i
40:20 - will show uh how you could make an
40:22 - account in case you don't have an
40:24 - account
40:24 - and i will also show um how you can
40:27 - share your project
40:28 - if you want to uh but you know maybe i
40:30 - have time for one more quick question
40:32 - um uh
40:35 - someone asks um
40:39 - one last quick question someone asks um
40:41 - how can you use multiple backdrops for a
40:43 - story
40:44 - um you can go by hovering over this
40:47 - choose a backdrop button
40:48 - and then clicking choose and then
40:52 - you can uh choose any of these backdrops
40:55 - that you want so there's this
40:56 - colorful city one that i like a lot um
40:59 - and
40:59 - and you can add another one you can
41:02 - add uh let's see there's this nice uh
41:05 - beach
41:06 - um and then you can click uh you can
41:08 - there's this
41:09 - handy block next backdrop that you can
41:11 - drag out to go between them
41:13 - and i see that blank backdrop that i
41:15 - started with there so i can you can
41:17 - get rid of that you can go to the stage
41:19 - click on
41:20 - backdrops and then just hit delete on
41:23 - that
41:24 - uh so anyway so and now and now if you
41:27 - click
41:27 - back on uh amman which is where i put
41:30 - the next backdrop block you can switch
41:32 - between those backdrops
41:34 - um anyway uh so that's how you can uh do
41:37 - multiple backdrops thanks for the
41:38 - question
41:39 - um oh and i see a couple people asking

Cleaned transcript:

um okay yes we have 22 viewers now hello everyone uh welcome back in um i think maybe i'll uh pick up now um yeah i think i think we'll just resume here uh like youtube never interrupted our stream but that's that's fine we're all figuring things out here uh so okay where were we uh where we were was that i was telling you that today the prompt of today is uh creating a story uh so the idea is that you can make a a story of any kind i'm not sure when the stream uh broke off so i'm not sure if i'm repeating myself uh so let me you can send me in the google form if uh if i'm repeating myself too much but basically the idea of today is that you can make absolutely any kind of story you could interpret it in any direction the uh making characters talk to each other um making uh uh like uh a character just go between multiple backgrounds it could be a totally random story i'm gonna show you how to do a random story with two uh objects from my house um and uh yeah that is the idea for today um but i will start by uh showing you how to um open up scratch and make a scratch studio um and thank you everyone so much for bearing with the technical difficulties i'm glad we got the stream back going and we've got lots of you here i hope more people will keep joining um so uh edit um all right so uh let me show you how to open up scratch.mit.edu uh so let me switch to uh showing the url so you're gonna go to uh scratch.mit.edu uh and then uh you're going to uh go to uh this link up here that says create uh just click on that and you can also go to this url scratch.mit.edu create i'll keep this url up for a few moments but i will try not to keep it up for too long uh the i know every past time i have forgotten and left the url up it's all the learning process here we're uh we're figuring it all out um so yes scratch.mit.edu create and that will open up uh this page which is the uh scratch editor um so uh the scratch editor in case you haven't seen it before or if it's been a while um i'll give you just a little uh uh explanation of sort of how it works and then i'll show you how to start making a story also if you're already you know ready to get started on your creative story project you could totally do that um but for anybody who would like to here's a little explanation of scratch so in scratch you have these uh characters uh down here right now we have just the one this cat and you have all these blocks over here on the left that you can click on to make the characters do things so this one uh says turn 15 degrees and when i click on it the cat is a turn and a turn um so you can drag these this is sort of like the menu of options you can pick from there's tons of them and you can drag that into here to sort of work with with these blocks so you know here i can click it have the cat turn uh you can try out other ones this one says go to random position click on that and makes the cat go to a random position um and there's all these different categories these uh blocks are in the motion category so they're kind of affecting how the cat moves but there's other stuff like you can affect the looks of the cat so you can go down see what's here there's this one says change size by 10. you could click that and now we have a cat that is getting bigger um you can combine them so there's this block that says change color effect by 25 and so if i i now have attached it to this change size by 10 block and now if i click the both of them it gets bigger change the size by 10 and it changes the color uh by like 25 around the color wheel 25 degrees i think so or something like that so um anyway this great colorful cat we have that's like the basic idea of scratch which is you have all of these blocks that are things for characters to do and then if you have a character you can use the blocks and make them do these things and you can also this cat is the default character it comes with but you can also click on you know what i did that kind of fast and it's going to take a long time to go back because my computer is chugging but um and you know what maybe i hope you all have this link here that um uh scratch.mit.edu create and i will take it down now but if you do need a help still finding link if you join later in the stream uh just write into the google form and i'll put the link back up or i'll i'll tell it to you uh so hiding the link ha ha it's done uh so um the uh you you can hover over this button here that says choose a sprite click on that and add any character that you might like to you know you could add uh this character avery um walking next to this uh very large colorful cat um so you can and now you might wonder oh where did all of those blocks go that we put out for the scratch cat they only apply to the scratch cat so if you click on the scratch cat's little icon here then they didn't go anywhere you can see them right here um but avery we haven't made any any blocks for avery and these if we but if we now that we've clicked on avery if we put out blocks here they'll affect avery so you can drag out this block that says say hello for two seconds now if we click on that avery is the one who says hello so that's the basic basic idea of scratch um now how might one create a story in scratch well we happen to have a tutorial that is pretty useful for this it is actually called create a story um let me open up a new scratch project i'm just gonna go to scratch.mit.edu create to make a new scratch project um and if you're joining just now the stream welcome we had a little bit of technical difficulties but i think we're back on track thank you so much everybody for bearing with us as we learn what youtube does and does not consider a reason to cancel a live stream uh yes very grateful to everyone for bearing with as our uh you know you know this is just we were creating a story today of the story of how we made this live stream happen so you've all been part of the story um so uh yes but if you wanted to create a story in your scratch project open up this scratch project and uh you can click on tutorials this button up here and you'll get all these tutorials we have and right here uh we have create a story you can click on that and then this window will pop up you could watch the video the video will explain some stuff about creating a story um but you can also if you click this green arrow here you can walk through the steps of the tutorial so uh you can so this first step says to add a backdrop and i do think that's a nice uh first step for making a story uh i actually helped make this tutorial so i feel a little uh bad saying that's a great first step but i think it is a pretty good one uh so yeah you can hover over this choose a backdrop button and then uh pick any backdrop you would like if there's one that sort of sparks your imagination and you're like okay i want to tell a back a story where the backdrop is castle 3 or colorful city click on that one uh i'm not sure exactly what story i want to do yet but this one blue sky i feel like is a very good backdrop that could go to many many many kinds of stories um so i'll just pick that for now i like blue sky a lot um and so then you can click the next the arrow here to see the next steps the next one is add a character uh so let us hover over this button and click choose and we can add a character for our story and i think this is uh one place where you can be like okay uh what what kind of story do i want to do uh maybe um let's see uh you can i'll let you do the bat oh and i just saw a question coming in i have no story ideas can you help with prompts yes uh i i will i will help with prompts hi flower uh who sent that in um i will help with prompts uh very soon uh that's a great idea um so uh yes okay so we've added a character um and you know now uh let's go to the next step and so this one has is uh say something where to put this window i think that's an okay place to put it for now um so uh it says to uh okay purple uh say block it's gonna be the looks category because it sort of matches that color so uh say this one says say welcome oh you know what let me make the size a little bit bigger this one says you could have it say welcome to magic school but you can have it say whatever you want and now i have this bat here uh so uh maybe y'all have in the back we've got the bat in the cat uh so maybe i'll have the bat say um uh um how is your day scratch cat um yeah so now that that has a little bit of dialogue and then it also says you can add this uh yellow when green flag clicked block on top so that that matches this color so i will go in and add that and what that does is now uh you can click the green flag to make it happen and this is useful because you could have lots and lots of different characters doing things that start when the green flag is clicked so you can start all of that by just clicking the green flag if you add this uh when green flag clicked block to start the the this same block so that's the the first step of this create a story tutorial that i just wanted to walk through it um oh i just saw a question come in that i can answer pretty quickly that says how can you change the color of the sky it's a great question um and you click on the stage um so yeah the to change the color of the sky uh you can click on the stage here which is like where all the backdrops are stored and then right up here there's this backdrops tab so you can click on that and then you can click on this uh uh this chunk that is the sky and then you can go up here to this color section the color square and then change it to whatever color you want so maybe you want a bit of a more blue blue or maybe it's a sort of a sunset times or so you want like an orange um and yeah basically you can just uh grab any shape and uh and change its color up here so you can also so purple sky you can also click on this fill bucket and change the color so if you want a green sky uh you can do that so yeah that's how you can change the color of the sky make it your own um uh so let me so flower asked um can i help with story prompts yes uh let's see let's think of a few props and actually if you se if you want to send in prompts that you come up with you could send them to the to the google form um let's see you could uh uh tell that you could have uh a character that you love like uh uh maybe like explaining to another character like i i don't know uh their backstory or kind of yeah like their history or uh something like that you could show a flashback um from characters like past uh that's like a prompt idea you could you could i i know i often show this but i think it's it can be nice for just getting ideas going you can click a couple by hovering over this button here you can click uh surprise and create a couple of random characters and you can also add a hover over this choose a backdrop and click uh surprise here oh my gosh oh someone anyways and you can get like random backdrops and you're like okay so why is the knight in the bedroom with giga who looks very very happy um and a scratch cat and a bat that can be a place to get an idea um oh okay uh i've got a couple of story ideas coming in someone said you could make a story about a dog trying to learn how to swim i love that uh and uh story idea it's safe patrick's day and you see a little green hat i love that too uh so yeah oh okay someone says uh do a castle story i am a huge fan of castle stories uh okay someone says i have an idea for a prompt scratch cat accidentally hits a button that teleports them into real life i love that oh my gosh these are all so good uh oh uh tell a story about a unicorn adventure someone says thank you for sending in all these story ideas um uh flower and anybody who is still wondering about an idea i hope uh that you can uh hope these have given you some ideas but i'll keep coming saying more ideas and keep going uh someone also asks uh oh your questions are so wonderful i love answering all these questions someone asks can i make an interactive story yes you totally can um and i uh can show you some ways of of doing that um oh there are such good questions i want to get to them all okay so yeah um uh can you make an interactive story totally let me show you a few ways you could make a story interactive um so and and and maybe in case you're wondering what uh do we mean by like what's an interactive story i guess it's it would be some kind of story where the player can who's watching it uh can kind of affect the story in some way or control when something happens um so uh yeah uh the the the there's a couple sort of quick ways in scratch to make a story interactive so one is this wonderful block uh when space key pressed so right now i'm in the back i did this i did this code for the bat where uh it's it says when green flag clicked say how's your day scratch cat but you could have instead of having that happen happen when the green flag is clicked you could have that when a key is pressed so i could just detach that this from there and put it here and now trust me i'm gonna press the space key every time the player presses the space key this bat will say this um you could also uh have the um you know you you could have uh something a character say something when it is clicked this is another one of my favorite ways to make a story interactive like really easily um so you can uh you can i you know let me get another thing um another block you could have um maybe when the bat is we're still in the bat so when this sprite clicked uh we could have it say um like oh hello there so now every time i click on the bat it says a little thing it's sort of like interactive because it's responding to me um so those are some ways of making it interactive and i'll show one more that i really love um so uh let's let's there is this block in the uh sensing category uh and sensing is basically a category full of lots of blocks that uh can be used to make your project interactive i almost think it would be really fun to do a live stream where i just kind of explain like show lots of ways of using these because they're they're they all have it's really cool stuff they can do but i think until you see it used it can be i i didn't really know how to approach these vlogs but let me show you a way of using one of my favorite ones in this category so uh you can let's let's let's go to uh the scratch cat let's have the scratch cat do this um the scratch cat you can drag out this block um ask make it bigger um ask what's your name and wait uh so the the if once this gets clicked on the scratch cat will say like what's your name and then i can say uh zoey but it doesn't do anything after that but so where did my answer go it is stored in this little round block called answer and you can always click on these rounded blocks to see uh what what that thing is so right now answer is zoe because that's what i wrote but what's cool is you remember those say blocks from earlier you can actually put the answer block into a say block because it has the same rounded shape so it actually fits inside it so i can drag out it saying hello and then i can drag out it's saying it's just put in answer so let's do now so what's your name zoe hello zoe so it it does something sort of responding to what i wrote um so anyway that is another one of my favorite ways of making a project interactive um anyway thanks for the question oh okay couple other questions coming in uh someone asks um how can you make a sprite appear or disappear this is a great question and can be useful in so many stories um let me show you in a new project so i'm going to scratch.mit.edu create um and uh and welcome to anyone joining now uh this is the create a long uh live stream episode three uh we're making story projects in this time together uh so yeah you can make any kind of story um and then you'll be able to share it if you want to at the end um and you can send in your questions if you want any help getting started getting ideas and i'll answer them if i can um so opening up a new project um and this is to show how to make a character disappear or appear so in the we've got the scratch cat here in the looks category we have he scroll down there are these blocks uh let me make this bigger uh show and hide so you can click on them to see what they do if you click hide this character you can see this after this eye turns to being like invisible it can't be seen uh so you can and then if you click the show block it shows up again it's like visible so you can hide and show a character um and make it appear and disappear with these blocks but uh so that's how the blocks you'd use to make a character appear and disappear but possibly even more useful is let me show you how you could use this so um let's let's let's say you want let's say so let's add a couple of backdrops to our project because i'll show you how let's say you wanted the scratch cat to appear in one backdrop and then disappear when you go to another backdrop because say you want it to be in one scene of your story but not the other one i'll show you how to do that right now so to do that let's get a couple of backdrops okay one um you know someone mentioned doing a castle story before i love that so i'm going to add castle 3. um and let's get another backdrop someone also mentioned having a dog who has to learn how to swim and so let me see if there's something that has a pool oh yes yes i remember i knew there had to be a pool background uh so we've got these two backgrounds um and you can you can click on the stage and go to backdrops to uh see the background drops you have you have we have castle three and we have pool and we can we have this blank one but i will delete that so um if let's go back to the scratch cat and go back to the code tab so uh let's say we want you can switch between backdrops with this uh switch you know what make this a tiny bit smaller you can switch between backdrops with this switch backdrop block so you can click right now it says switch backdrop to pool and switch to pool uh and i can actually also let me drag out another one because i can drag this out again and in this one pick castle 3 and then i can this with this i can switch to castle three so this is an extremely useful block for controlling what the backdrop or what the scene of your of your uh story is so you can switch between them like this now let's say let me make this a little smaller again let's say that at the beginning of the project we want uh we'll say the beginning of the project we want the scratch cat to be at the castle and then and we want it to show up with this show block but then once it gets to the pool we want it to hide like let's say the scratch cat is not in the scene at the pool so when the green flag is clicked you can do switch backdrop oh we wanted it to start at the castle so when the green flag is clicked we'll have it start at the castle we'll switch the backdrop to that and then uh we'll and when the green flag is clicked uh you know how's the best way to do this uh maybe when the backdrop switches to the castle we'll have the scratch catch shut so uh it starts the backdrop switches to the castle and because the backdrop switched to the castle the scratch cat shows up and this this block that i just dragged out when backdrop switches to um can also be used to make it hide when we go to another scene so when the backdrop switches to pool we want the scratch cat to hide drag that out and so let's uh say uh so yeah let's just test it out i'm gonna click this and this will switch the backdrop to the pool so we switch to the pool and the scratch cat hides um but then if we if we restart the project and switch because that switches the backdrop to castle 3 then the cat shows because when the backdrop switches to castle 3 it shows up um and then uh let's let's let's just test it all out by having when the project starts it'll wait one second at the castle and then switch the backdrop to the pool so it's gonna should start at the castle wait and then switch the pool and it should it has these instructions that say when it goes to the castle show up and when it switches to the pool hide so let's test it out it starts it's at the castle and it goes to the pool so i hope that helped as a way to make uh the make a character show and hide and how you could use that just to do different scenes um oh okay someone else asks um how to add sound when they talk uh so uh that's a great question uh let me go back to one of the ones where i had a character uh be talking uh so there's this uh bat uh that uh uh um when the space key pressed if you remember in this project when the space key pressed uh this bat says uh how was your day scratch cat so if i press the space key says how's your day scratch cat let's uh show how you would add sound to this uh i'll show how first i'll just show so there's this block start sound which is really great it will start a sound playing and then uh that sound will be playing as the character keeps doing the other stuff you wanted it to do so uh i could drag this start sound block uh when so when the space key is pressed the bat will uh start the sound and then say how's your day scratch cat so i'll press the space key oh wait do i have my volume on okay i'm not sure if you can hear that because it's making this little quiet owl sound but i hope you heard that uh it makes this sort of whoosh owl sound uh because we didn't have a bat sound and we decided owl was the closest thing um so uh the um what i was gonna show you is uh that's one way of um of making a sound play but also you could record yourself saying what you want the character to say and uh and have that play so to do that uh i went through that quickly let me show you more slowly uh click on the sounds tab and then you can go down to this button down here choose a sound and you can go up to here record and uh click record oh i'm gonna allow it to use my microphone and now you can record something so uh how was your day scratch cat how was your day scratch cat okay hope you can hear that so and it seems pretty good save that now saved is recording one and now to make that sound play you just go back to the code tab and uh from this start sound block right now it's selecting owl but you can go down to recording one and now i'm going to press the space key how was your day scratch cat yeah there you go so you could have it be actually saying aloud uh what you wrote for it to say um so yeah that's how you could add um sound to what the characters say um great question uh oh uh someone says uh uh hello hope you are having a great day thank you i am this is seriously the highlight of my week uh i hope you're having a great day too and then they say uh how do you get different sprites uh so it's great question um i'll go back to this scratch this project with the actually you know what i'll just open up a new project so i'm going to scratch.mit.edu slash create i'm just going to say this link every time in case you're joining now uh you go to scratch.mit.edu create uh you can open up a scratch project and start making one and also if you're joining now in the stream but welcome uh so the question was how to add different characters to your project so one way which i i showed in the stream but in case you missed it i'm gonna show it again uh you hover over this button that says choose a sprite and if you click there's a lot of options one is you can say click choose and then you can choose from all these well they all look blank right now okay all these default sprites that we have uh that could just be a a way to just get a character into your project uh so we've got uh you know all these different categories we got animals we got people uh you got fantasy characters uh dance characters uh you know music musical instruments sports all this stuff so that so that's a great way you can add add a character like that and you can add as many as you want you know yeah i'd say i picked the batter uh let's also get um uh um you know the the uh you know come on mom looks cool so you know you can add in you know as many characters as you want that's one way um another way is that you can upload um a picture from your computer so uh yeah you could upload uh if you just click on here upload sprite i don't really have a picture at hand but you can uh you can just bring any picture that you have into the scratch project like that you could take a screenshot of something on the internet and then upload it uh so yeah that's that that'll you know bring a character in like that um yeah so that's that's those are some ways of getting uh different sprites um oh man so many good questions okay um so uh uh oh and you know what i just want to mention we had another uh story prompt idea that came in um in espanol a bat that doesn't know how to fly i love that idea also and we do have a murcielago or bat sprite so you could use that gracias for uh uh questions in spanish are very welcome thank you for the question in spanish um so uh the um uh we oh so okay oh oh my gosh all these great questions okay i'm gonna try to answer them all because they're all really good um the i just love reading all your questions uh so someone asks um uh someone asks how do you animate a sprite and someone also asks how do you get sprites to change costume i think i can uh answer these in one uh in one answer so yes to animate a sprite um the you you could use this uh chain these next costume blocks because in scratch the costumes of a character up here that you can see up here are sort of considered to be different poses for the character pretty often that's usually how we think about it is so this batter has all these different poses and uh some sprites like i'm on i wasn't actually intending this but this is kind of a good example amman only comes with one costume um but i could show you how you could make multiple costumes if you wanted to but first i'll show you on the batter who does come with multiple costumes so a way to animate a sprite is and a way to use the to change costumes and let me make the size bigger is you can use this next costume block to switch between costumes um you can also switch to a specific costume so let me go and see what batter d is okay batter d is this one um and and then you've got like uh batter c is this one so i can switch costume to batter d and then pick out the other specific one i wanted batter c because that kind of looked like like she was hitting ball uh so i can do today uh yes um so anyway uh i thought i just i thought my microphone got unplugged but it did not um so you can switch to uh batter d and then wait one second and then they attach these together and then switch to batter c so she's sort of ready to swing and then swings and you could have that right now i'm just clicking on this to make it happen but you could have that happen uh when the green flag is clicked uh you know so i could just click the green flag to start that um or you could have that happen when the space key is pressed or something like that you can also animate a character so like this character amman who only had one costume you know you can uh you could duplicate that costume and then you could go in and uh you know change something okay i don't want to like uh photoshop this really badly or not photoshop but you know scratch photoshop but here so i could what you could do is you can with this uh selection tool right here you could select a part of the person and then you could drag that around and repose it so you know what i'm gonna count that it's not such a terrible of a scratch photoshop job just don't look at it too closely um so now you know you've got these different costumes as a mod kind of looks like he's flying uh and now you could use the the next costume block to switch between those so do fly and pay no attention to the pixelation um anyway so thanks for questions about animating a character um let's see uh more questions oh um okay uh uh someone asks uh can you import your own design yes totally i think that is wonderful that's one of those i love this about scratch um you can you can either draw your own design by uh hovering over this choose a sprite button and clicking paint uh and then you can draw anything you want you know you could use this paint brush to draw a face that could be your design or maybe your design is different than my design that i just made um and you can you can also uh hover over this choose a sprite button and click upload to upload any design that you have on your computer um so yes you can um uh uh someone asks um uh uh how to use a text to speech block this is a great question i loved seeing uh in last week's studio so many people did projects with text to speech it's so fun for introducing characters and telling stories so let me show you so text to speech uh they're not in any of these categories here they are some other blocks that you can add to scratch by just clicking on this button down here so just click on that and uh just click on uh right here text to speech these are extensions to scratch which just add more blocks that you can use um so uh click on text to speech and then we have these new blocks that you can use to make characters talk so uh you can uh drag out uh one of these uh and click on it hello so the character uh actually speaks a loud and says hello i think the one that's speaking right now is this face uh i'll i'll make uh the i'll make the scratch cat speak it can say that um the you can also control the voice you can have it say different voice you can also add lots of uh speak blocks one after another and just write whatever you want to say um i am the scratch cat hello i am the scratch cat yeah or you could add this squeak voice hello i am the scratch cat and uh and the other thing one other thing i'll show you about texttospeech blocks is um that you can also uh you can add a say block along with it so uh there's this say block that uh says say hello for two seconds and that's uh really useful for uh making it say hello for that period of time but you could also have this there's this block say hello and you might wonder why why are there these two different blocks it's because this one you can uh drag it out and then it will say this thing in this say block until another block comes up to have it say something else so uh i can drag another one of these say blocks here and put it in there and then write i am the scratch cat here because this this these green speak blocks are going to be controlling what the cat is saying out loud but then these say blocks are controlling what it will say in the speech bubble so let me show you how that will go hello i am the scratch cat that went a little fast with the ulta with the squeak voice let me change it to alto um so i am the scratch cat it says hello uh in this box while it's um you know it says hello in the speech bubble and then once it finishes speaking hello it says the next thing so that uh can be a really nice way of using texttospeech and also having speech bubbles along with it um so thanks for the question uh let's see uh someone asks uh you do um how to make the characters move and then talk to other characters it's a great question maybe uh we can show it with a mom um so uh to make a character move uh you'd want to go to this motion category and now there's tons and tons of ways that you could make a character move uh you could have it uh you know uh like so let's let's say we want this to happen when the green flag is clicked it will drag out when green flag clicked um you could have it uh okay so we want to go to this motion category it could be that when the green flag clicked you want it to just move ten steps and move ten steps will just make it move kind of forward in whatever direction it's pointing and right now it's the amount is pointing this way um and so you could move 10 step when the green flag is clicked amon will then move 10 steps oh yeah and the batter is doing this little animation um so uh so that's one way of making a character move um you could also um have let's let's have a mon start over here you can have a character start at one point and then glide to another so let's say start over here uh and and if you drag it to a position you can use this go to block to make it just go to that position so this so this go to block when i'll make him go here so if i drag over here and click that again go back here uh and then you could use a glide block to make him go like here so and because i dragged it out here this glide block will now cause them to glide there so i drag these out this one is so let let me just drag them somewhere random this glide block makes him glide to right there so uh you can attach these together and so then he's the uh elan starts over here where i drag him first and then glides over here so that is one way of care making characters move with these using these goto and glide blocks um and then uh and then to make a character say something there's these you know these say blocks so then uh amman could say hi batter scratch cat and smiley face um so let me move the scratch cat perhaps a little bit out of the way this story is truly truly wonderful um uh so uh so when the green flag is clicked uh amman will like go over here and then uh and then glide over there and talk to the other characters so that's a way you could uh talk have a character move and then talk to other characters so uh oh my gosh there are still so many great questions uh now we only have 10 minutes left so uh in a few moments i am going to start wrapping up and i will show uh how you could make an account in case you don't have an account and i will also show um how you can share your project if you want to uh but you know maybe i have time for one more quick question um uh someone asks um one last quick question someone asks um how can you use multiple backdrops for a story um you can go by hovering over this choose a backdrop button and then clicking choose and then you can uh choose any of these backdrops that you want so there's this colorful city one that i like a lot um and and you can add another one you can add uh let's see there's this nice uh beach um and then you can click uh you can there's this handy block next backdrop that you can drag out to go between them and i see that blank backdrop that i started with there so i can you can get rid of that you can go to the stage click on backdrops and then just hit delete on that uh so anyway so and now and now if you click back on uh amman which is where i put the next backdrop block you can switch between those backdrops um anyway uh so that's how you can uh do multiple backdrops thanks for the question um oh and i see a couple people asking can we see last week's projects uh so uh yet the stream had a an error where it got um the stream got ended uh right after i showed the beginning of this stream um but i think we i think will be hopefully we'll be able to upload uh both parts of the stream so you'll so in that first part i talked about last week's projects uh so hopefully uh well you'll be able to see the how i went through last week's project studio um in that video that we'll share i hope that will work um but if it doesn't work maybe at the beginning of next week i'll go over the last two weeks of studios um uh anyway thanks for those questions so as we we have eight minutes left uh let me show you how you if in case you don't have an account let me show you how you could make an account and share your project uh and if you're still working on your project that is totally fine uh you can just keep uh keep working um but let's say i i want to uh i want to share this project this lovely little story um and and to be able to share it uh you you have to make an account so to make an account just click this button up here that says join scratch and uh make a username to make sure it doesn't have your real name in it um make a username and then uh you know i don't know like a magic turtle with a bunch of numbers um and then make a password you know i don't know la la la la la one of my favorites um anyway you go through the steps of this form and then you'll you'll make an account and then you'll get an email uh asking you to confirm your account and you'll have to click confirm my account in that email um and but then once you confirm your account uh you will be able to share so let me show you how to share um i'm just going to switch to the view of me again uh um switch the view of me and log into my scratch account and i will show uh adding to the studio from there um take me a second um yeah thank you so much to everyone for bearing with us through the technical issues uh we will hopefully have them fixed uh you know hopefully that won't happen again either with the how the stream got interrupted but um uh but anyway thank you to everybody who still came along and joined the stream anyway even though we had those issues um it's all a learning process and i'm grateful to all for learning uh together with us um okay you do all right i am logged into uh my uh scratch account um so uh and let me uh go i i um you know so i i have this uh project here um i'll i'll just save it to my computer and then oh you know what let me delete that um save that to my computer and then i can upload it as a project in this account um also if you created your account while you had the that project open it'll also save it to the account you made um so i'm just gonna load from my computer oh yeah i went through that pretty quickly uh i went i went back to the scratch homepage and then i clicked on uh create up here to upload the project um sorry computers being a little slow thank you everybody uh so uh click load uh from your computer in this file menu you know click on on file and click uh load from your computer and then um and then in the downloads folder at the scratch project with my story and you can click okay replace the contents of the current project so the current one was just blank um uh and i will call this so tropes story and then uh you can click share and now it is shared uh and other and now you can send that link to people this this link up here to have other people view your project um but then there's uh what what how to how to share it with everyone else that we made the live stream with or that we made projects with during this live stream uh is you can in the video description below there is a link to the studio uh and right here it's the create a story studio so you open up that link and uh it should everyone should be able to add projects to this studio oh oh my gosh people made projects already oh my gosh i'm so excited to see these oh oh my god this is wonderful um so uh so let's click on add uh projects and then you can just add this project you made so i'll add that right now and yeah there you go now it's in the studio and so everyone can see it um of course you don't have to share to the studio if you don't want to but it's so so fun to see what everyone made because i just love seeing all the different things people will do with the same prompt um but yeah uh you can totally keep working on your project throughout the week uh and just keep sharing it share it to the studio anytime i'm gonna go in and take a look at all the projects over the week and just i love seeing what everyone made um and yeah uh thank you so much for joining this create along thank you for your patience as we figure out all this youtube stuff um the yeah uh you can always i don't know comment on my profile if you want story ideas if you still are trying to come up with a story prompt um and uh yeah the next live stream will be at this same time next week uh yeah next thursday at uh 1 p.m eastern time um and uh you know uh i don't think there's anything else to say um the i i just appreciate you all making this time to to do these projects together i seriously i'm not kidding when i say like this is the highlight of my week um yeah uh and but but uh let me know uh if there's uh i don't know if there's ways that the live stream could be different or more helpful for you you could send them the google form i'll keep reading them all week um yeah the you know how is that how is there enough intro to scratch um is anything confusing um yeah uh is there anything else um the i thank you for for sharing to the studio uh thank you for your questions i like love reading them all thank you to everyone who came up with story prompts when we were coming up with story prompts that was awesome just to have everyone contributing um and yeah i think i think that's just about everything um very very grateful for all of you and um yeah i'm so excited to do this again next week uh oh my goodness oh it's gonna be so good uh so stay tuned for next week's prompt i will see you all here again um until uh next time uh oh you know what let me switch to the video of my face um yeah so i can say goodbye to you all um until next time um have fun making your story projects i am so excited to see uh what wonderful wonderful creations uh you have dreamed up and uh yes uh scratch on you
