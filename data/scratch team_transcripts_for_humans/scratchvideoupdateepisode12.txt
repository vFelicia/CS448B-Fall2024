00:01 - hi everyone welcome to another scratch
00:04 - video update I'm Rick girls also known
00:06 - as for girls on scratch and I am Eric
00:08 - also known as visually on scratch and
00:10 - welcome to episode 12 welcome to episode
00:13 - 12 it's been a while so doesn't episode
00:15 - that is again regrets it isn't as an
00:18 - episode oh and we're a little behind
00:20 - schedule i think y'all were probably
00:22 - expecting this maybe two weeks ago sorry
00:24 - about that all right there but we have
00:26 - an amazing episode fell for you yes so
00:28 - what's that I think the first segment it
00:30 - is love it okay cool i remember that so
00:33 - this is a section where we talk about
00:34 - projects time the white claps projects
00:36 - that we loved in the community and so
00:39 - one that I loved was about it was sort
00:41 - of like an infomercial for a fake
00:42 - product I think it's fake and it's
00:44 - called Rudy pets and potato cat and so
00:47 - it's sort of like I don't know this is
00:49 - pretty cute and so it's essentially a
00:52 - root vegetable that you have so the
00:54 - potato would be that you dress up like a
00:56 - pet and it's like this really compelling
00:58 - three-minute infomercial to buy your own
01:01 - and I think it's wonderful and we shall
01:02 - check it out so I don't think we love is
01:05 - this project by cinnabon girl 13 come
01:07 - it's a thriller dance tutorial so if
01:10 - you're not familiar with driller it's
01:11 - this great music video by michael
01:13 - jackson and there's these zombies coming
01:15 - out and doing this really awesome dances
01:17 - but how to do it no problem because
01:21 - center one girl 13 created a project
01:23 - that takes you step-by-step yeah it
01:25 - shows you what to do with every part of
01:27 - your body and soon you can also join the
01:29 - three they make it easy so i mentioned
01:31 - the first project for a new pet was by
01:33 - users 23 did i mention that i think so
01:35 - just to mention it again anyways two
01:37 - awesome projects they should check out
01:39 - and we have the links here in the forum
01:40 - description well next I'm gonna step
01:43 - back so i always get your face try so we
01:47 - got a lot of things to try a lot a lot
01:49 - of things to try so we're coming up on
01:52 - our of code now what's our account it
01:55 - a global event that happens starting
01:58 - december seven and anyone who's really
02:01 - interested in getting started coding or
02:03 - doing more coding activities can do this
02:05 - hour of code activity and there's
02:07 - different tutorials to try and we
02:09 - created yeah I guess who's jesse is
02:11 - participating so scratch we have created
02:15 - some cool little hour of code activities
02:17 - so one is on the homepage on moda
02:20 - scratch design studio is the Alice in
02:22 - Wonderland 150th year anniversary and so
02:26 - you can go ahead we have some cool
02:28 - sprites you can use that are Alice in
02:30 - Wonderland themed their vector so
02:32 - they're really easy to change and
02:34 - recolor and things like that but you can
02:35 - do whatever you want as long as it's
02:37 - sort of alice and wonderland theme so
02:38 - that's part of our hour of code of stuff
02:40 - another said are sometimes i'm going to
02:42 - seem like animate your name or dance and
02:45 - since we have a new set that fits on the
02:48 - we bare bears okay it's a cartoon from
02:52 - Cartoon Network and install these three
02:54 - bears grizzly Panda I spare and you can
02:59 - create your own hide and seek project
03:01 - using these three bears but also kind of
03:04 - build on and use any of the other excess
03:06 - you crazy absolutely i think there's
03:07 - actually a basketball tutorial with we
03:09 - bare bears as well there's a lot of we
03:11 - bare bears stuff it's a very cute show
03:13 - and I'm so happy that it's part of our
03:14 - code and so that we have a very they're
03:19 - always special but I think this is a
03:20 - very special message from the scratch
03:22 - team and so we're joining you in the
03:25 - middle of members week at the Media Lab
03:27 - and so the media lab I think we might
03:29 - have said this in an early episode
03:30 - episode the Media Lab is sort of a bunch
03:32 - of research groups here at MIT one in
03:34 - which contains lifelong kindergarten
03:36 - where is scratch Christopher educated
03:38 - and we're funded by some awesome
03:40 - companies and those awesome companies
03:42 - come to visit us twice a year
03:44 - and they check out what we're up to and
03:46 - it's a great opportunity to also just
03:48 - find out what's going on around them
03:50 - rigorous and I like to go around as well
03:52 - and we're not a company let's the scrags
03:53 - give you updates company which is which
03:55 - is not in any way we so we took we just
03:58 - have to take along you through a tour of
04:00 - the lab and so there's a few projects
04:02 - that we're going to highlight we did
04:04 - this last time before but we just did a
04:05 - lifelong kindergarten just how we went
04:07 - to different research groups around the
04:09 - lab so with that let's just see in a
04:12 - couple minutes everyone we're in the
04:20 - changing places research group and i'm
04:22 - here with irm tears Lobos project yeah
04:26 - sure happy to so what we have here is a
04:29 - rapid prototyping interface for City
04:31 - Planning and we used tagged Lego objects
04:34 - very low-tech just like us on the bottom
04:36 - there's a color code but if we place it
04:38 - on our table we can detect it in real
04:41 - time and then project information about
04:43 - that building onto the building so what
04:45 - you see here is yellow residential units
04:48 - of this building and in red not office
04:50 - units and you can place it anywhere so
04:53 - over here you see a whole line of
04:54 - residential housing that we built in a
04:57 - row and if we run our simulation you can
04:59 - actually see a heat map that tells us
05:01 - about walkability and in red you see
05:03 - areas where walkability is not so good
05:05 - and in green you see areas where walk
05:07 - abilities is better
05:09 - what you can say about this is if you
05:11 - live here in these green areas you have
05:13 - great you can walk to your job you can
05:15 - walk to your amenities you can get to
05:19 - where you need to without getting in a
05:20 - car but in these areas here if you live
05:22 - here everything's pretty far away so
05:24 - let's see if we can fix that using our
05:25 - little lego model I'm going to put some
05:26 - office buildings nearby and some
05:29 - restaurants and maybe a gym and that
05:32 - makes us housing much more amenable to
05:35 - people going to walk as a primary mode
05:37 - of transportation well thanks for having
05:40 - us i remember i keep walking around
05:50 - castell de
05:52 - again so we're back at home base and
05:55 - lifelong kindergarten and one less thing
05:57 - that we're going to show you is by
05:59 - Jennifer thank you hey guys so I'm
06:03 - working on a tool that makes it easier
06:04 - for you to draw with programming but
06:07 - instead of program with blocks with text
06:09 - we're programming by selecting object so
06:11 - as long as I created by creating
06:13 - relationships between these different
06:14 - shapes and our copy I can do cool things
06:17 - like rotated to get a different take
06:20 - important and go and modify the color
06:22 - one of these objects you know get this
06:25 - gradation in a pattern and I can just
06:28 - experiment with different designs that i
06:29 - like until I get something I think it's
06:32 - cool so this is a easy way to get
06:35 - started using programming to create cool
06:37 - patterns and shapes thank you cool so
06:40 - well anyway you look to it hey oh that's
06:45 - really cool it is so inspiring to see
06:47 - the new things that are happening around
06:49 - the lab absolutely so I think that ends
06:53 - our end of the episode yeah we'll pull
06:55 - you back again and
06:57 - episode 13 whoa for the year ends before
07:02 - the year ends episode 13 get ready hi
07:05 - everyone scratch on
