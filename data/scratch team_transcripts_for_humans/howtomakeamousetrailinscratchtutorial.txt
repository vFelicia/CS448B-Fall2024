00:00 - - Hi everyone.
00:01 - It's Zoë from the Scratch Team,
00:02 - also known as Zinnea.
00:04 - Today, I wanted to show you
00:06 - how to make a mouse trail in Scratch.
00:08 - You can pick whatever items you want
00:10 - to be in the mouse trail,
00:11 - and I'll show you how to do
lots of different effects.
00:14 - Yeah, let's get started.
00:16 - So first, let's pick the object
00:18 - that you want to be in your mouse trail.
00:20 - You can hover over choose
a sprite and click choose.
00:24 - You could have a mouse
trail of scratch cats,
00:26 - or a mouse trail of hearts,
00:27 - or stars, or balloons, or rainbows,
00:31 - or, I don't know, the squirrel sprite?
00:34 - Really, anything you want.
00:35 - The first one I'll show is
a trail of Scratch cats.
00:38 - So to make a sprite
follow your mouse pointer,
00:42 - there's this block in the motion category
00:44 - that says go to random position,
00:47 - and if you click on the menu
00:49 - and choose mouse pointer,
00:51 - then whenever you click on this block,
00:53 - it makes the sprite go
to your mouse pointer.
00:55 - And if you put that block
inside a forever loop,
00:58 - then the sprite is always
going to your mouse pointer,
01:01 - so it's following your mouse
01:03 - wherever you go around the screen.
01:04 - Okay, so we have, not
exactly a mouse trail,
01:07 - but we have one sprite
following our mouse.
01:09 - Let's make this start when
the green flag is clicked.
01:12 - So when we click the green flag,
01:14 - the sprite is following our mouse.
01:15 - Now, how do we make it a trail
01:18 - so there's multiple Scratch cats
01:20 - following the mouse pointer?
01:21 - In scratch, you can create
duplicates of a sprite
01:24 - with this block in the control category,
01:27 - create clone of myself.
01:29 - So if I click on this,
01:31 - it creates a duplicate of the Scratch cat.
01:33 - So wherever I go,
01:34 - if I click create clone of myself,
01:36 - it makes another Scratch cat.
01:38 - And these clones don't
just have to sit there.
01:40 - You can make them do
things with code as well.
01:43 - And the way to do that
is, there's this block,
01:45 - when I start as a clone,
01:47 - if you drag out this block
01:48 - and put some code underneath it,
01:50 - the clones will do that
code when they're created,
01:53 - when they start as a clump.
01:55 - So for example,
01:56 - let's say when I start as a clone,
01:59 - change the color effect by 25.
02:02 - Okay, so we can make them change color.
02:04 - We could even make them do a repeat loop
02:06 - and change color a few times.
02:09 - So that will look like that
02:12 - and let's make it so that
02:13 - after they do their little color change,
02:15 - they disappear off the screen.
02:17 - So to do that we can add,
02:19 - delete this clone.
02:20 - So when I create a clone,
02:22 - it will do a little color
change and then be gone.
02:24 - So it's like the trail is always following
02:27 - where my mouse is
02:28 - and not staying too far
behind where it was.
02:30 - Now, how do we make it
02:32 - so that we're making
these clones constantly,
02:35 - as I'm dragging my mouse around?
02:37 - This is the part where
02:37 - it really starts to
feel like a mouse trail.
02:40 - You can put the create
clone of myself block
02:43 - inside the forever loop,
02:45 - and now you can drag the cat around
02:47 - and wherever it goes it creates a clone.
02:49 - So you get this effect
02:51 - where the cat is leaving
rainbow cats wherever it goes.
02:55 - Now, one important thing to note is,
02:57 - it's usually not a good idea to have
02:59 - a create clone of myself block
inside of a forever loop,
03:03 - because if a sprite
creates too many clones,
03:05 - it will make the computer run really slow.
03:07 - The reason it's okay here is
when a clone gets created,
03:11 - it does a little animation,
03:12 - but then it gets deleted.
03:13 - So we're never getting too many clones.
03:16 - So this base code will make a mouse trail.
03:20 - And the fun thing is,
03:22 - you can put all different kinds of things
03:24 - inside this repeat loop
and see what they do
03:26 - and you'll get different kinds of effects.
03:28 - So for example, you could
go to the motion category
03:31 - and put a change X by 10
block inside the repeat loop,
03:34 - and let's see what that does.
03:36 - So now the clones, when
they're getting created,
03:39 - what they're doing is
they're changing their color
03:41 - and then they're changing X by 10,
03:43 - so they're moving this way.
03:45 - We could also put in change Y by 10
03:48 - and now they're changing their color
03:50 - and then they're going upward.
03:51 - Or if we wanted to have
a sort of falling effect,
03:55 - we can change Y by negative 10
03:57 - and now the clones are, are going down.
04:00 - Also, here's one of my favorite effects.
04:02 - I like making the items in the mouse trail
04:04 - like spread out in every direction.
04:06 - So the way to do that is
04:08 - you can drag out this
point in direction block,
04:11 - which will make a sprite
point in a certain direction.
04:14 - And if you put in this pick random block
04:17 - and put in zero to 360,
04:20 - then it will point in a random direction
04:22 - from zero to 360 degrees.
04:24 - And if you do that,
04:26 - then if you click the move 10 steps block
04:29 - that makes a sprite go forward
04:31 - in whatever direction it's pointing.
04:33 - So, if you make the clones
pointing a random direction,
04:36 - and then inside the repeat loop,
04:38 - you put move 10 steps.
04:40 - Then before they start the repeat loop,
04:42 - they point somewhere random.
04:44 - And then they repeatedly move
in that direction 10 times.
04:49 - And that's how you can get this,
04:51 - like, I love this explosion effect.
04:53 - Also, if you ever want to switch
04:55 - what the object in your mouse trail is,
04:58 - you can just click on the costumes tab
05:00 - and pick a new costume.
05:01 - So I'll try something
else other than the cat.
05:04 - You could try putting in
a change size by block
05:07 - and put in a negative number,
05:08 - and then the items will
get smaller as they go out.
05:11 - I don't know what I'll try
negative eight or something.
05:14 - You would also, here's
another thing I love doing,
05:16 - if you want them to
fade as they go outward,
05:18 - you can put in a change
ghost effect block.
05:22 - If you change the ghost
effect of a sprite,
05:24 - it makes it get more transparent.
05:25 - So if I put that in here,
05:28 - okay, they fade really quickly.
05:30 - Let me change the ghost
effect by us small amount,
05:33 - like I'll just change the
ghost effect by five every time
05:36 - so they get a little bit more transparent.
05:38 - And there you go,
05:39 - now you have the objects
fading as they go out.
05:42 - You could also try,
05:43 - I don't know, putting in a turn block
05:45 - and see what that does.
05:46 - It makes the clones turn.
05:48 - See if you like that.
05:49 - Basically, I just recommend try any block
05:52 - and just put it in the repeat loop
05:54 - and see, see if you like what it does.
05:56 - Anyway, that's what I
wanted to show you today.
05:59 - I am so excited to see
all the mouse trails
06:01 - that people will make.
06:02 - If you want to use the code
from this starter project
06:05 - it'll be in the description below.
06:07 - And yeah, have fun making mouse trails.
06:10 - I'll see you next time and scratch on.
