00:00 - - Hi everyone.
00:00 - It's ZoÃ« from the Scratch
team, also known as Zinnea.
00:04 - Today I wanted to show you
00:05 - how to make a virtual town in Scratch.
00:08 - By the end of this video,
00:09 - you'll be able to make
a game like this one,
00:12 - where you can design your own town
00:14 - with your own characters in
it and your own locations,
00:17 - where the player can walk around
00:18 - and talk to different characters.
00:20 - You can use this to make your own story
00:22 - or your own open-world game.
00:23 - Or really anything you want.
00:26 - So, yeah, let's get started.
00:27 - So first let's pick a character to be
00:29 - the main character of the project,
00:31 - the one that we'll walk around.
00:32 - I'll just hover over, choose
a Sprite and click choose,
00:36 - and you can pick any character you want.
00:38 - I think I'll pick Jordan.
00:39 - Now let's add a background.
00:41 - You could click this button
that says, choose a background.
00:43 - If you want to pick one of the backgrounds
00:45 - that are already in Scratch,
00:46 - but you might want a top down background.
00:49 - So a background that's viewed from above.
00:51 - Let me show you how to draw
one of those really easily.
00:54 - So just hover over, choose a
background and click paint.
00:58 - And here's what I'll do.
00:59 - I will click on the rectangle tool
01:00 - and then I'll set the color to green,
01:02 - and then I'll drag a rectangle
that fills the whole stage.
01:06 - And now I'll draw a path across the grass.
01:08 - So I'll click on the paintbrush
tool and I'll set the color
01:13 - to an orange color and then
decrease the saturation slider.
01:16 - So that makes it like a
faded orange or a brown
01:19 - and then I will set the paint brush size
01:21 - to something really big, like a hundred.
01:23 - And then I'll just scribble
with the paint brush
01:26 - and yeah, there you go, that's a path.
01:28 - Okay, so now we have a really
simple top-down background
01:31 - of a part of the town.
01:32 - Next let's add a character
for the player to talk to.
01:35 - So again, I'll just hover
over, choose a Sprite
01:38 - and click choose.
01:39 - You can pick any character that
you want to be in your town.
01:42 - I think I'll pick the Unicorn.
01:43 - Let's make it so this character can talk.
01:46 - I'll go to the looks category
and drag out a say block.
01:49 - And you know, you can just click that
01:51 - to have the character say something.
01:52 - You can write whatever you want in here,
01:54 - and let's make the character
talk when we click on it.
01:57 - So to do that,
01:58 - I'll go to the events category
02:00 - and drag out when this
Sprite clicked block,
02:03 - which is good for making something happen
02:04 - when you click on a Sprite.
02:05 - So now when I click on the
Unicorn, it says, hello.
02:09 - So that's how you can add a
character you can talk to.
02:11 - Now, let's make the player
be able to walk between
02:14 - multiple different locations.
02:16 - So let's draw a couple more
backgrounds for our town.
02:19 - So I'll hover over, choose a
backdrop and click paint again.
02:23 - And now you get to think,
02:24 - what do you want to be here
at this location in your town?
02:26 - I think I'll make there be a house here.
02:28 - So I'll make another green
rectangle to be the grass.
02:31 - And then let me show you my
02:32 - extremely simple way of drawing a house.
02:34 - I will set the color to
brown and draw a rectangle,
02:37 - and then I will pick a
different shade of brown
02:40 - and draw another rectangle on top
02:42 - and then pick a different brown color
02:44 - and make a rectangle and
try to get it to line up
02:47 - with the bottom here.
02:49 - And I say, that's a house.
02:50 - Of course you can draw
it however you want.
02:52 - And you know, I'll also add
a lake on this background,
02:55 - so I'll just set the color to blue
02:57 - and draw a little squiggle.
02:59 - And let's draw one more background,
03:01 - so I will paint a new one and
make another green square.
03:04 - I think for this one, I'll
do three houses on a street.
03:08 - And if you don't wanna
have to draw a house again,
03:10 - you can click on this background
03:12 - and I'm gonna copy this house.
03:14 - To copy one shape, you could
click on it and click copy,
03:17 - but we wanna copy all three shapes.
03:19 - So I will click on one part
and then hold down shift.
03:23 - And while I'm holding down shift,
03:24 - click on the other two shapes.
03:26 - So now I've selected them
all and I will click copy.
03:29 - And then I'll go down to this
background and click paste.
03:33 - And now, I didn't have
to draw the house again.
03:35 - So I'll put this over
here, and you know what?
03:37 - I will paste another
house and another one,
03:40 - and maybe I'll make them
slightly different colors.
03:43 - So I can just click on any
part of one of the houses
03:45 - and change the color up here.
03:47 - And you know what?
03:48 - I will paint one road.
03:50 - Okay, nice, now we have
03:51 - three different locations for our town.
03:53 - The last thing I'll do is
03:54 - I'm just gonna name these backgrounds
03:56 - so that I can know which one
is which when I'm coding them.
03:59 - Okay, now let's make it so the character
04:01 - can travel between them.
04:03 - There's actually a really
easy way to do this.
04:05 - So let me show you,
04:06 - I'll choose another Sprite
04:07 - and I'm gonna add this arrow Sprite,
04:10 - and now let's make it so that
when this Sprite is clicked,
04:14 - it goes to the next backdrop.
04:16 - In the looks category, there's
this block next backdrop.
04:18 - And you can click on that to
go to the next background.
04:22 - And I will get that when
this Sprite clicked block
04:25 - from the events category
and put it on top.
04:28 - And now if we press it, it
goes to the next backdrop.
04:31 - And let's also add an arrow
04:33 - so that you can go to
the previous background.
04:35 - I'll add another arrow, Sprite.
04:38 - And then I want it to flip directions,
04:40 - which you can do by
going to the costumes tab
04:42 - and then clicking flip horizontal.
04:45 - And now, let's go back to the code tab.
04:46 - Now, when this Sprite is clicked,
04:48 - we want to go to the previous backdrop.
04:50 - And the way to do that
is in the looks category,
04:53 - you can drag out this
block, switch backdrop to,
04:56 - and in the menu, you can
choose previous backdrop.
05:00 - And now this block makes you
go to the backdrop before.
05:04 - And let's add the,
05:04 - when the Sprite clicked
block on top again,
05:08 - and there you go.
05:09 - Now, you can click this
button to go forward
05:12 - and this button to go backward.
05:13 - Here's one thing, right
now, the Unicorn shows up
05:16 - no matter what background you go to.
05:18 - Let's make it, so the Unicorn only appears
05:20 - at one of the backgrounds.
05:21 - So it's like, that's where
the Unicorn is in the town.
05:24 - So let's say the Unicorn is by the lake.
05:26 - So we only want the Unicorn to appear
05:28 - if we're at the lake background.
05:29 - Here's how you do that,
05:30 - in the looks category, there
are these blocks hide and show,
05:34 - and you can click them to make the Unicorn
05:36 - appear or disappear.
05:37 - And then in the events category,
05:38 - there's this block when
backdrop switches to,
05:41 - and you can use this block to
make a character do something
05:45 - when the background changes
to a certain background.
05:48 - So for example,
05:49 - I can make it so that when
the backdrop switches to
05:52 - house and lake, the Unicorn
will appear, it will show up.
05:56 - So let's go there, okay, yeah.
05:58 - Now, the Unicorn appears
when we go to the lake.
06:01 - And let's make it so that
06:03 - when we go to one of the other locations,
06:06 - the Unicorn will hide, will disappear.
06:08 - So when the background
switches to the path,
06:12 - I'll make the Unicorn hide.
06:13 - And when the background switches
to the houses in the path,
06:16 - I'll also make the Unicorn hide.
06:17 - So now, if we traveled
between the backgrounds,
06:20 - the Unicorn only shows up
at the lake background.
06:22 - And so this is really helpful because now
06:25 - you can make a game where
there are different characters
06:28 - at different locations,
and you can walk around and
06:31 - meet them all.
06:32 - Now, let's add one last thing.
06:34 - Let's make it so that the main character
06:35 - moves when you press the arrow keys.
06:37 - So that the player really feels
06:39 - like they're walking around the town.
06:40 - I'll click on the main character
06:41 - so that we can add code to her.
06:43 - In the motion category,
this block change X by 10.
06:46 - We'll make a character move this way.
06:48 - If you don't already know in Scratch
06:51 - X represents how far a Sprite is
06:53 - from this side of the screen
to this side of the screen.
06:56 - So if you increase X by
10, if you change X by 10,
07:00 - this Sprite will move this way.
07:02 - And if you change X by negative 10,
07:04 - the Sprite will move this way
'cause you're decreasing X.
07:07 - So that's how you can make a character
07:09 - move this way or that way.
07:10 - Let's make this happen
07:11 - when we press the right arrow
key and the left arrow key.
07:14 - To do that, you can go
to the events category,
07:17 - and there's this really helpful block
07:18 - when space key pressed.
07:20 - So this block can make something happen
07:22 - when a player presses a certain key.
07:24 - So instead of space key,
let's pick right arrow key,
07:28 - and I'll put it on top of
this change X by 10 block.
07:31 - And so now when I press
the right arrow key,
07:34 - Jordan moves this way, changes X by 10,
07:37 - and let's make it so that when
I press the left arrow key,
07:40 - she goes this way, so change
X by negative 10, okay, nice.
07:44 - And let's do the same
for going up and down.
07:46 - So going back to the motion category,
07:49 - so X represents how far a Sprite is
07:51 - from this side of the screen
to that side of the screen.
07:54 - And Y represents how high up a Sprite is.
07:57 - So if I change Y by 10, she goes up.
08:01 - And if I change Y by
negative 10, she'll go down.
08:04 - Let's drag out, when key pressed
block and choose up arrow
08:08 - and make the Sprite go
up, when I press that
08:10 - and drag out when key pressed
block and choose down arrow
08:15 - and make the Sprite go
down when I click back.
08:17 - So now the character can move
around with the arrow keys.
08:21 - So yeah, that's how you can
make your own virtual town.
08:24 - You could have as many
characters as you want
08:26 - or backgrounds as you want.
08:27 - Also this link to this starter project
08:30 - is in the description below.
08:31 - So if you want to, you
can always remix that.
08:35 - I hope you have fun making virtual towns.
08:36 - I can't wait to see them.
08:37 - I'll see you next time and Scratch on.
08:41 - (upbeat music)
