00:00 - is this thing on right now do we know I
00:03 - think it is oh oh hi everyone um my name
00:07 - is Eric also known to speak visually on
00:08 - Scratch and I'm Rick Rose also known as
00:11 - Rick Rose on Scratch and we're from the
00:14 - MIT scratch team and you're probably
00:16 - wondering right now why you're watching
00:17 - video on the scratch website that's a
00:20 - good question uh so we're doing an
00:23 - experiment a video series where we want
00:25 - to highlight three things one inspiring
00:28 - things that we're seeing in the
00:29 - community
00:30 - two cool creative things that you can
00:33 - try and three messages from the scratch
00:35 - team which could include uh highlighting
00:38 - new features and things going on in our
00:40 - headquarters here cool so with that said
00:42 - we can jump into our first segment
00:43 - called love it um and so these are
00:46 - inspiring things we've seen in the
00:47 - community and there are a lot of
00:48 - inspiring things but we just picked out
00:50 - one or two things um so what I found in
00:52 - the community um really inspiring was
00:55 - this collaboration and it was um sort of
00:57 - um organized by the user hello yo was up
01:01 - which is how I greet everyone when I see
01:02 - them um and it's called I Am the Doctor
01:05 - and it's essentially a massive animated
01:08 - project in map um and what what it is
01:11 - it's a story and different scratch users
01:13 - I think there was like 12 or 15 of them
01:15 - all created a different part of the
01:17 - animation and then hello yo was up put
01:19 - them all together in this really like
01:21 - long beautiful scratch project and the
01:23 - link to that is in the comments is in
01:25 - the description below this video cool
01:28 - well another thing that we thought was
01:30 - another collaboration done by Hobson DTV
01:34 - DTV and it's called the life of Baldwin
01:37 - and Hobson Dash TV starts It Off by
01:40 - introducing Baldwin who's kind of
01:42 - misunderstood by his parents wants him
01:45 - to become a sonographer but uh his true
01:48 - passions are dot dot dot and so at this
01:52 - point Hobson DTV ask the community to
01:54 - leave suggestions in the project
01:56 - comments for where the story can go and
01:58 - it's been really cool to see the story
01:59 - of
02:00 - so check it out cool and what else did

02:13 - these are cool things that are happening
02:15 - in the community um so you might have
02:17 - noticed the scratch design studio and
02:19 - essentially a scratch design studio is a
02:21 - featured Studio that has uh a specific
02:24 - theme and it changes every month uh and
02:26 - this month is Once Upon a dinner and
02:28 - it's essentially the the theme is if you
02:30 - could have dinner with anyone who would
