00:02 - [Applause]
00:10 - today i'll be teaching you how to make a
00:12 - simplified version of the chrome dyno
00:14 - game by google
00:15 - what you'd want to do first is choose a
00:17 - sprite you can choose one of scratch's
00:19 - default sprites which is what i'm going
00:20 - to do today
00:21 - or if you want to use the original image
00:23 - you can search it up upload an image
00:25 - onto your device
00:26 - and click upload sprite so i'll be
00:29 - choosing a sprite
00:30 - and i'll be choosing the dino sprite
00:33 - so here's our sprite and what we want to
00:35 - do now is decrease the size so it fits
00:37 - better in the board
00:39 - then have it so that every time the up
00:41 - every time the program runs we want it
00:43 - to start at exactly the same position
00:45 - so when this when the flag is clicked it
00:47 - will always go to this x and y position
00:50 - and we can pass this by moving it then
00:52 - when i click
00:53 - when i click the flag as you can see it
00:55 - will always move back here
00:57 - what you want to do next is go to
00:58 - costumes delete all the unnecessary
01:00 - costumes
01:02 - and create a duplicate of the first one
01:05 - we want to adjust it so that it looks
01:06 - like it's in a running position
01:08 - [Music]
01:10 - then to check you can go back and forth
01:12 - between the two costumes and the
01:14 - dinosaur will look like a cracker
01:16 - what you want to do next is create the
01:17 - obstacles so in the original game these
01:19 - are the campuses and once again you can
01:21 - upload the image through upload sprite
01:23 - instead i will be choosing a sprite and
01:25 - replacement of that
01:27 - and i'll be using the tree spray
01:28 - [Music]
01:32 - so here's my spray then i will decrease
01:34 - the size
01:36 - so that it fits
01:38 - [Music]
01:45 - function for the dinosaur so what you're
01:47 - gonna do is every single time you click
01:49 - the up arrow key the dinosaur will go up
01:51 - and down
01:52 - we can do this by going to control first
01:54 - hitting the forever loop so that the
01:56 - code replaces over and over again
01:58 - and getting the impedance
02:02 - so you can go to centic sensing get this
02:05 - block
02:06 - then have it set on so if up arrow key
02:09 - is pressed then the code inside this
02:11 - block will run
02:12 - what we want to put inside this block is
02:14 - the up and down motion
02:16 - go to the motion blocks
02:19 - and change y by 10 and change y by
02:22 - negative 10.
02:24 - what this does is it has a dinosaur
02:27 - change y position
02:29 - going upwards and going back downwards
02:31 - by 10 blocks
02:32 - then what we want to do is go back to
02:34 - control and get the review
02:36 - what the repeat does is it slows down
02:38 - the motion for both the going up and
02:40 - going down
02:41 - so that it's more so that it's a more
02:44 - smooth jump
02:47 - so here we can press play and you can
02:49 - test this by clicking your up arrow key
02:51 - [Music]
02:58 - now that we've programmed the dinosaur
02:59 - to move up and down every single time
03:02 - the up arrow key is pressed what we need
03:03 - to do now is program the tree for move
03:06 - to move from the left to the right
03:08 - so based on the jump of the dinosaur we
03:10 - can say that the tree should be a bit
03:12 - smaller so that the dinosaur can
03:14 - more easily jump through it then what we
03:16 - need to do now is put it back
03:18 - get when black is clipped and get the
03:20 - fur removing it
03:22 - we wanted to forever create a clone of
03:24 - itself
03:25 - then wait one minute sorry one second
03:30 - then every time it creates a clone of
03:31 - itself we want it to start at that exact
03:34 - position
03:35 - so you can get there go to this position
03:38 - so every time it starts it goes there
03:40 - [Music]
03:41 - then what we wanted what we wanted to do
03:43 - now
03:44 - is move to the left until it hits a
03:46 - particular x position
03:48 - so you can get the repeat until function
03:51 - then have it three p's until
03:55 - x the x position is less than
04:04 - we wanted to keep moving left so to make
04:08 - it move
04:08 - move left you can get the change x y and
04:11 - we can set it at negative the greater
04:14 - the number the faster the move
04:16 - then you can then go to control
04:20 - so that when it reaches the end this
04:22 - repeat will stop and it will move on to
04:24 - the next piece of code
04:26 - and when it's done repeating we want the
04:28 - clone to disappear all together so we
04:30 - can get the delete this one
04:32 - now we can test it and as you can see
04:36 - the trees are moving from the right to
04:38 - the left
04:39 - however as you can see there's a tree
04:41 - here there's a permanent tree here that
04:43 - creates clones of itself and we don't
04:45 - necessarily want that what we want to do
04:48 - is go to costumes
04:49 - and create a new costume but we want
04:52 - this costume to be black
04:53 - so every single tree starts blank until
04:55 - it starts moving
04:57 - to do that we can go the looks and
05:00 - have the costume to always start
05:03 - at the black costume but when it starts
05:06 - as a clone we wanted to switch to the
05:08 - tree
05:10 - [Applause]
05:11 - [Music]
05:21 - what we want to do now is create a game
05:23 - over sequence so we can do this by going
05:24 - to control
05:26 - so if our sprite is touching
05:29 - the tree we can have
05:32 - all we can have the program stop
05:36 - so when you press the button if i miss a
05:39 - tree
05:39 - the program will stop what you want to
05:41 - do now is create a backdrop to signal
05:43 - the game over so you can go here
05:47 - go to backdrops quickly get this
05:50 - backdrop and create your gamer backdrop
05:53 - keep it simple i'll just type the words
05:54 - here
06:00 - so what you want to do now is go back to
06:02 - your dinosaur code
06:04 - and every single time the game starts he
06:05 - wanted to switch the backdrop one so
06:08 - that it starts with the normal
06:09 - background
06:10 - then when it ends we wanted to switch to
06:12 - backdrop too
06:13 - when it starts as you can see when we
06:16 - miss it will now say game over
06:22 - what i forgot to do at the beginning of
06:24 - the program is use our costumes that we
06:26 - made earlier
06:27 - so what we want to do is every time the
06:29 - program starts we want to switch the
06:31 - costume
06:31 - costume which is a1
06:36 - but then throughout the code if the
06:38 - dinosaur isn't jumping we want the
06:40 - costume to switch back and forth between
06:42 - a1 and a2
06:43 - if we do that we can get another if
06:45 - statement
06:46 - so if
06:53 - [Music]
06:57 - then we want the costumes
07:04 - costumes so we can switch costumes about
07:07 - shoot day
07:08 - and switch costume to costume a2 but
07:11 - have it weights in the middle so that
07:12 - the change is more visible
07:21 - now when we run our code you can see the
07:24 - dinosaurs like smoothing
07:25 - [Music]
07:29 - we're basically done with our game and
07:31 - now the only thing we have to do is
07:32 - create the score variable
07:34 - so you can go to make a variable type in
07:36 - score
07:38 - and at the beginning of your program you
07:40 - always want to set score to zero
07:44 - then every time it jumps over a tree you
07:46 - want a trench four
07:47 - by one
07:51 - when i play the plate
07:55 - as you can see i was able to jump over
07:57 - only one tree and now
