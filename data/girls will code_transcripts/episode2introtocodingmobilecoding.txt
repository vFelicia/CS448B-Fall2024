00:00 - hi guys welcome back to our youtube
00:02 - channel
00:03 - um this video is basically a brief
00:05 - introduction
00:06 - slash recap of different languages
00:10 - and um the differences between these
00:12 - languages
00:13 - um it's just to give you a brief
00:14 - understanding before we move ahead with
00:16 - all
00:16 - our different coding series so let's get
00:19 - started
00:22 - okay um so just an introduction to
00:25 - languages and their differences
00:27 - um so there are about 700 programming
00:32 - languages
00:32 - including esoteric coding language
00:36 - um that's not a very important term
00:38 - right now oops so we won't define it
00:41 - um other sources that only list notable
00:44 - languages still
00:45 - count up to impressive 245 languages so
00:49 - those are languages that are
00:50 - used on a daily basis of all around the
00:53 - world
00:54 - computer programming languages um are
00:56 - used to communicate
00:58 - um instructions to a computer they are
01:02 - based on certain
01:03 - syntactic and semantic rules which
01:05 - define the meaning of each of the
01:07 - program language constructs
01:09 - uh here this is basically a list of the
01:12 - top
01:13 - 20 of the many languages that are
01:15 - available
01:16 - um the list is
01:19 - not the top 20 in order but it's just
01:22 - the top 20 in general
01:25 - um now coming to the most used language
01:27 - across the world
01:28 - i think the most used language across
01:30 - the world would be python
01:31 - evidently 31.2 um
01:35 - so the benefits of um python is
01:39 - python is widely regarded as a
01:40 - programming language that's easy to
01:42 - learn due to its
01:43 - simple syntax a large library of
01:46 - standards and toolkits
01:48 - and integration with other popular
01:50 - programming languages
01:51 - such as c and c plus plus in fact it is
01:54 - the first language the students learn in
01:56 - a lying program
01:58 - design program um it is a very popular
02:02 - programming language especially among
02:04 - startups and therefore python skills are
02:06 - high demand um
02:09 - so python is commonly used in um in
02:13 - um in a wide variety of applications
02:16 - including artificial intelligence
02:18 - financial services
02:20 - and data science uh social media sites
02:22 - such as instagram and pinterest are also
02:24 - built on python which is
02:25 - um it just shows how much python is used
02:28 - across the world
02:29 - um we've also done a series on basic
02:32 - python coding on our
02:34 - channel so please go watch it to
02:37 - understand and learn more about python
02:40 - um now up till now what we've covered on
02:44 - this
02:44 - on our youtube channel so if you look at
02:46 - our youtube page this is a screenshot of
02:49 - our youtube page
02:50 - uh you'll see that um we have covered
02:54 - python um scratch and
02:57 - we as coding languages and we also have
03:01 - a
03:01 - series of um women in stem which
03:04 - basically
03:05 - takes you through all the successful
03:07 - women um
03:09 - in stem field and how they grew and what
03:12 - they have accomplished
03:13 - so far um now
03:16 - um so now that um you know what
03:20 - languages are i'm just gonna introduce
03:22 - and tell you what our next
03:24 - series is going to be about so our next
03:26 - series is
03:28 - basically um using a mobile coding app
03:32 - to code and um
03:35 - the mobile coding app that we're going
03:36 - to be using is decoder
03:38 - very simple amazing love it easily
03:42 - uh you can use it very easily um
03:46 - it's a very basic and a very um nice and
03:48 - simplistic
03:50 - um app for mobile coding and you can't
03:53 - use it for
03:54 - big things but for a basic level for
03:56 - just understanding and learning purposes
03:58 - this is possibly one of the best apps
04:00 - that you could use
04:01 - um very easy to download you can
04:04 - download it on all
04:05 - ios or android devices um and it's
04:09 - completely free
04:10 - so the two main languages that we will
04:12 - be covering in our upcoming mobile
04:14 - coding series is html and css
04:17 - and to get a more understanding of what
04:19 - these two languages are and they're used
04:21 - on a daily basis
04:22 - please have a look at our next youtube
04:24 - video um
04:27 - that's it for now thank you so much for
04:29 - watching
04:30 - again please follow us on all our social
04:32 - media sites and subscribe to our youtube
04:34 - channel for more
