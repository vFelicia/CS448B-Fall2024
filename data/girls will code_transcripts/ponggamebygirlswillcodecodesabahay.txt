00:01 - [Music]
00:03 - hi today we're gonna learn how to make a
00:05 - simple multiplayer phone game
00:06 - which is gonna look something like this
00:08 - we have two players and they're both
00:10 - trying to hit the ball back and forth
00:16 - so let's get started the first thing i
00:18 - want to do is
00:20 - choose this price and search for paddle
00:24 - which is going to be what our player
00:25 - controls
00:27 - so i'm going to name it player one
00:32 - and i want it to be vertical instead of
00:34 - horizontal so i'm gonna change the
00:36 - direction to zero
00:38 - now since it's a multiplayer game we're
00:39 - going to need another one for player two
00:41 - so i'm gonna duplicate this
00:44 - [Music]
00:48 - we want the players to be on the left
00:50 - and right end of the screen
00:52 - so let's move player 1 to the left end
00:54 - of the screen and player 2 to the right
00:55 - end of the screen
00:56 - so we'll go to player one and
01:02 - we're gonna go to go to and we're gonna
01:04 - set it to
01:05 - x negative 225 and y equals zero
01:09 - that's gonna move it to the left end of
01:10 - the screen we're going to do the same
01:12 - with player 2
01:13 - but instead we're going to move it to
01:15 - x225 positive 225
01:17 - and that's going to move it to the right
01:18 - end of the screen
01:21 - [Music]
01:23 - now that we have positioned both the
01:25 - players let's move them up and down
01:27 - we're going to move player 1 up and down
01:29 - using the w
01:30 - and s keys so let's put that in so if
01:34 - the w key is pressed we want
01:36 - the player to move 10 steps in the
01:38 - direction that he's facing
01:40 - so since he's facing up he's going to
01:41 - move 10 steps off
01:43 - and since we wanted to move down when
01:45 - the s key is pressed
01:46 - we're going to move negative 10 so now
01:48 - it's going to move downwards
01:50 - we're going to do the same thing with
01:52 - player 2 but instead of using w and s
01:54 - to move up and down we use the up and
01:57 - down arrow keys
02:02 - so now both players can move up and down
02:09 - now it's time to create the ball i'm
02:11 - going to choose a sprite and look for
02:12 - ball
02:15 - i'm going to make the size a bit smaller
02:16 - so there that seems nice
02:20 - and so when the game begins we want the
02:23 - ball to go
02:23 - in the center of the screen so it's
02:25 - going to go to x0
02:27 - y0 and when it begins we want it to move
02:31 - towards player 1 first
02:33 - and then player 1 is going to hit it and
02:34 - then it's going to move to player 2. so
02:37 - since it's going to start moving towards
02:38 - player 1 first we're going to point in
02:40 - direction of player 1
02:42 - and player 1 is on the left so we're
02:44 - going to point in direction negative 19.
02:47 - so now we want the balls to always keep
02:48 - moving so we're gonna
02:50 - put a forever loop and in that we're
02:53 - gonna have
02:55 - a move block and we can change the the
02:57 - value
02:58 - so i'm gonna start off at seven but we
03:00 - can see if that's
03:01 - too slow or too fast and then we can
03:03 - change it around
03:08 - [Music]
03:09 - but now what we want is if the ball
03:12 - touches player 1 which means player 1
03:14 - hits the ball
03:15 - we wanted to start moving towards player
03:17 - 2 and likewise
03:19 - so essentially what we want is if the
03:21 - ball touches either player
03:23 - we want the ball to switch its direction
03:26 - so let's put that statement in the code
03:28 - so here is that statement so if the ball
03:31 - touches either player you want it to
03:32 - switch direction
03:34 - so we're going to do is go to motion and
03:36 - drag the point in direction block
03:39 - we want the ball to be pointing in the
03:41 - opposite direction so we're going to do
03:42 - that by multiplying
03:44 - our current direction by negative one
03:46 - and then putting that inside the point
03:47 - in direction
03:49 - so as you can see the ball when it
03:51 - touches either player it switches
03:52 - directions which is good
03:54 - however you can see it just keeps moving
03:56 - horizontally
03:58 - what we want to do is allow the ball to
04:00 - travel diagonally
04:01 - so that each player has to keep moving
04:03 - up and down to actually
04:05 - get to the ball so we're going to do
04:07 - that by bringing in a turn block
04:09 - so each time a player hits the ball the
04:10 - ball is going to go horizontally but
04:12 - it's going to go at an angle
04:14 - and that angle is going to range from
04:16 - negative 20 to positive 20.
04:18 - and you guys can change these values
04:20 - around
04:22 - another thing you want to do is add the
04:24 - if on edge bounce block
04:26 - so what happens is if the ball touches
04:28 - the top edge of the bottom edge
04:30 - it's going to bounce instead of just
04:31 - staying there
04:33 - so let's see that happen now we can see
04:36 - the ball does travel diagonally
04:38 - and if it does touch an edge
04:42 - it's going to bounce
04:44 - [Music]
04:50 - we also need to add score so we know
04:52 - who's winning but before we do that we
04:54 - need to create
04:55 - a mechanism to detect if a player has
04:57 - won the point
04:59 - for player 1 to win a point which is the
05:01 - player on the left
05:02 - for him to win a point player 2 has to
05:04 - miss the ball
05:05 - and for player 2 to miss a ball what
05:07 - that really means is that the ball goes
05:09 - behind
05:10 - player 2 on its right side
05:13 - so what we can do is create an if
05:14 - statement that checks if the
05:16 - x-coordinate of the ball
05:17 - is greater than the x-coordinate of
05:19 - player 2 that means that player 2 has
05:21 - missed the ball
05:23 - so let's put that in code so here we
05:26 - have that statement
05:28 - if the x position of the ball is greater
05:30 - than 225
05:31 - which is the x position of player 2 we
05:34 - know that player 1 has won the point
05:37 - now let's do the same for player 2. for
05:39 - player 2 to win the point
05:40 - player 1 has to miss the ball and what
05:43 - that really means is that
05:45 - the ball is behind player 1 and we can
05:48 - check that by seeing the x corner of the
05:50 - ball
05:51 - if the x coordinate of the ball is less
05:53 - than the x coordinate of player 1
05:55 - that means player 1 has missed the ball
05:57 - so let's also put that in code
06:00 - so here we have that so if the x
06:02 - position of the ball is less than
06:03 - negative 225
06:04 - which is the exposition of player 1 and
06:06 - player 2 has won the point
06:08 - so now let's create our two score
06:10 - variables
06:12 - player 1 score and player 2 score
06:22 - i'll move the player 2 scored above
06:24 - player 2 and
06:25 - i'll make it a large beat out
06:33 - okay so for this first if statement if
06:35 - the exposition is greater than 225
06:37 - we know that player one has won the
06:38 - point so let's change
06:42 - player one score by one and likewise we
06:45 - can do the same over here and change
06:47 - player two as a score by one if the x
06:49 - coordinate of the ball is less than
06:50 - negative 225
06:54 - now what we want to do is every time the
06:55 - game starts we want
06:57 - the scores to start off at zero so let's
06:59 - do that as well
07:03 - so another thing that we want to add is
07:05 - anytime a player wins a point
07:07 - you want to reset the game and bring the
07:09 - ball back to the middle
07:11 - so we're going to begin by whenever a
07:13 - player wins a point
07:15 - we're gonna hide the ball then we're
07:17 - gonna bring the ball back
07:19 - to the center so when x
07:22 - equals zero and y equals zero that's the
07:24 - center and then what we're gonna also do
07:26 - is
07:27 - point the ball in direction towards
07:30 - player 1 so in the direction of negative
07:32 - 90 degrees
07:34 - then we're going to show the ball
07:38 - and we're also going to add a weight
07:41 - block because we don't want the next
07:42 - round to begin right away
07:44 - we'll give the players a second to get
07:47 - back
07:47 - to the middle so this we're gonna put
07:52 - this
07:53 - code in both these if statements
07:56 - and another thing that we want to do is
08:00 - bring these move seven steps inside this
08:02 - forever loop
08:03 - because we don't want the ball to be
08:05 - moving when the game is being reset
08:08 - and now this should work so let's have a
08:11 - look
08:12 - [Music]
08:15 - [Applause]
08:17 - perfect so let's see the ball goes back
08:20 - to the middle and now it's going to
08:24 - start
08:27 - so another thing you want to do is when
08:29 - either player reaches
08:31 - five a score of five you're going to end
08:33 - the game
08:34 - but of course you could also make it 10
08:35 - 15 or whatever you like
08:37 - so let's put that in code so here we
08:40 - have that if statement
08:41 - if player one's a score equals five or
08:43 - player two the score equals five
08:45 - we're going to end the game so we're
08:47 - gonna go to control and then
08:48 - grab the stop all block and now this is
08:51 - gonna end the game
08:52 - so we'll put this if statement inside
08:54 - this forever loop
08:56 - and now anytime each of the players
08:57 - reaches a score of 5
08:59 - the game is going to end and that's it
09:01 - for this tutorial
09:02 - thank you all for watching if you have
09:04 - any questions please feel free to leave
09:06 - them in the comments below
