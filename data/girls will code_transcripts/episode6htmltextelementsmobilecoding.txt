00:00 - hi everyone in today's video we will be
00:02 - talking about html text elements and how
00:04 - to create text using html
00:06 - please note that all of the text
00:08 - elements that we will be discussing are
00:09 - placed in the body container within your
00:11 - html document
00:14 - so first off we have our h1 tag this is
00:16 - an html text tag used to define headings
00:19 - it ranges from h1 to h6 where an h1 is
00:21 - the most important
00:22 - usually meaning it's the largest and it
00:24 - carries the topic of your html document
00:28 - next we have our p tag this is an html
00:31 - text tag used to define paragraphs and
00:33 - text
00:34 - and note that all spaces and lines
00:35 - within a single p tag will be ignored
00:37 - see the example on the left to see how
00:40 - this plays out
00:42 - next we have our unordered list as
00:44 - denoted by ul
00:46 - each item in the list starts with the li
00:48 - tag and each item will be marked by
00:50 - bullets as you can see in the output
00:52 - next we have our ordered list which is
00:55 - denoted by ol
00:56 - this differs from the unordered list in
00:58 - that each item each item in the list is
01:00 - numbered
01:01 - as you can see in the output
