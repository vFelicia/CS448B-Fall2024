00:00 - hi everyone in this video we will be
00:02 - discussing html formatting and how to
00:04 - start your html document
00:06 - so first off here is your basic html doc
00:08 - format
00:09 - at the very top you have your doctype
00:11 - declaration followed by the html
00:13 - container and within the html container
00:15 - there's the
00:16 - head container and the body container in
00:19 - the head container you have your title
00:20 - tag and in the body container you have
00:22 - your h1 tag and your p tag
00:25 - so here's the structure for your html
00:27 - tags
00:28 - you have the opening tag then the
00:30 - content then the closing tag
00:32 - take note of the fact that the closing
00:34 - tag has a slash before it while the
00:36 - opening tag doesn't
00:37 - this tells the web browser how to format
00:39 - or display content
00:40 - an example for title is shown below
00:45 - next up we have the doctype declaration
00:47 - this isn't an html tag and it tells the
00:50 - browser what document type to expect
00:52 - it's usually placed at the top of the
00:54 - document
00:56 - next we have the html container which
00:58 - follows the doctype declaration
01:00 - this serves as the main container where
01:02 - everything except the document type
01:04 - declaration will be placed
01:06 - all elements will be placed between the
01:07 - html opening tag and closing tag
01:11 - within the html container we have the
01:14 - head container and the body container
01:16 - so the head container is a container for
01:18 - metadata which is essential information
01:21 - about the web page that isn't displayed
01:23 - to the user
01:24 - this includes the title meta statement
01:26 - css javascript and resource links
01:29 - an example is shown below of all these
01:31 - apply to the head tag
01:33 - but for the sake of simplicity we'll
01:34 - only be discussing title in this video
01:38 - so the title tag demonstrates the
01:40 - subject of the document it's always
01:42 - required in html document
01:44 - and an example of this is shown below
01:48 - next up we have the body container this
01:50 - is a container for content that will be
01:52 - displayed to the user it includes
01:54 - paragraphs headings images
01:56 - and etc within the body container we
01:59 - have header 1 and paragraph
02:01 - the header 1 and p tag will be discussed
02:03 - in our next video
02:10 - you
