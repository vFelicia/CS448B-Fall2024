00:00 - hi guys welcome back to our youtube
00:02 - channel so as you guys know we started
00:04 - uh we're going to start a mobile phone
00:06 - series which is
00:07 - um um using this app called decoder to
00:10 - code in two different languages which is
00:11 - html
00:12 - and um css so this video is basically
00:17 - some basic information about both of
00:18 - these
00:19 - about um decoder as an app and how you
00:22 - could possibly
00:23 - create uh files and just a brief
00:26 - introduction of the app as in general so
00:29 - let's get started
00:32 - okay so again just an introduction to
00:35 - mobile coding and decoder
00:38 - so decoder is a mobile coding app
00:41 - which um lets photos of all skills to
00:44 - code in up to 35 different languages
00:47 - um you can use uh decoder anytime
00:50 - anywhere
00:51 - um with decoder you can improve your
00:54 - problem solving skills by taking part
00:55 - and i'll go your challenges which i'll
00:57 - talk to you about in a while
00:59 - um decoders mobile ide has a unique code
01:03 - editor which is equally powerful
01:05 - um with features like syntax
01:08 - highlighting code compilation
01:10 - auto indent etc decoder is the fastest
01:14 - app of its kind and is less than 6
01:16 - mb in size um this is mostly because
01:18 - they use
01:19 - cloud compilers and cloud storage for
01:21 - their codes
01:23 - um now i'm just gonna show you a small
01:26 - demonstration of how you could um create
01:28 - a new file on decoder
01:32 - um full screen okay so in order to
01:34 - create a new file on decoder click the
01:35 - start coding option
01:37 - at the bottom right you get to choose
01:38 - any language from these but we will use
01:40 - html
01:41 - click next and type in your desired
01:43 - title in this case we're going to use
01:45 - hello world
01:46 - um and then create now refresh the page
01:49 - to see your new file and click on it to
01:51 - begin
01:52 - coding
