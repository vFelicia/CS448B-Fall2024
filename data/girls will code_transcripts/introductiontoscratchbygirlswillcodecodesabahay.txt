00:00 - hi guys I hope you guys are staying safe
00:03 - due to covert and you guys are having
00:06 - fun I know this is a very boring time
00:09 - and you need some fun activities to do
00:12 - so today I'm going to show you a very
00:14 - fun and interesting type of coding
00:17 - website just called scratch it's a very
00:21 - fun creative and easy language easy
00:24 - website and you can make whatever you
00:27 - want there are tutorials also for you to
00:30 - try different types of games so I'm just
00:34 - gonna give you a basic idea on every
00:37 - type of coding scratch and the different
00:41 - characters that you can add
00:43 - so please enjoy first as you can see
00:47 - there's already a sprite which is a
00:50 - character that they've given us in order
00:54 - for you to add more types of character
00:56 - you can go to the paint option and the
01:01 - pain option lets you make your own
01:05 - character for example i want to make a
01:08 - square so then it lets me lets me make a
01:10 - square and then i can color it whatever
01:12 - color I want in case you don't want to
01:16 - make a character on your own
01:20 - scratch provides some put some
01:22 - characters already so if you go to the
01:25 - chooser sprite there are a bunch of
01:28 - characters that you can see like cake
01:31 - cheese puffs you can choose whatever you
01:34 - want there are various categories for
01:36 - you to choose from so you can choose
01:39 - from that in case you want to add a
01:42 - background to it and then you can go to
01:44 - the choose a background option is the
01:47 - same as the character option you can
01:49 - either choose a background that they
01:51 - already have like harps and like stripes
01:56 - or you can create a background on your
01:59 - own or if you want to upload a
02:02 - background of your choice you can just
02:04 - go to upload
02:05 - you can download of image from Google
02:08 - and upload it for your background so
02:12 - these are the fun like the initial part
02:14 - of the entire code you can also add some
02:18 - sounds if you want for example they have
02:22 - various kinds of sounds if you want to
02:24 - add for example if you have a cat you
02:26 - can add a meow in case you want to try a
02:29 - new game here's something called
02:31 - tutorials which is over here and that if
02:34 - you click that then there are various
02:35 - options for you to explore from for
02:39 - example a pong game or maybe like
02:41 - animating a sprite or maybe and making
02:45 - your own name and you can click on those
02:48 - options and then they will give you a
02:50 - bunch of they will tell you what to do
02:52 - so you can do accordingly you can also
02:56 - edit your spray edit your game you can
02:59 - save it you can save by using the save
03:01 - option and so then you can also rename
03:07 - your sprite for example I will name it
03:10 - cat and then you can hide your sprite by
03:12 - clicking this button but then you can
03:15 - show it again
03:16 - then you can change the size also by
03:18 - making it 810 or making it say 1000
03:22 - that's a huge one but I'm gonna keep it
03:24 - 100 because it's convenient you can
03:27 - change the initial starting point so for
03:31 - example if I put X is U and Y is zero
03:33 - it's just in the middle but if I put X
03:36 - as say 30 it starts from the right so it
03:42 - goes accordingly you can do it however
03:44 - you want
03:44 - now the different parts of this website
03:48 - are the coding it's very simple because
03:52 - you do not have to type a code on your
03:54 - own all that if you do is drag it and
03:57 - drop it on the screen and then you can
03:59 - just like join a bunch of codes this way
04:02 - and make a whole game and stuff so I'm
04:06 - going to now explain the different types
04:07 - of codes that you can use so the move 10
04:12 - move 10 steps code is basically if you
04:15 - wonder
04:16 - if you want your character to move 10
04:18 - steps right or 10 steps left
04:20 - so I say move 100 steps so it will move
04:24 - 100 steps to the right or the left then
04:27 - you have the turn so you can make your
04:29 - sprite turn in like certain directions
04:32 - say you can make it turn 90 degree so
04:35 - it'll turn out to the right if you make
04:37 - it turn 1 180 degrees it'll go upside
04:40 - down it won't show you over here because
04:43 - we don't have a starting code yet but
04:46 - I'm just explaining the different parts
04:47 - also you can make it go to random
04:50 - positions for example if you have a
04:53 - unicorn and you wanted to like pop up
04:55 - from like a random location you can do
04:58 - that you can also make your sprite go to
05:02 - a certain position in your entire screen
05:05 - because it zeros you is the center but
05:08 - if I make it same 30 and 45 then it will
05:11 - go 30 to the right and 45 up and it
05:14 - didn't then the your sprite
05:16 - automatically goes to the top right
05:19 - corner you can also change your x-axis
05:24 - which is your horizontal up position and
05:28 - even change your y-axis which is your
05:30 - vertical position there's an option
05:33 - called if on edge bounce that means that
05:36 - if your sprite is moving and it touches
05:39 - the edge you can you can make it bounce
05:42 - off all by itself rather than having a
05:44 - whole new code so that's a very cool
05:47 - thing that you can add you can also
05:50 - change you can also make your sprite
05:52 - rotate in a certain direction say
05:55 - clockwise or anti-clockwise so if it's
05:57 - like a if it's like a boon or a Sun you
06:00 - can make it rotate so it looks more
06:02 - realistic um that's the basic like how
06:07 - to move a sprite from one place to have
06:10 - to move the character from one place to
06:11 - another now I will go to the part where
06:15 - you can make your characters say certain
06:18 - things
06:19 - say for example I press the say hello
06:21 - for two seconds so your sprite your
06:24 - character says hello for
06:26 - two seconds if I make it five seconds so
06:28 - then it'll say hello for five seconds if
06:33 - you want it to say hello for the whole
06:35 - time you can just press say hello and
06:38 - then it will say hello for however long
06:40 - New York game lasts you can also change
06:44 - this by saying let's say say cat for
06:48 - five seconds so then it'll say cat for
06:50 - five seconds and that's if you want it
06:54 - to say something if you wanted to think
06:56 - about something or some something like
06:59 - that saying you want it to think about
07:01 - kick so then you can press okay and then
07:04 - if you click it then it thinks for cake
07:06 - for two seconds and then it disappears
07:08 - you can also switch your costume which
07:12 - is you can switch how the sprite looks
07:15 - by moving it from costume one to costume
07:18 - two or you can change the background say
07:22 - for example you have a beach and then
07:23 - your sprite is walking and then you want
07:26 - it to go to like a desert a desert so
07:29 - then you can change switch background to
07:31 - sit the next background and then it will
07:34 - switch your background to whatever your
07:36 - next background is set as you can also
07:39 - change the size of your sprite because
07:40 - it's 100 right now and if you want it to
07:43 - become smaller you can change it to say
07:45 - 50 or if you want you to become bigger
07:47 - you can change us to 150 and you can
07:52 - also change the color or like the
07:56 - brightness of your sprites if example
07:58 - right now you can see it like it's
08:00 - properly you can see it fully but if you
08:02 - want it to become less if you wanted to
08:05 - become dull you can just change the
08:07 - color by say 25 or 50 and then it keeps
08:11 - getting lighter see if examples and
08:13 - change colors then it was initially
08:15 - yellow but then it changed to green
08:18 - you can also show and hide your sprite
08:23 - so if you say show and then it'll it'll
08:27 - appear for a certain time but then it
08:29 - will go off in whenever you want it you
08:31 - can just get the hide option and hide it
08:37 - you can go forward 1 layer 1 they're in
08:41 - the sense 1 like a particular distance
08:45 - and or like a background of stuff so you
08:49 - can make it go forward however much you
08:52 - want you can make it go backward also so
08:56 - that's the basic like what you want to
08:58 - try to look like or to think or say now
09:03 - I'll go to the sounds part which is a
09:05 - very fun fight because you can make your
09:08 - sprite or your character say different
09:12 - things and or sing different things so
09:15 - right now because it's a cat I am it's
09:17 - such - meow
09:19 - but say if it's like a dog you can start
09:22 - change to like a bark or something you
09:25 - can also record your own sound if you
09:27 - want your character to represent
09:29 - something else you can record that that
09:32 - sound and added also that's also
09:34 - something very fun then you can stop
09:38 - your sounds by just getting to stop all
09:40 - sounds option then you can change the
09:43 - pitch which is the intensity or the like
09:47 - the shakiness of your character you can
09:50 - get it down or you can make gate make it
09:52 - go up you can change the volume of your
09:56 - character by increasing it or decreasing
09:59 - and depending on what you want so that's
10:02 - a fun thing about the sound that you can
10:04 - add to your character then comes to the
10:06 - events part which is one of the most
10:08 - important part of your entire code
10:11 - because it actually um is like a
10:14 - starting point for your entire code so
10:17 - this is when the green color flag is
10:20 - clicked which is this flag this is the
10:23 - most important thing in your entire code
10:25 - because only if this option is available
10:28 - can you start your entire game so only
10:32 - if I press this will the sprite change
10:33 - color or stuff like that so every code
10:36 - should have this at the beginning of it
10:39 - for it to work successfully and there
10:42 - are other options also that you can do
10:44 - when things
10:45 - those spaces fixify only only if I click
10:48 - the space bar with my entire code start
10:51 - working or when when you give the option
10:54 - of one backgrounds which is two so like
10:57 - when you only when you switch your
10:58 - background to something else will look
11:00 - cold start working or when you switch
11:03 - the volume to something else your cold
11:04 - starts working so these are different
11:06 - options to make your code to start
11:09 - working these are the most important
11:13 - codes and your entire code like an
11:16 - entire code for the game then you have
11:21 - the control options so for like how long
11:24 - you want an activity to last
11:27 - say for example wait one second so if
11:30 - you have your sprite moving and then you
11:33 - want it to stop for one second then you
11:35 - can do that you can make it stop first
11:37 - five second you can make it stop at ten
11:39 - seconds for however long you wanted to
11:41 - if you want the sprite to do the same
11:44 - activity a certain number of times
11:46 - you can just make it to repeat say for
11:49 - example I make it to repeat 15 times so
11:52 - then it'll repeat the same activity 15
11:54 - times but if you want the activity to
11:57 - last forever and you don't not want to
11:59 - but like a certain number to it you can
12:01 - just say forever and the activity will
12:03 - keep going on until you press stop on
12:06 - your game so this is basically a forever
12:11 - option for you to keep picking the same
12:14 - thing happen over and over again now
12:18 - these are some difficult like some
12:21 - different things that you can do there
12:25 - they're gonna be a little bit complex
12:27 - for you so please pay attention to this
12:29 - this is something called as the if-then
12:33 - so um in case I want the sprite to move
12:39 - let's say move up so then my option of
12:43 - your should be if up arrow is quick then
12:47 - move ten steps then the the if-then
12:50 - option helps the sprite to do an
12:53 - activity all by itself so then if I say
12:59 - if okay if I do it this way so if the
13:05 - cat touches the color black okay let's
13:10 - set it to black then your sprite should
13:14 - say bounce back or then move ten steps
13:17 - or whatever you want so this is very
13:19 - important because you are telling what
13:22 - the sprite should do so keep that in
13:26 - mind and if you wanted to do two or more
13:29 - activities at once or like say this is
13:33 - so if it touches if it touches the black
13:36 - color then you can make it move ten
13:39 - steps to the right if it does not touch
13:42 - the black color you can move it ten
13:43 - steps to the left so this is basically
13:46 - an if or else option so you tell it to
13:50 - do something but then if it doesn't if
13:53 - it doesn't fulfill the requirements then
13:55 - it does something else so that's a
13:58 - pretty cool thing that you can do so you
14:01 - don't have to type two different things
14:03 - you can just do one if-else and make it
14:05 - one easy thing for you to do um you can
14:09 - also repeat an activity for however long
14:12 - you want say we can repeat the activity
14:14 - you can repeat like the rotation of your
14:17 - sprite until it touches back color or
14:19 - you can do stuff like that or you can
14:22 - wait for the sprite to do something
14:25 - until it touches black color you can ask
14:27 - the sprite can move ten steps to the
14:29 - left until it touches black other and
14:31 - then ask it to bounce back say that it
14:33 - can bounce back so that's something that
14:36 - you would want to think about doing so
14:39 - these are some important but fun and
14:41 - useful things but um scratch now you can
14:44 - make your entire game stop at a point
14:47 - which so this is called the star ball
14:50 - option where you can make everything
14:51 - stop or you can make only the sprite
14:54 - stop or you can make for example if you
14:58 - have three or more sprites and you can
15:00 - uh you can make all the others right
15:03 - stop and just make one sprite go at a
15:06 - time or so basically this is like a
15:08 - control option for you
15:10 - to like control the movement and control
15:12 - what the sprite doesn't stop it whenever
15:14 - you want then you have the sensing
15:19 - options so the sensing options are
15:20 - basically it's another cool and fun
15:23 - thing you would want to add so if you
15:27 - see there's touching mouse printer
15:31 - touching color if color changes today's
15:33 - it distance us okay so um if touching
15:39 - mouse pointer or let's just put it if
15:41 - touching edge then you can do it this
15:43 - way so if your sprite this is the edge
15:45 - then it moves five steps to the back or
15:48 - if it touches the edge it moves
15:52 - five steps up you can you can you can
15:54 - set it and that arm sense if just the
15:58 - way I told you before if it touches a
16:00 - particular color say like green yellow
16:02 - black blue or whatever is your
16:05 - background or something then you can
16:07 - make it go back or bounce back
16:10 - accordingly or move in whatever place
16:13 - you want if the color of the object
16:16 - changes from say purple to like yellow
16:19 - then it moves up down or whatever again
16:21 - and you can also ask for yours for the
16:26 - name of the person that's playing so for
16:30 - example this option would ask the
16:33 - person's name at the beginning of the
16:36 - game and only if the person answers can
16:40 - they move ahead so when you do this
16:42 - option and you have to enable the answer
16:44 - option just like by putting a click so
16:47 - if you ask ask what's your name they say
16:49 - for example your name is Ana so then it
16:53 - will put your name over here and then
16:55 - you can start playing your game so then
16:57 - you know who is playing the game at what
16:59 - time and stuff like that then you can
17:04 - also um you can also put this option
17:09 - where if you want the sprite to move up
17:12 - then you can press the up arrow so if
17:14 - the upper squid move sprite up if the
17:18 - down arrow is quick move sprite down
17:20 - if the left camera right or anything
17:23 - like that is click you can do it in that
17:25 - way there are also letters that you can
17:26 - click for it to move
17:28 - if I click space and maybe it can jump
17:32 - or you can bounce and stuff like that so
17:35 - um that's also very important thing
17:38 - because you are you want the sprite to
17:41 - move in the way you want so you have to
17:43 - ensure that you will you choose a right
17:45 - option and you know what you're choosing
17:47 - you can also set a timer for your game
17:50 - for example I want the game to be for
17:53 - one minute so then you have to enable
17:55 - the timer option over here as you can
17:57 - see because the green button is pressed
18:02 - so the timer is going on if I because
18:06 - the green button is pressed and will
18:08 - keep going on for however long you your
18:10 - game lasts or however long you want it
18:12 - to last you can also add like a year to
18:15 - your game because of 2020 so then we can
18:20 - say your 2020 and you can add a username
18:24 - so for example if your name is um let's
18:29 - see okay my name is realloc arya so then
18:31 - my user name would be Rhea and ur score
18:33 - acharya because that's what I have used
18:36 - to log in to scratch so you can add that
18:38 - also then sums the operators which is
18:41 - also another important part that you
18:43 - would want to take into account you can
18:47 - divide like you know how you add
18:50 - subtract multiply or divide numbers you
18:53 - can do that even over here so for
18:55 - example you can add two or more things
19:00 - at the same time so for example I can
19:03 - add um let's go up and see what we can
19:06 - add
19:10 - okay so what I can do is I can add like
19:13 - same timer and loudness in the same
19:16 - place so then while it's counting for
19:19 - the timer will also take the sound or
19:22 - the sound intensity of the entire
19:24 - project also into account so you can do
19:27 - stuff like that you can add numbers
19:29 - together or you can subtract or divide
19:31 - or multiply numbers for the object for
19:35 - the sprite to move you can also enable
19:39 - the option of pick a random number from
19:41 - 1 to 10 so you can ask the user to pick
19:45 - a random number from 1 to 10 and then
19:48 - depending on what number they pick they
19:50 - can move the spread in that way or
19:53 - something like that then you have the
19:57 - option of above 50 greater than 50 less
20:00 - than 50 or equal to 50 so that's safe
20:03 - though if the timer is 50/50 is equal to
20:07 - 50 then you can say and/or if you say if
20:12 - the timer is 60 is equal or you want the
20:15 - thing to say 60 is greater than 50
20:18 - because it's not because it's true you
20:20 - can also make the timer stop so that's
20:22 - some fun things you can do you can also
20:25 - join two or more sprites if you want or
20:28 - to wear more letters to letters together
20:30 - by using this join option so you can
20:34 - join say Apple and bananas if you have
20:36 - an apple and a banana over here as the
20:38 - sprite you can join them together
20:39 - or you can you can ask for what letter
20:44 - um for example the first letter in Apple
20:48 - is a so you can say some stuff like that
20:51 - also to add like a like a fun pipe to
20:54 - your entire project or your game
21:01 - lastly you can this is a very important
21:04 - optional so it's called the variable
21:07 - option so if you want to like create
21:12 - your own variable variable in the sense
21:15 - your own say
21:18 - tasks or like an operation or like a
21:21 - control you can do that also say for
21:24 - example I want the strike to move um
21:30 - slant like I want this pipe to move 30
21:33 - degrees to the right or rotate so then I
21:38 - can create a variable called rotate and
21:41 - then I can give it certain tasks to do
21:44 - and it's the same as the thing that we
21:47 - learned over here in control as for how
21:50 - long you want it to last or for like
21:54 - what time like repeat so then I can do
21:56 - that also by sing set the variable to
21:59 - last person 10 seconds or you can change
22:02 - the variable to last for 10 seconds and
22:04 - stuff like that so that's also an easy
22:06 - option for you to access if you don't
22:09 - find what you want to find I'll be here
22:11 - for you to add other stuff like if you
22:15 - want to add something of fun also to it
22:18 - that's not there above you can do that
22:21 - that you can add like a music or like a
22:24 - pen or video sensing or text-to-speech
22:28 - this this enables you to have like a
22:31 - one-on-one interaction with your user so
22:35 - you can do stuff like that also it's fun
22:37 - it's easy it's nice it's cool one last
22:40 - thing that I would want to talk about is
22:42 - the shape of your the shape of the code
22:47 - so these are the five different shapes
22:50 - that you can see in your entire code
22:56 - so this as you can see has just one
23:00 - little triangle thingy at the bottom
23:02 - which means that this has to be your
23:05 - starting requirement for an entire code
23:08 - so you cannot add any other function
23:11 - above this but then when I save one
23:13 - triangle as quick as you can see view
23:15 - there's a hollowed triangle also so you
23:18 - I can attach these together and it will
23:20 - do the task for me if I want I can also
23:25 - do it this way where I can say go to and
23:28 - then you can see that this one is white
23:30 - like Y is equal to white in color and
23:33 - then circular and this is also circular
23:35 - I can attach this in this together so in
23:38 - it does two functions in one I can also
23:42 - do it in a way success because this has
23:45 - a triangle on top a hollow triangle I
23:47 - can attach these two together bring this
23:50 - in the middle of them and then repeat
23:53 - until and then you see there is a
23:55 - triangle like a hexagon option here this
23:58 - is also a hexagon so I can attach this
24:01 - over here so then this code basically
24:03 - tells me so when I when this green
24:05 - triangles clipped so basically when I
24:07 - start my entire code I want the code to
24:11 - run till I click the space bar so till
24:15 - the user clicks the space bar and the
24:18 - code should be that the object should go
24:21 - to 26 degrees x and y as whatever is the
24:26 - X so y equals 26 so this is the entire
24:30 - code and this will last for however long
24:32 - you press the space bar so you can do
24:35 - different stuff like that I know it
24:37 - sounds very complex when I explain it
24:39 - but it's trust me it's not that complex
24:42 - all you need is some practice and some
24:44 - time on your own to spend over this and
24:47 - you will be perfectly fine I know so
24:51 - many people who have just like learned
24:53 - and then they've got enough become a pro
24:55 - at it after trying to work more game so
24:58 - try have fun with it do games and after
25:04 - you make your games please send it
25:06 - on Instagram our account as girls will
25:09 - code so please send it we will promote
