00:00 - hi everyone this is the first of several
00:02 - videos of an intro to python series
00:04 - in this series i'm going to teach you
00:06 - the basics of python programming
00:07 - although we're going to learn python and
00:09 - its syntax the concepts you learn in
00:11 - this series
00:11 - are applicable to all other programming
00:13 - languages as well
00:15 - python is a great language to begin with
00:17 - because it is much more concise and easy
00:18 - to read than other languages like java
00:21 - which will allow you to pick up the
00:22 - concepts easily and move to more
00:24 - advanced topics faster
00:26 - python is also a very versatile language
00:29 - with python
00:30 - you can build almost anything from
00:31 - software to mobile apps
00:33 - web apps scientific simulations and much
00:36 - more in this series i'm going to be
00:37 - explaining the concepts through my code
00:39 - editor
00:40 - what you all can do is follow along with
00:42 - the syntax type it out yourself
00:44 - in a python script editor try stuff out
00:46 - and experiment
00:47 - i'm going to be using vs code but you
00:49 - can also use pycharm or an online editor
00:52 - i've attached links in the description
00:54 - on how you can download and begin with
00:56 - any of these editors
00:58 - let's get started one of the most basic
01:00 - but highly important concepts
01:02 - in any programming language is getting
01:03 - the computer program to communicate with
01:05 - you
01:06 - the programmer in python a print
01:08 - statement
01:09 - is used to do so let's look at an
01:11 - example of how a print statement would
01:13 - work in a program
01:14 - if i wanted to write a program to add
01:16 - the numbers 9 and 10 together
01:18 - i would put that instruction here in the
01:19 - text editor in these lines
01:21 - we'll get into what particular stuff to
01:23 - actually type here later on
01:25 - but for now let's assume we've written
01:27 - code that instructs the computer to add
01:28 - the two numbers
01:29 - nine and ten for the computer to
01:32 - actually perform the computation
01:33 - you would need to run the program so
01:35 - first we have to save the file
01:37 - you can do that by command s or you
01:39 - could go file and click save
01:42 - after that we click this button over
01:44 - here which runs the program
01:46 - then once the computer performs the
01:48 - addition we want it to tell us the
01:50 - answer
01:50 - that's when the print statement is used
01:52 - and the answer will then be
01:54 - displayed in this terminal over here if
01:57 - there wasn't a print statement the
01:58 - computer would
01:59 - still do the addition but it would not
02:01 - display the result to us
02:03 - which is pointless so essentially the
02:05 - print statement is a way for the
02:07 - computer to
02:08 - communicate with and display information
02:10 - to the user
02:12 - so let's start using it the first step
02:15 - to make a program print
02:16 - something is by typing the keyword print
02:19 - then you need to add
02:20 - opening and closing parentheses these
02:23 - must be there
02:24 - next we go in between the opening and
02:27 - closing parentheses
02:28 - and add a set of quotation marks it can
02:30 - be double quotes
02:32 - or single quotes it's really up to your
02:34 - own preference but make sure you're
02:35 - consistent
02:36 - you shouldn't use a single code to begin
02:38 - with and a double quote to end
02:39 - or vice versa whenever you want to print
02:42 - any text like hello
02:44 - or hi or anything else these quotation
02:46 - marks must be present
02:48 - and the text you want to print out will
02:50 - be placed between the quotation marks
02:53 - like such so let's print something
02:57 - what i've done over here is type in the
02:58 - keyword print have my opening and
03:00 - closing parenthesis
03:02 - have a set of quotation marks and in
03:04 - between those quotation marks is what i
03:06 - want
03:07 - to be printed onto the console so i'll
03:10 - say hello world
03:11 - and now when i save my file so command s
03:14 - and i run the program you can see over
03:16 - here that it prints out hello
03:18 - world so this is it for this
03:20 - introduction video
03:21 - in the next video we're going to learn
03:22 - about variables and data types so stay
03:24 - tuned for that
03:25 - thank you for watching
