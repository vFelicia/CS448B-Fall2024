00:00 - hi everyone in today's video we will be
00:02 - talking about html attributes and how to
00:04 - add additional information to a text
00:06 - element
00:07 - first up we have our a tag this denotes
00:09 - a hyperlink and the hdraft attribute is
00:11 - placed within the opening a tag to
00:13 - identify the url that will then be
00:15 - linked to the text
00:16 - the link text is placed between the a
00:18 - tags the output of the code on the right
00:20 - is shown below
00:24 - next we have our image tag this
00:25 - indicates that you're adding an image
00:27 - and the src attribute
00:29 - specifies the path to that image it has
00:31 - no closing tag since no text is added
00:33 - and is not a container
00:35 - the image is also referenced within the
00:37 - text as you can see on the right there
00:39 - are two different ways to represent this
00:40 - we have the
00:41 - relative url and absolute url the
00:44 - relative url
00:45 - is used when the image is hosted in the
00:47 - website and the absolute url is if
00:50 - you're linking an image found online
00:54 - next up we have classes which isn't a
00:55 - tag but what it does is it associates
00:58 - the class name with a certain element
01:00 - it's typically used to point a class to
01:03 - point to a class in a style sheet or
01:04 - reference javascript
01:06 - as you can see on the right this is
01:08 - located within the first
01:10 - the first tag of a text element
