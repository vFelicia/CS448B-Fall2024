00:00 - hello everyone welcome back to our
00:02 - youtube channel hope you guys are coping
00:04 - well during quarantine
00:06 - um as you guys know we've done quite a
00:08 - few series
00:09 - and stimulated concepts on this youtube
00:11 - channel
00:12 - um i just wanted to give you a brief
00:14 - summary before we introduce our new
00:16 - series that we're going to start
00:18 - so let's begin
00:22 - okay so this is just a quick summary of
00:24 - coding and programming
00:27 - um you've seen the craze for learning
00:29 - code
00:30 - but what exactly is coding coding is
00:33 - what makes it possible for
00:34 - us to create computer software apps
00:37 - and websites your browser your os
00:41 - the apps on your phone facebook this
00:44 - website google slides
00:46 - they're all made with code if you don't
00:49 - know
00:49 - the first thing about coding you've come
00:51 - to the right place
00:52 - we've put together a bunch of videos and
00:55 - um
00:56 - series to help you understand coding and
00:58 - the different languages
01:00 - that are available for you to code for
01:02 - different uses
01:04 - um so why do we code
01:07 - outside of the implication of coding
01:09 - which looks good on your resume for your
01:11 - university
01:12 - um coding actually does boost skills
01:15 - which are actually useful for most
01:17 - jobs uh problem solving and logical
01:20 - logics are like the two main or the most
01:22 - important reasons why people code
01:25 - um doing such codes activates your left
01:28 - side of the brain which is basically
01:29 - your problem-solving brain which
01:31 - would help you later think faster in um
01:34 - stimulated subjects at least
01:37 - um what what is coding used for
01:41 - simply foot coding is used for
01:42 - communication with computers
01:44 - uh people use coding to give computers
01:46 - and other machine instructions on what
01:49 - actions to perform further we use it to
01:52 - program the websites apps and other
01:54 - technologies that we use or interact
01:56 - with
01:57 - on a daily basis um some
02:00 - coding jobs uh there are a bunch of
02:03 - coding jobs that you can do
02:05 - um so in the software development which
02:08 - is basically a massive field with
02:10 - plenty of career opportunities um
02:13 - there's
02:13 - coding like software engineering cloud
02:16 - engineering and database developer
02:18 - for artificial intelligence coding there
02:21 - is
02:22 - um machine learning engineering deep
02:24 - learning engineering data scientists
02:27 - and mobile development and our final
02:30 - category
02:30 - is web development which includes front
02:32 - and back developer and ux developer
02:35 - um to know more about these i think it's
02:37 - the best if you google it
02:38 - because we don't want to go too much
02:40 - into it
02:42 - um now usually when we think about
02:45 - coding we associate
02:46 - it mostly to stem related subjects but i
02:49 - think
02:50 - it is important for us to understand how
02:52 - coding is used
02:53 - in medical fields today
02:56 - medical coding professionals help ensure
02:58 - that codes are applied correctly
03:01 - during medical billing process which
03:03 - includes abstracting the information
03:05 - from a documentation
03:07 - assigning the appropriate codes and
03:09 - creating a claim to be paid by
03:11 - insurance carriers accurate coding is
03:14 - critical
03:15 - an incorrect code becomes a permanent
03:18 - part of a patient's record
03:20 - it can affect a patient's healthcare and
03:22 - delay physician reimbursement
03:24 - because the patient's claim may be
03:26 - rejected due to an incorrect code
03:29 - um so coding is also used for
03:34 - making all the technologies um like ct
03:36 - scans
03:37 - and um ultrasound and stuff like that
03:40 - because
03:41 - like machines work based on the code
03:43 - that we give them so
03:44 - in order for that to work coding is very
03:47 - important and putting in the right
03:49 - code is more important so uh
03:52 - you could take coding and then go to a
03:54 - medical field and maybe do
03:56 - bioengineering which would help you make
03:58 - equipment that could be used for
04:00 - surgeries
04:02 - um that'd be it thank you so much for
04:05 - watching our video please follow us on
04:06 - all our social media platforms and
