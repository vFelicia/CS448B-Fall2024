00:40 - or whatever you use i'm going to use
00:41 - opera because it's uh it's the browser i
00:44 - use and after that you just type in code
00:46 - combat like so and then uh

02:37 - world right here and there is a lot of
02:39 - stuff we can do but of course we have to
02:41 - start off with number one since all of
02:43 - them are locked and today i'm not going
02:45 - to be doing all of them i'm just going
02:46 - to be doing um
02:48 - i'm going to be doing only this one
02:49 - there's so much uh to learn there's like
02:51 - simple ai scripting uh create uh keep
02:55 - learning html
02:56 - arithmetic
02:58 - arithmetic arithmetic uh bro i can't say
03:01 - arithmetic okay counters while loops
03:03 - break uh blah blah advanced techniques
03:06 - okay so we're going to just be starting
03:08 - with kit guard dungeon today so click
03:10 - play
03:11 - and there is sound but if you don't like
03:13 - it you can mute the tab i'm going to
03:14 - mute it a little bit because it's a bit
03:16 - too loud it's a little distracting so
03:18 - here where's where you start and you
03:21 - keep on going until you're out at exit
03:24 - right here so we can click right here
03:26 - and we can click play and you can choose
03:29 - your heroes from this guy to this guy
03:31 - because we can't really choose these
03:33 - since uh
03:35 - we have to subscribe um so i'm not gonna
03:37 - choose that i'm gonna choose uh this guy
03:40 - i played this at school before and i
03:41 - played with this guy
03:43 - this doesn't really matter um because i
03:46 - don't know i when i do it it doesn't
03:48 - really do anything you can choose any
03:50 - character you want definitely not this
03:52 - guy this is one of the worst people look
03:54 - look at their stats like come on okay
03:56 - i'm gonna shoot this guy and click next
03:59 - and why is he so short um we're going to
04:02 - click equip
04:03 - and then we can click play equip is just
04:05 - a little accessory we can use uh because
04:09 - it gives us a little
04:11 - uh
04:12 - functions move down move left move right
04:13 - move up so we can uh
04:15 - actually code and here we have a simple
04:18 - task uh for us to do we can we have to
04:22 - get grab the treasure i'm gonna click
04:24 - escape we just grab the treasure and we
04:26 - have to not die to the spike so move
04:28 - down after that move right
04:30 - like so and then
04:32 - uh move i think that's it so we can
04:34 - click run move down move that all right
04:36 - move right move down move right and
04:38 - there you go we collected the gem and
04:39 - that's it we're done and that's how to
04:42 - uh complete it there is like a little
04:45 - uh how do you call that achievements or
04:48 - goals that we have to do and if we
04:50 - complete it we'll go to success and
04:52 - click done right here and there you go
04:54 - you get your victory whatever uh you can
04:57 - there's also leaderboards by the way uh
05:00 - and you can see i'm number four i'm tied
05:02 - with everybody else with 7.7 seconds all
05:05 - time is three seconds 3.5 but i'm pretty
05:08 - sure they're just using a macro these
05:10 - are really long time ago too seven years
05:11 - ago but i'm pretty sure it's uh like um
05:14 - like a macro like they just have it on
05:16 - their mouse press it
05:18 - yo yo
05:20 - uh i'm gonna watch them
05:24 - back then back then they didn't even
05:26 - have move forwards hold on
05:29 - so since this was like seven years ago
05:31 - right before code combat was even like
05:34 - uh like more advanced like nowadays they
05:36 - had to have like self move uh x dot y
05:40 - uh self dot position x plus 11 self
05:43 - position a y
05:44 - plus one man that must be hard and then
05:47 - they have self cast haste so you can see
05:50 - they make themself have haste and then
05:53 - that made them go much faster than the
05:54 - normal person would
05:56 - wow
05:58 - yeah that's fast okay but anyways we're
06:00 - gonna go to um
06:02 - go back and then we're gonna click out
06:04 - and we're going to rest on to the other
06:07 - one gems in the deep i'm going to do 10
06:09 - or something today as you can see we've
06:11 - got a new item it's called the leather
06:14 - belt and it's a thick belt that adds a
06:15 - little extra help okay we're going to
06:17 - click play and you can even change your
06:19 - language if you want but i'm going to
06:20 - stick with python so we're going to move
06:22 - right we're going to move down and this
06:24 - practice python for us because
06:26 - instead of just coding programs and
06:28 - stuff you can actually like implement it
06:30 - into like a game and it's more fun for
06:33 - everybody you can see our goals are to
06:36 - afford the spikes and collect the gems
06:38 - and we did just that we avoided the
06:39 - spikes grab the gems with a code uh
06:42 - simple move right move down move up move
06:44 - up right and from here this x actually
06:47 - looks very simple but it's going to be
06:50 - um it's going to start to get more
06:51 - advanced as we go on so i i don't know
06:54 - i'm competitive i want to check my stats
06:56 - what they
06:57 - oh they're that quicker than me man well
07:01 - that means i'm quicker than them right
07:02 - i'm not sure but uh that's from the
07:05 - latest so all time
07:08 - all time is 3.7 seconds wow that's
07:10 - really quick all right let's move on to
07:11 - the next one shadow guard
07:13 - uh there's no there's nothing that we
07:15 - can unlock yet
07:16 - we're gonna lock this guy pretty good at
07:18 - protecting your innards um or health
07:21 - times one point one i locked 67 or
07:25 - a glove i think i'll go with the
07:27 - go to the tarnish bronze thing okay
07:29 - let's confirm
07:31 - yey we have a
07:33 - chest plate okay we can click play it's
07:35 - pretty fun um it reminds me like dot a
07:38 - and
07:39 - yeah i played at school it's really
07:41 - competitive there's like a
07:43 - dueling thing
07:44 - and it was like fun for just
07:46 - doing your friends all right so we have
07:48 - to not running the spikes don't let the
07:50 - ogre see you so this guy and we have to
07:54 - get get all the gems so instead of
07:55 - moving forwards we have to move around
07:58 - right so
07:59 - click move
08:01 - move up
08:03 - right move up and then from there we
08:05 - move right again
08:07 - move right
08:08 - and then move down
08:11 - oh shoot move
08:13 - down
08:14 - move right all right and then now we
08:16 - should be good okay let's see
08:18 - uh don't see us nice okay now we go up
08:21 - as you can see goes to success we can
08:22 - just press done
08:24 - uh and there you go victory we're gonna
08:26 - click continue
08:28 - and our next one is enemy mine and uh
08:31 - let's see can you unlock anything
08:34 - uh
08:34 - this is the daily quest we it gives you
08:37 - extra gems but honestly i don't really
08:39 - care i just press done and i'll just
08:41 - press play and then i will it's
08:43 - restricted
08:45 - what
08:46 - man that's not fun all right so let's
08:49 - press enemy mind let's play it
08:51 - play
08:52 - and uh now there's start to getting like
08:56 - uh
08:57 - like this is like the local variable for
08:58 - functions you know when you define it
09:00 - you have little
09:01 - uh variable you can put in yeah that's
09:03 - how that's what you're doing right now
09:05 - you can put in two to move twice all
09:08 - right let's see this map oh wow this is
09:10 - a this is quite a big map okay let's
09:12 - zoom out a bit
09:14 - okay
09:15 - so what do we have to do we have to
09:17 - avoid the fire traps i'm going to assume
09:19 - that these are the fire traps
09:21 - we have to
09:22 - get the gem so the gem is all the way at
09:24 - the exit so if we get the gem we're
09:26 - basically at the exit and then use five
09:28 - lines or co of code or less
09:30 - so i'm gonna go this way then up right
09:34 - down
09:35 - and then right again all right so that
09:37 - shouldn't be too hard we move right
09:38 - three times and then we move up once so
09:40 - move up
09:42 - move right
09:43 - and then move down one two three so move
09:46 - down three
09:48 - times
09:50 - move down three times and then move
09:52 - right twice
09:55 - like so we should be okay oh the goals
09:58 - are still incomplete let's see why
10:01 - oh shoot oh shoot that's not good okay
10:04 - wait what did we do okay move up no i
10:06 - meant move down okay move down like so
10:09 - okay let's see
10:11 - man that was brutal oh my gosh
10:14 - uh
10:15 - it's still not working why is it okay
10:17 - wait wait hold on there's something
10:19 - wrong so we move up right and then we
10:21 - move right
10:23 - and then what happens from there
10:25 - why do we why do we move up i i said
10:27 - move down
10:29 - huh
10:31 - wait a minute is it bugged oh no
10:34 - uh let's try rewriting the code move
10:37 - down
10:38 - move down
10:39 - three times okay
10:41 - hopefully it works
10:42 - ah finally okay
10:44 - there's like a bug in the system or
10:46 - something okay
10:47 - go go go
10:49 - nice
10:50 - oh i want to see the ogre getting
10:51 - demolished okay let's watch this
10:54 - boom yeah ll okay we've done this one
10:58 - and let's click on
11:00 - continue
11:01 - and then our next one is true names okay
11:04 - let's see what this one does all right
11:06 - so now we're going to have a new
11:07 - equipment which is about the sword
11:10 - um that it makes it so that we can
11:12 - attack the ogres so yeah
11:17 - okay i see rack and tread this uh is
11:20 - very menacing okay so if we were to run
11:23 - this right now we would hero would go up
11:25 - and attack brac
11:27 - all right
11:28 - and then we have to get the gem and kill
11:30 - treg right
11:32 - okay so
11:33 - well not kill i guess attack okay attack
11:36 - trek twice and collect the gem uh we
11:38 - don't need to
11:40 - exit right yeah i don't think we need to
11:42 - exit just attack trick okay so we're
11:44 - gonna move forward twice
11:46 - move forward or uh right twice
11:51 - twice and then we attack so we're just
11:53 - gonna copy and paste brack right here
11:56 - like so and then change we're going to
11:58 - change this to drag
11:59 - i'm not sure if it's case sensitive but
12:01 - just might might as well just type it in
12:03 - correctly
12:04 - all right let's see and move right twice
12:07 - oh okay not even twice that we're losing
12:10 - our health that's not good i don't want
12:11 - i don't want this guy to get hurt so
12:13 - move only once let's see
12:16 - attack
12:17 - bam bam easy okay so that's it uh i'm
12:21 - not sure if our hero has anything to do
12:24 - with this if your heroes like um attack
12:26 - is like not as like
12:29 - good as some heroes i'm not sure if that
12:31 - will affect your code in some way but i
12:33 - don't think so i think it's just there
12:35 - for fun um
12:38 - sell commentary
12:40 - all right trapped in the prison cell
12:41 - with the famous wizard say the password
12:43 - to get the wizard's help
12:45 - and there you go you run into the ad
12:48 - okay well we're not gonna go this way
