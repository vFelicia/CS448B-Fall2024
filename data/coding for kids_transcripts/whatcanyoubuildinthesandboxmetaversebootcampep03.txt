00:01 - okay not in here oh no no no i don't
00:03 - need to go there run okay i'm almost at
00:06 - the end also
00:07 - uh have you ever wondered what you can
00:09 - build in the sandbox today i will be
00:12 - answering that question in metaverse
00:14 - bootcamp ep3 make sure to subscribe to
00:16 - stay updated on videos like these
00:19 - anyways let's get started so what can
00:21 - you make in the sandbox so before the
00:23 - video goes on i just want to say that we
00:25 - have a piece of land at 19199
00:28 - come visit us there and let's get back
00:30 - to the video
00:31 - well let's see
00:33 - so today's topic is about what can you
00:36 - make and how to make a basic mini game
00:38 - there's two parts so what can you make
00:40 - has a subcategory that includes action
00:43 - adventure games puzzle games nft
00:45 - galleries social hubs and your home and
00:48 - how to make a basic mini game part two
00:50 - is defeat all enemies quest it's all
00:53 - quest by the way to defeat all enemies
00:55 - collect items and limited time quests
00:58 - let's look at all these topics let's
01:00 - begin with what can you make so you can
01:02 - make adventure games like this where you
01:05 - can fight enemies you can have swords
01:09 - avatars
01:10 - jump platformer etc and it's just a fun
01:13 - action game for people who enjoy them
01:16 - and i got these images from
01:18 - sandboxgame.getbook.io so make sure to
01:20 - check them out
01:22 - the next type of game is a puzzle game
01:24 - the puzzle game is uses your brain a
01:26 - little and is mostly around platform and
01:30 - lava traps etc they are pretty cool and
01:33 - i would recommend to try them out it is
01:35 - one of my most favorite types of games
01:37 - and yeah so that is the puzzle games
01:40 - let's move on to the nft galleries if
01:42 - you like to do art or you create nfts uh
01:46 - you can own land and you can build an
01:48 - nft collection or a gallery that you can
01:51 - display in your land and other people
01:52 - can come visit them and even buy them so
01:55 - you can make them interactive and
01:56 - however you would like it
01:59 - now let's look at social club or your
02:01 - house now this is around multiplayer
02:04 - which means there's going to be other
02:05 - people in there with you so you can have
02:07 - this as your social club where people uh
02:09 - your friends other people can hang out
02:11 - together and you can also make this your
02:13 - house where you and your family members
02:16 - can reside in it
02:17 - and yeah that is some things you can
02:19 - build with your land in the sandbox
02:23 - now let's look at our quests or our mini
02:25 - games so our minigame one is defeat all
02:28 - the enemies quest so we have five
02:30 - enemies you can see right here one two
02:32 - three four five i couldn't really fit
02:34 - them on the screen but yeah you can get
02:36 - the idea kill five enemies and here is
02:39 - the quest uh the most important stuff
02:42 - that we're going to use the counter the
02:44 - quest type is a counter the counter type
02:46 - is death chicken is the tag and amount
02:49 - is five we will look in detail uh later
02:52 - but let's just look at what we're gonna
02:54 - make first so that's we're gonna make
02:56 - let's get into it so let's open up our
02:58 - sandbox game maker let me exit this
03:00 - really quickly
03:02 - okay so now once you have opened it it
03:04 - should come up a page like this uh if
03:06 - you create any games then it should
03:08 - appear over here but we are going to be
03:10 - creating a new one click create new
03:12 - let's name it
03:14 - minigame
03:15 - one or whatever you want to name it
03:18 - uh coding
03:20 - for
03:21 - kids okay now we can select four by four
03:24 - or one by one or two by two whatever i'm
03:26 - gonna do one by one since it is a lot of
03:28 - room i'm gonna say
03:30 - one little land is not little at all
03:33 - it's so big you can do anything on a one
03:35 - by one
03:37 - well mostly anything and let's move on
03:40 - and we click that and let's click create
03:42 - and let me clear out my hot bar really
03:45 - quickly so we can start off from the
03:47 - same page
03:48 - okay there so once we have entered our
03:52 - experience let's create five enemies
03:55 - first so the way to create five enemies
03:58 - enemies um is to go and click l for
04:01 - library click entity and here is all the
04:04 - entities you can use uh i will be using
04:07 - one of the scarier ones so
04:09 - like uh
04:10 - [Music]
04:12 - detector bot or no defector bot sorry
04:15 - defector bots so i'll be using the
04:17 - defector bots so
04:20 - i'll grab them and we let's put uh one
04:22 - of them in first uh if we want we could
04:25 - put in our hot bar but i am not doing
04:27 - that since i can just copy them
04:29 - okay once we have this let us select it
04:32 - and we can rename it to chicken or
04:34 - whatever we would like
04:36 - chicken
04:37 - bot
04:39 - and um oh i got the wrong one but it's
04:42 - okay uh once we named it we can set it
04:44 - as invisible or visible
04:46 - i'm going to set it as visible for now
04:48 - we will need to set one of them
04:50 - invisible as our
04:52 - uh
04:53 - how to call it ours
04:54 - are conditioned you can say um like a
04:58 - code
04:59 - uh where it intercepts all of the
05:01 - broadcast and since we can't really have
05:04 - them with any other one or else you know
05:07 - because we have to kill them so they
05:09 - won't exist anymore so we're gonna have
05:10 - to create an invisible one put it at the
05:13 - uh the corners of the map and then make
05:15 - them non-collision and it's just a robot
05:18 - that or entity that we use to
05:21 - intercept our code
05:23 - anyways let's get back to this uh we're
05:25 - gonna
05:26 - turn on collision
05:27 - uh i don't really recommend collision
05:29 - plus gravity because whenever you hit it
05:31 - you have to go chasing it for it like a
05:33 - mile away so just turn on collision
05:36 - and after that we can scroll down a bit
05:38 - more behavior make sure it's melee enemy
05:40 - and you can adjust this uh
05:42 - to your liking but i will have it as the
05:44 - max since it is actually already pretty
05:46 - weak at the max um the health let's turn
05:49 - it on or else it'll be invincible once
05:52 - we turned on health uh let's
05:54 - turn
05:55 - uh let's add a tag so this tag will
05:58 - basically
05:59 - uh set inside of our quest what
06:02 - to know
06:03 - like if this tag
06:05 - so pretend you kill an entity and it has
06:07 - a tag um if the tag is the same one in
06:11 - the quest then it will say that okay it
06:13 - counts one dead okay so let's enter a
06:16 - tag that makes sense i will enter this
06:18 - bot
06:19 - actually chicken bot
06:22 - chicken
06:25 - bot like this click enter and there we
06:27 - go it added the tag inside and after
06:30 - this we can just duplicate it five times
06:33 - so click on it ctrl d and let's click on
06:35 - this tool so we can move it around d
06:38 - ctrl d
06:39 - ctrl d
06:41 - ctrl d okay you can actually do how much
06:43 - amount but you would have to oops you
06:46 - would have to adjust it by yourself
06:48 - inside of the quest
06:49 - itself so i'll just leave it as five for
06:52 - now
06:54 - okay so like it forms a little circle
06:56 - around us and if we were trying to play
06:58 - it right now it would just
06:59 - attack us and if we were to kill all of
07:02 - them it wouldn't really do much
07:05 - so let me try
07:08 - there we go that's two down okay
07:13 - oh that's
07:15 - okay
07:16 - there you go so once we kill all of them
07:18 - it doesn't really do much instead it
07:19 - just
07:20 - it doesn't it's just running it's
07:22 - running around now it's not really
07:25 - doing anything so now let's change that
07:28 - so let's go into rules um and let's
07:31 - click enable and quest
07:33 - click enable let's click add quest right
07:36 - here
07:37 - and we can rename this quest to whatever
07:39 - we want i will say
07:41 - chicken hunt
07:43 - like this and let's tell the player what
07:45 - they have to do to complete this quest
07:48 - kill
07:49 - all the
07:50 - evil
07:52 - chicken
07:54 - robots
07:56 - like this and now we can do unlock quest
07:59 - so
08:00 - uh this auto unlocks i will leave it at
08:02 - that so it like automatically unlocks it
08:05 - right at the beginning of the game
08:07 - uh we can ignore the launch quest too
08:10 - it's auto launch too we can check on
08:12 - quest type though quest type is the
08:15 - counter which will basically count how
08:17 - much times an asset has died or been
08:19 - collected
08:20 - the counter type is either collected
08:22 - objects or deaths i will change it to
08:24 - deaths and then the tag that we want is
08:28 - of course the tag that we set
08:30 - chicken bot is the tag i set um the
08:32 - amount is five so this is how much depth
08:34 - they're going to be
08:35 - uh auto completion yes send message
08:39 - after the
08:40 - quest is completed it will send a
08:42 - message i will send it as
08:47 - chicken wipeout so just press on this
08:50 - thing and then just type in chicken
08:53 - i'll just do chicken wipe okay
08:55 - uh oops i forgot to click add click add
08:58 - right here and now it should you should
09:00 - be all set now let's click add oh i'm
09:03 - sorry not add quest now i can just click
09:05 - out
09:06 - but delete that
09:08 - let's delete that okay there we go let's
09:11 - exit and if we were to play this it
09:14 - wouldn't do anything either um however
09:16 - there would be a change it will go
09:18 - chicken hunt and it will return on our
09:21 - right side of the screen as an hud now
09:24 - let's see if i were to kill
09:26 - some of them
09:27 - it would count like this but if i were
09:29 - to kill the last guy it wouldn't
09:31 - actually make us win instead of just say
09:33 - quest complete this is because there's
09:35 - nothing actually checking or receiving
09:38 - the message um that they sent which is
09:40 - chicken wipeout so we're gonna send
09:42 - we're gonna copy one of these guys
09:46 - and we're gonna put them at the corner
09:47 - of the map
09:49 - so it doesn't oh at the corner of the
09:52 - map so it doesn't get in the way of
09:54 - things
09:55 - oh and we're gonna set it as invisible
09:56 - and we're going to rename it uh
09:59 - let's delete all the tags so it doesn't
10:02 - get confused oh no i clicked on edit
10:05 - logic but it's okay let me delete all
10:08 - the tags
10:09 - there we go
10:10 - let's remove melee enemy and turn it to
10:13 - none
10:14 - then let's remove health too
10:16 - and once it's completely bare and
10:19 - stripped of everything um what we want
10:21 - to do is we want to rename it first
10:23 - let's rename it to
10:24 - uh
10:25 - interceptor interceptor
10:30 - and let's turn off collision so no
10:32 - collision
10:33 - and what we want to do next is we want
10:35 - to add a comparator or not component and
10:38 - let's add in victory so we're going to
10:40 - do on receive message uh and we're going
10:42 - to select this to
10:45 - chicken wipe so now when the chicken
10:47 - wipe has been
10:48 - broadcasted this
10:50 - bot right here will receive it and will
10:52 - make it like make us win so let's try it
10:55 - again
10:56 - okay so our bot is either in that corner
10:58 - that one that one or that one but
11:01 - anyways let's try out our
11:04 - uh rule that we set
11:06 - there we go
11:07 - and there we go
11:09 - there you go now we can win actually and
11:12 - the quest is completed we won one out of
11:14 - one quest complete and it even has a
11:16 - timer and how much kills we got so
11:18 - victory uh and that is how to create our
11:21 - first mini game which is just kill five
11:23 - entities and win
11:25 - so now let's look at the second one
11:28 - i should probably save this remember to
11:30 - save from time to time
11:32 - okay
11:34 - it's almost done
11:35 - and once it says stage that is okay
11:37 - click ok let's move out okay now let's
11:40 - look at our slides again
11:43 - okay so now our second mini game is to
11:45 - collect all items quest this will
11:47 - basically let us collect these little
11:49 - gold coins over here or ancient
11:51 - treasures and it will once we collected
11:53 - them um if we collected all five of them
11:56 - then we will uh
11:58 - basically win the game so here is the
12:00 - quest uh stuff so the quest type is the
12:03 - counter counter type is collected object
12:06 - the tag is gold and amount is five so
12:09 - let's get creating
12:12 - okay let's press click create new and
12:14 - let's name this mini game
12:17 - two coding
12:20 - for
12:22 - kids like this click let's click create
12:25 - new
12:26 - and now it should create a one by one
12:29 - plane area actually you know what let's
12:31 - actually get out first i actually want a
12:34 - desert area so it can have more terrain
12:37 - so we can hide some of the gold
12:39 - and make it more interesting mini game
12:41 - two
12:42 - coding
12:43 - for kids
12:45 - okay sorry if i'm not typing as well the
12:47 - jackets graphs are kind of getting in
12:49 - the way on my keyboard and i can't
12:51 - really type like this but let's just uh
12:54 - go with it so once we created that let's
12:56 - select the theme
12:58 - uh i'll select lake actually and let's
13:01 - click create
13:03 - okay once we did this there we go now we
13:05 - have a lake in the middle um we can hide
13:07 - some gold anywhere on this map basically
13:10 - i'll hide some in the lake too
13:11 - uh so let's get some gold
13:14 - here ancient treasure right here
13:16 - drag it into our hot bar
13:18 - um and let's just click l so why is the
13:21 - world spawn there okay let's drag the
13:24 - world spawn out click on the world spawn
13:26 - and let's move it to a better place
13:30 - i do because i do not want to spawn
13:33 - in the lake it's just not a good place
13:35 - to spawn okay there now the spawn is on
13:38 - the land and let me move that down a bit
13:41 - okay there so once the spawn is on the
13:43 - land let's hide some gold around the map
13:45 - uh you can hide how much you want i will
13:46 - hide only
13:48 - uh only how much
13:51 - five yeah
13:52 - okay i don't know why i can't place it
13:55 - inside of there but it's okay i'll just
13:57 - place on top of the water then i will
13:59 - drag it down from there
14:02 - okay and it's not level yet
14:07 - there okay once it's down there we can
14:08 - hide more around the map
14:10 - um
14:12 - i'll put one there
14:14 - one over there
14:16 - one there and our last one i will also
14:20 - put in the river
14:21 - or not the river sorry lake and let's
14:24 - scroll in a bit
14:26 - let's bring it down
14:28 - oh i need i need to move it over here
14:30 - and push it down like this
14:34 - there we go okay now once we did that
14:36 - uh oh i forgot something it's okay
14:38 - though we can just click on this tool
14:40 - and we can select all of them oh like
14:45 - this
14:47 - okay once we selected all of them what
14:49 - we want to do is we want to click on
14:50 - behavior over here
14:52 - wait never mind click on add components
14:55 - add collectible which means when you hit
14:58 - it it will basically just collect it and
15:00 - let's name this to gold
15:02 - okay and let's add a tag that says gold
15:07 - okay once we added a tag that says gold
15:09 - uh we can just actually test it out
15:11 - first what we can do is we can just run
15:13 - around collect the gold you can see that
15:16 - it goes into our inventory if i were to
15:18 - check on quest items you however you
15:20 - can't really use it for anything so it's
15:23 - just there so yeah we can just run
15:25 - around collect it um
15:28 - but it doesn't really do much
15:30 - you just can collect it let me go get
15:32 - that last piece
15:34 - okay oops
15:36 - there you go
15:38 - they should add drowning in the game it
15:40 - would be much more fun
15:42 - cannot get out the lake oh i can't get
15:44 - out the lake okay let's create a exit
15:46 - wait for the lake a little
15:49 - all right so i couldn't get out of the
15:50 - lake because
15:52 - uh there's you can only jump one by one
15:55 - blocks in the lake um
15:57 - and this is a kind of a problem i i
15:59 - think you should be able to float up
16:00 - into the water surface
16:02 - inside of the lake since it's more
16:05 - more make i mean it makes more sense
16:07 - that you can float inside of a
16:10 - form of water because you can swim
16:13 - i can't place stuff in the water
16:16 - why can't oh well um well we can just
16:19 - delete some blocks here
16:21 - and we can exit from there
16:23 - okay there we go so now we should have
16:26 - an exit way over there
16:28 - um so if we will swim here
16:31 - and we can walk up here
16:33 - and then we can exit here okay perfect
16:35 - so once we did that let's just create
16:37 - our rules or our quest uh click on rules
16:40 - enable quest add quest and let's do
16:43 - collect
16:44 - gold
16:45 - okay
16:47 - actually i'll make it more catchy gold
16:48 - rush okay there we go
16:51 - and our quest description will be
16:54 - find all the hidden
16:57 - gold
16:58 - find all the hidden gold okay and then
17:00 - we're going to just do auto unlock auto
17:02 - launch
17:03 - and our quest type will be counter
17:05 - collected objects and our tag will be
17:08 - gold
17:09 - once we did that we will do auto
17:11 - completion send message after that we
17:12 - will send
17:14 - uh let's send
17:18 - okay you can add it if you don't have it
17:20 - but i'll just add collected
17:22 - and once we send collected oh shoot i
17:24 - accidentally closed it
17:26 - okay once we send collected it will
17:29 - um basically report it to entire map and
17:32 - now let's have another uh
17:35 - another entity that will
17:38 - uh receive it let's have a beaver this
17:40 - time so we'll put it over here
17:42 - that's our beaver
17:44 - oh did not place
17:46 - oh why is it not placing there we go so
17:49 - now let's highlight our beaver let's
17:51 - make it invisible
17:52 - we don't need to rename it actually
17:54 - let's uh remove health let's change prey
17:56 - to none add a component a victory on
18:00 - receive message uh
18:03 - boss not boss dead um collected like
18:06 - this and now we can win actually so tab
18:10 - for playing and gold rush there we go
18:13 - and it should be oh no i fell to the
18:15 - lake
18:16 - no
18:17 - okay well
18:19 - um
18:20 - it should yeah you can see it's on the
18:22 - right of our screen and now let's try
18:26 - uh getting all the gold okay so got the
18:28 - gold
18:30 - and oh i'm underwater okay got that gold
18:32 - and let's exit on our little path we
18:34 - made over here
18:36 - okay there we go
18:38 - and now let's collect the rest of the
18:40 - gold on the map so gold number three
18:43 - there are five pieces of gold we need to
18:45 - find
18:46 - gold number four and of course you can
18:48 - hide them better uh i didn't hide mine
18:51 - so good because
18:53 - i would have trouble finding them myself
18:55 - um but yeah
18:56 - and goal number five there you go
18:58 - victory so that is how to create mini
19:00 - game number two which is to collect gold
19:03 - or easter egg hunt and let's move on to
19:05 - our last one which is in my opinion the
19:07 - most fun
19:09 - okay let's move on so now mini game
19:11 - number three will be limited time quest
19:13 - it's like a maze we can make this made
19:15 - by yourself um of course you don't need
19:18 - to be perfect i am not an experienced uh
19:22 - maze maker uh if you might call it like
19:24 - that but i think i do understand the
19:26 - concept of a maze um and what i did i
19:29 - just pulled up an image of a maze and
19:31 - put it on my second display and i just
19:33 - looked from there and copied down the
19:35 - maze so it would actually you know be a
19:37 - legit maze not just me scribbling some
19:39 - things down but yeah our mini game three
19:42 - is limited time quest and we our quest
19:44 - type is timer seconds to wait is 20 and
19:47 - goal is to survive um obviously the goal
19:50 - over here is you can change it to
19:52 - you actually you can't change it to
19:53 - anything just put out survive because
19:56 - there's actually none for victory so
19:58 - survive is the best since we don't have
20:00 - any mobs here either
20:02 - okay so let's move on to our sandbox
20:04 - let's click edit mode and let's no no i
20:06 - want to save it first
20:09 - okay let's save
20:12 - there we go and let's click out okay
20:15 - let's create new now
20:17 - okay this video has been going on for 20
20:19 - minutes so
20:20 - i hopefully you stuck with me uh once
20:22 - you click new let's name this minigame
20:26 - three
20:27 - uh coding for kids coding for kids like
20:31 - this theme let's put it as empty for now
20:33 - let's have a one by one let's click
20:35 - create
20:36 - and now i will uh
20:39 - let's use a block that is dignified for
20:41 - a maze um
20:43 - let's see
20:46 - sorry for that
20:49 - uh let's use brown bricks i'm pretty
20:51 - sure that is the most amazed like thing
20:53 - unless there's like
20:55 - tree leaves maybe um like a bush
20:58 - uh a bush maze
21:01 - none okay it's okay
21:03 - um we can just use brown bricks of
21:05 - course but you can use any other blocks
21:08 - you want uh i'll just be using that one
21:10 - actually i'll use the stone bricks i
21:12 - think that looks actually better okay
21:14 - let's close our library
21:17 - and let's have a top-down view the way
21:19 - to change your view is to
21:21 - uh press alt and then just click
21:24 - left or hold left click and you can move
21:26 - around let's move it so it's top-down
21:28 - view oh
21:29 - so it's a top down view like so
21:32 - um and now let's just critter me it
21:34 - doesn't matter where spawn point is we
21:35 - can move it later so i will just bring
21:38 - up an image of a maze right here
21:41 - maze
21:43 - okay and we will click on images
21:46 - uh we don't need to get these
21:47 - complicated ones we only need like a
21:49 - simple but not too simple one like this
21:53 - one maybe
21:54 - we can put it into our tab right here or
21:57 - we can just click save image i'll just
21:59 - click save image save image
22:02 - oh it saves as a web thingy uh it's okay
22:05 - we can just find a new one
22:07 - save image i might just put it on the
22:09 - other link
22:11 - there and then just scroll scroll sorry
22:14 - scrolling a bit and there we go now we
22:16 - can put it on our second screen but for
22:18 - the sake of the video i'll just put it
22:20 - like a tiny
22:22 - uh spot on this screen
22:24 - oh no because it'll disappear anyways so
22:27 - i'll just put on my second monitor i
22:28 - hope that's fine but basically i will
22:30 - put a time lapse on this and
22:32 - uh just create a maze so let's get
22:35 - started
22:37 - [Laughter]
23:02 - do
23:09 - okay now i'm done with the time lapse um
23:13 - and here is my finished result on the
23:15 - maze i think it looks pretty good um and
23:18 - this is just the outline of it so it's
23:20 - actually just a one by one
23:22 - uh just a one height
23:24 - uh how do you call it maze let me fill
23:26 - in those little cracks
23:29 - oh
23:30 - like so
23:32 - so it's just one by one um and let's
23:34 - make it a three by three so just overlay
23:36 - it three times uh don't go like this
23:39 - this will just ruin your whole maze okay
23:41 - instead just go uh just
23:44 - line this row up
23:46 - then line this one like so and let's
23:48 - start up the time lapse again
24:18 - okay now i am done with my maze um i
24:21 - made it all three by three and let's
24:24 - move the spawn point now so let's move
24:26 - this to over here
24:28 - okay once we did this we can actually
24:30 - just play it so tab and we can run
24:33 - through it a little
24:35 - like this um and of course i don't know
24:38 - the maze either so i am getting stuck on
24:40 - a lot of parts but i will not ruin the
24:42 - surprise for myself yet and i will just
24:44 - um let it sit like this first but what
24:48 - we need to do next is we want to go to
24:49 - global parameters go to camera and
24:51 - change it to top down this makes it top
24:54 - down view like so and we can have a
24:56 - easier understanding of what the maze is
24:59 - and we can go into
25:00 - places that we usually won't see
25:04 - like this and you can see that i
25:05 - completed it much much easier
25:07 - because it's uh top down and i would
25:10 - recommend top down too
25:12 - but um
25:15 - there i have multiple ways
25:18 - okay so now we basically are kind of
25:22 - uh we are kind of
25:24 - i call it
25:26 - not we're not done but
25:29 - oops that's the wrong block
25:32 - okay now we just need to set up our
25:36 - um
25:38 - our
25:40 - rules so let's go to rule and let's
25:42 - enable quest add quest let's name this
25:45 - time
25:46 - timer and let's say complete
25:49 - the maze
25:51 - like this you can do auto unlock um auto
25:55 - launch quest type is counter
25:58 - um
25:59 - and we're gonna change this to timer
26:02 - seconds to wait i will change this to 20
26:04 - seconds and let's
26:06 - leave gold to survive click out and now
26:09 - we will add two
26:11 - two
26:12 - uh
26:13 - animals or
26:15 - entities we're going to put one right at
26:17 - the end of the maze another one
26:19 - somewhere else and we will let's move on
26:22 - to the interceptor first so this is the
26:24 - interceptor let's make invisible
26:26 - collision no collision
26:28 - um
26:29 - let's change behavior from prey to none
26:32 - and let's disable health add component
26:35 - that says victory oh and not victory
26:38 - game over because this one if you run
26:40 - out of time then it's game over
26:42 - uh wait let's go back into rules let's
26:44 - see what our oh message let's change
26:46 - message to
26:48 - fail okay let's change message to fail
26:51 - and once this beaver over here gets the
26:54 - message fail
26:57 - then it will go defeat but however if
26:59 - the other beaver over here that changes
27:02 - to
27:03 - uh none then let's leave health to none
27:06 - let's make this invisible too
27:08 - uh let's add a component that's a
27:09 - victory
27:10 - so on
27:12 - collision meaning if it hits this beaver
27:14 - right here then it will basically win we
27:18 - have to make it collision though we have
27:19 - to enable collision or else it's not
27:21 - going to work so once we did this we
27:22 - will just be able to play it now and it
27:24 - should work so let's do tab
27:26 - and it says timer
27:28 - and then it will have a timer at the end
27:31 - complete the maze quick quick uh this
27:33 - way
27:34 - you can sprint in this too oh i don't
27:36 - think is it no it's not this way no no
27:39 - no no run no no no no
27:41 - it's this way it's this way i remember i
27:42 - remember
27:43 - this way shortcut shortcut shortcut like
27:45 - this and there we go now we hit the
27:47 - beaver and we want so we can just um
27:50 - edit this i think that
27:52 - uh
27:54 - our camera having a top down is a bit
27:56 - too easy so i will change it to
27:59 - first person no first person makes me
28:02 - dizzy i'll just change the third person
28:04 - so now they can just have it like this
28:06 - which is a lot better
28:08 - uh for some times like so because you
28:11 - can't really see much with their with
28:13 - third person so it makes the mage maze
28:16 - more challenging
28:18 - okay not in here oh no no no i don't
28:20 - mean to go in there run okay i'm almost
28:23 - at the end also the end okay
28:25 - and i made it there two seconds to spare
28:27 - there so as you can see we can make it
28:30 - like this it's pretty fun although it
28:32 - takes some time but yeah that's it for
28:35 - today's video i hope you enjoyed and i
28:37 - hope it answered your question on what
28:39 - can you build with the sandbox and here
28:42 - is the answer you can build anything
28:44 - like this also if you're not subscribed
28:46 - make sure to subscribe to stay tuned for
28:48 - videos like these i spend a lot of time
28:50 - making these videos so yeah if you could
