00:00 - [Music]
00:12 - hello my name is jeremy and today i'm
00:14 - going to be showing you
00:15 - how to make lists in python right now
00:17 - we're in python module
00:19 - so why don't we get started first of all
00:21 - what is a list
00:22 - a list is basically an array it's
00:26 - like a variable but instead of storing
00:28 - only one number
00:29 - or um or string this can store
00:33 - many strings which is multiple of them
00:36 - and
00:36 - i think it's going to be very useful so
00:38 - i'm going to teach you how to do it
00:40 - first of all let's see what's a list in
00:42 - real life a closet right
00:44 - it holds books um like if you're like me
00:47 - and put books in it
00:48 - um shoes clothes and jackets
00:51 - so why don't we set a closet as a list
00:54 - so first of all to make a list you need
00:56 - to do closet um or whatever you want as
00:59 - a list
00:59 - equals to and then put a bracket
01:03 - which is right below the
01:06 - plus sign and then we do what is
01:10 - in the closet so there is clothes as you
01:12 - said
01:14 - clothes um remember to put the single
01:17 - quotes
01:17 - slash quotation marks clothes
01:21 - uh books
01:27 - um jackets
01:31 - and finally shoes
01:35 - okay and you have to keep oh sorry
01:38 - and you also need to keep in mind that
01:41 - jackets
01:42 - i mean um this list
01:45 - is counting from zero so close is zero
01:48 - number zero number one number two number
01:50 - three so if you want
01:51 - choose which number is it three right
01:55 - yes because it counts from zero so don't
01:57 - get confused with that because
01:58 - we are going to have to pull specific
02:00 - ones later on so yeah
02:02 - keep in mind that it starts from zero so
02:04 - moving on
02:05 - is to add something to the list
02:08 - so what we say is to append it
02:11 - and so this is how to do it so we put
02:15 - the list name in dot append
02:18 - this is how you call a pen and then you
02:20 - put in what you want to append
02:22 - so like i want to append oops
02:25 - yeah i want to append uh sneakers then
02:29 - because i just bought them like this
02:32 - enter and then print print closet
02:36 - which is to print the whole list print
02:39 - and then you got to do these
02:42 - flaws here we go so print closet and
02:45 - let's see what it does
02:48 - um well we have to run it i forgot
02:52 - run module
02:56 - and it says oh you see
03:00 - uh where should i save it i'm just
03:02 - saving my desktop then
03:05 - okay and save
03:11 - downloads okay save
03:14 - okay so right now i'm actually
03:18 - in the wrong thing we're not doing
03:20 - python module
03:21 - but we're actually going to do python
03:23 - shell which is different
03:24 - so search up id leu with me sorry for
03:27 - that guys
03:28 - so this is kind of similar but instead
03:32 - of that okay just paste it okay just
03:34 - paste it
03:36 - and then sorry and then
03:39 - um after this uh like this right guys
03:44 - then what we do is we just do something
03:46 - like this click enter
03:48 - and then we just type in
03:51 - sorry type copy this
03:55 - okay put it in here
03:59 - copy this and then click enter
04:03 - and put it back in so as you can see
04:05 - it's added in sneakers
04:07 - and um so there's clothes book jackets
04:10 - choosing sneakers
04:12 - and here we are so we have at first it
04:15 - was closed book jackets and shoes but
04:17 - now we added sneakers in
04:18 - what if the um the person with the
04:21 - closet so pretend me
04:22 - i i'm about to go to school so i take my
04:25 - books out
04:26 - and uh what will happen to the list the
04:29 - book is going to be gone right
04:31 - so to make something get removed is
04:34 - pretty simple it's kind of like a pen
04:36 - closet dot remove
04:40 - and then what do we want um which one do
04:43 - we want to remove
04:44 - so we put a bracket we put a bracket
04:48 - and then we put um closet
04:51 - wait bracket right yeah bracket and then
04:54 - after that we put
04:55 - claws uh oh oopsies over here it needs
04:58 - to be a parenthesis
04:59 - not this bracket okay so we put
05:02 - closet and uh now a bracket
05:06 - and we put what number we want out okay
05:09 - so
05:10 - books is number one so you put it in
05:13 - like that
05:13 - and click enter now you print it print
05:17 - closet like so
05:20 - enter see and books is gone so i took
05:22 - the books out
05:24 - went to school and it came back so
05:27 - um i want to put my books back in my
05:29 - closet so how do i put it back
05:31 - a pen append is um putting it back
05:36 - but uh it's putting it
05:40 - it's also there's another one and this
05:43 - one
05:43 - is to put a specific position a pen is
05:46 - just putting in
05:47 - like right here the end as you can see
05:50 - sneakers
05:51 - but this one that i'm going to do it's
05:52 - going to put in the position
05:54 - like an accurate one so i'm going to
05:57 - show you what it is
05:58 - it's called insert um it's like the
06:00 - other ones
06:01 - the code is similar closet dot insert
06:05 - and then like what do we want to insert
06:07 - we want to insert
06:09 - uh our books back right so we're going
06:11 - to say
06:12 - um parentheses and then where do we want
06:16 - it
06:16 - so this is what this is zero one
06:21 - two and three right so i'm going to put
06:24 - it back in the same position
06:26 - which is number one so one comma
06:30 - little bun bun one comma space and then
06:34 - we're going to put
06:35 - uh what we want in so we want the books
06:38 - back in right
06:39 - books and then we put the parentheses in
06:42 - so now we're going to print it
06:45 - print closet
06:49 - oh closet right yeah closet and then
06:52 - click enter
06:53 - and there we go boxes back into the
06:55 - closet
06:57 - nice and back it's home okay now we're
06:59 - going to
07:00 - show another thing for remove so pretend
07:03 - um my shoes are getting old okay and i
07:06 - want to
07:07 - just like get rid of it well how do i do
07:10 - that you can
07:10 - you remove but there's another easier um
07:14 - another alternative way which is called
07:17 - um deleting
07:18 - so uh first of all what we do is we do
07:21 - dell stands for delete and then
07:25 - what we do is we go and we label which
07:28 - one we want
07:29 - so uh closet
07:32 - closet don't put you don't need to put
07:35 - parentheses around this
07:36 - and we put a bracket and say choose
07:39 - right they're getting old so
07:41 - choose is number three and three
07:44 - like this boom and then we print
07:48 - closet let's see if shoes is gone
07:52 - and tada shoes is gone so instead of
07:55 - shoes i have the sneakers now
07:56 - because the shoes are old now they're
07:58 - gone okay so
07:59 - it's now what if i want like i have two
08:03 - money in my list
08:04 - like too many in my list so i want to
08:07 - find
08:07 - the specific one i want to print it out
08:10 - so what i do
08:11 - is i um i go like this
08:15 - print and then uh
08:19 - garage so we're gonna um
08:23 - print a specific one so what if i want
08:26 - my jackets and you couldn't find it from
08:27 - my clothes
08:28 - right so jackets is number two so like
08:31 - this
08:32 - and there you go we printed the jacket
08:35 - oh no whoopsies now um you don't have to
08:39 - put in the uh how do you call it you
08:42 - don't need to put
08:43 - in uh the
08:46 - uh you need to put like
08:49 - the negative sign in front of it first
08:50 - so
08:52 - well this is a way i uh think you need
08:55 - to do it so garage right
08:57 - and then like this but instead of doing
09:01 - that we're going to do negative
09:02 - so now it's going to be a little bit
09:04 - more complicated this way works for me
09:06 - but for some reason i this way doesn't
09:08 - work hmm
09:09 - that's kind of weird oh what a prank
09:11 - garage
09:13 - i think a closet is a garage oh my
09:16 - goodness
09:17 - jimmy what in the world okay so um
09:20 - closet sorry guys they bring um
09:22 - [Music]
09:24 - closet two and this should work i'm like
09:28 - why doesn't it work there we go jackets
09:31 - and then
09:32 - he realized um
09:36 - so yeah don't forget to print the
09:38 - correct
09:39 - one my brain just stopped working for
09:42 - some reason and just print garage
09:44 - so yeah remember to print the exact name
09:47 - of your list it's very case sensitive
09:50 - and you can't even mix up a
09:51 - capitalization
09:53 - okay so that's one way of doing it i
09:55 - just spoiled you the second way oh why
09:57 - so another way is to print um
10:00 - it's an alternative i don't know why
10:02 - anybody would want to use this way
10:04 - but um it's another way i guess
10:07 - so instead of counting 0 1
10:10 - 2 3 we're going to count backwards so
10:13 - this is going to be
10:14 - starting from y not 0 1 two
10:18 - three four more specifically negative
10:21 - one negative two negative three negative
10:22 - four
10:23 - okay so now we're going to print it
10:25 - using that method
10:27 - print closet
10:30 - closet and um
10:34 - negative which one so we want jackets
10:36 - again so it needs to be negative
10:38 - two like so
10:42 - um whoops one and like that
10:46 - and now it's going to be jacket see so
10:48 - you could count backwards or forwards it
10:50 - just depends
10:51 - okay so after this um what else are we
10:54 - going to do with lists
10:56 - what other commands is there what if you
10:59 - have
11:00 - a specific um a specific
11:04 - clothe that you really like so you could
11:06 - name it
11:07 - something like this so we're going to
11:10 - say
11:10 - um and you're going to like just
11:14 - pop it off so which means dot pop
11:18 - it means just like use it one time and
11:21 - it's gone
11:22 - so what if we're going to set
11:25 - um it as one of my
11:28 - books so we could say harry potter
11:32 - okay that's one of my favorite books
11:34 - harry potter um
11:37 - equals harry potter
11:40 - equals um
11:43 - how about let's just say hp for short
11:45 - because it's pretty long
11:47 - hp equals um
11:51 - closet right wait parentheses i think
11:55 - closet
11:58 - wait no do you need no i don't think you
12:02 - do
12:02 - okay just how let's try this closet dot
12:06 - pop and then we select which one we want
12:08 - so
12:09 - i would want um which one books right
12:13 - yeah so
12:15 - let's just do the fancy way so negative
12:18 - three
12:18 - there we go and then now we click enter
12:22 - and this is going to pop it off which
12:24 - means that it's just going to take it
12:25 - out
12:26 - single use it shows one and then it's
12:29 - like basically deleting and printing at
12:31 - the same time
12:32 - so if we say print
12:36 - print hp
12:40 - i just realized it says hp also stands
12:43 - for health points
12:44 - oh and games you know
12:47 - and click enter it says books but what
12:50 - if we do this
12:52 - again do you think it's going to be
12:55 - books
12:57 - do you no it wouldn't be books
13:00 - i mean sorry yes it would be books
13:02 - because
13:03 - it's going to pop it off but if we
13:06 - however just print um
13:08 - [Music]
13:10 - print uh how do you call it closet right
13:13 - if we would just print closet then
13:17 - this would not have books okay
13:20 - because we popped it off but if we just
13:22 - say print hp
13:24 - then there is going to be books because
13:26 - it's like separated from each other
13:27 - basically
13:28 - and yeah that's um pop
13:32 - okay moving on is to print the
13:36 - what if we would want to change
13:39 - something without having to delete it
13:40 - and append it
13:41 - or um insert it again then what we would
13:44 - do
13:45 - is we would do like the name
13:48 - of the very uh the the list first right
13:51 - guys
13:52 - and then we would um
13:55 - we would do over here
13:59 - and which one do you want to change so
14:01 - how let's change
14:02 - clothes okay so it's zero
14:06 - let's change clothes to
14:10 - hmm sweatshirts
14:14 - sweat wait let me just sweat
14:17 - shirts okay
14:20 - just like so click enter now we print
14:24 - closet let's see
14:27 - and kaboom boo you go sweatshirts
14:30 - i changed clothes to sweatshirts and
14:33 - um yeah that's pretty much everything
