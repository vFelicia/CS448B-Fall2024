00:00 - hi my name is jemmy and today i'm going
00:02 - to be showing you some simple math
00:04 - commands and the functions of inputs
00:06 - so let's get started with the functions
00:09 - of
00:10 - input so functions of
00:13 - input okay so it's pretty
00:17 - um fun to do it because
00:20 - you actually get to interact with the
00:21 - program instead of just watching it just
00:23 - like
00:24 - um display like just
00:27 - type out and print stuff so you could
00:29 - actually like
00:30 - enter stuff in as like the player or the
00:33 - game tester
00:34 - so yeah let me just show you how it
00:36 - works
00:37 - first of all type in input and then
00:40 - these parentheses after that um you can
00:43 - like ask
00:44 - questions to like enter your
00:47 - name here and then colon
00:50 - like that so now it's gonna do is it's
00:53 - gonna
00:54 - ask you enter your name here so you can
00:56 - enter like your name
00:58 - jemmy click enter and the program is
01:00 - done
01:01 - however if you want to use the name to
01:04 - do something else
01:05 - you could set um the input as a variable
01:08 - like this after that it will store the
01:11 - name
01:11 - into the variable called name and it
01:14 - will use it for something else so we
01:15 - could just do print
01:18 - name like this which will make it print
01:21 - the player's name
01:22 - so jeremy
01:25 - wrong place jimmy right here
01:29 - and then it prints out jimmy but it's
01:31 - kind of boring so i'm gonna make it
01:33 - actually um actually like
01:37 - respond as an actual human so
01:40 - like nice to
01:43 - me oops
01:48 - nice to me you
01:52 - jam oops um and then after this right
01:55 - here what we do
01:56 - is we grab the quotation marks but we're
01:58 - still inside the parentheses
02:00 - and what you do is you put
02:03 - plus and then plus what plus the name
02:07 - so once you add the name it's gonna look
02:09 - like real like nice to meet you
02:11 - and then um jimmy doggo whatever let me
02:14 - just delete this right here i
02:16 - accidentally
02:16 - typed it okay there you go um but let me
02:19 - try
02:20 - enter your name here jeremy
02:23 - nice to meet you jimmy also if you want
02:26 - like an
02:26 - um a punctuation at the end you can just
02:30 - put another um addition sign do some
02:33 - friends
02:33 - um quotation marks and put it right in
02:36 - the middle so like nice to meet you
02:38 - gemmy with an um exclamation point i
02:40 - think it's gonna look more
02:42 - exciting oh why is it always keep on
02:45 - printing in here
02:48 - jeremy enter nice to meet you gemmy like
02:50 - that
02:51 - and then it will make it more
02:54 - sophisticated
02:55 - now let's take it one more step further
02:57 - and make them enter their last name too
03:00 - so let's name this variable l name for
03:03 - last name
03:04 - um and enter your last name
03:08 - here and then we leave them a space
03:10 - after this why don't we
03:11 - um work on our program a little so for
03:14 - our last name
03:16 - we need to have their first name space
03:19 - last name
03:20 - and then um exclamation point right so
03:23 - uh let's go back to this step where
03:24 - there's just nice to meet you jimmy
03:26 - uh we click uh um we click addition
03:30 - okay quotation marks and then space it
03:33 - out
03:34 - so it will have a gap between name um
03:37 - your first name and your last name and
03:39 - then addition
03:40 - l name for their last name plus again
03:43 - quotation mark
03:44 - exclamation point so now it's gonna look
03:46 - more
03:47 - um more
03:51 - real uh so enter your name here
03:55 - jammy doggo something like that
03:59 - nice to meet you jimmy doggo as you can
04:00 - see it's more
04:02 - um more like a human right
04:05 - so yeah this is uh the functions of
04:09 - input
04:10 - it's pretty fun um and yeah you could
04:13 - expand on
04:14 - and make a whole story of it like and
04:17 - then you could
04:17 - ask um like this
04:20 - input and then we could make the
04:24 - robot ask how's your day
04:29 - how's your day and then um let them um
04:32 - enter like like pretend
04:37 - respond oh respond
04:41 - right here like that let's just test
04:43 - that out okay
04:45 - jemmy again why does it need to be over
04:49 - there
04:49 - so over here gemmy and then like
04:53 - doggo and nice to meet you jamie doggo
04:56 - how's your day and everything
04:57 - for like great and you can make a whole
05:00 - story
05:00 - of that so that's why it makes it more
05:03 - exciting
05:03 - um because you can enter and like keep
05:06 - on continuing
05:07 - so yeah that's the function of input
05:10 - okay
05:11 - now let's keep on hashtag to make them
05:14 - comment
05:15 - because we're going to expand our
05:17 - knowledge on
05:18 - math commands so let's label our topic
05:22 - math command
05:23 - enter and then um what we're going to do
05:26 - is we're going to
05:27 - set two variables for the each factors
05:30 - so
05:30 - the first factor is going to be named x
05:32 - equals to
05:34 - let's say 10 and then y equals to
05:38 - three okay i'm going to be showing you a
05:40 - couple different math
05:41 - um commands in python
05:44 - which is pretty cool um you could do a
05:47 - bunch of equations with them
05:48 - such as addition so let's just say
05:52 - print um parentheses
05:55 - quotation so the sum and then we put
05:59 - equal sign up here we put space
06:02 - comma space okay and then we do x
06:06 - plus y as we all know sum is um
06:09 - the answer to addition now let's try it
06:13 - for subtraction shall we
06:15 - so enter again print it out
06:18 - sum instead of sum we do
06:21 - what uh yeah it's a difference right
06:24 - yeah
06:25 - difference is for um subtractions
06:28 - change this to x minus y copy this
06:32 - so we have addition subtraction both
06:34 - down now let's
06:36 - um change this one to multiplication
06:39 - so product
06:42 - okay and then x times
06:46 - y like that copy it again
06:51 - enter now for the division which is
06:53 - quotient
06:55 - quotient no that doesn't look right
06:59 - oh there we go um and then
07:02 - x slash y so here we are with the four
07:07 - most simple math command and let me just
07:10 - show you how it works
07:12 - okay so the first one is 13 x
07:15 - yes 10 plus 3 13 difference 10
07:18 - minus 3 equals 7 yes product 10 times 3
07:22 - equals
07:23 - 30 and then dividing 3.3
07:27 - yeah okay and it rounds off nice um
07:30 - but what if we don't want this whole
07:33 - long stubborn
07:34 - decimal point so we could do
07:37 - another way to round down the decimal
07:40 - points
07:40 - um using this method so rounded
07:44 - quotient whoops
07:48 - keep on forgetting okay rounded quotient
07:52 - equals to um
07:55 - oh wait remember your
07:58 - quotation guys don't forget
08:02 - because if you do it won't be good
08:07 - okay something like this
08:10 - nice and then space comma space
08:14 - x double slash y there we go and it'll
08:18 - round
08:18 - off this whole chunk and it'll just be
08:21 - three okay let's see yep there you go
08:26 - three okay nice now next one
08:29 - is what is our next one let's do
08:33 - how about exponents yeah okay let's do
08:36 - exponents
08:37 - so exponents it's simple um all you
08:40 - gotta do
08:41 - do that star shape two times which is
08:44 - for multiplication
08:45 - uh but for multiplication it's only once
08:48 - this one is twice
08:50 - so let's set this as
08:53 - exponents
08:56 - equal to this and let's copy that
09:00 - let me see what other one we do oh yeah
09:03 - remainders so
09:04 - 3 goes into x how much time three times
09:07 - right and
09:08 - um three times three equals nine and
09:11 - then ten minus nine equals one which
09:12 - means that there's
09:13 - one remainder left so if my calculations
09:16 - are correct
09:17 - this last one should be equal to one so
09:20 - let's
09:20 - label it remainders and then
09:24 - let's um for inside here
09:28 - what we're going to do is we're going to
09:30 - do
09:31 - um a percentage sign which makes it uh
09:35 - make a remainder uh so let's just clear
09:38 - this terminal and then let's play it
09:40 - okay there we go so the sum thirteen
09:42 - seven thirty three point three two three
09:44 - three
09:45 - rounded round quotient equals three
09:48 - exponents a thousand yes that makes
09:50 - sense
09:50 - and remainder c goes to one according my
09:52 - calculations it was correct
09:54 - okay so this is um the
09:57 - simple lesson for today i hope you found
10:00 - something helpful
10:01 - from this lesson um it was pretty fun
10:04 - for me
10:04 - to uh like share my knowledge about this
10:08 - so
10:08 - i hope you guys enjoyed it uh leave a
10:11 - like if you did
10:12 - don't remember remember to subscribe i
10:14 - almost said don't remember to subscribe
10:16 - and uh yeah see you next video
10:19 - bye
