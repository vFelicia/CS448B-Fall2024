00:00 - hi guys my name is jimmy and welcome
00:02 - back to python
00:03 - ep8 today i'm going to be talking about
00:06 - ifs so i'm going to show you how to use
00:09 - ifs in python
00:11 - i've been waiting to learn this for a
00:12 - long time because
00:14 - um you get to actually uh
00:17 - like experience like with two conditions
00:21 - so yeah i'm let's get started first of
00:24 - all let's name a project
00:27 - the functions
00:30 - of if okay
00:34 - and um now let's start with an input
00:37 - actually so let's pretend we're going to
00:42 - um make a program that says
00:46 - uh like if are you old enough to
00:50 - use this program so let's try saying
00:53 - like
00:54 - um here we are and
00:58 - input let's just say set
01:02 - age equal to let's set this to
01:05 - in right away because we're going to use
01:07 - it for our if
01:09 - so int then
01:12 - inside another one upside and
01:16 - input now we're going inside
01:19 - and now we're going to say enter
01:24 - enter your age here
01:28 - now with a little little bit of
01:30 - manipulating we can
01:31 - um use it to get the real age
01:34 - uh so right here we're going to do enter
01:38 - your real
01:42 - age here so
01:45 - it's not really manipulative but yeah
01:47 - they'll they'll think
01:49 - that um that it doesn't really matter
01:51 - what the age is
01:52 - so they'll enter the real age and if
01:54 - they're too young then they're going to
01:56 - um not be qualified so
01:59 - yeah uh that's it and once we're done
02:03 - with the input right now
02:04 - we're going to um
02:10 - and now we're going to do if so here's
02:13 - if
02:14 - if we're going to use a little bit of a
02:17 - weird method
02:18 - it's pretty simple hang tight so if age
02:21 - is greater or equal to 10
02:25 - then enter and then colon this one
02:29 - enter and then we say
02:32 - qualify like this
02:36 - and then enter again delete this and
02:38 - we're going to say
02:40 - program and do
02:45 - and i forgot i just will
02:48 - end it there we go program ended and
02:51 - we're going to say like that
02:52 - so wait do you don't need to put um
02:56 - wait let me i think you need to print
03:00 - right
03:01 - or don't you i think you do need a print
03:04 - though okay
03:05 - print okay so here we are
03:11 - program ended missing
03:14 - call print program oh okay
03:19 - i have something like this
03:23 - right yeah or there's still some text
03:26 - there you go
03:27 - and then now we're going to say 10
03:31 - how about let's try yeah tent
03:34 - file that name or qualified is not
03:37 - defined
03:38 - oh and you gotta print it i forgot it
03:41 - print boom
03:49 - so now after that i guess we can do it
03:51 - now
03:52 - okay enter your name page here that
03:55 - qualify and program ended there you go
03:57 - it's pretty simple and let's try
03:59 - something else
04:00 - about eight years old eight
04:04 - enter program ended see there wasn't any
04:06 - qualified
04:07 - so yeah you can use this in multiple
04:10 - ways
04:10 - so let's see um
04:14 - uh let's say coins
04:17 - so pretend you want to like see how much
04:20 - coins they have and if they can like
04:22 - um exchange it for item or something
04:25 - then
04:25 - uh enter your it uses the same concept
04:29 - but you can use it multiple ways so
04:32 - enter
04:33 - the amount of
04:36 - coins here
04:39 - okay um pretend it's in roblox
04:42 - and you need to get the dominus how much
04:44 - is the dominance
04:46 - i'm not sure so let's get uh
04:49 - this much like
04:52 - let's coins the dominus is the most
04:56 - expensive
04:57 - item i'm pretty sure in roblox so yeah
05:00 - let me just
05:02 - 2 000 like 200
05:06 - 200 20 000 okay yeah 20 000
05:09 - coins in order to um exchange it
05:13 - so yeah here and then what you need to
05:15 - do is
05:17 - you run it now actually let's change
05:20 - qualified to
05:22 - exchange okay here
05:26 - enter the amount of coins here so
05:29 - pretend
05:30 - it's what uh and then program ended
05:33 - it doesn't give you it but however if
05:36 - you do
05:37 - twenty thousand and one
05:41 - then it says exchange there we go it's
05:43 - pretty interesting
05:44 - you guys can use it on for like a lot of
05:48 - things
05:48 - actually and um yeah so i hope you
05:51 - enjoyed this video
05:53 - in the next video we're going to be
05:54 - talking about um something else
05:57 - it's similar to this it's called if else
06:00 - and yeah i'm going to see in the next
06:01 - video bye
06:03 - welcome back to coding for kids python
06:05 - ep9 today i'm going to be showing you if
06:08 - else
06:09 - because last video i showed you how to
06:11 - do if
06:12 - it's pretty simple and not now you can
06:15 - actually
06:16 - do um a lot of more things with if else
06:18 - there's also the
06:20 - this command called alif which is
06:22 - combined with
06:23 - um if and else so it's basically
06:25 - combined it
06:26 - and i'm going to show you how to use all
06:28 - those code so first of all let's start
06:30 - up with a variable
06:31 - as we did before age um let's put input
06:34 - first so
06:36 - hashtag functions
06:39 - [Music]
06:41 - of if else okay
06:44 - so now let's put age equals to
06:48 - in um slash
06:52 - input and then here we do uh quotation
06:55 - marks and we say
06:58 - uh enter your
07:02 - age here there we go and then call in
07:05 - here like that
07:06 - enter your age here and in here
07:11 - what we do is we are going to say like
07:14 - if age
07:18 - if age is
07:24 - is less is
07:29 - uh less less than
07:33 - less or equal to 10 then
07:37 - colon what we do is we print
07:41 - um child like this so we're gonna
07:45 - classify them
07:46 - under age so child and
07:50 - now we're gonna do a lift which is
07:51 - between uh
07:53 - if and else so alif
07:56 - age is um
08:01 - greater age is greater
08:07 - no no it's just less
08:11 - then let's say 20
08:14 - less or equal to 20 then what we print
08:18 - is you print
08:20 - teenager let's just test that first
08:25 - t nature there let's just test that
08:31 - okay 16
08:35 - teenager there we go and now if we do
08:37 - [Music]
08:39 - like this and we do four years old child
08:43 - there we go it's pretty simple guys um
08:46 - you can
08:46 - use this and let me just show you the
08:49 - rest until it's grandpa
08:51 - so here and then we do
08:54 - uh is less
08:58 - is less or equal to
09:01 - how much 50 and then we're going to say
09:04 - that this
09:05 - is prime
09:10 - prime years right prime years
09:14 - prime of life yeah prime of life
09:18 - there you go which means that they're in
09:20 - like their top like
09:21 - they can achieve a lot in this um time
09:25 - okay and this last one is just going to
09:28 - be else because um for the last one just
09:31 - do else like this
09:32 - else age is this
09:36 - then do 90
09:40 - then retired retired there we go
09:44 - so now if you want to just go to ask
09:47 - your
09:49 - what else age oh
09:52 - huh enter your age what's wrong
09:57 - or do i or we could just do a live it
10:00 - doesn't really matter guys so just
10:02 - do a lift if you want um
10:05 - yeah let's see there we go enter your
10:07 - age so let's try all of them
10:09 - sixth child
10:13 - play again uh
10:16 - eleven
10:21 - is less than
10:24 - 10. what enter your age here
10:28 - value input 10 11 see okay let's just
10:31 - try again then
10:33 - so how about we try 10
10:37 - child but 11
10:40 - so let's just set this to 11 let's do
10:43 - 21 no no wonder it um does that for
10:46 - every single one
10:47 - okay there we go
10:50 - here we are and enter your age here
10:52 - let's try 11 again
10:54 - child good now
10:57 - um let's try 18.
11:01 - oh sorry we have to click play again so
11:04 - let's try 18 boom
11:07 - teenager nice
11:10 - uh how about 45.
11:15 - i keep on printing over there 20 45
11:18 - 45 is prime of life
11:23 - and um how about
11:26 - 67. retired so there we go guys it's a
11:30 - pretty simple program that you can use
11:33 - um for ranking and for me i could i use
11:37 - this
11:37 - for like a bunch of different things
11:38 - like i have ideas like pretend
11:41 - as we send um last video like
11:44 - uh the dominus okay it it ranks like
11:47 - how much money if you can like buy or
11:50 - not so
11:51 - now we're gonna check uh if you're
11:54 - um your skill okay pretend there's a
11:57 - hundred
11:58 - to a hundred skill uh we're going to
12:00 - enter
12:02 - so pretend you made a game right and
12:03 - enter your skill points here
12:06 - [Music]
12:09 - there and then after this we can say
12:12 - like
12:12 - if age which actually should change this
12:16 - if skill um and then just change out
12:20 - this
12:22 - skill
12:25 - skill
12:30 - and then so on like this
12:34 - okay once it's like that then um you can
12:37 - like
12:38 - change it to like noob
12:41 - um enter me do it
12:45 - and then uh
12:50 - advanced
12:54 - and pro there we go like this
12:57 - so you can use it for your age
13:00 - for all other sorts of things so like
13:02 - every 10 9
13:04 - new um here so 21 let's try
13:08 - 18 intermediate
13:12 - uh 43 advanced
13:16 - and lately 88.
13:20 - pro there we go so that's easy way to
13:22 - use if else in a lift
13:24 - so yeah i hope you enjoyed this video um
13:27 - i hope you found something useful
13:28 - see you next episode see ya bye
