00:01 - hi guys my name is jeremy and today i'm
00:03 - going to be showing you
00:04 - compound um assignments and it's
00:07 - basically
00:08 - uh the math commands but in shorter
00:11 - terms
00:12 - so you wouldn't have to write all that
00:13 - code so let me just um get you started
00:16 - first of all we need uh to name our
00:18 - topic again
00:19 - so com pound
00:24 - uh sub no compound
00:29 - um compound assignment
00:32 - so as i
00:35 - sign that's there assignment
00:39 - um and then what you do is uh
00:42 - usually you would go like this right x
00:45 - equals to
00:46 - 10 um and then we do
00:49 - uh y equals to x
00:53 - subtracted by five right so if we do
00:56 - something like that then what's the
00:58 - result wait let me just
01:00 - print why like that okay what's the
01:03 - result
01:05 - five right but as you can see it's
01:07 - pretty long um
01:08 - if we want to make it shorter it's
01:10 - pretty simple all you have to do
01:12 - is this x
01:16 - minus equals
01:20 - to 10. like that
01:24 - nope okay right here change this to
01:27 - x real quick okay
01:31 - zero because minus ten and x is ten so
01:34 - zero everyone equals five subtract this
01:38 - to five then it's five so it's much
01:40 - easier than having to do
01:42 - something as long as um x
01:46 - no y equals to
01:50 - x minus
01:53 - five like it's much easier okay it's
01:56 - much more
01:57 - um shorter too so yeah now
02:00 - there's more commands not only do you
02:03 - you can do this
02:04 - but there's more so there is let me just
02:08 - comment this there's x
02:12 - add equals to
02:15 - five so now it's going to add on x it
02:18 - should be 15.
02:20 - okay yep and there's 15
02:23 - okay and this is the same as
02:28 - oops and then it should be the same as
02:33 - this
02:34 - uh like this okay now
02:37 - um it's way shorter as you can see and
02:40 - there is still more
02:41 - with multiplication um division
02:44 - uh exponents
02:48 - modulus which is remainders rounded
02:51 - quotients and a bunch more so let me
02:53 - just show you
02:54 - um what they do so this one is exponents
02:59 - x and then two
03:03 - um stars uh
03:06 - equal to five so now it's going to
03:11 - um exponent ten by five so it's ten by
03:13 - the power of five
03:15 - and there we go that's a bunch okay
03:19 - after we're done with that uh we're
03:21 - going to do
03:23 - how about multiplication normal one okay
03:25 - so here it is
03:26 - x um star
03:31 - equal to five so it's five times ten
03:33 - should be fifty
03:35 - yep fifty there we go so as you can see
03:38 - it's
03:38 - way way shorter it's more easier to use
03:40 - too
03:41 - um so yeah i recommend you using it
03:45 - uh we're not done yet though so let's go
03:48 - ahead and do division
03:50 - division is just a slash okay slash
03:53 - equals to five you divide ten by five
03:57 - should be two two there you go
04:00 - how about we do 10 by 3
04:04 - okay let's see 10 by 3 is um
04:08 - it has a bunch of decimals right however
04:10 - if we want to round the decimals then
04:12 - what we do is
04:13 - x double slash equals to
04:17 - three there now it should round it to
04:22 - one rounded
04:26 - rounding it to a one wait one sec
04:29 - so x divided by three
04:33 - hmm that should work too okay so
04:37 - let me just see or you could always just
04:40 - use the old you know
04:42 - method where you go like this x
04:45 - oh no no i think you need to
04:48 - comment this before you do that okay x
04:52 - double slash equals two three let's see
04:57 - yes there we go equals c3 that i didn't
04:59 - comment this so it
05:00 - um triggered something so yeah
05:03 - now that's the rounded uh rounded
05:05 - quotient now let's
05:06 - do the um
05:10 - now let's do there's nothing else no
05:12 - there's modulus which is
05:14 - remainders so for the remainders we do x
05:18 - percentage sign equals
05:21 - to five no actually that's that
05:24 - three so then it should be one because
05:27 - three goes into ten three times which
05:28 - leaves
05:29 - which is nine and there's one remainder
05:31 - so
05:32 - let's see it should be one yep there you
05:35 - go one
05:36 - so guys this is the compound assignment
05:39 - it's pretty simple um it makes her code
05:42 - a whole lot
05:43 - more short more concise and it doesn't
05:45 - need to be this long as you can see over
05:47 - here
05:47 - although this method still works too so
05:49 - if you don't understand this quite yet
05:51 - then you could use this
05:52 - however i recommend you using this
05:54 - because it's more easier to understand
05:56 - and it's way more shorter it'll save a
05:58 - bunch of time
06:00 - so yeah see you next video bye
