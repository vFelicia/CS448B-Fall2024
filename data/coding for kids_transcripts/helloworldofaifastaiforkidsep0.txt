00:00 - hello everybody it's your banana boy
00:02 - jemmy here and today i will be giving
00:04 - you a brief overview on fastai for kids
00:06 - today is episode zero and we're just
00:09 - going to be looking at some fundamentals
00:10 - of fastai and i'm going to be explaining
00:12 - in the most simple ways so that even
00:14 - kids can understand what an ai is and um
00:17 - next episode i'm going to be showing you
00:19 - how to build an ai in 10 minutes or more
00:22 - and uh so stay around for that
00:24 - [Music]
00:25 - so fast ai slogan is making your own
00:27 - networks uncool again what does this
00:29 - slogan mean so basically this slogan is
00:33 - uh
00:34 - to
00:36 - motivate them to basically make uh
00:39 - ai more accessible by everybody to make
00:42 - it more simple and not only the good
00:44 - people like the smart people uh can know
00:47 - what an ai is and can build one and
00:49 - instead everybody can do it even like
00:51 - kid and uh people who don't have like a
00:54 - good degree in math or a phd and yeah so
00:57 - that's what their slogan means what is
00:59 - deep learning basically what is an ai
01:02 - deep learning is a computer technique
01:04 - that pulls information
01:06 - important information out of like your
01:08 - general data which you put in so you put
01:10 - in like maybe cats and then you get out
01:12 - like uh these specific type of cats like
01:14 - pretend uh bun bun is a exotic short
01:18 - hair so you pull out that specific type
01:20 - of cat out of like these huge images of
01:22 - cats like a thousand uh maybe ten 000
01:25 - images and you pull out those specific
01:27 - view
01:28 - what is fastai so if you want to know
01:29 - more about fastai you can go to their
01:31 - website but basically they're a program
01:33 - that we're going to use in order to
01:35 - create our ai that we're going to be
01:37 - making and the founders of fast ai is
01:39 - professor jeremy howard and professor
01:41 - rachel thomas um these two are really
01:44 - good at ai stuff rachel is uh better at
01:47 - math and then jeremy is really good at
01:49 - deep learning and stuff
01:52 - so what can an ai do so this is
01:54 - basically some highlight of an ai there
01:57 - is much more than this but this is only
01:59 - a few things it can do so the first
02:01 - thing it can do is image generation have
02:04 - you ever saw those white black and white
02:05 - photos of people in the olden days like
02:08 - during war or like uh
02:10 - i don't know like your grandmother
02:12 - grandfather they have like black and
02:13 - white photos and a i can actually turn
02:16 - those photos into
02:17 - um a colorful one like so you can see
02:20 - right here this is black and white one
02:21 - now this is a colorful one um this is
02:23 - made by ai and the next one is autopilot
02:26 - so tesla which is like the electric car
02:29 - company that elon musk i'm not sure if
02:31 - you heard of it but they basically can
02:33 - create uh
02:35 - and you can drive your car to like
02:37 - mcdonald's safely um and not hurt
02:40 - anybody so yeah they use ai for that too
02:43 - and the also recommendation systems like
02:45 - youtube facebook or any other social
02:48 - media platforms that are like big uh
02:51 - they will use recommendation system to
02:52 - like give you some content that you
02:55 - might like uh
02:56 - depending on your previous uh likes and
02:59 - subscribe uh subscriptions
03:02 - like this picture right here you buy
03:03 - this duff can and then they compare
03:06 - something similar to it this stuff
03:08 - t-shirt and then they recommend it to
03:10 - you just like so
03:12 - and now let's meet our master which
03:15 - who's going to be training um our course
03:17 - wizard fast tie so once upon a time
03:20 - there lived a young small elephant named
03:22 - foodie duty foodie duty likes to travel
03:24 - and eat foods that he never tried before
03:26 - all around the world
03:28 - however there was a problem foodie duty
03:29 - cannot eat anything spicy or any dish
03:32 - that contains shrimp because he's
03:33 - allergic to shrimp
03:36 - and the way he solved this problem was
03:38 - that anything that has a red color on it
03:40 - then he's going to assume it's spicy
03:42 - anything that has a yellow or pale color
03:44 - he's going to assume it's not spicy and
03:46 - then the way he would avoid shrimp is
03:48 - that if a dish has a shrimp then he
03:51 - would avoid it but if he could he
03:53 - couldn't see the shrimp
03:54 - then he would give the dish a try
03:56 - however these senses were really
03:57 - inaccurate and he couldn't depend on it
04:00 - so once uh so one time when sweetie duty
04:03 - was traveling he met a wizard called
04:04 - fast tie fast thai then told him the
04:07 - secret spell of depot ironing deeper
04:09 - ironing will make foodie droopy grow a
04:11 - magic eye for thai food this magic eye
04:14 - is to help foodie duty classify thai
04:16 - food under name ingredients spiciness
04:19 - and calories
04:19 - [Music]
04:21 - and every time foodie duty trained with
04:23 - its magic spell deeplearning his magic
04:25 - eye got more powerful
04:27 - and then the more powerful he got the
04:29 - more accurate his magic eye is
04:31 - until one day he was super accurate with
04:33 - all his decisions
04:35 - so foodie duty now travels worldwide to
04:37 - help other people classify thai food on
04:39 - their names spiciness calories and
04:41 - ingredients
04:42 - so once we've met our master wizard fast
04:45 - high we're going to be looking at some
04:47 - tools we're going to be using so the
04:49 - first tool is google and a google
04:51 - account and the second tool comes along
04:53 - with a google account which is a google
04:54 - collab um these two you need a google
04:57 - account first so if you don't know how
04:59 - to sign up then just go to youtube
05:01 - there's a bunch of good tutorials and uh
05:03 - once you're there you can pause the
05:05 - video and come back
05:07 - for whoever has a google account we can
05:09 - now just go ahead and follow my steps so
05:13 - go into a new tab control t and just do
05:16 - um type in the search bar google
05:19 - collab like so and press enter
05:22 - it should come up into a page something
05:24 - like this if there's ad in front then
05:26 - just go to the second one which has the
05:28 - link collab.research.google.com
05:30 - click on it and it should comment
05:33 - it shouldn't come up in the page like
05:34 - this uh it should go into that file but
05:36 - it shouldn't have uh any of that um
05:40 - uh files that i had click close and now
05:43 - you should come into a page like me
05:44 - welcome to collab uh but we're not gonna
05:47 - be really using this we're gonna go in
05:49 - files and we're gonna click new notebook
05:51 - over here and we can just x this one out
05:53 - if we don't want it
05:55 - and once we're here
05:57 - uh look we can wait a bit
06:00 - and there we go once we're here we can
06:02 - rename this um to anything we would like
06:05 - i'm renaming it to
06:07 - uh
06:08 - past ai
06:10 - ep
06:11 - 0 oh i shouldn't put point there it
06:13 - might mess something up there you go and
06:16 - now we can have we have like lines here
06:18 - and oh there's doggos i will show you
06:21 - how to do it your page probably looks
06:22 - white right now if you just came in um
06:25 - so i will show you how to change it to
06:27 - my settings click on tools uh settings
06:31 - and then in here select the theme too
06:34 - dark if you want it if you have light
06:36 - it's pretty bright for me i don't really
06:37 - like it it's way too bright so tools
06:40 - settings
06:41 - and to dark dark looks much better um
06:44 - now for the doggos and cats what you
06:46 - want to do is you want to click on
06:48 - miscellaneous and um
06:51 - i don't think that's it uh oh this is
06:53 - also another one this is pretty cool but
06:54 - don't click on power click on these two
06:56 - enable them if you disable them then the
06:58 - doggos and cats don't come anymore so
07:00 - enable both of them and the dog boost
07:02 - and catch will come power level if you
07:05 - oh my god um if you click many many
07:07 - power okay let's see what it is click
07:09 - save
07:10 - now go to a search bar and let's let's
07:14 - type oh oh there's a little sparks okay
07:16 - combo counter okay now what if what if
07:18 - we would have what if we do this oh oh
07:20 - it's lagging a little bit
07:22 - oh i don't
07:23 - oh
07:24 - ah yes
07:25 - the big combo 225 oh 400 combo 300 400
07:31 - yeah you can see that it just lagged
07:32 - your computer out too much i'm getting
07:34 - like four frames now or something but uh
07:37 - yeah so don't do this um
07:39 - i mean you can do it if you want to but
07:41 - like you gotta type a bit slower you
07:42 - know
07:43 - like this i mean it looks pretty cool
07:44 - it's like sparks but it's not
07:48 - so yeah don't uh do that don't add the
07:52 - power i mean you could but like it's
07:54 - going to be very laggy so just go turn
07:56 - it off tools settings and just open up
07:59 - here miscellaneous and just turn to some
08:01 - power if you want it just does it some
08:03 - random time but i'm going to select no
08:04 - power because i don't like that it
08:05 - distracts me from coding too so yeah
08:08 - that is it and now we're going to look
08:10 - into our next slide which is how to
08:12 - optimize our google collab so i already
08:15 - showed you how to display mode light and
08:16 - dark and i already showed you the secret
08:19 - setting which is dog and cats but
08:21 - we're going to be looking at how to
08:22 - activate our gpu what is a gpu gpu is a
08:25 - graph it's a graphic card which
08:27 - basically allows you to
08:29 - run neural networks
08:31 - hundreds of times faster than a cpu can
08:34 - so we have to set it to gpu or else
08:36 - it'll be default to cpu so yeah let's go
08:39 - back into our collab file and we're
08:41 - going to click on a
08:43 - video i'm pretty sure and we're going to
08:45 - click on notebook info uh nope not this
08:48 - uh
08:49 - edit uh notebook settings there you go
08:52 - and hardware selector accelerator um we
08:54 - can see it's none right now select gpu
08:57 - right here but keep in mind that um to
08:59 - get most out of cool app avoid using gpu
09:01 - unless you need one so basically uh if
09:04 - you aren't using it then
09:06 - using google cloud then you should turn
09:07 - it off because we are sharing another we
09:09 - are sharing these computers with other
09:11 - people all around the world and yeah so
09:13 - you should keep in mind that uh if
09:15 - you're using it like but you're actually
09:18 - not typing or coding anything then you
09:20 - should turn it off because other
09:21 - people's work will slow down too but i
09:24 - think it will automatically disconnect
09:25 - you if you're like afk so click save
09:27 - after that and your thing should be
09:29 - running pretty fast now
09:31 - now i'm going to show you some simplest
09:33 - coding stuff so adding code and text
09:36 - um simple math printing and commenting
09:39 - well let's get right into it these are
09:41 - just the basics of code uh collab so
09:44 - these are plus code and plus text you
09:46 - can see our new line here if we type
09:48 - something in there and we want to get
09:50 - like a new line if we press enter it
09:52 - doesn't work right i'm pretty sure
09:54 - there's a command for this but oh there
09:56 - you go uh if you there's another command
09:58 - if you just want to create a new one is
10:00 - shift enter but you can see that it's
10:03 - going to run this code too so
10:05 - um don't do it yet if you don't want to
10:08 - run this code uh you wait until it's
10:10 - initialized and connected in order to
10:11 - actually run it's going to come from an
10:13 - error because it doesn't understand it
10:15 - but let's delete this and click on add
10:17 - code and you can see it a new line pops
10:19 - up
10:20 - and you can keep on adding how much
10:21 - lines you ever want or control z this
10:24 - back oh it can't oh i'll just delete
10:26 - some
10:27 - all right and you can also add text um
10:30 - text is different because you aren't
10:31 - actually uh going to
10:33 - um
10:34 - run anything for the code it's just
10:36 - going to be like a little reminder for
10:37 - you or like for other people who are
10:39 - sharing your notebook to so this is a
10:42 - text
10:43 - like so and then press shift enter and
10:46 - then you can see it's enabled here and a
10:48 - good thing about collab is
10:50 - let me delete this really quick
10:52 - um you can actually make it bold or you
10:54 - can make it any com oh that's not it
10:57 - any uh size you want the more this you
11:00 - add i'm pretty sure the bigger it is and
11:02 - you can see it resets at three so yeah
11:05 - so now let's press shift enter and see
11:07 - how big it is
11:09 - does it did i not increase the size
11:12 - yeah as you can see the size definitely
11:14 - increased um and that's how you play
11:16 - around with the
11:18 - uh the text and stuff so yeah have fun
11:20 - with that the next part we're gonna be
11:22 - looking at is simple math so simple math
11:24 - we're just gonna be doing one plus one
11:26 - you can use this as a calculator for
11:27 - your math
11:28 - math problems from school too one plus
11:31 - one
11:32 - shift enter or just uh sh
11:34 - i don't control enter i'm pretty sure
11:36 - yeah i haven't used collab in quite a
11:37 - while ctrl enter two equals to two um
11:40 - you can do whatever equation you'd like
11:42 - whatever
11:43 - plus
11:45 - this much
11:46 - control enter
11:47 - control enters to run and it gives you
11:49 - the correct answer so the next one we're
11:51 - going to be looking at is printing so
11:53 - let's print out a code printing is
11:55 - basically making the program type for us
11:58 - so we're going to be printing um
12:00 - hello ai world just like in our first
12:03 - slide
12:04 - so let's print it out
12:05 - so first off type print this is the
12:08 - command to print print like so and once
12:11 - you've done this put in parentheses
12:13 - click nine shift and nine then it'll
12:16 - give you a whole bracket you don't need
12:17 - to press shift nine and then zero um
12:20 - once you've done this uh click back into
12:22 - the bracket and add uh either a double
12:26 - quote or a single quote i like single
12:27 - quotes because i don't need to press
12:28 - shift but it's basically up to you now
12:30 - we're going to print hello ai world
12:36 - like so and when you press ctrl enter
12:39 - you can see that it goes hello ai world
12:42 - so that is how to print simple commands
12:45 - and the next last one we're gonna do is
12:47 - commenting commenting is really easy so
12:50 - pretend we want to like have a mental
12:52 - note to ourselves without creating a
12:53 - text we can just do hashtag
12:56 - let's see where hashtag is
12:58 - hashtag
13:01 - i can't find a hashtag oh there you go
13:03 - hashtag is number three so shift 3 and
13:05 - then just type something in there this
13:08 - is a comment
13:09 - and will
13:11 - not affect
13:12 - a factor effect unless you affect
13:16 - the code
13:17 - and you can see
13:18 - we can do control enter and it will just
13:21 - do the same code over but if we didn't
13:23 - have the hashtag here
13:25 - we can just click shift uh control enter
13:27 - again let's see what it does you can see
13:29 - it comes up an error but if we put
13:31 - hashtag
13:32 - we can do shift enter or not shift enter
13:35 - control enter and it will just go hello
13:36 - ai world so this is it for today's video
13:40 - i hope you enjoyed it stay tuned for the
13:42 - next one we're going to be creating an
13:43 - ai in less than 10 minutes or maybe more
13:46 - but very little it's very easy and i
13:49 - will show you how to do it so stay tuned
13:51 - for that click subscribe if you enjoyed
13:52 - the video click like if you did enjoyed
13:54 - this video and click this like if you
13:56 - don't um and if you have any questions
13:58 - please comment thank you for watching
14:00 - this video goodbye
