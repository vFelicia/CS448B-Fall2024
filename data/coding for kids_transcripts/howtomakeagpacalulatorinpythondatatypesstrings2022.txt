00:00 - hello everybody my name is jemmy and
00:01 - today i will be continuing my series of
00:03 - teaching myself python in the future so
00:05 - that i don't forget python in the future
00:08 - um something like that i don't know the
00:09 - series name anymore but today is ep 2
00:12 - and
00:13 - it's going to be about data types and
00:15 - strings so let's get right into it again
00:17 - i'm going to be using jupyter notebook
00:19 - but you can use any python code editor
00:22 - you want and if you want to install
00:23 - jupyter notebook it's going to be in the
00:25 - description it's a video and you can go
00:27 - follow it so this is the home page of
00:30 - jupiter notebook we're going to press
00:31 - new python 3 ipy kernel right here and
00:35 - we're going to rename our notebook so
00:37 - let's rename this to
00:39 - anything you want actually today we're
00:40 - also going to be making a gpa calculator
00:42 - so you could use that at school if you
00:44 - want i'm going to be naming this
00:46 - data types like so and then i would
00:49 - click rename and once i have it renamed
00:52 - it's a bit messy
00:53 - i'm going to change string to it capital
00:55 - s looks more better
00:56 - okay once we have it name like so we're
00:59 - gonna actually begin our code with
01:01 - welcoming them to what we're gonna be
01:03 - making today we're gonna be making a gpa
01:05 - calculator i might have just said that
01:06 - but um it's gonna be really cool we're
01:08 - gonna make it by yourself so let's say
01:11 - uh print
01:14 - welcome
01:15 - to the world's
01:17 - best gpa calculator
01:22 - like so
01:23 - and you know just to give the user a
01:25 - little hint on what they're uh actually
01:28 - using right now or not using sorry um
01:31 - what they're about to get into so we're
01:34 - gonna have input right here please
01:37 - uh press enter to continue so press
01:40 - enter to continue this is so that we can
01:43 - slow down the program a little bit you
01:44 - know so instead of just rushing them
01:46 - with the questions we're gonna have like
01:48 - uh like a little break so press enter to
01:50 - continue and let's run the code right
01:53 - now i really don't know why it does that
01:56 - like it um
01:57 - the press enter to continue appears
01:59 - before the print but you know it's fine
02:02 - and then if we press enter
02:04 - then it goes out into here but um let's
02:07 - actually put this in the variable so it
02:09 - doesn't have that output thingy
02:12 - now let's run this again all right so
02:14 - once we have done this it just doesn't
02:16 - really do anything yet because we
02:17 - haven't programmed it to do anything i'm
02:19 - going to add some
02:20 - aster licks i'm not sure what that's
02:22 - called uh like so make it look a little
02:24 - bit more professional and then from then
02:26 - we're going to actually ask them the
02:27 - first question so the first question is
02:29 - going to be how much subjects they have
02:31 - right so we need to know the amount so
02:34 - we're going to create a list called
02:35 - amount like so
02:37 - and we're not actually it's not a list
02:38 - it's gonna be an input like so and then
02:41 - we're gonna say how much
02:44 - subjects
02:46 - do you
02:48 - have like so
02:50 - and once we did this uh we're gonna try
02:53 - running again so press enter to continue
02:56 - and then after that we give them a
02:58 - question how much subjects you have they
03:00 - could put in anything they want but they
03:02 - could put in like three or something
03:04 - i'm gonna actually have a little space
03:06 - here so now once we know how much
03:07 - subjects they have we actually don't
03:09 - know what their subject is about so um
03:12 - we should need to ask them what their
03:14 - individual subjects their the name of
03:15 - their subjects like math science uh
03:18 - world civilizations language arts
03:20 - something like that so first let's start
03:22 - off by having a new list called subject
03:25 - list
03:27 - like so so we can store the information
03:30 - like so and then from then we're going
03:32 - to have another question but this is
03:34 - going to be a bit different from other
03:36 - from these ones because we have to
03:38 - repeat it in a loop so for i in range in
03:41 - range white we're going to change this
03:43 - to int amount
03:44 - because um right here this is gonna be
03:48 - like five four three two right so we're
03:51 - gonna have it as uh in here because
03:53 - we're gonna have to go to each one of
03:55 - their subjects and we have to have int
03:57 - here to convert this uh amount or right
04:00 - now it's actually a string even though
04:02 - it's a number it's a string type so
04:05 - we're gonna have to change it to an
04:06 - integer type and this won't work if the
04:08 - they put in like um
04:10 - us like a letter or like a string it has
04:12 - to be a number strictly so once you have
04:15 - all this we'll put a colon and we'll
04:17 - enter it in now let's create another
04:18 - subject called s1 for subject one um and
04:21 - then we're gonna just make it equal to
04:24 - an input so input
04:26 - and then we're gonna have a little colon
04:28 - there and we're gonna ask them what uh
04:31 - so what
04:32 - is your and then space plus sign
04:37 - we're gonna go with str i plus one i'm
04:40 - pretty sure i could just know i's an
04:41 - industry right so we're gonna go with
04:43 - str
04:44 - i plus one so this way it will uh every
04:47 - time it loops i increases by one so uh
04:50 - we can actually
04:51 - um like ask them what is your first
04:54 - second third fourth subject um and where
04:56 - the reason we put one here is because i
04:58 - start from zero so if we just ask them
05:00 - what is your zero subject that wouldn't
05:02 - really make sense so we have that a
05:04 - little
05:05 - a plus one there and then we're going to
05:07 - create another thing at the end which
05:09 - says subject
05:11 - like so a little space and now let's try
05:14 - running the code so press enter to
05:15 - continue how much subjects do you have i
05:17 - have four
05:19 - uh so let's put in four where's your
05:21 - first subject world
05:22 - sieve
05:24 - what is your second subject math
05:27 - uh science uh and maybe language arts
05:30 - and there you go so now once we have uh
05:33 - got every single thing we actually need
05:35 - to store the information so we're gonna
05:36 - append the information that we got into
05:39 - a list so we're going to do
05:41 - uh where is it subject
05:44 - subject list dot append and what we're
05:48 - going to append is s1 so let's try this
05:50 - out again but actually i'm gonna have it
05:53 - let me stop the code first okay
05:55 - we're gonna have it printed out so print
05:58 - subject list
06:00 - subject list like so
06:02 - okay let's speed run through this so
06:04 - i'll have three math
06:06 - science and
06:08 - worlds right
06:10 - and then there you go our list now has
06:11 - math science enrolled civ which is what
06:13 - they entered um so now we have stored
06:16 - their information somewhere we're gonna
06:17 - ask them again like how much points do
06:20 - you have for math how much points you
06:21 - have for signs how much points you have
06:23 - for world civilizations so then we can
06:25 - finally conduct their gpa all right so
06:28 - first before we start asking the
06:30 - questions we have to uh create a list to
06:32 - store their points somewhere so we're
06:34 - going to name this
06:35 - point list like so
06:38 - equals to a little like bracket and then
06:40 - we're going to have
06:42 - nothing in it because we're just
06:43 - declaring a list right now and then
06:45 - we're going to have another for loop for
06:46 - i in range
06:48 - and then it's the same thing int amount
06:50 - right here so copy and paste this in
06:53 - uh right here and then press enter and
06:56 - now we're gonna do p1 for point one and
06:59 - equals to
07:00 - uh input
07:04 - what
07:05 - is your
07:07 - point
07:08 - for
07:09 - and then we'll have a plus right here
07:12 - and then we're gonna have
07:14 - the
07:16 - subject list subject list
07:18 - and then we're gonna have a bracket here
07:20 - so this way we're gonna be calling
07:22 - um everything from this list starting
07:24 - off with zero so subject list uh i so
07:28 - pretend we had uh math science and world
07:31 - civ in the subject list
07:33 - we're going to have we're it's going to
07:34 - call out math first so what is your
07:36 - point for math and then
07:38 - we're going to have a little question
07:40 - mark at the end just to make it look
07:41 - better all right let's run this again so
07:43 - press enter to continue how much
07:44 - subjects you have i have three what's
07:46 - your first subject uh let's say math
07:50 - science
07:52 - and then la what is your points for math
07:54 - let's say 80 and there you go you can
07:56 - see let me add a little space there uh
07:59 - what is your point for signs
08:01 - uh 90 and then you could even put like
08:03 - that much too it doesn't really matter
08:05 - right now we have to store our their
08:07 - information somewhere too
08:08 - just like we did for our first loop so
08:11 - we're going to append this to point list
08:14 - so point list dot append
08:17 - and then we're going to have um p1 as
08:20 - the thing that's getting append so let's
08:22 - print out point list
08:24 - print point
08:27 - point list like so
08:30 - uh how much subject you have three math
08:33 - science oh world
08:35 - sieve how much what is your points for
08:37 - math let's say 80
08:39 - to 23
08:41 - 50 or something like that and you can
08:43 - see the point list has 80 23 and 50 just
08:46 - like we did before and yeah that's
08:48 - basically how we store the information
08:50 - but now the main point in this little
08:53 - loop we have right here is that we have
08:56 - to convert the 80 23 50 into
09:00 - four three two one zero because that's
09:03 - the actual grade that you're gonna be
09:05 - using for your gpa so we're going to
09:07 - have a bunch of if alif statements so
09:09 - let's start off right here we're going
09:10 - to put this right through the middle so
09:12 - um instead of appending 80 23 and 50
09:16 - we're actually going to be appending uh
09:19 - four three two one zero so let's put if
09:23 - if
09:24 - uh
09:25 - p1
09:26 - p1
09:27 - is greater
09:29 - greater than
09:31 - nine
09:32 - instead of okay so we're gonna have it
09:34 - so that 80 to 100
09:37 - is getting a 470 to 8 70 to 79 is
09:41 - getting a three
09:43 - 60 to 69 is getting off two and then 50
09:47 - to 59 is getting uh
09:49 - one and then from there everything below
09:51 - 50 is getting a zero i'm not sure if i
09:53 - said that correctly but um that's
09:55 - basically the main point of it
09:57 - so p1 is 79 okay is greater than 79 the
10:01 - reason we're putting 79 here is because
10:03 - if we put 80 here
10:05 - and then we put like p
10:07 - 1 is uh
10:10 - less than 80
10:11 - on our second lift then 80 will just not
10:14 - be in the statement at all so we have to
10:16 - put 79 like so and then we're gonna put
10:19 - and p1
10:21 - is less than 100
10:25 - actually no let's just put is greater
10:27 - than 79 because uh let's pretend the
10:29 - teacher gave them extra credit so they
10:31 - got like 104 105 points then they would
10:34 - get uh they will still get four for
10:36 - their uh
10:37 - grade so if p1 is greater than 79
10:40 - uh
10:41 - then
10:43 - append
10:44 - not append uh let's say
10:47 - oh yeah let's append a pen
10:50 - uh pointless dot append i'm gonna just
10:51 - copy and paste this in there actually
10:53 - and instead of having a pen at the end
10:55 - we're gonna append right here so append
10:57 - instead of p1 we're gonna have a pen
10:59 - four
11:00 - because this is the top grade they're
11:02 - gonna get
11:03 - and we're gonna have another a lift so
11:06 - alif
11:07 - p1 is greater than uh
11:10 - we're gonna now lower it down to 70
11:12 - right so 69
11:14 - uh and
11:16 - p1 is
11:17 - less than
11:19 - 81 i'm pretty sure
11:21 - and from then we're gonna have point
11:23 - list dot append you can just copy paste
11:25 - this one
11:26 - copy paste and then we're going to
11:28 - change this to three and we're just copy
11:30 - paste this one and then put it in there
11:33 - and then change this one to
11:35 - 59
11:36 - 59 this one to
11:39 - uh
11:40 - 61 i think or
11:42 - 61
11:43 - yeah i think it's 61. um
11:46 - hopefully i didn't skip anything so
11:50 - uh i don't think i did okay it's a bit
11:52 - confusing but uh just
11:55 - add this one by one decrease this one by
11:57 - one
11:58 - okay and then now
12:00 - so we have four three let's change it to
12:02 - two and one is basically going to be 49
12:04 - to 50 or no sorry 50 to 60 but instead
12:08 - we're gonna have to do a bit more
12:10 - confusing work so 51 like so
12:14 - and from then everything below 50 is
12:17 - going to be
12:19 - uh
12:21 - is going to be
12:23 - zero so
12:25 - everything
12:26 - that is less
12:27 - than
12:28 - 49
12:30 - is going wait 49 or 51. i know it's 49.
12:36 - yeah 49 everything less than 49 point
12:39 - list append
12:41 - uh
12:42 - zero
12:43 - okay
12:54 - not supported of s oh okay wait sorry
12:57 - guys i forgot to put make this an inch
12:59 - because right now it's a string so it's
13:01 - not compatible so just copy um right
13:04 - here
13:05 - and then paste it on top of every p1
13:08 - yeah i'm very sorry for this but it
13:10 - shouldn't be that hard to do
13:12 - like so oops
13:14 - like so there you go
13:25 - 65 should be in the range of
13:28 - two i'm pretty sure so in two we have
13:32 - 59 to 60 ah okay here's the error here's
13:35 - the error we're gonna change this to
13:37 - seven we're gonna change it to six
13:39 - and that should fix everything hopefully
13:42 - okay that that's where everything just
13:44 - went
13:44 - derailed okay let's try it again
13:50 - now once we have this we're actually
13:51 - going to test it out first to make sure
13:54 - it works so print um
13:57 - a point list
13:59 - point list once it's done so let's run
14:01 - this out press enter continue how much
14:03 - subjects let's say for
14:05 - math
14:07 - math
14:08 - uh what's your second subject
14:10 - language arts world
14:12 - sieve oh
14:14 - and then was your fourth subject uh it
14:16 - could be science
14:18 - like so and i i put something there um
14:21 - what is your points for math uh let's
14:23 - say
14:25 - 80 right so if we put 80 here i it has
14:29 - to become four
14:31 - so let's put 80
14:33 - all right let's see
14:35 - and then paste it on top of every p1
14:38 - yeah i'm very sorry for this but it
14:40 - shouldn't be that hard to do
14:42 - like so oops like so there you go let's
14:46 - try running again i'm gonna go through
14:48 - this one really fast
14:49 - okay i'm gonna go through this one very
14:51 - fast so oh wait i forgot that wasn't the
14:53 - enter one so
14:54 - four subjects world sieve
14:58 - math
14:59 - science and la
15:02 - like so what is your points for world
15:04 - civ i'll say 80.
15:06 - what's your points for math
15:08 - uh
15:09 - let's say
15:10 - 104 percent got extra credit and then
15:13 - that what's your point for science five
15:15 - i did really bad and then for this one
15:17 - let's just put at 50 right okay let's
15:19 - try 50. so four four zero one which is
15:23 - what is supposed to happen everything
15:25 - that is 50 i'm pretty sure um is going
15:28 - to be
15:29 - one yeah and then everything below 50 is
15:32 - going to be zero so i made it off the
15:34 - hook right there and i want to try one
15:36 - more thing i want to have it at 49. i
15:39 - want to see where that goes to so how
15:40 - much subjects you have let's say one
15:43 - uh i'll just say sdf or something sef
15:46 - put your point for sef um
15:48 - let's put 49. it should be zero
15:52 - okay it hasn't appended which means that
15:54 - we have done something wrong in the code
15:56 - right here so i'm going to change this
15:58 - to 50 and let's see if it happens again
16:01 - because 49 wasn't appended it should
16:03 - have zero in the list but it didn't how
16:05 - many subjects you have
16:07 - one sef again or ser yes sir uh 49
16:13 - all right there you go we have a zero
16:14 - now again we have to it's trial and
16:16 - error encoding so
16:18 - we have debugged it and we have fixed
16:20 - the problem and after this we're gonna
16:22 - create a gpa calculator which is where
16:26 - we get all the information and then we
16:28 - actually calculate our gpa so let's have
16:30 - another variable that's final add
16:33 - like so
16:34 - equals to zero this is going to be a
16:37 - integer and uh from then we're gonna
16:39 - have another loop for i in range
16:42 - zero
16:43 - to
16:44 - int amount so we're going to copy into
16:46 - amount right here
16:47 - paste that in and then we're gonna
16:50 - we're gonna add every single thing
16:52 - inside of the list
16:54 - oh so final
16:56 - add
16:58 - final add-in you spelled correctly
17:00 - plus equals to this is basically a fancy
17:03 - way of saying final ad
17:05 - plus um
17:07 - grade list where is grade list or point
17:09 - list plus point list uh
17:11 - equals to final add which is just
17:14 - adding like all the numbers we saw in
17:16 - here so if there's like four zero one
17:18 - this would be five it's going to add
17:19 - everything so add plus equals to point
17:23 - list
17:25 - point list like so
17:27 - and we're gonna have i in here
17:31 - so it cycles through everything and
17:33 - after that we're going to have
17:35 - another variable called average which
17:37 - will find the average of all the grades
17:39 - so average equals to final ad
17:42 - and int amount so the amount of subjects
17:45 - and the final ads so divide each other
17:47 - because this is how to find the average
17:49 - if you don't know you add all the
17:51 - numbers and then you divide it by how
17:52 - much numbers there were or the amount of
17:54 - numbers and then you should get to the
17:56 - average so let's print
17:58 - out the average after that so print
18:01 - average now let's actually address them
18:03 - so
18:04 - your gpa
18:06 - is
18:07 - plus
18:09 - average
18:10 - oh and you no i gotta correct average
18:14 - and then plus an exclamation point
18:16 - okay
18:17 - and then actually that's just a great
18:18 - job or something great job
18:21 - like so ctrl enter uh unexpected at
18:25 - amount
18:26 - where is it for iron range oh i forgot a
18:28 - colon right there okay let's try it
18:30 - again press them to continue enter how
18:32 - much subjects do you have uh
18:36 - three four i don't know four or four

20:39 - 80 and five
20:41 - two four four zero okay that is correct
20:44 - um and the gpa is 2.5 we can actually
