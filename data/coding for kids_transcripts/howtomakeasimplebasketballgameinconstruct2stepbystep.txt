00:00 - hello everybody my name is Jimmy and
00:01 - today I will be showing you how to make
00:03 - this game in construct 2. uh this is the
00:06 - game we're gonna be making today I took
00:07 - inspiration from Google drawings uh this
00:10 - this one not Google drawings Google was
00:13 - it Google Doodles yeah it's like a
00:15 - basketball game where you have to like
00:16 - hold a basketball and then shoot it
00:19 - um obviously like like this and then
00:21 - there's a timer there's a score and then
00:24 - when the time runs out it uh you can't
00:27 - shoot anymore also it gets progressively
00:29 - harder so yeah that's the game type
00:31 - we're gonna be making today
00:33 - um yeah let's go ahead and make it right
00:34 - so this is what it looks like in
00:36 - construct 2.
00:38 - very different I know but hey it's still
00:40 - kind of the same game so here's our
00:42 - starting page it's of course complete
00:44 - for free you don't need to download
00:45 - anything no need for like fancy like you
00:48 - know gadgets completely for free so all
00:50 - these problems I decided myself uh you
00:52 - don't have to design them you could I
00:54 - have a link for you to download all the
00:55 - props I'm using in this video so I have
00:57 - this link attached in the description if
00:59 - you want to go download that just
01:01 - download it and unzip it so yeah this is
01:03 - what the game we're gonna be making so
01:04 - there's a guy here he shoots a
01:05 - basketball like in Google kind of
01:08 - except the animation's a bit not nicer
01:10 - and once it hits five now it starts to
01:13 - move and now it randomizes its speed so
01:16 - if you go up or down as you can see it's
01:18 - a lot harder to get points Bam Bam come
01:22 - on go in go in oh oh nice bro
01:27 - nice not nice not nice nice 2017 17. oh
01:32 - dang it so there you go once it runs out
01:34 - the timer it will say you scored how
01:36 - many points and it has a redo button
01:38 - right here you press redo it just starts
01:40 - over again like so uh yeah that's
01:42 - basically it for our game it's really
01:44 - simple and it shouldn't take more than
01:46 - like an hour so yeah let's go ahead and
01:47 - make it
01:50 - so first things first we will need
01:52 - construct two if you guys don't have
01:54 - construct 2 just go to construct to
01:55 - search it up like this click on the
01:57 - first link which is download construct
01:59 - 2.
02:00 - and then just go download the latest
02:02 - version uh I don't know what version I'm
02:04 - using but they should all be the same
02:05 - technically you could also use construct
02:07 - 3 but I'm not sure if it'll work so yeah
02:09 - just download construct 2 and then run
02:11 - it all right once you have construct 2
02:13 - we're going to open it like so and we
02:15 - should be greeted with this page uh with
02:17 - the start page and little you know
02:19 - Monster and pig pig catapult uh what we
02:22 - want to do now is we want to press file
02:24 - new and then scroll down a little bit
02:26 - until we find new HD landscape 720p this
02:31 - one uh we're gonna press open because
02:33 - this is the resolution we want as you
02:34 - can see the window size is 720p we're
02:37 - going to copy the window size which is
02:39 - this guy right here the borders and
02:41 - we're gonna paste it into our layout
02:44 - size bam so now we don't we got rid of
02:46 - the borders the border is basically like
02:48 - how what the players can see while
02:49 - playing the game so if you get rid of
02:51 - the borders they can see the entire
02:52 - screen which is what we want but
02:53 - sometimes you know for uh role play
02:55 - games or uh first person shooter games
02:58 - they sometimes have to hide a lot of the
03:00 - screen in order to make the uh the the
03:02 - person move around to check what's on
03:04 - like the next page or something but ours
03:06 - is a stationary game so we don't need
03:08 - that uh so once you've done like this
03:09 - that we can exit out the start page and
03:12 - we're going to rename our project into
03:13 - basketball
03:15 - basketball
03:17 - all right and after that we're gonna
03:20 - press our layout rename this to game
03:22 - because we're going to do the game first
03:24 - and then we're gonna do our starting and
03:26 - end page I might even add a chop if we
03:29 - have extra time game e or our event
03:32 - sheet
03:34 - like so all right now once we have this
03:37 - we're going to press Ctrl s to save it I
03:39 - have mine in construct 2 right here so
03:41 - I'm just going to create a new folder
03:43 - called basketball
03:45 - basketball we're gonna double click
03:47 - press I'll have a folder called code to
03:50 - store our code rename this basketball
03:55 - version one and press enter to save all
03:59 - right once we save this we're gonna go
04:00 - download our props that we want so we're
04:03 - gonna go to our Link in the description
04:04 - download right here it's not a virus by
04:07 - the way I'll download it for you uh once
04:09 - you download it it should be
04:11 - bballprops.zip open that up and then go
04:14 - to downloads extract extract all extract
04:18 - and then you should have b-ball Prof
04:20 - you're going to control X go to our
04:22 - folder basketball we're going to paste
04:24 - that in right here so we have Bebop
04:25 - props and we have a rebuild version one
04:27 - and then here oh wait
04:30 - wait a minute
04:32 - what happened
04:34 - wait what oh did I zipped the wrong
04:36 - thing hold on
04:39 - oh it's right here it's right here okay
04:40 - we're good we're good guys I think I
04:42 - didn't save it correctly so it
04:46 - it didn't work or something I have no
04:48 - idea but basically when you download it
04:50 - it shouldn't be code probably I uploaded
04:53 - something wrong but it should be
04:55 - something like this right guys
04:57 - um so ignore that so once you download
04:58 - it you should extract it and you should
05:00 - see a player and hoop so the hoop is
05:03 - just uh the hoop we're gonna be using
05:05 - and the players is going to be the
05:06 - animations so this is the idol this is
05:08 - the the step one stage two stage three
05:11 - stage four uh so yeah this is what we're
05:14 - gonna be using
05:15 - all right we can minimize our page now
05:17 - get rid of this uh just minimize that
05:20 - all right so first off if you want a
05:22 - background you can go ahead and add one
05:24 - but I'm not I'm gonna add a floor first
05:26 - that's our first priority
05:28 - so instead of the floor we can't because
05:30 - it's like a function in construct two
05:31 - we're gonna give me ground instead
05:33 - ground and we're gonna grab our bucket
05:35 - and we're gonna flip a good color for
05:38 - like a basketball court like somewhere
05:39 - orangey right maybe a little like
05:41 - lighter orange like a quart like wood a
05:45 - color French wood like that
05:48 - uh maybe it's a bit too orange a little
05:50 - bit more lighter
05:51 - I think that looks good all right we're
05:53 - gonna just put it right like this uh it
05:56 - depends on how thick you want I think I
05:57 - will have like this much just drag it
05:59 - across the entire thing make sure to
06:00 - leave some Edge room because sometimes
06:02 - construct 2 has a gradient on the ends
06:04 - which doesn't look that good and you can
06:06 - shorten it up like this and there you go
06:07 - we have our ground that's our first
06:08 - Sprite uh now we're gonna add our player
06:11 - so insert Sprite name this player
06:14 - a player enter and now we're gonna just
06:18 - simply do load an image from file or
06:21 - actually a better option would be import
06:23 - frames from files like so go to our
06:26 - construct 2 or basketball basketball
06:28 - props player highlight all of them and
06:32 - press open then we have all of our
06:34 - images right let's delete zero all right
06:37 - so once we have this we're going to
06:39 - rename this just to no let me just leave
06:41 - like that all right we're gonna click on
06:43 - our origin point this is very important
06:44 - so pay attention press your origin point
06:46 - and set it on the head like somewhere
06:49 - where it's like stationary I left for my
06:51 - last one I said on the head right here
06:53 - because the head never moves
06:54 - uh wait what oh did it crop it it did
06:58 - crop it oh no
06:59 - uh well we have to find someone that
07:01 - doesn't move I guess maybe just maybe
07:03 - let's just put it on the head I'll I'll
07:05 - take care of the first one uh
07:07 - C Bam Bam
07:11 - wait the head starts to move what
07:13 - two three four
07:17 - face on the head place on the head okay
07:21 - uh the first one a bit worried though
07:23 - because the center of origin is
07:24 - different from the rest
07:26 - we could just use your hand to guide
07:27 - ourselves so all right we're gonna press
07:29 - number one we're gonna put our hand on
07:31 - the center of origin go back to this one
07:33 - and our hands right here so we're gonna
07:34 - boom like that so that's our Center
07:36 - origin we have to make sure they're on
07:38 - the same spot
07:40 - or else it won't look the same
07:43 - all right uh so once you have this we're
07:46 - gonna go set click on default speed to
07:48 - zero and then we should be okay let's
07:51 - exit that all right let's shrink it down
07:55 - uh we can just change to make sure it's
07:57 - okay one
08:00 - did it like change spots
08:03 - okay kind of did what if I just said on
08:05 - the head
08:06 - as if I'm doing it fresh so I'm a bit
08:09 - confused oh yeah this is correct send
08:11 - the head guys yeah we
08:14 - or Perfect all right we're good we're
08:16 - good now we're gonna set this somewhere
08:18 - like maybe around here all right so just
08:21 - sit on the head that's it set it on the
08:23 - head uh once you're done sending
08:25 - everything on the head we're gonna press
08:27 - add on image points right here we're
08:29 - gonna add image point one and we're
08:30 - going to put it on the ball so when it
08:33 - released uh when it like shoots the
08:34 - basketball the basketball is going to
08:36 - come from the actual basketball not like
08:38 - somewhere else so we're gonna put it
08:39 - right here and try to make try to do
08:42 - your best to put in the center but it's
08:43 - if it's not perfect that's fine do this
08:45 - for every single frame so next frame
08:47 - press add press place
08:51 - add Place add
08:56 - Place perfect uh you can take your time
08:58 - you can pause the video if you are if
09:00 - I'm going too fast or something but
09:02 - anyways once you're done with that close
09:03 - it out
09:04 - and now I have our player uh now the
09:06 - other thing we need is our hoop let me
09:09 - just increase the player size a little
09:10 - bit
09:11 - yeah it looks that's fine I think it's
09:13 - like this all right again you can make
09:14 - your own if you want uh this is I know
09:16 - it looks bad but yeah that's mine so
09:19 - we're gonna add another hoop now add
09:20 - Sprite oop Place load an image go to pop
09:24 - props grab hoop I did not mean to set
09:27 - the center of origin like that Holy I'm
09:29 - sorry okay hold on we can reset uh quick
09:32 - assign the middle all right
09:34 - this one's the center of origin is not
09:36 - important but I just want it to be the
09:37 - middle all right perfect and once you
09:39 - have this we're just going to place it
09:41 - somewhere like
09:43 - here
09:45 - make sure this on the side because when
09:46 - we go up and down it looks a lot natural
09:48 - I mean a lot more natural
09:50 - um so yeah I think I'll place it here
09:53 - that looks good and we're gonna also go
09:55 - into the said collagen polygon right
09:57 - here you can see it's very messy we're
10:00 - gonna grab this and we're gonna place it
10:02 - on the little edges by the way not the
10:04 - not this not the rim we're gonna play
10:06 - something else for that but we're just
10:07 - going to use this little backboard right
10:09 - here just place on the Blackboard our
10:11 - backboard
10:13 - all right the more detailed the better
10:15 - because we do have extra polygon
10:17 - Checkers so
10:19 - the more detail to better
10:21 - like so bam so we just need the
10:25 - backboard right here so it can bounce
10:26 - off into it all right perfect once
10:28 - you're done like this close it up and
10:30 - we're gonna apply Behavior our first
10:32 - Behavior we're going to add uh we're
10:33 - gonna put physics inside physics
10:37 - and there uh now how do we uh I think
10:40 - like a basketball board should be like
10:42 - you know somewhat like not that elastic
10:44 - so we're gonna change our elasticity to
10:46 - 0.1 because it still bounces off the
10:48 - backboard but it's like not the most
10:50 - like elastic thing in the world so yeah
10:52 - I think 0.1 is pretty good uh immovable
10:54 - make sure to uh say yes because if it's
10:57 - not watch watch every time movable this
11:00 - is gonna happen
11:02 - we and it falls down right we have to
11:04 - make it immovable so
11:05 - yes all right once you're done like this
11:07 - let's make sure it's okay
11:10 - uh perfect uh and maybe increase this a
11:13 - little bit increase this a little bit
11:14 - all right that should be good and once
11:16 - you have this we're going to add we're
11:18 - gonna click save as actually file save
11:20 - as single file
11:23 - basketball V2 like so make sure to save
11:26 - inversions because if there's something
11:28 - went wrong you could go back and do it
11:30 - again go back to like a different
11:31 - version
11:32 - uh so we're gonna insert another object
11:34 - this one's gonna be our score
11:36 - boom uh I'm gonna set it as impact
11:39 - because I feel like impact is the most
11:40 - like game font so impact I'm gonna set
11:44 - it at 48 uh enter we're gonna have a
11:47 - score and time in the same one so we're
11:48 - gonna just type it out and score they
11:50 - got 10 slash oh but that's I have like a
11:54 - was it an rk50 something 61 so it's I
11:58 - have to switch between the control and
12:00 - the slash key it's kind of confusing but
12:03 - yeah so score 10 timer
12:06 - uh let's say 30. all right we're gonna
12:09 - increase to make it make sure it looks
12:11 - nice all right the reason we're doing
12:12 - this is to see where the position is so
12:14 - it looks the best
12:16 - uh I think it looks good here yeah it
12:18 - looks good all right so once you have
12:20 - all our mechanics or game things done
12:23 - we're gonna add in a particle this is
12:27 - just fancy little effects you know when
12:29 - like
12:30 - when we go through the basket there's
12:31 - gonna be a little splash or particle
12:33 - animation uh we're gonna Press On
12:37 - brush this really depends if you want a
12:39 - square or like a circle you could have
12:41 - any shape really um I think I'll just
12:43 - draw a star for this one be a little bit
12:45 - more be a little bit more creative uh so
12:48 - let me grab a star
12:50 - one two three four five horrible star
12:53 - but you can't really notice in a
12:54 - particle so you don't have to make it
12:56 - perfect just uh noticeable I guess all
12:59 - right and now we're gonna pour in the
13:01 - the gaps like so I'm just got and we've
13:03 - got our star uh we can just copy it like
13:05 - this perfect all right so this is our
13:07 - particle right here we're gonna tilt it
13:09 - down
13:10 - like so so when it goes like goes like
13:12 - push this way and we're gonna set our
13:14 - spray coin to around 100 to make it
13:16 - spray a little wider uh one shot instead
13:19 - of continuous
13:20 - speed 200 I think it's fine size you're
13:23 - gonna set to 10 make a little smaller
13:24 - opacity Maybe 80. uh
13:28 - uh yeah I think that's fine and we're
13:30 - gonna set a whole bit of different
13:30 - layers well this is layer zero right
13:32 - let's rename this to game layer
13:34 - game layer
13:36 - all right so we're gonna name our layers
13:37 - now we're gonna name this a hoop layer
13:39 - as well because you know our hoop needs
13:41 - to always stay on top so we're gonna
13:42 - move this to who player
13:45 - let's move to layer hoop all right but
13:47 - now we're gonna lock hoop so we can go
13:49 - through the hoop all right so once we
13:51 - have like something like this uh we have
13:53 - our star we can test it out see how it
13:54 - looks
13:55 - yeah it's fine but I don't think it's
13:58 - perfect so I think we need our uh what
14:02 - is it called
14:03 - size to be a little bit bigger 20 maybe
14:06 - let's try 20. is it more noticeable I
14:09 - wanted I want them to notice a star if
14:10 - it says something like this it's fine
14:12 - just press ok
14:13 - uh it's it's a bit too packed now I
14:16 - guess it's maybe 15 so the speed to like
14:18 - 250. uh LD I'll decrease the
14:22 - acceleration or increase I guess
14:25 - and then boom let's check that
14:29 - uh uh let me see what if I move this up
14:32 - a little bit more
14:32 - [Music]
14:34 - bam oh that looks nice all right that's
14:36 - pretty good uh so yeah that should be
14:38 - okay and we're gonna set oops we're
14:40 - gonna on we're gonna unblock our hoop
14:44 - because I forgot we have to sail a bit
14:45 - more we're gonna set another we're gonna
14:47 - set an origin point for this as well
14:48 - image point because this is for the
14:50 - particle itself where it needs to come
14:52 - out of I think somewhere around here is
14:54 - pretty good so this is where the
14:55 - particle is gonna explode from right
14:57 - there that looks good let's do that out
14:59 - all right once we have this we're going
15:01 - to add another Behavior we're going to
15:03 - add sine
15:08 - this basically allows it to move up and
15:10 - down uh and we're gonna set it as
15:12 - inactive from the start yes no active
15:15 - and start no a movement we're gonna say
15:17 - it's vertical
15:18 - and yeah we should be able to lock it
15:21 - again there you go perfect uh once you
15:23 - have this we're going to grab this toss
15:25 - it out a little bit so they don't see it
15:27 - from the start all right uh what else do
15:30 - we need oh we need our we need our
15:33 - border so the rim right here to make
15:35 - these two like you know not able to go
15:38 - right through this part which is not
15:39 - like a basketball unlike real life
15:41 - you're gonna add Sprite we're gonna add
15:42 - a border
15:44 - like so this just invisible layer hoop
15:46 - is locked oh wait shoot I mean to spawn
15:49 - some game layer uh let me delete border
15:52 - all right make sure to press game layer
15:54 - okay because then this will spawn in
15:56 - game layer order
15:59 - like so and we're gonna pour in any
16:02 - color of your choice because nobody's
16:04 - gonna see it anyways I'm gonna plug and
16:06 - play with green
16:07 - and now we're gonna just make it a
16:09 - little bit thinner
16:11 - like so we're gonna tilt it a little bit
16:15 - like so we're gonna put it like here
16:19 - okay I think that looks nice just try to
16:21 - trace the edge of it all right we're
16:23 - gonna add a behavior we're gonna add
16:25 - this another physics
16:27 - all right physics movable yes elasticity
16:31 - it's a rim so it should bounce a little
16:33 - bit so I don't think I'm gonna change
16:34 - anything uh and we're gonna add another
16:36 - one sign so it'll move along with the
16:38 - hoop when it gets to move uh same thing
16:40 - here just set active from the start no
16:42 - horizontal vertical uh and we're just
16:45 - going to duplicate this control C
16:47 - control V bam just gonna put on this
16:49 - side as well
16:51 - like so tilt it a little bit and there
16:55 - perfect so that should be all good and
16:59 - now once we have our border oh wait I
17:01 - almost forgot we had to set it's
17:02 - invisible or else they will see it
17:04 - invisible invisible
17:06 - all right we have our border now we have
17:08 - to have our Checker the thing that
17:10 - checks if you know the ball went in the
17:11 - hoop or not so let's add that into new
17:13 - objects right we're gonna just Checker
17:16 - not like the game like the little
17:17 - Checker thingy any color I'm going to go
17:20 - over her yellow because that represents
17:22 - checking to me for some reason
17:24 - yellow paste that right here
17:28 - a little bit like that
17:31 - like so
17:33 - all right there that's our Checker
17:36 - um
17:36 - but make sure it goes the entire hoop
17:39 - because just in case like there's a robe
17:42 - ball it actually only went through this
17:43 - way like pretend you have like a square
17:44 - it might have gone through this uh Gap
17:47 - without you know us checking for it so
17:48 - to be safe just expand the entire thing
17:50 - all right once you have Checker we're
17:52 - gonna add in uh one Behavior we're gonna
17:54 - add in sign
17:56 - like so and again set everything to uh
18:00 - everything else so no vertical I mean
18:02 - not accurate to start vertical and yeah
18:04 - that's it
18:05 - right uh physically immobile yes okay
18:08 - and that's it uh so now to have
18:10 - everything in you know in place we're
18:13 - gonna start coding so we're gonna add in
18:15 - keyboard and touch uh these are the two
18:20 - things that use to control and interact
18:21 - with the game so once we have this we're
18:23 - gonna go into our game event add event
18:26 - uh we're gonna do unstarted layout
18:30 - on Startup layout like so we're going to
18:32 - reset our all our variables so we're
18:33 - going to add three variables here we're
18:35 - gonna add a timer
18:37 - really important we're going to add a
18:39 - time shoot so this is when the player
18:41 - shoots is going to time it and we're
18:43 - also going to add a score
18:46 - once you have this uh is there anything
18:48 - else we need I feel like there's one
18:50 - thing I'm missing I'm not sure though
18:52 - um
18:53 - oh I got it the speed of the board so
18:56 - we're at speed as well
18:58 - okay so we're gonna first add set value
19:01 - to score at zero because you know when
19:03 - they start you have to add zero uh we're
19:05 - gonna set timer to 30.
19:08 - because this is how much time you want
19:10 - you can add or decrease this time up to
19:12 - you uh we're gonna add we're gonna set
19:14 - time shoot
19:16 - times true to zero
19:18 - we're also going to uh set the speed to
19:22 - 5. so in construct 2 house speed is
19:25 - measured is kind of confusing so it's
19:27 - measured in Period uh basically what you
19:30 - do is the the longer your period it's
19:33 - basically I think how many seconds uh
19:35 - your thing needs to travel down and up
19:37 - so pretend that ours is going down and
19:39 - up like this right so up here would be
19:41 - like 10 a period of five seconds would
19:42 - be one two three four five but appeared
19:46 - once I can be like one like that so it's
19:49 - a little short of the period I mean the
19:51 - less the period the lot the faster it is
19:53 - hopefully that makes sense so that would
19:55 - be like the maximum the slowest we're
19:57 - going to uh we're gonna give so five is
20:00 - the slowest so we're gonna set us five
20:02 - you could sell this different again um
20:04 - but I'm just gonna put it as five
20:05 - because it seems like a good number
20:06 - all right once we've done this uh oh
20:09 - wait I almost forgot we need a
20:11 - basketball that's pretty important
20:13 - basketball
20:17 - like so and we're gonna place it here oh
20:20 - wait uh guys I'm sorry I forgot to put
20:23 - the basketball inside of the
20:25 - prop thingy but uh I'll I will put that
20:28 - there when you download it but for me
20:30 - right now I forgot to put that in there
20:31 - so I'm just gonna go grab it from my
20:33 - this file really quickly
20:35 - basketball please all right okay uh
20:38 - thank you
20:39 - uh see you again tomorrow
20:42 - uh we're gonna put this right in there
20:44 - boom we have our basketball okay uh I
20:48 - promise this will be in there when you
20:49 - get it um all right so let's delete our
20:51 - basketball really quickly
20:54 - delete all right and now we have our
20:57 - ball we're just gonna place it off to
20:59 - the side like right here make sure the
21:01 - sides are the same if they're not just
21:02 - change it a little bit because when you
21:04 - increase or decrease your player
21:05 - basketball might change so make sure
21:07 - they look around the same size I think
21:09 - that's pretty good all right so once we
21:11 - have our basketball and everything we're
21:12 - gonna set some behaviors to our
21:14 - basketball let me delete this first
21:16 - all right we're gonna set as uh physics
21:19 - so
21:20 - physics and we're just gonna leave
21:23 - immovable no yeah that's it right yeah
21:27 - okay that's it so we have our basketball
21:29 - we have everything now let's go code
21:31 - finally oh wait we still got one more
21:34 - thing we need our um
21:37 - what's it called we need our shooter
21:39 - where the player is going to aimp you
21:41 - shoot it's called the shoot object
21:44 - a bit confusing but basically when in
21:46 - construct 2 uh when the player shoots or
21:49 - like something sends music two or
21:52 - something it needs like an object to
21:54 - send it towards so we're gonna have this
21:55 - little blue box floating up and down
21:58 - like around this part of the goal and
22:00 - the players the the program is going to
22:02 - design when the player shoots to try to
22:04 - aim towards this blue box which will uh
22:07 - which will allow the ball to pass it and
22:09 - enter the goal if that makes sense but
22:11 - we're gonna basically have a little
22:12 - aimer thingy and we're gonna make it
22:14 - invisible so yeah it's kind of like lock
22:16 - base as well so makes it more fun
22:18 - uh let's grab our mint color paste that
22:21 - in there decrease this
22:23 - and this is gonna go up and down right
22:24 - here so when the ball shoots it's gonna
22:26 - try the best it's to aim towards this it
22:28 - pretends up here but we don't set enough
22:30 - power for it to go directly like this
22:32 - right we're gonna set like a little bit
22:33 - of power so it goes like this and maybe
22:35 - maybe it doesn't touch and maybe it goes
22:37 - in like this so yeah that's basically
22:39 - the uh what's this blue box used for and
22:42 - we're gonna name this to shoot object
22:44 - that's pretty good name a behavior to
22:46 - sign
22:47 - now this really depends on how difficult
22:50 - you want your game to be if you want it
22:51 - to be super difficult uh make sure it
22:53 - says vertical uh if you want it to be
22:54 - super typical difficult we're going to
22:56 - move it a lot but if you want it you
22:58 - know moderate we just move around this
23:00 - much so I think I'll have it like a
23:02 - random medium so also appear to two
23:04 - magnitude to maybe 35
23:06 - all right let's see how it looks
23:08 - yeah this should be okay and then when
23:10 - the player shoots it goes like that you
23:12 - could change later if you want but I
23:13 - think we'll leave like that for now okay
23:15 - and now we're gonna set this as
23:17 - invisible so they don't see it
23:19 - bam perfect we should have everything we
23:21 - need now probably if if something you're
23:23 - missing I'll just go do it uh when the
23:25 - time comes
23:26 - all right so once we have everything in
23:28 - place we're now going to add uh we're
23:31 - gonna add probably every X seconds 10 of
23:35 - every one second we're going to subtract
23:39 - from our
23:41 - uh our timer by one so this way it's
23:44 - starting to count down and then once we
23:46 - do this we're gonna do add sub event
23:50 - compare variable if timer is less or
23:54 - equal to zero we're gonna have it
23:56 - restart layouts obviously we're gonna
23:57 - have it teleport us to the end uh after
24:00 - but I haven't created the layout the
24:01 - layer oh my God the layout yet so I'm
24:04 - just going to say go to layout game like
24:06 - so all right once we're done like this
24:08 - uh we should be okay uh for the timer
24:11 - and we're also going to add every X SEC
24:14 - every tick tick tick tick tick every
24:16 - tick we're gonna do s uh text
24:20 - set text
24:22 - there's no said text what
24:25 - there must be a set text right
24:27 - oh did I do it in here okay
24:30 - oh I didn't bro set text
24:34 - perfect uh we're gonna say score colon
24:37 - space and or like the and sign we're
24:41 - gonna do score like so
24:44 - uh and
24:47 - uh make sure to add quotations again
24:49 - slash
24:50 - this is to add the timer
24:53 - like so and timer
24:57 - it's basically like a con like uh
24:59 - contending a string in Python score and
25:01 - score and timer and timer except for
25:03 - this time you don't have to change every
25:05 - like every single variable the family
25:07 - root of the variable to match each other
25:10 - for example this is integer this is a
25:12 - string we don't have to change it we
25:13 - just put and
25:14 - I think you should learn um but anyways
25:16 - that's it press done uh we could just
25:19 - test it out so we can add system
25:21 - add to score by one in every ten every
25:24 - one second so it should go up every one
25:26 - second
25:27 - perfect so it goes down it goes up uh I
25:31 - need to add a space here so yeah let's
25:33 - go edit that so everything looks fine
25:35 - let me delete that really quickly I'm
25:37 - gonna add a little space here
25:39 - like so make it look a little bit more
25:40 - nicer for Aesthetics
25:42 - and that's it for our text uh once our
25:45 - we have our text done we're going to
25:46 - move on to our hard part which is to get
25:48 - the player to shoot so we're going to
25:49 - add event
25:50 - uh keyboard
25:53 - key is down you could choose any key I'm
25:56 - going to choose spacebar
25:57 - when space is down uh
26:00 - and we're gonna add a condition we're
26:03 - gonna add for every
26:06 - this is how much how fast you want the
26:10 - the frame to move for some people it
26:12 - might be like really fast which is going
26:13 - to make the game harder some people
26:14 - might make it slower which is gonna make
26:16 - the game easier but at the same time
26:17 - they'll not get as like if pretend they
26:20 - score 100 of the time right you're not
26:22 - gonna get as much points as somebody who
26:23 - like does it really really fast so it
26:25 - really depends but for me I'm gonna sit
26:27 - at 0.4 you can copy me or or uh you can
26:29 - test on your own I feel like 0.4 is a
26:31 - pretty good middle uh so once you have
26:34 - 0.4 we're going to say system add to
26:38 - time shoot by one
26:40 - and what time shoot does is it helps us
26:43 - calculate our uh our force and also sets
26:46 - the frame for us as well so it's pretty
26:48 - important uh once we add one to
26:50 - timeshare there's a bunch of things we
26:51 - have to do for example player we're
26:53 - gonna set frame to time shoot
26:56 - like so done so this way if we were to
27:00 - test this out now the player should be
27:01 - able to like there you go perfect but
27:03 - now it's gonna be stuck here right so it
27:06 - will follow time shoot so if you hold it
27:08 - temperature will go up 0.4 seconds it
27:10 - will add play the animation uh and let's
27:12 - make this invisible okay that's that's a
27:14 - pretty good thing let me lock hooplier
27:16 - first all right let me make this
27:18 - invisible
27:19 - bye bye
27:21 - uh now let's go into
27:23 - add action so once you have our
27:25 - animation done we now need two oh yeah
27:29 - do our four so pretend we let the
27:31 - spacebar go what do we do right so I
27:34 - want to set animation to time shoot and
27:36 - now let's go add event
27:38 - keyboard uh
27:40 - on key release no we're just gonna
27:44 - control C control V this and then from
27:46 - here we're gonna do something called
27:47 - inverting so we're gonna do we're delete
27:50 - this
27:51 - actually we can change this really
27:53 - quickly compare variable change every
27:55 - four seconds 0.4 seconds to compare
27:56 - variable time shoot is uh greater than
28:01 - one right one or zero greater than zero
28:04 - greater than zero
28:06 - space is down let's invert this space is
28:09 - not down but timesheet is greater than
28:11 - zero we're going to make it shoot right
28:13 - so we're going to make it shoot first
28:15 - or delete these two
28:16 - uh uh all right add action player
28:21 - uh
28:23 - no we're going to do system system
28:26 - create object this where it gets a
28:28 - little confusing ball
28:30 - X we want to set as player dot image
28:35 - point
28:37 - image point x and parentheses one like
28:42 - this all right when you're copying
28:43 - pastes for y but instead of X we're
28:45 - going to change it to Y like so and once
28:47 - you have this we should be okay to
28:49 - create the balls
28:51 - um if we were to play now how would
28:52 - happen is there's gonna be a trail of
28:53 - balls I'm pretty sure
28:54 - yeah
28:56 - exactly um because now it creates the
28:59 - ball but at the same time the ball has
29:00 - physics so it's going to create a bunch
29:01 - of them
29:03 - um and we're gonna have to reset
29:04 - timestream to do it one time as well
29:06 - we're gonna add action we're gonna set
29:08 - ball set
29:09 - force or Force
29:13 - apply Force towards a position
29:16 - horse is gonna be time shoot this is an
29:19 - algorithm that I made I'm not sure if
29:20 - it's the best algorithm but it it's it
29:23 - works a little bit um so we're gonna set
29:24 - Time Force time shoot which is our
29:26 - variable int
29:28 - and we're gonna do int random
29:33 - like so inch random
29:35 - from where to where so we're gonna set
29:37 - as
29:38 - 750 or let's do 700 700 to 850 like so
29:43 - and we're going to close out the
29:44 - parentheses there you go it should be
29:46 - perfect now uh let's press
29:49 - done okay I'm missing what am I missing
29:53 - oh I need another all right I need
29:56 - another parentheses
29:57 - um and now once we have our Force we're
29:59 - gonna do our X and our y so uh where
30:02 - we're going to aim it at this is what
30:03 - the shoot object comes into so again
30:06 - shoot object dot X
30:08 - copy paste shoot object dot y there you
30:12 - go and that's basically going to allow
30:14 - us to shoot at the object but I saw if I
30:17 - already play this now there's going to
30:19 - be a bunch of balls just streaming
30:20 - towards the shoot object so we're gonna
30:22 - have to cancel this condition out which
30:24 - means we're going to set our time Shoot
30:26 - To Zero
30:28 - there you go and we're gonna set our
30:29 - animation back to typescript so yeah
30:31 - this should be A-Okay let's try it out
30:35 - bam there you go looks a lot nicer you
30:39 - can actually score some hoops now
30:40 - actually like so
30:43 - there you go all right and you can
30:44 - adjust the force depending on if it's
30:46 - too hard or too easy I think it's
30:48 - perfect so I'm going to leave it like
30:49 - this
30:50 - okay uh once you're done with this we're
30:52 - going to now add an event in order to
30:54 - add the score because our score is at
30:56 - zero and it doesn't really look that
30:57 - good so let's go system
30:59 - uh actually let's go uh where is it ball
31:03 - is
31:05 - overlapping another object we're gonna
31:08 - choose checker
31:10 - done add Action System add to score by
31:14 - one okay and we're also going to click
31:16 - right here click over here add add a
31:19 - condition we're gonna do trigger one so
31:21 - it doesn't add a score rapidly quicker
31:23 - once like so perfect uh once you have
31:26 - something like this we're going to test
31:28 - it out let's see if our score goes up
31:32 - okay that was pathetic throw there you
31:35 - go got a one
31:36 - two
31:38 - ah no or if they're harder
31:41 - harder boom there you go again it's a
31:45 - pretty fun game so yeah
31:47 - uh so we now actually got a working game
31:50 - so if you just want to leave like this
31:52 - you can this ball but let's I'm gonna
31:54 - take another level so once you have uh
31:56 - our scoring system we're gonna add
31:59 - uh we're gonna add our particles now my
32:01 - voice really hurts for some reason
32:02 - system create object
32:06 - create object we're going to create our
32:08 - particle
32:09 - and now this is where image Point comes
32:11 - into play so we're going to add our hoop
32:14 - Dot
32:16 - image point
32:18 - x one just like before
32:21 - copy oops copy everything paste it
32:23 - enrich it to y
32:25 - EP perfect and now we should be done
32:27 - like so uh so every time we do it there
32:29 - should be a little dust of Stars perfect
32:33 - that looks pretty nice
32:35 - you can even add sound effects if you
32:36 - want to but I'm a bit too lazy so I'm
32:38 - not oh no that's too far
32:40 - like so pretty good uh now when the ball
32:44 - Falls right it's actually not going to
32:46 - stop it's gonna like it goes in the hoop
32:48 - it's just gonna keep going down into the
32:50 - void into the abyss if we don't stop it
32:52 - so an easy way to stop that is to just
32:54 - say if ball outside of layout destroy
32:56 - but you'll see why I didn't do that in
32:58 - my previous program
33:00 - um because there's some reasons that you
33:02 - know it doesn't look good but we can
33:04 - also do it because it's a lot easier so
33:06 - add event ball if outside layout where
33:09 - is that
33:10 - let me feed him in position
33:12 - position as outside layout we're going
33:14 - to add ball destroy
33:17 - destroy
33:18 - all right so let's see how this works
33:21 - I'm just gonna shoot it really really
33:24 - really far
33:26 - uh yeah well it doesn't see that if it
33:28 - destroys or not but uh
33:31 - yeah basically that's it like so so it
33:33 - destroys the boss it doesn't keep going
33:34 - on for Infinity uh yeah that's it
33:36 - sometimes I do it the other way because
33:38 - it could have some potential bugs and
33:41 - errors if we're going to take this a
33:42 - step further but this is like basically
33:44 - the same thing so it doesn't really
33:46 - matter so yeah let's go back to our code
33:48 - all right now that we have our mechanics
33:50 - down uh what we need to do is we need
33:52 - our scoreboard to move right because
33:54 - that's a big part of our program so
33:56 - let's do add event system compare
33:59 - variable our uh score is greater or
34:03 - equal to
34:05 - five
34:07 - add Action System wait no no uh hoop set
34:11 - here
34:12 - set active
34:15 - like so as active all right perfect
34:17 - we're gonna duplicate this three times
34:19 - one two three and we're gonna replace
34:20 - our object or border and for Checker so
34:24 - this way after three times it's gonna
34:26 - move all in sync so it's gonna be all
34:29 - together
34:30 - I'm gonna add another action we're gonna
34:31 - set this as speed so set value no
34:34 - actually we're going to do a set value
34:37 - of
34:38 - speed to int random it will be int it
34:42 - because if we do random it could be a
34:44 - float which we don't want so we're gonna
34:46 - do int random
34:48 - uh let's say was it time
34:52 - speed
34:54 - no no we're going to do in random from
34:56 - one two five
35:00 - perfect
35:01 - press ok
35:03 - all right
35:05 - uh instead of doing this every time it
35:07 - says like this we're gonna do this every
35:09 - second so we're gonna place it up here
35:11 - every one second like so
35:14 - uh oh we actually gotta have another
35:15 - condition so we're gonna add system
35:17 - every one second
35:20 - every one second we're gonna grab this
35:22 - downward place it down here every one
35:24 - second we're gonna add a condition this
35:26 - condition basically says uh if our point
35:28 - is over so we're gonna say
35:31 - compare variable if score is greater
35:35 - than up to five
35:37 - like so ah there you go so this way it
35:40 - now works pretty well we're gonna place
35:42 - it on top of score now we're going to
35:45 - set our hoop and everything so that it
35:47 - goes up and down
35:49 - sign set period as speed
35:55 - so again one two three one two three oh
35:58 - that's a bit too much that's four we're
35:59 - gonna replace your object with border
36:01 - and then checker
36:03 - perfect and uh do we need anything else
36:06 - after this or is that it
36:09 - um let's see
36:13 - one two three uh yes okay come on come
36:16 - on let's get five let's get five again
36:18 - you can adjust the score so like you can
36:19 - if it's too easy you can make it like if
36:21 - a score is ten
36:23 - but it's pretty challenging for me oh no
36:25 - all right if the score is like 10 then
36:27 - move there you go it starts to move oh
36:30 - please no
36:31 - no
36:33 - right there perfect nice all right bam
36:36 - nope not slower as you can see now it's
36:38 - faster so it makes the player really
36:40 - confused but it looks really clean too
36:43 - ah and then resets the entire thing
36:45 - after 30 seconds so yeah that is our
36:47 - game as of now I think it's pretty
36:49 - polished pretty nice
36:51 - um all right so let's say this as
36:53 - version three make sure to save or else
36:55 - a crash sometimes to this as version
36:57 - three like so perfect uh once you have
37:00 - our game page done we're gonna design
37:02 - our ending page now so we're gonna add
37:04 - add layout
37:06 - add event sheet we're getting this uh
37:09 - end or let's say finish
37:13 - like so rename the event sheet to finish
37:17 - e for the
37:20 - event sheet finish event all right now
37:23 - once you have this we're just gonna
37:24 - again copy the window size
37:27 - paste and layout size all right perfect
37:30 - and what I like to do is just make
37:32 - everything look kind of the same so I'm
37:33 - going to grab the hoop
37:34 - grab this guy grab the floor
37:37 - all right we're gonna put into finish
37:39 - like so it doesn't matter where we put
37:40 - it first uh we're just gonna put it
37:42 - somewhere control see the hoop haste in
37:44 - here as well all right and now we're
37:46 - just gonna go grab the position from
37:48 - here to make everything look the same
37:49 - grab this position and go paste it in
37:52 - here
37:53 - oh wait what
37:55 - did I already put the position
37:57 - control C go finish
38:00 - bam
38:03 - what wait hold on I'm getting confused
38:05 - uh grab this position
38:08 - go to finish
38:10 - with no way they have the same position
38:12 - oh no they don't yeah there you go
38:13 - perfect we're gonna grab our player as
38:15 - well grab the position of the player go
38:17 - to finish
38:18 - equal V that was our hoop
38:21 - grab hoop grab the position
38:24 - go to finish paste it right there so now
38:27 - we should have an identical page as the
38:29 - game and instead of having a big like
38:31 - you know text right here we're gonna
38:33 - rename this first to make not get
38:34 - confused this is stats
38:36 - stats all right now we're going to
38:38 - insert a new object we're going to enter
38:39 - text uh we're gonna say congrats all
38:43 - right you got
38:45 - let's say 15 points 15 points or let's
38:48 - say score not got all right and we're
38:50 - going to change the font to again impact
38:52 - because why not impact is a great font
38:55 - whereas 48 is fine oh what does that
38:58 - mean assertion reference to memory the
39:00 - memory could not be written and it will
39:02 - crash watch
39:03 - there you go a crash but
39:06 - as I said earlier that's why we saved
39:08 - right uh let's let me close this really
39:10 - quickly all right so it crashed but
39:13 - luckily we were really you know good at
39:16 - saving everything so let's go over
39:18 - basketball again construct 2 basketball
39:21 - code and open our last one
39:24 - as if nothing ever happened we just have
39:26 - to design our uh
39:28 - end page again but yeah that's basically
39:30 - it nothing happened so let's rename our
39:32 - texting to stats
39:35 - okay sometimes when you edit the fonts
39:38 - and stuff it kind of glitches out and
39:40 - eventually we're going to name this
39:41 - again
39:43 - finish
39:45 - name this again as finish
39:49 - finish okay
39:51 - double click all right finish and now
39:54 - we're going to
39:55 - grab our
39:57 - window size layout size paste it in like
40:01 - so and we're going to do the same thing
40:03 - for all this so grab our player
40:06 - Ctrl C I'll control see this as well
40:08 - control C Ctrl V
40:10 - rechange the uh the the position
40:14 - and Bam
40:16 - bam
40:18 - bam
40:20 - oops
40:22 - Bam Bam Bam
40:24 - bam
40:25 - and we're gonna get our hoop so coffee
40:27 - hoop paste hoop and now we're gonna grab
40:30 - where the hoop is position and
40:34 - paste it right in
40:36 - perfect so once we have our uh this
40:39 - thing back again we're gonna quickly
40:40 - save it now so save as basketball
40:42 - version four before we edit our uh our
40:45 - text grab our text in we're gonna name
40:48 - this into score final
40:51 - and we're gonna set it to you scored
40:54 - 15 points I don't know why I like 15 too
40:56 - much but 15. all right we're going to
40:58 - set it to impact
41:00 - impact and we're going to set it to 48
41:03 - okay
41:05 - it crashed again are you kidding me what
41:08 - happened the instructions at zero
41:10 - reference memory the memory could not be
41:12 - written
41:13 - oh it's a bit buggy but it's fine we
41:15 - have a version four just open it back up
41:17 - uh so it seems like maybe we can't do
41:20 - our
41:21 - our impact bot so let's just set this to
41:23 - score final and let's just set to a
41:25 - different font then
41:26 - you scored
41:29 - you scored 15 points
41:34 - and we're gonna set it to like
41:37 - uh let's say
41:39 - but font also looks nice in the game
41:41 - bit do we have like an 8-bit font Maybe
41:44 - 8-bit to have one I remember I had one
41:47 - didn't I Minecraft right yeah Minecraft
41:50 - this one uh let's set as 48.
41:54 - oh it's not supported or is it supported
41:56 - please say support it no it's not
41:58 - supported dang it uh Minecraft Tia
42:01 - not supported uh well let's find
42:03 - something else shall we
42:05 - uh let's press enter
42:06 - on my back
42:08 - um
42:10 - what looks nice oh wait this one's small
42:12 - fonts is it supported please say it's
42:14 - not it's not supported are you kidding
42:16 - me
42:17 - uh
42:19 - what looks nice that's the good in the
42:22 - game
42:24 - [Music]
42:25 - what if I just go with this classic
42:27 - aerial that's pretty boring me right
42:30 - Latin looks kind of like rip off impact
42:34 - I don't know why I can't do impact uh uh
42:37 - Min Matt's wench wheeler probably not
42:40 - yellow sense that looks like impact uh
42:43 - looks kind of I guess all right anyways
42:45 - we'll just use Gil Sans not the exact
42:47 - same but
42:48 - best we got right now so you scored 15
42:51 - points make that look a little nicer I
42:53 - think I'll put it like
42:54 - uh I'll put it
42:56 - up down here maybe I'll change the font
42:58 - to make it look bigger
43:01 - all right
43:04 - like so I think that's fine
43:08 - I'm gonna have a redo button here all
43:09 - right once we have our text we're gonna
43:11 - go to our finish e we're gonna set
43:13 - system we're gonna do uh add event
43:17 - OnStar layup

43:50 - we'll be in our props thingy but in this
43:54 - case I didn't put it in there but when

43:57 - we're going to insert Sprite okay
43:58 - assistant I'll just have random like
44:01 - uh green button green button that says
44:03 - start and resize this 250 to say 200.
44:07 - that's the wrong way uh 300 by 200 now

44:37 - going to set as 2 magnitude maybe 35
44:38 - sounds fun nice let's change appears to
44:41 - three let's change a little smaller like

44:49 - um
44:50 - if I push that back it doesn't look
44:52 - natural anymore so
44:54 - what if I just leave it up here and like
44:56 - leave points here
44:58 - maybe they will put something in the
44:59 - middle I don't know but this sounds this
