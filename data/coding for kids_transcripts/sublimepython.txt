00:01 - hello my name is jemmy and today i'm
00:04 - going to be showing you
00:05 - three simple coding um features
00:08 - in python but today we're going to be
00:10 - doing something different
00:12 - we're going to be using sublime text as
00:15 - our um as our code editor
00:18 - so yeah if you're interested here's a
00:21 - video playing
00:23 - hello my name is jemmy and today i'm
00:25 - going to be showing you
00:26 - um another thing in python it is
00:30 - called sublime which is a python
00:33 - code editor it helps with our coding
00:37 - and i'm going to show you how to use it
00:39 - later on
00:40 - and how to download it so first of all
00:43 - you just search
00:44 - up well i'm using um subline three so
00:47 - just search up sub line
00:51 - text three like this
00:55 - click enter then go to the first link
00:58 - which says
00:59 - download sublime click it
01:02 - and then here there's just a bunch of
01:05 - uh like information about uh the program
01:10 - so there's this big button which is
01:12 - download click it
01:14 - and then uh wait no no sorry
01:18 - in here um you have different versions
01:21 - of it
01:21 - so right now i'm using a windows but if
01:24 - you're using a mac
01:25 - just go to os right here so if you're
01:28 - using a windows then what you do is you
01:30 - press
01:31 - windows like this and then if it
01:34 - downloads in here
01:35 - then you click open when
01:39 - open after it's done so just wait until
01:41 - the icon comes up like this
01:43 - and now we click open right now just
01:47 - click yes
01:48 - and uh you could take this or not
01:52 - click next and install
01:56 - then uh just click next and
02:00 - yeah you should be able to click install
02:03 - but since i already did
02:05 - um since i already installed it it
02:08 - like yeah it just pops up like that but
02:10 - yeah you should be on this page
02:13 - and yeah that's it so that's how to
02:16 - download it and after that you can
02:20 - have like a finish and then you would
02:22 - have
02:23 - if you search up in your uh desktop
02:27 - right here then just click open
02:28 - sublime and then it should bring you to
02:31 - like
02:31 - an empty page which is like something
02:34 - like this
02:35 - and just file save as
02:39 - go to anywhere you want to save it and
02:42 - then
02:42 - uh pretend you want to name it like test
02:46 - but don't forget to add dot p y which
02:49 - makes it
02:50 - um python related or else if you just
02:53 - save it as like test right
02:56 - then for example if you print
02:59 - wait no since i already see it does this
03:01 - it can't resave it so yeah
03:02 - just make sure to save it as dot cubot
03:05 - so i'll be seeing you later bye
03:08 - okay so now that you're back from
03:10 - downloading sublime
03:12 - i'm pretty sure i'm going to teach you
03:14 - three topics as i said before
03:16 - the for loop the while loop and how to
03:19 - communicate between sublime and excel
03:22 - so let's see first of all why don't we
03:26 - talk about the for loop so let me just
03:29 - comment the while loop real quick
03:32 - okay now the for loop uh
03:35 - is pretty simple if you want to test out
03:37 - yourself you can copy the code from me
03:40 - first of all make a variable that is a
03:42 - list
03:43 - and after that you're going to say for i
03:47 - i can be your change to anything really
03:49 - like for example
03:50 - um a e i o u anything short and simple
03:54 - after that you're going to say in range
03:56 - 1 to 11
03:57 - 1 to 11 is actually one two three four
03:59 - five six seven eight ten
04:01 - so if you want your end number to be ten
04:03 - then it should be eleven
04:04 - so basically the n number needs to be
04:07 - plus one so if you want your n number to
04:09 - be eleven it's twelve
04:10 - good idea okay now after that put a
04:13 - colon
04:14 - after the um this command right here
04:17 - and then you're going to say menu dot
04:19 - append
04:20 - and then parentheses i this is to add i
04:23 - into the menu list okay and then you
04:27 - can't
04:28 - see the results if you don't print it so
04:30 - click i mean
04:31 - right print menu now after you're done
04:34 - let's test out the result
04:36 - by clicking control b which is build
04:39 - it shows down here as you can see one
04:42 - two three four five six seven nine ten
04:45 - oh it's all lined up but if you want it
04:47 - to be 11 then you change it to 12 and
04:49 - click control b again
04:51 - so now we see that change from 10 to 11
04:54 - perfect so that is the for loop pretty
04:56 - simple right
04:57 - moving on to the while loop
05:01 - okay the while loop is
05:04 - kind of like the for loop really what
05:06 - you do is you make a variable
05:09 - okay and set that variable to one
05:12 - right now and then after that you say
05:14 - while count which is the variable's name
05:17 - um is less or equal to 10
05:20 - with this going to be repeating um until
05:23 - count is
05:24 - equal to 10. why no i mean until count
05:28 - count is greater than 10 then uh
05:31 - if it's still less or equal to then
05:33 - we're going to print account
05:35 - and then we're going to add one to count
05:36 - which is to increase it every time
05:39 - so it should be one uh nine one two
05:42 - three four five two given a ten just
05:43 - like
05:44 - for loop but instead of being in the
05:46 - list like this it's going to be straight
05:47 - down in a column
05:49 - so let's test this out ctrl b
05:52 - there you go one two three four five six
05:54 - seven nine ten
05:55 - now unlike the for loop the um while
05:58 - loop
05:58 - it doesn't the end number right here
06:00 - doesn't need to be one greater than so
06:03 - if you want to be 11 it's straight up 11
06:06 - so yeah you don't have to complicate
06:07 - yourself here we are 11.
06:09 - okay perfect so those are the two loops
06:12 - i was going to show you for today
06:14 - now i'm going to show you how to
06:16 - communicate between xl
06:18 - and sublime which is i mean hyphen in
06:20 - sublime
06:21 - which is kind of which is actually like
06:23 - decently interesting to me
06:25 - um in here as you can see
06:29 - article equal to open um this one
06:32 - is actually i have to show you something
06:35 - else first real quick
06:36 - and here you're going to create a thing
06:39 - called
06:39 - article dot txt not dot py
06:43 - um and then just grab a random text in
06:46 - oh i grabbed one about coronavirus above
06:48 - the pandemic
06:50 - and um how americans drugs um they
06:52 - inventing it
06:54 - and yeah so grab a random thing and you
06:56 - could be one word two words three words
06:58 - a whole paragraph a whole story doesn't
07:00 - matter so grab it in
07:03 - and um now we create another program
07:05 - called
07:06 - uh well it should be called excel dot py
07:10 - but for some reason i named it auto
07:12 - translate i don't know why
07:14 - okay after that uh you do article equal
07:17 - to
07:17 - open article.txt um comma
07:20 - and then uh quotation marks are which is
07:23 - to
07:24 - open this guy right here this tab um
07:28 - and after they open that we're going to
07:30 - say article
07:32 - equal to article.read which is to grab
07:34 - all this information in here
07:36 - and put it into this variable okay after
07:38 - we're done with that command then we're
07:40 - going to do article equal to
07:41 - article.split
07:43 - this is split each um each word into a
07:46 - different
07:47 - like section so yeah it's not split is
07:51 - to split like
07:52 - the into one word which is actually
07:54 - already so
07:56 - it's basically splitting the whole
07:57 - entire paragraph into
07:59 - like each word okay get what i mean
08:02 - okay after that we're going to print
08:04 - count
08:05 - um and then so this is this uh
08:09 - command is to print how much words are
08:12 - inside the article so len is the range
08:16 - of it
08:16 - and print count and then we say like 48
08:20 - 49 100
08:21 - etc okay after you're done with that
08:24 - this one you might need to
08:26 - for these you might need to like go into
08:29 - command prompt and do pip install
08:31 - open pi excel which is to insert
08:34 - like how do you call it um an extension
08:37 - really
08:38 - to for you to communicate with excel so
08:41 - after you're done with that
08:42 - uh you do from open high excel
08:46 - import workbook which is a code that
08:48 - they have in
08:49 - um openpixel and then these two
08:53 - are also some commands that you would
08:55 - need
08:56 - so yeah just copy these two down
08:57 - workbook equal to workbook
08:59 - parentheses sheet equal to workbook dot
09:01 - active yeah copy them down
09:03 - and then cheat dot append as we saw on
09:06 - in the for loop
09:07 - yeah append is to add to
09:10 - um something so this in this case we're
09:13 - going to add
09:14 - to excel so we're going to add article
09:17 - which
09:17 - right here is the each single words and
09:20 - we're going to add that
09:22 - after that we're going to save the um
09:25 - excel file as whatever you want and then
09:27 - dot xlsx
09:29 - so pretend like food dot
09:33 - xlsx remember to have this at the end
09:36 - because this is like
09:37 - the how you call it the last name of the
09:40 - file
09:40 - yeah so once you're done with this let's
09:42 - test it out real
09:44 - okay so we're going to rename this
09:45 - because since i already tested this
09:47 - to make sure it works i'm going to have
09:49 - to rename it so it doesn't
09:50 - um save on top of each other uh so
09:54 - how do i um dog okay
09:57 - let me just do coronavirus because it's
10:01 - uh what the topic is chrono virus
10:05 - okay so brilliant now let's control b
10:08 - for control
10:09 - build and there's 40 to 43
10:13 - words in this article and it finished in
10:16 - 0.5 seconds
10:17 - so now if you go into your um
10:21 - into the files that you have then it
10:24 - should
10:24 - be there so mines is
10:28 - uh where is it okay here and boom
10:32 - and here we are where is it
10:36 - well this is the hello world i tested so
10:39 - it needs to be here coronavirus there we
10:40 - go
10:41 - and you can see that it splits into it
10:44 - splits each word into its own column
10:46 - and yeah that's how to communicate
10:48 - between
10:49 - excel and python in sublime
10:52 - so see you later bye
