06:49 - know what um code it is
06:52 - so yeah um now i'm going to show you how
06:54 - to
06:55 - uh comment with multiple lines not only
06:57 - one line
06:59 - okay so like this okay
07:04 - okay so what you do is you put
07:08 - um three single quotes
07:11 - like this one two three and down here
07:14 - you put
07:16 - one two three nice and in the middle you
07:20 - can see like
07:23 - this is the
07:26 - code for
07:36 - there you go and um if you play it
07:43 - there hello and it won't show this or
07:46 - this because
07:47 - they're both comments and however
07:50 - if you pretend like you miss
07:54 - one quote like that it'll come up syntax
07:56 - or right here
07:58 - syntax error means that something is
08:00 - wrong with your code
08:01 - so how to fix this to go back and um
08:05 - it will actually like i think it does
08:07 - help you
08:08 - triple quote it yeah see um triple
08:12 - quoted it needs to be triple quote not
08:14 - on two
08:15 - so just add one more like so
08:19 - and whoops add one more
08:22 - and click play then there you go no more
08:25 - syntax work
08:27 - also if you're like a person like me and
08:28 - you don't like this messy
08:30 - stuff i gotta do it to click kill
08:32 - terminal
