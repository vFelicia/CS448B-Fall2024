00:00 - [Music]
00:11 - hello guys my name is um
00:17 - lists in python shell right now we're
00:20 - not in visual studios anymore
00:21 - we're in python shell you should be able
00:23 - to have it in your
00:25 - computer if you downloaded um in my
00:28 - first video about python how to set
00:30 - it up so if you search up
00:33 - python there should be um
00:37 - idli which is the shell so just click on
00:40 - it
00:41 - and it pops up like this and now you can
00:43 - start typing
00:45 - so lists is kind of like a writing
00:47 - construct too
00:48 - um you can delete stuff you can like
00:52 - um pull stuff from it and yeah you can
00:54 - do a bunch of stuff with list
00:56 - let's just see what it does first so
00:58 - first of all
00:59 - is to set the list right so let's
01:02 - pretend
01:03 - we have something like what do you
01:06 - keep in your um
01:10 - pretend closet okay so we're gonna set
01:13 - closet as a
01:14 - list so the closet list would be like
01:18 - this
01:19 - and then there's going to be what
01:21 - clothes yeah
01:24 - um what else books
01:27 - maybe if you like store them in behind
01:29 - the closet
01:31 - uh choose
01:35 - okay wait remember your single quotes
01:39 - shoes and what else
01:44 - toys toys
01:47 - like this and there you go that's
01:50 - now the closet has um is a list
01:54 - and it has clothes books choose and toys
01:57 - in it
01:58 - so what if we want to
02:01 - um add something to it so we would do
02:04 - like this
02:06 - uh closet
02:09 - [Music]
02:11 - dot append
02:14 - and then um put your thing into it so
02:16 - i'm going to put
02:18 - what else is there um jackets
02:22 - okay so that there we go now we added
02:25 - jack to the list
02:26 - and why don't we print the um
02:30 - the closet now which is the list don't
02:32 - get confused okay
02:34 - let's print the list which we named
02:37 - closet
02:39 - clothes books toys choose clothes books
02:43 - choose toys and jackets
02:44 - there we go um this is now the list of
02:47 - closets
02:48 - if we want however to get one specific
02:51 - one
02:52 - we would do like this um print
02:57 - um closet and
03:00 - little brackets like this and what would
03:03 - we want so here's a list
03:04 - close books choose so let's just do
03:06 - shoes which is number three
03:09 - like so wait no she was in number two
03:13 - because it started from zero okay let me
03:14 - see
03:16 - okay uh
03:19 - oh i forgot i typed it wrong print
03:22 - um remember your spelling is really
03:25 - really
03:26 - um sensitive so remember to spell
03:30 - correctly
03:32 - to this and like this
03:35 - choose there you go remember it's just
03:37 - from zero
03:38 - okay so it's zero one two three four and
03:41 - there you go it's
03:42 - choose now what if we want to remove
03:46 - something from the list like pretend
03:49 - they took it out
03:50 - okay so you're going to school right um
03:53 - and then you take out your clothes
03:54 - to go to school your uniforms so we
03:57 - would do
03:57 - a closet dot remove
04:02 - and then what do you want to remove
04:03 - right so we would do
04:05 - uh we would do it like
04:09 - have a parenthesis and then we would say
04:11 - what number we want to remove
04:12 - just like in our printing so
04:15 - remove closet closet
04:21 - um which one zero right okay
04:26 - um now we print it out and it should be
04:30 - gone
04:31 - print closet
04:34 - parentheses closet like so
04:38 - book shoes toys and jackets no more
04:39 - clothes because we took them out right
04:41 - we removed them
04:43 - okay moving on next one is if
04:46 - we want to add
04:49 - again but this time it's going to be in
04:52 - a different code so it's alternative
04:54 - between append
04:55 - so closet um dot insert
04:59 - okay insert um what
05:04 - boom we're gonna insert closed again so
05:07 - we took them out
05:08 - now we're putting them back in
05:11 - closet did i do something wrong i think
05:14 - i did
05:16 - wait uh sorry guys um
05:20 - we need to insert where we want to
05:23 - uh like put this back so
05:26 - pretend this one like
05:29 - needs to go to specific place not like a
05:32 - pen they're different actually
05:34 - a pen is to just put them like behind
05:37 - everything
05:38 - but um insert you can actually control
05:41 - where it's going to be placed so first
05:44 - you have to do it like this
05:45 - like when you want to place it back to
05:47 - pretend there's like
05:49 - four five boxes in the closet
05:52 - marked as zero one two three and four
05:56 - so we took the clothes out of um box
05:59 - number zero right
06:00 - so we're going to put them back in box
06:02 - number zero which means that we're gonna
06:03 - put zero
06:04 - comma um
06:08 - where is it zero comma
06:11 - close so now we're going to put the
06:12 - closed back in box zero
06:14 - like so whoops got remember those
06:17 - single quotes like so
06:21 - and now after this we will click enter
06:24 - and we'll print it out
06:26 - print closet sorry for my cad back there
06:30 - closet and then there you go there's
06:32 - clothes book shoes toys and jackets
06:33 - everything is in the same position again
06:35 - and after this we're going to
06:40 - um we're going to show
06:43 - that you can actually reverse it around
06:46 - i'm not sure why
06:47 - this is a command but it somehow is for
06:50 - some reason
06:51 - if you want it to be more advanced or
06:53 - something
06:54 - then it's just the same thing as
06:56 - removing
06:57 - but however i mean printing out a
07:00 - specific
07:01 - um call a specific uh
07:04 - item but this one is
07:07 - i don't know why you put a negative
07:10 - number on it and that negative number
07:12 - would be
07:13 - like pretend you put like zero right if
07:16 - you didn't put um a minus sign in front
07:19 - of it
07:20 - then it's going to be closed but if you
07:22 - put a minus sign in front of zero it's
07:23 - going to be jacket
07:24 - weird right let's check it out print
07:29 - um closet
07:32 - this subtract zero
07:35 - like so and now it should be jackets
07:40 - clothes what wait one sec
07:46 - for some reason it doesn't work with
07:47 - zero but let's just try
07:49 - doing with one maybe one would work
07:52 - for some reason zero doesn't work oh
07:55 - because negative zero
07:56 - is still zero i forgot about that
07:59 - negative zero
08:00 - without a minus sign is still zero so
08:04 - what if we try one negative one and one
08:06 - is different
08:08 - there we go it's jackets oh i get it
08:11 - um for this um thing they don't start at
08:14 - zero
08:14 - instead they start at one so yeah listen
08:17 - learn
08:18 - negative zero is the same thing um it's
08:21 - going to be closed no matter what
08:22 - but if you want to do negative one it's
08:24 - going to be jackets so it's starting at
08:26 - negative one
08:27 - if my theory is correct negative five
08:30 - should be
08:30 - closed again boom yeah it's close
08:35 - okay so it starts at one if you want to
08:36 - do it fancy like this
08:38 - not sure why would anybody want to do it
08:40 - but apparently it's a thing so
08:42 - you guys could use if you want if you
08:44 - want to be more advanced
08:45 - now moving on to um
08:50 - we did uh printing specific
08:54 - one sorry my tongue specific ones and
08:58 - now why don't we start doing something
09:02 - else so since we've been starting to do
09:05 - specific ones after that what was it
09:07 - let me see oh yeah um printing
09:11 - your uh how do you call it
09:15 - printing your
09:18 - um hi like
09:21 - you're gonna label something instead of
09:23 - toys you could rename it to something
09:25 - else okay
09:26 - so pretend like this we're going to do
09:29 - [Music]
09:31 - my item okay
09:34 - equals to
09:36 - [Music]
09:38 - close close
09:42 - and then no no closet sorry
09:45 - closet um
09:49 - this what was it toys right yeah
09:53 - closet three which is toys
09:56 - and like this
10:00 - my item equals closet item number three
10:04 - click enter now print my
10:07 - item
10:10 - oh sorry we got a parenthesis around it
10:14 - parenthesis my item
10:18 - so there you go toys so you can rename
10:21 - your
10:22 - um items in your list
10:25 - you can rename them to something else by
10:28 - setting a variable and then setting it
10:30 - to
10:30 - the item in the list and yeah that's how
10:33 - you rename something
10:34 - in a list moving on next to
10:39 - um here we are
10:42 - [Music]
10:45 - okay so we're going to just
10:48 - change something we're going to change
10:50 - something in the list
10:52 - um i'm not sure
10:56 - but this one is actually going to be
10:58 - more cooler
10:59 - than the other strategy it's going to be
11:02 - like
11:03 - the same thing but instead of having to
11:04 - do all that my list
11:06 - like my item like set it to closet
11:10 - number three and then print
11:11 - closet number three this one's more
11:13 - easier so garage
11:15 - sorry not garage but i'm getting mixed
11:17 - up closet okay
11:19 - closed it um
11:23 - and we're going to just do something
11:25 - like this
11:27 - closet number one okay
11:31 - and we're going to change it
11:34 - closet number one here we are i'm going
11:37 - to
11:38 - equals to what closet
11:41 - one is choose so we're going to do
11:43 - sneakers how about that
11:45 - sneakers okay more specific
11:49 - and at the same time still the same
11:51 - thing so they
11:53 - took out the shoes and put in sneakers
11:55 - so now we
11:56 - print out the closet it should be
11:59 - instead of shoe sneakers
12:01 - [Music]
12:03 - um let's wait one second
12:06 - print close it there we go oh
12:10 - parentheses ah keep on forgetting
12:12 - parentheses
12:13 - close it bam there we go clothes sneaker
12:16 - shoes toys
12:19 - what oh i did i change it
12:23 - did i do anything no it didn't oh so
12:26 - this is
12:26 - adding a game
12:30 - really is it one sec guys
12:33 - closet one equals sneakers so we put in
12:38 - sneakers in section number one
12:42 - oh i get it so
12:45 - we did that and it just inserted in okay
12:48 - it doesn't change it inserts it
12:50 - okay nice moving on to which one is it
12:55 - moving on to
12:58 - oh this one getting a little fancy here
13:02 - moving on to print
13:06 - len closet which i'm pretty sure
13:11 - but let's just check okay print
13:16 - print and then here when
13:20 - blend and then closet
13:24 - and what should be printed by
13:28 - number three how about that let's try it
13:32 - number three then let's just try
13:36 - printing
13:36 - lens right so
13:40 - there we go and it's five this is gonna
13:43 - be how much it
13:44 - is in here if my theory is correct then
13:47 - if we remove
13:50 - um wait no no
13:53 - it wasn't removed right yeah print
13:57 - so we gotta remove our thing so if we
14:00 - just copy from here
14:02 - where it was or are you remove
14:05 - um remove guys help
14:08 - [Music]
14:10 - and here we
14:15 - r so we're going to remove it
14:19 - okay so we're going to remove it like
14:21 - this but we can't find it so let's just
14:23 - type it
14:24 - remove um
14:28 - wait no closet closet
14:32 - dot remove
14:35 - uh which ones
14:37 - [Music]
14:39 - closet dot remove
14:42 - five
14:46 - okay so let's see
14:47 - [Music]
14:49 - okay so it doesn't work like this let's
14:52 - see
14:53 - why okay i'm just going to copy up from
14:57 - up here
14:59 - but my program doesn't like me so it
15:02 - doesn't give me remove
15:04 - it doesn't show me remove either
15:08 - so they took out the clothes right right
15:10 - here closet remove
15:12 - oh i need to put closet okay
15:15 - go bam bam and then print
15:19 - the closet then i mean print length
15:24 - closet okay
15:28 - enter four there you go it's the amount
15:31 - of um things are
15:32 - in the list okay moving on
15:36 - after len is
15:40 - now we're going to create another um
15:44 - how do you call it another list it's
15:46 - called it's going to be called
15:49 - uh the alphabet
15:53 - i'm just going to write alpha no
15:54 - actually alpha is hard to spell
15:56 - how about just write capital a okay
15:59 - capital a works
16:00 - and then we're going to set this list
16:03 - like this
16:05 - and we're going to align them in
16:06 - alphabetical order so let me just
16:08 - i o t h
16:12 - okay okay like this and now after this
16:16 - we're going to
16:18 - what i didn't even do anything yet i
16:23 - just
16:24 - said as a list why can't i do that
16:27 - okay let's see so and
16:30 - for some reason
16:31 - [Music]
16:33 - oh i forgot here we go again
16:38 - jimmy forgiveness
16:42 - we have to put the single quotes in
16:45 - there
16:46 - okay so now it should work bam
16:49 - good okay now we're going to print
16:54 - a and it should be like this right
16:58 - but if we say print
17:04 - sort
17:05 - [Music]
17:07 - a what if it's like this
17:11 - oh sorry i wrote the wrong code i'm not
17:14 - supposed to say
17:15 - print sort we're supposed to say a dot
17:18 - sort
17:20 - okay there we go and we're going to
17:24 - just do that
17:32 - like so add some parentheses enter and
17:36 - then we're going to print
17:38 - a let's see what it does boom there you
17:41 - go it adds a line a b c
17:42 - d e f g h i
17:46 - j k l m n
17:49 - o p q r s
17:52 - t u v w x y and z yeah there we go
17:56 - that works and now after this we're
17:58 - going to
18:00 - um after this we're going to reverse it
18:03 - so it's going to be
18:04 - z to a z2a okay
18:07 - g2a what's that gonna be um so we're
18:10 - gonna print
18:13 - now we're going to do sort
18:17 - so
18:19 - [Music]
18:20 - a dot sort
18:24 - and then here we're going to put
18:27 - reverse
18:31 - reverse equals
18:34 - true there we go enter and we're gonna
18:40 - print
18:42 - hey there we go and just switched around
18:46 - completely
18:46 - so yeah that's um the
18:50 - reversing and now we're going to do one
18:52 - last code
18:53 - this one is to temporarily um sorted
18:56 - from alphabetical order
18:57 - so we're going to temporarily do it so
19:00 - print
19:02 - this one is the one i got confused on
19:04 - sorted
19:07 - a there now it's going to temporarily
19:10 - switch it
19:11 - but however if you print it look
19:15 - if you actually print a
19:19 - okay it's still switched around so this
19:22 - is just temporarily to
19:24 - get you like the view of what it's
19:26 - actually is if it's like alphabetically
19:28 - aligned but actually it's going to be
19:30 - like
19:31 - this so yeah sorted is to temporarily do
19:35 - it
19:36 - and that's it for today guys see you
19:38 - next video
19:39 - bye
