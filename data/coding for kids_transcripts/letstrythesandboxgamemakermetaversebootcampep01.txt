00:00 - hello everybody my name is jemmy and
00:02 - today i will be giving you a brief
00:04 - overview on
00:06 - uh
00:07 - sandbox game maker a very exciting game
00:10 - maker and it's very fun you can do a lot
00:14 - of things with it
00:15 - and i'll show you how to work with it
00:17 - but first let's know what sandbox is
00:19 - sandbox is a
00:22 - basically a
00:23 - game that is located inside of the
00:25 - metaverse it's like a multiplayer game
00:29 - you can play with other people but
00:30 - instead of being any regular game you
00:32 - can actually buy land you can do stuff
00:35 - with your land um like make a business
00:38 - or something and you can exchange coins
00:41 - which is sand it's called can the
00:43 - currency is sand like ours would be
00:46 - bought or dollars but in the game it's
00:48 - called sand um there are three main
00:50 - components of sandbox of course there is
00:53 - the voxel edit which will let you design
00:56 - 3d models there is the marketplace which
00:59 - allows you to sell stuff and um get
01:02 - stuff and there is the
01:05 - game editor which is
01:07 - what i'm doing right now if you want to
01:09 - know
01:10 - more about the
01:12 - um
01:13 - the voxel
01:15 - edit then go check out my sister's
01:17 - channel it's the strawberry and it's
01:19 - link in the description uh af you should
01:21 - thank me for the shout out
01:24 - okay what
01:26 - yeah you should thank me for the shout
01:28 - out
01:29 - what i don't want to shout out anyways
01:32 - let's move on to
01:34 - uh the game mode
01:37 - okay let's move on to the game editor so
01:41 - first off i'm not going to be showing
01:43 - you how to i'm not going to be
01:44 - explaining i'm going to do step by step
01:46 - but anyways this is just uh
01:49 - what we're going to be doing today it's
01:51 - going to look somewhat like this
01:53 - so you have a player right here
01:55 - and you can walk around i'm not sure if
01:57 - the sound is too loud or not but yeah
01:59 - basically you have a player
02:01 - um and there is some mobs or like some
02:04 - entities for you to fight
02:07 - and you can fight against them like that
02:09 - oh
02:10 - i was looking at obs um but yeah you can
02:12 - fight with them uh
02:15 - and you can like hop around on the
02:17 - stairs and stuff
02:18 - uh and yeah you can do a lot of stuff
02:20 - it's with 3d
02:22 - so yeah
02:24 - it's very
02:26 - uh has a lot of uh how you call it
02:30 - it has a lot of different varieties you
02:32 - can do
02:34 - um there is different mobs you can work
02:36 - with too
02:38 - there's these mobs and i will be showing
02:40 - you
02:41 - how to do all of this how to have the
02:43 - victory and everything so yeah let's get
02:46 - started so first of all let us go back
02:49 - into the home screen um you should
02:51 - probably download your sandbox game
02:54 - maker first and it would look something
02:56 - like this when you come into it and in
02:58 - here you will have three which is three
03:01 - options my games templates and galleries
03:03 - templates is like going to teach you
03:05 - some lessons and stuff uh you can click
03:07 - on there and you can experiment around
03:09 - with it gallery is what other people did
03:11 - before and you can go check it out for
03:13 - yourself um i played some of them
03:15 - already and they are pretty fun um was
03:18 - asked why oscar a camping warrior and
03:22 - etc they are really good they the people
03:24 - who made them are talented um but today
03:27 - i will be showing you the physics and
03:28 - how to pan around it how to zoom in zoom
03:31 - out how to add some uh how to delete
03:34 - stuff how to add stuff how to make mobs
03:37 - attack you etc and how to have a sword
03:39 - even so stick around until the end of
03:42 - the video because this video is
03:43 - jam-packed with facts so let's enter in
03:46 - our experience name so what you want to
03:49 - do is click here and then after that
03:51 - just enter in your name i will enter
03:52 - this tutorial like so and here you can
03:56 - select a grid to one by one two by two
04:00 - um and all of these grids however i am
04:02 - going to be doing one by one since it
04:04 - will not lag your computer as much if
04:06 - you do four by four it's quite big and i
04:08 - find that quite unnecessary one by one
04:10 - is big enough uh like my other game it
04:12 - was a one by one and i still had plenty
04:14 - of space to do what i wanted to do so
04:16 - one by one it lets you work with it
04:18 - without lag so let's click on one by one
04:21 - you can also select the theme um and
04:23 - there's multiple themes for you like
04:25 - it's going to be terrain kind of ish and
04:27 - there's going to be like whatever it
04:29 - says there's going to be a lake desert
04:30 - nether meadow antarctica jungle island
04:33 - etc but i will be doing it on empty
04:36 - since we can design our own things so
04:38 - once we do that we're going to click
04:39 - create and it will come into the loading
04:41 - page
04:42 - once we did that we will hop into a
04:44 - screen like this and what you want to do
04:46 - first is if you are experienced with
04:48 - games then you can move around with w a
04:51 - s d w is forwards s is backwards a is
04:55 - left and d is right okay so those are
04:58 - the controls to move around and you can
05:00 - zoom and zoom out um
05:02 - to basically get the fov you want you
05:06 - can also
05:07 - pan around like this doing a 360. with
05:10 - the
05:11 - um controls q and e
05:13 - q and e um q is to go turn pan right e
05:16 - is to pan left
05:18 - and the difference between holding a is
05:21 - a just lets you on like um to the side
05:24 - but cue actually
05:26 - wraps around like this um
05:29 - if you want to
05:30 - uh basically rotate around like a
05:32 - certain object like this one
05:34 - press alt and then click on the space
05:36 - you want the camera to rotate around so
05:38 - i want to rotate around this spawn point
05:41 - so alt click and there we go you can
05:43 - drag your mouse around while holding alt
05:46 - and it will be something like this which
05:48 - is pretty cool and that is basically the
05:51 - basic controls of course there is middle
05:54 - click too which helps you pan around
05:55 - like this basically wasd but just it's
05:58 - quicker um anyways there is more
06:01 - commands but i will not be showing you
06:04 - every single one since i already showed
06:06 - you the basics and what you should use
06:08 - so there we go that is the command and
06:10 - let's get to building so how to place a
06:13 - block you might wonder uh what you want
06:15 - to do is if if you ever played minecraft
06:17 - before this is kind of like minecraft
06:20 - click l or in minecraft you would click
06:22 - e but this one's l and now we can take a
06:25 - look at the stuff we have so we have
06:28 - blocks if you click on blocks there is
06:30 - going to be
06:31 - blocks for you to choose and how you can
06:33 - build with um i will be choosing a
06:37 - dirt brown okay a dirt brown okay once
06:40 - we chose our block we will just simply
06:43 - drag it into our inventory or hot bar so
06:46 - i drag into my first slot then after
06:49 - that i can have uh i'll have another one
06:52 - i'll have cobblestone with grass
06:55 - and i will have a
06:58 - asphalt
06:59 - lining like this one
07:01 - actually no i'll have a
07:04 - asphalt with clean white and black
07:07 - there so now once my hot bar is filled i
07:09 - press l again and then it will get me to
07:12 - this page um you can click on this arrow
07:15 - to hide in or out the hud
07:17 - and yeah so now once we have our hotbar
07:20 - slot filled with four blocks the way to
07:22 - place it is um not like minecraft
07:25 - minecraft uh if you hold left click then
07:28 - it will be breaking the blocks and if
07:30 - you press right click then it will be
07:31 - placing it but it's just opposite in
07:33 - here so you click left to place it click
07:36 - right on the block to delete it so let's
07:39 - place it down first so let's build like
07:41 - a house or something around this spawn
07:43 - point um so the way to zoom not zoom but
07:47 - to have a top down view is to hold alt
07:49 - and
07:50 - hold your not your scroll wheel sorry
07:52 - your left click and now we can build
07:55 - whatever we want like
07:56 - this
07:58 - okay
08:00 - like so and now we build uh one two
08:03 - three four five a five by five uh
08:07 - thing i think sorry house um around our
08:12 - spawn point and of course we can do much
08:14 - more but i'll just show you how to place
08:15 - and break blocks first
08:17 - so here we place all our blocks
08:20 - so it's now three blocks high okay and
08:23 - then you can place it
08:25 - into like this
08:28 - okay
08:30 - you can change your point of view to get
08:31 - an easier
08:33 - um
08:34 - easier way to
08:36 - not wait easier uh
08:38 - angle to put your blocks so now if we
08:40 - want to play our game what we want to do
08:42 - is we want to press tab and then it will
08:45 - basically switch from editor to play so
08:48 - if you hold tab it will go like this and
08:50 - now you spawn in here um in our little
08:52 - dirt hut that we made like so and you
08:56 - can actually be the player and you can
08:57 - run around
08:59 - and uh to punch something let me
09:01 - actually get an entity for this so the
09:03 - way to get an entity is you want to go
09:06 - into your library again and click on the
09:08 - entity right here entity library you can
09:11 - get any of them i guess um but i will
09:15 - get the beaver
09:17 - like so place a beaver down and once you
09:20 - did that what we want to do is we want
09:22 - to click on this thing right here um and
09:25 - once you click on the beaver you can
09:27 - actually assign this is to move by the
09:29 - way um
09:30 - if you click on this thing and you click
09:32 - on the beaver you can actually assign
09:34 - the behaviors that it has so right now
09:36 - it's on prey and what prey does is
09:38 - basically if there's a predator around
09:40 - when the predator is hungry it will
09:42 - chase the prey i will show you that
09:44 - example later but what you want to do is
09:46 - we want to just punch it first i guess
09:48 - um
09:49 - so we'll just have it as a
09:52 - as
09:53 - maybe uh maybe a melee enemy which will
09:56 - actually attack us back but if we turn
09:58 - all these down then it won't attack us
10:00 - anymore but anyways we will now be able
10:03 - to punch this thing
10:04 - so let's hold press tab again as you can
10:07 - see it comes comes after us immediately
10:10 - because it's a melee enemy um and this
10:13 - one you can use for your mobs uh the way
10:16 - to if it actually gets close it can bite
10:19 - you and you can notice that your health
10:21 - will actually go down from that so
10:24 - uh if you have a melee enemy stay away
10:25 - from them um anyways if you left click
10:28 - while you're a player you can hit them
10:30 - like that and you can see that i did
10:32 - nine damage to the beaver um hey she'll
10:35 - feel for a second shield so you can
10:38 - you can also hold sprint uh not hold
10:40 - sprint hold shift to sprint away like
10:42 - this
10:44 - and then uh you can run faster than the
10:46 - beaver you can
10:48 - press spacebar to jump
10:50 - and you can hold right click to block
10:53 - with your sword blocking with your sword
10:55 - will allow you to not take any damage
10:58 - like this
10:59 - and there is one very important fact
11:02 - that we should know is that if we uh
11:05 - block right as they attack then it will
11:08 - be a perfect parry and what it does is
11:09 - basically it will um stun them for a
11:12 - second and it will basically make them
11:15 - uh dazed and which will allow you to get
11:17 - some free hits without them attacking
11:19 - you so let me try
11:22 - oh i'm sorry he attacked me so
11:25 - what trick is to wait until it's red and
11:26 - there we go perfect parry and you can
11:28 - see these days and now you can get some
11:30 - free hits off them um it's if you think
11:33 - about it it's like a survival game it's
11:35 - pretty fun uh but yeah
11:38 - that is my explanation i'm of
11:42 - but anyways you can kill them and if you
11:45 - hold down left click you actually
11:46 - recharge your super power like this and
11:50 - it will do more damage to them and it
11:52 - will go through if they block if they
11:54 - block you can do this
11:56 - and it will go through their shield so
11:58 - yeah that is some basic controls there's
12:00 - another one which is if you hold if you
12:02 - press shift with left click you'll
12:06 - and forward i guess
12:08 - oh yeah you'll lunge attack so
12:11 - it's quite hard to do yeah there we go
12:13 - so um
12:15 - w shift left click will let you throw
12:18 - like a thrust attack i'm pretty sure
12:19 - that's what they call it
12:21 - thrust attack
12:23 - okay there we go see it thrusts itself
12:25 - forward so you have to be
12:27 - oh
12:29 - well that's roll
12:31 - there's some thrust it's really hard to
12:32 - get for some reason
12:34 - there you go so shift and then forward
12:36 - and left click at the same time so shift
12:38 - first forward left click yeah there we
12:41 - go
12:42 - shift forward left click shift forward
12:44 - left click there we go so that is how to
12:46 - rust attack and to roll is i'm pretty
12:49 - sure shift
12:50 - and um
12:52 - left click right
12:54 - oh
12:55 - okay um never mind it's not that but
12:58 - what we can do if we're not sure is we
12:59 - can click on options click on settings
13:02 - uh controls and now we can actually see
13:05 - the controls quick combo attack um
13:08 - and etc so actually let me go back there
13:11 - please
13:12 - okay there okay now we can see how to do
13:16 - stuff um
13:17 - so
13:18 - where is it heavy attack hold
13:22 - um
13:23 - hold uh the left click which is the
13:25 - super power first attack is w and left
13:28 - click perry is that dodge is just
13:31 - uh w
13:32 - right and
13:34 - show hide life is l okay so uh dodge is
13:38 - just w
13:40 - hello
13:41 - i'm pretty new oh oh
13:45 - oh i got it for some reason but i don't
13:47 - oh oh it's just shipped it's just shift
13:51 - okay to dodge is just shift
13:54 - and you will dodge and i'm pretty sure
13:55 - to dodge attack
13:59 - there is a dodge attack but i'm not sure
14:02 - what it is but you can dodge or roll
14:04 - with chip
14:05 - like this okay anyways let's get back to
14:08 - our editor so once we're in here i'm
14:10 - going to delete this little creature
14:12 - over here how you can delete something
14:14 - is you click on a block or something
14:17 - or anything basically and you right
14:19 - click on them oops
14:21 - never mind that's for blocks um how to
14:23 - delete an entity is to click over here
14:26 - click on the entity and delete there we
14:28 - go and that's how you delete an entity
14:31 - um now let's actually make a course so
14:34 - our character can fight uh enemy and
14:37 - actually ha uh
14:39 - win the game
14:41 - so i'm going to make a little pathway oh
14:43 - and let's do some parkour too cause you
14:45 - know
14:46 - it's quite cool okay so the way to
14:48 - delete a massive chunk is to just uh let
14:52 - let's pretend we have uh let's build
14:54 - something a lot right we don't need to
14:56 - keep on placing it like this i forgot
14:57 - you can actually hold down left click
14:59 - and you can drag to create a grid out of
15:02 - how big you want instead of just placing
15:04 - it one by one so now we have a really
15:05 - big grid and the way to delete it is to
15:08 - hold right
15:09 - uh and then just delete your thing so
15:11 - that applies for the ground too uh you
15:13 - can delete a massive patch then refill
15:16 - it like this
15:17 - um and you can delete this again or
15:19 - something but yeah you can
15:21 - not waste your time and you can delete a
15:23 - whole chunk at a time
15:25 - so now once we have a pretty
15:27 - long path i will actually make this a
15:29 - bit longer so that we have room for some
15:32 - parkour
15:33 - okay
15:34 - okay there we go so now once we parkour
15:37 - over there there will be
15:39 - an ending over here
15:40 - so we will let's create some parkour
15:42 - blocks shall we
15:44 - so let's have uh like this
15:47 - and then like this
15:49 - and then
15:51 - even higher three blocks
15:53 - and then one really really really really
15:55 - far away
15:57 - three blocks two and then let's just
15:58 - delete a little bit more
16:01 - and then like this and then this is
16:03 - where the boss fights happen and if we
16:05 - weren't if we run our code right now we
16:08 - can actually try it like this
16:11 - oops there you go and of course you can
16:14 - um
16:15 - sprint while you're jumping which will
16:17 - increase the jump length
16:19 - but i did it so that you don't need to
16:21 - sprint because sometimes people forget
16:24 - to sprint and they just fall off so yeah
16:27 - and now what we're gonna do is right now
16:30 - if you fall over here it basically does
16:32 - nothing um you can just start over again
16:35 - but what we want to do is we want
16:37 - if you fall into here on this part um
16:40 - then you will basically die and then you
16:43 - will come back to your checkpoint over
16:45 - here
16:46 - and then you will just do it again so
16:48 - let's make that first we have to elevate
16:50 - each one by one no actually we can just
16:52 - delete it but that's too
16:54 - much work so i will just elevate it by
16:56 - one
16:58 - like this um and it should still work
17:02 - there we go okay it still works um and
17:04 - we're gonna fill this part with lava
17:07 - or any block of your choice
17:09 - um so once we
17:11 - do that we will click l and i will
17:13 - search for
17:14 - lava there we go i'll get lava here and
17:18 - we will press l again
17:20 - and we'll just fill up this space right
17:22 - here with some lava
17:25 - um
17:28 - actually i'm pretty sure i can just
17:30 - yeah i'm pretty sure i can just do oh
17:32 - sorry
17:33 - i'm pretty sure i can just hold it and
17:36 - oh
17:37 - okay there we go and now the whole thing
17:39 - is filled with lava we can have little
17:41 - uh barriers on the side to make sure
17:43 - they can't escape
17:45 - like so
17:47 - um
17:48 - there we go
17:49 - a player is two blocks high by the way
17:52 - so once we did that let's try it out
17:55 - and of course the lava is not gonna kill
17:57 - us yet because we didn't program it too
17:59 - so if we were still in the lava it
18:01 - wouldn't do anything
18:02 - we can come back up here and then we can
18:04 - redo it but let's make sure that the
18:06 - lava actually kills us so how we do that
18:09 - is we can go into uh global parameters
18:11 - right here
18:13 - or
18:14 - global parameters go into controller
18:18 - on components
18:19 - uh so this is what the player will get
18:21 - hurt by and we can see over here
18:23 - damaging blocks so uh we want the lava
18:26 - to be the damaging blocks right so let's
18:28 - put some
18:30 - lava in here click on the lava
18:32 - by the way click here to edit it so once
18:34 - you do that press lava and block damage
18:37 - meaning how much damage should it do
18:40 - if we want all one hit meaning we have
18:42 - 100 health for a player we can set this
18:44 - to 100 which will insta kill once we did
18:47 - that it should kill us
18:49 - if we press tab again
18:51 - there we go it insta kills um
18:55 - oh and there you go that is the basics
18:57 - of
18:58 - of the parkour course okay i should make
19:01 - a little starting area maybe i should
19:02 - delete the house because you know it's
19:05 - kind of in the way so yeah let's uh
19:08 - delete the house
19:09 - so again deleting is pretty simple just
19:12 - you do this
19:13 - um i will delete this
19:16 - it's really easy to delete too
19:18 - because you know we can delete a whole
19:20 - chunk at a time
19:22 - there we go and now we have a starting
19:24 - area over here we can move the starting
19:26 - area by clicking on this thing and then
19:28 - we can click on the starting area and we
19:30 - can use these xy coordinates to move it
19:32 - or we can click on the plane right here
19:34 - to move it around but i will just use
19:36 - the xy coordinates since they are more
19:38 - accurate
19:39 - and once we did that we can just
19:40 - surround it back by
19:42 - uh
19:43 - these blocks so they can't escape
19:48 - there we go
19:50 - i why i was placing one by one but there
19:53 - so now we have
19:55 - our starting area
19:57 - like this and it's much better because
19:59 - there is nothing blocking you from
20:01 - jumping
20:02 - like this and you made it to the end so
20:06 - yeah that is the parkour course and
20:08 - let's add some enemies at the end so
20:11 - when they kill the enemies um we can win
20:13 - so let's add some space for the enemies
20:16 - let me use the white one now
20:19 - oh that's the black one oh my i
20:21 - accidentally deleted the white one um
20:24 - let me go search for it
20:26 - white asphalt
20:27 - there we go and we put it back into our
20:29 - hotbar slot okay now we can place it oh
20:32 - that's that's number four
20:35 - okay let's place it back okay there we
20:38 - go and now let's build a little wall
20:40 - here
20:41 - oh no i don't want to build with the
20:42 - same one
20:44 - okay
20:45 - oops
20:47 - okay like this
20:50 - and like this
20:53 - and now you can uh for the mob you can
20:55 - do any any mob you want uh
20:59 - and any entity sorry any entity you want
21:02 - so as long as it works
21:05 - so
21:06 - once we are done with this we will let's
21:10 - uh put in the entity so what entity
21:12 - shall we put in i was thinking of
21:14 - putting in the beaver but then i didn't
21:16 - really like killing it that time because
21:18 - it made me feel bad but
21:20 - let's try uh another entity
21:23 - uh maybe an evil one so i don't feel so
21:25 - bad about killing it
21:27 - okay um
21:30 - there's camels they're oh here here all
21:33 - right here are the evil ones there is
21:34 - detector defector block bot three
21:38 - um or defector bot i will get defector
21:40 - bot three since it looks way more evil
21:43 - oh so we put into our hot bar slot
21:46 - press l
21:47 - and we'll place it right in the center
21:50 - there we go that
21:51 - it looks like a chicken
21:53 - it looks like a chicken
21:55 - but um anyways this is our defector bot
21:58 - this i realized it was the back of it
22:00 - let me
22:01 - spin around hey there we go looks like a
22:03 - chicken um but anyways we oh oh i didn't
22:06 - mean to place it um we can control z
22:09 - like so and we can assign the behaviors
22:12 - by clicking on this then clicking on our
22:14 - entity
22:16 - and we can assign a physic
22:18 - uh do we want it to be collision
22:20 - collision means that when the player
22:21 - runs into it he can't just run through
22:23 - and i would recommend to put it on yes
22:26 - uh and then collision plus gravity i
22:28 - recommend no because if it is then it
22:30 - will just go flying so just collision
22:33 - and you can even name it i will name
22:35 - this chicken bot
22:37 - because it looks like a chicken and once
22:39 - we did that we can assign the behavior
22:41 - so right now it is assigned as melee
22:43 - enemy which means it will attack us and
22:45 - we can change the
22:47 - the how you call it the stats by
22:49 - ourselves right now it's on all maxed
22:52 - meaning it's the strongest um we can
22:55 - there's the health and we can add the
22:56 - component a component will basically
22:59 - let us uh
23:01 - win or lose so we can press on victory
23:05 - and we can do on death so when this dies
23:07 - it will become victory
23:14 - okay and now let's add it so that it can
23:17 - um
23:18 - block hits i am pretty sure it's
23:20 - somewhere around uh
23:23 - here
23:24 - i'm not sure though
23:26 - okay there press on edit logic and now
23:28 - you can have a bunch more uh
23:32 - a bunch more options so now we can do
23:34 - can block attack equals to true
23:36 - and now it will be able to block our
23:39 - attacks
23:40 - attack range we can make it this wide
23:43 - health is here
23:45 - uh and yeah there it is
23:49 - we can make it invincible too but
23:51 - anyways that is it so let it let us try
23:54 - of course this is not the finished
23:56 - product this is just a prototype
23:58 - and we can jump here jump there
24:00 - like so
24:02 - and then it realizes but since it's
24:04 - smart it doesn't come here because you
24:06 - know it's not high enough oh
24:09 - i didn't mean to i didn't know running
24:11 - forward would i mean pressing this uh
24:15 - oh no
24:16 - i didn't know pressing the left click
24:18 - would send me forward
24:21 - oh okay there you go so oh my gosh you
24:24 - know i just run on the wall
24:26 - okay for the sake of the video i will
24:28 - run on the wall of course you can make
24:30 - your wall higher um you can even make it
24:32 - invisible which what i will do
24:35 - but to make it not uh to make it cleaner
24:38 - but anyways let's resume uh like there
24:40 - is no gap okay so once we are here we
24:44 - can just hop in and we can start
24:46 - fighting like this
24:48 - but as you can see he's blocking every
24:49 - single hit a way to uh
24:52 - basically fix this problem is to every
24:55 - time he's going to hit you
24:57 - you block it perfectly oh sorry you
25:00 - blocked it perfectly
25:02 - so now you get a perfect parry which
25:04 - will daze him and you get some hits off
25:06 - him too
25:08 - like so
25:11 - and now you win like so um pretty simple
25:14 - pretty fun to do um it's very easy to
25:17 - code which i like i don't like like uh
25:20 - coding where it's like
25:22 - hard to
25:24 - do this coding is very simple you don't
25:26 - need any experience at all and you can
25:28 - do this
25:29 - um and yeah you can have fun with it
25:32 - all you want there's also another trick
25:34 - i want to show you is if you do your
25:36 - super attack
25:38 - it goes through his shield too so yeah
25:40 - that's pretty fun anyways you can make
25:43 - him a little bit more buff by
25:46 - uh making yourself more nerfed
25:48 - so let's go into the player settings
25:51 - which is in global parameters and go
25:53 - into
25:54 - a player controller and go into
25:57 - components but not components avatar
25:59 - sorry and we can go down here and we can
26:01 - look on
26:02 - sword and shield turn those into none
26:06 - so that now the players need to use
26:08 - their fist okay
26:10 - [Music]
26:14 - okay once we did that we can now close
26:15 - this up
26:16 - and we can do it again so now
26:20 - now players only have their fist to
26:22 - block and hit which will do less damage
26:24 - of course
26:28 - okay now you can block it while they're
26:29 - doing it so three two one
26:32 - there we go
26:35 - okay
26:37 - oh oh okay
26:38 - so we can oh sorry we can still use our
26:41 - magic power by the way even though we
26:44 - don't have any sword now oh no i'm
26:46 - really bad at parkour
26:48 - and there's also a little secret i want
26:50 - to show you at the end so stay tuned to
26:52 - find out about it
26:54 - there we go one hit and victory
26:57 - so now let's make the walls invisible
27:00 - first let's make it so that they are
27:02 - taller than the player so they can't
27:04 - jump out
27:05 - so oops
27:07 - okay
27:09 - let me zoom out a little bit
27:10 - okay there and now we will make it one
27:12 - more higher
27:14 - actually we should make it two more
27:15 - because
27:16 - one more wouldn't be enough
27:19 - okay place blocks okay there we go
27:23 - oh
27:26 - okay
27:27 - there we go
27:29 - i remember there was there but i just
27:30 - can't find it now but if i ever find it
27:33 - then i will tell you guys however right
27:35 - now i can't seem to find it so we're
27:37 - gonna have to stick with this wall first
27:39 - so let us play it again and now i'm
27:41 - pretty sure you can't
27:43 - jump out right
27:46 - yeah you can't jump out anymore
27:48 - even with the tallest one you can't jump
27:50 - because you're not two blocks high i
27:52 - mean you are more than two blocks high
27:56 - uh so now oh you can still jump out over
27:58 - here so let us edit that
28:02 - okay let me
28:04 - put this thing oh we had to change it
28:05 - back to free
28:07 - oh that was not the block this is okay
28:10 - okay
28:11 - there we go
28:14 - like oh no
28:16 - okay like this
28:19 - and there now you cannot jump out
28:23 - okay
28:26 - okay now you can just
28:28 - one shot this but i don't want to do
28:30 - that because it's not interesting
28:33 - so let's get a perfect parry and let's
28:36 - open okay three two one
28:41 - okay now we can just beat him up there
28:44 - we go and victory um there's also a
28:47 - thing where you can go into first person
28:49 - which is quite interesting so get a
28:52 - camera and get to first person
28:54 - and place on head equals to yes so now
28:56 - it will be first person and it will look
28:58 - much cooler when you're doing the
28:59 - parkour
29:01 - but you can't really see too much of
29:03 - yourself you can see sometimes your
29:04 - sword and your shadow
29:06 - but other than that you can't really see
29:07 - too much
29:09 - let me drink some water
29:13 - and when you're doing the parkour it
29:15 - looks really insane it looks really cool
29:18 - like you're in vr but when you're
29:20 - fighting
29:21 - it doesn't look too
29:22 - insane because you can't really see the
29:24 - health but anyways let's do some parkour
29:27 - so you can do like this
29:30 - oh okay okay okay
29:32 - okay there we go
29:33 - looks really cool
29:35 - but when you're fighting it looks kind
29:36 - of scary in real life oh
29:40 - okay
29:41 - ah no i fell
29:44 - so let's try to fight in oh no
29:47 - let's try to find first person so we can
29:49 - actually experience it no
29:51 - if i can actually complete the parkour
29:55 - okay if i don't make this i will just
29:56 - put the spawning point over here yeah
29:58 - okay i'm just gonna put the spawning
29:59 - point over there it's my you know what
30:02 - it's okay i'll just put it here because
30:03 - that's gonna screw up the point of the
30:05 - parkour
30:06 - oh okay
30:08 - there we go okay now i made it i made it
30:10 - and i'll just jump in here
30:12 - fight fight oh
30:14 - and you can block it but
30:16 - you ca you can tell when he attacks so
30:18 - you try to block it
30:21 - for perfect perry
30:23 - okay definitely not definitely not
30:24 - perfect perry perfect parry
30:28 - oh it was yeah i got it so that is um
30:32 - the
30:32 - how do you call it that is first person
30:35 - we can actually add more stuff so we can
30:37 - click on rules over here and we can do
30:39 - welcoming players
30:41 - um camera welcome and then we can just
30:44 - uh
30:45 - do whatever we want i will do this world
30:47 - center no actually i'll do avatar so now
30:50 - we will basically be able to call
30:51 - ourself the level name is going to be
30:55 - chicken
30:56 - chicken parkour
30:58 - like so oh parkhuro
31:01 - parkour
31:02 - and we will have our description which
31:05 - is

31:12 - kill
31:13 - the evil
31:15 - chicken
31:16 - robot chicken robot
31:20 - like this and we can actually assign
31:22 - some music to it but i'm not going to be
31:24 - doing that today you can do that but uh
31:27 - i will not um it you can feel free to do
31:29 - that but i am not going to do that for
31:31 - today so if we were to pray not play
