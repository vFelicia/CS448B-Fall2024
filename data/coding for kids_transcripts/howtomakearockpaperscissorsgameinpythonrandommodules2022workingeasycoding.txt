00:00 - hello everybody my name is jemmy and
00:02 - today i'm going to be continuing my
00:03 - series of teaching myself python in the
00:05 - future so i don't forget python in the
00:07 - future and i'm going to be showing you
00:10 - random
00:11 - module i guess in this video and i'm
00:13 - going to be showing you how to make a
00:15 - rocker scissor type of game you can
00:17 - actually use instead of rock paper
00:19 - scissors it could be something else
00:20 - today i'm going to make it a pokemon
00:22 - game so let me show you what i made and
00:24 - what we're going to be making by the end
00:26 - of this video so let's launch your
00:28 - notebook really quickly like so and i'm
00:31 - sorry if the green screen doesn't look
00:32 - that good i'm in a uh not great
00:35 - recording
00:37 - situation i guess but you know it's only
00:39 - for like a couple uh
00:41 - videos it should be
00:43 - it should be fixed like next week or
00:45 - something and then uh so once we're in
00:47 - jupiter let me open my little
00:50 - thingy here i'm not sure
00:52 - i'm not sure which one it is i it might
00:54 - be like um
00:56 - i think it's this one i didn't name it
00:58 - i'm pretty sure yeah i didn't name it
00:59 - okay uh that's pretty bad because i
01:00 - didn't know what it was so always name
01:02 - your uh python uh files and so basically
01:06 - first we're gonna be importing random
01:08 - right because we need to do that since
01:10 - um if we don't then we can't have the
01:11 - random module so once we imported it uh
01:14 - i will run the code and basically what
01:16 - it does is it says welcome to fire water
01:18 - grass uh basically rock paper scissors
01:20 - also known as fwg or fog
01:23 - press enter to start the battle so let's
01:25 - press enter by the way this is a pokemon
01:26 - type game or something so which pokemon
01:29 - type do you choose fire water grass
01:30 - let's pick water
01:33 - you chose water type the computer chose
01:35 - chooses fire you win okay and we can try
01:37 - that again right
01:39 - uh let's search fire
01:42 - the you chose fire the computer chooses
01:44 - water oh no you lost we try okay let's
01:47 - choose water again
01:49 - oh it's that was not that's the wrong
01:51 - one oh i lost again they chose grass
01:53 - okay wait let me try grass
01:56 - oh i keep on forgetting okay grass if
01:59 - you choose this water you win easy okay
02:01 - so basically that's what we're going to
02:02 - be doing and it's not showing now
02:04 - because um it's like luck based but uh
02:07 - it actually has a tied too so if the
02:09 - computer chooses the same thing as you
02:11 - then it ties and yeah we're going to be
02:13 - making that and the ascii art i will
02:16 - show you how to get that too so yeah
02:18 - let's make let's start making it alright
02:20 - so once we're in jupiter notebook i just
02:22 - closed out that notebook that we can
02:23 - open a new python ipy kernel and uh
02:26 - we're gonna rename it this time we're
02:28 - gonna rename it to something that
02:29 - actually means uh so like random
02:32 - yeah i'm gonna name it ep
02:34 - three i'm pretty sure
02:36 - random
02:37 - the ap3 i'm not sure i think it's ep 5 i
02:41 - lost track i'm just going to say random
02:43 - module random
02:46 - module
02:48 - and oh i'll just say random module okay
02:52 - and click rename and first the most
02:54 - important thing is to import
02:57 - the module
03:00 - module okay there you go and the module
03:02 - name is going to be random in this case
03:03 - so we're going to import
03:05 - random like so ctrl enter you might need
03:08 - to wait a bit if you don't have it
03:09 - installed but i already have it
03:10 - installed so i just i just run it and
03:12 - it's instant um so we can press run and
03:14 - then after that it will actually create
03:16 - a new cell right here and from here
03:19 - we're gonna
03:20 - be making
03:21 - make the game here okay
03:24 - and in there we're gonna have uh
03:27 - first we're gonna welcome them of course
03:28 - as we always do
03:30 - welcome you can be very biased because
03:32 - it's your own game welcome to the best
03:35 - i'm gonna
03:36 - capitalize best the best pokemon
03:40 - pokemon
03:41 - battle
03:43 - you
03:44 - will
03:45 - ever see
03:47 - okay well you will ever
03:49 - play in okay there you go uh now just to
03:52 - give them a little hint of what they're
03:53 - going into we're gonna have a start
03:55 - right here as we always do start uh
03:58 - equals to input which is basically uh
04:01 - going to wait for the user to put in
04:03 - their answer and our input is going to
04:05 - be saying uh
04:07 - press enter
04:08 - press enter to start like so with a
04:11 - little thingy here and that okay perfect
04:14 - and then now once you have this we can
04:15 - run it um press enter to start so press
04:17 - enter it doesn't really do anything yet
04:18 - but uh we can after that we can ask them
04:21 - another question so
04:22 - let's say uh
04:24 - choose
04:26 - wait let's say player
04:29 - player
04:30 - player choice like so play your choice
04:32 - it goes to input sorry if the camera is
04:34 - checking a little because i'm typing and
04:36 - it's on my laptop so it's a little shaky
04:38 - and the uh the desk is also kind of
04:39 - checking uh input uh
04:43 - what
04:44 - is the
04:46 - what is
04:48 - what what type what type of pokemon
04:52 - do you
04:53 - choose
04:55 - like so and we're going to have a little
04:57 - parentheses for them to see what they
04:59 - can choose so i'm going to have fire
05:01 - water
05:03 - fire
05:05 - water and grass you can actually search
05:08 - up um pokemon type chart and go into
05:11 - images and then there's a bunch of uh
05:14 - there's a bunch of uh two means it's
05:16 - effective so water against fire is
05:18 - effective so uh water winds electric
05:21 - against water electric winds and you can
05:24 - basically look around on this chart
05:25 - right here i chose fire water and grass
05:28 - because they all loop around to each
05:30 - other i have a google document uh let's
05:32 - see google
05:34 - i'm not sure which one it is but
05:36 - basically all it says is it this one
05:39 - yeah it's for this one so basically what
05:42 - it does is fire beats grass uh and then
05:44 - water beats fire and then grass beats
05:46 - water so it loops around in the full
05:47 - circle and that's why i chose those
05:49 - three because you know it's like rock
05:51 - paper scissors rock beats uh scissors
05:53 - scissor beats paper and paper beats rock
05:55 - so it's like a little circle you can
05:57 - even add more um
05:59 - more how you call it uh
06:02 - more like options or more types
06:04 - but then that will increase it so right
06:07 - now the if statement is at nine i'm
06:09 - pretty sure for
06:10 - thai win loss for every single one of
06:12 - them so taiwan lost high wind loss that
06:14 - we lost so it's gonna be nine
06:16 - and if you add four in there's gonna
06:18 - there might be like two wins two losses
06:20 - i don't even know how that would work
06:21 - anymore um maybe two ties so i would say
06:25 - at three which is pretty good uh number
06:27 - so make a little charge for you because
06:30 - it's gonna get confusing you can use the
06:31 - same thing as me if you want but uh you
06:33 - can make your own if you want to get
06:34 - creative all right now once you got that
06:36 - out of the way let's uh start
06:38 - continuing the coding so let's let's try
06:41 - this out okay don't mind if it goes up
06:43 - there it always does that for some
06:44 - reason sometimes it goes down something
06:45 - that goes up what type of pokemon do you
06:47 - choose so fire
06:49 - that's it but now the thing is we got to
06:51 - make sure that whatever they put in so
06:54 - they could put in like
06:55 - all caps fire like that and it would
06:58 - still work um because python is very
07:00 - case sensitive so if you put like
07:01 - capital capitalization but in the if
07:03 - statement there's lower case it won't
07:05 - work however to make sure that it will
07:07 - always be lower case we have dot lower
07:10 - parentheses at the end of the input this
07:12 - way it will force whatever they put in
07:14 - to be all lowercase so we can even try
07:17 - printing this out so print player choice
07:20 - like so
07:21 - ctrl uh control control enter and then
07:24 - let's put in all caps or maybe not all
07:27 - caps
07:28 - like so fire like that and then you can
07:30 - see it print out fire so it will just
07:32 - force everything to be lower case all
07:34 - right now once we have that out of the
07:36 - way we can add our
07:37 - uh
07:39 - i think i'll add the ascii art first so
07:41 - we're gonna have
07:42 - a player
07:44 - well not player print
07:46 - uh you
07:48 - chose
07:50 - and then whatever they have so uh add a
07:53 - little
07:54 - uh space plus player choice like so
07:59 - plus
08:00 - um
08:01 - now we're gonna have like exclamation
08:03 - points you chose blah blah okay
08:06 - and then we're gonna print an ascii art
08:07 - so the way to find ascii art is oh wait
08:10 - that that won't work because
08:12 - okay we gotta do something else so we
08:14 - gotta make um
08:16 - a list so type list like so
08:19 - equals to
08:20 - uh whatever you have so
08:22 - fire
08:24 - water and grass okay
08:27 - and now uh when the player chooses
08:30 - something
08:31 - we're gonna always have these ones so
08:34 - well this is just this is for the bottom
08:36 - pretty sure this is for the bot the
08:37 - player uh
08:39 - i think we gotta have an issue with the
08:40 - player too if you want to ask your art
08:42 - follow along if you don't then skip this
08:43 - part but this is we're gonna take a step
08:46 - further so if
08:47 - a player choice player
08:50 - choice
08:52 - like so
08:53 - equal equals to
08:55 - fire
08:56 - and then colon then tab this one print
08:59 - you chose
09:01 - uh plus player choice and this way we
09:04 - can copy paste easier and they're also
09:06 - going to print out uh
09:09 - print
09:10 - one two three to make it so that we can
09:12 - print multiple lines uh we're gonna
09:13 - print out the fire so we can search up
09:15 - fire ascii art like so
09:18 - and we're gonna press the second one the
09:20 - first one doesn't really work for me and
09:21 - then you can see we have a bunch of
09:22 - options here
09:23 - um you can choose any of them but
09:25 - sometimes they are very big so i
09:26 - recommend just sticking with a small one
09:28 - like this one this is the one i actually
09:30 - um used so we can just paste that right
09:32 - in the middle
09:33 - nice okay now once we have that we can
09:36 - try testing it
09:38 - enter fire
09:41 - uh okay uh we forgot to make these ones
09:45 - uh a string
09:46 - all right let's try again
09:49 - fire you chose fire and then there you
09:51 - go the fire appears um if you want to
09:54 - make it look better what i would
09:55 - recommend to do is make it a little
09:56 - spaced out we actually have to change
09:59 - these into like uh triple single quotes
10:02 - so we can uh make it multiple lines
10:05 - it's a little bit more difficult but if
10:07 - you want to do it then you can
10:09 - uh
10:10 - i i wouldn't recommend doing this
10:12 - actually since it's very um
10:14 - very not not good
10:16 - okay there let's try it again
10:19 - fire
10:20 - you chose fire and there you go i'm
10:22 - going to delete this one so that it
10:23 - doesn't have that indentation
10:25 - fire
10:26 - okay there you go okay now it looks much
10:28 - nicer and much more spaced out and what
10:30 - we can do here is we can just copy this
10:32 - ctrl c
10:33 - and paste it in here and then you can
10:36 - paste oops make sure to delete the
10:37 - indentation and we paste it three times
10:39 - and now this one we're gonna change to
10:41 - water it's gonna change to grass make
10:44 - sure they're all lowercase and then
10:45 - after that we can just change the ascii
10:47 - art so um to find a wave it's very it's
10:50 - kind of hard so let's search up wave in
10:52 - here
10:53 - i mean to find something that looks like
10:55 - water it's kind of hard but i uh if you
10:57 - search up wave it should work
10:59 - uh you can choose any of them i think
11:00 - i'll just choose like this one
11:03 - or something that's small i think this
11:04 - is smaller but you can't really tell
11:05 - that's a wave so i'll just choose this
11:07 - one looks pretty good
11:10 - yeah one of them is
11:11 - none of them is good after that one okay
11:13 - let's choose wave and let's paste it in
11:15 - here
11:17 - all right
11:19 - hey there that's pretty good that's not
11:20 - too big and then from here we're gonna
11:22 - get a plant okay let me close these two
11:30 - so plant
11:33 - planty sorry
11:34 - plant okay
11:36 - submit comp or i think any search up in
11:38 - here oh yeah
11:39 - all right
11:40 - loading oh let's see there's any good
11:43 - ones okay that one's not bad we'll come
11:45 - back to that okay i like this one i like
11:47 - this one we're gonna copy this one i
11:48 - couldn't find a good plant last time so
11:50 - it looks pretty bad all right so once we
11:52 - have everything uh make sure to use
11:54 - emojicombos.com
11:56 - there it's it's much better than
11:58 - whatever like
11:59 - eu that one was it that one was horrible
12:01 - you had to adjust everything on your own
12:02 - but this one looks pretty good let's try
12:04 - it again so let's try uh grass this time
12:08 - you chose grass okay that looks pretty
12:10 - good uh let's choose water
12:13 - oh i forgot water
12:15 - that also looks really good okay this
12:16 - one's pretty this is better than last
12:18 - time actually the emojis are much not
12:20 - emojis ascii guard it's much more same
12:22 - sized last time one of them was big one
12:24 - of them was small it was really weird
12:26 - and then all them
12:28 - looks looks like what it's supposed to
12:29 - represent so that's good too and okay
12:32 - once you've got the ascii art out of the
12:33 - way let's do the random um the random uh
12:37 - the random i don't know how to call that
12:39 - the random stuff okay so i'm going to
12:42 - copy type list and put it down here so
12:44 - it's easier for us to see and then after
12:46 - that i'm going to make so that the robot
12:48 - chooses it so i'm going to search comp
12:51 - i'm not gonna search computer choice um
12:52 - that's gonna be a variable equals to
12:55 - uh random
12:58 - dot red int
13:00 - like so
13:01 - and then from there we're gonna have
13:04 - one i know zero zero comma three two
13:07 - comma two sorry because now we can
13:10 - actually use uh
13:12 - fire water and grass since python starts
13:14 - at zero so you start at zero one two
13:17 - instead of one two three which will
13:18 - cause one two three and then three is
13:20 - not there so it's gonna cause an error
13:23 - and that's why we have to zero to two
13:25 - you can have it one two three if you
13:26 - want but then you would have to subtract
13:28 - one off um when you print it out so once
13:32 - if let's print it out so let's print um
13:35 - let's print
13:36 - let's copy this one let's copy this one
13:38 - you chose
13:40 - uh yeah this entire thing okay
13:42 - we're not entitling just this this this
13:44 - much okay perfect and then now we're
13:45 - gonna paste it into here
13:47 - like so and instead of you chose we're
13:50 - gonna choose we're gonna uh the computer
13:54 - chose
13:55 - and then plus
13:58 - computer
14:00 - computer choice oh wait that that won't
14:03 - work right uh
14:04 - let's see let's see oh no we can that
14:06 - can work we can just do type list
14:09 - like so
14:10 - oh yeah we can just copy okay okay this
14:12 - is this works this works then copy type
14:14 - listen to here and then from there we
14:17 - can uh
14:18 - we can uh
14:20 - calling not colon sorry uh parenthesis
14:22 - this so type list computer choice so you
14:24 - can zero one two and then let's try it
14:27 - out
14:28 - uh
14:29 - unindented oh yeah i forgot okay there
14:32 - press entry
14:35 - oh geez okay you what type of pokemon
14:37 - you shoot i choose fire you chose fire
14:39 - and then there's an error list object is
14:41 - not
14:42 - callable list object is not callable
14:45 - type
14:47 - type list computer choice
14:49 - what went wrong there
14:51 - list object is not callable
14:53 - uh do we have to make this an str i'm
14:56 - pretty sure we do okay i forgot to
14:57 - convert it to an sdr but less it should
14:59 - work now uh fire
15:02 - uh it's still it's still not working str
15:06 - type list uh let's try printing it oh oh
15:11 - and we can have another if statement so
15:13 - if
15:14 - computer
15:16 - choice
15:17 - equals oh i'm indenting that if computer
15:20 - choice equals equals to zero
15:22 - then what we want to do is uh you want
15:26 - to print
15:28 - uh the computer chooses blah blah okay
15:31 - so we're gonna copy this
15:33 - and we're gonna paste it in here
15:35 - like so we're gonna delete this and then
15:37 - we're gonna delete so we're gonna indent
15:39 - that a little bit so the computer chose
15:41 - and we're gonna put fire in here
15:43 - so we're gonna delete that fire like so
15:47 - and then we're gonna copy this one more
15:48 - time or two more times actually
15:51 - like so
15:53 - i'm pretty sure there's a better way of
15:54 - doing this but i don't i don't know it
15:56 - right now so uh we can we can just do
15:59 - this zero one and two so the computer
16:01 - cho chooses water as the second option
16:03 - and then grass is the dopes and then
16:05 - grass is the third option like so okay
16:10 - fire
16:11 - the mirror shows grass okay now it works
16:14 - okay um there's probably a much better
16:16 - way of doing this but i don't know it at
16:17 - the moment so i
16:19 - i really don't know how to do it and the
16:21 - last time we did it that didn't really
16:22 - work out either so
16:24 - once we have done this we're going to
16:26 - have the a lot of if statements now so
16:29 - we can act or or there's another way we
16:31 - can have the computer print
16:34 - an ascii art too that would be kind of
16:36 - cool
16:37 - but okay let's let's have the computer
16:38 - print out the ascii art as well so um
16:41 - we chose grass right let's let's i have
16:44 - another one okay and then
16:46 - oh this is water type right so copy this
16:50 - where is the water here okay
16:54 - uh up here
16:56 - print you can print the computer shows
16:58 - water okay right here
16:59 - paste that all right
17:02 - and then grab the fire
17:04 - like so and then go to the fire type one
17:06 - right here
17:08 - uh there okay and then
17:10 - print that as well
17:12 - all right now let's try
17:14 - saving this first and then let's run it
17:16 - okay let's see and okay unexpected
17:20 - indent so
17:22 - something got indented uh here delete
17:24 - this
17:25 - uh something else got
17:28 - deleted
17:30 - chose grass
17:32 - where is that in 22 ah here okay
17:37 - let's try it out
17:38 - another one man okay is there anything
17:41 - else
17:42 - i don't think there is so this time it
17:43 - should work okay it does work okay uh
17:46 - fire
17:47 - you chose fire the computer chose grass
17:49 - okay that much that's much more visual
17:51 - and we can actually see what's going on
17:52 - so i like that better and now we're
17:54 - gonna make the if statement so if
17:57 - uh
17:58 - player choice right is it called player
18:00 - choice
18:01 - yeah it's called player choice okay if
18:02 - player choice
18:05 - equals equals to
18:07 - fire so we're gonna work on fire first
18:10 - and
18:11 - um
18:12 - computer choice right
18:15 - computer choice okay
18:16 - come
18:19 - computer choice
18:21 - equals equals to zero so this is fire
18:23 - and fire then what we're gonna do is
18:25 - we're gonna
18:26 - print you tied you
18:30 - tied
18:32 - try
18:33 - again
18:35 - you tie try again okay
18:37 - we're going to copy this and then paste
18:39 - it a couple times paste make sure
18:40 - there's no indent so after that just
18:42 - change this by one
18:44 - two and then from there change the
18:46 - string inside um instead of you tied so
18:49 - if computer versus water that means you
18:51 - lost so you lost dot dot dot
18:54 - try
18:55 - again
18:56 - okay and then for fire versus grass that
18:59 - means you win so you
19:02 - win
19:04 - like so
19:06 - all right and we're gonna copy this one
19:07 - more time twice so one two okay now we
19:11 - gotta be very very very careful with
19:13 - this so we're gonna count one two three
19:16 - now we'll go with this one
19:17 - water
19:19 - water
19:20 - water and from this one grass
19:24 - grass
19:26 - grease no grass okay
19:29 - uh grass again
19:31 - all right and then now we're gonna have
19:32 - to change this up a little bit so it's a
19:35 - view when you lost um so if water and
19:37 - fire that means water wins so we're
19:39 - gonna control see this one
19:42 - control v on top of this one
19:44 - and then if water versus water that
19:46 - means you are tied so control c u tied
19:50 - so control c uh control v
19:53 - all right and then now you lost because
19:56 - water versus grass grass wins so you
19:58 - lost try again
20:00 - right here
20:03 - all right and then now let's do grass so
20:06 - grass versus fire that means they lost
20:08 - so uh we already have that copied it so
20:11 - we might as well just
20:12 - paste it in all right and then if grass
20:15 - versus water that means they win so
20:18 - copy you win and put that right in here
20:21 - that's versus water and if grass versus
20:24 - grass that means you tied um try again
20:27 - copy this
20:29 - and then paste in here
20:31 - like so and that should be good so let's
20:33 - try running this
