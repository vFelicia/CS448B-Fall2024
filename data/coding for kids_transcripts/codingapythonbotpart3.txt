00:00 - hello everybody my name is Jimmy and
00:01 - today I would like to continue our
00:03 - series on part three of our python bot
00:06 - in this video we're going to be covering
00:08 - a little bit more Basics basically
00:09 - functions and classes then after that
00:11 - we're going to be moving on to
00:12 - downloading the actual parts we need for
00:15 - our Autobot and yeah let's go ahead and
00:18 - get straight into it so first things
00:20 - first is we have to continue our
00:23 - functions because we have to use the
00:25 - return uh code basically the return code
00:28 - allows us to adjust the variables inside
00:30 - of the function so as you can see from
00:32 - part two this is our current two
00:34 - functions attack and heal basically what
00:36 - it does is if you heal something if to
00:37 - specify the character the original HP
00:40 - and then the amount you want to heal or
00:41 - attack it by so as you can see if I run
00:44 - this it's going to say right on the
00:46 - character I put in is a Pokemon got
00:47 - healed run is now at 110
00:50 - HP however if I want to adjust the 110
00:54 - HP I can't because uh as you can see
00:56 - it's in a text form and it's only using
00:58 - the local variable h so if I do want to
01:00 - adjust it I can now using the return
01:03 - variable let's go ahead and do that so
01:05 - instead of having H we're going to say
01:07 - we're going control XIs uh and then
01:10 - we're going to instead of printing it
01:12 - out we can actually we can just say
01:15 - return
01:19 - return put that in return H like so all
01:22 - right and now if we to run it I'm going
01:24 - to do a change to attack uh I'm going to
01:26 - go ahead and comment on the heue really
01:29 - quickly
01:31 - okay I'm going to change to
01:33 - attack okay let's try it out right R got
01:37 - attack but it didn't print it out
01:39 - because we returned it first so let's go
01:41 - ahead and do this I'm going copy this
01:44 - put that up there okay try it again all
01:48 - right now I print it out but it also has
01:50 - a variable H for us so now we can say
01:52 - like for example print
01:55 - H like so try it out oh what do I have
01:59 - to do inside a variable print AG return
02:03 - return AG all right guys so I remember
02:05 - now so basically we have to have a
02:07 - variable first so for example if I were
02:09 - to say like p uh let's say
02:14 - ATK ATK goes to attack blah blah blah
02:17 - blah and now we should have the variable
02:18 - H right let's try printing H after this
02:22 - should work no it doesn't ATK Doh no
02:27 - what if I do ATK h I'll just print
02:30 - attack then print attack and I'll not
02:33 - let this print so I'll delete all
02:35 - this okay try out okay there we go
02:39 - finally works so basically if we were to
02:40 - have if we want to print out a return
02:42 - function we would have to have uh a
02:44 - variable set to the set it to the
02:48 - function and then after that we print
02:49 - out the variable then it should print
02:51 - out this now we can play around with the
02:53 - ATK so for example we can do subtract by
02:55 - another 20 so it's at 70 right so now it
02:57 - should be at 50 there you go now you can
03:00 - adjust your uh your thing as much as you
03:03 - like and if you still want the printing
03:05 - stuff then you can just copy and paste
03:06 - it into here and it'll still work so
03:08 - yeah that's basically it uh and that's
03:10 - it for the return function let's comment
03:12 - this
03:14 - out all right let's move on to the
03:17 - classes so in classes it's kind of like
03:19 - a function but it's more wait why is it
03:24 - not
03:26 - hello one two three okay there you go
03:30 - so in a function I mean in a class it's
03:33 - like a function however it's like it
03:37 - it's kind of like a biography or like a
03:39 - description of some sort of whatever
03:41 - object you're trying to describe
03:42 - basically it's going to have different
03:44 - like uh types not types like different
03:48 - descriptions I don't know how to say it
03:49 - but it's going to describe the object
03:51 - basically so let's go ahead and set it
03:52 - up so pretend
03:54 - class uh let's rename this to Pokemon so
03:58 - class Pokemon
04:00 - uh let's and then in here after class
04:03 - Pokemon we got to Define in it which is
04:05 - basically the main core of this class
04:07 - Define in it and then inside of in it
04:09 - we're going to have self which is the
04:12 - the Pokemon itself and then we're going
04:14 - to have the different types so for
04:15 - example I can have the type of the
04:16 - Pokemon the name the let's say the HP
04:20 - all right let's give those three for now
04:23 - now we're going to save uh self.
04:27 - type equals to type
04:31 - self. name equals to name self. HP
04:37 - equals to
04:39 - HP okay so once we have that we can now
04:42 - set a variable let's say this P1 for
04:43 - Pokemon 1 equals
04:46 - to Pokemon and then we have our class so
04:50 - the name of the Pokemon is going to
04:52 - be uh let's see something
04:55 - interesting
04:57 - vaporean I is that that high spell
04:59 - vaporean I'm not sure vaporean and then
05:03 - type is
05:04 - water name oh wait I don't give the self
05:09 - I need to give the name
05:12 - okay HP let's say
05:15 - 110 okay and if we were to print out P1
05:18 - it's going to come out a bunch of
05:19 - gibberish if we did it
05:21 - correctly okay
05:24 - uh okay I think I have to yeah I have to
05:27 - make these a string okay good so now it
05:30 - comes a bunch of gibbers like this this
05:32 - is like the the code for our class or uh
05:35 - Vapor right here if we want an actual
05:38 - sentence or an actual like word that we
05:40 - can understand we're going to do p1.
05:42 - type so what is p1's Type which is
05:45 - obviously vaporean I mean water and then
05:48 - if we do the name of it name vaporean
05:52 - and HP would be
05:54 - 110 so yeah that's basically it for
05:57 - classes you can have a bunch of
05:58 - different like uh I don't even know how
06:00 - to call descriptions and then you can
06:02 - add the descriptions yourself into here
06:04 - and then it'll print it out for you but
06:06 - yeah anyways that's it for classes now
06:08 - let's move on to the interesting part
06:10 - which is downloading and installing the
06:12 - packets not packets uh software we need
06:15 - for our actual code so let's go ahead
06:17 - and open up browser I'm just going to
06:19 - open up my Au GX because it's a it's a
06:21 - browser I use and the first thing we're
06:23 - going to be downloading is LD player so
06:24 - let's go ahead search that up LD player
06:27 - and we're going to click on download LD
06:28 - player right here
06:30 - download it l player is like something
06:33 - we can use to
06:35 - um uh to play games on mobile that
06:40 - aren't allowed on PC but we can play on
06:42 - PC because we have LD player so it's
06:44 - basically like a your mobile phone on a
06:46 - computer and now let's wait for it to
06:48 - install all right everybody I'm done
06:50 - installing L player and we can press
06:51 - Start uh we can just go ahead and test
06:53 - it around a little bit as you can see it
06:55 - looks like a mobile game and also it's
06:58 - it's enti for me right now but we can
07:00 - change that in the settings so we can go
07:03 - into settings and then we can change it
07:05 - really
07:06 - quickly where is it model no game
07:10 - settings uh Network microphone shortcuts
07:13 - other settings language English I don't
07:16 - know why it's still tied then uh it's
07:18 - okay it's probably only this picture
07:20 - right here let's close this up yeah it's
07:23 - in English as you can see search games
07:24 - LD store and now you can see there's a
07:27 - bunch of things that we can download for
07:28 - example Among Us braw star free fire uh
07:31 - pubg Etc and we can download them and
07:33 - actually play them so yeah that is uh
07:38 - that is basically what uh LD player does
07:41 - you can also use it for other things
07:43 - instead of only coding so yeah let's
07:46 - move on so after this I'm going to exit
07:48 - after this we're going to download
07:49 - something called autoit autoit is like a
07:51 - pixel finder basically when we have to
07:54 - press something we have to find where it
07:55 - is and we can use it using we can do it
07:58 - using autoit so we can go to
08:01 - the H
08:03 - software no actually I'm going to go out
08:05 - I'm I'm going to search Auto download
08:07 - yeah right there okay I'm just going to
08:09 - go down here and press download Auto
08:12 - it this one okay once it's done it says
08:17 - for us to just set it up using
08:19 - configuration wizard it shouldn't be
08:21 - that
08:23 - hard all right it's kind of it's uh
08:27 - meteor like decently size so it takes a
08:31 - little bit of
08:32 - time but anyways we're going to be using
08:34 - it to find colors and also our uh pixels
08:38 - let's go ahead and open
08:41 - this extract All Join
08:44 - folder cck yes and now we wait next I
08:48 - agree next run the script and then yeah
08:51 - just next next done all right now wait
08:55 - for this D set up it shouldn't take that
08:57 - long and it should bring you to a page
08:58 - that looks like like a homepage but
09:00 - we're not going to be actually using
09:01 - that one we're going to have to close
09:02 - and open again all right and press
09:04 - finish this is like the release like the
09:06 - help um we don't need this we can close
09:08 - this up now we can search for auto it
09:11 - like that auto it window info like so
09:14 - press that up as you can see we have our
09:16 - autoit Finder right here and we can
09:18 - press on this finder tool drag it to any
09:20 - point you like so for example if we want
09:21 - to press next we can drag to this point
09:23 - and it'll show you the position right
09:24 - here uh also sometimes it's important
09:27 - for us to know like what idle of the of
09:31 - the browser we're using I can't really
09:32 - breath this perfume in here and then
09:34 - there's also the class it's the Chrome
09:36 - widget right if we were open this up to
09:38 - be speed dial now which is the basically
09:40 - the homepage of uh Opera if you go back
09:44 - here it's going to be LD player like so
09:46 - so yeah that's basically it and now
09:48 - let's move on to our last one which is
09:49 - setting up a virtual environment a
09:51 - virtual environment is very important in
09:53 - this uh type of coding because if we
09:56 - install some things that are like really
09:57 - big we don't want them to be col
09:59 - lettering our computer and also if we
10:01 - don't like if we do something wrong in
10:04 - our virtual environment it doesn't
10:05 - affect our main frame so it's wouldn't
10:08 - be that drastically like impactful
10:12 - however if we set but uh so we should
10:15 - set up a r environment to do that let's
10:17 - go ahead and set it up I'm going to open
10:19 - my folder I'm going to go to my
10:21 - coding oh my God coding Python and then
10:24 - we're going to go to python bot which is
10:26 - the thing we made and then we have I
10:28 - mean we go
10:29 - python python bot as you can see bunch
10:33 - of these guys are still here which I
10:34 - don't know why um I already moved them
10:36 - inside of a teaching but I'm just go
10:39 - ahead and delete these
10:40 - ones yes okay so my teaching F folder is
10:44 - what we got so far part one part two and
10:46 - then the functions thing that we made in
10:47 - part two but now we're going to be going
10:49 - to our big folder and we're going to be
10:51 - uh making a folder in here which is a
10:53 - roast environment so we're going to copy
10:55 - the path and we're going to go to CMD
10:57 - we're go uh CD which is ch change
10:59 - directory change it to this directory
11:00 - and we can do di really quickly to check
11:03 - the folders inside if they're matching
11:04 - as you can see they are high cache and
11:06 - teaching like so all right and now we
11:09 - can also now we can do this Command
11:11 - right here called uh python SLV for
11:14 - virtual I guessing slm sorry and then
11:18 - bend like that uh and then our virtual
11:21 - environment name which I'm going to set
11:23 - python
11:25 - Autobot like so press enter it's going
11:27 - to load a little bit because it's
11:28 - creating it right now as you can see
11:29 - python Autobot has appeared in our
11:31 - folder and we're going to wait until
11:33 - it's done as it comes with a new line
11:35 - that we that way we know it's done all
11:37 - right it doesn't take that long there
11:38 - you go and inside of our python Autobot
11:41 - folder there's going to be three main um
11:44 - folders uh however the one we're going
11:45 - to be looking at is the scripts one
11:47 - which is the activate right right here
11:50 - this activate will allow us to activate
11:53 - our uh
11:55 - our virtual environment and in order to
11:58 - do that we're going to have have to go
11:59 - inside of that folder so we're going to
12:00 - do uh scripts right
12:05 - scripts scrip wait no not scripts what
12:08 - is it we go out all the way python
12:11 - Autobot first so python
12:13 - Autobot backs slash scripts back slash
12:17 - uh activate and the way I'm doing this
12:19 - is just pressing the first letter then
12:20 - pressing Tab and it should come up
12:22 - whatever we have uh so let's press enter
12:25 - as you can see if this low parentheses
12:27 - if these low parentheses come up that
12:28 - means we're in the virtual environment
12:30 - we can do pip list to check the things
12:32 - we have in here the pp packages we only
12:35 - have two we have PP IP itself and also
12:38 - setup tools uh we can install like P
12:41 - game or something to just show you that
12:42 - works so pip install Pi
12:46 - game like that installing collected P
12:49 - game and then blah blah blah blah list
12:52 - again uh as you can see we have P game
12:54 - now now if you were to deactivate this
12:56 - so just press just type deactivate
12:59 - like so it's going to kick us out of the
13:02 - virtual environment like that and we to
13:04 - do a pip list
13:05 - here pip
13:07 - list we got a bunch more do
13:12 - we oh I don't think we actually have any
13:15 - because I factory reset my computer and
13:17 - all my PP packages are gone so that's
13:20 - kind of sad but before I used to have
13:22 - like a whole bunch um just imagine
13:23 - there's a lot of pp packages here all
13:26 - right but the main point I'm trying to
13:27 - say is that they're different so they
13:30 - are I have none in my original folder
13:32 - but I have two inside of the virtual
13:34 - environment itself so yeah that's
13:36 - basically it uh for this um lesson we
13:40 - have to have a virtual environment LD
13:42 - player Auto IT classes and return
13:44 - functions and that's it it's pretty
13:46 - simple this lesson I hope you enjoyed it
13:48 - and see you the next one bye
