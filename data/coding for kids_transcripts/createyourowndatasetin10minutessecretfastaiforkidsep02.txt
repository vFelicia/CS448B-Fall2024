00:00 - hello everybody my name is jemmy and
00:01 - today i will be giving you the second
00:03 - episode of fast ai for kids in this
00:06 - video we're going to be showing you how
00:08 - you can do image scrapping from python
00:11 - so this is so um we can grab our images
00:14 - that we're going to use to create our ai
00:16 - such as for cats or dogs um and we're
00:19 - gonna create our own data set and i'll
00:21 - show you how
00:22 - so first off let's open uh any browser
00:25 - you would like i'm gonna open opera gx
00:27 - because uh it's a pretty good uh browser
00:30 - and then after you opened it what you
00:31 - should do is you should go into uh
00:34 - google collapse just search up google
00:36 - photo lab like this
00:38 - um and just press enter then go into the
00:41 - first one click on that and it should
00:43 - you to bring you to this page um if you
00:45 - haven't did if you haven't done anything
00:47 - yet then it shouldn't uh come up like
00:49 - mine but if you did then uh there should
00:51 - be stuff in here uh ignore all this and
00:54 - create new notebook and it should uh
00:56 - load up into a new page there you go so
00:59 - this is the new page that we have right
01:01 - now um and you can see we can adjust the
01:04 - name and we have one line of code so at
01:06 - first we're gonna adjust the name to
01:08 - uh image scrapping
01:11 - wrapping
01:12 - from python
01:14 - i'll just do image graphing ep02
01:18 - like so and i will go into this great
01:21 - website i'll drag onto the screen uh
01:23 - this is i'll leave this link to into the
01:26 - description by the way it is the jmd
01:28 - image scrapper that we're going to be
01:29 - using um i'll also leave the link to the
01:32 - finished collab file in the description
01:34 - so it would be already done so if you
01:36 - don't want to like follow uh if you want
01:38 - to type the code out we just use that
01:40 - lab file
01:41 - it's the finished product and we're
01:43 - today we're going to be using the jmd
01:45 - image scrapper to create our own image
01:47 - scrapping
01:50 - so first off we can copy this in here uh
01:53 - this the pip install jmd image scrapper
01:56 - so we can copy and paste that this is so
01:58 - that we can just install the image
02:00 - scrapper into our collab workspace and
02:02 - in order to do that we need to uh put an
02:05 - exclamation point in front and let's
02:07 - connect first
02:08 - so once we do that we have to make sure
02:11 - our hardware accelerator is gpu which is
02:13 - the best way to run an ai then click
02:16 - connect over here and then we have to
02:17 - wait until it's done connecting all
02:19 - right once it shows up like this ram and
02:21 - disk uh what you want to do is go ahead
02:23 - and click uh play or
02:25 - right i don't know what that thing is
02:27 - called run um and you will see a long
02:29 - line of code like this uh don't be
02:31 - surprised it will just uh installed for
02:34 - you if it says requirement already
02:35 - satisfied that means you already
02:36 - installed it into the your collab
02:38 - workspace so you don't have to do it
02:40 - anymore and now we're going to create a
02:41 - new one so we can just press uh plus
02:44 - code over here and for our second code
02:46 - we're going to be using uh these two
02:50 - lines right here
02:51 - these two so copy this and go into here
02:54 - and just paste
02:55 - uh this one is so that we can use uh
02:58 - we'll install like all the
03:00 - like all the
03:02 - functions of this image scrapper into
03:04 - our workspace so just press run
03:07 - and then it should come up a check mark
03:09 - and for our next one we're going to be
03:11 - using this one we're going to be setting
03:12 - a route so basically uh where it's going
03:14 - to be saved ads at sorry and we're going
03:17 - to create new code and we're going to
03:19 - put it in there um so this is path root
03:23 - equals to path and then this is cwd
03:26 - stands for current working directory
03:28 - slash images so it's going to create a
03:30 - folder that says slash images to store
03:32 - our data set in um so we can go ahead
03:35 - and press run to
03:36 - you can also do shift enter which will
03:39 - not only run it but we'll create a new
03:40 - code cell for you too i would i need to
03:43 - get into the practice of doing this
03:44 - again um because it's not it's not only
03:47 - more useful it's also more quick and
03:49 - efficient so i recommend just doing
03:51 - shift enter let's go back into our jmd
03:53 - image scrapper and we're going to grab
03:55 - this code right here duckduckgo search
03:57 - route and we're going to paste in here
03:59 - go search root and comma cat cute
04:02 - kittens mac result equals 20. i'll
04:04 - explain to you what it does so basically
04:06 - in here duckduckgo underscore search uh
04:09 - we're going to be searching in
04:10 - duckduckgo since it's going to give us
04:12 - the best results out of all the browsers
04:14 - uh we'll search up cute kittens in our
04:16 - uh like like this cute kittens
04:20 - like so and then press enter but instead
04:22 - we're gonna let um the machine do it
04:24 - this time and it will save into a folder
04:26 - called cats at roots
04:29 - and then we have 20 as
04:31 - the
04:32 - how much it will download for us so it
04:34 - will download 20 and what we want to do
04:36 - is we want to press run
04:38 - and let it load for a bit and there you
04:40 - go now once it hasn't once it came up in
04:42 - here uh if we check in here you can see
04:45 - there's a folder that says images um if
04:47 - we put it down we can see cast which is
04:50 - our folder that we created and if we
04:52 - scroll even more down there's a bunch of
04:54 - images or jpgs that we have downloaded
04:57 - if you right click on them or not right
04:59 - click double click it will show you a
05:00 - bunch of cats cute kittens to be exact
05:03 - um and you can change this to whatever
05:05 - you would like uh and it will come up
05:08 - like these results pretty good uh and it
05:11 - scraps 20 images in total you can change
05:13 - this to be like 100 or a thousand um it
05:16 - doesn't it just uh depends on how much
05:19 - uh
05:20 - data or how much variety your topic has
05:23 - like for cute kittens there's gonna be a
05:24 - lot a very wide amount of data and
05:27 - pictures that you can download but maybe
05:29 - for something like chocolate vanilla
05:30 - cake orange on the side there might be
05:32 - like not that much uh images that you
05:35 - can download um so it might get you some
05:37 - uh spam download and what you can do
05:40 - with that is we can clean it manually
05:42 - and we can actually use a handy dandy
05:44 - function from here uh which is right
05:47 - here these two codes um we can copy them
05:50 - uh and we're gonna go paste them in our
05:52 - new line i'm gonna close this uh
05:56 - like so close
05:58 - tab
05:59 - close all tabs there you go and i'll
06:02 - close this one for now now i'm gonna
06:04 - create a new line of code and we're
06:05 - going to paste these two into it um this
06:08 - is just going to
06:09 - get these two lines of code are just
06:11 - going to
06:12 - clean our
06:13 - data set for us so if we were to press
06:16 - run
06:17 - then it would come with a little panel
06:18 - for us to use you can see that these are
06:20 - all our images that we got
06:22 - um and then you can see there's page one
06:23 - out of three you can click next and it
06:26 - will bring up to the second page the
06:28 - next
06:29 - the third page like so and we can use
06:31 - different folders inside of the big
06:33 - older images um so if we were to go back
06:35 - up here and we're like okay let's find
06:37 - dogs now so we create order called dogs
06:40 - uh with the thing called
06:41 - uh cute puppies like so and then we will
06:45 - click run it will download all the
06:47 - images of your puppies and if we were to
06:49 - press run on this thing again
06:51 - uh it will come up cat still but what we
06:53 - can do is we can actually go to uh the
06:55 - folders and we can select dogs
06:58 - and it will come up the dog images
07:00 - so these are the cute puppies that we
07:02 - have um and cats now we have two folders
07:05 - uh with cats we can check if any of them
07:08 - are like
07:09 - not what we want maybe it's like
07:10 - multiple cats and we only want a
07:12 - singular cat um so we can click delete
07:14 - under here and it'll just cross out this
07:17 - image or we'll delete it and we go to
07:19 - the next one and then we find any cats
07:22 - that we don't want you can see there's
07:23 - two cats here we can delete that
07:25 - next one
07:27 - and you can see we can keep on doing
07:29 - this for dogs and cats and the more you
07:31 - have the more harder it is to clean
07:34 - because then you have to scroll through
07:36 - more and more
07:37 - images and data sets so yeah good luck
07:39 - with that i had to do that it was pretty
07:41 - painful um but it's what you do to get a
07:44 - clean data set and make your ai the best
07:46 - uh to its uh
07:48 - to
07:50 - be great the best to its ability okay
07:53 - and you can also do the same thing for
07:54 - dogs you go through dogs you see oh
07:57 - multiple dogs bye bye they're really
07:59 - cute but they're too much dogs in one
08:01 - picture they might get confused like
08:03 - it's three-headed dog um and then we can
08:06 - go to the last page
08:08 - and two dogs delete
08:10 - and there you go that's how you clean
08:11 - your data set and
08:13 - there you go that's how you clean your
08:14 - data set and for our uh last code last
08:18 - line of code we're going to be doing a
08:21 - code that allows us to
08:23 - um
08:24 - like download our data set into our
08:27 - computer so in order to do that we need
08:30 - this line of code right here
08:31 - uh zip with an exclamation point in
08:33 - front slash r
08:35 - content images for from collab.zip so
08:38 - this just saves it for us and from what
08:40 - a path with content images so that would
08:44 - be this is in the content folders and
08:47 - images and it will save us this thing so
08:50 - yeah we can press play right here or run
08:53 - and you can see it's like oh i'm gonna
08:55 - save and if we were to close this out
08:57 - and open it again
08:59 - uh if we put this a little bit you can
09:01 - see it saves as images from collab which
09:03 - is the name we set right here
09:05 - um dot zip and you can just click right
09:08 - and we can click download and it'll just
09:10 - go into our local computer uh you can
09:12 - see it comes up download complete and
09:15 - yeah that's how you download your data
09:17 - set and that's how you clean it um if we
09:19 - were to go check it out let's go see let
09:21 - me drag it in so images from collab
09:24 - there's the content branch and then
09:25 - there's images and then there's those
09:27 - two folders cats and dogs so if we look
09:30 - in cats there's all the images that we
09:32 - want the little cute kitties um singular
09:35 - kitties um so we can just check on the
09:38 - images
09:39 - and you can check for dogs too
09:42 - and then yeah that's how to get a data
09:44 - set and obviously you can increase this
09:46 - you have more like a thousand or
09:47 - something i hope this helped you and i
09:50 - remember that i will leave these two
09:52 - links from
09:53 - this jmd image scrapper right here and
09:56 - the finished collab file this one in the
09:58 - description so make sure to check that
10:00 - out and yeah thank you for watching this
10:03 - video and see you next time bye
