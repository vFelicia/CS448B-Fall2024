00:00 - there we go all right so now it hurts us
00:02 - and we kill it and this thing heals us
00:04 - yay there we go
00:06 - we can climb back out okay hello
00:08 - everybody my name is jemmy and today i
00:10 - will be giving a brief overview on the
00:12 - sandbox and today we're going to be
00:14 - looking at the beginner tutorial of the
00:17 - sandbox um the beginner tutorial is one
00:21 - second let me bring it up so the
00:22 - beginner tutorials is one section inside
00:25 - of the sandbox um
00:27 - guidelines and it is down here that i
00:31 - was the link and for this website will
00:33 - be in the description so if you want to
00:35 - go look at it then you can um inside of
00:37 - the tutorials section we have the
00:39 - beginner tutorials the medium tutorials
00:41 - and the advanced tutorials
00:43 - right now we will be doing the beginner
00:45 - one and we will do the door and key
00:48 - system moving platforms blocks that
00:50 - damage slash kill you displaying
00:52 - external nfts triggering a
00:54 - trigger victory killing a boss quest set
00:57 - up from start to finish and collecting
00:59 - objects to heal or damage we're going to
01:01 - be skipping spawn points and teleporting
01:03 - because i don't have too much
01:04 - information on that yet but i will try
01:06 - to
01:07 - make that as soon as possible but
01:09 - anyways i will show you um one second
01:12 - let obs
01:13 - come in okay i will show you what we're
01:15 - going to be doing so
01:17 - i'm going to hop into my
01:19 - pre-made um
01:21 - how you call it pre-made uh
01:24 - not data set but
01:25 - why they see this pre-made game uh and
01:28 - this is kind of what we're gonna be
01:29 - doing
01:30 - so we start off here and uh we have a
01:33 - quest open the door right so open the
01:36 - door and the quest description is click
01:38 - the key and open the door right now the
01:40 - door might have looked the door might
01:42 - look opened but it's actually not um you
01:45 - can't walk through it so you have to
01:47 - collect this key first like so
01:49 - and now it you can walk through it uh
01:53 - and after that a new um
01:55 - quest comes up collect the keys but
01:57 - we're not there yet uh the this one is
02:00 - the moving platform where the platform
02:02 - moves around and you can use this for
02:04 - your parkour or hobby games uh that
02:07 - there's moving platforms
02:09 - and you can even use that as an elevator
02:11 - to make it go like up or down
02:13 - uh you can make it go sideways
02:16 - anywhere you like
02:17 - and this one is block slash that damages
02:21 - slash kill you so i made it so that this
02:23 - lava pit right here it doesn't insta
02:25 - kill you but it makes it so that it
02:28 - takes uh
02:30 - it takes 25 uh hp
02:32 - so let's go in it and there you go you
02:34 - can see our hp decreased by 25 um
02:39 - but yeah that is
02:41 - the blocks that damage slash kill you
02:44 - uh another one is that some people was
02:47 - wondering if like we could do it with
02:49 - water if like they could drown in water
02:51 - well you can use this method and make
02:54 - the water take like
02:55 - uh damage you by two
02:58 - or one um depending on how much time
03:01 - you're in the water but yeah you can use
03:04 - this method for that too
03:06 - and the next one is displaying external
03:07 - nfts so this one is
03:10 - very handy when you want to have an nft
03:12 - gallery um if you were to like
03:16 - have any art pieces you want to show in
03:19 - to
03:20 - uh show inside of your land then you can
03:22 - use this method to display the nfts um
03:25 - and then this one is for like an
03:28 - adventure game where there's a there's
03:30 - the thing that hurts you and then
03:32 - there's another one that heals you so
03:34 - you can see the healer and the void
03:36 - attacks you um so yeah so it hurts you
03:40 - like so
03:41 - and this healer right here uh gives you
03:44 - more your hp back by five
03:47 - like so and now we're at the quest where
03:50 - to grab all the silver keys so we have
03:53 - one two three and we need to grab all of
03:55 - them again this could be used for
03:57 - an adventure slash puzzle game you can
04:00 - combine this one with the moving
04:02 - platform one to make it more interesting
04:04 - um but yeah that is the quest and then
04:07 - the last one is um
04:09 - to kill a boss and have it finished so
04:13 - killing a boss will trigger a victory so
04:15 - here's the boss um
04:18 - and then you kill it like so
04:21 - um like there and then victory and here
04:24 - is all the
04:26 - all of the huds are popping up and yeah
04:29 - that is what we're going to be creating
04:31 - today um anyways let's get started
04:35 - um let me open my google so i can
04:38 - see what we need to do
04:40 - for some reason my sandbox keep on
04:43 - disappearing every time i open a new
04:45 - screen so i'm going to have to wait with
04:46 - obs a little bit there we go and let's
04:49 - click create new and i will name this
04:51 - one
04:52 - beginner
04:54 - uh sandbox
04:58 - like so you can name it whatever you
04:59 - want i will have the theme as empty and
05:02 - the land size to be one by one
05:06 - okay once we click create
05:08 - um it should appear something like this
05:10 - uh what i work
05:12 - what i would recommend to do right now
05:13 - is i would just go into one of the
05:15 - corners like this one um
05:18 - and then i will just get a transparent
05:20 - block here let me clear my inventory
05:23 - really quick so we can start off
05:25 - together
05:26 - all right so first we what we want to
05:28 - search up for is by the way if you open
05:30 - an inventory you need to click l
05:33 - the first thing we need to search up is
05:34 - transparent
05:36 - trans or just trans in general one
05:38 - second
05:41 - i'm sorry um trans uh white trend block
05:44 - transparent put that in our first slot
05:48 - another one is a
05:51 - you call it grass block
05:54 - um
05:55 - and i'll put in my fourth slot because
05:57 - uh those are on my mouse and
06:00 - uh so we need a grass block because it
06:02 - it you can be it can be used as a
06:04 - building block and sometimes we destroy
06:07 - the ground so we need to use the grass
06:09 - to patch it back up grass one is the
06:11 - same one as this one
06:13 - and another one we need to use is the
06:16 - door so door i recommend the desert
06:19 - building door as it's not as confusing
06:21 - as these two the large space door is
06:24 - kind of
06:25 - uh glitchy um but the wooden door uh i
06:28 - think it's kind of different too so just
06:30 - grab the desert building door and then
06:33 - grab some keys so
06:35 - gold search for gold grab the gold key
06:37 - in your third slot and then search up
06:40 - silver
06:41 - and put the silver key in your fifth
06:42 - slot
06:43 - after this we will need uh
06:46 - two mods i'm pretty sure but before that
06:49 - we need lava
06:51 - lava
06:52 - okay and put that in your seventh slot
06:55 - and in your sixth slot what you want to
06:56 - put in is your carpet
06:59 - so stretch up carpet and you can choose
07:01 - any of them i will choose the orange one
07:04 - because it looks better or it looks good
07:06 - um and once we did this uh the rest
07:09 - thing the rest we need is a ladder
07:12 - so get some ladders and i would use the
07:16 - wooden ladder
07:17 - uh after that we will just need
07:20 - the
07:22 - two enemies and then we need the final
07:24 - boss but we can add that in later so
07:26 - let's have the enemies
07:27 - so we need the void right so let's put
07:30 - the void in there and we need a healer
07:32 - which is called a victory trigger
07:34 - and put that in our last slot now we
07:37 - have our hot bar filled up and we will
07:39 - for the final boss we will add it later
07:42 - so now the second thing we want to do is
07:44 - this might be a bit tedious but what you
07:46 - want to do is you want to just count the
07:48 - squares so one two three four five six
07:52 - seven eight nine ten
07:53 - and then divide it right there
07:56 - one two
07:57 - another way to do this um
08:00 - is to just uh click on square right here
08:02 - and set it to
08:04 - uh width height to one and the depth to
08:08 - ten and now what we want to do is we
08:10 - want to just put it into there
08:13 - and then once and then after that we put
08:15 - a lava
08:16 - not lava sorry grass block like so oh
08:20 - wait i forgot um it fills it in so we
08:22 - gotta find something else i'll just
08:24 - replace the grass block with some brick
08:27 - okay there so now we just uh
08:30 - oops we repeat this process like so
08:34 - uh one two three
08:37 - uh how about let's repeat this let me
08:40 - count one two three four five six seven
08:42 - eight we repeat this seven times so one
08:46 - two three four
08:48 - and then keep on switching
08:50 - five
08:52 - six oh sorry
08:54 - six
08:55 - seven there once we have all seven that
08:58 - we're gonna use
08:59 - uh
09:00 - click on free again right here and then
09:02 - now go to the edge of the block so
09:04 - pretend this is like the first section
09:06 - right go to this one right here you'll
09:08 - actually go to this one right here and
09:10 - then just drag it out
09:11 - um i don't think the how long you drag
09:14 - it out matters but if you keep it even
09:17 - that is also great
09:19 - so we drag it like so
09:23 - there we go we just want to divide into
09:25 - small sections
09:28 - like so
09:30 - there we go and now we
09:31 - the how we make sure it's all even with
09:33 - each other let's just draw a line from
09:36 - here and make sure that all the edges
09:38 - are touching it like so and if they are
09:40 - then you know that they're even
09:42 - uh you don't have to do this part but
09:44 - what i want to do is i would just go
09:47 - over this one more time like so to make
09:50 - it like uh even with each other
09:53 - okay
09:55 - and i would usually go one more
09:58 - um no sorry two more to make it three
10:01 - blocks high so the players can't jump
10:02 - over it as easily
10:04 - but of course this is just dividing into
10:06 - sections so you don't have to do this
10:09 - a better way to do it is just to drag it
10:11 - all
10:12 - like so
10:15 - and there we go
10:17 - i'll just have it up to two
10:19 - because that would be a lot easier
10:22 - okay
10:24 - okay there we go once we have all our
10:25 - sections that we need to use uh we can
10:28 - start off um
10:29 - by
10:30 - getting the door
10:32 - but before that we need to put in our
10:35 - spawn point to make it a little closer
10:38 - okay
10:41 - all right let's put it in somewhere like
10:44 - here
10:45 - there okay now inside of this first
10:47 - section what we want is we want uh
10:50 - we want
10:52 - um
10:53 - a door with a key right so let's put our
10:56 - door in it might be sideways at first
10:58 - but that's okay
10:59 - uh place it like right there and then
11:02 - get our um
11:04 - moving tool not start not the moving
11:06 - tool get the rotating tool and then
11:08 - rotate it hold shift and rotate
11:11 - like so and once this door knob is
11:14 - facing our way you know you have it
11:16 - correctly and put it somewhere in the
11:18 - middle
11:19 - grab the golden key and put it in front
11:22 - like so i'll move the spawn point a
11:24 - little bit
11:26 - okay there we go and uh now once we did
11:29 - this we will go into rules right here uh
11:32 - and then we will add quest oh no first
11:34 - turn on quest add quest and let's call
11:37 - this door
11:38 - no we're just open door open
11:41 - door like so and then um say collect
11:44 - golden gold key
11:47 - and open the door
11:51 - door okay like so and
11:53 - once we do this we're going to leave
11:54 - this at auto unlock auto launch um
11:57 - counter type will be collected objects
12:00 - the tag will be gold
12:03 - amount is one
12:04 - um and send message is open
12:09 - like so uh open
12:11 - and the message will be open okay now
12:14 - once we did this we'll just close that
12:16 - up and we will go into the golden key
12:18 - again
12:20 - and we'll scroll down here we're gonna
12:22 - add a tag that says um
12:25 - golden or gold
12:27 - and once we did this we will go into the
12:29 - door
12:30 - and in here message required we will
12:32 - instead of interact we will have open so
12:36 - open there we go and now it should work
12:40 - so
12:42 - um we can't walk through it yet and then
12:44 - we grab the key oh i forgot something we
12:46 - need to make the key
12:48 - sorry we need to make the key uh into a
12:51 - the keys component
12:53 - to collectable so we can collect it
12:56 - there we go and collected and there you
12:59 - go now we can walk through the door uh
13:01 - as easy as that
13:02 - and now let's move on to the second one
13:08 - the second one is moving platforms so
13:10 - let's bring out our carpet
13:13 - and let's put it right somewhere in the
13:15 - middle
13:17 - there we go and once we did that we will
13:19 - just click on our moving tool and we
13:21 - will move it up a bit
13:24 - so we can jump on it around one block
13:26 - high
13:28 - okay
13:29 - and let's uh
13:31 - change the behavior to basic platform
13:35 - and now it will move
13:37 - side to side of course you can have it
13:39 - to like a y which is pretty sure how
13:43 - high it is right
13:44 - yeah so you can make it like an
13:46 - escalator like so the weight duration is
13:48 - um how long does it wait from here so it
13:50 - waits three seconds and it goes there
13:52 - wait three seconds come back down um
13:54 - i'll extend this to two and the platform
13:56 - speed is how fast it goes right now it's
13:58 - on nine point one i'll lower that to
14:00 - five and let's try this out all right so
14:04 - now you can see the platform is uh
14:06 - moving up and down
14:08 - you can use this as an escalator or
14:09 - something oops one second um if it moves
14:13 - up and down there's uh
14:15 - of course the sandbox is still in beta
14:17 - so it's kind of glitchy but uh it will
14:20 - sometimes pull you off
14:22 - of the platform
14:24 - so you gotta be careful about that uh
14:26 - once this thing is done i will show you
14:29 - an example i made an
14:31 - elevator kind of like this but i have
14:34 - some
14:35 - safety precautions so it wouldn't make
14:37 - me fall
14:38 - i will show you that
14:40 - at the end of the video so make sure to
14:42 - stick around but anyways that is a
14:44 - moving platform
14:45 - and let's move on to the next one so the
14:47 - next one is the blocks that damage slash
14:50 - kill you so what we want to do right now
14:52 - is we want to dig a
14:55 - hole that is two blocks deep so one
14:58 - two like so and then at the last
15:01 - at the bottom layer we fill in with lava
15:04 - and once we did this we should have just
15:06 - a trench of lava go go to global
15:08 - parameters go to
15:10 - uh
15:11 - controller
15:12 - component and then damaging blocks click
15:15 - add and
15:17 - search lava click on lava and it blocks
15:21 - the damage the block damage i will set
15:23 - this to 50 so it kind of kills fast um
15:26 - again if you want to like have a
15:27 - platformer uh then i would recommend
15:30 - setting us to 100 so you can kill extra
15:32 - fast but i said s50 for now because
15:36 - um i just want to show you that you can
15:37 - have it so that it takes like 50 damage
15:40 - and then 50 damage or you can have it
15:42 - 100 um again let me show you so here's
15:46 - the pillow lava
15:48 - i will jump in it you can see it takes
15:50 - with two ticks for me to die
15:52 - uh and yeah you can set it to 100 ticks
15:54 - one tick or anything you want
15:57 - but yeah that is how to make blocks that
16:00 - damage or kill you now let's move on to
16:02 - the next one which is displaying
16:04 - external nfts um right now we need a
16:06 - little inventory switch so click l
16:09 - uh drag the door out drag the
16:13 - key out
16:14 - uh we don't need the carpet anymore and
16:17 - then just travel over everything so
16:20 - put it like so move over everything now
16:23 - we have three uh
16:25 - empty slots which is perfect so we need
16:27 - the billboard so search a billboard and
16:30 - um get the billboard frame
16:33 - put that on slot number eight then get
16:35 - the
16:36 - uh the skeleton warrior so search up
16:38 - skeleton
16:40 - and get the skeleton warrior with the
16:41 - little power icon
16:43 - and once we did this uh we should have
16:45 - enough for everything we're gonna do so
16:48 - now let's bring in the billboard
16:52 - uh again there is no middle i'm pretty
16:54 - sure oh
16:55 - is there
16:57 - one one two three one two three four
17:01 - so that's the middle so we do have a
17:02 - middles um this one is the middle one
17:05 - two three four one two three four yeah
17:08 - right here is the middle so build a two
17:09 - by two right here um and then just stick
17:12 - the billboard on it it doesn't matter if
17:14 - it's crooked a little bit we'll get the
17:16 - rotate tool and you'll just rotate it
17:20 - one
17:21 - two
17:23 - like so and then the get the green
17:25 - access which is the
17:27 - what access is this it's the y rotation
17:30 - axis and there we go you have now
17:32 - created a billboard if it's glitching
17:34 - like this what we want to do is we just
17:36 - move it forward just a bit
17:39 - like so so now it's not too glitching or
17:42 - not glitching glitchy
17:44 - uh
17:45 - there we go
17:46 - and we can move it down just a bit
17:49 - okay once we have it like this what we
17:51 - want to do is we want to scroll down to
17:53 - image display right here we want to
17:55 - click out of it and add component nft
17:58 - image
17:59 - and now here comes a complicated part
18:02 - uh so not it's not too complicated but
18:05 - oops
18:07 - here so what we want to do is we want to
18:10 - go into
18:11 - google and reor your search engine and
18:13 - we want to do open c dot io
18:16 - open c dot io like so and once we did
18:19 - this we will click on explore
18:21 - right here
18:22 - and there's gonna be a bunch of art that
18:24 - we can use
18:25 - uh let me scroll down
18:28 - uh
18:29 - there is a bunch of art
18:32 - let me see what i want
18:35 - uh
18:36 - last time it was a
18:38 - a dog
18:39 - so i'll just get this pig because it
18:42 - looks pretty cool
18:43 - um yeah i'll grab this pig
18:46 - and what we want to do when we click
18:48 - into the
18:50 - art piece is we want to go to this share
18:53 - icon right here click on share
18:55 - click copy link right here
18:57 - and once it says link copied go back
18:59 - into the sandbox um
19:01 - again obs is having some problem with
19:03 - the sandbox but anyways once we're back
19:05 - in here we will go into the billboard
19:09 - and we'll go acid url click on that and
19:11 - then
19:12 - uh control v the url in here once you
19:15 - did that click validate and it will get
19:18 - you the image like so and now once the
19:20 - big images here click continue
19:22 - and scale mode we'll change that to fit
19:25 - to height
19:26 - and tab oh not yet tab
19:29 - there we go and now let's run back there
19:33 - and the pig should be there yay so here
19:35 - we have the pig with the balloon um yeah
19:38 - so this is how to display external nfts
19:40 - to use for your nft gallery
19:42 - uh let's move on to the next one which
19:44 - is
19:46 - uh
19:48 - trigger victory killing a boss
19:50 - let's leave that to the end because we
19:52 - don't want to
19:53 - uh have victory yet
19:56 - um and let's move to the next one quest
19:58 - setup from start to finish okay so let's
20:00 - have the quest so the quest is to um
20:05 - to have to collect all the silver keys
20:07 - so we're going to build a little parkour
20:09 - here so we have like this
20:11 - one there one two here
20:14 - one two
20:15 - just like so
20:17 - and once we did this we will just um can
20:20 - you make that jump i'm pretty sure you
20:21 - can we'll put keys on top uh shift will
20:24 - make it lock onto a block like so
20:29 - so hold shift in place
20:30 - and then we'll grab the selector tool
20:33 - and we'll just grab all of the keys and
20:36 - scroll down here to add components add
20:39 - collectible and inside of the tag we're
20:41 - going to put in silver
20:43 - like so
20:44 - um display name we're going to change to
20:46 - silver key
20:48 - and we leave behavior at none
20:51 - um then let's go back into rules add
20:54 - quest and rule and you will name this
20:56 - one
20:56 - uh collect
20:58 - the keys
21:00 - like so and in the description we're
21:02 - going to go uh
21:04 - grab all of the silver
21:08 - keys
21:09 - um
21:10 - and auto unlock we will
21:12 - we will put it as required message and
21:14 - the message is uh
21:16 - open
21:17 - so this one uh so that this one this
21:19 - quest will launch after we open the door
21:22 - or else there's just gonna be a bunch of
21:23 - quests that just launch in the beginning
21:25 - which we do not want so we will make
21:28 - this one after they completed the first
21:29 - one
21:30 - uh and after that we will go to quest
21:32 - type select as counter counter type
21:35 - collected objects uh the tag will be
21:37 - silver
21:39 - amount is three
21:40 - and auto completion is yes send message
21:43 - uh it's a bit glitchy as i said earlier
21:46 - because it's still in beta
21:48 - um so if if something happens like this
21:51 - where you can't reach the message then
21:53 - just try it again and it should work
21:56 - okay and now let's send the message as
21:58 - collect
22:00 - so add that if you don't have it then
22:02 - just click add collect and you should be
22:04 - good
22:04 - once we are done with this we'll close
22:06 - this up and we will play so please tap
22:10 - again so right now we only have one
22:13 - quest so it's just open the door click
22:15 - gold key and open the door click this
22:17 - and it'll open
22:19 - um another one is and as you can see
22:22 - that pop it just popped up grab all of
22:24 - the silver keys so
22:26 - let's grab all the silver keys
22:29 - like so and you can see it is going up
22:32 - um
22:33 - the silver keys getting thing is going
22:35 - up
22:36 - oh i can't seem to parkour
22:38 - today okay
22:40 - then we'll try again
22:43 - imagine i can't do this um
22:45 - there you go so once you got all three
22:47 - uh it will complete the quest and now
22:50 - let's move on to the next to last one
22:52 - which is to have
22:54 - things that damage and heal you so
22:58 - the victory trigger will heal you and
23:01 - the void will hurt you so let's build a
23:03 - barrier here so they can't escape
23:05 - um and let's put a ladder on the outside
23:08 - and inside so
23:09 - outside ladder
23:11 - turn it around
23:14 - like so now we have two ladders and we
23:17 - will highlight both of the ladders make
23:19 - sure you don't highlight anything else
23:21 - and add component
23:22 - and climb a bowl so now you can climb
23:24 - them
23:25 - and now let's grab these two and we will
23:28 - move them to the center uh we will now
23:31 - now look at the void and instead of
23:33 - having the behavior as void we will have
23:35 - it as a melee enemy so now it will hurt
23:38 - you
23:39 - and uh we will have the button oh wait
23:43 - no not button sorry
23:44 - let's go back to the void really quickly
23:46 - we want to add the component as
23:48 - health so we can actually kill it
23:51 - i will set this to
23:53 - uh
23:55 - to
23:55 - where is it five
23:57 - or i'll just type it in
23:59 - five and so that we can one shot it uh
24:02 - and then here the melee enemy not the
24:05 - melee enemy the healer will have the
24:08 - behavior
24:09 - as none
24:11 - and we will have the component as
24:14 - uh
24:14 - wait never mind we want the behavior as
24:17 - healer um
24:19 - so the walking speed is zero
24:21 - and we want the component to be
24:26 - we don't actually need the component
24:27 - because we're not going to kill this
24:28 - thing so if we were to tab again we
24:31 - should be able to
24:32 - go
24:33 - and get hurt
24:35 - it sounds very wrong but yeah
24:37 - now the ladder should be climbable hey
24:40 - there we go all right so now it hurts us
24:42 - and we kill it and this thing heals us
24:44 - yay there we go
24:46 - we can climb back out okay perfect so
24:49 - once we did this we're gonna go to the
24:50 - final boss um which is a skeleton so put
24:54 - it in like so and let's create a little
24:56 - barrier uh
24:58 - like the same thing we did over there
25:01 - okay
25:04 - um
25:07 - oh why is the like at the end not
25:10 - like good it's okay i'll just replace it
25:13 - oh
25:14 - oh it is good it's just transparent okay
25:17 - so once we did this oh no okay once we
25:20 - did this we're just going to highlight
25:21 - the skeleton we're going to put the
25:23 - behavior as
25:25 - a melee enemy we're going to put the
25:28 - health at 50
25:30 - and we're going to click on edit logic
25:32 - and we will go can block attack to true
25:35 - this means it will it can block our hits
25:39 - when we want to hit it let's make the
25:40 - attack range a bit further so it can be
25:43 - more powerful
25:44 - um
25:46 - and
25:47 - that is it uh we can also add one more
25:49 - component which is victory and we will
25:52 - say on
25:54 - death
25:55 - uh it'll have victory so tab um now
25:58 - let's complete the first one which is
26:00 - open the door
26:01 - okay and then open the door the second
26:03 - one is to just ride this thing
26:06 - okay
26:07 - and just die from the lava then
26:09 - all right so once we did this we will go
26:11 - to the final boss i don't know why i did
26:13 - those three but let's go back to the
26:15 - final boss um so let's climb the ladders
26:18 - oh it made the ladders not climbable so
26:21 - let's make it climbable
26:23 - the
26:23 - behaviors add component
26:25 - climb a bowl and let's just run to the
26:28 - oops
26:29 - run to the
26:30 - um skeleton
26:34 - okay
26:36 - there you go oh oh it's a little glitchy
26:38 - but okay there we go now you can see
26:40 - that the skeleton can attack pretty far
26:41 - so if we were to try hiding the corner
26:44 - i think the skeleton can still reach us
26:46 - yeah it can still reach us definitely so
26:48 - it is more powerful and if we try to
26:50 - attack it normally
26:52 - um let me
26:53 - be down there okay if we try to attack
26:55 - it normally they block all our hits so
26:58 - what we need to do is we need to get a
26:59 - perfect parry like so and then after
27:02 - that we can do some damage to it
27:04 - uh
27:05 - okay there we go okay
27:07 - and then we win
27:08 - so that is how to
27:10 - do the beginner tutorials um again i
27:13 - will update you if i know how to do the
27:16 - teleporting but anyways i hope you all
27:18 - have a good day and that is it for
27:20 - today's video see you next one bye
