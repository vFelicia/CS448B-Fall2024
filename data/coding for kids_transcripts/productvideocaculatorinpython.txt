00:00 - hello my name is jemmy today i'm making
00:02 - a product calculator
00:04 - with the bat so um as you can see
00:07 - it's really simple first of all we're
00:09 - going to import all this
00:11 - um which is default so like the tk inter
00:14 - and the ttk then the message box so we
00:17 - there's a message box so we could um
00:19 - make our program
00:20 - and then for the gui go to tk uh
00:24 - yeah put all this stuff in for gui dot
00:26 - title this is for
00:28 - what we're going to um like name our
00:31 - window then we're going to set how
00:33 - bigger when it's going to be so right
00:34 - now it's 400 times 300
00:36 - after that we're going to set the font
00:38 - to end standard new which everybody
00:40 - should have
00:41 - so we don't get like we have to download
00:43 - font just use this one
00:45 - and then um this is to put in a text
00:48 - um explaining what they have to do so
00:51 - they have to enter their product
00:53 - name um so like what their product like
00:56 - product name is like coffee
01:08 - [Music]
01:10 - or
01:13 - [Music]
01:35 - um chocolate and then this one
01:39 - is uh to print it i'm pretty sure yeah
01:42 - and then e1 equal ttk this one
01:46 - is to set uh the i think it's how
01:50 - big the text box is yeah the text box
01:53 - and then l equal to ttk.label this is
01:56 - another
01:56 - um text it says enter your product price
02:00 - so it's like how expensive your product
02:02 - is
02:03 - and the last one is to enter your
02:05 - product amount so how much you're gonna
02:06 - buy
02:07 - after that oh sorry this one's for
02:09 - testing hold on let's look at this
02:12 - watch too much techno blade um so define
02:15 - math so now we're going to calculate the
02:17 - name of the product i mean we're not
02:19 - calculating it
02:20 - but we're going to calculate the price
02:21 - of all products
02:23 - um excluding the vat that of a single
02:25 - product and fat of all product and total
02:27 - of all products
02:28 - so yeah what we're gonna do here is
02:30 - we're going to
02:32 - um uh right here we're just going to
02:35 - print the name and the price and the
02:36 - amount normally
02:37 - then down here we're going to uh
02:40 - calculate the
02:41 - um the price of all product which is two
02:44 - times the price and the amount
02:45 - and it would equal to uh right
02:49 - here the formula is price times amount
02:52 - as i said
02:52 - and remember to convert them into
02:54 - integers or
02:56 - floats because um one is that
03:00 - this is a string right now so we have to
03:02 - convert them
03:03 - and now in here is to
03:06 - uh like to calculate the bat
03:10 - so instead of using uh normal integers
03:14 - right now we're going to use um float
03:18 - because
03:18 - some fats are going down to decimals so
03:21 - use a float instead of integer because
03:23 - it will be more um precise and it can
03:27 - do decimals because integers can and
03:29 - floats can
03:30 - after that we're going to w that which
03:32 - is the whole vat
03:34 - so we're figuring out the vat of one
03:37 - uh my single product right now we're
03:39 - going to get that uh
03:40 - that and then times the amount again so
03:42 - now we're going to get the whole
03:45 - bat after that we're going to add the
03:47 - vat
03:48 - plus the mold on the overall price
03:52 - which would equal to
03:55 - w vat plus mole price which is
03:59 - every uh the price times the amount
04:02 - so yeah that's pretty simple and then
04:04 - after that we get a button
04:05 - saying calculate and um
04:08 - command goes to math which is right here
04:10 - since we defined it
04:12 - and set how big the button is so let's
04:15 - test it okay so we're going to start out
04:18 - we're going to make it really simple
04:20 - cause we don't want it that hard
04:22 - so pretend coffee okay
04:25 - right and then in here what do we want
04:28 - um
04:29 - so i know this calculation that's why
04:31 - i'm doing it
04:32 - so product price is a hundred and
04:36 - um the amount is one
04:39 - so here we are that of single product is
04:42 - seven
04:42 - and overall is seven because we only
04:44 - have one product and overall
04:46 - in total is 107. this is very useful if
04:50 - you want to like calculate how expensive
04:52 - your
04:53 - um like online how to call it online
04:57 - marketing or shopping is going to be so
05:00 - yeah make this program
05:01 - and you would calculate it not using
05:03 - your head because i'm too lazy to that
05:06 - yeah and this all this is based on my
05:08 - wikipedia video i used it and i used the
05:11 - code
05:12 - and made this so yep remember that
05:16 - uh you can always use from other
05:18 - programs
05:19 - to develop your own programs even
05:21 - further and that's it for this video
05:23 - see you next episode bye
