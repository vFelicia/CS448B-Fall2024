hey this is gretchen i am going to go over conditions or if then statements we're going to start in smee board and lesson if then roll so conditions are an exception to a rule they allow your code to become more dynamic so for example if there was a password and if you get the password correct then the computer will allow you to enter the program if you get it wrong then it'll tell you to try again encodable conditions are represented by colored tiles they're all different colors so the rule is fuzz is gonna roll until it hits a wall uh the exception would be if the tile is purple then go down so i'm gonna show you how we're gonna program him to do that so we're gonna go forward first and we're gonna go down we're gonna use this purple tile here to tell him to go down at the purple tile on the map so we're going to say if the tile is purple then go down we do that by putting the purple tile underneath the down arrow then we're going to go forward so let's see what happens when we do that yay we did it awesome so that's how conditions are used and codable if you have any questions you can always take a look at the codable learning guide
