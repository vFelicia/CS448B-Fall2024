whoohoo let's go hi I'm Doreen I'm the director of curriculum at codable the short video is going to introduce you to the concept you'll be teaching in this unit thanks for watching as programmers we're in control of every action a computer carries out once commands are given to a computer in the correct sequence we can add another element to our code that will alter the computer programs path condition conditions are basic if the logic statements that modify how code is executed conditions are a key part of the decision making process for computers conditional statements are part of our everyday lives as people we can think about situations and make decisions based on what we observe or know to be true for example if it's raining out then we will have recess inside or if it's my birthday then I can have birthday cake conditions are causeandeffect if this then that since computers are machines that can't do anything without us directing them we direct the computer using conditional statements this tells the computer what to do and when to do it in the conditions on screen independent practice lessons students will use colored tiles as conditions to alter the path of their fuzz for example if the tile is pink then go down in programming a great example of a condition is a password passwords are ifthen logic statements if a user enters the correct password then they can access the program conditions allow us to control what a program does and perform different actions based on these ifs and logic statements what makes computer programs great is their ability to interact with the user this is only possible with conditions that direct this type of interaction
