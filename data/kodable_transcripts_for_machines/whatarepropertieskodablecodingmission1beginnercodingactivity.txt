this is the fuzz family you might notice that no two fuzzes look exactly the same some have blue eyes some are rainbow some are different accessories just from looking you can tell that blue is different from Prism but how they look different because they have different properties a property is a feature or characteristic belonging to something you have properties that make you human like hands ears and a nose fuzzes have properties too they have a body eyes and a mouth fuzzes share many properties but they might look different from fuzz to fuzz all fuzzes have a body color body color is a property but you can change the body color for example the body color for blue fuzz is blue while the body color for Simon is green you try what's the body color of Shaggy here I go what about princess properties are important because they help us tell all the fuzzes apart today you are going to explore fuzz properties and choose from different categories to build your own fuzz this is the fuzz Builder at the bottom you'll see five categories here's your mission build your own fuzz character using three properties and two functions okay how can you do this first look through all the categories then select your items make sure you count your lines of code you should be adding five lines to the existing code for example if I only choose a body and eyes then I've selected properties from two categories and have added two lines of code and a silly looking fuzz that's incomplete you can fix that by building the rest of your fuzz when you're done compare your fuzz to someone else's are your fuzzes the same what is similar about your fuzz's properties what is different now it's your turn open fuzz Builder build a fuzz and complete your mission you're looking to use three properties and two functions good luck
