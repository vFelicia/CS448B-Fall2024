you've probably heard that math is a part of our lives everywhere and that's true for example think about how much math goes into just this cookie you use math when you measure things count things figure out what shape something is or cut it in half but have you ever noticed the math skills you use when you practice coding think about the way you solve a math problem like this there are ordered steps to follow i should solve this problem moving left to right along the way i need to make careful decisions and at the end i will double check my work these are some of the same skills you use when you are coding today you're going to use math skills to design and build your own game level in codables maze maker here's your mission build a maze that includes the shape of a square how many tiles make up each side of your square if i want to build a maze i need to plan ahead first i'll pick a background there are a lot of other tools to choose from i can draw my maze erase if i make a mistake decorations condition tiles and test the maze i'm going to start with the maze tiles do you notice the individual tiles that appear wherever i click we can use them to help us count add subtract and make certain shapes let's practice this mission together remember your coding mission is to design a maze that includes the shape of a square so i'm going to start by drawing my square we know that a square has sides that are all the same length i think i want my square to have five tiles per side one two three four five one two three four five but this square is not a maze yet i need to connect the square to each side of the maze maker notice how the start tile appears in the far left column and the end tile on the right it's time to place the stars in my maze to make sure it's solvable i'm ready to test my maze i need my fuzz to collect all three stars and get to the finish so i want my fuzz to move right down right up right let's try it don't worry if you can't solve it on the first try just try again at the start of my square i want my fuzz to turn down but we know our fuzz will continue to roll to the right until it hits a wall we need something right here in our maze to tell our fuzz to change directions good news is we can always go back and edit the maze these are condition tiles we can use them to change our fuzz's path in our program i'm going to put one right here that will tell my fuzz if pink then turn down now that i've edited my maze i'm ready to try again can't forget to add that condition to the program if pink then turn down we did it remember in programming and in math we test we make fixes and try again until the problem is solved now i can save my maze you're up next log in to codable select the maze maker and complete your mission build a maze that includes the shape of a square how many tiles make up each side of your square get creative and happy coding
