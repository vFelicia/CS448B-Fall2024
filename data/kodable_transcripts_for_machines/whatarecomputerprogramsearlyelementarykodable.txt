on a computer you can do all sorts of things play games do your homework watch videos all of these things are done using computer programs a computer program is a set of instructions that a computer follows to complete a task you can see computer programs and action all around you they control things like cell phones coffee makers cars microwaves washing machines gaming consoles if we didn't have computer programs these things that we use every day would not be the same most of them wouldn't even exist so computer programs are important and help control a lot of the devices and machines that we use every day but what are these programs made from computer programs are made out of their own special computer language called code a computer can't think for itself and you can't talk to it like a person this is because computers don't understand the same language that you speak computers only understand code if we want a computer to do something like make a game you can't just tell it to you need to give the computer stepbystep instructions for how to make the game in a language it understands code computers need code to do pretty much anything computer code is usually made out of words and numbers like this programmers like you are people who learn how to put these words and numbers in order so your computer can follow your instructions and know what to do Ince me Borg your fuzz character acts just like a computer your fuzz can't think for itself and needs a programmer like you to tell it what to do whatever commands you choose to write in your program your fuzz will follow them exactly from the first command to the last one as the programmer you will decide what instructions to give your fuzz so it knows where to roll and how to move let's get coding
