let's go let's plan a party there's a lot of stuff that goes into it you need to decide what food to serve songs to play and who to invite when you're planning something like this how do you keep track of everything you need you might group all these items into lists grocery list playlist guest list all of these lists help you keep related information together and organized of course we use lists every day not just when we're planning a party they can help us decide what's most important and think about the big picture lists are helpful for keeping code organized too in javascript a list is called an array you can store related pieces of data together in one place within a program so why is this important remember encoding a variable is useful for storing a single value that can change but as we collect more information keeping variables organized can be tricky for example let's say you want to create a program to keep track of the names of all your party guests for the first friend you could create a variable and store their name as a string like this and for a few names this is no big deal but what if you wanted to invite everyone in your class or school do you even know how many people go to your school it would be really hard to keep track of so many variables especially if you don't know the number of names ahead of time instead use an array an array is like a container that keeps similar things together in a single ordered list the container can grow or shrink to fit the number of items inside you might think of an array like a connected row of numbered boxes each box can have one thing in it just like you can assign a single value to a variable you can store an entire array of values in a variable too this list is only four items long but in code it could be hundreds or thousands of values in javascript an array looks like this values separated by commas and stored in brackets these are all strings but an array can also store integers or both once you create the array you can add items to your list or remove them the order that you store the values will stay the same making it easy for you to know where each item is located on the list let's look at how arrays show up in codable in order for our fuzz to reach the end of the maze it needs to be able to roll through this tunnel but the tunnel door is closed we need to find a key that will open it let's try coating our fuzz to roll through the maze and pick up a key along the way our fuzz collected a triangle key but the tunnel needs a short list of keys to open first diamond then triangle in order to unlock this tunnel we need to create an array remember in the array the order of the list item matters the tunnel shows diamond first triangle second so we need to code our fuzz to collect the keys in the same order any keys we collect will be stored here inside the array brackets let's go first diamond then triangle and we did it the array values are equal and our fuzz can roll through
