hey everyone this is Gretchen with codable I'm here with Bree gray our curriculum director and we are so excited for the new school year uh we are thrilled to have you all here and we are excited to walk you through some of the changes that we've made to codable over the past year but also to just if you're new to codable walk you through your dashboard uh get you all set up and make sure that you're good to go for the new year so um with that I'm gonna let Brie Take the Lead yeah um so we're gonna start um we're gonna Dive Right In and talk about adding your first class and setting your class up um and then we'll do a dashboard tour uh we can show you some of our new features we're really excited today we announced our lesson Library um so we have some exciting new lessons stuff to talk about and then we'll talk about game updates and share some resources with you so we'll Dive Right In Here to setting up our first class okay so we are on the top we're going to start again and talk about adding a glass um so we will add our class and again we're going to name this webinar so here is where you will decide the pacing that your students will be on you can change this later but this is how you'll manage the content that your students have access to so if you want everything to be open for your students you would do a K through five option if you have a Kindergarten class and you want them on our kindergarten pacing that would be this option so whatever grade level you choose will be the only content that they have access to and we'll talk more about how you can manage what they have access to within that grade level but the only only the grade level you choose will be what you have access to if you want to import students in bulk you can do that here and if you have Google classrooms you can do that by clicking here so let's continue we're going to add myself and Gretchen as students to this class so here you'll see that we've generated some options for class codes um if you have younger students you'll notice these would not be easy to remember so we actually have a tip of the week video that Gretchen will be sharing um just on creating an easy to remember class code and going over some naming structures there so I'm going to make our class code webinar for this class because it's easy to remember we will continue so this is where the grade level and the pacing stuff comes into play so we used to have playlists and I'm sure some of you remember that you loved that you could stop students from accessing things you have not taught yet um if you still want to use that feature where you only have students on the levels that you have taught the lessons for you would click assign lessons manually if you want everything open for a free play situation you would click I want to assign all now I will note again that whatever grade level you chose when you say all you're only choosing for that grade so if you want everything you would do K through five if you made a second grade class and you click all that all only means all of the second grade content this can be changed later when you click on manage class which we'll get to but for now I'm going to do I want to assign lessons manually there you go I think can everyone see our cursor all right it's waving okay great so I'm going to go to our dashboard so we're on the second grade pacing these are all of the lessons that are aligned with second grade um this again can be changed later so um so as we talked about if you want to change your pacing say you decide you want your second graders to have access to some first grade stuff or some third grade content you can go to K through five and you'll see that that changes what they have access to and if you want to change how your assigning levels you can go to manage class and you'll see down here you can assign all practice levels and if you've already done that and you don't want it that way you can unassign practice level s here we're going to go back so if you've chosen to assign levels manually you'll do that directly from a lesson plan so let's just click on our first lesson plan and you'll see assigned practice levels here if you don't click on this and you've chosen to assign levels manually your students when they log into the game will not have access to any lessons so as soon as you click this that will be what shows up on their devices so we're going to start talking a little bit about um the lesson plan since we have them up here so all of our lesson plans are designed to follow all of our lesson plans are designed to follow a gradual release model so that's the I do we do you do structure so I'm going to open these tabs so we can see more in our lesson plan and if you've never seen one of our lesson plans before we'll look on the left so this is where you'll see the name for the lesson plan you can print directly from your teacher dashboard any materials which you'll see listed here you can download by clicking here and again you can assign the practice lessons here are the learning objectives so in this lesson students will be able to explain what a programmer does students will be able to move a robot forward Spin and jump using basic programming language if we click here you'll see our standards listed which we'll talk about a bit more um and you'll see vocabulary for the lesson I'm going to pause for just a second because I'm getting some feedback that it's a little small hard to see see if we can make this better command plus Lizzie can you get that improve things quite a bit for everybody and see about our cursor here okay I think that we've had that yeah show cursor okay so we should be all set great sorry no problem okay so we will walk through the structure of our lesson plans um all of the codable lesson plans that are aligned with our game levels follow the idea we do you do structure and a little bit we're going to introduce our lesson Library which is more flexible um there are many lessons there are more free form openended there's a lot of resources that are not following this structure but for our lessons that are aligned with our standards and our game they do follow this so for direct instruction this is where you'll introduce the programming Concepts including all the vocabulary and this is usually about 10 to 15 minutes long after direct instruction you'll move into a guided practice activity um this is either whole group or in pairs and usually has some materials like I said they're all included here um students will be working collaboratively and applying the concept off screen before they work on screen so so after the guided practice activity which is about 20 minutes students will move into the independent practice portions this is where they'll apply the concept completely independently this is in the game so students will get on the app or play at game.codable.com and use that class code up here this is our class code students will log in with that class code and choose their name from the class list to play and do their independent practice and every quotable lesson ends with an exit ticket or some kind of informal assessment you can also assign practice levels at the bottom of each lesson plan all right I'm going to try our cursor one more time guys I've got all the settings clicked so I'm not really sure what's going on okay I want to see that you can just click on that um okay so we're gonna just voice out what we're what we're clicking on I don't know okay for anybody who is considering the wirecast play streaming service through uh YouTube not going to give it five stars um so yeah so we have our it's supposed to be showing our cursor but it's not showing up so we'll have to do some troubleshooting we want to use this again but for now we're just gonna say like what button we're clicking on um and when we highlight it it should change color do some sort of action um Bree if you're pointing to actual text like it shouldn't highlight it for them that should help sure okay we're actually coming off of this lesson plan to the top of your page so you'll see it should have just highlighted orange my classes lesson Library students progress and admin so we're just going to talk a little bit about some of the tabs that you see at the top um and what they do before we get into the lesson Library which we're super excited to talk about um actually we had a question from Maureen she asked um can you share students with another teacher and so actually Maureen uh right now that's just it's a codable school feature so um if you're a paid user of codable then you have the option to create admins and they can actually see you know all of the students and teachers within your school and set up classes for people and monitor student progress and all kinds of things like that from an admin level but uh on the free version it's not an option to link accounts and share classes with other teachers so we do have that option it's just part of our paid program cool so my classes is where we started and this is where you'll do anything to manage your classes so you'll see we have a list of classes um I know you cannot see my cursor so I'm hovering over the class names here and I'm going to click under first grade on grade one just to show you an example and this should look familiar because we saw this when we created our first class I just want to show you how you can manage by clicking manage class this is where you can add students this green add students button transfer class roster if you want to switch this class roster to another class so maybe you had a second grade class and they went to third grade and you want to move your first grade class now into second grade you could do that by clicking transfer class and selecting where you'd like to move it um we're not going to do that right now and here this purple print parent instructions button will download a handout for you to send home um with a student code for each student they can log in and practice at home if you want to make any changes to the class if you look on the right side of this page you'll see edit class class name you can change it anytime class code say you think you know I 6 k v m ZN is too hard to remember you could change it there if a new teacher is taking over the class you could change the teacher here again this is part of the admin feature so say I was an admin at my school and right now I have it assigned to me but I want to make sure that um Miss eatsam has has access to her class I could just change it to her um and change the teacher and then she could now access this from her teacher dashboard and view all of the students and all the student progress and manage her class from there so it's really nice if you're setting up classes for other teachers in your organization to have that feature available to you and again with this grade level option down here if you change the grade level it will change the pacing so your your students will have access you and your students will have access to different material depending on what grade level you choose and I know we mentioned before about assigning all practice levels at once this orange button and on assigning practice levels and that's where you can manage if your students have you know a freeforall situation where they can just kind of play through you'd want to assign all but again if you want to assign from the lesson plan like we just talked about you would want to do that manually so we are going to go back up to the top of the page and we're going to click on students should highlight Orange this is where you'll see all students that you have listed um you can filter by class to search for a student you can just type a student into the search you can transfer students you can delete students you can create new students by clicking the green create new student button and adding them to a class of your choice you can print parent instructions or you can import an existing student so if you have a student that already has an account you would click import student and enter their code and name and select a class to add them to here we have the progress bar at the top this orange progress button when we click here this loads the progress for all of your classes so if you want to look at a class progress um just per class you would click this middle class progress view button and you can select a class from your list so let's see who might have progress here we'll look at hour of code and we can see how far we are through the lesson plans how many programs have been written so that's how many levels students have played through and how students are progressing through each unit all right so now we are going to go to back to the top and go to lesson Library please ready in the past few weeks for back to school so we're super excited about this um so the lesson library is great because as the curriculum developer here it gives us the freedom to collaborate with other teachers and to write coding lessons that include content areas that are not something that we've we have in our full curriculum so now we have lessons that include math Ela we have a robotics unit and we have the freedom really to create coding lessons out of any discipline so we are going to start by looking on the left hand side under filters this is kind of a way for you to search as though you're shopping so if you're online shopping and you know what you're looking for you typically use a filter right you're not going to search for shoes if you're looking for shirts so this can really help you narrow down your search we have a lot of lessons and we're going to be adding more um super excited that teachers can also submit their own lessons so if you have your own I'll show you how to do that um but just for this purpose I really want to show you our new robotics unit so I'm going to go to content area robotics and you'll see that it loads our new robotics units so we're super excited that we partnered with Wonder workshop and I'm sure you're all fans of Dash and dots yes Dash and Dot are now part of the codable family so I will click on our first one just to give you guys a little Snippets so what's great about the lesson library is you can save these lessons so you'll browse like a catalog it's not going to show up on your dashboard these lessons unless you explicitly search or save them um and you can add them to what you already have via our pacing so if you've created a second grade class and you're on second grade pasting you definitely have those lessons saved but if you want to teach a robotics unit you can add that to what you already have so by clicking save this lesson I can then choose a class to save it too I'm going to save this to our webinar class and you'll see that it highlights and hovers when you hover it it'll highlight and you can save and now this lesson is saved to our class so we can add any kind of coding lesson we want or we can just stick to the codable curriculum um I'm going to go back to the lesson library though and show you so this Banner at the top is our featured unit obviously it's back to school so we're featuring back to school lessons and I want to show these two because there's a good example of um coding lessons that you can teach unplugged your first couple weeks of school so the new lesson in the lesson Library um are not linked to game content so these are the idea of the lesson libraries for coding to be taught every day um and you can do that in a variety of ways and that's what we're trying to to do we're trying to spread awareness that coding is everywhere and also that you know you can integrate coding into what you're already doing so we're going to take a look at our first back to school lesson so this is a kindergarten lesson but so I'm going to interrupt you for sure we had a question about the lesson Library Maureen was asking if this is premium only or can anybody access it so it's free to everybody to use um you'll see in I'm gonna just go back to it for just a second um you'll see so lessons that are free to use have no icon special icon on them um but if I was to click on third grade um you'll see some have codable school so those are our paid lessons those are part of our paid curriculum so anything that doesn't have that icon you can use completely free um and add it to any of your classes which is awesome okay so we'll go back to this it's a kindergarten lesson um just because of the activity that we chose but you can use this as a template um and you can really run with it and use your own classroom procedures to teach coding in the same way so I'm going to save this lesson to a Kindergarten class because I want to use it for kindergarten so that will be added to that kindergarten class so in this lesson students will be able to follow a sequence of steps related to classroom procedures and programming so this lesson introduces the concept of sequence and following steps and breaking tasks down into steps um and we used hand washing as an example but I'm sure that you can think of 100 classroom procedures that you can break down and train students to follow in a sequence and relate to programming so in this particular lesson students are following a sequence of steps they're using those sight words first next then and last and they're practicing a classroom procedure that will be used every day in their classroom um and the materials that go with it just like our other lessons are available for download as well do we have a question uh nope that's great I think we're good so you guys can feel free to oh we do have a question uh can you say the lesson to multiple classes you can yeah so say um actually you can see Pinterest too yeah so uh Brie was saving this to Blue uh to test but actually I had already saved it to my blue class so you can see you can remove it from here as well um so if I wanted to assign it to all of my kindergarten classes say I would just hover over the next generation and save it to them and so it's actually saved to all of my kindergarten classes so I can be sure to go over coding and classroom procedures with all of my Kinders so yes great so we're going to get into talking about the game and some updates we've made over the summer to the game but before we do that I just want to note that the codable lessons um that exist on your dashboard already as part of our curriculum you can assign or you can pin and save them but um those are linked to game content other lessons in the lesson Library are not so I got a question this week from a teacher who was wondering where the online content was for some of these lesson Library lessons and there's actually not game content so it's just important to note that if you don't see it listed in the lesson plan it does not go with um specific game content although you can have obviously your students practice sequence after they do you know this hand watching lesson because that makes sense but it's just not explicitly going to say do this lesson online so we are going to move into the game I just want to make sure I didn't miss anything sure uh we also have a question from mum bugs who asks if um we should so she has some students who have never been doing any coding before um she didn't say what grade they're in but uh she said should they start at a kindergarten level and that's a great question and something we get a lot um so actually I'll share our our recommended pacing for your first year of coding uh in the chat but we recommend that everyone start at the kindergarten level if you have not done any coding before and you're just your older students are just going to move at a little bit of an accelerated pace so they may not need to spend nearly as long learning about sequence as your kindergarteners would however it is important just like you know if you were learning to read for the first time in fifth grade you would still need to learn your ABCs you would need to learn about sentence structure and about um the sounds of words and everything like that so um it's the same thing for coding we need everybody to start from the beginning so yes I would suggest a kindergarten and starting with the kindergarten content but if you assign a fifth grade class um encodable it will automatically put them on that year one pacing and then it'll just Mark things off as you go through codable um So eventually they'll get up to the fifth grade content so yeah thanks for the question great so we are going to move to the game content so if you have students um working in the app on an iPad uh make sure that you update your apps because we've made a lot of changes and we want you to have access to all the awesome news stuff in our latest release so update your apps on your iPads um and if you are playing on the web again it's game.codile.com so you can access um the onscreen lessons either way so we're going to enter our class code um use a different great and one recommendation that I do have which is also a video resource we'll be sharing as a teaching tip is to make yourself a teacher profile so I'm on a teacher profile right now and what that means is every lesson is unlocked already so if I want to help a student who's in Australia I don't have to play all the way through planet smeeborg to be able to help them with the level that they're on so I can see what they have access to and um yeah I can hop around and Skip around levels and work with students and it's just super important for teachers to be able to see exactly what it is that students are working on um no matter what level they're at so I'm going to navigate us over here to our awesome fuzz in his spaceship or her I'm not sure in their spaceship and we are going to explore our new ship control panel actually first do you mind if we go through um like just one level of sequence but sure people can see yeah uh just to kind of get everybody familiar with what codable looks like if you're just starting out with your students say this is your first year teaching you just taught your first lesson on whether it's hand washing sequence um the fuzz family frenzy whatever it may be and your students are just getting started in the game um when they first log in they can click play and it'll take them automatically to the levels that have been assigned to them um you can also take them to the very first level of sequence um and that's where they will be starting and so what we have them starting out with is just very simple you know putting arrows in the correct order to get their fuzz through the Maze and we work them all the way up from this to writing in JavaScript in fifth grade so going over object oriented programming with actual syntax and instantiating objects and all kinds of crazy things and all of your teacher materials will actually explain those Concepts to you before you go in to teach your first class um but yeah so if you're following the codable track as as far as that pacing guide that I just sent goes students will start here in a very simple maze but then it quickly gets diffic more and more difficult and working them up to JavaScript so but we actually have been hard at work adding some creative content which is what breed's going to take over talking about for those who are new um so we're going to go back to our new openended creative content so we added two new um I guess features here um we have this I'm hovering over I don't think you can see my arrow in the middle this maze is build your own maze called our maze maker and then this green pick a fuzz you can build your own fuzz we're going to start with maze maker um so we I would recommend using the maze maker for K through two students and build your own fuzz for upper grade students that being said what what Gretchen just mentioned about you know if upper grade students don't have coding experience then in this case I would say maze maker so this is more for beginner coders um who have not had experience yet with sequence or conditions or loops and functions because that is what they'll be doing in maze maker build your own fuzz has a lot of JavaScript syntax we talk about variables and properties and um that's much more advanced and I need this Foundation First so that should be kept in mind with our creative content um I'm gonna pause for one second we've got quite a few questions sure uh Maureen asks do you find that kids need a refresher to get back up to speed or can they easily pick up where they left off if you're coming in for the new year um and say they haven't been doing any coding over the summer I would suggest maybe one or two lessons of refresher um if you look at the different grades for beyond your first year in that pacing guide that I showed you you can tell it's sort of stacked um and scaffolded so there's about um maybe like a half a unit of review on the last concept that they learned in the school year the year before um but I think you'll find that students pick it up pretty quickly um after some light Refresher um and then we have a question from Carla who oh sorry Tracy is 7.3.5 the most recent version um I am not certain about that actually I will double check for you Tracy uh and I'll post it in the chat um Carla asks do your students have to say when they exit the game or does it save for them uh so it saves for them so if you're using the web version and you just have them exit it will save um and then whenever they come back using their class code um it'll have all of their progress saved the same with the app so if you're using codable on the iPad you it'll save all of their progress locally on the device and then when that device is connected to the internet it'll send it to us and then anytime they log in with their class code their progress would be saved so yes we save automatically any other questions before we we have a question from 777 a a n g and they ask how do you update the app in iPads so um if you're using configurator for your school um your it person will probably be able to set that up for you it's a way to like Mass update all of your iPads otherwise if you go to the App Store you should be able to see your updates there it'll tell you how many updates you have and if it doesn't say that there's an update available for codable then you're on the latest version great all right so we're going to get back to maze maker um again it's it's best for beginners who are looking to build that foundation and it's awesome for assessment so if you want to test what your students can do this is a great way to have them build their own problems and solve their own problems so it's almost like they're working backwards and we'll get into that um it's also super fun and Visually appealing so that's another added bonus we're going to pick an awesome binary code background kids love also creating mazes and challenging one another we had some kids in the office who were having a blast making Unstoppable mazes for each other and so just like our curriculum is scaffolded um students will not be able to add loops and functions until they're there in the game so this will unlock the maze maker um let's start I'm looking for elements will unlock as they move through right so we're going to start by dragging some tiles I'm not really thinking this out which I don't recommend because students should be thinking critically and planning it um this is just going to be a simple example and then I can add awesome decoration um as I please and then I can lay out the star path so the stars mean the maze has to be solved um correctly oops so if I were to place a star in a more complex puzzle um that wasn't the best way to solve the maze then all three stars would not be earned which means I didn't solve this puzzle most efficiently this is a basic puzzle though this up here this pink button I don't think you can see me hovering over it at click on it is the Eraser um just in case you need to erase so once we build our maze I'm going to add one condition tile s we can test so we need to go right down so you can see this is sort of similar to uh the game that I was showing you earlier if you're new to codable um this is sort of just a play on our classic amazing maze puzzle game um and in this particular maze that Bree's created we're learning all about sequins and a little bit about conditions so here there's a pink condition tile so what this means is if I hit a pink tile then I go right so I have to put our condition down and then the arrow on top and now we'll test our names to do that all right and so we created and solved a maze and so I'm gonna go back just for time's sake and see if there are any questions about maze knicker before we move on to building our own fuzz um or nope Let's see we have a question from Jane Malone Miller are the lessons with bebot or blue bot robots they are with Dash and Dot robot uh which are from Wonder Workshop uh and but but the way that Bree wrote them uh was intended for them to be easily adaptable to whatever robots you have in your classroom so they were specifically designed for Dash and Dot but say you have bbots um or some other robot in your classroom say a Sphero or something I think you could easily adapt it um to solve the same yeah it would take a little um work to adapt it a little bit of time just because the Wonder Workshop app and robots are used and um they're going to be different from vbots and things like that but the actual content um and teaching is totally applicable to any robot so the activities use those robots um that might be where you need to switch it up a little but the actual instruction I think will will apply all right so we are going to one more question from Tracy Williams do you recommend starting over each year my first grade students moved really quickly last year and most have done all of smeborg and Astoria I don't feel like they are ready for bug world um yes first graders I don't recommend putting into bug world uh unless you have one who one or two in your class you feel are like totally ready for that it is definitely a fifth grade concept especially if you're not teaching the content like if you're not planning on using the lessons and you just want them going through the game it is not recommended it is it's pretty complicated stuff I mean they're doing they're writing JavaScript so I would say um holding off on that until they're in third fourth or fifth grade um it's definitely an upper elementary uh type of content you're actually going to see it a little bit here with our with our fuzz uh Creator some of the some of the JavaScript that we use in codable so when we hit build here this is directly related to bug world so this is Javascript um classes and objects and properties are all JavaScript and part of object oriented programming so we're going to name our class and this is exactly how you would do this in JavaScript we're going to name this webinar class when we click this check mark this is Javascript syntax so okay so what we're doing is we are creating um our fuzz so to but to get started making our fuzz we need to construct our fuzz so you can see our Constructor here um we're gonna add a body to our fuzz and we can actually modify this property which is another concept that we cover in bug world um so we're going to say this is our body and the body property is Pink um so then we need to add eyes so the eyes property for our webinar fuzz are going to be green Gray and we have to add a mouth so the mouth property for this Buzz right now is going to be cheese those are values yeah um so yeah the property value for this is going to be cheese um so then we have a function for getting dressed so what we do is we would add mohawk and let's add some glasses party glasses so our webinar fuzz is ready to party and all of these Concepts that you see here in this JavaScript are part of bug world and they are all covered in the lesson plans on objectoriented programming and JavaScript you can access all of the information from your teacher dashboard and your teacher materials cover all of these things that I just mentioned like um classes and objects and values and properties everything that we said here functions they're all covered in that content so um you can feel totally prepared when you're explaining it to your students what exactly is going on here and I guess I would use this opportunity to stress the importance of actually teaching unplugged before getting students onto this so I would not have students I wouldn't even show them the openended content until they've learned what they're doing um because this can be fun and great and it looks pretty and kids love it but if they don't know what it is and what they're doing then it really does lose its value so I would hold off on introducing this until you've taught these Concepts to your students unless you're taking you know just an explore to Learn Type approach but then again coming back to the lessons after they've explored it is really important so that they have the vocabulary to talk about and articulate what they're what they're doing to have questions um it looks like John is in the process of answering some questions um let's see here I don't think I see any questions that haven't been answered so okay um let's see here game updates so the last thing that we want to cover um to our faces hi so um the last thing that we want to say is that we have tons and tons of resources available for you all we spent the summer uh kind of going through everything and making sure that it's easily accessible from a few different locations um as well as making sure that it's updated and ready to go for the new year so um a great place to go for uh information and articles about everything that we've covered here actually is our help center and you can access that from support.codable.com uh Bree and I and John all write articles there um whenever we feel like there's something that we've been answering a lot of questions to we'll put in there also if we have new features that we want to make sure everyone understands we'll put articles there another great resource is our blog uh so that's blog.codehole.com I know we have really creative URLs and you can find helpful articles there as well as updates on codable and what we're doing and what we're working on right now we have a contest going for the year of code you can tell us your coding challenge for yourself for the year and we'll check in with people randomly throughout the year and if you're on track then you can win prizes for your class so um that's a good place to stay tuned to like know what's going on with codable um what our updates are and things like that um the last place that I would suggest uh checking if you have questions about codable is um YouTube we do a lot of tutorials and tips as well as like product tours and things like that on our YouTube channel you're probably on it right now watching this so you're familiar with it but but yeah I would definitely suggest poking around some of our videos we have videos for every single concept that we teach in codable including sequence conditions but also covering classes and variables and properties so um all of these things that we've mentioned are covered in a multitude of places um we did have one question about coding terms and simplifying definitions for kids and you were just mentioning some of our resources and I think our teacher overviews have videos and they're actually meant for adults or for teachers they're not the most kidfriendly they're just not that fun I guess but um I think there are a lot of visuals in those videos that may be helpful for kids to understand especially conditions and I would I would definitely recommend checking out our back to school lessons we have the lesson on conditions and conditional statements that really relates these programming terms to real life and I think that's the best way to help kids understand programming definitions is to to talk about them in ways that relate to things around them and that's what we try to do in some of our teacher materials and those videos so you may find that helpful is this the question you're in yeah yeah awesome I was just reading through the chat yeah okay um does anybody else have any questions for us I know we've gone through a lot tonight um but I want to make sure to answer any questions that may have come up we've we've tried pretty hard to answer as they've been coming but we'll wait a couple minutes to see if there's any more and while we're waiting actually I did also want to show if you have one question uh Tracy asks do you think you will be adding more levels to the paid version just more of the same concept uh we are planning to add more to bug world um and we are um focusing the rest of the year on Creative content so we've had a lot of feedback from people saying that they love that our linear uh our linear game content but that they're wanting more free openended content to let kids kind of practice the concepts that they've been learning um so we're really focusing on that for the next year but there will be more bug world content coming hopefully soon okay we'll wait a couple more minutes if there's any other questions and Bree wanted to show I just wanted to show if you have a great idea for teaching a certain concept or including coding in anything um you can submit a lesson I just want to show you where to do that so this orange submit my lesson button will just bring you to a Google form where you can tell us a little bit about your lesson and uh whatever you can fill in if we can create a lesson out of that even if you just have an idea fantastic we want to hear you know any ideas or even if you have full lessons we'd love you to submit them so that we can add them to our awesome lesson library and share it with your friends okay so I've got a couple questions here um Maureen asks do you find that the fifth graders pick up the syntax quickly uh drives me crazy is there a way that syntax errors are highlighted so uh the way that our syntax works is it types out most of it for them so we remove some of the frustration of like oh I've missed a semicolon or I missed a period or I have I'm missing a character um so that they can really just select the value that they want from a drop down so they'll see all of the syntax uh they just won't actually have to type it which is really nice for students who are still learning their typing skills um so syntax errors kind of eliminated from the whole thing which is really nice um and if you're going over the vocabulary with them you should find uh that they start to pick up the syntax pretty well because that's all covered in the lessons um so you'll be talking about it together in class and I think like most of our material is pretty scaffolded we don't just throw them into the syntax they're seeing it first before they're manipulating it and then eventually they'll be writing it but it's pretty gradual and yeah it builds on itself Tracy Williams asks can you lock the creative fuzz part of ship control panel uh no you can't right now but that is something we have Free's been advocating for since the moment we created I taught kindergarten in first grade so I am I'm saying we should lock it yeah and I have a feeling with the start of the school year we'll start getting more and more requests for that so um hopefully soon we'll be able to add that for you guys um Stacy blauer asks do you think there are enough lessons for an entire year with the free option uh so there are about 12 lessons uh 12 weeks of lessons and that really depends on how in depth you want to go with coding in the library and in the library the library is more like supplemental things or if they're special occasions mini lessons things like that I think we have an Earth Day lesson in there um but yeah it really depends on how in depth you want to go if you guys are just exploring and you're figuring out this whole coding thing and you're just getting started absolutely like figure out if codable is the right thing for you figure out if it's something you want to continue teaching with um but if you're ready to sort of go in depth with your students and you really want them prepared at the end of um Elementary School to be writing apps and games and and websites and creating things in Middle School uh then I would say it'd be worth exploring the the paid content because we have now over 70 weeks of of lessons you can really have a whole Year's worth of content um to teach your students and make sure that they're prepared for middle school so if that's something you're interested in you can always reach out to either me or Bree um or support codable.com and we can set up a quick chat with you get it getting to know sort of your coding goals we're trying to achieve in your school um and really get to know like yours you know your special situation and make a recommendation on what plan would be right for you um go over some of our pricing options and cover all that you would get with the school plan um so Kate molito asks I know each great each new grade level starts with a review from last year that does this reset student progress or will it show will it show those I think Kate what you're asking is um does it reset student progress if you do those reviews um it will not delete their previous attempts on in the game um it will just add more attempts to that progress so it'll say last attempted and it'll say they've attempted it you know five times however many times they've completed it and it'll show their highest score on that level so say they reviewed it and they did better than they did last year it'll show that high score um Tracy Williams asks can teachers make their own maze in the village of Maze and share it with students uh we yes you can absolutely create your own maze we are working on adding a sharing feature actually that's next on our agenda for the year so hopefully sometime in September or October that will be released to you guys um to start sharing it'll be between classes like sorry within within classes so students in your class will have access to mazes that were created by students in your class or by you um and not like with the world um Jesus saves me through and through asks how to record students progress if they are doing it manually as they do not yet have tablets that's a great question actually um we don't have any way of recording it is really nice a coding portfolio of all of their work which is really nice for them to take home at the end of the school year and sort of show their parents the other thing that's really important is parent interact engagement um parents just love seeing what their kids are learning at school and the kids love showing them and kind of being the expert on this New Concept that they just learned so that's another great way um Android version so um I can't see your username but uh we had an Android version and unfortunately since we are such a small team I don't know if you all know but we're five people uh and so we were not able to support it and we didn't want to keep it out there with it being not a great experience we also didn't have a ton of people using Android devices in the classroom um and so unfortunately we had to pull it from the Google Play Store but it is something that we want to eventually put back out there once we're able to support it so hopefully soon bye comfortable school and we can hire more people um yeah I think that that is all of the questions um yeah awesome well thank you all so much for joining us thank you for sticking with us through technical support at the beginning again if you're planning on using wirecast play maybe not um but anyway so have a really great start to your school year and feel free to reach out to us anytime support.codable.com um and we'll be happy to answer your questions yeah all right thank you back to school yay see ya thank you
