this is the fuzz family you might notice that no two fuzzes look exactly the same some have blue eyes some are rainbow some are different accessories just from looking you can tell that blue is different from Prism but how they look different because they have different properties a property is a feature or characteristic of an object you have properties that make you human like hands ears and a nose fuzzes have properties too they have a body eyes and a mouth fuzzes have many properties in common for example all fuzzes have color body color is a property but as a programmer you can change this property's value to make body color vary from fuzz to fuzz for example the value of the color property for blue fuzz is blue but you would change that value to Green for Simon you try what's the value of the color property for Shaggy what about princess properties are important because they help us tell all the fuzzes apart the cool thing is that as a programmer you can assign or change a property's value in your code and it will change what a user sees let's check that out in fuzz Builder here is a body property we definitely want that for our fuzz but there are different colors of bodies here I can assign the value green to this body I can also change it to gold the property itself doesn't change this fuzz still has a body but the color is variable which means it can change depending on what you assign here's your mission build two fuzzes that look different from each other the fuzzes can only share one property value in common for example your first fuzz might have green fur green eyes and green accessories but for your second fuzz try to switch it up change the body color value to be something new get creative and try to make your fuzzes as different as possible here I am choosing properties and other items that I know I did not assign to my first fuzz double check your work every line of code between your two fuzzes should be different except for one when you are done compare your two fuzzes to somebody else's do your fuzzes share the same properties how are they similar what values did you choose to make your fuzz's properties look different now it's your turn open fuzz Builder build two fuzzes and complete your mission remember you're looking to build two fuzzes that look different from each other the fuzzes can only share one property value in common good luck
