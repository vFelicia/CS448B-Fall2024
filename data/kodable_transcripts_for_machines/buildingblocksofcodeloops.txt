hey i'm gretchen and in this video we're going to go over loops another building block in learning to code first we're going to go to smeeborg and then loopy lessons loops allow you to repeat commands a set number of times so if you were programming something to deal cards first you would define what it meant to deal a card then you would tell it to repeat that command as many times as you wanted to deal cards so if you wanted to deal five cards you would say deal card and then have it repeat five times that's how loops work in codable so we tell it what commands we want to repeat and then we tell it how many times we want to repeat them so i'm going to show you how that works in this maze first we're going to go forward and then we're going to use the looper we want to go up and then to the right and we need to repeat that two times so we're just gonna tap two and then hit play and you can see we were able to solve this maze using only two command bins loops allow your code to be more efficient and that's loops if you have any questions you can check the codeable learning guide thanks
