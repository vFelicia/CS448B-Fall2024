and this is Hannah hello and we are so excited to share with you all about the our code um many of you RSVP'd and told us this is your very first time he's incredible for the our code so we are so excited for you we have been doing this since 2013 so this is our sixth year doing the our code with codable and we have some exciting new activities for your students we're gonna go over all of that with you today we're gonna go over how to get your class set up how to get your devices set up we're gonna go over the new activity with you we're gonna cover some of the activities from previous years and then we're going to talk a little bit about what to expect after the RF code so immediately following kind of like some ideas to celebrate what your kids have achieved share with their families and then also what you can expect after the hour of code if you decide hey this coding thing is pretty cool I'm gonna keep doing it we've got some tips for you we've got some panas gonna share some cool things that you can do with codable beyond just your hour of code activity so to get things going I'm going to tell you a little bit about hannah hannah joined our team this year she's fantastic she was working at a charter school here in California as the computer science teacher then decided to go to Harvard and get her it was a Masters of Education and technology education so she is perfectly suited to be telling you all about how to use codable in your classrooms we're so lucky to have her on our team so without much further ado we're gonna go ahead and get going um so to begin you all submitted some great questions and your RSVP and I just want to make sure that we cover all of them one of my favorite questions was I am very new to coding specifically our earth code what kind of computer background do I need to learn it to teach my first graders and you don't really need to have any computer science knowledge to use codable first of all or to do the hour of code that's the beauty of it like that's why it's so exciting because the hour of code was started by code org as an initiative to get kids exposed to computer science adults exposed to computer science everyone just trying it for one hour for the very first time so it's very beginner friendly all of our activities give you everything that you need right there in the lesson plan so it's completely scripted you can follow along if you have no CS background we're gonna do all of the vocabulary we're gonna give you all of the materials that you'll need and we even had some if you really want to learn about the concepts on your own we have videos and modules where you can learn all about every concept that we teach in codable so but but that's not necessary just give it a try honestly the only thing that's required is a growth mindset and we're all big fans of that here incredible so just get your thinking cap on don't be afraid to make mistakes your kids are gonna be making mistakes right along with you they love it when they're like they like know things so you know that so I'm just going to it with an open mind be prepared by you know maybe testing your devices making sure that whatever activity you've decided to do works on all your devices but other than that there's nothing you know that you need to know specifically about computer science to do the hour of code totally um so without with that I'm gonna let Hannah take over she's gonna show you how to get stupid with bubble not required that you stop a class in codable but we do recommend it because it's gonna make it easier for you going beyond the hour of code and also to track student progress and share certificates so I'm gonna let Hannah take over great I'm just gonna share our screen and real quick and kind of go ahead in Lagos and decodable awesome do you want to be logged in as yourself or do you want is it okay if you use mine yeah that's totally fine okay you guys are seeing how many accounts I okay awesome so yeah like Gretchen had just mentioned you do not need to have a codable account setup in order to do the hour of code but we recommend it for all the reasons that she had just mentioned and I'll just show you really quick how easy it is to add a class if that is something you're interested in doing before starting the hour of code it'll just take a couple minutes so you can see here we're on the class creation page I'm just going to click this big blue button that says add class and the first step is to name your class so I'm just going to name it our code webinar for now you can continue or if you need to add multiple classes there's also this option here this blue button so if that's if you have multiple classes you want to add at once it's super easy to do that you can just click the need to add multiple classes button for this demo I'm just gonna add one class so I've pressed to continue now it's time to add my students so I'm just going to add one name per line you do not need to manually enter all of these names if you have your students name saved in some sort of a list or a spreadsheet you can copy and paste them right here into this area so if these are my students I'm going to save them and move on and we've made this step super easy your students need a class code to play to log into codable the class code is sort of like a class password and we've generated a class password for your class here you can always change this later but just to keep it simple we've given you one to start so you can just click continue that's the code that your students will use to log in and they're customizing our class so we will just wait a second customizing awesome so then we have this option to invite parents to follow progress this is one of the huge perks of setting up a class before you do the hour of code this way if you invite parents to follow progress as you move forward with codable parents of your students will be able to see what they're learning and how they're learning it so you can really easily print these invitations for the parents of your students and this will be a letter that you can print off I wonder if I can show maybe I can't but this will be a letter that you can print off and give out to your students to take home and it's just a little description of what students will be doing with codable so a great way to keep parents informed but we're all done setting up the class that was super easy we're gonna go to our class come and now you're logged into your codable dashboard so those were all the steps you need to take to set up a class with codable again it's a great way to be able to track student progress and keep parents informed your class code that you created that your students will need to log in is just there at the top so you'll never lose it it's right there front and center and I do just want to mention quickly that classes have a cap of 50 students but you can have unlimited classes even with the free teacher account so there's really an unlimited number of students that you can set up with a codable accounts we just did a little demo of five but you can have unlimited since there is unlimited classes with color ball um so now that you've gotten all set up with your teacher account I'm gonna pass it back off to Gretchen and she'll go over how to get your students set up with codable in the hour of code yeah yay okay so I just I just want to let you guys know just reiterate what the Hana said we you do not have to set up a class I'm gonna show you how you can do it with and without a class that's already set up but it is beneficial to have your class set up ahead of time now I just want to quickly pause for questions in case any one has anything we've got on the side over here there's a little chat window you guys feel free to share questions share tips anything that occurs to you while we're going through all of this we've got Bri I'm sure many of you have met for your heard from Bri at some point in your lives with go to bed she's here responding to all of your questions so if you have anything please feel free to post them there it looks like we're okay for right now no questions but I'm going to so I'm going to go ahead and go through how to get set up so um I'm going to go to codable comm slash our of code and this is our our code home page so everything basically everything that we're going to talk about today is accessible from this page so to start off this is how your students are going to get set up so we're gonna go to kids start here and if they're use if you're using a class code you can enter it here or if you want your kids to be able to log in without needing a class code they can do that here so play without saving and that's going to create an anonymous profile for them they can play and then they can leave later they keep well they will have the option to write down their code to enter at home if they want to play continue playing at home but for the most part it's basically unsaved information so that's useful if you don't have the time or don't want to set up a class code with or an account with codable if you do have a class code I'm just gonna go ahead and use the class code that Hannah set up it's alright next okay I'm gonna play with myself all righty so it's super simple your students will see the roster pop up in front of them you've got two new buzzes and we're gonna start by building our first buzz so this is blue buzz adding all the properties of our new fuzz okay and now we've landed on fuzz topia and this is the home of the fuzz family your kids are going to unlock their mission control but we're actually going to go back to the Sofia's and click the home and we want to go to the hour of code Hut so it's right here this is where we can find art codable our code activities so we've got three here to choose from we're gonna talk about the maze maker challenge and the character the fuzz builder challenge later but we're gonna start out with the beach cleanup activity I know so before I get into this activity I want to make sure to address some of the questions you guys had about setting up devices so we're in the activity right now but I'm logged in on the web and you guys saw how to do that it's super simple but you should try this on your computers that you're gonna be using at school before it's a classroom full of kids there are sometimes URLs that need to be white listed perhaps your what's the word I'm looking for your privacy setting I'm alone allow you access if your firewall won't thank you won't allow access in decodable so be sure to double check that everything is working if you have any issues when you're trying it out for the first time you can email us at support at codable calm and someone from our team can help you through all of that and make sure it's all up and running for you and just doublecheck that it's all ready to go before you get your kids in the classroom the day of the other thing is if you're going to be using codable on ipads the setup process is the same like the student login process is the same the only difference is you're going to want to make sure you have the latest version of codable installed on your iPad's ahead of time previous versions did not have this activity they did not have the hour of code hut so you need to make sure you're updated to the latest version before the day of other than that it's super simple you can enter your student your class code or you can use the play without saving option on any device okay so then I'm going to go ahead and go into the activity oh wait we do have a question here so someone in our RSVP link asked how can I use codable for two grade levels without needing a login or password for each individual student I'll be doing the our code presentation style where I have one grade level which each with their own iPad at the same time so it sounds like you're gonna be sharing devices a little bit maybe two students per device so what I would suggest is using you know if you want to set up a class you can we went through how easy that is but if you decide you don't want to use that play without saving option that is available on the iPad and what I would suggest is having kids take turns being the driver doing a little pair programming which is just two kids on a device working together to solve problems and one will be the driver and one will be you know the assistant and then after they've completed a level then they can switch that works really well with groups of kids or if you have it doesn't say what grade you're gonna be working with but if you have kids say you have you know kindergarteners and fifth graders or if you have a large you know age gap but you're the two grades you're working with it's really fun to have one be the teacher and one be you know the the learner we get a lot of during the our code we get a lot of schools who send us you know exciting photos and videos of their fifth graders teaching their kindergartners which is so much fun um under a couple and quickly add gudgeon we'll go over the activity in just a second but there is an unlimited number of levels that you can play with this beach cleanup hour of code activity so you don't need to worry about one student running out of levels the other student is the driver if they're sharing a device um there's unlimited levels so that won't be yeah all right so we're gonna hop into the beach cleanup activity real quick um so this is going to this is a quick video I've linked to these videos in the agenda that sent out to you all we're gonna add the links to the video description or so anytime oh it's already there it's in the video description on YouTube um if you want to play these ahead of time for your kids to make sure that they know what they're getting into or if you want to instruct them on how to play the beach cleanup you can do that also but these are a quick video from Hannah just walking them through how to play and what concepts they're gonna be learning I'm gonna skip it for now because you just can watch it um so we're gonna hit play now these little guys here are our sea creatures that we're trying to rescue from all the garbage on the on the beach in fuzzy Opia and when your students earn enough points so when they recycle enough items so they recycle 12 items 30 items or 50 items then their little sea creature friend can come in live on post topia on their beach super cute we love them her designers Greg did an amazing job uh so I'm gonna go ahead and play it so there's three difficulty levels to choose from there's easy which gives them you know one one reward per piece of item or per seat per piece of trash and that's gonna include sequencing and conditions there's medium which doubles the rewards per item and that includes sequencing conditions and loops and then there's hard and that includes sequencing conditions loops and functions there is a video for each of these difficulty levels that explains the concepts that the kids are going to be doing I would suggest starting everyone and easy and then if they feel they're ready for something more difficult and more challenging encourage them to bump up to medium or hard we're gonna start uneasy so you're suppose buzz great so we need to draw the path for blue buzz to follow to collect all of the garbage here's our tutorial video explaining what sequencing and conditions are this is from Hannah again this is linked in the video description on YouTube we're gonna skip it for right now so I need to draw a path that lets me get to all of these route little recycling symbols okay so and I cannot draw through these items I can't draw through the surfboard I can't draw through the Sandcastle and it can't draw through my creatures so what I'm gonna do I think my best option is just start down here what do you think Hannah start up here or start down here I love it cuz there is a little tricky um even for us too so it's a good I'm starting down here yep okay yeah so Gretchen is just drawing the path that will connect all of the recycling symbols and then get to the end it'll show up with the little start button and finish button those tiles will automatically appear when you've clicked on any of the squares on either side of the columns okay so I'm gonna hit play great so now I need to program my buzz to get through this maze to the end and recycle all that see the trash around are a little secret you're under a little seal friend here so I'm going to look forward and up into the right but oh it looks like I need to edit my maze because I missed one of my recycling symbols so I'm gonna try again and this time I'm going to use a condition and the condition is ifthen logic so it's saying if this tile is pink then I want to go right so I can use conditions to make turns I can use conditions as exceptions to a rule like in programming so I'm gonna say forward up if pink bingo right I'm going to go back I'm gonna go up right I hope I have enough space no I don't know I don't think I do okay let's try again let's see what happens well yep so you guys can see I ran out of space here so this is again a great way for our kids to be practicing design thinking critical thinking skills and problem solving and to complete their activity so why don't we try this I'm gonna edit my maze and draw this way I'm going to erase hmm all right what do you think Hannah we've got one two three four five six seven eight movin too many all right let's see here hmm think we can make it I don't know it's pretty tough let's see here I'm gonna try this mmhmm we could also show you how if there is a level that seems so hard how to refresh it oh yeah I won I'll try this one and then we'll see about doing that okay so nope I think that's too many all right we're gonna try getting a new one and see okay so we're just gonna hit play again she was easy I think this one is doable yep okay so we're going to go forward up down right up yeah okay I think this is for sure gonna work we just need our condition here so if green then we're gonna go to the right okay let's go forward up nope nope go back yes green go right nope baby down up right right okay I think the visit what do you think Hannah I think it looks good okay let's give it a shot so then each time the fuzz rolls over the recycling symbol it will pick up the trash and free the sea creature so we got three items we're gonna go ahead I'm gonna try it one more so you guys can see this so this one is gonna go down so you can see when Gretchen is drawing the path there's a lot of different possible solutions so you can encourage your students to get creative try multiple options just because one student would solve it one way no student solve it a different way doesn't mean there's one right or wrong answer which is which is great they can test out multiple possible solutions yeah if I wanted to I could have gone straight here down to this and then down over here in the back there's so many different options okay so I went right okay I think that's anything that's it yeah I need to get a couple more and I can unlock the little shields can live on for sopia with my buzzes um so I'm gonna pause and see if anybody has questions here about the activity it looks like yeah so we have one question that says from Lauren it says to they'll have to use a browser so just to reiterate that if you are using an iOS device you can use the codable app downloaded from the App Store but if you are using any other type of device like a computer you would want to use a web browser and again you can go to the students play button on our hour of code page to find the easy link to the activity so yes if you're playing online on a browser that's the you'll go to the hour of code site and play straight from there not from the app and one thing to clarify is that in so the beach cleanup activity and the hour of code activities are available on the web yearround they are always there you can always go to code Volcom slash our of code and get to these activities they are not available yearround on the iPad so after December 20th the beach cleanup activity is going away on the iPad and you won't have access to but if you log in on the web then it will be available yearround so if you guys are doing your hour of code in January then that is the method that I would use to log in if you want to use codable for your hour of code on the iPad you can definitely do that we do have hour of code activities that are not the beach cleanup but the beach cleanup will not be available after December 20th on the iPad it will be available on the way ok great so um do I think that that shows do we what do you want to do one that was a loop and a function do you think we're okay I think it's okay I just to say again when your students choose the different level of difficulty they have an option to watch a tutorial video they don't have to but those videos will pop up whenever they switch their difficulty level and it demonstrates with examples from the game exactly how to do the different types of levels how to use condition tiles like Gretchen used how do you loop and how to use a function so if you're looking at this and you're thinking I don't know how to explain how to use a condition tile to my students they have an option to watch that video and I'm about to go over our lesson plan with you so you can see exactly how easy it is to explain these different coding concepts from our code but if you want to see how those different how loops and functions will be used in the game you can play yourself of course or you can watch those tutorial videos it explains everything yep I'm gonna quickly address one of the questions that we've gotten about this so um one question that we had was you know someone is asking why isn't it working my maze don't let me hit play it's muted it's it's grayed out and you want to make sure that you're going directly to your recycle symbols so if I were to do this and try and draw through my turtle here that does not work that's gonna see the the program is gonna see that as an incomplete maze so what you want to do is draw around them so that you can connect all the parts of your maze and another way you could go um that's how the the program is gonna see that it's a completed maze these guys are working as obstacles to make it a little bit more challenging now the other question that I've gotten is okay my my recycling symbols are all connected but I don't have a starting into my maze so if you if I were to erase this right and I just started drawing here um codable simpsons when you draw a path on either the right hand side or the left hand side of the main of the maze so it's gonna automatically create your start tile and when I connect this to the end to the to the right hand side here it's gonna automatically make my in tile so if I wanted to move that I can move my end all around anything that appears in this right hand column or this left hand column is going to be either a start or an end okay yeah so that's covering the activity I'm gonna let I'm note let Hannah take over and go over the lesson plan with you awesome mmhmm great Thank You fetchin um so I'm gonna dive into showing you the lesson plan that we've created to go along with the beach cleanup activity please continue to write in questions if you have any throughout the description of the lesson plan we're happy to answer them so I am finding the lesson plan on the same website our hour of code website that we just access the game from so everything is in one place we're gonna go to the codable beach cleanup activity and I'm going to click on the orange view lesson plan this is linking to our lesson plan from our codable dashboard but again you do not but again you do not need to have a codable account in order to access this lesson plan it's available for everyone so this is the lesson plan okay fortunately help me find my mouse up here yeah you got a real thank you so this is the beach cleanup of codable lesson plan it's organized the same way that our other lesson plans are but if you haven't seen those plans before that's okay and here's just an overview of what you can find in the lesson so we always start out with our objectives what students will be able to do and the standards that they accompany the objectives then we go over a list of the lesson materials now I've tried to include absolutely everything you could need in this lesson materials list but there will also be a few links throughout the lesson plan if you don't want to download all the resources at the start but I will just point out that all of these different worksheets are linked directly here from the lesson plan so this lesson comes with different unplugged worksheets for students to work on the hour of code certificates that you can print off when students are done as well as all of those beach cleanup tutorial videos that we have been talking about we go over the vocabulary and then we dive into the direct instruction now for our lesson plan we've scripted out what you could say in order to introduce the hour of code and this activity of course if you don't want to follow this script that is completely okay we just want to have this here in case you are looking for some extra support so it starts with an introduction to the hour of code and then an introduction to the beach cleanup activity specifically why ocean life and ocean health is important a little thinkpairshare we've included some different videos and articles here if you want to set up more of a context for your students about why protecting marine life from pollution is an important problem to tackle so these are here for you and the different grade levels that we recommend for those resources now we dive into the beach cleanup activity itself we script out different ways to introduce the activity as well as link all those videos that you would find in the actual activity they're linked here in the lesson plan as well so again you can introduce the different difficulty levels you might say for if you're just teaching like a fourth grade class you might recommend your students all start with medium or hard levels or if you're teaching multiple grades we have all of these the different videos here so you can kind of judge what level your students should start at and there's a couple lesson tips throughout one recommendation I have is if you do have a projector maybe walking through one level together kind of like you just saw a Gretchen do on the webinar just kind of going through the activity projecting it up on a screen if you have that might help kind of set the stage for your students then there's an optional group brainstorm this is an option we've had some people write in asking if we have an unplugged option for this lesson so the activity itself is plugged in but an unplugged option is to do this group brainstorm so these are I'll just click on one example and these are different work that we've put together that helps students brainstorm why ocean and ocean life is important different things that might cause harm to ocean life and then some sort of brainstorm around how technology can be used to solve this problem of ocean pollution and then some different creative options for them to draw or describe what they could invent in order to solve the problem of ocean pollution so let me find my listen again oops there we go so again that was linked just directly in the lesson plan as you made your way down into the optional group brainstorm and then finally the lesson wraps up with a little debrief as well as having students fill out their code at the bottom of the worksheet so that they can if you have set up a class with codable they can take that parent code home and their parent can look at the mazes that they've created and and see their progress as you move forward with codable and so there's little tips down here for how to send that home so that is an overview of the lesson plan I just want to emphasize that this plan can be used for any grade level we've broken down all the different options for like K through first second and third fourth and fifth when it comes time to differentiate for the grade level so there's one lesson plan but modifications for how to use it with different grades cool awesome so I am going to step aside and then Gretchen is going to dive into some of our other hour of code activities that are available from our hour of code page in case you want something different from be beach cleanup activity yeah so if if any of you guys follow our blog I did a post a couple weeks ago about four ways you can do the hour of code one including our beach cleanup but also one of our most popular activities which is our maze maker it's similar to the beach cleanup and that students are going to be creating mazes but we give them prompts so I'll go ahead and open the lesson for you to view that online this is a k25 activity and depending on the age or the grade level that you're working with there are prompts within the maze maker activity to create different shapes that are common core aligned so with a math standard so there's a kindergarten shape there's a firstgrade shape secondgrade shape and if a student completes all of them than they like beat the entire activity so you can let kids you know even at a kindergarten level start out with this and see how far they go same with a 5th grader if you want to let them start out you know they're gonna get an easy shape and then this getting it more and more difficult challenging for them this is one of our most popular activities it's great for design thinking and every single maze that they draw just like in the maze maker when they draw this maze here or sorry just like in the the beach cleanup activity what they draw a maze then they have to test it and they have to program it so it's not just draw shape its draw shape and then program your Fuzz to go through that shape it's really fun kids can decorate however they want to make their you know customize their maze and add character to it but it's you know I find them selfguided activity for your kids to do and then another option is our build your own size activity again this is another drew student driven activity and what they do they're given a video prompt that says you know has them think about a character or think about themselves or think about you know an imaginary character that they know of that they want to create and what character traits are what physical traits make that character who they are and then they can create that character as a fuzz so this comes with a graphic organizer to design their fuzz on paper then you can go in and see the quotable game and start creating your buzz all of the instructions that you need are included in this lesson here again it's a pretty selfguided activity but if you want to UM take some of it offline and have kids use the the graphic organizer if you can another option that people love is our introduction to programming this is our very like one of our I guess you can call it classic decodable lessons our code lessons this there has a k25 option so there's a there's an option for every single grade level k25 you would just select the grade that you want um so I'm going to select second grade and it's gonna pop up the lesson plan here design for a second grade class and this activity does have a really great unplugged fit so if you don't have devices for the hour of code no worries this would be the lesson plan I would suggest for you because what you're gonna do is work together as a group to program a robot and I say robot encode and quotes because you're gonna choose either a volunteer student or maybe the room parent or another teacher or you can you can be the robot to you're in a program that robot to walk forward turn around and jump and this activity is scaled depending on the grade level that you're working with and in our direct instruction piece we walk you through how to do this unplugged activity together offscreen and there's also sorry it's in the in the guided practice activity and there is there are um quotable levels that go along with these lesson plans they're prescribed levels that go along you can assign those to your class or if you are not working with a quotable class code like you haven't set up a class for your students then you can still play use that say without saving option just put your kids onto codable use the play without saving option and then they can go in and play they're going to be introduced to sequencing that's the first section of levels in codable and that's what we're going over in this activity and then there's a quick check for understanding so this is a really great introduction to programming and introduction to the hour of code and an introduction to codable and what it means to program this would be my recommendation if anyone's looking for a more guided activity where they're doing some more instruction or if they're looking for an unplugged activity this would be my goto um yeah I think that's oh so one last one that is my favorite that I'm just gonna share with you guys um is our we have several to choose from here if you've been using codable for a while and you've got students who are pretty advanced they're working for like you're working through a progression this unit and there's certain concepts you want to cover we have a an hour of code activity for each of our grade level concepts but another one that I love is our women in tech activity as a third to fifth grade project and it's done over three class periods and it's more like a research activity where kids are tucked you know learning about women and Technology famous women in technology and then writing about them and talking about some gender dynamics within the tech sector so that's a pretty cool lesson also there's several others here I mean you guys can see we've got dozens to choose from but those are some that I wanted to be sure to highlight um do we have I've been waiting in question I don't think I see any that have popped up that BRE has not taken care of oh cool thanks Bri um okay so then I guess we'll just go on to what to expect after the RF code so um if this is your first time I'm doing the art code it's your student's first time programming it's a very exciting day it's an exciting day if they've done it before but it's very exciting if it's their first time everybody's gonna be it's gonna be high energy there's gonna be a lot of exciting things happening so I want to UM you know just tell you to like lean into that enjoy it soak it up because I know you guys are always looking for ways to engage your students this is one of the best ways to do it um its speaking their language or using technology but it's also introducing them to a way of thinking that sometimes we miss in our you know Twitter century lives where we're just consuming all of this information using technology every minute of every day but not really thinking about what goes into creating that technology um so this is a great opportunity to do that with your students have those conversations with them and then afterward celebrate everything that they've achieved recognize you know if there was a student who was really struggling you know maybe to overcome this a tough level and then they did it you know recognize them if there were kids who are really working together pair programming and doing a great job recognize them we have certificates for you to give out to your students they're here on our hour of code page you enter your email address we're gonna send you this empty certificate for you to print out and you can you know write a student names in or if you have a class set up in codable on your codable dashboard we're updating the dashboard this week with the option have prefilled lessons so whenever student profile names you put in it's gonna pre fill their names here for their certificate then you can just print off all of them and give them to them so they're gonna already have their information on them um it'll save you a ton of time writing student names in and then be sure to share you know if students create mazes or if they create characters during the hours code you can share that with their family so that's another great reason to have it can't set up and have a class set up because I can invite parents to connect with my class right here so I know my my parents email address I'm going to invite them and I'm gonna send them an invitation to join the class it's gonna send them an email just saying hey you know hannah has invited you to follow Gretchen's progress in codable here's the link to do that they can follow progress for free if they decide that they want to like say you guys do the hour of code in December but you guys aren't planning on continuing with coding beyond that and parents you know say that their kids are really into it um they have the option to continue with a parent account and at home and they get that information when you send this invitation to them it is optional and it's not something that's required to follow progress and it's a pretty cool way to help their kids get more exposure to computer science to coding through codable without interfering with what you're doing at school because it is totally different levels it's a totally different experience in the athome version um the other way that you can send creations home is say I encourage them to show up here no muses I'm gonna go to one of my classes that does have Mazen um so let's see here ain't got a student in here yeah so here we can see a maze that one of my students created and I want to print that and send it home to their family so this is gonna create a quick little handout let me see if I can assure you it's a handout that you can send home with your students um that's gonna let them see the maze that they're a student that their child created so I share this with you here it is um so here you can see this is the little handout that you can send homeless kids and again it's got information if they do want to continue at home there's information about how to do that great yeah um so the last question that I wanted to be sure to address that we got in our we got in our RSVP form was somebody asks and I love this question how do I invest and promote to the outside community ie parents getting them involved so a great opportunity with the hour of code since it's such an exciting day and in such an exciting time is to do a family code night a lot of the schools who use codable through this I love seeing the photos because they're just so precious but it's a great opportunity to get parents involved let them know about what's happening um at your school community that you that you are doing because parents I don't know if you guys know this but ninety percent of parents want their kids learning about computer science they know it's important for their future but they really are not sure like how they as parents can support their kids so this is a great opportunity for you to say hey we're doing this at school come and see all of the learning that's happening and a family KO tonight's a great way to do that we have a post on our on our blog from a couple of years ago a teacher a fantastic teacher who's been doing the hour of code as long as we have wrote a nice blog post about how he did his family coat night I've seen others communities do it a great way to boost attendance is to offer free pizza I have learned that for everyone loves free right everyone likes pizza so 100% attendance is one of the claims from a group that did 100 that did free pizza so that's really exciting so that's a great way to if your if your school is willing to invest in getting your parent community involved in coding that's a great way to do it but then in addition to that there's also sending home the materials like we like we just went over so I'm gonna let Hannah quickly go over some things you can do beyond the hour of code yes um I want to make sure we don't run yeah I want to run out of time thank you yeah so what I'll say is on your codable the teacher dashboard should I should I open back up to things let's do this I'm I'm going to reshare my screen just so you can see great so great um so on your teacher dashboard that we've been showing before I just want to point out that there is so much rich information on this dashboard if after the hour of code you're interested in learning more about codable but you want to use it in your classroom you're not quite sure where to start your teacher dashboard is full of awesome information for you so I'm just gonna point out a couple things really quick if you have questions about your dashboard or anything codable related there's always this little yellow speech bubble in the bottom right hand corner that is a direct chat to me so if you have questions about codable please feel free to reach out since i know this is gonna be pretty fast so I just want to draw your attention to the teacher guide if you are interested in learning more about what codable teaches the actual concepts it covers as well as all the different worlds there's three worlds and codable a lot of people aren't aware of some of these later worlds for the higher grades so this guide goes over everything with the game as well as how to use codable in your classroom how to teach with it in different recommendations for structuring lessons if that's something that you are looking for so again that that codable field guide on the dashboard is a great place to start also on the dashboard in the upper left hand corner we have our Resource Center and if you haven't checked out the Resource Center I highly recommend you do so we have Serkis for the first couple of first levels in Snee borg the first world that students will play in codable as well as different guides like overall the coding concepts videos for you and classroom materials so those are just two two resources that i recommend starting with there are a lot of other tabs here at the top that i'm not going to dive into right now i want to make sure we have time for questions but i recommend giving those a look it's different ways that you can kind of construct your class control the pacing of the levels if you choose to move forward with codable so you know if there are code goes really well say in next week they want to do a follow on lesson yeah where should they start what should be would be their first step yeah so if the if the hour of code goes really well and you'd like to move forward with codable if you have this class code your students will be all set up to start coding with codable right off the bat and they would just need to enter their class code either in the app or on the web at game doc audible.com the first level that they will see is I'm in the assignments tab right here the first level they will see is one two three role in sequence sector and I just want to say for these level assignments all students will be recommended to start with this first level regardless of their grade or their age they're all going to start in the same place to make sure they build that foundational knowledge so if you just want them to jump into it you can have them log into codable and it will automatically start them on this first level now if you want to see what that level is all about you can go to what it's called teacher demo mode here on the Left teacher demo mode is codable unlocked so you can see everything your students see in the game without ever leaving your dashboard so you can log into teacher demo mode and play that first level that your students would play as well and that's where we recommend starting and if they want to support this dislike student activity you know these levels with a lesson what lesson goes with these yeah so in the oak do you want to point something son maybe go from there class really easier yeah so if you're already you've chosen your class you can go to your lessons tab the lessons tab is going to map out all the different lessons that accompany the game levels I'm in codable so for this introduction if you're like I want to do my first lesson after the hour of code you can go to unit one and go to the very first lesson introduction and this lesson is available for everyone whether you have a free teacher account or a paid account and this would be a great follow up lesson to the hour of code I mean kind of introduces computer science what programming and a programmer is kind of gives some basic vocabulary like sequence and then at the bottom it shows you the first level of codable that accompanies the introductory lesson so that would be a great place to start again I found it from going to my lessons tab and just clicking on the very first introductory lesson awesome thank you so much yeah of course okay so we're about at a time and I just want to take this time to let anyone ask questions if they have them here in the chat window um let's see we run through some of the questions that we got see if we answered all of them so um be covered Oh someone asked well kids get certificates we covered that you can access the certificates on the our code page how many levels it's a limited levels if you have a quotable subscription already through your school you can access all of this just like weeds later here if you're on a free plan again you can access all of it just like we've laid it out here it does not matter whether you're on a free plan or a paid plan this is this is accessible from the hour of code page so the code org slash learn page codable is listed there but again if you're planning on using code well I would suggest is going to quotable calm slash our oddish code one question that we got that we were honestly we needed a little bit more context to answer was how to motivate a child who doesn't want to think during the coding and I think that this this could be we can and I went back and forth actually quite a bit on what this could possibly mean and we had several ideas maybe that you know kids a little bit afraid to make a mistake that's something that I often see and was thinking maybe they're you know over achieved and they're a little bit you know being bored and need to be challenged a little bit more this is something that I don't think is specific to the hour of code so we've put together a quick poll if this is something that you think you'd be interested in learning more about I'm gonna put the link to the poll we are considering doing a webinar on this specific activity so I'm just going to pull up that link and post it in the video description below if it's something that you want to do go ahead and click on that poll and let us know yes or no if it's something you want to learn more about hmm are there any other questions you know myself yeah um not too many others there was just one question will this be suitable for ela learners um I do just want to emphasize that code of actual levels for the beach cleanup activity as well as the Mays sneaker and the buzz builder they're not it's not necessary to be able to read at all a lot of those activities or all of them are designed to be accessible for a pre reader or really students but the tutorial videos that we have are in English so that's just something to be aware of but if you have ela students I definitely recommend giving the the beach clean up the maze maker and the other hour of code activities a try they're designed to be able to use you can draw the mazes and do the coding without needing to know English or be a reader at all um so that's just one thing to point out there weren't any others I'm Gretchen is just posting a survey about the webinar for how to motivate students with coding so again if you're interested in exploring that some more definitely click on that okay I think those I think we touched on all the other questions if any other questions come up please write in to us support by protocol again there was a little bubble on your teacher dashboard that that goes to me so happy is there any other questions you might have leading up to the our code yay thank you so much for watching we've really enjoyed all of this again we're so excited for their good please send us with us send us all of the videos and pictures and everything you capture during the week up if you're able to we love seeing that stuff honestly we live for this week it's so exciting for us um okay thank you so much thank you bye bye
