hey everybody I'm Gretchen and I'm John and we're the founders of potable today we are so excited because we're announcing a new initiative called potable for everyone right now there are 16 million students living in poverty in the United States their schools are doing their absolute best to help them overcome their adversity and succeed in life but they are facing a lot of challenges and we codable believe that no computer science is fundamental in helping them face those challenges if you can give you so much for the world it can teach you you know how to persevere through tough problem to teach you how to think logically and it's one of the few things that's ever existed that you can really create a ton of value without having a ton of resources store yeah so that's why we have always been committed to making programming accessible to all students so today we're putting our money where our mouth is from now until June we want to give codable to a hundred schools yeah and so for every school purchase of codable from here on out we're going to donate another license to a school of an underserved community and additionally to that for every parent plan that's purchased we're going to donate towards a license to a school as well so this is what we're doing but we're also calling on you if every person who used codable donated $20 we could provide computer science to the entire nation but we're not asking for that we're just asking for five dollars if you have five dollars to put toward computer science it's going to go towards giving a tour to school in an underserved community and for every thousand dollars raised we're going to donate our complete k25 curriculum to the school that has demonstrated a need so the school being considered are facing extreme hardship either financially or academically but they're committed to making a difference in the lives of their students and they believe that computer science is a way towards that so if you believe that your school or community to benefit from this please apply there's an application in the link below thank you so much and let's do it let's make this happen I
