whoohoo let's go hi I'm Doreen I'm the director of curriculum at codable the short video is going to introduce you to the concept you'll be teaching in this unit thanks for watching variables are used to store information in a program you can think of them like a box or a container with a label on it that's related to the items inside these items inside are called values and they can be stored as either numbers or text when you use a variable in a program you control the output of a program or what the user sees there are different types of variables that can be used in different situations strings integers and arrays we're going to talk about integers which are whole numbers that can be positive negative or zero in programming integers are values that are written and stored as numbers and they're often called int it's are used for two different reasons in programming to store values and to run leaps in our programs let's think about a person as a variable here in a real life example age is a value that's associated with a person just like a name is as we talked about in our string example since age is a value that's written as a number we store it that way in our code variables can change just like a person's age increases by one each year we talk to us students will practice strings during their independent practice lessons with variables students will apply integers the same way students will put a number in the command bin that matches the value to a variable assigning matching values will clear the asteroid field when the integer is launched toward the asteroids in this lesson my ship variable contains an integer and is going to apply that value to the asteroid if the value matches the asteroid will disappear students need to think critically about how to clear the asteroid field and as few moves as possible in this level I match my integer value with the value in the center of the asteroid field and the remaining light values touched and clear themselves let's talk about how ants are used to store values in a program by revisiting our video game example that we used for Strings we talked about how a character's name hair color and eye color are all stored as string in a videogame but what about how big a character is or how long her hair is these are all numbered values so we use intz to tell the computer what the character should look like in the videogame when the player sees it on the screen integers make it easy for programmers to reuse values in their programs ants also allow us to run loops by telling the computer how many times to complete a certain task this makes it easy for us to carry out complex processes and do so much more with our programs
