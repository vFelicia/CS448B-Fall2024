let's go think about a task where you have to do the same thing multiple times let's say you have to clear the table after a family dinner you pick up a plate bring it to the sink wash it off and dry not too hard right but what if you have a big family and you need to do this for every family members dish maybe this means repeating the same task six times computers require very specific instructions to perform their tasks so if you wanted to tell your robot friend to do the dishes instead you couldn't just say clean all the dishes it's not specific enough if you want a computer to repeat the same action six times you would need to write six separate lines of code the same exact instructions over and over and over so annoying right fortunately there is a way to tell a computer to repeat an action without needing to repeat all the code this command is called a loop in programming loops are the third of the flow control structures and allow us to use just one command to repeat the same process multiple times and complete a task loop's are all about keeping your code dry dry means don't repeat yourself so what's the problem with repetition well typing out the same code over and over increases programming time also if you have to write the same thing again and again you're more likely to make a mistake somewhere make your code shorter with a loop now it's easier to debug and save you time so what does a loop look like in a program well in JavaScript loops look like this this code will loop six times but in potable this is what we use to program a loop this loop err will repeat two commands a certain number of times to achieve an outcome a block of code like this works the same as code like this in both your Fuzz will move right up right up but what do you notice about the two programs this first option is shorter and drier it will only take up one command bin in the game the second option is not try at all it uses four commands and repeats the same commands twice now it's your turn use as few commands as possible to get the fuzz through the maze start by looking at the maze for patterns here I want my fuzz to move right and then down right down right down right instead of dragging out all those repeating commands I can use the looper and set it to loop the commands down and right three times I went from needing six commands to only one when you think you figured out how to dry up your code like this test it out good luck if you liked this video let us know by giving it a thumbs up and be sure to subscribe if you want to see more happy coding
