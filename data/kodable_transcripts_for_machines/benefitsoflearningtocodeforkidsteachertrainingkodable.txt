my guess is if you're watching this webinar chances are you do have some idea of how coding education can benefit your students but you might not know all the details and that's why we're here so i've broken this section down into three parts the benefits for students the benefits for teachers because there are some benefits for you and some benefits for admin and and schoolwide benefits as well so first benefits for students this is likely why we're bringing coding into the classroom we want uh to help our students be the best that they can be and that's what we're going to talk about now so the first big benefit is the soft skills that students learn while coding that can be helpful in all areas of school and beyond unlike hard skills that can be learned and evaluated these soft skills are they're a little bit more subtle they're they're harder to identify and they might be a little bit more difficult to measure but they are developed and fostered and nurtured through practice so we're talking about skills like teamwork and collaboration creative thinking and problem solving mental flexibility resilience and work ethic traditional schooling requires teachers to cover so much specific content knowledge that kids will be tested on so finding time to nurture and practice these soft skills can be really difficult and coding is one way to actively practice these soft skills that are you know they're equally as important these are skills that are going to serve them for their entire life so coding can really help with those soft skills for sure the next is developing executive functioning skills similar to soft skills that are a little bit harder to target in traditional school but are still vital for future success coding can help target executive function skills like planning planning ahead selfpacing figuring out what pace would work best for you of working on a task by yourself working memory so remembering things in a short period of time and adaptability when faced with challenges so when presented with a challenge how do you respond and get through that challenge coding since there are so many opportunities to make mistakes but then also identify them and solve them it's really great for staying adaptable when faced with challenge and in general developing those executive function skills the third benefit for students is language development i think we all know that children are are better able to learn new languages when they're younger and code is just that it's a language and sometimes it's easy to forget that but it is a language that children can learn when they're younger they'll have a faster time to catch on as opposed to us adults who are interested in learning to code when we're older and we have a little bit more difficulty as well as being able to learn a language faster when they're younger language learning has been shown to improve a lot of things with student cognitive function so that includes you know enhanced problemsolving skills improved verbal abilities again better memory and creative thinking so because code is a language and language development has a lot of these benefits i just like to point that out it's one more benefit for your students and then the fourth one is increased selfefficacy so when we're talking about selfefficacy we're referring to a couple things one includes mental flexibility so how children are judging their own abilities their confidence levels their confidence in the ability to like exert control over one's own motivation and behavior and social environment uh coding and computer science lessons have been linked to increased selfefficacy especially for early elementary students these students have been shown to be more likely to stay on task to stay motivated to control their responses to stimuli in the classroom so that's another huge benefit for coding education so in summary for your benefits for students coding skills translate to many different areas and benefits students far beyond just learning to code which is why i love it so much okay up next is benefits for teachers so while i'm guessing most of you might be implementing a coding program for the benefit of your students there are some additional benefits for teachers that are a huge added bonus so the first is a classroom culture crafting a classroom culture that is meaningful for you and your students so what i mean by this is that coding can be difficult and by incorporating it you're telling your students that your classroom is a safe place to try something new to take a risk to come up and generate with multiple possible solutions um when i was teaching i know my students would come to my classroom at their recess or their lunch breaks to just to ask crazy questions or to pitch a project idea just to let their creativity kind of run wild because they knew that the coding classroom that they entered was a place where they could do that they didn't have to do everything perfect they just had to put forward effort and express themselves how they wanted so even if you don't have your own classroom dedicated to coding if you are trying to incorporate coding or computer science into a math classroom or an english classroom just know that by doing so you are bringing in opportunities for problem solving and for risk taking and that's something really special for classroom culture and as well coding is oftentimes you know project based which means students have the opportunity to bring in their own personal expression to your classroom so you have that opportunity for responsive teaching the second benefit for teachers is we talked about it a little bit on the last slide but student engagement and motivation as i mentioned on that student benefits slide coding and computer science has been linked to increased student engagement and motivation to learn really so this is obviously great news for your kiddos but it's a huge plus for you as the teacher it's so much more fun and easy to teach when students are excited to be at school and excited to be learning which really is the key coding is fun and my students were motivated in class because it was something different it was something that was drawing on parts of their their brain that the other classes weren't the other subjects weren't you get to make things and share projects so seeing my students happy was a real benefit to me and i'm happy and engaged and motivated and i'm sure it would be for you too and then the third benefit for teachers is going to be student selfsufficiency again they all kind of weave together but the nature of coding is filled with trial and error forming hypotheses testing iterating debugging you know there will be an uncountable number of times where students need to get unstuck and the joy of coding is that there are possible ways to make that happen so you'll see students helping themselves helping their classmates to solve their problems in a way that works for them and practice is key right so if you bring coding into your classroom and there are so many chances for them to solve their own problems they are going to reach selfsufficiency faster um this example on the right this picture you're seeing was sent to us from a teacher who uses codable in their classroom and it's filled with recommendation questions that students can ask each other when they get stuck so it's a way for kids to help each other and to not have to raise their hand and ask the teacher when they're stuck every single time they can solve the problem on their own with the help from their classmates and that's really great finally there are benefits for school admin or for schoolwide benefits as well and these are somewhat similar to benefits for teachers but i do think it's worth mentioning them on a schoolwide a schoolwide scale a bigger scale so the first bringing coding into your school can increase that culture of hard work we've talked about it a bunch but it's asking questions creative problem solving this doesn't need to be siloed to a single computer science room and frankly it shouldn't be it should be schoolwide and i've seen a lot of schools have success when teachers buy in and are infusing coding or stem into every subject and not treating it just as an extra i think this is important because when we treat computer science or stem as an addon then our students are smart and they're learning that that stem and coding is separate from english and math and science and social studies when in the real world they're all really linked together stem and coding and computer science touch all of these subjects once they leave the school yard so i do like to encourage schools to be incorporating this and not treat it as separate that said fully integrating stem into a curriculum takes a ton of time and it's not going to happen overnight but i do think that coding especially is a a good smaller place to start and then a third benefit for admin is exposing children to new career paths you've likely seen some sort of a chart or like a bar graph that shows how exposure to computer science at a young age increases the likelihood that that child will pursue it again in the future either in graduate study or as a career and that is still totally true we never know what sort of interest we can spark with a new subject or a new experience so bringing coding into the classroom or into the school is a good way to expose students to something that they might not have realized was a possibility for them
