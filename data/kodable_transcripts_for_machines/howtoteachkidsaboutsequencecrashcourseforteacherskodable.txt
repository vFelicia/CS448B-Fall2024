whoohoo let's go hi I'm Doreen I'm the director of curriculum at codable the short video is going to introduce you to the concept you'll be teaching in this unit thanks for watching people are smarter than computers we decide what actions we want the computer to carry out and then we communicate with the computer in a language that it understands in order to complete a desired task we call this language code and we instruct the computer using specific commands sequence the order that commands are executed by the computer allows us to carry out tasks that have multiple steps we can relate sequence to our everyday lives if we wanted to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for example we would need to follow multiple steps in a logical order we'd begin by gathering our ingredients getting a knife spreading the peanut butter spreading the jelly and so forth if we want to get robot to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for us we would need to make sure we gave the robot instructions in the correct order if we didn't do this we could potentially miss a step have a missing ingredient or end up with an insideout peanut butter and jelly sandwich in programming computers can only carry out tasks that are in the correct order computers are machines and they have to do things the way they were built to do them in the on screen independent practice lessons for sequence the fuzz needs to be given instructions in the correct sequence to get through the maze using arrows as commands we need to give the fuzz instructions in the correct sequence or the fuzz will hit the wall of the maze computers read in a certain order similar to a typewriter which can only go left to right and top to bottom a computer has to read code in order if the sequence of the commands is incorrect the computer won't be able to follow the instructions in both programming and daytoday tasks if we don't put every step in the right order the end result isn't what we tried for sequence is the most foundational concept in programming and everything we learn moving forward will build on this concept
