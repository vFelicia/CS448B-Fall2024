hi everyone happy hour of code my name is gretchen hebner and this is hannah boston uh we're two members of the codable team uh and we are so excited to bring you the hour of code webinar we're going to go over all the things that you i'm sorry we're going to go over all the things that you need to do to prepare for the hour of code this year um so i am one of the founders of codable uh this is my i guess seventh hour of code hooray yay uh hannah is uh newer to the codable team than seven years ago but she's not she is a veteran hour of coder um hannah do you want to introduce yourself a little bit tell us a little bit about what you do at codable sure so i am the instructional designer and coach at codable so my main role is supporting you guys the teachers creating teacher guides videos anything that you need to do to feel confident teaching coding with your elementary students and lately i've been making a lot of our student facing videos so the videos you might watch to prep for the hour of code i helped to create those so if you guys have any questions recommendations for future videos lesson plans worksheets anything like that that's what i'm working on so yeah i'm really excited for the hour of code this year it's going to be a good one yeah yeah it's going to be great even though it might be a little bit different a lot of you submitted questions asking about how to participate in the hour of code virtually or in a hybrid model because things are wild right now everybody is in a different situation so we're going to talk a lot about ways that you can do the hour of code virtually with your students or practicing social distancing uh and what have you uh so with that i'm gonna hop into the agenda just tell you guys a little bit about what we're gonna cover today so first and foremost we're gonna start off strong talking about how to do the hour of code during a pandemic um and we'll get into how to prepare uh and this is the same whether you are in person or uh teaching virtually what you need to do to prepare uh to teach with your students um what will students be doing so we'll go over some of the tutorials we'll go over how to log them in uh or how to tell them to log in if they're doing that from home uh then we'll talk a little bit about how to recognize their achievements some of the different things that you can see on your teacher dashboard after the hour of code is completed and how you can recognize them uh we'll go over some more of our virtual learning tools and these aren't specific to the hour of code these are just tools that you can use uh you know to use codeable but they are very helpful for the hour of code so we went over them a little bit in our back to school webinar if any of you were at that um but we wanted to be sure to mention all of them here again today and then we have a set of we have set aside some time at the end of the webinar for uh questions and answers some of you guys posted questions but we will also be taking questions from the audience so there's a little chat window over on the right hand side of the video and you can post your questions there brie gray is our um director of customer success she is hanging out in the chat answering all of your questions she is the best person to answer questions uh so she will get to them as quickly as she can if she doesn't get to it we'll talk about it on air um and there there's also an agenda floating around we sent it in the email and there's just helpful resources in there everything that we post and talk about today is covered in that agenda so um if you are like oh no i need that link you can go to the agenda and find the link so uh but we'll also post some links in the chat all right with that i'm going to hop into um what to do during the hour of code during pandemic okay so um the hour of code is a magical moment in every year uh where we talk about the importance of learning to code we introduce what coding is to our students and it's a worldwide event organized by code.org to um just get kids to try one hour of coding and there's no reason that we can't do this we fully believe in you guys and we've done everything we can to to prepare resources for you to do this virtually if that's what's happening in your school so um you do not need to know how to code to teach an hour of code your students do not need to have any previous coding experience it is designed to be a beginner experience so if this is your first hour of code we've got you you're going to come out of this prepared and if it's your fifth or seventh like me uh welcome back we're so glad to have you so um i will i think that's everything oh i did want to make sure to mention that um the hour of code is an event to honor grace hopper who is a awesome woman and she was an early pioneer in computer science she created the first compiler and every year the hour code is a week long celebration to celebrate her birthday she was born on december 7th and she was an admiral in the u.s navy and she created the first compiler she's also famous for coining the phrase bug because she found a moth in the room sized computer that she was working on uh and it was causing the computer not to work so that's where the phrase bug came from it's from an actual bug it was a moth stuck in a computer um so with that i think we are ready to move on to how to prepare um so hannah is going to take you through all of the resources that you can look through to prepare to teach the hour code with your students um and she's going to go over some of the activities and then i'm going to talk about setup so hannah thank you gretchen so yes i'm going to talk about how to prepare the first thing you can do to prepare is log into your teacher dashboard and we have created a brand new tab on the teacher dashboard titled hour of code that has all the resources you could possibly need to prep for the hour of code and teach it to your students so this is the hour of code tab it's right at the top of your teacher dashboard and it's bolded so you can't miss it and you'll see the first thing at the top is the how to hour of code with codable video everything that i'm about to mention is summarized in a short four minute video right here at the top of your hour of code page so if you feel like i'm moving too fast or you just want to review the steps that i'm talking about here to prepare i definitely recommend you log into your dashboard view this hour of code page and check out the video it'll be super helpful for you so the first step to prepare for the hour of code is going to be to decide where and how you will run the hour of code this means what devices your students will be using to do the hour of code activities the tutorials so this is going to look really different for all of us some of you might be face to face and have ipads or some sort of inschool device to use with your students other teachers might have students that are remote and maybe you don't know exactly what devices they're using we do have an ios app so any student with an ios device like an ipad or an iphone can participate in the hour of code and we also have all the hour of code activities available via the web so it doesn't totally matter what devices your students are using it'll just be helpful for you to plan ahead so you know how to help them for login and things like that but this year we're also really excited to share that we have a totally unplugged lesson for the hour of code that's just worksheets that students can complete so if your students do not have access to tech devices that is okay we got you covered and we have an unplugged activity for you this year so step one decide where and how the second step to prepare for the hour of code will be to choose a tutorial so on this hour of code page if you scroll down we have all of our tutorials or that's the hour of code speak for activity or project we have them all featured here at the bottom and we have five featured activities this year we have a bunch more i think there's 15 plus activities you can choose from but these are the five that we that we recommend for beginner coders and beginner teachers they have the most supports with them so i'm going to walk through the different activities we have available to you but again i definitely recommend you explore the hour of code page yourself you might find another activity that you'd like to use with your students so the first activity that we have available is the intro to programming prereaders welcome if you are new to codable or your students are younger we had a couple questions write in about what's the best activity for my kindergartners or my first graders we definitely recommend this intro to programming it'll introduce students to the coding basics like sequence conditions loops and functions and it's just an introduction to the codeable game so it'll give students four different games to choose from and they can work through the game levels they are selfguided selfpaced so students can kind of control their learning experience with very minimal prep or instruction from you the teacher the second it's a great option for free play too if you're just wanting to have them do free play that's a great great job absolutely yeah because it's self exactly thanksgiving it's selfpaced and so free play um would be an awesome option for that activity uh the second one that we have featured here is make your own codable mazes oh and i just wanted to point out we have all the grade recommendations listed below the activity as well um the second one is make your own codeable mazes so here students are guided through five different levels of codable and then they complete a maze building challenge that's aligned with common core math standards so in the game the students will choose their grade level and then the challenge that they are presented will be aligned with common core math for that grade level so that's a really great one if you're looking for a way to integrate coding into some of your other subjects like math this would be a great one for you plus as kids get to make their own mazes they can express their creativity and get artistic so that is a great option for you guys the third one here is beach cleanup if you did the hour of code with codable last year you'll know that beach cleanup was brand new last year this year we have it again and we've revamped it given it a little bit of a facelift and so this is an awesome option if you want to integrate with environmental science in this activity students learn to program using basic commands and clean up the fuzztopia beach to protect the ocean life the sea creatures so in this activity students will also be designing a maze that connects different pieces of trash and then they code their fuzz through the maze to collect the recycling and this one has three or four different tutorial videos available in the game itself so if you are looking for an activity that has more video support so you don't need to do the direct instruction the kids can click the video and watch it at their own pace at their own time the beach cleanup has those videos embedded in the game so super easy for them to review the concepts and learn as they go and the final one featured here on this page is the build your own fuzz this is an awesome activity if you want students to get creative and design and code their own fuzz character the fuzzes are the characters of codable so students will code and modify properties to bring their character to life and we do recommend here grades two through five because the activity features real javascript syntax so upper elementary students can often do a little bit of a better job making the connections between the javascript syntax and the properties that are shown on their fuzz but again all of these activities are great for all ages students will just modify them to to be appropriate if your kindergartners want to design a fuzz that is aokay they might just not understand the javascript syntax but they'll still get to modify properties and get exposed to code in that way and finally i'll just click this view all button and scroll down a bit and you'll see the first activity underneath the four that are featured is our coding basics unplugged this activity is completely unplugged you'll have to print out worksheets for your students but after that they can use pen and paper and it's a lot of our coding puzzles just in an unplugged format so it's great if students again do not have access to tech devices or if you're just looking for another option if you want to combine unplugged and plugged in this is an option for you and then as you can see there's a bunch more to choose from that integrate into a lot of other subjects like robotics and english so you can take your pick all of these activities can be completed in an hour for the hour of code so they're all here available to you again on your dashboard at the hour of code tab and after you've picked your tutorial the third and final step to prepare is to spread the word so the hour of code as gretchen mentioned is a magical time it's really exciting and i know a lot of us could use a little bit of a boost this year right now so hype up the hour of code your students get to be really creative and it's very fun so get them excited and the other piece to spreading the word is to give them virtual participation instructions so we have that tab right here at the top you can download this participation guide it walks through all the steps students and or their families will need to follow to get logged in and coding so we wanted to make it as easy for you as possible if you send this home and students follow all the steps they should be able to log in to the hour of code and complete their activity so you can email those post it to a class page hand them out in person whatever works best for you but those participation instructions are right there so you can use them how you need and i think that covers all of the activities that we have available this year if you guys have any questions about this page please let us know and again i definitely recommend watching that how to hour of code with codable video it summarizes everything i just mentioned in a bit of a shorter package so with that said i'm going to pass it back off to gretchen to go over how to get students set up since now you've chosen your tutorial you can get the students set up and coding thank you hannah okay so uh i just want to quickly tell you all make sure that uh if you're playing in person if you're using school devices please make sure that you are updated to the latest version of codable so that you have access to the hour of code activities uh some of them have been updated uh and others you know if it's on an older version then it might not have the we have like a timed release for the activities so that they'll show up at a certain date so if it's an old version it might not have the newest activity so please be sure to update your devices if you're playing on the web um you can save the link to whatever activity you choose for your students and post that to your class page or send it home in an email just like hannah said and that will take students directly to the activity that they need to play so i'm just going to quickly walk you through what students are going to see and what they're going to do um so i actually have a question that i think i should probably address first so i have multiple classes with hundreds of students total how can i get the class code to all of my students in the easiest way so like hannah mentioned i think that there are great ways to send home the class code to students we have we're going to go over our all of our virtual learning tools at the end of this and there are three different ways that you can actually send home your class code one of them is with like a pdf that has um the class code on it and instructions on how to log into codable uh so that would be the probably my choice but then there's also like a spreadsheet you can use there's lots of different options so we'll go over oh go over that at the end um we also have ways to add students in bulk so if you're planning to use codeable with a lot of students and you haven't added them decodable yet you can learn more about how to add students in bulk by going to our support center at support codable.com and there you'll find instructions on how to add students in bulk many classes all at once we have google classroom integration clever integration and uh we have our own bulk importer if you're planning to do it that way so lots of options um okay so uh the last thing that i'll say before i show things is that we do encourage so quotable is accessible without a codeable account so if you are a teacher using codable for the very first time and you have you have not set up an account you do not have to have an account to use it um you can go to game.google.com hour code you can direct your students here and there's an option to play without saving um so i'm just going to show you how to do that um and that's here game.codable.com hour of code if you do have a codeable account you can also come here this thing's blocking it there you go you can see it's got a play without saving button and that's where students can go to play um but it will not save their progress it's a onetime use they can come back many times but every time it's going to start them from the beginning so if you're using codable and you don't want to set up classes that's a good way to do it however we do recommend setting up classes just because number one it's free you can use with as many students as you want um but number two you're going to have all of their progress saved you're going to be able to send home instructions you have access to all of these great resources that hannah has covered so i do recommend setting up a class or setting up an account and creating classes like i mentioned there's lots of ways you can add students in bulk okay with that i'm going to show you how students are going to log in so if you're playing on the web and you chose an activity um when you click on that activity you're going to get this little landing page this is the link that i would share with your students because they can just click this play online button and enter their class code and it's going to take them directly to the activity uh without needing to kind of search for it in the in the game all right here we are beach cleanup so i can just click on beach cleanup and start playing um we do have options for instructional videos along with this and they are accessible from that landing page and they're also available on our youtube channel which you are all on presently so you can find them there they're also available on your teacher dashboard on the videos page so um they're they're available in a lot of different places uh and they are also on the lesson plan so you you should have them um so what you would do in this activity click play choose your difficulty level and i'm just going to show you guys how to play uh beach cleanup just so that you are familiar with it because sometimes it can be a little tricky so what you do you want to connect all of these recycling bins or the recycling symbols and program your fuzz through the maze um so this is a really simple sequence level i'm gonna go forward down forward up forward back down and right to go out however it looks like we're going to need a condition i'm just going to add a condition here and we'll talk a little bit about what a condition is um but one thing to point out is that this path can be anything your students want it to be so it's a lot of creativity involved in this activity um you know students thinking about the best way to get through the maze if you want to encourage them not to use a condition um if they haven't learned what conditions are they can re re rearrange this maze uh to remove the condition so and then we have oh i forgot the videos are accessible here as well so here's how to play uh the easy version of codable um just click that little question mark and it's gonna have hannah walk them through how to play um so i'm gonna click play oh i did it just enough moves yes okay i'm gonna click test it and see what happens looks like i'm gonna make it to the end those little penguins are so cute okay so your students can choose to save the maze and that's going to save it to their projects uh on your teacher dashboard or and they can also go on to the next level so um that's just a quick demo of how to get students logged in what they will experience if they're playing beach cleanup um i'm gonna go back out and just show you this is where students go to the uh make your own quotable mazes this is where students will go to build their own characters uh if they if you chose the free play option it would actually take them to uh flustopia and mission control where they can play through codable at their own pace choose from any of the four codeable worlds to play on um and you know kind of experience codable in its entirety at their own pace um i believe that covers it let me just double check my notes real quick yeah i think the only other thing that might be helpful to mention here on the fostopia screen is if your kids do somehow navigate themselves to this screen and you're wondering how to get back to all of those hour of code activities there is a beach hut underneath the home building that has the hour of code sign on it and that's what your kids your students can click in order to get back to the hour of code activities sometimes it can be tricky if they get kicked out for whatever reason so that's how they find their way back yes thank you hannah and that brings up a good point which is that um this method of sending out the tutorial link to your students with the landing page to bring them directly here works on the web however if they're playing at home um and they're on an ios device or if you're in school on an ios device there's no way for us to like directly to the specific activity so what you're going to do is have them click on this hour code hut when they first come in to the game and tell them which activity you want them to do um so they will land here on fuzztopia and you're going to want to direct them to the hour of code hud if you're playing on ios thank you i meant to mention that yes um yeah okay um and next up on our agenda is recognizing uh what students are recognizing student achievement um so i'm gonna quickly share my screen so that you guys can see my student progress um great okay so um after the hour of code kids are gonna be super excited about coding uh they you know are jazzed up because they've been playing in a really fun game for an hour uh and it's a great opportunity to um recognize what they've just done and also to share with their family about what you are doing in the classroom whether that's a virtual classroom or an inperson classroom um and here is where you can find what students have been doing so i'm gonna click on one of my classes and i'm going to click on my famous class okay so here i can see my students progress and everything that they've achieved uh while they were playing codable this is where you'll find progress from the free play option so if students are just playing encodable they're playing that introduction to programming beginner prereaders welcome activity this is where you're gonna see their progress you can view individual students um you can see different levels that they completed you can see what concepts they were working on um and all of this is being reworked by fabulous hannah um so keep an eye on this page for cool updates um you can also view creation so if you assigned the fuzz builder tutorial or the maze maker tutorial this is where you can actually see what your students created so i can see all of the fuzzes that my students made i can actually get a pdf version of that fuzz and send it home to their family and let them see it it's going to show me the code that the student wrote so i can actually see what my student wrote and the code that they wrote to create their fuzz um so that's a really fun way to recognize student achievement if they created any sort of you know fun creation same with maze maker you're going to be able to see yeah here we go you're going to be able to see sorry these are really old mazes they're not showing up um you're going to be able to see the maze and print to share with the family and lastly i will show you where you can find certificates this is a big hit every year everyone wants certificates for their students so um and it's a great way to recognize what they've been working on so if you want to download certificates for your students you just select the classes that you want to include um and then this is going to generate a pdf with their with their names on it so find my and that'll have each individual student a certificate with their name on it for you to send home all right um one of the questions that we have gotten in the past is how to invest and promote to the outside community i.e parents um about what you're doing in the classroom and i think that um a great way to do that if just the low touch easy way of doing it is sharing these resources with them um letting them know what your child has been doing it's what their child has been doing at school um and you know what you're trying to accomplish with it so we have a very nice letter to families that you can get from our virtual learning page and um here it is and that's just introducing them to what coding is why it's important and what you've been doing with codable at school at school whether it's in person or remotely um and it also includes their class code on it so this is a great option if you want to and it's the same situation where you just generate the pdf and it has student names and their class code and it with instructions for parents to log in so that's a great way to get the uh to both generate you know interest and investment from the larger community um but also to get your class codes at home to hundreds of kids all the same time so with that i'm going to hand it over to hannah who has more to share about our virtual learning tools awesome yes so i am going to walk through some more of those tools that was just on the virtual learning page that gretchen was sharing so if we take a look back at this page we put this together at the beginning of or over the summer to help you guys with virtual learning remote learning during this school year it will these resources like gretchen had mentioned these will be really useful whether or not you are teaching fully virtually if you're in a hybrid model or you are face to face it's just helpful tools tips and tools that can be used both in a virtual setting and in person so i'll just walk through what these tools are again you can find this tab it's right below the hour of code tab on your teacher dashboard so this first section here at the top is awesome if you haven't used this yet i highly recommend it and this is a unique url for all of your classes so let's say you teach 10 different elementary coding classes and you have a lot of families of your students who are wondering what is my my child's class code how do they log in what's their password they just need support with login you can send this single url you can copy it post it on a class page send it in an email to all of the families of your students no matter what class they're in and i will just click this so you can see what it looks like it'll it'll look like this so the one piece of information that families will need to know is the name of their child's class so these are all of the classes that i have listed out if i am a parent and i know my child is in the fifth grade class they can go to this url click this url they can view the class and then choose their child and download login instructions here so this came to be because we had a lot of requests from teachers who were asking for more support in getting a bunch of login information to a large group of students so that is the way to do it again i found that right here on the virtual learning resources page copy the link send it out and they can look up the class code and the password for their child's account all of that information they might need to have a successful hour of code remotely some other useful tools on this page include a student info list so this is similar information all of the class codes passwords login information for all of your students exported in a really easy to read csv so that's available here we have the worksheet packets that are also included in the unplugged hour of code activity that you can take a look at you can download them here as well another super useful thing that has been really successful during the covid shutdowns were video lessons so if i click view videos it's going to kick me over to the the video tab here on the left and you can choose between explain videos so videos that instruct and teach a new concept as well as create videos videos that pose some sort of a creative prompt and ask students to complete a project so beyond the hour of code if you're looking for some support with coding lessons if you want some instructional videos or some creative activities you can take a look here on your dashboard so all of these videos are super short there's not any that are over five minutes long you can assign them directly to students you can share a link to your class page and we have videos for every single concept that we cover in codable and i just wanted to point out in the create section we update these pretty regularly we just had an activity for halloween and we had a fall themed activity as well that's unplugged so if you're still looking for some fall themed content you can show this video and students cr complete a short unplugged activity so that is available to you from the video section i'm back at the virtual learning uh just to go over the last of the tools here so there's a virtual learning kickoff lesson if you are new to codable or i mean i guess even if you're not new to codable and you're just looking for some sort of structured lesson to introduce or to reacquaint students with the fuzz family of codable uh before the hour of code definitely check out this kickoff lesson it's just a slide stack you can make a copy of it and edit it however you wish but i included here a bunch of prompts i included some videos that introduced the fuzz family there's a couple other tips for getting logged in it walks students through everything they might need as well as an introduction to fuzztopia so if you want some sort of a lesson to introduce students to codable and the fuzz family before you start the hour of code that is available to you here gretchen mentioned the letters to families and then we also have a blog the codable blog that we are updating multiple articles a week right now that include tips and tricks for teaching virtually different unplugged activities different coding activities in general so definitely follow our codable blog if you're looking for some regularly updated coding content and we're posting a lot over there and those are the virtual learning resources please take advantage of this page and if you notice anything's missing if you think oh it would be super helpful if i had this feature that i don't see here please fill out this is just a link to a google form you can make make a suggestion i've been reading through those and it gives us some inspiration for what to create in the future so we can make this as easy for you guys as possible and with that i will move on to our the last thing i wanted to share which is just that if you are new to codable and you haven't set up a class yet and you don't know too much about all of the dashboard logistics i will say that we covered everything you could possibly need to know about setting up a class managing your classes adding passwords changing a class code all of these things in our back to school webinar and we've linked to that webinar in the webinar agenda for this hour of code webinar so you can check out that link to the back to school one it's also on our youtube page which i know you can find because you're here already and that'll just give you a quick rundown if you want kind of a refresher of what gretchen was talking about with my classes and progress we go over all of it so i definitely recommend you check out the back to school webinar if you're looking for more help setting up a class and then of course reach out to us if if there's still some confusion there and we can help get you set up before the hour of code kicks off next week i just realized uh we had a request for you to turn up your mic or i guess maybe speak a little louder um sorry everyone i know we're 38 minutes into this but that's that's been a request so sorry okay don't worry no worries okay so i could i didn't notice but others others have requested it so um i think it's time to move on to q a all right cool so we have some questions from the audience uh one of them that i wanted to be sure to mention um is from karen okdahl long time codabler uh how or does the easy difficulty level migrate into the harder levels as the students progress and she's talking specifically about the beach cleanup activity and it does not so whatever level your students choose so if they choose the easy level they're going to stay in the easy level until they're ready to move on to medium or hard and they can just go back and then play again and select the medium or hard difficulty level with each level of difficulty i should have mentioned this earlier they're going to have new concepts that they can incorporate into their maze designs there's also going to be fewer bins to put in their solution so for example with easy the options are sequence and conditions and they have i think it's eight or nine bins for their answer with the medium they can incorporate loops and they have one less bin and with the hard activity um they can add functions and that has two fewer bins than the easy mode um so i just wanted to be sure to clarify that we also um had some questions um if there can be more than one teacher on a class and there cannot be uh there's only one teacher per class um however on the quotable premium plan you do have the option to um if you're an admin add multiple teachers and so you can actually view student progress you can add the classes for your teachers if you need to but that is on the premium version of quotable only um okay and then i wanted to address some of those are the questions from the chat if anybody has questions that haven't been uh bree's been on it with all of the questions she's watching she always yeah she's been cruising through all these questions um but if there's anything that you have questions about that you would like to ask we will talk about it here but in the meantime i'm going to go ahead and address some of the questions that we got prior to the webinar so um let's see here one of the questions is what is the best way to teach coding virtually and i think we've talked a lot about the different ways that you can teach coding virtually this year all of the different resources that you can use ultimately it's up to you you are the expert you know your class situation every single classroom is experiencing different things right now so we can't be the ones to tell you what the best way to do that is however if you're just starting out if it were me and hannah please correct me if you think i'm wrong but i would definitely start with the like virtual kickoff lesson that hannah showed in the virtual resources section and then just give my kids access to the free play prereaders activity encodable that lets them roam and be free to choose whatever coding activity they want to do and that's what i would do with my students especially if i'm if i'm virtual there's lots of videos that can accompany uh the kickoff lesson and also the um the prereader activity uh they're available on your videos page uh if you want to add a video to kind of enrich the lesson for them um but that's what i would do if it were me hannah anything you want to add to that yeah i agree i think that you know we've been adding video lessons to the dashboard we added from february to now i think 30 different videos so if you're unsure about how to introduce coding in a virtual setting over zoom and you have young students um you know it makes sense that that's that's really tricky and hopefully the video lessons that we have available to you are helpful because i do think that you can create a really rich coding lesson by showing a video and then doing an activity encodable with you know limited prep or instruction needed from you the teacher so if you're unsure about how to teach coding you know we have those supports there for you definitely okay we have a question from the audience uh is there a way to uh archive classes and there's not a way to archive classes so that you can bring them back later but you can delete classes permanently so if you just want to remove classes from your clinical dashboard that are from years past you can delete those classes you can also transfer students so if you have your classes from last year still set up and you still see some of the students and you need to move them to their new homeroom you can transfer students from class to class um easily and in bulk on your teacher dashboard just go to support.codable and search transfer and you'll see an article with instructions on how to do that um okay one question that we got previously was uh we use seesaw and canvas with students can they share their work with a class of peers within these learning management systems and yes uh we actually have some and i'll post this link in the chat for you we actually have some seesaw activities set up for codable on our codable blog and you can use those activities if you want to or just take them as inspiration if you want to create your own hour of code codable seesaw activity specific to your class that's what i would suggest doing because you know the situation you know what you want to ask your students to share that would be a good place to start so i'm just going to place that link here for you and that's the link to all of our seesaw activities you can take a look at them and use them with your students it's a great we love seesaw it's a great way to encourage collaboration even if you're you know your students are learning from home um one of the questions we also had was uh what advice would you give to students that think coding is not for them it's a good question um and what about when it's when it gets hard sometimes just trying again is even more frustrating what are more specific strategies for not giving up i love this question and i think hannah just wrote a great blog post about it hannah can you talk a little bit more about it yeah definitely so i had a really similar experience when i was a computer science teacher i was using a program my students were not very interested and there was a lot of frustration happening and i was struggling a lot i'm trying to teach them and get them excited about it so what ended up working for me was really kind of shifting gears and doing more of an emergent curriculum mindset which meant i scrapped my plans and i tried to focus on relevant topics to the students in their real lives and how i could curate lessons about uh what was actually going on and and different creative projects they could create to solve problems uh in the real world so we did a big design thinking unit and different projects where they were solving problems through engineering and then coding in scratch and using other programs to to try to link it all together so yeah i would say you know it's it can be really tricky if they're not showing interest i would keep trying to tweak and modify your lesson plans to see if there's a project or something creative that they can build that makes coding a bit more relevant to them in their real lives and i did just release a blog post about developing problemsolving skills for young children and how it can be tricky but there are some tools that you can do some anchor charts you can try different tips and tricks in that blog for how to develop creative problem solvers and and how to help students when they face that that moment of unsureness how to help them be resilient so i think we can link that blog that blog post in the chat perhaps but definitely check it out it's up on there and if you need more tips or you want to chat about different ways to modify your curriculum to support those students that are struggling i'm happy to connect individually and and we can chat about that awesome thank you yeah i just asked maria she's another codable team member that's hanging back and behind the scenes making this all work i asked her for the link so she can send it to me to post uh oh great great somebody already posted it awesome way to go team um okay so another question uh that we should address um do you have good videos or recommendations as to how to best introduce the hour of code to elementary students who have never coded before yes uh great question i have two videos that i'm going to link in the um chat for you one of them is a video from codable that we created with some codable kiddos and it's just so much fun we made it a few years ago um then explaining what the hour of code is why it's cool why coding is fun um and what you should do you know if you're another kid and you're interested in coding so i'm gonna link to that here and then there is also a video by code.org that i think is really great um that has a lot of celebrities and famous people and um other you know notable people talking about what coding is and why it is um important to learn so that's also linked here um let me check the chat see if we have any other questions nothing so far okay i'll move on to the next um question how do i optimize the use of codeable for a remote only class with students with disabilities what are recommended strategies um so hannah do you want to take this one sure so i would again that remote kickoff lesson that i shared on the virtual learning resources page i think that would be really helpful for students of any developmental level because it does have a lot of pictures and steps that are clearly mapped out so i i think in terms of introducing codable having that kind of map where you can follow slide by slide picture by picture step by step can be really helpful for kids who have just for students who have disabilities so that would be a good place to start for codable because i know it can be pretty overwhelming for some students when they first log in and there's so much going on and it can it can be a little over stimulating so breaking it down into really manageable bitesized pieces is a good first step i would say gretchen did you want to add anything um no i think mainly the the only other thing i would say is that codable is uh not designed for students with disabilities we didn't have that um need in mind when we were designing it um we do have lots of teachers that use it successfully with their students with disabilities we are however not the experts you're the expert so um i would just say you know you know your class best and use your discretion uh when you're you know making choices for your students um we do have a lot of student or teachers in the codable community that use it with you know their students with disabilities i would pose a question on twitter to the to them um and see you know if you get some responses that way um and yeah that that covers it um okay the next question is i teach about 600 students in grades k to five is there a limit to how many students i can assign levels to lessons to uh and no there's not there's no limit on the number of students that you can use codable with um although we do have a question in the chat that is relevant to this so i'll be sure to mention it um classes are limited to 50 students so you can break up classes into sections of 50 if you need to the reason we have a limit is for loading uh concerns but also usability if you can imagine a hundred names scrolling through that as a kindergartener would be a nightmare for you and a nightmare for them so we do limit it to 50 students and if you have um more than 50 students in a class i would suggest breaking them up by alphabetically or in some other way to create classes that make sense for you and for your students um and i think that that covers it so the next question is um our school district has the codable app available to students on the on clevver how should they log in this is a great question we have a lot of clever users and a lot of clever fans and um what i would suggest is different from what we've covered so far in the webinar i would suggest actually logging in directly the way that your students are used to in clever don't deviate from what your students have learned to to do to log into codable um log in and then have them go to that beach cleanup i'm sorry not be clean the hour of code hut that's that we showed you earlier on flustopia um so what you would do is just have them log in with clever and then click on the hour of code hut underneath of the little home and that will direct them to all of the hour of code activities yeah and i included a an image of that hour of code hut in the webinar agenda so you know exactly what image kids are looking for when they log in so hopefully it's easy to find yes definitely okay are there any other questions we've we've covered it all um in just under an hour so um but if anybody has any final questions you'd like us to address um please post them into the chat we'll wait a couple of minutes but um maybe maybe a minute um but i think that we've covered most everything um thank you all so so much for joining us for participating for being brave enough to be a teacher in this wild year we really appreciate you all um i know that it's been difficult i know that there's been a lot of uncertainty um so we really appreciate you all we are glad that you joined us and we are glad you're planning to do the hour of code this year because it's such an important activity for our students um to just get them engaged in learning and get them engaged in learning about a skill that's going to be useful for the rest of their lives so um i think that that's everything we don't have any other questions uh brie just posted the agenda again in the chat so uh everything that we've talked about is linked in there um if you have any other questions you can always reach out to us at support clinical.com thank you all right bye everyone happy hour of code
