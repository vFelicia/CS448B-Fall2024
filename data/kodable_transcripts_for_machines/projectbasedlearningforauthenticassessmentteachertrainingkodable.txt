student engagement and enjoyment of coding curriculum is critical and there is an exciting fun way to combine computer science education with that assessment method we mentioned design scenarios and that is projectbased learning this is also a big buzzword i'm sure you've heard about it before but i'd like to touch on it with computer science in mind and kind of give you an outline for how to do projectbased learning in your classroom if you're interested but also why it's a really effective tool for measuring and tracking progress for your students all right so i will move on to the next slide all right so what is projectbased learning projectbased learning i might say pbl is a teaching approach in which students are engaging in and learning through authentic meaningful projects so rather than doing like a summative project at the end you've done your your core curriculum you've reached the end of the unit you're going to do a big project to wrap it up projectbased learning means actually embedding the project and the instruction together like the project is the curriculum it's the whole unit so i really loved this quote that describes projectbased learning as integrating knowing and doing so students learn knowledge and elements of the core curriculum but then they apply it to solve authentic problems and produce results that matter and your kindergarten first grade and second grade students absolutely can do this i've seen some early elementary teachers kind of shy away from the projectbased learning approach because thinking about realworld authentic problems kind of seems big sometimes for our youngest learners but they can handle it and i'll give you an example of a teacher who is doing work like that now so how to implement projectbased learning in the classroom as a computer science teacher you may choose to present a problem or a question that relates to technology since that's the subject that you're teaching or you're trying to incorporate into your classroom and you can try to bed embed authenticity into the project by guiding students to examine computer science technology already in the world around them again early elementary students they know what's going on in the world of technology way more than we know and they can tackle a real world problem through coding and programming i do know it can be tricky to come up with a challenging problem or a question for students to solve which is why i definitely recommend following what your students are interested in aim for engagement what we talked about earlier so if your students are interested in topics like protecting the environment or helping animals then you might start with a core essential question related to that subject and then go off of that and the un sustainable development goals that i mentioned back when we were talking about iste um standards that is a great place to start you might recognize that these un goals like i mentioned are they're already iste aligned and you can use them as a resource to guide student learning so this example that you see on the screen this is from a teacher who goes at by at edtech classroom she's on instagram and um and twitter and she honed in on a un sustainable development goal and then asked her students how can we help reduce pollution in our oceans the ideas that they came up with she kind of captured in this web and then from there they developed a project and actually created solutions for this real world challenge and she brought in the codable coding tool to investigate this further what it would mean for keeping beaches clean and how it all connects together so that's a great example of using a resource like the un sustainable development goals like the iste computer science standards and coming up with project ideas from there and then incorporating technology and different coding resources to help out towards the end so why are projects effective evaluation tools we sort of mentioned it when we went over the design scenario as an evaluation method i will just highlight that authentic assessment and evaluation through projectbased learning will allow us to like systematically document a child's progress and development because the project happens over time it's not a single day where anyone could be having a bad day they take a test and it demonstrates that they are in x group and not meeting x standards with a project it's it's a longer you know it's a longer time uh it's longer and time consuming and children have to put more effort towards it for a more sustained amount of time so as the teacher will be able to systematically document their progress from the start of the project to the end and depending on the project pbl can develop a child's ability to work both independently and with their peers building teamwork and group skills and there's so many components as i mentioned that it lets the teacher have multiple assessment opportunities like you could assess the planning stage if you're doing research online you could assess how the research works and their typing skills you can move into the actual solution design stage think about how they are thinking outside the box and being innovative basically it allows you the teacher to learn a lot more about the student as a person and as someone who is working on a project that they care about from start to finish i really love pbl because it refocuses education on the student it's not just the curriculum it's it's like student human based and you're able to capture things that can't be taught or measured with an exam they must be like activated through experience like drive passion creativity empathy um resiliency so i love projects they give you a little glimpse at these intangibles that students have to offer they just might not have the right medium to do it and one last thing computer science is a field that is all about the creation and execution of projects producing websites building software creating video games coders are coding for a purpose there's an outcome there's something that they're working towards it's project based in the real world so i love to mirror that at school and have the things that we're using to evaluate learning be what you would use to evaluate a coder in the real world
