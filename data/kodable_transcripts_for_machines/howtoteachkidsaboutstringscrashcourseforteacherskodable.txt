whoohoo let's go hi I'm Doreen I'm the director of curriculum at codable the short video is going to introduce you to the concept you'll be teaching in this unit thanks for watching variables store information in the program you can think of them like a box or a container with a label on it related to the items inside these items inside are called values and they can be stored as text or as numbers when you use variables in a program you're controlling the output of the program or what the user sees there are different types of variables used in different situations there are strings integers and arrays we're going to talk about string variables which are used to represent text strings hold groups of characters like a word or a phrase making it easier for programmers to read and work with an easy way to think about strings in real life is to think about the way that your brain stores people's names think about a person as a variable hear a name is simply a value that your brain uses to identify a person just like variables have values that can change or vary a person's name can change if they get married or when a friend starts calling them by a new nickname in programming strings allow programmers to easily store find or change information in the program in the final part of each lesson on string variables students will independently practice storing strings which are represented by colors when students put a colored fuzzball into the command bin they're assigning a value to a variable students will match the variable with an astroid type in order to clear the asteroid field when like asteroids touch in the asteroid field they'll automatically clear on their own students need to think critically and use as few variables as possible to clear the asteroid field in this level we can see how students will assign values to variables by using the colored fuzzballs on the left like variables will clear on their own so in this level students only need to clear the yellow asteroids using one yellow string let's think about how strings work in programming we can use a video game as an example and think about how a game developer can control what the players see a character's name eye color and hair color are sorta strings this makes it easy for a programmer to know or change what variables represent specific information in the program a programmer working on the game could type in the variable for a character's eye color for example and edit the value from blue to brown this would instantly change the character's eye color and what the player would see in the game strings make it easy for programmers to find information in their code and reuse values in their programs variables can change think very and strings allow programmers to easily read and change values that are assigned to different variables throughout their programs you
