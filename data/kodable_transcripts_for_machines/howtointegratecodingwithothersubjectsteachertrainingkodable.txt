all right so we're on to our last section this is how to integrate coding with other subjects and if you're a teacher who has been tasked with starting a coding program at your school but you also teach other subjects i understand why this might feel like a huge task you're already teaching a ton of subjects and now you have to teach code which might be something you're not as familiar with and i want to go over this section of the presentation because it's a lot easier than you might think the field of computer science is already totally integrated with math science english a lot of these core concepts from math science and english also our core content in computer science so the connection exists already you are not responsible for finding the connection and forcing them yourself you just need to find the right resources that can do it for you or that can help you and that's what i'm hoping to share with you now so like i said coding integration works and is really intuitive because the field of computer science is naturally integrated without any work from you that said there are ways to provide students with a little bit more i guess i would call it structured integration to help them see those connections that already exist or in other words make those connections more visible my recommendation if you are just starting out with coding is to use coding as a projectbased way to apply other subject knowledge so teaching math for example and also teaching code both subjects might feel overwhelming my recommendation is to not get caught up thinking that you need to teach both concepts separately but rather reframe it for students and show them how you can use code to explore math so i'll give an example let's say you teach a math lesson and you're talking about different shapes and you've like talked about the shapes and you do your little lesson on the shapes you can use coding as a projectbased application of the math concepts of shapes so in that the green coding mission number three thumbnail that you see on the screen here that's a thumbnail from a video that we created where students create shapes using a coding program encodable and so that's a good example of how you could teach a math lesson and then do a coding project you're not necessarily teaching the coding you know what sequence and conditions are but kids are getting familiar with code they're seeing how coding can be used as a tool to explore other subjects further so that's one way that integration can be really effective especially when you're starting out do not feel like you need to teach completely different lessons for coding and completely different lessons for your other subjects they can be taught and they can emphasize each other you can teach them at the same time so other thumbnails that you see here these are all examples of coding missions that's a a creative projectbased challenges that we pose at codable and we're really big on integration you can find a lot of these videos on our videos page perhaps brie could drop that in the chat for you guys so you can take a look but examples might be in that upper left hand corner is an integration between coding and art next the storytelling with conditions that integrates coding and ela in the lower left we have coding and physical education so that's an option and then the two smaller frames that you see here those are snapshots of worksheets that have to do with halloween and thanksgiving which is a good segue to the second type of integration that i recommend which is holiday celebrations so this is another easy way to bring coding into your classroom that is lower lift and holidays in school there's sometimes a really fun opportunity to do something special for a day a special project and i would say that if you're interested in starting coding but you're not really sure where to fit it into your schedule doing a coding project that is related to a holiday is a really great way to do a first step you know at that time your students are in the holiday spirit you are too you're ready to try something new so it's it's a good option at codable we have a ton of video lessons and activities for most of the major holidays and examples on this screen include halloween pie day valentine's day and earth day and you can see too that pi day and earth day videos those are both also going to be really good subject integrations for math and science so again holidays might be a good chance for you to feel out integration see how it goes and based on how it goes you can make a plan to to do some more indepth integration
