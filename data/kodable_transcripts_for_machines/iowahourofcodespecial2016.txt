all right here we are um hi everybody my name is Gretchen humor and I am with the founders of Kota bowl I am so excited to talk with Iowa educators today about the hour of code why it's important how you can get started I just all of the great things that that entails um I've got with me here angel mendez she is from the governor's office she works in the organization called Iowa stem and she's in charge of all the communications and marketing for them and making sure that you guys know about all the wonderful things that they're doing we've been working together for a little while um you know kind of figuring out how to improve um you know the things that are offered to Iowa educators for computer science we've been learning a lot about all the great things that they've been doing and how we can help um and so I'm really excited to have her speak with you guys but first I want to and just quickly go over some of the things we're going to be talking about we're going to go over now the hour of code what it is why it's relevant I think that if you're here you probably already know all that so we'll go over it quickly um and then we'll talk a little bit about what to expect and how you can prepare and then what I'm really excited about is how to prepare so that you can go beyond an hour of code that's a big thing that we've been hearing a lot about from people this year is you know I this is a kickoff for me for the rest of my school year um and some people they've done it before other people this is their first attempt at doing the hour of code and so there you know look excited but a little bit apprehensive about what to expect and so we're just going to go through some of the things you can do to prepare so that you're off and rolling um successfully for the rest of the school year and so without further ado I would like to present angel mendez she's gonna tell you guys what all resources are available specifically for Iowa educators and then we'll get into the details of what to expect right Thank You breslin hi everybody this is angel mendez and the communications manager for the iphone the stem advisors if you've you never the organization before will let me tell you knew Geist it is a resource for STEM education for Iowa educators both in school and out of school there are myriad of things I could tell you about but just know if you go to Iowa stem gov there are a list of everything you can do to get involved with them there's a regional stem manager who is charged with making sure that you're aware of those opportunities and linking you up with those that are most appropriate to you one of those is why we're here today called code Iowa and that's our attempt to localize the hour of code to Iowa and getting more Iowans whether it's parents grandparents kids educators businesspeople lawmakers you name it everyone across Iowa to try one hour of computer coding during computer science education week which is December sent through the 11th I believe just two weeks away and so with code Iowa what we do it's a really a twopart thing the first part is we give away what we call code Iowa technology awards we're giving away six this year however that application closed just last Friday so that opportunity has since closed but it's an annual thing under thirty five hundred dollars to buy instructional technology for your classroom both are sponsored by google and verizon they've been gracious partners in that capacity and so we'll be announcing who those awardees are during computer science education week however there's still a thing for you to get involved in and that is you need to register your event on the hour of code website if you go to our code calm and just scroll towards the bottom of the page there's a join us um place where you put you know what your organization is what your first and last name is I think an email very simple just to say that yes I'm hosting an event in Iowa and this is what it's going to look like and your name will be put on a list on the arm code website where we'll pull from and say these are all of the all of the organizations in Iowa that participate in the hour of code they are now being certified code iowa partners is what we call them and every one of those people on that list will be eligible for computer science trainings that we are planning some in partnership with kota bowl some with oracle academy and some with code org as well coming in the spring and summer of 2017 so if you haven't already registered your event on that website and we'll make sure you get added to that list otherwise I guess I think Gretchen said we wanted to open it for a couple of questions Gretchen I'm seeing any yet that that we can address and regards this the stem Council and what we do I'm not seeing any yet I can we can wait a couple seconds and see if we have any group any role in um I should have said ahead of time you guys can send us questions through Twitter at Kota bowl if you're following a new one use social media if you want to use the chat we've got to check out up here on the left hand side if you're in google hangouts um otherwise if you want to post to the YouTube page where you're watching live you can also do that um so I've got all of those things up if you want to post your question we'll wait a couple minutes our minute or so and see if we have anything roll in um I have a couple of questions for you angel um just while we're waiting uh so what do you think uh you know is one of the challenges that Iowa educators are facing you know getting started with an hour of code is there anything that you guys do to kind of help them overcome that well I think the biggest thing is it's um it's not a new topic at all computer science has been around for a while but it's another hour ago there's not a lot of people who are actually doing it in the schools and that's because right now Iowa doesn't really have a system of getting more computer science into the schools in all of the schools as well you know you think of libraries museums Girl Scouts Boy Scouts there's all sorts of organic organizations taking this on to and I think co.org is a really great job of getting those people who are first hearing about computer science and connecting so how to get that going so instead of us trying to create that what we've done is really latching on to the latching onto code.org and really promoting that as strongly as we can across the state as a means to get that going and from there they can take it and run with it and make it what what they want because I can set at this point there's not really a system in place that says kind of what that's going to look like there is however why sure there was some state legislation that was turned down Oliver I believe there is more calm than pipe we could say that is focused on computer science that we can hope to see past this year's well I don't know too many details on that but I think in the coming month I might have more information so apparent just say that all i'm following that you can always reach out to me as well and i can share it with ok and then um it's good to hear what you guys are doing you know at a state level but what are some of the things that people can find locally if they you know are reaching out to try and find some support within their town or city you know where they can look to that i would say i would point you to we have six regional send managers across the state and those you know we broke iowa up into six pieces of the pie and in each of those regions there's what we call regional sim manager that's house that either one of the regent universities or at a community college and that person is the one that's really charged with making sure that that educator whether they're in for out of school is connected with you know those those opportunities that they're interested in so at the state level me being just the voice of stem and i can tell you off the top of my head you know oh there is you know this organization and mists you know southern part of iowa that's really good that would be something that our managers would know and they're really good about connecting those pieces for us so if you have an interest in learning more about who your regional manager is you go to iowa stem gov / regions i'll put this in the now perfect and they can find their regional manager based on what city they are located in awesome okay great and then my last question I'm not seeing anything coming in let me check Twitter one more time but um do you know I know that a big concern for a lot of people when they're talking about getting started with coding and especially dating it beyond you know the hour of code is cost and there's a lot of free things that are available but you know for people who know they want to do a full k25 roll out or that you know k to 12 even and cost can be a major concern for them what are some ways that they can go about finding financial resources and what are some that exists just to give people an idea of what's available for them well I can think of two things off the top of my head the first one up is pretty easy and that's better what I mentioned earlier if you're wanting to continue pursuing computer science down the road beyond you know just the neck in the next two weeks we have those computer science training so again you want to make sure you get your a bit register and what happens is we put you on a list will send you information about all these trainings that were planning on having in the spring and summer and those trainings are naturally pretty already which is great however you know to get out of the classroom is actually go to these trainings there's travel that you have to live take on and there's also the faculty of the paper substitute teacher to take over the classroom while you're gone and what's nice to us again through google and verizon were able to help supplement those additional costs beyond the actual training to actually get you there on to participate the second thing too is what what the same counsel really wants to do is help bring communities together we want businesses and educators to connect because that's what's ultimately going to help feed the future pipeline talent pipeline of iowa and that community is going to look different across the state there are different sort of industries in each of these little communities so maybe you have a business in your city that is really reliant on technology or really reliant on computer science take this idea to them say we want to get you know co double in our classroom where we want to get um you know some other known a computer science software to teach our students these ins and outs of it um you know reach out to them bring them the cost pitch it to them there's businesses are more eager to get involved with the schools and I think most of us really imagine and that's one of the things that we've seen through the stem council because we are so involved not only with education but also with economic development I think if you just reach out to the local community aspect and tap into that you're really going to see some things at them awesome okay well thank you so much for joining us um I I'm not saying anything but I can I share people with people who have questions I maybe at the end or throughout can I share your contact information with them oh yeah of course please go ahead perfect i will post that on the YouTube page and on the event page in facebook as well so that they have that all right thank you so much have a great evening and a happy thanksgiving for Prince Gretchen all right bye bye okay everybody um so that was angel and it sounds like um there's a lot of great things out there for everybody um you know who's interested in going beyond an hour of code but also getting started you know we've got a lot of really cool opportunities in Iowa and to be honest with you all that you know there's things that are offered in Iowa that I haven't seen in many other states and so you guys are very fortunate i'm really excited to be partnering with the governor's office and with iowa stem and with code iowa it's really exciting to see you know then making a change in their state so um that's really great we're going to go ahead and jump into what the hour of code is why it's important um and and go from there so the hour of code is an event that started about three years ago through a partnership between cobourg and computer science education week and these two groups got together they wanted to take an opportunity to provoke computer science to every person especially students so that they can see what it can do to just try one hour one hour of coding um and so that naturally with the name came about the hour of code um the week changes every year but it's usually the first week of December and that's computer science education week and so it's a really big movement to get kids just excited about computer science to get your communities excited about computer science to get your colleagues and your administrators excited about what can come of showing kids you know maybe not expecting every child to become a programmer but just showing them the opportunities that are available for learning how to code and what kind of things can open up to them if they do decide to pursue learning to code and so you know it's a really fun week it's my favorite week of the year it's the biggest holiday for me so um it's just very exciting there's such a great sense of community that comes out of it just everybody sharing about it and everyone's talking and there's a real buzz in the school that you don't wrote that you don't always feel you know it's easy to get caught up in the procedures and and the daytoday grind but you know it's just a really fun way to learn new things learn problem solving in an interesting way that we don't do every year so every day um so that's that's a little bit about you know the hour of code and why it's important um you know obviously learning to code is a very important thing for our future information and for our kids there's going to be two hundred or there's going to be two million open computer science jobs in by 2020 and so having kids be prepared to you know go into the workforce with a little bit of an understanding of computer science if not you know fluent in a programming language gives them a huge opportunity when they give into a workforce and when they go and beyond and so doing everything that we can to prepare them for that is crucial so we'll go ahead and jump into what to expect with the hour of code and and how you can get started we're going to focus mostly on co double and how to get started with code but do cool shirt mention of it is just a phenomenal partner we've been partnering with them for three years along with a lot of other companies and they provide tons and tons of tutorials for free french caters to get started this year we have 19 that we have promoted through code org and I know that there's no hundreds of others that are available and so if you go to code org slash learn um you can find a lot of great resources available to our code website as well there's a lot of great stuff to view into you know sort of figure out what you think is best for your students and what you want to work on or take a look at what's available i may keep going um perspective but i know we do a lot of work we've been start we started know about in august getting our tutorials prepared so that it would be as easy as possible for people who just find us on you know that site and can it go through you know every step of the way we hold their hand and then make sure that they're ready for the big event during the hour of code and so you'll find that a lot of the tutorial partners are very eager to help very willing to it you know guide you if you do have questions but the tutorials are really helpful and knowing exactly what you can do with your students I know this year code.org is excited to be promoting more lesson plans we've provided lesson plans just about every year that we've participated but I know a lot of others are providing lesson plans as well um so let's go ahead and dive in and i'll be sure to you no answer any questions that come up so if you do have questions there's a chat window on the side of the the youtube chick page where this is streaming and you can also comment or you can tweet at me and again our twitter handle is at go to bowl and so you can always tweet at co dab'll and i'll be sure to answer your questions so if no one has questions right now then I'll keep going alright so um you can find all of the quotable hour of code resources at co double com / our dash of dash code and i'll go ahead and show you what we've got available there see here from working really hard at getting this up and ready for you guys so um excited for you to see it okay so you can see here um this is our hour of code site we've got a lot of great resources here if you want to go to our lesson plans we've got over 19 lesson plans our curriculum director working tirelessly assembling all of these for you guys she was an elementary school teacher for many years and he's been working with us for the past year and just completely revamped our curriculum but if she's thrilled to be able to offer you guys some hour of code specific tutorials um so if you click on any of these you can see we've got four categories we've got beginner programming advanced programming robotics and then what I'm most excited about this year is ela and programming we know that you know for a big big challenge is finding time in the day for computer science and how can you fit it into your schedule and there's already so many things we need to teach how in the world am I going to teach something new um well the way to you know sort of fitted in is integrating it with what you're already teaching and so we put together an ela lesson plan and then you can see the standards that are taught with each of these lessons on you know on these icons a lesson plan that covers a standard for each grade level in writing and also helps teach some programming so let's go ahead and take a look at the kindergarten one the way that our lessons are structured is um it follows a typical lesson lesson structure or a lesson cycle we do a few minutes of direct instruction where we you know open up and talk start a discussion with students about what is computer science and why is this important and put it in terms that they can understand and relate it to their world and it's this is all completely scripted you can see here and then we introduce the new material we talk about you know what we're going to be doing here why why it's important and how we can work together and in this example they're going to be doing sentence puzzles so putting together a sentence and learning the structure of a sentence and how that relates to sequence which is an important concept in programming it's really the first and most fundamental concept that we teach to students especially for kindergarteners you know we start putting things in order a computer is a machine that reads things in a very specific order it will only read things in the order that we tell it to and so that is why putting things in the correct order is the most important thing to learn in the most foundational concepts for students or when we're getting started with computer science um and with programming and so that's what we go over in this lesson in obviously there's some clear tie into ela and so three or four kilo directors and a fantastic job in putting together these lesson plans so that you can do know some writing with your kids while you're doing some programming and then after doing the independent or the the direct instruction you can move into some guided practice where everybody works together so using a sentence puzzle follow their own graphic organizers and hens they'll be able to copy a sentence puzzle and fill it out and they do that together and then independent practice you can do a little bit of programming together um and so each lesson you know finishes with a closing exit ticket eh and everybody really understands you know what we learned here today what is sequence what are sentences and how are they structured and going on from there and each of these ela lesson plans is actually set up to be appropriate for I'm sorry to be appropriate for each grade level so in fifth grade you know rather than doing sentence puzzles um you know they're writing a short story doing a little bit of creative writing and working together on that so um and that's just our ela lesson plans we have robotics which features Dash and dot of wonder workshop um some advanced so you can start learning some JavaScript and objectoriented programming with your upper elementary students doing conditions and advanced sequencing with your kindergartners so these are some of our advanced lesson plans and they all follow that same structure of you know direct instruction independent practice and some direct instruction guided practice and an independent practice with the the final section of independent practice being done in Kota belong screen everything else has done offscreen together as a class so that really helps give kids a tangible example of what you're going to be learning why it's important and relating it to their real world into their daytoday which is crucial when you're talking about such abstract technology technological concepts and so once you complete you know the first two sections of these lessons where you know you make sure you introduce it vocabulary to do the direct instruction you do a guided practice activity together I'm in this one you know it's a dance party where you put together a loop to music you know say the chicken dance you know you're in a repeat portions which would be programming concept called a loop and then you can um once you've done those four sections you can jump into independent practice oh you know for five to ten fifteen minutes where the kids are coding together or independently on their devices so it's really a holistic approach to teaching CS making sure that we're taking things you know slowly and offscreen in learning in in a lot of different ways for every type of learner and then coming together at the end and bringing out the technology and really putting our new concept into practice um so you can find all of these lesson plans like I said on our hour of code landing page down here at the bottom I'll go ahead and put the link in the chat window for you and that's where you can go to find all of those um does anybody have any questions on anything that I've covered so far just check my locations for questions doesn't look like yet um ok so let us go ahead and continue um so once you have your lesson plan and and you've decided what you want to do there's a couple of things you're going to need to set up for your kids to get started you know you do the lesson and then you want them to be able to you know as quickly as possible or as seamlessly as possible with a class full of you know 2011 tree school students to jump into other independent practice portion and so where you're going to have them go is this this section right here students get started play now that's going to take them to game notable calm / hour of code if you have a coda Bowl class setup and you want to use that you can click play with a class source student code if you don't have a code will account a quotable teacher account or class setup just click play without saving and that will let them create a session right here just for the hour of code without having to set it up ahead of time and then they're often running straight into horrible and they can get going and learning you know right just by hitting play I'll take them to the first lesson humble in size get to meet me so you can see it's really fresh once they've been taught about hospice concept of sequence which is boiler in here I can jump in and start doing some coding on their own and use my little mill around the room if your parent is they are in volunteering no that's always helpful to listen to start solving puzzles and there are some awesome sobbing and learning about sequence I'm dragging and dropping arrows and putting them into the correct sequence if you're going to be doing a word fast concept then you're probably an experienced co double user and so I would suggest signing in with your class code we I'll show you how to do that real quickly but first if you want them to be able to come back later just copy this student code and they can login with this another day if you want to use your class code do an advanced lesson do your class code came back co double common and play with class code i'm going to enter my class code then the students will be able to select their name from this list from the roster that i've imported ahead of time you choose my name and then depending on what lesson they're doing you will have them go to the to the corresponding levels incredible so let's say we wanted to do let's say we wanted to do conditions with our students which is the first grade advanced concept I would have them log in and go to the section on condition that corresponds with what's on the list early and you can see the corresponding levels you can see the corresponding levels here so we're going to do L loops sorry not conditions it's loops so you're going to do loopy lessons 3.12 3.5 and you'll be able to find that in the game and they'll be able to login I know so with your lessons there you go one through five that's the ones that they're going to be doing and this will take them between 10 to 15 minutes to do all of our lessons are about about 50 minutes long which seems to be in a standard for what you know the time that most people have set aside for this so that's how to get started with countable and use co double for the hour of code um but I want to go ahead and jump into you know what to expect the day of um and and you know how you can kind of build excitement around around the hour of code stop so there's some things that you can do to really build excitement on the day of and to know what to expect if this is your first hour of code a lot of people you know have been doing it for a few years but if it's your first time um there's plenty of people around you whether it's on social media or you know angel or you know the local stem a representative who can help you I kind of get started there's a lot of people you can reach out to for advice but I'll just quickly run through some of the things that I see and you know talk about what to expect on the day of um so there's uh there's always the expectation that things need to go perfectly and as an elementary school teacher you know that that things are always going to come up with there's always going to be some transitions and some learning opportunities for every lesson and so the hour of code is no different just because it's different material doesn't mean that you know your lesson needs to be any different um so what you do what to expect is you know to just know that developers do their best to make their sites run effectively and efficiently but you know there's going to be times where it doesn't work or the servers are overloaded and just have a screen free option as a backup I know that that may seem counterintuitive to learning to cook but with elementary school kids it's actually the best way to get started and so that's why all of our lessons can be completed offline the group practice is a big part of learning and is all done offline and unplugged so using any of our lesson plans you'll have a screen free option available if for some reason um you know a sites not working um the other thing to expect is used lots of excitement and joy and learning we have a lot of great student resources um you know to show your kids some videos of other kids talking about why it's fun to learn to code and why it's important and what's some things that they've learned and I'll share that with you in the resources section at the end of the at the end of the webinar but there's also some great resources available through code org they've got some great videos so celebrities talking about why it's important to learn to code to kind of build back type before you get into the lesson and so um I would say to do some of that and then also expect a lot of interest from parents and other teachers don't be afraid to invite others to come into your classroom and just sit and watch inevitably they're going to jump in and they're going to want to be involved and you're going to get their hands dirty with you so you always have a network of people who fall back on if things aren't going exactly that you planned um and then the other thing is to expect to have a lot of questions from kids about things and you know don't use use your normal teaching strategies for answering those questions asked 3 than need you know ask your partner think pair share doing some things to help take the pressure off of you to have all of the answers and work together to problemsolve that's one of the beautiful things about learning to code is it's such a great way to reach out to others and use a community to learn things um and really foster that culture within your classroom so so those are some things to expect I'll go ahead and quickly walk you through how you can get started and get rolling for after the hour of code and the best way to do that is to create a quotable teacher account so that you can log in with a class code and you can have your students saving their progress easily and seamlessly and locking in but you know with the full roster ahead of time so we'll i'll quickly walk you through that and um yeah so but if anybody has any questions feel free to send them my way I'm listening okay so go ahead and share my screen okay now from the hour of code site for more hour of code page you can um get started select teacher you're going to put in your contact information I'm going to be a teaching and it's just going to walk you through you know what we were talking about about how our lessons are structured and you know how you can teach with koda bowl and how r curriculum is set up this is a quick you know tutorial about and direct instruction group practice independent practice walking you through using sequence as the example i'll go ahead and log into my account so you can see what it looks like once you're through all of this um so once you're in here you can see there's videos explaining each concept and then there's you've got a classes and students page and you can actually track your students progress so I'm going to go ahead and show you how to add a class um you just need to set up your class names i'm going to need my room 5g across code you can frisk me anything i suggest it being something that is easier for students to remember like your school mascot or your school street name or their classroom or your last name and something that they're going to be able to easily remember i'm going to just generate one you can also have two one generated for you you can change this at any time if you'd like for time i'm going to go ahead and generate it and then you just add your students so fat you can also copy and paste these up from a spreadsheet if he's like all right so it's already um I'm going to go to my class and I can see all my students um so that's how you go ahead and get your students imported but the real place to go is our courage one page and this is where you're going to find all the lesson plans for getting started with koda bowl and going beyond just the hour of code you know if you're just getting started teaching computer science the hour of code is a great way to do that and our lesson plans make it super simple to get started but I welcome you to explore this over the holiday break and kind of get a feel for some of the things that we offer to go beyond an hour of code we really really make it easy to offer a k25 scaffolded curriculum um to your students into your to your entire school if the hour of code is a success and if you really enjoy it and say how can I get more of this we offer a lot of these lesson plans for free you can try each and every one of our concepts with your students so you can see you know objectoriented programming with your upper elementary and you can get into some sequencing and conditions with your kindergarteners and first graders I'll show you one of those just say in an idea of what it looks like you can see it looks really similar to our hour of code lesson plans completely scripted guided practice independent practice um you know really getting the kids thinking offline and online and then each of these units offers an overview and explanation of the concepts so if you're thinking how am I going to teach about computer science if I don't know what it is um three has done a fantastic job of breaking it down each concept so that you can jump in feeling prepared I'm explaining what this concept is how it relates programming in a short quick video and then also with examples down below them so you can never you know you never have to feel like you don't know what you're teaching each each of these is is really easy to get through and so that is what I would suggest doing if you decide you want to go beyond an hour of code go ahead and get started set up your class you don't have to use it for the hour of code but you know it will be helpful for getting students signed in if you decide to UM and let me just check and see if we've got any questions let's see here doesn't look like we've got any questions so that is it um if anybody has any questions you can always reach out to me Gretchen at quotable com write my name and chat where you can reach out to Angel she's super helpful she's you know a great resource and she'll be able to point you in the right direction for how to get help locally in Iowa and I really am excited for you guys to get started with the our code if you have you know um some exciting stories during that week feel free to tweet them at us or share them with us we love hearing from teachers especially that week um so yeah alright everybody thank you so much and have a happy Thanksgiving
