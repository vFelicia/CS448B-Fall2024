so to kick off this training we'll start by talking about k2 coding standards which standards exist where to find them um which ones we recommend and more and the reason we'll start here is because this is a big question we hear from a lot of teachers questions like what should i be teaching i want to teach coding in my early elementary classroom but what should i actually be covering what are my students capable of of learning what is developmentally appropriate for my age group my grade band and this big one like where do i start so we'll cover some k2 coding standards today that hopefully will help guide you on your journey um so to start computer science is a super interesting field i'm sure you know this if you're attending this webinar but it's it's relatively very new to elementary grades and i find that it can be tricky to teach and plan uh for this because many teachers approach computer science expecting it to be measurable and trackable in a similar way to other subjects they might teach like math or english and a big difference here is that there is not one nationally recognized set of computer science standards um out there so there's really no one right or wrong way to teach it and this can be like a blessing and a curse right no national standards or worldwide standards means potentially more freedom and flexibility for teachers but it can also translate into a lack of guidance or a lack of structure so i think it is helpful and important to have some guiding learning outcomes that when you ask yourself the question what should my k2 students really be learning in early elementary coding it's it's sort of these three things i've synthesized them from a bunch of different learning standards out there so the expectation would be that students will be able to understand coding concepts as they relate to their own lives so we might not expect our kindergartner to be able to perfectly define what a function is in code but they probably will be able to identify something similar to a function in their everyday life so they'll develop an understanding of the concepts they might not be able to define them exactly but they'll understand them in a theoretical way the second would be to develop a relationship their own relationship with technology your students are coming into a coding class with a vast array of past experiences with technology and there's not going to be one way that they interact with it so our expectation is that students will be able to develop their own relationship to technology to understand how to use it safely for them and finally we expect students to be able to grow their programming mindsets and habits basically foster computational thinking skills and uh i bring up these three main themes because i don't want you to get bogged down in the exact standards that your curriculum aligns with and these three learning outcomes are kind of the most important most agreed upon among coding organizations so as long as you're focused on these you're going to do great that said there are some standards that are more widely used for alignment and if your school or just you as a teacher wishes to have a strong emphasis on specific learning outcomes and standards i'll highlight some main ones now and hopefully that will be useful for you so in brief you guys know why standards matter but i really appreciate them because i feel like they are a good way to articulate what students should know before moving on to the next step of their learning so it's kind of that way to have some sort of a common vocabulary about what kids are learning be able to communicate them with fellow peers or parents or caregivers just kind of have that that background when you're talking about the learning outcomes so here i've just mentioned why standards matter at a high level they help set expectations of course they draw a line in the sand meaning that meaning that they establish kind of a baseline for what it means to master a subject and can be used to you know like i said communicate with other teachers and parents um in relation to that baseline and the most important one for me i feel like they facilitate greater collaboration and innovation you know if we have a bunch of teachers that agree on a set of computer science standards they might be able to develop learning materials or share resources that make it a lot easier for for the rest of us and here's a list of some standards that do exist for k2 coding and we'll touch briefly on each one and i did see that patty in the chat mentioned that um they're using digital literacy standards from the uk these are um the standards that i'll go over today are usa based but if you reach out to us directly i am more than happy to collaborate with you on your specific standards the big takeaway here is that whatever your standards are um there are coding tools out there that will align with them and we're happy to help you find that so first up we'll cover csta the computer science teachers association and uh usc csta describes themselves on their website as a dedicated team teacherled team i'm focused on creating a strong environment to support k12 educators so this ranges way past k2 all the way into 12th grade and these standards were released in 2017 with the purpose of delineating like the core learning objectives uh to basically provide a foundation for computer science curriculum again like i mentioned on the k12 level and here's a list of some of the concepts that they emphasize in their in their standards and they also highlight different practices which include softer skills like collaboration and communication so as you can see csta is really emphasizing that k2 students can grasp some of these coding concepts computer systems data and analysis the impacts of of computing excuse me so that's how you can see how they organize their standards second there's iste it stands for the international society for technology in education and from their website they mentioned that they provide competencies for learning teaching and leading in the digital age with a hope of providing um like a comprehensive roadmap for effective technology use for schools worldwide and their standards are really interesting they're aligned to the un sustainable development goals um which set out like a comprehensive global vision to address like worldwide challenges of our time so isti grounds their uh their standards in real world problems and experiences and you can see that echoed in the way that they organize their standards they they're really about the human um really learner focused so they talk about different skills that a learner can develop to become all of these different labels an empowered learner a digital citizen i'm an innovative designer so they really believe that in order for students to be able to thrive in a constantly evolving technological landscape that there are certain computer science skills that will help them get there awesome and moving on to codable of course i'm going to mention it because this is the app that i'm most familiar with but in 2017 codable had a group of computer science experts who knew a lot about csta and a lot about iste and common core come together to create a new set of computer science standards that are aligned with all of these other ones sort of a merging of them all since again there's no one single agreedupon set of standards so codable's mission in 2017 was to synthesize it all and highlight a mix of programming content knowledge plus social emotional learning and communication and other skills like that so i've listed um the different titles for the codable standards this is how we organize our learning outcomes and you can see that it's sort of a mix of csta and iste really highlighting computational thinking and programming concepts while also emphasizing you know pro the impact of programming and what it means for the learner and finally i do want to touch on the common core again this is usabased um but i wanted to bring up these standards because they are so well known and there's not a computer science section of the standards yet uh so i hear from teachers sometimes that they are required to meet certain common core standards and that's the reason they give for why they don't want to or can't introduce computer science into their classroom because there's not a lot of time to teach towards the common core while also teaching like an extra or supplementary subject and while they do not have a computer science section of the common core there is a ton of overlap between common core math and english and different computer science concepts so for example the common core standards for math uh i believe for first grade and kindergarten there's a couple that touch on number sequence and that can be really easily connected to the coding concept of sequence like why sequence is important on a broader scale so coding in subjects like math and literacy they definitely complement each other and my recommendation would be to take you know five minutes to review the codable standards or csta and five minutes to look at the standards that you are required to follow for your educational setting and whether that be common core or something else set from your district look for areas of overlap when you're teaching computer science know that you are contributing to the development of knowledge that students will definitely find useful in other areas of school and life so as we wrap up this section of the webinar about standards i just have a couple few final considerations for you to keep in mind things that you likely already know but that's a good review when thinking specifically about computer science first standards are not one size fits all and we absolutely need to consider our students with different learning needs standards are good as a guide but it's why i would recommend not just focusing on one set of standards and making sure all of your lessons and all of your projects align with it perfectly it's going to evolve and change based on the individual needs of your students second you and your students are not failures if they or you don't meet certain standards i mean there are so many social emotional critical thinking skills that students are developing while coding that may be trickier to capture in the standards so just keep that in mind if you're hitting those three points that i mentioned before about like understanding a foundational baseline of computational thinking then you're doing great third computer science learning is still extremely new for elementary students in comparison to other subjects and the standards will evolve so we don't want to pigeonhole ourselves creating curriculum that perfectly aligns with csta as it exists today because it will change and evolve i mean technology as we know is changing and evolving so rapidly so just keep that in mind and finally the standards are not telling you what to do you can use your rich knowledge of education and best practices and what your unique students need to determine what evaluation tools to use you really get to decide what success looks like in your compsci classroom and that's a wonderful freedom
