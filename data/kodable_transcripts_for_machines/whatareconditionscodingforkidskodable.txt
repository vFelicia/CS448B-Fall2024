let's go think about a day at school or at home you probably have some rules to follow right when you're at school you likely have a set of classroom rules like where you can put your belongings how to line up to go to lunch or when you can leave the classroom at home maybe it's a rule that you have to take your shoes off when you come inside or you're only allowed to use electronics at a certain time computers follow rules too a computer program runs based on rules written in code by a programmer it will follow the rules or instructions in the program exactly as they are written a conditional statement is an ifthen statement that allows the computer program to change its path and do something different if something is true then something else will happen using a condition in your code tells the computer to make an exception to a rule so a good example of this is a password as a rule a computer will not let you log in without the correct password it's designed this way for security but an exception to this rule can be made if you enter the correct password then you can enter conditions like this are all around you let's say a rule in your house is that on a school day you can only use electronics for a certain amount of time but what if your school building is closed and you have to do class online then an exception to this rule must be made if school is online then you can spend more time on electronics encode Abul who use colors to represent conditions they can be all different colors we know our fuzz is going to roll in the direction we tell it to so if we say go right then it will move right until it hits a wall if we want our fuzz to turn we can say if purple then turn down the arrow command goes on top of the condition tile so if purple then turn down after that we can complete the maze notice how the fuzz changes directions now it's your turn practice using conditional statements to change your fuzzies path in your program watch how the fuzz changes direction when you tell it to with your colored conditioned tiles
