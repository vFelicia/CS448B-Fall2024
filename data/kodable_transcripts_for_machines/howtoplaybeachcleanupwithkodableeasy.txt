have you ever followed instructions to build a Lego set or helped your parents bake cupcakes if you have then you know that you have to follow steps exactly as they are written from start to finish if you don't follow instructions exactly things might not turn out the way you planned in other words order matters a computer reads code the same way that you would read a recipe from the first line to the last one in programming this order of instructions that are to be followed exactly as they are written is called sequence whether you are new to coding or you are an expert with a career in programming sequence is key a computer can only do exactly what a programmer tells it to if the order of instructions or sequence given to a computer is wrong the program will not run correctly in code Abul your Fuzz acts just like a computer whatever commands you choose to put in your program your Fuzz will follow them exactly from the first command to the last one here is an example in codable to get through this maze we want our Fuzz to move right up right down and right drag these commands into your program in the same sequence remember your fuss will only change directions if you tell it to let's try it out once a computer has given commands in the correct sequence you can add something else to your code that will change the way your fuzz moves conditional statements a conditional statement is an ifthen statement that tells your program to run a part of your code only if a certain condition is met if a condition is true then something will happen this may sound a bit complicated but you actually use conditional statements every day think about a typical school day things happen in an ordered sequence first you wake up in the morning then you get ready for school you arrive at school you go to class you go to recess and so forth let's say as a general rule your school always has recess outside but what if it's raining then an exception to this rule must be made if it is raining then you will stay inside but if it is not raining then the condition is false and we will go outside based on the rainy condition your day will look different another common example of conditional statements and action are passwords think about how a password works say you want to log into your account and you need to choose a picture password if you select the correct password then you can log into your account the condition here is that your password is correct if this condition is not met and your password is incorrect then you will not be able to log in in this activity you can code your Fuzz to change directions if a certain condition is true this is important because it means you can make your program smarter and collect more pieces of trash some animals will only be able to be rescued with the help of conditional statements let's see what additional statement looks like in codable and work through a level together start by drawing the path that will allow the fuzz to collect all the trash here we want our fuzz to move right up right down up right down right but we're missing something we need to place a condition tile here to tell our fuzz if pink then move down without this condition tile our fuzz would keep moving straight and not know to turn down let's see it in action drag the commands into your program to tell your fuzz to move right up right now when our fuzz reaches our pink tile we want it to move down not continue moving right if pink then down so let's code it if pink then down after putting the rest of our commands in the correct sequence we can test our program remember you may need to place a conditional tile if you want your fuzz to change directions happy coding now it's your turn create your maze code your program test it out
