hey this is Gretchen today we're going to cover sequence one of the building blocks of programming I'm gonna start and Smee Borg lesson one two three role sequences like order of events you have to be really specific when you're giving instructions in programming in codable the blue guy his name is fuzz he represents the computer computers are basically really really dumb pieces of hardware and they need instructions in order to do anything the symbols represent programming commands we use these to give your fuzz instructions once we drag and drop them into the bins they represent your code and we're going to drag and drop the commands in order to get them to the end of the maze first we're going to go forward then we're going to go down and then we're going to go right this teaches kids how specific you need to be when you're programming that's it thanks
