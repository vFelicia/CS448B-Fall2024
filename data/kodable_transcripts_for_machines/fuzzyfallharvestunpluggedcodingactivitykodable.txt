let's go in this coding activity you will create a fuzzy fall harvest maze for blue fuzz this activity is unplugged which means you don't need a computer here's what you will need scissors blue drawing supplies and the fuzzy fall harvest worksheet you can find this linked in the description box below to download and print ready to go let's jump in have you ever been to a corn maze no not a candy corn maze a real maze made out of corn the goal is to get from the start of the maze through to the finish sometimes there are fun things to collect on your way like apples pumpkins or you guessed it corn the corn stalks that make up the walls of the maze might be double or triple your size so you can't see out they might have twists and turns and even dead ends so it can be tricky to find your way through here's what a giant one looks like from a bird's eye view can you imagine if you were right here it would be fun but also challenging to get out without getting lost this year the fuzz family has decided to head to the fuzztopia corn maze to give it a roll in case you haven't met them yet the fuzzies are round furry aliens who love adventure and trying new things but blue fuzz is feeling a little nervous on one hand he's so excited to have fun with his family and harvest some fall treats but on the other he doesn't want to get lost in the maze to make sure that he has a good time and stays safe there's something you can do to help first you get to design the corn maze you can make sure it's fun and challenging but also solvable and second you will give blue fuzz the exact sequence of instructions needed to get through the maze in other words you'll tell him where to go so there's no way to get lost here's how it works as a reminder you'll need your worksheet scissors glue and something to draw with step one draw a maze that connects start to finish step two cut out the corn pumpkin and apple from page two of your worksheet and glue them somewhere in your maze these are the treats that blue fuzz will harvest on his way to the finish line step three add decorations cut out the other items and glue them around your maze you can use your drawing supplies to spruce it up even more now it's time to solve the maze if you're working alone you can do this yourself or challenge a friend or family member solving the maze means figuring out the correct sequence of arrow commands that blue should follow to reach the end let's use this example maze that i created for blue to harvest the fall treats and reach the finish which way does blue need to roll right down left down right draw these direction arrows in the spaces below the maze right down left down right notice that if blue follows this sequence exactly he will roll right through the maze and join his family this is a sequence of instructions that results in a specific outcome in coding this is called an algorithm you can create an algorithm too now it's your turn help blue fuzz harvest the fall treats and get to the end of the corn maze all the instructions mentioned in this video are also on your fuzzy fall harvest worksheet so just print it out and get rolling
