hi this is Gretchen with kota bowl and i am so excited to walk you guys through some of the changes we've made to your teacher dashboard so from here you'll be able to get started with seeing each individual classes where they are in the curriculum just click on a class to select which one you want to view once you're on the class page you'll be able to see what is the current lesson that you should be teaching to your students based on the pacing for their grade so right now this class is on a k25 pacing but I want to change it because their second graders so I'm just going to click on View pacing and then from here I will be able to edit pacing for them based on where I think they should be once you have the correct lesson you can go ahead and scroll down and start viewing each section of the lesson plan from direct instruction to the guided practice activity that you'll be with your students and then also we can check for understanding and make sure that they really understand the concept you taught after that you'll be able to assign malpractice levels to your students so you can assign it to all of your second grade classes or to the current class that you're on just click current class and then those practice levels are assigned on their student devices and they won't go be able to go beyond them so they're automatically stopped exactly where you want them to be and according to the lesson that you should be teaching them once the levels have been assigned quotable automatically music is the next lesson as well as seeing the next lesson you'll be able to manage your classroom this page we also be able to go to see their progress on the computer science standard so you click on class progress and you'll be able to see what your students have been practicing for each concept what standards are in progress mastered or in need of review and this section is going to be getting a lot of updates over the coming months so stay tuned for more awesome things coming from credible thanks so much happy coding device
