when we started rolling out the kinder code program using codable that it was okay well we're just gonna do this one thing and that what we found was it opened up the doors to a lot of conversations we wouldn't have had the way I look at coding and programming is that's where our future is and that's where a lot of careers are headed and I think that it's our job as a teacher to expose them to lots of venues and to show them where their strengths are teachers kind of thought oh I can't code I don't know how to do that I'm not a programmer how am I going to teach my kids how to do that and when we were able to show them how accessible it was it would it became this moment of like oh that's all like I can do that you just go for it and then if you notice a way that you can improve your instruction then you improve it and I think students will surprise you with how easily they can retain the instruction and grasp the concept of the program I look at Cody and uncodable as learning the letters before you learn to read they're learning the basic steps and basic skills in coding then maybe if they take off with this then they have a future in coding themselves or programming there's the spirit of kind of wanting to explore and try that I think that as a district we didn't anticipate what's gonna happen and we've showed them strategies will trace it read the code and they're reading left to right just like they're learning to read in school and they're making the fuzzy you know trace the steps and they get to this part and like well what do you need to do from here and so they start to problemsolve them all in there we turned the term bug into one of our vocabulary words and they didn't just use it for coding they used it all throughout their day so they make a mistake on the math problem and they say oh I've made a bug and they'd erase it and fix it and so they're learning that that is part of the language that's used with coding they're putting it into their everyday language as well if you go into a class where Cody codable is is being used you really are seeing a group of kids who are like willing to try more frequently in other areas even when they're not using the technology because they have that classroom culture of well just try it again and it's okay and it's not a culture of failure it's a cultural of trying to be able to earn success you
