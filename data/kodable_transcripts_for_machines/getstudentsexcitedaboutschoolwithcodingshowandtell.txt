hello everyone welcome to codable showandtell my name is Hana basta and I'm the instructional coach here at codable the Show and Tell webinar series is a time for me to sit down with a teacher or a curriculum designer somebody using codable in their classroom and maybe they're using it in an interesting or different way or they're grappling with a common problem that other teachers might be facing as well and the goal of these talks is really for those of you who are watching to learn something new maybe it raises a question for you something you want to get answered but really just to get inspired by the awesome teachers who are using go to pool in their classrooms so today I am joined by Jaclyn laberge liger a Jacqueline thanks so much for joining us yeah Jaclyn is a rock star teacher using codable but I also just want to say that what she's doing in her classroom you're gonna hear all about it but it is something that those of you watching can definitely do in your classroom as well we have designed codable to be really accessible and Jacqueline's gonna tell you how she's using it and give you some tips and tricks so whatever she's talking about definitely feel free to give it a try and I'll have both of our contact information in the description box of this video so you can reach out to us if you have any questions but I'm gonna jump in to jacqueline asking you some questions and then this will just flow like a regular conversation so I'd love for you to first tell us a little bit about the school that you are teaching at kind of what your role is at that school tell us a little bit about the students and what you do okay so I teach at no Republican area schools which is a smaller school in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan I actually teach in every building I was hired to teach in high school I've traditionally been a high school teacher but when I first came here they went onetoone the year that I came here every student in the entire district all the way down to early kindergarten has iPads I started as a high school teacher and helping with the technology distribution in the one to one and as I was here a year or two we started to want more and more technology classes so right now I'm actually teaching tech to every elementary student as a special and then I also teach to tech classes in the middle school and then I teach three different hours in the high school but they involve a lot of different tech classes like sometimes I'm teaching a couple of different tech classes at the same time so we have a lot of technology available here at this school yeah and we're a smaller school you know we have about almost 50% free and reduced lunch we did apply for the codable for every one award this year and we've won it and we're super excited about that could you tell people really quick just what a quick snippet of what that was about yeah so portable does offer quotable for everyone is a little mini award grant kind of application that you can make with Cobalt if you need certain standards like our school did and you show all the amazing things you're doing with codable you can win a year's grant of the entire quotable program which is a very wonderful amazing program that we're very fortunate to have right now and that's what happened with us and now we have quotable in our entire district and I use it from ek all the way up to fifth grade and then sometimes my sixth graders to actually they really love it even or 68 does a little bit incredible to cool I use the entire curriculum in my elementary school what is that like to be teaching so many different grades because I know a lot of teachers that are watching this or ever eat out to me are teaching K through five what is that like for you what's challenging about it it's challenging because yes I am all over the place I'm in every building so I'm running a lot and obviously like from a record standpoint when I log into my power school which is where we keep all of our records I have a lot of classes but I love it because I feel like it's very well for one thing I get to I get to know everybody in the elementary school they're very excited about technology I'm superexcited that they're learning coding already because I also teach AP Computer Science in the high school and obviously coding is really important to me I'm a computer science minor so this way I know that all of our students that are coming up are getting some really amazing coding experience before they even get up to the middle school or the high school and then so from that standpoint I love it because I get to meet everybody gets to know everybody and I get to control the curriculum that's happening or have a you know saying all the curriculum it's happening all the way up until they come up into high school with me so well and so you just mentioned that you studied computer science and I talked to a lot of teachers who do not have any background in computer science so I'm curious if you could say a little bit to that what is it like teaching young children coding when you yourself have a computer science background yes so computer science it's a pretty rare degree to have an education because don't choose to go into the education field but that's why I work with code I'm also a facilitator for code.org which is an amazing program as well and that's the curriculum we use in our middle spooner high school to teach computer science and we try to teach teachers no matter what degree they have it doesn't matter that they can still teach coding even if they've not don't have computer science to be themselves from a standpoint of having a computer science degree I think it's awesome and amazing that I can go in and see all those elementary students learning some of the really crazy like functions and loops and ifthen decision structures even when they're as young as kindergarten yeah some of the kids are learning some of those concepts in such an amazing way I think I've said this before portable has an incredible way of making it all game oriented fun but really teaching perseverance and still getting in these concepts that you wouldn't think a kindergartner would be able to understand but yet with the moving of the maze and the way it's been taught it really does an amazing job of teaching so from a pure science standpoint I look at it and I think oh my god these kids are like doing functions but that doesn't mean either this coding program teaching coding is amazing no matter what I mean when I took a computer science degree obviously keep your science was in a much different language everything was different so it isn't like I feel like it's given me some sort of amazing advantage to teach it I feel like anybody could teach it I do feel very excited for the future though of these students because they're seeing some concepts and I believe sometimes by the time students get to high school understanding a function or understanding an if/then or a loop sometimes the perseverance isn't there or the logic just isn't there and they don't they feel like it's too late to learn it not that it's ever too late but I do love that these students will grow up with functions and events and loops and then they'll just be like yeah well so much of it is just that exposure at a young age that when they see it in you know JavaScript syntax later they're not afraid of it they know the basics what sorts of recommendations do you make to teachers who don't have that computer science background what kind of resources would you recommend for them or what would you say is just teaching that it's okay to be learning along with students I actually think that's such an amazing thing in any subject no matter what subject you're in no matter what you're teaching no matter what you do in education I think that when you build a community in your classroom a foundation where they know it's safe they know we're all learning together I think that if you're gonna do computer science and you don't have computer science degree you just need to let go and enjoy it and have fun learning it along with them because it is an incredible thing to learn and it is really good for many different things like I said including perseverance which is my favorite things that that students need to learn before they get out because we can Google everything you can persevere in anything if you have perseverance so I think from a teacher standpoint it's just a mindset it's a mindset of saying we're in this together you know I'm here to coach you it's okay if you found or discovered something that I haven't yet discovered I'm not here to make you think that I'm some authority on everything it's impossible to be an authority on everything in technology no matter who you are or what you're teaching or where you are that's an impossible feat so I think as a technology teacher who has been teaching technology for a while I know there was a point in my teaching career where I had to say you know what we are all in this together I'm not telling you we're all discovering together and any teacher with that mindset could be teaching really any level of code it could be in the elementary it could be in the middle school could be in the high school it could be at the college level as long as you're in it in that method that hey we're all discovering this together and we're all gonna succeed together so I'd say that's my number one thing is just that attitude that teachers need to have ya know that's so important because I also feel like if you're a new teacher and you're teaching coding which you don't know anything about maybe you're afraid just to admit that you don't have the answer but like you said building that class community where it's okay to take a risk and if you're wrong then you're learning it alongside your students which is great can you think of a time when you got stumped in class as a teacher or like when you didn't know the answer well I think from a computer stand computer science standpoint in the high school especially any time students are debugging a program and again this goes back to teaching technology for a long time if you've been teaching computer science computer programming at all quoting at all for a long time you know that there's times that students will have a bug in their program that you can't just walk up and look at it and instantly say oh this is what's wrong so I think from from like a debugging standpoint it happens all the computer science teachers you know you have to walk in there and go I can't pretend like I'm gonna know your answer immediately I mean obviously you've been working on this program for a long time here's all these lines of code you know there's a lot of things to do so I think that that happens all the time with debugging mmm I think that I'm very open to when a student is excited about something they've discovered even if it's something I do already know making it seem like they've discovered something maybe that we haven't had before because that's really rewarding to them you know for them to go out and go did you see that this is like it was excited because I just own this or I just learned this or I taught or something and actually codable because it's constantly changing codable does such an amazing job of keeping their curriculum uptodate and keeping the kids on their toes and introducing new things to them a lot of times students will find something in codable that we've not yet discovered as a class and especially the students who run with it and they'll come up and they'll go hey this is like or did you see this yet or you know look what I did and look what level I met in codable and I loved it I didn't see that yet and that's really amazing that you can do that where there's always in computer science you know five different ways to do the same thing or they'll come up and say you know I I did it this way it's different than what everybody else did and you're just like that close me away and that's awesome mmm and once you have that established that in your classroom I think it's good for students but it's also good for you it takes off this you know pressure that you have to feel like you're you know some sort of authority that has to have the answer to everything and that's impossible and it's not good for the students teacher I mean it's good for them to see you as a human being yeah it's too exhausting to have all the answers all the time that would not be very fun I'm so speaking to like that level of excitement that you're talking about in your classroom I always equate that a lot with motivation and like when the students are excited to learn more they're super motivated to keep going what have you done in your own classroom with codable to try to like spark that motivation and excitement or maybe it's a lesson that you built about coding to get kids motivated but how do you foster motivation one thing about coding in general is that I I do promote coding in every level of our building in every way I can you might even notice actually yeah boosters I have everywhere and I don't just put them in my classroom I put him out in the hallways and um you know I try to I do try to talk to students onetoone and group them with a group of students I'll try to talk to them about why coding is such a great thing right now and why would be a great thing for them to take interest in it in the elementary school honestly I don't feel like I've had to do a ton of motivation they are motivated and if I I feel like if I weren't introducing these things to them they would be finding them anyway I mean I think they go out and they find them and they get excited and then just being excited about what coding is about excites them too but you know we start in the beginning of the year well we start with a couple things we start with a video on growth mindset because I feel like and you know going back to the teacher to who thinks they can't teach computer science if you learn or study or even just google anything about growth mindset and just start believing in growth mindset or following it on Twitter where there's so many people who believe in growth mindset I think that establishing that is great because students get excited that they can try something that they know that if they don't get it right the first time it's not a wrong answer you're not gonna fail or we say you know like we watch this Khan Academy video the first day that you can learn anything failure is just another word for growing teaching that mentality gets them excited already yeah and then when they think you know what they go into codable and they think they're playing a game they are just instantly like this is so much fun I get to do this and then the fun part about it and and this is what I really love is I think that when they start and taking it's a game you know most kids will get bored with a game I think over time because there isn't much depth to the game or they'll go master it or whatever I think that when students actually discover that they're doing the coding part when they start to oh my god I really have to think in this game like I'm really thinking through this it actually gets them more excited because they're so excited to for those challenges to beat those challenges to get somewhere to accomplish something and then when they equate it to school and they're like this is like school like this is how it should feel it becomes very motivating on their own and you know I'm very into intrinsic motivation I think even in the high school too often students especially for some reason students who come from middle school always believe for some reason along the way that they're doing things in school for their teachers and teaching them that is not for their teachers it's for them you know you're doing this for your life to be better that intrinsic motivation all the way down to the elementary Accord well does such a great job of giving them that because they do they get through those challenges and it isn't just a game anymore yeah and they get it and then I think they come out and they really want more coding they want more technology too but they start to understand the difference between coding and technology which a lot of people in our country probably don't even understand the difference and they understand it and they want more of it I really want to understand this coding piece yeah and just like you were saying just to feel successful at school and we've talked a little bit about this and I'm sure you I'd love for you to share it with the viewers but like having some students that maybe aren't succeeding in other parts of school recognize that they are coding they are doing computer science and they are successful can you talk a little bit about that with what you've noticed the impact of coding on uncodable on yours to some of your students yes we talked about this once before because I said sometimes when I come into an elementary classroom especially you know there's a student that obviously either isn't that interested in his classroom work or you know whatever is happening in the classroom for some reason he's sitting right by the teacher's desk where she's sitting right by a teacher's desk where they're off to the side because they are you know maybe trouble focusing or whatever and a lot of times when they see they have control over something like that and they're able to you know succeed and like you said feel that success that intrinsic motivation and they realize I'm excited when they get through a level oftentimes those students really do better in coding then they may be traditionally are doing in some of the other subjects because they know they have control over it they know they have that ability to do what they want to do and move on and move forward especially in like codable is a good example of a program where you know if they're into it and they start moving they can move at their own rate and they can see hey I'm getting through this quickly and and I love it and I had one student in the ek this year who literally when I would walk in the door he would be waiting for me to open another level please tell me you've opened more levels I need more levels like that's how some students get and it's really rewarding and exciting because you know sometimes students who struggle with attention and who struggle in other subjects then sometimes also have behavior issues and I know I tend to be very optimistic in this way but I feel like when they have something that they're passionate about and when they have something that they know that they're good at it's gonna carry over into everything it's gonna carry over into those other subjects and it's gonna carry over into the classroom and they're gonna be like I have a purpose now when you give them that purpose and that passion I feel like it can really help them in all of their aspects yeah I love that and when we had first talked about this I was pretty blown away because I had almost the exact same experience when I used to teach middle school computer science where I had one student who I would talk to his other teachers and I was I could not believe that he was acting the way he was acting in these other classes because he would get to coding and just be so focused be working so hard and then wanting me to share with his parents every day like Miss Boston can you text them what I worked on today like I want you to share my progress with them so I mean I completely agree the power of coding I mean having something where students can really feel successful doing this this really tricky discipline at a young age like that's awesome and the behavioral transformation is really powerful I mean aren't you just excited yeah just traditionally aren't doing very well in other subjects then it's it's just an amazing power they have and then you can get them to see how high demand that job is if they want to you know follow that and pursue that degree I mean then you can really get them fired up yeah I agree so thinking about these students that maybe are struggling in other classes what sort of things might you do to try to help them like bring that growth coding mindset from the computer science classroom into their other classes like do you talk to other teachers or talk to the student what might you do yeah well the students themselves I feel like a lot of times and we said this before too because computer science can be so rewarding on an intrinsic level a lot of times they pick it up on their own like I feel like it isn't really something that I particularly try to find a student and say you should you know I I think when I approach it I try to think of every single student in the classroom as being able to be successful and so maybe from that perspective I wouldn't say that I intentionally go to a student but I definitely talk to the entire class and say I don't know what your past or what you guys are like in school but this is different this is not like anything else and you can be successful at this if you want to be and this is an excellent career to get into it you do any kind of research or googling on what we need for computer science people in this country right now you'll see very quickly that it's it's an amazing field to get into so I think I promoted a lot like I said before with the posters with the students I do try to get as many students as excited about it as I can in this district we all do the hour of code yeah yeah on that coding week every year I try to make it a really big deal i order the stickers i order the posters i try to promote it any way i can because we're one to one I've had district my tech director can send the you know the desktop just that goes right to the our code and sometimes even just that even just you know sticking a shortcut on an iPad desktop in our district students don't know what is this and they'll click it you know and then they'll go right into it and I think once they've done the hour of code they kind of start to get that feel like I get what this is I know what this is about and I love it most students really love it even without you pushing too hard yeah that's why going back to the thing with the teachers again I really think the teachers themselves should not be afraid of it I mean go out and try the hour of code it's fun it's exciting it's hard to believe that something like that is is what makes computers run but it is and it's so neat and interesting to see how computer runs versus just using them yeah you know totally yeah right now I codable we're excited to be we're planning for the hour of code and getting ready for it already it's not for a couple months but you can ever start planning too early because I agree it's such a great time and I've had some questions from teachers who have asked like is it too much for the first time we use codable to be for the hour of code is that gonna be too overwhelming like oh no you just jump in there and we've talked a little bit about this too that feeling of when you're trying to build your community of growth mindset in your classroom sometimes just jumping in and trying it is the best way to start so both the teacher and the student really and and that teacher having that attitude where they're showing the student that it's okay to jump in and start it's a great lesson in itself yeah I mean all of that I think everything that surrounds coding that way the ability to to be able to persevere or try again failure is not really failing because you try again until you get it right and that you know jumping into the unknown because it is all unknown it's unknown for everyone really I mean computer science is gonna constantly be changing and evolving in there like I said there is no one person who can be an expert in all of it yeah I agree and you had mentioned that you guys the the district is really interested in coding education and you have onetoone iPads can you tell us a little bit more about the district that you were teaching in and maybe people who are watching and if they're in a similar situation they'll learn a little bit more about about this district decided to go onetoone before I taught here actually I was at a district that was a little bit further away from where I live and it was a much larger district and they had not on onetoone yet and then when this district went onetoone their computer technology business teacher laughs and my children go here a student so I was super excited to consider this option and I really want it to be in one to one district so Dave yeah we're super excited about making sure that we got into technology as being a tool to improve what we can do in our district like I said we're almost 50 percent free and reduced lunch so students don't necessarily have technology in their hands everywhere they go at home we also don't necessarily have we have we're very rural geographically could you're familiar with the state of Michigan the U P is very distant like we are in Michigan but we're very hard from Detroit and so it's difficult to get internet around here and WiFi and things like that so taking a very proactive approach is what they did to get technology into the hands of every student which is what I wanted to be a part of and I'm super super excited that we do that we do a lot of adaptive learning here which I feel also is an amazing place going in educated like in education I don't know how we could survive without adaptive learning really I mean the fact that we can use technology to adapt to where a student needs to be so they can feel that success that goes back again to that you know feeling of not being a failure it shouldn't feel like failure you need to try something multiple times until you get it that should not be a negative thing that should be I'm gonna be a you know a person who first appears until I get it which is a stronger lesson anyway and so they're very they're very Pro technology very Pro adaptive learning we don't block social media here you might notice and we've said before and since you said you're sharing my contact information that might handles teach Knobloch because I'm a very big promoter of social media I think anybody who is anti social media has not seen it used in the more powerful way it can be used or hasn't been taught to use it correctly so we teach social media instead of blocking it in the hopes that we will create a generation of students who can really harness the power of social media there's a lot of amazing things that can be done with social media when it's used correctly totally yeah so they're very supportive of that too I feel very fortunate to be here where I get a lot of support in technology administration is very supportive and that's awesome what might you say to a teacher who is working at a school that wants to try codable but maybe doesn't have that type of support like potentially there's it's not onetoone maybe you students who have to be in pairs or threes what would you recommend for them I think person trees but still be exciting I really feel like students just get excited from you know all computer science but codable especially younger students just love everything about it and the students that I have even though they're onetoone they still want to be next to each other sharing what's happening with each other you know showing each other what they did helping each other so I think it's great no matter what kind of technology you have to be able to introduce it also most you know a lot of people have technology at home too like even if even if a parent had an iPhone or any kind of Bowl and that could put quotable is an app on it students can still use it and I've mentioned this before I've actually had students whose parents texted me at home because they wanted to get into their quota bowl at home because they were either home on Christmas Braden we had a snow day one time I got a text on a snow day or it's just students who just can't get enough of it during the day and their parents are texting me and saying my student is driving me crazy they want to be in their photo book all what do I need to do and so it is it's amazing and no matter what way you could use it I think it's it's going to make students excited and that's computer science in general I think that you know the way we teach it now and the opportunities and the resources we have out there and and almost all of it is free you know there's a lot of really good resources out there that people can start with and and try it and get exposed to it and and it doesn't matter if you're onetoone or not you think yeah I just have a couple more questions as we're wrapping up if your students take away one thing from their experience with codable what would you hope that that would be perseverance Tim I know I say it over and over again important yeah it is I think when a student understands that the control is in their hands it goes back to the intrinsic thing again that they're not doing school or someone else and that they're not powerless in school like there isn't there isn't someone telling you well you're good at this or you're not good and Dennis or this is where you belong or this is where you fit in I think that that lesson no matter how you get that through to students no matter what subject it's through or whether it's through coaching or sports that you have the control of being able to you know it's this power over your own life and your own self to say I can do this I can I can get angry and quit and say I hate it or I can persevere and say so what if I didn't get it right the first time I'm gonna try and get it until I get it right I think that's a really important but also just the excitement of coding and knowing how a computer works from the inside I think too is great and I think students when they start doing coding whether it's through quotable or any source of computer science they very quickly understand that they're learning not just to use a computer but actually how the computer works and I think a lot of them realized very quickly too that their parents don't really know much about how the computer works so they can come home and say did you know that you know this is how it works like I'm actually controlling like I'm not just playing a game right now I'm controlling this character I'm deciding where this character is going and when you play the game I can write code where I get to control what happen according to what you do I think when students get that you know that's a really exciting thing to that I hope they get out of any computer science yeah that's great I mean I think it also that speaks a lot to like the teacher communicating when the students are using codable communicating what is happening because like you said if they're playing it they're gonna be engaged they're gonna be motivated but they might not truly understand that they are coding this fuzz to move through this maze so the role of the teacher to really help them realize that they are coding they are not just moving of phones around right and I think does a really good job of that because when they get to the fuzz maker you almost can't not understand that you're coding then that's what I mean quotable have some really amazing creators there I don't know who's creating your content but I love how in in like in my mind like I said as a computer science person I can see that they've really found ways to get the kids to get coding in just a different way but things like that I think they start to get the concept of oh wait I'm controlling this according to what I do over here yeah and that is such an incredibly powerful thing to understand it really is and it's it's so great for them to see that I'll pass that along but love it thank you and then what's your one final recommendation if you were to try to boil it down to one recommendation for a new teacher interested in trying codable what would you say to them yeah I would say just jump in like we said dive in there's really nothing stopping you from diving in and trying it I mean even like we said even if you're pairing up like we love tired programming in co.org too we talked about Parrikar programming all the time it's a great thing for students to work together it's great thing for students to solve problems together I really can't think of a reason that you couldn't jump in and try and you know at least discover what's happening in it and if you're afraid of computer science or you're free to coding or you're free that you don't know what's happening when they're gonna jump in you know that's just an attitude in your mind where if your promote growth mindset you're promoting it but you're not thinking yes got a little yeah if you have growth mindset you know that as long as you're willing to try it as long as you're willing to persevere you can't really get it wrong you can't do it wrong there is no wrong way to teach a student how to get interested in any subject let alone coding and and like I said there's so many resources out there right now we have such a ginormous shortage of coders coming out that we we have a lot of resources that are out there available for us to use Jacqueline thank you so much for joining me it was it's always lovely to talk to you I want to say to everybody else watching if you're interested in learning more about what we've talked about in this video or have any questions um you can reach out to me my email is Hannah at codable comm and I will include Jacqueline's contact information Twitter and email as well and then don't forget to Like and subscribe to our codable Channel Jacqueline thank you so much for joining me it was so nice to talk to you that's so great thank you so much we'll talk again soon
