hello hey guys hey expression here and three and we are so excited so you talk about the hour of code yeah it's finally here our favorite time of year so every ever like to get together with you guys and go over some of the things about what to expect what to expect uh for the our code what it is why it's important how you can celebrate with your students and the activities we put together and this year we have more activities than we've ever had before thanks to Bree she worked really hard I'm putting together a lot a lot of chiller lesson plans for you guys so um we're just going to quickly go over what the outer coat is and why it's exciting and what to expect and then we'll dive into some of the activities that we've put together and how you can get set up with those and we'll go from there so if you do have any questions as we're going through things I feel free to put them in the chat on the YouTube page you can see it kind of a look on the righthand side I think some of the territories and hello some will be monitoring that you can also tweet us if you would prefer to use Twitter just use the hashtag kids can code or tweet at codable and we'll be sure to respond so without further ado I guess we'll go ahead and get started we will go over who we are for people who aren't familiar we have these pretty regularly so we never forget that there might be new people tuning in so my name is Gretchen Heavener I'm one of the founders of coda bowl I've been doing this and teaching kids to go for almost four years now so I feel like a veteran my third hour of code and it's my favorite event of the whole year it's just such a blast we spend the whole week talking with students and going to schools and and you know it's nice to get out of the office because we work really hard you know all day every day you know their heads down it's really fun to get out there and and you know talk to people oh it's my favorite time here and yeah I'm three I used to be a teacher I taught kindergarten first grade or fourth grade and now I your curriculum here so I work on resources for teachers writing lesson plans talking to teachers working with kids pretty much everything seem to make it easy for teachers and schools to use codable to teach computer science so yeah this is my second hour of code with codable and I'm excited so what you guys like though we have for you six I think I like it okay awesome so um I'll just quickly kind of go over what the art code is and why it's so important for getting to the lesson plans and I think it's important to note that you know we're not the only people participating in the hour of code it's a it's an I guess global movement started by yes a week and our code that org to promote computer science that you can chain to millions of kids I think it's over 200 million 250 million kids have already participated in the hour of code since they started it to cut to three years ago um and you know there's at this point I think probably over a hundred puts you know different tutorial partners and things that do it we've been partners with code.org since the very first hour of code and every year we grow what we offer and I'm sure that other people do too we always make it as easy as possible to get started because you know in the in the spirit of you know celebrating computer science education really good computer science is you know we want to make it accessible for people and that's really our mission at codable is to make computer science is accessible and easy as possible to get started teaching and so that's why we love the hour of code so much is because it's a celebration really of of all of that you know worldwide and it's a really great opportunity to introduce your students to you know what computer science is what it means to be a programmer what it means to be a computer scientist and to work with technology and now but it's also a really good opportunity to get others in your community involved I know a lot of educators use it as an opportunity to bring parents into the classroom to have a parent day where kids are coding with their parents and start showing off some of the things that they know how to do that really impresses their parents you know that they can code and figure things out and then it's also a really good opportunity to bring other people in the school who might be a little bit apprehensive about coding or I'm sure about it or you know they see the engagement or they're interested but they're really not sure where to start to just bring them in you know get them involved and show them you know how exciting it can be um the more than that it's a great opportunity for you to kind of explore what's out there in and see what your students enjoy and see what you enjoy and see how you can take this idea you know using computer science to broaden our students horizons and to teach things in a different way and kind of run the fad idea and so it's just a really exciting week and hopefully it goes beyond just just this week and follows through the end of the school year and into the spring then you know to next school year so that's our hope and that's sort of what we want to help you get prepared for now so I guess we will dive into the lessons yeah so just kind of walk with interesting you know for the hour of code our goal is to make this successful for everybody so this year we kind of decided to go with a few different categories of lessons um just to target different audiences so for some people this is in their first hour of code and you know they've already gone over the basics with their students so we thought about that as well on giving some more advanced concepts to kind of build off what you and your kids are you know if you're comfortable would you still have completely scripted lesson play for everything you do so um you know if that's something that you feel more comfortable with and everything you need is already written for you which is great if you feel more comfortable and want to branch out and kind of use that as a template to do your own thing that also works too so our categories this year we have beginner advanced concepts we partnered with whatever truck to do a featured lesson on robotics and we have my favorite is ela integration so for K through 5 we have some reading and writing Common Core standards that were having activities that teach basic computer science concepts and include ela in that so it's a great starter for teachers to see kind of beyond the art of code how can I kind of integrate computer science into what we're already doing because we definitely know what a challenges is for teachers to find time to teach programming as an isolated subject so we're trying to make it a little easier for teachers to see how to integrate it where you're already working yeah so let's go ahead and take a look at ya at some of those yeah and I posted the link in the chat window for you guys to the right of the YouTube video that I can post that on the event page as well after the rocket webinar so let me see this yes that's like so what you see here is our hour of code page so at the top of this point guy really fast that if you are just having your students kind of hop on and do the game and just get onscreen content without using lesson plans this is where you're going to click for the area of code you don't need to create an account and register you don't need to create an account and register you'll just click play now and your students will be able to play um that's pretty basic so I want sometimes I'm aware that but I will show our categories of lesson plans that we have here so like I was talking about we have beginner programming lessons on K through 5 and so depending on your grade level they'll select one of these lessons um we'll look at the catering example here so these beginner lesson plans all cover the foundation concept of sequence so that won't change depending on the grade level but the lesson plan does differ across grade levels and it includes different kind of math tions and as well as different vocabulary materials are a little different so in terms of level I would definitely go by grade level here and teach the appropriate grade level but know that that the programming concept across the board here it is sequence that is the focus here advanced program and why I do it should they start since it's a beginner why do we start with the stand current questions so yeah we we call this our beginner category on because depending on experience level so grade level here is a very important and ages in either I guess because when I started Larry about computer programming I ignored that sequence first two so beginner is referring to the foundation that anyone needs to begin to learn about computer science so if you were to discuss over this beginner concept the rest of the material wouldn't make sense so it is definitely important for all grade levels to start here with this foundation before being able at their elements and kind of build on their knowledge of programming tradition so given that you know some some people in our audience I'm sure did the error code before I would definitely suggest looking over this but he may find yourself looking for more advanced concepts if you're familiar already with programming if you've already done a little for memory for students and I had jar advanced programming lessons a jerk here and so our advanced lessons are also designed for specific grade levels but each grade level has a different focus so hair garden is doing sequence first grade is focusing on leaps secondgreatest focusing on functions then you need to third grade students are learning about variables and fourth and fifth grade then has much more advanced content that's actually includes JavaScript syntax so if you have not already I saved a beginner concepts like we were just saying because this later stuff will be a little too probable make much sense so you say every day with you your students do that later these lessons people who have a Google account have so if you have a code will account then it is material you may have already seen before in terms of the concepts so these concepts are all taught in our curriculum as normal so yeah if you have an account you may be a little familiar with them okay it could they bring me lessons they've already had yeah absolutely yeah the great thing during our could be these are free so it's definitely a great opportunity to take advantage of some higher level on free resources that are out there I know you know a lot of teachers that's always looking for that so yeah this is definitely a great week and these will be available and definitely awesome and then I'll jump down to our robotics lesson so this is just one lesson and you could use it K through fifth grade this is where we actually partnered with Wonder Workshop to incorporate one of their robots so a lot of our teachers who use code will ask us all the time time they can kind of work with robots or different things up they're using in their class we thought this would be a great example of kind of how to do that so if you do have robots or be BOTS or zero or any other kind of robotics tool that you use in your classroom this is a great starting point to see how you can kind of include programming concepts with your robots and obviously do this lesson during the week and then it I'm sure you'll get ideas for other ways you can incorporate programming concepts into robotics in your classroom beyond this week and then we have our ela category so each grade level focuses on a specific Common Core standard so all of our ela lessons are focusing on introductory programming concepts so that's sequence so kt5 ela we are learning about sequence through the lens of a specific common core standards so that's obviously different for each grade level but they you do need to include an reading and writing element and T really have any students examine ways that they already use sequence and then kind of how that relates to programming so I really like this category of lessons I think it's a great starting point to see kind of how do you can teach programming everyday in your classroom whether that's dedicated type of programming or not and go beyond my hour of code and really in computer science what you already do day to day awesome do you think you can quickly walk through one of the lesson plans just sitting again maybe another structure yeah absolutely let's take a look at our kindergarten la lesson so all of our lesson plans are structured this way our code and not artful curriculum structured this way on the lefthand side you'll always see kind of a little overview of the information week for the lessons so how about it we'll take what concept is being covered materials materials that you need will always be included here so if it's a graphic organizer if it's a an exit ticket if it's um I'm going to worksheets here in this case sentence puzzles that you'll cut up and have students put together when you click this blue download teaching materials everything will be there free and all you'll have to do is print it so across the board all of our lessons call for you know materials but you will never not have what you need and you can print what your the lesson plan here as well so the objectives for the lesson I are always listed at the top in this case there's Common Core alignment so we've highlighted that for you to what standards are being worked on and then the lesson has an opening direct instruction where you'll teach the concept guided practice in this case they'll be practicing with the sentence puzzles letter included and then independent practice so for the hour of code ela lessons structures a little different in that it that practice is not on screen you may find in other lessons that the practice is kind of allowed who use the onscreen lessons for students to practice but during the hour of code for ela we actually have been doing that as a closing activity so every lesson will have practice on screen it just may look a little different in the lessees cycle depending on the category for our core lessons and for the onscreen portion yak is on screen portion can we go over where to send them yes great question okay cool so for this this section here which is a closing exit ticket this is really start PLA lessons but every other lesson as well it's going to have levels in critical that relate to the lesson that you just taught so I'll just show you guys really quickly where to send your kids once you finish the lesson and they're ready to you know get started coding and get the devices out you're going to send them to this link here where it says play now that's gonna open game that global column / hour of code and they can either play without saving if you don't have a quota Bowl account you haven't set up a teacher account and you want them this is just kind of a onetime thing just for fun or if you're just getting your feet wet you can have your kids play without saving that will take them directly into the game and they just get going and for anything that's covering sequence sequence it's going to automatically take them to the relevant levels if you do have a class code and you do have a teacher account already set up you can also have them log in here with that they're just gonna click and play with class put your student code and into their class code as normal like they normally would and that's you know how you eat them started if you're going to be using the iPad or an Android device or your desktops the downloaded version on a Windows PC or a Mac it's going to look slightly different you're going to have to use a class code or a student code or create a new new profile for them on that device but I think that you all are probably familiar with how to do that because you've probably already downloaded codable ahead of time so I would suggest as walking you through that process on your own ahead ahead of the class so that you know you know how to get them signed on but it's all pretty simple just like this although I'm going to show you what it looks like to log in with a class code so that if this is something you're interested in doing you can see how easy it is for them to get signed in so my class code is famous class I just type that in and then I can select my name from the list of students Here I am and then I can automatically resume my progress from where I left off before so the great benefit of having a class code is that your students progress always saves and they can log in from any device just by using that class code and selecting their name so if I wanted to continue all I have to do is press play and it's gonna resume where I left off before so yeah that time could get your students logged in you can see it's really simple if you do have a class code you just kind of get them off and rolling haha anyway oh cool so I have one other thing I should mention is that this URL with your roster can also be saved on your class website if you want to so it's just game fat clinical column slash slash and then your class code and that's your unique URL so you don't want them to have to type in the class code every time you can just save this URL as students can just click on their name to get started so it's pretty simple to remember just game back google.com slash class and then your class code and it's also on your teacher dashboard you can find that as well so um that's really all you need to know as far as it getting set up and what we're offering as far as lesson plans feel free to look through all of these lesson plans that we had available so that you can kind of see you know what would fit best for your students so you can see what would fit best for your students you know your kids the best you know what level they're at and so you can decide you know what would fit their needs we have a question coming in and sure so if someone has an excess of classes like 30 classes for example is there an easy way to add all their students or you need to have separate classes that's a great question so if you want to import all of your students for the hour of code and you want to have the progress saved whatever they were doing for the hour of code I would suggest importing your classes using Google classroom if you don't have that set up you can log in with your Google account and then there's an option when you create a class to import your classes in bulk and that will actually give you the option to import all of your Google classroom classes if you don't have Google classroom setup you can still bulk import you just have to copy and paste your rosters from a spreadsheet so whenever you go to create a class in your teacher dashboard you'll actually see both the bulk import option and being able to set up all your classes in one swoop instead of having to do 30 separate classes that would take all day so you want to make it really simple for you so yes there is a way to do it pretty quickly and painlessly and that would be my suggestion you know you can set up class codes and everything there too so you can come up with you know a unique structure or how you want your class codes to work usually if something simple and easy to remember like the name of your school and the remember is really easy and that way they all have you know a memorable class code we can you can do a custom one by us no but it's just going to be a random set of numbers and letters so we don't usually write them in line any other questions okay cool so what so I think that the next thing that we should make me go over is kind of what to expect on the day of when we hell to be prepared for the inevitable Oh technical issues that may come up and I think you know you can expect a lot of excitement the kids are gonna be really pumped teachers that skim them you can because energy in the air everybody you know I mean you know how this when you do something different in the school day people are a little bit off then they're just like really thrilled to be doing something out of the norm so there's gonna be a ton of excitement just kind of go with the flow if you have something coming up a technical issue there's going to be a lot of people on every website so you know people are doing out globally I know I know we've done a lot to prepare for the amount of traffic that we're going to expect so you know we don't expect to have any issues but if you're using something else they may go down have an unplugged activity as a backup all of our lessons include an uncooked portion that group practice so you should be fine there if you're using any of our lesson plans but if you do have you know an on screen lesson plan for your students be sure to have an unfucked activity prepared as a backup if you're using iOS codable on iOS a downloaded version on your desktop or if you're using the Android version you won't have any problems accessing potable it can all be played offline so you should be fine there if you're using the web version I would test it out in in your classroom just to make sure that you don't have any firewalls or anything they're going to come up the day of you know just test it out the week before just to make sure that you hear commands can all access it um and yeah just be pumped and excited and ready to to share um you know some exciting experiences with your kids I think one other thing that is always fun to mention is the story of Grace Hopper who is actually the inspiration for CSM weakening our code she is an admiral in the US Navy and she was the person who invented the first compiler which is the part of the computer that converts by a coding language into binary so that the computer can read it and understand it and she was just an awesome really cool inspiring lady and her birthday is December 9th and so the error code is actually CSI week is actually inspired by her and meant to sort of celebrate her life and you know everything that she brought to the wrong with computer science and to help more kids learn about computer science by celebrating her life so it's kind of a fun story to share with your students we have a follows in codable named after her soccer and Gracie buzz and then you have an account America lesson but a journey equitable user there is a lesson on Grace Hopper Islam yeah that's exciting um which section is it the newest loops okay cool um yeah so if you're a Google user look for the lesson on loops about Grace Hopper if that's something that interests you um yeah and then the only other thing is if you are interested in having one of us talk to your students the week of the our code we are taking applications it's a crazy week for us and you know we have tight schedule but we are letting people apply through Wednesday to have us talk with your class so if that's something that you're interested in doing we'll post the link on the YouTube page so that you can you know just send us your information I'll get back to you after Wednesday about our availability so I think that's everything you think of something else know if any issues come up during you know this week or next is your preparing you can reach out to us at support we have a help desk we'll put the link that helped us it's probably going to be useful if you're setting up an account if you're just using this for the arrow put it on the couch many questions sort of GRE just giving an account and getting started well whoever our help desk link there that might answer some onboarding questions and yeah we're very available so yep you're all back we're so excited so we're all hands on deck that day and like Bri was saying if you are setting up a quotable account it is something we recommend if you're at all interested in going beyond just this week you know coding if they if you're thinking of taking it beyond you know this week and going in January and into this rain we definitely recommend having your account set up and answering your students you make that process really really simple so you know it takes probably less than five minutes to give it all set up I definitely recommend taking a look at that at least if it's something you're interested in so and again if you can always ask this week that question so if nobody else has any questions then I guess we'll go let you guys have your Monday evening we'll wait a minute or so and see if there's anything else but we're so excited so we do have one question coming in right um let's see does the online portion of the hour of code starting the same level for every crate what percentage of the Eriko should be online so the online portion differs depending on the grade level however for the beginner concepts is the singing levels for sequence so actually K through 3 I think it is just as the first part of sequence fourth and fifth does more so because they're older the moves you're less this more quickly so they in the last place it says to have them do ten levels versus five so you'll see that difference and then obviously for the advanced concepts they are different for grade level and they're different concepts so they'll be working on different onscreen lessons in terms of percentage most of the lesson is meant to be unplugged so probably about 10 minutes of onscreen practice I would say 10 minutes of screen time for lesson but you can kind of change that as it fits your class range so that's really a you know you know your students you know how long they'll need for an unemployed less aggressive screen time and yeah that's totally your call but we recommend about 10 minutes of onstreet practice per lesson yeah so it's about out of an hour so yeah ten twenty ten to fifteen book a lesson the direct instruction then like 20ish run close and then about ten online so you have a nice little rounded listen yeah and the other questions out there you don't have anything else where anything else on YouTube all right awesome well thank you all so much we really enjoyed it and we are so playing yeah we'll see you next week see you next week bye these guys
