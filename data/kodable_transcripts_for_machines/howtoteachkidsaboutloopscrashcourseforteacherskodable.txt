whoohoo let's go hi I'm Doreen I'm the director of curriculum at codable the short video is going to introduce you to the concept you'll be teaching in this unit thanks for watching in programming loops are important to learn and understand how to use to be able to create programs that can do a lot of different things loops are a programming element that repeat a portion of code a set number of times until a desired process is complete repetitive tasks are very common in programming and learning leaps is essential to save time and minimize errors let's think about a peanut butter and jelly sandwich example again we talked about how important it is to order the steps correctly to make one peanut butter and jelly sandwich but what if we needed to make 500 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for a school field trip or something we would likely prefer to just do it once and have the steps automatically repeated 500 times to make 500 sandwiches in Kota bowls on screen independent practice lessons students will identify where the code repeats and practice applying a set number of loops in this example level the same set of commands are used three times in a row down right down right down right instead of writing these commands three times we use a leap and only have to write at once if we were writing our peanut butter and jelly sandwich instructions in code it would likely be hundreds of lines long loops allow programmers to shorten what could be hundreds of lines of code to just a few this allows programmers to write their code once and use it as many times as needed making it more likely for the program to run as expected loops make code more manageable and organized as we learn more about programming and writing complex programs loops will be an important element to understand and use
