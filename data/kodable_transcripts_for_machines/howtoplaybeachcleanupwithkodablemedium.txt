imagine if you had to repeat the same steps over and over and over to complete a task for example think about writing your name easy enough right but let's say you needed to write it 10 times or a hundred how about a thousand maybe you're a celebrity and you need to keep up with all the autograph requests suddenly a simple task becomes a lot more intense wouldn't it be great if you could command your name to be written as many times as you needed in programming this would be the perfect time to use a loop a loop is a command used to repeat a part of code until a certain desired process is complete it may seem silly to imagine needing to write your name a thousand times but in reality programmers often need to write thousands of the same line of code in programming we can use a loop to repeat this code without needing to rewrite it again and again encode Abul this is what we use to program a loop this loop ER will repeat to commands a certain number of times to achieve an outcome let's take a look at how this loop can affect your code a block of code like this works the same as code like this the outcome for both is identical your Fuzz will move right down right and down but what do you notice about the two programs the first option is shorter it is only using one loop or command while the second option is for commands and repeats the same commands twice in codable if we want our fuzz to repeat certain actions we can tell it to do so using only one command space instead of multiple this is important because we want to keep our code short to minimize errors and bugs code shouldn't be long than it needs to be which is why in codable there are limited command bins when a loop can and should be used when you are creating your Me's for this activity think about what you can do to repeat patterns if you create patterns that are repeating then the commands use to move your fuzz through the maze will also repeat and you can use a loop to keep code short let's work through a level using loops together start by drawing the path that will allow the fuzz to collect all the trash here we want our fuzz to move right up right up right down right drag the commands into your program to tell your fuzz how to move uhoh it looks like there are not enough pins to hold all the commands we need let's look to see if there are any patterns of repeating commands in our code here and here after our first command we tell our fuzz to move up right up right these are two commands that are repeating we can use a loop instead this way we take up only one command bin instead of four now we can code the rest of the program and are left with bins to spare when you use a looper your code will run in sequence before the loop and pick up again right after now it's your turn create your maze code your program test it out
