we are almost done before i wrap up i'll just share some quick tips for what to do after you've evaluated student progress so you've if we kind of summarize what we've talked about so far you've thought about the standards you've used it to guide what you're teaching and what you're hoping students will learn then you might have employed some of the methods for evaluation you've conducted interviews you've looked at their designs and emphasize projects and now you want to share it and uh thinking about how to share student learning progress with admin and parents depending on how many students you have it can be a lot and i'm hoping that these these just quick possibilities are something that you might choose to do to showcase the growth and the skills that the kids have gained which again i mentioned are a bit harder to quantify so sharing it can be tricky so the first is show don't tell basically make learning and progress visible and this doesn't need to be a competition or like a star chart on your wall just having some sort of visual depiction of progress can be really motivating and inspiring and i would say as a teacher interested in bringing computer science education into your classroom you're likely also open to using technology in new ways so i would say take advantage of the digital medium you can think about posting project examples that your kids have done on a class page online or as a newsletter or like featured in a slide deck or something where you're utilizing the digital medium to share work and really who the students are to admin and parents and other teachers second would be to invite peers to join your class um when i was a computer science teacher i was the only teacher at my school who was teaching coding and there were so many other teachers that i worked with that simply had no idea what my kids were doing in my classroom because it was so different from what other classes might look like so when i started inviting them in just to have them view the work that my kids were doing they they were so excited to see the content crossover and they were more apt to ask their students what they were learning computer science and i just think it's a really nice way to illuminate this again this subject computer science for k2 students is a really new idea and the best way to share progress a lot of the time is just to invite others to witness it the third is to host an event as i've mentioned time and time again today i love projects as a way to demonstrate and assess learning and uh if you would like to showcase student progress if you've been doing projectbased learning in your classroom hosting some sort of an event that puts the projects on display is a really awesome way to do that so again using my own experience as a computer science teacher we did a projectbased unit learning unit on game design and at the end we had a mini maker faire where students got to showcase a lot of them had physical games that they had created like with recycled materials and also had games that they had coded um on scratch that they had on the chromebooks and we invited friends and family to come and interact with them and i just think this is a really lovely way for your young students to be able to share the progress the effort that they've put forth throughout the unit and just get the community involved a little bit it can be a really nice way to share the progress there
