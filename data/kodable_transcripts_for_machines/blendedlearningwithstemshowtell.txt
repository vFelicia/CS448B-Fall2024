hello everyone welcome to codable showandtell this is a first of a series that we will be running where we will be speaking with some awesome educators who are using codable in their classrooms these educators might be using codable in different or interesting ways maybe they are grappling with a problem that many other teachers are dealing with or they are just looking for an opportunity to share their students success so we are really excited to welcome Samantha Selleck off is our first spotlight teacher samantha is a technology and stem teacher at the Rockaway borough School District in New Jersey she teaches fourth through eighth grade students a wide range of students they're Amish boots and teaches stem lesson about the engineering design process perfect lecture and coding it also leads some aiding with other teachers about how to use technology in their classroom so we're so excited for some yet that to join us so my name is Hannah I am the instructional coach at codable my role is to support teachers who are living in this world of elementary computer science education I'm sort you jump into it so it's manfully and welcome thank you so much for joining us yeah we first met you on Twitter when you shared a project and more students have participated in over spring break like love and your age most sharing one those project guidelines were and kind of what was the outcome of that spring break project with code of law okay so I wanted to hear about all my students adventures over spring break and I kind of lied to me in a meaningful way so a lot of times they're excited to tell you about their adventures as they should be so sometimes it'll turn into some long story so I wanted to begin meaningful conversation they were able to take a picture with clothes that they decorated um and then share it with me and I could also share it with the class so I got to learn about what they did I said that it could be thing small that they did or something or a trip that they went on so I shared with me the first minimal is the student and their siblings going to a park the Prez was there participating with them and going to the park with them another one a student was going to her she another one the students were touring New York City so I got a series of jurors which was awesome so they got to create stories that the fuzz went on the adventure with they named their fuzz and being a part of them okay so that's good announcements I think awesome well did so did any of the projects that the students submitted for that Spring Break project surprise me did any of the students do something that you didn't really expect them to buzz um I think I was excited to see how our students got creative with it and see all the different adventures there was excited to see them all so one that I was really interested in was the tour of New York City because it was a series of pictures so it kind of like outlined the day we're getting into filmmaking next year with storyboarding so we did a little bit of storyboarding with comics this Oh would you start so creepy story for your photos next year or something like that series of pictures outline your day with the fuzz and the fuzz would be going through that day with you awesome I mean what do you think the students learned from this project the big game it was great to see the family time that they went through or that they got to participate in it was probably happening anyway but to share out in a meaningful way so they worked on their 4c so that one in particular was communication so just communicating um a memory from Spring Break was one of the things that they got to participate in well one of things that they learned was creating a concise message or I'm a clear way to express themself yeah absolutely you had mentioned those before C's so you mentioned one of them I love if you could speak a little bit more to the four C's like how do you incorporate the four C's first of all what are they and how do you incorporate them when you are designing curriculum and teaching coding well a lot of my curriculum is based off the four C's as well as an engineering process engineering design Asus is asked the management plan create improve and communicate and then the four C's are critical thinking communication collaboration and creativity when we were designing our thoughts we talked a lot about creativity they collaborated with each other to kind of come up with an idea for their buzz critical thinking they use all the time with codable because of the different strategies that they need to that they need to solve the puzzles mmhmm and communication just communicating out their message so that was one of the things that focused on with creating a buzz and creating memory with your buzz yeah absolutely so picking up really cool to be I think that alone the feedback we hear from teachers is they kind of grapple with that balance between creative meeting and teaching specific concept and like what can happen for when you want to identify when creativity hit in a computer science classroom so in other words how do you know if your students are um so creativity is a really interesting concept because it means a lot of different things to a lot of different people and how to express themselves creatively so one of the things I do is journaling which a lot of teachers do so as an exit slip sometimes they will journal out their ideas so just how did it how are they creative with in computer science you're asking mmhmm I'm so in codable when they're creating their crust on the computer I displayed some of them for what we do here of night of the Arts so I displayed some of their mazes and there were their buzz creations so not only did they get to create classes on paper through their fuzz Adventures but then they also got to create them on the computer so that's one way that they're expressing myself creatively but he also has to do with problem solving so just going through the different puzzle they're also creative in that sense absolutely as people with problem solving you mentioned that engineering design process where problemsolving is such a huge part of it how you creates opportunities for like authentic problem solving in a computer science classroom so you mentioned it with the codable puzzles I'm curious if you could share with the other teachers who might be listening what what problemsolving opportunities are you giving your students I really things back to the real world a lot of times so a lot of times I blend different current events I highlight people who have solve problems in the world outside of my classroom I have a stem in the news poster so there have different problems that they have solved other problem solving techniques just different games and strategies so sometimes logic puzzles or there's that aspect of it I do a lot of unplugged activities as well so it's part of pulling from codable and then also just that I have created in terms of problem solving techniques yeah I'm wondering if you're an example of an unplugged activity that you have used in your classroom in in tandem with codable so what kind of unplugged activities do you like to to do a lot of the unplugged activities I do have two sports or one of the infamous ones is I found on a clue orgs website where a lot of other people have also done variations of it where you're creating an aluminum foil bow and then you're seeing how many marbles it can hold someone to Cooper house how many books can the paper household so a lot of those different design challenges yeah that's great so you've spoken you the force use and a lot about creativity and it sounds like there's also a lot of opportunities for students to personalize their own project because they decorate their Fuzz I'm wondering you could speak more to than that role of personalization and like driven learning and in computer science where else use near students expressing for their personal selves in your computer science classroom well being able to create their own fuzz and also being able to manage their difficulty level on football as well so if they get frustrated too many times I have an I help poster in my classroom so just reminders of where they can go they're confused so I'm doing techniques or welcome to come to me but then also the buzz buzz rate that come with the hint is really helpful for them so it keeps them in their zone of proximal development and doesn't allow them to get too frustrated and it's nice to see when they do finally saw a level of excitement that they get so yeah speaking of that I hope posters so what are the steps that you recommend to your students when they encounter a problem how do they go about solving it I usually have them I usually have them show me which steps that they had so I go through it with them I see if a student has gone through it with them so to use their student parents as well and then will help all them together kind of like how elementary schools have the reading groups or the math groups this is just computer science groups yeah I think a lot of talkers including myself would be pretty taken aback that you teach 4th 5th 6th 7th and 8th grade Emily can you talk a little bit about the challenges of developing coding curriculum for that wide of an strange you find it challenging and if so what are what do you do about that well I use a lot of different resources and they can reach out to different community members and other educators in my community and I do get a lot of great ideas from different platforms such as Twitter and codable and Korg so it's and I do attend a lot of different professional developments as well in order to keep atop of different strategies to help my students and new technology that's coming on the rise yeah Jean what ever experience multiple students in one class who are at different levels and their learning and how so I have an expert board that once a student masters either a concept including so what are creating their apps if the one student has mastered coding a button or coding or coding a screen their name goes up on the expert board so then students can ask them questions about that and look to them as helpers so just having other students and those experts on the subject helps me manage that mmhmm do you see students moving at different paces when they're in Kota bowl or how do you regulate like how quickly the students are moving through the levels based on what they are ready for it um I allow students to go the levels on their own pace if they like so a lot of students do enjoy doing portable at home oh they do come in at all different paces which I'm okay with because then it creates more experts within the classroom yeah I like that when you when we first spoke you mentioned your students were really engaged with the maze maker can you share a little bit more about the types of means is that you've created or how do you present maker to your students a lot of the students they've created mazes within codable and they try to have other students solve their maze as well paint so that way I can solve it sometimes they create some challenging ones so they get really excited about that they also have their parents try to solve them so it becomes a family thing which is fun some of them have created different words in it so like their name or friends name so they do enjoy that part of codable yeah that's great and then a couple questions are just about your students experience with potable and if they enjoy it so my question is students take away one thing from their experience with codable what team hopes but that would be I hope that they would take away persistence because a lot of times it takes them more than one try especially as they go through the platform to to solve the puzzle so oh just / so I would say persistence is definitely one of them yeah and the problemsolving skills building off of that persistence piece because I think that is something that a lot of teachers are really interested in fostering or know for their students especially with all that about 21st century skills what are the rules you must her persistence in your classroom you mentioned with codable and parent you have other tips for teachers who are trying to encourage that cell with their students definitely through design challenges in code and just working through different problems logic problems sometimes do now is that kind of stimulate that sense of logics or problemsolving skills so there's different techniques within the classroom yeah you mentioned the boat building with the aluminum foil could you mention a couple other design challenges that might be fun or interesting for teachers to try so there's also something similar to that with the paper house you got to build a paper house then you got to have the books you see how many books it can hold I've done those have also done marble maze I've done so a lot of traditional ones but then I've done some other outofthebox ones having to do with sports lounge a curriculum also has a good one with creating a wallet or the ones that have to do with entrepreneur such as creating their own sport so there's a ton of different design challenges out there mmhmm as well sure absolutely that's important um how would you explain or describe a connection between these design challenges it really handson and then on certain coding and computer science where do you see the connection there so quotable brings a gamification aspect to computer science which is great so they are progressing to the next level or the students are progressing to the next level but then they also need movement so the unplugged activities bring that sense of movement and interactive components to computer science so it's the intention there yeah definitely what would be a recommendation that you would give to a teacher who might be hesitant about using Google for the first time or even diving into the world of computer science education at all what's a recommendation that you might give a hesitant teacher I think that one recommendation that I would give to teachers would be to not necessarily hold back you'll learn a lot of things only from the webinars and exploring the curriculum but through other teachers Twitter and then also your students as well mmhmm yeah so really just kind of diving into it giving right what can you do with it if a student asks you in that you don't know the answer to or does that happen and if so so a lot of times either another student might have solved those puzzles or there's also teacher mode so you can kind of figure out how to solve them through your account and then I reached out to codable on you guys as well either glitch in the system or for a table and solving a puzzle mmhmm buzzbuzz helps too okay yes absolutely what are your plans so we're in summer vacation congratulations what are your plans moving forward with next year encoder Bowl or coding education in general do you have any plans that you are looking forward to so we're all set up for what about for next year so we will be using quotable I would love to do some more interactive things with the cool fuzz so or unplugged wise like the fuzz Adventures for spring break so I do a component kind of like a clock cut but a book forms oh definitely with fourth grade where they take the fuzz book home they write something about what they did with the family and then they bring it back and then switching it to another student so that's certainly something that I want to do for next year so more bringing the family come on at a home life component into the classroom yeah I mean you had we mentioned that a lot of students are enjoying codable outside of school now did you introduce codable to the parents outside of school or did the students bring portable hello a letter went home with portable fuzz when they were decorating it originally about their spring break and then I also allowed the students or and told the students about the quotable summer challenge as well so they have the opportunity to do that so those are two different sides that families have seen codable and then they've also seen quotable we had like a display at night of the arts of what they've been doing with coding oh well can you say what what did I just play look Mike tell us a little bit more so some of the meze design that students committed had some of the puzzles that students mean had some of the virtual poses that students made some of the we had a whole bulletin board of the different quizzes that students create and parents and students said guests about how many lines of coding all the students combined so it had a lot of different components of coding in computer science yeah that's great I'd love to know if we have teens who reach out to us who are interested in learning more about the work that you are doing or if they have questions about incorporating you mentioned sports that are make sure the engineering design process we can be open to connecting with some other teachers they do have further questions sure they could always reach out to me on Twitter and also check out the things that I'm doing on there as well if they're interested yeah well that's how that's how we got in touch with you so yeah what other teachers would love to see that the pictures that you post from your classroom northen so much for joining us it was really great to talk to you and I look forward to speaking with you soon great thanks Anna thanks everyone bye thank you so much for watching if you are interested in learning more about blended learning with codable or you are interested in sharing ways that you have used potable in your classroom please reach out to me my email is hana at codable comm I am also running free training and onboarding sessions this summer so if you are interested in getting a walkthrough of the teacher dashboard or getting any of your codable questions answered I'm happy to help please reach out thank you so much for watching
