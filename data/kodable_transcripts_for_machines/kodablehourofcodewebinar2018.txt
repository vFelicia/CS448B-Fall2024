okay hi everyone welcome my name is Gretchen Heber I'm one of the founders of codable I'm brie gray our head of curriculum and we are so excited to talk with you guys today about the hour of code I don't know how many of you I'm sure for some of you this is your veterans at this point this is probably your fourth or fifth year doing the hour of code and um you probably could leave one of these yourselves but for some of you this might be your first hour of code so we'll just start from the beginning what is it why is it important why is it so cool why is it worth doing so the Arth code is a big international event put on by code org and Computer Science Education Week to just promote computer science education to get with the goal of getting every kid to try one hour of coding and one of the side effects of this is that so many schools have started to realize just how exciting it can be for them how much engagement they can get how important it is for their students to start thinking critically and start using their brains to solve realworld problems so it's pretty cool it's really exciting and if this is your first time get ready it's so much fun I'm really excited for you so we are gonna just run through a few things we're gonna go over a couple different ways that you can play codable this our code if you're using google for the hour of code we'll talk a little bit about how you should prepare what you should prepare for with codable like setting up your account things like that but also how you can prepare your classroom talking to students talking to other staff members what you can do to kind of get the whole community ready and then we'll go into the specific activities that we've added for this year we're really excited this year's theme is creativity so we have some really cool exciting new activities they're promoting creativity and design thinking and therefore all ages well K to five and we'll show you some of those then we will go over some of the lesson plans that we have from previous years if you decide you want to do a little bit more structured on a program you can do that and then we'll get into questions I know a lot of you submitted questions when you RSVP'd thank you I compiled all of them into a shortlist and I put it in the Google Google Doc that I posted in the chaps on the side of the window the video feel free to submit to like something pops up and you have another question feel free to write it in there where we have it right here so we can see so we'll be pausing every now and then to answer questions and then we have time at the end for more questions as well so we will be sure to answer all your questions and we're so excited so let's get started um so the first thing to note about doing yard code is all the different ways that you can participate so there are what's called unplucked activities that take place offline usually with a worksheet or some sort of game that you do with your students and then there's online activities but codable specifically has three different ways um we have our free to play online hour of code site that game codable calms a shower of code and it's really great if you want to just kind of set your kids up and you you know don't really plan on doing any sort of introduction or instruction and you just want them to do free play you can do that I'll get into how you do that in a second another option is our structured hour of code activities and you can choose to do we have lessons that go along with them if you choose to do that briefs and talk about that in a minute but again you can just set the students up it has a video it has a prompt for both they're guided challenges and then they're creative challenge and then if you decide you want to do sort of combination of all these things we have structured lessons which have an unplugged component all of them do where the kids are practicing coding concept offline together as a class that's a lot of fun or and and then you can go online in to codable it so any of the activities that we have available and play there you can also download quotable from the app store we just released a brand new hour of code update so if you haven't updated your iPads when you're playing on using iPads need to get that update it's gonna have all of these activities in it so yeah um I guess from there I'll go ahead and show go ahead and show that yeah okay yeah okay just one Christmas doing I just I see a few people say there may be some audio issues it seems as though somebody can hear us so if you can't maybe check the settings on the device you're watching it seems like it's fine for some people so just check your settings yeah sometimes if you're watching in Chrome it needs to be shut down and restarted okay so um if you are going to have your kids just start up with color Bowl and play and you don't want to set up an account a codable account that's totally fine I think probably most of you have codable accounts but if you don't that's totally fine too you're just gonna go to game codable calm this is probably the link that you want to share with your students or you're gonna open up coda bolt in the app on your iPad and just click Play without saving um you're gonna select playing at school and this will create an anonymous profile for your students to play they will not be able to save their progress unless you create an account so this login and save is gonna prompt you to set up an account but from here these are all of our hour of code activities that the students can complete if you want them to just go free play and explore you can hit explore and this will take them off into global and from here there's different activities that they can that they can play there's me Borg Australia book world you can get more into that later but that's how you set up free play um and if you decide you want to do the structured activities we'll get into that in a second but first let's go through this as if you have an account because I think a lot of you are going to have accounts that you're using with classes set up for your students so we'll go as if we're playing that yeah and I think one point to mention here is if you plan on continuing with codable beyond here could this is a great a great option to set up an account I think a lot of students will be bummed if their progress is not saved so if you know it's something you're going to be doing continuing with our free trial after this week or after you did the art of code I'd definitely set up that account so your kids will have their progress saved from the hour of code definitely and there's some other cool things like you can check their progress you can send home their create their creations so you can actually print it out and send it home with them it's got the code that they've written their characters that they created and different things so you'll also get certificates with their names already printed on them um will show you where you can download just a generic certificate break and write in their names if you don't have an account but if you do have one it's nice because you don't have to go and write all their names out so um okay let's go ahead and see as if we have an account setup um so actually we'll talk a little bit about how do you get set so if you decide to set up an account the things that you're gonna want to have prepared for the hour of code are to create an account and set up your classes it takes minutes it's very quick this is what your dashboard looks like you can go through this quick wizard you just create a class name I'm going to say this is a first grade class and you just add your name your students names um you can actually copy and paste from a roster if you have a digital roster there's also other ways that you can import students using Google classroom and clever you have that and then this is the most important part you're gonna want to set up a class code so this is something that your students will use to log in and actually pick their name from the roster so you want to make it something kind of memorable or you can choose from one of the options that we have here but from for myself I'm just gonna say quotables power of code that's probably long enough okay save and continue so what you're gonna do is use this link to get your students logged in to codable so this actually is a unique URL click it okay can you tell my students okay yeah so you can copy this link and save it to either your class dashboard or your class website or if you just want to post this somewhere for your students to get to if you are using includable on the iPad you're just gonna use that the class code that we created so your students will be prompted to enter that class code it'll download this roster they'll never actually have to enter it again it's just that one time and then they select their name and we're in and here your you can see the hour of code activities you can encourage them to do any of these that are great appropriate if you decide you're going to be using any of the lesson plans another thing to do to prepare is to maybe print that lesson plan that you're gonna be using and we'll get into it the lesson plans here in a second so once you have a codable set up like you just saw it's really simple there's a few things that you might want to do to prepare your class so your students and your your school community for the hour of code if you are the only teacher in your school doing it cool awesome way to go good for you a lot of you asked about how to invite others to get involved and participate and that's amazing way to go I think that one of the best ways to do that is to just invite them to your or one of your lessons one of your hour of code lessons let them just observe let them be maybe your assistant if there's questions or just kind of mill around the room and by administrators invite other teachers invite parents even parents to really get a kick out of this don't be afraid to invite and kind of invite people and kind of make it a party because it should be a lot of fun the other thing to do is to set up classroom expectations for your students if you feel like this is needed it's you know you've done you've already done this in this lawyer you might not need to but I like to always encourage students to ask three and then me so that you're not inundated with questions because it is a time for exploration problem solving you know really thinking through difficult puzzles basically and I'm using all of our logic skills and our and our problem solving skills so encourage kids to work with a partner to solve problems before they come running to you for answers because you might not know that's the thing and one thing to that I sad that Gretchen I have experienced and our time going into classrooms is definitely introducing the tutorials for each of the activities as a full group first so each activity is meant for students relative to on their own there will be a tutorial that walks them through sometimes there's a video but especially with younger kids sometimes there can be you know an issue with someone's headphones they can't hear the video or they clicked off the tutorial they didn't actually see it so I think even before they get onto their devices maybe just going through that introduction as a whole group and then if they you know see it for a second time on their own that's fine too but just setting it up so everyone knows what the activity is and kind of how to get started and kind of make that transition a little easier once they get on to their own device definitely definitely um the last thing to do to sort prepare yourself for this is have a backup plan most of the sites the activity partners are going to have their highest traffic of the year on their web sites so there might be some connectivity issues you're gonna have a lot of students accessing your WiFi network in your school at the same time and that might cause some some traffic issues so just have a backup plan making an unplugged option like I said we're going to get into some of those in a minute but just have that in case you have you know a few minutes where there's loading issues or you know everybody needs to refresh or whatever um have that as a backup just in case I just like to to let people know that that's available if they need it but if you're using codable or in the ipad you shouldn't have any problems because it can work offline so if for any reason that leaves this connection whenever it regains that connection that will send all their progress to us anyway so that it'll be there the next time they log in um yeah the other thing is if you do have issues feel free to email us anytime our whole team is getting we're on high alert this whole week so support equitable net home goes to all of us and we'll be quick to respond throughout the week so okay I think now we can get into the activities excellent today awesome I'm so excited um we worked really hard on these and I hope that you guys enjoy them so I'll go through these by age I'm starting with k22 which actually brings me to a lot of a lot of the questions were concerning how to teach preschool or kindergarten or first grade students and codable we started our company with five year olds in mind we actually worked our way up from that so it's very wellsuited for a kindergarten student I think that once you take a look at some of these activities and also take a look some of the lesson plans you'll find that it's very simple for them to get started especially if you're using iPads I definitely recommend tablets for free young students just because some motor skills of using a mouse over like a trackpad is really difficult but um if you have iPads in and use a class code and you have that class set up for them whenever they get to your room then it's really simple they just sign their name and then they can start so it's a really quick process to get them logged in and then after that it's basically go and then they're there often and going so um we'll start with them I just want to add something really quickly um you can control the sound on each of your devices but typically you know I would say teachers and Pharaon students at the same time I usually tell teachers to turn the music off but in these tutorial cases it's actually different because we do have videos in construction so if you have headphones or you know that you know you have some way of managing students watching things and listening to things at the same time that's definitely something to be prepared for when you get into this that's a very good point definitely okay so um for the meze maker challenge some of you may have seen this last year we've actually updated it a little bit but some of the challenges are similar but I think that yeah and it's a similar concept in terms of what students are doing the unplugged version is the same so it's just giving them a structured way to get introduced to this um but yeah scratching the saying it's a little different on the screen this year yes and so what you're gonna want to do is have them select their grade if it's their first exposure to codable you might want to have them like if they're in second grade you might want to have them try the first grade option before jumping to second grade just if it's their first time using codable because it does get into conditions in the second grade tutorial which is a more advanced concept some students might struggle with it a little bit so you might want to start them with first grade and then as a reward they can move on to the second grade option or they can move on to the build your own flaws if they if they finished shortly but I don't we didn't have that in any other classes really that we went to um so I'm gonna go through so they're gonna see um five levels to complete and they can go through these five levels it's gonna be a variety of codable mazes that they have to solve each one is slightly different or some of them are hard or some of them are easier so we tried to make it a nice balance then once they've completed these four levels this button will turn green start my creative challenge they can click that and they'll see the prompt to make some kind of a geometric shape in the maze maker challenge um so that's that one I'm actually gonna go to these makers you can guys you can see what it actually looks like for those of you now the great thing about the maze maker is it leaves room for so much creativity but especially with K through two students obviously they need some kind of structure so as Gretchen's going to show you with our newsmaker it's kind of a blank canvas um so giving them some kind of challenge is really what we're aiming for to get their creative you know ideas flowing and then beyond this they'll be able to create nearly anything that they want this we have words yeah numbers letters things like that um but it is definitely an abstract kind of blank canvas of their starting with so it'll give them a prompt this has create you know a shape I think for the first grade one it's make a square and they just start by drawing and they can do any kind of square they want it does not need to be a perfect square what I mean square is perfect square but it doesn't need to look just like this like they can do those big squares however they feel we added new maze decorations this year for the maze maker challenge it's pretty neat so they can play around the 'those we've got some little gnomes that are adorable got some worms got some rocks we've got some pools and then they just place them their stars wherever they want them to go and we should point out here that the maze must be solvable for them to be able to save it so placing the stars they need to put them in areas where they're going to get them when they test and solve their means right so then they have to actually try their maze and solve it and then once they're amazed is solved it will save and if you are using the codable class if you've set up a class ahead of time it'll actually share it with the entire class so the whole class will be able to view mazes that you can see here some mazes that were created by my class I've got a lot of them this is great because students can create music for each other you can create mazes for your students to do you can pick a student and say you know everyone's going to do Katniss every beans maze today it's really a good way to collaborate you can have kids sharing their work with each other yeah so that's main maker um and I will go back to UM bilder fest did you want to go over the lesson for this one um yeah so the newsmaker challenge lesson is the same as it was last year so as Gretchen was mentioning it will prompt students to make a shape and so we did this last year with K through 5 so in our lesson plan we actually have Common Core math standards aligned so each grade level and you know if you want to do this with 3rd 4th and 5th bits in a lesson plan it's prompted to do some kind of math activity based on there or standards yep so to view that lesson plan you're just gonna go to Kalitta Bolcom slash hour of code you can see all of these activities here if you use this button the play on one button it's gonna take you directly to the mate to the maze maker activity same for builder and fuzz and the game maker if you click view lesson plan this is where you can see the lesson so you can see the objectives how to access maze maker and that's outside of the hour of code activity how you would access it if you weren't in the area of code and then yet all of the maze major prompts yeah so and then you have the list of materials that you can download okay then we'll go ahead and get into build round fuzz and just demonstrate this I'll go ahead and click on this button I'm gonna play while saving all right so now you see like it's pointing at the one that I want to click on which is really nice if you're if you're why don't you make it easy for yourself okay so I'm gonna click build buzzes this one works a little bit different from the maze maker we start with a creative challenge so this is where students will actually fill the character and I can show you how that works so every student will get this video it's a little prompt about building a character and thinking about the fuzz is thinking about a character from the story that they like what characteristics make make them who they are and then using that as inspiration to create their own character so once they watch that um they can enter their buzzes name you're going to drive over all of the characteristics for their character and then they can actually edit all of these these properties of their character so if I want to change the smile I'm gonna have my fuzz stick their tongue out can do that if I want to change their eye color I can make their ends red and then say I want to change the color the body that so this is all JavaScript here so this is a little bit more of an advanced advanced tutorial it's first second grade and up we definitely recommend using it with students that age and maybe not younger just because they need to be able to read that you know they're gonna be editing at the body the eyes the mouth they're gonna be changing the properties of that it can't be done with younger students but I would stick with me as maker if it were me and then you can add accessories to your fuzz so I'm gonna give my fuzz crown and I'm going to some sparkles because who doesn't like sparkles and I think just for good measure I'll add a mustache okay and I'm gonna say so if you were using codable with a class this fuzz will actually show up on your teacher dashboard and you can print out the code that was that they just wrote and also a picture of their fuzz that they created yeah and then this unplugged activity that goes with this the code for a fuzz is used so basically to kind of go with this building character's activity we give an example of that code that corrections talking about so anytime your students build the fuzz with our fuzz builder look at you'll get to see the code that they write on their dashboard so this worksheet that goes with this activity is actually giving an example of that JavaScript for a fuzz and then students are kind of planning their fuzz before they get on and do that activity so they're just filling in those values that Gretchen was showing you can modify to write what their fuzz is going to look like before they do it yeah so you can send this home with them along with the printout if you decide to print out your students characters so here's that lesson then yeah so then the students can start solving mazes with their character and it's gonna go through a quick tutorial but the levels get pretty difficult pretty fast we introduce conditions there's some pretty tricky levels in here that you definitely need to use your problemsolving skills to figure out I'd encourage you to have students working in pairs if they're a second grade class because it can get kind of tricky but it's definitely fun and honestly it's a great opportunity it's the whole group is struggling on one put it up on the board and kind of solve it together as a class okay that is children sighs all right now get into creating games so this is our most advanced tutorial or activity for the hour of code we're getting into creating a game with JavaScript and so what the students are gonna do and this is probably the one that I would most recommend using the unplugged materials that go with it it can be an awesome chance for especially your older students to really engage with each other and start learning about each other's preferences or the two cans and design just the design process in general which we'll get into after you know Gretchen shows you this but I highly recommend including the unplugged portion for this activity yep definitely so what students are gonna do they're gonna play through some levels just this is mainly to introduce the game concept that they're going to be building off of so this is asteroid eeeh this is where we introduce variables to students so this code that's written here is actually a code that you would write in JavaScript if you are going to add a string called purple so purple is this variable this furball that we just put into this container which is a metaphor for actually using variables in programming so once you have that you can match it to the asteroids over here so the object of the game is to clear the asteroid field so you can move on to the next lesson and when you combine the correct colors they will actually cascade and fall so this was just cleared with one shot because I matched those two blue sections together the same is gonna happen here so I'm going to use a red and it's gonna cause a cascade effect this is kind of like candy crush if any of you guys are familiar with that I promise you your students will have no problem with this but I'm gonna go through it with you guys because we get a lot of questions about this game so then the yellow then the green and the blue and the purple then these rocks will disappear we're off so this is a simple way of getting students familiar with what variables look like and the idea of putting a value into a container and then matching it with something well this one is a little bit harder so I need to say okay so we're going to use blue and I'm gonna put a green although I think those are gonna collapse that'll collapse it should work I'm gonna try it with just blue I'm gonna need red okay I'm gonna try another red too okay I'm gonna start with blue see what happens yay okay good job so then we clear the red and we're off all right I think you guys probably have it figured out by now but just in case of show you this one so I'm gonna hit this pink in the middle it's gonna cause everything else to fall and match and we should be able to do it in one hit yes whoo yay okay I think that's the last one yeah so then the students can start their creative challenge and it's the same scenario it's gonna give them video prompts you're probably gonna want to have headphones available for this just talking about game designers and how they come up with games what they're thinking when they're making games they're not just you know going through it without anyone in mind they usually have a specific person in mind um that they think of as their end user who's gonna be playing their game and so we're going to encourage students to think of someone in particular what kind of games they like and try to make a game for them yeah and the unplugged X would be actually has partnering with someone in class it's kind of an interview she just asking them about some of their preferences if they like games easier hard engaging their level of experience with games all of these things that the game designer would keep in mind before they build their game and then the idea is the whole design this game for that person and then get feedback from that person as a user and then they can make iterations and change the game great so once that video is finished playing it'll walk them through editing their first part of the game so this again is all in JavaScript these here are the properties of the game so we're gonna give our program a name or name our game so tonight the same thing to kind of add in here to I know we talked a little bit about classroom expectations but this is a great chance to include some digital citizenship perhaps especially for older kids with naming games and you know you know kind of going over what's appropriate for games and fuzz names this is just a good opportunity to keep that in mind uh students do you have the freedom to kind of type in their own creative ideas so I just edited the property for the number of Bin's that are gonna be available for my player the more bins you have the easier your game will be because you'll have more colors to match with your asteroids okay we're gonna test our game there are far like there are so many properties your students can get into to edit their game this just walks them through a couple and then they can go back in make changes if they need to so we're playing an Endless mode now the objective is to just last as long as you can and then they'll keep coming in so if I want to edit my code if I want to edit my game back to my code file here yes and I can say I want to add instructions to my game so I'm going to go to game instructions okay perfect and I'm going to save that so now my player will have instructions and I want to add a little bit of pizzazz to my game so I'm gonna add a smoke trail to my fur balls whenever they go add a rainbow great and one more thing I'm going to edit the properties of my asteroids over here if I want to make it difficult for my player I can do some things over here I can change the asteroid drop direction I can add rocks which don't match any of the fur balls you actually have to make them collide to disappear I'm gonna add making a taco time which is pretty fun taco time is true and let's give it a try so you can see how great this is for design thinking getting students working collaboratively thinking of their end user as somebody who has emotions and has not only is wanting to play a fun game but striving to make a game that is well balanced for them a balance I believe is vocab words that's in the in the lesson I'm talking about making a wellbalanced game and why that's important and it's fun to to talk with students about why I'm sorry what properties you can change to make your game easier or harder there's specific ones you can you can use to make your game easier or or more difficult and they'll start to figure that out as they as they play around with it um okay so I think now is a great time for questions do we have any questions on anything we covered so far just wait we're on a little bit of a delay so that if we have any issues we can soften okay I don't know okay looks like there's no question so go ahead and move on if you have questions going to post them in just a minute all right the last thing that we want to go over is our structured lesson plans so we went over kind of the unplugged portion of all of these creative challenges that we've added this year but we have so many lesson plans that you can choose from for the hour of code a number of you asked about how to manage we're sort of juggle teaching kindergarten through fifth grade for the hour of code if you have lots of grades that you are teaching and you don't want to have to do a different lesson for every day or every class we do have lessons that build off of each other so it's a similar lesson but it's adapted for each grade level um so I'll go ahead and show you that and that'll bring us to all of the others okay so you're gonna go back to that codable comm slash at work code page and just scroll down to the bottom and you'll see lesson plans for teachers this is very top one introduction to programming is a perfect introduction to coding it is very similar to the very first lesson that we include in codable as part of our curriculum it's been adapted for each grade level so you just select the grade that you're looking for and it'll bring that grade up so if I'm going to teach my first grade class it's gonna bring up the adapted version of this lesson for first grade class and each lesson builds off of the idea of teaching sorry of programming a robot the robot being maybe a coteacher another student a parent another you know a person basically who's pretending to be a robot programming them to move across the room and then we give you code that you're going to write up on the board together to solve this problem and then you can go into codable and play levels that are picked out specifically for this lesson um I'll go ahead and show you this so we've got vocab cards for this which is great we have yeah so that's where you can find all of them the vocab for that and you're going to use symbols like this to actually program your robot you know anything you know we do have a couple questions coming in though okay for middle school and high school kids so we obviously adapted this you know across khazars five take a look at that lesson I think you'll find ways you can adapt to things are already doing with middle or high school students and then we're gonna get into in a second but my favorite lesson for older students and I think it'd be really interesting I'd love to hear you know how this goes and see the work done with middle schoolers and high schoolers on our women in tech lesson this is our social studies lesson and it spans over a few days so you could do this for the entire week it really digs into opinion writing it's heavy on the ela front but also social studies it's just exploring the roles of women and technology with the examples and in portions of writing and definitely reading too so I would love to hear that because if you try that with a middle school or high school class we'd love to see the work that comes out of that yeah so this has three days of content again can be spanned out across the entire week each day has a video prompts and has some really great questions to have students kind of research and thinking and talking and sharing opinions so and I think it is a great example to you know all of our lessons can really be adapted to other grade levels just based on what you're currently teaching so that one you know it can span across 3rd 4th or 5th grade comments and are others too like the one Gretchen showed you minor adaptations can make it really applicable to different grade levels yeah this introduction to programming lesson I've actually done with a middle school class and everybody had a great time so don't be afraid of adapting it can definitely work again and then if like if you're if your students have been doing codable say you've been doing codable and you want to try something a little bit more advanced I encourage you to check out some of our advanced introduction lessons and that will get into a grade appropriate concept that's not just sequencing and algorithms we get into conditions and looping lots of cool stuff in in those lessons and then I guess the last thing to go to cover in this area is our cross content area lesson plans so if you're looking again from middle school the my first app pizza party lesson is a great option for older students we do have a k22 option for this a pre Reader option as well but I think that this brings yeah I'm just gonna say this one you know is going to be very easy to do for other grade levels it is super openended this is an inquiry based learning lesson the style of this lesson it's almost like giving kids a blank slate to work together to come up with our own ideas so these video prompts are kind of kind of going to guide them through the problem and then they're really spending less their time solving it and that can look and so many different ways for so many different ages so that will be a great one to try with your older kids too yeah so you can see students work in pairs or groups to complete the daily inquiry sheet accompanying the video so your download resources it's gonna include all of those video enquiries and lastly I guess we'll show robotics so there are there is a science lesson here that Bree developed it's one of my favorites actually it's really fun materials yeah you do need materials but I think it's worth it um and then we've got some writing lessons that are K through five adapted already for you so if you have if you want to do that you can do that um we have an ela lesson which is prequel create your own adventure coding challenge which is also very easy to adapt and we gave an example of a book but you guys could use any any kind of you know other story that you have in mind or that's relevant to your classroom um and then we've obviously this is a fan favorite but we do have a robotics lesson available using and Doc's either you have um dot in your classroom and you want to do a robotics lesson it is k appropriate and it's an introduction to robotics um so check that out the last but not least well I guess we can pause well you haven't done a couple question of it coming in we have so I saw somebody it's it's a little higher up in the chat but somebody was asking about collaboration with younger students specifically kindergarten I think that's totally up to you collaboration of programming is huge right program is an awesome thing I think if you are looking for social emotional benefits I think that's a great way to do it kindergarteners that at this point in a year I know it's December may not be in a place where they can work productively in pairs that's going to be dependent upon individual classrooms so I mean if you have kids at the point in the year where they're ready to do partner work and engage in conversation and work together I think it's a great idea if you find that may detract our names and maybe they're not ready for it so I think that's definitely your call I recommend doing it if you if you feel your classroom is there though cool yes so Steve s was asking about it building towers which is coming soon it's not available in the app right now that activity but we do have an unplugged lesson that is available for that so if you want to do the towers X and be unplugged and it is available as one of our lesson plans in our lesson library and that is just a quick game kind of teaching kids about properties and some of our classes and objects and Peguero it's a really fun card game yeah it's just teaching kids you know and there are vocab cards too so I would definitely recommend going with vocabulary and getting into the game kids are experimenting with different properties and values and adding values together it's pretty math Pepe it's definitely a partner activity it's fun cool pictures cool art I would definitely check that out yeah one thing to note is that all of these activities are going to be available beyond just the hour of code so if you have a successful week say you invited a fellow teacher to your room to see this stuff happening and they love it they can go and do this another week it does not each be doing an hour of code you can do this throughout the year all of these activities are available to you throughout the year when we add the built the tower building activity it'll be available on our our code website where we've been going this entire time instead of being grayed out it'll be clickable so you can feel free to use that lesson later on if you decide to it's really rad it's a cool lesson so yeah okay the last thing that I wanted to go over is how to get certificates for your students if you have a like we said if you have a clinical account that you're using and you have students imported when you you'll be able to print certificates with all their names on them from your teacher dashboard that's what I recommend that's I would do I'm always up for saving time but if you would like to if you still don't want to create an account and you want to just get a certificate for your kids let me show you where you can do that so you're just gonna go back to this quotable calm such our code site scroll down here below the lesson plans and into your email address and we will send you a certificate and that can be printed on your school printers um and you can add students names it's really cool it's a great certificate I think and there will also be at the end of every at the end of every challenge so at the end of every hour of code challenge you can actually click get your certificate this button will turn green and your students will see a certificate popup that can be printed from that device so if they have access to a printer they can just print their own if they're playing without saving it will not have their name on it if you're playing without an accountable not have your name on if they are playing with their class code it will have their team on it so something to keep in mind alright that is everything I know we have a lot of questions and we want to run through um so yeah I'm gonna go ahead and start doing that um does anybody if you do have questions that you want us to answer go ahead and post them in the chat send them to us on Twitter Pat codable we are monitoring that as well cuz we're great at multitasking mmhmm okay so does quotable share student data with third parties no we do not feel free to check our privacy policy we will never share student data we got into how to teach young students prek to first grade we talked a little bit about managing multiple classes multiple grades we talked about how I can get other teachers to join do they need to finish all the activities no your sims do not need to finish if they don't finish that's okay they can finish at home especially if you're they're playing on a school account if you want to log in and create an account then they can save their progress and come back to it later otherwise they will lose their progress if they log out on but you don't feel like they have to finish if they don't finish they can always come back and try it again another time we never never had a problem with kids complaining about having to do things action it's funny the teachers tend to get worried about it but the kids are like okay um okay do you offer free PD for teachers we offer these webinars from time to time we do not offer structured PD courses for free but we do have a variety P options available also um a training call is included in all of our school plans so if you are a global school subscriber and you haven't been imported by priests you should get in touch with us because we have PD for you can I step in your class can we Skype with your class we would love to so email me Gretchen at pootle comm if the time is available I would love to talk with your class and I can speak for brave it I think that she would probably enjoy it as much yes so we talked about middle school activities we talked about JavaScript this code will require a flash no we do not require flash can code will be used with pupils with additional learning needs yes codable is not designed for students with special needs however it is commonly used in that context we are not the experts there that is your domain if you teach students with special needs than feel free to give it a try and evaluate it and see if it's something that works for your kids we would love to hear about it yeah we we recently did a feature update for hi students so we have that on our blog we will send out the link in the chat as well so you guys can learn a little bit more about it fun factor a designer is actually comfortable and so he did some awesome work to make that happen yeah so they were proud of that yeah the ability to turn that on for any students who are color blind and need that assistance mm how long does a unit of coding take for other schools it really depends on your school and what you define as a unit um some schools only participate in the hour of code once a year they just do the artwork Odin and their own they're done and that's fine others are teaching code school teaching coding throughout the school year usually once a week for about an hour and there are ten coding units in codable each unit is about five weeks long so they range from a beginner all the way to advanced and if you are doing a really depends oh and what you feel up to and what you can fit in your schedule if you have questions about this and you want to talk a little bit more code beyond an hour of code I would be happy to have that conversation with you I do that a lot with different schools that work with so many schools on how to do that how to implement we also have a series on our blog about implementing computer science at your school and the four stages of doing that how this wouldn't roll out over four stages we can share that with you it's a great resource it's basically the culmination of all the knowledge that I've had years of talking with schools um okay my students are experienced with codable is there anything new or more advanced they could do this year they're gifted students in grades 1 through 7 yes whenever some of the advanced tutorials the advanced activities I think any of those of the agreat sit for gifted students or students who are experienced with decodable can you create a class for free yes you can just go to quotable column and click get start and that's where you can create your account deokman iPads or Chromebooks for kindergarten I recommend iPads definitely can I get PD credit for this PDE credit for this webinar I'm not sure we're not working with any districts directly to provide credit for this webinar I would ask them I'm more than happy to share this link and I'm not sure if I can get the chat archive but um any I'm willing to vouch for anybody who says they were here so um if you watch this farm I think you've earned an hour of PT credit okay Helen can you list ways that koto illness can be integrated with reading writing on maths 384 uh any lessons that are common core aligned well it will be listed in the sand by the grade level in the standard so some of them just showed you tonight the math actually wasn't the math the social studies has ela standards we have a whole ela unit which is aligned and it goes by grade level and yes they are great for extenders they don't know them off the top of my head what grade levels can this be used for Oh kotas I don't know why I've kept that question we covered that but anyway what total is k25 and doing but it can be adapted for many other great now the last question can I transfer students from a class I set up last year to a new class so that they don't lose their progress yes and if you are in this Google Doc that I posted at the beginning of the video it'll be in the comments section once this video is complete but there's a link to how to do that you can also go to support doc codable calm and we have tons of articles on how to manage classes how to manage students how to view progress how to basically any question that we get a lot it's the answer is there yeah do we have the other question is in the chat just a bunch of folks say thank you and they're excited cool thank you guys this is so much fun we we look forward to the art code every year we work so hard basically from August from August until November is just out of code our code yes um so yeah I hope you guys enjoyed it please share with us you are able to share photos and videos and all of the excitement happening with your students in your classroom please please please share those with us we love that we have a feed coming up in our team slack that has all of our Twitter mentions so just mention us on Twitter at codable and we'll see it and we will love it it makes us so happy so and if you are interested in having a snack with your class please email us again my email address is Gretchen at quotable comment MT Mountain bribri e at critical comm like the cheese free like the cheese alright guys thanks guys thank you so my next week yeah we're so excited bye
