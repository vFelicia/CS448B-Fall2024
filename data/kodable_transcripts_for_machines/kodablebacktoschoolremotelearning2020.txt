alrighty we're here hello hi everyone um welcome to the codable back to school webinar uh we are so excited to talk to you all we're so so excited to go back to school with you um i'm gretchen i'm one of the founders of codable with me today is hannah um and we are looking forward to a new school year even though it's going to look a little bit different uh we've learned a lot in the spring and the summer and you're ready with lots of great tools for you to use to support your students whether you are in person or remote um do you want to take a second to introduce yourself sure my name is hannah boston i am the instructional coach and designer here at codable so the bulk of my role is creating resources for you for the teachers to make teaching easier in your classroom so that includes teacher guides and lesson plans as well as materials for students so i've been working a lot on studentfacing videos and worksheets anything to support that firsttime experience using codable and i actually have a background in teaching i did about five years as a preschool teacher and museum educator and tots in middle school computer science as well so i'm really excited that everybody is here and that we can share some of these awesome resources that we've been working on to get ready for the school year thanks hannah yeah um so welcome everybody as you guys are introducing yourselves in the chat if you haven't introduced yourself um you know tell us your name where you're from you know what grades you teach and maybe one thing that you are either nervous about or excited about for new school year um i'm gonna quickly go over our agenda and then we'll get started so uh first we're going to talk about our remote learning tools lots of you asked for tools to support your students as you're teaching remotely so we're going to cover all the things that we created this summer including some remote login tools as well as some teaching tools for you then we're going to go over how to set up one or many classes many of you asked about how you can set up lots of classes uh all at once and so we're going to go over some of those tools with you uh then we're going to see what it looks like to log in and play as a student just so that you know what your students are experiencing uh and you can see what it's like to log in for them uh then hannah has some instructional tips for you and tools a lot of you asked about grade specific uh teaching tips so she's going to share some of that with you including our scope and sequence and we've set aside a good amount of time today for question and questions and answers uh normally we like to spend a little bit more time going through like the setup of everything but we knew that this year would be a little bit different there might be lots of extra questions so uh we've set aside a good amount of time for q a at the end um so if you do have questions please post them in the chat on the right hand side of the video um brie who many of you might have already talked to uh is standing by answering questions as they come up um but if you see someone you may pause and answer them during the webinar so all right we'll get started so i'm going to go over to my teacher dashboard and this is at dashboard.codable.com and this is where you log in to see everything that you need to manage your classes uh to see lesson plans to check student progress to assign videos to assignment levels to students visit dashboard.codable.com right now this is our new remote learning kobe 19 support page we've added this over the summer it's your hub for all of the tools that you might need to support students learning remotely but all of these tools are really useful whether or not you're in the classroom so i imagine they will eventually become a permanent fixture in the codeable product they just might be in a different place but um for now they're all here in a quick place to find them first i'm going to go over student login so um so i'm going to show you okay so we created this custom link for teachers so this is a great place for you to share uh with families how they can find their child's login information um so this is a custom link for you and your classes so that's it little show okay great so you can see i have a lot of classrooms where i took a little while load but you can see it here are all of my classes my parents can go to find their class then they'll view the class and they'll be able to find their child so once they find their child they can download blogging instructions and this will show them exactly how to log into the game how to use the class code what the class code is everything that their child needs to log in and get started learning at home so you can see it shows use the school profile um where to log in on ios where to log in on web and then the class code and the parent code for them great all right and the next tool that we have if you're not comfortable sharing all of that information with um you know parents then that's totally fine we have an option here uh to just download a csv of all of your students login information so this is nice if you want to put it in your lms or if you just want to send it to people individually but you want it all in a single list you can get it for each class if you want to get all classes you just click export all classes if you want to find a specific class you just click that and it's going to save a csv for me there you go you can see i've got my child the student's profile name the class name the class code and then if you have passwords enabled for your class either a password or a picture password it'll show what that would be for the student right here if you don't have it on it's still going to show up here because we assign those automatically you just have to enable it if you want to use it um but it'll still be on this list okay and uh the last thing that i want to cover is our letter to families so this is really nice uh to use in conjunction with either of these options it's a letter that goes over um exactly what students are going to be learning coding in general uh we have a spanish version and an english version i'm gonna show that so yeah it shows what we will learn we're going to code what grades k the two are going to learn what grades three or five are going to learn why coding is important and then down here at the bottom you've got their uh class code and instructions on how to log in with that so it's really useful if you just want to send this home that's totally adequate but if you want to send more information if you have passwords enabled or something like that either of the two options that i showed previously will be useful for you okay and with that i'm going to hand it over to hannah who's going to show us some of our other teaching tools for mot changing great yeah so gretchen really went over some tools for remote login but getting the kids logged in is the first step then we're going to teach them using codeable and we've developed a series of materials here you can also find them on the covet 19 resources and updates page that will help you introduce codable for the first time in a remote setting again totally useful in person as well and how to teach some of the concepts along with the game in distance learning as well so the first resource that i will show you is this remote learning kickoff lesson this is a slide stack that i put together to help with that first time introducing codable to student experience so we got a lot of feedback from teachers who were saying i want to introduce codable to my kindergartners i haven't met them they're far away i can't be there in person what flow should i go through to to show them codable for the first time so this is a slide stack and you won't be able to edit this so just make a copy when you open it up and then you can modify it and change it and make it your own so it works for you and your students and this will walk through some of the background of codable and how to get them playing so i won't go through every slide but i'll just point out some highlights there's some openended questions to start getting kids excited and interested in the world of codable we have a video here meet the fuzz family if you haven't seen this video i recommend you check it out this gives some background to the fuzz family why they are living on fostopia what the different worlds of codable are and some background about the fuzz family i find that it helps kids get engaged and especially for younger students having some sort of story background can be really powerful for kind of sparking that interest right off the bat encodable in general the other very useful part of this slides deck is we walk through all the steps to getting kids logged in because if they have their login information great but how do they use it especially if you can't read so there's lots of pictures here for kids to follow you could be sharing this slide stack in a zoom call for example and walk kids through the steps they need to get into codable and the final piece that is really helpful about this slides deck i just added this video last week and it is a tour of fuzztopia so we've gotten some feedback from teachers that they can get the kids logged in but then what are they looking at what is the world of festopia what is this tree house how do they get to the lesson the level of the game levels uh so this video will walk through all of that it introduces fuzztopia and if kids ever need to go back and watch to see what is that building that i go to to make my own fuzz um this video will be super helpful for them again you could play it and screen share so that they can watch it with you on zoom or something or you could just share the link individually so that's a great way to introduce codable for the first time again make it your own modify it if you make a copy it's totally yours the second thing that i will point out that can be really helpful for using codeable to teach in a remote setting or in person are these video lessons you can find them here on the covid page or by clicking the button on the left side menu and these videos are broken down into two different categories we have videos that explain so these are videos that explain different coding concepts that kids are learning in the game and then we also have videos for creation so these are great for posing an openended challenge or some sort of an activity for kids to do that will spark a little bit more creativity if you are using codable for the first time with students i definitely recommend starting out a lesson with some sort of explain video we have a video for every single coding concept that codable teaches so whether it's sequence or conditions loops functions there's a five less than five minute video for every one of these topics they have kid friendly examples examples from the real world that kids can draw on their own experiences and it can just really help especially if you are feeling not super confident in your own coding ability these videos are very helpful for introducing a concept to students for the first time so i definitely recommend checking those out again you can find them right here on the covid page and oh i did i did want to point out that you can assign these videos directly to students so one option is to play it and like i said screen share so they can watch it with you the other thing you can do is click this assign video to students button it will bring up the menu and you can choose to assign the video to different classes gretchen later in this webinar will show you how kids will access those videos but they can get to them directly from the game itself so that was a feature that we had requested a lot and we're super excited that we were able to put it in kids can get the videos right in the game when they need the help the most so that is that um the last oh i have two more things i'm just going to show you for using uh the kovid 19 resources for teaching with codable um the next thing is worksheet packets so these are packets broken down by grade level that are perfect for having an unplugged experience these are great for those of our students that don't have computer access or access to reliable internet or as a supplementary material to accompany the online screen time you can also have some unplugged worksheet time and you can download these directly from this page i will show you what they look like now so there are quite a few worksheets in each packet and i'm hoping to be developing more as the semester goes on but these worksheets were designed to kind of mirror the same experience that kids are getting in the game but on paper so they're broken down by concept and if you were to download these worksheets right at this moment they would look like this if you download them in a couple hours they will look like this i'm updating them to include more content integration so we heard from a lot of teachers that you guys wanted to know not just the coding concepts that these worksheets are teaching but also what other skills these worksheets can be used to support and so if you download these in a couple hours they will have a little tag on the top for all the other integration topics that the worksheets cover so again great for kids to use if you want a little bit of a break from screen time or if they don't have internet or computer access and then the final piece if you've been using codeable before you know about this already but i just want to point it out how you assign game levels to kids so it's on the assignments tab on the left and you can click on the world that you want to assign levels for i'll start with smeeborg which is our introductory world so whether your kids are in kindergarten or fifth grade they'll probably be starting with smiborg and you can assign game levels right here so you choose the episode of levels that you want to assign you can click the assign button and choose the classes you want to assign the levels for they will assign automatically and your kids are ready to go so when they log in to the game they will only be able to play the levels that you have assigned here on the level assignments page it's great if you want to stop kids from moving too far forward you can unassign them and kind of control the pacing for your different classes so those are some of the resources that we have and i'll just really quickly say an example structure for how to use all of these because that was kind of a lot of stuff this is just a recommendation so again it's totally up to you but i might recommend introducing the coding concept with a video or an explanation some sort of instructional time then you can have kids fill out a worksheet and then you can have them play the game level as just a kind of natural progression from introduction to application to um playing the game levels themselves so if you have any more questions about how to modify these resources for your own class definitely let us know i'm happy to work oneonone with any teacher to make sure that you put together a structure that feels like it works for you and now that we've kind of gone over the login tools the teaching tools gretchen is going to touch on how to set up your classes because all of this stuff is great but it's only useful if you actually have your classes set up and ready to go from the dashboard so i will turn it back over to gretchen thanks hannah yeah so now we're gonna go over how to put up one or many classes using codable this is just the minute of time because i've seen there's a question about clever and google classroom so i'm gonna touch on that a little bit today um but if you do have more indepth questions about it i definitely recommend checking out our support center at support.codable.com we have a backtoschool section up at the top that uh has help articles on using google classroom using clever as well as uh how to add classes in bulk in codable if you don't use google classroom or clever um and then i also wanted to quickly say that i think there's a there's a few parents uh in the crowd today and thank you so much for showing up uh and helping your child learn about coding uh some of you are on the parent plan some of you are masquerading as teachers awesome i'm really excited we actually are looking into some options for homeschool this year it's something that we're exploring so if any of you are interested in that i uh encourage you to reach out to me i would love to talk to you learn a little bit more about what you're trying to do this school year to help try to learn um so that we can modify our parent plan for you to be the best experience so that is something that we're looking into if you reach me my email is gretchen i'm having those conversations uh this week and next week so awesome thank you okay so with that i'm going to hop into creating my first class uh so we're gonna go back to our dashboard and go to the my classes tab over here on the left and this is where you can add classes this is where you can access your class page for each individual class i have tons of classes here um so i'm just going to walk through creating a class with you so you just click add a class and i'm going to create a class name so i'm going to name my class back to school okay and if i have lots of classes that i want to add uh i'm gonna click the advanced options uh so this is where you could import with google classroom and add all of the classes at once uh if you are signed up with clever if you've already signed up with clever you'll also see a clever button here i'm not signed up with clever but that this is where it would show up um if you decide that you want to add multiple classes at once using the quotable bulk import feature you would just click this need to add multiple classes button and that would take you to the bulk import option um so i've selected a k5 pacing for my class because i want them to have access to everything all of the levels encodable however if this was say a first grade class and i want to pace codeable for them as a first grade class or with content that's appropriate for first grade class i could just select first grade and that would make everything that shows up in the game be focused on first grade it would also uh tailor the lesson plans that show up on my class page for this class to be a first grade pacing uh but i'm going to leave it open to okay to five for now i can always change that later okay i'm going to continue and here's where i can add my students so you can copy and paste these from a roster if you have it uh if you don't and you just want to skip it for now that's fine too you can add students later but i'm going to add my students great okay and here's my class code so this is what my students will use to log in to codeable4 uh to access all of the levels and to log into the game uh we generate this code for you but if you decide you want to use something that's a little bit easier for kindergarteners or first graders to remember you can always edit this later and i'll show you how to do that in just a second now i'm going to hit continue great uh so this is another option for uh sharing information with parents these are printable invitations that are customized for each student uh if you click that button it will generate them for you but for now i'm just going to skip it all right well this is my class page uh so you can access a lot of tools from here i'm not going to get too into this uh last year's last year's webinar was heavily focused on class setup and management and it's it hasn't changed so if you have questions about this i recommend checking out the 2019 webinar uh the link is in the agenda that we sent out in an email before this started i'm also going to ask for you to post the link in the chat for you right now um that is where you can find all of that all of all the information about managing your class the time stamps for everything are in the description so you can easily find what you're looking for um but i'm just going to hop over to the class settings and show you where you can edit the class code so you just go to this class code and name this is also where i can turn on picture passwords or text passwords a lot of people were asking us for passwords in the spring when remote learning first kicked off and uh we added picture passwords and text passwords for you guys so you can turn those off and on really easily and then you can also change your pacing so like i said if i was to make this a first grade uh that would change what shows up on my lessons page right here but for right now again i'm leaving it k to five all right i think that's everything for this section so i'm going to turn it over to uh hannah for some instructional tips and tools great so there's a couple tools that i will go over that are on the teacher dashboard for you to use and some of these you you may have seen before and some of these are new compared to what we had available last year um so i will start with teacher demo mode if you don't know what teacher demo mode is you can access it it's that first button on the left side menu underneath the kovid 19 resources section teacher demo mode you can play the codable game and see exactly what your students will see in the game all of the content encodable is unlocked in demo mode and there's a couple reasons why this is super helpful one is that you can demo different levels that maybe the students haven't gotten to yet but if you want to show a little teaser or prepare them for what's to come you can show them exactly what levels they might see in the game coming up you can walk through a level yourself if you want to demo or model one level and then have the kids do it at the same time maybe you're doing a screen share in zoom or if you want to show them some of the different creative options that we have the fuzz builder game designer and maze maker you can access all of these as well so demo mode is great you can get it right on your dashboard you don't need to create a different profile or anything it's in the same place that all the other resources are located so you can use teacher demo mode again to prepare yourself for lessons or to demo and model levels and activities for kids so that is the first thing you may have seen that before something that is different compared to what we had at the beginning of last year is the lesson library now we used to have a resources section at the top of this dashboard as well we have combined it with a lesson library because we wanted everything you might need to teach with codable to be in one easy to find place so the lesson library looks like this there's a couple sections the first is a get to know codable section that includes a series of videos you might recognize some of these we've gone over already but if you were to click on a video this get to know codable section you can watch this video to learn and then there's also a series of guides you can download because i know some teachers want to read instead of watch a video we have a little bit for everyone so you can download teacher guides here how to set up devices and how to introduce the fuzz family all in one place the next section you can browse resources by codable world so this is really helpful since the game is broken up into these uh different codable worlds neborg astroradia and bug world we wanted the lesson library to also be broken up in the same way so it's super easy for you to follow along each section includes a bunch of resources and i won't walk through every single one i'll just point out the different materials that we do have available so there's a teacher guide if you want to learn more about the coding content and what the kids are learning there's some learning outcomes in here as well you can do that for smeeborg at least there's answer keys we have a vocabulary page and you can also get to the student videos from these world pages as well so again it's a lot of resources you may have already seen that we've talked about in this webinar so far but all in one place and the same goes for asteroidia and for bug world we did get a question from a teacher who was asking you know what are some recommendations for using codeable with older students for like third fourth and fifth graders because a lot of our resources are geared for younger kids and i do want to point out a great way is to start with these teacher guides the content in bugrow than astroradia it can it's kind of confusing it can get a little tricky and by understanding it yourself and reading through these teacher guides you'll be better prepared to support some older students with this content that they can totally grasp but that does might like it might take a little bit more uh work and understanding and you can show them these student videos as well to get those older kids engaged and recognizing that shooting the astro the fuzz balls at the asteroids is teaching variables and values so those are some resources for that and the last section is exploring the lessons by grade and i will just show you when you click on the different grade levels it has all of our lesson plans available these are unplugged lesson plans designed for inclass collaborative use however even if you are remote teaching you can click on these lessons and modify them to fit the needs of your students a lot of them would be great for encouraging kids to get outside and do some sort of activity if that's what you're looking for and then they also include some really helpful direct instruction scripted lesson plans that you can use so even if you're not following the entire plan you can pick and choose from the lessons what pieces might be helpful for for you and your students and i wanted to show that in this lesson section you can filter and we have a lot of other subjects aside from just coding concepts that are taught with these lessons so we integrate with math english language arts robotics we have some lessons that are social studies related and science related so if you are curious about integrating codable in other subject matters definitely check out these lesson plans and explore these different subjects that we are also catering to for example if i chose ela for fifth graders there's a choose your own adventure lesson and some letter writing lessons so a great way to not just teach coding but to integrate it in other subjects as well and along with content integration and for thinking about teaching children of all different grades we do have some resources available that will help you figure out that pacing and that scope and sequence so there is a site on our codeable site you can go to which is codable.com outcomes and that link where you can share in the chat and if you haven't seen this this is our section of the website where we go over the different computer science standards that codable is meeting and that kids are learning when using codable this was developed by a big team of computer science experts and the codable team and breaks down what students are learning with codable not just related to computational thinking but also a lot of other skills like communication social emotional learning and impact all of this is on our website and you can also take a look at our scope and sequence so i linked it in the agenda that we sent out and brie can share it in the chat as well i linked this lesson planner because it breaks down the beginning is a space where you can plan some of your lessons for the year but then it also breaks down our full scope and sequence for k5 concepts so this is useful for you you can use it if you want you don't have to of course but we do show you all of the different units that we teach with codable and a breakdown for k through five what kids are learning and if you scroll down further what game levels can be used to teach each theme and unit so this is great if you want a little bit more support in terms of structuring your levels and lessons for each individual grade especially for teachers using codable with a wide range of grades not just one this is great for kind of keeping track of what levels you would want students to play to meet all of those outcomes so this is available to you again i linked it in the agenda for this webinar and i encourage you to check it out if you're looking for a little bit more support with structuring codable for multiple grade levels and i think our last section so those are the instructional tips and tools before i let gretchen wrap it up i do want to say if you have any questions about that please let me know my email is hannah codable.com and i'm happy to work with you to put together different lesson plans or a unit plan for you and your students just let me know so i will turn it back over to gretchen and she will show you what students do how they log into the game and what the game is so gretchen take it away yeah i actually just wanted to before we switched to that section hannah i wanted to address a couple of the questions that we got in our rsvp document um one of them was regarding you know how do i what questions can i ask my students to know if they're learning and um i did want to point out while you were on the lesson plans page uh where they can find the check for understanding section for every lesson because that's a really useful tool even if you're not using the lesson plans if you go to a lesson that's associated with the concept that your students are working on that week you can pull that check your understanding section out and use it either as a takehome assignment as a discussion in your room call or in your classroom and that's a great way to understand what your kids are learning from holdable another option too is to just use the uh worksheet that we created that had created to check you know how well students are retaining the information from the letters so that's i just wanted to be sure to mention that while we were on it it's great all right cool so i am going to take over and we're going to go over student login so to log students in they need to either download codable on ios or have a browser where they can log into codable.com login encodable works on any web browser so as long as they have access to a computer and internet they can get on um or if they have an ipad or an iphone at home they can use codeable for ios uh so i'm going to demonstrate how to log in on a computer uh so i'm logging in to a school profile we also have home profiles many of you i think are parents who are on a home um the difference here is that the school profile is set up to receive assignments it's set up for school use and if you are having your students learn at home you're going to want to share the class code and let them know to log in with their profile the home profile is for home memberships it's for parents who want to give their kids extra practice it has different levels than what students are playing at school it has different games and features um including like some coding challenges for extra practice it has um access to the store where they can like customize their fuzz and get use the coins that they earn to buy you know different costumes for their buzzes or decorations for fuzz topia so they're very different um but complementary so depending on what your child what kids are learning at school their parents may want to opt in to getting a home membership and that would be the home profile login but for school use we're going to use this full profile so i'm going to use my class code that has some progress already so i'm going to screen this class okay and i'm going to click on my name so for a view of what codable will look like the first time students log in i recommend using the postopia tour video uh sharing that with your students watching that to understand what postopia will look like for them the first time they log in i've played with this profile already so everything is unlocked um so this is what topia will eventually look like but to see what that unlocking and that first experience is like i would i definitely recommend that video uh that we shared earlier um but i'm just gonna hop right into it so flustopia has a lot of different places where your students can explore uh there's maze maker where they can create their own maze levels and practice using sequencing conditions loops and functions there's game designer where they can create their own games using ascorbia variables and properties there's a builder where they can hold their own characters and they are exploring what javascript and swift look like uh and then there are some other sections that students have access to at home uh to you know play more levels uh and then we have here the videos tab this is where students will see the videos that you assigned to them from your teacher dashboard and the video view here in order that they were assigned so this was the most recently assigned video on june 23rd for my class i assigned a video on loops so it shows up at the top if i was to assign one today it would show up above this one so it's going to shut the most recent is going to show up at the top there's also a tab for all videos and this is where students can kind of explore on their own if they want to find videos that are helpful for what they're learning at the moment they can hop over here and see all of the videos and sort by concept i wouldn't recommend that for your younger students but for some of your older students who can do you know directed learning selfdirected learning i think that's a good option okay so i'm gonna hop back into the game and i'm going to show mission control so mission control is where your students jump off into all of the different games that are assigned from your teacher dashboard this is where you can direct them uh to find their assignments so the first world that most of your students will start with is sneeborg and maborg is focused on programming logic and um some of the problem solving skills that are important for learning to code there's no text so it's all symbolbased it's great for your kind of learners but it's also useful for your older students to uh start with so that they have a solid foundation before they hop into any textbased coding students are going to learn about sequencing conditions loops and functions the next is australia is for probably you know your third and fourth grade students this is their first transition into code we start introducing what variables are what they look like in conjunction with the videos it's a really helpful place for them to start being familiar with what code looks like and how javascript is used uh in astroradio they're matching different fuzzballs with different properties to the matching asteroids to clear the asteroid field and then we have bug world which is for our fourth and fifth grade students this is where we're starting to introduce them to object oriented programming students are battling the slimes of the world and defending the buzz family with their hero defenders they can modify the properties and the objects that are used in this game to basically win the game and the last world is beach cleanup this is our hour food event last year and it was so popular uh it's appropriate for all ages k5 they can't customize the difficulty so they can choose if they want it to be easy medium or hard in there they can practice sequencing conditions loops and functions and kids can draw their own maze and then they have them to pick up trash on the beach and then they have to program their way through that maze that they just and the last thing that i want to point out here is the quick play button a lot of you asked for this it used to be encodable and it disappeared and now it's made a return because backed by popular demand um we have he added the quick play button so the quick play button just does exactly what it says it goes directly to the last level that your student was on so it's easy for them to quickly get back to the level they were on or quickly get to the assigned levels without having to navigate through all the different menus okay and with that i am going to switch to our q a section um so if you have any questions about anything that we've covered so far please post that in the chat uh but i'm gonna go ahead and answer some of the questions that we had over oh sorry lost my notebook okay i gotta answer some of the questions that we had in the rsvp link uh that we didn't have time to answer here so um i'm just going to quickly go over those um so i've covered what devices portable is accessible on ipads and computer browser another question that we have is what will be accessible to schools who do not have a technology budget this year and that's really important we didn't want to cover that so uh the free version of portable includes the first two sets of levels in each unit so if you think about sequence it's going to have the first two sets of levels in that unit available for free as well as the first lesson plan in that unit um and that's true for all political units however uh to help to help the schools that are kind of struggling due to changes caused by the pandemic we are offering access to all lessons in the lesson library through december of this year so through december of 2020. um it does not include levels in the game but it does include all teaching materials all lesson plans and videos in the lesson library you will have access to those through the end of this calendar year here um what kind of questions can i ask my kids to find out what they're learning from the material oh because i thought already uh how do i assign codable to your google classroom so i talked about this a little bit i definitely recommend checking out our support center but assigning through portable is simple in the classroom we do have a health article in our support center for that um when you add i do want to point out though that when you add students using the group of classroom import it's not a twoway integration so when you do it make sure that everything's in there because if you make any changes to your google classroom after that's been done you have to redo the import it doesn't automatically change when you make changes in google classroom um gretchen can i add one thing about the google classroom question great so yeah like gretchen mentioned you can use google classroom to add your students to codable super easy and that integration will add them you click a button and it'll happen automatically in terms of assigning codable levels through google classroom and that will look like in google classroom when you have that assignments or like the classwork section um you can post the link to codeablecodable.com login or i actually might gretchen will you share my screen really quick so i can show this um in your on your teacher dashboard you can select your class so i'm on the dashboard i'm clicking on my classes you can select your class and at the top it says class code this is the class code that i set up for this class if i click this it will automatically open up my roster i can copy this url and post this to google classroom that way when my kids log into their google classroom all they need to do is click this link it will open up this page automatically they don't need to enter their class code this will pop up automatically and then they can choose their name so in terms of assigning through google classroom that is probably the easiest way to do it it's just a one click for your students and they'll be brought immediately to their roster they just need to find their name to log in awesome thank you yeah um okay and then the next question is similar if students use codable last year and log them through clever how do i move them to their new class and new teacher will it resync automatically i it might not resync automatically it depends on if you are on a paid version of portable or not but if you want to do the sync manually just log into your codable dashboard and click the sync with clever button on the my classes page and that will start the same thing and make sure that all of your students are in the correct class uh and free if you could link to that support article in the chat that would be helpful okay awesome so the see i think that free is handling all the questions in the chat but um someone didn't ask what is the best practice having kids start over eat here or moving them to a new class and keeping their progress and um it really is up to you you can transfer students for this thing will be clever or you can actually we have a transfer option uh within codable as well you can transfer students and their progress will stay with you but we do recommend starting them over each year if you are wanting to manage what they're doing in potable if it's a free play scenario in your classroom that's totally fine i would recommend making their progress because kids love all the things that they create but if you happen to be you know trying to structure your lessons following a certain pacing it is fine to start them over from where they need to be each year let me see if there's any questions oh this is a good one okay so um luke asked if we archive or delete a class do children still have access to the projects that they have made and the answer is no uh if the class is deleted it's gone so the students won't be able to log in the class code will no longer work and their progress will no longer be incredible it looks like stephanie wrote does the ipad app have access to the same content as playing on the website i can see yeah where that confusion might come from yes it is exactly the same product so if you click log in with the school profile on the ipad app or log in with a school profile on the website it will look exactly the same and they will have access to the same content playing on either platform um let's see here oh claire asked about our social channels so you can follow us on facebook and twitter we love having you guys apart so you're always sharing new things here we actually have a new member of the codable team who's going to be working on all of our social channels and you're going to start to see and hear from her more names maria she just joined this week ago maria she's watching right now um but that's who you'll be talking to if you chat with us on social um and yeah so please feel free to follow us on facebook twitter and instagram our handle is at codable on all of those channels uh we also just started a uh seesaw page and are posting activities there so if you're looking for some seesaw activities that use codable uh check out our blog there's a page there with all of our seesaw activities um and then the last channel to definitely mention is our youtube channel because hannah has done hannah has done a great job of making our youtube the hub for all things video so like if you're looking for a video to teach your students about anything incredible you can probably find it on our youtube channel just subscribe to our channel and you'll get notifications when we post new things there totally and i will add at the bottom of the covid19 resources page on your teacher dashboard i didn't show it when i was going through my demo but there is a button to click that says are we missing anything are you looking for anything that we don't have if you know that your students would really benefit from a certain type of video i'm making them almost every week and i'm happy to take suggestions so if you have a topic idea for a video that you're looking for please feel free to fill out that form you can find it exactly on the covet 19 resources page and i will take a look and connect with you if it seems like something that other teachers would benefit from great i'm going to cover a couple of more questions that we got from our rcp page so how do you handle teaching remotely to kids who are way ahead of others in class so i think with all of the different tools that we've shared today it might be a little bit easier to do this differently than it was in the classroom uh so if you want to move all of your allstars to a separate codeable class and then assign advanced videos and levels to them that would be my recommendation so that any students who are ready for more challenging content would have their own class code and log in and they would be able to access it all from home at their own pace hannah do you have anything to add for your arena yeah i was just going to add that i i showed the concept videos the explain concept videos on the dashboard the other section of that was the create videos and sort of what gretchen was saying um if you were to create if you if let's say half your class is moving at a much faster pace than the other half you could create two classes and then for the class that's moving ahead if you don't want them to do more game levels but you still want them to have meaningful experiences with codable you could assign them one of those creative videos they're basically mini challenges we call them coding missions and a lot of them use the uh the creative activities encodable the fuzz builder the maze maker and the game designer and those never expire you can kids can create as many projects as they want in using those platforms so that's one option you could have those kids that are moving ahead do kind of an openended creative project as you have some of the other students playing the levels and catching up so yeah gretchen's just showing how there were the explained videos on the left and the create videos on the right um there's eight coding missions so far but i'm creating more all the time and again they're like short four minute mini challenges um some of them are unplugged some of them are plugged in so that's a great way to keep kids engaged if they're moving in the levels faster they can do an activity to kind of pump the brakes and and fill the time there yeah so to kind of add on to that you know suggested structure that hannah mentioned earlier about finding the video to introduce the concept if you wanted to assign say you were covering functions that week you could assign the introduction to functions and then you could also assign this fashionable functions coding mission video that is for kids who have extra time so if they move ahead and they're ready for something more challenging uh that is functions related then you could assign this video to them oh and i will say for the parents that are watching the families that are watching these videos the coding missions and the concept videos um also show up onto your parent dashboard so and they're free on our youtube channel as well so these are not just for teachers these can be used by anybody who wants a little extra activity or explanation for the coding concept feel free to use these whether you're a teacher or a parent or both definitely okay and then we have a couple more questions here oh i love this question this is the last question we have from the rctv how can i teach coding outdoors without computers and i love this in any scenario but it sounds like it might be instruction which is sounds great um if you're in person take a look at the lesson library every single lesson plan includes an unplugged portion that is perfect for instruction outside without computers so all of the lesson plans that hannah was showing from the lesson library have a guided guided practice section and that is meant to be unplugged it may be a collaborative activity or it might be a worksheet it might have kids you know doing some sort of a obstacle course there's lots of different things that we have there getting them to move and think um about computer science in the way that it relates to them with the world around them not just on computers okay so that's all of our questions that we have prepared in advance are there any questions from anyone in the chat we've had a couple more minutes it looks like brie is a superhero in that chat right now and it looks like she's covering most of them so thank you yes thank you so much oh this is an inch this is a good one and it's probably a good one to point out right now so i teach portable as a parent to my sixyearold is there a live chatbot or support system if they're stuck with a problem we do not have a live chatbot um although we do have a support we we all do support it codeable we have a support uh channel where you can reach out to us but for kids we don't recommend that it's not set up for us to answer their questions however we have added a hint system into smeaboard using fuzzbuzz this fairy fuzz that helpful she likes to fly in and get hints if they need it uh and there's a she'll hold a little question mark sign on the side of the level if they've been inactive for a little bit of time and they can tap on i like to leave it up to kids sometimes they're just thinking and they don't need a hint but sometimes they do um so she will fly in and give a hint to your child uh or your students if they need it um introduced this i hope you have any feedback about the way that kids are getting would love it um you can always reach out to us with that feedback at supportable.com and that's where you can reach out to any of us if you have questions after this webinar is over all right i think that i haven't seen any questions pop up i think degree hannah has most of them she's an allstar um but if you do like i said if you guys have any questions about the fact please reach out to us um and we're looking forward to the school year yeah thank you so much for joining us and yeah feel free to reach out with any other questions we are here to support you all right thanks everyone bye bye
