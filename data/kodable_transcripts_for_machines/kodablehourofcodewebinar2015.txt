alright so right here I'm Gretchen this is mike o'connor john and we just wanted to quickly go over what the hour of code is if you guys so that um if you have any questions or if you are not sure what's happening or if this is your first time we can answer all those questions for you so just going to quickly go over everything that you would need to know if you wanted to do an hour of code with Kota Bowl um and then we'll have questions probably somewhere in the middle and then at the end um all right so I'm just gonna tell you guys a little bit about what the hour of code is and why it's important so the hour of code is an event that was organized by Cobourg and CSI week as an opportunity to promote computer science to kids all around the world they want to get as many kids as possible to try at least one hour of code I'm sure that you all know the incredible demand for technical talent people who understand programming who can program or who just can you know use technology successfully so that is the that's the purpose at the hour of code to get more kids aware of what computer science is and why it's important and how it can how they can use it to make change in their communities and in the world so um it's during the second week of December every year to honor grace hopper who was an incredible computer scientist she invented the first compiler which makes it possible for us to program using programming languages she was also the first person to have a bug in her in a program and that was because there was an actual moth in her computer haha so she she coined the term bug um so yeah that's a little bit of fun a little bit of a fun thing to talk with students about so i can share later the link to information about her she's pretty awesome she was an admiral in the US Navy so if you're going to be using co double then it's important to get prepared so I'm going to go over a little bit about everything you should do to prepare for the hour of code and this is in general if you're using anything it'll probably be helpful to do some of these things and then we'll go over what to do during the hour of code know as the events happening what to expect and then if you want to go beyond one hour with your students if you're planning on doing more stuff with your kids later um next semester or even next school year we'll go over some of the stuff that you can do with co double there too so I'm here's the link real quick to Grace Hopper should be able to see it on the side of your screen ok um show item alright great so first we'll go over Kota bowl I'm so quotable is programming curriculum for elementary schools and this year we're doing something we've never done before we're providing lesson plans to everybody great specific lesson plans for the hour of code for free you do not need an account to use these you do not need to pay to use these they're completely free um predominantly unplugged so there's a lot of unplugged options for you this year so i'll go ahead and show you that um real quickly so you can see what they look like um so here are where you can find our lesson plans its code will accomplish our code / lessons and I'll share this link as well but you can see we have K through 5 lesson plans available it's all basically the same but we've scaled it up what lessons you're actually what concepts you're actually covering for each grade level all of these lesson plans can be done in about an hour so you can cut things out if you have a little bit less time but that's building in time for some independent practice on the devices so if you don't have device then you can automatically cut out 10 minutes um so it's pretty fun it's a fun activity where you um get the kids together and you talk about what a programmer is and why they're important and what they do with giving you a lot of that information here and then you have to program someone in the room usually it's helpful if it's an adult because you can tell them ahead of time what they need to do how they need to act as a robot but the students program then to do something so in this activity it's a walk forward turn around and jump and you have to you have to program them to do this and we give you some code in order to do it and and you talk with the students about why that code is important and so it really builds up their understanding of what programming is it gives them a nice real world example a tangible example which is great for I know a lot of you guys mentioned that you're doing this with kindergarteners um it's great for you know pre readers kindergarteners it's nice for them to have like a tangible example of what they're going to be doing um and then after you're finished you can check for understanding and have them go do a little bit of programming on their own on their devices um and like I said there's lesson plans for kindergarten first grade second grade third grade fourth grade fifth grade each of them is slightly different if you have kids who are pretty experience with programming if you guys have been doing this for a while um just jump up probably to the next grade level you know best what's appropriate for your student so I'm just take a look at all of them and decide what you think your students can handle um if you're working with some of you said you were working with middle school students our fifth grade lesson plan is pretty it covers quite a bit so I think that this would easily scale up for sixth and seventh grade students once you're getting into 8th 9th takes you know high school age um then I'm not so sure if you could do it if it's their very first introduction then yeah I think that it would probably be appropriate um so co double is a available desktop iPad web and Android it works on Safari Chrome Internet Explorer Firefox you have to have pretty new versions of these browsers in order for it to work correctly um you need OS X 1.8 at 10.8 sorry Tim point 8 or higher in Windows 7 or higher and then for Android it's 2.3 and iOS is six point 0 or higher um yeah so that's a little bit about the devices um and i'll go ahead and share the activities for you hiya John was saying I've got my nice watch outfit on I'm going to be the Lord Commander you Jon Snow my fur okay so there's that link okay now a few of you are asking questions about whether or not to set up a class and um if that if you think that that would be if we thought that that would be necessary for you for the our code it really depends on what you're trying to do afterward so you think that you are going to be doing a lot of coding after the hour of code if you're planning on making this like a you know something that you do somewhat regularly at your school then I would definitely recommend setting up a class it's just going to make your life a whole lot easier afterward I know that it's a little bit of work up front but it's going to make things a whole lot easier for you so um what you need in order to do that is just a roster of all of your students um it takes just two or three minutes to set up one class you can copy and paste from your roster it's real simple and then after that all the kids need is that class code you can make it whatever you want and they can log in using that class code you can also if you're using the web version you can also bookmark that you have a unique URL so that makes it really easy for the students to get logged in I can actually i'll just show you really quickly how you logged in with a class and then how you would get logged in without a class so the hour of code you're going to want to go to game notable calm our dash of the hash code um if you are not using a class you will play without saving and that just automatically creates an anonymous user you can the kids can play there's like literally no setup um they can hit save and exit and get this student code but you will have to write it down and enter it next time if you want to continue where you left off um if you want to if you want to play with a class code or student code play with class code or student code and then enter the class code and this works the same on the iPad except on the iPad you can save the class code so you don't have to enter it every time here we go so you can see here my students um you just tap that will tap their name on the iPad or they or Android click their name if they're using the web version and then they can continue if you just hit the spaceship it takes you directly to where you left off so it was really nice if you're planning on doing any coding after the hour of code that um you know if you come back after the holiday break and you're ready to get started some of the kids won't remember is that where they were they can just hit play and they'll be safe like all their progress will be saved you'll be able to view their progress on our dashboard there's a lot of extra benefits if this is just a onetime thing that I definitely recommend using just a local profile on your student devices on the iPads or Android devices or just using the play without saving on the web version it will just be super simple for you oh yeah um can you go back to the class overview page listen yeah I just wanted to let everyone know that you could actually bookmark that URL the Garrett calm / class / famous glass for your classes instead of famous class you'll see your class code there but if you're using if you're working with younger kids in kindergarten first grade and they might have trouble typing in their class code you can bookmark those URLs for the students and then if you go there directly you'll immediately get to their class roster and they'll be able to click on their name so you can see there's my famous class now and I can just come directly here um spell yeah that's super simple to if you're using a class code um here's all right um oh I also wanted to let you all know if you're planning on um some things that you want to do if you're getting prepared ahead of time um we have certificates also for students so i'll share that link as well so that when everybody finishes you can just you know sign their names and they've completed an hour of code and that they know I've done an hour of programming their programmers now it's a lot of fun it's all share a link to that as well um but yeah that's a little bit about setting up a class vs not setting up a class it's really your choice we made it pretty easy to do either option it's just a little bit more work if you want to do it ahead of time but it will save you in the long run if you want to not set up a class and then import students you can do that like after say you try this out and then later on you want to continue with it you can have those student codes you write down and you can import them but it gets a little bit tedious you did know think about just doing that for 25 students so be kind of a pain but um but yeah saving saving you a little bit of time is doing a little bit of work up front so um I guess I'm gonna see if we've got any questions on Twitter um no it doesn't look like it you guys can also add questions on the side here so we have questions okay what is a quick way to bookmark when using iPad so if you are going to be using co double on an iPad um i would suggest well you have to download the app in order to use it um so then just go over with students before you get started what the icon looks like um it's the same as our Google+ and YouTube and all of our social media icons it's just a gold square where the blue fuzz on the front um go over that with students say okay whatever we're going to go to go to this one this is co dab'll then that that makes it really easy to know exactly where to go on the iPad if you do set up a class then once you enter that class code one time it'll be saved on the iPad so you never have to enter it again they just go over what your class name is um you can make it whatever you want say you can always make it something that the students will remember they just tap on that and then they tap their name very similar to what happens on the web version um and okay got it I selected this question no it's answered okay oh that is here's your question Valerie if it doesn't let me know okay um so if anybody else has questions feel free to put them here I'm happy to answer them um so let's go over a little bit of where to get the different versions of koda bolt so we have an hour of code page setup where you can find all of the stuff that I'm sharing here um go ahead and share that it's co double com / our dash of dash code and that has all of this it has links to download everything um it has links to the web version it has linked to our unplugged activities as links to the what up to the certificate and to our lesson plans so you can find everything that you need here i'll go ahead and show it to you real quick alright so you can see a lesson plans page alright hour of code um so here's where kids can get started I think it's probably easier for you less distractions on this page if you just bookmark the page that we talked about game not co double calm um but you can also have them play here it'll take them directly to it um and then this is where you can find the lesson plans and here's where you can find where to download or set up everything so we better pc version mac web ipad android and unplugged um you can share quotable and then here's a link to these certificates to download for your students and this is co double calm / hour of codes i just shared it on the side here um so that's just about everything you need in order to get set up um if you if you have any questions feel free to post them on the side here um okay good great alright so let's see during the day up so one thing to consider if you're planning an hour of code for no matter what you're planning on using what it's quotable anything else um code.org might find anything i would definitely recommend having a plan B so everybody's servers get hit pretty hard um but everyone servers get hit pretty hard and so there might be a little bit of spotty service ours are set up in a way that is very very unlikely for you to see any issues with loading times or anything like that um we scale it pretty well so I don't expect to have any trouble if you're using the eye version on the android version or the desktop version that's irrelevant there will be any issues with Internet connectivity there and if you you asked about saving progress on those versions you'd actually don't need internet to use them um it'll just save eventually like the next time yeah the device connects to the Internet it'll save their progress up that way so there's no need to have internet for those versions for the web version obviously you have to have the Internet um but yeah there shouldn't be any trouble with with our servers that did that week but it's always important to have a plan B so um we have quite a few i plug lesson plans available we have the fuzz family frenzy which is a lot of fun you have kids pick a partner so after you go over like what a programmer is and you program someone at front of the room together and then you can have them break up into pairs and they have to program a partner to go through an obstacle course some people have used toilet paper to set up mazes in their gym which is really cool idea people have just had them go from one end of the classroom to the other some people go out to the playground and have them hula hoop and it's just a lot of fun you can use whatever resources you have available around you um but uh but that's a really good resource salt be sure to share that with you guys um and this is in our curriculum as well as if you have Co dab'll um you have access to this on your teacher dashboard also it's the fuzz family friends e so this is a really good plan B if anything goes wrong or say like one of your devices just decides not to work um that day that happens just have a plan B no matter what it is even if it's not the fuzz family frenzy have a plan B just in case things go awry because it always happens something always comes up okay um alright so that's pretty much it from get being prepared um if anybody has question like I said you can ask them on the side here or on Kota bowl at credible um on Twitter so let's go over a little bit of what to expect a lot of you said that this is your first time doing hour of code not really sure what to expect uh well it's a lot of fun just expect to have a lot of fun expect to get a lot of questions from your students about you know what a programmer is and and they'll be very interested in games like that that's like the only thing you can do to program you can you know talk with them a little bit about some of the other things that we program I always like to use the example of airplanes because a lot of people don't let of kids and some adults don't realize that there are computers and airplanes I hope pilots fly just examples like that that are real things that they don't they maybe not might not make a connection to the fact that a person has to program it um that's just a nice way to help them see the the broader appeal of programming um and then just you know expect for there to be some issues with technology we all have issues of Technology from time to time so that's why it's important to have a plan B um and just have fun it's a really exciting time be sure to read through everything ahead of time so you know you know you feel confident and prepared but really there's a lot there's not a lot you need to do or need to worry about knowing ahead of time it's it's a really good time to you know just explore and learn with your students um it's a lot of fun I would suggest um having an administrator or another teacher anybody who you feel might be interested in programming or getting more coding at your school have them come by and have them participate because it'll really be nice to be able to talk with them about it later and see about you know how you can do more of these types of things at your school um and so if they see the engagement if they see what happens during the hour of code and how excited kids get and how how much fun it is and how everybody's smiling and having fun and learning all at the same time um that'll be very very powerful later on so I would definitely do all you can to get other parents administrators or other teachers involved and you're going to need a couple extra hands too with that many devices around sure most of you know that so um if you're if you're planning to have an hour code event trying to get parents and administrators and other teachers to come it'll be a lot of fun as usual we get I wanted Activision with technology and then problems that arise make sure you set up code ago added the class codes before the day of because a lot of times we find teachers will will add the class code the day of and realized i forgot their class code and then they've got to go sign in and they're going to find it the best way to do it if you're using co double on an iOS app or as an Android app or on the web entering figure out where your class codes are under the men bookmark those URLs download the classes on the iPad and then all you have to do is we've taken a lot of pains to make it as easy as possible to sign in for kids especially young kids it's I think two or three taps to get a kindergartener into in dakota blue and actually playing usually to make sure that this setup has been done beforehand because if you're trying to get 30 kindergarteners to enter in class codes the day out i'm sure you know it's a little a little stressful that's true yeah definitely but you do have the freedom to make the class code anything you want so if you if you make it something that's really easy like the room number or the name of their school um then then it's pretty easy to get them signed in week out kindergarteners I would I would set it up ahead of time um alright I don't see any questions on Twitter um anybody know alright great so um the next thing that I wanted to go over is on during the lesson so a lot of people asked about whether or not to just get the kids devices and just let them go and I think it's a common misconception that because you're programming you have to have a device in your hand you have to be you have to have technology which makes sense right with program computers but I think it's really important and our curriculum set up this way um I think over half of it is off screen because it's really important to go over a concept and make sure the kids are understanding it a little bit ahead of time just talk a little bit about what the book kept you know talk a little bit about the vocabulary talk about what a programmer is talk about why we need program what is this concept that we're actually learning if you include all of that in the lesson plan so do a little bit of instruction ahead of time so that they know what they're doing and why it's relevant um it's fun you know they're obviously gonna have all gonna have a lot of fun um but it is important to make sure that they make the connection with what they're having fun with and what they're learning uh so so yes I would plan to do a little bit of instruction with them um a few people asked about switching classes so if you have lots of classes coming back and forth or in and out really quickly make sure to have kids log out in the ipad app we had a lot of log out buttons on the pause screen on the main screen or if you just double tap and swipe up on the home button um that will that will log out students so if you can have them all do that before they switch you know like five minutes before it's time to switch just tell the model log out and that will give you once everyone's done if you have a little bit of extra time you can ask some questions about what they learned um and that way when the next group of kids come in everyone's logged out and they can just sign in on their on their profile or create a new one however you're doing it um yeah so that's that's pretty much it for preparation and during the event um and then I wanted to go over after what happens after the our code why are we doing this what what do we what should I expect after this huge event is over what well I think that a lot of people use the hour of code is an opportunity to experiment and decide whether programming is something that they want to do more of at their school so you're not alone there's just about everybody who uses Kota Bowl found out about it during the hour of code and have been using it ever since so um we've set it up to be pretty easy to continue on with it if you do set up classes like I said that's the that's the easiest thing to do if you're playing go on afterward you can view all of our free lesson plans um from your teacher dashboard i'll go ahead and show you that really quickly how to find that so if you go to dashboard code will calm you can log in this is where you login to create your classes and everything um this is what it looks like to create a new class it's very simple um but after the hour of code you can actually go and view all of your students progress you can see what your students completed this class doesn't have any progress you can see what your what concepts your students were learning um who is in progress and who hasn't completed anything you can you can learn a lot about where students are and what you might need to go over a little bit um and then if you want to you can actually go and view our curriculum and set it up and go a little bit more in depth so we have three units for sequence um four units for condition so it's a pretty it's a pretty hefty um thing to get into I'm so go ahead and take a look at it and decide if it's something that you want to go a little bit further with I love this stuff is for a subsequence conditions are both free and then strings which is part of our third grade curriculum is free as well so all of this our curriculum goes k25 so it's something that your school is considering then you can browse through all of this stuff or four and get an idea if it's right for you um say our code is a great way to get started with that um yeah so and then like I said if you're planning to go beyond an hour of code with with programming or wisco tible then having an administrator or a parent or another teacher come with you to the to the first initial you know event the hour of code um having them come and see all of this will really be powerful in making the extra effort to integrate it into fringe lemon to make time for it and you'll just have an ally somebody who has seen the power of what you're trying to do and who can be your teammate and making sure that it all happens and and can do what it takes to make it happen at your school so so yeah um that's pretty much it um got another question oh sure I had one someone was asking if you needed to create your class through the app or if it's done on the website it is that is done through the website so it makes it just makes it really easy um to copy and paste and stuff you can't really do that very easily multitasking is not simple on the icon so yes you have to create it on on the on the website um code volcom in it you can show you where you get signed up you just go to co double calm and and click get started i sign up as a parent or a teacher um that's all it takes it's really simple to get signed in and get started so and then once you have set up your account um once you've set up your account that's all you really need to do on the website you can view the curriculum materials and stuff and you contracts you to progress but all of the actual you know what the students do um that's done through the the web version game code welkom or through the ipad app and that's where they that's sort of their window into kota bowl but there's so much more that's just the tip of the iceberg uh yeah so that's that's just about every things anybody help us some questions I will leave it open for a couple more minutes to see if there's any questions that I didn't answer doo doo doo doo doo doo de doo doo um we're friends Davis said well played co double going webbased and downloadable for hour of code thank you thank you John think about there's a lot of work involved and getting those things out there so we appreciate it um I didn't want to go over playlist while we're waiting for questions to come in I'm just really quickly you can actually set up playlist if you have an account with potable you can set up a playlist that lets you stop students at a certain point so if you're planning on going further later on they will fly through stuff you know kids love games um they'll just keep going and keep going we'll go and download it at home and and then if you were planning lessons you're like oh I have nothing left they've already done it all well you want to make sure that you're doing lessons with them so that they're actually understanding a lot of this stuff and making the connections from the concepts in the game into programming um and so if you're planning on doing that it's nice test set up a playlist and you can set a stopping point for your students um it's really simple i'll go ahead and show you how to do that real quick um i don't see so I'm just gonna go to playlist and it can see I've got my default this is what everybody has when they first sign up for Kota bowl um it's just with everything open and I've created some new ones you can create a new one and just use the default of the template but then once you click on it you can see all of the lessons in co double so this is all of everything all of the different units so right now I've got conditions fuzzy Fiesta hidden for my students so this does not appear on their devices at all I wanted them to skip it i didn't want them to do it so I hid it from them um if I wanted to stop them so what I would suggest feed our code is stopping students before they get to conditions because you want to go over conditions if you can um I would stop them here and I'm going to suck them at the end of debugging secrets um and then still they'll be able to get through all 15 of these levels and then they'll be stopped and they'll get a notification saying that they've been stopped and then that gives you the opportunity to go over things a little bit more so that's a playlist out if you wanted to you could set up one for the our code call it the hour of code you can make as many as you want there's no limit oh and then want to thought there is no limit on classes or students either anymore for free plans the only thing that you're limited to is what curriculum and lessons you have excess access to um so if you have a large school that's want to use it you can go ahead and add them all okay um so Valerie asked if we could through the app and just show you how it works really quickly that's a great suggestion um I can't believe I didn't think about doing that so we'll do that really quickly all right um so I'm going to enter my class code Katniss is my favorite so I'm gonna play as Katniss she's a really good programmer all right and I'm gonna take you all to the very first lesson um so that you can see it so here we've got sequence um oh and actually i'll show you so you know how I I stopped my students after sequence at the end of it you can see conditions is actually your teachers lock this so now they can't they can see it but they just can't get to it um so we'll start at the very first level so we want our fuzz so fuzz's our furry aliens who were exploring space and their UFO crash on this planet called Smee Borg and Smee Borg is covered with mazes and so your students have to program these fuzz's to go through the mazes because buses love to explore they're very very curious so you just drag and drop the commands so we're first we're going to go forward and we're gonna go down and then we're going to go right and then you press play and so your character will roll until they hit a wall alright so it gets um pretty advanced pretty quickly um especially for kindergartners but we've added a lot more extra are a lot of extra see once this concept right here sequence basically just putting things in order to do to do perform at perform an action so we want to get to the end of this maze that's the action that we want to perform so we're going to go um right up right up right and this would be our program so this is our code and with older students you can get into things like conditions loops functions we do that we have that included in our interest in our lesson plans you talked about it a little bit loops and functions are part of the paved portion of kota bowl though so they won't be able to practice it in the game but they can't practice conditions if they want to so that's a little bit about the game Thank some of this here we go all right hope that covers it there's more that you want to see let me know um covered this one Joanie asked about do we need to do it on the app or on the website for creating a class it's the website so that's good um see okay it doesn't look like we have any questions on Twitter um last chance if you have questions i'll type them in I'm going to hang out for another minute or so but I think think we just about covered everything so um if you have more questions feel free to email me or John our email address is Gretchen or John our name atco double com or you can tweet at us at coda bowl we're happy to answer any questions oh we're pretty quick to respond most of the time so if you need anything feel free to ask us as your getting prepared um so thank you everybody is really enjoyed I enjoyed this I always enjoy talking about programming um and I hope you all have a wonderful our code and enjoy it have fun lynn MA
