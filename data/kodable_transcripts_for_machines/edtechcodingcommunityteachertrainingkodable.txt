how to ask questions and get ideas from other teachers before i begin i realized i don't have a slide for this but i did want to mention it if there's a coding or a stem program that you're curious about like codable or scratch and before you start you you would love to talk to a teacher who's already using it just to see how they're doing it and to learn a little bit more about the practical application i would recommend reaching out to somebody on that team somebody who works on the product like a customer service rep or somebody at the company i can speak from codables experience we have teachers all over the world using codable in a wide variety of educational environments and we would love to connect you with a teacher who is also using that also using codable or whatever program in a similar way to offer insights or to answer questions since they would be able to know some of the ins and outs better than we would since they have a similar teaching experience so that's just one thing i wanted to mention if you have specific questions about a program see if they can't connect you with a teacher who is also using that program i think it's a really nice way to learn okay so two ways to get involved and to get some of your questions answered are webinars and conferences these are two webinars that we love but there are a ton out there that one on the bottom that's computer science for rhode island those are not just rhode island themed webinars they just have a nice section on their website that maps out some free webinars that are coming up that you might be interested in signing up for and then as i mentioned at the beginning we have a couple webinars through codable happening next week on tuesday and then again in october and hopefully we can offer um a lot more in the future as well and then conferences are an option they're a little bit more intensive because you are putting time aside to attend sometimes there is cost involved but it is a great place to meet with likeminded teachers and admin and learn about programs that you didn't even know existed so those are two options to start and then social media is really alive with stem and coding communities they're super active and these are two on facebook that we that we love and then a couple of our favorite instagram influencers stem influencers i mean they're a great place to get ideas like project ideas or classroom ideas and i know that many are really willing to connect and chat i mean they are teachers and parents just like you so that's one other place to go for for quick inspiration if you are interested in learning more about what coding might look like in different classrooms and actually see real pictures and videos from their work
