gracie fuzz is working on a puzzle but she needs your help she's looking for a piece that will fit right here can you help her which of these puzzle pieces do you think will fit when solving a problem like this try breaking it down into a series of steps first think about the problem a puzzle piece is missing and we need to figure out which one it is then make a hypothesis based on the information in front of you and what you already know about puzzles choose the one you think will work best you likely know that for a puzzle piece to fit both the shape and color need to match the pieces around it this one appears to have the correct color but it's the wrong shape this one looks to have the right shape but it's the wrong color how about this one it seems to be the right shape and the right color then test it out place the puzzle piece and observe the results it's a perfect fit in programming when two things have the same value it's called equality this double equal sign is known as the equality operator it's kind of like your own personal detective who works double time to check whether the value of the thing on the left side of the double equal sign is the same as the value on the right once the operator does its check it will return a value of true or false if the values are equal then the result is true if the values are not equal then the result is false true and false are boolean values and a computer uses booleans to help make decisions about what to do next here's an example you might have seen in real life think about a computer program that controls whether or not you can unlock a smartphone the program would say something like if you enter the correct password then you can log in this is a conditional statement you can only log in if this condition is true so how does your device know if a password attempt is correct when you type in your password the program will compare it with your stored password using the trusted equality operator the operator will check to see if the two values are equal if the entered password and the stored password are not equal then the result is false and you can't log in but if the operator finds that the two values are equal then the result is true and then you go now you can see how equality booleans and conditions all work together to control how a program behaves and when certain things can happen let's look at how equality works in codable in order for our fuzz to reach the end of the maze it needs to be able to roll through this tunnel but the tunnel door is closed we are looking for the right key that will open the door let's try coding our fuzz to roll through the maze and pick up a key along the way uhoh the key our fuzz collects must have a shape value and color value that are equal to the shape and color on the tunnel pink circle and orange diamond are not equal so the tunnel door stays closed let's try again this time we'll code our fuzz to collect the orange diamond key orange diamond is equal to orange diamond the tunnel door opens and our fuzz can roll through happy coding
