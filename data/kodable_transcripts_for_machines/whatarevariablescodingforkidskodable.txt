computer programs contain a lot of information think about some of the games you love to play the code that makes up the program for a game needs to include instructions for everything the player sees and does this would include the setting characters colors objects and interactions just like in a story or a movie scene all of this information is stored in the game code for most games like asteroid Eoin codable almost everything you see is a variable a variable is something that can change or vary so it makes sense that a game would be made up of a bunch of variables right without them nothing would ever change and playing the game would be really boring so what exactly is a variable you can think of a variable like a container that holds information the information or data stored in a variable is called the value let's say you are thirsty so you grab a cup from your cupboard the cup is clear glass and you can see that it is empty you fill the cup up with water now the cup looks like it has changed the color is blue however the cup itself is not different at all it is simply the storage container for the liquid you chose to put in it you can fill it up with lemonade or orange juice or any other liquid and it still won't change the cup itself in this example your cup acts just like a variable and the liquid you put into it is a value so we know variables can hold all different kinds of values just like a cup can store lots of different kinds of liquids encoding we can label a variable based on the type of value that it stores just like you could label the cup based on the liquids inside in programming there are many different types of values that can be stored in a variable button codable we focus on three strings integers and arrays let's break these down really quick some variables can store values that are characters or words called strings strings are everywhere in games from names to instructions to colors anything described with letters if a variable is assigned a string value we can label it a string variable in codable we use colored fuzz balls to represent string variables some variables can store number values called integers in a game these would be helpful for determining volume difficulty or speed these number values are stored in an integer variable in codable we use numbered fuzz balls to represent integers the final type of variable encode abaut is an array this type of variable stores both integers and strings in an ordered list in codable arrays are shown with these brackets and can store both the colored and numbered fuzz balls in sequence remember variables store values that don't have to be permanent just like liquids in a cup the value can change or vary but the variable stays the same now it's your turn practice assigning values to variables in coda bowls astroid a game and game designer an asteroid iya you match the colored fuzzball variables on the left with asteroids of equal value on the right if the variable meets an asteroid of equal value the asteroids will clear let's try one more level that is a bit harder I'll start by storing all the same values that I see in the asteroids let's try it oh oh it looks like I don't need every value I saw that's okay these are variables so as the programmer I can change the values remember we want to keep code short the asteroids will clear themselves if like values match so I just need to blue fuzzball variables and gravity does the rest hooray we kept our code short and cleared the asteroids in game designer you call the shots choose from the many variables you want to change and make the value something different now you can give it a try yourself happy coding
