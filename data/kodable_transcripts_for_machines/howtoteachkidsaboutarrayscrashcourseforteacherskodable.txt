whoohoo let's go hi I'm Doreen I'm the director of curriculum at codable the short video is going to introduce you to the concept you'll be teaching in this unit thanks for watching variable story information or values in a program there are different types of variables that are used in different situations there's strings integers and arrays we've learned now that strings are variables that hold values that are groups of characters like a word or a phrase while integers store values that are numbers like 550 or 500 an array is an ordered list of related variables that includes both strings and integers arrays group related variables together and keep code organized which makes storing values more efficient in real life you can think of your closet as an array you use your closet to organize your clothes and keep them in a specific order the order you hang your clothes in organizes them in a defined way your shirts are going to stay where are you hitting them let's say on Sunday night you're planning your outfits for Monday Tuesday and Wednesday when you hang your green dress shirt on the far left spot in your closet from Monday your blue shirt in the middle of the closet for Tuesday and your favorite red shirt on the right in your closet for Wednesday they will be where you hung them and organized in this way when you need them throughout the week in programming we can store a related data in an array grouping the related values together in a list in the final part of each arrays lesson students will independently practice using an array to clear the asteroid field in this Troy dia arrays work just like they do in real programming they're used to keep code clean and more efficient so students will be able to use an array to get three moves with just one command this will allow students to solve some of the lessons using just one move in this lesson the colors represent string variables there are six different values used here red pink yellow green blue and purple I need to correctly order my list of variables to be able to clear the asteroid field when I match the values I see that I need to first clear red pink than yellow and so on I ordered the values in myarray this way so that I can successfully clear the asteroid field by matching the values from my commandment with the values in the field let's think a little bit more about how arrays are actually used in programming think about codable for example we have hundreds of thousands of students that use codable to learn programming when you have your students use a class code to login their names are actually stored in our program as an array so anytime your students entered their class code it brings up a list of names and allows them to select their name from their class list and login to their profile all of these names are strings like we've talked about and they're stored in our database as an array which keeps code organized and more efficient and allows your students to log in and find their names to get to their profiles faster programmers can use just one command to search all of the values stored in an array without needing to know what each variable may be so now we know arrays makes storing and finding values more efficient you
