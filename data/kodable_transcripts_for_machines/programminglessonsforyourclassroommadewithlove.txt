woohoo let's go computers think in a very specific way and if you understand how they think you're going to understand how the world works and that's going to make you more successful in everything you do as a district we didn't anticipate was going to happen I think when we started rolling out the Kinder code program using codable that it was okay well we're just going to do this one thing and that what we found was it opened up the doors to a lot of conversation we wouldn't have had when we introduce codable to the students I really like to kind of have a conversation with them connected to what they're doing as student so in kindergarten they're coming to school to learn their letters and their sounds to be able to read and we like to connect that to how computers know how to read to and computers read code and we kind of connect that then to what they're going to see in the game if you want to teach computer science I think you should approach it the same way as if you want to learn computer science a lot of people like they want to figure out what language I want to use or what framework should I use or what program should I buy what kind of computer should I get really you're you're not going to know that a front you just want to get started I think the most important thing is to Dive Right In kid can go on an app and play but it looks just the same to them they don't recognize what they're doing they don't always make that conclusion oh I'm using conditionals or oh I'm learning how to do things step by step that's where the teaching comes into play and so having somebody do that via instruction and help them make that connection is also where you then take that connection outside of the app and into other areas so we make a big effort to understand what teachers do in the classroom and how we can make them most successful teaching it even if they don't know computer science themselves and everything we do that can make it easier is just going to help them and ultimately it's going to help the kids which is what's most important puzzles are all online for the students so they can progress and they're practicing the skills on their device but as a teacher you get to go in and you can model the lessons you can introduce the language to them you can scaffold it so that way when they go in they playing by themselves they're building their understanding based on what you provided them before they get to play not just trying for the kids in terms of like I'm willing to try something new and different it became something different for the teachers too and was made it so that oh I can explore other areas of Technology because I'm starting to feel comfortable from going around to different classrooms and supporting our kindgarten teachers use codable I've had a lot of positive feedback from teachers you're teaching students one of the most transformative subjects you could possibly teach them at an age where some of them can't even read yet there's a magic to that to them it's fun um and it's engaging and codable has great resources online that you can follow their lesson plans you can read through it and you can do it word by word or you can skim through and make it work for you and your students just try go with the Getters don't give up okay we're going to coach today
