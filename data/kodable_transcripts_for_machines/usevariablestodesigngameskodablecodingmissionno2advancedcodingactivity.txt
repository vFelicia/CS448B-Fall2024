think about your favorite games have you ever wondered how they were made or why they look the way they do there are a lot of steps and different jobs involved in creating a game today you will practice these steps as you design and test your own computer game encodable here's your mission design your own asteroid blaster game select variables and modify their values to customize the way your game looks and functions so what goes into making a game well here at codable we have two programmers one designer one head of product and one project manager who collaborate and work together to make one game come to life let's start from the beginning though there are some basic steps that people go through in the process of making a game step 1 id8 what is the idea for your game step 2 design what will your game look like how will it work step 3 create program or develop your game step 4 test have other players play your game and give you feedback step 5 iterate what is working and what isn't repeat this process to continue to improve your game over time let's take a look at this process in codable's game designer we've already taken care of step one and come up with the idea for this game the goal is to clear the colored asteroids with the fuzzballs today you will help with the rest of the steps here's what you'll do open the game settings code and take a look at the variables that you can add or change here at the bottom if you decide to add the game background variable then you can choose the value for example i can make the value stars or galaxy and change the way my game's background looks for a player let's look at another example this time in the asteroids file asteroid drop direction is a variable right now the value assigned to it is down i can change this value to up now the asteroids clear by moving up in programming we refer to variables with values that are words like up or down as string variables but some variables can have number values in the bins file if i assign a value of 5 to the number bins variable then i have more asteroids to play with number of bins stores a number value so we call this an integer variable select more variables and assign or modify their values to design the rest of your game be sure to save your code by clicking the green check mark each time you did it when you are done test it out trade with a partner for them to play to and get feedback finally iterate on your game based on the feedback from your partner that's what's so great about variables they can change for example if your friend says the game was too hard you will want to change the difficulty find the game difficulty variable and modify its value to be something easier don't forget building a game takes a lot of testing and improvements just look at how codable has changed over the years and we're not done yet now it's your turn open game designer create a game and complete your mission remember you are looking to design your own asteroid blaster game you will select variables and modify their values to customize the way your game looks and functions good luck
