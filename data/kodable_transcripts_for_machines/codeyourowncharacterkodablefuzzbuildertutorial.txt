welcome to codable today we are going to walk through how to build your own fuzz character to start let's go to fuzz Builder we can either create a new character or edit a fuzz that we've previously built let's create a new fuzz together first let's give our fuzz a name next we'll use a function to code our fuzz's body eyes and mouth features these features will be stored as properties in our code that means every time we play with our fuzz character they will always have the same design together we have a ton of options available so don't be afraid to get creative great job now that we've got our fuzz let's get them dressed up with some fun decorations finally let's save our fuzz so you can select which fuzz you want to play with as you explore the rest of fuzztopia happy coding
