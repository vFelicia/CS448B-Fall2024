hello all welcome back to the codable universe if you're new here my name is hannah i'm the instructional designer and coach at codable we are working to bring high quality and fun computer science education to every k5 student on this channel we post tons of animated video lessons that teach students coding basics but today we're going to do something a little different this is the first episode of a new series that i will be hosting on this channel where i hop on here and we chat about questions concerns wonderings or ideas that you have about teaching elementary computer science each episode will be a little bit different depending on what you guys are interested in so i definitely want to hear from you in the comments if you have ideas for topics you'd like to see covered for example i might break down a recent article that i find interesting offer different instructional tips and tricks share an interview with a teacher or provide direct resources the ultimate goal here is to get you the tools that you need to bring all things stem to your elementary students regardless of your background or if you have experience with science technology engineering and math for yourself i'm really excited about today's video because we are going to kick it off with one of my most favorite topics that has definitely gotten an overhaul in 2020 and that is maker makerspaces in today's video we're going to go over four tips for creating your first virtual makerspace virtual makerspace if you're excited to learn more and you enjoy this video while you're watching please be sure to give us a thumbs up and click the subscribe button so you don't miss more videos like this one all right enough rambling let's get into it so let's start with the basics what is a makerspace a makerspace is exactly like it sounds it is a space in a school or a library museum or some other setting where participants can make things it's a makerspace some makerspaces have hightech tools like 3d printers laser cutters soldering tools sewing machines that participants can use to make things but it really doesn't need all of these hightech machines or really any machine for it to be considered a makerspace if you have cardboard legos tape art supplies then you're on your way you can totally put together a makerspace it's more about the maker mindset this idea of creating something out of nothing and getting to choose what you're working on those are the things that are at the core definition of a makerspace in an education setting like a school maker spaces provide students with the opportunity to create handson projects of their choice so let's talk benefits there are tons of benefits to teaching in a maker space young children construct their knowledge of the world around them through everyday experiences they learn by doing by asking questions and seeking the answers through experimentation this is why makerspaces are such a powerful educational environment they provide students with this opportunity to practice the four c's that are so sought after in 21st century schooling so if you don't know the four c's are critical thinking creativity collaboration and communication but beyond the four c's maker spaces are an awesome learning environment to learn so many other 21st century skills like problem solving and selfconfidence basically maker spaces are awesome it's why i'm so passionate about them but i know a lot of teachers are unsure how to get started with the makerspace and especially in 2020 how to move it online so that's what we're going to talk about here like i mentioned there are tons of types of makerspaces some of them are bananas so i'll show you some examples there's fab labs which are like those hightech maker spaces i was talking about with the 3d printers and the laser cutters there's arts and crafts based maker spaces that are a lot more accessible to teachers so that's probably what you've seen in schools or museums that include handson art materials like tape and cardboard where participants can construct and make projects there's also wood and metal workshops there's um hacker what's the word like hacker spaces where all the making is done via computing so there's tons of options my personal experience with makerspaces i used to work at a children's science and art museum where i would teach camps and classes in an early childhood fab lab so this was a building that had high tech tools like a 3d printer some laser cutters a screen printing contraption in a learning environment meant for kids who were 2 to 10 years old so when i hear makerspace that's what i think of but in 2020 the maker space has gotten a total makeover what we have historically associated with maker spaces like handson learning collaboration those are things that have been a lot more difficult to do safely it's just not accessible right now so teachers being the brilliant innovators that they are have adapted and they've created the virtual makerspace so how does this work in a virtual setting a makerspace is going to look a lot like a choice board um if you haven't seen what a choice board is these are any webbased platform that students can go to and choose from a collection of activities or projects choices could be to read to go outside to do a science project to write to do art things like that choice boards are awesome because they allow the child to choose what they're interested in and direct their own learning so a virtual maker space is going to be pretty similar to a choice board except all the options that are on the platform ask you to make something you keep all the same principles that you would in a physical maker space but you move it online great it sounds so easy how do i do that so i'm no longer teaching i'm working at codable fulltime so to get inside the mind of a teacher and learn some firsthand tips we talked to shannon miller who is a district teacher librarian and innovation director of library and technology in iowa she works with get this 950 students grades prek through 12th grade so you better believe that she knows what she's talking about i'll link her social media in the description box below so you can check out some of the work that she's doing she is awesome and she actually has a premade virtual makerspace that you can take and change and modify to fit the needs of your class it's made with google slides and i'll link it in the description box below too but that's available to you right now if you want some sort of jumping off place for the virtual maker space i am going to use this example as i go through her tips for creating one yourself so here is her makerspace and now let's talk about shannon's four tips for creating your own virtual maker space step one think carefully about how the activities are organized it's great if the maker space is inviting and interesting to look at but more importantly it has to be easy to understand so you can see in shannon's example she organizes all the projects and activities by subject this makes a lot of sense to me because whether she has a kindergartner or a 12th grader accessing this maker space most kids organize their school day by the different subjects or classes that they're going to so in a virtual maker space if the activities are organized that way it'll make sense to the student it seems like such an easy tip but it makes a huge difference if kids understand how the maker space is laid out and organized they're not going to waste time trying to figure out the format and what each column means they're going to be able to go straight to the activity and the subject matter that they're interested in and not waste time trying just trying to figure out what they're looking at step two you'll want to include things that students are familiar with but also some new things so what this means is when your kids first look at the virtual maker space it might feel really new to them if this is something that you haven't done a lot in the past they're going to want to see topics subjects or activities that they've seen before to kind of ease them a little bit to help them realize that this doesn't need to be like a scary scary shift or anything that there's things there that they know that they will be successful doing that said you don't only want the content matter in your virtual makerspace to be the kids have already done or mastered in the past the incredible thing about maker spaces is that it allows kids to learn by doing like we mentioned earlier it allows them to learn through experimentation and if they've already mastered a bunch of content there isn't that much to gain in the virtual maker space by redoing that same content which is why shannon recommends adding some new topics in there some new activities that maybe they've never seen before even new subject matter to see if they choose to experiment and if they do then there's a lot of learning opportunities there for example shannon shared that a lot of the teachers that she has worked with include coding as an option in their virtual maker spaces coding is something that is not taught in every school but has a big impact in helping students develop creative problemsolving skills resilience and logical reasoning so yeah don't be afraid to include topics that might be brand new to your students because that's how they'll learn the most step three keep it fresh as we mentioned you want the content in your makerspace to be organized in a way that's easy to understand but you don't want it to get stale this is actually one of the best things about a virtual makerspace i think and is actually a huge benefit over a physical makerspace is that if you created your makerspace online you can change your offerings all the time you might realize that one project that you posted is not really popular with your students they're not excited about it they're not completing it get rid of it you can switch it up you can add something else in there to test out if that would work better it's a way for you to make sure that the content you're providing for students is the best content for them and also it keeps it interactive and fun and interesting your students will log on to their virtual maker space excited to see something new that they haven't tried before so as shannon says keep it fresh and step four this is the step that shannon says is one of the most important when creating your own virtual maker space listen to your students you are the expert you know your students the best if you listen to what they're interested in you can tie that into the makerspace offerings there should be a relationship between your kids and your makerspace curriculum you can ask yourself do my students see themselves reflected in these projects are these issues that they care about are they interesting to them when my students work on these activities do they see themselves as powerful change makers in the world this is one of the reasons why i'm so passionate and why i love coding and computer science as an option in your virtual makerspace because we've seen it this year more than ever technology is changing the world and we do interact with it every single day especially during virtual learning to offer something like coding and computer science in your virtual maker space will help kids make a connection between what is going on in their everyday life and what they're learning in school even our youngest students can play a role in changing the world when they learn computer science at a young age so listen to them what is relevant in their lives and make sure that that is reflected in your maker space as well okay this is the last thing that i'll talk about before we wrap it up and i i thought it was really important to include if you were to google virtual makerspace or choice boards or even looking at shannon's version of her virtual maker space looking at any of these examples they are what i would call pinterest worthy this means that they look amazing they have artistic flourishes and it's clear that a lot of time went into creating the aesthetic that you actually see when you open the makerspace having it be warm and inviting and interesting when you first open it is a huge plus but i want to make sure that before i wrap this video up i tell you that it's not required if you look at these examples and you think to yourself oh gosh i am not tech savvy i'm i'm not artistic my maker space or my choice board that i put together is not gonna look like these examples that i see on pinterest that is okay it is much more important in my opinion to make sure that the activities that you're linking to are awesome and the aesthetic how it looks can come second because at the end of the day our students are going to learn by doing the activities they're going to learn by clicking the link and following the instructions they're not going to learn just from looking at the makerspace itself they have to dive in and do the projects so that's why i just wanted to emphasize picking the right projects that are relevant for your students lives over spending a ton of time making sure it looks beautiful again both are important but don't lose sight of where the learning is happening because we're all new to this there is no best practices for virtual maker spaces yet because it's all so new please do not think that some of the examples that you see online are the template that you must use to create your virtual maker space make it your own you might have a completely different idea that works a lot better for your students so i hope that makes sense that is about it for our first episode of insert the name that i come up with for the series that i haven't thought of yet if you have any ideas for what this series could be called where i offer tips and tricks like this leave it in the comments below i'd love to get some perspective from the community that's actually going to be watching these videos i really hope you found this video helpful make sure that you like the video
