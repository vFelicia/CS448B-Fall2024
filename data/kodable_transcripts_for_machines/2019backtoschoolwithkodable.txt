good morning I'm Gretchen we're the founders of codable this is Hannah and I recently joined our team early this summer that she recently she's our instructional coach at global so a lot of you may have talked to her this summer we've been doing some training calls with her she's doing a great job she was making some amazing resources you will find we'll cover some of them in this webinar but you'll find the money on your dashboard um she was a computer science teacher in an elementary school and then went back to school at Harvard where she was studying technology innovation in education and she was also working in their creative computing lab there for a little bit she's just super knowledgeable we're so lucky having um and so she's going to be joining us she's gonna be leaving most of this so you guys can get familiar with Hannah um if you have any questions as we're going through things we have a live chat on the side you can push your question there we're going to be checking in with that as we go and breathe I'm sure many of you know BRE she is going to be monitoring questions and answering any of them as they come up if she can so we're so excited to have you all if you have questions feel free to post them we're going to cover so I'm just going to give you a rundown of all the things you're going to talk about we're gonna cover getting started with codable so many of you all are new yeah thank you to everybody who RSVP'd and told us a little bit about if you can use Google before I was so blown away it's so exciting to have so many newbies and then some of you guys are coming back for the second time or third time I think gosh this points like seven years I think so um we're gonna cover all of the exciting things we added this summer we've been making a lot of changes on the parent side of coda well they're going to affect some of the things you're doing at school we're also we've also been adding a lot of resources on your teacher dashboard so we're going to get to some of that today so yeah let's get started I'm so excited to have you back to school everybody yeah have you back to school so my kitchen said the goal of this webinar is really for all of you to feel comfortable teaching your first class with codable this year whether that's your first class ever or your just your first class this year because your students are new and so we're gonna jump in I'm going to broadcast my teacher dashboard to you guys and walk through some things that are new and then the basics for setting up a class and getting started so I'm gonna jump into that as always if you guys have any questions please feel free to write them in and we'll try to answer them as we go and then have a big question and answer at the end and so I'm going to jump in and share my screen I wish you guys can see the setup that we have so Hannah doesn't actually have a standing desk we have her monitor like up on her trash can right now so I'm really gonna go great crazy setup that we whipped up the last minute so that we can be standing but yeah it's working out really nice so far then modernism toppling over okay all right um so we are in this is your teacher dashboard I'm guessing most of you have seen this before if you have it you can register for a free teacher a free teacher account on our website so once you're in I'm going to talk through really quickly how to add a class that is the first step to teaching with codable so though you can click this add class button and yes one second can you switch so that it's the full screen who's right name yes but we're not even there so okay here we go see hopefully that helped out yeah awesome I'm just gonna wait to make sure that we're all set up thank you perfect um so we are in our class class creation page so what I'm going to title this class webinar but you can name it whatever you need for your students there's also advanced options to import your in bulk through Google classroom and there's a clever link as well so we can continue on I'm going to add some students so I will add Hannah Gretchen and Bree as students for my class save and continue now the class code is the way that your students will be able to log in and use quotable so there are there is a video giving you a tip on how to create a class code basically we just want this to be easy to remember and something that your students will be able to remember so I'm going to give it webinar 2 as my class code save and continue' you can also choose to use some of these suggested class codes if you want to just to make things easier for yourself if you decide to make to use one of those but then you decide to change it you can always change it from your class page absolutely so once you have your class set up that's kind of the first big thing you need to get onto your teacher dashboard after this you can pretty easily jump right into teaching with codable you just need to get your students logged in to play so doing that is very simple you'll just click on the button that says student instructions student instructions are going to generate a page here that you can see that will give your students all the instructions they need to use the classic code you just created to play with codable so they will just need to open codable either through the iPad app or through the web at a notable com they are going to enter their class code that you just created and that's super easy because each student is going to be given a unique code card so it has their name on it you can see these are the students I just entered for my class as well as the class code it's right there super easy to see there's also a parent code on these code cards if students want to continue playing at home and we're going to get into a little bit about sharing with parents a bit later one thing to note is that if you are using iPads when you download this class you only have to enter the class code once it'll just download that class roster and then whenever kids come back to the app all you need to do is like tap on the class and the tap on their name so entering the class code is only something you have to do once on the iPad um so once you have once your students have class code it's very easy for them to start playing with codable and I'm just going to show you how easy that would be so you've set up your class and you've created a class code your students are going to access game decodable comm or the iPad app they'll click on the button that says enter class code and this is where you will enter the code again that was on their code cards this is webinar 2 so when they enter their class code they are then prompted to choose their name from the class roster so I'm going to choose to play as Hana and it will take them right into the codable game so again we did that in about five minutes setting up the class generating the class code and then having your students log in once they have the link to play and so right now I'm just gonna go through one lesson in codable so for those of you that haven't seen it before or experienced it too much and you can see what it's all about and so when your students log in for the first time this is exactly what they will see so they will be prompted to meet blue fuzz you can see the code syntax showing up as they are dragging the different parts and then they are into fuzz topia so again this is exactly what your students will see when they're playing the game for those of you that are new and they would be brought to this hope the dashboard where they will click go and these are our three worlds in codable Smee Borg asteroid and bug world and we're gonna get into the lessons and a little bit more about great pacing when we dive into the dashboard a little bit later but I'm just going to show you if you're starting for the first time what your students would see if they click on Sea Org so they will start at level one and you can see if that level one is unlocked the first thing that happens in Smee Borg is they are going to meet us but as I'm just going to fastforward through on the introductory video so you guys can see the lesson here but they're given a little tutorial of how Smee board works so sweet work is really trying to teach it's trying to teach sequence conditions loops and functions but it starts with a very basic tutorial of how to input code commands to get your Fuzz through the techno Me's to the end and so I you can see that I dragged in different arrow commands I would move my foot through the maze and I'm going to click go on oh yeah yeah umm so above thingy the play button you guys see this adorable little I character I mean is buzzbuzz and this is our our new hint system that we just added this school year we added it early at this summer but it's really nice there's a face of three hints that students can get if they're struggling they're gonna be prompted to get a hint after 30 seconds if they need it so we've tested it with a bunch of kids and it's surprise I was I was a little worried oh they're just gonna hit hints every time but I've seen a lot of them actually like really like to try before they hit get the hint and it's only going to give them a portion of the correct answer so they're still constructive struggle that's happening but you can read more about it on our help center support quotable calm if you have any questions feel free to let us know or feedback honestly because it's new yeah so after your students have input the code commands that they need to get their folks to the means they'll click go you can see the different commands are lighting up as they move to the level and then they'll move on to the next lesson so that is just a really quick snapshot of what's new board looks like and what your students would be doing for the first time that they log into the game I am back on my teacher dashboard now and I want to show you something that we've newly moved to the left side of your dashboard which is called teacher demo mode I'm holding my mouse over it right now it's with this green game controller so we just went through what your students would experience the first time that they are playing if you are on your teacher dashboard and you want to play a level to see what your students would be doing that day or remind yourself what is happening in Seaborg you can actually play every single codable level by clicking on teacher demo mode this is codable unlocked and it's something that when I'm talking to teachers not everyone has heard of or used before I think it's incredibly helpful when you're planning but I'm just gonna quickly click on it it is codable unlocked so all levels are open for you to play in Snee Borg asteroid eeeh and bug world so if you want to learn a little bit about what your students would be doing this is the place to go and you'll see that everything is unlocked on the sides including the game levels when you click on the treehouse in the middle I'm just going to take a moment right now we have this open to tilt I guess some of you this is all very new but to a lot of you you're like what in the world is this so we spend so much time the summer at creating fuzzy copia which is the new like home planet of the fuzzes we've been we've been following their adventures years and years but and now we get to see their home planet and this is going to be the hub for all your students work so they can go to the tree house to select their mission which is right over to the for the game levels they can go to make mazes over here in this little maze maker Hut they can go to build their own fuzz in the fuzz build or a tree house and then they can go make their own games in the game maker game designer garden there's so much happening here you're gonna be adding a lot to this over the coming school year it's a great way to like keep students engaged so they can see their worth building soon they're going to be able to kind of customize the way that this looks and we have some really exciting plans for fuzz topia for the our code this year but one thing that's really cool is that this will sync between what students are doing at home and at school so if those if your students go home and their parents are thrilled that they're learning to code and they decide to go ahead and get a codable for parents account those are different levels it's not going to interfere with what you're doing at school but this will sync up between the two accounts so kids have some sort of continuity between what they're doing at school what they're doing at home and they can really like invest in collecting all of their fuzzes and managing all their creations and I'm really go hogwild with all the cool things that they can do the last thing to point out is that the little Hart house over here and that actually is where they're going to collect all their badges and achievements and everything that they've been working so hard for and codable will be collected in that little house so yeah there was a lot of exciting things that we've updated in the game I hope you guys like this I just wanted to point this out because I know some of you are gonna come in on the first day of school open up your eyes oh my god so here you go a quick little tour of Suns topia yeah I just also wanted to point out I'm seeing a lot of comments that are saying that you used to create a student like a fake teacher account as a student to go through the game hi here you this is a lot easier and it's always right here on your teacher dashboard if you need to use it it's also I think somebody pointed out it's a great way to demo a lesson to students if you want to play alongside them so that's another use for it so at this point I'm just gonna pause really quick we've gone through setting up a class getting students logged in and then seeing what students might be learning through the teacher demo mode are there any questions and that we can address right now before we move forward to the rest of the dashboard um no questions and I can see so far I look I'll give people a minute to write those in it they have them but I did want to address Deborah Kirby actually made a really good point show saying it'd be helpful if we could know everything like a text popup or something to know what it is on post ouvea and I totally agree I think we're going to be adding some support documents for Fuzz topia so that you know everything that's going on there you can always check support dr. kovac on we have help articles for just about everything but yeah that's a good point maybe we should add something in teacher materials to cover that your students however are going to be guided through Fuzz topia so nothing is going to be unlocked when they start and then as they progress through the game because they're learning new concepts those buildings those tree houses and all the different areas will unlock for them and kind of give them a tutorial on how to use it what they're going to be doing and so like we actually changed a little bit of how things are unlocked first for kids so once they unlock the fuzz builder for example it'll pop up here they'll unlock the building and then they'll start collecting costumes and decorations for their fuzzes as they're continuing through codable so it's going to be like a gradual process where we introduce students to it but I totally agree w I need something for teachers to know like what more old are all these building that's a great yeah yeah definitely okay so there's no one question can I make a cart backend or my asks can I make a hard copy of the fuzz Tokyo page I would it would be great if I had a list of what each place oh so I we've got an idea I think we'll make some sort of a map I mean we'll put it in our help center but then we can also send it out to you guys as a resource but some sort of a map with everything labeled and a short description would just be a really good thing to have since it is new for a lot of teachers yeah all right feedback in the Marigny yeah so we've gone through teacher demo mode the next part of the webinar that I'm gonna walk through is how you can use your teacher or to manage your classes we've got a lot of really great questions thank you to those of you who RSVP'd and wrote in questions about managing classes and I'm gonna try to address them all now and then we'll cover what we don't address in the Q&A so when you get into your teacher dashboard you'll always select the class that you're looking to teach for that day if you can remember back at the beginning I created my webinar class so that's what I'm going to click on to use as I walk through these features at the top of your dashboard these ones at the top here where I'm driving my mouse these are linked to your specific class that you just chose so I am on webinar class and the first thing I'm going to talk about is assignments so assignments is basically the way that we describe how which levels of the game your students are able to plan you will see that if you selected k5 as your grade then everyone whether or not you selected k5 or not potable automatically assigns levels if you don't want your students to be able to play a specific level all you need to do is click on assign that means that when your students log in to the game they will not be able to play the level that you have unassigned if all levels are assigned you give them the class code and they log in they will be able to move through the levels at their own pace without ever being stopped at any point so I point out the assignments tab has a really useful way for teachers to control how quickly their students are moving through the game and kind of use that as a tool to shape your lesson plans so if you are interested in just having students do one set of levels a day because you are also teaching other content in your class you can unassign the other levels students will only be able to play the ones that are lit up in green and then the next day you can assign the next level I do actually if you can you just show that you'll need to click but over here on this side tab you actually have like a global assignments page that you can use if you want to assign things to multiple classes you don't have to go to each class page you can actually just go to this assignments page and assign to all classes or to just like say you want to have all your third grade classes on the same pacing you can just assign it to all your third grade classes that's a great place to go to do that so there's there's two different ways that you can do this awesome Elmo so this is the assignments tab like I said I'm going to move forward into the lessons tab again these are lessons that codable recommends based on the grades that you selected when you created your class so when I set up my webinar class I selected k5 as my grade band quotable is then going to recommend curriculum recommend lessons that are appropriate for that grade level so if I have selected only kindergarten classes these lessons would look different there would be fewer lessons in some of these trickier units as you get into a some more advanced content it would it paces it for you but you can always edit the grade levels that you've selected and then that will impact the pacing that codable recommends you show them that oh yeah absolutely so right now I'm k5 I'm just going to edit my class setting which is over here I'm going to select kindergarten just as an example going to save my changes and then when I head back to lessons you'll see that a lot of those units that were covering some more advanced content are gone so kindergarten has these units sequence and conditions with the accompanying lessons that are appropriate for kindergarten now if you notice that your kindergarteners are moving through these lessons and they're doing a really great job and they are capable of taking on some trickier content always remember that you can edit the grade in your class settings k5 will give you access to everything since it covers all the grades and that will open up the rest of the units and the lessons um so I'm just going to dive into an example lesson if you guys have any questions again please feel free to write them in after this we'll take a pause and to answer some questions about assignments and lessons so I'm going to start at unit 1 sequence and the first lesson is introduction there were some questions that were written in about the difference between what is accessible on a free teacher account and then what is accessible on a paid account sequence one introduction is a lesson that's available to everyone who's watching here so what this is definitely a great place to look to see if our lessons that we provide would work for you and your students I'm just gonna walk through what the lesson holds so each lesson starts with a short description of the lesson it covers the objectives so for this first lesson students are going to be able to move a robot which is actually another classmate or a teacher to move across a room to perform different actions like spinning and jumping I'm using programming like so it then covers vocabulary and all of our vocabulary has been updated this year so definitions are a bit simpler um easier for younger students to understand which is great each lesson then moves into direct instruction so kind of the philosophy of these lessons is a gradual release model so we want it's kind of like an I do we do you do format so the I do is when you as the teacher are introducing a new concept and this is maybe you're going over new vocabulary you're asking students but they already know about the content that you're covering so for example in this first lesson we're talking about what is something a programmer might make on what do programmers do what how do they use code so it's really discussion based I'm going over an introduction of the content for the day the second section of each lesson is the guided practice activity that is the we do and these are unplugged activities that you can do with your students where they are getting a really handson tangible experience with the coding concept that you're introducing that day so in this example students are acting as programmers and they're applying knowledge of programming language and sequence to command a robot and I'm you can't see if I'm saying that in quotes because it's a it's another person to move forward and jump so again this is unplugged and every single lesson that you'll see on our teacher dashboard that we've created are hung flowed Plaisance for students to really get that handson experience first so they're learning about it in an unplugged handson way on the final section is actually the independent practice that's the you do section of the lesson where students are logging into codable and we recommend certain less levels themed levels to go with each lesson so in this example students are going to be logging into Smee Borg and they'll be clicking on the first set of levels in sequence these are directly tied to the sequence concepts that we just went over in the direct instruction and the guided practice activity each lesson then wraps up with a check for understanding these are usually group discussions maybe they're a short reflection for the student to participate in where they kind of sum up what it was learned that day are there any questions before we move on about these lessons because I know I just went over a lot of information there um we are getting lots of love people are so excited like oh my gosh this is made for me um so thank you guys I'm so happy that you all like this I did want to address so Scott was asking he's a parent um and they are curious about whether or not to use the parent or school version I would say for the vast majority like 99.9% of parents the parent version is what you want unless you are a home schooler or you are in some sort of like a cottage school situation I definitely recommend the parent version using colorful at home because our like program and pricing and everything is set up for like school users on the school version and the parent version likewise I set up for home use for use by a parent we are actually working on a lot of materials for parents this school year we just added progress tracking and for parents teachers actually you can share with that that parent code they don't even need a parents account to arlenian account that they don't need to like upgrade to the paid version to view what their kids are doing at school but if you choose to get the parent version you're gonna have access to progress tracking for both school and home and then we're working on a lot of these same materials for parents but in a better context like for what you're actually doing at home so like a lot of this stuff is set up for a class situation with multiple students like lots and lots of students in other cases and so for parents it's just best to stick with the parent version but if you are interested like say you are on one schooler or you do have an interest in using our school product at home please feel free to email me at Gretchen at Kohler Bolcom or support code will calm and we can chat with you about getting something set up for you so definitely do that but again I just want to reiterate the parent version is probably what you want to go with this absolutely okay so again this was the lesson and we'll go over what lesson library is in just a little bit and we're going to move on to student creations and actually Gretchen is going to talk about how you kind of just touched on it but if you want to say it again what we're doing to share student creations that students are creating in class with families yeah I'm gonna go put it and show you guys what you can see so when your students go we don't have any creation here we have a class that does yeah totally class of what I'm chick cave the k5 so when your students are unlocking those areas infos topia like a buzz builder and the maze maker and all these other sections of culpable they're gonna start creating their own closets and they're so cute I just love all the things that students make we actually do a feed of them like on the back side and go to and it's just adorable but um you can actually view them all from here and you can view the code that they wrote and then you can send this it prints a little PDF that you can send home to parents and actually if they go ahead and set up a global account at home they can view all of their child's creations from their parent dashboard and they can log in using the class code at home and play with their fusses or if they decide to get a parent account they and actually play with those buzzes at home as well so it's just really neat to be able to share everything that they're learning with their family the other thing that they can see are their mazes so in codable there's a way for students 1/3 yeah um so we actually have the option for kids to wonder when they're learning new concepts like saying they've they've gotten to conditions and they've sort of mastered conditions maze maker will unlock and they'll have the option to start making their own levels using conditions and then as they unlock loops they'll have the option to add a maze and create a maze that uses loops and it's really just so incredible through the things that kids come up with I used to make all of the levels I still make all of the levels in codable and I was like I know basically every like way that you can make a level uncodable so we did a maze native competition I guess like a year ago and I was blown away there were so many creative and just inspiring pieces that kids came up with so it's a great way to like assess how well they're understanding the concept but also just to get them thinking creatively using the design thinking process and learning about you know basically working backwards through a problem yeah absolutely so like Gretchen said these the creative applications can be used kind of as an informal assessment and when you're teaching to see how students are asking the concepts and actually applying them in a creative way um another tool that we have here for tracking student progress is the progress tab so we did get a couple questions written in on the RSVP that was asking about grades does codable give grades how do i grade this work um so that's going to be really dependent on you as a teacher but besides the informal assessments with these student creations you can use this progress tab to see their level of progress how far they are moving through the game so which concepts they're covering it you can see Alex my student here has finished si Wynn's alice is just starting and my other students are further behind so that's just a way for you to gauge how students are moving through the levels and which which concepts are mastering you also have this option to click on view standards progress and this is going to show you which computer science standards for each unit so for sequence conditions etc your students have started are working on or have mastered and these computer science standards if you go to codable Java Khan / outcomes you'll see how we put these computer science standards together for sequence they cover State Standards and other other computer science standards that we've put together to cover everything that you might need to be tracking for your school so again this progress tab it's covering in progress as well as standards progress and you can kind of use that information how you need to in order to provide grades about something you're interested in doing but we just wanted to give you the information here in case you may need it so before we move on I'll just point out that there are also tabs at the top here for students and for class settings both of these are useful for managing your class students you'll be able to see your class roster print their login instructions again and add students to your class and then class settings like I showed before is a good way to edit what grade your class is maybe you want to change the class code or assign the class to another teacher so that they can have the information for your class this is the place to do it there's also you can see this danger zone there are some things over here that you might need for resetting all student progress and other things like that if you have questions about this please let us know some of the stuff that I saw in the RSVP questions about transferring students we're going to go over when we talk about these tabs here on the left but we just went over all of the different features that codable teacher word offers for managing a specific class are there any questions Richard that are that have been written in about the times that we covered so far really only just one question about what grades clinical is appropriate for so cloacal is focused on groups k25 we do have people who use it with younger students may be like prek or teaching students we also have people that use it in middle school it's their just introduced including to their kids for the first time obviously if you're using it with older students or younger students they're going to move at a different pace then what codable might like assume so if they're younger they may move a little bit slower or if they're older than even move a little bit faster and you can adjust everything from your assignments page based on what you see happening in your classroom so like I said you can totally manage using it with kids outside of those age ranges if you want to but yes it is primarily focused on K through 5 totally great so as we move on I'll direct your attention to this left menu on the side of your dashboard if you remember this is where we found teacher demo mode before the resources here on the left side of your dashboard are not linked to one specific class so this is where you want to go like arch and said if you're assigning to multiple classes at one time or you want to manage student transferring across multiple classes you'll go to this left side menu so I'm going to start with the lesson library we take in one quick question oh yeah so it knows asking if we have the option to add multiple like share a class by the teacher say you have a co teacher or something right now there's only one teacher per class but you can say you're on the codable school plan and you're an admin or like say you're the tech teacher for at school and there's a firstgrade teacher who wants to add their class you can add teachers and assign them to a specific class if you are on a quotable school plan but for the basic free version there is no way to have multiple teachers and there's no way to have multiple teachers on a class in the school version either you would just view it as an admin and you would see all the classes and then that teacher would be assigned to it if you have questions about our admin tools please feel free to email me Gretchen at koat.com or Bree at coldwell comm we're happy to go over that with you children great so like I said we're moving into the lesson library the lesson library is the place where you can find lessons that are not linked to are not well they're not all linked to our core content there are a lot of them are supplementary that you can use to cover different content besides just the coding concepts that are covered in our core curriculum so for exists ill Terr feature on the left side it's kind of like what you would use if you were shopping where you know you're looking for and you can filter based on what you're looking for specifically so if I am interested in finding kindergarten lessons and let's say I want to cover the coding concept of sequence and then I can choose a content area let's say I really want to do an introduction to robotics unit the lesson library filters and offers you lessons that are directly linked to those features that you just filtered for um so this does bring up our robotics unit where we've partnered with Wonder workshop and the and dot robots and you can click on these lessons again they're structured the same way that the lessons were when we went over them in the lessons tab where there are scripted and they cover everything you'll need to use to run the lesson if you find something in the lesson library that you want to teach you can click Save the lesson you'll choose the class that you want to save it for I'm and that will save right to your says dashboard so you won't need to go back into the Lawson library to find it again it'll be saved which is really nice so again visit these are a lot of these are supplementary lessons that you might want to use in other content areas not just coding but it shows you how coding concepts can be linked to all of these other content areas so for example if I'm interested in integrating a coding lesson into en la I can click English language arts the tab over here I'm and it'll filter into these lessons that I can click on to teach different things so definitely I recommend exploring this lesson library to see what is available to you you'll notice that there's a little quotable school icon on some of these that means that those lessons are just accessible to schools with the quotable school account but if it doesn't have the icon then it's open for you to click on and you can go through these lessons to see if it's something you'd want to integrate in your class and if it is a paid lesson you can actually view a preview FL so for those of you who are considering incredible school for your for your students you can get a view of what our paid lessons look like cool so the next look we kind of touched on assignments already so I'm not going to click on it but that's where you would want to go if you were assigning levels to multiple classes at once the students tab is what I want to go to now because we did get a lot of questions since there's a lot of teachers who are starting their school year and want to transfer students from one class to another maybe classes are moving up a grade and you want to transfer some students from the kindergarten class to the first grade class this is where you can do all of that really easily and transfer in bulk so I'll show you quickly if I wanted to transfer let's say I have some students in my first grade class who I want to transfer into my second grade class I would click on the students tab I would select the students that are in my firstgrade class that I want to transfer you can select as many as you need and then there's this purple transfer selected students button I click on that there's a dropdown menu it's going to ask me which class I want to put them in so I want to transfer them to second grade I'm going to click on the second class and transfer students so it's that easy now you'll see that my two students here that were originally in first grade I've now transferred into second grade so this is the place you can go to do all of that transferring from one class to another which I know a lot of people were interested in so if there are any questions about transferring students in bulk let us know I'll pause right now to see if there's anything that we need I'm just like reading through the chat there's a lot of discussion and on the lesson library holiday it looks like we've answered all the questions people were asking like if they're on the game access plan of codable school would they have access to these lessons no you do not have access to all of the lessons in the lesson library if you're on the game access plan but you will have access to the free one so if if you're on if you have purchased the curriculum addon and don't have access to these but if you don't then you'll just look at the quotable school icon but you'd have the ones that don't have that on it and then we have let's see oh people are asking if there will be a recorded version of the webinar and oh yes yeah definitely so if this is being recorded right now we'll be sure to have the final version posted after we're done so you can head on back to review anything we've talked about also I'm offering trainings for teachers during the start of this school year so if you want to walk through the dashboard again oneonone and kind of go over just what you're interested or what you need more clarification on please reach out to me my email is Hana at potable comm and I'm happy to help you walk through that so someone was asking if there was an easy way to move students from first grade to second grade classes instead of putting all the names in again and I know you just went over that so I hope that that answered their question but I did want to be sure to address for people who are using either Google classroom or clever and soon class link actually really excited about um theirs so if you're using clever or class link I would assume I'm not as familiar with classic yet but codable will automatically update based on what you put into Kluber um if you are using if you're using Google classroom you will need to import your students again so you'd wipe out what you have is is seeing includable and then import them again it is not a twoway integration so it's not going to update live and if you aren't using either of those options then yes the class transfer the transfer selected students option that Hannah just showed you would be the way to go we do have bulk import built into the global dashboard when you're creating a class if you decide you wanted to start fresh and add all your students at once and say you have like 25 classes like so many of you do we have a bulk import option where you can just copy/paste your rosters from a spreadsheet and then I can eat the classes and stuff so that's really quick and easy to do if you don't have clever or some of the other options available to you so I am going to jump in a lot of you wrote in asking what is new what is new so I am going to show you what is new for teachers and Gretchen's gonna go over share to touch on a bunch of them but what is new for students so a big thing that is new that you guys I hope will love is the resource center it's at the top of this left menu and when you click on it this is where we are going to put all of our public resources everything you might need to teach with Co to show potable to your students to get started again so I'll just kind of walk through what is in the Resource Center there's the getting started kit that we had that was on the homepage when we logged in this getting started kit is going to be really helpful for those of you that want to know what codable is about what students are going to learn what content is going to be covered before actually using it with your students so there's three parts to the getting started kit there's a guy that is going to help you get set up with devices which we talked about with the code cards and then there's also an updated potable field guide and our updated scope and sequence so the codable field guide I think I actually have it up here this is a brand new guide that we've created that covers everything in codable that you might need to teach with it so it walks you through each of the three worlds what students are learning and what it will actually look like for them in the game it talks about our creative applications like we mentioned with building fuzzies and making mazes and then gives you a breakdown of our curriculum if that's something you're interested in using and some tips and tricks for how to implement the lessons so again if you're interested in learning more about codable what it's all about definitely check out this getting started kit it's in the resource center of your teacher dashboard and that includes our scope and sequence gesso so a lot of you have asked for scope and sequence over the years and we had one we didn't have a place to put it so I'm so happy we have this resource center because now all of those things that we've been creating over the years I'm just like sending the people over the automail are available here we're going to be adding a ton to this page over the next couple of months but yeah if you're looking for a scope and sequence check out the getting started kit it is in there so yeah yeah the other big thing that you probably see and are super excited about is we are starting to be staying answer keys so as a teacher we know that you know working through problems with your students is really important but sometimes you just get stuff and you need you feel like you need to know the answer to help this is the place to go so these are all the solutions for the smiie board lessons and we're working on asteroid iya and bug world as well and one think those are done they'll show up here in the answer keys of the Resource Center so these are all of this meatboy answer keys again right here Resource Center next to the getting started kit you can view the solutions there the other resources that are available in the Resource Center are the teacher guides teacher guides will walk you through all of this all of the content again that you are there students are learning in codable there are videos that are meant for you where you can watch them and learn more about the coding content if you are confused about any of the conditions or loops or any of the content that we're covering this is a place great place to go for you and then there are also classroom materials resources for your classroom posters you can pull it up and we're going to be adding to these all of the time so that is a quick overview of the Resource Center definitely poke around it's a great place well like Gretchen said we'll add to it a bunch can you show them one of the oh yeah so the end is actually working on updating all these but I do want to go ahead and show you so many people don't know that this exists and so I wanted to be sure to show everyone this is where you can go to learn about a concept before you teach it it sort of like codable for teachers so we talked about what see in this example this is our sequence guide what sequence is how it's used in programming some of the core like vocabulary vocabulary that you want to cover just explaining it to you in simple terms because I know so many of you don't have a background in computer science like oh these concepts are so new to me so we just wrote everything down in an easytounderstand way so that you can speak with a little bit more confidence when you're talking to your students and answering their questions and then we'll address what codable is teaching onscreen and how it works and how it relates to what this concept actually is in programming okay it's not everything really wanting to hello I think I think that is everything that was a lot so if you guys have questions please ask them reach out to us this video again will be recorded so no need to memorize it all right now um so I'm gonna give a couple minutes for people to ask questions if they have them you can go over our Q&A document but yeah so but I did want to be sure to let you guys know we are going to be adding a lot less spoiler so if you have questions you can always reach out to us at support at codable comm we also are doing a lot of work on our YouTube channel looking to add a lot more content there for you and for students and for parents so if you want to subscribe to our youtube channel just click the subscribe button somewhere on the screen up right below and you'll get updates about men we post new content we're also going to be doing a lot for parents this year so if you want to share that code card or any of your students creations with them that way you can be sure that they're staying updated on what's happening in your classroom and they're gonna be getting a lot of really cool new features this year as well um so let me see if we have any question great okay so they all had a question about Australia and connecting the concept of strings and colored a color glass sure as you shoot at this level seems hard put together can you explain a little bit of like what the connection is or do you want me to about what's happening on screen and then also where you can find more materials on like what's actually going on on screen yeah well so to find materials that will be in the resource center and that we were just on and if you go to those teacher guides there is a teacher guide for string variables array and Ruby variables and what am I forgetting strings arrays integers integers so there's guys for all of those and epidemic it shows you the screen captures of the actual game and talks through those how those concepts are being applied do you want to give a little bit of background about it um I'm sorry I was reading I'm like how how the how the link between the game and the variables oh yeah yeah so basically what's happening when you are assigning a variable of property or sorry assigning a variable of value in programming you need to use you need to make sure that there that you're either using a string which is a string of characters so we use colors represent that so it appears on the screen as purple written out so kids are learning like what the value types are in in coding when you're using variables there's those three different types there's also integers which is just a number and then there's arrays which can be a list of items it can be either a string or an integer and so for our idea we're really just trying to get them familiar with variable types and also like assigning value to things and then the game is the great way to hook them a awesome way to make sure that those concepts are hitting home and if students are really grasping like what a variable is is to progress them into the game designer as they're moving through our idea they're going to unlock properties which are just another name for variables within the game designer and they can actually start creating and designing their filling game and modifying properties within the code to make adjustments either to make it easier or harder or like a different flair to it so we have a really cool project where you can team students up to talk about like what kind of game they want and can make a game suitable for their partner and then they get feedback and to iterate on their design so there's a lot of stuff happening with variables within asteroid yeah but I would definitely be sure to check out the resources that cover all of that so that you can um talk about it with your students yeah and you can also reach out to us anytime you have questions always yes so they will practice they'll ask people if they practice these concepts when they build yes okay I don't see any other questions coming in so yeah if you guys need anything or we're going to share actually last thing on my cover we're gonna share all the resources of resources that we talked about in the description below this video after the fact I'm going to add a timestamp to some of the sections that we covered so that we can be sure to make this useful for people after the fact so you want to come back and you're like what was that thing they said you can come back and look through and see the resources and jump to a section of the video so thank you all so much I wanna you we're so psyched for this school year we have big plans and we love hearing all of your feedback so please please please keep us updated on that yeah and we love seeing all of your happy smiling faces and your students faces um this school year it's one of the things that keeps us motivated so we actually have a channel like in our team slack where we can see like what's happening on Twitter and who knows so if you want to share with us what's going on in your classroom if you have permission to do that please do that we love love love seeing what's going on so um thank you all so much for watching thank say Hanna but you know someone I come yeah thank you to those of you that have been commenting and giving tips and tricks tricks to other teachers that's so great and really brings together equitable community so thank you that you guys's we'll talk to you soon yep please reach out to us we're happy to talk alright everybody thanks again talk to you soon have a good thank you bye
