welcome to the fuzz family's pi day potluck all the fuzzies were supposed to bring a different kind of pie to share ruby has cherry spike brought pumpkin simon has apple violet brought pecan and wait a minute one of these pies is not like the others blue fuzz brought this mysterious symbol to the party does this look like pie to you well it might look different but the symbol is actually also called pi it's spelled differently there's no e at the end but it does sound the same the thing is you can't eat this pie it's a symbol that represents a very special number that is helpful for solving math mysteries about circles so let's talk circles for a sec because there are two important distances that will help us understand what this weird pie that you can't eat is all about the first is the distance from one point all the way around the circle the fancy math word for this is called circumference the second is the distance from one point across the circle the word for this is diameter pi is just the relationship or ratio between the two distances no matter what circle you look at the circumference is always a little more than 3 times the diameter but instead of saying a little more than 3 or 3.14 it's easier for us to use this greek symbol hi so why does pie matter well like i said before pi is helpful for solving math mysteries this is because if you know just one of these two distances you can use pi to figure out the other one here's an example last week the fuzz family decided they wanted to know the width of the planet smiborg the width or diameter is the distance from one point on the planet straight across to the other side but here's the thing planet smeaborg is not a flat circle it's a sphere like a ball and there's no way the fuzzes could measure a straight line through it they would have had to bury through the center of the planet and not even cole fuzz could dig that far then violet remembered something and told the rest of the fuzzies we can use pie to solve this mystery we just need to know the distance around the planet she flew all the way around the planet smiborg in her spaceship and measured the circumference then she used her knowledge of pie and solved the mystery of the smeborg diameter pie is very important to the fuzz family not only because it helps them solve mysteries like this around the universe but also because their bodies are spheres it's a cool thing that every single fuzz has in common fuzzes love to roll and bounce and spin to celebrate their circular shape and it's not just the fuzzes math lovers all over the universe have a holiday on march 14th to appreciate pie shapes and math in general your coding mission is to create a codable maze that includes a shape you see at the pi day potluck step one is to choose a shape take a look at the picture of the pi day party what shapes do you notice here are some examples i like the triangle shape of simon's party hat so i'll pick that step 2 log in to codable if you've already unlocked the maze maker you can go straight there but if you're brand new to codable make sure you start on planet smeeborg players need to complete at least four levels to learn about sequence and unlock the maze maker step three is to click the build button and open a new maze draw the shape you chose we need to connect the shape to each side of the maze maker then get creative this is a celebration so don't be afraid to add lots of decorations finally it's time to place the stars in the maze and test to make sure it's solvable in this example i actually just need my fuzz to roll straight so my code is only one command don't forget in programming and in math we test we make fixes we test and try again so don't give up if your maze doesn't work on the first try you're up next happy pi day
