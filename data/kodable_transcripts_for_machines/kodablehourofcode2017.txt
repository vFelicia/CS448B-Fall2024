all right hello everybody um my name is Gretchen Heavener and I am one of the founders of codable I am so excited for the hour of code this year we love CSN week here at codable obviously we gear up for it all year and I'm so excited to talk to you all about some of the things that we have new for this year I know some of you this is your first time using codable for some of you this is just another year you've been doing it you're seasoned pros at this point but there are some new things that are just for this brand new 2017 so we'll go over all of that but for everybody who's new we're gonna cover creating classes go over some of our hour of codes lesson plans that we have we've spent some time making some really awesome integrated lessons um covering you know science math ela and then some more selfguided options for people who are just kind of diving into it you want to have their kids on a game we have that option as well so we're gonna go over all of that we're gonna go over assigning game practice for kids so if you're getting them set up on devices and how to make sure that they have access to all the right levels we'll go over that real quickly um and then we're gonna cover some of the things that are brand new for this year so we have some awesome new creative content kids can make their own fuzzies they came to create their own mazes you can share that within your class if that's something you want to UM the option to do so we're gonna go over some of those things then open it up for questions so if you do have questions along the way feel free to put them in the chat that's up on the right John Mattingly my cofounder is gonna be answering questions as we go through here so he should be on it um but if you if you want to ask questions as we go that's great we're gonna leave time for questions at the end I know a lot of you submitted questions in the forum you are sweetpea so we have I have a list of those that I'm going to be sure to answer at the end so anyway let's get to it I am so excited um and we're just gonna start by going over what is quotable so a lot of you are brand new to the world of codable and I'm just gonna quickly describe what it is for you so codable is a k5 computer science curriculum for for students and teachers we create lessons for teachers who don't have any experience with computer science to help their students learn the fundamentals starting in kindergarten and then working all the way up to learning JavaScript in fifth grade as far as what students have access you there experiencing computer science you know starting like we learn to read you know you start learning your ABCs you start writing sentences we take that approaches with computer science we start by learning the very earliest building blocks and then build on that and scaffold it to more complicated things when they get a little bit older so they have they're learning all of this through lessons but then also in a fun and engaging game so in our game there are these cute adorable fuzzies and they're aliens who are exploring outer space and they need your students help to navigate all of the exciting challenges that are presented to them starting with mazes however they have to find their way through these mazes using coding concepts and coding commands and then going into learning about variables where they have to navigate and and destroy asteroids that are in there in their way and then going into you know some more tower defense games where they get to program towers using classes and properties in JavaScript so we'll just jump right into it first I'm gonna start out as if I had a new account and I was creating my first class then we'll get into how get your students signed on and kind of go into lesson plans from there so here we go I'm just going to share my screen look like okay so um if you are starting with codable brandnew and you don't have a class yet or if you are just creating an account for the first time this is the best way to have students logged in so that you can save their progress if you're planning on going you know and using codable beyond just the hour of code we do have options for you to use codable for just this week so that you don't have to actually create an account or if you want to use codable without having to like you know set up class or anything like that I'm gonna go over that stuff a little bit later but for now we're gonna go through like creating the class it's super simple to do um and I'm going to show you how to do that real quick so from your dashboard you would you know sign up at koat.com like add a class and just create a class name and it can be anything um I'm gonna call mine 2017 and for this I'm gonna assign it a k2 five pacing so this is gonna make everything accessible to me as if I was working with all grade levels you can choose your grade and this is gonna make lessons available to them based on their grade level so for kindergarteners we focus on you know sequencing and conditions and then you know fifth grade would be reviewing a lot of those basic concepts and then moving into JavaScript so it's going to change what's available to them based on like where they should be for that grade level pacing for this example I'm just going to choose K to five and continue and then you and your students one by one typing them in here or you can copy and paste from your spreadsheet it's super simple if you would just have a look like a list in a Word document however whatever format you want to put it it's gonna be per line so I'm gonna make my team and this is the class code so this is what your students are going to enter on their devices to get logged in later it's sort of like a password for your class you want it to be unique but you also want to be memorable so if you're working with like kindergarten students for example you can make it one of their vocab words plus your room name or your room number or your last name something that's gonna be unique to your students and it's going to be easy for them to enter later we give a couple of suggestions here for me I'm going to choose Gretchen for 2017 actually I'm going to make it something different we're gonna say webinar 2017 it says that this is available great all right it's that simple my class is created um I can go to my class and see what lessons are available to them so since I chose the k5 pacing you can see I have all of these lessons available for my students we're just focusing on the hour of code as if this is our first check off with with coding so we're not gonna worry about too much of that right now if you do have questions about pacing and how to roll out coding beyond the hour of code I encourage you to check out our backtoschool webinar that we had um in August that's archived on our YouTube channel you can also reach out to us anytime at support at codable comm we are always you know happy to answer questions without implementing CS you know how to choose the correct pacing for your students and whatnot um so for this I'm going to choose to assign game content based on what I'm going to be teaching the week of the hour of code so first to make sure that we're all on the same page I'm going to make sure that we go over some of our lessons you can see like what are some of the game options that we have so the IRF code so I'm going to go to lesson library and this this is where you can find all of the lessons that we have available in codable not just what's available to your class based on their grade so say you were working with kindergarteners but you wanted to have some supplementary lessons in there you could come to our lesson library and pick out some lessons and then save those to your class and they'll be available on your class page so I'm going to view our hour of code lessons and to start I'm going to take a look at our our pre reader pizza party um so this is like my first algorithm this is a this is a lesson kind of going over some math concepts it is common core math aligned a CSTA aligned and it is aligned to our computer science standards it's a three day project it's inquirybased it's gonna be focusing on some math vocab some very basic computer science vocab and getting kids really thinking about algorithms and putting things into a correct sequence and it has some some fun videos and things for you to check out with your kids and this was created in collaboration with with front row and you'd find all of the materials here you can see download resources you can see all of the vocabulary you can see the agenda for each day so you know what what you should be saying to them to kind of introduce the project um but let's go to a more basic um lesson let's take a look at our hour of code beginner for kindergarten so this is what we would be introducing this is actually one of the very first hour of code lessons that we ever created and it's a great place to get started if you're just a beginner if your students are a beginner or beginners it kind of outlines like you know what is a programmer what is programming language and how can we write some code to make a robot and robot being a volunteer from your class to make a robot move and you come up with a language together you write the language on the board you you put the correct the commands in the correct sequence and you kind of go from there and it's really fun and collaborative and kinesthetic everybody's engaged and excited and laughing inevitably the robot is gonna make a mistake or you as programmers they're going to make a mistake and it's just really fun to kind of see exactly how specific you need to be when you're coding and you can see just like all of our other lessons this is all scripted you can go off the script or you can kind of in you know come up with what you want to say on your own improvise and that's our that's the activity that you do together um and then you would go into independent practice now any lesson where there are game levels available for that lesson it's going to say in the independent practice section students will complete Smee board sequence sector levels one point one to one point five and one two three roll so these are the game levels that go along with this lesson so after you've done that fun activity together you can actually have them go onto their devices and and practice sequencing in codable I'm so really reinforcing everything that you just learned together as part of the lesson you know you went over the vocabulary you learned about programming you learned about what is sequence why do we put code in the correct order and then they can practice it in the game with the first family like we talked about so I'm gonna go ahead and show you um I'm gonna save this lesson to my class that we just created so there we go okay to five codable our code 2017 there it is okay and now I need to assign this game content to my students so it was me pork and it's this one two three roll just like it said on the on the lesson so I'm gonna go ahead and assign one two three roll and I'm gonna choose my class couple our cook 2017 assign and there we have it it is assigned to my class now you say okay I've got everything set up I've got my lesson plan um you go to my class and do my lesson plan real quick you can see I have a lot of classes here's my lesson plan I'm gonna do the hour of code beginner lesson for kindergarten I'm gonna go ahead and download this lesson plan print it out for myself so I'm all prepared for the day of and then when I'm ready when I'm ready to have kids sign in I'm gonna use this class code so the class code that I created that was webinar it was supposed to be 2017 but it says looks like it's 217 that's ok um I'm gonna have students log in with that class code if I wanted to edit this I could I'm not gonna get into the details of how to do that right now but you can edit your class code later if you need to so you have a typo just like me um so I'm gonna go ahead and show you how you get students logged in so you can click this link actually and that's a direct link to your class so I can see my roster right here you can copy and paste this URL if you want to have kids logging in directly to their roster if you're coming from our hour of code page which a lot of you will be doing um it's game codable comm / our code you're gonna see this website and you want to have your kids click play with class or student code and we're gonna enter your class code and it is webinar 217 and there you have it it's that simple my rosters right here I'm gonna go ahead and sign in MOU I have some new fuzz's um and all your students are going to need to do is click play and that will automatically take them to the first level that has been assigned to your students so we assigned a lesson one two three role and this is the first lesson in that assignment and for those of you who aren't familiar with codable this is the very beginning of the world where they are introduced to the fuzz is that these guys they're gonna collect lots of these characters and what they're gonna start by doing is just putting see the man's in the correct sequence and it starts off really simply like this one now we have forward down forward um and it's really good to go over you know the sequence with your students but it's going to scaffold up from this and become much more complicated they're gonna start having to think critically kind of work together collaborate talk about what their what their solution is how you can have multiple solutions to many mazes and it gets really fun and engaging and then codable will automatically take them to the next lesson um so I'm gonna go ahead and pause go back to our menu here um and while I'm in potable I can go ahead and show you all some of the things that are new in codable for this year so that's just one lesson that I showed you all the the robot where we're introducing programming to them but we do have a lot of other options available on our hour of code page I'll go ahead and show you some of those real quick and just so you know what I'm talking about this is codable comm rush hour of code you can see here we've got a women in tech past present and future this is a three day project asking students to kind of examine generate and equal dinner gender sorry gender inequality and technology in you know thinking about the problem this problem from a variety of perspectives and is ela comic or ela CSTA and elementary computer science standards aligned so you're gonna be checking a lot of boxes with these types of of lessons we have some beginner coding lessons we have some advanced coding lessons all available by grade we have some ela so choose your own adventure you know kids are going to end up chooseyourownadventure lesson while exploring the idea of sequence and why it's important to put things in order as well as condition so if I do this then this will happen if I make this choice and something else will happen it's super fun very fun project we have some introduction to coding with reading activities so some of them are reading some of them are some short writing assignments we have my first algorithm math pizza party that I showed you earlier we have a fourth and fifth grade and half the pizza party project that you can do it was made in collaboration with front row and then what I'm most excited about this year is actually our I don't know if you all may not know this but I'm actually the designer of codable I design all of the fuzzies I design all of the levels basically anything you have seen and codable I most likely designed it so naturally I'm most excited about our introduction to game design and maze maker challenge this year we have put together a selfguided lesson for your students that is common core math aligned kids are gonna be doing they're going to be practicing some geometry grade level geometry concepts while trying to design mazes for the four other kids in the class so we'll view this lesson okay and all you need to do is set kids up in codable just like we did you know I created a class and I logged them in and if you take them to the maze maker which I'll show you exactly how to get there you can find the instructions on how to access Mia's maker in this lesson they're going to be practicing each of these Common Core math concepts and it basically is set up to take them as far as they can go so you can challenge them say complete as many of these challenges as you can and you know it's kind of fun and competitive and you can see you know you can actually see them learning you know how to divide a square into four equal parts or to show the line of symmetry in a maze that they design so it's pretty fun and this is all accessible in quotable so I'll go ahead and show you that real quick and so we're back in the game logged in as a student we're gonna go ahead and go to my maze oh sorry my my ship um and you can see there's a mission alert and it says hour of code so I'm gonna go to that and this is our very first an hour of code maze maker challenge so I'm gonna draw a square now students may want to you want to may wanna have them familiarized with how codable works before this so they might need to know about the mazes a little bit to know um how to create their first names but um they can basically design their own maze now so I'm gonna choose a background and I'm gonna start drawing a square there it is and I would encourage your students to get creative with this like if they want to make a square and turn it into smiley face that's totally acceptable if they want to you know make a square in a different way I don't know encourage them to be creative it's all about creativity when it comes to design so you have you know your overall objective but you also have the freedom to kind of have creative expression so I'm going to place my stars and then I need to test my level and make sure that it's solvable so now I'm going to enter the solution yay awesome I created mace and I have my first trophy for my hour of code names maker design challenge um and then I have opened up the second challenge we have six maze maker challenges they get pretty complicated you'll see in the and the lesson but I would encourage your students to just go for it give it a try um once a maze is created you can actually share it within the class so um you can go to your muses and you can see your class and now i can see mo has shared it's automatically shared i have shared my level or my my maze with the rest of my class if other kids in my class were to create mazes they would all show up here too um and you can play them like so if I was not know and I was you know playing as John I could play most level um and then I can favorite it and I can give it show it some love you can even you know use it as inspiration and modify it and then save it again for other kids to play so it gets pretty exciting and collaborative um one other thing that I want to show you guys that's new for the hour of code this year um is our main art builder and fuzz so you may you know you are familiar with our sizes we have all these different characters we have some special edition fuzzes that you may have earned um last year if you were using codable Ada Lovelace and Alan Turing are some famous historic computer scientists that we were inspired by them and made them a part of our close family so um as students go through they're gonna unlock more characters but they're also oh if there further along and codable are going to be able to build their own buzzes so I'll go ahead and log into one of my other accounts so you can see what that looks like okay so I'm going to log in it's my famous class and cut and show you so if you're in your ship I can build buzzes I'm gonna name my buzz and I can get for a body I'm gonna get some eyes and a mouth modify these properties want her to be read I want her to have brown eyes and I want her to have a inquisitive look um and then I wouldn't give her a bow actually I'm gonna change this up how about a flower crown that's sweet and some glasses she's gonna have pink glasses and this is my buzz and you can encourage students to so this is all JavaScript right here and we've got some methods some some functions we've got a class of fuzz class we've got some different properties that were modifying so these are all things that we cover in our more advanced lessons um that's why we eight require students to complete more codable to unlock this feature but if you do want to get into some more advanced coding with your kids this is something that's really fun allows them to be creative kind of engage with codable create their own character and then they can play with this character that they've created and continue to modify it I'm gonna save my files and there she is and now I can play with Gretchen sighs so those are some of the things that are brandnew for the hour of code this year one other thing that I want to remind everyone of is that there is not going to be a save progress option if you are playing without a class code so we do have the option from our hour of code page go back to this all of our hour of code content can be used and played with without creating an account so if you are having your students log in they actually don't need they can play without saving and they do not need to have an account you don't have to create a class to get them started if you're just doing it for this week go for it um you know that's awesome that's great we want you to have the option to do that oh but if you do want to save their progress come back to this not have to have them do the same thing over again if it's something that you're considering going beyond our code with I do encourage you to log in create an account and set up a class because that's going to be the way for you to save their progress beyond just this week um and you'll also be able to access all of these lessons from your class or from your dashboard like I showed you in the lesson library you can save any of these lessons to your class all of this will be accessible from from an account yeah so really that's the only difference this year we we did have a save and exit option last year but with so many kids we are so thankful there are so so many kids using codable said unfortunately we're not able to save programs for everyone it would just break everything so oh we've just decided to make it the option to play quotable if you want to start again after you come back in January you're more than welcome to do that I'm decorating a class and going from there so one other thing I want to be sure to bring everyone's attention to its certificates for your students so it's really exciting the hour of code is really a magical week kids get so engaged parents get engaged um you know people in you know in the school community can engage the you know might not normally hear from and so it's really nice to have an option to send something home with kids you know showing that they've accomplished something really cool they completed the hour of code we have a certificate of certificate of completion you can enter your email address here and we'll send it to you you can add students names to it and present it to them at the end of the week so yeah and then the last thing is please be sure to share your experience with us we love honestly this is our most favorite week of the year we basically put everything else down and just focus on taking care of support questions talking to people going to schools doing hangouts with classes talking about what's happening this week we're gonna be going to the big you know kickoff event with code.org this year so we're really excited and a big part of that experience for us is here and you know what you guys are doing what you're experiencing what your students are experiencing so please be sure to share with us what's happening use hashtag kids can code or at codable and we'll see it and we'll be sure to respond to as many of you as we can um and and share your experience with others too so thank you so much oh and if you do have questions as you're kind of setting up your account we have a Help Center and you can find that here it's just support quotable calm um then one last thing I want to be sure to get to before we get into questions is at pricing some of you could ask questions about pricing it's not really what we had intended for this webinar to be about but I didn't want to be sure to address some of the questions that you guys had so um there is actually a brandnew option we just created it kind of with the key hour of code in mind we have a game only access plan for just 600 dollars this gives you access to all of codable um all of the game content it does not give you access to the lesson plans and you are paid lesson plans but it is going to give you access for your entire school for unlimited students for the year so this is our most affordable option it's for many people less than a dollar a student so um we do get a lot of great support from principals and from other administrators so if this is something that you're interested in and you have questions about feel free to reach out to us at support at code Volcom or you can check it out on your teacher dashboard on your account page we have some other options available if you're looking to purchase the curriculum but again that's not really the point of this webinar and if you do have questions you can feel free to email us and we will set up a conversation um all right let's get to questions I kind of zoomed through everything um so I'm sure that there are questions let's see first up here I have is there an app my kids can start can just scan to get in a look like a QR code I guess it's hard for first graders to enter a series of letters and to even get to the site yeah you can use our QR code scanner on iPads so if you're gonna be using the web version like I showed you you have that unique URL that's gonna take you directly to the class roster but if you're using iPads we have the option to use a QR code so I'm back on class dashboard and you can actually see show class QR code if you put put put this up on your smart board or if you want to print it off you can do that I'm share it with the class they can scan this on their iPad and it will open it will save the class to your iPad also once a class is saved on an iPad you don't ever have to enter it again it saves it forever until you delete it um what is the most important thing we need to be teaching our younger students thinking prek kinder I would say stick with the basics I mean they're learning about their letters the similar idea in computer science you don't want to get too complicated so just learning about sequence why is it important that we do things in order and you'll find in a lot of our lessons we tie this to some realworld examples like washing our hands what is the order of you know the sequence that we follow and we wash my hands what are some other things that we have to do in order and really understanding like it's important to put commands in a correct in the correct order in order to complete a task also can conditions and these are things that are good for kinder and first grade if you're working with prek stick with just sequence you're gonna find that um those arrows learning right left up down just putting things in order as can you take you a significant amount of time so I think that'll be plenty what is the benefit of signing in so we already kind of went over this your progress is going to be saved you're going to be able to access quotable later I'm gonna stop sharing my screen so you can see me Here I am um this code will work on Android not currently it's only iOS and web and put any web browser will work so game code Volcom or game code Volcom slash hour of code how do I connect coding to realize many of our lessons like I talked about with washing your hands and things like that have realworld connections and actually every lesson that we offer has an offscreen portion so we're really big on offscreen learning for elementary especially with the lower elementary it's just a great way to kind of tie coding into like a tangible example it's easy for them to relate to and so like I said you'll find good old world connections in just about every lesson why am I getting a server error issue and my students tried to log in a lot of times this is a firewall issue we have a support center article about how to fix it and that is that support code Volcom and you can check out the troubleshooting section how do I introduce quotable to a group of students my first graders are having difficulty understanding how to work beyond the basic levels um I would say that it sounds like perhaps your kids are moving ahead in codable beyond just what they know like is suitable for a first grader like we showed you that pacing at the beginning um I think perhaps it might be helpful to unassign some of that game content to come back a little bit and just kind of go over some of the lessons covering the concepts that they're struggling with making sure that they are seeing you know understanding vocabulary understanding why we're doing this on screen what does it mean to use these colored blocks you know if I do this then that will happen a lot of times the first graders you hear about them getting tripped up on conditions and loops if they haven't really been exposed to the why behind the what we're doing so what is appropriate coding instruction for each grade level K to five that is a pretty longwinded question or sorry longwinded answer um I would say the best way to find what's appropriate for students at each grade level is to take a look at our suggested pacing you can find this in our Help Center at support codable comm and then what will students learn and this is going to give you a year one pacing suggestion so if your kids have not done any coding before you're starting from scratch that's where you want to check it out if your kids have been using codable for a year or if this is your second or third year we have a your your two and beyond pacing that's also on that on that page that you can take a look at can students log into codable with their Google accounts no they need to use the class code or their student code or they use the code Volcom slash hour of code login to play without saving option well i be able to watch this webinar after thursday night yes you can come back to this link any time and it will be archived here thanks to our lovely friend youtube how do I add a coteacher to a free code ball account I've created accounts for a kid one teachers to get ready for the hour of code the kids love it yeah I'm so glad and I think the teachers and they want to continue coding throughout the school year so for a free account it's not possible to link with other teachers within your school um you have this option if you have a paid account so if you're on a game access plan or our school curriculum plan you have the option to be the admin and invite teachers to link and then they can have access to their class but it is not an option or free accounts unfortunately mmm Kim student saved their progress throughout the week if so how oh I see if they don't have if they're playing from the our code page progress won't save if you are logging them in with a class code that progress saves automatically so anytime they're playing with with a class code no matter what device if that device hat is connected to the internet that progress has uploaded to us and the next time they log in it's going to be saved again if they're not if it's not connected to the Internet when the device does connect to the internet it's going to upload that progress so as long as it eventually connects to the Internet we're gonna have that progress saved for you are all online features available on iPads yes the web and iPad version of codable are identical is it possible to have students share an iPad and record progress pair programming is something we definitely encourage so much fun it's a great it's a whole nother lesson learning how to collaborate for the peer how to communicate about what you're doing on screen and something we definitely encourage and progress will only be saved for the account that they are playing on so if they're playing if Susie and Bobby are playing together and they're playing on Susie's account Susie's progress will be saved obviously Bobby wasn't logged in so it's not going to save us nothing has happened on Bobby's account um sorry I keep losing my place um is there a way to automatically provide students in each class with a link to their codable web page through Google classroom or other yes you can bookmark that URL that is there on your roster for any class so if you want to save that URL and attach it to your classroom website we definitely encourage that it's a super way to get kids signed on quickly once all of the amazing codable skills have been mastered by our students that's a great way of raising question I love it what would you recommend as the next steps for them to pursue on the road to develop in computer programming skills excellent I would suggest if you are looking into middle school code HS is an excellent option for middle and high school to start learning some JavaScript API Java we've got a number of different courses available there's also a lot of options out there for learning written code we start introducing syntax to students at the end of codable starting at 4th and 5th grade 3rd 4th and 5th grade so they should be familiar with what syntax looks like I would encourage you to move away from things that are all block based or don't have any syntax if they have been exposed to some syntax and they're ready to start programming start looking at some options that are out there to help them get familiar with that there's a lot of great tools introducing JavaScript JavaScript that's why we chose it it's one of the most widely used languages in the world so I would encourage you to throwing some great drop free JavaScript tools and start getting them into that you can do you can create games you can create action create website there's so many different things you can do with JavaScript so basically it's a cheese you're an adventure type thing find out what they're interested in and give them some resources to explore what is the best resource for funding codable I'm using the free lessons but I want more smiley base yes I'm teaching a coding Club just one hour a week in pool so the school district / school is not funding my program at this time um I would suggest you taking a look at our our funding resources document on our support page support koco.com again um I would also encourage you to talk to your PTA parents are super into coding they are very supportive I think it's like 9 out of 10 parents want their school to be teaching it and we need to tell me like 40 percent of schools are so um I would really encourage you to talk to your PTA the other thing is to encourage more teachers at your school to start coding if you want quotable the best way to get an administrator to take notice into things and it's worthwhile to purchase is to get more people on board so teachers are some of the best salespeople I've ever met they are great advocates for things they love talk to other people model for them show them what happy engagement that's happening and why you love it and I'm sure you'll see some some teachers take take Holden and start using it for classes if they're an online store where I can buy quotable merchandise tshirts hats plush buzzes oh I wish but no not yet how to modify for students with special needs or ESL students so this is not our area of expertise I'll start by saying that I'm just my desk so you can see my whole face um but we do have a lot of people that use codable for these students um since there are so many different possibilities I would say it's hard for us to say exactly how but we have seen it works really well with Yale students with students with autism especially we hear a lot for encouraging communication among peers because they get so excited when they win we make beat a level when it works really hard um you can touch encourage them to talk about it I'm asking did you do how did you do that tell me tell me what you came up with what was your solution um and just listen to them um and I've seen that firsthand in a classroom and it was beautiful so an encourage that what is the lowest grade level this is appropriate for we recommend kindergarten but we do have a lot of people use football in prek we started with kindergarten um that's really our area of expertise and we moved up from there but prek students the motor skills sometimes aren't quite ready for it the logic is all there but I'm learning to drag and drop on an iPad a little bit difficult for them as well as if you're using a browser doing a trackpad or using your mouse is going to be challenging so something that you can do is some pair programming with older older students that is so fun having the younger ones explain what to do to the older ones is a blast so I would encourage that how do we print certificates we went over the certificates enter your email address and you will receive a link and that's how you print them best way to set up multiage classrooms I have the gifted and talented kids here range and grades from cage five my class that I set up was a k2 five spacing I would encourage you to setup the same and then kind of go from there take a look at our pacing guide decide what's going to be appropriate for your students usually gifted talented classes it's more of a individual basis so if you want to kind of open things up for them and let them move at their own pace that's definitely something that is available to you is there a Help button who kids don't know how to move forward I know but I'm a huge fan of s3 than me my favorite teaching tool so encourage kids to talk to other students then I can't find the solution talk to you and if a lot of kids are having trouble on a certain level it's a great opportunity to take a look at why we're having this problem what can we do together to solve it I'm having a conversation of our problem solving and then if it is you know like our question earlier multiple kids we're having trouble perhaps it's time to stop and then take a look at some of the lessons and see where we were wrong and how we can really encourage them to understand more about the concept how do I set up K in first grade classes they're not allowed to use student names or any identical and I didn't identifiable data you are free to use any identifier that you want so if you want to have them come up with user names we don't technically we don't store any of that information it's only what you give us so if you want to come up with user names for your students if they have a student code or they have like something that they use with other programs we definitely encourage you to use that you something that you have permission to share but we do not share any data we don't even look at any data honestly as though we use our our student codes so what would be considered a successful error of code I think it looks up to you I I think that if you feel like you kind of challenged yourself came out of your comfort zone tried something new you had students engaged and talking and you know that buzz that's in a classroom when learning is happening I think that that is success but honestly if it goes for more than just the hour of code if you go beyond CS ed week that is what I think we're all trying to accomplish here is to get more schools engaging with computer science education taking it beyond an hour of code because an hour is not enough really it needs to be something that's happening throughout the year because this is gonna be a part of our kids future forever you know there's going to be more and more jobs created more and more jobs lost to automation because of you know technology so I really encourage you to bring computer science into as many lessons as you can and I think that you'll find our lesson library really helpful for that there's a lot in there for integrative lessons so yeah I hope that you see this as a jumpingoff point and not just a onetime thing okay I'm going to take a look and see you have any questions in our live chat I believe John has been handling that like a pro and don't see any questions I see something awesome conversations um but yeah so I think that's everything um but if you do have any questions you're getting into it please feel free to reach out to us support equitable calm is your number one resource our Help Center has a ton of information our twitter is pretty lively at codable on twitter or hashtag kids can code we're really quick to respond there a lot of the times yeah and like I said next week we're going to be monitoring our support Channel pretty much that's all we're going to be doing so you should hear from us really quickly if you have any issues or questions um and yeah please feel free to reach out I'm so excited to hear how it goes from everyone so don't forget to share with us I take lots of photos if you can um you can't tell us a story no tell us something that happened that was really exciting for you or for a student and I'm and please share them with us in social media or by email I'm Gretchen GRE see.htm act code will calm and again support at code Volcom goes for our entire team so thank you so much and have a wonderful hour of code all right thanks everyone
