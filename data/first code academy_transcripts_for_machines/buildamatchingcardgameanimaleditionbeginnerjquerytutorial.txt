hello everyone welcome back to our channel here you share between your friendly coding tutorials on scratch roblox minecraft web programming and many more so today we are going to create a card matching game with jquery so for this project we're just going to match the cards with the same animals inside if not it would just become incorrect so before i start just to let you know that jquery is a library that is part of the javascript for this everything is written in shortboard to follow along there is a starter code available for this project in which you can find in the description box below so let's get started okay so moving on to our coding part we can see that inside html css and gs there is already some builtin functions and there's a like um some of them already planned out all we have to do is actually fill in the blanks and inside css we're just going to create two new classes so moving on to our html first uh there are three classes um three of the classes actually represent the right result the wrong result and after we won the game so let's get started right first out wrong result for the class and one result that so all right next thing we're going to do is actually put the headings inside so what's the words inside so correct represents the right result incorrect represents the wrong result okay you won okay we finished our html class uh we can move on to our css so inside css we'll start with the part first uh we set our position to relative border is just going to be 10 pixels sorry double black width and height is going to be 300 by 200 and background color is just going to be gray so bb color is just going to be white so fff does play which is going to be flex justify content center as well as the align items so center all right so for the font size which is going to be 100 pixels for how vertical and margin is going to be five pixels float left cursor pointer okay we finished our cart class now we're going back we're going to our result able class our coordinate events screen is just going to be none and then cursor is just going to be um this we're going to just all out and not allowed so not allow for a cursor okay when our when we open our card we want to set our background color to white and our color just going to be red and box shadow which is going to be zero zero five pixels with the color grey like that and yeah so inside our result uh we want uh the z index is going to be two and then right color just going to be green ash color i'm just going to decide it's a line since it's like correct so and then for the wrong uh we're just going to do red and then the one color we're just going to set it to green okay so we finished all the blanks uh all we have to do now is actually create two more classes um one class is called cart dot dot car img which is the image of the car so we're just going to set position to relative and with a hundred percent height hundred percent and object fit oh contain says play block that all right so we finished our card img the last class we're going to create which is the headings class uh we're just going to set it something with these so h1 right so for our h1 what we want to do is to set up the display to none and margin zero margin okay this is position absolute margin top 10 left us 30 font size that's 100 pixels nope and font family ariel text shadow two pixels and then two pixels and then black like that so we finished uh our css part okay so after all these uh we can move on to our javascript which is the jquery part so inside javascript um we have um some of the functions generate cards card controls like that we're just going to uh play with these two functions so to begin um inside our generic cards um there's already a condition which is um well for i equal to zero i smaller than live cards.length um are i just going to add by one so which is like the card's number uh for the course number it's just going to be 12 so as long as it's smaller than 12 and we're just going to add our card so we're just going to display the cards inside our game so the first line uh for our new card um this one is just going to be definitive so oops okay so for the text since uh every card is like a mystery for uh the players we're just going to set it to the question mark before it's flipped over and then the class is just going to be card and we're gonna add a new class for that and then the second one the attributes the cards i like that so this one is just going to be data animal so we can actually put our animals inside the card and then for the next thing uh which is like the elements id of the cards all right so we're just going to name it name it as id and then for the new card append to uh we're just going to set it as body right so we've finished our generate cards already so moving on we can actually go to our crotch control so first of all uh inside our cards control uh we have a variable card one and card two um inside our also which is like cartwheel cartridge actually the cards that we wanted to flip over with so yeah so quite wounding card too so uh inside this uh we have a con on click function so this function is like actually when you click on the card something which is gonna happen uh well we have two conditions uh we have to meet these two conditions before we click and then the car flip over so the first condition is uh if there's any car if there's any class in that inside this cloud is that inside the card so which means if there's like um well if there's a card already opened with that so we're just going to get the open class like that if there's a open class so and then the second one uh as a length so if the link okay so if there's no class open uh for the card we're just going to determine the second thing if uh the card length is just like smaller or equal smaller or equal to one so if there's only one card open like that uh if these two conditions met we're just going to add a new class better class and then open and then of course we have to oh whatever okay of course we have to do that this okay this class open like that so and then the second thing uh we're going to do is actually uh we're going to push our part to be like open it right like that so that's why we can do this again and then attribute oh and then we can get the data animal okay so for our card image we're going to create a new variable for saving the datas so we're just going to get the animals and then this attribute data and like that so this is the chronology so the next thing we're going to do is to if there's like two cards open we're just going to check if they are having the same value so this is for checking if that's the same value so which is checking to image so which is that's why image src oh no not yet equals and then okay so fine mg so which is the variable we created earlier so and then oh and then and then i'm just going to get the closing bracket and that's it all right so that's it i have to double check for the brackets sorry about that okay moving on to the um next condition if the open length is equal to uh which is when there's two cards open we have to check if they have the same card or they're not having the same card so now um we're just going to make the open well to get too variable the cartridge is going to get the uh array of opened uh we're just going to get a server index and uh the second one just going to differ they're going to be the first index so like that so if part one is circle part two we just write so we're just going to get the right um class from css and then we're just going to show something and then theta which is going to be slow so instead of popping up of nowhere okay so the next thing we're going to do uh we're just going to after it sounds like it's correct we wanted to remove the card inside our arraylist and move on to our next steps so car so card again plus again we're going to remove the class disable that like that okay so well uh the next thing we're going to check is to uh check if the length is equal to 12 which is actually um the like one one function so if actually uh 12 of the cards is already opened um so card dot open like that so if card.open oh so car dot open length is equal to 12. uh we're just going to get the one class from css and we're just going to make it into slow for fade out again else so if that's the wrong thing so which which is like either of these uh condition is wrong as false we're just going to set it to wrong and fade out is also slow oh i'm using the full stop slot like that okay so uh okay so inside the set timer function uh we're just going to set our timer to after one second uh we're just going to flip our wrong parts and we're just going to remove our open and we're just going to set back our cards to question mark if we put the wrong cards so remove our class and set back to question mark same for the second card and that all right so uh we of course we have to remove our class too so far a move class disable so yeah that's it so for our shuffle uh actually we finish everything for the actual shuffle uh function and yeah that's it uh we can now try it out for our game let's drag this up okay we can see all the cards here showing up everything all right there are some buggy things happening so it's great now i can see it up see what happens inside my gs so well in some ideas uh definitely something's wrong so let's check open push this oh yeah spell a mistake that's always the bug that i come through okay so now we can try okay that works right now okay so yeah that's correct and then now i can move on to links up okay it's incorrect let's see okay ah okay all right so probably this one oh know so frog and then lastly mouse so that's it that's actually the game uh we finished our game and this is the result so that's a pretty great in this general room we created a card matching game with the use of jquery jquery is a mini library of javascript which allows you to write code but in a more quicker and simple fly way hope you like this video don't forget to subscribe and like our videos also check out these
