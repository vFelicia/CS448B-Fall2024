hello everybody and welcome back to our channel here we share beginner friendly coding tutorials on scratch roblox minecraft web programming and many more today we're going to create a movie slider webpage here's a preview to the project we'll be making today at the top left we have the name of our website on the right we have our navigation bar as you can see we have list categories series anime and search and here we have the main project where we have a slider that shifts our movie pictures and whenever we hover over one of the pictures it tells us a title um some description and a watch button so let's get started so for this project we have provided a template for you to follow along here in templates we have our basic logo where you can insert a picture for your movie slider if you want and the name of our project followed by a navigation bar containing start categories list series anime and the search and you can see it over here these are the items in our list and this will make up our navigation bar so to start out with let's insert some links inside of our categories so we can add any categories as long as they're inside of this link so we can just insert anything in here and we can also include the link when we do have it so here i've gone ahead and installed and inserted all the categories for this project so here as you can see i've added animations actions and all of these categories inside of our links and you can see it under here as well in our project preview so now let's go down to our list and add our list here we want to add movie list series list and animate list and that will be all the list inside of our list and as you can see again we have everything here and now we can kind of ignore this part as it is the code for our search bar and as you can see here it ends our navigation bar and a header and we move on to our slider which is the main part of the project so in our slider we have a couple things so each movie is inside of slider popular movies and movie container and with each movie we have three different things we have to add so the first thing is the movie image and here we have left the image source for us to add our image and here we have a movie title which we should insert a movie title in and the descriptions also we can provide the link for the user to click on and we have added the word watch so that you can click on the word watch and it will bring you to the sites where you can watch the movie so once again i've added the movies i wanted to add so over here if you look at the html we can see that i've added a picture the title and description for each movie and there are total of ten so i've added guardians of the galaxy one and two added spiderman and many more and again you can follow the structure and add any movies you want so you want to add the picture of the movie inside the source of image source change the name of the title in the h2 tag and under the paragraph you want to add the description and finally when we look down we have our footer here we don't have to change anything as this kind of just explains everything for us and um that will conclude our html section so now as you can see in our preview we have our pictures but when we cover the picture the name of the movie description and the button is not visible so let's program my css to do that as well as lining these up and making a slider so the first thing we want to do is actually change the whole website and add some css to this so to do this we simply plus star and anything inside the star will be applied to the whole web page so here we want to allow some kind of border around our pictures and overall web page so we do box sizing and we set it to border box next we want to do the fonts so we can change the font by writing font family and we're just going to use um her vitica as our fonts and now we just want to set the default values for padding and margin to zero just like so now let's do a css on our body so let's type body and inside of our body what we want to do is set the background to black so here we can do background and we can simply use zero zero zero and that will be black and now we want to set the margin to automatic set the max width to 110 and then change the width to 90 following that let's do our length paragraphs and list options so that we can change the css for these um links so to do that we can include links paragraphs and our list inside of the same css so in here we want to change the color and we're going to change it to hash fff which will return it white next we want to change the style of the list i'm going to change it to inside that way we can't see the list until we hover over it and then text declaration we want to change it to 0 to remove the underlines we want to change the z index to 1 so that it is never behind the screen and you know behind some kind of pictures and it will be the first thing that is popped up and finally is increase the font size to 10 pixels so here we can add individual properties to our length paragraph and our list um but we only going to do that to the links so that we can actually um personalized it so the first thing we're going to do is do display to block and then we're going to add some padding of 10 pixels and 15 pixels so now you can see this is uh more spaced out next let's go to our header and program our header inside of a header we want to set the margin to auto and set the width to 100 now let's style our border and our navigation bar so let's do nav and inside of our navigation bar we want to type border bottom we're going to type one pixel solid and add a color and here we have picked out 2 1 b7 e5 let's change the display to flux and let's set the display to flux and turn the justify content to space between just like so and so you can see you'll push everything to the right side and add a line a blue line at the bottom of our navigation bar and now we want to do some kind of styling on the title of our screen so let's do that so we can access it by accessing the class in which we put it in which is local instead of local you can do the display change it to table and we can change the background and we say corn flower blue just like so next let's style our navigation bar links so that they're not all you know just scrolling down and you know have a whole list of things so to begin with we shall do nav and we're going to point to the unordered list here we want to set the display to inline flex and then change the position into a reflective or relative and change and change the position to relative and remember this navigation is consistent an order list but inside of each one our list so let's style that individually so we can do that by tapping into the unordered list to the list here we want a transition for all at 200 milliseconds and we're going to add a webkit of transition and again we're going to do all at 200 milliseconds and here our cursor should be the pointer and the display should be in the form of a table so now we have side of this let's uh make it so when we hover it it will actually show some colors so here we can do nav under the list list hover and here we can change the background once again the corn flower blue awesome so now we want to change the class inside of genre which is everything underneath our categories to do that we do now under the list list and inside we want to select genres and here we want to set the overflow to auto and the height to be 500 pixels so now we have a cap and at 500 pixels but um when it overflows it will automatically add scroll bar for us so we can scroll down so now let's dial the stuff in here so to do that we do nav unorder list list and unorder list here we want to set the display to none and the position to absolute just like so and now you can see that things are hidden from us so now we need a way to show it back and to do that we can do math under the list list hover and this is specifically for the unordered list and then form as well as form because we want the search bar to appear as well here we're going to set display to block we can set the background to black and we can set the position to absolute so now as you can see when we hover over the text of categories the list of categories appears same with list and our search bar so now let's actually do some css on the hover so here we have a nav under the list list an order list and these are links so we can say a slash hover and we can change the background color by doing background and let's do the same colors before as 2 1 b7 e5 so as you can see when we hover over these uh links the blue background will show finally let's change our search bar so that it will be relative and won't get pushed to the corner like it is right now to do that we do dot search and we're just gonna set the position to relative now let's do our forms which is where we are going to put in the text box let's do form we're going to add a border at the top that's one pixel thick solid and once again we want to add the same blue color so 2 1 b7 e5 we want to set the position to absolute and add some padding so we're going to add 10 pixels and 15 pixels and now we're going to change the display to flux and add more padding to the right by 100 pixels or negative 100 pixels and we're going to add padding to the right with a negative 100 pixels now let's program our slider so we can do this by dot slather and in here we just want to add a margin of 10 pixels all around and the width of 95 after that we can edit the stuff inside of our slider the first stiff we should um style is movie container so dot movie container inside here we want to change the display your flux change to justify content the space between and add the width to 1200 pixels and as you can see our website is coming along nicely when we hover over our pictures we now show the title the paragraphs and the button so here we want the movie slider to slide whenever our mouse is not hovered over any pictures and stop the animation as soon as it is so when we hover the picture we want to stop the animation so we need to add dot movie slash container and hover and dot image dash effect just like so and here we want to do animation play state be pulsed that way we can stop the animation and now to add the actual animation for the slide we can use um an animation provided by css and we'll be adding this to the image effect so you can go to image effect animation dash play and now we want to add the animation for the actual slider so that it will actually move and slide our pictures and we'll do this in the image dash effect so inside of our image slash effect we can add an animation and this animation will be called the movie slider we want to add 10 second duration and we want to loop forever and add alternate linear and now we want to have overflow to be hidden so we won't you know the pictures won't go over our screens and now here you can see our movie slider is actually a function that we need to add because we haven't declared um an animation for that yet and to do that we use the keyword at keyframes movie slider and inside here we want to add our animations so at the start of the animation at zero percent we can add a margin of left of zero and a hundred percent we want to add the margin of left to be negative 100 and again at the zero percent we want to add the margin to the right to be negative a hundred percent and then a hundred percent when the animation is done we want to add the margin to the right to zero percent just like that so now you can see our movies are getting sliding the final part of the project involves editing and styling more of our image effect and movie image so here let's go to image effect and we're going to be targeting the image inside of image effect here we want to add a transition and we want to apply to all of them for 300 milliseconds and we're going to add a webkit of transition as all with 300 milliseconds so now as you can see we have our slider that shift the movies and as soon as we hover over any one of these the animations stop and it continues when we stop hovering over it so that's all for today today we learned how to make a webpage using html and css to shift our poster pictures across the screen as well as using hover to show the details of the movie hope you guys enjoyed be sure to subscribe and like our video and i'll see you guys next time thank you bye
