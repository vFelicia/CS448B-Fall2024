everyone so welcome to this tutorial in today's tutorial what we're going to make is a sword in minecraft and we're going to be using a program called m creator so in this tutorial you learn how to design sword you learn how to mod it with the software and then you'll learn how to use this sword in minecraft so let's begin what i have open is m creator and the first thing that we're going to make is a weapon so how do we design this we first click on the plus over here and once you click over here you can go all the way to tool click on that and then here you can write in the name of the tool so you can just call it say my custom weapon and click create youtube so over here we have tool texture and then we have make item globe so this part here is if you want to add in a picture of your design or if you would like to draw your design so what we're going to do is we can use the inbuilt texture creator and make one ourselves so we can go here and then we can just leave it at transparency leave the size at 16 and 16 for height and width and we can click on create so once we're here we can draw our two so what we can do first is we can change the shape if we like you can use a circle a ring or square so generally when drawing a square is better as it's easier to place and then here we can use the drawing tool and here you have the option of colors so you can pick any color you like so i'm just going to pick this color click ok and to draw the sword i'm just going to draw it from this way so i'll just start from here like this here i'm drawing the sword and i'm trying to make a design so i'm drawing it from bottom to top and then i'm adding the handles you can click save this texture and then here it will ask us what type of texture it is block item or other so we're just going to click on item and i'll just call this again my custom okay all right so invalid text so when that happens it means you click back on save click on item and then make it lower case right my custom so make sure your name is all in lowercase not uppercasing or not one is uppercase and one is lowercase okay so once or click that you've saved it then we can go back here click on this click on this and click select so this is the sword that i made so now the next thing i have to do is i can click on save mod element right so this is my weapon over here and then i can click it back on it and see if anything i want to change i don't want to put anything special and then here we leave it normal make item glow if you want to enable your item to glow you can do that then next we can click on properties so here we can check what do we want it to be used for since we're making it a weapon and click on combat and then the type we can pick on sword so over here we can change the attack speed to make it a bit higher if we put it 1.5 and then the damage we can change this to a bit higher maybe and then here blocks affected repair items we can leave that alone and then here does it stay in the crafting part we can leave this and then here it says damage item make sure to enable we can click on this and then next we can click on triggers so here if you wanted to do something you can start our mod that we've made so over here we can click on this play icon so once we click on this make sure it's green and then it'll start loading and then what will happen is minecraft will open so once this happens minecraft should start loading on your computer so this is a builtin minecraft with m creator here we click on multiplayer create a new and then you can make this creative then here you can just name this m creator world create new world once that happens your world will start loading so once our minecraft world is loaded right over here click on e let's see inventory and then we can type in the item so left in my and we have here the custom weapon that we made so if you're unable to break a block you can just put slash there you go that's how we make our mod and you can click save and then quit it and then it's saved inside your microphone now what we're going to make is a lollipop sword and what i have is an image and the image we can link it in the description below in this video how do we begin this project we click on plus over here and then we head to tools and then here we can just call this my funny sword then click create bluetooth once you're here the tool texture is where you can draw an item but we're going to use import so click on import and then once that opens what we're going to see is a box allowing us to select the image from our computer click it once again go to downloads and we're going to be using this here open and then we have the image right over here and then we can click select and that's where our item is here and then once that's done we can click on properties we can either have this as a tool or you can use it as a combat item and then here we can make it as a smooth and the rest of the details you can leave it and then damage item instead of crafting click yes then here we can leave this as this and then we can do the triggers since we're not going to use them we can just save the mod once that's done this is saved here and then to test it out we click on the play button here and that will open up our minecraft so i'll give it a second so once minecraft is loaded and we have this creative mode okay since we're here slash game there we have you can use this and if you want to break stuff slash and that's how we made our lollipop thank you guys very much for watching this
