hello everyone so today we're going to be making a scratch game and this game is called heart clicker so let's begin by making that game on scratch see you in a bit so this is the project that we're going to create it's called heart clicker so right here we have a title and then we have a button so when i click on the start button a bunch of hearts start falling from the top to the bottom and as i click them i start to gain points as you see here so the tapping is done by my mouse once my mouse is over the art i gain a point whenever i click on them that's a game and what it's using is a clone to create copies of these hearts and then it's randomly moving from left to right and dropping them from all the way from the top to the bottom and we're going to begin our tutorial first head to the scratch webpage and log in with your account the next procedure we need to do is click on create once you click on create it will open up to the page where you can start creating your project so once we're here the first thing we'd like to do is change the project name so we're going to call this heart clicker next we want to remove this cat as we won't be using it now in every game there's usually a background so the same thing is going to apply to our game we're going to add in two backgrounds so we're going to click on this and over here in the scratch library you can pick any color or any background that you like i am going to stick with a simple blue sky too and then to edit it i'm going to click on backdrops so i have a backdrop one which is blank but we're not going to use it so we click on it and press on the x so we have one over here so i'm going to rename this with start gain so that is my first backdrop then i'm going to duplicate this so right click and duplicate and i'm going to call this the game screen so start game is just what happens when we start our game game screen is where the main game is so as we began on this we would like now to add in text so you can click on this t and you can pick on any color that you like so i'll just stick with green and you can change your font styling to whatever you like i use marker here we're going to click on this page over here then we'll type in a heart now you may notice that the words are quite small not to worry you can click over here and just drag this like that and it makes the words much bigger and you can even drag it and position it so i'm just going to leave it in the middle next what we'd like to do is we'd like to add a button so most games have a start button we'd like to do the same here so we can head here click on choose a sprite and in this sprite library they actually have a button over here so click on this and then we can place this down over here you can click on costumes and you can delete the second button and here we're going to click on t again as we want to add in text and you can change the color over here so i'm just going to stick to blue and inside here i'll just type in all caps start if you're unhappy with the color you click on fill again make sure you highlight the word and then you can just change it so you can choose any color that you like say you want this you can leave it at that and just click over here once that's done you're good to go with this page if you want to change the size you can always go here and change it to maybe 200 you can make the button bigger and then place it over here so as we have our button we'd like to add some actions and to do that we need to add some coding blocks first we click on events and then we take out when sprite clicked so i'll make this a bit bigger so this block when spread clicked what this means is it's an event and in this event it only runs when we the user click on this button with our mouse so the next thing we do is we click on looks and we take out the hide block here because when we click on this block we want it to hide and then we wanted to change the backdrop to the game screen next is we click on the events and take out a green flag so this is when we click on the green flag that means when we start our game so when we start our game we want it to be seen and click on show scroll down here take out show next when we click on this here we want to show this background so we take out switch backdrop and we click on the start game which is here so click on this or here and then the next thing we want to do is make a variable so the variable we call this score score but when we start the game we don't want to see this score on top over here we want it to be hidden in order to hide that we have an option in variables you will see a height over here height variable and then you change this to score so when you click on this score variable is hidden the button is here the text is here in this background here once you click this you go to the next page so back to the backdrops here this is blue in color for this you can pick in any color you like i'm gonna click on the paint and you can select whichever color you want if you want yellow you can do yellow since it's a valentine sort of game i will go with a color of red here so after you've selected that color the next thing is we want to start our game and we want to add in our main character so the main sprite we're using is a heart you can click on choose a sprite here we can pick heart so with this heart here you can move this over here and click on costume and you have two options you can either click whichever one you want if say you want the purple heart you can keep that if you don't want the red heart you just delete it and you can keep the purple heart next we'd like to maybe decrease the size as the heart is quite big you can change this to 50 and if you still want it a bit smaller you can change it maybe to 45. so as we have our heart what we want to do here is that when we are on this background we want to show the score variable as our game is starting we click on events we take out the when backdrop switch to just increase this so as we know this is called game screen and then we click on variables and we take out the show variable so this is where we can see our variable score next we want to actually hide this heart so we click on looks and we use hide place this here next the thing is when we start a game with score as you know anytime you play any game our score starts with zero so the same thing has to be applied to this game too click on variables and we take out set my variable to zero and you can change this to set score to zero so now when we click this we notice there's a little issue when i start my game the heart has disappeared but when i click that the heart was just not there so in order to have the game start properly we can click on control and take out a wait until so now the heart is gone but since i had the height but then again my heart is hitting but i want to show a bunch of other hearts so what i can do is i click on this wait until and i keep it here and then i go to operator so an operator we have a equal sign here we can place this here and we can change this to number two so the reason why we're changing this to the number two is if we go back to our backdrops you'll see that number one is start game number two is our game screen so what we're telling this heart is that we'll wait until it's the second backdrop and to choose that you go to looks you scroll down you'll see background number and then you just add that here next we're going to take out a forever block as we want an action to be repeated continuously so we take out forever and what we'd like to happen is we wanted to create a clone so clone and scratch is where it makes a duplicate or in other words a copy of this heart so we scroll down and you shall see this block it's called create a clone of myself so when i click this we have said that we'll create a clone but now what we need to do is give it instructions as to what will it do when it becomes a clone so that is in the next part over here so you can bring this back up and then here we can take out when i start as a clone so this here is when our clones start to appear on our screen then we click on the forever block as we'll be using that we want all the actions inside here to continuously happen so first when we begin we want to see the clone so we scroll down here and take out show next what we'd like to do is we want the heart to go in a random position on our screen to do that we click on motion and we take out the go to x y block here then we click on operators and take out pick random now pick random is a block where it will randomly go anywhere if you give it a range so this is the smallest value this is the biggest value so we need two of these blocks so please make sure you take out two of them you can also duplicate them and paste them inside so for the xaxis it goes from negative 240 to 240. so we're gonna put that here negative two four zero two two four zero now for the y axis here we have a different value so that's going to be minus 180 to 180 so now that we've added this the heart will randomly move around the next action we'd like to take is that we want these hearts to go from the top and come all the way down and to do that instead of using a forever loop or a repeat loop we're going to use something called a repeat until so this block is used when we want an action to be repeated until a certain condition is met so we click on control take out this repeat until and what we're going to place here is we're going to repeat whatever action we put inside this block until this heart these hearts reach the edge so we're going to take out the touching here and we can change this to touching edge next what we'd like to do is click on motion and take out the change y as we want it to fall down and when anything goes from up to down on the axis that's on the y axis so here we have put change y but with a positive number it would go up so here's where we can make the game a little interesting we can take our pick random and we want the computer to pick a random number between negative 5 over here to negative 10. so the computer will pick a random number and the heart will move down slow or a bit more quicker and it will randomly happen with each and every clone next what we'd like to add is that if this heart is touching the edge we want it to disappear because we want more hearts to follow from the top so we want it to be a continuous process of hearts falling from the top coming down disappearing and then having more come from the top so we click on control and then we take out a if touching and we put this inside here so once again we're going to be using the same block if touching edge so we click on sensing take out if touching edge and place this here and then what we can do here is click back on control and then you will see a delete clone so your clone will be deleted so this is how our coding process has gone so far so the next thing we'd like to add is that in this game we want to make a score and how do we do that by clicking on these hearts so we can click on events take out the when this sprite click and then very simply you can head to variables take out your change my variable and change this to chain score by one so when we begin at this background we start at zero and then our main heart is hidden and then we wait until it changes to this backdrop and then we start creating clones of myself which is referring to the heart next when a clone is created it's shown it randomly goes according to the x and y axis range that we've added and then constantly until it reaches the edge it will keep on going from the top of the screen to the bottom and then whenever they touch the bottom they will be deleted and whenever our mouse is clicking on these hearts our scores change by one so let's check it out let's see if everything works well so we have hard clicker we have the background we have the button so we've added the button code here i'm saying that when we click on the sprite we want this to be hidden and we wanted to change the game screen and we've also said that when the game when we've clicked on the grid we've also said that when green flag clicked you want this button to be shown show the start game background and hide the variable so let's do that so there you have a bunch of hearts falling and they're cloning and they're falling from the top to the bottom and whenever you click them you get a score so i'm not the best at this game hopefully you guys are much better but this is the hard clicker game that we have created and if you want to restart the game no problem just click on the green flag we're back at the start point and this is the end of our tutorial so that's the end of the tutorial i hope you guys had fun if you like this video please make sure to like share and subscribe to first code academy for more fun
