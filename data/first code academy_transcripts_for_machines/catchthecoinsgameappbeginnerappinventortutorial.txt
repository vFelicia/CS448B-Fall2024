hello everyone welcome back to first codes youtube channel today we're going to be creating a fun game related to chinese new year on app inventor so just to give a little bit of context in this app we will get to collect gold coins by dragging our character in on the screen and then having our character touch the gold coins every time the character touches a gold coin one point gets added to our total points so something like this where i drag the character and i try to collect the gold points and my score goes up all right so let's get started on our project so whenever you're creating a new project in mit app inventor there's various ways of doing it obviously one of the ways is to manually add all of your components and your characters and all that but the easier way and the more convenient which i'm going to be using right now is to just upload a aia file um which includes all of your characters and sounds and components that you need for your project that's what i have here get the coins dot aia and i'm gonna have the exact same file uh linked in the description box below so be sure to check it out if you guys are interested in doing the same product now i'm about to do right now right so now that i have this imported i'm just going to press ok and it's going to create a new project called get the coin and i'm going to click on that so here is the page that i have um and you can see that there's two screens there's the main screen and the screen one uh the difference between the two is if you go back to the demo a little bit uh before this i showed you there's like a home screen where i can just press start in order to start the game so that's the main screen and screen one is here where the player actually gets to play the game so you can see all the components uploaded all the gold coins six of them and then the pirate sprite which is this character that's moving around right here um so right now we're in the designer tab we want to move to the blocks tab in order to get started with the coding right so this part of the code will help us to click on the start button to help us go to the next screen you're going to find this in a lot of games nowadays where there's a home page and first is the home page and once you click on a start button on somewhere on the home page then it leads you to the player screen where you get to actually play the game so to get started uh let's click on button one if you scroll down a little bit uh before first we have to go to main screen right and we're gonna click on button one and then we're gonna click when button one dot click right so this is basically saying when i click on the button something happens and the something that we wanted to happen is to open another screen and another screen that we want to open is screen one because right now we're on the home screen or main screen right but we want to open screen one so to do that let's go back and click on control and then there should be an open another screen screen name and we want to specify the screen name and how we do that is we click on text and there should be a double quote with empty blank and click that there and the name of our screen that we want to move to is green one so we just copy that name into this box right here so screen one all right so this is all we have to do basically for the main screen right it's just click on a button that's all you can do so now we want to move on to our player screen which is called screen one and we're going to code our character and give it the ability to sense our finger when we press it on the screen right in order to drag it along the screen so when i have my mouse on the pirate sprite i can move the power spot around in order to collect the coins so that's what we have to do first so the same thing with the button to um code the pyrosprite uh or the character at hand we're just gonna press on pirate sprite and then what we want to do is we want to get the when pyrosprite.drag because it's just going to be our power supply is going to be following our mouse so what we wanted to do is we want to set the location of the pyrosprite to the location of our mouse um so to do that you just want to say um set character 2 on dot x and set creator to that y um to search a number oops there we go okay so let's press on set character uh set pirate dot x and then we want to do the same thing for the y um but let's just finish with the x part coding first so we want to set the pirate sprite.x to the current x position so we want to do is get the get block so let's go to variables and get the get and then we're going to paste that here and what what do we want to get we want to get the current x position um but this is not we this is half of what we have to do right we have to also do the same thing with our y um but i think this is a good point to uh tell you about an easy way to copy paste blocks in mit app inventor so obviously you don't if you're going to do a similar thing over and over again this is just an example we're only going to do it twice um but in other examples that we're going to be i'm going to be showing you later we're going to be um coding similar blocks for but very very subtle differences so an easy way to do it is you can actually use the backpack and store blocks of code and then you can just drag those blocks of code that you copied into the backpack whenever you need to use it so if i click on my backpack right now you can already see some of the blocks that i already have copied into here um but i'm going to show example of exactly how to actually get these blocks into there what you want to do is just drag it and then the backpack should open up like that and once it it's open you just gotta drop it in and then if you open a backpack you can see that my block is copied so now i can drag this block out and you can see that there's a copy created so uh let's go back and put this in and then we gotta put this in but we gotta create with the y because we already did the x position good so now we want to do is we want to make sure that a character doesn't go off screen right um we don't really want it to go off screen because that'd be a little bit weird so to do that you want to go into uh the character or the pirate sprite component back again and then you want to get the when pirate sprite the edge reached and then after i get this one um i want to make sure that my uh pirate sprite doesn't go off screen so to do that you want to actually get the call pirates right dot bounce edge and then we want to specify the edge which is going to be um similar to our x and y which we're going to just get get and instead of saying current x and current y we want to say the edge right so now we have all our code so to make sure that our power sprite doesn't go off screen and also that we can drag our power sprite with our mouse cool cool okay so the next part of the code is um we're gonna have a clock in the game and this clock is going to help us move our gold coins around the screen so same thing that we did with the pirate sprite we want to uh code the clock now so we want to press clock 1 and then i'm going to get the uh when clock1.timer block all right so let's get this block right here and then the next thing that i want to do is to make sure that our coins are all in a different position every single time it disappears so again if you don't remember how the game works be sure to go back to the beginning of the weird video where i have a demo of the game but basically long story short i have this pirate sprite which is going to be used to collect all the coins that are popping in and out of certain locations and i want them to pop in and out in random locations every single time i don't want them to appear in the same spot so to do that uh we're going gonna go to gold coin one and then we're going to get the call uh gold one gold coin one dot move two and then in terms of the x and y um we want to make it a random number so to do that you want to go to math and then you're going to want to get the random integer from 1 to something right but we want to make it one we can just make a zero right and then we want to make a hundred because we're not really sure how big is it going to be but we want to make it big enough to fit the screen so to do that we actually have to operate some kind of operation a subtraction operation between the width of the canvas or the screen and then the width of the coin so to do that you want to actually go to math again and then get the minus operation if i can find that there it is i'm going to put it here and i don't need 100 anymore so you can just toss it into the trash right and what goes into these two blanks so the two blanks as i mentioned before is going to be a subtraction of uh the width of the gold coin from the width of the canvas so uh to get the width of the canvas you want to get the canvas one dot width um block right here and we put that in the first blank and then into the second blank same thing but we are going to subtract with the width of the gold coin instead of the canvas so let's go ahead and get the gold coin one dot uh width and plop that into there right and then that's fine and then we have to do the same thing for the height right this is just for the width but we also do have to do the same thing for the height because x is the width and y is the height represents uh them respectively um but this is good practice because we have this huge block of a relatively big block of code but it'd be kind of too much work to um do this all over again unless you want to it's personal preference so what i'm going to do is i'm going to drag this into our backpack and then it's going to create it a copy of it so now i have a copy of it i'm going to just going to drag it out and then i'm going to drag this back into its original position i'm going to drag this into the y position um so most of it's going to be the same except we got to change it to the height instead of the width because we're dealing with the ycoordinate good so now we have both the x and the y um generating these like random integers right but this is only for the first gold coin i have six of them so now i have to do the same thing for all six but imagine how much work that would be to do all of that uh from calling the gold one dot move two and then creating all these random integers so let's do the same thing again so we're gonna put this huge block of code into your backpack and then now you should see that there's a copy of it right here and again we're gonna do the same thing again because we have six coins so this is three and then this is four this is five scroll down i'm gonna zoom out a bit so you guys can see the uh bigger picture what's the one two three four five i need one more so let's drag that out now i have six and obviously we still have a some um a few things to change uh we have to change this to gold coin.2 and here we also have to change it to gold coin at two and we have to do that for the rest of them all the way till six so let's do that 1.3 uh gold coin three gold coin three and then this gold coin four gold coin four uh gold coin now four and then this is going to be 1.5 0.5 gold point five scroll down and then gold coin six gold coin six and gold coin six right so now we all have all these blocks so now we're going to be moving on to when the um the situation when the pyro spray actually collects the coins right so when they when the power supply collects the coins what happens our score goes up so that's something that we also have to deal with right okay so um in this particle we're going to code what happens when our character collides so each time our character clients right now just like i said before they're going to get a point and it's going to be added to our total score but at the same time when our character touches a gold coin not only does our score goes up about but the gold coin actually disappears so let's get started with that portion um let me zoom out a bit so just in case that you guys were not able to catch the first part of what we did i have this all here zoom this let's move this to the side uh you guys have a moment all right so in terms of how to deal with the collision uh let's go back into our pirate sprite component and then get the collided with block this time and then we're going to have a bunch of if statements of when um our gold coin is colliding with the pirate sprite then it's going to do something but we also have six gold coins we're gonna have to do a similar thing of duplicating code six times right so let's go ahead and get our if statement and if and then statement and that should be in the control and i'm gonna grab this if then so if what goes in our if statement we're going to be checking if our character is colliding with our uh gold coin so to do that let's go back into our pirate sprite and get the call pirate sprite colliding with so let's get that right so now that i have that um what is my pirate sprite colliding with in my first situation obviously is going to be the gold coin um so let's go to gold coin one gold coin one and then we should be able to grab the gold coin run right here gold coin one oops all right so now that i was able to get the gold coin one block we're just going to paste that into the colliding with other and then we now have to deal with the then segment so we deal with the if statement but now we have to deal with our density so the dense statement we're just going to create a sound and use the gold coin sound component that we already uploaded into our app inventor so what we want to do is go to coin sound and click on that and then get the call points on that play which is just going to allow our sound to play and then we also have to set um our gold point one to um false in terms of visibility because we want the gold coin one to disappear from its spot that it's currently in so um let's get the set gold coin one dot visible two and put that right below our plane and we want the set to visib since the gold coin ones.visibility is equal to true right now we want to set it equal to false and you're gonna find that in the logic so let's paste the false in there and then the next thing that we want to do um is also to increase our score right because we this situation is basically just saying if my pirate spider is touching my gold coin one then i want my score to increase so um what we want to do for the score uh so we go scroll down go to score and then we want to get the setscore.txt um setscore.txt file or block then we're going to paste that right below our and i want to set it to the current score.text plus one so plus one we're going to go back to math to find the operations to do that and we're going to paste the plus and then what i want to do in the two spaces here is obviously i want to add one to the first spot right because i want to increment my score by number of one and then in our first spot we're just going to grab our current score so to do that we're going to go back to score and then score.txt we're going to paste it into there so now our score.txt is going to be plus equals to 1 when it's colliding with our pirate sprite okay good so we have this code uh done for our gold coin one right but remember that we have five more coins that we have to deal with so let's do the same thing of copy pasting the code so let's put this into the backpack and create more copies of the exact same code so let's grab this so now i have two but i need four more so let's grab four more of those so one two three scroll down a little bit and then we have our fourth round i'm gonna paste that in there and then like before we have to change our uh gold coin one spot to the respective gold coin number so we're gonna change here to gold point two and then change here to gold coin three change here to go point three and change here to gold coin four oops did i skip oh yeah i was skipping okay so this is gold coin four let's go coin four scroll down and then this will be gold point five this is gonna be gold point five and this would be gold coin six this would equal coin six so that was pretty easy using our backpack in order to copy paste code and the last thing that we have to do is actually uh create the reset button so we had a reset button at the bottom left hand of the screen and this is just to reset the coins so that we can start grabbing all the coins right um and it another thing that this reset button should do is also bring back our score back to zero um so in terms of doing the reset button let's click on the reset button and get the when resabound.click to make sure something happens when we click on the reset button and what do we want to happen uh we want all our coins back to be visible right um just like at the very start we're just resetting the game resetting all the plates and the components so to do that we're going to go to button one and get the setcoin1.visible and what do we want to make it since we're starting over we don't want it to be false right we want it so that it's true so let's go to logic and get the true and that's all we have to do but remember we have six um coins so let's put this into a backup again and then we're going to get uh five more of those four five six and let's change these to the respective coin numbers three four five six good and then this isn't all we have to do actually we still have to set our score to zero right um so just like we set our score dot exe to score dot txt plus one now we just have to set it back to zero so let's go to score and then get the set score.txt2 and then instead of saying plus equals one we wanna say equal to zero so let's just paste that here and then all i have to do is put this inside of the one reset button up click all right cool um so now that we have this uh we have both of our screens our main screen and our screen run code develop so now what we want to do is you can use um an emulator or your phone in order to actually simulate this game i have a emulator called bluestacks on my computer so that's what i'm going to be using in order to demo this um application that we just made so let's get that started so i'm just going to copy paste it onto the screen i'm going to show you guys what we have made so far hopefully you guys were able to get to the end just like i am at cool okay so this is what i have right here um this is just the copy of the game that we just made and then this is the home screen right and when you press start here uh then i reach the player screen where i get to drag my character and my score goes up as i touch the gold coins right you see my score is five but then when i touch the gold coin goes to six right now our coins are all gone and i want to play again so i just have to press my reset then i can start playing again and my score goes up again so that's all for today i hope you all enjoyed watching this tutorial if you guys want to watch tutorials like this be sure to like our videos and subscribe uh that's all i have for today thank you bye
