hello everyone welcome to first code academy today we're going to do a project on app inventor called name generator in this project you'll be creating a simple mobile app in which the user will answer a few questions and a superhero name will be generated according to the user's answer so let's have a look at um a demo here of the app so the first question is what is your favorite color we can click here to choose one and as you can see we have quite a few options i'm gonna go with um pink all right and what is your um potato chip flavor i'm gonna go with flaming hot and then what do you like to do in your free time i'm gonna go ahead with watch youtube and then i'm going to click generate now to see what my superhero name is and i get incredible invisible theory all right so to begin let's start with creating the appearance of the app so now i'm in my app inventor project i'm going to go ahead with adding a label all right and then i'm going to go to text and type in the question so my first question is what is your favorite color okay so as you can see now our label is displaying that now the next step would be to add in the options for the user to choose so we're going to use the list picker to do that and we're going to drag it to below our label all right now we don't want it to say text for list picker one so we're gonna go to text delete that and type in choose one all right now what we're going to do next is we're going to go ahead and add in the options we're going to do that in elements from string now since i'm going to add in 12 options i have typed my options somewhere else i'm going to go ahead from that place and paste it onto my elements from string all right so these are my options i added in 12. so as you can see okay i'm going to zoom in you need to make sure that you separate your options with a comma okay so i have red orange yellow green turquoise all the way to white all right so that's my first question and options done i'm going to go ahead and add in my second question okay and go to text my second question will be what is your favorite potato chip flavor favorite potato chip flavor okay and then grab a list picker just like we did go to text make it choose one again all right and then it's time to go to elements from string and add in your options so i have them typed somewhere else as well these are my options i have classic bbq salt and vinegar sour cream all of that in here okay and i separate them with a comma so you can drag the corner of the text box right here so that you can see your options okay now i'm gonna go with my third question and i'm gonna type in what do you like to do in your free time like to do in your free time all right what do you like to do in your free time okay and then grab a list picker change the text to choose one and then add in the options all right i'm gonna have a look okay so these are my options right here now the last thing is we need to go ahead and add in a button so this button is going to be the thing you click which will generate the superhero name for you so we get the button we change the text to generate super hero name all right generate superhero name and then we need a label again to show the users what their superhero name is so this one i'm going to go to text and change it to your super hero name is okay and the label that's actually going to show you the super hearing aid another one right there below the um label okay and for this one we won't know what it is until they have um chose chosen their options so we're gonna make it blank we can go to text delete text for label five all right and what we wanna do is we wanna rename this label because we have quite a bit of labels okay so when we code it's going to be easier if you rename them so that you know which ones you actually want to put the text in so you rename it to result okay all right so we have our three questions we have the um button to generate the superhero name we have the label that shows your superhero name is and then the actual label okay called result that's going to display it and that's it for the app design we're going to go ahead and start coding next all right so now i'm in the blocks mode where we're going to do the coding for the app now to start with we have to prepare list of names that match with the user's selection so i have i'm going to do color list flavorless and hobby list all right so we go to variables we're going to initialize three okay and then the first one since i'm asking about color i'm gonna change it to color list like so right and i'm gonna make a list of all of the choices okay so i'm going to go ahead and add 12 because i gave the users 12 choices in the beginning to choose from all right so now i have 12 choices right here i'm gonna go ahead and type in my first one so my first one right here let's say in the beginning for the color the user chose red then i'm going to go ahead and say what their first part of their superhero name is going to be if they chose red so for me i'm going to go with captain all right now the second bit okay if they choose another color i'm going to make the first part doctor okay duplicate it put it here then the other one will be the great all right and then i do turbo okay so you can keep duplicating for each of the options that you provided okay so this is the first part of this super hearing aid which is generated from when the user chooses a color and then my last one will be invincible so the first part of the name is done all right which is generated from the color color list so i'm going to shrink it and keep it here now the second part is going to be from the flavor of the potato chip right so we can name this flavor okay chip flavor maybe okay and we're gonna go ahead and add in the options again so i'm actually gonna copy this one right here okay duplicate and close this put it here and of course i'm going to change in the options in here so for the flavor list the first one i'm going to add is evil and of course you can choose your own um name so i'm going to go with speedy so these are all um superhero powers evil speedy funny flying mind reading so that's from the chip flavor these are the words the second part of the superhero name now for the third part it's going to be from hobby okay and then again i'm going to make a list of words i'm going to put this right here all right now the first word i'm going to do is ninja and maybe agent all right so these are all the words that i'm going to use to generate the superhero name now the next thing that i'm going to do is i'm going to go ahead and update the selection after an answer has been picked all right so we need to update the listpicker.txt in all three list picker components now we're going to do that by going to list picker okay list picker one and we're going to say when listpicker1.afterpicking picking we're gonna do that for all three list pickers okay change this to list picker two and then lastly we have list picker three all right let's pick your one list picker two and list picker three and then after we have that we're gonna say okay we wanna change the text of the list picker to whatever the user has chosen so to do that we're gonna say we wanna set okay list picker dot text to whatever the user has chosen so that would be list picker dot selection okay right here all right so the first one is done we can just duplicate it and then put it into the second one but don't forget make sure you change it to list picker two and then the last one would be list picker three all right okay i'm also going to shrink these blocks so i'm gonna collapse collapse then collapse all right now after i'm done with that the next thing i'm going to do is i want the name to be generated according to the user's choice so if the user's choice is the first selection in the list picker one then the name generated um will be the first name in the first list so it would be this list right here right okay and then i also want to check the selection and we'll create a procedure to select the selection list and obtain the index from the user's choice which we will name check selection right and we want to call check selection when the user presses the generate button and pressing the generate button also resets the list picker text to choose one okay so we're gonna initialize three things some variables okay and the first one like i said we're gonna make it selection one selection one selection two and selection three all right now after we do that we need to go ahead and put in empty text boxes like so okay because we're not sure yet what they will choose i put that here like a placeholder okay and then next we would need to set the three variable to store the selected items from the list okay so to do that we're gonna need to open these three codes right here and then we say all right set okay so we see selection one so it's that selection one to whatever we have chosen so that would be list picker one dot selection index right because we want to match what we chose to what the name will be selection index okay so we can copy this put it right here now make sure it's list thicker too and uh selection two oops this one should have been this figure two okay and then lastly for our list picker 3 change it to selection 3 and let's pick for 3. make sure to change this one right here as well all right so now whenever the user chooses something we're going to match it to one of the options here okay for each of the questions they're going to be matched to one of these words okay now i'm going to shrink them again now that we have the selection index we need to create the procedure block to select the selection list and obtain the index from the user's choice which we will name as check selection so we're going to go to procedure all right it's the purple color block and then we are going to say to procedure result and like i said we're going to name this check selection so check selection all right and then we are going to have two parameters so we can have inputs right two inputs now the first input we are going to call it list okay so list the second input we're going to call it selection index like so so list and selection index and then we're going to go ahead and say it's a list and we're going to say select list item list and index okay for the list it will depend on which list you've got so get list and then index it will be just the parameter we did the input we did which is get selection index all right now that we're done with this part okay we're gonna go ahead and code the generate button so we can go ahead that's button one okay so when button1.click something should happen okay i'm gonna shrink these ones again all of those okay one button one dot click so when button1.click we need to set the name label now so the label that's going to um show the your superhero name so that's results right here and then set dot result.text to something okay we put that right here and we have three components in the super heroes name so we need to use something called join it's right here in text okay bring that and connect it here all right now that we have join we're going to call the procedure that we have created okay so we're going to call check selection then in the call check selection we're going to get first of all the color list okay so we go to variables we get this method okay now selection index so which one they have selected we're gonna go ahead and get selection one okay which is a variable we generate uh we initialized here get selection one all right now the next thing we need to do is we need to add a little bit of space in between each word right we don't want them all stuck together so we're going to add in an empty text box like so all right and then we need more two more words so we need to add some more spaces okay and we also need to think about the space in between the words so i'm going to add in let's say this much right so four more then i'm going to duplicate this call again but this time it's not colorless it's your chip flavor list and global selection too put in the spacer again all right and then lastly we call the selection right here change it to get global hobby and it would be your third selection all right and for this one since it's the last word we don't really need the space i'm going to remove it okay you can just drag it out like that all right then that's it for the coding part of this app okay so you can go ahead and try it using your android phone by clicking on connect and ai companion or you can use bluestacks an app where you can look at android apps so that's all for today i hope you enjoyed this project and remember to give us a thumbs up if you like it and don't forget to hit subscribe um button to get new tutorials and thank you bye
