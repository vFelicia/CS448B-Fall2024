everyone so today we're going to be making a scratch project and in the scratch project it's related to recycling let's have a look at what this project will look like so in this game there will be floating crash and we have to collect it so we have this trash can here so let's click it to start so we can use the left and right arrow to control and collect our card which every time we collect a garbage it gives us a score and in this game we also have a high score so let's see if you can guess what is the high score and when you reach a certain amount then something will happen so i'm using the left and right keys to control the garbage bin and our food is just randomly falling from the sky so once i reached the score of 30 you just now saw that the garbage can said thank you for not littering we can click on create and we are here we're going to call this don't later okay next we're going to remove this cap and then we're going to actually add a background i'm going to click on this and then this is our starting background so you can call this starter okay and then you can click on paint and paint any color then i'm gonna color this here so click on this and cover it now if you want to add some text we click on t change this to black in color and here we can just type in don't litter and this is our backdrop so this is like the starting screen and then we want to add some more information over here so you can click again here and the information we're gonna write is then we can write and then here we can click on this arrow and sort of move this text here same thing for this you can move it here and you can change the color of this you can say oh say i don't want this color make it red and then this you can leave it alone and then what we're going to add down is our garbage can inside in a second so we need to now export our sprites over here so let's see how we're going to do that i'm going to click on this i'm going to click upload sprite so here in upload sprite we click on the folder and we have four of them here so you can press shift and press the down arrow on your keyboard and then click open and once you do that it will start uploading all of them so you can see all of them are here but we have to do a few things so to click on each one of these spreads so you click on costume and we can use the eraser tool that is here and erase all of this so you can see this part is the access part that is not needed then you can move on to the next one so we have the garbage bin and here too clean out any excess stuff and if you make a mistake like this you can actually click back here and then if you think this is too big you can change the sizing then we can click on the apple then you can click on this and then what we want to do is want to change the size i can change these to 30 this also can be changed to 30. this can be changed to 60 this can be changed to 30 and then what we need to do is we're going to place this here and if you notice there's still more you can clean it you can just try looking at the image and seeing where you think it may be i think that's okay for now so what we want to do is we want to start coding so first we will have our garbage bin show click on events click on when green flag click and then click on looks and then click on show so what happens when we start our game our garbage can shown and then since we wanted to go to another backdrop we click on events and take out when i click so when this sprite is clicked we want to change to the next spectrum so how we do that is we first add another backdrop so here let me change this to you choose a backdrop say i'll use colorful cd go back to here click back on my code so when spread click i want it to switch backdrop to colorful city and also when i start the game i not only want to show my character i also want to switch the backdrop to start and then when i click it it will say this so then once we started i also wanted to say something right they got save click here say click here to start so click here to start the game and if you want him to constantly say that you can take out a repeat 10 you can just have him repeat saying this 10 times and since these other food items are there what we want to do is when we start the game we want them to be hidden so each one of them take out the green flag put that here click on looks and then take out the height block here we're gonna do the same for the apple so green flag looks and then same thing for the orange green flag and then looks then start all of them are hidden so the next thing is when we now switch back right so we click on events take out when backdrop switch to colorful city and then i would like it to stop show itself and then also go to the position over here so you can drag this here and then you can take out motion go to and on top of that we can have our garbage controlled our garbage bin controlled when we want to move it take out an event take out green flag put that here click on a forever block and we can take out two if statements here and and why we're using the if statements we only want our garbage can to move when we trigger a certain click on sensing take out the key press put that here and put this here so left and right and what we want to do we take out the change x click on motion change x by 10 and put this here but remember when you're going to the left side it's a minus 10. so so far we have this and when we start we can have it here and then click on it it starts here so let me keep on saying this and then we can move our character left and right now we have our food items so what we can do we can say when backdrop switches to colorful cd so say i want to position my character somewhere here right i want to place the button so what i need to do is i click on control take out a forever then i take out a show block here and then a high block so what i'd like to do is i'd like to go to a certain position so right now as you see when i click that the banana is there so if you want to see it first you can click on looks take uh this show block here just click on it once you click on it you can see your banana so i want to place it over here so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna have it hide i'm gonna have it go to okay and then what i wanted to do is i wanted to show itself and then glide so we'll take out the glide and then we will take out the glide one second but then here since i wanted to go from top to down so we can see here the position is 147 and same thing goes here so we're going to change this to minus 147 but the difference is i wanted to randomly like so click on operators take out a pick random put that here and change this to 0.82 one second so let's see how that goes so see here whenever it goes down it goes back up here so it's randomly moving from the top to the bottom and if you want it to be faster you can change this to 3.5 here click so now this part is done here then we can click on this apple so as i said we can click on looks and take out a show block click on it and then you see it's here so the same thing i want to be done with is i want to drag it over here then i click on the when backdrop is switched to colorful city then what do i do i click on operators take out a forever block so once again inside whatever we put inside this block will be repeated forever constantly so then i click on looks i take out my hide block and then my shoulder then what i want to do here is i want to click on motion take out the go to xy position here and then show we're going to use a glide block once again but this time again it's going from top to bottom so the x position stays the same this number changes to minus 1 9 and then we have a operator click random put that here change 0.5 to 0.6 see this both of them are randomly falling at different timings but they're both coming down so that's what we're going to do for this block same thing for the orange bigger so you take out the when backdrop switch to colorful city click on control take out the forever block and then we want to click on looks and take out hide and then so then we find the position of the orange which is already here but since we want to see it first and click on looks and then sure once you just click this you can see where your orange is say i bring the orange over here right so it has updated the x and y position and we go to motion take out the x and y put that here and then we want it to glide let me take out this then we're going to change this here to 0.5 to zero and then this number is changed to and then what we can do here is once it glides and then it will so let's see how this runs so now you can see that our truths are falling right but you notice they're not falling at different rates we could actually make it more interesting by having them change randomly in different times so here we can put 0.5 to 0.8 we could change this to zero point eight to one second you can change this so this we won't change this will stay the same this we can change it to zero point two two zero point five now it'll look a bit different here you can see they are moving at different intervals try and catch it so the next thing i mentioned is we want to have a score so how do we set up this score it's quite simple it's not that hard we need to make a variable called score actually begin with this so we click on variables click on make a variable and we're going to call it school so now that we have this we want to click on the garbage can you can take out a green flag and then we can say when we start we set the score to zero okay then we click on a forever block and control and then we take on a if block so we're going to use the operators because we're going to check if our garbage can is touching the banana the apple or the orange so let's look at that we take out an operator called four and we're going to put one more so this way we can select three click on sensing click on touching i'm gonna change this to touching banana i'm gonna take out another one change this to touching eaten apple and then take another one here change it to touching on okay and what's gonna happen is whenever it touches it it'll change the score by one click on variable and then we take out chain scored by click on this let's see what happens if we try that out oh you notice there's a problem my high score is too high how can i be touching one thing and the high score is too high so there's a bit of an issue right so how do i solve this there's a pretty simple way of solving this i give it the timer some time to wait before it changes my score again so we can click on control we can take out a weight block and put that here and we're going to change this to a magical number of zero dot five seconds so let's see what happens okay green flag starting zero let's try so now whenever it touches it it changes it only after i touch it it doesn't change it by so much continuously so one thing about the garbage can is repeatedly it says click to start the game so what i can say is when i click the sprite instead of using this repeat it would be a bit annoying you could maybe remove that and just have it say click to start the game for one second so click this there so now we have a fully functioning game and whenever we move we collect a point but we also want to add a high school point so go back here and then we put a another control block here and then we're going to change this to if the score is equal to 30 so only under this condition would we have our character say something so our character will say we win so we click on operators take out the equal block and change this to 30 and then click on variables and take on score and put that too so what do we want our character to say we're going to say thank you for not measuring so click on looks and then take out the save block here and put this and say thank you not littering and then change this to one second and then click on control wait one second so that would mean that when we get a score of 30 we say thank you for not littering you wait one second and then we can click on control and take out a stop all block this would mean our whole game stops so let's check it out green flag let me make the screen big in this game we'll have certain garbage we have to collect it and try and catch all the garbage before it gets here thank you for not literally and then the game and stops a second and then stop and then when we click back again the game will restart so congratulations we've made our don't litter game for more fun tutorials like this please make sure to like share and subscribe to firstcoat academy on youtube for more fun filler
