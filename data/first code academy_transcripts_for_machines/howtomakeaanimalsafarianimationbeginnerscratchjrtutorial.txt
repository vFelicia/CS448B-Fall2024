hello everyone welcome back to our channel here we share beginner friendly coding tutorials on scratch roblox minecraft and many more and today what we're going to do is a scratch junior project about a jungle animation in this project i'm going to teach you how to create your jungle animation using scratch so here's a little demonstration of the project we have some animals when we click on them there will be some animations all right like so and then we also have a zookeeper right here so the zookeeper is sort of the person who does the introduction okay so here he's saying we're going to the jungle today on the characters to see them move then i also have a school bus that brings the zookeeper back so let's get started in making our project we'll start by adding a zookeeper in our project so here i have chosen tech to be my zookeeper now what i'm going to do is i'm going to use my painting tool to give him some hat and some clothes so i'm going to click on my painting tool right now and i'm gonna first start off by giving him a hat so here i have uh tex hat ready now the next thing i'm going to do is also draw a shirt for tick okay and the last thing i want to do is i'm also going to go ahead and add some zookeeper boots for tick okay now that i have added all of the things that we want the zookeeper to have i'm going to click on the tick mark and place him in our project i'm going to place him in the bottom left corner now i'm gonna go ahead and add in the jungle background right here okay and the next thing i'm going to do is i'm going to add in the bus character so that um it can be shown right here above it okay now i have it above tick right here the next thing i'm going to do is add three animals that is going to be displayed in our jungle so i'm gonna start off with adding a monkey right here okay since it's a little bit big i'm also going to use the purple shrinking block to make him a little smaller so that he fits right here on the school bus and then the next thing would be to add second animal i'm going to go ahead and choose a giraffe okay so again the giraffe would need some shrinking so let me go ahead and shrink it and put it right here and then add in my third animal which is going to be a snake okay so now that i have added in all my animals the next thing i'm going to do is i'm going to start coating our zookeeper tick so the first thing i want to do is of course um green flag i want to make sure when i click green flag that whatever tick does uh it's supposed to do is starting to work so i'm going to get my green flag then get my speech bubble right in my speech bubble right here i'm going to put in we're going to the jungle today okay now before he says that i also want him to move to the right 10 steps so i'm going to put that before the speech block and add in 10 steps okay and then after he does that i want him to pause a little bit so i'm just gonna put in two units for the time and then put in another message so in this message i'm going to basically provide the instructions on how to use our animation so i'm going to say tap on the characters to see them move okay and after he says that pause again for two more seconds and then stop all right now we're going to go ahead and coat the bus in our project so that when we click on the bus it moves forward a little bit pause this for a while and then sends a message to tick so that tick can disappear all right so to send a message we would need to send message block so we're gonna first start off by going to our school bus right get our event on character tax and then go ahead and say all right when that happens we want to move to the right two units and then send a message to our zookeeper so that would be again another event and i'm gonna choose the orange envelope after i do that i'm going to wait for four seconds and then i'm going to go ahead and just move to the right for 10 steps and then disappear and then stop so i'm gonna go to my purple blog to get the disappear block right here and then get in my stop block so the reason we want to send our zookeeper a message is that so when he opens it he says goodbye so we're going to get the open message block all right and then i'm going to get my speech bubble right here that we just got earlier and i'm going to say i gotta go have fun okay so when he says that we're going to go ahead and put in some time blocks again so we're going to put in three this time okay so three and then now when we put in that block we're going to get the move up block so he looks like he's moving into move going into the school bus okay making sure he also disappears and then we can finally put in the stop block now that we've coated both the bus and the zookeeper it's time to coat the animal so i'm going to start off with my giraffe again i'm going to get my character tapped event and i'm going to use the repeat block right here so that's repeat four times because i have the number four what i'm going to do is i'm going to use my turn around lock okay so first turn to the right side then the left side for two okay and then back again at one all right so that's for my giraffe now moving on to my monkey i'm going to say when character attacked i'm going to make it go to the right side for three units and then move down for five units okay and then also some turn turning block so i'm gonna use turn right two okay and then some hot block okay again i'm gonna use two so i'm not changing anything and then i'm gonna do move to the right 14 times 14 units and then disappear of course we need our stop block and lastly i'm going to go ahead and code the snake now for the snake again same event one character clicked and i'm going to make it move to the right by eight blocks eight units sorry and then return back and then stop all right so let's have a look at our final project now all right so we're gonna go ahead and of course click on our green flag so we have our zookeeper here we're going to the jungle today okay tap on the characters to see the move then i'm gonna click on my school bus and he says i gotta go have fun goes up and then our school bus leaves okay now we're gonna test our um animals here so first we have the monkey okay then we have the giraffe then we have our snake so that's it for our project today so that's all for today hope
