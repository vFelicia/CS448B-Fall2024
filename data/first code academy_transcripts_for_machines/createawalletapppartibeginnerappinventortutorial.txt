hello everyone welcome back to our channel here we share beginner friendly coding tutorials on scratch roblox minecraft web programming and many more today we're going to create a wallet app using app inventor so let's get started okay so first i'm going to show you what the app looks like this app is going to take your budget of shopping budget and then you just put it in the ad budget and then you can go to wallet and in here you can add in your shopping list so put in your items and your price and the price of that item so let's say i have to buy meat for 20 and i have to buy candles four five and then just click add to list and then i'll have to buy uh snacks for another ten dollars okay and you'll see here that uh the app gives us how much money how much budget we have left so this video is the first part of the project i'm in this video we're going to go over the designing part only okay we'll start by adding a new project in app inventor and we'll name our project my wallet all right and then click on my wallet the one that we just created okay so we're going to design the first screen so drag in two items from user interface drag in a label and drag in a button from the same section so a button and a label all right okay now we want to change the size the font size for both of them i'm going to put 30 for and 20 for the other one okay this one and we are going to rename it so that to be the app the name of the app so my wallet okay and also change the width to fill parent okay and sex alignment we can also change the color by clicking on background color i want mine to be yellow and i want to change the text color too just here and then click on white wait that's not good okay orange instead okay this is much better and for the bottom one uh this button is going to allow us access to the wallet so for this button we'll change it to go to wallet and change the width to fill parent also okay and you can change the design as you want i'm going to make my font fold and i'm going to change the background color to be blue and change the text color i want it to be white so this is what it looks like okay next we're going to add in an option where user

center so vertical and center like this okay now we want to change the name of the components in our screen so for this label one i'll just say label we have to change it so that when we code it's easy to know it's more organized and for the button button wallet for this label label budget and for this one i'm gonna name it textbox budget now we want to make our app more uh user friendly so we're going to add in a background but we want the background to just appear over in this space over here okay so we're going to do that by going to layout and dragging the horizontal arrangement
