hello everyone welcome to first code academy today we are going to make a simple project on apple vertical pumpkin and turkey smash ok and turkey bash is a simple thing in which a party and a turkey popups randomly on the screen and when you try to touch it you'll gain points one point for a pumpkin and five points for the turkey if you miss touching the pumpkin or the turkey it will be counted as a mess by pressing on the mixer button the count of the hits and misses would be visit back to see by building this game you will learn how to add timing random randomness and use procedures into your apps so let's start by giving a name to our project so the name of this project would be called pumpkin and techie smash so let's start with designing our project i have already added the pictures and the sounds that i'll be using for the project you can find the links to these pictures and the sound by clicking on the description below so first let's add our very first component that is a canvas so i'm going to go ahead and drag a canvas onto the screen so we are going to use a canvas to hold our turkey and our pumpkins price so i'm going to make the canvas and i'm going to change the height we fill paren and the width is going to be fill parent 2. next i'm going to add 2 image press i'm going to rename each image price in order to help me to identify the pictures when i'm coding i'm going to rename the first image spread as turkey and the second image right i'll be renaming it as okay all right so next i'm going to add two horizontal arrangements that will be showing us of his code and our mrs score so now i'm going to go to layout and i'm going to add one horizontal orange one next i'm going to add a label i'm going to rename this label as heat label next i'm going to add another label onto the horizontal measurement which i'm going to rename as hit come good next i'm going to change the properties of these two labels so i'm going to go ahead click on the hit label and i'm going to change the text of this hit label to be hit and i'm going to change the property or the text of the hit count to be zero next i'm going to repeat the same procedure to add a label to hold my mrs cap i'm going to go ahead and click on a horizontal arrangement next i'm going to add two labels i'm going to rename this label as mislabel the second label i would be meaning in it as miss so the text for the miss label would be called this is and the x for the miscount would be zero so next i'm going to add a reset button into a screen so in order to do that i'm going to bring a button that will be at the very bottom of my screen which i will be renaming it as reset button i'm going to change the text of this button to be called reset next i'm going to add a sub component that will be holding my sun so i'm going to go ahead and click on media and then i'm going to drag this sound component here i'm going to change the source of the sound component to be to be more sub so next i'm going to add two clock sensors into my app screen which will be representing the timing components for the turkey and the pumpkin so let's click on the sensors and let's bring two clock sensors onto the screen clock one and clock two so i'm going to re rename one clock as turkey and the second clock would be meaning as now once we have radiant clocks and all other components we need to add the pictures onto our image price so let's go ahead and click on the turkey image prime and click on the picture properties and click on the turkey picture now it's really big so in order to resize it i will be changing the height of the turkey image prime to be 50 pixels and width is also going to be 50 pixels so next i'm going to add the image of the pumpkin sprite which i'll be changing the height to be 50 pixels and with also going to be 50 pixels all right so now once we have done with designing our app next we are going on to the codes so let's go ahead and click on the blocks now that we have created our mobile app screen next we are going to create the code blocks first we need to create two procedures that would make our image price to move randomly on our screen so i'm going to click on procedures and i'm going to drag do procedure duplo the first procedure would move our pumpkin so i'm going to rename the procedure need to be next i'm going to click on the pumpkin image sprite and i'm going to bring the inbuilt procedure that is called pumpkin dot move to xn1 and then i'm going to snap them together the value x and y belongs to a system called coordinate system which help us to determine the position of an object on the script x stands for the left and right and y stands for the up and down position so in order to give the random x and y coordinates i'm going to click on the math block and i'm going to drag in the block called random integer 1 to 100 i'm going to make this to be 0 and i'm going to remove the 100 block and put it on the trash bin so next in order to keep our image right appear within the screen i'm going to consider the canvas width together with the size of my image spread so i'm going to go ahead and click on the math block and i'm going to drag in the subtraction block onto the empty gap next i'm going to click on the canvas one and i'm going to bring the property block that is canvas one dot web which is going to be subtracted by the pumpkin wood i'm going to repeat the same procedure for the y but instead of the width i'm going to consider the height of the canvas subtracted by the height of my pumpkin spray i'm going to go ahead and drag in the random integer block and snap them together and y make this zero and i'm going to drag the 100 block next i'm going to drag in the subtraction block inside it and this time i'm going to drag canvas dot height property block that is going to be subtracted with the pumpkin height so that's the first procedure so next i'm going to repeat the same steps to make the procedure that would move your turkey spray i'm going to create another procedure so i'm going to drag in two procedure and i'm going to rename it as move turkey next i'm going to click on the turkey image sprite and i'm going to bring the in build procedure block called call turkey dot move to xny so next i'm going to click on the map blocks and i'm going to drag it random integer 1 to 100 i'm going to change this to the 0 and i'm going to drag the 100 block into the trash bin next i'm going to drag in the subtraction block and i'm going to consider the canvas width which is going to be subtracted by the width of the turkey image prime so same goes for the coordinates so i'm going to bring random integer make it zero and then i'm going to consider the height of my cameras and together the height of the turkey so now once we have created the two procedures that would make our pumpkin and the turkey to appear at random places on the screen we need to call them when we open up the screen and when the time is running i'm going to go ahead and click on the turkey cup and bring the event block called winterguitar timer and i'm going to call the procedure paul moog turkey same goes for the pumpkin cloth so when i i'm going to click on the pumpkin crop dot timer so i'm going to call the new pumpkin procedure next we need to make sure that just two procedures would be running or would be functioning when we open up the screen so i'm going to go ahead and click on the screen one component and i'm going to add the even block that is called one screen one dot initialize to and then i'm going to add the two procedures called pumpkin and moon turkey so next i'm going to program the miss and the hit instructions so i'm going to click on the canvas and i'm going to bring the event block on when canvas dot so in this step i'm going to program that if you don't hit any of the image price you would get your mrs go increase so i'm going to add a conditional if that and i'm going to add a logic not and which would be adding the variable touched any sprite so if i don't touch any of the image price i'm going to make my miscount text to be increasing one by one so i'm going to click on the miss count block and i'm going to bring the property block called set miscount.text which is going to add one count let's count one so now i'm going to make the chord knot that would give me the instruction to increase my hit score by one when i click on a pumpkin sprite so i'm going to click on pumpkin and i'm going to pray the event.com onepumpkin.touch next i'm going to click on the hitscope i'm going to bring the property set hit count.text and then i'm going to add one so hit count.text would be changing by a score of one every time when i hit a pumpkin spread next to make it more interesting i'm going to add a little sound that would be plain every time when i click on a pumpkin spray so i'm going to click on the sound block and i'm going to bring the input procedure call cause one dot play so i'm going to repeat the same step such that when you touch a turkish sprite you would get a score of five i'm going to click contact image sprite and i'm going to bring the event block on when turkey dot touch and i'm going to change the hit count by five so hit tell so the cats of the headcount label would be changed by five whenever you hit or whenever you touch a turkey image right i'm going to make it and i'm going to add the sound component so i'm going to bring the inbuilt block on call sound 1.2 so now we are going on to the last step of our project so when you click on the reset button the hit count and the discount will be reset back to zero so i'm going to go ahead and click on reset button and i'm going to bring the event call when reset button dot click next i'm going to give the instructions that the hit count text will be reset back to zero so i'm going to add the math block zero and same goes for the miscount so i'm going to add the miscount.text block and it will be changed back to zero whenever you click on the reset button awesome so now we have completed our project for the turkey and pumpkin smashbox go ahead and click on connect and if you have an android phone you may click on the ai companion or you may click on the emulator to try out the king so that's all for today i hope you like this project
