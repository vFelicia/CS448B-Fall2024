hi everyone and welcome back to our channel here we share beginnerfriendly tutorial videos on scratch roblox minecraft web programming and many more and today we're going to teach you how to make a scratch easter egg game today's game is going to be connected to easter this will be a platform game where the player is a rabbit and if we click green flag we can control the player with arrow keys on a keyboard if we go um if you want to go left we press the left arrow key if we want to go right we press the right arrow key if we want to jump we need to press the up arrow key and we can collect eggs and if we collect an egg our score increases then if we wanted to go to the next level we need to touch the star so if we touch the star then we go to the next level so the platforms are in different places and the eggs are in different places as well so let's get started um first as always go to scratch.mit.edu and you will land on the scratch homepage when you're out on the scratch homepage click create in the top left corner and this will bring us to the new project that we are going to create all right and as you can see there is a cat sprite um already here but we won't need it at all so you can delete it and secondly if you go to backrubs there will be another background that we will need to delete later so let's start from the backdrop actually um the backdrop can be anything related to easter really i'm going to choose a simple blue sky backdrop so i go to choose a background and i select blue sky and when the new background is already here i can delete the old one that way we can also have we can just have one backdrop for the whole project then the next step will be to create the sprites so if you go to the sprite panel you can have um there is a button called choose a sprite so if you click on the choose a sprite button you will see all the sprites available now i'm going to choose a couple of different sprites because in the game that we'll create a lot of things will actually be sprites um the player is a sprite which can be a little bit intuitive because the player is something that moves however the platform will be a sprite as well so that we can code it properly and and so will be the x and the star so let's start from the rabbit you have a hair and a rabbit i'm going to just rub it but feel free to select the other one all right and it's very very big as you can see so let's make it 50. so there is a size panel and you can change it to 50. yep here it goes all right so right now we need to choose a star sprite and for the star actually the star is pretty small and we don't want it to be very very difficult to reach to the other level so let's make it a hundred and thirty let's move it to the top left corner as well all right and here goes the rabbit okie dokie so right now all we need to do is place the platform and dx so again we're going to choose a sprite and there is no sprite platform if you look for a platform there is nothing here but we have another idea if you write a button you'll have a pretty rectangular button that serves perfectly as a platform as well so you can change its size to 75 and it will serve as our platform okay and the last thing the egg now the egg is a little bit tricky because if you go to choose a sprite and select an egg you have an egg but it's not an easter egg you can use those and decorate it yourself using the paint tool that is a very good idea however you can also upload any other sprite that you like for me so i press back for me i'm going to upload my own easter egg sprite the link to download the image will be in the description box so feel free to use it as well so this time i hover the mouse over to the sprite button and then i go up without clicking anything and i select upload sprite when i select upload sprite my file manager appears and you can choose the location where um your image was downloaded so for a lot of you it will probably be the folder downloads and for me i save it on my desktop so you can see a beautiful egg but it's huge so um as always i'm changing the size and this time i'm changing the size to 10. all right so that's it for adding the basic sprites now we need to make sure that the game knows that the platform and the ground is the same thing um because both platforms and the ground are things on which we can walk and it's going to be important when we code it and for them to be in the same color so if you go to the backdrop again and instead of code select the backdrop bookmark scroll down a little bit and select the line um tool here and then you can change the thickness to 50. um you can choose a different color for me it's going to be black because it's the easiest to remember but you can choose a different color however be mindful not to circle the same color as the egg or the star or um the background because it's going to blur into one another and the game will not work so after selecting the color draw a line by dragging dragging the line from left to right from right to left and at the bottom of the screen then go to button and do exactly the same at the top of the button okay so right now we have um the same color on the ground and the platform and we're ready to go um you can also move the rabbit around so that it's just above the ground and the same for the egg it has to be just above the platform then if you have the button you can rename it in the top left corner to platform so that we remember what we're doing so it's going to make the coding a little bit easier okay and then we press enter and then we need to code four different platforms so we need to have four different platforms in the game so we also need to create four different sprites for each platform well even though they're not really different they will be distinct sprites that will have their own name and their own position so we right click on the platform and then click duplicate and again right click on the button and duplicate and the third one also duplicate when you have created all of those platforms feel free to move them around to design the level as you want so this will be my level design but you can choose any other design and as you can imagine i'm in the demo of the game we had three different eggs so we're going to also duplicate the eggs two times so that we can have three different eggs and place them slightly above different platforms or maybe somewhere in the summer in the air that's up to you all right so as you can see we have four different platforms three different eggs a star and the same color on the ground and on the platforms and this will be it for the design of the project so now let's get coding first we're going to code the rabbit movement but before we do so i'm just a quick reminder that if you like this video so far don't forget to like this video and subscribe to our channel and you can also check out all the other videos that we have created so far so let's code the rabbit first is the player so it's very important to code it um as usually click on the rabbit sprite in the sprite panel and if you're still doubtful whether you have the right sprite um selected you can take a look at the top right corner of the white place so there should be a rabbit there so if you see a rabbit then it means you're coding the rabbit so the code will be in the correct player in the correct sprite and the game starts as always when the green flag is clicked so when the green flag is clicked we need to go to the starting position and this can be done by going to motion and go to x y so the x and y positions will already be saved from the current position of the sprite so you don't need to adjust them if you want to you can but um if you just want this position then don't change the numbers here and the second thing that we're going to do is a little bit more tricky but it will make the movement much better so if we set the rotation style to left and right the rabbit will never flip upside down so it will only face left or face right but it will never go upside down when we move around so that's the first step and then we need to code what happens throughout the entire game so for the main game loop it's called we usually use the forever block because it has to run throughout the entire game so let's go to control dragon forever and then do two things first of all we need to add gravity so that if we are not on the ground we fall down towards the ground so if now we go to operators not on the ground so we are going to detect whether we're on the ground by checking the collar so if not touching oh not mouse pointer if not touching color and the color will be the color that you have selected for your for me it's just black so um i can click by the color picker and then if i'm not touching the ground color then i have to go down so again go to motion and change y by 10 secondly if we are touching star 2 so if we're just touching the star then we go to level 2. so we need another control block and if we are touching the star so for we're dragging the touching mouse pointer we might be mindful that this is a mouse pointer by default but we are going to change the mouse pointer to stop and then we need to go to level two now how do we go to level two this is actually a little bit complicated because we need to notify all the characters that they have to change their position so platforms have to move eggs have to move but for now we're just going to broadcast a message this is in events and we select a new message and the message name will be level 2 so that we know what we're doing all right so now we have the general rules of moving the rabbit but we do not have the movement to the left to the right and jumping so let's code the movement and let's go jumping this will be done by using different keys on the keyboard so let's start from the left arrow key when the left arrow key is pressed we need to move left now when do we stop moving left we stop moving left when we release the arrow key just like in normal games if you're pressing we need to go if you're not pressing we stop so let's wrap it around in a loop called repeat until and we will repeat it until not key pressed so the key is not pressed anymore and remember that we need to check the left arrow key as well then we go to motion so we point in the right direction and the right direction if we go to the left is going to be to the left so it's minus 90. and then we change x by 10 which moves us to the left and this is optional but it makes the rabbit look look really really really really nice so if you go to looks you have a block called next costume and this will make the rabbits change the costumes um in a cycle when they're moving around and this will make it look a little bit like it's running like a real rabbit all right so now because the right arrow key is going to be very similar let's copy and paste the blocks by clicking right clicking on the on the whole panel on the yellow side and clicking duplicate and then another one will appear then change left arrow to right arrow change direction minus 90 to 90. and change minus 10 to 10. and this is the movement so the only thing that's left is the jumping for jumping we will use the app arrow key so let's start with event and again when the app arrow key is pressed but this time we will not use the repeat until block this is because we will not use change x but we will use gliding to make the movement more smooth so we go to motion and then in the motion category you have a block that says glide to a certain position so we will glide for half a second to a position so let's change one second to 0.5 and in the x we will leave the x position as it is and for y let's drag it here and then add a little bit to it so let's drag the plus operator and select y position plus 75 in this way the jumping position will be exactly the same but a little bit higher so it will not move left or right and when we have done that um let's wait one second so that we don't repeat the jump immediately otherwise it would be possible to double jump infinitely many times and it will be very easy to reach the star alright so this would be it for the movement of the rabbit now let's think of how can we code anything else so let's code the first egg sprite this will be my first egg sprite remember to check if you have an egg image here and when the green flag is clicked first let's create the score so we need to have a way to count how many x we have um we have collected so let's go to variables and make a variable called score for all sprites and set this variable to zero then we need to show the egg so even if we have eaten it in the previous game the game the egg will have to show up in the new game so let's show it and let's go to a certain position so every egg already has its own position so that's going to be the position for me and let's go to control and let's code what happens in the main game loop so throughout the entire game let's select an if block and if we are touching the rabbit this means that the egg has already been eaten so if we are touching the rabbit we will need to hide the egg so let's go to sensing and if touching rabbit then we need to hide the egg and another thing we'll need to do is increase the score of the player because they have eaten an egg so it's they should receive a point and is the goal of the game to collect all the eggs so let's go to variables again and change the score by one all right and that should be it don't worry if the x and y values are different because you have created different levels you might have different x and y now let's code the other two eggs so let's scroll down and go to egg two and again when the green flag is clicked we can show the egg and drag and drop the x and y go to x y motion block um if you don't want to code everything else from scratch you can go to egg and then drag and drop the code you have created into another sprite so you will see that it's tilting a little bit which means it have been selected so now if you go to act two you will see this block and you can just drag and drop it again so let's do the same for egg number three so let's start the game when the green pack is clicked then let's show the egg and let's go to the right position and then let's copy everything else okay and then put it in the right position all right so we should have all the xcoded already at least for the first level now we still don't have anything connected to the star so let's code the star and the star is going to be very similar so it has to start on the green flag as always it has to be shown and it has to go to the right position now forever if it's touching the rabbit then and we need to think of what happens next so if it's touching the rabbit let's touching the rabbit and then we actually need to hide the star because it's not possible to go from level two to level three anymore level three won't exist although you might want to create it yourself so we need to hide the star and we don't need to broadcast the message level two because it's already broadcast by um by by the rabbit so if you go to star this is more than enough so this will already work now we need to code the platform so that they start in the initial position as well so for every platform you see there will be a very very simple code when the green flag is clicked then you go to motion and go to the right position and again new platform when the green flag is clicked and then another one when the green track is clicked we go to x and y and the last one and in this way we can move the platforms around and change it to level two and when we press the green flag again it will still be level one so the positions that are on the start will be remembered by the game so next a little bit of design work again let's uh let's arrange our platforms in a different way so you can change the positions of everything okay and this will be my level two feel free to change it to any other level you you like and then when we receive message level 2 as was broadcast by by the rabbit we will have to change all the positions available so first of all let's go to the first button and let's select when i receive level 2 from the messages so when i receive level 2 and then go to motion and go to a new position and repeat that for every egg and every platform so when i receive level two drag and drop it you might be tempted to duplicate it however i advise you not to do it because then the positions will be duplicated as well which means you will not be able to change the position everything will be in the same position so the only thing i'm doing is dragging the when i receive level 2 and go to blocks and remember not to delete anything else all right i'm additionally for the eggs there will be one more thing to do um because when we eat all the eggs in level one they should still appear in level two so for the eggs let's go to looks and let's show the eggs again so when i receive level two we go to position and then show the ex you don't need to show the platform because the platform and the platforms never hide all right so right now you should have all the positions set and ready and you can save the project now you can give it a nice title and this will be it when it comes to coding so let's see how our project actually works so let's click the green flag and as you can see we are in the first level and we can jump around with a rabbit the rabbit moves like a real rabbit so it changes the costumes and if we go up then we jump it's quite difficult to navigate um yep but if it goes to to to high it comes down on the ground and then if we um reach the star then we can go to the next level and play around with the next level as well so that's it for today thank you very much for staying with us and thanks
