hi everyone and welcome back to our channel here we share beginner friendly tutorial videos on scratch roblox minecraft web programming and many more and today we're going to teach you how to draw an easter bunny in python turtle okay so first let's see how the project will look like at the very end this is my code and when you click run the turtle will draw an easter bunny for you so if you enlarge the screen a little bit you'll be able to see the whole bunny all right so let's get coding um you can see that i'm now on the raplet website and this i'm already logged in so if you haven't created an account you can log in with your google account or with your github account or just create a pure replit account and then you'll be taken to a menu like that and in the top left corner you will have an option new new repel which means just a new project so if you click on this there will be different languages to choose and today we're going to use python with turtle so i'm clicking python with turtle and let's give a meaningful name so i'm going to type in it's the bunny and just click create so this will take me to a whole new page with an empty place where i can type code and in the screen of that the result of my code will be visible so whatever i draw with my turtle it will be there first of all i'll import everything from the python turtle library and so that we can use all the custom functions that are there so let's write from turtle import star which means all and this imports all the functions that we need for today's project then let's set up the screen so the initial setup for any project is um creating the screen and for our case let's create the screen and then let's set the color to a certain color that we like and feel free to change any of the colors that i'm using but i'm just going to a background color i'm going to set it to wheat which will be a little bit like beige and then let's create a churchill so my turtle will be a turtle no wonder and secondly my turtle will also have a certain speed for this project because it's quite complicated well we have to draw a lot of shapes we will set the speed to fastest so that it doesn't take too long of time to draw okay so now we have created the screen and now we have also created the turtle the next thing we're going to do is define all the shapes so we're going to use a couple of different shapes we're going to use rectangles circles and arcs and it will be useful to put them all together in a function but before we do that um just a quick reminder if you like this video so far don't forget to subscribe to our channel like this video and check out all the other videos that we have also created all right so shapes let's define a function called my rectangle and it will have a couple of parameters um that we will be able to set each time we call the function later on in the code the t is going to be our turtle so even though it doesn't seem like a turtle yet we will use it like a turtle so first of all let's have an indentation and let's write d dot pin up and t dot color c this means we don't we are not drawing anything and we set the color to the correct one then we set the heading to zero which is the alignment so it will be facing in exactly the same direction at the beginning because sometimes we might we might change the heading later on and then we don't want to end up with a rectangular just like diagonally so we set the heading to zero and then we go to the right position so position x and position y this will be the starting position then we start drawing because we're already set up and to fill in different shapes we use the functions begin fill and enfield so before actually starting to draw let's use the function begin fill and this will start drawing the the shape that we want to have and start filling it in with a with a column then in the loop but a very short look because only twice we will go forward except and then right and then again forward and then again right theoretically i'm left with do as well it's just a matter of naming your variables and selecting which one is drawn first all right and we already have our rectangle we already have all the colors and speeds set up so the only thing we need to do is go out of the loop and end the filling so that was one tablet we're going to use a rectangle now let's do the circle so for the circle let's also define a my circle function this time with a circle position x position y um the radius and the color so circle does not have an x and y side it only has a radius and this is going to be very similar so actually we don't want to type that in again let's select all of this and paste it here remember to adjust the indentation so that um the indentation is correct so we have one indent from the def keyword and then after setting everything up let's do the circle however there is also a method called circle in the python turtle library so we just type in t circle r there is no need to do a loop because a function that draws the circle already exists and we only need to draw the circle once so we draw a circle and then we end fill all right so the last function that we're going to create um is a function called my arc and we will use quite similar arguments for those so my arc will have a turtle up position x position y and then a radius and an additional angle and a heading and then we will have the color so for this we will make it um very similar to the circle because there is a function that enables us to draw an arc based on the angle that we want to have so the angle that we want to cover and the radius of the circle already in python turtle so we can copy the whole my circle method but we need to be mindful because while pinup collar are the same the set heading will be set to a custom heading so this time we will have diff we can change the heading each time we use the function and then we go to the next position we start drawing begin filling it in and there is a way to draw an arc using the circle method the only thing you need to do is inside the the brackets you enter another argument which is r and angle yep and the arc function should already be done all right so these functions have already been created and all the help functions are ready now is the time to start drawing our bunny so let's start from the left ear the ear will be a rectangle and let's pass all the arguments now the turtle that we have created is called my turtle and then there will be a couple of numbers that um correspond to the right positions of every of every element of the bunny okay and then a circle so this will make the bunny ears look like that so there will be a rectangle and then a circle on the top which means um actually we will see it as a long ear with a semicircle so we also pass my turtle then minus 2 to 5 25 25 and silver so because it's the same color you want to see the edges and then we can theoretically also copy and paste those and change a couple of numbers so for this instead of 50 we'll do minus 240 and then 50 30. 90 and instead of silver we will do hot thing then here in minus 225 stays the same and then 35 and 15. and we change the color to hot pink as well uh pink all right and this means that the ears will have um another shape inside so the ear will be like that and then there will be additional narrower shape inside so just like in normal bunny ears and they are different so they have a different color on the inside all right so this is the left ear now as you can imagine the right ear will probably be quite similar but with a couple of positions changed so let's actually copy everything and write right here and in the first line change the x position to minus 180 minus 180 that's 280 yeah minus 180 and the rest stays the same then instead of minus 225 we will change it by 70 again so everything is shifted by 70 as you can see so it will be minus 155 25 and 25 and then we do minus 70 and then we do again minus 155 all right so this should be it for the ears now we need to create the head and the body so for the head and the body it will be rather circular because the head is quite similar to a circle um and the body will be similar to a circle as well in our case so um let's write comments saying head and body so that we know what we're doing but you don't need to write the comments and then let's create my circle with my turtle and minus 190 minus 220 100 and the color will be silver okay and let's copy it two times so that we can have three different lines here and in the second line change the second number to minus 5 500 and the last number to 150 and then you have minus 190 second number changed to minus 450 and a hundred and hot pink so this will be the inside of the belly kind of the inner side um all right so these three circles will serve as the head and the body and the next thing will be to create the eyes so let's think of how to create the eyes and as you can imagine eyes will not be rectangles ielts will be circles as well so let's write hashtag eyes my circle and the turtle we'll be drawing it and these are the numbers so minus 215 minus 110 and 10 and the color will be navy but of course you're happy to you're free to paint it and again copy and paste that and you can think for a second whether we should change the x coordinate or the y coordinate so a tip is that if you have an eye you usually have an eye next to it next to the the other eye so the position of the eye is changed horizontally this means again we only need to change the position of x so instead of minus 215 we will have minus 165 and this should be it for the eyes so again there is a lot of things on a bunny's face and another thing that we're going to create is the nose the nose actually will be a little bit complicated um not because it's more complicated than that but because we it's going to be um three lines so it's going to consist of three lines uh we don't have a custom function that creates three lines so we need to write everything from scratch again so let's write notes later on you can make that into a function but we will not reuse it we will just use it once here so there is really no point to make that a separate function um and similarly to the beginning in the custom functions we will use a similar technique to create the nodes and to set up the positions for the notes so first of all do my turtle dot pen up second of all my turtle dot go to minus 200 and minus 130 and then my turtle dot color hot pink then we put the pen down back again and begin filling and then we drove the three lines that i've talked about earlier so the first one will be this that's minus 130 so minus 180 and minus 130. and then we will do minus 190 and minus 150 right churchill dot go to minus 200 and minus 130. so actually these will not be three lines this will be three points uh between which we will draw two different lines so this will be like a typical nose from a cartoon or something so the last thing probably that we have left is the mouth um when it comes to the the bunny's face so the mouth that is going to be very very easy that's right hashtag mouth and you can think of what is a mouth so how does a mouth look like when you're drawing a cartoon or just painting by yourself but a mouth is usually something like this so it's usually an arc um but it's it's upside when it's when somebody's happy it's um the other way around and somebody's sad but it's usually a part of a circle so in this case it's going to be a part of a circle as well so my arc my turtle and minus 190 minus 150 20 150 minus 90. and there's a lot of numbers but you can just safely copy them and then also hot pink and let's copy and paste that and change things a little bit so this will be this will be unchanged this will be unchanged let's change the 20 to 20 and leave everything else so these two arcs will be for the mouth of the bunny and now let's try to write the easter wishes so let's have a comment that says text and then my turtle dot up because we need to leave the place where we uh while we are drawing and go up so we'll change the position without drawing anything 200 and 200 set the color to navy that's at least in my design and then hand down which means start drawing and then there is a special function called write and the first line will just say happy because happy and easier so first we will do happy then align option will be equal to center and the font will be equal to open bracket close bracket um impact that's the name of the font i'll remember to make it capitalize and then in the inner brackets you still write a hundred and bold because these are all information concerning the type of font that we used and then let's copy the go to line and this time let's go to 100 and 100 so a little bit lower and my turtle dot pen down and again we can copy the right line this time because we need to write easier this time so this will also use the same font and the same function just we just need to write easter instead of happy and if we want the e string to be a little bit larger we can even make um the 100 into a 110 so that it's slightly larger but feel free to change it okay so the last thing is hiding the turtle because we don't want the turtle to stay on our easter card especially if you want to send it to somebody but if you like turtles on easter cards you also have you're also free to um leave it there and there's a method for that called height turtle so if we hide the turtle we just need to write the name of the turtle.height turtle and it will hide itself all right so right now let's see how it actually looks like so if we run it you will see a bunny here and the most the mouth looks a little bit funny um but the body is a circle and it has the right ears and there is also a happy easter sign at the very top and if you make the screen bigger you can see everything at the same time so this is for you to adjust okay that would be it for today thank you very much for staying with us and don't forget to subscribe and like this video you can also check out all the other videos that we have done while you're waiting for the next one to come thanks again for staying with us and goodbye
