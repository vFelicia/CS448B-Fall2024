hello everybody welcome back to our channel here we share beginner friendly coding tutorials on scratch roblox minecraft web programming and many more today we're going to create a web survey form in this project i'll teach you how to make a web online survey form that asks the user about the recycle habits this project will use html and css we also teach you input types such as submit buttons radio buttons check boxes and text boxes there's also a template below in the description to follow along so let's get started so i've opened up the templates from the description below in my codependent io and here we can see the basic structure of our website we have two field sets the first field set as for the personal information like first name last name email and phone number while the second field sets ask the recycling habits that the user has and here are the different types of inputs and different types of questions that are provided for us so we begin by looking at the first field set for the personal information and adding text boxes so that user can put in their own information here so below first name for our label let's add a text box and here we can write inputs type and input specified um that this whole div is going to be a a text box and so we can use input tag for a text box so here we can have input and the type of the inputs will be text because we're expecting text coming in as first name we're given an id of first name so i will write f and then name indicating first name and i also give this uh inputs an id and a name called uh first name as well so fname and then i'll add a small break uh so that the next field will be pushed um to the next line so here i'll add break that so here as you can see in our templates that we have added a text box right next to first name so let's do the same for the other ones um here for the last name i'm going to add once again another text box and the tag for text box is again inputs here we're expecting text again for last name similar to first name so here we're going to say types equals text for id i'm going to give it the id of last name so here i'm going to write l name transfer last name and i'm also going to give it the same name of l name and again i'm going to add two breaks give us some room in our survey and here for emails again we're going to use uh a text box so here we write inputs um for the type however email actually have their own type so we can write type as email and now we do id which we can just write email and set a name for this check uh text box which is also the email again we add two uh breaks to separate the fields so here we have first name a check uh text box last name text box email text box and then lastly phone number um so again we have a text box for a phone number so here we write inputs indicating it's a text box uh type again we just want text for this so we write text the id let's give it an idea phone number with a capital n and no spaces in between and the name will use the same name as the id again so it will be phone number and again we're just going to add two breaks so that it'll be easier for the user to identify between the text boxes and now if you look at our demo in the bottom you see that we have text boxes next to all the personal information now let's take a look at the second field set of our website which asks our user their recycling habits so the first question that we have under here as you can see for label for recycle habits is how often do you recycle and here we want to give the user a couple of options so the first option we will give is daily second is going to be monthly we can also give them weekly and then maybe not sure so there will be four choices for the user and they can only pick one in this case we want to use the type radio buttons which will only allow users to select one of the options that are given so here underneath our line 19 here uh how often do you recycle let's go down and start writing our code so here we are again asking for an input so let's type in inputs and for the type instead of text or email like before where it will provide us a text box let's write type to be radio and let's set the id uh to the corresponding value for each option so the first option i'm going to give is daily so the id for the first one should be called daily and i'm going to assign a name and the name here should be related to the question that's being answered so here we're asking about how often you recycle so i'm just going to write recycle and the value again should be the same as id which in our case for the first one will be daily so after we gave them the option to select this uh button uh daily uh we don't actually know that this button is daily as you can see there's nothing that states that it is daily so let's go underneath and give it a label so here we can just type label and we can type it for uh daily and here we can set the word inside to be daily and we can close the label and add a break so now let's go back and see now we have a checkbox with the daily option right next to it now let's give it a second option here again i'm gonna write input and type of radio and here the id is gonna be weekly this is the second option that we will give the user and the name again is gonna be recycle since this is still part of the same question and the value will be equal to weekly and here again we're going to have label for weekly and here we can just write weekly so that the user can see close the label and again add a break as you can see now we have daily and weekly um let's add the other two options we have real quick so the third option we have again all of these are going to be radio uh or type of radio and then the third option we have is monthly so here we can set id equals to monthly and the name again should be recycled since we're answering the question for recycle and the value should be set equal to the id which in our case is monthly and again let's add a label so the user knows what that button is for so we set a label for monthly and whoops and in there we'll write monthly close the label and add a break so you see now we have monthly as a third option and last option is not sure so here again i'm gonna write um inputs type of radio id um just gonna write not sure name is gonna be recycle and um made a typo up here uh the name field should always be in string so you always need the double parameters to uh quote around the words so here name should be inside the quote um recycle and the value should be equal to not sure same as the id and like we have done before and i've just realized again i've made more typos uh here it should be label not label so yep can't spell so label here label for i'm not sure here we can just write not sure close the label and uh break so as you can see most of these are actually behind the camera so we actually can't see the id the name or the valley of this of these uh buttons but we can see the label um so whatever you put in here should corresponds to the answer um that if they click on this so yeah um that is our first question how often do you recycle and we have given them four options all right so now that we have uh looked at text and email for text boxes as well as radio buttons which only allows us to select one let's take a look at the third fields which is the second question in our recycling habits here the question is what materials do you recycle take all applicable so all of these that are um applicable by the user should be selected um so here um we want to have multiple selection if possible and as you can see in the um the templates here the code for all the options and questions are included however the type of the input is missing so here um since we know that's more than one option is possible we want to use the checkbox option so here in the input type we're gonna write check box like this and we're going to write it for all of these input types so here for input types i'm going to write checkbox and if you really want you can copy and paste them into the checkbox as every one of these will be have type of checkbox for the inputs so here is you see inputs type um just put in checkbox in here okay awesome so i've put checkbox for the types for all of these inputs and now if i just go down you can see that i can select um any one of these and just unselect it by clicking it again cool okay so now i'm looking at um the third question that we have we have under here and obstacles um what obstacles if any keep you from recycling circle off from circle order applies in this case we know that we should use checkbox because more than one of the field could be selected um here however in the templates we are not providing any solutions so um we can simply copy this format with the input type checkbox given id a name and a value and then the label for this and so i'll go over a couple of examples for any reasonable answer but here you guys can put in your own answer if you want um if you have any um kind of ideas on what people might say then um or might pick then you can put that as an option here um i'm gonna put my first option and here i'm gonna set the input type to checkbox i'm just gonna have id called no bins in this case my reasoning this is gonna be i don't have a bin so here the id is going to correspond to the answer once again so id is going to be no bins and i can say obstacle um the name will be obstacle because that is the answer i'm trying to um well that is the question i'm trying to answer i mean and here uh the value will be again the same as the id which is no bins after this i should create a label uh the label should be for no bin so here the label 4 should be including the id here and then inside of the label i'll just write i know bins are available close off the label and add a break as you can see i've added no bins are available let's add one more or a couple more just so you guys can see what kind of things we're doing and then you guys can replicate and just kind of write your own id and your own reasoning below so it's fine if you have more than two or three options um you can have as many options as you want as long as they're all valid here i'm going to say bins full this is another reason name again is going to be obstacle and the value is going to be again fins full same as the id let's create the label for uh bin is full so things full and inside the um label we'll just say bins are full and close the label and add a break so as you can see we have our second checkbox ready to go so i actually have gone ahead and added four more options so the first option i have added without behind the scene is unsure um so i said unsure if products are recyclable um here again we have check box being our type id being insured name being obstacles and value being id um the second one i've added is too much um time consuming or too much time is needed so too much time consuming or too time consuming the third option is we don't know where to recycle and the fourth option is that we don't care about recycling so in total we have six options now so including the two that we did on camera uh now we have six options and uh yeah so they have the same uh parameters in terms of type and name but the id and value which is the same should corresponds to the individual answers that we have so here are the uh some of the ideas for you to pick um that's an answer so now let's look down that's our at our next question here we have do you have any uh recycling collection points where you live and here we are actually given a selection of four options and here we don't actually have all four options yet as you can see and in the drop bar you can just see that there are four options available but none of them actually are filled in because we haven't filled in the option values here um so you want to keep the first option as error just you know in case the user don't have an answer for us here we can start writing our other options that the user can't pick on the first option i'm going to write is not sure um second option is probably yes and then followed by now so i'll give the user three different choices it's going to be not sure yes and no or they can just pick nothing in this case it will be the error so let's do not sure first so value of not sure and inside here we can just write not short so the user knows that this option for not sure now let's do yes so i'll just write the value as yes and um in the text i'll write yes so the user knows this corresponds to the answer yes and lastly we have no and again we'll put no here and now you see that we have filled up the four options and if you go down to this question and we go to selection we can see that yes no and not sure is a part of our selection so now we have three more questions uh which is what types of bag does your family use for shopping and do you believe recycling is important and any general comments about the recycling program um so for the first two fields we see that uh we should be able to select one options because here is asking for what type of bag so we should only be able to select one and here do you believe recycling is important again we should only be able to select one option because you cannot have two opinions on the same thing um so here in um our first question that we looked at what type of bag does your family use for shopping um we know that since we can only select one option we should use the radio type again so here for the type i'm gonna write radio all right and um here for input type i'm gonna write radio again radio and here this is a second question do you believe recycling is important again we want to use the radio type for the input so radio radio and now if we look down we can select one of the options but not all of them just like we wanted and a quick spot at some typo actually from the templates we see that here it says input type um id is plastic however we put the label for paper and here we have a layer of paper and they actually both plastic so let's just switch that real quick um it's not a big deal so here instead of paper um we should have a label for plastic and instead of the label saying paper we'll say plastic and here the label should be for paper and the label should also say paper and let's just add the label type here reusable bag again this label 4 should match the id above and again we'll just do um label for here real quick awesome and uh quickly um here are actually our second question does not contain the label for so here we're just gonna write the label and here remember that the name corresponds to the label that we use for the question so here recycle important uh is the name so here we're going to say label 4 recycle importance i just copy and paste this name over here and so for the last question uh again we're gonna need to pull in the label for the actual question which will be the same as the name here's general comments so we can just write general comments and make sure it's spelt the same way as the name and lastly for the input type um we just want the user to be able to type something so here we want them to have some kind of text box so we can just write text indicating text box and yeah so now we have our questions and the options or answers formatted correctly and we can move on to the css part of this project and actually before we move to css we're missing one key components which is the submit button as you see we're um almost complete with our html we have all the fields and all the selection for the user however we do not have a submit button so there's no way for the user after filling out the forms to submit it so at the bottom here let's add a button for submit and so here we have input and for the type it's gonna equal to submit this is the submit button and the value we're going to set it to submit as well and on the bottom uh we'll just add bricks and then we can write a link here the link will just um be empty for now and we can write show survey results after submitting form slash a and we can put the link so that the user can see their submission or the result um in here inside of this a now when we save it we see that we have a submit button as well as a link that will point our user to the results of the server all right let's move to the css part um so in the css part the first thing i'm going to do is import some fonts from the google api um so to import something we can do at import um here we're going to include the url where the api is called and inside of it we're going to put the link of the api here we're gonna have um this url that will call and get the uh monster at uh font for us which is what we wanted now let's style our websites here let's just style our overall body to be uh to begin with first i want my body to have a background color so that it's not plain white and let's set a light green color um similar to the environment and following the recycling theme here next let's turn the color for text to black and let's add margin to automatic so that um we can have more space and more um or it seems more spacious next let's make the text aligned um to be justified and let's set the font weight to be fuller bolder like that and let's set the fonts family to the fonts we imported which is one serrat and we're just gonna use sans surfy okay and uh now we can start styling our link at the bottom here so go down uh we can select the link which is a under tag a and we can set it with a color of zero zero zero zero ee so four zeros and two e's and this will highlight it blue now let's do our css on our field sets so here i'm gonna write shield sets and let's add the background color to begin with and here i'm going to use this tag called f9 fa fc up to the spectacular color and it's pretty beige white and you'll go over the green background that we have for the body uh next let's add some margin top and we add two percent to the margin top um let's again add some margin to the left now and we'll put 10 percent for margin left and now we also add margin bottom here we add three percent um and then we add a width for this uh field set and we will set the width to be 70 percent so now you see that we have kind of lessened the size of this field set and centralized a little bit more next we're going to add a webkit border and so here we're going to say uh webkit border dash radius and the radius we're going to have is 8 pixels and now let's also add um this mohs border and we set the radius for this also to eight pixels and now we just add in case none of these work we add just a normal border here got eight pixels again so now you can see we have the border on our um shield set and now um let's take a look at these titles here as you can see in our html we have it underneath the tag legend so let's format legend and to change the recycling habits and personal information text so here we'll type legend i'll begin by starting to change the background color and i'll change it to purple next i'll change the text to white and i'll also add a padding on 5 pixels on the top and right and 10 pixel in the left and bottom right and i also give an order of solid 1 pixel and the color black awesome now again i would do something similar with the border here i'll add a web uh here the webkit should have a dash here i had a web kit a border of radius um again we add uh eight pixels and if that doesn't work we'll try most border slash radius again we have eight pixels and if that again doesn't work i'll add just a normal border radius of 8 pixels and finally i'm just going to add padding of 6 pixel on every side to give a little bit more room i see our legend text is formatted nicely so the last uh two minor things where they do for css is the inputs and the title um so here let's do the inputs real quick um for inputs are we adding is a margin of 5 pixels and for the title which we have labeled as using an id so we have to identify it using an id idf title let's add a margin of top from 30 uh 30 pixels set the text to centralized by setting the text align to center and i'll increase the size of the fonts by setting the font size to 30. awesome so now if you just take a look at our website as you can see we have our two field sets with each questions and text box and here you can select options and whatnot and then we have a submit button so yeah that is uh the whole project so that's all for today in today's tutorial we learned to make a simple web survey form we made use of html to structure the different input types like radio buttons submit buttons text boxes and check boxes we also use css to design our question elements feel free to make any changes to the website um as you see fit make sure to subscribe to our channel um to check out the next section of this project i hope you guys enjoyed i thank you bye bye
