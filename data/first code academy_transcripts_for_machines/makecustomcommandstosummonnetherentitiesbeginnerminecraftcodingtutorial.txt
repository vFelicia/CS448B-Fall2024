hello everyone today we'll be making a nether portal and in this nether portal we're going to use command blocks and summon a wither and blaze so what we're going to use is learn to mod and that will be the tool that we're using to code today before we begin we're first going to look at the project and then we're going to start coding so here we're going to look at our mod that we've made so first i would suggest you to click on mod and then head back to your minecraft then we move into our another land here so we have quite a few weathers already so so first open your mod here and then click on it bring it here press on one click on this then you press on p type in place press on t type in summon and you have all over the place and for wither you just type in t wither t again summon and you get withers over here so if you want more blaze t again blaze t so now we're gonna make our project let's head into learn to mod log in click on play click on the arrow and then click on mods once we're here we're gonna type in nether entities since i already have this project i'm gonna have to put a number two and click on block lead multiplayer once it loads up click on c inside and then click on code once it's loaded we can head to function take out function do something and change this to main so the next thing we want to do is click on events and take out a do function when blank happens so in here we're going to click back on events we're going to take take out this block break event put it inside and change this to player chat so this will run when the player uses the chat function in minecraft and it's asking here do function blank so we're going to be making another function head to functions take out function do something change this to another entities then click on the gear drag out the input name as this is what our parameter is and we're going to call it info so before we begin we need to think of what we're going to spawn so we're going to spawn a wither and a blaze so the first thing we'd like to do is head over to logic now in logic we take out this block here and we duplicate it and add in a equal sign by clicking logic and then putting this here next what we want to add here is we want to take out something called a variable so we're going to take out this set item we're gonna make a new variable and call it spawn type so we can duplicate this and bring one here so for example if the spawn type is equal to this then we're going to have a base so for it to equal something we want to now check what the user types so in that case we'll click on the misc take out js code add one here and add another one here so this is gonna be info dot message this one also will be info dot message and then here what we're gonna add is if the message is a wither so in order to do that click on text take out a blank text box add one here and then add another here so here you type in weather here you type in blaze then we just copy this and add this here so what happens with this is if the user types in weather we're setting the spawn type together if the user types in place we're setting the spawn type to blaze so next we want to use a drone to place in this object so we head into logic and take out an influence add that here and then just copy paste this but instead we're not going to use info message here we are going to use the variable spawn type because that's the information that we need so head to variables take out spawn type put one here and then you can just duplicate this and add this here so one is blaze and one is wither so what happens is we now want them to place this so we click on drone take out drone place block or mob we're going to use mob because these are mobs we're referring to so we take out mob add this here and then we click on entities and take out this so we can just duplicate this add one here and add another here so this one is going to be called blaze this one is our wither so as that's done we also need to add in one more logic block so here we're going to add a logic block here and we're going to take these two statements and actually place them inside the reason being is when we want to spawn in any type of entity we'll be using something called a drone a drone is a device that flies around and it's used in places to deliver food chocolate and other items but in minecraft we can use it to place in our entities so to do that first we're gonna click on variables take out set you can put this here and change set item you can re make a new variable call it d and then you can put in a drawer so you click on drawn take out new drone and add this here so in order to have that work we click on this and just duplicate it and add it here but instead the text that we're going to add here is summon and then here to run our function we have to find this so this block is in misc function main we're going to change this as it's not going to call itself we're going to change this to another entities so let's look at this code and break it down so first we've made a function called main and this is the main function that minecraft is going to call so it understands that to run a function called netherentities under the event that the player chants and when that happens this function is going to run now let's dive into what nether entities function with info is so we've given it a parameter of info this is known as some information that the function would need then we have said if info dot message is equal to wither we set the spawn type together then in the next conditional it checks to see if the message that the user has sent is equal to blaze and if that happens we're setting the spawn type to blaze so here we have now specified either wither or blaze then we have a third conditional saying that if the user has typed in summon in the chat bar then it will make use of the drone and place this item and inside of this conditional we have this nested conditional which says that if the spawn type is blaze and that is what the user typed previously then it will spawn in place on the other hand if it's if the user is typed in wither it will then spawn in a wither so to test this out let's click on mod over here and on another window i have my server open so all you have to do is click on your server start click on join server it will start loading up which takes around five to seven minutes and then you can just copy paste your server code as for me i'm already in my server so we're gonna look at how it looks so over here i have minecraft and i'm already on the server so first i'm gonna change the weather to clear and we're gonna set the time today so once that's done we're gonna head to a nether portal and before we head there we should make sure that our game mode is set to creative so now that we're in creative mode we can head to our portal over here so this is a portal made with the obsidian blocks and here we have the portal so we have to just jump inside and just wait until we're teleported so over here we have some withers that are already spawned previously so let's move along here so for example we can open our mod here select this and then right click so first what we can do is press t type wither and then d type in summing and then another wither appears here and we can type in t type in blaze d and type in summon and it plays once over here as you can see thank you very much for watching this video i hope you liked it if you did like it please make sure to like share and subscribe to
