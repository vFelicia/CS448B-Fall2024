hello everyone welcome to first code academy today we are going to make a traffic light circuit using arduino in this project i'll be using arduino uno and some hardware components to build up the traffic light circuit and to code the program i'll be using the software m you may find the link to download the software mbot in the description box below all right the components that we would need to build up the traffic light circuit would be an arduino uno with the connector cable three 220 ohm resistors one breadboard three colored ladies with red yellow green colors each representing a traffic light color and finally we would need some jumper os so let's go ahead and see how we can build the circuit and program it all right once we have getted all our hardware components let's go ahead and build our traffic light circuit first i'll be using a breadboard which i'm going to use as my base plate to build up my circuit next i'm going to set up my three colored led lights on my breadboard first i'll be using a breadboard which is going to be my baseplate to build up my circuit next i'm going to set up my leds led stands for light emitting they are light up just like mini bombs when electricity is powered and led have two legs one leg is longer than the other the longer leg is known as the anode which is also our positive leg the shorter leg is known as cathode which is the negative leg so i'm going to spread my legs a little bit further apart and i'm going to place my longer lid on my right hand side and the shorter leg on my left hand side so next i'm going to use my yellow led i'm going to spread them out like that and i'm going to place my shorter leg on my left hand side and the longer leg on my right hand side same goes for my green led so once i have set up my leds on my breadboard next i'm going to use resistors to control the amount of electricity that is passing along each route so i'm going to connect one end of the resistor to the negative side of the led like that and the other end of the resistor i'm going to connect to the negative rail of the breadboard so i can connect to any negative on the breadboard like that so i'm going to repeat the same steps for all other two leds i'm going to connect one end of the resistor to the negative leg of my led and the other end of the resistor to the negative of y same goes for my green and led i'm going to connect to the same hole that has the negative like and then i'm going to connect to any rail of the negative when you're building the circuit make sure that the shorter length of the led and one end of the resistor should be connected in the same column of the breadboard all right so once i have connected my leds next i'm going to connect the leds with the arduino board all right now i'm going to connect my red led to pin 10 in my arduino board so i'm going to connect the longer leg of the red led to pin 10 in my arduino board awesome so i'm going to repeat the same step for my real led and my green led i'm going to connect the longer leg of my yellow led to pin 9 and the positive leg of the green led to pin 8. so once i have connected my leds with the resistors and the arduino pins next i need to complete my circuit so i'm going to connect the negative and the positive rails of the breadboard to the ground pin and the five volt pin respectively on the arduino owner arduino uno is a mini computer that is used to make simple robots and machines we can use an arduino uno to connect a hardware circuit with a software all right now once we have built our circuit let's look how we can program our traffic lights so how does a traffic light actually work first it will light up the red light that is followed by the yellow light and finally the green line so when we are coding the actual flow of the traffic light would be first we are going to on our red led next we are going to switch off the red led and then on the yellow led and the third step would be we are going to switch off the yellow led and then on the green led and finally the green led would light off and then it will switch on the red led to give the actual flow of traffic lights so let's go ahead and see how we can program this circuit on m block in order to connect my employee platform with my arduino uno i need to add my device into the platform so i'm going to click on the add device option next i'm going to find my arden uno and i'm going to click ok now once i have added my arduino owner component onto the m block platform i'm going to switch the mode to live next i'm going to the yellow color blocks that is called events and i'm going to drag the event block when the green flag is clear next in order to light up my leds repeatedly i'm going to drag a forever loop which you can find in the control blocks next i'm going to configure my arduino pins first i need to light up my red led so i'm going to bring the block set digital pin and i'm going to change the pin to be 10. next i'm going to give a weight block such that the red led lights up for 2 seconds next in my traffic light flow my yellow led should be light up while my red led should be sharp next i'm going to configure the pins for my red led to be low and for the yellow led it should be high so i'm going to drag and set digital pin block and i'm going to make it 10 i'm going to set the output as low next i'm going to drag in the same block again and i'm going to change the pin to b9 and i'm going to leave it as high next i'm going to bring a rate block again and i'm going to change it to be two seconds in my third step of the traffic light flow the green led should be light up while the yellow leds should be so sharp so i'm going to configure the pins of the green led and the yellow led so i'm going to switch on the yellow led wow i'm going to switch on my green led all right so in the last step the green leds should be switched off so i'm going to put another way block change it to be two seconds next i'm going to drag in the set digital pin block and i'm going to change it to begin a and i'm going to set it as lock to switch off my green lady all right now once we have finished our project let's go ahead and connect with our arduino uno so i'm going to click on connect this will show me the code where my arduino board is connected next i'm going to click on connect in order to make sure that your code is directly uploaded onto your arduino board i'm going to click on settings and i'm going to click on update firmware i'm going to go ahead and click on connect once again so in order to try out our circuit i'm going to click on green flag again you
