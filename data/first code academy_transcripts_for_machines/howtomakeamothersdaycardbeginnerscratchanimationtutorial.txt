hello everyone welcome back to our channel here we share beginner friendly tutorials on roblox minecraft scratch and many more today we'll be doing a special project with mother's day coming up we'll be creating a mother's day card on scratch so let's go ahead and take a look at the project alright so in this project we'll be creating a mother's day card which displays a custom message to your mother when the card is open in this project we'll be using costumes of sprites to make it more lively we'll be using custom costumes and we will also be using concept of clones and broadcast messages to pop up particular sprites at a given time let's take a look at the project first so when i click on the card it will open and it will display happy mother's day and there will be another spike that pops up which i can click on which says press letter to read and then it will display your custom message that you want to write for your mother so let's get started with this project alright so next we're going to create a new project on scratch now you can go to scratch by going to scratch.mit.edu the link will also be in the description down below then you will go to create and we'll be creating a new project now once we start a new project we're going to straight away delete this cap because we're not going to be using this in our project and we're going to be uploading our custom sprites now you can go ahead and download custom sprites um yourself as well but make sure they are transparent background so it'll be easier for you for this project i'm going to be using these an envelope a message a letter and some flowers all of those sprites will be available to you as well in the description down below so you can go ahead and download those and once you download those you want to go and click on upload sprite and you want to start just uploading them on your scratch so as soon as i upload the flower it will now appear over here so i have already gone and uploaded all four of my strikes down here so i have my flower my letter my envelope and my greeting card now the first thing you want to straight away do is start resizing them in the beginning so our greeting card we're going to change it the size to 70 75 maybe the envelope let's make it um 40 let's make it 40. the letter will be the same size we're just going to center it out for now and the flower we can't really see it but let's change the size of the flower to 20. and then with uploading all of these all of these sprites in this into your scratch you will also notice that in the files that you have downloaded if you're making an animation of course that the greeting card is has includes a bunch of costumes so you want to also go ahead and upload those costumes by going into the costume section of the greeting card and click on upload and upload all the costumes in the order of the animation and once you do so you'll notice that you have all these costumes frame by frame which is ready for animating so go ahead and do that and we will start coding this section also if you like this video so far don't forget to subscribe to our channel and like this video because there's more stuff to be coming in the future as well alright so now that we have all four of our sprites you have your costumes all in we have them all sized up and ready to be coded let's start coding with our greeting card sprite so in our greeting card sprites we want it to first be on clicked we want it to show up now let's just remove this letter out of the way for now so that we can see our greeting card in the front okay that's better now we're going to add an event called when flag clicked and we want the starting costume to be the costume number one so you remember how we have different costumes for our greeting card so we wanted to start with costume number one when we first click on the flag so we're gonna go into the looks section and we're going to click on drag the switch costume to our first costume and we're also going to center it down so to make any object in the center you need remember the xy coordinates is always 0 0 so we can just make this 0 0 and when i click the flag it will now be in the center we also want it to show in the beginning because we at some point we're gonna hide it down so we want it to show when we click on the flag next what we're gonna do so you see where it says press to open that means we're asking whoever is using it to press on the sprite so that means we're gonna click on our events and search for when sprite clicked right over here and what we want actually to happen when the sprite is clicked we want our animation to run through so in our costumes depending on how many costumes you have you want to see what's your ending number so my costumes over here ends at 11. that means we want it to change costumes 10 times until it reaches that 11 frame so we're gonna get a repeat 10 exactly the number i need you don't need to change it if you if you have more than 11 costumes or more than you know 12 or 13 you want to change it to the whatever number is before the final number so for example if your costumes is at 14 you want to make sure the repeat is 13. so my costumes at 11 so i'm going to leave it at 10 over here okay then i'm gonna go to my looks tab and grab my next costume which is gonna switch that into the next costume and before we switch into the next costume let's also add a weight so that we can see that transition happening let's make that wait 0.5 seconds you know nice and small not too slow not too fast just good enough to show that transition so far so good let's look at the flag and click on it to see what happens so now it's in the center now i can click on the sprite and you'll see that we have a nice animation playing not too slow and then it goes towards the end and when i click on the flag it will go back to its starting place great so don't worry about all these rest of these sprites around right now we're gonna make sure they're also not messing around um and tidy up the entire space when we start going into those codes now to finish up our greeting card what we want to also do is when the greeting card is fully open we want to send a broadcast message to our envelope to our message that is fully open and we want it to pop up so what we're going to do is we're going to go in our control um events actually we're going to go in our events and we're going to do a broad when i receive over here and we're gonna make it new message and say it read letter let's just have no space over there or actually this is gonna be letter open not read letter sorry my bad but this is gonna when i receive letter open okay wrong button my back um so we're actually gonna just broadcast it down um after it's done looping that repeat over there so just gonna create this letter open that we just accidentally made in the broadcast when i received you just want to put it down over here and so whenever that loop is finished it's gonna send broadcast that letter open message over there to your envelope all right keeping up so far that's good now let's go move along to our envelope and we will now code inside to the start of animation we want it to first appear somewhere so we want to have a when clicked and you want to make the mo it go to a certain position so let's say we want it to go somewhere over here i think it's a little bit too big still so i'm going to just reduce the size to maybe 20. that's a good size all right again if it's too big or too small you can always just modify the size according to how you want it to be now um so that's the position i re i want it to pop up so now i'm going to put my go to x and y over here so that when when it's clicked it's going to show up in that position but first of all we want it to be hidden when the flag is clicked because we don't want it to be appear visible when the first when we first start the project we want it to be only popped up when we have the broadcast message from our greeting card which is that letter open so we're gonna get uh when i receive so this is where we're actually gonna do a when i receive over here we're gonna put that when i receive letter open that means whenever you get that message from the greeting card we want to first of all make sure that is in the front of the layer so we're going to put in our in our looks tab go to front layer and we're going to make it show so now it's going to make sure it pops up whenever it receives that message lastly what we want to do is we also want to trigger it so that when we click on it it opens and broadcasts the message for our letter we're setting it up for our letter code to there so we're gonna again do a when sprite clicked when this right clicked and we're gonna broadcast message and change it to a new message and this time it's gonna be read letter all right now we after we have clicked the sprite we don't want this envelope to be still there so what we're going to do is we're going to go in our looks and hide it now there's another feature in scratch where you can do is we can set the ghosting effect if you look over here there is a block called set color effect what will this do basically it will slowly hide it if we change it to ghost and make it to 100 so it will slowly fade away that envelope making it like a slow transition and it will just make it more natural in the transition all right now we want to just go back in our greeting card because we also want to hide our greeting card when the read letter is there received so we're going to go in our events when i receive read letter and we're gonna hide it as well great so we're done with our greeting card and we're done with our envelope so you can now move on to our letter and flowers so now that we're done with both of those we can now move this towards the center because we're going to be working in the letter now click on the letter and the costumes because right now we don't have any text inside and we want to make it personalize and you know start making some messages um what you want to actually tell your mother so you know you can write down a whole list of lines or whatever you want to write so use your use your text tool down here and start typing like you want to thank your mother thank you for everything write some words for your mother it's like you're thanking your mother for mother's day and you can write thank you for everything thank you for your hugs and love and then you know you can keep on writing you can use different colors so i'm done with this text over here maybe i can write a little view over here and then you can just change the color something else you know you can you can be creative with it just you know it's a message that you want to tell your mother so just use your own kind of what you want to tell her and you can even draw stuff so if you use your paintbrush and you know maybe you can draw like a heart you know you can fill that heart make it more you know more personal you know you can draw it's like a letter you know imagine you're writing a letter so that's how you can actually once you're done and you're happy with it you can put it down and we can actually start coding inside this letter okay so let's click on the code and we will start beginning our letter sprite now obviously the first thing we want it to be is hidden when we actually start the project so you want to go to events when flag clicked and you want to hide it in the beginning because we don't want it to be shown in the beginning right we want it to have like a slow process or you click the button and then it shows so we want it to be triggered from our envelope remember where we had a broadcast read letter so we want it to be whenever that read letter is sent we want it then to be shown so we will have go to our events when i receive read letter we will you know show it show right there and just to be safe we can also put a go to so that it goes to this position that we have it positioned right now all right so now that we have our letter envelope and greeting card the last thing we have remaining is just to add some you know sparkles some confetti some flowers just make it a little bit more you know some some decoration just to make it more interesting or you can say beautiful um so you know you can take um flowers you can take some confetti however you want you can choose your sprites for for this project i'm going to use the flowers that we had before and i'm going to first make sure that the flower sprite is hidden on the top screen so you can't really see the flower right now um let's just bring it up so that we can see it properly for our code yeah actually it's fine you don't really need to see it anyway um let's bring it here okay so you can see it's slightly there so you'll notice when i make changes to the code so i will put a when flag clicked and then i'll make it go to a random position because we want it to be coming up from running position i'm just going to change the values to make it 160 over here and we're going to use the pick random and just put in some values where we want it to be randomly showing up from and we want it in the beginning to be hidden because we don't want the flowers to be shown in the beginning then we will have a when i receive so when i receive read letter and we will create a forever loop over here because we want it to be forever and this is where we will start using clones of the flower so we will create a clone of the flowers that it's like a raining effect so let's go into our control and we will select create clone of myself and before we you know create a clone and multiply we want it to wait so we're going to put a wait one second over here and we're going to randomize the time the reason why we give it a random time is just to adjust the timing you know how they fall around so you can change it according to your liking doesn't have to be the values that i input down to all right so far so good now finally what we want to do is we need to instruct each clone to be falling down from the top of the screen in order to have a cluster of flower sprites at the bottom of the screen so what we'll do is we will add a conditional statement which will check if the position of the flowers is equal to minus 180 which is the lowest coordinate on the screen and as soon as it is in the lowest coordinate we want the clone to be deleted so that it can come back from the top so let's go ahead and do that part we will go ahead first and put in a when i start as clone from our control section then we will do a go to x and y again we're going to be randomizing the position of it so pick random randomize the values and finally we actually want it to show up as well because we haven't really showed the flowers yet we're just it's all working hidden right now and we want it to show when it starts to start as a clone then we want to put a forever loop and we want to just change the y start to change the y position because it's the up and down position then we put a weight before it clones so we put it 0.5 seconds and this is where we will check the condition that if the position is you know below 180 so we go to operator equals and we want to check the y position so we go to motion y position down here and make it minus 180 and we want to delete this clone if it gets to that point all right so that is the code for this portion now you can take a look at this code over here now also one by one make sure that you you can look at all the codes that we have for all of the sprites but let's look at the project and see what we have so far let's click on the flag you know we have our greeting card press to open it's going to transition into that animation and then we have our letter that's popped up again you can modify the position to another place and then your letter will pop up and your flowers should start to clone all right so let's look at our code one by one just to make sure that you have the code correctly done so i can zoom in to all of them so you have in our greeting card we have these codes right here in our envelope we have these codes right here so at any point you can pause the video just so you can see that you have everything correct sounds good that's good all right and then next we have in our letter we have these codes right here and in the flower we have zoom out we have these codes right here okay so one thing we want to just change this to change y not set y because that that's why it's not really working because you want to want to set it right that was the only thing that was wrong but first of all it's all correct and you can now create your own special mother's day card and send it to your mother and you know you can design it custom made however you want it all right so let's just look at the demonstration again of this project so i click open the letter and then we have the flowers following and your special message so that's all for today hope you liked the video don't
