hello everybody and welcome back to our channel here we share beginner friendly coding tutorials on scratch minecraft roblox web programming and many more today we're going to create an obstacle course in minecraft using redstone this is a twopart video in this first part of the obstacle course we'll be looking at the unwelcoming wall and the wall running obstacles and in this process we'll learn how to do a redstone circuit so let's get started so we're going to start by creating a creative world in minecraft so to start with we click on single player and since i don't have a world created um he has told me to make a new world here i'm going to change the game mode into creative change of difficulty to peaceful so there's no mobs that can attack us and lastly i'm gonna go into more world options change the world type into super flat and then i'm gonna create my world and once the word has generated we can start doing so as you can see our world is just flat and we're also in creative world so if i press e or my inventory i have access to all blocks and i can also double click on spacebar to fly so for the first obstacle we want to build a red stone circuit in order to act as an internal clock that activates the pistons so i'm gonna pick up a block and uh it doesn't matter what block you pick so i'm just gonna pick stone and i'm gonna go to redstone we'll pick piston a redstone torch the redstone repeater redstone dust and i'm also going to grab the ladder while i'm here so ladder all right so for our obstacle we want to build it three blocks high so we're gonna have one two three and then build two more blocks above that like this and then i can remove the three blocks underneath like so so i have two blocks that are three blocks above and i'm gonna build two block across and one block down so you look like this and in the middle i'm gonna put a sticky piston or just a normal piston it's up to you right here and now for me after that i'm gonna build a platform uh beneath and behind the piston so i'm gonna build three blocks here platform like this and i'm gonna build a three by two platform like so and to do the red stone circuit um i'll just show it on the floor here and see how it works so we start by placing a block and the block is going to hold the rest on torch the redstone torch is going to supply power to whatever redstone tools is connected to it so the first thing we're connecting is a restroom repeater and as you can see is lit up that means it is powered by the restroom torch then i'm going to have redstone dust run across like this and i'm going to use another repeater and i'm going to aim it at the block so now you see we have an internal clock going and this is going to be what we build over here to make the piston extend itself periodically and pretty much how this works is that the wrestling torch is powering this repeater this repeater is powering this repeater which is powering on this block and whenever a block is powered it actually turns off the redstone torch so the restaurant torch turns off which turns off this repeater which turns off this repeater which turn off the power in this block turning this clock or turning this torch back on and i just keeps repeating so over here we'll fly over here and we're going to put the same thing as what we have over here so let's start at this platform at the very edge to the right i'm gonna put down a block then i'm gonna put a restaurant torch just like how we have it there a repeater going out restaurant dust going across and finally a repeater going back into the block so here we can see we have the redstone circuits going and the final step is to put a restaurant dust connecting it to the pistons so now you can see the power to the pistons on and off and on this side you can see the piston going on you know pushing it off and on extending itself periodically and the final step for our obstacle course is to build a platform that the user has to walk across so here i'm gonna build a platform and to get up to this platform i'm gonna build here a three block high ladder like so so we can go up and uh yep if you see that i wasn't careful and i was pushed off by the pistons if you have enjoyed this video be sure to subscribe to our channel and also like our video so far so moving on to the second uh second obstacle we can actually put it to the left of here as the second level kind of and what we're going to do is pick up the glass blocks and these will be placeholders for us and what i'm going to do is i'm going to build what i'm going to do is build the glass blocks um six blocks high so here we have one two three four five six and then here's gonna be my actual wall that i'm gonna have the user climb so here you can make any shape you want with the actual blocks and here i'm gonna make some kind of weird not even shape maybe like so and what we're going to do is put the ladders on the very bottom layer of each one so i'm going to go like this and you can also add a layer on this side like this and you can layer your ladders however way you want to make it easier or harder for the user to climb but um this will conclude our second obstacle and so we can just build a platform like maybe because we start over here we can build a platform like so so that the user can start from here and they have to make their way across and here i'm going to add a platform in which the user has successfully won the game so here i'm up there with the platform right next to the endpoints like this and yeah these are two obstacles for our first half of the video so that's all for today i hope you guys enjoyed don't forget to subscribe and like our videos also check out our other two videos while you're here thank you bye
