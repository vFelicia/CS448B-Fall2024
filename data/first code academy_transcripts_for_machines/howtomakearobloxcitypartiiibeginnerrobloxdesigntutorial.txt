hi guys welcome back to first code academy and today we'll continue on our series on how to build a city in roblox in today's video we'll take a look at how to build roads how to set them up in the city and how to design strategically how to build our roads first to place our buildings in a later stage i hope you like this video remember to like and subscribe so for today's chapter i made a couple of changes uh not very major well the first the only change substantial i have made since live chapter was i extended the base plate because i want to play around with some of the road elements we can include into a roblox project the reason i did this is because i don't want to interfere in the main city so what i did was just go into the base plate over here and change the size i kept the height the same 20 but i changed the dimensions to 2 000 and 2 000 this is not permanent of course and remember in the end i will get rid of the base plate but for now i'm just going to leave it like that because i want to place the temporary elements there and play around with the road placements first to then show you what it's going to look like in the end now before i do anything else i will do to do something so i don't get confused in the future it's good practice that if you are going to make a new project and you want certain parts of the world to be unique or to differentiate them from the other parts to rename them so you can click again on the name here and i'm going to change this one to the not really a base plate again but i'm going to rename it as just base right uh this is so in the future when i get rid of the base plate i can extend this make it thicker so it looks more like an actual base element of the floor you know uh another good reason to do this to make it thicker it's something called clipping and in video games clipping means when your character moves at a certain speed or in certain angles so that the program fails to calculate in its next position and imagine here is a wall and here's your character and sometimes you gain certain speed at a certain angle and then the game calculates as if it passed through the wall without like hitting the wall exactly in the matter of fraction of a second it is this is pretty rare but it might happen and it will lead to some like weird behaviors in your game so usually you want them to be thick enough so that no matter if it goes like really fast the next position will be inside the wall and the game will know to push it back and not let it go through now with that out of the way i'm going to start by going to the pack texture packs right and you see if you type in road there's many individual elements and those are fine these are great but i prefer packs okay there's two i will recommend and i'll play around and see the difference between both of them first one is a road pack so i'll go straight up here and this road pack is probably one of the most popular ones uh it's main characteristics are that it includes multiple sections of straight roads right some of these roads include like a middle part with the park some other just like a straight line and you can see that it divides it into a grid of four by four so if you hover your mouse like in the select option over many of these you will see that it's four across and four above when you paste them into the world each one will have its own individual name and so you can see that they all priority priority of threeway fourway intersections these are intersections that are these are these four intersections these four straight rows these are straight rows with park and these are curves and other type of intersection now what's the mean difference well these two i consider them are pretty much the same just road road oh yeah the main difference between these two this one is has a driveway so if you want to put a house in here this is a good spot to park the car and the intersections are basically just very well described this is four ways of four cars like cars can go from front four directions and here they can go from three directions in case you want to intersect the road only at one spot these two their main difference is just uh fourway stop and threeway stops instead of using headlights it uses the stop signs same as here so fourway threeway priority the priority one means that the road that has the yellow stripes it's tends to be bigger than the road that comes from the other intersections so one of the roads has priority of way so grow cars that come from the yellow lines will usually well in the real world drive first and the other ones will stop to see if nobody else is coming right the advantage of road packs is for example you can leave it outside of your main world and to manipulate it and you can always use the duplicate function so i can duplicate here and it will create a new copy which i can select and move and the advantage of using road packs is that i can leave them all here and go ahead and put them in my real world without any problems so i can choose and match which ones i want to use maybe i want to use this one so i put it up here and i make it fitting over the other one now a couple of observations is you might want to make them fit in exactly but there is not much of a tr problem as long as you keep it consistent that's why i told you to leave some space between the park and the buildings if i take a look here i calculated around how much space i needed to leave and it's pretty much the same of course you can always rotate it you don't have to make it stay in the same fixed line and you can even make it in the diagonal so that's the problem if you want a more specific angle like than this eight uh it's a gets a little bit more complex it still can be done if you notice each one of these elements it's something we call a modal right a modal is basically a collection of parts that move all together and behave as one single object now if you click on the little arrow next to the modal you can still see that the model is made of different parts and each one of these parts can be modified individually right so for example if i want the lines in the middle to not be yellow anymore you see that this one of these road markings says bright yellow i can change it to white for example i can go with the other one and change it to white again so you say fundamentally change the middle of the line to be yellow this is one of the packages the advantages of this one that i found is that it is pretty simple makes you a very great and unique city however it doesn't have many structures you can pull out roads from that's why even the same road category i found another one which i prefer crafts road pack but i prefer to use road pack two which is version two you see that's significantly bigger but it includes more features and has a different aesthetic so this one it makes my history go a little bit slower because it's a lot of process at the beginning it has the same rules the same like yellow lines in the middle it's it adds some different elements like a little round ending of the road block endings this one which is usually used for several areas of the city parking lots this type of parking lot this type of parking lot over here with a little wall in the edges two bridges and more green sections you can definitely use this one as a base for the city or you can go ahead if you open the road pack you'll find the same division and since it has more of these divisions it's significantly bigger than the traditional road pack that i found over there um you'll have to rotate through all of this to find the one you like but the idea is the same once you found one once you find one that you like oh it's cool the side sorry the name of this one is cool design long straight road medium band bridge bridge two anyone you like you can still duplicate it and i'll grab this bridge too i'll use move tool move tool sorry i click the wrong one and i can bring it down here now this one is actually a little bit bigger now there's one thing you'll notice is that because this one is still inside of the root pack you won't be able to move it freely but you can fix it by dragging it from here in this section of the explorer and drag it just below any of this we'll try not to make it inside another one try to make it inside workspace okay and it will sort it alphabetically again and now since it's no longer part of the package because you duplicate it and you put it outside you can even move it with the select tool and it doesn't change a lot i believe the rows of this one are a little bit bigger than the other one so it's basically up to up to you try not to scale it a lot uh one recommendation i have personally because when you scale it roads stop fitting in with each other as good as you would like them to be and that's just because scaling is not really a precise operation to do so when you scale a road you might find that they don't no longer fit with the other ones you've previously scaled it takes some trial and error to see what's the correct scaling for your roads so you got to be careful with that part as well you see here i can make the bridge fit in here or i can put it down here i can rotate it as well just put this here i only need the green rotator because my city is going to be like in square fashion so i'm going to put this one here i'm going to put some roads like then again i can go here to the crops road pack and drive a straight road over here i can pull it out of the of the crab pack take some time put it in as a part of bridge too but then i'll put it as a part of the workspace now that i have it as part of the workspace i can select it here straight road and just move it outside and there you go that's how you pull the road and once you have it outside you can just keep duplicating this one and keep duplicating the other ones once you're done with the rows you want to place it's pretty easy crop road pack you just delete it and i'm gonna delete the other ones as well because i don't really need them so you can grab they're very recognizable because they're the ones with the specific names of roads now two advantages i found with the crab road pack is that it comes already the models come inside of another model so it's easier to recognize which one belongs to your program which ones doesn't so at the end it's easier to delete and leave them out of your main program you don't need it after you place the entirety of the roads of your city another advantage is that it has more variety and even has a little bit of grass on the on the edges so it looks more nature like of course you can pick from many different road packs but i recommend using road packs for your cities as they already fit in with each other perfectly you can pick them based on the size and you can pick them based on what style of roads you like for the next part i'm going to finish the roads okay i'm going to have the roads finished and we're going to test some vehicles out inside and some recommendations of which vehicles are good to have in a city i hope you enjoyed this project and that's it for today thanks for watching don't remember to hit like and subscribe and i will see you on the next chapter goodbye
