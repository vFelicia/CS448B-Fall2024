hello everyone welcome back to our channel here we share beginner friendly coding tutorials on scratch minecraft roblox web programming and many more today we are going to take a look at part 5 of our advanced rpg in this tutorial you will learn on how to make disappearing platforms and also how to make checkpoints in an easy way so let's get started right so i have opened up my roblox part with all the previous obstacles that we have made so far so the first obstacle i'll be creating in this video would be the disappearing platforms so disappearing platforms is a type of obstacles which you can find in most of games so first we are going to design the obstacle course so in this one not all parts are going to disappear kind of flashing so only few selected platforms would be flashing so that you'll have some time in order to wait till the platform is shown which you can jump on and then pass through it and jump on to the next platform so i'm going to place my platforms in this exact pattern so i'm going to click on pod get a block and use scale and i'm going to make sure that they're anchored alright so now i have designed my platform so next i'm going to select some of these platforms and rename them into be flashing so that i know that these platforms are the flashing all the disappearing platforms so i'm going to click on this one and go to wave and find explorer so i do have a bunch of parts so i'm going to rename this part is flashing so i'm going to repeat view so next i'm going to write a script to make them flash so i'm going to click on one part or flashing font and i'm going to add a script into it so i need to run or make them flash like show hide show hide while the game is running so i'm going to add a wall so while the condition is going to be true so while the game is running i'm going to make the transparency zero so if the transparency is zero so that means you can actually see your platform or the platform is visible next i'm going to add in a property which is called can't collide so i'm going to set that to be true so that when the platform is visible the player can actually jump onto the platform so script dot parent dot can collide equal to true so then i'm going to add a weight command or weight method so i'll show the platform for around two seconds and then make it disappear so two and then to make it disappear i'm going to write script parent the transparency is equal to be one so that it's totally invisible and i need to make sure that all the is invisible like sometimes the player if i didn't set my can collide property to be fall even if the part is not shown on the screen you can still stand on there so i need to make sure that the player falls through once the platform disappears it would be like oh it's magical although the platform is disappeared you can still stand on on a invisible platform so i'm going to make it karen calculi sorry can't collide to be false and then i'm going to add in a weight block and write two seconds so these platforms or these flashing platforms are going to be shown only for two seconds and they'll be hidden for two seconds so if you need to make them hidden for a longer time you can increase this weight loss so the wait time can be around four seconds so they're being invisible for a longer period but they're visible only for a shorter period so i have given two weight blocks now it's the same script for all flashing platforms so what i'm going to do is i'm going to copy the script and then find all the flashing parts so i'm going to paste into the parts that are renamed as flashing so paste into paste into all right so once i play it so you can always test it out and see if it is recording like the wait time is according to your liking if not you can always change it so here i can see my parts and i don't see them so i just need to quickly run and go get on to a safer platform again i don't have my platforms here i need to wait and then to run quickly and jump then again i need to wait oh see i didn't react quickly so i didn't run past in order to get into the safe or the nonflashing platform i just fell down luckily i had a bass play but in the end we're going to delete this bass play alright so it works now right lastly i'm going to add my final spawn point so i'll just paste it and put it down here all right so the final instructions i'll be giving in this video would be on how to make spawn points for working sponsors so there are two ways one is that you can actually code using lua and make your checkpoints to work but there's another way that we can use which is simple and easy we're just going to be using teams all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to go to my spawn point starts from here and i'm going to rename all the spawn points in an order so this is going to be spawn point so i'm going to rename it as stage 0. and i'm going to rename this as h1 i'm going to keep renaming them so you can um rename it any way that you like you can write stage 1 s0 0 2.1 2.2 all right so i have renamed my stages in an order so starting from stage 0 which is at the beginning and the end is going to be stage nine now i'm going to add in the team service so to find teams you can click on moral tab on the roblox studio and you'll see on the right corner you'll see a tab called service if you cannot find this you can just find a tool which has two gears i'm going to click on that and i'm going to add the team service and click on down all right so at the bottom i do have the teams option for the service all right so next i'm going to click on stage 1 and i'm going to change some properties so on the stage 0 which is the beginning i'm going to the properties of it and and i'm going to make sure that the neutral is unticked all right and then i'm going to add a team color so each checkpoint would have its own theme color so i'm going to make it to be red so in order for you to not to get confused of like what is which team color which is which so you can always change the color of your platform also so you can change the theme brick color really so changing the brick color to match with your team color would make things easier for you if not you can always just change the team color only all right so next i'm going to stage one which is the next stage here so i'm going to change the properties so i'm going to untick the neutral so make sure that all the checkpoints have the neutral property to be unticked but except stage 0 all other checkpoints should have the unlocking change property to be ticked so in c0 is unticked but in stage one stick so i'm going to give a different theme color so it's going to be lime green so i'm going to change the color also going to be like gray all right so i'm going to repeat the same thing so stage one so i'm gonna just go to the next stage so again change the properties click on allow team change and untick the neutral change the theme color and then match them i'm going to repeat the same thing for all other stages all right now head to the team folder down here and then we're going to add teams inside this so in total i have eight two points of eight points so i'm going to add eight teams so i'm going to click on the plus sign and add one team all right so now i'm going to rename this part exactly the way that i have renamed these spawn points so starting from stage 0 all the way to stage 8. so i'm going to rename so i'll do it one by one so i'm going to do the first checkpoint which is stage 0. so i'll rename this to be stage 0 and i'm going to change some properties of this thing so now if i take a look at the properties of stage 0 the team color is really red so i'm going to click on stage 0 and change the team color to match with the theme call that i have assigned for my spawn points so stage 0 is going to be y so stage 0 is going to be really red ok so the next theme would be stage one so for stage one the team color i have assigned is lime green so for stage one i'm going to make sure the lime green the theme color is lamb green and starting from stage one i'm going to make sure that the auto assignable property is going to be unticked so that when you fall down they don't get randomly assigned to another spawn point but stage one should be utter asana because it's the first spawn point so i'm going to keep on repeating so stage 2. all right and finally i'm going to delete the base plate there you go and now we can see how the checkpoints are being updated so head to play all right so here i can see all the stages shown on my screen so right now i'm on stage one so i'll just jump now i'm stage two and then not if i respawn so let's see if i jump down just for testing right now i'm stage one i have passed h1 so let's see okay so i'll get spawn to my last known checkpoint which is stage one so that's all for today i hope you like this project don't forget to subscribe to
