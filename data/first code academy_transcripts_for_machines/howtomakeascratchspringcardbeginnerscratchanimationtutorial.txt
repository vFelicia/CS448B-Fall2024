hello everybody and welcome back to our channel here we share beginner friendly coding tutorials on scratch roblox minecraft web programming and many more today we're going to do a scratch animation called spring cards so here's a preview on how the animation will look so when we press the green flag there's a bear bear walk across the slope says i am so cold when will spring come an envelope appears from the sky and when we click on the envelope we say hello spring okay so let's get started so we're going to start by creating a new project on scratch you can find scratch on scratch.mit.edu so here i'm gonna click on create i'm gonna rename my project to spring cards and i'm also to delete sprite one so the first thing we're going to do is set up our backdrop so if you go to the bottom right and click choose a backdrop we want to find something that are a little bit snowy you can upload your own picture but i'm going to go down here and i'm going to find the one that says slopes and select it now i have to upload four more backdrops to create the animation of the envelope falling from the sky so to do this you can use the link in the description below to download the four backdrops but here you can click on choose the backdrop go up until you get to upload backdrop and i have saved the four files here so i'll select the four click open and now the four backdrops has been uh added to my backdrops so if i go back to code okay now we should add our sprite we need three sprites here so the first initial two uh two sprites is gonna be from uh scratch first one we should pick up the bear walking so just click on bear walking now we should find the one that says butterfly so let's choose a sprite go down to butterfly two and now we need three more sprites two of them is selfmade and one is going to be uploaded so let's upload our sprite so click on sprite upload sprite and here i'm going to use the envelope sprite the two remaining sprites that we're going to add are text so we can actually draw them ourselves so to do that we go to add the sprite scroll up until we get to paint and now we can rename and pretty much make our new sprite by however we want so here we want to click on text we can change the text to whatever color and we should change the name to hello now i'm gonna click on the screen and type in hello click anywhere else to uh be done and now i can actually drag this box wider to make the text bigger and i'm gonna centralize the word hello just like that and i'll make another sprite using paint and here i'm gonna use a text swell and i'm gonna write spring change your custom name to spring increase the size of spring and centralize it and that's it for our sprites and our backdrops so the first thing we're going to code is the backdrop so let's go back to code and let's over here at the stage click on backdrop so now the first thing we want to do is when a green flag is clicked we want to turn the backdrop into our slopes so here let's go to events when green flag is clicked and then we're going to go to looks switch backdrop and we're going to switch backdrop to slopes if you like this video so far don't forget to subscribe to our channel and like our videos so let's continue our project with uh coding a bear so initially when the green flag is clicked on we want to teleport our bear to the left side and have it walk to the middle so to do that first let's have an events listener for when that green flag is clicked now we want to show the bear so we're going to go on looks move to show and we're going to use motion to teleport the bear to the ideal location so here i'm going to say go to x and for x i'm going to use negative 240 and for the y i'm going to use negative 109 afterward i'm going to have it wait one second so if you go to control wait one second and then i'm gonna broadcast a message so here i'm gonna go to events broadcast and instead of broadcasting message one i'm gonna make my own message so if i click on that little upside down triangle a new message i'm going to change the new message name to move okay and now we'll broadcast move and finally i want to move the bear to the middle so here i'm going to use motion glide for one second to x and y and here i'm going to change the time to three seconds to slow the pair down and here for my xaxis i'm going to use 24 and the y will remain at negative 109. so now after the bear has shifted we want to use the actual animation that is walking and to do that we'll be flipping through his customs so so you can see as customs we have a lot of different uh different customs that are animation for the bears movement so to do that we can say event when i received and here is already at move and if it isn't so you can click on the upside down arrow and select move here we're gonna say repeat 10 times in each iteration we want to use next custom and between each animation we want to wait 0.25 seconds after he has finished moving we want to have to bear say i am so cold when will spring come so to do this we go to lux say hello for two seconds change the text to i am so cold exclamation mark and add in another text and here we're going to say when will spring come question mark and now after we have say these two things we can broadcast um and next we'll tell the envelope to drop so here we're going to come to events broadcast again instead of broadcasting move you're going to make a new message so click on the upside down triangle new message type in next we're not done with the bear yet but we can use what we have so far to build our other sprites so let's go to envelope so we know that the bear will broadcast message move and that is our cue to drop the envelope so here we're gonna have when green flag is clicked that is the initial stage we want to teleport our envelope to the top of the map and hide it and when it received a broadcast move it waits for the bear to finish moving and then it drops down to the air so here we're going to say looks hide and we're going to teleport it to the default location which in our case will be x of 131 and y of 180 and now we should have an events listener for the broadcast of move so here we can go to event when i receive and again we already have moved but if it isn't we can just simply select move here we're gonna say wait six seconds and after waiting six seconds it's gonna show itself so go back to looks show we're gonna glide it down to do that so we use glide we're gonna glass for one second and we're gonna use the same x as 131 and for the y i'm going to use negative 126 and then i'm gonna wait two more seconds so control weights two seconds and then i'm gonna have messenger says click me so i'm gonna have say for two seconds inside say i'm gonna say click me and the final part for the envelope is that we want the ability to click on the envelope and it finishes the animation so here we want to say event when this sprite is clicked what we want to say is broadcast opened so that we can have the an animation at the end so here we're going to say broadcast new broadcast a new message and the message name will be open and when we press the envelope and the broadcast open we want to hide the envelope and only show the sprite that will be needed for the actual animation so here we can say when i receive i'm gonna scroll down to word open and the only thing we're gonna do just hide the sprite so we can simply put hide and this will complete our code for the envelopes right so if you go back to bear walking here after broadcasting next what we want to do is have the bear also say an envelope so here we're gonna have control we're gonna wait for 0.5 seconds and then we're going to have it say something so go to looks say and here we're going to have to say an n elope and we're gonna have it say it for a second and similarly to our envelope sprites when the broadcast of open is um broadcasted we want to hide the sprite of the bear since it is not in our final animation so here we have event right now receive change move to open and uh just like the envelope we'll simply be hiding it so just hide and this now has uh will be completed for our bear uh coding so now let's program our sprites for the final animation scene so we started with with the hello sprite so if you go in the hello sprite first we want to set the default location and then hide it so here we're going to have events when the green flag is clicked on first thing first we want to hide it so here we're going to use looks hide and then we're going to teleport it to the default location so we're going to say go to x and y and for the x here i'm going to use negative 240. and for the y i'm gonna use 129. so now when the envelope is clicked we know the open broadcast is broadcasted so we're gonna have to listen for that so here we're gonna have when i receive i'm gonna change from move to open and when the open is broadcasted that means we have clicked on the envelope and the final animation will be played so here we're gonna show ourselves so say show and in this default location we're actually a little bit off the screen to the left here so we're gonna glide it back to have an animation of hello just kind of coming off the screen and back into our animation so what we're going to do is go to motion glide and here we're going to glide it to x of negative 138 and the y remains the same as 129 and that will be our hello sprite for the spring sprites we'll be doing something similar so let's go to spring and here we want to set up the default location and turn it to not show itself in the beginning so here we have events when green flag is clicked we go to lux go down to hide go to motion go to go to x and y to set up our default locations and for the sprite uh spring we want to use x of 108 and then y of negative 180 and once again when they're broadcasted we want to do the animation so here we're going to have events when i receive change move to open and we're going to show the spring sprites so show and once again on the default location is a little bit off the screen in this case it's a little bit off to the bottom so we want to bring it up so now we're going to use glide so we're going to put in glide for x i'm going to use the same number so 108 and for the y i'm going to use 99 so it will come down from the bottom of the screen to up to the middle and that will conclude our spring sprites let's move on to our final sprites which is the butterfly so let's click on butterfly 2. again similar to our hello spray and spring spray we want to set its default location when the green flag is pressed hide itself and it will wait until the open broadcast it will show itself and teleport to the well glide to the middle and when the open broadcast is broadcasted it will glide through the screen and change his animation of flying so here we're going to use events when green flag is clicked we're going to go to looks we're going to use hide and again we're going to set up this default location so let's use go to x and go to y for this we only use negative 200 for x and positive 100 for y and once again it is listening for the open broadcast so we're going to say when i receive click on the upside down triangle click on open here we're going to show and then once again we're gonna glide so here we're gonna use glide i'm gonna actually say three seconds and here we want the glide to a kind of a random location to our screen so to find a random location we can use operators pick random so we can use pick random to actually have it randomized so here we have the range of negative 200 to 200 for x and this similar thing for y here we're going to have negative 180 to positive 180 and now we want to do the animation so here we're going to go on to control forever go to lux we're gonna say next custom and in between each changes we want to wait 0.5 seconds and that will conclude our sprites coding but before we finish we also have to program our backdrop so that it matches and it also hears the uh open broadcast so let's go back to backdrop so now we're gonna add in a new event when i receive and here we're gonna use again open when the backdrop has received open it will play the four different backdrop animations so here we're going to use repeat i'm going to say repeat four times since there are four backdrops and then we're going to drag in the next backdrop into our repeat and we're going to have it wait 0.25 seconds every time we switch it and then finally we'll broadcast the message so here we're gonna go down here and we're gonna make a final thing called message and that will complete our whole project so let's take a look at what our animation has uh has looked like so if you're gonna click on the green flag our bear walks across it says i am so cold where will spring come and the envelope drops and here we click on the envelope and the animation arrives and here we can change the size of the envelope and bear a little bit since it's a little bit big so here i'm gonna go back stop the animation change the size of the bear to 40 and actually change anime size of the envelope to 20. let's play this again i am so cold when was spring come envelope drops from the sky it says click me once this is clicked we have opened the envelope with the animation hello spring so that is all for today i hope you guys enjoyed don't forget to subscribe to our channel and like our other videos be sure to
