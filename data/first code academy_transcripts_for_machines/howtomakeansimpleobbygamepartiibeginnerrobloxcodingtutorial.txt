hello everybody and welcome back to our channel here we share beginner friendly coding tutorials on scratch roblox minecraft web programming and many more today we're gonna take a look at the part two of the roblox game called easy hobby game for this project i'll code the project in roblox studio using lua lua is a popular scripting and programming language its lightweight and easy to use nature means that it's embedded into very popular games games like world of warcraft and roblox is coated inside of lua so now in this tutorial i'll teach you how to use lua to program so that the cylinders will move and change color in a special two second delay yep let's get started in the first part of this project we finished the design of the game here for the part two we'll be coding our game so that our cylinder will move randomly and change color to do this we first renamed all the cylinders to moving cylinder so as you can see we have six cylinders here and we have six cylinders here each one corresponds to um one cylinder and i have also renamed them to cylinder zero or just cylinder cylinder 2 cylinder 3 cylinder 4 cylinder 5 and cylinder 6. so that we can distinguish them from each other so now the first step we can actually move to our first moving cylinder and what we're going to do is under explore once we selected um workplace move down to our moving cylinder i can go over here to this plus sign press it and then add a script and this will open up a script file for us and this script will be a run against our moving cylinder so let's remove the first message they have and here i'm going to start by writing a while loop and i'm going to say while true do and um yep the end has automatically been filled up for us so while true so this is always going to be true we're going to be work uh moving the cylinder inside of this while loop and since this while loop is forever the cylinders will keep moving forever next let's do the script for us to move the cylinder so here i'm going to write script dot parent dot position and this is the position that our cylinder will be and now we're gonna set it to a new position and um the position we're gonna set it to is the current location it is at plus five or you know however more blocks you want to the left or to the right um so here we're going to use script dot parent dot position so grabbing the current position that it is currently x and i'm going to add a new factor and a factor 3 is how we can program a coordinate in lua so here i'm going to have a vector 3. and i'm gonna make a new vector and to do that we do dot new this will create a new vector for us and here the first value will be the x followed by y followed by z so we want to change the x value so we should change the first value and i'm going to add 10 to the x so now we will shift plus 10 in the x position and for the y i'll have it zero and z i'll have it zero so the only place that's changing is the x position and that will be off for the first line so essentially what we did in this line is that we have set the position of the cylinder to its own position plus 10 on the x axis so it will be the same position that it originally was but the x value would have plus 10 so um whatever location it has it will shift 10 uh points to the xaxis and now we want to reset this and um between resets we want to wait two seconds so that you know the user can have a chance between um you know when this block is moving and when it's stationary so we can say wait two this will wait two seconds and now let's set it back to where it originally was and to do that once again we are changing the location of the cylinder so we can do script.parents.o dot position and now we can set it again using the similar syntax we will be setting it to the current location so script.parents. plus a new vector um again we're going to be using a factor three so that we can have um x y and z coordinates and we're gonna have a new one and this time we're gonna do minus ten zero and zero so now um after we have changed the location so that the x value is plus ten we wait two seconds and change it back to originally uh where it was by subtracting ten from the xaxis and now we're going to say weight 2 again and now if this is all we have in our wire loop what will happen is that our cylinder will move 10 units to the x value wait two seconds and then go back to where it originally was wait two seconds and repeat um this step now let's learn how to color the cylinder to a random color at each time and to do this we first have to make sure that we have the naming convention correct so here as you can see my moving cylinder has six unique numbers so the first one has no number second one is associated with moving cylinder two three four five six and the point is to make it so that none of the cylinders have the same name so that we can refer to each one individually so now what we want to do is above this while loop i'm going to add one line of code and we're going to basically have a variable that stores our moving cylinder so we can change its color so we can save this as a local variable since we're only using this in this file we can set local and we can name this variable moving cylinder now i want to set it to the actual object of this moving cylinder so i'm going to set it equals to gain dot workspace dot moving cylinder and you can see there's six moving cylinders corresponding to these six moving cylinders and for this file i'll be using the moving cylinder as my um object that i'm changing now before we change the position let's change the color to that we can use brick color dot random brick color represents the property for the block color so to change the block color we can first access our moving cylinder and we can access the dot brick color so here we can say move cylinder dot brick color and this is the property that contains what color this moving cylinder is going to be so now we can set it to brick color dot random like this and now just return a random color from the possible brick colors we can pick from and set it to our moving cylinders color and we can copy and paste this and right before our second move back so that it will change color at each step like so so now with that we have the base coat finish we can actually expand on what is inside of our wire loop so let's copy and paste what we already have with the six lines of code and let's paste this two times and what i'm going to do is i'm going to keep um the weight and the move cylinder dot break color the same but at each position i'm going to change the position for the xaxis and it's important that we don't touch the y and z so here we can make this negative five and five here i can make it 15 and negative 15 and so you can really just make it any number it's good to keep it around 5 10 15 to 20. um but what's important is that we should have two um script position where one is going to be a positive and one is going to be negative so that it cancels out so here it moves 10 and the gum is back negative 10 it goes from negative five and it comes back to five so whatever we do we move it back to the original position and um yeah so this is the um whole code for our moving cylinder so to make something similar for moving cylinder two three four and five and six we can simply copy and paste this code and modify it slightly so that it will work for all different ones so here i can copy and paste this and now i'm going to do the same thing go to moving cylinder 2 go to plus and add a script and here i'm going to delete this line and paste what we have in our script for moving cylinder and the only thing we have to change here is up here in the local variable we're going to change game.workshop.movingcylinder to game.workshop.commovingcylinder2 so we're gonna correspond it with the name we have uh gave it up here and um that'll be the only change we have to do so now we can copy and paste this again go to moving cylinder three add a script paste this in change the local variable name to moving cylinder 3 save this and then moving cylinder 4 that would be the same thing change this to moving cylinder four and again from moving cylinder five i'll do the same thing copying paste and change name to moving cylinder five and last but not least we do the same thing for our moving cylinder 6 copy and paste and change it to 6. and yeah so now we have the code for changing colors and changing the position and we can actually run our game and see it in action so let's go to our game let's go to file and save our project so save file so now we can play the game and uh do that by clicking play and now if you look at the cylinders not only are they changing position they're shifting and it's changing color as well so you can see that there's six cylinders and they're all moving um after a delay of two seconds and changing color so that's all for today i hope you guys
