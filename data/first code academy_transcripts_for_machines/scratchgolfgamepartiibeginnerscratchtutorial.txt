hello everyone welcome back to our channel here with your beginner friendly coding tutorials on scratch roblox minecraft web programming and many more today we are going to finish our mini golf game we started to code in scratch in the last video for the second part of the project we'll divide the functions we're adding by how essential they are to the game so we'll start by defining what to do when the ball enters the hole but first we'll add another circle inside of the hole we had from last time so that it's more precise when entering it then when the ball touches the color of the little circle will will code to handle scoring on one hole so let's get started so right now i have my scratch project open i'm gonna go to the whole sprite and then in costumes i'm gonna add another hole inside so here i'm going to make the little one the little hole here red okay i'll adjust it a little so here we have it okay and then next what we want to do is we need to add the detection block just below where we detect if it touches one of the borders of the field then if the speed is low enough the ball can go into the hole so we set the speed to a negative value so it gets out of the loop all right so i'm going to go back to my ball sprite and then right in this detection block i'm going to duplicate it and add another if oh sorry i mean we need to move it right here all right so if touching the color red now i need to use the color dropper again and grab the color red okay so it's touching the color red and we also want to see if the speed is low enough so get another um condition if okay so we need to go to operators get the smaller then sine so if the speed look at speed is smaller than 5 then we are going to set the speed to negative so it gets out of the loop okay so variables set speed to negative 0.1 all right now in addition to what we just did so we want to also broadcast a message so we level up to the next level so we're going to go to event and we're going to choose broadcast message we'll put it right here and in message i'm going to say um next level and then ok all right so this message will be received by everyone so we'll add code in the stage so it changes to the next backdrop so that's the second level and after that code we'll need to design the actual next backdrop so the actual level two so let me go ahead to the backdrop and say when i receive next level i'm going to switch to the next backdrop and then we're going to go ahead and design it okay i'm in the backdrops part now what i'm going to do is i'm going to duplicate my first backdrop green and have it as backdrop 2. of course i want to delete this rectangle i have earlier and set up a complete new one since this is level 2 we're going to make it a little bit harder so i'm going to add a water trap and also a grass trap so when the ball hits either one of these items it's going to have to go back to the starting point all right so i'm going to go ahead and do that right now my um second background stage all right a level two stage now what i'm going to do is going to add the traps that i talked about earlier so the water trap and the grass trap i'm going to start with the water traps i'm going to change the color to blue okay all right let's do this blue then add a circle and i think i'm going to add it right here okay let me say no outline as well so this is the water trap and then another thing i want to do is also the grass trap so for the grass trap i'm going to change the color to a slightly different shade of green let's say this neon green and i'm going to place it right here so that's the grass trap either if the ball touches either the water trap or the grass trap then it's going to have to reset its position back to the beginning okay now in the same stage section we'll set up a level variable so that the game knows in which map level you're in right now so we'll add a block to set the level to the initial one and then we can put the switch backdrop to the level variable so it changes automatically we can also add a condition so that if you reach the end of the levels you stop the program all right so let's go to code and to do this we're going to say when i receive the next level we already have it right here when i receive next level we're going to change the level by one because we're in level two so to do that let's make a variable first called level and then we'll say change level by one now i don't want it to show up in the game so i'm going to uncheck it right here so change level by one and then i'm going to say all right if we have reached the end of the levels so right now we have level one and two so i'm going to say the n would be level three right so we'll say if level equals to three okay then we are going to get the stop all block and then we're gonna switch backdrop back to the initial one so we're going to go to looks and switch backdraw to level all right and then we're also going to say when green flag is clicked we want to start from the beginning which is level one so we go to operators and we do set level to one and then also switch the backdrop to one so next thing we're going to do is set up the ball and the hole so that when you end a level they move to their next position so we're going to use the when i receive and a goto block to do this inside of a condition depending on which level level they are so you can tie it up to another message so that the level the value of the level is already changed all right so we'll say when backdrop switches to backdrop two then we are going to set the position of the um hole okay we need to put it in the whole sprite all right so we'll say when backdrop switches to backdrop two then we are going to use the go to block and say go to x 120 and then y minus 90. all right let's try it okay so now we're in our second backdrop so let's go ahead and actually adjust it a little bit let's say i want it right here okay so that is 199 and minus 123 for y okay and then for backdrop one let's have a look as well okay so for backdrop one we want it to be somewhere around here so in code we're going to say when backdrop switches to backdrop one we want to say x is 223 oh sorry that's 233 and y is minus 23. all right let's try that so here i'm going to say okay so the hole holes in the correct position now we need to do the same thing for the ball so for the ball we're going to make sure they start in the beginning right here so for backdrop two let's have a look so say when backdrop switches to backdrop two we'll do go to x is minus 224 y is 111 then let's do backdrop one again so for backdrop one we can make it somewhere around there so i believe we already have this code all right so when green flag click go to minus 175 and zero okay finally we can code the terrain so here we'll change change a little bit so we'll say if you touch the water trap it restarts the level so it goes back to the original position and if you touch the grass then we'll make it um to be you'll move slowly instead so the speed decreases so we're going to add those conditions before we move a certain amount of steps and change the speed so that they handle this before moving the ball and the most important one is when you touch the water you reset the position thus we'll use an if something something else something something blocks the code this sort of behavior all right so now we want to go back to the ball sprite and then add in the condition if something then something else and we grab that out here and then we're going to add in the condition so i can duplicate and then i'll say if touching the color water watercolor then we are going to set the speed so set speed to be negative 0.1 and then we're also going to say all right if you are in level one so another if and then we'll say if level equals to one then what we're going to do is we're going to reset your position so we want to look at our position so that's 175 and zero through this okay minus 17 75 and zero okay so if level equals to one then reset goes there but then if level equals to 2 so then we need to go to control and get another condition okay and then we'll duplicate this and say if level equals to two then we're going to a different part so duplicate this and put this one right here all right now for our else part what we're actually going to do is we're going to move the code we have right here so move speed steps change speed by minus 0.5 all of that we're gonna move it into our else now in the else part of this block we'll add an extra slow down if the ball is touching the grass trap and we're gonna do the color dropping then change the speed by an extra 0.2 so we're going to go first of all move our code back in into our repeat until and then in the else part we're going to add um another one let's say we put it right above here okay so we'll say if touching let's use our color dropper move it back into here okay if touching the color green then we are going to change the speed so change speed by minus 0.2 all right so that's it for the coding of our mini golf scratch tutorial and that's all for today hope you liked the video don't forget to subscribe and like our videos and also check out the other two videos while you're here waiting for the next one alright see you bye
