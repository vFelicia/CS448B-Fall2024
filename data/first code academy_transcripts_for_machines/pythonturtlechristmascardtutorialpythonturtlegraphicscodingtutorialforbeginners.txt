hi everybody my name is fernando and today we're going to do a project on python turtle called christmas card in this project you will be sharing how to use functions and shape drawing in python turtle to create unique christmas card every time you run the project so as we can see right now we're adding the moon and a couple of stars in random positions which will in turn lead to the creation of our own christmas card you can send to your friends let's begin coding our project first of all for any python project we're gonna make we need to import the necessary libraries for it to work the first library we're gonna import is the turtle library because it's very essential to do a turtle project so from turtle import everything this symbol indicates that we're going to port everything that belongs to the turtle library next of all now we're going to import the random library random indicates anything that we cannot predict just to throw the result of throwing dices or the result of flipping a coin we want this so that the stars that we are going to show in our project are not the same stars or the same position every time we do a new card so that it's a unique card every time we do it we don't need to import the entire library we just need to import the rand instruction next we need to define some functions to draw the shapes that we're going to show in our project the first shape we're going to show is a circle the circle is going to be used to draw the moon to do that let's name it draw circle and we need to specify some parameters parameters are the things that functions need in order to work so the parameters for this function are gonna be the turtle we're gonna use the x and y position the color of the moon and how big the moon is gonna be so to name them we're just gonna use some easy names to recognize them turtle for the turtle color for the color x and y for the y position and x position and the radius to indicate the size of the moon the instructions we're going to use to draw the moon are pretty simple first we need to raise the turtle so it doesn't leave a line wherever it moves we ship that using turtle.pennad now we need to change the color of the turtle we use that turtle.color and inside the the color function we've got to specify which color we want to use next we're gonna fill everything that we draw the circle in with the same color we do that by telling the turtle to fill the color using the color we tell it to do in this case it's the same color as the function over here next we're going to move the turtle to our desired position so we just use go to x and y for the x and y positions we need to be next we're going to set the turtle down so you can start drawing turtle that pin down next we're gonna begin filling the the circle that we're gonna draw so the moon locks look solid and not just like a circle with some blue on the back or the color of the sky we want to use so we do that by doing turtle.beginfill next we're going to draw a circle that is going to be the size that we tell the turtle to do we already specified this in the draw circle function so we just do turtle dot circle to draw a circle and the size is gonna be just the radius size the last instruction for this function is just gonna be to tell the turtle to stop filling it everything that is drawing so turtle dot and fill the next function we need to define is a function to draw the stars this function is going to use the same parameters as the draw circle one we're just going to call instead of radius we're going to use the word size now most of the instructions are going to be pretty similar we can copy all of these instructions and paste them here we need we need to do basically the same things raise the turtle change the color change the fill color move to the starting position set the pin down and start filling it in the first instruction we're gonna do that is specific to the star is gonna rotate it to the right about 144 degrees this is just so the star has this specific pattern you know the five points of the star can be set up correctly now because we have a fivepointed star we need to repeat the same thing five times which is moving the turtle and making sure it goes to each one of the corners so to repeat an action we use a loop a loop is an instruction that repeats the actions that are inside of it the desired amount of times we specify it two in this case the easiest function to use or the easiest loop to use is gonna be the for loop for i in range five indicates that we're gonna do the instruction five times we're going to move first the turtle forward so you can do one leg of the star how big we gonna want to move it well we already specified it here in size so we just set it to move forward size pixels then we're going to make it turn to the right the same degrees 144. finally we're going to move it again for the size pixels that we wanted to move it doesn't look like it right now but when all of them move for five times they're gonna end up filling up the triangles that are gonna be formed around this shape we finish the function the same way as we finish the circle function and fill and now we add another function that says set heading 0 this function basically just specifies that we want to stop pointing in a random direction we just want it to point in the specific zero direction which is the default one for python turtle next on the list is we want to start coding the main part of the program so we can draw our christmas card the first thing we need to do is to create our first pen or our first turtle we're just going to call it my pen equals turtle this functions creates a turtle for us just just gonna give it a shape in this case you can just specify it for it to be the turtle shape so it doesn't look just like the triangle it comes by default i'm gonna set the speed this one is pretty much up to you how fast do you want it to look i'm gonna go with 10 so it doesn't look too fast or too slow now we need to create a window for the christmas card to be in window equals turtle dot screen remember the names of the variables are picked by you but it's very a good idea that you make them related to the thing you're doing so you don't confuse people that look at your code without knowing what you're doing now i'm gonna specify the background color for my window you can pick any of the default colors or you can pick a color based on this hexadecimal value if you want to pick a color but you don't know which one is the hexadecimal value of course you don't know with my memory you can always google it up in a color selector probably and you can find many pages three pages that can give you if you pick a color it will give you the value in hexadecimal value okay remember this is written like this exorcism okay now let's start drawing the moon to draw the moon we're gonna first make a white circle well how we do it we already have the function right my pen is the turtle white is the color name and then the positions well we're always gonna make the moon in the same position so you can always adjust this it's up to you okay this is the x position the y position and how big we want the move to be all of these values can be adjusted by you according to your preference now to make the moon being a quarter moon face we're gonna draw another circle using my pen with the same color as we have the sky so it looks like it is part of the sky you know like it disappears so we're gonna make it disappear we're gonna move it a little bit to the left so let's say 100 80 and 50. the more you move it to the left or to the right the more of the moon you're gonna show in the end in this case i'm gonna move it 20 pixels to the left so it leaves like a thin moon behind if you want to make it thinner or thicker you can modify this value of the x value so it changes the shape of the moon you can always play around with it now the number of stars are gonna be random so this is the first instance we're gonna use a random value okay we're gonna pick a random number between section six and twelve of course you can pick the random value yourself now let's begin to make the star it's always going to be the same function we're just going to repeat it a different number of times okay to do this we're gonna use a for loop again just as before for a star in range okay number of stars so for example if we got seven stars as a result of this random operation we're gonna do this loop seven times if we get eight we're gonna do it eight times now for the x and y positions well we're just going to pick a number remember in python turtle the zero comma zero position in the x and y axis is just in the middle so we need in negative value values as well for it to be anywhere in the screen we're going to pick a random integer between a negative number and a positive number we want in this case i'm going to pick minus 180 and 180 so it's confined to a little box the same with what the y value you can always speak different values for example i'm gonna pick a different one here i'm gonna go with a hundred the next thing we're gonna do is the size of the star the size we're also going to do it randomly so you should do it very quickly right now i'm going to pick a size between let's say 10 and 20. anything below 10 is going to look very small anything above 20 it's probably going to cover another start and of course we cannot control it because it's random but we don't want it to be too confusing to look at last of all in the for loop we need to actually draw the star so remember draw star is the function we're going to use my pen is the turtle we're going to use white is the color of the the pen x and y are the positions we got from here and the size is the random size we got in destruction before this one okay with these instructions we are now ready to put as many stars randomly as possible the last thing we're gonna do is gonna put a little christmas message at the bottom so we're gonna erase the pen so we don't make any line that we don't want to make we're going to set the color to any color you want i'm going to go with red even though at the beginning of the video show you with yellow but just to show you how it looks a little bit different at the end i'm gonna move the pen to where i want to show the message i wanted to show it at the bottom so remember y goes up is positive and down is negative so i'm gonna go to negative x position as well so it doesn't go in one of the corners remember the message is gonna be quite long so if you do you need to do it a little bit to the negative side so it looks more centered of course you can play around with these values if you don't like the first result you get so let's do with minus 100 minus 180. this means it's gonna the message is gonna start a little bit to the bottom and a little bit to the left now we need to write a message to write the message use the instruction mypen dot right i'm gonna go with merry christmas now we need to specify a font for a message a font is just the type of well the appearance of the letters you're going to use to write down your message in my case i'm going to use the verdana font now i need to specify the size 24 or you can do 28 if you want a little bit bigger and last last of all i'm gonna use the boltz font bold means letters are going to be thicker in appearance now we need to close the bracket and i need to close the other bracket okay now that i wrote my message i'm gonna hide my turtle so the twirl goes away and i can see my message without having the turtle be just hanging around so my pen dot height turtle now before we demo the project i'm just going to go through common problems you can encounter before running it sometimes python won't recognize turtle the screen so you might want just to use a screen instead another problem might be check the name of your variables okay so for example you might commit a typo like say number of start number stars make sure it's the same same with the functions run in make sure it's written just the same way as i did it do not add any extra spaces or capitalize any word that you haven't capitalized before otherwise python is not going to recognize your program and will not be able to run it last feel free to mix it up change it and do any other shape you want if you want to experiment and try to do a different shape for the stars go ahead if you want to make a six pointed star feel free to do it remember this is all about being creative and doing your own thing this is just the basis of our project and you can always change it up to whatever you want now i'm going to show you the final result for my project as you can see the turtle is moving in random positions and it shows the message in the end if i run it again i'm running it again and now we can see that the stars are in a completely different position from before and i have more stars now see now i have 10 stars i guess so that's all for today i hope you enjoyed the project remember to give us a thumbs up if you like it and don't forget to subscribe to get new tutorials thank you bye
