hello everyone welcome back to our channel here we share beginner friendly coding tutorials on scratch roblox minecraft web programming and many more today we're going to build a cabin in minecraft so in this project we'll be creating a cabin in minecraft the cabin is going to contain some beds some furnaces and maybe a chest to make it very cozy and it's a place that we can call home here we'll have um different blocks to make it look like a real cabin and that will make use of different materials and make sure the cabin looks nice so yeah let's get started so let's begin this project by going to our minecraft and go to single player here we're gonna create a new world and we're gonna name this world to be minecraft cabin next let's change the game mode to creative so we can use items for free as well as free flying and we're going to change the difficulty to peaceful so no mobs can attack us while we're building um additionally i'm gonna change um the world types and more world options and i'm gonna change the world type to super flats so it makes it a lot easier for us to build and we're going to click on create world so after our world has been generated let's click e to open our inventory and i'm going to grab the strip log from our uh inventory so there are two ways to put down this log and depending on how you put it down the texture might be different so the one way you can do it is placing it face up as you can see these um the face of the lock is facing upward or you can also place it to the side where this top of the log is facing to the side and as you can see on the side it looks a little bit different because the textures are placed uh differently so what we're gonna do is actually put down an eight by eight square using the logs and um what i'm gonna do is on the four corners of that uh square i'm gonna have to lock face up while the edges and the walls on the sides is going to be facing the side so here i'm going to put down one block and since we're going to be an eight by eight we should have six block in the middle that are sideways followed by two blocks on each side facing up so here one and then i need six blocks so one two three four five six and then one more block facing up with a total of eight blocks like that and i'm gonna do um the rest of the side so here i have one two three four five six followed by one block up and again one two three four five six followed by one block facing up and then just connect the points here so now we have an 8x8 square next let's go over to the corner blocks and add a four block pillars so here i'm gonna add four more blocks on each corner so one two three four go over to the other corner and put down four blocks and uh to make sure that the blocks are facing up i'm going to be placing it as i'm jumping up so that the blocks are going to be facing upward just like so now let's connect the top of the pillars together using the similar techniques as we did here so here we're gonna have six blocks going across facing the side and we're gonna do that to uh all four sides at the top of the pillars here awesome just like that and uh here we're gonna go over again to the four corners um top and bottom and at the corner blocks there are two sides we're gonna put a block on each side like that and we're gonna do the same thing at the top so each corner should have two blocks sticking out um on the side at the corner blocks like that and we will do this for all four corners so just put down two blocks at each side of um the corner blocks and uh this should be the basic um structure and foundation of our cabin next let's go over to the corner blocks and add a four block pillars so here i'm gonna add four more blocks on each corner so one two three four over to the other corner and put down four blocks and uh to make sure that the blocks are facing up i'm gonna be placing it as i'm jumping up so that the blocks are going to be facing upward just like so now let's connect the top of the pillars together using the similar techniques as we did here so here we're gonna have six blocks going across facing the side and we're gonna do that to uh all four sides at the top of the pillars here awesome just like that and uh here we're gonna go over again to the four corners um top and bottom and next let's go back to our inventory and grab our scratch log here i'm gonna go inside of our foundation and i'm gonna put um five blocks like this on the corner of each side so here one two three four five and they should be the same height as our foundation we made here so in all four corners i'm gonna start by placing five blocks high and then similar to what we did um on the edge we're gonna have uh blocks connecting it to the bottom like this and if we do this for all four sides as well and make sure the logs are facing the direct same direction so um here i'm gonna change that awesome and i'm gonna do the same thing at the top oops and finally i'm going to do the same thing to all four sides in the middle so here we see that there's three blocks and we're gonna get to the middle block and we're gonna go across like this and we'll do this again for all four sides our foundation now should look something like this next let's go over to our inventory again and i'm gonna go to search items and gonna look up glass here we're gonna look for the stained glass panes and here we can grab any color we want um since we're four sides i'm just gonna grab um two different colors and i'm gonna have blue at the top and line for the bottom so here i'm gonna go across this so put down the glass panes at the gaps that we see between the logs and i'll do the same thing on the bottom and again you can choose any colors that you see fit okay and now let's pick a side um any side could be the front door so i'm gonna pick this side right here so we'll begin by skipping a block and mining um this out and since there's a glass here i'm gonna remove this glass as well and just replace it with another log like so and let's go back to our inventory and i'm gonna look up door here i'm gonna grab the oak door and placed it in front of here just like so so now let's focus and do the roof of our cabin we'll begin by adding some ports so here let's go to our inventory we're going to look upstairs and get the quartz stairs and we're now going to look up chords so we can just have q u and that should be the smooth quartz block that we're looking for here now as you can see we have this outer layer of um stripped oak log uh we're gonna place our cord blocks around this border without putting it on the two blocks that we added to the side so here we'll just add of course this and now fill in the middle this will be our roof off our cabin okay and let's look at the sides of our door before you fill this end and um as you can see that there are if you mind that these three blocks um with the spread logs we have um four blocks across from each side we're gonna pick the two sides that are one of them with the uh including the door and the wall across from it and we're gonna mined up the two blocks like this as shown and we're gonna replace it we're gonna go into inventory and look up oak plank and i already have in my inventory and i'm gonna place it down like so and the rest of the area we can feel back with uh quartz so again to repeat that um the side that we have a door and the opposite to it we're gonna mined out two blocks uh right above the sprout logs like so and now we're gonna put five more blocks um on top of these so one two three four five do the same thing here one two three four five and now i'm gonna link them together at the very top and as well on the sides i'm gonna add two more blocks so it goes over by one block like so now we're gonna use our court stairs and uh we're gonna start at the front of the base so here on the sides where we have uh the extra blocks i'm gonna go down and try to put it upside down like that so it's key that we aim at the high upper half of this lock to make this go upside down and on top we're going to put down the stairs like this so we have this upside down stairs like that and this would be the pattern for our roof so here i'm gonna do the same thing but the opposite side and we're gonna bend it in um so only this block will be facing outward all the other ones will be facing inward on the bottom like this like so and i'm gonna keep doing it on this side until i reach the middle which is right here and now i'm gonna go on this side and do the same thing so again i'm gonna look at the upper half of this log to make sure it places um the stairs upside down places there on top of that and then follow the same pattern as we did on the other side we're gonna have the bottom with upside down blocks facing inside that on top of that we have stairs facing upward and um i keep going until we connect um to the middle where we have done on the other side like this and at the very top we have two upwards showing so here i'm gonna put um upside down stairs like so and here you can actually come up with uh whatever design you want you can do something like this or you can even do something like um just two stairs like so um actually this i think looks a little bit cleaner so let's do this and um as you can see we haven't done anything in here so here we can actually do a little bit of um artwork with our stairs as well so if you want you can actually just add a bunch of stairs like this so i'm gonna do inward stairs like that followed by just normal not upside down stairs like this and then maybe stairs like here and then i'll put some stairs here and uh some upside down stairs maybe like this maybe one more search like that okay and do the same thing here awesome and this will be the front and let's also add some stairs at the very front like here just like so and um i'm going to follow this pattern and do the same thing on the back side of this uh the base so here i once again put down upside down stairs followed by stairs facing up again we're going to be following the same pattern on the uh that's this side over there and here again um you don't have to use the same design um in fact i'm just gonna try some other design by placing three blocks like this and then maybe blocks above it like that again you can play around with the stairs and see what kind of shapes you guys can make um so i'm gonna go with this shape over here and then i'm gonna add stairs on the edge just like that so this is the back side of our base this will be the side of our base and this would be the front of our base all right so this is basically the whole structure of our base so let's go inside and uh let's do some interior work so let's open the door and go in here um the first thing i'm gonna do is actually remove the items that i have here and i'm gonna grab a torch and then i'm gonna also grab a bed uh here i'm gonna grab a light blue bed and i'm gonna have torches on the corners and then i'm gonna have a bed and then you know to make it cozy i can also have a crafting bench uh maybe a furnace as well so we can cook so fairness and maybe a bookshelf you know um anything to make it a little bit more cozy i'm gonna put the crafting bench here and the furnace here and let's add a chest as well so that we have a place to store stuff just like this and yeah this looks very cozy and nice so this is the overall structure of the base and our cabin so that's all for today in today's project we learned how to make a cabin in minecraft we learned how to add walls add a roof add a door as well as our framework to our cabinet hope you guys enjoyed don't forget to subscribe to our channel and like our videos also
