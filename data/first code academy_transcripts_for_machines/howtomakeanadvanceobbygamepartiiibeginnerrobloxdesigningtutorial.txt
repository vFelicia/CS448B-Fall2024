hello everyone welcome back to our channel here we sharp beginner friendly coding tutorials on scratch roblox minecraft programming and minimal today we are going to take a look at part 3 of our advanced ob game tutorial in this video i will teach you on how to design three obstacles the first one would be a spinning of the obstacle followed by a laser maze obstacle and finally an obstacle called choose the correct platform so let's get started all right so here i have opened up my previous roblox file in the roblox studio which contains all the obstacles which i have designed previously so i do have my leap of faith and then the lace of platforms and then i have my conveyor belt here and then i have some mini jumping platforms up here all right all right so i'm going to continue from here so the first obstacle i would be creating is called choose the correct platform all right so in this obstacle the player have to create the correct platform or the correct lane out of the three options that is given because two of these lanes are going to be invisible trap in which when the player steps onto them they will fall through so the platforms the individual platforms would be changed um alternatively so they have to be extra careful on choosing the current platform so let's get started with that so once i have created my jumping platforms here i'm going to add a checkpoint so i'm going to toolbox and i'll be adding a spawn location we should also act as a checkpoint so i'm adding a neutral spawn all right and i'm going to anchor it so make sure that it's anchor all right so i'm going to make my three lengths across this base plate so first i'm going to create a tiny base plate that is going to be our base so i'll just add another pawn and stretch it too long using scale like that and make sure that you anchor them all right so now i'm going to draw long lanes so the links would be changed in three session so i'll just add another block so this one is going to be low so i'm going to add one two and then three so i'm going to make it a little bit longer so that it's it's kind of like a folk shape as you can see here so you can make it shorter and have more of the choosing platform obstacles like sessions i'll just make it a little bit longer make a copy of this platform and paste it here so this means that i have finished one session so for now i'm going to change i'm going to select the middle plane as my correct lane oh the line that is not an invisible trap so i'll just change the color a little bit to be green so green is for go all right and then i'm going to rename this part as invisible so renaming helps us to identify parts more easily so i do know that on the workspace if i need if i change my colors back onto the colors i want and then later on i need to check um which one is my invisible part if i have renamed it i can identify them easily okay so i'm going on to the next part and i'm going to rename it to be invisible okay so i'm going to rename this as correct blame you can write this correct part or correct link all right and then i'm going to to make things easier i'm going to copy this name and then so i'm going to switch my correct lane and then add my invisible traps if you do one part and if you copy it it would be easy so that the parts are also getting renamed automatically all right and then i do have some gaps so i'll be fixing that now i'm going to color them so it would be easy if i have three colors that is going to keep on repeating on every session all right so you can see that the platforms are being changed and then i'll just color the bases okay so now i'm going to write the code in lua that makes the invisible platform to not to collide with the player when they step onto them so it's a really easy code so i'm going to the workspace and i'll find an invisible path so i'm going to add a script into it all right so the first thing is i'm going to make it a little bit transparent so not too much because if you make it more transparent it's easy for the player to identify so i'm going to write script dot payron dot transparency is equal to 0.1 and then i had to make sure that anything that is being collided on this platform is going to be false which makes my player to go through or falls down through the platforms when it steps onto these invisible lines so i'm going to make script dot parent dot can't collide is equal to false all right so it's the same script for the other invisible part so let's do something easy so i'm going to copy this script and then i'm going to select all my invisible parts so you can select click on one in invisible palm and hold your shift key and click on the other invisible paths like this and right click on your mouse or your keypad or your trackpad and then click on paste into selected and the script would be automatically pasted so i do have few more invisible files here all right so that's the script for your invisible pawn and we have done with our first obstacle so now let's go on to the second obstacle which is going to be a laser mix alright so i'm going to start here and i'm going to add another neutral point or a spawn location so what i'm going to do is i'm going to make it a little bit bigger and add in the small location here so i'm going to make my maze here that's filled with laser walls so first i'm going to add my base so i'll just make it black color because the laces i will be coloring in red color so i need a platform or a base that's going to be sticking out or show my laces to be a little bit more sharper and then i'm going to make some parts again so this time i'm going to choose my lace color so i'll just make it red color and the material should be neon and then i'll just make it bigger like this use scale function and create a part like this or maybe even bigger so that it's actually designs in two walls of a base so i'll just make one here like that and once i have made one i'll just rename it as laser because we do have to write a code for this all right so next i'll just keep on creating some walls make sure the walls are not too near each other because you have to have some space in order for your player to move around okay so i have created a mini laser maze so what i'm going to do is i'm going to make one of these walls to be a little bit more transparent so the player would not actually see it so it's kind of like being a little bit tricky amazed all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to click on this part the one in the middle and i'm going to click on the property tab of this particular laser part so if you can't find this property tab on my right corner so you can always go to view click on properties so i have clicked on this one so on the property tab go down a little bit and you see transparency option okay so right now it's zero so i'm going to increase it so i'm going to use the slider okay so i'm going to make it like nine five so it's a little bit visible like this okay so i have made my laser wall for the laser maze so next i'm going to create my spinning platforms again which is also going to be with lasers all right so i'm going to keep on continuing this platform so i'll just click on this copy it and then to rotate it i'll just click on model and click on the rotate function so i'm going to rotate it along the yaxis so i'll just turn it along the green circle and then i'm going to fix it like this so i'm going to choose like add some like gaps jumping platform like this okay so this platform i'm going to lift it a little bit up okay so it's can be easily identified from the other platforms so kind of like giving a little heart to it okay so to make my spinning platforms i need two parts one is for the base that's going to hold my spinning part and the other one is going to be the actual spinning part and to make them combine i'm going to use unhinge so let's see how we can make it so first i'm going to make one platform here so i'm going to add my base i'll just choose the material to be plastic and a different color okay so i'm going to rename this little part so um stretch it a little bit and make sure that it matches with the height of the platform the base platform that's here right now it's mesh you can click on the scale and lift it and i'm going to rename this part as base next i'm going to add my spinning part so again i'm going to use part and then this time i'm going to select a different colors and now i'm going to stretch it so that it's going to the length of this is going to be the addition of this base part and this platform's width so the length i'm going to stretch it like that all right now let's see how we can add our constraint so first i'm going to oh before that make sure that you spin or rename this part as spin okay so now i'm going to click on move and lift it up a little bit this is to make sure that you correctly hinge your parts later on we are going to bring it down i'm going to um i'm changing my camera wave so that i can see the top of this base and the bottom side of the spinning platform yeah this would be better so i can see the top and the bottom of this so i'm going to click on hinge so you can find hinge on this tool and then i'm going to click on this and click on hinge so i'm going to start from the base so as you can see here i'm adding a attachment and i'm going to lift it and then connect it so that it's connecting from the bottom side of the spinning platform not to a side or to the top is to the bottom side of the spinning platform like that all right so the hinge constraint is attached to the base right now but there's also another attachment on the spin so if i click on here i do have an attachment now i'm going to bring this down so again i'm going to click on move and bring it down okay so right now the hinge would not make your platform to move because it's going to be a stationary hinge so in order to make it move i'm going to click on the hinge constraint and then it will open up the property tab again next i'm going to go down and there's a type or property called accutated type so this is telling us what kind of hinge would it or should it be so i'm going to click on that and click on motor so that it's turning next on the motor i so if you go down on the property tab i do have another property called angular velocity so this means the speed at which the hinge should be turning so i'm going to give a smaller number to be around three so you can go up to 10 or 20. so if you go to a higher number the speed of spinning would be really really fast so i'm going to keep it a little bit simple not too fast spinning so i'll just make it three next i need to update the value of the moto max torque property so this means the strength of the spinning so for this you have to give a really big number so i'm going to give a number of 100 000 okay so that it pushes with the big foes and then keeps on turning with a big force all right so you can always try this out so let's take a look at how this spin works so i'm going to click on play here i have my as you can see here my platform is spinning okay so right now it doesn't do anything because i have not given a code right so but later on we are going to fix the code so that whenever you touch this spinning platform you would be your health would be radius all right so one important thing is that on the spinning platform so i'm going to create a couple of these spinning platforms so now when you move it you have to make sure that there is a space between this two platforms because if you keep on if you don't have enough space they would actually get stuck into each other and then your spinning platform could not longer spin because they're touching each other so it's better if you give like like consider the length of this spinning platform and then foreign all right so there's a little bit of spacing i have to do all right so i have made the spacing and then made my spinning platform to be equally space so now i'm going to make the kill sprite which is going to make my laser holes and the spinning platforms to kill my player when they touch each other so i'm going to click on this laser part and make a script okay so i'm going to make a function that is called kale in lower language the player is known as the object called humana so here i have given i have made my humanoid or the player to be a local player then i'm going to give the condition so if the player touches them they're going to reduce the hell next i need to write my email so when the parent i'm going to run the function call here so i'm going to make sure that this script is going to be in all the laces and also on the spinning part of my platforms so that's all for today make sure to subscribe to our channel to check out the next section of this project and don't forget to hit the like
