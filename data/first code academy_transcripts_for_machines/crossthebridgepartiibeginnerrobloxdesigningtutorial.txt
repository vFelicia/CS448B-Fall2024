hello everyone welcome back to our channel here we share beginnerfriendly coding tutorials on scratch roblox minecraft with programming and many more so today we are going to create a roblox project called cross the bridge in this video we will use roblox studio to code the project using lua language we will code two scripts where the first one is the kill script which applied to the bombs and the poisonous water and the next script would be to change the direction of the player's camera into a topdown v alright so let's get started now we will type the code required to make sure that the player dies every time he or she touches the water on the bomb so if you hover over the bomb okay over here in the explorer part you will see a plus sign button and on clicking that you will search for script so this will allow us to type in the code now you're in the script already how about let's delete the template first let's delete it and in the first line we're going to create a function with the name kill and the parameter hit so this hit so it will only kill the object that was being hit on the second line let's create a variable with the name player we're going to write local player equals hit parent and then column find first child and open a parenthesis also quotation mark humanoid so here the hit target of this function is the first object that has a humanoid part which means a human or a player itself now we're going to create the line number three with the conditional if the player okay and then at the sign equals nil then so this means that the if the player is not absent in the game then we will drop the player's health into zero then here let's add player dot health equals zero and now in line seven let's type this script dot parent dot touch and then colon connect parenthesis kill so what this line does is that the player will only get killed when touching the object which contains this script which means the bomb now we finish the script how about let's copy the script copy it and then paste it into the other bomb objects paste into okay paste in paste into copy and then paste into again paste in two if you want to make it faster again you can always use the shift don't forget that we're going to add this script into the turret which is the water the last part of this project is to change the direction of the player's camera into a top down view alright now let's go to the starter player in the explorer right go down starter player should be here hover over the starter player and let's see the starter player script do you see the plus sign over here click the plus button and let's look for local script all right and then we're going to rename this into this able camera movement and then we're going to delete the template script over here on the first line we will wait for one second wait parenthesis 1 to make sure the player is font before we change the then we will disable the camera movement by using script dot parent dot disable camera movement all right it's that one disable camera movement equals true this will restrict players to looking in a certain direction now let's hover again over the starter pair scripts and then we're going to create another new local script all right we're going to name this local script as new direction now let's delete the template script on line number one let's define the position of our camera now we're going to give a local variable with the name offset so this will store the position the camera is facing depending on the direction you are facing you might need to adjust the position later on so that you can create a top down view now let's write vector 3 dot mu and then open a parenthesis all right and then how about let's change it into 0 100 and 50. you can always change this anytime you want but let's do this first let's do the 0 150 first now on line number two let's create a variable called player local player so in this player it will store the players in this game now we're going to use grip parent dot parent to refer to the starter player level so this will ensure that the new camera setting will be applied to all the players even when you publish your game on line number three let's create a variable called camera local camera equals game dot workspace dot current camera so this variable will refer to the camera in the workspace on line number four let's create a variable called run service local run service so this run service will get the service of run service we will further clarify this as we code so here in the roblox the run service component contains method which manage the context of which the game is running now we're going to have game column get service run service on line 5 we will change the camera's field of view to 90. now let's type camera dot field of view and then equals 90 so the field of view is the range of the game world that can be shown on the screen changing it to 90 will show us the bigger portion of the game now on the sixth line let's create a function with the name function with the name on render step and let's enter to the line number seven so here we're going to create a variable with the name player position so this player position will store the position of the humanoid root part of the player actually the humanoid root part is the core of a player and it can be used to locate a player now let's have equal over here and then let's have player dot character dot humanoid root part dot position on line eight let's create a camera position variable local camera position equals player position plus offset so here the camera position variable will store the adjuster's position of the camera the adjusted position is the player's position plus the offset on line number nine let's reset the c frame or the coordinate frame of the camera now we have camera dot coordinate frame equals c frame dot new and then we're gonna have parenthesis camera position comma layer position now to carry out the top down view adjustment we'll run on line 11 the bind to renders that function so we're going to have run service and then column bind to render steps yep so there are three main arguments in the bind to render step function first we have the name second is the priority and the third is what function to call okay so for our program it will be camera remember the apostrophe and then enum dot render priority render priority dot camera dot value and then we're going to have on render step after typing out the script go to file and then save your project then go to home and then play to test it out now i'm testing the game right now here i cannot adjust my camera movement and then when i go here you need to really really be careful and then let's see if the bomb works okay the bomb works properly over here then what will happen if we accidentally fall down okay so we'll die so that's all for the game design of this project hope you like this video don't
