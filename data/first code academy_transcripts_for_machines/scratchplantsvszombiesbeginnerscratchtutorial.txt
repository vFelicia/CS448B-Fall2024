hello everyone welcome back to our channel here is your beginner friendly coding tutorials on scratch roblox minecraft web programming and many more today we are going to create a plans via zombie game so this is the game for the scratch uh plans to be a song begin so when i click the queen select button when i press the up and down console and then press the space b bar uh it will kill the zombie like that and then there's another plant and when you click to it kind of tells the zombie as well so well since we're using scratch scratch is actually a website that allows us to create animations and games using block based coding so the game we create utilize conditionals motion keyboard defense and variable so let's get started so now we can start turning inside our scratch template you can find in the description box below so open the template you can see that um there's already the sprites the background and then everything is well designed uh we're going to move on to our coding so first of all uh go to our variables we're going to make three variables which is the three zombies so zombie and then zombie two and then zombie three like that so we created three variables okay so in order to not blocking our sprites we're just going to move all of these scores at the bottom of our screen like that so we can see their health at the bottom of the screen all right after our variables uh we will start coding starting with our chamber so inside chomper um first of all click drag the one green select click and then next thing we're going to do is actually go to x and y so make sure that every time when we open our app our game it's on the same position and then drag it forever loop inside this form we have three conditions so three if then inside of first we're just going to get the f key up arrow pressed so which means if the error is first which is going up so that's why we're just going to move our y by 10 if it's not which is if the down down arrow is pressed our chomper which is going to move down so change y by negative 10 oh i use 10 like that and when space key is pressed which means if it's shooting some balls okay we're just going to broadcast a new message squash it let's call it like that all right so we finished our chomper now we're going to move on to our plant actually uh okay so inside our plant uh they have very similar actions which is like moving up and down and they shoot some balls out so inside this one we're just gonna click when green flag is clicked again and then go to x and y in this position afterwards we're going to drag the fourth loop again and then three if then now for the plant key since we don't want it to crash or duplicate with the chomper i will just do another keys so instead of up down we're just going to get the w for up arrow so change y by 10 and if the s key s is pressed so we're going to change y by negative 10 again oh this is change x okay so and then for the space key we are going to change it to number two when the two key is pressed we want to broadcast message so since like they are shooting in different balls so there's like ball and ball too um bottoms represent s uh it's for plant and ball is associated with chomper so that's why they need two different broadcast message so a new message should too like that all right so this is um both the planet and chomper moving on to our zombies so first of all our first zombie this one so uh we're going to drag that when green flag is clicked and then uh we wanted to start at this position uh they started that so go to x and y like that oh don't remember to show the zombie first so like that and then why uh so for y uh we can actually pick some random uh integers for that so it just kind of pops up in a different position so from the range from 140 to negative 140 to 140 and then drag the forever loop again now we want to um we want our zombie to always point in direction negative 90 and then move towards the left side uh and wait for a couple seconds so actually less than one second so point in direction negative 90 so on your left side and then move from a random let's say two to five steps two to five so afterwards uh wait for 0.8 seconds and then this is how the zombie walk uh the other code we have to get is when when flight is is when they um hit the ball so when green flag is clicked first of all we're going to set our score of zombie 2 100 first so which is still health uh that's maximum health and we're going to do another forever loop inside this form of a loop we have three if statements again so drag me if then out but inside forever loop so the first one is actually when is touch when when is touching uh either of the balls so we are going to get the ore so the first thing uh touching so the first one is actually touching the ball and then the second one touching the ball too like that so i'm just touching the ball too okay so we're going to change our zombies health by negative 100 so it will become zero so obviously the next if statements are just going to be f zombie which is the index of that equals to zero first of all well it die basically so we're going to hide we're going to hide our zombie afterwards wait for a second and then after waiting a second it will respond to the original location which is like the start of the line so go to x and y x would be not 193 y would be a pick of random in between well negative 140 to 140 like that afterwards we're going to click the show so it shows up again and we're going to let it set its health back to 100 so when use new zombies afterwards okay so there's one more thing uh for losing the game is when it touch the topper so in touch this chamber we're going to stop everything so stop our script inside yes so stop the script and this is how we lose the game so basically this this is like the code for the zombie um there are actually for this zombie 2 and zombie 3 they have very similar code as the first zombie so i'm just going to copy and play paste for the codes so for our second zombie um well basically it's just like pretty similar to our verse zombie so there is only a couple things that we want to change for our second zombie so for our second zombie instead of like oh it's that's like that we're going to change it to knight 193 and then from a random height from negative 100 to 100 so the range is like slightly smaller and then this step is just going to be a little bit faster since like the range is smaller so we don't have to move all right in the larger range so it's just going to be moving a little bit faster so and then the next thing we're going to do uh in this code well we're just going to set our zombie 2 since this is the zombie 2. okay we're changing everything into every single variable into zombie two as well as like the score of that so drag it out zombie two it goes to zero like that so basically that's it for our second zombie and change it to a hundred this group yes so okay i'm going to copy this code to zombie 3 again and we do the whole thing so for example three we want our x and y like that and then the range is slightly larger when they start their game so negative 120 to 120 like that and then we want it to be slow extremely slow for this zombie so we're just going to get the pick random that's just ranging from one steps to three steps all right so moving on to the next one the only thing we have to change is only the variables so zombie three zombie three and three and delete the 72 put the sum three inside it's one second and we want to do the one negative 120 and 120 again so that's it for our zombies okay so moving on to our last code which is the balls they both have similar codes again so let's code for the first ball okay drag the drag out the ring green flag is clicked and then we're going to hide our ball first the next thing that it kind of shows up when we press the either the space key bar or the key too so inside our ball uh we this ball only shows up when we press this space keyboard since it's like associated with the chomper only so when i receive this is a message for chomper so the next thing we're going to do after is press the spacebar we're going to show our ball and then we're gonna click go to chomper so this one and then pointing direction 90 so it's moving towards the right and repeat until loop here so in this ruby until we have four conditions for this so four of them will be well we're just going to put the or inside the ore inside or so there are four conditions so the first condition is when it's touching oh when it's touching the first zombie or if it's touching second zombie or if it's touching the third zombie or if it's touching to edge so there's a stopping point for that wall if it's touching if it's not touching either of these well we're just going to move 20 steps forward and afterwards we're just going to hide our ball again and then we're going to play a sound for our ball which is laser to that so basically that's it for uh the first ball so i'm going to copy and paste it on ball too again since it's a pretty similar condition so uh the only thing it changed is actually only two things that change is when i receive shoot 2 which is the broadcast message for the plant um it would not show in front of the chomper it would it'll be shown in front of the plant so that's the only change for the second ball so basically that's it for the game uh for the gameplay now let's try it out for that okay let's try it i'm gonna move the chomper okay it makes it zombies die like that okay so for my plant i'm moving with w and s when i press two it shoots a ball and when i press two it's just another ball like that so it dies like that so when they touch zombie as you can see the zombies tell this immediately immediately turn to zero after the ball touches the zombie like that so basically that's it that's the end of the game well so that's it for today in this tutorial we created a plan vs zombie game the use of scratch hope you like this video don't forget to subscribe and like our videos also check out these two other videos while you're
