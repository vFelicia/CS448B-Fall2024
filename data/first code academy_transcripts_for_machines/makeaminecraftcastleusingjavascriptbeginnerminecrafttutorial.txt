hello everybody and welcome back to our channel here we share beginnerfriendly tutorials on minecraft roblox scratch web programming and many more today we'll learn how to build a capsule in minecraft using javascript so as you can see this is a structure that we're gonna be building and um yes four walls and under each corner there's a castle or a mini tower and to build the tower to build the castle all you need to do is stand to anywhere you want to place a capsule look at the ground and type js castle like this and you can wait a second the castle should start building itself so you see the door being made the walls are being formed and um the towers are being created so yeah let's get started we'll begin the project by writing our function in sublime text here we can first create our first file so here we go to file new file and we can actually save it right now so we can go to file save as and where we want to save it is actually where we store our spaghot server file so here i can go to my desktop i have it saved inside of spots 1.10.2 and i've also installed scriptcraft so i'm going to go into plugins next to scriptcraft i'm just going to save this as castle and make sure to save as type is all files i'm gonna click save so now anything right here can be used in the minecraft server so the first thing we have to do is to write down a function a function is a set of instructions for the computer to follow so if you name our function cancel with an empty parameter so there's no inputs required this means that this is a function called castle that when we call off we'll run the following instructions so we want to set this castle to a function so we set it equal to a function and we still don't have any user input so we keep the parameters as empty another thing before we start writing the function is we want to export it before writing a function we want to export the function by exporting function we can actually use the function inside of a minecraft server so here we just write exports and now anything we type inside of this bracket called block will be executed when the function castle is uh run so inside of our function we first want to say build the walls and to build a wall we use a cylinder and we'll be using the cylinder zero here and the reason right zero at the end is because it creates a hollow cylinder which means that there's going to be four walls outside with nothing in the middle so the parameters for cylinder zero is the type of block width height so the first thing we want to do is put down the blocks in the first parameter so here i'll use blocks dot brick dot red that's my blocks for uh the walls i want the walls to be 10 blocks wide and five blocks tall and if we imagine a drone building our castle the drone will first build a cylinder that is hollow using bricks that are 10 blocks wide and five blocks tall and we can actually relocate the drone to build more stuff in a different location and we do that by simply reading right left up forward or down so here we're gonna move the drone seven blocks to the right and also move it forward by seven blocks now i wanna build an empty box that will be shown as a castle and the tower under each side of the corner so here i'm gonna write box zero inside the box zero i have four parameters blocks width height and depth so the blocks will be blocks dot cobblestone i want to build it using cobblestone i want to be seven blocks wide five blocks tall and seven blocks depth and here width and depth is pretty much uh very similar we wanted to be symmetrical so we want them to be the same now i want to move up and build my second floor in the roof so i'm going to say dot up i'm gonna move five blocks up once i've moved five blocks up i want our drone to build a box that is not empty so here i'll use box and the blocks i'm gonna use it's to say blocks dot slab dot stone break i want this box to be seven blocks wide one block tall and seven blocks back now it's time to build our floor for the second floor so here i'm going to use a hollow box i'm going to build the hollow box using a fence material of oak here i want the width to be seven height again to be one with again to be seven now it's time to build the door so we're gonna move back down by five blocks and after that i'm gonna also move to the right by three blocks and here i'm gonna make space for the door so i'm gonna write box blocks dot air that will remove anything that's currently at that spot and i'll use the same dimension as a door which is one block wide two blocks high and one block deep and now i can move back the drone by seven blocks and put down the doors so here i'm going to write box and the block number we can actually use um by looking up the block number in case of a door we find that the block number is 196. so we can simply write 196 and then the width should be one height should be two and uh depth be one and that will end our whole instructions and this one line of code will actually build the whole castle for us so let's see um how that works so let's just go to files and save and here to boot up the server we can actually go to terminal or command prompt so i'm going to type in command go into command prompt and when you're activating the server you should use your personal id so define your id you can do one or two things you can first write ip config and here your ip address will be located under i pv4 address and so this is going to be my local address when i host the server another way to look at it is go on any web browsers and simply type in my ip address and as you can see my public ip is the same as what is shown over here once you have the ip you can start to boot up the server so to do that we want to go to the file where you have all your server files at so i'm going to go to the folder desktop specs at 1.10.2 so now i have entered this folder and to start up the server i simply write java for java jar and to enter the server i type java dash jar space the name of the file shows spec got dash 1.10.2 dot jar and when i press enter the server will start to boot up and um and anyone could join the server using this public iep right here so once the library has finished loading it will load up the world and um yeah once you enter the server you can type castle with an empty parameter and then it will actually do it so it is still booting up yep and it is done so to run the java program you can enter the game and type slash js castle brackets and close brackets and this code will um start to build the caster in front of you so that is all for today we learned how to make a castle using javascript and minecraft hope you guys enjoyed be sure to like and subscribe and i'll see you next time bye
