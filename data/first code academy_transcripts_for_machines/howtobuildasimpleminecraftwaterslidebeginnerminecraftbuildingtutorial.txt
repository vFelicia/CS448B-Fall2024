hello everybody and welcome back to our channel here we share beginnerfriendly coding tutorials on scratch roblox minecraft web programming and many more today we're gonna make a water slide in minecraft so for today's project we will learn how to make a big water slide in minecraft that looks like this where we have a platform where the user can climb up through the ladder and he can go down to the first slide and uh you can also go to the second slide which will you know bring them in through the water and then bring it into the main pool so yeah let's get started so to start this project i'll create a single player creative world in minecraft so first i'll click on single player and since i don't have a single player um it has told me to make a new world here i can just change the name to water slide i'm going to change the game mode to creative change the difficulty to peaceful so no mobs can distract us and then over here more world options i'm gonna go and change the world type so it says super flat so use super flat as the work type and then i can go and create world so yep as the world loads in we can see that this is some super flat world where everything just flat um here i'm in creative mode so if i press e i can enter my inventory and grab any items and um the game of minecraft so here i'm just gonna grab um scroll down and then i'm just gonna grab two blocks so i'm gonna go to clay and grab a red play block and maybe yellow okay so for the first part of the water slide we'll want to put a shape that resembles a water slide so let's do that um so the shape we want is going to have the following pattern i'm going to have two blocks side by side and then move up one block like this and this block is gonna have five blocks so one two three four five so two blocks four five five blocks and then followed by three blocks up top so again oops two blocks five blocks three blocks here we're gonna have two blocks this and followed by two one block so one block one block like this so this will be the shape that we will have so two blocks five three two one one and we want to make this platform two blocks thick so let's add a caterpillar on the other side all right and on this side um i'm going to add kind of the border for the slide so we can't fall off so here i'm going to put block like this and so the red blocks should have the same shape as these uh yellow blocks here i'm gonna put down blocks on the side like that and keep the corners um empty or blockless okay so that's my first side look at this okay now i'm gonna do the other side oops so after you have got the slide to look like this we can add the second part to this slide so here let's take out these two red blocks and let's increase the size of our yellow blocks to be one block higher next i'm gonna grab the c lanterns from the inventory so i can go to search items over here and look up c lantern and then i can just drag it to my inventory and what we're going to do here is actually make a platform surrounding this top yellow platform so here i'll add a few blocks to the back extend it wide and here i'm gonna make this block six blocks uh wide so here three four five six and then i'm gonna loop this back to connect with this up here so we'll have a four by six uh rectangle after this we should expand this platform here so i'm going to add yellow blocks all the way around even in the corners okay and what i'm going to do is add um an extra layer on just a corner so that you can have a platform that looks something like this so i extended the sides um by one block but left the center of the corner uh as air so so so now we should get something like this where the water size comes down here and over here there's a platform similar to uh the bottom part of the slide we'll be adding red blocks as the board so here i'm going to have red blocks border like this and i'm just going to surround this border around this platform that we have like so and so we should get something like this and now um let's add some water so um we want to add water to fill up this whole platform and water flows down here so let's just add uh an area for the water pool to kind of form at the bottom of the slide so let's grab another block um go down here and grab some ports and we can just kind of make um a 10 by 10 rectangle around um it's fine the size my sauce is kind of symmetrical so here actually i'm just gonna go four blocks this way so one two three four and then place that one block so there's five blocks apart so five so one two three four five something like this so i have five blocks between this yellow block and this white block and um let's make this block uh 12 by 12 square so here are three four five six seven and i'm gonna move it across like this again uh what block you pick is all preference so here i can just go in downward okay great and now let's grab a water bucket and uh let's fill this place up with water so we just have to put the water box um around here so we can actually just put it um on all four corners i like to put it on all the edges so that the water will be flowing to the middle so i'm just going to add water source to the corner blocks as you can see now we have a water slide going down like so so finally we're going to add one more layer it's kind of similar to this bottom layer over here above this swimming pool so we have two layers to our water slide so here i'm gonna add uh from these two blocks i'm gonna quickly change these two blocks to yellow blocks so i can tell and here i'm gonna expand this to two blocks wide followed by five blocks followed by three blocks followed by two blocks followed by one block and one block and again to make this two blocks wide and we'll do the same thing that's the first slide where we add the border like so that we'll do that for a whole slide like that and finally over here i'll add some platforms and i'm gonna grab ladders and what i'm gonna do is have a platform that stands out like this and i'm expanded so and i'm gonna have this wall connect to the bottom or all the way to the floor almost there perfect and now i'm just going to have one ladder so that the user can climb up and yeah this is going to be our whole water slide for today so that's all for today hope you guys enjoyed this video don't forget to subscribe and like our
