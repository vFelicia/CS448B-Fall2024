hello everyone so today we're getting to know we're gonna learn about what didn't do and where was made and through learning what and understanding we're gonna be introduced to the amazing world of robotics and coding so let's begin we are going to look at where was created was created in the United States by a robotics and educational startup called the Wonder workshop in the year 2014 the Wonder workshop is not only home to but it's also the home to the dot robot and another robot called Q in a bit you're gonna hear say hello he's gonna say hey what is the robot a robot is a machine which is able to do things that are dangerous or repetitive for humans it is able to understand instructions that's given by humans through a computer or a tablet using something called code can also be given instruction through an iPad by dragging code that looks like puzzle pieces which can be actually attached to each other here's a little fun fact do you know that 40% of robots in the world are actually in Japan depend has the most amount of bots on earth in our life there are actually a lot of robots around us and robots help us to do a lot of things they're used in helping save lives helping build cars delivering goods and even helping us find out more about what's happening in space the first image there is a robot helping build a Tesla car the second image is of a robot on Mars and so the third one what is coding coding is writing a bunch of instructions to a computer or robot when you want it to do something for example if you want to tell to move around and make a sound all you would need is your trusty finger and an iPad isn't that amazing so let's look at what can do is also able to give greetings such as and now he's gonna turn around here you're gonna see spin and light up in different colors lights flash from is front which is right under his eyes and there's also light flashing from the left and right ear of we're gonna look at how can move just like us it can go forward backwards has four buttons on the top of him so there is button one which has one dot there is button 2 which has two dots and then there's button three which has three dots the big button that's right in the middle a big white circle is called the top button so these buttons can trigger some events when they are pressed one cool thing is can make sounds you're going to hear different animal sounds in the way what you're hearing is mimicking a cat a dog a crocodile each button triggers an event when I press the talk button the sound of an engine revving when I press button will make a sound I press the button three on is gonna make this what our sensors humans we have the ability to sense such as sight smell taste touch and field robots like also have sensors has sensors which have the ability to do some interesting things for example can detect when something is in front of it and also when something is behind it and you can program to tell it what to do when it sees an obstacle so let's look at what happens next these are the infrared sensors of has one placed on the top left and one placed on the top right these infrared sensors are very useful when detecting objects and with these sensors we can program to do things when it sees objects just like the infrared sensor that we had in the front we also have a infrared sensor and at the back so this is also able to detect obstacles so not only can see obstacles in the front but it also can see obstacles at the back obstacle detection in this clip we're going to look at move four and say we and when detects an obstacle using the infrared sensors in the front it will then stop and say so this is going to work when I press the top button of and then it's going to trigger the action of moving four so let's look at that is gonna go backwards and when the backward sensor of detects an obstacle is gonna play a sound I hope you guys had fun getting to know we got to see what could do and using would be a really great way to get started with robotics and coding you get to learn about computational thinking and learn how to solve problems through coding and robotics thank you very much for watching this video we hope you liked it please hit the like button please share it and also please subscribe bye bye
