hello everyone welcome back to our channel here we share beginner friendly coding tutorials on scratch roblox minecraft web programming and many more today we are going to create a minecraft beacon in this project we are going to create a minecraft weekend utilizing the learning mode engine which uses blog based coding the concepts covered in this tutorial would be functions drones loops variables and designing so let's get started all right so i have opened up my led to mod account so next i'm going to head to the play option and click on mods to create a custom mod so i'm going to give a name for my mod so since i'm going to make a bacon i'm going to rename my mod as beacon next i'm going to choose on the language as to blocky multiplayer so once it's been created i'm going to click on see inside and click on the option of code so this will open up the code editor so on the left hand side you can find the library of code which you can find all the necessary code blocks that you need to make your mod all right to start with coding i'm going to prepare two functions i'm going to click on functions and drag to function code block so i'm going to rename one function as main and the other function to be call beacon stage all right the function beacon stage is used to store our instructions that would require to build the and the function main is used to call our function beacon stage when the mod is used in a microphone all right so first i'm going to start off with the beacon stage so i'm going to add an input for this beacon which is going to be the side length i'm going to click on this key icon and drag in an input name block and i'm going to rename this to be side left and then i'm going to click on back the gear icon so this input would be specifically used to specify the side of our beacon stage so you later on during the game we can mention what's the size of your amount to create different size speaker so in the micro field we are going to use a drone to build any structures so drones are kind of like our eyes that would help us to place our objects on the minecraft world so on the function main i'm going to set up my drone so i'm going to click on variables and i'm going to make a variable so i'm going to rename this variable as d which stands for draw next i'm going to click on the minecraft tab and click on drone and drag in the block call new drone okay now i'm going to go back to my function beacon stage to build one line of diamond blocks so to build one line of diamond blocks i need to place one block and then move my drone to the right side and then i'm going to keep on repeating according to the number that is given on this input so in order to do that i'm going to use a loop so i'm going to click on the loops option and drag repeat 10 times block so since i do not know what's the value of my length of my beacon is going to be i'm going to remove my number block in the loop and i'm going to drag the variable of sideline or the input i'm going to variables and i'm going to drag side length option all right next i'm going to use a drone to place my blocks so i'm going to the option of drone and drag in the block called drone d place blocks of type so my minecraft would be built from diamond block so i'm going to materials and i'm going to drag the block of diamond so you can choose any materials to you want to build your own custom beacon so once i have placed my diamond block i need to move my drone to the right hand side so what i'm going to do is i'm going to drag the block call move drone in direction up distance 1 and i'm going to change the direction to be right so this means that the diamond block is placed like this and my camera shifts to the right side of a distance of one block and then it's going to keep on repeating adding blocks diamond block specifically and creating one line of diamond blocks according to the value that is given in this variable like that okay next i'm going to move to the next line so let's say i have created a line off five diamond blocks like this so right now my camera or my drone would be on this position so in order to create on more lines or start placing my blocks so i need to make my camera to go back to its original position so that means i need to move my camera towards the left hand side in a distance of the side length i'm going to click on the drone option and i'm going to click on move drone in direction up distance 1. so this block and this block is pretty much the same but here is a fixed number of the distance but here i'm going to use a variable so since i'm going to use a variable i need to use this code block to move my draw so i'm going to drag this flag and put it down this so this is to uh make one line of diamond blocks and this is to make the next line so i need to move back my camera so that is in a distance up the sideline and the direction is black so once i have created my one line of damage blocks and right now my camera is here so next i need to make my camera to go in the forward drive so that it starts to create on the other side of my beacon so next i need to tell my drone to move forward in the direct in the distance of one block so i'm going to drone and drag in the block card move direction and i'm going to change the distance to be forward and the value is going to be one okay so i need to repeat this whole instructions to build a square so once i have created one side like that i made my drone to come this way again and now it's going this side okay now i need to create i need to use this one to create a square so that it's going to cover one stage of my beacon so i'm going to repeat all these instructions again according to the number that is given on my sideline so i'm going to drag a loop block a repeat block again put this code inside and then put it inside the function and i'm going to change the number of the repetition which is going to be the value inside the side variable okay so once it created one square stage it should come back to its original position or to its starting position so i'm going to click on drone and make my drone to come backwards which is going to be out of this repetition block and it should come back in a distance of the side plane okay now this is one layer so i need to go to the next layer so it's like i have one layer like that so i need to move my camera one layer to the top so it's going to create another layer like this so i'm going to move my camera so up one distance right a distance and then make sure that it's in the forward direction also okay now in a beacon so as you go on the layers the size of the layers is going to get reduced which is going to be like a recursion function so i have one layer like this so the next layer would be smaller than the previous layer and it's going to keep on repeating until i have only one block left on the top all right so i'm going to repeat the same function beacon stage with the value of the side line that is going to be reduced by two so that if i have one layer like this two blocks would be removed in the next layer and creating it like this so it's going to keep on repeating so it's going to remove two blocks and then that would be the size of the next layer and keep on repeating like that in every stage i just need to remove um two from the current value in the site none so i'll just go to functions and drag the call function block called beacon stage and i need to subtract 2 so math minus side length minus two all right so next i need to use an if statement to check if or when i'm going to end so i need to end building each layer once the side length is equal to one so i'm going to drag i'm going to logic and drag it to block and put it on top and next i'm going to drag an else block and put it inside here so my condition is if the side length is greater than one it's going to repeat this instructions and if the side length becomes less than one or equals to one so it's going to place a beacon on top of all those diamond layers so i'm going to set up my condition so if the side length is greater than 1 then i'm going to run all this function creating layers if it is if the side length is equal is less than one i'm going to place a beacon with the help of a drone so i'm going to materials and drag in a beaker okay and also now we have to make sure that the size the value that the person enters on the side is not going to be an even number so we need to give another if statement to run this code for this instructions only when the valid that a person enters into the cycle is going to be an odd number so i'm going to drag in an f2 block put it on top and my condition is if the side length value is hot so i'm going to math and drag in blank is even make it odd and what's going to be odd is the value of the sideline and if it is yes then it's going to run this instructions all right so we have done the function for the beacon stage now i need to run this function when i use my mod so i'm going to call the beacon function when the function main is run so i'm going to function and drag in the beacon stage so here i can input the value of my sideline so i'm going to keep it nine so if you want a bigger beacon make sure you enter a bigger number but it should be an odd number not an even number so i'm going to start with nine all right so this is the finished chord blocks for my beacon so to try out my code on my micro fold i'm going to click on mod and it will say that it's done so next i have to open up my minecraft file and then make sure that you have connected the server and then run it on your microphone right so i have opened up my minecraft launcher so once i clicked on the mod on my editor as you can see i have my church box so when i click it my beacon is loaded here so i'm going to drag this book and place it down on my inventory next i'm going to find a flat brown like this and make sure the game mode is on the rifle and i'm going to make sure that my mod is on my hand and i'm going to click on as you can see here it's starting to build my beaker so the first side is nine blocks long so it's going to keep on building now i have my frequency up so that's all for today i hope you enjoyed this project don't forget to subscribe to our channel and like our videos also check out
