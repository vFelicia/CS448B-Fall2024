hello everybody welcome back to our channel here we share beginning friendly coding tutorials on scratch roblox minecraft web programming and many more today we're going to create a scratch band so in this project i'll teach you how to make a scratch interactional game that is related to the camera for this project the user will have to turn on the camera and move around to play the instrument we will also play a clip showing you how to use your camera to play the instruments so we'll start this project by creating a new project in scratch so go ahead and go to scratch.mit.edu and log in using your accounts and afterward let's go over to the top left and click on create to make a new project afterward let's rename this new project in the top to live bang and let's also remove our sprite 1 which is the cat and in this project we're not going to use any backdrops so the plain white black drop will do instead we'll be including an extension so go ahead and go to the bottom left here and click on this little blue button and this will open up all the extensions that we can have that's offered from scratch the one we're trying to select is video sensing so sense motion with the camera so we're going to click here and now as you see on the left for blocks we have added a new section called video sensing now let's add the sprites in this project i will need force right i will need a saxophone a drum a guitar and a keyboard so all four of these sprites could be found in the sprite library so instead of uploading a sprite i would just be using the default sprites that is offered in sprite uh in scratch and um so to find the four sprites let's go over here to choose your sprites so the first one i'm gonna look up is saxophone so look up saxophone there it is and let's look up the other ones second one i'm gonna look up is drum so i can look up drum and i'm gonna get the drum kit over here next let's grab the guitar so here i'm gonna look up guitar and i'm gonna grab the the guitar and then finally we will want a keyboard so here let's look up keyboard and now they're showing one option it's awesome now i'm going to spread out the sprites um i want my guitar to be in the bottom left my uh my keyboard to be on the top left my saxophone to be on the top right and my drum kit to be on the bottom right um and it's important to spread these out so that the camera sensing or the video sensing would not overlap and um each motion will only indicate uh one of the instruments to play next for each of these um sprites i want to assign a sound to the sprite so that's when the video camera senses movement for that specific sprite it will place the sound so let's go over here to sounds and um here we see that there's a lot of sound we can pick from um so for each one we will only need one of them and so since there's so many default sounds that are included with the sprite instead of picking one that we want from the library we can just pick one from here um and it's important that you can play it through to see what it really sound like and then pick the one that you like and then um we can kind of keep track of the name and then use that name for the call so here i think katar uh with the c guitar is nice and with the keyboard i think the uh c2 electric piano is nice with the drum kit i do believe that drum bass two um is the best one and for the saxophone i'll be using the g um stacks over here so these are the four sounds i have selected inside of our sounds and again you can pick any sound you want or even import a new sound so once we have designed our band scene over here with the four corners it's time to do the coding parts here we want the following behaviors with our sprites we want the sprites to be able to detect whether something is moving behind them via the video sensing and it will play a sound when it does detect that and you also play the sound at the sign sounds that we have uh decided to play so yeah let's start by coding our saxophone let's grab from event when green flag is click and when the green flag is clicked we want to turn on the camera and enable the video sensing so here we'll go over here to video sensing and grab turn video on block and we'll keep it as uh on so now whenever we press the green button um it will start to sense um motion using our camera next um also still within the saxophone code let's go ahead and grab another when green flag is clicked and now we want to grab a forever loop so go over to control forever here what we want to say is inside of this forever loop we want to check if the video sensing has detected something that is behind the saxophone in this case we want to play the dedicated sound so let's go over to control again and grab the if block so the if and then block and inside it's here we want to find um or we want to detect when the user has moved um behind the saxophone via his camera so here we can use an operator and let's grab the lesson operator okay i'm sorry so let's grab the greater than operator which is just the first one here and put it inside of our conditional and here on the left side we want to grab some block from video sensing so go over here to video sensing and the one we want to grab is the video motion on sprite so let's grab that and put it on the left side of the conditional and here instead of 50 we'll change it to 40. and when this happens that means we have crossed over behind the saxophone and the sound should be played and here let's go to sound and uh start sound and remember we have selected tree uh the g sec so here i'm gonna select gsax and that would be the code for our saxophone all right so um we'll be doing the same thing for the next three sprites um with this block over here so let's do that so here for the drum kit i will once again grab the when green flag is clicked and go over to control and grab the forever loop here again i'll grab the if statements and inside the if statements i'll grab the greater than conditional and once again on the left side of the conditional i want to go over to video sensing and grab video motion on sprites and the slight difference between these three sprites and the saxophone is that in the conditional instead of 40 we're gonna type 30. and then once again we'll play the sound that we have decided to play for that specific uh instrument so for the drum um the drum bass two is what we have decided on so yep this would be the complete code for our drum kit moving on to guitar we'll be doing something very very similar so here we grab when green flag is clicked again we can grab the forever loop and uh grab the if statements inside the if statements we'll once again be using the greater than conditional and the left side of the conditional should be video motion on sprites and again we'll change this to 30 and for sound we can say play sound or start sound and here i kind of decided that maybe the c katori is the best um in this case it doesn't really matter um again you can pick any sound you like so i'm just showing you an example of a sound so let's finish this project by completing our keyboard so again the keyboard will have the same instructions we have when green flag is clicked and then we enter this infinite loop or forever loop in the forever loop we will check for one condition and the condition is going to have an operating system and the condition is going to have an operator a conditional which is secured event operations and again on the left side we will grab the video sensing uh video motion of sprites and on the right we'll change 50 to 30 and inside the loop we'll write uh play sound or start sound and here again you can pick the sound that you like um but um c2 electric piano is my choice and yeah so now we have actually completed the project um go ahead and press the green button and uh experiment with the instrument and the live band so that's all for today hope
