hi everyone welcome back to first code academy and today we're going to take a look at part two of our five part video series on how to build a city in roblox studio i hope you enjoy it in today's video we're going to take a look on how to use the terrain editor to build a simple park how to use the different brushes how to edit the type of terrain that we want and what are the different parts of the terrain editor for by building this park and adding some simple accessories to it will be giving our city a more lively environment so last week we left on the couple of buildings that we built as a sample of how to implement buildings into our city for this week across the street i'm going to build a sample park to show you how to edit the terrain in roblox studio first of all i'll define the area of my park or the size of my park a lot of new block on top of the block that i already have and i'm going to to choose the grass material because i want the block to be the park area i'll do a dark green one perhaps and i'll click here to insert a square block i'll use the scale tool as here to define the size of the park i'll probably have it around here remember i'm going to leave some space to add the streets in a later video we're going to do it like this and maybe here maybe for the straight size i'll leave some extra space better if to have more space and to lack space and then have to change everything after now the reason i put this uh i put this block first is because we want to have some set some sort of starting point for the rest of the terrain to build upon from and it doesn't matter if the color doesn't match what the grass will be we can always change the color over here but the important thing is that it doesn't look awkward if terrain if like mountains or water is just coming out of the concrete area it just doesn't look natural enough and because it's a city we don't want the entire thing to be made out of grass we just want a little section that's why i put the grass over here now i'm just going to make sure it doesn't pop out of the map maybe like here later on you might want to delete the base plate but if it doesn't affect you then you can just leave it there here i can see that there's a little bit of concrete i'm going to make it like as the edge of the map on this part of the of the area and since remember if you want something not to move you have to anchor it so i'm gonna anchor it here let me see if i anchored this one as well before i think i even locked it in yeah this one oh it's anchored already okay oh i was selecting this part while i was editing the properties for this block over here so i mistakenly changed the material of the roof of this one so now that we are in this area over here in your home area of roblox studio you see that we have the toolbox opened and the terrain editor you can toggle them off and on by clicking these two icons over here on the top area i use the toolbox to insert accessories for the park and i'll use the terrain editor to add different types of terrain first of all i'm going to use the add and subtract brushes okay these brushes will raise the level off or map to a given like a given standard it would give to it um how big it really depends on your settings over here so i'm gonna make the toolboxes smaller for now because i don't really need it okay the pivot position just changes how it grows from the base i find that it's not really necessary to change it from the bot which is the uh basic setting the base size is how big you want the terrain to start growing so if you see here i click it and it starts growing from the bottom uh i believe i was using center before yes you can use center and the bigger the brush size the bigger it's going to be the the mountain you're building uh you can use the square shape to raise it uniformly like this remember you click it once and it will it'll keep growing for what you already have sometimes it glitches out a little bit depending on on your computer we can you always make some small adjustments if you make a mistake you can hit command z or com or control z in windows to change it again for example here i can join during this little hill um what i'm going to do now well i'm going to use top now top means that whenever the top of the shape will be attached to wherever you put it here so it's going to give you a more stuck to the base of the of the plate field you know uh it's not going to grow as dramatically as the other two with bot your terrain is going to grow in like very fast you can change the view so you can see it from above make sure you cover all the area uh as you see here i definitely selected the green that is too dark so i can also change it back to a little bit lighter maybe around here maybe it's a bit darker so how do i change this terrain over here for example well i can change it i here have grass selected and i can change it to different materials i'm going to change back to this and i'm going to make it a little bit bigger as you see here this one gives a more natural effect to the area i'm using the second grasp base more as a not really that i'm leaving this as a grass but i'm using it to know what's the shape going to be approximately so i can just delete it later if i don't need it anymore so this is like the ground of the park i'm going to use the round tool maybe i can make it a little bit bigger over here to make a little bit of a hill now once i fill it up i can use center maybe reduce the size of this and i can build a hill in the middle if you try to put it using center bottom again on top of it it will build it over what you already have is a terrain so if you want to make it more even level try to click and drag it so it drags the entire terrain in the same fashion as what you were doing before now the other two controls snap to grid basically means is that if you see there's a white grid over here it sometimes changes angle depending on the size of the of the brush you're using if the brush is too big then maybe it won't but i noticed that if you put a little a very small one it sometimes changes the angle it also depends on your camera like here it's already inclined so if you put it here it will try to build it in a diagonal fashion like this now i don't really want to stick like that of randomness so i'll just delete it but if you want to implement it like that that's that's what this one means now and what i'm going to do now is going to fix this heel so it looks a little bit more natural you you can use the smooth tools as here to as the main name says like smoothing out the surface so it doesn't make the drop that big you can just like shift around here i think we need there here sometimes your terrain might be a little bit rough so you can use this tool to even it even it out okay you can also use the erodes tool make it sink a little bit that's what a road means a road means taking like like rocks a road they get smaller in size as time goes by because of water and other tools so in the terrain context it means making the terrain smaller from what you already have it's different from subtract because subtract will take away the entire chunk we wouldn't want that we just wanted to erode the opposite of growth so for some reason i'm doing it too heavily so i'll just try to moderate my clicks so the heel doesn't like look too ugly the important thing is that the level is correct because later on i can just use the smooth tool to make it look a little bit more natural if you want to as well you can just paint with a different terrain if instead of just using that if you already have some terrain you can just paint it here well i can use the water tool to turn everything into water that is in that part of the map now water is a little bit more tricky i'm gonna use it with top because it will delete basically delete whatever you already have so you might want to grow the terrain first for example here if i want like a lake there and then i'm going to paint it with water so you see this way i make a look like a little container for my lake now of course this one looks kind of weird if you take a look very close to it it might look a little bit weird but i know what i'm going to do i'm just going to put it here and all this like green will disappear once i delete the part that i was using to build this one uh this park so i believe it was the last one if i just delete this part you see that it looks a little bit more natural however because the water is actually not too deep maybe if i increase the size of this and i change it to top there it is okay now i turn everything below it into water and even if i scroll down a little bit you'll see that the container for it also grew just the part where his water it became a lot bigger well because i turn all of this into water so it looks from the top as if you can go inside and swim so i have my little lake i have my little hill and now i can just finish it up by adding some trees for example here i i'll add a couple of pine trees and i just duplicate the same one so i can use it in multiple of them every time i create ctrl d to duplicate that's what i'm doing command d or ctrl d to duplicate it it's going to appear in the same place because i'm using collisions off now i'm going to anchor all of these so they don't fall down once i anchor one like this one if i duplicate it the one i move the clone is also going to be anchored and another good thing is that they adjust to the terrain so they'll if the train is flipped they'll flip as well and what is a park without a bench so i'll just add a bench now usually the parts that have like uh orange is there a little bit more complex than normal ones oh and even if you want you can also with the same terrain editor add a little like a road so i'm going to do that i'm going to use the paint tool i'm going to use a replace tool maybe as a brush i'm going to replace whatever i'm touching uh source material grass replace with asphalt so whatever touches the brush you see is going to become asphalt i'm going to make a smaller brush maybe like three you can always optimize and make this a little bit prettier this is a quick tutorial so i'm just going to do the basics part and this is pretty much how it will look like by using the flatten tool you'll make uh the surfaces less basically like when you have a bunch of dough and you push it down it's just going to grow into the sides that's what the flat tool will do and that's pretty much for all the tools that are mostly useful sea level just indicates where the water will naturally be now this one i don't really have much use unless you want to build like a huge sea for the entire map but since this is a city we don't need to see exactly right now we're just gonna put a little lake over there and that's it now i'm gonna play it to test it out and we can see we can have we have the park i made the pine trees maybe a little bit too short but that's okay maybe they're like baby pine trees and the water now this water the only problem is that it's just the effect of being water uh it's not really like a swimming property it's it's like if grass was made out of water you know but it's mostly for the visual effect and we have the park over here park range and that's it for today i
