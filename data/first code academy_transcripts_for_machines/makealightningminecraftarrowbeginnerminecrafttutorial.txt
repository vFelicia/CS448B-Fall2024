everyone so welcome to this tutorial in this tutorial we're going to be making a lightning arrow in minecraft with the use of javascript so i'm going to show you what this project looks like let's begin so right over here i am in my minecraft world and i have a bunch of arrows i have 64 arrows and i have a bow so this is in creative mode so once i loaded the mod i can just point the arrow lightning has been fired so this is what the mod is going to look like let's start by coding this mode first we open sublime text next we'd like to click on file and save as and then remember we're going to put this in our speak.mc folder so you can click on speak.mc as you scroll down you'll see scriptcraft as you scroll into scriptcraft you'll see plugins so we are going to save our file over here call i'm going to call this lightning arrow so light ning and then capital a rrow dot js and then click on save so this is now saved as a javascript file and to see that we can just head over here to our speaker mc folder and then you can head on to our scriptcraft folder plugins and then you'll see it right over here lightning arrow so now let's begin coding first we'll start by writing exports e x p o r t s dot light ning and then we'll put equal and then a function so there we've created a function and we've written lightning arrow next we want to create a function called strike so we'll write function strike and here we're going to add like a parameter called event as something's going to happen so we put event and then we add in our curly brackets here okay hit enter to make a space the next thing we'd like to do is we want to make a variable called projectile and what this is used for is going to get the item that we're going to use to shoot as a projectile so we're going to type in var to declare a variable and type in project tile so we have this here projectile and then we'll give it a value put event dot get ntt and then this and a semicolon so make sure you periodically save your work if you're on windows you can press ctrl s if you're on mac you can press command s next we'd like to create another variable so this is called shooter and this is referring to us so we're going to type in projectile dot get shooter the next part we'd like to do is we want to make a variable for our world basically the environment around us so we're going to call this var world equals projectile dot get world let me say this so what we've done so far we've created three variables one is projectile one is for the shooter and one is for the world projectile is what we're gonna use to shoot shooter is referring to us the player and then world is sort of referring to that environment next we're going to add in a conditional so you can make a space and put in a if as a if statement so we're now going to give these values to so we'll type in projectile here and then we'll use equal equal and now we want to specify what is the projectile that projectile that we're going to use is a craft arrow so we type in craft arrow and then we'll put a and and so here we want to give the shooter a name right we wanted to know who is the person shooting this bow and uh arrow so what we're doing now is we're going to give the shooter a name and we're going to give this shooter a name which is our minecraft name so we'll type in shooter dot name and then equal equal self dot name so sub dot name is referring to our minecraft name then we can put in this bracket and then make sure we have this here then under this we're gonna write in projectile the reason we're writing this is after we have shot it we want this ad to disappear after it's hit a target and then under this we want to say that we want a lightning to be striked so to add that we put in world dot strike ning and then put a bracket here so in here what we're going to add is projectile.location and that is where the arrow lands so we'll type in projectile dot location then we'll add it with this semicolon so so far we have added these parts so the last remaining part that we have to add is over here so here the next thing we're going to write is events dot projectile hit bracket strike let's just save it so so far this is our code and we've completed it so congratulations you have made your strike lightning mod with javascript so what we have done here we've said that if the craft arrow is being used as a projectile and the shooter is us when it lands on a specific area where we shoot it we want this air to be removed and then cause lightning and then when it's hit we want it to run a strike parameter which is this lightning over here and this function is referring to this so that's our mod so now we're going to test it out the first thing we need to do is we need to launch our minecraft and head into the server so first we type in cd desktop slash speak.mc so this in the terminal allows us to head into the spigot mc folder and to access the terminal you can just press command space and type in the terminal and then you can access this so now we're going to look at how we can open our mod and test it out in minecraft using the custom server that we have so first we're going to head to the terminal command space on your computer you type in terminal and you press enter next when this window opens we can type in cd and then desktop so cd is the short form of change directory we'd like to go inside the desktop and you could put a slash and type in spot mc so once you're there it says here speak.mc and then your username so the next part is we now want to run our server so we put in this command java space jar space spigot dash 1.10.2.jar this will help us start our server so you can press enter and it will start loading the libraries and the rest of the items as it runs so you have to give it a bit of time and once it starts loading you can test it out after it's done as it's done loading we now can open our minecraft over here so when you open minecraft please do remember that we'll be using the version 1.10.2 if you want to change your version you can click on installations here click on new give it any name you like and then just change the version from here and then click on create and that's how you can get to the older version if you have everything set up you can click on play and then click on play once again and minecraft should boot up so as the server is open what we need to do next is add in our ip address so once this opens up you can click on multiplayer and i'll remove this and i'll show you how to add in your own server so once you're here you click on add server you can give this a name mc3 server and then here for server address generally we'd recommend you to put in your ip address but here you can just type in localhost press done and then double click this so now we're going into our server and then you can see this over here it's loading once you're here you'll see that your world is loaded and for example if you don't have any items so i'll show you if it's blank you can actually give yourself items so first i would suggest slash game mode c to be in creative then once again you press slash you can use give at p p is referring to you as a player then you can press tab and it shows minecraft then you want arrows you type a r then it will show press tab again it'll complete the wording press space and you put in a number so you can put 64. it gives us 64 hours next we can put slash give at p so now that this is there we want to run so first we want to refresh the server slash js refresh slash js light new arrow this so i hope you guys had fun making that lightning arrow mod with javascript and testing it out in minecraft for more fun tutorials like this please make sure to
