hello everyone welcome to first code academy in today's video we're going to look at how we're going to make traps in minecraft so here i'm in survival mode and what and the mod that we have here is a staircase that's going up and what happens here is when your character or your friend join your server and they step on the presser plate it will move away the staircase to the other side so let's test it out so right now i'm in survival mode so let's walk to this and slowly slowly go over here oops i jump let's go again oh oh oh i fell into the lava and there's no way to escape so i die in the lab so that's how our trap works so let's begin so here what we can do first is we can add in three rows here and three empty rows here and then what we're gonna do we're gonna find our stitch piston and so first over here we can add one here and on top of this we can add in here and then what we have to do here is just well for now and what we're trying to do here is we're gonna add in some redstone so redstone powder here and here here here we're gonna add in a torch here spacing one two and then here fire and then we added some plate so in here what we can do and just break something and what we can add under this is some lava so we can press on e and here so far this um next we're going to add in some stairs so use any stairs you like i'll just use this one's over here you fall into the lava that's how our trap would work next what we'd have to do is we can just add in some coverings on the side using the iron block so this here and just add this here here we go and here then as more steps have to be added you can add a block like this over here structure here and the same can be done for this side this some steps towards here yes here here so you can add in steps here we and to cover this up you can just add this here so that's how this is made and then suppose someone doesn't know and they're walking just first clear this make sure we're in game mode survival and then once someone's talking so this is how you can make your your trap and then trick your friend thank you very much for watching this video if you liked it please make sure to like share and subscribe to first code academy on youtube for more fun filled coding tutorials see you in the next one bye bye
