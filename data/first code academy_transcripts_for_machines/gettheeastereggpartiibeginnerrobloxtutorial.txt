hello everyone welcome back to our channel here we share picking a friendly tutorial on minecraft roblox web programming and many more today we are going to take a look at part 2 of our roblox game called get the easter egg so in part one of this tutorial we learn how to design the game environment of the game which is a jungle and then we created our spawn locations and our easter egg so in this project i'll be using the code kingdom platform to make three code files one code file would be for the platforms to change colors and also to explode randomly when they turn into red the second chord file would be for the player to time how long the play is alive and also the last code would be for the a to indicate that the game is over when the player catches the easter egg so let's get started for the second part of the tutorial i'm going to the code kingdom platform so the first thing i need to do before i code is to make sure that my studio is online so how to do this is that i'll just open up roblox studio where i have my game open up and i'm going to click on plugins and i'm going to click on unlink edit option next i'm going to head back to my editor so then it will pop up a message asking for connection request from your roblox studio so i'm going to click on yes and then i'm going to click on link alright so now it is online now we can start coding in the first part of the tutorial i made a file called platform so this would be the first code file which i'll make to my platforms the green color pads to make them to turn their colors randomly so first thing is i'm going to click on make a method so i'm going to click on add method and click on on create all right so next from the code library i'm going to drag a while loop so i'm going to drag a while loop and then i'm going to change the condition of this while loop to be true so what happens is that so when they are being created it's going to check if color of the platform is red or green so i'm going to drag in a weight block and change the time to be one second so that the colors keep on changing every one second next i'm going to drag in an if then statement and change the condition to be left equals right all right so the condition is to check the colors so i'm going to make my condition to make that if the platform is red color it's going to create an explosion so i'm going to make my left side to be self color so i'm going to build a block so self color then click on place and then i'm going to choose the red color so i'm going to click on the right slot and go down under types and then you'll see an option called color 3. i'm going to click on that and choose red color next to make the platforms to be explosive i'm going to drag in the code block call create and then i'm going to change it to be explosion so that the platforms explode when they turn into red color now once they turn into red color after they explode they have to turn back to the green color so that it keeps on repeating the color change between red and green so next i'm going to under the if statement uh i'm going to drag in and equals object equals update block and place it under the explosion code block and then what i'm going to do next is on the call on the code library i'm going to find the color block and i'm going to drag in and place it inside the object and the update would be turned back into green color so when you're choosing the green color choose a green color that is similar to the green color that you have used in the roblox studio for your platforms so mine was kind of similar to a lime green color so i just choose lime green all right next i'm going to drag an else block outside the if statement but it should be above the weight block so i'm going to drag the weight block down here all right and then i'm going to place my get get an else block and then place it above my weight block like that so inside the else block i'm going to drag in an object equals update block all right so in this block i'm going to give a random type so that the platforms change colors in a random number so you sometimes you may have three green platforms that are turning into red platforms sometimes you may have only one red platform sometimes you may have five red platforms at once that has that is going to be explosive so i'm going to give my range of the number of platforms that is going to turn into red color to be between 1 to 5. so first what i'm going to do is i'm going to make a variable to keep on calculating the number of platforms that is going to be changing so i'm going to click on option and i'm going to write random number all right and then on the update slot i'm going to drag in math dot random so the minimum number of platforms that it should be changing is one and the maximum number of platforms that page that should be changing into red color should be 5 so next i need to make sure that if the random number or if the number that i have chosen is 5 then i'm going to change my platforms to be red color so what i'm going to do is i'm going to drag in if then block and i'm going to change the test to be left equals right so on the left side it's going to be random number and on the right side it should be number five next what i'm going to do is i need to change the platform's color direct so again i'm going to drag in an object equals update block and i'm going to choose color and it's going to be red color all right so now where we have finished the code for the platform so let's take a look at how to make the code file for the play all right so to create a new code file i'm going to click on plus sign and i'm going to give the file name as player and choose the option to be player and it's going to be added as a local behavior all right so this code file is going to time how long the player is alive during the game so i'm going to click on add method and choose on join option next i'm going to drag and if object equals update block place it down here so on the object side i'm going to create a field named as type so i'm going to type fill choose change it to be a field and click on number and then on the update i'm going to click on zero so next i'm going to drag in a while loop and then change the test condition to be true so while it is true i'm going to wait for one second all right so now i'm going to make another method to run my timer so i'm going to scroll down and click on add method again and this time i'm going to make a custom function called time so the timer would run only if the player is alive so we have to make an if statement to check whether the player is alive or not so i'm going to drag an f then block place it down under the timer method and i'm going to click on test and down here you'll have a variable called self.a lot so i'm going to click on that all right so till the player is alive i have to keep on counting so what i have to cut is i need to add one by one so for every second that is under the field i need to rename this as time sorry nice and i'll just drag and equals block object equals update block so i'm going to click on object and click on self.time so the self.time should be keep on updating every second by an increment of one so i'm going to click on update click on left plus right so on the left it would be self.time and on the right i'm going to add my increment which is number one next what i'm going to do is i'm going to use a set stat code block so which is going to display my timer on the game scene so i'm going to write set stack put it underneath self time equal self time done so of time plus one so here it's going to be i'm going to write as time taken which is going to be displayed on this game screen and the valley that it should be updating would be the cell time field so i'm going to click on valid and i'm going to click on self.time all right so i need to run this function timer when i join my game so what i have to do is i need to go up to the on join function and i'm going to call the timer method inside this function so on the code library you can find the timer code block so i'm going to drag this block and place it underneath my wait one second all right so we have finished the code for the player next we have to code the app i'm going to click on plus sign again and i'm going to create a new file called egg and it's object with a local behavior so i'm going to click on that option and click add so in this code we will code the egg to send a message to stop the timer when the player touches the app so i'm going to click on a method called untouched player so i'm going to send a broadcast message so i'm going to find a broadcast message from the code library let's say download that so i'm going to send a long message so i'm going to click on text and i'm going to click on left dot dot right so the on the left slot i'm going to choose string and i'm going to write you have made it the time taken colon and a space so it should display this current value that is inside the field time so i'm going to click on write and i'm going to click on build a block so i'm going to click on player dot type so and i'm going to click on place so now the time slot on the right corner would be how long are you going to display this message so i need to make sure that this message is being broadcasted for five seconds in the game screen when the player touches the a so i'm going to click on time and enter number five all right now we have finished the coding for the platforms the player and the app all right so now once we have called the files the respective files we need to make sure that the scripts are being transferred to their respective parts in the game so what i'm going to do is now i'm going to head back to my roblox studio with the game open all right so i'm going down the workspace and i'm going to click on replicated storage and i'm going to click on code kingdoms and i'm going to click on front shank all right so i have my three scripts here so i'm going to transfer the platform script to the models or the parts in my game up here so what i'm going to do is i'm going to select the platform and click on copy and then go up in my workspace and i'm going to highlight all the platforms that i have in my workspace so i'm going to hold my shift key and select all the platforms like that so that it's being selected and i'm going to right click it again and select the option card paste into selected so right now you can see that all the platforms have the script called platform all right so the next script that i need to transfer is my player so since we don't have a player model up here we have to transfer the script to this player's starter pack so what we're going to do is i'm going to click on copy this again and down in your workspace you have to find the folder called start player starter player and then i'm going to click on start a player scripts and i'm going to paste my player script and the last script that i need to transfer is my egg so i'm going to copy my code file for the egg and go up in my workspace and find where my egg part is and then i'm going to select that and click on paste into so right now i have transferred all my scripts just three scripts platform player and then the egg so that's why it's really important to rename your part so that you can easily identify your parts when you're transferring your scripts all right so we have completed transferring our scripts onto the respective parts on our game so let's head to the roblox studio and up corner and click on click so we can try out our game as you can see the timer is running and then some of these platforms are turning red and you can see that light explosion on the top so we had to be careful in order to not to go towards the platform and i i can see my egg right now all right so you can see that a message is being broadcasted and it's going to show my thought so that's all for today i hope you enjoyed this project don't forget to hit the subscribe button and like our videos also check out these two videos while you're waiting
