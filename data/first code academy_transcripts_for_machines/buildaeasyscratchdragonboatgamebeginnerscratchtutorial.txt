hello everyone welcome back to our channel here we share beginner friendly tutorials on scratch minecraft roblox and many more today we're going to be learning how to make a dragon boat the maze on scratch so let's get started all right so let's take a look at this project in this project we'll be creating a maze with four levels so you can play around and scratch with your character which is going to be our dragon over here so as you can see i'm moving around with my keyboard and as i reach the end another level comes up so let's go ahead and get started with this project so we'll start by creating an empty project on scratch all right so next what we're going to do is we're going to import the sprites that we need for our project so we're going to use a dragon face and a zhongsu so there is a link in the description below where you can download those images you can also go ahead and search if you want to use your own images online for a png of those images so i'm just going to go ahead and upload those sprites in so now that we have both of these sprites we're going to now make another spray i'm going to use my paint tool because we're going to be making the maze walls and we're going to use a rectangle too to start making our walls that we want for our maze so you can make your outline thicker and your background your fill color can be anything inside i'm going to let it be purple but you can choose to be any color that you want and then let's say i'm going to make it like this and then you can copy paste it so this is going to be my first level here and then i'm just going to rename it as level 1. now just so you know is like a traditional food that people eat during a dragon boat festival and they're like delicious rice balls that are covered in bamboo leaves they have meat peanuts and other ingredients inside of them i'm pretty sure you might have eaten them sometime in your life or even heard of them um again you can use any other image for the angle so we're going to make the tone to our goal where the dragon gets the and we switch to another level so let's first start by coding in our dragon face so that our dragon is moving so let's code our when clicked and we want it to be forever so we're gonna put a forever and we're going to put that if then condition saying that if right arrow is pressed so i'm going to find key pressed we want the change x by 10. so what this basically is going to do is whenever the right error is pressed move it to the right it's more fluid because you don't have to keep pressing on it it's gonna continue to do that forever now we want to do that for all of our keys so the left arrow the up arrow and the down arrow so what i'm going to basically do is just copy paste this and just change the values so i'm going to make this left arrow change x by minus 10 again right click duplicate make this up arrow and then since now we're going up and down to change y then duplicate and then change this to minus 10. so again we have change x for left and right and change y for up and down so now i can move up down left right and it works okay so next what we're gonna do is you want it to be sensing those walls around so that whenever we touch the walls that our dragon goes back to the beginning because we don't want the dragon to be touching those walls so we're gonna be making use of the sensing blocks again and we want to do first of all we want to create a starting point for our dragon so we're going to get our when clicked and we want to get first of all i'm going to place my dragon face up here and get a go to and we want it to be forever saying that if it touches this purple color so to get that color we're to get this touching color block first click on this color click on this eyedropper icon over here and click this purple color and you should get that color over here and again we're just going to place the go to block all right great now we also want it to switch to another level when we touch the zhongsu so we're going to get another if condition over here and saying that if it touches the tsungsu then we want to broadcast next level all right now we have this broadcasting now all we have to do is basically start to create those next levels so to do that what we're going to do is go back to our level sprite over here and in costumes we're just going to duplicate these levels and switch them around so oh we've got the spelling of level along let me just change that right great so again you can modify this level however you want let's say i want level two to be like this you can add more obstacles or anything so this is my level two and then again you want to duplicate it so this is level three so we're gonna make it level until level four you can make it however how many as you want um we'll just modify this a little bit to this side make it a little bit different all right and then another one which is just gonna be let's say this one is the most difficult one we're gonna make make sure when you make it it the it's not the gap is not too small so that the dragon face cannot go through so keep that in mind as well when you're designing your maze levels all right so i think i'm happy with my levels we have level one two three and four now all we're gonna do is we're gonna go back to our dragon and we're just gonna put it when i receive over there so when i receive next level we want it to go back to this position go to and there you have it so we have all the code done now let's go ahead and test the project so i'm going to move around and as you can see we forgot to do one more thing which is switch the costume of our levels so to do that we need to go back to our sprite and we're going to put a when clicked over here and actually you're gonna click when i receive next level and we're gonna just go to next costume so whenever the next level is broadcasted it's going to come over here and it's going to switch to the next costume let's go and try that now and as you can see we have now switched to another level there great and if you crash onto these walls you will go back to the starting point so that's all for this project let's let me just zoom in on this the codes once again so that you can take a look on what we have so we have the if conditions for up down left right to move our dragon face then we have if condition the testing to see that whenever we touch these walls we go back to the starting place or when we touch the zones we will go to the next level well where it will broadcast the next level and then in the level sprite itself whenever it receives that next level broadcast message it will switch to the next level so that's all for today hope you liked today's video don't forget to
