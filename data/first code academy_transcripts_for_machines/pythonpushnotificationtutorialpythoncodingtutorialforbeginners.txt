hi everybody welcome to first code academy this week we'll be doing a project on python called 100 years old in this project we'll be learning how to do the basic operations in python to get information process it and send it back to the user by asking how old is it and calculating how which year will it be 100 years old for this we'll be using the idle tool to code in python to begin this program the premise of it is very simple we'll have a some code that will ask what's your name what's your age like how old are you in what year were you born so with these three data we'll display at the end when are you going to turn 100 years old okay the first step in every program we have to do is collect all the information we need in order for the program to work so we'll start by collecting the name because that's the polite thing to do you ask the name first so we'll ask input what's your name i'll leave a space here the input command allows us to save any information into a variable in this case the variable is the responsible to save the name so we can use it later in the program uh the variable i called it name with a capital n input is a command for getting the name and here is the message that will display so we can ask the name uh remember we use the print command in python to display the information we have so if we try it out right now input name print name and i run the program i'll show you here what's your name my name is fernando and i just print it again okay so far so good we just asked for the name and we get the name back we'll continue coding okay of course we don't want just the name we also want to know how old our user is if we say create a variable called age and we ask how old are you okay we can leave it like this the problem is h is not a letter or i mean it's not a word it's not a string as we call it in python it is a number numbers in python especially the numbers that don't have any decimal point are called integers to convert this input into an integer we need to add the special word and and surround this command between brackets what this will do is ask for the h when we type in the number it will convert the number from letters like from the string into an integer so python can recognize that this is an actual number and not some word the same way we'll ask for what the year is the user born okay or what year is it today sorry not the year that it was born the same way because the year is a number we'll add the end and the input commands and what year is it today we'll close it both and then we'll do some operation what operation do we need to do okay this is the year that the user will be born like will be 100 years old okay if we grab this year subtracted the age of the user you will get what year the user was born so for example let's say the user is 40 and this year is the year 2000 if you grab 2 000 and take 40 away from it you get 1960 1960 so that means that the year the user was born if i grab this number and i add a hundred to it then i'll know when the user will turn a hundred years old one 1 960 plus 100 is 2060 so i can know for sure that the user will turn 100 in the year 1900 2060. of course this is the number and when i print it i don't want it to be a number i want it to be a string just like name to turn this into a string i add the special word at str and surround this entire operation with those brackets that means that i will grab that number that result and turn it into a string now that i have everything in strings the name and the year i can print it in a message okay if i want to do something like this this won't work python doesn't recognize this as we want to put it together to put them together i will have to use the concatenation operator or the plus sign this will put these strings together now if i just pin it print it like this i'll show you i just try to print it like this let's say fernando already let's make up an a an h let's make up 70 and let's say make up like one two three four it'll print it all together you see there's no space there's no formatting there's nothing like really special about this one we'll make it more pretty okay we'll make it look better instead of just printing them all together without any space without nothing i'll add another string in between these two i to use two concatenation operators and here's where i'll put the message output name let's say fernando will be 100 years old in the year and then the year they will turn 100. let's try again here fernando again let's put 50 and let's put 1 000 okay fernando will be 100 years old in the year 1050. okay effectively if you make the math yourself i was born in 950 and then i will turn 1050 in the year 100 in the year 1050. as you can see this is a pretty simple program but we have just learned how to use the basic commands of input and print how to turn numbers into strings and strings into numbers and how to display this information in the end and that's it for today thanks for watching and i hope you enjoyed this tutorial please like and subscribe and we'll see you in the next one bye
