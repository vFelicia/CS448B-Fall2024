hello everyone welcome back to our channel so here we share beginner friendly coding tutorials on scratch roblox minecraft web programming and many more and today what we're going to be doing is a fun roblox game called reach for the stars so in this project you have to touch a star circle object right there by passing through some obstacles you have to reach the star by jumping onto these platforms these really thin platforms right here in the game scene and some of these obstacles are also trapped where you will fall when you touch them and when the player touches it the star would blink in random colors so the first part of the tutorial will be game scene design in which i will teach you how to create the game environment using roblox studio and in the second part i will be teaching you how to code the project in lua so let's get started alright so let's go ahead and create our game scene open up our base plate project in roblox studio and the first thing we need to do is to change the lighting in the game scene so we want to go ahead to view and then explore and then we're going to find right here lighting which is used to make the environment look darker or brighter so to change it we want to go ahead to properties as well and we want to go ahead to time of day right now it says 8 o'clock it means 8 am in the morning this makes the environment brighter and since it runs on a 24 hour system for us to display time after 12 noon we need to go ahead and add 12 into the time so for example for 10 pm it should be written as 22 so 12 plus 10. so we will go ahead and enter 22 in time of day okay so as you can see it gives a nighttime environment next i'm going to go ahead and create the plate where the stars would appear so let me close my explorer and properties so to do that we want to go back to home click part and insert a block all right so we can also change the material to any material or color we like and we can do that right here in edit so material these are your options and color here as well so i'm going to go ahead and make material concrete and color to white and then we also want to change the size of our block so we're going to do that in properties and scroll down to size and we wanted to change it to 32 by 1 by 32 and then enter all right so you can see that it is much bigger than before we also want to make sure that we anchor it so we go back to home and click anchor and then we want to place it at a corner of the base plate so i'm just going to go ahead and put it right there okay now one more thing that we need to do is we also need to rename the part so we'll click on it and we're going to go to our explorer so you can see it's called part click on it and then rename it to one okay so we also want to duplicate this plate to create a platform with nine plates in total so we can duplicate that's two three now my my sit from seventh eight and then nine okay now we need to make sure they don't all say one so we can go go ahead and rename it so this can be right click rename to rename this to three remember four and then five all the way to nine all right so now we have nine plates in total right so we want to make sure that all of them are anchored and renamed in order okay and we need to make sure that they are spread out on the base plate and there is no specific spacing between them so you can decide how far apart uh you want them to be i'm actually going to go ahead and spread them out even more so a little bit space okay it does not have to be perfect all right now next i'm going to make the bridges that are going to connect the plate so that the player can move from one plate to another so we're gonna go back to part and we're going to choose block all right so we can start from one block and extend it to the second block right so we are gonna go ahead to make the width of the fridge so let's make it a little bit longer okay and let's go ahead and to properties and put in the size so i'm going to click on my part right here and in size i will put in let's say three make it a little bit bigger five okay as you can see it got a little bit bigger okay now we want to duplicate this bridge to create two more and connect the other two rows so we can duplicate it move it right here make it a little longer the same thing here similarly i'm going to create three more bridges that are perpendicular to the three bridges we have right now so that the e the player can easily move along to another plate so i'm going to click on one of the existing ones and go back to home and rotate it okay and i'm also going to stretch it okay so this is the very first one i'll duplicate and i have one right here one right here and one right here okay so now that i've added the uh three more bridges i'm going to go ahead and add in a star so we're going to go back to part click on sphere okay and the first thing i'm going to do is actually go to properties and change the size so i'm going to change the size to 12 by 12 by 12. i'm sorry 20 by 20 by 20. okay and since i want the star to be really bright i want to go ahead and make the material neon and i will keep the color red but you can choose any color to your liking and i will also make sure to anchor it and put it on one of the plates that are in the corner okay and then go back to our explorer and also rename this part to star okay so the reason we're anchored anchoring it is because we don't want the players to accidentally push it off one of the plates if they touch it now in the explorer again we're going to go back and right click and group the star part into a model and this will be helpful for when we code to make the star move to random position and then next i'm going to add in a spawn location to go back to home go to our tool box and add in font so i already have it right here okay so we want to put it near plate number one so that's for me it's right here plate number one also make sure to anchor it okay make sure that everything's anchored so i have to go ahead and anchor this anchor and anchor make sure everything you have is anchored it's very important because later on we are going to delete the base plate all right now we're going to add four bombs that will be some obstacles in the game and these bombs will explode when the player touches them so we want to go to part add in a block and first of all we want to change the size so we want to go back to view properties and for the size it will be 12 by 12 by 12. and material should be plastic and the color it can be anything that you like material plastic for me i'll just keep it at bread okay so i'm going to place it on any one of the plates i'm going to actually place it here and also make sure that i anchor it and the next thing is duplicating it so i want to duplicate three more i'll have one here okay and then one let's say here okay and make sure that i rename them to bomb so i'll go back to my explorer right here i have part rename it to bomb okay i need to duplicate one more to make four so let me duplicate this one and place it here and it will already be called bomb now finally i'm going to go ahead and delete the base plate to make the game more exciting and challenging so that if the player falls off the bridge or from the base from the one of the plates the player will die so we just need to go to our explorer find our base plate right here then click delete and there you have it so all right we have completed our game scene you can test the game right here to see if you can move along the bridge freely so that's all for today in the next tutorial we'll learn how to code the game in law where we'll make the star change colors when the player touches it and makes some obstacles like trap plates and also bombs now make sure to subscribe to our channel to check out the next section of this project and don't forget to hit the like button thank you bye
