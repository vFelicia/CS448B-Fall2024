hello everyone welcome back to our channel here is your beginning friendly coding tutorials on scratch roblox minecraftware programming and many more so today we are going to create a progress bar so in this project we will be creating an html page with some css and jquery called emoji analytic block the idea of the project is that we want to have a loading bar in progress while showing emoji at the same time different colors as it moves from the start to the end of the bar the webpage uses html for the text and css for your design and scrolling and jquery for the progress bar movement and animation within loading of emojis so let's get started all right so let's get go ahead and create our web page first i'm going to cope and create a custom project i'm going to uh click on the pen and then for our project we're going to name it as emoji loader okay so we're going to start the project by coding the html part first so for our html okay so first of all we're just going to add a div and division class um which is demo in this case and then like that first and then okay so in this okay we are going to create an src link uh this will link to the awesome library which we which we'll be using to add in their emojis above the loading bar of our website so script okay so like this so this will be our script like this okay so and then afterwards i'll create a division called support and inside this division create a data definition called container the container will contain some images of the emojis from the font awesome library while add5i with each class of emoji one two three and four and five you can search for these emojis in the w3 font awesome library if you want to change the emojis make sure that the dev is closed okay so afterwards we're going to create a paragraph tag with the class of support text and have the text say loading this should be placed inside the support class as well so don't close our division yet so p class equals to support text and then loading okay afterwards we can close this now create a division with a class of loader and this we have to create another division with a class of loading progress excited this referred refer to the bar um well first yeah just end it first of class perfect now we're done with our html part so we can move on to our css part okay so is that a css part so first of all we're just going to give what our body a background color of 1b 1b and 1b and a height of 1000 feet each now we are going to make the loader and the loading progress which will be the colorful bar have them use the display of flex and then align the items to the center all right so now create a demo a dot demo for the class of demo then we're going to add in a height of 500 pixels with a margin background color uh webkit box shadow most black shadow box shadow overflow for the radius and position so let's go for the demo first okay so perfect okay so now we're just going to give the loading progress a class and a height of like 40 pixels and then a border radius of 20 pixels well okay first of all let's go for the loading process uh well this part should be adjusted to flex and then we have the transition transition of all four like seven four seconds uh we also need to give this with uh to ten percent so that's why we add three more d's thanks so okay let's flex okay anyways for the loading emotion uh let's code it first now create three classes make one for excited smiling face code sweat open mouth co sweat and give each of these property a background color or you can pick any color you like or fold along the hex codes so you can just search it inside our website so you can choose whatever you like so for example excited so next we are going to create three classes make one of them a grooming phase expression last phase and then finding your face you can add any color you like here for the background color and follow or show a hex code ah this is for the bar color that will move in the progress bar as a mooji loads so after creating all of these we are going to create a class called dot support text uh this with refers to the text that says loading so okay this should be given a position of a relative and then a column point uh given left of 75 pixels and then give it the font of um monster it i don't know i'm going to pronounce that okay make sure that the font size is 25 pixels and the height of the font is 600 so okay so at this text uh we should give the line height here for five pixels and make sure we're going to add uh some spacing uh in between the letters this tech will be using animations so we're just going to give it an animation name of color change and then a duration of three seconds and then add in an animation iteration count for the infinite so that it won't stop right so now we're just going to create a css4 class of emoji one two three four five uh one two three four so then we're just going to give the position now relative and make sure that there's like a line height of 25 20 pixels and give it a left of negative 20 pixels give this a spacing of 15 pixels and then uh a height and width of 50 pixels 10 animations are given an animation name of color change and then an animation duration of three seconds and then add an animation iteration count of incident so basically it's almost like the same as the one that we did about i just like the larger numbers like what is the margin line height margin height and width like that the line and the position those are the different ones the last part of cfs in this part we're just going to create a keyframe which will help run the animation write in the color change animation type in form and then to add in the color that you would want to add then i'll close it with the semicolon sign so perfect so now with mr css part so most importantly we're just going to the gs now so inside our javascript we're going to add in a function in the javascript script which is called no name function so let's start with that first okay so there's no name function uh we're going to create four variables make one of the one for the loader progress bar loading motion and then sport text adding their location on the web page by referencing the document and then using the data syntax for the curious selector and adding in the class name now next we're just going to create a variable called emotion color and then add an array and then inside and in the class that we have earlier made in the css well as this will help us to bring the background colors that we set for the emojis so all of those complete smelling plays on cold face like open mouth whole square rinsing phase expressionless phrase like these so we're just going to add it okay now next we're just going to create a variable called emotion underscore ctr and then give it to the value of zero and i make a variable of immersion text with the third value of complete whoa and then this complete thank you for waiting emoji ending emoji so exactly just like that shirt half put it right here okay okay now uh we're just going to create a variable called motion nope we're going to cut off a variable called loading and then create a function uh and then inside this function we are going to create a variable called ctr and then give a value of 10. then create another function called and and in set interval then we are going to add a conditional to check if center is equal to 20 30 45 to 50 60 70 80 8890 and then adding emotion underscore ctrl have the value equal to the chat style change style and then adding this edit and else if ctr is equal to 100 then they will want to have it change emojis and have the english phone to be cleaved as emoji changes the support text in the hdmi to the settings motion text and then have the loaders displayed to none and then have the button display the block afterwards we're going to add in progress bar style width and then add in the value of ctrl and then a percentage assigned and add in ctr plus plus we can test timer setup 500 so let's do that okay new function ctrl 10 set interval and then f c t r equals to 20 or jesus does a lot 19 30 40 50 60 70 80 90. so 30 40 50 60 70 18. and then if there's not any of these between 20 to 90. we are just going to change our c here to 200. well if c carries with 100 basically not change it to 100 we're going to check if ctr is equal to 100 then we're just going to change our style and then we're going to clear info support text finger hdml and launcher style display one button style play block and then for our progress bar outlet ctrl and then afterwards we're just going to say that 500 for this whole thing to be at and then next we're just going to create a function change style with a parameter of ind and then add in the variable of target ind and then give it a value of id plus one then add in progress bar dot class list dot remove and then emotion color inside the parameter what this line does is actually to remove the emoji that first display and then moves to the second emoji under this addin progress dot bar.classlist.ad and then emotion color target id um and then we're going to uh what underneath or we're just going to add in the loading emotion uh the individual and then have it equal to emoji id or this response to the emoji that we have in our array then typing return target ind and after this have the function loading and run and then close this function so this is basically the last thing okay so it's actually working so you can see that that's the cool thing and then you can see that the emoji is changing so basically that's it for our project so that's it for today in this tutorial we create a web page that make use of html css and javascript to create an emoji loader which changed in color as it progressed and then displayed in the emoji at the same time make sure to subscribe our channel and don't forget to hit the like button if you like this tutorial
