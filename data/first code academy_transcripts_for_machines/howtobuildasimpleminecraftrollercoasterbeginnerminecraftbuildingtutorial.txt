hello everybody welcome back to our channel here we share beginner friendly coding tutorials on scratch roblox minecraft web programming and many more today we're going to create a roller coaster in minecraft so in this project we'll use various tools and redstone to power up our roller coaster so that it will go in the circular path as you can see we also have a hill and a downhill that can allow us to go very fast in the roller coaster okay so let's get started let's start our game by going to minecraft and click on single player in here we'll go on create new world here we can change the name of the new world i'm going to name it roller coaster now let's change the game mode from survival to creative so we can fly and use every item change the difficulty from normal to peaceful and finally go down to more world options world types and select super flat and now we're going to generate a new world and so we can click on create new world all right great so once we upload it into our game let's go to our inventory by pressing e and let's grab some items first item is going to be the oak plank and the second item is going to be the petrified uh slab so we can just go down with it and grab the oak slab next um the other items we can look it up so on the search bar we can look up rail and we can find the power rail which we'll get detector rail which we'll also use and finally the plane rail and the last item we will grab is the redstone torch so we'll grab the restaurant torch so your inventory should have six items so here we can start the roller coaster anywhere we want um here i must start from here and we're going to build a 16 block um with oak plank in a straight line so here i'm gonna go off 16 blocks from here so one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen awesome and on each side um i'm gonna expand the sides to forty blocks so here starting from here i'm gonna go 40 bucks that way so let's do this real quick awesome and we'll do the same thing on the left side here and so instead of counting i'm just going to keep going until it matches to that side um because how many blocks exactly doesn't really matter as long as the both sides are equal um that is what matters the most so here i'm gonna keep going like i said until i have reached um the same length as what i have done on the other side and here they look like they're the same length like this so here now we should go off 20 blocks on each side so here starting on this edge i'm going off on 20 blocks including this block so one and i'm gonna go ahead and do the same thing on this side and so now you can see this is the bottom part of our tee for the roller coaster and we have to finish wrapping around and making the hill the top of the tee so on each side over here we can add 20 blocks so including this we'll add 20 so one and let's go ahead and add that as well on the other side and the final step is to connect that side to here so if you have done it correctly we should just be able to go straight across and this should be perfect and should reach the edge of the other side keep going and yep there it is matches perfectly and now we have our t for the roller coaster let's continue our project by adding the rails to this project here we're going to start with a detector ram over here followed by powered rooms and here we can connect power rails all the way and at the end we can put down three around like this and the reason why we have to use normal rails because um the power rails does not turn a corner so if i put one here it does not turn smoothly for us so we have to use normal rails for the corners and then we can keep using uh power rails however we feel like and we can actually add um somewhere else in between and then finish it off with some power rails so according to you know um how fast you want the overall uh trip go you can add more um powered rooms it will make your minecart go a lot faster um the more consecutive powered rails you have here i'm just trying to make it so we can go all the way around without ever stopping so i'll add around 10 to 20 rows of um power drills and then followed by normal rails so here i'm just doing some maybe 5 to 10 just normal rails followed by 10 to 20 uh power drills and again make sure the corners are just normal and we're actually going to stop in this corner and that corner because we'll be making the hills over here so we don't have to fill out the rails yet over here let's go back to our start and um finish off the edge on this side you know we have some normal rails followed by power grips again and again um the amount of power rails um is completely personal you can add however many you see fit and again the more you put the faster your minecraft will go and the quicker you will get um around the circle and around the whole trip again just make sure that you don't put any power rails or even detector rails on the edge um on the corner because otherwise your minecart would not be able to turn so i'll use the normal rails and corners all right cool and so before we actually finish the project by doing the hills let's power these uh rails that we have here with our um restaurant torch and the slabs so whenever you're near um these power rails you can put a slab on the side and a torch right on it and you can see that the power rails will be powered when they turn red like this so you can see that these are unpowered so these are very dark red well these are powered so they have the same red as you know the restroom torch and you can also see the range of this so this is the last range uh last rail that is reached by this torch so these two are unpowered still um so let's just shift this center this i like to call battery um to the middle so that it will reach more and as you can see um you'll reach all the way to the end on the left and as well as all the way to the right which is perfect and pretty much around um the whole thing you want to do this so um you can go to the basically the middle of the power rails and add the torch so go to the middle of a section of power rails put down the slab and put on the torch and here this is actually a very long sequence of rails so i'm gonna add two torches and it's fine if you need to add two torches um as long as you make sure that all of them are powered um this should work so again um and to be safe i'm just gonna add two torches on this one as well and again i'm gonna try to put it in the middle trying to reach all of them and if all of them are shining um it doesn't matter how far they are from the restaurant torch if they're powered um they will have the same power so don't have to worry about one of them getting less power than the other because they're further so here we can go over here and see what we did as previously restaurant torch can have a power of eight blocks so if the torture place um has a range of eight blocks left and eight blocks to the right for a total of uh 17 blocks including the middle block so you have pretty much eight blocks on that side and eight blocks on this side to power and that's how you can actually calculate if you have enough room as well but yeah this is what we have so far and let's finish our project by uh making the hill so let's go on the top of t to make our heels here i'm gonna count from the side the most edge of the block and i'm gonna count three blocks in so i have one two three and here on the fourth block uh after three empty blocks i'm gonna put down the block and make this two block wide like this so this is our first step next i'm gonna add two more blocks like this creating kind of a staircase layout here i have one step and two steps and this is my second layer and then we'll make ten more or ten total layers in total um so eight more layers so one two that so there's 10 blocks like this um with a total of 20 blocks so here we have one two three four five six seven eight nine ten so we have gone up 10 blocks and let's do that um the same thing on this side so let's count off three blocks so one two three and then fourth at this two block white staircase and then and now let's connect the uh top platform together and if you did it correctly they should both be the same height on each side so you can just run across and they should connect perfectly and here um for the staircase um we want to add all power rails because it's very hard to go uphill um so here we're going to add our power rails and then in between we can add all rails again here you can change it up if you want um for us we're just gonna make it so the user have to go across the bridge um pretty much across the hill by himself uh if you guys do not want to do that you can definitely add some power rails in between here just to make sure um to power it with a slab and a restaurant torch on it so here i'm gonna have power rails again going down and all right and to power this we'll be doing the same thing as over here so on any of these blocks um that are actually hosting the railroad so not these black uh back ones just put down a slab on these and put a torch down and as you can see they're powered again and you can see the range um these are already powered um so adding this will not actually do anything so we don't have to add that actually so let's go on here and um add some torch as well and you know i'm actually gonna add um some power rows here just so i don't have to um you know press w the whole time you get across because when there's no power um and you're on rails you can actually move the card forward by pressing w um however it is very slow and try not be too fond of a roller coaster ride for people all right so here we actually have the whole course for the roller coaster done and to finish a project we can actually take away all of these items as we don't need them anymore now we can look up our carts so we can look up cards pick up our first my card as well as pick up some fences so let's type in fence and let's type in oak fence and before i go on my joyride i'm gonna have fences one block apart from the trail one block apart like this so that you know it prevents uh safety progressions people can't get into the roller coaster while it's happening and um yeah you just keep uh the mobs away as well so they can't touch with our uh our cool roller coaster so here all right and so now as you can see i've surrounded the whole game and hold a roller coaster with fences and here i'm going to look up uh fence gates so here we can just replace one of these with a gate now we can open and go in next put a minecart down enter it by rightclicking and then press w in one of the direction and you should start to uh be able to go around without pressing any buttons so here my hands are off the keyboard and i am just enjoying this fun rollercoaster ride that i have made for myself all of these trails of these rails should be powered um that's also very important because nonpower rails will actually stop the dead in the track um so you actually instantly stop as soon as you get to an unpowered rail so that's all for today in today's project we learned how to make a roller coaster ride in minecraft using oak wood planks upward slabs power rails detector rails normal rails and minecraft redstone torch we also learned some design techniques to create an elevated track i hope you guys enjoyed don't forget to subscribe to our channel and
