hello everyone welcome back to our channel here we share beginnerfriendly coding tutorials on scratch roblox minecraft with programming and many more so today we are going to create a roblox project called cross the bridge this is an interesting adventure game where you have to cross a poisonous river alright you need to cross it through the bridge it is not easy to walk along the bridge as there are obstacles such as holes then you see this laser trap all right oopsies all right how about if i restart this again this project will be in two parts in which first we're going to create the game scene we're going to design it first and then the second part will be the coding part all right let's try to cross this lasers first whoops and then i arrive in a hut yay all right so let's get started so we are going to create a new project on roblox studio after launching the app let's click new and then let's choose baseplate first we're going to make the pool of poison water click on the home button and click on editor then generate you will be given options on the left side of the screen now let's go down a little bit okay now let's unclick everything and click the biomes over here except water so we need water over here and then let's make the bio size into 100 and then let's click generate next click on view and open explorer explorer should be this one all right it's in the right side part and under the workspace do you see base plate all right now let's delete the base plate okay so we have water over here next we want you to change the color of the water of your choice now let's click on properties all right it's over here and let's choose the terran over here in the explorer part choose terran now we can change the watercolor you can always go for purple if you cannot think of anything next let's move the spawn location to the edge of the water all right let's use move and we're going to move it to the edge of the water alright so now it's already in the edge of the water make sure that it's above the water now we'll add a bridge by adding a block from the home top right we're at home right now and let's add a block over here this part all right now let's move it a little bit move it a bit closer to the spawn location nice now let's set the material to boot here material and then let's choose wood all right now let's change the color into brow alright and then set the size okay over here go down and the properties go down in the size let's change it into 6 comma 1 comma 50 all right so it will be really long let's adjust it first okay don't forget that you need to anchor the bridge as well don't forget to rename the part name into bridge right now we're going to create a holes and a bridge all right so to create the holes let's add five spheres on the bridge over here home part and choose fear okay and let's adjust it you can just easily duplicate it but before duplicating it how about let's put it put it down here make it intersect with the bridge itself so you have it like this then what you can do is you can duplicate it all the time right click duplicate and then move it and then you can right click duplicate move it again duplicate move it again duplicate then move it again so you have five over here now what we need to do let's use the select tool and in the explorer let's let's press the part and let's hold shift and then press this part so we can select everything that we have then let's go to model do you see solid modeling over here okay this part is the negate let's create the negate over here so it'll be a negative part okay now the last thing that we need to do we need to hold shift again on the negative part and then press bridge so we can select everything including the bridge after that let's let's press the unit over here which will create holes all right see that's creating holes over here so actually the holes are to trick the players into falling through them so if they are not wide enough you can just always adjust the bridge by using the scale tool next we will create a middle ground that acts as a buffer for players now let's go to the edge of the bridge now let's add a block over here let's change the materials and the color that you like anything basically anything but make sure that the size is 15 1 15. all right now let's go to the property select the part select the buffer i'm going to select the buffer then adjust it a little bit and let's look for the size okay the size we're going to change it into 15 comma 1 comma 15. okay let's adjust it a little bit more then you can change the materials and also the colors and don't forget that you need to anchor it now we're going to create the next bridge okay so the next bridge will be slightly more challenging as it would include bombs the second bridge will have the same property as the first all right so how about let's create a part yep adjust it and then we're going to change the material into boot and the color into brow and make sure that you have the size of 6 a6 1 and 50. you can always adjust it don't forget that you need to anchor it again and rename it into bridge after creating the bridge how about let's create the bombs now now on the bridge we're going to add a part and then we're going to scale it a bit smaller and then we're going to change this into neon we're going to change the material to neon and then we're going to change the color into red don't forget that we're going to rename it as bob now what we need to do is we can duplicate it in each side we will add three of it duplicate and then move it duplicate again and then move it again let's do it for the right part also duplicate it and then move it duplicate it and then move it again duplicate it and then move it again now for the last part let's design our bowl over here i want to add a hut from the toolbox all right and i'll look something that will suit that is suitable for this case all right i'm going to add a vietnam hut on water all right then i'm going to adjust it or maybe i can just rotate it maybe it'll be better okay you can use the rotate tool yep this will be better okay this is better all right feel free to add signs or messages of your choice you can really add anything that you like all right now i'm going to try to play it first let's see if everything works properly alright so this is how my bridge looks all right okay and it has neons but it it's not working right now and i already have my design go over here all right so this is how the project will work so that's all for the game design of this project hope you like this video don't forget to subscribe and like our videos also check out these two other videos here while you're waiting for the next video thank you and see
