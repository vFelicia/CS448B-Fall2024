hello everyone welcome back to our youtube channel here we should begin friendly coding tutorials in scratch roblox minecraft web programming and many more in today's scenario we will learn how to create our own music player using python in this project i will teach you how to use thinker and other library to make a music player so you can have your personalized design to play your favorite music so when i click on in this file i have this play when i click the play button it will just go into playroom so you know when i stopped it i'm just going to stop when i click play again click and then pause and then so pause hope you're interested so let's get started we are going to start by opening our terminal first uh well if it's like windows uh you can open prompt but um it's macbook pro for me so i'm going to use terminal so inside the terminal there's only one commander you have to type which is like installing this like python game library into our system so what i'm going to type is pip install py game and basically that's it so since i've already previously installed this into my library so that's why i don't have to like uh wait for it so yeah afterwards we can start moving on to our python idol so we're going to use the following libraries to work with our project so your import python game this one is for media is to create video games and the next one the tinker stkr this is for developing the gui which is the user interface and then the third one tinker dot file dialog ask directory this is to permit to select our different directory and then the next one is input os it permits us to interact with the operating system so basically that's it okay well again if you like this video so far don't forget to subscribe and like our videos so next we're going to close the windows uh of our program uh we're going to add any title that we want and we're going to set up the size of the window as well so in this case um we'll say player tkr tk and then player oh sorry title to music player using player geometry close to 500 500 okay perfect so we're going to set up music file i will start by using asking like the ask directory function so this function well after this inserting this directory we can actually use the uh chdir which is just child directory directory to allow your os to switch directory to the one where the music file is so nope like that so now we're going to create a variable sound list soundlist is a variable which will store all of our files inside the news directory we are in so make sure you put all your favorite songs in the same directory so some less os okay now we're going to display all the tracks in the photo by using before after creating a list box select any setting you want for the list box and then use the form glue to insert all of these elements into playlist so play this equals to tkl list box so music player font i'm going to set my phone to for dana 12. and then f g fold navy and background done okay and then for the for loop we're going to create a new variable called x equals 0 x equals x equals 0 and then 4 i in so let's we're going to playlist insert x and then i and then x one so like that perfect okay now we can write these two instructions to allow the python game to play some music so neat and then py game mixer dot like that these two okay well afterwards we're going to set up some functions so that we can use the buttons to play so there's like four buttons play stop pause and pause so i'm going to create all these rows deaf play and then inside the play button well obviously we're just going to play the selected uh music uh inside our file so that's why py pyking mixer music load get reactive like that and then far set play this get to hero active and then py key mix mixer music play okay finish up play button now for the wow it's really very easy for you to stop and then pause so we just like stop pausing plus functions like that stop like mixer see mixer music oops music pause yeah and pause so then pause that so we finish all the buttons we're going to define the buttons our own preferred settings make sure to add the text to what the user know what the button is supposed to do and use the command to link the buttons to the desired actions so in this case one that's it music player equals five okay i'm going to change copy and paste this three more times since we have four buttons so and then change this to two with height stop three now we're going to use a variable to display the title of the song i usually think like so far again bar and then title tkr label music we are okay finally we are going to display the buttons we need to pack the instructions for the buttons so song title pack and then then same for the other buttons okay so here after we created all these buttons fill this we're just going to pack our fingers as well so and that means like player loop okay now we are actually done we can do this um well this is just a template you can change the size and then you can change the buttons or design whatever you like uh in your own style um so let's try it out right now so i'm going to share another screen so when i click f5 let's see what's happening so you can see that it just pops up this directory so when i click desktop music choose then when i click one of them and then stop and then when i play again and pause and pause pause and pause so basically that's it for our g so that's all for today hope you liked this video and don't forget to subscribe and like this video as well also while you're waiting
