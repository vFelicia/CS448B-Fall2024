hello everyone welcome to first code academy today we are going to make a simple web page animation using css called sunny day driving in the sunny day driving project we will animate a calm that drive towards the right of the webpage and when our mouse hovers over the sun it will expand by completing this project you will learn how to create animations in css using app keyframes method for this project i'll be using the codepen platform which is a social development environment that is used for front end designing and deploying websites in this platform we can create web pages using html css and javascript and also get the realtime privilege so let's start with our project first i'm going to write my html code for the web page in my first section of the web page it will hold me the pictures of my car and the sun to create a section on the webpage i'm going to use the html tag called dip this section is identified by an id called skype next i'm going to add the pictures of my car and the sun you may find the links for the images in the description box below i'm going to get the image tag i'm going to give a link to the image this would be my car so in order to identify that i'm going to write an id ah and then on then i'm going to close my image tab next i'm going to add my son to my webpage so i'm going to write html tag for image a source for the sun image in order to identify this image i'm going to give an id called sun alt and then i'm going to close the image tab next i'm going to close this section so i'm going to close with a closing test tag my next section would be my ground so i'm going to create tip id which i'm going to close awesome now we have done with our html section let's head on to the css all right so now we are going to use css to make our webpage more beautify and then give the animation methods so i'm going to create the skype i'm going to give a height of 200 pixels and i'm going to give color the background in cyan color next i'm going to give my position to be relative all right so next i'm going to give the appearance for my graph where my car drives along here i'm going to give the height for my brow and then i'm going to color the ground in green color all right so now once we have made the sky underground we are going to change the appearance of our sun and the cup first i'm going to change the appearance of the sun where i'm going to move the sun to the right corner of the web page and then i'm going to transform it to be a little bit smaller so i'm going to write sun and i'm going to give the position of it to be absolute next i'm going to change the position of it to be at the right side next i'm going to make the sun element to be 0.5 times the size it was before so i'm going to use transform and then scale same goes for the cup so i'm going to change the position of it to be absolute and then change size of it to be 0.7 times the size it was before and then i'm going to place my car at the very left corner of my webpage so i'm going to do a little modification to the car element i'm going to write the element i'm going to write positions which is going to be absolute so next i'm going to place it in between the sky and the crown right top pixels all right to create the moving effect of my car i'm going to add the animation property into my car element so i'm going to write animation name right next i'm going to give how long my animation should be running animation duration i'm going to make it five seconds next i'm going to give the loop count for my animation so animation so i'm going to make my card to drag towards the right hand side wherever while i'm seeing my webpage so i'm going to give the property value to be in finale to run my animation i'm going to use the act keypad rule so down below i'm going to write add keyframes next i'm going to call the name of my animation which is drive so next i'm going to state how my animation should be running that is by decline to and from i'm going to write from left close to right you should move 65 so from zero pixels to the final frame so my final frame should be sixtyfive percent from the current left position so last i'm gonna do at 65 now we have completed the css code for our car element next we are going to see how we can expand our sun element whenever we move our mouse on top of it so we are going to add a server code selected to the sun element called hover which will trigger your element to be expanded whenever you move your mouse so i'm going to write sun element and i'm going to add the server code selected call hub next to expand your sun i'm going to use the property called transpo transform and scale one all right now we have completed the css code for the car element and the sun element now you can see that the car is moving towards the right side of the webpage and when we hover the sun with our cursor it would expand now it's a sunny day driving so that's all for today
