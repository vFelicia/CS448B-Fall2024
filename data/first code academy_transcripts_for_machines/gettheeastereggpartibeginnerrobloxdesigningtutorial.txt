hello everyone welcome back to our channel here we share beginner friendly tutorials on roblox minecraft web programming and many more so today we are going to make a roblox a sticky so in this project i'll be teaching you on how to make a roblox game called get the ace to a in this game the players would start at one end of the jungle the goal of the game is to get the egg that is inside a bucket which is placed at the other end of the jungle to get the easter egg the player have to run through the jungle but there are some obstacles that are placed inside the jungle such as the green pads these green pads in the jungle would explode when they turn red another feature of this game would be a time which displays how long the player takes to reach the easter egg the first part of the tutorial would be game design scene in which i'll be teaching you on how to design a jungle on roblox studio in the second part of the tutorial i'll be teaching you on how to code the explosive green pads using code kingdoms so let's get started alright so let's go ahead and create our game scene first i'm going to code kingdoms to create a custom game so i'm going to click on the custom game option here and i'm going to rename my file as east egg egg and i'm going to click on an empty base plate and click on start so inside this game i'm going to create a file which is going to be called as platform so i'm going to type platform with a capital p and this is going to be an object and i'm going to click on the local behavior option all right so now once i have made my file next i'm going to download this project so i can open it up on the roblox studio to start designing my game scene i'm going to click on download structure next i'm going to open up roblox studio and open up the downloaded project i'm going to click on file click on open from file then you can go to download and select the project that you have downloaded all right so as you can see it's an empty baseplate where i'm going to design my game scene which is a forest so start off i'm going to create the ground of the forest so i'm going to click on part and click on block next i'm going to change the material of this part to be grass and i'm going to give a green color so that it looks more like a grilled grass next i'm going to use scale and then stretch it so that it's going to cover the whole base plate so you can go up on your wheel the camera view and then stretch it so next i'm going to anchor it and then i'm going to lock it so that this ground or this part doesn't move around so i'm going to click on lock next what i'm going to add is my small location so i'm going to go up in my camera view so i'm going to place my spawn location at one corner here so that my basket would be the basket with the egg would be on this corner it's on the opposite side of the jungle so i'm going to click on toolbox and i'm going to find a spawn location and i'm going to add a spawn location so to find out where my spawn location is i'm going to go up and i'm going to place it at one end of the jungle like this all right so i'm going to add a basket at the opposite end of the jungle so using the same toolbox i can choose a basket or a bucket that i can use so there are different types of baskets or packets you can use to make your game but since it's the project is about easter i'm going to choose a basket that is related to easter team and i'm going to download some baskets with the egg so i'm going to choose a basket without an egg so you can go down scroll down okay i found one that's this one so i'm going to choose that so you can see there's no egg which is great because i'm going to make an egg later on and i'm going to place my egg at the opposite corner so you can place it at anywhere so when i zoom out you can see that the basket is really teeny tiny the spawn location is at this corner and the easter egg is at this corner all right so i'm going to go down to the easter egg there are some slight adjustments that i had to make all right so the next thing i'm going to do is i'm going to make the basket to be a little bit bigger so i'm going to click on scale click on the basket and i'm going to choose the green knob so that i'm going to increase the height of the basket like this so make sure that it's not too big or not too small also so so that it can hold an egg but it's not too big for the player to jump inside it which makes the game to be more difficult so you can always try this out to see if size of the basket is okay or not so all you have to do is you can click on play okay so as you can see the basket is too big so you can just it's really hard for me to jump up oh i can't jump so if it is okay for your height you can just jump up like this make sure that you can jump in so because we're going to place the egg inside the basket all right so there are some adjustments i have to make i'll just make the basket to be anchored also so it doesn't like wobble around on the game scene next i need to add my easter egg so to add your insta egg i'm going to choose part and i'm going to choose a spear next i'm going to change the material of this is the egg to be plastic i'm going to make this egg to be a vibrant colored egg so i'm going to change the color to be a maybe blue color so if you want to make the egg bigger you can click on scale and make it slightly bigger but not too big so that it doesn't fit on the basket so i'm going to click on move and i'm going to move the egg inside the basket and place it inside like that all right all right so next once i have my egg like this i'm going to rename this x so i'm going to click on view explorer and i'm going to rename this part as egg so egg with the capital e all right so next what i'm going to do is i'm going to create my explosive green parts and i'm going to place them at random places in my gain environment so to make this clean pass i'm going to choose a cylinder part i'm going to click on part and i'm going to choose on cylinder all right so now the cylinder i need to make it kind of like a platform green pad so what i'm going to do is i'm going to scale this first make it a little bit like this and then increase the height of it like this all right that is using scale now to make it like into a platform i'm going to rotate it so i'm going to click on rotate and i'm going to rotate it along the blue axis like that now i have a platform the height of this platform is stupid so what i'm going to do is i'm going to flatten this cylinder so i'm going to choose scale again and i'm going to flatten it by using the red knob here so it can be a thin platform with a small height like this so i'm going to make it a little bit more wider like that i can choose so when i go up on the camera view i can see my platform much more better it's better if you have like a wider platform but it should not be to the height of the platform should not be too big so that's why i made the height of the platform to be small while i make the width of it to be longer i'm going to change the color so that it's going to be a little bit different from the egg so i'm going to choose it to be green color now if you're choosing green color we have to make sure that it's in a different shade of green than your graph so that it's it can be identified more easily so next what i'm going to do is i'm going to rename this part as platform i'm going to write flat form like that with a capital p so that is one platform so to make it more interesting i'm going to copy this platform and then place it at random places so i'm going to copy 20 platforms i can click on copy paste and then i can place it at random places so i'm good one two all right so i have 20 explosive green pads so right now they're not explosive but once they turn into red color at random times they would be explosive so right now i have it's almost halfway done so the next thing is to design my forest so what i'm going to do is i'm going to click on toolbox and i'm going to choose some trees to make my little jungle or the forest i'm going to type forest and there are lots of models which you can use to make your own jungle or your forest environment so i'm going to choose on tree forest so i'm going to choose this one i get a bunch of trees at one point so i can place them at random points it's fine if the green pads are covering or if the trees are covering the green pads so that it makes it more fun so i'm going to keep on adding more trees so i'm going to click on tree first again and so you can always rotate and see if it is to your liking the game design if not your always free to change it all right so in a forest we have different kinds of trees so i'm going to choose another tree model so and add more trees yeah it's kind of like on top so i just need to bring them to the ground so zoom in whenever you need and then choose the move button to bring them or place them onto the ground yep that's more like it okay so now what we're going to do is so other than trees we do have some rocks some bushes so i'm going to choose on rocks this time and i'm going to click on the rock model wow it's so small so if it's too small you can make it use on scale make it big so that it makes one big rock and then again choose on move and then move your rock to the place that you need it all right now i have some rocks some trees now that you can see that there are some parts of the environment is a bit empty so what i'm going to do is i'm going to add more trees so let me find some trees so you can add more models like lakes or maybe pushes or maybe other things that you can find in a forest to make it more realistic so again i'm going to add more trees so make sure that it's not too crowded also so that your player can move around in your game scene all right so we have completed the game scene so you can test out if you want to see if if your trees or your rocks or any other models that you have used are in the place that you want and you can try it i'm going to click on play so if there are any adjustments that you need to be done you can always stop the game and then adjust them or if you feel like you have to add more models you can also do that so let's take a look around so i have my crease here yeah so there are some slight adjustments i have to do where my trees are above the ground so we have to take note of that all right so it seems okay so there are some adjustments so i'll just stop the game and yeah so the trees here were slightly above the ground so i can zoom in into the game scene like that and then can click on move and then come down like okay all right yeah that should be okay so be creative and design your own custom forest for this game by choosing any of the models that are related to a forest so that's all for today in the next tutorial we'll be learning how to code the platforms to change colors and also to make them explosive when they turn red make sure to subscribe to our channel to check out the part 2 of this tutorial and don't forget to hit the like button thank you bye
