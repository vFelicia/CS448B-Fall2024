hello everyone welcome to first code academy today we're going to be making a project called the animated clock with the use of html and css so these two things are a part of web programming and in this project we're going to be making the use of the animation property of css to create this animated clock and the main part of this project is we're going to have a rotating hand which is the hour and then the second rotating hand which is for the minute and we're going to have that rotate just as how it does on a clock so let's begin with our project so now we're going to begin our project so here we have animated clock starter code this link will be provided to you in the description on our youtube video right now we're going to look at the code and explore what it does what it means and then we're going to add in our own code for the animation so here we have a div id of clock and inside this clock we have another div called seconds under that we have a div called minutes and then under that we have a div called hours so inside seconds we have an image inside minutes we have another image and inside ours we have another image so let's look at what are these images so as we can see here we have the clock and there's the second hand as you scroll down you'll see the minute hand and as you scroll down you'll see the hour hand next what we'd like to do is we want to look at our css so here we can see that the image and height are 100 percent we've given a clock a background of curry we've given it an image but the gray background is not used as the image is a bit different of a clock with the timing then we have a height and a width we've given a background a sizing and then we've added a position so now we're going to begin our code the first thing we'd like to complete is we want to look at how we can add in all the hands to be positioned just like how it is on a clock so before we begin we want to just add this semicolon here click save and then we want to click on fork so fork will have this saved to your account and you'll create a copy so once that's done here you want to click on enter and then we're going to type in seconds hashtag minutes hashtag hours so with the user hashtag we're calling in these ids so the next thing we want to do is we want to give it a position of absolute we want to give it a no spacing on the top so we give it 0 left we give it zero next we want to give it a height and width so we give it a height of 800 percent and same goes for the width here so as you see everything is aligned and in place so for the next part we want to create the animation and how we do that in css is we use something called keyframes so we're going to put the act key frames and then type your rotate and then add in our curly brackets so the next thing we're going to add is a 100 percent so what this tells us is that we're telling the css that the whole time we wanted to just do this animation from start to finish and then here we're going to put in our curly bracket and type in transform so this is known as a animation property and transform what we're going to use is rotate as we want the hands to turn around in a whole circle and to turn it in a whole circle we use 360 degrees so we're going to type in bracket first and then put it through date and then here i'm going to add in and this and then we put in this bracket here three six zero degrees and put in the semicolon here right so we've added that let me click on our save so make sure for this part there is just one bracket and then we have this over here all right so the next part is we want to have these hands rotate so make sure you click on save so we're going to call out the first one which is ours and we type animation and here we will use the animation name of rotate and we want it to rotate for 12 hours so in order to do that we change this number from hours to seconds so we put four three two then seconds then we want it to run continuously so we type in infinite and then we want it to run linear so we type in linear here and we have added hours the next part we're going to code is our minutes so we type in minutes over here type in animation and then type in the animation name and then here we want it to rotate for specific amount of minutes so we're going to put 3600 seconds and then once again infinite linear then we want to work on the seconds so we do the same thing type in seconds animation rotate and put 60 seconds infinite linear so then we click save and now you should see your clock will start animating so the second hand is moving very quickly here and then slowly what should follow is the minute hand so let's look at that so once this makes a complete turn p minute hand should have moved for one minute let's see how it goes nice it made one turn so now you can see that the minute hand moved forward so this is the end of our project i hope you had fun i hope you guys had fun watching the video and i hope you guys had fun making the project if you like this video please make sure to like it please make sure to share this video and also subscribe to our channel thank you very much see you next time bye bye
