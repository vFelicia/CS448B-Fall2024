hello everyone so today in our tutorial we're going to be making a potion in m creator and this potion will be a chinese new year potion what that means is we will add two portion superpowers to our portion and it will activate when it's applied and the next thing would be that we'd add a picture that is related to chinese new year for the icon of our potion we're going to begin making our potion in minecraft first please make sure you open m creator and to start we can click on this plus over here and then after you click the plus as you move we will see the potion option and you click on that and then here it asks you to enter a name for the portion here we can just call this c and y potion and then click on create new potions so as we've already added the name next we need to pick a color so click on this three dots and choose a color this is chinese new year you can find a color that is sort of reddish so i might pick this one over here little lightest darkest red and then here we have potion icon now with the potion icon this means what will your potions picture look like so you can click on this plus and here if you have an image already saved on your computer you can save it so i have this of a aux so i'll click on open and then here since it's already existing in my computer i can click on cancel and just click on here and click on this if it's not there you can click on plus and then add in the image and then click open so remember your image should be a dot png file something as in jpg or jpeg would not work so make sure that the file extension is dot png after that's done here then all of these options you can leave it alone for now then we can click on triggers once you click on triggers is where you can run a procedure under a certain circumstance so these circumstances over are over here and if we're not going to be using this for now click on save once that's done we can move on to making the procedures so we can click on plus and then we can move all the way here and click on procedure and then you can call this c and y position or you can just call this c n y and click create new procedure so as we're here this is where we do the coding part of our project so click on entity management and as you scroll down you will see this block add potion with level one four sixty ticks to event and type so you can drag this out and then just with your keyboard you can press command or control c and then duplicate it by pressing ctrl or command v once that's done we can look at our code and see how we can modify so here it says apply with level one for 60 ticks to entity so this entity is us as in our character and 60 ticks is a very short while in minecraft so to increase the potion effect for a longer time we'd have to change these sticks so you can change this to this amount and we can change this here to this amount too so what happens is effectively we're trying to make this potion effect lasts almost forever and then here we have type so in type is where you can choose your portion effect so i am going to add in regeneration that would mean it would regenerate my health and the type i would change this to water breathing so this will help me to breathe underwater so once these two things are there we can click on save mod element once that's done we have our potion and we have our procedure we go back to our potion and click back on triggers so here under these situations we can run a procedure so as we made a procedure just now called cny what we can do is when the potion is started slash applied so in this situation we want to apply our effects from our portion so click on cny then click on save mod element so you can click back once again just to check and make sure that it's there then we click on save after that's done we can click on the play option here and we can head to our console and wait for it to load his minecraft is loaded now we can move our mouse click on single player and then here we can delete this then we can create a new world make sure you change it to create it click create now that our world has loaded we can explore and the first thing we can do is we can click on e so once you click on e you can click on search items you can type in cny so notice our portion is over here just drag it here and press escape so we have this potion and as we're in creative our health is full and we're able to survive under the water as long as we want so to test this out properly click on t put a slash type in game mode and then survive so here what we have is our health bar and we have our hunger bar in order to apply this potion click on right click and then consume this potion so you can now see on the screen there is the aux design from our image that we uploaded and then we have the health and water breathing potion activated so now we can actually test this out by heading to the water so let's do that let's find some area with water and apply it and see how this works so what's supposed to happen is that you should be able to breathe underwater as long as you want you should not reduce in health or ability to breathe so let's test this out let's go and you will see right now that i'm underwater but my health is not decreasing neither is the water bottle so it allows me to effectively go under water and stay for as long as i want and not lose any help with this so if i press on the e you can see that i have my cn1 position i have this water breathing effect and i have regeneration go back and as you there you go we have applied our potion
