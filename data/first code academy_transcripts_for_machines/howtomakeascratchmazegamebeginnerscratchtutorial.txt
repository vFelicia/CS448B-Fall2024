hi everyone and welcome back to our channel here we share beginnerfriendly tutorials on scratch roblox minecraft web programming and many more and today we're going to create a scratch maze game we're going to create an easy maze game in scratch called save the water and the idea is that we have a water droplet that has to reach the cup in a certain amount of time and we can move it around when we collect the green flag and we can solve the mate but when we hit a wall the water droplet will go back to the starting position so we would have to start again and this is the idea of the game first of all we're going to create a new project in scratch this website is available at scratch.mit.edu and when you enter this you're going to see a main page like that and we're going to click the create button and create a new project this will be loading for a couple of seconds but should be very quick okay so we are already in the application we have a blank project right now we're going to delete the first sprite that is the default sprite that is already here because we're not going to need that for this game so click the delete button and we have a completely blank project first we will need to create the mace and to do this let's go to back groups and when we go to backrooms we have several tools available and we're going to choose the line to draw the mace so we use the line exactly like in paint or other graphics editors we can first make a big rectangle let's leave a little bit of space here the design can be all yours so you can easily change the position of the lines if you really want to remember that the space between the lines has to be big enough for our droplets to fit in so don't make it too narrow so i think that would be my maze if we already have a backdrop like this um we need to add our sprites so our characters our players so to do this we need to go to the lower left corner there will be a button called choose a sprite when you hover over it it will become green like that and it will say just a spray and there are a couple of ways to do it but we're going to go with the first one so the top one and it's called upload sprite because we're going to upload it from images that we already have downloaded um the download links for both sprites are going to be in the description for this video so don't forget to check out the description and download the sprites and also if you like the video so far don't forget to subscribe to our channel and we have a couple of videos already so um don't forget to check them out as well so if we click this upload sprite we will have a menu with our file system basically and so we're going to click the water droplet and there we are going to click the water cup choose a sprite don't click choose the sprite go to the top and choose upload sprite again and this will be the water cup sprite good so so far we have both the water cup and the water droplet but there is one slight problem they are very large so we need to make them smaller and we can do it by clicking on the size text box deleting the size and typing another so for me it's going to be 20. okay and right now you can move them around and as you can probably see they both fit in so so far so good and at this point the design should be already done so the next step will be to actually code the game and to do this we're going to go to click on the water droplet first here we need to have it saved and here we have to have a drawing of the water droplet in the corner of the of the white page that means we're assigning the code to the droplet and we're going to create our code so the first step would be coding the controls because we need to be able to move the water droplet around and to do this we're going to use the second event which originally is called when space key is pressed but we're going to change that for when arrow is pressed so for example when up arrow key is pressed and then we go to motion and for the motion we change y by 10 so we go 10 upwards 10 pixels upwards and then we can copy and paste it and change it to the opposite so when down arrow key is pressed we change y by 10 and the same thing will happen with with the x direction so with going left or right when right arrow key is pressed we're going to change x by 10 and as you can probably imagine when the left arrow key is pressed we're going to change x by 10 so this will be our control system and if you click your arrows on your keyboard you will probably realize that it is already working okay cool so right now we need to create a system for losing or winning the game so let's say we lose when we hit a wall in the maze and winning will be reaching the cup of water so we go to events and then we select when green or flack is clicked that will be the start of our game and when the game starts we need to go to the starting position so we go to motion once again and there will be a block called go to x and y and both x and y are going to be numbers so this should be the upper left corner let's try minus one nine eight and plus one to two okay sounds about right so we start not touching anything we start in the corner and then we will have to have a loop that goes on forever because the game oh it goes on until you win or lose so we have a look that goes on forever and then we have two conditions one for winning and one for losing okay so we put two if statements and the first one would be if we hit a wall so there is something called a sensing panel um and then we're going to use it for wall detection but how to find the color that the wall is in we click the color here and then there is a an icon at the bottom we click it and then we hover over our wall and it will automatically choose the color that we want black would be easy to choose manually but some colors are really difficult to choose using those three parameters so this is a very useful tool okay and then if we lose we need to go to the starting position and start again so the block will already remember our position so we just drag and drop it go to x and y okay now what will be the condition for ending if we win it will be reaching the the water cup so we go to sensing again but this time we select the first um the first condition so we go here and we drag and drop here um and it right now it says if touching mouse pointer but we're not going to go with the mouse pointer we're going to change it to watercolor so if it's touching the watercolor then we're going to say a message so say something that indicates that we have one so we can say i won and it will hop it will just um hover over um the water cup and the water droplet for two seconds and then we can say we saved water okay that would be um just a simple message for us right now we need to have an additional thing happening when we lose why because sometimes we will lose in a different way so we will have to add something called a timer because we want to make the game more exciting and you remember that there was this timing running uh time running out um when we played the game at the very beginning so we're going to create a timer for our game to make it more exciting and the player should reach the water cup within 30 seconds and if they don't then we have lost the game basically and we're going to make the following code for the stage so we go to the stage page clicking on the lower right corner and we're going to start with an event when green flag is clicked and we will create a variable called a timer okay so we set this timer to 30 at the very beginning and then we wait one second so we go to control wait one seconds and then it goes on forever we will change the timer by 1 and this means it will go like 30 29 28 27 and then we will wait one second again because it will have to be it will have to depend on real seconds then we have again an if block for ending everything when timer equals zero so we go to operators and select the equality one so this will be that one and then we go to variables and select the round timer one and then we change the number to zero and this means we have already run out of time so if we have line out of time then we will broadcast a message and let's say it's going to be a new message and we name it lost okay so we broadcast that we have already lost and every other sprite will catch that message so then we are going to stop everything as well um let's go to control and let's stop the game if we have lost and then again over here we can go back to the water droplet and when we receive the lost message so events when i receive lost the game should end as well and we should also say a message so we can say instead of i1 we can say oh no um we have wasted a drop led okay so this would be the message that we will see when we this so this should be um the project already completed so this is all of the code that we're going to use and and let's click on the green flag to start our game and see if it really works or not okay so you see the time is running down and you can play and make the water droplet reach the cup and if you do so it will go back to um to the initial position and if you hit the wall it will also go back to the initial position but this time you have lost and so it's showing you a message that you have wasted droplet so um that's it for today hope you liked
