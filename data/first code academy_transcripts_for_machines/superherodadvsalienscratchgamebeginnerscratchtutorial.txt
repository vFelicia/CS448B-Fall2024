hello everyone welcome back to our channel here asia beginner friendly coding tutorials on scratch minecraft web programming and many more today we are going to take a look at a fun squash game called super dad father's day is a day of honoring fatherhood and this special day falls on the month of june fathers are superheroes in disguise so in this tutorial we'll be creating a fun game in which a superhero dad has to avoid the aliens that block his path to home the superhero dad will lose a life every time when he touched an alien you'll get only 60 seconds to make sure that the superhero tag survives in the game so let's get started alright so i have opened up an empty scratch project so you can find scratch on by heading onto scratch.mit.edu and i have deleted my default cat spray all right so the first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to add four backdrops so one of this backdrop is going to be my title backdrop the second one would be my game screen in which my game would be running and the third one would be a losing screen in which it will pop up when i lost the game that means if i touched my aliens and lost all my life the screen would be popping up and the other background would be the winning screen so if i managed to make my superhero dad to safely return home within the 60 minute time without losing any of my lives then i would win the game so i'm going to add my four backdrops so you can choose any of the backdrops that you prefer you can add in custom backdrops or use the backdrops that you can find on your scratch library so i'm going to choose for backdrop so all right now i'm going to rename all these backdrops into the backdrops that i have mentioned so ringing my backdrops would help me to identify which backdrops should i use while i cook now i'm going to add my surprise for this game i need 6 sprites choose price would be the superhero dead one is going to be the flying superhero dad and the other one is going to be the superhero dad but welcomes your screen next would be two aliens and the other one would be a button which is called the play button and the last one is the hearts so i'm going to add my sprites so from the library i can find my heart my alien so i'm going to choose a nano and i'm going to choose terra so this would be my aliens and next i'm going to add my button all right so next i'm going to add in my human surprise which is the superhero that now the superheroes that sprite you can't find on the scratch library so what we have to do is we have to upload our own custom spread so i'm going to click on the cat icon and click on upload sprite now i'm going to upload this price which i have downloaded over the web so you can find the link to download this price in the description box below alright so i here i have my superhero that's bright so one is the flying dad and the other one is a super dad so i'll be using the super dad sprite first which is going to welcome our player and the flying that will be used on the game so now i need to adjust the sizes of some of these fries so for the heart i'm going to place it up here and i'm going to give the size of 20. now i'm going to change the size to 50 and also terra and i'm going to place them on the right corner so i'm going to change the button a little bit so i need to add the text called play so i'm going to the costumes of the button and choose the editor to write a text called play alright so i'm going to start now so i'm going to the stage first and i'm going to drag in the event block so when the green flag is clicked i should start on my first screen which is my title screen when the green flag is clicked i'm going to switch to the title screen next i'm going to use a broadcast block which will tell all my surprise that the game has started and also will let my stage to be changed into my backdrop the game screen alright the message game start is broadcasted by the button play but i'm going to do it on the stage first so i'm going to drag in when i receive message one block and add in a new message called in start then i'm going to switch my backdrop to be game screen so now i'm going to do what happens in the beginning so i'm going to choose my surprise so in the beginning it's my play and my super dad should be shown so i'm going to the super dad sprite and i'm going to drag when the green flag is clicked i'm going to drag in the show block i'm going to use the same block so that my super dad will come to my player and maybe give a little bit of instructions on how to play the game so i'm going to drag a block and all right so what my super dad would be saying in the beginning would be hi i'm silver dad i'm flying back home after battle in mass but dara aliens blocking my path avoid hitting the aliens for 60 seconds press on the play button if you are ready good luck so you can give any message that you like so that your super dad would speak out when the game is starting next i'm going to do the play button so when the green flag is clicked i'll be showing the green button the play button and then i'm going to drag in the event block when the sprite is clay then it's going to send the message call or broadcast a message for gamestop i'm going to drag in the broadcast block and make sure that the game is game stuff so once the button broadcast the message for gamestar so super dad should be headed all right so head to your super dad sprite and i'm going to drag in the black hole when i receive game start i'm going to hide alright now let's head to your stage all right and now once the games is on my game screen i need to run my timer so i'm going to set up a variable so i'm going to make a variable that is called time and i'm going to drag in the block all set time to be so i'm going to give my game 60 seconds next um i need to make sure that my time starts from 60 and start on reducing until it reaches to zero so i'm going to try again after a block drag in wait second so every second it's going to change the volume inside my time variable minus 1 and once the time is equal to 0 i should change my backdrop to be my winning screen so i'm going to drag in a conditional and to make my conditional statement i'm going to drag in an equals block so what is going to be equal so if the current value inside my time variable is equal to zero so i'm going to drag time equal to zero i'm going to broadcast a message so i'm going to try again broadcast and the message would be when now once the message called win is broadcasted by the state to sprites and also to the stage itself it should change its backdrop to the winning screen alright so that's to win what about losing so same so i'm going to drag in another when i receive block and this time i'm going to change the new message to be game lost now this message is sent out by the hearts but we'll be taking a look at it later but on the stage i'm going to make the message for when i receive game loss the backdrops it should be changed to the listing screen and i need to make sure that all the sprites are stopped and when the screen changes to the losing screen oh when you stop the game so i'm going to grab go to control and drag in the structural block all right so this would be the code for my stage okay so we have some other sprites that should be working so i'm going to the super dad sprite now the super dark sprite is this sprite that welcomes you so and i'm going to make sure that the super dad is on the left corner a little bit so that is not um overlapping the play button so in order to make sure that the super dad is on this place i'm going to drag the go to x block and put it under my green flag so another instance where the sub attack would be shown would be when we lose the game or when we win the game all right so i'm going to drag in my event blocks so when i receive games law um my super dad would be saying all right so on the game off screen this epidemic is going to say oh no we lost click on the green flag to start the game again but when the super dad hears or receives the message for when it's going to say we won i reached home safely good job all right now what we're going to do is we're going to design our two backdrops the winning backdrop and the losing backdrop so click on stage and go to backdrops so on the losing screen i would add my text call okay and then on my winning screen i would write the text you want all right so next i need to hide my button the play button once it broadcasts the game stuff so i'm going to locks and i'm going to drag in the black hole hi all right so now i'm going to build up my code for the main sprite in the game screen which is the flying tag so let's head to the flying deck all right so in the beginning that means when the green flag is clicked this sprite should be hidden so i'm going to drag in the height lock all right next once i receive the game start message from the button i need to show my flying that on the left side of my screen so i'm going to drag in the block on when i receive make sure that the message is game start all the message that you get from the button and i'm going to drag in go to xny and next i'm going to drag in the show vlog now i'm going to use a costume change in my flying dad it gives the effect that this spread is actually flanked so if you go to the costumes you can see that there is a slime movement or a slight change in the costume of your cape down here if you notice it you like here so i'm going to the code all right so i'm going to drag in a forever block and i'm going to try again next costume and the costume would be changing every 0.2 0.3 i'm going to go with 0.3 all right so next i'm going to code my key controls of my flying deck so this would happen in my game screen so i'm going to drag in the block call when the backdrop switches to game screen i'm going to add in my keys so to know which key that the player have used so that is the up down left and right arrow keys i'm going to sense my keys so i'm going to drag for a block and use conditionals to check if my player or if the user have clicked or pressed on a certain key so if you go to sensing and i'm going to drag in key up arrow so when i click on my up arrow key i should change my y the y position i'm going to change one by ten so i'll just duplicate this block and for the down arrow i'll just make it to be minus 10 so that it comes down because the y coordinates are responsible for the up and down position to make sure that the flying that sprite can go forward or come backward i'm going to use my left and right arrow keys so again i'm going to add in a conditional block and my condition would be to sense the right arrow key so for the left and right it would be the x position so i'm going to change drag in the block call change x by 10. and for the right arrow i'm going to make it minus 10 so right is going to be a positive 10 and then left would be negative and then next i'm going to drag in a conditional block all right so in this one i'm going to add in the statement that if the superman or if the flying that sprite is touching either the camera alien or the nano alien it's going to broadcast a message called lost life which is going to hurt by the heart sprite so i'm going to drag in operators and i'm going to drag in the o block so it is either the touching the terra or the nano so to sense whether i'm touching another sprite in scratch we do have a sensing block called touching mouse pointer i'm going to drag in one and put it inside and insert the o block and change it to be camera and on the other side i'm going to make it nano if so next i'm going to make a variable which counts my number of lives so i'm going to make a variable that is called lives all right and then i'm going to change the lives by minus one all right so i'm not going to show my live favorite variable on the screen so i'm going to untick it and then i'm going to broadcast a message called lost life so drag in the broadcast message and make a new message called lost life so this message is heard by your heart strike next i need to give in the last two events for the flying that what happens when it changes the backdrop to the winning or the loosened print so i'm not going to show my flying that sprite because i'm already having another super dad sprite show so i'm going to drag in when i won the backdrop switches to losing screen i'm going to hide and i'll just duplicate the same block and change the screen name to be winning so in both losing and winning screen i'm going to hide my flying deck all right so i have to do a little bit of change for my super dad so i need to show them first on the game loss so when i receive game loss i'm going to show so that it will pop up otherwise it will not show because in the game start screen i'm making it disappear again for the windscreen i need to drag in show block all right so let's do our aliens now so for the alien all right so i'm going to do for one and then later on i can duplicate the same code for the next area so when the green flag is clicked i should hide my alien so i'm going to drag in when the green flag is clicked i'm going to hide now the other backdrops where the alien would be hidden would be the winning screen and also the losing screen so i'm going to try again when the backdrop switches to losing screen it's going to be hide and also in the winning screen it's going to be hidden all right so the only backdrop where you would see your alien would be the game screen so i'm going to add the event when the backdrop switches to the game screen now what i'm going to do here is i'm going to build a code in which it will spawn my aliens on the right side of the screen at different heights so the height would be 150 the range to minus 150 and then it'll keep on moving towards the left side until it touches the flank stands right or the left edge of the screen and then if the alien touches the flying dad then it's going to hatch so then it can respawn back on the right side so this action happens forever until the timer is equal to zero so i'm going to drag a forever block and then drag a show block so i need to make sure that the alien is being appeared on the game screen and then i'm going to motion and grab a go to x and y block so the x is going to be same but i'm going to change the y to be a random number so i'm going to set my range to be 150 to minus 150 so it's going to spawn my aliens at different y position or different heights next i'm going to drag another loop block which is called repeat until so on here i'm going to set up my condition so in order to do that i'm going to drag into all blocks and then good sensing so the things i need to sense is the flying dad and the edge and then i'm going to drag in the mu 10 steps long now if i kept it to be moved 10 steps then it's going to go to the right side but that's not what we want we know we need to go to the left side so in order to make sure that it goes to the left side i'm going to give the minus symbol so make it minus 10. and then i'm going to drag in an if statement so here the condition would be if i touch flying down i'm going to hide now you might wonder why do i have two touching flying cats can't i bring this height block up here now the reason because repeat until is a loop so if i bring my height block up here then it means that my alien would move 10 steps and height so it'll move only 10 steps it will not go further than that because it's being hidden so that's why i'm going to put them into statements or two code blocks so one is going to be my loop so it keeps on going 10 steps just left side and until it reaches the flying dead or touches the edge and if it touches the flying edge wall it moves towards the left side the alien is going to be hit or disappear all right so i'm going to drag and drop the same code and put it into my other area all right so now we are going to our last sprite which is the hearts all right so in this game i'm going to have three halves so right now i have only one heart so i'm going to duplicate the spring so heart two and heart three so i'm going to rearrange so that heart one is going to be here part two here and heart three all right so the first half that would be lost in the game would be hard three okay so again the hearts would be not shown in the beginning so i'm going to drag when the green flag is clicked i'm going to hide and next when the backdrop switches to the game screen it's going to set up my life variable to be three so set likes to be three because i have only three hearts and then i'm going to set up my position of my third heart so drag in go to x and y block and then drag in the show block so that you can see your third huh next to make sure that a heart is disappeared it will get a message called lost life which is from the flying deck once it touches an area so i'm going to drag in the even block call when i receive lost life i'm going to check whether if my variable is changed so and the flying that we have given the instructions that it will change the or reduce the value inside the lives variable so if it is two so i'm going to drag and conditional block and check the lines variable so if the like is two then i'm going to hide the third heart now the next heart that would be reduced after the third heart would be the second half i'm going to the second half and build the code so in the beginning as usual is hidden so when the green flag is playing i'm going to drag in the height block and when it's on the game screen i'm going to set up my position so since it's this is the first part that is going to be reduced i don't need to set my variable back to 2 because it will be auto updated so i'll just add in my position to go to x and y and drag in the show block all right so once i've received the message called lost life again the player would on the player code it will reduce the or update your life variable value so i need to check whether it is one because i already have three in the beginning and if i lose one it's going to be two now for the second half it's going to be 1. so if the volume inside is going to be equal to 1 then it's going to high so that i have only one heart left now the last one would be the first heart now i'm going to do some repetition of the two so when the green flag is clicked i'm going to hide and when the backdrop switches to the game screen i'm going to the set the position and i'm going to drag in the show block and then lastly if it receives the game last night and if the value inside it or inside the light variable is equal to zero so one is here the last heart should be zero so if life variable is equal to zero i'm going to hide and then i'm going to broadcast a message so the last heart is responsible to broadcast the message to all the sprites and to the stage that the game is over so i'm going to drag again go to events so we already made a broadcast message on the stage once we did the stage so i'm going to drag in the broadcast message and put in the block called game lost all right so let's take a look at the codes and then we can start the game so this would be the code for the stage this would be the code for the play button this would be the code for the flying dan this would be the code for the alien my nano alien and the terra alien they all have the same code blocks and this would be the code block for my flying dad which is the main sprite in my game and then my hearts starting from part three three two one we're starting from part three then start part two and finally the hot one the last half all right so we have completed our scratch super dad game so let's try it out so that's all for today i hope you enjoyed this project don't forget to subscribe and like our videos also check out these other two videos here while we are waiting for
