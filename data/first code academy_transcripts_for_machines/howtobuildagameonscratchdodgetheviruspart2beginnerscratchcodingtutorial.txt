so if you guys remember last few sessions we did this project that is related to the coronavirus situation as well that we want ourselves to eat more vitamin which is orange and dodge away from the virus and each time the monkey eats the orange we gain some points and then each time the virus hit the monkey you see so yeah we lose one score and if you guys like on my project you would be able to see the remix button as well and because this is already my project I don't see the remix button there and what I'll do is to go inside and I want to make some adjustment to this project and so I think the adjustment that I'm gonna make is to simply have an additional source of vitamin such that my monkey could be healthier and let's do that so let's say this additional feature of our game is whenever we press the spacebar an apple would appear on the screen so just so just now what I did perfectly was click on choose the sprites at the bottom right corner and this will pop up and yeah basically I am choosing the Apple it could be a banana or other things as well so so yeah you can see the sprite is here and what we want to do is to simply go back to the orange so remember the orange is already kind of doing what we want the apple to do which is to move from the left side of the screen all the way to the right hand side and after they after it hits the edge of the wall off the screen it will come back to the left side and then go all the way again and every time the orange hit the monkey the score goes up by five so it's pretty much what we want except that this time we're not asking the Apple to change to start moving with space but we want the Apple to start moving closer so we want we don't want the Apple to start moving with a green flag but we want the Apple to start moving with the same Sparky so what we want to do just now I quickly did was to click a duplicate function and I'm going to drop that into Apple okay so the duplicate function is slightly problematic sometimes but just have to do it a few times yeah you can see that here also kind of like has to duplicate it here so now that I have this one you can see that this is a forever block and has the Apple every time it goes to X axes of 206 which is kind of on the lefthand side and and then pick a random Y coordinates between 120 and 120 caustic 120 which is basically the whole vertical axis of the screen and you want to repeat this until either you touch the edge of the screen or touch the monkey and so every like until you touch the edge of the monkey you want to keep on changing the xcoordinate of Apple buys to me and that is meaning that okay we want the Apple to move to the right hand side three units of xcoordinate each step and every time we touch the monkey we will change this quarter by five and we could actually change this into maybe the Apple is four powerful than orange then we can just change it okay let's make it like 10 and then maybe because it's more powerful we will make it harder to catch and which means that we want the xaxis to actually change faster so a little bit faster speed so you might wonder okay well now that I have added the Apple there why is it not changing well that's because there's no offense block yet right so we need an event block to update the apples to trigger the Apple to move so this time remember our goal was to trigger our Apple to move whenever we have whenever we have press the spacebar and so I have gone into the events block and chose this block called space key press and that's it so we just need to snap that into the forever block you'll hear a snapping sound normally and let's see how that goes so I'm gonna start the game I'll stop the game first and press this and let me press now the spacebar okay seems like I'm this is working pretty well it's moving faster for sure faster than the orange and also faster than the virus and let's see if my score is going up the way I wanted okay yeah I went from 104 to I won four and looks pretty good and the only thing that I would not like I feel like we could change this is let's go back to here right so do you see this that like the when I stop the game and restart it the Apple is just here and it's kind of like not moving until I press the spacebar but then if I don't press the spacebar ever the Apple is just lingering here and it doesn't make a lot of sense so what we can do is to first make the Apple invisible by pressing here so if you see here I would just choose this the invisible sign and so nicely that the Apple is disappearing whenever we start the game that at least there is no Apple and it's kind of like the secret weapon that we can call out with a space bar key and so now is press a space well now that I press the space key I need some way to ask the Apple to show up so luckily scratch has made it really easy for us and all we need to do is to click into the looks drawer and choose the show block so here is we're programming the Apple sprite that whenever we press the spacebar we wanted to show we want the Apple to show up there we go so I press the spacebar and right away the app will show up yep so this is a much better implementation of the game that we are able to first hide the Apple and then only if we press the spacebar this Apple will show up but the only thing that you can see here is that now that I've played the game once because the Apple has shown up on the screen it's not disappearing even if I remove even if I press the red stop button and if I press the green flag again it again is stuck there so it's not great and what we need to do is to add an additional block to ask the game to every time we start the game the Apple needs to hide itself so how we will do it is to go inside our defense block and again find our green flag block and this time we don't want to use the show block but we want to use the hide block so the hide block is basically the opposite of show and it basically tell scratch that we are going to hide our Apple every time we start the game and only if I press the space key that the Apple would show up and let's see if that works okay so now I have to stop the game I've stopped the game and I am pressing the bread pressing the green flag and there we go so the Apple is nicely hidden now I just have this simple game with our orange and virus just looks really nice and clean and all we need to do is to then now press the spacebar and boom our Apple is now showing up and moving along nicely and I'm gonna pause this video like this stop this game and test it again and see if I press the green flag does the Apple disappear again okay so the answer is yes would have successfully implemented this project level 2 so this game is where we're implementing the version 2 of this game so just to recap what we did was starting with this simple project of the orange and the virus and now we wanted to add an apple to our game that only appear if we press the green before I press the spacebar key and the beauty of this is that we have duplicated the blocks from the orange orange sprite and drag that into the apples rights and the only thing that has changed from the orange and the apple sprite is the offense Bob is changed from the green flag to play King to the spacebar pressing so here is the main difference and we quickly also realize that the Apple has been around for the entire time and even if we stop the project if we stop the game and we haven't press the space key yet it's still keep on showing up and that's not great so we decided to first make our Apple disappear here so it's by default invisible and every time we press the space key we will ask the Apple to show up using the looks block here and afterwards we also realized that after the States after the Apple show up it doesn't disappear with our game stopping so we then finally added this final block to ask the Apple to hide itself every time we start the game and we use we did that by the by using the offense block of green black dot click and also using the looks block of hiding the Apple that we did today is a version number two of our eat the vitamins project and we added our Apple and learned how to use the event block to help us control the appearance and disappearance of the Apple
