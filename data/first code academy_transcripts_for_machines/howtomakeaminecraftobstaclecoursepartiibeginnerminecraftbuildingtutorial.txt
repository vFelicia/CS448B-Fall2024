hello everybody and welcome back to the channel here we share beginnerfriendly tutorials on minecraft roblox scratch web programming and many more for today's project i'll be designing a game using minecraft redstone using minecraft redstone will allow us to design circuits and many different contractions that activate automatically this video is the second part of the obstacle course so let's get started in this second half of the project we'll design two more traps the first trap consists of a parkour map with a flying arrow obstacle here this rain of arrows uh when the liver is turned on we'll start firing arrows and the objective of the game is to have the user jump across without getting hit by the arrows the second obstacle uh we provide a ladder for the use to climb up and once the user has climbed up um you can see that there's a slime block six blocks away and the objective is to jump and hit the slab block and land on the uh target square and if you miss you get you know thrown to lava or you just die from fall damage so um let's begin so we're gonna open up the same minecraft world that we made for our first part of the obstacle course so that we can continue to add on our other two obstacles so let's continue let's start by making the reign of arrows obstacle to begin we want to have a concrete blocks for me i'm using stone and what we want to do is place down 12 blocks side by side so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 eight nine ten eleven twelve so we start by placing twelve blocks like this each side we want to place down three blocks um alternating so i'm going to place that one block leave an air another block and another block and um sorry for actually mining this we don't have to do that and we'll do the same thing on the left side so here we're gonna put one block leave for space put down a block leave the space and put down another block like this so now we should have one block one space one block one space one block two spaces one block one space one block one space and one block just like that now we should grab dispensers so here i'm gonna take out my this my pistons type in dispensers and i'm gonna put the dispensers now where the blocks have two blocks long so every one of these six spots i'll put down the dispensers like this this is going to be the wall that we're going to have shooting arrows if you like this video so far don't forget to subscribe and like our videos continuing from what we have started let's have three blocks and the glass are just for reference so i'm gonna put down four blocks like this so that i have four block of space and here i'm gonna put down our obstacle course where our opponent or our and here i'll put down our path where our player will actually trying to parkour here we can have blocks like this and i'm just gonna make them jump through blocks randomly like so and the goal of the game is to have the user jump across without getting hit by the arrow and knocked off now i want to build another five box away so i'm gonna build five glass blocks for reference and here i'm going to start putting down the wall the wall be a 4x2 and on top of it i'll put them three more blocks like this now i need to grab a lever so i'm going to grab sorry liver now put it right here and behind this block where the liver lies i want to put down the redstone torch and if i turn off the lever you can see the torch would turn off and i turn it on the torch turn back on next i actually want to build a little platform here so we can actually do our um redstone circuits so similar to what we did here i'm gonna put three blocks like this and here we will be doing the same restaurant contractions so here i'll put down the restroom repeater press some dust across and first stone repeater back and you see this circuit has started and if you turn the liver off the circuits turn off turn it back on and it will turn back on the final step to this project is to connect the circuit to the back of the dispensers so i would do that by digging a hole underneath so the user cannot see um where the restrooms are going so here i'm gonna put down the block bring the restaurant down now start mining and for reference i'm gonna go over here to the other side where i want the rest to come out of and now i take a hole three blocks down and i start digging across until i reach the hole i've made and it is important to note that redstone dust does not carry the signal forever so we should put down a restroom repeater every now and then to refresh the power like so and now we can bring this redstone dust up back here and another redstone repeater and now on the last part is to connect it with our dispensers and we can just do that by placing restaurant dust on top of the blocks that's connected to the dispensaries and now if i just grab arrows from any places and i put some of them here you can see that there arrows are shooting automatically and it will shoot for every one of these and if i turn off the deliver they will stop so we can continue actually putting the arrows in our inventory and i'm just gonna throw the arrows down on the floor so that i can pick them up later and then fill it up so here let me put 60 i'm gonna try and put 64 arrows in every one of these okay and to end this obstacle course let's add some lava on the floor so when the users are knocked off they will actually get burned here we can add some spots where every now and then we can have lava blocks like so so now let's start the game by pressing deliver and we can see the arrows are flying up like this and the goal of the game to jump across without getting hit by the arrows next we're going to make our final obstacle called a leap of faith for this project we will need to build up and um the heights can theories but we recommend between 12 blocks to 16 so here i have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 and you can go higher if you want but 12 bucks is i'm going for now we should use that ladder and make sure we put a ladder on every block so the user can successfully climb up next i'm gonna grab another glass block for reference and i'm also gonna grab a slime ball here we want to have the slime ball uh slime blocks around six to five six to seven blocks away so here we can put six glass blocks for this line and slime blocks if you land on it does not take um any fall damage from the user so the goal of the game is for the user to climb up through the ladder jump on top of the slime blocks and bounce to the destinations so here we can see that if i miss i won't hit anything but if i balance it if i hit it i'll drop bounce back up and we can make the final platform like this and i'm gonna put a red one here signaling that this is the final target like so and again i'm gonna make this game a little bit more interesting by putting lava around our optical targets so here i'm gonna take holes around this landing pad and i'll fill it up with lava and yeah and this is the game of our final obstacle so user can jump and climb up and they can try to jump land on the platform and win our game so that is all for today i hope you guys enjoyed don't forget to subscribe to our
