everyone so welcome to first code academy my name is sid so today we're going to look at how we're going to make a new year's resolution list for the year of 2020 with the use of html css and js and this is all tied into web programming so the three things we'll learn today is a bit of html a bit of css and some js and we'll learn how to make a ordered list in html so we're going to have a look at our project and then we're going to begin with it this is our project and this is what it looks like i've added some javascript and at the start it's asked me what is your name so i'm going to click on this and i'm going to type in my name once i've done that i'm going to click on ok so with the use of javascript once again it says welcome to my new year's resolution website and then it says my name then i click on ok and what i have here is my new year's resolution website for the year of 2021. i've added a header then i've added a smaller header here and what i've done here is i've added a list now there are ordered and unordered lists and for this exercise we're going to use a ordered list and the difference is that there is numberings on the side of each item in this list at the end i've added a image which is technically a gif and on the side i've added a border with some style and to top it off i've given it a background color and i've also added custom font which we will learn how to use from google so now let's begin our project to start please head to codepen and log into your account and to start we're going to click on pen over here so we're gonna type in our project name here we're gonna type in 2021 new year's resolutions and here we have the html we have the css and the js now the html is the text part of the web page css is where you want to add some coloring some styling and js is where you bring the web page to life to begin our project we will start by entering the html tags so this and type in our ending tags so remember there's always a starting and ending tag next we want to add in a body tag this is where the chunk of our content is going to be and this is where you want to place everything inside the body part of your page that's in the middle and then we want to add in a header to add in a header we use a h tag so you can use a h1 you can type in my new year's resolutions and then you add in your closing h1 tag and then you have a header now on your page next we can add in a paragraph just saying that for the year of 2021 these are the resolutions that i so we've added a starting paragraph tag and an ending paragraph tag and then added the content inside there so we've added so far a header and a paragraph next we want to add in a list now in html there are two ways of adding lists you can use a ol tag that is for a ordered list where each list item will have a number or you can use a ul that's an unordered list where the each item doesn't have a number you'll just see a bullet point but as we're making new year's resolutions for the new year we want to put our resolutions as a priority so we want to list them in the list with a number so to begin we'll start by adding the ol tag so this is the ordered list tag but once you have this tag and you type in something say i type in hello world you'll notice that it's just comes printed out and then if i type in hello mars it just is printed out next to it but if we want to add in items we actually need to add in another tag so i'm going to show you what this tag is this tag is called a li in other words you can call this a list item and this is when we want to enter a item inside our list so for the first one i'm going to say eat more fruits that will be my first item in my list of my resolutions the second thing i want to write is exercise daily all right oops mater spelling mistake next i put another li tag so we've already added two items in our resolution we're gonna add in the third one so the third one will be learn python for me so i hope you guys are writing in your resolutions i'm curious to see what you guys would like to achieve for the year of 2021 and then i want to add in a fourth item to my list so i put in another li tag so the html understands that whenever you put an ally tag inside your ordered list it knows that this is the next item that's needed and it will add the appropriate number to this list so now i'm going to write in learn web development and then i can add in another item here and i can say play more basketball there so i've added five items to my list using the li tag and all inside a ordered list to end this i would like to add an image of 2021 and to do that i add in a image source tag so we will do this after the ending tag of ordered list as we don't want it to become we don't want it to be shoved together so image source equal sign this and then just add in this tag so there's no need to put a closing image tag we just close it by using this next we can just head to google images here and we can type in 2021 and then if you want an image you can use an image if you want a gif you can use a gif i will be using hit then i will use this here and then i will right click it and copy the image address head back to here and paste it inside so once i've pasted it an image should load now this is why the css comes in handy now i don't want this image to be so big so what do i do i type in my image tag and then i give it a height of 200 pixels and a width of maybe 300 pixels so it makes the image smaller and it changes its height width as i've given the property of it and the value next i'd like to add a border maybe i can use five pixels double and red so double the styling red is the color and you can notice the styling over here if i were to change this to maybe 15 the styling will be a bit thicker but i will just leave it at five so that's the html part with a bit of css now on top of this say if we want to make this a little more colorful we can actually start by giving this a background color so to make use of the whole page and we want to select the whole page we can use the body tag in css and here we can give it a background color of say orange for now and you can always change this using rgb or hex code values and then you can give the font a color of white if you like or if you want red either way is up to you you can pick any color you like so i'll just leave it at black here and now say for example you want a different font so we can go here type in google fonts and just click on this so you can find a font that you like so i'm just gonna search quicksand i'll use this and then i will stick to this style so we select this style now to import this we click on import over here and we just copy paste this what this does is it imports the font from google font into our project so just place this here and the next thing is i need to just specify this in the css as i would like to change the font so here and you can see that my font has changed over here if you want to change the background color to something other than orange you can always go to the rgb color picker and here you can just move this over here and pick so say you want something like this you have hex values here and you have rgb values here so say i want to use this sort of green i can just copy this x value over here go back to my project and i can remove this over here just paste that and it turns green and you can change the color to whatever you like and then you can change the font color too that can be just changed by using color and then you can go back over here and say you would like a specific reddish color like this you could copy paste this here and just close it with a semicolon and there you have this reddish font and if you still feel the color is not great you can just play around with the colors say i go for light blue i'll change this here it's a bit more readable and if you don't like it at all you can just remove the color tag yourself here and then it'll just be set to black so we have this so far so we've added html and css now if we want to add some js we can just move this here and on codepen you can click on settings and then click on behavior then you can turn this off and this off for now as when you type in the js code it will automatically run it that's why we turn them off to have a run option to check our code if it works what we can do now is we can create a variable and call it name and then put equal and then we use the prompt keyword so prompt is used in javascript to ask a question so in a bracket and i'll ask you what is your name question mark and then end it with a semicolon the next thing i'd like to do is i'd like to actually greet this person to my new year's resolution website what i can do here is i can type in alert and right welcome to my new year's resolution website and then you can put a plus here and then you can add this another plus and then here you can type in the variable name and then you can save your project so what we have done here is we've created a variable called name and prompt is used to ask a question so it asks what is your name so it asks what's your name and then that information is stored inside name so when alert is used to give you a popup it'll say welcome to my new year's resolution website then i've added this here to give it a space and then it'll say our name so let's try it on let's click on run so it says what is your name i'm going to type in slurp so welcome back to my new year's resolution website siddharth so that's how the javascript works so congratulations you've made your new year's resolution website with the use of html css and javascript thank you for watching i hope you guys had fun making the project i can't wait to see what you've made and please make sure you like comment share this video and also subscribe to first code academy see ya
