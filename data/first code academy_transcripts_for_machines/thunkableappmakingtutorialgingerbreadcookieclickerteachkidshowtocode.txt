hello everybody welcome to first code academy and today we're going to do a tutorial on thunkable called gingerbread cookie clicker so in this project i will be using thunkable to create an app that will allow me to play a christmas version of the game cookie clicker in the game cookie clicker the objective is to bake as many cookies as you can by tapping the little cookie men so i'm tapping here and i'm getting every one cookie every time i tap it you'll see that there's two extra buttons the upgrade button which allows me to purchase and upgrade to get more cookies per click and the save button which allows me to save my progress so if i close the app and i open it again i will retrieve the same values you can find the link to the thunkable page in the description down below now let's go into coding it so today we're gonna divide the process of making the app into two steps the first step we're gonna design how the app looks and in the second step we're gonna build the blocks for the app to work so let's go straight into the first step we open a new thunkable project i already named it cookie clicker i'm gonna do is make it resemble what i just showed you before so the first thing is we want it to be christmas themed so i'm gonna change the colors to some red and some green so i'm gonna use red for the background and i'm gonna use green for the letters and the buttons now the most important part well besides the christmas message i'm gonna put a label over here i'm also gonna need an image to put the cookie inside so i scroll down here all the way to image and i can add it down here you'll see that in this case the image shows above the label you can actually change the order here by dragging them and whichever is at the bottom is the one that's going to show at the bottom of the screen i'm going to proceed by adding another label down here which is the one that is going to tell me how many cookies i have all the same i want it down here so i'm gonna put it here and two buttons one next to the other now if i try to put the buttons just like this bottom one and bottom two for example and i'm gonna drag it down for example well i have a button here i have a label that i don't need so i'm just gonna delete this one but yes i want to delete that one i want another button here you see that the buttons are one on top of the other and there's a really a simple way to just tell thunkable hey i want you to be one next to the other one because they try to keep things simple and just put objects in a straight line down there but they to fix this in layouts they have something called rows and columns just like a table so if you put objects in a row it will put them one next to your horizontally if you put objects in a column it will group them vertically so i want just to group them horizontally i'll just just add a rover here i'm gonna put it down here and to make them belong to the row i can just drag them in a way that is inside you'll see that there's a red little border next to where it says row here that means that i'm putting the button inside the row i'm going to do the same but i put it below here so you put it one next to the other now you see that my row is way too big it occupies almost all of the screen i'm going to change the height here and put an absolute size of 150 of course you can change that depending on what you want you can put 100 and you will adjust it differently now for the labels well i'm going to change the texts of course here merry christmas and here remember we sent the message you have baked zero cookies because of course you haven't played yet so there's no cookies baked for the image down here i looked for a gingerbread man image png download the one you like the most i use png because they have no background so when i put it down here let's see i already have it in my computer so when i put the cookie here see what usually would look white it still looks red because i have no background so it just copies the same color as my background now for the merry christmas message i can go to advanced and change the text style i can change here the color i'm gonna put a dark green i'm gonna make sure to remember this color maybe here it's gonna copy this code and use that code to change the color of this one as well so i can put here and paste that color in the hex file the same as with the button i can go back to simple i think this one is easier here oh wait sorry not the test color the background color i can put here and this one as well and i want let's say a different style for the merry christmas message i want to make it more more good looking i can put in the fun family here in advanced i can choose different fonts which fonts can i choose well you can go to the documentation for thunkable and you'll see a list of all the fonts available unfortunate unfortunately for android there's not many fonts for ios there's a huge list of phones and since i'm testing my app in ios i thought that i could use this font over here the last one sapphino i like how it looks it gives like a very holiday by and i can make it bigger with font size and i'm gonna put it bold i can even put something more old like 300 or maybe 500 okay and yeah that's it i'm gonna put this one as well bold i can just do it in simple here font weight bold all right oh of course i i still need to change the text of my buttons so here i'll put upgrade and then the cost of my first upgrade 25 and in here i'm gonna make a bottom to save the game so if i close the app and i open it again well i can keep making the cookies i already had before and that's pretty much it for the design so right now we're gonna move into the blocks so right now i already set up some initial values to work with blocks and to add these values right i grab the blocks from the variables blocks okay i initialize three variables of type app these variables when i close the program they will disappear forever and they will when i open the app again they will set up to these initial values i have over here cookies well it's how many cookies i have i think i better just set it up to zero cookies per click sorry i think i i put it backwards sorry for cookies per click is how many cookies i get for each click for each top of the bottom i do into the cookie and the upgrade cost is how much is it gonna cost for me to get more cookies per click i do i also have the same variables but of the store type so stored to for me to recognize that they're different i put them stored under dash cookies start under dash cpz and stored under the upgrade cost so stored variables are the variables that are saved in the memory of the cell phone so when you close the app and you open it again you can find these values all right the reason i did two of them is because usually for a phone it's slower to get the values from the sort space than it is from the app space however you can uh change these values accordingly if you don't really like one or the other or if you think you made an upgrade that you didn't want like if the game gets too complicated and somebody wants to save or not save it's good for us to learn that there's two different types of variables that can be used for different situations so for example the app variable can be used if you want the value to be used rapidly and disappear maybe some time whereas the stored variable is a variable that you may want to use repeatedly later okay so the first thing and the most basic thing we need to do in this app is when i click the image of the gingerbread man i'm gonna get a new cookie so let's go here into image and grab this block when image one click so whenever i click the gingerbread man i will get a new cookie and how do i get well if i have cpc value of one means how many cookies i get per click to one i'll get one more cookie but if i bought an upgrade and now i get two cookies every time i click i should still get the two cookies not just one every time i click this button to do that well we're gonna change the value of this variable of the cookies i have by how many cookies i get every time i click the image so in variables we have the initialize variable which means the initial value of the variable which i already put down there set the value to something specific or change it by a certain number i'm gonna grab this one and put it down here so i'm gonna change the app variable cookies by how much well is this block over here cpc so i can go to variables and grab this app variable cpc block and put it down here that i have a new cookie i want to update the label the remember the label down here that says you have baked zero cookies this one in this case is label two so i can go back here in blocks click on label two from label to set text to now the text will read you have number baked and cookies baked so far okay so you have or you have baked number cookies the message is of course up to you you can make it a little bit different that's still fine what we're gonna do is we're gonna join three messages right you have baked the number and cookies so i'm gonna use this block join in the text category if i click on the gear i can join more than one two texts so i'm gonna make it so i joined three so remember the first one is gonna be you have baked the second one i'm gonna leave it empty for the number and the third one i'm gonna put cookies now in the middle one how many cookies have i baked that one is the variable i get from here cookies so you have baked up variable cookies quiz and that's how we display the value next thing we need we're gonna do is we're gonna set the upgrade button this button over here when i click it will allow me to if i have the enough cookies get more cookies for every click i make so let's start this one is button one so when i click button one something else is bound to happen what's it well what needs to happen well first i need to ask do i have enough cookies to get the better cooking machine so i can get two cookies every time i click it or are my cookies not enough to ask questions like this in programming remember we use if statements we're going to grab this if statement over here and indeed in that if statement in this section ways where the question will be do i have enough cookies or i don't have enough cookies so the answer for this one is for example if my cost is 25 for me to have enough cookies would be if i have 25 cookies 26 cookies 27 cookies or more so you have if i have more cookies than what the opera costs i can make the upgrade to do this you'll notice that thunkable has this greater than less than equal then but it doesn't have any credit equal unless you click on it so you have to grab any of those and search for it directly you don't just get it from here okay so we're gonna have if a value is greater equal than another value if my cookies i have are bigger than what the cost of the upgrade is then i will do the upgrade here i have how many cookies i have and if that value is bigger than a variable upgrade cost how much an upgrade costs then okay first of all if i have 30 cookies and the upgrade is 25 if i purchase the upgrade i should have only five cookies after that the purchase is done so i will first set this new variable cookies and take away from the number of cookies the cost of the upgrade so to do any type of these operations we go to math here and we're subtracting right we're subtracting the number of cookies we have and taking away from that the cost of the upgrade if you see that because we have this check in place the cookies will never go negative you will always have enough cookies if you want to do this operation after that well we have an upgrade right so what are what are we upgrading well sorry not this one we're upgrading the value of the cookies per click so we're changing the value of the cookies per click on the app by one so if i did two cookies per click now i'll do three coopies per click and so on now the upgrades will make it so that they become more expensive the more of them i buy so i'm gonna change the variable of this upgrade cost by if i do change by some number then in a way i'm i'm basing it off a certain like solid number what i can do is if i want to make it harder and harder to get more upgrades so people get more interested in keeping in playing more and more i can change it by my own number so if i cost 25 i'm the upgrade i cost 25 for the next upgrade i'm going to cost 50. so add 25 to myself 25 plus 25 50. for the next upgrade cycle i cost 50 then i myself 50 now i cost a hundred and then i keep going like this until it gets very expensive and people are more invested into playing so this is just one example of course you can do it in a different way but i think in this way you will get double double double the upgrade cost so it's becoming harder and harder more of a challenge to get the number higher and higher the last thing we're gonna do is i'm going to change the text of the button right and change the text of the label so first that label over here remember is label 2. it's the same value we have here so i can just duplicate this block right click duplicate and put it down here so i do the same thing where i show the message of how many cookies i have left and i will change the text of the bottom one too remember the text of this one is upgrade and how many cookies it costs to do the upgrade so i'll keep it that way i have two values upgrade and how much it costs so i'll use a join block i'll put it down here i'll replace this hello with upgrade and the second one i'll just throw it here because i need the cost of the cookies upgrade so the cost perfect so this one will resolve the upgrade button now we have one more button left to code the bottom we have left is to store the variable right to store these variables these app variables into the stored part of the program so that when we open the program again we can access those values so when i click that button which is button number two i'm gonna save these variables these local app variables into the stored variables so we'll set the value of the stored variable for example stored cookies to the variable cookies i can duplicate this so i can save more work and change store variable cookies start cpc will get the value of cpc and stored upgrade cost will get the very the value of app of recast this way i saved it into the storage of the cell phone and i can access it later so to finish the program of course we want to access it if i close the app and i open it again i want to read those values again i'll go over here to screen one and when the screen opens or when the screen starts until when the screen starts if the values of the star variables are not zero right or are not empty if i have something inside of them then i want to actually use those values because what will happen if those values are not like uh are not the initial ones then there's a problem you know if you have zero cookies per click and you start clicking on the cookie you'll just see zero zero zero zero zero like if you're not doing anything you need to make sure that when you load those values there's actually a value that makes sense there to do that well the value we curve the most about would be how many cookies you get per click so if and we'll do a comparison if the cookies i do per click is bigger than zero so if store variable cookies per click is bigger than zero or bigger than zero bigger than one basically it's up to you i think bigger than zero makes it so that there's at least something maybe they did like three cookies and they want to save so so it doesn't make much sense that you punish them for not cooking enough baking enough cookies or maybe they upgraded all the way to 11 the level 10 then they did them last purchase and now they have zero cookies if you try to compare with the cookies and they will lose all their progress so i think cpc is a better measurement because when you first create these stored variables they have no value so if at least if their value is bigger than zero you know they have played and saved once so if that value is okay then we'll do the reverse of this operation so instead of getting from the app variable to the start variable we'll get the value from the start variable and save it into the app variable so i can just duplicate this i'll just put this down here i don't need this button too anymore and change the order so app variable cookies will get the value from store cookies app variable cpc will get the value from stored cpc and app variable upgrade cost will get the value from start upgrade cost and that's pretty much it for this app okay so i have the project open up down here and this is the finished product so you see i can get more cookies here the cookies and i'm getting one per click i'm going to upgrade and i will get super click keep operating i have 40 then i have 80. next is 160 but now i'm getting more cookies per click hmm keep going keep going keep going and now i get 5x5 okay i really hope you enjoyed this project like this little christmas project you can show to your family and friends that's gonna be all for today thanks for watching i hope you enjoyed the tutorial see you on the next one
