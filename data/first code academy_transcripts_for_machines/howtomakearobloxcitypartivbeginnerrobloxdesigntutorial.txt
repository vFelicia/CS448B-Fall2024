hi everyone welcome back to first code academy channel and in today's project we'll continue in our series of how to make a roblox city i hope you enjoy it on this fourth part of our project we'll be learning how to implement vehicles and i'll be giving you some suggestions of what type of vehicles to add in your project to make the city look more lively and let's get going with the project so after last week i added a couple roads so we can test our vehicles and see which are the best options for our city beside the bridge i added some roads that loop around and parking lots that's we're gonna put all the vehicles and i'm gonna test it one by one to see how they work i i still have this part over here since i added the other elements i can push it to a little bit behind so it doesn't interfere with our main city so as you can see i moved this pawn over here since i don't really need it over there since i'm putting all the vehicles in the parking lot and what type of cars can i add on let's start with a couple of cars you can just type a car let's see i like the cool fast one so i'm gonna put a tesla well just because it's a noble one right and i'm gonna leave them usually at the normal size and unless they're like too big or too small but usually it's not the case all right i'm gonna add a lamborghini they take a little bit to load because they have a lot of scripts inside this looks so tiny in comparison to the normal like monster truck it's scary imagine you crashed with this one you crush these two together then we we kind of know which one won't survive uh i'm curious about this future car i'm gonna put this as well it's also quite big i think barely fits parking space okay let's start with these five i'm gonna try out each one of them and then we're gonna put more suggestions of other types of vehicles you can put besides normal cars you can see like for example this car this in spare uh they have a dry seed body for example master and it's just like the body part the wheels also have like front left parts and the scripts you'll have to like dig super inside i'm not really sure where they put all the scripts now for example the seat has a script which is pretty big i believe it's just to move uh to adjust the character inside of the of the seat so these scripts are not really for moving the car more like for the character to actually look as if it's sitting down inside of the car now this one is the actual big script right it even has a rhythmic explaining what the car does it's pretty huge and initialize and then you have all of the codes inside of this board right so we're not going to touch them it's just to let you know that cars don't move just because like you can draw a car or build a car with parts and everything but you still need the coating otherwise the car is never going to move and especially these are these are drivable cars there's a difference between cars like you can make a car that moves itself and a car you can actually drive so let's see no i want the driver's seat okay i assume this was for breaking but i pressed the space in accent normally in racing games i don't want to walk all the way back normally in racing games the break is to do like heartbreak but apparently i just sent it flying away which is kind of fortunate for the car i'm going to move it a little bit off maybe that's the problem oh it's not the monster truck if it doesn't kill me first all right even this one works okay uh if you see this one is massive and pretty hard to control i believe it should have the same controls right my handbrake with pin okay now i know how to do it right barely fits the streets but i think so goodbye all right i guess that one is a governor let's start with the police one maybe those are easier to control oh no it's just a police car okay i don't want the police car anymore all right so it's part of the or the process as well maybe something is happening with police car and i cannot try the other ones either and what all type of vehicles do we have uh or should we include in the city well if you put a school you should create school bus right or any method of transportation actually uh like for the city boost proper maybe let's try with this this one had a lot of uploads probably work put it here in the parking lot i'm not sure how it works but i mean if you can park it in then probably can work it out let's put it yeah all the way here let's see if i can i'm good enough of a driver to take it out of this parking lot i'm gonna double the future car uh what are type of vehicles if you have a construction site you might want some construction vehicles crane now crane is not really a vehicle this one for example and you can even include some motorcycles maybe people didn't really like it you you should also look at the boats if you want to decide on the vehicle maybe that's something i didn't do before maybe the ones i just deleted are the ones below both who knows um i'll check the footage again to see if that was the case or not oh yeah try to populate your city i'm putting them right now in the parking lot for next class i'm gonna put them in different places whoa this is super fun you're very hard to control or i'm very bad at controlling it i'm not really sure we'll try the r2 and that's how we're going to wrap it up i'm gonna just try the crane see if this one is actually any better it doesn't actually have any instruction like the box let me just decoration in any case i still have to i've got my two cars at work my monster truck and my lamborghini then i never knew i was gonna stick like in the motor stop better than the other one but yeah just make sure to be careful when you drive this thing otherwise you'll get the wheel to stop like i did in the first one how did it turn around i'm not really sure very resilient okay i'm gonna find more vehicles and then we're gonna wrap it up for the next video and that's gonna be it for today i hope you enjoyed this project don't forget to like and subscribe and we'll see you on the final part goodbye
