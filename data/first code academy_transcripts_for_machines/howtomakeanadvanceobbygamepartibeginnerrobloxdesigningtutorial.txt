hello everyone welcome back to our channel here we share beginner friendly coding tutorials on scratch roblox minecraft web programming and many more today i will be teaching you on how to create an advanced roblox of the game this advanced roblox of the game tutorial is divided into four parts in this video which is the first part of the series i will be teaching you on how to create simple and common obstacles which you can find in most of the games which includes a conveyor belt explosive laces sliding in obstacles which you can create using roblox studio so let's get started all right so the first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to open up my roblox studio and create a new file with the template of a classic faceplate alright now i have loaded my baseplate so this is where i'm going to create my roblox i'll begin so first i'm going to start off at one corner of my base plate which gives me the option of using the whole base plate to make my advance or begin so i'll just move my camera wave up all right so i'll be going to this corner of my base plate so if i can see here this is my whole base plate and i'm going to start off with the right bottom corner here all right so i'm going to just add a spawn location first so that my player would spawn at the beginning of my up i'll be course so i'm going to click on toolbox and i'm going to find a spawn location so you can choose any spawn location that you like i'll just add one there i need to drag it to the corner here a little bit like that all right so what i'm going to do next is on the first part of my upbeat course i'll be just picking some simple platforms where the player have to jump around so for to do that i'll just click on part use a block and i'll be choosing the size of the width and the length of the platform is going to be eight into eight so on the properties i'm going to change into 8 comma 1 comma 8. so it gives me a platform that is big enough for me to jump into so i'll just write you scale so use move and i'll be dragging this and place it four starts away from my spawn location like that so you you're feel free to change your color and the material of your object so i'll just click on the material to be plastic and i'll just change the color to be all right so next what i'm going to do is i'm going to anchor it so that when at the end of my game once i design my game i'll be deleting the base bit so i need to anchor the platform so that they don't fall off so i have anchored them so next i'm going to create or duplicate this platform three times so that there will be three jumping platforms just add one more that is four studs away apart from each other all right that should be it so it looks nice i'll be changing the colors all right next what i'm going to do is i'm going to create some wedge platforms to make it more interesting so what i'm going to do is i'll be adding a wedge platform and if you can see the wedge the top part of the bridge is on that is facing towards my platform so i need to rotate it or flip it horizontally let's just click on rotate and you see a green color circle so i'll be turning my wedge part along that so that the corner of the edge would be facing the other way like where you can jump onto the other platform so i'll just make this wedge to be a little bit bigger so i'm going to click on scale make it the length of the weight which bar to be longer and also the height all right so next i'm going to add another wedge platform and it will be four which platforms that would be floating in the media so it's kind of like making a staircase so i'll be adding a wedge platform like that and i'll be turning it like that so i'll just change the color it should be brown so and then i'll just make it to be a little bit bigger so click on scale begin high like that and i'll be just moving it up so i'm going to click on move and click on the green arrow and i'm going to lift it up like that so that it's floating in the middle so i'll just bring it a little bit closer so that it's not too far for me to jump into and then i'm going to anchor this platform so that it doesn't fall down when i try to play my game because right now it's floating on the midi so what i'm going to do is i'm going to make four more three more steps actually that is floating on the media and kind of giving like a staircase effect so that the player can jump so i'll just duplicate it so you can press on command we command c and command v if you're using a mac computer or if you're using a windows computer or a laptop you can use ctrl c and then press on control v to duplicate and maybe lift it up a little bit and then anchor as you should so i'll just change the color so again i'll just duplicate it okay so you can always try this out to see if the spacing is fine for the player to jump around so after i my player passes along this particular section of the course the player is going to reach the first checkpoint so whenever the player dies during the course maybe whether it's full maybe whether it gets out of the uh upbeat game platform or maybe it touches a laser or an explosive laser the player would always point to the last updated checkpoint so i'll be adding another small location after this wedge part all right and i'll just make it anchor so that okay it's already anchored so make sure that all the parts are anchored so that we don't have any platforms that are falling down when you play the game all right so next we are going to make the second obstacle which would be a tunnel of explosive layer now in this channel you would have a conveyor belt and then you have to jump along when you see an explosive layer but if you touch an explosive layer you'll be dead so first i'll be creating my channel so i'll be using another part and i'll just change the color it to be black all right and i'll just make my ground off the base of my channel so i'll just use scale drag it along make the length of it to be a little bit wider so that the player can pass along and then long enough so you can increase the length of it the width should be just enough for the player to pass along okay so in this tunnel you'll be not only having laser flashing laces but there'll be like other obstacles that is popping up like walls with obstacles that is coming sliding in and sliding up so this space is going to be having both of the explosive laces and the obstacles that are sliding in so i'll just make it long enough so that it's going to contain both of these obstacles so it's going to be like this big just long yeah all right next i need to bring it up so that it matches to the height of this phone location so like it's kind of like leveled up okay so i have a really long space for my channel okay next i'm going to add my conveyor pass so i need another part that is on the ground that is going to be act acting as my conveyor so i'll just add another part but i'll just change the color for now so that it's it's easy to identify so i'll just make it to a lighter color like that and i'm going to rename this part which i just add as convey so that it's easy for me to add my code when i do the coding so i can identify my path easily conveyor all right so the conveyor is going to be the width of the convey is going to be the same as this a little bit smaller because i need some spacing in the two edges so that it's good so i can uh build my wall so i just add that and use scale and stretch it in terms of length and i'm going to stop it here and then i'll just increase the width like this and wait like that all right so i have my current way right now all right now i'm going to create my walls on the sides of my panel so i'll just add another part and this is going to be the same color as my base of my channel so if you want to change the color how make it a colorful tunnel just feel free to do so so just stretch it along and then i'm going to lift it up so that the height of this part is up all right i have one more right now and i'll just duplicate it again and i'll just fix it on the other side of my turn so i have two walls right now now you might see there's a spacing of my conveyor so again we can fix that so i'll be clicking on the conveyor part and click on the red knobs and then stretch it out so that there's no spacing of the base plate all right so i'll be adding my cylinders right now or my laser beams so i'll just go inside my laser beams like inside my tunnel and i'll be choosing a cylinder this time that would be acting as my laser beam so i'll just change the material to be neon and i'll change my list the color of my laser beams to be red alright and then i'm going to click on scale and choose the knobs and stretch it along this way like that and i'll just lift it a little bit not so that it's not directly on the conveyor belt like that so you can see there's some spacing between the lysophil and the base of the conveyor belt okay so the reason why i didn't place my laser beam in the very beginning of the conveyor belt is that due to the speed of the conveyor belt like when the player jumps onto the conveyor belt and if there's a laser beam directly in front of us the player would instantly get killed so we are going to give some spacing so that the player can get ready to jump over the laser beams so i'll just move it a little bit further like that all right so since my convey is not too long i'm not going to add a lot of laser beams but if you want you can you feel free to add more beams so i'll just add another beam okay so that's the first obstacle inside the tunnel next i'm going to add my platforms that are sliding in and out all right so to do that i'll be adding one block out of the tunnel so i'll be adding a block here and then which is going to slide in this way and another block that is going to slide in this way all right so i'll just add i'll just change my camera view so that i can see one side of my conveyor belt so make sure that you know where your conveyor ends and then it starts to the next obstacle in the tunnel so just somewhere here would be fine so i'll just click on q and go down and then change my camera view alright and then i'm going to click on a block another block and i'll just change the material back to plastic now this time i'm going to scale it to the size to a height of the wall i'm going to click on the green knob and stretch it along like that so that it's directly the same size as the height of the wall so make sure that there's no sticking out all right and yeah so there's there should not be any sticking out like that you can put it out like that and then you you can stretch it out on the outer side of the wall that's fine but there should not be anything that is sticking inside the wall or into the inner part of the tunnel so i'll just make it a little bit bigger so that it's a very big obstacle that is sliding in and out into the time so i'll just bring this block in front like that all right now i'll be changing this or renaming this part as moving part so that i need to code it so that it keeps on going to the left and another part is going to the right so i'll just go to view click on properties oh click on explorer so make sure that you have highlighted or clicked on this particular part and i'm going to rename it as moving obstacle all right so i'll just place copy and duplicate it all right so now i'm going to place one more obstacle that is sliding on the from the other side of the tunnel so just copy again and move it this part so that it's in between these two blocks and move it down so that it gets attached to the wall so remove your camera and see if it is getting closer to the wall and then push it down zoom in and see if there's anything sticking out all right okay so i'll just move it a little bit i'll just move this part a little bit here and i'll just duplicate this part and go to the corner so that means i have four moving parts or moving obstacles push it down okay so that should be it all right so now we have made the tunnel and next we are going to make the other obstacles so that's all for today so in the next tutorial we will learn how to code the obstacles for lasers the conveyor belt and the sliding platforms and also we'll be learning on how to make different types of obstacles which we can use for your object make sure to subscribe to our channel to check out the next video of this project and don't forget to hit the like button thank you bye
