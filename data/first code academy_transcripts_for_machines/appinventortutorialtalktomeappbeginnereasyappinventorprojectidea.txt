hello everyone welcome to first code academy today we'll be making a project called talk to me with the use of app inventor in this project you will be learning how to create an application that speaks out a message that you type in using the text box component in app inventor and additionally we will also learn how to make our program say a message that is stop shaking me when we start shaking our phone and once we're at the home page we can begin on clicking create apps so once we're at this page what we can do is we can click on start new project then we can type in our project name so our project name is called talk to me then we press enter it will start building up the screen and the other components so as that is done this is what our mobile screen will look like here are the palette items that we can use and these is where the component shall be we can begin by adding a background color for our application so we click on our screen one and we scroll down and you will see a item that says background color under it it says default so we can click on this and you can change it to any color that you like i'm going to pick the yellow color so i'm going to scroll my mouse down click on yellow and then the background color changes to yellow here the next thing we'd like to add is we'd like to add a button so we can scroll to this take out button and just drag it here and we want to remove the text that is inside so we scroll down and as you see we can click on the button and here we remove this text of text for button one can press on backspace and press enter the next thing we want to add in is a label now a label is known as an area where you can add some text so we can take out the label and put that here so the text for label one has some text inside but we don't want it to keep that same text we want to change it so we want to highlight this backspace enter and we want to change this to click me to talk that exclamation marks you can add that there you can change this text to anything you like you can change it to click button to talk i just changed the click meter and me is referring to this button you can also change the color of this text you can even change the font size of this text so i can change this font size here to maybe 25 and then if i like i can make it bold it i can even make it italic and you can give the text a background color or you can change the text color here so say i want red i can change it to red and then we have these two things and if we want to bring them to the middle and click on screen and then here the align horizontal you can make it centered and this brings the two items in the middle next we want to add an image so we actually have a link with an image over here that says talk to me and to download this image we can click on this download button here and then it shall download the image to our computer the next thing we can do is head back to our mit app inventor and we click back on our button and we scroll down to our image over here so this is where you can pick an image either from your computer or you take one from the internet save it to your computer and then upload it so you can click upload file click on choose file and then here we click on all and then here we click on the app inventor and click open and then we click ok so here we have a button with an image inside so the next thing that we want to add is we want to add something that will allow our program to speak and use our phone to speak we're going to be taking out the text to speech component so when you scroll here you will see media and then you will scroll to this and you take out text to speech and what this does is it will convert anything you put in text to speech and then we can add in a text box so we click on user interface as we scroll down here you should find a text box and you can put that over here so you can add this here so you can type in any text you like here and then when you press the button it'll say it and we have a text to speech component so the next part is we scroll down to sensors and take out accelerometer sensor and we put that here this is going to help us to send feedback from our phone and let it know to the program that our phone is being shook so to do this now we have done with the design part we're now going to start with the coding section so we click on blocks here and what we can do is when we click on button one you can take this out and then we can have your text box right so what we want to do next is you can see here that we have something called text box one dot text so we can take this out and then when we click on the button we want it to say something from our text box so we can scroll here and you'll see a call text to text speech one grab this put that here and then take in the text box one dot text and put this here so what that is going to do is then when we click our button it's going to speak out whatever we put inside the text box and then the next thing we can add is that when we shake our phone so we click on accelerometer one and then we take out accelerometer sensor one dot shaky once we take this out this would mean that we're shaking our phone according to that event we want our app to say stop shaking so we once again click on the text speech and we take this out let me put it inside here and the message is going to be stop shaking me so we click on text we take this out and we put this here and we're going to change this to stop shaking me and once we're done with that we have our two code blocks so button one when we click it our app will send a message telling the phone that oh you need to speak inside what is inside the text box one and the text box one is whatever text we've put inside then we have another piece of code here that says one accelerometer one shaking so this is a sensor which can detect that our phone is shaking and it will send feedback to our app and then our app will understand that okay someone is shaking the phone then the text speech will say say this message of stop shaking me so this is our app we're not going to look at how does it look on the phone and how does it function so first you'd need an android phone and look like this and you would need the mi2 app on your phone as well there are two ways to get our application we can click on build and select the app provided qr code to download the application on our phone if we do not want to do that we can use the different way of connecting it to our phone by clicking connect and then ai companion once you click on that you'll see a qr code pop up on your phone you'll have an option that says scan qr code so you can click on it like this and then it will show you this so you can scan your app here and then it will slowly load it on your phone as you see there's a loading bar here and then it should pop up on your phone over here so here is my app so i'm gonna type in something i'm gonna write in first code academy okay then click on done then i'm going to press first code academy so once i click on the button here it will say whatever i put inside the text box so instead if i want to say my name so i'll add in my name so my name is siddharth then i can click there so you can hear it once i click it it says my name and then once you shake the phone stop stop stop stop shaking me stop stop shaking me stop stop so every time you shake it it says stop shaking me so this is how our application works so i hope you had fun making the app thank you very much for
