hello everyone welcome back to our channel so here we share beginner friendly coding tutorials on scratch roblox minecraft um web programming and many more today what we're going to be doing is a scratch tutorial on a project called five things i like about nature in this project we're going to be creating a simple scratch animation about five things i like in nature and when i click on a green flag right here the story would start when i press and space bar the fact number would change so now we're on fact number one two three four and five and in the end we also have the the end page so let's get started so we are going to create a project on scratch and you can find scratch by going to the link called scratch.mit.edu and to start with the project we're going to click on this create button right here all right so once our new project is created we're going to go ahead and delete the scratch cat sprite right here by clicking on the trash bin um icon right here all right now the next thing we need to do is add in the backdrops all right so we're gonna go to backdrops all right so once we're here we're gonna go ahead and click choose a backdrop and choose our backdrop so we're going to go ahead with a backdrop that's more related to nature theme so we can search up nature right there can go ahead so i'm going to go ahead and choose this one all right this is my first one and i'm going to add more until i have six in total okay my second one and i'm gonna go ahead and choose my third one okay and the fourth one go with this one and my fifth one all right okay so i have the first backdrop for my first fact second third fourth and fifth okay now i'm gonna go back to my first backdrop because i'm gonna need to make a title page and in the title page i'm gonna write five things i like about nature so i'm gonna use my paint brush tool right here and choose a color using this fill function and i'm gonna go with blue all right i can also change my pen size right here so right now it's set at the size 10. i'm going to make it 13. so five okay and then i'm going to choose a different color now for the better word five things all right now if you're not very um familiar with using the painting tool you can go ahead and use this text tool as well so when you use the text tool and you click on your backdrop you can actually type out the words so instead of drawing it out just like i did you can go ahead and type five things like so all right but i prefer the painting tool so i'm going to go ahead and delete this all right so five things i like and then again i'm going to change about okay nature all right so now we have five things i like about nature which is our title page okay so now that we have this we're gonna go ahead to our second backdrop here to write the first thing we like okay so for the first fact i'm going to use the text tool right here and type in number one i like the smell of flowers so that's my first fact for my second fact again i'm going to use the text tool choose a different color from my backdrop so i'm going to go with maybe red and type in 2 time feels slower when i'm with nature all right this is number two and then we're gonna do a number three so since the background's more purplish then i'm gonna go with something that has a lot of contrast like yellow and type in number three i get creative ideas when i look at nature okay this is my fact number three again i can move it around like so okay maybe i'll move it to the bottom so here number three i get creative ideas when i look at nature okay so moving on to number four okay i'm going to choose something that's a little bit different so there's yellow here so i'm going to switch to pink and type in four there are mint the ear is cleaner and more fresh okay this is my fourth fact the area is cleaner and more fresh i'm gonna move it here and make it bigger okay there is cleaner oops made a spilling mistake here the ear okay is cleaner and more fresh and the fifth one okay so it's at the beach i'll go ahead and write number five i like the sound of waves okay so this is my fifth fat all right so let's go ahead and have a look so the first one is five things i like about nature fact number one i like the small flowers number two time feel slower when i'm with nature three i get creative ideas when i look at nature for the areas cleaner and more fresh and five i like the sound of waves okay now the last thing we need to do is just add the end backdrop so i'm going to go ahead and choose a backdrop for that and i'm going to go with something simple like this okay for the uh the end backdrop and for this one i'm going to switch back to my painting tool and choose yellow right the end okay so that's it with our backdrop design now the next step would be to start coding it okay so to start coding we need to go ahead and click on the code tab here to code the project all right and then at the beginning of our uh project we want to start with the title page so let's go to the event and drag in when the green flag is clicked even okay and when green flag is clicked now we also want to make sure that when the story starts we are at the correct backdrop in our case it would be the title page so we're going to go ahead to looks and choose the backdrop choose the block that says switch backdrop to so our first backdrop is actually called backdrop1 and we're going to connect it to when green flag is clicked okay next we have to give instructions that whenever we press the space bar the backdrop should change to our fax so i'm going to go drag um the event called when space key is pressed right here from events okay and then i'm going to say all right so when space key is pressed i want to switch to the next backdrop now we have completed the project so let's click on the green flag to start our scratch animation all right so you can see when i click on the green flag it brings me to the title page which is what we want okay so now when i click on space bar it goes to the second backdrop and then fact number two number three four five the end page and then again when i press in spacebar it is the title page all right so if you like our project today don't forget to like and subscribe and check out our other two videos and see you next time bye
