hello everybody welcome back to our channel here we share beginner friendly coding tutorials on scratch roblox minecraft web programming and many more today we're going to create a star wars symphony with micro bits happy 4th of may to all of you and may the force be with you in this project we'll learn to make a star wars tone using micro bits with mid code and blocks we'll make the starting tone of star wars using musical notes so let's get started so let's go over to makecode.microfits.org to start a new project here we can actually delete the onstart and forever block yes we will not need it for this project next go down to advanced and go to control and drag out run in background this block will make sure that we can run any code in the background of our micro bits program next go over to basic and grab the show string block over here and let's change the content of this string into star wars and uh the force awaken and this uh the show shrink blocks uh will display the stuff we wrote here as a string in the background of our program and string is a data format for us display text so now let's begin our music um notes for the actual star wars tones here we want to play the actual tones when the user have clicked on a button and here we're going to say when the user click on button a we'll play the music so let's go over to here we're going to grab the on button a pressed and now we also want to grab a loop that can allow us to repeat our tone so we don't have to write the same tones again and you'll just have a repeat loop that will run the tones four times for us indicated by this four times here so instead of this repeat loop we want to write and put down our music blocks so we will play the tones here let's go to music so the first thing we're going to grab is play tone middle c and we're going to drag it inside and you can change the tones by just clicking on it and there's a piano and um you can see that here's a sound so we're going to try to find um metal g which is right here and so yep now we have middle g and let's change this one beat to a fourth of beat so one fourth beat now let's go back to music and let's grab the rest here we want to change one beats again and this time we'll change it to 1 8 and we'll repeat these two blocks two more times so let's go over to music play tone again change it to middle g and change this to a fourth of a beat and again we'll be resting for one eighth of a beat and one last time play tone middle c click on middle c here and change the tone to middle g and now change the beats to 1 4 and again let's drag in the rest um for 1 8 of a beat just like that next we're gonna once again go back to music here we're gonna grab the play tone middle c and we're going to drag in here and we're actually going to leave it as it is so we will keep middle c and we'll keep the one beat and we're actually going to drag another play tone you know c for one beat so it's two of them in a row next let's drag in another music play tones and here instead of middle c we'll change it back to middle g and we can also keep the beat for one and again let's go over to music tones and play tones here again we're gonna change it to middle g and keep it as one beat and now again we're going to go to music play tones and now we actually want a middle f so the middle f will be somewhere in the middle and it's right here and for middle f we'll change this to a fourth of a beat so we'll play for four fifa beats now let's go back to music and grab the rest put under here we're going to rest for an aflat beat so let's change this to our eighth of a beat and again let's go to music and we're gonna grab the play tone again now let's change the middle c to middle e so again let's click on here and all the middle should be in the middle of this piano so we can just go through middle east right here and we'll change this to one fourth of a beat and let's go again to music and now we're going to rest again for an f of a beat so here let's change it to a awesome and let's go back to music again we're going to grab play tones and here we're going to say play tone for middle d so let's click on middle c and find middle d which is right next to it and here we're going to play middle d for fourth of a beat again we're going to go to music grab tone here we're going to write um play the tone high c so here let's click on here here's the low part so here should be the high parts and let's find high c and we'll keep this at one beat so high c for one beat again let's go to music and again we'll be playing high c for one beat again so here after we drag it in let's change it to high c and again we can uh keep the beats s1 now let's go again to play tones and this time we're gonna have middle g for one beat so here let's change this middle g and we keep this to one beat and again now we need a play tone from middle f so here go to music play tones let's change this to middle f and we change this to a fourth of a beat so this is the current um music that we have i know it's a little bit long but this will play out and you actually played the star wars stones for us after this let's go to music and we'll once again use rest and here we'll change this beats to 1 8 and now we want to put a middle e after this so play tone uh middle e which is right here and we'll play this for a fourth of a beat and then we'll rest for an eighth of a beat again so let's go rest and then one eighth now let's continue dragging music blocks here go to music play tones we're going to change this to middle d and we're going to change this to 1 4 of a beat now this is going to be followed by two high c's so here we're gonna have play tones go to high c and you'll be for one beat and we need two of those so let's drag in another another one go to high c keep it as one beats and now let's drag in two more of these tones before we pause again we're going to have a middle g for one beat so let's find middle g for beat and then we also need a middle f for a fourth of a beat so let's try again and change this to your middle f let's change this to one fourth and we're almost done now let's add another rest so here let's go to music rest let's change this to 1 8 and now let's add another play tones we're going to play the middle e so let's find middle e and we'll change the beats to 1 4 and we're going to take a small break so let's put in the rest and 1 8 of a beat now let's drag in another play tones here we'll change middle c to middle f again and i will play this for a fourth of a beat again and uh let's add another rest change this to 1 8th and we have two more music tones to add and then we will have our musical tunes here let's go play tones change this to middle d i'm going to keep this as one beat and uh let's drag another and again this will be a middle d with one beat so these are the tones that are needed to play the star wars uh symphony and here we can play the starting tones of star wars by just playing all of these tones in order and since we have repeat four times um this replay four times so let's try it actually and click and here we're playing the star wars sounds using all of these tones and again they repeat it because we accept repeat four times so that's all for today in today's tutorial we created a musical symphony with the use of microbits music blocks to create the star wars theme song i hope you guys like it and may the force be with you don't forget to like this video and subscribe to our channel also check out our other
