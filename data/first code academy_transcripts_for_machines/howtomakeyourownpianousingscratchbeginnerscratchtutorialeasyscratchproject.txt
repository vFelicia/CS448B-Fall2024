hello everyone welcome to first code academy today we are going to make a simple project on scratch called scratch piano in this project we can play the scratch piano by pressing on a number key so when i press key number one it will play me number two three and moving forward to make our colorful piano keyboard we need eight colorful rectangle sprites to make our musical sound do re me fa so la si and do so let's see how we can make this project on scratch to start with the project i'm going to delete the cat spri so we are going to click delete on this cat and then i'm going to make the heading on the background so i'm going to click on the heading and then i'm going to click on the text box so i'm going to create a text box that is called scratch piano then i'm going to make it the text color to be black and then i'm going to stretch this to make the text a little bit bigger and then i'm going to place it at the middle of the screen tiger so next we have to make our eight colorful rectangulus price so we need to make our own customs price so we are going to click on the paint brush and then we are going to click on this rectangular paint block here and then i'm going to start with the red color spray i'm going to draw a small rectangular stripe just the size of that next i'm going to place it on the middle of the screen that's perfect so now that i have my first sprite i'm going to make the size a little bit smaller so i'm going to go ahead and change the size to be 17. so this will help us to have more space to have seven most price so in order to have our keyboard in the same size i'm going to duplicate the sprite block i'm going to right click on the sprite and then click on duplicate next i'm going to rearrange them and then i'm going to change my color it would be orange and then fill it so i'm going to repeat the same process to get my eight musical notes i'm going to duplicate and i'm going to rearrange them this time it would be yellow this would be great blue and our last musical keyboard that is the upper dough now we are going to build our code so first let's click on sprite 1 and then we are going to click on so to play our sound we need to press our key so key press is an event block and event block are some triggers that will cause use price to do certain actions in this project our event would be when you press on a number key it would make your surprise to play a musical cell our yellow blocks in scratch are our even blocks so now we need to add an event block so let's go to events and then let's bring the block call when space key press we are going to change the space key to be a number key so sprite number one is going to be playing by number 1k next we need to add our musical notes so in order to do that we need to add an extension to scratch so let's click on add extension and let's bring the music code blocks so next we need to add the play note block so let's click this block and then drag it and then we're going to snap them together so this would play c sound this is how long you have you can play the sound so i'm going to make it 0.5 beats so when i press on key one it would play me good job now we are going to repeat the same process for the next musical note so i'm going to click on sprite 2 i'm going to add one space key press and change it to number two and then let's go to music blocks and then i'm going to add this time i'm going to make it d and then i'm going to change the number of beats to be 0.5 next i'm going to play number three and then it will pay me and then four i need to press on number four and then i'm going to play f sprite number five when i press on key five it'll play me g 0.5 bits six when i pass on number six it'll play me key a for 0.5 bits we're almost there so let's click on when space key press and change it to be number seven and the musical note this time it would be b 0.5 beats the last sprite or our musical note so let's go ahead and grab one space key press 8 and then it's going to blame our last cell that is see awesome now you have made a scratch piano so let's click on the green flag good job now let's try on our project so let's go ahead and start with key one and backwards good job now you can play your favorite song so even vibes on this scratch piano keyboard so that's all for today i hope you like this project remember to give a thumbs up if you like it and do not forget to hit the subscribe button to get update on new tutorials thank you bye
