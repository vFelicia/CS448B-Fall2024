hi everyone and welcome back to our channel here we share beginner friendly tutorial videos on scratch roblox minecraft web programming and many more and today we're going to create a chinese zodiac generator in python so let's get coding the first thing that we will need to do is to import every important library that we will use and different libraries in python enable us to do different things there is quite a lot of them and in our case we're going to use a library called pill or pil which stands for python imaging library this python imaging library will enable us to open the chinese zodiac file at the very end so let's write our first line which is from pio capitalized import image and right now we're going to get the input from the user so name equals input we're going to use the function input which enables the user to write something and we will save it and also inside the brackets you can specify what kind of question do you want to ask and so what is your name this will be the first question now we're also going to check what is the year of birth so yeah equals input what is your birth yeah okay now the only problem with that is that in order to calculate the chinese zodiac you need to treat the year as a number because you need to divide it subtract things from it and so on but input returns a string which means it's a string of characters and it's not really recognized as a number and you can't divide it by a number for instance so in order to change it into a number we need to write int open bracket and close the bracket at the very end this stands for integer and integers are numbers like 0 1 2 3 4 5 and so on so like normal numbers and we already have all the data so right now we're going to create um we're going to calculate the chinese zodiac so we're going to use something called conditional statements and and we'll start we're going to start for from an if statement so this is a simple condition if something happens then something else happens too and the condition for the chinese zodiac is yeah minus two thousand and it's remainder from division by twelve so if the remainder from division by twelve is equal to zero so if it's um if you can divide it by 12 the sign is going to be a dragon okay and we're going to do a similar thing for every kind of chinese zodiac so then we're going to use another conditional statement but this one is going to be slightly different so else l if so else if yeah minus 200 2 000 sorry yep 2 000 and its remainder from division by 12 is equal to 1 then we will have a snake okay and the reason why we use else if is that it enables us not to check it at all if the first condition is true so suppose we find that it is equal to zero that is that it is a dragon and and then we will not change uh we will not check anything that is below anymore so we'll just say okay it's a dragon fine we'll we'll leave it at that um so there will not be too many unnecessary calculations and you can also see a pattern emerging right because we have the division by 12 you have different remainders we have minus 200 every time and actually what you can do is copy and paste this um so that you can have different animals but written in the same way so let's copy and paste it actually and then we're going to only change the different different numbers at the end and also different names of the zodiac because they're different zodiacs so then let's change all the remainders to all the numbers from 0 to 10. and then we're going to write every possible chinese zodiac so after the snake comes the horse so let's make it a horse and then a sheep and then a monkey and after a monkey we have a rooster and after the rooster we have a dog and after the dog we have the pig and the rat and an ox so that's going to be another one and also a tiger now if you if you know all the chinese zodiacs by heart or if you just counted uh what i what i have just done you'll see that there is one missing because here is uh here we have only 11 of them and the reason behind that is that the last done is actually going to be a little bit different because we can of course write l if yeah minus 200 percent sign 12 equals 11 then do something else but actually the remainders of division by 12 are only between 0 and 11. so we already know that we have already checked all the other options so if it's not 0 not 1 and nothing between 0 and 10 then it must be 11 there is no other option so we don't need to check this additionally we can just write else so in any other case which will be the case when it's 11 the sign equals hair okay and this is everything when it comes to the calculation now let's display the results to the user so we're going to print a message so the message will be named and the name will be um and after the name we will call the year in which the user was born so we will display a short message and write that your chinese zodiac is and then we will add the sign so sine is the name of of the zodiac of the animal corresponding to the zodiac and the user will hopefully see the correct chinese zodiac that they belong to okay and now what about pictures so the only thing that's left is showing the picture so let's create the image path so let's call it image name and this will be the place where our picture is located so firstly we will check in the pictures folder and then we're going to look for the right chinese zodiac and then we're going to open the image using pill so let's say we want to open the image like that so we need to use the image.open function and the image.open function can have the name inside the parenthesis so this is because pill needs to know which kind of image do you want to have opened okay so then we just call the method called show so we have an image name and then we search for this image and then we show it to the user and this should be everything so let's check if it works so let's run the program okay so we see the first question what is your name so you write something and what is your birth yeah okay we also write something okay so we see the message your chinese zodiac is right um it's good and then a lot of windows but the most important thing is that we are able to see this beautiful rat at the very end so it's is the same as in the message one is red and the other is right as well so it works so that's it for today thank you very much for following us and if you like this video don't forget to subscribe to our channel and like our video and while you're waiting for the next video to
