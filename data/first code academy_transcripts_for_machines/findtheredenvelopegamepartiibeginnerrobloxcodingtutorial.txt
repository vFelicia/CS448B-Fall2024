hello everyone welcome back to our channel here we share beginner friendly coding tutorials on scratch roblox minecraft web programming and many more and today we're going to take a look at part two of our roblox treasure hunt game for this project i'll be using the code kingdom platform to make the code for the scoring system i will be using a numeric for loop to show the number of red envelopes that the player has found all right so let's get started all right so we want to open up the custom game file that we have created earlier now what we want to do is we want to click this plus sign right here to add a new file right and we want the file name to be called score and the class to be player and add us a local behavior so score player and local behavior and we can go ahead and click add all right and we're going to go ahead and click add method right here all right and we want to choose the one that says oncreate okay so function score on create now from the code library that's to our left we're going to drag out the for loop so we can actually search search it up as well okay we want this one right here the numeric for loop drag that in here okay so we want to start from one thick and then end five all right and the next thing we want to do is we want to drag in broadcast message so i'm going to search it up broad pass message right here okay bring that below the for loop and inside the text we want to type in find all ten red envelopes in five minutes tick mark all right and the time we're gonna put five okay now the next thing we want to do is we want to click add method again okay right down here and we want to choose uh we want to sorry we want to create a method called set score okay set score like that click create so now we have function score set score and we want to go ahead and click on this arrow right here all right and we want to create a variable a variable so we want it to be called new score and it's a number right the new score number and tick mark okay so this is how it should look like the function score set score and then new score right in here okay now the next step is we want to add in an object equals to update okay so i'll search up object this is what i mean object equals to update we want to drag it to this method right here now in the object all right we want to go ahead and create a variable called player score we want to make it a number field okay so switch it's a field and then number click mark all right so become self dot player score okay and in the update part we'll click on the new score variable okay like so all right so now after we do that we want to go ahead and add in a set stat so we can search that up set that right here and we're going to drag that below score right now for name okay we want to say red envelopes found okay now the value okay so we want it to be the new score variable right here okay so itself sets that red envelope sound and new score okay now we're going to go ahead and add in another method so click add method and this one we want to create our own new method called gain points so gain points okay and then from the code library we want to go ahead and drag in set score set score right here and we want to bring it inside this function okay set score and in the new score part we want to click on left plus right okay in the left part it will be player score okay right here and then in the right part plus one so every time we find a new envelope we get one point enter a number and then one right there okay so now we want to go back to the oncreate method which is the one right here and outside of the for loop we want to set score to zero okay so we can find that again set score we'll put it right outside so here okay and set it to zero enter the number zero okay so basically here is when the time is up we want to destroy the player all right and then we're going to go ahead and add in a wait block below our set score to 0 and we'll put 125 seconds all right and then after that's done we're gonna broadcast a message so broadcast message all right and we type in the text game over okay and it will be shown oops game over all right and it will be shown for three seconds so we put in three okay then after that we go ahead and choose destroy all right bring that here and it will become self destroy okay now what we want to do next is we want to go to the red envelope file right here okay and we want to add an untouched player method okay and what we want is we want the treasure to disappear when the player gets it so we're going to drag a destroy block to the method okay becomes self destroy and not only that the player also gained a point from getting the treasure so we're actually going to click this plus sign right here to add a new block and we're going to choose player okay and then we're gonna get choose this one game point the player gain points and then place it right here all right now that we're done coding and code kingdoms we want to come back to roblox studio and we need to transfer the scripts that we made to their respective objects to run the project properly so we want to go ahead to view and open up explorer and we want to find replicated storage right here right replicate the storage click on the arrow in front of it and you should see kingdoms all right open it up and you should see your project and inside there's red envelope and score the two files we had all right we want to first of all get in this course script let's click on it and we want to right click and choose copy all right and then we want to find starter player right here okay and then we want to go to starter player scripts right and we click on it right click all right and then choose paste into okay so now there is the square script inside starter player scripts all right now the next thing we want to do is we want to go back to replicated storage and find red envelope all right wanna go ahead and click on it right click and copy and we want to go back all right and we want to find our red envelope parts right here okay 10 of them and we want to go ahead and paste into all of these red envelopes right click paste into all right all right now that we have done that we can go ahead and click play to test our project all right okay so as you can see now our countdown timer is working we find this find all red envelopes message just now and then we have players and red envelopes found let's go ahead and grab our first one so i remember that i hid one in the um subway okay so i'm gonna run inside and yep i spot it so we can go ahead collect it and you can see it disappears and i have one red envelope collected so that's all for today hope you like the video don't forget to subscribe and
