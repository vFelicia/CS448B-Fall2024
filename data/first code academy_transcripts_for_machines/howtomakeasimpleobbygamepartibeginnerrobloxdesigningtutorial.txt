hello everybody and welcome back to our channel here we share beginner friendly coding tutorials on scratch roblox minecraft web programming and many more today we're going to create a fun roblox game called easy hobby game this tutorial will be divided into two parts this is the part 1 of the tutorial in this tutorial we'll focus on the design of the game we'll learn how to use the part toolbox inside of roblox studio to play some blocks in which our character will jump over here we'll create cylinders and normal blocks while learning how to anchor blocks and duplicate blocks the main goal of the game is to reach the end to the fish pool right so let's get started to start let's create a project in base plate so let's go to new all templates and base plates here i'm gonna double click and wait for the server to load now i can move around by pressing the right mouse button and turning i can also use the wasd to control my movements first we should add our base plate so here we gonna go to home toolbox and we're gonna click to a box here and in the search bar we're gonna look up neutral spawn press enter and we should grab the first neutral spot and put it in our map make sure that we can see the symbol facing up so we know our character respond correctly next let's go to parts and let's click on blocks this will create a new block and we're going to be making three blocks so i can make two more blocks here by just clicking on parts and to edit the size i can go on to model scale and now i can edit the size of this box for the first box i'm going to make it the same size at this spawning um area and i'm gonna bring it high up a little bit higher like so and make sure between the three blocks are four stops in between i'm starting at the neutral spawn so four here and here i have four with this box back stretch the box out like so and i'm just gonna have a staircase pattern where the first one is the highest followed by second and then the third one will have the lowest height so again make sure there's four steps in between so one two three four now i'm going to stretch it the same width and stretch this out and i'll leave the highest exit we can also color these blocks if you want to make them more colorful and to color them we can click on the box we want to color model color and here we can pick whatever color that suits us i'm just going to pick um some random colors for these three blocks but you guys can mess around pick the colors you guys like now it's also important that we actually anchor these blocks um the point in the game is that after we remove this base plate the blocks will be remaining in the sky so to do this we should anchor so we're going to click on the box model underneath lock in group there's anchor so we press that and there's a gray highlighted anchor box um representing that we have successfully anchored it so we're going to do that with the other checkbox anchor anchor cool so now we shall add one more block so here i'll add another part and for this block we actually want it to be 20 length by 4 width to specifically change the width and length we can go down over here to properties we can go down to parts and underneath size we can change the numbers to fit what we want here right now this represents the width of this box and here we shall have 10 so let's put in 10 and i want this box to be 15 length so i'll change the width to 50 and this will give us a 10 by 15 block and i'm gonna drag it here and make it four blocks or four steps away from the third block like so and i'm going to change the color something like this and again i'm going to anchor it so press anchor now we're going to have have it so this block is anchored by a top block you have it anchored we should use the hinge but before we do that we should have a little anchor in the middle of this plank so we shall add another part here i'm going to stretch it out a little bit make it a little bit thinner like this and i'm going to place the in the middle of this plank and i'm going to change the color so i can distinct the two different blocks and again i want to anchor this now i'm going to create another block and this block will also be very long and very thin so here here i'll make the length to be 50 but the width i'll keep at four and um here i'm actually going to make this higher and to do that we can go up again to properties here i'm going to move up until i get the data position and the second value is the y value which is the height this i'm going to add 10. and then the this block will be increased and raised to 10 whoops like so just wider like this to add a hinge we should go to again model and underneath create we can click on this upside down triangle with unhinge here it's important that we start out from the bottom and so we can start here so we click in the middle and we're going to look up and click on the middle of this box creating a hinge connection so now we can see on the right side we have the hinge constraints and it's important to set this block not to anchor so leave it unchecked on the anchor and now if we actually go to play we can see that this block will be uh kind of hanging off this hedge hedge is also a movable joint um commonly found in doors it is a connecting part that connects the static part of the door to the moving part of the door and is also commonly seen in swings now let's continue with the second part of this obstacles so on the left side of the hinge platforms i want to add a block that is 12 blocks away so i'm gonna go to model parts and blocks and here i'm gonna scale it and i'm actually gonna manually type in the value so i can get exactly what i want here the first value should be 20 and the second value here should be 10 and i'm going to move it about 10 blocks away from the hinge so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and again it's important to anchor this now let's add a cylinder to add a cylinder i will go to home parts a cylinder but notice that the cylinder is actually upside down where the rounded is um side is on the side so that the character cannot actually jump on this otherwise sort of slip off to actually rotate it back we shall scale it first and the point is to scale it so that the round part is actually almost as well and the trick is to scale this as small as possible like a like a cube almost and that way we can actually rotate this without too much problems and now after we have rotated the right orientations we can scale it back up we can also adjust the height if you wanted to and again i'm gonna make this a tiny bit bigger and a tiny bit higher and once again we want to keep about four stubs between each block now it's time to add another platform here that is almost squares so we add block four steps away and here i want it to be 10 by 10 so i'm gonna go down to size first of all i'm going to change the 10 the third value i'm going to change it to 10 and move it four stubs away from this and now we're gonna duplicate these two blocks so we can select two these two blocks by holding the shift button over here we can see that they're selected we can right click duplicate and you'll duplicate these two blocks i'm just going to drag these two blocks to the right and continue dragging them four steps away like that and now we have our first kind of template of the course and again make sure that everything is anchored so i'm gonna anchor this cylinder anchor line this platform the cylinder should be anchored and this platform should be entered so basically the only thing that's not anchored here is this platform everything else it is anchored so this is basically the main part of our project for the remainder of the project what we're going to do is first we can select this base plate over here top right in the side of our explorer and we can simply remove it so we can just right click and press delete and you can see that will be our whole game but before we delete this actually i'm a command z so what we want to do is copy and paste this layer this lshaped layer into our map so that we can continue use this obstacles so to do that let's select on the explorer underneath uh underneath base plates let's select part and then let's select the last part and holding shift i'm gonna left click here which will select everything in between and now i'm gonna right click and press duplicate and it's important that in our model we have the move selected so now we can move the newly duplicated block any way we want so um i'm actually going to move it trish right next to the end of this block like so and for time purposes i'm going to start doing the fishing pond at the end you guys can mess with this however much you want and add and you know remove blocks as you will so to add the swimming pool in the grassland let's add a final block so i'm gonna go to model part block and here i'm gonna move to scale and make this a little bit bigger than the usual box like this and here instead of color i'm gonna go to materials i'm gonna go down middle to grass and i'm gonna change the color to uh green like this and now let's add in the swimming pool so here i'm gonna go to home i'm gonna go in toolbox and right here right next to where we looked up neutral spawn let's look up fish pond and we'll press enter to look and we're gonna grab the first one the fishpond by jz5245 and uh it's gonna be a little bit big so we're gonna click on scale and make this a lot smaller and then use move move to the center of the grassland and again don't forget to anchor this scratch block and yeah that's really it don't forget that the only thing we should not have anchored is these flying parts anything else should be anchored and now the last part of this project is to go back to explore scroll up until we see base plate and we can simply right click and delete and now our map will be completed and we can play um and the respawn is here and then we have to make our way through this parkour map and um the destination is going to be the fishing pole so that's all for today in the next video we'll go over how to use lua to change the cylinders color and directions don't forget to subscribe to our channel to check out next part for this project thank you bye bye
