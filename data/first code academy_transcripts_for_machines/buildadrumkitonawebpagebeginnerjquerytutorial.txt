hello everyone welcome back to our channel here is your big dinner friendly coding tutorials in scratch roblox minecraft programming and many more so today we are going to create a keyboard drum set with jquery well in this project you can see that we're using the drum set and then there's like a several instructions for how we produce sounds for this drum for example q is for crash so when i press q the sound will produce so before we start i just want to let you know that jquery is the library that's part of the javascript that does everything is reading and drop short form so let's get started so we'll begin by opening up the template of the project as you may notice html and the css so these and these has already been completed for us and some part of the jquery so we don't have to worry about the variables for a different uh sound produce well in this for time we're just going to look at a keyboard event and this will inform us in pressing a button and playing it sound so the first thing we have to do i'm just going to hide my html and css and go back to js so we have the variable and we're going to create some of the constants well we'll be using the contents since the values which is the sound of different keys we remain constant so it would it won't change uh for the sound whenever we press the key button so that's constant so let's do seven of those keys so constant constant q equals to 81 and constant a equals to 65 constant s equals 83 constant d equals to 68 and constant f equals 270 and constant t equals to 84 and constant x equals to 88 awesome so now we created all of these constant variables so the way to type it is in javascript where jquery is called constant const so this is a way of declaring a constant variable type well type in these seven constants while each constant to have should have a letter corresponding to the front page of the instructions so this number inside of values is the key code we have to add check if you want to find out more of that you can check out on keycode.info to check the corresponding keycode to each letter so all right so moving on we finish our first step and we are going to our second step as you can see that there is like the document.keydown function event so this is the down effect function which will perform some of the functions uh which is produce the sound and some animated effects for our keys so whenever we press the key button it will reduce the sound for the corresponding key and then well there are some other things that we do which is like we will change our title to h3 and we will going to animate the image to reduce the dramatic effect so whenever we press the key button it will pop it will kind of move up and down a little bit or enlarge a little bit so it kind of tells us that this is working like that so we have seven keys um we're going to start by creating the first key which is q so first of all we will start by giving it a condition so if defend which equals to q which means if the key we pressed is actually the key q so the thing we want to do uh we have three things i want to do so the first thing of course playing the sound so crash dot play which is the first function second one is we were going to use jquery so the dollar sign and then we're going to get the element img and dot anyway and we're going to set the width to 3 40 for this one so it kind of changed the width for this all right so we're just going to set the speed of this or the duration of this we're just going to set it to 20 so it's just going to move very quickly and i we are going to animate another width 350 20 as well so this is the animation for the size of our image the next one we're going to do uh we're just going to set our title to h3 as we said before so let's just get the element h3 and then dot html and then crash button pressed so you kind of indicate that oh we press the crush button oh yep all right so this is the keep eq now we can move on to finish the six of them yeah so for the other one which is a we did the condition right now and then we're going to change it to low tom delay and making the elements of the image again we're going to animate it again and then working to 35. oh and then we're going to take it to 20 as well and then animate and factory and 20 again and then the third thing we're going to do is change it to h3 again and then share now low tom as you can see now we finished two of the keys one of them is q and then the second one is eight so as you can see that actually both of them have really really similar codes right so after i will press each of these keys uh it will play some sound and then it will change our image animation and then we're going to change our title h3 title to something pressed so the like which part of the drum is being pressed or being played so okay so the one thing we can actually do uh in this project we can actually copy and paste for three four five six we're going to copy for five more times so so the only thing that is changing actually in this part well i'm just going to underline it with the color pink so the first thing we is different is the queue and then the second thing is play something to something of the elements play and then we're just going to stick with the uh width uh for each of the animation and then the third thing is changing is the low tom and then the crash button which is the h3 of the start of the h2 so three of these things only have like only difference from each other so the rest of our key buttons we will just change all of them with their corresponding sound and their corresponding letter so for the third one is actually s so s represents the time so and then i'm just going to change it to mid top okay and then the fourth one is actually d so d represents hi tom and we're going to change the high tom for the next one the f which is snare and then and then the last second last one is t and then which is high hat so changes hi hats and then the last one is x which has the kick and then your shoulders kick drum button first and basically that's it so well after we finish all of these you can actually try it out so we're just going to separate all of this again and then all right so here we go you can see our drum stretch that we're going to try it out again right now okay okay when i press a the low time is pressed and then when i press s the top and then for d high top and then for f snare and then for t i hat and then for x kick drum so that's it so basically that's all the things that we have to do well so that's it for today in this tutorial we created a drum kit with the use of jquery while jquery is a mini library for javascript which allows you to write code but in a more quicker and simplified way so hope
