everyone so today we're going to be creating a logo and this logo will be using scratch and we'll be using some pieces of code to create some shapes with the help of the pen tool and then with that pen tool we're going to create a design with some code and with our mouse which we're going to control with our hands so let's begin the project so first we're going to click on create over here and once you click on create we'll let it load our project page the next thing we want to do is we want to change this title here to recycle so after we're done changing the name the next step that we need to do is we need to remove this character here and what we're going to add inside is we're going to add a pencil tool so we can click on choose sprite and here we can click on pencil so as we have our pencil here we want to change the size to 50 i want to make it a not too big size next we want to click on costly so in costumes what we're going to add is we're going to add different colors so we're going to add orange green blue and if you like a fourth color you can add one too so i'm gonna add orange blue green and perhaps maybe black or yellow so we have two costumes over here so i'm just going to stick with this one and i'm going to change the costume name to orange and the next thing is i'm going to click on the paint tool then i'm going to click on this fill and i'm going to change it to orange this would be fine then you can just color this part here and color the tip and the next thing i want you to do is i want you to click on this here and use flip horizontally and now what we want to do is we press command a or you can use the mouse tool here and just drag it like this just to select the whole pencil and what we want to do is we want to drag it to here and the reason why is because when we're drawing we want the pencil to be the same point as our mouse pointer on the top so we can draw easily so once we have this then it's very simple to move on to the next step we just right click this duplicate take out the same costume and we can change this to another color so we can save the screen and then we color our pencil as green so here and here and then the next thing we do we duplicate it once again and then we can add one more color so this color can be anything that you like so i'm just going to use red so the next thing we want to click back on our orange we want to change this position so what we want to do is we move our mask to direction and click on this make sure this is clicked and then change this direction to negative look like that and so this way it will follow our mouse when we draw and if you want to check it out actually we can do that so we can click on code move our mouse to the plus to select our pen tool and then we can simply take out a pen down and then we can click on motion take out a go to block so we should find a go to block here just make this bigger we change this to go to mouse pointer and then we're going to click on control here so forever put that here and then we click on the create so what this means is whenever we when we start you could constantly follow our mouse and as you can see here it's perfectly following the mouse pointer when we draw so that's pretty good so after we have tested that just remove this click back on pen and then we're going to take out the erase ball so as this part is done we can leave our pen there for now the next part we want to start doing is we want to start adding our background and how do we do that it's pretty simple so we click on our backdrops here and then click this so right now we have this backdrop which is plain then we can change the costume so we can change the costume name to white dg so white background then you can command then you can click control right click okay and then here you can change this to blue this will be blue background so how do we get this color to be blue it's very simple we click on convert to bitmap once we're here we can change the brightness brighter and change the color here to blue then once you click the paint tool it will just paint it for you then once again we can press ctrl right click duplicate and then what we want to do now we want to change this color to a black background so change this to black there just click on this and then just change the name to black so white background blue background black background so we have three different backgrounds and what's going to happen is we're going to change the background color whenever we like and we're going to put in a command for this so the next part now is we're going to look into making a variable called pen size now this variable is very important as what it's going to do is going to help us change the pen drawing thickness when we draw our recycle sign so to begin that we're going to click on pen size here so we're going to click on the pen here and click on variables and click on make a variable and we're going to call this pen size so once that's done you can keep it for there for now and what we want to do with this want to make some changes so first we're going to click on control right click change it to slider so slider is another way of setting the value you can change it automatically by moving the slider as you can see here the value will change from 0 to 100 but we want to make some changes and those changes are we want to give it a minimum and a maximum value so we do the same thing we click control right click change slider range and we're changing the minimum value to 1 and the maximum value to 10 so as you change it can only go from 1 to 10. you can't make it any different you can't make it a lower number than 1 for a higher number than 10 so that's how we're going to select our pen thickness using the slider and variable so now we're going to begin our code what do we need first is we want to take out an event block so we click on events and we take out a when space key pressed so what this is going to do for us is going to erase all our drawings on our canvas that we have here so to enable that we click on pen and we take out erase all and then the next step is when we start our when we start our the next step when we want to start our recycle activity we click on the events and take our green flag click so when this starts we want to start by setting the pen size variable so to do that we click on variable we take out set my variable to zero and then click on pen size and then inside this zero we're going to add a and size variable and why you ask that it's because when we change the value we want it to be reflected so once i've changed it to five i can click here and know the value is five and i want to set it to that value that we choose the next thing i want to do is i want to change the costume of my pen so i'm gonna click on looks i'm gonna go down to switch costume and change it to orange the next thing i would like to add is i want my pen to be shown so i'm going to click on looks and i'm going to take out show over here and then the next thing i want to do is i want to set my pet color so i'm going to click pen color and as we're making a recycling sign we can change the end color to green so change the brightness here and actually instead of changing this to orange we can also change this to green so after that is done what we have done now is when we press on the space key it will erase all our drawings when we click on the green flag it will collect the information that we've put in the pen size and then it'll change our costume to green for the pen and then it'll show our pen and then it'll also change the pen's color degree so that is the first part done next part is we want to add a forever loop and the reason why is we want to put a piece of code inside that will constantly run forever so first we click on control and then as we scroll down as we scroll here we click on it forever and then inside this block we're going to add a set pen size so we take out the set size here so instead of making it to 1 we want to put in our variable of pen size so we click on variable take out pen size and put that there the next thing we want to add is a conditional so we want to say if the mouse is down we want to have the pen down otherwise the pen will be up what that means is we want to move our pen using our mouse but we only wanted to draw when we click on this background so to have that we click on control we take out an if then else and then we scroll down we head to sensing so that is over here and then we take out our mouse down so you see here it says false our mass is not down as yet but it will only get triggered when we click so checks if the mouse is down then we have our pen move down so we click on this put it here and then the next part is what would happen if the mouse is not done that means if we're not clicking we don't want to draw anything extra so we take another block that is called pen up okay so this part is done so what this does here is constantly it will check the pen size when you start and then you'll set the pen size to whatever value you select before you start our project and then when you do click on the background and move your mouse it will start drawing a trail just like how when you use a pen or pencil and you write on a piece of paper if you're not clicking on the background then what's going to happen is our and would be up it would be like you're just moving the pen but you're not writing anything and we don't want it to write anything we're not clicking because it would make our background look messy so so the next part now we want to look at is we want to change our costume and also the pen color so we're going to add some options for this so we're going to click on events and we can take out our when space key pressed and what we want to make here is we want to add duplicates so as you know we have four costumes right so here we have four i'll just drag this down so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to click on looks and then we're going to take out a switch costume to orange we'll do the same thing for this here this can be green do the same thing for here this can be blue and the last one can be red so we can change this option so what i suggest is you can use numbers or you can use alphabets both work so i'm going to use a number one so just scroll down to the numbers so this will be one this will be two this shall be three and this shall be four now if you feel that all the blocks are a bit clunked together that's fine you can move your mouse here click on control right click clean up and audio blocks will be cleaned up and the next thing we want to do not only when we press on these buttons we want them to change costume would actually like them to change their pen colors and that's also very simple we click on pen we take out set pen color 2 and then we can change the color here to orange so remember change the brightness increase your brightness and then here you can change the color and then the same thing goes over here you want to change this to green over here and then this we want to change it to blue so increase the brightness once again let me change this to blue yep i think that's fine and then we have red so we again take out segment color and then change this to the color red and then once again if it's all messy if you click ctrl right click clean up blocks and there right now you'll notice my pen is here so i'll just drag it to show you so i can click on two three four one two three four it changes color and also the tip so next thing we want to look at is we want to have our pen move so to do that we're gonna take out a event block and this block is called when this spread clicked so when you click on this pencil we wanted to do a certain action and that action will be to follow our mouse so we click now on control then we take okay forever put that here and then click on motion and we'll check out a go to block put that here change this to mouse pointer right so the next thing we want to add is that when we start also we want our pen to glide to a certain location so we can click on events here take out when green flag clicked and then click on pen and take out and up and then underneath we want to take out a glide so click on motion we got a glide block here we're going to change this to 77 and then 123 and then we want it to point in a certain direction so we click on motion take a point in direction and we change this to 120 degrees so what's going to happen is when we click on the green flag the pen will go up it will glide to a certain position and then we'll point to 120 degrees so next what we want to add is we want to add a triangle so to do that it's very simple we have done it before click on control take out a repeat three so repeat 10 we change this to three as a triangle as three sides one two three then we take click on pen and take out the end down and what we want to do is we want to set the pen size so we click on the set and size here click on variables and add in our pen size here so what we want to do next is we click on motion okay move 10 steps change this to 50 and then we have it turn right by 120 degrees so we take this out put it here and change so after that's done we want it now to glide to another position so simply what we want to do is we don't need to keep on drawing another line after it's drawn a triangle we want it to move somewhere without making another so we click on end up put it here and then after that we once again want to glide to a certain position right here and we want to change the coordinates to minus 180 and then the y we want to change it to 80. next we want it to point at a certain direction so we click on point in direction and we change this to 30. underneath it once again we want to make the same code here as we're making a triangle once again so you click on control take out a repeat three so repeat three times then it's the same thing we want our pen to go down then underneath it we want to set the pen size we take a set pin size 2 and we want to set it to our variable that is here and then under this we want to click click on motion take out the move 50 steps here and then we want it to once again turn right by 120 and then the next thing is we wanted to make another triangle because we've already made the first one and the second one now we need to look on making the third one so once again we click on and take out the pen up here and then the next thing is we want to glide to a certain position so here glide and then we want to change this position to minus 5 and then we want to change the y to minus 47. so once that's done we want it to point again in a certain direction so we go to point n direction here minus 16. then once again we want to put air deep so we click on control take on this changes to three and then click on pen again and take out a pen down and then we want to set pen size 2 and we're going to change this once again to our variable and size and then once again we wanted to move 50 steps all right so as of now we're done with our project so let's look at our code here now we can look at our project and press the green flag let's see so it's going to make three triangles and then what we can do we click on it then we can then we can draw a line here here and we've made a recycle sign so you can add more color you can design it however you want and that is the end of our project and one more thing you can also re restart it by pressing stop and then start and then change your pen color so if you want to make it even bigger so that can be done you can press space click again your triangle can get bigger this is the end of the video i hope you like making the project if you liked this video please make sure to like share this video and also
