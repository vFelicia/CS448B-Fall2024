welcome back so last lesson we have in last video we set up our projects balloon pop and we're now back in our project interphase we're going to have a tour around the designer interface of App Inventor so the App Inventor interface is divided into 4 columns you can see on the screen here the first one is the palace area the second part is the viewer where you can see the screen and how your app look like the third column is your components and media which is really what has been added onto your phone already the fourth column is properties now let's walk through every single column what it does and how we can use that so number one is our palette the palette is where we can find our components and drag them on the viewer and add them to your app this is really just like a palette when you're painting or when you're mixing matching colors where you can find any components you really need to add to your app the palette is divided into several categories themselves as well if you look into the palette the always the default is always user interface which are the buttons checkbox date picker image label etc so these components are organized by alphabetical order and after the user interface category you will be able to see layouts which is horizontal arrangement you can see horizontal scroll arrangement etc don't worry if you don't know what these components are about yet we will be learning all of these components step by step once we start building apps just want to show you a few more categories of pallets here we have media which is all sorts of fun things like the camera the image picker player sound we also have the drawing and animation category which is the ball canvas and image sprites very useful for for anytime you want to build a game also feel free to explore other categories here including the maps the sensors and social etc now after the palette we move on into the grand center of the screen which is always a viewer the viewer is really where you can drag your components from the palette to the app that you're designing so this is where you can see so view right so you can see what your app will look like right next to the viewer there is the components components and media is really where you can see what has been added onto your app so far later on as we're adding more and more components and as we're adding more media maybe it's an image or is a sound file you're gonna start to see this column getting populated with components and several media files next we have our properties the properties is where you can select a specific components and changes properties there so right now we only have one components on our screen which is arm screen one component so the screen itself is component as well with App Inventor and since is already selected you can see that we can changed several properties underneath we can change properties that are related to the screen one thing very straightforward is to change the apni so we talked about how in App Inventor it doesn't allow us to have space when it comes to naming our projects you're free to change however your app is called on the App Store and how you can change that is basically updating the app name property here and the straightforward thing that I would change is to have a space next to my app and there we go so you are able to see the balloon pop app now has a space in between it's easier for people to read so on and so forth we can also change the background color of our app and you can also change this is one of my favorite to change as well you can also change the title of the screen currently the titles cost green one and it's probably not necessary for us to tell out user that this is screen one so I'm gonna just change it to also my app name balloon pop so there we go this is pretty much our designer interface there are a few other components on the designer interface that we can play around with so on the top front here you can see that their screen 1 you can also press at screen and if I want to do that I can say ok and it would jump right into screen 2 for me so for now for the beginner version of the apps we are going to do screen 1 only and yeah let's now jump into the blocks area so for now we're going to focus on so for now we're gonna focus on only one screen apps don't worry we will always add more screens in future more complicated apps and there we go we can talk out between designer interface and blocks interface by pressing these two buttons and now let's jump into the blocks interface
