hello everybody and welcome back to our channel here we share beginner friendly coding tutorials on roblox scratch minecraft web programming and many more today we will be making a fun and exciting project in scratch junior here's a preview to our project in the first scene we have our title for the uh game space invaders and then when we click on the start we enter the actual game where you see aliens appear and disappear at their own rates here we can control the rockets by clicking on the two arrow keys left arrow key to move to the left right to the right and we shoot by pressing the red button yeah let's get started so we're going to start by creating a new project on scratch jr so let's go to home and let's click on new project and the first thing we're going to do in a new project is delete our character click we do that by holding left click over here and we can delete it and now we can change our background to do that we click this picture up here and we can pick the bottom right picture of the moon and the earth press okay next let's make the second slide of our game so here we can click on this button which will make a new screen for us and again we'll be doing tech so hold left click delete and we're going to change the background picture to this space picture the one next to the moon and now let's go back to our first scene with the moon in the earth and we're going to click on this abc button and we're going to write space invaders and this will be the title of our game and over here we can change the color so let's change it to white and press enter and here we have it we have space invaders um circado so now let's add a button for our user to go to the actual game so here you can add a sprite by pressing a plus key and here we scroll down until we find the star which is right here and we can make the start a little bit bigger by going over here to the purple uh person button click on the first one and just double click it a couple of times and that will actually help activate this function which is increasing the size of the star after we're done we can drag this function out and our star will remain the same size now we should add the code for the star so when we click on it it goes to the next screen um so the first thing we want to do is take the wing click on events controller and now we want to go over here to the red blocks and drag in this block over here and now when we click on double star it will bring us to the next screen just like that so for this game we will need eight characters a rocket a bullet three aliens and three user buttons and the three user buttons will have a left arrow key a right arrow key and a shoot button so let's get started so the first thing we'll do is make the rockets so i already have to save up but the rockets is all the way at the bottom so you can go all over the bottom rockets correct and we don't have to focus on resizing this rockets for now and now let's do the controls so to do the controls we actually draw them by hand so to do that we add a new sprite and over here at the top left we have an empty picture and it says character and we'll actually use this paintbrush key to edit this character so first thing first we can just write left arrow and change the title and over here we want to click on the weft and the method strokes so here we want it to be freestyle and let's make the color yellow and let's draw our arrow just like this and when we're done we can press the uh done button at the top right now we have our left arrow and we're going to do the same thing for the right arrow so once again adding sprite character edit character let's change the name to right arrow and the settings are saved for us so let's use draw on it just like that and once again it's fine that it's looking a little bit big um and then finally we want to shoot button and then here i just want a big red circle so add sprites on this character edit character and over here i'm going to change from freestyle to drawing circles and i'm going to change from yellow to red i can just drag over like that and draw a circle when you fill out the circle i can use this paint brush tool click in the middle and you'll fill up the whole character don't forget to uh change this to make this i'm gonna need this button click okay flip between our arrow keys and this would be all for now so now we're gonna create our bullets and three aliens so to make the bullets we can draw on this so create a new sprite new character and then paint brush here we change this title to bullets and instead of using freestyle or circle we're going to use a triangle or a rectangle option make the bullets green and drag it like this and again to fill it we can use this fill tool press okay now for our bullets and before we make our aliens let's just resize everything so using the same method as before we can actually go on each one no one this size down buttons click each one twice drag it up click twice drag it up put in here click it twice and we'll just very quickly resize everything down okay and let's do the rocket as well lens awesome and now let's just reposition everything you want the boats to be inside of rockets to arrow key speed exclusion like this i think my left arrow key isn't too big so i'm just gonna resize it one more time just like so and now we should make our aliens so again we're gonna draw on this so let's click on the create sprite new sprite and uh let's edit our character let's change the name to alien and we can use the furry style and uh they could work and use brown and just draw any shape here you can uh draw any shape use the filler tool fill the whole thing up use the circle option and use red eyes and just form the eyes for the alien again we're going to use fill tool to fill up the middle and this would be our alien and now let's just duplicate this we can do this by clicking plus and the alien we just made will be saved over here as you can see um i've made this once already so all of my previous tries have been saved here so we're going to use the most recent alien that i made and we're going to add two more we're at two of them in total just like so so now let's program the application so we can actually shoot and control with the rockets so here we want the arrow keys to move our rockets while the red button to shoot so let's go on the left arrow button and we're gonna click right click on and we're gonna use this option which will send a signal and if you press on the down arrow key it will drop down to six different colors and basically you will associate the type of signals with the color so here let's assign our left arrow key to this orange signal then we have to close off our block you say the end of block on the right and let's do the same thing for the right here we grab the one click on events signal and this time let's change the right arrow signal to yellow so we have the orange for left and yellow for right now we'll end it with this over here and final step we add the button so again you can select the button by either clicking in game or on the left now grab one click done send to signal and here i'm going to use the same color slip button red make it a little bit easier for myself to remember once again close it up and that will be our whole uh controls for the rockets so now let's program the bullet so for the bullets we want a couple of things first we wanted to move where the rockets is moving so we should give the same commands as uh the rockets in terms of movements secondly when the red button is clicked on we want to set the bullets up and then come back so that it will be the same place the rocket ready to fire it again so to do this we can first hide the rockets at the beginning of the game that way the user can't see it and when the red button is clicked we show the bullets it goes up it hides again and then comes back down from just being invisible so that the user can't see it coming back i can only see it going up so let's do that so first we want the green button or the green flag to be clicked on and make it invisible so to make it invisible go to the purple side this invisible character and now while we add it we want to set the speed of the bullet so we can do that by clicking on the orange blocks select the sky running click on the down drop and click on the fastest option which is would be the one with the most horizontal lines combine it close up close it off next we want to do the movement of the bullets and once again this will be the same as the rockets so here once we receive a signal either from orange or yellow remember orange is left and yellow is right here let's do the left so upon receiving orange signal we want to move and use this blue controls to move and we can use the left dash move it once and that's it close it and now let's do the right arrow upon receiving signal and this should be the yellow signal we want to use the right dash one to the right like that and for the shoot we know we want to receive the red signal and here we wanted the show itself so let's show itself show the bullets fly forward and let's apply for it and let's change this number to seven and then this will reach the top of the screen and after it does you want to make that visible and drop back seven so that it will be at the same location as the rocket changes to seven awesome bend closed and we're done with bullets let's continue with our rockets so here our rocket says two things it moves based on the arrow keys and at the start of the game when the green flag is clicked on we'll start the movement of our alien so it will go invisible and invisible within the timer making us have to hit them when it's visible so here for the movement it will be the same thing as the bullet so upon receiving an orange signal and we know that's a left turn we'll move it one to the left closing and now upon receiving a yellow signal which we know is a right arrow key we'll move it one to the right and close it up and finally when the green flag is clicked on we want to set the speed of our kit of our uh rocket and set it to the fastest and now we also want to send a signal to the aliens so here we'll have send signal and here we can send a green signal a new one that the alien will be checking for again close it that will be for aliens or that will be for all for our rockets and let's move to the aliens so for the aliens we want them to start being invisible and visible within the timer after the green flag is clicked on and we already know that our bullets over here follows our as follows our rockets which are rockets would then send a signal upon having the green flag to our aliens so here we want to check for the green flag so upon receiving the green flag we can start the process of invisibility and turning invisible and visible within the timer so to do a timer we can first add 10 seconds and change the set to 5 and you're going to say for after 5 seconds be invisible and have another timer this time we can keep it as 10 and uh here we want to turn it to visible and we want this to repeat so we're going to use the repeat end over here just like that and finally when it hits or gets hit by the bullets we want the alien to turn invisible so here we go back to the events when this sprite is touched we want to set sprite 3 into symbols that would be all and this is the last part of the project um this is a whole game we should copy the same exact code over here to the other two aliens so let's do that really quickly events check green flag and here we can actually change the timer settings a little bit you can have 10 seconds to be invisible and then wait five seconds and you'll turn physical so this basically will turn visible for 10 seconds and then turn it invisible and then after 5 seconds turn back visible and again when it's touched on i want it to be invisible that'll be all yes let's move on to our last alien when we see it's free signal let's wait five seconds turn invisible and again wait five seconds turn invisible again these numbers you guys can change around to your likings finally we have the collision in which we turn it invisible at the end that's all for today hope you enjoyed it don't forget to subscribe and like our videos also check
