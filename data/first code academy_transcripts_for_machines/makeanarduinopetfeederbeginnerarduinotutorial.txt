hello everyone welcome back to our channel here we share beginner friendly coding tutorials in scratch roblox web programming and many more so today we are going to create a pet video control using things cad and arduino as you can see this is our copy of the pathfinder control so there are like different led lights and then there's like buttons and then there's like a micro like this is like the feeder theme so it will kind of spin so what are we going to do is actually we're going to push the button so it kind of makes uh some light it's going to light up but yeah so the light's going to light up so it depends on how long um for example just going to wait for 1 minute or five minutes or 15 minutes like that afterwards it's just gonna spin so it kind of works like a pet feeder thing so let's get started so we'll start by uh creating our uh board first so there are some few things that we require for example uh we need uh five resistors uh four to seven d ohm resistor and then one tank k on resistor and then there one button and four led lights um a small breadboard um arduino uno r3 and then there's a very special thing it's called microcircle so uh first of all we're just going to drag the arduino uno out three out first and then put it uh slightly at the bottom of the screen and where is the okay i'm going to search for the mini breadboard yep i'm gonna place it on top of our arduino uno a little bit top and now we're going to put the led lights uh on top of the breadboard uh top left corner and we're gonna put four of them so making to horizontal line with all the uh the lights and for the resistor uh we're going to put four of them uh on the middle right uh inside the arduino uno so perform first all right of all of them i make sure to change it to 270 ohm for each resistor all right so okay we finished our setup inside a board uh but however we still have the push button and also a 10k ohm resistor uh we're not gonna put it inside a breadboard instead we're just going to put it uh in between the mini breadboard and then us as well as like the arduino so we're just a little bit and then the resistor i'm gonna put it next to the red button uh make sure that it's like 10k right so uh the last thing we're gonna uh get from this components are microservo which is the most important part actually so we're gonna put it next to the arduino uno on its right side so right basically we're done now we can do some wiring so the right leg of each led lights i connect them with each of the resistors so the first i'm gonna then get that the likes of the resistor for the left leg uh we're going to connect them with the dnd which is the ground so find the intersection between the first right led leg and then the resistors and it's the whole like that so we're just going to click on that and then we are going to link it to the gnd so all right so this is the gnd the ground and all we have to do is link our right leg of our resistors to the ground so we created almost create finish the circuit uh all we have to do is actually um blinking our wires back to our pins so connect our four resistors to pin 11 two pin eight right now we finish all of our connections between the breadboard and then the led lights so the next part uh we're going to connect our button with our uh already know unl and then make it into a circuit so first of all link your top left leg of your button to pin 12 like that and then for the positive one which is the y which is the power one we are going to get our bottom right leg of our button and then we're going to connect them to our five volts pin here so we connect them awesome so uh the only one left is actually the resistor so uh for your bottom right at bottom left leg okay so extend stand it and then connect with our tanky resistor and then afterwards we're going to connect the bottom part of our resistor to the ground again so that's it okay so this we finish our led lights and then our buttons uh there's nothing uh on the top right corner of our button so don't worry about that all right so for our micro circle uh there are three pen uh on top of that so for the left one uh actually that's the ground so obviously we're going to connect it to the ground inside our uno so it's extended and then connected to the ground together all right so in the middle one that is actually the power wire so we're going to connect it with our five volts again with our button so all right so the last one is actually connected to the pen it kind of works with it so right the last one drag it out connect it to pin three all right so basically we finished uh the setup of our thing so we can actually move on to according so first of all uh inside our coding part uh we are still at the box part but uh and this project uh so it's like that's a little bit more fun so we are not going to use the uh blocks so change it to text so like that now before uh setup and loop and declaring any type of fields we have to do something with the include circle since this is like a extension so we have to get the hashtag include in the circle club h so this one all right afterwards we are going to do some uh declaring some field first uh first of all we are going to change our wait time for scalar so now we're going to get it constant long prescaler and our prescaler is basically one minute so six thousand six hundred sixty dollars sixty thousand milliseconds so this is the perspective and later on we're just going to change uh our time interval between uh for example 1 to 15 minutes or 5 minutes to 70 minutes something or longer time so all we're going to use is this prescaler and now declare our zero type minus variable and uh we're going to set our timestamp pin as 12 like our button so so this is our time set pen and now we're going to uh set that led pen so those are the time work so white one then one equals to pin eight and i'm going to copy and paste for three more times because it's four and nine content and eight all right so we are also setting our time set input as one uh our pet so fight time that input equals one so okay so in order to avoid our button command execute multiple times uh we have to create a boolean which is button activated equal to false all right so for our next uh thing we're just going to set up our time stamp and now we're going to do the timer counter so long time to row equals 0 correct now we finish all our declaration of our fields so we can actually move on to our site uh first of all we have to set up our leds we have to set up our buttons and our server so three things now we are going to get the pin mode first and our uh first minute so which is our pin eight and i'm going to copy this four three times again since it's like oh four pin nine 10 11 so two minutes four minutes and eight minutes all right so for our next thing uh we are going to digital write our personal markers high so this is like um every time we start our setup we're just going to have like the uh the first minute a one minute countdown as our like default setup so all right so for our next thing we're going to set our time to row as our times that input times our prescaler so time to roll equals to titan's long and time set input and times free scalar like that and well first of all we're going to set our pendulum that's our output 5 13 and we're going to set our time step pin as our input with that okay the next thing we're going to do is actually we're going to attach our pin 3 to our circle control so this is like oh the original position right zero equals so row time mark oops tar mark equals two milliseconds and we're going to begin our server all right so for the purpose of debugging we actually want to print out something for testing so zero primes time to roll and zero 45 to grow and dinosaur current prescaler and serial friends line three let's go all right let's finish our setup for all the buttons led lights and as well as like our server so for the lip part uh we have a couple things to do first of all we are going to see if our button is actually pushed um we also want to see our time input and to do something to wait until it's kind of turned for our feeder so first of all we're going to do our first condition which is if our button is activated which is um true so if button activate it and now 400 oops it's last time equals to and if this happens we want to actually see some changes so button activated equals to the pulse all right so this is our first condition for our second condition we want to check how if but it is not activated and then we want to see our time 10 times that pin so how many minutes we have set it to so f digital read time set pen and not button activate it all right so if our digital read times are premium uh not back back to notified it we want to set something so time set input equals to time set and put plus one and well since we are going to limit our time so input the max maximum value to 15 since we only have four led lights so that's like the maximum value uh for uh the indicator so we're just going to set it if we want to be like larger than 15 we're just going to set it back to one so if all right set and put if larger than 15 we are going to set we are going to set our times and put back to one like that different uh more than 15 okay so we're going to set our digital right back to low for all albums okay now i'm going to copy two times four minutes and eight minutes mark so yeah and then well uh we're going to uh check our pens or after if that's a if that's actually high or low so so we are going to set up some boolean uh some local variables so right so for our which is fit read time set then put zero like that so yeah three more times put one two pick three and we just one two and three like that okay so for all these f fit zero for example uh we are going to digital write our first minute mark as high so and for output one two three as well like that so after that we're going to calculate the wait time for our next row so time to roll equal to 1. time set and third and times pre scalar okay so uh we're going to activate our button again if it's true okay so the next thing uh just for the debugging purposes we're going to do some zero print line time set and good time to roll and zero prince line it's time to uh so these are the debuggings for our first condition so for our second one we are going to roll our circle after we read all of our pens so if uh the our server only row only if the time is actually larger than our counter taxer row time mark that's larger than time to row like that and we're going to do something again okay so my circle right 180 so it's gonna turn 180 degrees and then delay for two seconds then change back to its original position yeah okay so uh we're going to uh save our current row time for our next row so that's why we have to do our row time mark as well row time mark and milliseconds and for our debugging purposes as well we are going to print some 0.9 and server so we finish our second condition so for our uh for our third thing we have to do is our the only thing we have to actually update our current times right now equals two milliseconds so yeah okay so uh for our onboard led uh we actually wanted to have like work on something as well but this is not as important as the first to ash condition but we're going to do that too so now and our digital rate is not equal to 13. we're going to digital right uh our 13 is high and also that's 13 and um our time right now that's the last time equals to 140 and we're going to digital right our 1013 is low so basically that's it for our project uh for our coding part so we can actually try it out uh it should be great i should be doing something before okay so there are some problems with my code uh we're going to debug that right now yeah so it's working um yeah capitalize agent different capitals and as well as like this spelling really really affects your code okay so it's actually working so you can see that it's like counting out right now so like seven or eight seconds uh we're not going to wait until one minute but yeah so here's the code so that's all for today so in this tutorial uh we create a pet feeder control using arduino and papercad and inside of think yeah we also use my circle like the circle control well i hope you like this video and don't forget to subscribe our other videos um also check out the the two of them um while you're waiting for the next video so thanks
