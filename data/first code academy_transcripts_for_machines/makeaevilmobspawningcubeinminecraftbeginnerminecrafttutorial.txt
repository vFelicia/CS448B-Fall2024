hello everyone welcome back to our channel here we make beginner fun friendly tutorials on scratch app inventory thunkable minecraft roblox and much more so in today's video we're going to look at how we can make an evil mob in minecraft with the use of m creator so let's begin this project utilizes artificial intelligence to have our mob i think for itself we're also going to design a block for it to spawn we're also going to learn about how we can make use of ticks to have them spawn on top of our blocks and with the use of ai we're going to have these mobs look at us and then attack us so let's look at how this project is going to look like so now we're going to begin our project first of all please open m creator as we'll be designing and coding our project here to begin with we click with the plus sign over here and then click on living entity as i've used the name evil mog here i can use evil mob or i can use evil zombie then we click on create new living entity once we're here we have an entity model we're going to leave it at bypad here we have a name of an entity the next part it asks is the texture of the entity this means say what will our character look like right now i have three over here but as we're making a new one i'd like you all to head to open your browser on google chrome and we'll have a page here called pixel art and what happens with this is we want to create an image which is 16 by 16. so you can click on create new drawing and click ok once we're here i have an image of a character which i've downloaded i will click on file click on open image and then i will select this image here so click on ok so once that's done over here i've added this image but if you notice it's a bit too complex and put on side so what we're going to do is we're going to click on resize and we're going to change this to 16 by 16 and then it's going to resize this drawing now this is what comes up you can take in any image and just resize it to 16 by 16 and then you can color it inside so i'm going to use a different bunch of colors select any colors you like in this color in once that's done you can click on file and then download here make sure the width and height is 16 by 16 and then click on download png and then here you can just place this back here and then change the name so you can put zombie make sure it's dot png once we're done we can just minimize this window here and then we can click on plus find our image from the desktop and then click on zombie once that's done you'll see your image over here next we can click on behavior make sure it's set to mod and then we need to give it an item so here we click on this type in x i'll given hey diamond x next we click on particles we don't have to add anything over here and we click on inventory we don't have to add anything over here then click on triggers we'll be looking at this section a bit later on and then we click on ai and goals so make sure you enable the ai for the ability for our entity to think here for entity base we're going to change this to zombie next over here as we see the tasks higher on the list have a higher priority this is first second third fourth and fifth what we can do is change things over here by bringing this up clicking on combat tasks and then taking out attack placing this here and we can check only inside and nearby then we can click again to see if anything extra we want to add if we're done adding we can click and move this back over here and click on spawning to see if anything's missing so after we're done we can click on save mod element so evil zombie is done over here next we want to make in a block so we're going to click on this and click on block and we're going to call this the evil zombie block click on create new block so for this we need also a texture what i would suggest is heading back to pixel art over here and creating a new image file new click reload just make sure that the picture is 16 by 16. so new drawing make sure that with the 16 same goes for the height once that's done click on new drawing click on ok so now we just have to make the pattern of the block you can use any design you like i'm just going to make it very simple after i'm done i'm going to click on file and then i'm going to download this image so we click on download png after this is done we can drag this image over so you here minimize that i'm going to change this to the name of zombie okay next what we need to do is we need to select this and then click on import click on this and select the block that we need here and once that's done make sure that the block model is single texture and then we leave these items here so we leave this we change the properties so the material we're going to use is iron and the block sound here we're going to change it to metal the creative inventory tab we're going to leave this here as we don't have to change it to anything else as it's a block next we click on advanced properties then we click on tile entity energy triggers and then generation so as of now we're going to click on save mod element here so we've added this now we're going to look at making the procedure for our evil zombie we'll click on plus here and then click on the procedure block so let's find that here we can call this evil zombie procedure and then click on create new procedure once that's here we can click on logic and then here we can take out a not block and put this over here then we click on flow control take out a if then statement and then let's duplicate it and place another one inside here we're going to put if not and then inside here we're going to click on the i'm going to click on world data and take out can location and xy said see this guy and here it says if do what we're going to do here is we're going to click on math and take out a random block and then click on math and here we have plus so we're going to click on logic and take out this equal sign here and find the more than block and place that over here next we're gonna put in the random zero one and place that over here next we need to add in a math block put in zero then add in here zero dot eight so we're gonna change that over here so in order to spawn our zombie we're going to click on world management over here and then take out spawn x y so we're going to take this out make sure that the living entity you are clicking on is the evil zombie bomb here so custom evil zombie and then here we want the zombie to be placed on top of the box so we click on math take out the plus sign and then put in y here and then we're gonna add in a number over here i'm gonna add in a number two once you place this you click on save mod element once that's done with our procedure this is the procedure here what we're going to do next is we're going to click back on the evil zombie block head back to triggers and in update take i'm gonna put the evil zombie procedure and then click save mode element next we're gonna run our block click on evil zombie block and click on this to run it over here and that will open up minecraft after minecraft is open click on single player open your new world and wait for it to load once it's loaded we're gonna take out our block and then place it make sure you're in creative mode to check your inventory for the block and then we'll see what we have to do next press on e click on search items you can type in zombie and you'll see the block here evil zombie block place this over here and replace this and then our mobs should appear so you can see our mobs appearing but as we're in creative mode it won't do anything we'll have to press slash game mode s and then for survival press tab press enter once you go in front of them they'll start attacking you as you can see here i'm being attacked and then i die so this is how we're done with our project and this is what the project looks like thank you very much for watching our videos we
