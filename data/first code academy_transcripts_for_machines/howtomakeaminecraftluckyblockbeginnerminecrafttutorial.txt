hello everyone so today we'll be making a lucky block in minecraft using m creator and in this project we'll have a block where you break it and it will either give you one of two options you'll get a diamond armor set or a diamond sword with a tnt depending on a random number so let's begin making this project so now i'll be showing you a demo of the lucky block so what's going to happen first is i'm going to take out a lucky block from my inventory i'm going to place it on the grass so let's begin i'm going to press e i've been lucky and then i'm going to take out the block and place it here so once i have this block i'm going to place it on the grass over here so i'll place one here there's one over here one over here and then another one here so i've placed four on the graphs over here so what's gonna happen is it's gonna randomly pick a number from zero to one so if it's bigger than 0.5 then it's going to say it's more than 50 percent otherwise if it's less than 0.5 it's going to say it's less than 50 so the items that i'll get is a diamond sword and a tnt or i'll get a diamond armor set which includes a diamond helmet a diamond leggings and diamond chestnut so right now i'm going to remove this by using clear i'm just going to use my hand i'm going to break this so here as you see in the chat it says that i have an armor and pnt and it says more than 50 now i'll just remove this then let me break this so i got a number that's bigger than 0.5 i break this here again i get the same thing bigger than 0.5 if i break this now it says it's lower than 0.5 and you can see here i get my diamond armor so i get all these items then i'll break the last one so this is bigger than 0.5 more than 50 so this is how the random block is going to be made and we can choose whatever we want to add in these boxes we'll be beginning our project so first open your google chrome or safari window and head to pixelart.com and start a new drone once you're there make sure that you change your height to 16 in your width to 60 and click on your drawing over here and then click ok once you're on the canvas you can start drawing your lucky block so what i like to do is i like to use the square tool and then i click on any color over here which i want so say i pick on blue i can just make a little square here and then i can see that i've taken one two three four five let me take the same amount of space here then i will do the same thing here so you can depends on how you want it if you think you don't like it you can remove it like this with the eraser tool and then just select another color so i'm gonna maybe use red and then you can use a paint tool and color it inside so maybe i'll pick this color and then for this you can pick any other color you like so there this is my lucky block then if you want to write some sort of writing you can do the same you can go select a color maybe this and i think i'll just write a simple hi next i want to download this image click on download and then i click on download png so let's save to my computer over here so in the next part i want to open my amp creator and start making my lucky block so now that my amp creator is open i want to start making my lucky block i click on plus and then i click over here at blocks then i'm going to call this lucky lock then create a new block now i'm created at this stage to add in the image for my block so here i can click on bottom main and then here i can click import so once i click that it shows me a window as to where do i want to get the image from click open and if there's a file that already exists with the same file name i can just change this to lucky block drawn click ok then i have it here i can click on this and i've selected it here and i can do the same for this this this here this here and this here again so once that's done i won't have to edit anything here go to properties i can leave this alone same thing for advanced properties same thing for tile entity same thing for the energy and fluid storage and then triggers now triggers is where i want to run a procedure i'm going to run it under the part where the block is destroyed by the player so here i'm going to click on plus and this is going to be called lucky block block destroyed by player then i click on create procedure so right now what i want to do is i want to click and use a variable so over here it says local variables i can click on plus i can change this to a number and i'm going to call this random click okay so now i have a block here that says custom variables i'm going to click on it take out set local random and then here what i'm going to do is i'm going to click on the math block and then we have random 0 1. so what this does is it picks a random number between 0 and 1. next what i'm going to do is i'm going to take out a conditional so that will be under the flow control here and i'll take out a if then so what i'm going to do now is i'm going to click on a logic block and i should be able to find the more than so i'm going to click on this and then here is the more than block i'm going to place this here now what i want to do in this part is i want to get the information of what the number is in random do that i'm going to click on my custom variable and i'm going to use get local random this block will help me get the information now i want to check if the number is higher than a 0.5 so i'm going to click on math take out the zero block here put it inside and change this to 0.5 after that's done i can now spawn in anything i like here i'm going to click on word management then we're going to find a block that says spawn gem so i'm going to take this out place this here and make a copy and then another copy so here and here and then one more here so now what i'm gonna add inside is this here i'm gonna add in a sword so i'll click on a diamond sword i want to give the diamond sword to the player if when they break the block it's bigger the number picked is bigger than 0.5 and then here if the number is smaller than that then i just want to give them a tnt or instead if you want you can give them a armor set so you can put in diamond then you'll see here the helmet so what happens here is when you break the block if the number you get is bigger than 0.5 you'll be given a sword but when you break the block and that number is smaller than 0.5 then you'll be given the armor set of a helmet chest plate and leggings and we can even add in a message here so you can have this send message and then put these two blocks here and add in another bunch of blocks here so you can see here you get a diamond and then this you can say higher than 50 percent here you can say you get a diamond on set then here you can say lower than 50 and that is our procedure and then we can save this here so once that's in here when you break the block this is what will happen then we'll click save mod so right now we have our procedure and then we have our blocks so i'm going to show you what it looks like when we test out the project once that's done you wait for this console to load you can monitor the procedure here and wait for it to load here then once that's done you can open it by clicking on play then you can click back on console to monitor how it's running and then we'll wait for minecraft to load up after minecraft is loaded you can click on single player and then i'll just delete this and start a new world make sure you're in creative mode click on create new world so once we're here we'll begin by going to a plane area click on e and then click on search items and find our lucky block here so i'm gonna place it here so one two three and then four hello piggy then four over here so we have these four blocks and then we have a pig so the pig will be roaming around while we break these blocks so let's begin so break one we got lower than 50 we got a diamond armor set okay nice so i'll just clear everything inside slash clear now let's break the second one again we get a diamond armor set so this time it's still less than 50 so let's try clearing it again let's break this so we got now higher than 50. we got a sword right let's break the last one get another sword so it just depends on what number is picked and depending on that you get these items inside so higher than 50 we get a sword more than 50 percent we get a diamond if you enjoyed this tutorial please make sure to like share and subscribe to first code academy on youtube for more fun filled tutorials such as
