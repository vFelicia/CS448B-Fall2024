hello everyone welcome back to our channel here we share beginnerfriendly tutorials on minecraft roblox scratch web programming and many more today we're going to be learning how to create a drum kit in scratch so let's get started let's take a look at this project first before we get started and we will see how it works so as you can see any of the drum parts is like you're a certain town of close to that all right great let's get started on how to make this project okay so first of all we will start by creating an empty scratch project and then we will delete our cat sprite first mode okay next what we're going to do is we're going to search for a drum kit image online now i've already found one and downloaded it on my computer what you want to do is also find one for yourself and you can go to backdrops and then upload that drum kit image onto your project so a good example of finding a drum kit on while you're searching for it could be searching drum kit game view and you can get something which is like this as well now this is pretty decent we have a proper drum set you can you know then we can map out all of this sounds in over here great next what we're going to do is we're going to start creating hit boxes now hit boxes in games are basically invisible spaces that are used to detect something when something gets hit now when we're using these kind of hitboxes it allows you to create a sound in the game so what we're going to do uh we're going to create a sprite with the paint tool and we're going to start creating these hit boxes by creating an oval i'm just going to change this color to black okay and i want to move this hit box as close and make it as distinct to the drum parts as possible so for example if i have this tom over here nice so this looks pretty decent and good enough for it to be the hitbox of this part next you want to do this for all of the parts um the remaining parts of the drum but before that what we can also do to make it an easier process is we can add sounds in it and we can just duplicate the parts and adjust it according to the part so let's say for example for over here i'm going to delete this pop sound and i'm going to look for the percussion sounds now since we're working with a tom over here let's say oh i want to get this sound over here and we can just make it a little bit softer sounds a little bit like a tom next what we can do is we can right click over here and duplicate this now you can just readjust the position of it according to where you want the hitbox to be again i'm gonna just resize it a little bit just because it looks a little bit different and now since this is a different hitbox i'm going to make this sound a little bit different as well i'm going to name this tom 2 and maybe make this a little bit more soft lower okay so now this sounds a little bit deeper as well so we have two sounds one and this one is a little bit higher now i'm going to continue with duplicating for the rest of the parts as well so just duplicate and then go back to costumes and i'm going to move this down here now you want to adjust it according to the part size so just keep on doing that until you have the right size adjustments it can be a little bit tricky for some some parts but you want to make it as accurate as possible doesn't have to be super accurate but as long as you can create like a hitbox that the player can touch all right i think i'm happy with this one um and then i'm just going to change the sound over here let's say i'm going to add a snary sound over there go back to my percussion let's look for snares snare drum and i'm just gonna add that that's gonna be the sound for this one and i'm just gonna continue onwards by duplicating and moving it to the next place so our kick drum over here needs to be adjusted as well again take your time with this it can be a time consuming process but it is um pretty simple to do once you get the hold of it right so now i'm going to put the sound of the kick over here kick drum all right okay that's good back to duplicating this okay um and then this one would also be let's just call let's just have this a snare drum sound okay now we only have the hats remaining so let's just finish up with those as well all right let me just find the sound for it okay let's have this symbol crash over here and then let me just duplicate this it's a little bit different sound so that looks different i'm just going to adjust this one again just a little bit okay now finally we just have the head just duplicate that last one and just make this sound different as well yeah make it like a symbol another crash okay so now that we have all of our hitboxes done we will now move on to the coding of this now the coding process of this will be we will code in one hitbox and then the same code will be duplicated in all of the hit boxes so it should be pretty simple let's first start with one of the hit boxes let's say i'm starting with this sprite one over here i'm going to start with a when flag clicked now first of all we want it to be going in the front of the layer so you will get to get a go to front layer and we want it to show now there's another thing that we want it's to be happening is we don't want the hitboxes to be seen while we're playing the game so we're going to be using an effect called the ghosting effect set ghost effect and we're going to set it to a hundred percent what this will do is basically it will make it transparent so that when we're actually running the project the hitboxes are not seen then what we want to do is basically get a forever loop since we want this to be running forever throughout the game we will put it in and we need to check whether if the mouse is touching the hitbox or not and the way that we do that is we get a if condition so we're going to get a if blank then there's a couple of blocks that we also need is a blank and blank which is checking two conditions together so we're to go in our operator get our blank and blank and we want to check our mouse down and touching mouse pointer so these are the three blocks that we need to actually test if we are actually hitting that hitbox so after assembling these um blocked together we want to put them inside the forever loop so let's start with putting this inside the if condition and we're checking that if the mouse is down and if it's touching the mouse pointer the hitbox then we want something to happen so before we want it to play any sound we want it to wait so we're gonna get a weight from the control section first right here and we're gonna get a not blank and put it over here the reason we're doing is we're just gonna check if it's not actually a mouse but that's it's not down so that it's gonna then play the sound after the mouse is not down so we're gonna go get that mouse down again and then finally play that sound that we have assigned for this hitbox so we go to sound and start sound tom drum so let's try for specifically this if this works and it does so that's great so now all we have to do is pretty simple we're just going to copy and paste it into all of these hit boxes so i'm just command c and command v or control c or control v and copying and pasting all this code into the rest of the hitboxes now you want to make sure that when you're duplicating or pasting them into all these hitboxes you change the sound according to what did you have assigned for that particular hitbox so i had tom two over here for this one we had a snare drum this one had a kick that was also a snare we had symbol crash and another symbol crash and a symbol so now let's take a look at the final project you can see you have all the hitboxes working and always go back and turn this down according to how you want it to be that's good so now you can play around with different sounds it just doesn't have to be like a drum kit you can use your own custom sound as well and play around with it as much as you want well so that's our finished project you can also use different images it doesn't have to be this image um you can use a bongo you can use a keyboard using these hit boxes you can create a lot of different kind of you know projects now you can create like a keyboard and have different keys of those hitboxes playing different instrument sounds as well so the ideas you can come up with are limitless using these hit boxes so that's all for today hope you liked the video don't forget to subscribe and like our videos also check out these
