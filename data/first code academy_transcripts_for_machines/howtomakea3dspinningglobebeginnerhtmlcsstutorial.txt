hello everybody welcome back to our channel here we share beginnerfriendly coding tutorials on scratch roblox minecraft web programming and many more today we're going to create a web programming project called rotating earth globe so in this project we will use html to design the structure of the website and css to color design shape and do the animations for this website so let's get started so in this project i'll be using codepen to make this project so in a new kind of codepen i'm gonna go to the html section and start writing our html code so let's first declare our html tag so we write html in here we want to define our body of the html so let's open up the body tag first we want to add a header so do that let's add an h1 tag which stands for the header 1 tag in here we can write rotating globe and now we want to close our header 1 tag so it will display rotating globe underneath the headers we want to add a div and we also want to give the div and id of earth and we can have nothing in the div so we can just leave it empty like so close up the div and now let's close out body so we close up body and then finally close the html tag and this will conclude the html portion of this project so now let's move on to our css so in the css part what we're trying to do is to change the css of our div called earth and have it have a picture of the globe and have an animation that rotates the globe so here let's change the css of this div so we can refer to this div by calling the id and here we named it earth so we're going to put hash hash birth in here and here let's change the position to relative so let's set the position the relative this would be relevance for our page and let's set the height and width of our div to 300 pixels so let's change the height assign it to 300 pixels and the width which will also set 300 pixels now let's add some margins so here i'm going to write margin and the first value i'm going to put is 0.05 em and then the second value i'm gonna write auto so the first value will apply to the top and the right margin of the page and the second value will be applied to the left and bottom margin of the page so here we have 0.05 em margin for top and right and an auto margin for left and bottom now let's add our background pictures so let's go to background here i'm gonna write hashtag 888 followed by a url inside of this bracket um i want to put the url of the pictures i'm going to be using so you can go to google and find the image address and paste it into here and as you can see we have found the picture and inserted it into our website now we can have two more parameters for sure zero zero and lastly we're going to write repeat so the statement for background should look something like this hashtag 888 followed by url and link to their picture zero zero and repeat the picture right now is a square however so let's try to make this into a circle um and lastly let's define the animations so here we can either do animation from javascript or animation from css in today's project we'll be using animation of css so here let's type in animation and here we'll write in the animation name here we write rotate and then followed by 4 seconds or 4s and then we write linear and then followed by infinite so this command animation it takes in four inputs so the first input is the name of the animation we haven't yet defined what rotate is but this will be the animation that we'll define later that tells the css what the actual animation is um four seconds the durations which takes four seconds to do the whole and rotate animation is linear so that the animation does not speed up in any way and is linear in speed and it's infinite is the loop so it will loop forever next let's use transition to make our animation smoother typing transition and inside transition let's write transform 200 milliseconds and linear again and here we should define what transform is so we're going to write transform dash style and decide we're going to be using first serve 3d dash 3d like so and we're going to also add a box shadow around our square so um here we're going to write box shadow here we're going to have an inset so it's inside we have a 200 pixel uh 20 pixels so insets 20 pixels followed by zero pixels followed by 80 pixels followed by six pixels and then give it a color of black so rgb of zero zero and zero and so so what we have here for the box shadow is that we have gave it the inside of zero followed by an offset of x offset of y the blur radius and the spread radius and then followed by the color so we have just um set all of them up in here and lastly we want to change the color of the background for this diff and let's change the color and just give it a hash zero zero zero now that we've finished the css for our div let's define the animation so as you can see here in the animation we have named our animation to be rotate and to deploy our own animation in css we use the keyword keyframes or at keyframes like this and now we can declare our animation which we have said to be rotate so in keyframes it takes in a couple of um animation so it takes in the beginning stage so the start here we can simply uh denote that at zero percent stands for zero percent of the animation so now before the animation is started this is um what is happening here we're going to change the background dash position to be zero and zero and next we're gonna write a hundred percent this is when the animation is fully completed what we would like to see and here we will like a background with position at 6 30 pixels and zero pictures like this and as you can already see and our template our earth is spinning and basically what this keyframe rotate does is that at zero percent we have our position at one place and then every four seconds it will go for a full rotation like this and um we have also told the animation to go at constant speed and basically forever so this is what we're seeing here and before we get carried away let's keep continue our css and do the h1 tag so to change header tag let's write h1 in here we will change to position to relative and we'll give this the height of 100 pixels and a width of 300 pixels let's change the margin all around to auto let's make the top and the left padding and margin to be zero so here right top to be zero and let's left to also be zero and we want this text to be centralized so let's write text align to be centered and we add an animation for this where it changes color so here we can do animation color for one second and we'll have it go for infinite and again um we have defined the animation to use the animation called color which we have not yet told css what it is so here like we did with rotate we have to create a new keyframe so under here let's go and do add keyframes and the name we need the animation to be colored so here before the animation start at zero percent uh we will set the color of our text to red we can change um our color then to be green and then we can set our color to be corn flower blue and lastly we can sell our color to gray and at a hundred percent we'll add continually add color so here we add color pink and each color is separated by a semicolon and um here after this we have color red color purple and lastly we have color orange so doing this now you can as you can see um everything is changing color and um it's actually changing quite fast too so um maybe if you guessed want we can add a better delay um but as you can see it doesn't really matter it will just keep flipping through colors and you can kind of um decide which color you want so if i want color green i can just go here and move to clear green like so one more thing would do is we want to style earth and the globe depending on if he has been selected or not so we should define earth style before it's been selected and after he has been selected so let's do that before first here i'm alright earth and then before this will indicate that this is before he has been selected here i'll change the position to absolute then i will have the top have zero padding and margin so i'll put in zero and the same for the left so i'll put in zero for left so we have no padding or margin on the left and then i will change to width to 100 and change the height to 100 now i'm gonna add content and inside content i'll leave it blank um so i'll just have an empty string like this for opacity let's change this to 0.2 so it will be slightly less oblique and it'll be harder to see and let's do 40 a border radius of 50 and lastly let's do background and add a radian uh gradient and circle at 100 pixels so here radio radians inside here we want to write circles at 100 pixel by 100 pixel so that is the height and width and the color will have hashtag ff and yeah this would be our css for before and now let's take a look at after so let's do earth after basically we have the exact same code so in fact from position to border radius it will be the same exact code so i'm going to copy and paste and it is at the background which it differs so in the background we'll actually start typing in our own values and sets so here we're typing negative 80 pixels followed by 15 pixels followed by 80 pixels followed by 10 pixels and then we write rgba and rgba takes in four numbers inside the first number is zero second number is zero the third number is zero and the fourth number is point nine and the last parameter we will write inset and yep and this would be our earth after it's been selected and yeah this is the whole css of this project including this html this is the whole part of the website so that is all for today in today's project we made a website similar to the rotating earth globe which uses css and html we used css animation background and position to make the globe rotate infinitely make sure to subscribe to our channel and like our videos also don't
