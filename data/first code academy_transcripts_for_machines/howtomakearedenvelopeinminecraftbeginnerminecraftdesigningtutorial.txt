everyone so today we're going to be making a red envelope in minecraft using learn to mod and we're going to be first making a texture pack and then we'll be making a mod which will be blocks of code which will be added into minecraft and then run to give us our red envelope so let's begin so once we had to learn to mod i'd like you to click on the green button here after you log in this will take you to your server once you land at this my server page make sure that you are the admin of your server over here and here you have the start server button so you can click on this and give it a few seconds and it starts loading your server and the reason we're doing this first is because this takes a few minutes after this is done we will then move on to designing our texture pack and creating our mod so while this loads what you can do you can open a new tab and head to learn to mod and then go here then you can click on the login option over here and then you can click at this play and then you can click on the texture packs so what i'm going to type in here is red underscore nv low and then underscore two once that's done you'll see that it's added over here in texture pack and you can click on see inside so once you're here you're created with this page and this block shows you what is needed when you want to call in your design so this we need to keep it handy for now and we're going to click on change here so when you click on change you're going to start adding your design here we have search so we would like to first find a diamond or click on this so what we'd like to do first is we'll click on this red color here click on that and then what you can do is just zoom in like this with your mouse and just color it inside here and then after you're done what you can do next is click on this commit change so it saves your mod so once your mod is saved what you can do next is you can close this here the next thing we'd like to do is we'd like to find paper so we search for paper and then we click on this so once you have this you can design this and i'm just going to color it red so once again i can zoom in here with my mouse like this just color it everywhere all right so once you're done coloring that you can add in more color so i'm just gonna click on this golden color and make a design here like this once that's done you can click on commit change once again and then it's saved so now that we have these two things over here what we'd like to do is we have to make sure we deploy our design so we click on deploy and we wait for it to be deployed so we give it a bit of time and then it will say deploying wait a moment please refresh the page so what you can do next is you can just refresh the page here reload then it says deployed so you can head back to play and then go back to our texture pack so we can look back inside here click on view as remember this part is important this is needed so our server is already running the next part we want to add is our mod so click on play and then click on mod so here what we're going to type in this is red underscore envelope underscore so we're going to click here on blockly multiplayer then once you click on that it will create this mod over here so let's keep this page for now i would like to open another tab and paste this address back as i'd like to check out my texture pack as this is something we'll be needing so that texture back is over here and as i mentioned earlier we'll need this as this will help us refer to our texture pack over here so once we go inside our mod we are created with this and then we can click on code so once we're landed on the red envelope page we're created with this yeah so what we're going to do first is we're going to click on functions and take out function do something i'm going to change this to me and the next thing inside is we're going to click on the layer block and here it says change texture pack for player now that player is us so how do we do that we click on player take out me now it asks us pac right the url so this url is placed here so we'll copy and then paste it in here next thing we'd like to do is we'd like to create a variable so a variable is a data type which stores an information and you can name it to anything you like so click on variables take out set item put that here click on item we rename this we're going to call this n v loop so envelope so we call this envelope next we want to add in a new item we want to add in the material that we have which is paper and to do that we click on the item block so over here you'll see new item material and then here and then there's a amount so what we're going to do first is click on the math block here and then drag this out put this over here and put in the number one and then for materials we will scroll down to p for paper and then the next thing we'd like to do is we now want to change the item and to do that we're again going to go back to the item block and then here we're going to take out change item here so in here we have this variable of envelope so we're going to click on variable take that out and put that here and we're going to change its name of this paper so here if you want to change the name we can click on text and then take this out drag this inside here and change this to nv loop next we want it to give us this item so we click on item and we take out give item to so the player it's going to give to is us so we're going to click on the player over here and take out me and we can just duplicate this and paste this here i'm going to give in the so the next thing we need to add is we want to also add in our diamond ore as when we break that block it will give us the envelope so you click on this copy paste and then you can bring this down here but we're gonna add in a new variable so we click on this and we click on new variable and type in block we can remove this paper as we won't be using it and then we can click on material d and as you scroll down you will see a diamond hole you can drag that and put that in here next once again we want to change the name so we're going to take this out and we're going to change this from the block and we want to give this a name here we're going to call this envelope and then the next thing we want to do we want to give this item to us so we won't be giving envelope and be giving the so what we've done here we've created a function and in this function we are changing the texture pack first by getting what we've made then we've created a variable called envelope and it's taking the item of paper and it's given us one and we've changed that from the paper to envelope as in the name and we want it to be given to us next we've created a variable called block and it's given us one diamond ore but through the texture pack let's change this to the diamond ore that we created with red color and then it has changed that name to envelope block and that also has been given to us so once we click mod what this does is it sends this to minecraft so it says here that it's going to be in our mod and here is our ip address so for this we need to actually use minecraft 1.9 we won't be using the latest version so we can go ahead by copying and pasting this and then you can launch your minecraft over here so you can click on play click this make sure it's 1.9 and then here you can click on multiplayer because we can click add server and then click here add in the ip address we have then double click this and then we'll join our server so once we're in our world we can click on number nine you can place this mod block here and then you'll see this mr sids red envelope too so that's the mod that we just made which has been pushed into minecraft put that here and then once we're done with this we can deploy it by pressing one then it will say it wants to connect to a custom resource pack would you like to download and install it you click yes so what it's doing it's downloading and installing our texture pack and then after that's done you'll notice that we got our red envelope and we got this envelope blocked so congrats you've made your mod you have a red envelope and you got your envelope so this is the end of the tutorial thank you very much for watching this tutorial i hope you had fun watching this and making this red
