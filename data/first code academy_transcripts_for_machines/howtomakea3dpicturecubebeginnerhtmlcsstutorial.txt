hello everybody welcome back to our channel here we share beginner friendly coding tutorials on scratch roblox minecraft web programming and many more today we're going to create a web programming project called 3d picture cube so we all know mother's day usually come on the second sunday in may so in this project i'll teach you how to use html and css to create this 3d picture rotating tube for this special occasion in this project i'll teach you how to use uh keyframes and transform properties to make the pictures rotate and end mate like this so uh yeah let's get started so i have gone ahead in codespan.io and created a new pen so here let's get started with our html so for our html we want to have a big div and this div is going to have a class called wrapper so classical wrapper and let's close out the div for wrapper over here so now we have a div class called wrapper um we want to create another div class in here so we'll create another div class whoops creates another div and this class will be called box dash area like so and again let's close up this div for box slash area and within box dash area we want to have five more divs and each diff is going to have one side of the cube and the reason why we only need five instead of six is because the fifth side of the cube actually overlaps with the six when we're doing the uh animation so um the six side never got shown so that we only need five sides of the tube so here i'm gonna make the first cube um class name of box one and now close the div next i'll make uh four more divs like this so div class of equals box two now close to this and i'm gonna make a bit of class equals box three and then close the div and i'm gonna make two more so here div class will be equals to box four and i'll close the div and then lastly i will have my box five just like so and so in our html we have a main diff uh called wrapper inside the wrapper we have a bigger second bigger div called box arena or box area and inside the box area we have the five sides of our cube that we're gonna be rotating from showing pictures so um yep that is the html setup for this project so going to the css let's begin by constructing the design for the overall website so let's go ahead to css and edit the body here we want to apply a margin and padding serum so we want to go margin enter 0 and padding i have 0 as our input so now our margin and padding on all four sides will be 0. next we want to be changing and aligning the div in the center so here we will have justified content to center this way our main axis of the website will be centralized and now let's do align items and also to center so now the diff of body will be centralized as well now let's make the background color to be pink to follow the spirits of mother's day and lastly we want to change the display type to flex having a display types of flex allows the divs inside to change size correspond to the parents so here um we'll have the div to be the same size as this parent's container so that flips flex really just allows overall adaptability for the website so it will change size depending on your screen size which is very helpful now let's take a look at wrapper here we just want to set the size for the wrapper and set the margin to the around so that nothing will be uh distracting us so here let's go ahead and change the wrapper and here um inside the wrapper let's change the height and width to be 300 pixels so here i will write width to be 300 pixels and set heights also to 300 pixels and again we're gonna set a margin around uh the whole side so we're gonna set 15 percent to the right and top side and auto on the left and the bottom side so we'll type margin 15 space auto just like this next let's go ahead and do our css for the box area so let's go down and type box area in box area we want to actually define the animations and here we actually be using webkit animation this is to make sure that this animation will be accessible from any browser we use um so if you just use animation sometimes some browser does not support um just plain animation so if we add in webkit and make sure that um our browser will support the animation so here we write down the name of the animation we're gonna name it animate and the whole animation is gonna have 10 seconds of animation so we want each uh kind of la uh the loop of animate to be 10 seconds and we're gonna write ease in and out like this and this will slow down the beginning and the end of the animation providing a smoother transition and we also want this to loop forever so at the fourth parameters let's type in infinite like that so we have webkit animation the name is animate it goes on for 10 seconds the whole animation ease in and out provides uh instructions to the start of the animation and end of the animation and infinite tells that we should loot this forever so we'll keep doing this animation as long as this website is getting loaded next let's set um just a normal animation now and here um we will have the same parameters and the point is that if the computer does not support uh animation it will use webkits but if it does support the normal animation we'll just use that instead so here that's why we have two declarations of animation one being webkit and one being just plain animation now we want to do um some kind of transform property to smooth out the animation and make it more um smooth so here let's add in a webkit uh transform style and now we can set the transform style to preserve 3d preserve 3d like that and again we're gonna do one without the webkit so we're gonna write transform style preserve 3d just like that so this preserved 3d um is a very important css option that allows us to blend in other elements into our main parents object so here um again continuing off with our webkit and just normal style we're gonna apply a webkit of um transform origin like so and here we're gonna put in 100 pixels space 100 pixels space 0 and again we're going to do one without the webkit so here we can write transform origin and again it will take in the same inputs 100 pixels 100 pixels and zero and lastly um this is the case for internet explorer we can apply ms transform origin and this will make sure it'll work um in internet explorer so here again we're gonna use a 100 pixels by 100 pixels and zero so this would be the css for a box area so now let's set up our keyframes animations so right now our keyframes has been a lot assigned the name of animate so in this animate animation we have um all five sides to show in 10 seconds over here uh the full duration of the animation and the way we're going to show the pictures uh pretty much one by one is by rotating our cube um and setting up our pictures um with an ankle so that whenever we rotate it will show one of the sides but not all five sides so here let's define our keyframes so here we can do add keyframes and we can write enemy this is the same name as we have over here now we're defining this anime um animation and here we want to write from and two and in here um the from is going to be the beginning of the animation while 2 is going to be the end so here we can write webkits transform and we're going to rotate the xaxis to 0 degrees rotate the yaxis to 0 degrees and rotate the zaxis to zero degrees and this would be the first line and this would be the from so in the beginning we want to have no rotations with our um with our box area and at the end we also want it to go back to the uh first uh side of the cube so it will be the exact same line so here we can just kind of retype what we have here so webkit transform rotates x to be zero degrees of rotates y also to be zero degrees and again rotate z will be zero degrees as well and now after we have this from into um we can actually details the very percentage of the animation so we can say at 16 or 35 of the animation completion we want to reach the state so using percentage we can actually layer the whole animation um pretty much from zero to 100 so here we're going to have 16 this is 16 of the way to the whole animation um here we want to apply a webkit um transform and here we want to rotate our y axis so here we'll rotate our y to negative 90 degrees and this will change it will rotate our box area by 90 degrees to the y axis and again to make sure that this webkit um is used on all browsers we can just simply type in one without the webkits here we can say webkit y rotate y negative 90 degrees and this will run on browser that supports it and those that does not support the normal css animation will be able to run the webcase all right so now we have the 16 um this is showing from the first side of the cube to the second by just simply rotating on our y axis and you can imagine we have two more sides in the y axis that we can show so we can keep rotating the y but um for a cube you can kind of just mess around the degrees and then between how you layer up each percentage you can see how the cube rotate as an animation so here i'm going to add 33 this is the second part of the animation so here we want to apply a webkit um transform again and now this time we want to rotate the y axis by again negative 90 degrees so we're actually not changing it and now we're going to rotate the zaxis to 90 degrees and again we're going to do a version without the webkit so again i can just copy and paste this like that and you can copy and paste the same code without the webkit part so now that we've done 33 and 16 let's keep going the next step is going to be at 50 of the animation here we again want to apply the webcam uh transform uh property here we want to transform it from transforming the rotate y value to negative 180 uh degrees or negative 180 degrees and our rotate z will still remain at 90 degrees and again we can just copy and paste this transform as it will be the same awesome after 50 let's go to 66 here again we'll be applying the webkit transform so webkit transform and now we'll be rotating the y value once again so rotate y and here we'll put in negative 270 degrees and for the rotate z will remain it at 90 degrees and again you can copy the part without the webkit and paste it right underneath it this so that for each step of the animation there are two things we can do um if one of them doesn't work and here actually um this from and two um i actually made a mistake there's no web kit on the second line because that is the pattern we've been going for for every separate animation so remove this dash webkit dash on the second line from from into now the last step of our animation is going to be at 50 uh it's going to be at 83 of the animation and this is um as you can imagine for from here we can show the first picture second picture third picture fourth picture fifth picture now we're gonna have to rotate back so here we're gonna have have webkit transform and we're going to have rotate x by negative 270 degrees and that will be our only transform so here we can again rotate x by negative 270 degrees just like so and this would be the whole animation for our animate just like so and something we should do uh to prepare ourselves in case we do have the use of webkit animation is that we should create the webkit keyframes and um all of the code will actually be exactly the same since in here we have considered both cases so here let's just copy and paste from keyframes animate to the end of the decorations copy you can either ctrl c or you can right click and say copy and then go down um tap down a couple of lines and simply paste it so now we have two of these animations and change your second one where you type to be at webkit like that so we'll just add in this dash webkit dash in front of our keyframes and now we have defined this webcam animation as well awesome so now um the final thing is we have to do is define the css for these boxes so here we can actually define all of them at once and just classify them in general and give them a size to do that so we can do box area and we can select all the diff inside the box area so here all of these dips will be affected since it is inside of this diff called box area here we just want to give it a position of absolute uh we want to change the width to be 300 pixels and the heights could also be 300 pixels because as you might remember in the very beginning we have turned the wrapper to this size and the final thing we'll do is change the line height to be 300 pixels as well so next um we should finish this project by setting up our div the five side of the box so here let's do the first box so we can do this by box area and selecting dot box one here i will first add a background image so i'll write background image and i'm gonna give it an url source and um the link is gonna be in here so i have picked up um a picture myself uh you guys could pick out any pictures you want as long as you guys have a link to the picture or way for your computer to load the picture you can load it in here and after that let's change some of the properties let's make sure that this picture will be centralized and fill up the whole box to do this let's change the background size to cover and let's change the background position to center and center and this three lines um apart from the url of course will be the would be the three common factors between the five different boxes um and the things that they differ is going to be the transform um underneath here so here let's first define the transform for box one uh again we're gonna have to be sure to include the webkit transform as one of them to support all types of operating systems and browsers so here our web uh kit transform would have a translate of z and then we say 100 pixels this translate z means that we can move on the z axis 100 pixels both ways and this is the maximum animation we can do and again we're going to set up a transform without the webkit here we're going to say again translate z to be 100 pixels so what i've quickly done here is after our box ones which we did together i've inserted four more boxes so box two box three box four and box five and as you can see the background size and position are the same for all four of them which is the same as our box one with cover and center center and the background image just have a different url for different pictures but as you can see the three lines of code are pretty much identical so now let's go over each box and let's change the webkit um transform and the normal transform value for each one of them so for box two we again are going to apply a webkit uh transform for box two we're gonna change to rotate y here we want to put in a value of 90 degrees and the second thing we want to change is again the z so let's write translate z and put in 100 pixels and again we can do the same trick without the webkit and just from transform highlight it all the way to the end of this ctrl c go down ctrl v and we'll paste the second line and um yeah so let's do the same thing for box three so for box three if you want to apply a webkit transform um the first thing i'm going to do is rotate y we want to change this to 90 degrees we want rotate x to be also 90 degrees and again we want to have the translate z to be at 100 pixels okay and again we're gonna have to write a transform without the webkit but with the same parameters so we can easily just do this by copying pasting this the second part of this one without the webcam so this is our box three so now now let's take a look at box four again we're gonna apply a webkit transform and here we're gonna have rotate y be a 180 degrees now i'm going to have rotate z to be uh 90 degrees and again translate z to be a hundred pixels and again we can just drag in from starting from transform to the end of the semicolon and just copy and paste this part and still be the same as this webkit without simply without the webkit uh keyword and for our fifth box um let's again add in a webkit transform and here we want to say rotate x to be negative 90 degrees and translate z to be a hundred pixels and again we want the part without the webkit transform so we just select transform to the semicolon go down and copy and paste it awesome and as you can see now our pictures for this 3d picture cube is completed so that is all for today in today's tutorial we learned how to make a 3d picture cube using html and css for mother's day don't forget that you can change the picture to whatever you like and also the background color of the project don't forget to subscribe to our channel and like our videos also check out our other two
