all right so you guys should be able to see my screen now and so this project I'm gonna press the green flag and so this project is about this monkey that is basically dodging away from this virus and eating more orange juice as the vitamin C so every time that we are eating the we eat the orange our score goes up and then every time the virus hits us the score goes down so we are going to create this project together and so go ahead and log into your scratch.mit.edu and we can get started cool so without further ado let's get it started I want to name this game first so maybe eat the vitamin huh so I'm gonna call this project eat the vitamin and what I'm gonna do first and foremost is as you remember we have a backdrop of a colorful image so let me just click on here this is the backdrop area and I'm gonna press this button which will directly point me to choose the backdrop I'm gonna choose the blue sky just because you know just makes everything brighter and because we are not using the scratch cat right now for this tutorial I'm going to remove it and press the sprite here and as you recall the game is about this monkey that is dodging the virus and eating more vitamins which is an orange so I am going to look for it can really be anything but I'm going to use the the monkey right now here and probably need to make it a little bit smaller so I'll change it to 660 is pretty good and what else do I need so I actually downloaded two files one is the Ebola virus and one is the orange that I want the monkey to eat so both are incredibly big right now so we don't need such a big brothers on the screen and we're going to make it smaller and also drag the virus to the side of the screen so it starts moving from there and then also change the orange to maybe 30 so also start from here awesome okay so now we have our high P thanks for joining hi picky thanks for joining so any questions so far are you guys following through the video cool cool all right so I am going to move on and start coding all these movements so one of the things that you might remember is that the game actually has a score so whenever we start the game we want to start the score all right so I am gonna start with actually I'm gonna delete this first all right I'm gonna start with the monkey so I want to start the game with basically just a score of zero so what I need to do is to go inside the variable and set the variable calling it score you can start the score in any number as well like some people might want to start with a hundred or you know easier we can start with zero and so we want to put the score somewhere so we're going to put a motion there so we will ask every time we click the start of green flag we will be asking scratch to place the score onto the topleft corner so the next thing that we're gonna so pay attention here that I am choosing the monkey so because we are essentially coding up the motions for the monkey what we're gonna do is to is to program the monkey such that when we press the up arrow we will have the monkey go up which means we're changing the ycoordinates of the monkey by a certain amount so scratch has already set us up for a default number so we can just keep it like that and let's check it out whether it works so I'm pressing the up caret up arrow key and you can see okay I'm keep moving but the monkey is moving out so it works what I'm gonna do next is to simply right click and duplicate my monkey such that sorry duplicate the code not duplicating the monkey so duplicating these two code such that I am going to just change the up arrow to this dropdown menu and choose down arrow and what I'm gonna do is to instead of adding my yaxis I'm going to reduce my yaxis so basically I am making it a negative and I'm gonna quickly test it out my down arrow great so now we're going we're able to move up and down the monkey which is really what we need in terms of the monkeys movements and one of the things that I one other thing I want to share with you all when coding up these projects is also to test out your code often what I mean here is that we always want to make sure that our code is working so what I did just now was whenever I finished one section of a code I would just press test out my code by pressing the up arrow in this case or the down arrow in this case such that is to confirm to ourselves that our code is working the way we want okay so next as you remember so this code this project basically involves two sprites moving to us the monkey and the monkey needs to dodge the virus and eat the orange how it works here is let's program the virus first all right so when we program the virus what it means is that we need to make the virus keep moving from the left side of the screen to the right side of the screen and after they hit the right side of the border it will go back to the left side and move down or up the screen and do it all over again so it sounds really complicated but trust me we can pretty much handle it very well and pretty much handle it just in a few pieces of code that's the power of scratch so what we can do is to first drag out the offense block and when green flag clicked block so this is an offense block that we use and the next thing that we will use is a forever book so forever block is this crack representation of a while loop if you guys are familiar with computer science but it's not it just means that it will repeat an action forever so it's very intuitive that way and what we will do next is to get the get get the blog for go to so this is asking the virus to start off at a set place so right now scratch already gave us this number so I think we can just keep it that way where we want the virus to start off on the left hand side of the screen so the yaxis is a little bit tricky so the yaxis we want to change it to a random number what it means here is that we every time the virus come back we want the we want the virus to go to a different ycoordinate so we would want to change it to minus 120 to positive 120 so the middle part of the screen is zero and zero coordinates and what it means is that we want our Y coordinates to be either to the top of the screen or the bottom of the screen like anywhere in between next we are going to program the repeat block the repeat until block here essentially means that we want this action to repeat until a certain event happens so what we will do is to have a an operator so we essentially want the virus to keep moving until it either hits an edge which is in this case the right hand side of the border or the monkey right what we will want to do is now go into the sensing first part is when it touched the edge the other sensing off that we need to use is when it touched a monkey cool all right so the next part that we're going to do is that when this happened what do we want scratch to do we actually want we want to keep changing the xaxis until the virus hit the edge of the screen or hit the monkey so what do we want the virus to do we want it to do we want it to keep moving so we probably don't want it to move too fast it's not the game will be really difficult so we can actually change it to move maybe like just three every time all right so they were pretty happy with this code right now and I'm gonna change this and the last bit is that when we hit the monkey we want the score to changed right so okay so what we want to do is to actually make it another if statement so we want an if statement here what do we want to do when the when the virus hits a monkey we want to change to score by minus 1 right okay cool all right so now this is almost halfway there like our our game is already functioning halfway and what we need to do next is to also program the orange to move such that we can reward the monkey whenever we hit the whenever he hit the orange there is actually a very fast way to program this part which is to click right click duplicates and what you can see is that okay now we are duplicated and I'm just going to drag this and drag this block of code onto the orange okay I'm gonna do that again okay all right I am successfully did that but it didn't actually do the whole thing but that is okay because I can just use this it's just missing a few pieces so it's missing the forever block and click flag click green flag block and what I'm gonna do is that well at this time we are moving so okay okay okay all right so it's just not registering for the for a moment and now it's moving and you can see that our score it is declining and the reason is that even if we are eating the orange is still deducting hours for which is not what we want so maybe we can make this game more friendly such that it will increase our score by 5 and every time we eat the orange okay so we're able to regain our health pretty quickly all right so I think this game is actually working pretty well now so what I will do is to further actually slow down my the virus and I'll click here and changing this number 3 to 2 and basically you can see that now the monkey is able to catch the catch the orange pretty effectively and dodge away from the virus and I'm gonna show this in full screen I'll actually refresh the game let's see if our game actually works so our game have to score starting from zero and okay seems like our monkey the orange coat is not updated so I am going to go inside and change this and also change back my virus to two so so that oh okay that's why because if there is actually two code here all right so I am going to change just click into both blocks of code to make sure it's working the way I want to and yes so I am able to see my score go up here by five each time I eat the orange and also see my score go down each time I got hit by the virus by one and I'm gonna stop the game here and one thing that I want to mention just now that I forgot to do that's why the score is not showing up is because I need to always check this box here where whenever I define a variable scratch actually give us the option whether to show it on the screen which in this case we do want to and that's why when I was coding up the game and pressing the green flag it was not showing up in the beginning because I didn't like this score checkbox and so if every time you want the score to show up on the box you always want to you always want to click this box and it will show up on the screen so yeah there we go we have successfully created this game that is a remix eat the banana it is the story of this monkey eating up more vitamins and dodging up the virus and so yeah feel free to follow along this tutorial when you have time and leave a comment down below let me know how it goes for you or any sort of adjustments that you have created with this game and I can't wait to see your products see you next time
