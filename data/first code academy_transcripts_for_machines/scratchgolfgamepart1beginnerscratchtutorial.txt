hello everyone welcome back to our channel here we share beginner friendly coding tutorials on scratch minecraft roblox web programming and many more and today what we're going to do is design a mini golf game using scratch in this part one of the project we will focus on the basic controls of the game and the ball movement and in the second part we'll continue with the development of the game in the other parts so let's get started so before we um start i would also want to show you a little bit of a demo of how the game will work so as you can see here we have sort of a mini golf course and what i'm going to do is i'm going to aim for the ball to go inside the hole right here so what i'd have to do is i had to click on this red dot and then click on my spacebar to make the ball move there so here you go and now i am in level two we'll start by creating a new empty project on scratch and the very first step will be to create an empty field and what we want to do is draw a green square in the background and add a rectangle of a different shade of green and make sure it has a black border all right so here i'm going to make the background okay which is the darker green color i'll do something like that okay and then in the middle i'll have another one so i'll do it i'll do it a different shade of green okay and then my outline i want black so that's good okay then i will make it look something like this now we'll add two sprites one for the ball and one for the whole so for the ball sprite you can just make a white circle and resize it so it's not too big so let's do the ball first okay so first of all i need to delete the scratch cat then i'm gonna go ahead and draw a ball and choose a white color something like that now i'm gonna need to resize it okay so that's the ball right there let me also rename this right to ball then i'll duplicate it right here and then make the other one the whole right now let me fill it with a different color of course i will do a gray color like so and i'm going to put it right opposite the ball i think i'm going to make it a little bigger let's say 80 or a little smaller 70 like so place it right here now we can define the controls of the game so we'll use the distance to the mouse to determine the power of the shot and then the position to determine the angle of the shot so to do that we need to add some blocks into the golf ball okay so now that i'm in the golf ball um sprite i'm going to go ahead and add in the when green flag clicks and what i want to do is i want to make sure that the ball sprite the position is reset in the beginning so i'm going to go to motion choose this block go to x y i'm going to choose to do minus 175 for x and 0 for y okay so it's gonna look pretty much the same thing right here and then what i want to do is i want to go ahead and also set the direction so i'm going to stay point in direction 90 all right and then i'm going to set the speed of it so i'm going to go to control i'm sorry variables and then make a variable called speed and then i'm going to say set speed to zero and another variable is moving so moving okay and then i'm going to also set moving to zero now another thing i want to do is that i want to set up a conditional and this if this conditional is that i want to only point to the mouse pointer if the ball is not moving so here i'm going to set the condition to equal to zero the moving on variable i'm going to set it to equal to zero and we can use moving equals to one whenever we want to stop some actions if the ball is moving such as this point towards the block so i'm going to go ahead and control and get the forever loop and what i'm going to do is set up my condition like i was saying so get the if and here i'm i'm going to say if the moving variable is equal to 0 then that is when i make the ball move towards wherever i click just now so i will go to motion and do a point towards mouse pointer now we can start coding the ball movement so when we press the space bar the ball will start to move to the direction um we're facing so i will start by changing the value of moving to one so that the direction that the ball is facing doesn't change anymore so we said before that we wanted to control the speed of the ball so what i'll do right now is i'll set it up so that the max speed of the ball is 20. all right so here what i'm going to do is i'm going to go to control i'll start event and i'm going to say when space key pressed so that's when you press on your spacebar i will set my variable moving to one so set moving to one and then i'm going to get a condition so in control i'll say if all right if the distance is bigger than 200 because i want to make it so that the farther away the mouse pointer is from the ball the faster the ball will travel so there's actually a block in fencing that does just that so um just now i mentioned 200 right so what i want to do is i want to make the number smaller so that the ball doesn't travel way too fast so since i said the max speed is going to be 20 i can divide the maximum number of pixels away from another number so that i get 20. so in my case just now i pick 200 as the max distance so i have to divide it by 10 to get 20. so i will add that in a block so that the variable speed gets that value now if the value is above 200 then i'm just going to set it to 20 regardless of the value of the distance here i'm going to go to operators and i'm going to get the bigger than and i want to go to sensing and say distance to mouse pointer okay if distance to mouse pointer like i said is bigger than 200 then i'm going to set the speed to 20. all right and then here what i want to do is i want to add another if okay so i'll say if okay if it's not bigger than 200 then what i want to do so i go back to operators i can get the smaller than sign let me duplicate this okay so if it is smaller than 200 actually let me get the smaller than or equal to i'm gonna get the or and i'll say if distance to mouse pointer is smaller than 200 or equal to 200 okay let me place that right there equal to 200 then what i'm going to do is i'm going to set the speed right let me create some space okay so i'm going to go to my variables and set speed to the okay divide so the distance to the mouse pointer divided by 10. now we can set up a loop to move the ball until it runs out of speed so what we want to do is first we want to start by placing a loop again so go to control and we're going to get repeat until right here that's where we're going to place it and we're going to say repeat until speed is smaller than zero okay we'll go to variables grab speed and smaller than zero and what we want to do next is we're going to say move okay move and then the speed variable okay so move speed step and then we want to change the speed um by minus 0.5 so that we want the ball to slow down while when it's about to reach the hole so we say change feed by minus 0.5 okay and then at the end we also want to make sure that moving and speed are both at zero so set moving to zero and then set speed to zero finally we'll handle the bouncing off the walls part so to do that we'll add an instruction inside the loop we have right now for moving the ball so when the ball touches the collar of the edge of the field then what we're going to do is that it's going to change its direction and start moving that way so due to how angles work we need a different instruction for the vertical and horizontal borders of the field so what we can do is we can add two lines of different colors to the background on the sides of the field so that we can perform two different kinds of checks for changing the direction so what we're going to do is we're also going to say for the upper and lower borders we'll set it up to change the direction by 180 minus the current direction so you can get that direction block from the motion section and then for the horizontal borders the change of direction would be 360 minus the current direction so what i'll do now is i'll go to backdrop all right and then add the lines that i was talking about so here we're going to get the line tool okay and then i'm going to make it a gray color okay all right gray color and then i'm going to place it on the upper and lower parts of the edges so okay i think we'll need to make it make the line a little thicker so i think i'll try eight okay let me change it back to gray all right okay so this is the upper border okay so on one side and then i want another one okay let me make the line just a little bit bigger let's say 12. okay that looks a lot better and then we have another one in this direction okay so that is the other part and then i'll also make a thicker black line here so let's say it's nine or let's say 12. okay let me readjust this part okay let's do even thicker 14 and another part right here 14. all right so now let's go back to code so we want to come back into the ball sprite and then we're going to add in some conditions so we're going to say if we are touching the color black so that is the upper and lower borders okay touching the color black let me use color dropper for this okay we are going to change the direction so we say point in direction and then we're going to do 180 minus its current direction so 180 minus its current direction okay and then we're going to duplicate this condition and set it up for the left and right borders so if touching color let me grab this color right here if touching gray color then we'll do 360 minus the current direction all right so we're done with the first part of this video and let's try to test it out so right now what is going to happen is when i click green flag the ball is going to appear right here it's going to sort of follow my mouse and let's say i move my mouse here and then when i click space the ball is going to follow me to that direction so in the next part we'll adjust the necessary components for the game such as the grass obstacle the water obstacle and hitting the ball into the hole so that's all for today hope you liked the video and don't forget to subscribe and like our other videos also check out the other two videos here while you're waiting for the second part all right thank you bye
