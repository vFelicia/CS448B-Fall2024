hello everyone welcome back to our channel here we share between the friendly coding tutorials on scratch roblox minecraft web programming and many more today we are going to make a fireworks animation using python turtle so in this project we will use randomness and drawing patterns to do some of how works and a message for the fourth of july so it just going to pops up some of the fireworks from random places and then after generating a certain fireworks out it would perform it would like shows up happy 4th of july so yeah just like that so let's get started so first of all we will start by creating a new project and importing the turtle and random libraries okay so we will use these two libraries for drawing and putting the fireworks in the random position so first of all we can do import turntable and import random okay after writing these two codes uh we can begin with the general setup of our program in this case we'll set up our screen to any size that we prefer and we'll make one turtle called my turtle head and then with speed zero so uh it's actually up to you with the setup of the size and the width of nsis in this case we're just going to use wn as a variable equals to turtle screen and set up 500 by 500 in this case and then background color to black all right and then my trello all right so to select a random color for the fireworks we can actually make a list of colors so we can we can then take a random element from blenders and i use that for the color of the fireworks well we're going to start by while making a list called colors and then writing down as many colors as you want well if you want to detail detailed lists of colors so you can use uh we can actually go to the website uh it's called trinket.io there's a bunch of colors that you can actually use and then you can take you can see the name of that and in this case we're just going to add a couple of like uh colors so i'm just going to copy and paste so i have blue red yellow orange purple magna pink lime green gold silver and violet so you can add as many more as you like if you want to okay so now we can actually make some functions so actually draw the fireworks we have to create a function that will be called for each firework that we want to draw the parameter of this function would be the turtle we are going to use to draw the firework we can actually call that t so so we're going to use two random numbers x and y to move the turtle to that position so uh what i'm typing just now is actually creating two random position which is the x and then the y afterwards we're going to generate random numbers using the random integers and while we're going to specify the lower in the files while we already done that so we are going to move the turtle without leaving a trace using pen up before moving the turtle or using go to xy so um we have to pen up first before all or else we're just going to make the whole mess and then we're going to type t go to x and y like that so next we're going to put the pen down and select a random color from the list we already have so t go to x well actually we've done that turn down and then after we did the pen down function we're going to use the well the instruction random dot choice so select the random element from the list colors so like that perfect finally we will create a variable to store the size of the prime work by selecting a random value between well um let's say about 20100 so that it doesn't interfere with the text where we're going to put it on top of the screen so okay so now we can actually create a fireworks the fireworks consist of 36 equal lines that rotate around the same point to create this firework tutorial has to draw a line then rotate we can move the turtle forward backward and then use a for loop to do this for i in range 36 we're going to first forward our pen and then backward then right like that so we finish our base so we're done with the function uh we can now proceed to call the function so cut as many times as you want and i'm going to use well 10 formatted firework number so we're going to use a for loop to call this function repeatedly for the parameter we're going to use the terminal we defined at the beginning of the program so in range 10. and then my turtle like that okay so finally let's code our message at the top of the screen so we're going to use the pen knob and go to so you can move to the top and the center of the screen adjust the numbers depending on the size of the screen change the color to white since the background color is black all right so i will write the messages and write and then the message happy 4th of july type the pen up first and then now while you can specify other options such as the font and then the position of text and then what was the text as as what you want to type change those using align and center in front of equals the type size and wait so after i type happy 4th of july and then this is the final code and well we actually finished everything uh we have the function for drawing and also the pen up and the pen down and then we um create 10 fireworks and then afterwards we're going to generate happy 4th of july after all the fireworks so let's run it so all the artworks are actually showing up and it's in a different position each one has 36 strokes and then at the end there's like the happy fourth of july text so that's it for the project so that's for today well hope you liked this video don't forget to subscribe and like our other videos well also
