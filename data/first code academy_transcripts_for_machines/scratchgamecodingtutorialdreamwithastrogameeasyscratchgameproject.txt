hello everyone welcome to first good academy today we are going to make a simple scratch animation called dream with astro in this project we are going to create an animation on scratch about our future dreams with an character called ashrae my first dream would be to be an astronaut secondly it would be a scientist and lastly my dream is to be a scuba diver so let's go ahead and see how we can make this project on scratch all right in the first step we are going to delete our cat once we delete our cat sprite next we need to add our astro sprite onto the scratch platform so you can find the link to download the pictures for your astro sprites on the description box below so once you have downloaded them next we need to upload them so to upload the image price i'm going to click on the choose a sprite option and i'm going to click on upload sprite option next i'm going to select my three astro images so i'm going to select astro astronaut astro scientist and astro scuba diver then i'm going to click on choose alright since our characters are big in size we need to resize them to be a smaller number so i'm going to click on astro astronaut and i'm going to reduce the size to be 50. same goes for my scientist prime and same goes for my scuba divers let's try all right so next i'm going to rearrange them onto the screen all right next we need to add our three backdrops so i'm going to click on stage and next i'm going to click on backdrops next i'm going to add my three backdrops with a title screen so i'm going to choose a backdrop so for my title screen i would add blue sky so for my astronaut i'm going to click on space and find a space related backdrop so i'm going to click on galaxy next for the side test i'm going to choose my backdrop as bedroom three and lastly for my scuba diver i'm going to click on an underwater backdrop i'm going to click on underwater one next i'm going to delete this plain backdrop now we have our three backdrops with our title screen next i'm going to add my title to my starting screen so i'm going to click on backdrop one and i'm going to click on text option next i'm going to change my color to be blue and i'm going to write cream with sure next i'm going to make it a little bit bigger so that it's going to be shown on my starting screen perfect next i'm going to write a subtitle that is going to tell us how to change our scripts so i'm going to click on the text option again and here i'm going to type and i'm going to make a center awesome now i have done with my starting screen so let's go ahead and code our project so i'm going to click on code while i'm on the stage all right so the first step would be to give the instructions that when i click on the green flag i just start on my starting screen which is the blue sky next i should instruct that while i'm changing backdrops it should play a background sound so i'm going to click on events and i'm going to drag in when the green flag is clicked next i'm going to looks and i'm going to try again switch backdrop to underwater one and i'm going to change it to the starting screen backdrop which is blue sky 2. next i'm going to control and i'm going to add a foreign block so that my sounds keep on playing forever next i'm going to sounds and i'm going to drag in the block called play sound pop until done next i'm going to choose my own background sound so i'm going to click on the sound tabs on the top here and i'm going to my sound library which you can access from here by clicking on the magnifying glass so i'm going to select a lively background music i'm going to find dance and i'm going to add this music dance matching and i'm going to delete the pop sound next i'm going to go back to the code i'm going to change the pop sound to be dance matching all right next i need to give the instructions that when i press my space key i should change my background so i'm going to events and i'm going to drag in the block card when the space key is express next i'm going to looks and i'm going to try again the block call next background awesome now we have finished coding for stage next let's see how we can call our sprites so i'm going to click on the first price that is astronaut all right in order to give our surprise an animated move we need to use costumes so what i'm going to do next would be i'm going to add some costumes for each sprite so first i'm going to click on costume since the astronaut have one costume in order to make multiple costume i'm going to right click and i'm going to click on duplicate which will create you a copy of the existing costume next i'm going to click on the select tool option and i'm going to select the whole astronaut next i'm going to flip my astronaut horizontally and i'm going to drag it upwards in order to give the moving effect that the astronaut is floating on space so i'm going to the first costume of astronaut and select this tool and then i'm going to select the whole astronaut and i'm going to bring it downwards so it'll be going from this to this next i'm going to add another costume while making my astronaut to be slightly rotated i'm going to duplicate another costume and select on this tool and select the whole astronaut like that make sure you're covering the whole astronaut when you're drawing the select two rectangle and i'm going to click on this rotation parameters and i'm going to rotate it like that next i'm going to repeat the same costume by flipping it horizontally i'm going to duplicate it once more and using the select tool i'm going to select the astronaut and i'm going to click on click horizontal and i'm going to rotate it a little bit slightly towards the lefthand side right now the astronaut have full cost here that is going to show you a floating moment awesome so let's go ahead add change the costumes for our scientist friend i'm going to click on scientists for the scientist i'm going to change the color of my liquid that is present on the test tube so i'm going to create a duplicate of this cost here and i'm going to use my magnifying glass in order to zoom in into the picture so i'm going to click on plus magnifying glass next i'm going to click on the brush tool and to change the color of the portion i'm going to give a different color and paint it so i'm going to duplicate another costume and i'm going to change the color of my portion and lastly i'm going to create another costume for my scientist and again with a different colored portion awesome so once we have created four costumes for our scientist right let's create some costumes for our scuba diver spray i'm going to click on screw by diamond and i'm going to duplicate the scooper diamond and i'm going to click on select two and select the whole section of school but i want like that and i'm going to flip the scuba diver horizontally and slightly or rotate it towards the right hand side a little bit next i'm going to draw a tube around that scuba diver to show that the scuba diver can flow i'm going to click on the paint brush too and i'm going to draw a tube around the scuba diver and i'm going to change the thickness of this to be 50. awesome so now once we have created the costumes for our surprise let's go ahead and code it so i'm going to start with my astronauts fry and i'm going to click on code tab all right so in the astronaut sprite first i need to code that when i click on the green flag it should be showing on my starting screen i'm going to click on events and i'm going to drag in when the green flag is clear so i'm going to click on looks and i'm going to bring the block mod switch costume to astronaut 4 and i'm going to change it to the first costume of my astronaut so in order to make sure that in my starting screen the astronaut is is shown with the first costume next i'm going to looks and i'm going to set up the position of my astronaut and i'm going to try again go to xn1 so right now the x and y is going to show you the current location of my astronaut boy so i'm not going to change it next i need to give the instructions that when it is on the star screen i should show while on my other screens i should hide my astronaut spread so i'm going to events and i'm going to drag in when the backdrop switches to and i'm going to change it to be galaxy so i'm going to look and i'm going to drag in the show block and again i'm going to set up the starting position so i'm going to try again go to x and y next i'm going to change in the position to be 0 and 0 so that the astronaut starts on the middle of the screen next i'm going to instruct that it should change onto the first question so i'm going to change onto the first costume of my astronaut next i'm going to instruct my astronaut to say a sentence that is going to say i want to be an astronaut so i'm going to looks and i'm going to drag again say hello block for two seconds and i'm going to change this message to b i want to e let's and all right next i'm going to change my costume by using a repeat block in order to give the animate movement so i'm going to control and i'm going to drag in repeat 10 block next i'm going to looks and inside this repeat i'm going to ensure that astronauts should change its costumes so i'm going to try again the next costume block and put it inside the repeat block in order to give a smooth changing effect of costumes i'm going to add a weight type so i'm going to ctrl and i'm going to drag in wait one second block and i'm going to make it 0.5 seconds all right so i'm going to add another next costume block and finally i'm going to add another big block which is going to be 0.5 okay so we need to ensure that when the backdrop changes to the underground and the room the sprite astronaut should be hidden so i'm going to drag in the event block call when the backdrop is just two i'm going to make it bedroom three next i'm going to hide my sprite so i'm going to repeat the same block but this time i'm going to change the backdrop to be underwater and again i'm going to hide it all right now i need to make sure that once i'm in my underground backdrop and when i click on the space key again let's just start on my starting screen so i'm going to give the event call when the backdrop switches to blue sky i'm going to show the costume again and in this position so i'm going to motion and i'm going to drag again go to xn1 so this would be our final chord for our astronaut spread next we are going to create the school blocks for our scientists all right first i need to instruct that when i click on the green flag the scientist should be on my first costume so i'm going to event and i'm going to drag in when the green flag is clear and next i'm going to looks and i'm going to try again switch costume block and i'm going to change it to be astro scientist which is my first costume next i need to instruct that when the backdrop switches to the room backdrop i should change my costume of my spread so i'm going to add the event called when the backdrop switches i'm going to add a repeat so that it keeps on repeating the costumes or changing my costume and i'm going to add a save block that is going to make my sprite to speak a message so i'm going to speak a message like so next i'm going to go to my looks block and i'm going to drag in next costume block so i'm going to add a weight block so that i can see my costumes being changed smoothly i'm going to control and i'm going to try again wait one second left and i'm going to change the time to be 0.5 seconds next i need to instruct that when the backdrop switches to the galaxy and the underwater i should hide my scientist spray i'm going to events and i'm going to try i'm going to drag in the block called when the backdrop switches to and i'm going to change to be galaxy so next i'm going to the looks block and i'm going to try again high block so i'm going to repeat the same codes again so i'm going to drag in another one backdrops it choose to block which is going to be underwater 1 and i'm going to hide my scientist spray so now i need to make sure that once i reach the underwater backdrop and when i click on the space bar it should go back onto my starting screen with my scientist being shown so i'm going to erase and i'm going to drag in when backdrops just do this time scientist should be sure awesome so once we have done our code blogs for our scientists right so let's go ahead and code our scuba diver spray so once again i need to instruct that when i click on the green flag i should be switched to my first costume and onto the exact location on my starting screen so i'm going to events and i'm going to drag you when the green flag is clicked next i'm going to locks and i'm going to drag in switch costume to block and i'm going to change it to be the first costume next i'm going to set up my starting location so i'm going to motion and i'm going to try again go to x and y plot so since i'm going to start with this location on my starting screen for my scuba divers fry i'm going to keep the x and y coding is as it is all right next i need to instruct that once the backdrop switches to the underwater i should move my scuba diver spray to the middle of the screen and then change costume all right so i'm going to events and i'm going to drag in when the backdrops you choose two and i'm going to change it to the underwater backdrop next i'm going to looks and i'm going to drag in the show so next i need to set up the position such that the scuba diver starts moving from the middle of the screen so i'm going to motion and i'm going to bring it go to x and y and this time i'm going to change x to be 0 and y to be 0. next i need to make my scuba diver to speak out a message so i'm going to look and i'm going to try again say hello for two seconds block and i'm going to change the message to b all right so next i'm going to drag in a repeat block so i'm going to control and i'm going to drag in repeat 10 block next i'm going to looks and i'm going to drag in next cost here and i'm going to give away time so i'm going to control and i'm going to drag in wait time and change it to be 0.5 seconds next i need to make sure that my scooper driver is hidden when the backdrop switches to the galaxy and the blue backdrops so i'm going to event and i'm going to drag in the image one backdrop switches to galaxy i need to hide it so i'm going to look and hide blur and i'm going to repeat the same with my wrong background so i'm going to drag in when backdrop switches to bedroom 3 and i'm going to hide it next i need to make sure that once again when i'm at my underwater backdrop and when i click on this face key the scooper driver should be starting on this position in my starting screen so i'm going to bring my final block which is called when the backdrop switches to blue sky i'm going to show it again and next i'm going to motion and i'm going to bring the block called go to x and y with its current location awesome so now we have completed our project with our code blocks the costumes and the stage so let's go ahead and click on the green flag so let's press on the space key that is my first dream to be an astronaut my second dream which is to be a scientist lastly my dream is to be a scuba diver so that's it for today i hope you enjoyed this project don't forget to give us a thumbs up if you like it and don't forget to hit the subscribe button to get more updates on new tutorials
