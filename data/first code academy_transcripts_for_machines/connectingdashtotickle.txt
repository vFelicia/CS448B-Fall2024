hello everyone so today we're gonna look at how do we connect to tickle we're gonna learn to unlock the wonderful world of coding through programming using a great tool called tickle so let's begin before conducting to tickle we need a few things first we need an iPad second we need the tickle app on the iPad and then third which is one of the most important things is we need so make sure you don't forget because if you start programming with no robot then that's gonna be a bit weird you may be wondering where do I download the it to collab it's that's very very simple there are two ways to do it you can head to the app store and type in tickle school edition and the app will look like what's in the picture then you can just download it or you can always open your iPad camera scan the QR code in this picture and once you scan the QR code it's going to have a little box popup which says view an app store you can click on that and that will take you to the tickle school Edition link in the app store then you can begin downloading it so hope everything works out well and then you should have the tickle app on your iPad in no time turn on we just click on this button here and once it's on should start moving and reacting then we can begin with connecting first to tickle so we're going to look at how we can connect to tickle and then once that's done we can begin the wonderful world of programming with so let's begin so we're gonna look at how to connect to tickle first we need to click on the Settings icon and then we're gonna click on bluetooth and then turn on our glutens after that is done we can click back on the home button and then we can open tickle right over here so once tickle is open we can click on new project and then scroll down and as you scroll down you'll see and dot then we'd like you to click on that so here you see a piece of code you can leave it as it is for now and then we want you to click on dash here so it says right now disconnected and you can see your radar just searching so make sure that your dash is on so I'm gonna put mine on and once it's on it will detect the connection and it will tell you what is the his name and we'll show you dashes icon once that's there you click on it then it's going to show dashes battery icon which makes it known that it's connected once you've connected to tickle you may now start programming hope you have fun in this clip we're gonna look at how we can disconnect from tickle in case you wanna charge or you want to stop programming with so let's begin it let's look at that so suppose now you want to disconnect your dash all you have to do is click on it here and then it says connected you can just click on this icon here and it'll say it is connected it's on your bottom right so that's how you disconnect
