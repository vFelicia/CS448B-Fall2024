so yeah for today what I thought would be cool to do is to because of the past couple of weeks of the virus and we are you know we're stuck at home and a lot of times we you know I spend a lot of time playing video games or watching TV and I thought maybe we were just you know spend some time to create an app together and so while we're waiting for more people to join go ahead and if you want to follow along with this studio this tutorial if you want to join a long code along with me go ahead to this link here App Inventor where you need your laptop to access and I will be guiding you all to create an app together and it will be a short app that I designed for specifically for this stressful time for everyone and let me show you guys how it looks okay so here is how the app look and I designed this app because I thought that it would it might be nice to have an app on our phone that we could open up and remind us to take a deep breath and sometimes we might be very anxious in looking at the screen and looking at all the news that is happening and so how it works is that there is a button at the bottom which is hidden here but whenever you click on them give me a tip you actually are able to show it again the app would show you different tips to to take a deep breath and real so with that I am going to start with our project so yep so let's go ahead and start a new project and let's call it a brief app okay so I'm on the MIT App Inventor web interface and the link is commented down below and if you want to follow along definitely welcome to do that and how it works is that we will be using this app designer to create the interface the design of our app and then we will go inside to our blocks to create our logic and our code so yeah the next thing that we're gonna do is to remember our app we have our title first so we can call it take and remember so you can actually change this text to any colors and I'll change that to yellow because we'll have a background later on I will also change it to the width as wide as the screen and also put the text in the center so I know that this is a little bit difficult to read right now so what I'll do now is to upload a background image that I found just now so it'll just take a minute to upload it on the on a pin sensor there you go so we actually have our background image nicely put in the middle in the screen and what we need to do next is to add a an image so we're at an image here and we will also add a text which is if you remember earlier there's a quote that we show to our users that hey you know look no matter how like this is a quote that you can read and it will come will give us some give us some inspiration and lastly is a button for us to choose you know to ask the the app to prompt us another nice relaxation so I will write down here give me a relaxing tip and really we can use whatever we want to like to just prompt the user to click on the the app and what we will do is to go ahead and put in so I'll make it as wide as the screen and so here the width as fill parents I will also make our font size bigger just to make it easier to see so what I want to do is that when when the user open up the app I actually don't want these two image and the text to show up yet so what I'll do is to choose to select the image here and click physical like uncheck the visible next we will do the same for label 2 which is the cult label for us and what I'll do here as well is actually to change it to the quote label clicking rename here so this will help us remember what these quotes what the label is for because we have two labels on our screen and then afterwards we will change it to we will actually change the fonts as well to yellow and change it to invisible for now so comment down below if you oh the screen is not showing the coding interesting oh yeah that's right okay so thanks for pointing it out so I forgot to a Switzer screen here so can you guys see it now okay thanks Winnie okay all right um I think I'll move my face down a little okay thank you so much for your patience everyone I am still learning how to do that this is very fun and okay I will change where my screen is and so okay let me start from the beginning yeah so I'll start from the beginning what I did here is yeah what I did here in the beginning is to drag a label so here is the App Inventor here is the App Inventor interface if you guys want to log in together and follow together the first step that we need to do is to drag a label onto the screen so this is the label and okay and then I have changed the text to take a deep breath and what I did here is also to change the text color to yellow and the font size of 30 and mix I want to change the background and so for the background image what I did is to choose the screen and change the background and by uploading a file it could be anything it could be a cat or a dog that you like for me I change it to a nice peaceful screen of clouds and ocean and next now we can see the nice background with the text and next we have also included an image here so the image is in turn is under the user interface and we can actually drag the image onto the screen and click physical as uncheck the visible the same thing we want to do for Holt label changing a text to yellow up first and then uncheck the visible function as well now with the last bit is the button 1 so button 1 is the first item on the interface and what I did just now is to change the text to give me a relaxing tip and thanks we have our background color I change it to blue because it matches with the ocean and also I created I made the font size bigger and so that is easier for everyone to read awesome so well after that we have all the components as needed on our screen so what we need to do next is to actually upload a file upload a couple of files so I would about the yoga file that I downloaded earlier I would upload the bathtub file and then I will also upload a meditate photo so here is where you upload the files such that you can use it in the code area so after you've uploaded three different images it could be other things than these three ones as well it doesn't have to be the same as mine and we will go ahead and switch into our blocks and then we are going to also make the quotes visible as well because when we first start the app we had made the main code the two components invisible all right so there we go we have finished our app tutorial here and this is a quick app that we can do for this time of coronavirus and we're constantly tens and basically feel like there's a lot happening and I would really highly encourage us to try making this app and what you can do to test this app out is to click the build function and choose if you have an Android device you can use the QR code to scan it and test it on your phone if you don't no worries you can also save it on your computer and there are android simulators that are you can test out on your computer test your app out on your computer right away so I use BlueStacks and right now I cannot I cannot seem to to show this on the screen but basically how it works is that you can download BlueStacks and you can then use it to test out your apps right on your computer and so all you need to do is to save apk file to your computer and you will be able to play around with your app so yeah that's it from me and I want to cost here a little bit I thank you so much for joining everyone so you guys have any mark Marvin thanks for joining thanks for joining also Donna as well so do you guys have any questions or anything or or any ideas of apps you would want to see tutorials or I plan to do the Facebook live once a week at least and yeah comment down below if you have any ideas of apps or games that you think that might be fun to do together and I love to hear from you guys thank you I'll see you in the next life
