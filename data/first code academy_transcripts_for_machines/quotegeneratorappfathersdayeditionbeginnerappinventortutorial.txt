hello everyone welcome back to our channel here we share beginner friendly coding tutorials on scratch roblox minecraft web programming and many more today we are going to design a quote generator in app inventor in this project i will teach you how to create your own quote generator for father's day celebration on app invented it's basically an app that generates a random quote from the list you provide once you shake the device so let's get started we'll start by creating a new empty project on app inventor from this screen we'll change its title to happy father's day so for us to do that we just have to scroll down through the properties column and over here you'll see the title which is currently screen one that's the default title but since we want to change it to happy father's day you'll notice once we scroll back and look at the screen now we've changed the screen title into happy father's day then we'll add three components to make our project work first we'll add a label which is under the user interface section so once you click user interface you'll notice there's a label we want to click on that and drag it into the screen and there you have it secondly we want to add a accelerometer sensor which could be found in the sensor section down here you'll notice this is an accelerometer sensor same thing we drag it in and drop it and you'll notice it's a nonvisible component which means it's something you cannot see okay awesome last we're going to need to add a text to speech object which is found in the media section so we'll click on media and we will find the text to speech over here drop it and there you have it we got another nonvisible component and we got three total components so the label will display our father's day message the accelerometer will be used to detect when we shake the phone and the text to speech can be used to say out loud our message now we want to change the design of our screen so there's actually a couple ways to do that you can either add a background picture or make it a plain color let me show you how to do this so i decided to add a background color for me to be able to do that i can just click on upload file over here at the bottom of your screen in the media section and once i click on that i get to choose a file and i'm going to choose a file from my downloads and choose it and click ok and there you'll notice that there's something added now into our media and that's the the picture that i've uploaded so we want to save it then we want to go to the background image in the screen configuration and upload that image so for us to be able to do that we would have to go to screen one and you'll notice here there's a background image and it currently says none and that's why our background color is empty or our background image so we click on it and you'll notice now we have the media that we've uploaded so we just have to click ok and there you have it this is the image i uploaded and now it's showing on my screen so in here you can also change the alignment of your label so for us to do that we can just click on align horizontal which is currently says left and that's why you'll notice that our label is on the left but since we want to put that in the middle for better presentation we just want to click on center and there you have it awesome okay so next thing we want to do is we want to change the labels text into something more meaningful so we can easily do that by clicking on the label and changing the text instead of text for label one we want to put a meaningful message so perhaps something like shake for a father's day message that way it's not just a title but it's an instruction as well so shake for a father's day message awesome and we can even change the font size if it's a little bit too small for you we can change from 14 to 20 and there you go it's much clearer so make sure it reads as any instruction and maybe a meaningful message and you're good with that now we can move on to the coding section so we want to start off by creating a new variable i'll name it quotes so i'm just going to click on the variable section and i'm going to initialize a global name instead of global name however i want to change the name to quotes and then i want to attach a list to that so for us to be able to do that we can go ahead and click on list and we just want to make a list you'll notice we can only add two things onto the list since there's only two connectors over here and since i want to add a list of five quotes i can click on this blue button and add three more items into the list one two three and click on the button again and now you'll notice i have five connectors and so for me to be able to add um a code for each i can just click on text and get this empty string block and i'm just going to add five of those awesome here we have it perfect and this is the fun part now we can add five different quotes uh that we'd want so i got five ready uh my first one will be number one dad in the world all right second i want to say i'm so proud to be your kid and another one would be you make growing up fun and next i'm going to say dad you're in all my favorite memories and lastly i want to say you're the best at awesome there you got it so you don't necessarily have to follow my quotes you can find your own quotes create your own quotes feel free to do that the last part is also pretty simple we need to make it so that when we shake the phone we display a random quote remember that randomness is when we don't want we don't know what the next outcome is going to be first of all this event will happen when we shake the phone so we're going to start off by grabbing the when accelerometer sensor 1 dot shaking block from the accelerometer sensor 1 section so you'll notice here we got the this event which is exactly what we need and inside of this block we can put all the instructions we want to run when we shake the phone so first we will set the label to the random message so for us to be able to do that we need to go to the label one section and we can use the set label one text to block to change the text of the label so like i said you go to the label one set label one dot text and we want to add that in and we want to set that to a random item in the list so for us to be able to do that there's actually a block that gives us a random item which is found in the list you can go ahead grab that block and plug it in and we want to get that random item from our quotes list or quotes variable so over here in variables uh we can just get this block and assign it the variable name called quotes awesome last thing we need to do is we want to get the text to speech block which will be found over here and we want to get the call text to speech dot speed block so we want to add that in and in terms of the message we want to make it the text of label one so over here in text oh sorry over in label one i'm gonna get e label label1 dot text so over here uh the message will simply be the text we set before which we can see as a light green block below which is the set text to label one so there you have it awesome you can now show your dad this project to celebrate father's day and here we have the finished project good job so that's all for today i hope you enjoyed the video don't forget to
