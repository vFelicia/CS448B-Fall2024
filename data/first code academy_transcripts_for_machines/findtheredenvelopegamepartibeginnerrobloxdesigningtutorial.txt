hello everyone welcome back to our channel here we share beginner friendly tutorial videos on scratch roblox minecraft web programming and many more and today we're going to create a roblox treasure hunt game so in this project we will be creating a roblox treasure hunt game called red envelope hunt quest and the idea of the project is that the players have to find 10 rep envelopes within 5 minutes and these red envelopes are hidden inside the buildings that we're going to add to our game and this tutorial is in two parts the first part of the tutorial would be game scene design in which i will teach you how to create the game using roblox studio and in the second part i'll be teaching you how to code the project using code kingdoms so let's get started all right so let's go ahead and create our game scene so first i'm going to code kingdoms to create a custom project and i'm going to rename the project as red envelope quest and i am also going to select it as a base plate all right and we can go ahead and click start okay then i'm going to go ahead and add a new file called red envelope which is an object and i'm going to add it as a local behavior all right so add red envelope okay object and local behavior and go ahead and add it then all right after we have created our project we want to download it and open it in roblox studio all right okay now that we have the project downloaded into roblox studio the next thing we want to do is we want to create a ground so we want to choose part right here okay and we want to change the material to be concrete all right concrete and we want to change the color to either black or gray to give sort of the natural effect of a road and then we're going to stretch it using the scale tool right here okay to make it cover the base plate and then we also want to anchor it okay so i'm going to scale it right now all right now the next thing i'm going to do is i'm going to use the toolbox function right here all right to add buildings into my city now you can choose any buildings that you like but make sure that you can open them and go inside as some model buildings are you can find in the toolbox do not allow your characters to go inside all right so i'm gonna go ahead and add in a coffee shop okay and then i'm gonna go ahead and add it right here okay and i also want to rotate it like so okay and then i'm gonna go ahead and add in a domino's pizza okay so domino's pizza all right so i have my domino's pizza right here i will put it in front of the coffee shop all right and then i want to go ahead and add a bakery as well so i'm gonna switch that up right here okay all right let me place it right next to the coffee shop okay and then i'm going to add in a library okay let's place that okay right next to the bakery let's go ahead and also rotate it alright then i want to go and add a shop all right and the last thing i'm going to add after the shop is a shopping center i'm going to go ahead and add this one right here okay and we'll place it in the space we have around there okay now the next thing we want to do is we want to add a spawn location in the middle of the city so that we can easily access or move around okay so we'll get a spawning point okay and we want to place it in the middle of the city sits right around there okay all right now that we have the spawn place okay we will be making the red envelopes or your treasures so what we want to do is we want to choose part okay so let's close up the toolbox we want to choose part a right there and we want to go ahead and change the material to the plastic all right and the color to red okay right here and we're going to read rename this part as red envelope okay and in this part we also want to add some sparkles so first of all let's go ahead and rename them okay rename them to red envelope all right then let's add some sparkle all right so let's sparkle okay and just click on that and then we have it okay so now we're going to create 10 of these envelopes so we need to duplicate them and we can use this component right here to duplicate it all right so we'll go ahead duplicate duplicate until we have 10 of them all right so i'm at my 10th one so right click duplicate now we have 10 of them right so if we move them out we have three four five six seven eight nine and ten okay all right now the next thing we want to do is by using the move tool okay in our home we can place the red envelopes inside the buildings now we can make them difficult to find by placing them in places which are hard to find like under a chair or in a faraway room okay and some buildings can also have one envelope or two envelopes and some will have even more all right let's go ahead and do that all right i've hidden all my 10 envelopes for example i have hidden one here in the library in the second floor so the players would have to climb up this stair right here to be able to reach it okay so now we are going to create the time so to do that we need to create a countdown timer and we're going to add a screen gui gui stands for graphical user interface and it's used to display information about the game such as time in this case to the player okay so the way to do that is we go to view click on explorer all right and we want to scroll down and find screen gui i have one right here let me delete it first yeah we want to find our starter gui sorry and we want to click on this plus sign and insert screen gui all right now we want to click on screen gui and then click this plus sign and add in a text label all right so it's right here now to make this text label bigger we can click right and then it's going to highlight the text label component all right and we can go to view and open properties and in the properties we're going to scroll down to the text section okay right here and in the text part okay so first of all let's change the text inside we'll make it count down timer okay and this part next part is we're going to increase the text size so we can put in 30 for example right so after we put in 30 now you can see our countdown timer the text is much bigger now the next thing we want to do is we want to go back to our text label so i'm just going to close that all right and we want to insert a script so we can click right and then we can go ahead and click on script okay so let's delete print hello world for now okay and what we want to do is we want to code the timer and the timer is going to start at 300 so five minutes in seconds all right and then it ends at minus one negative one and since the loop will minus one each time it will create the effect that there is a countdown okay so the way you do that is start with the loop while true do or i equals 300 beginning right 300 seconds okay wait one it's just a buffer time and then script dot script dot parent dot text okay we'll make it equal to countdown i and it will say if script dot parent dot text equals to count down negative one then script dot parent destroy like so all right so after we have added the script right here then we have completed our game scene and you can now test the game to see if you can move around and inside and out of the building to find the envelopes and you would notice that the time's also running on the screen all right so now i'm gonna test if our countdown timer is working i'm gonna go ahead and click play all right so as you can see now the timer is counting down and let's try to go inside the library okay which is right here all right all right so here i can go ahead and grab our red envelope right here so that's all for today in the next tutorial we'll learn how to code the game by adding a score system to the game to count how many red envelopes have been found and make sure to subscribe to our channel to check out the next section of this project and don't forget to hit the like button thank you bye
