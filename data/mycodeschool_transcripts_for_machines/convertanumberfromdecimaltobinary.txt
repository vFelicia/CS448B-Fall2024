in this lesson we will see how to convert a number from decimal number system to binary number system now converting a number from decimal to binary is essentially finding all the digits of the number in its binary representation let us first see how to find the digits of a number in its decimal presentation and then we will come back to binary so if i write a number in decimal number system the right most digit corresponds to one's position and then we have tens position hundreds position and we go on in powers of ten now if i write a number in decimal number systems say for example hundred and twenty five then let's look at it this way one twenty five is actually got one twenty five ones but we do not write all these ones into the ones column but we do is actually take out all the tens from these ones and keep only the remaining ones in the ones column so we say that one thirty five ones is actually test ends and fight once and only this five goes to the once called him begin because i keep all the strength and simple depends column so we take out while the hundred suck at this and keep a lid that you meaning dents in the dance club school is here no he cannot take part powell's and out of this one hundred sought at this one hundred actually close to two hundred school so if i have the number one twenty five if i divided but then i get trellis quotient excuse me the number of danced finest amanda that gets me that in many months and effective go presidents finnegan division bike then gives this one at school shinde which is the number of hundreds and to elicit amended which is the number of symington ps not dividing one bite and gets a single which is the number of paul's ends and again one in the commander of it is the number ralph hundreds now if you can see this war trusses is actually giving bus on the desert softer number starting from that act was to get to the left most urgent and if people in the demands upon them from bottom to top beget the number what are the the deserts of the number from left to right if we say that this leftmost column isbn than the portion can be obtained and biked and and picking up one indeed look like a fake and the demand it can be achieved by performing in and want to look down now if you can see then began acting a device to neglect the miracle converter numbered n pilates but we should say actually to find out all the dates of the number novel who quickly like a pseudo code for this pride in that period find deserts in decimal backfill taken input and give me a list of for the business the decimal representation of the number david stark bataan empty list and even keep filling the list as we find out of the desserts so this list in an actual program and i don't think the ages of and had a rough connector or whatever suits you and program close like while any discrepancy at all befall them our deal bipin and store the value never even called him and uh... not this commander is actually that does it in the first called the rightmost eject at this stage it to the list so would say that this does not list system and uh... now did you send to and biked and then if and is an integer this one of us give us the portions when we get out of this loop beget and they stop all the biz itself the number in its decimal form but to get this list from right to left handed out the number from left to right so decode divorce the latest to get the number well it or the deserts from left or right sort of say that could reverse the list knockin putting a number from testimony combined that he is nothing but finding out all the deserts of the number and it's finally the presentation now as we know in a pine tree number type most digital response to one's position and in the house tools for states petition and equal on increasing powersoft too so one of the deserts repeated or something similar to what the abandoned left or other create two columns here quotient and amanda now we start with two hundred and ninety five so initially we have hundred and twentyfive once but because i keep all these months into the ones column so we take out all the pillows and this time we need to divide bechtel to take a call that goes to this gives us the portion cassese sixty two oh two was and remaining one once not this one goes to loved ones petition here in behalf sixty photos so we need to take a look at the force from this would be a game to i'd like to pretty blunt force and remaining and this goes to the plus column and igor like this so if they see that this particular column the leftmost condoms and then the portion can be completed s and bike too and people into thinking that part of it and to demand that can be completed by n modelo too and we can keep on going and feeling the deserts from back to left and p stop once the get unsettling the cautioned so now we can see that the demand data from bought them cooktop is actually giving us while the desert softer nobody makes by nearly the presentation so they can say that the number two hundred and twentyfive and based and exactly one one one one ones that are one and by new york bistro well it's good to write a program for this as well the program is pretty similar to finding the desert in decimal except that this time they're finding because it's in binary submitted that find is it's invited me but if it suits you better be built the new internet address that some of the bank v video game starts with an empty list and try to fill this up for the deserts in the binary file and this time to say that one and mister clinton's middle calculate the demand uh... by performing a model bike too and then had this to the list and the standard use and to entitled and if anything did you discuss esta cautioned finally p again give us the list because the need is it's from left to right so this pretty much gets a support gun but the numbers from dismantled by nidhi and thus the look fine put on positive integers end is equal to zero tolerance however especially cases which we have mark and then because in back is the list will remain and because a controlling about calling too personal heated to handle it gracefully in york actually program and i'll leave it for you to do it not this also gives us but genetic about on kind off the typical are going to find out number in any base b so if you want a converted number from testament to be speed well you have to do with the steel sticking them why do you like to hear and division by two head of the divide by the number of being taken money no baby and this will give us the number in any basically you should be good so thanks for watching
