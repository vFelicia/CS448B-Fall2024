so what is binary number system and why is it so famous long ago when civilization probably started we humans discovered a number system that would have exactly ten digits and this number system was called decimal number system and the digits in this number system would be zero one two three four five six seven eight and nine not so long ago another number system became famous at the language of computers and this was called the binary number system a binary number system would have only two digits zero and one if a number system has n digits we say that the base of the number system is n so decimal number system can also be called base ten number system and similarly binary number system can also be called base two number system now why does a computer understands binary and the simplest explanation can be that a computer is an electrical device and all electrical device understands is electrical signals so say for example if we have an input wire to this machine there are only states possible for this wire either current is flowing through this wire or current is not flowing through this wire if current is flowing through this wire we say that the state of this wire this input is signaled and we say that a signal state corresponds to one and if current is not flowing this is not signaled then we say that not signal state corresponds to a zero so a zero or one invited the actually translates to a signal or non signal state in an electrical device and we can have multiple wires or multiple inputs to represent multiple ones and zeros now let us quickly see how we write a number these two number system if we write a number in decimal number system and if we go back to our elementary school mathematics then we write number in one row and multiple columns the right most column corresponding to the right most digit is called the ones place second right column is called the tens place and we go on increasing in multiple of tens like hundreds place and thosounds place and so on if we have to the represent this in powers of ten then the right most place or the least significant digit corresponds to the ten to the power zero and go on like ten to the power one ten to the power two ten to the power three and so on and as we go on towards left we go on increasing in power of tens say for example if we write a number one twenty five in decimal number system we say that this number has got five ones two tens and one hundred we could also say that this number has got five ten to the power zeros two ten to the power one and one ten to the power two and this sums up to one twenty five now when we write a number in binary number system the only digits possible are zero and one the right most column corresponds to the ones position second right column corresponds to twos position and we go on increasing in powers of two like fours position eights position and so on and if we have to write the same thing in powers of twos this corresponds to two to the power zero two to the power one and so on and similarly we can go on we can keep going towards left in powers of two now let us write a number in binary so let's say we become a number one one one one one zero one so we say that this is got one one zero twos one four and we could also say that this is got one two the power zero zero to the power one and one two the power two and we can go on so to find out the place value of a digit in binary number system we multiply the digit one or zero by the corresponding power of two so if to pick up the seventh column from left so the place value here is calculated by multiplying the number one with two the power six so we get this so if we want to convert a number from binary to decimal number system it is pretty straightforward well you need to do is pick up all these place values and sum of them up and if you try to sum this up this comes as hundred and twenty five so one one one one one zero one in binary is actually number one twenty five in decimal number system so we say practice number one one one one one zero one in base two is actually hundred and twenty five in base ten now in this lesson we did not describe how we got this number one one one one one zero one in binary for one twenty five we will do it in the next lesson so in the next lesson we will show you how to convert a number from decimal number system to binary number system so thanks for watching
