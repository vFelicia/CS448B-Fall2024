in our previous lesson we wrote and executed our first 'C' program. We printed hello world on screen .We used gcc compiler which runs from command line to compile our program now in this lesson we will see how we can use compiler that we call integrated development environments or IDEs to write compile and execute our program. IDEs give you a rich editor, a nice user interface and a bunch of features that help you manage big projects and detect errors in your program. Some of the IDEs that you can use for C are DEVCPP, this is a light one. There is another one named Code Blocks Visual Studio Express edition. This one is by Microsoft and this is what I will use in most of the lessons in this series there is another one named Eclipse for C/ C++ typically an IDE would support both C and C plus plus I D E and compiler, you can use these terms for each other that's what we do practically. There is one more thing that I want to point out it's good if your compiler follows the latest standards for C language. There are some compilers that are too outdated like Turbo C I would not recommend using this. You can use any among the rest. I will come back to showing how you can use some of these IDEs but first I'll open the program that we had written in our previous lesson A compiler takes a C source file, a compiler for C will take a C source file and create an executable file. if there is a syntactical error in your program , compilation fails compiler gives you error messages that we call compilation errors. compilation errors should help you fix your program for example it's a rule that every statement in C must end with a semicolon let's remove this semicolon from here and now lets compile this file using gcc to compile we would give gcc space the C source file name, Now as you can see I am getting some error message here. It's saying that in function int main(), at line 6, a semicolon is expected. if I would fix this error put a semicolon at the end of this printf statement save the file and then compile again there is no error. If there would be a compilation error no fresh executable file will be created if compilation passes, an executable file named a.exe will be created afresh. you can run this executable file from command line if you would like to give your executable file a name of your choice in gcc, while using gcc, what you can do is you can type in gcc source file name space minus O and then you type in the name that you want for executable. For example let's say I want HelloWorld.exe, then I'll just say HelloWorld With this and executable file named HelloWorld.exe is created you can check it from command line also, type in DIR to list all the files in the directory and now you can run HelloWorld.exe please note that I am wanna bindles machine things will be pretty similar on a Linux machine you would not have a fight he with extension expe you would have a fight with extension out so you can create something like Hello void doc out now the even see how we can come by I'll and execute our program in some of these ID ease the village secured the scene program to print hello world I have opened up Dave CPP on what feels like I def c plus plus compiler I would recommend watching this part of to be due in full screen for Becca Plata de now the first thing that we need to do is we need to create a/c source file and this time we do not need to use an external editor like Notepad go to File in the menu at the top here then new and click on source file you also have pushed a keyboard shortcut for this and it'll open and editor for you in the ided itself where you can type in your court and read the same program to print hello world on screen this time they're getting these nice color courts as you can see these keywords in Denver tonight in Boyd this forced languages celebrity defense is in some other color the skull of course improve third ability of your program now the next thing that we need to do is need to save dis source file to see if he did press control plus S key gonna go to File antique on Save or Save As this dialogue will open into struck down save this tape select see source file and then give a name for the source file and give named Dave CPP hello once I click on save my C++ source file is created now I can come by on my program to comply go to execute in the menu at the top here and click on compile you also have a keyboard shortcut control plus f9 key for this when you were taken compiled this popup will come and if everything is alright and executed will be created in the scene for reader where you would have saved your source file the name of the executable will be seen as the name of the source fired so if my source file is Dave CPP hello dart see my executable is Dave CPP hello doc expe as fear teen million weekend double click this executed by then try to run the program but something will flash and gore made the machine will start and finish the execution of program in no time if you want to see the output you can run the executable from command line go to the folder where they execute a bill is from the command line and type in the name of the executable file so this may be able to see the output die idee also gives you option to fund the program you can go to execute and second run there is a keyboard checkered control plus f10 for this bike this is same as double clicking the executable file something will flash and go away quickly the program the start and finish its execution in no time before you can see the output to see the output of program by double clicking on the executors Bernard by using this an option in the menu here we can put hacked in our program so what I'm going to do here it is am first going to right are comment in my program if you would write the line in your program starting with two forward slashes backline is a comment in your program it will be ignored by the compiler when compiling it will not be considered a valid see statement it will not be considered a/c statement to be executed and now I'll draped to see statements these two statements you're saying that the program must de Cannes integer as input from the user so when you would run the program the program bill wait for you to enter an integer let's compile and run discord and see what happens compilation a successful and now i cant run as you can see this console display has come here earlier it would come and go in no time now because it's waiting for you to input some integer it's there and you can see hello world on screen if I would press any key on the keyboard now and press enter the console Rico a mi some ladies automatically paused execution of your program in the end and show you the output so you do not have to put a hack like this Dave c plus plus doesn't do that and always remember that this is a hack different people put different kind of hacks some people use a function named gets %eh which is sparked off on your doc it's like Betty this function gets %eh will make your program feet I did you pass some key but call your doc it is not a standard celebrity it will not be supported by many come by a nurse so it is not clear commended if you would have some editing your program then upon combining you would get the editor and I D E let's remove the semicolon here and try to combine the program and see what happens it would be this month for you to see it saying they act at line 5 there we have it done statement dead is a syntex better before this line as a Newbie as a big a nerd in programming accomplish in it and would often scare you it's important that you read the entire message carefully and try to see a program and fixed our completion at Ash if I would produce come arsenic on here is my program would combine successfully than it would go away So Def CPB is fine after I D E stacked you can use if you would use other eighties things will be almost similar I have opened up another ninety you named cord blocks things are similar hand go to File new and click on empty fine this time before writing court I would first to see if the file child Press control s the style love will come Save as type as selected CC plus plus fines and then I'll give a name court blocks hello doxie 1 seconds here I can take my program not to compile I can go to be in the menu at the top here and I can click on BB and come by Liza synonyms may use these two tones for each other if you build a successful nor message will come you can run the program you can also used option base and run it we do both in one take side took one bed and run now cord block all service causes the console for you to see the output and once you learn press any key Denali the console exit as you can see it's printing some extra messages apart from what you have continued called this definitely is better because fear not having to put the hack so I have shown you how they can work with two of 2i the East things will be almost similar if you would use any other baby some websites including arson give you this feature that you can't write compile and view the output of your program in their browser itself so you do not have to install anything on your local machine links to all of these resources to i'm talking about. can be found in the description of this video from Nixle SNB will start getting deeper into C language concepts this is it for this lesson thanks for watching
