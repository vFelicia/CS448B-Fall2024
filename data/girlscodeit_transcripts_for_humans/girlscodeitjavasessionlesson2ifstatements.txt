00:01 - okay guys hello
00:03 - welcome to java second class
00:06 - um well the second class in the session
00:08 - um
00:10 - uh we're really glad to have you here
00:12 - and hopefully more people will join
00:13 - later but we're just gonna get started
00:15 - now
00:16 - um i'm alex one of your java teachers as
00:19 - you remember
00:19 - from yesterday i'm andre doing it
00:23 - i want to introduce myself hi
00:27 - i'm andrea and i'm
00:30 - also one of your drama instructors
00:36 - um and i'm candace and i'm your other
00:38 - java instructor
00:42 - hey okay so we're gonna get started with
00:44 - our lesson
00:45 - um just let me share a screen
00:51 - okay so today we'll be talking about
00:54 - scanner
00:57 - yeah and so okay
01:00 - we're gonna be learning about scanner
01:02 - today and scanner
01:03 - is like this useful tool that allows you
01:07 - to
01:07 - get user input so what that means
01:10 - is like for example if we
01:14 - have like a website like gmail or
01:17 - facebook or something
01:19 - and it asks you for like your username
01:23 - then the user can enter their username
01:26 - and stuff
01:27 - so or like in their password so it's
01:30 - kind of like
01:31 - interacting with your computer
01:36 - like yeah with computer and the user
01:40 - so um
01:52 - candace
01:59 - andrea could you do i'm sending them
02:01 - sending the link really quick
02:06 - okay
02:15 - andrea
02:19 - yeah wait what wait are you doing the
02:22 - second slide
02:24 - oh um i thought i was gonna send like
02:27 - the link again i'm sending the link
02:30 - could you do it
02:32 - oh can i do the second slide yeah okay
02:34 - sure
02:37 - okay so to use scanner first
02:41 - you want to import it like
02:44 - right here it says
02:47 - to import scanner
02:50 - so what that does is it just gives you
02:53 - like the ability
02:54 - to use the scanner and
02:58 - um yeah
03:01 - uh we're going to go over an example in
03:03 - the next slide
03:04 - but basically you import it like right
03:07 - above the
03:08 - class stain which um alex will show
03:11 - later
03:12 - so first you need to import it and then
03:16 - we also need to create a scanner tool
03:20 - so to do that we just use
03:23 - this keyword scanner and then this thing
03:27 - is like the name of your scanner so you
03:30 - can name it like
03:31 - input keyboard user
03:34 - whatever you want and then you use this
03:37 - equal sign
03:38 - and then this new which just means
03:41 - you're creating
03:42 - like a new scanner and new scanner and
03:46 - then
03:46 - parentheses system dot in
03:49 - and parentheses and as always
03:53 - your semicolon so
03:56 - yeah next um this
04:00 - we have a system.out.printline
04:04 - so this part enter a number is just
04:07 - something that
04:08 - like prompts or like asks the user
04:12 - to enter something like a number
04:17 - and then to use that to like get user
04:20 - input
04:21 - sorry we have to do something called
04:24 - input which
04:24 - is the uh what we named
04:28 - our scanner and then something called
04:30 - dot next
04:31 - int and dot next and just gives you
04:35 - like an integer or um stores an integer
04:39 - value
04:40 - so um and then we have to store this
04:45 - in a end variable
04:49 - because um just so that we can use
04:53 - what the user inputted and yeah
04:59 - okay so this can be a lot of steps all
05:02 - in a row that seem kind of random
05:04 - but once you do it a few times you'll
05:06 - get used to
05:08 - um using all of them so now we're going
05:11 - to do an example of how to use a scanner
05:14 - so you all want to open your bluej or
05:17 - whatever code compiler you're using
05:21 - and then you're going to want to create
05:22 - a new class for today
05:25 - so the new class button in the top left
05:28 - and then just
05:29 - name it whatever i'm just talking
05:35 - and then double click on the new brown
05:37 - box and you should get a screen with all
05:40 - of this
05:41 - code that looks complicated and
05:44 - confusing
05:45 - and we're just gonna delete all of them
05:49 - and start new class um
05:53 - you can follow along with me in typing
05:56 - all this
05:57 - out or i can copy paste it into the chat
06:00 - once i'm done with all of the
06:02 - like foundation code
06:07 - problematic void main string
06:18 - arcs
06:29 - okay so i put it in the chat
06:32 - what did i do
06:44 - um okay
06:47 - so if you guys have that
06:50 - typed out we're going to start
06:54 - like andrea said before um the first
06:57 - thing we need to do
06:59 - is import the ability for the class to
07:01 - use the scanner tool
07:04 - um it's going to be all the way up here
07:06 - above your
07:07 - class name um you're going to type
07:10 - import java youtube
07:15 - dot scanner
07:18 - um and again you can name a class
07:20 - anything you want
07:21 - up here
07:25 - so we have to type that step up there
07:32 - and then the second thing we need to is
07:34 - to make your scanner tool
07:36 - like andrea said before um and also like
07:39 - you can see
07:40 - a powerpoint over on the right here
07:43 - we're going to
07:44 - type scanner you can name this anything
07:48 - i'll just go with input equal
07:52 - new inner system
07:56 - in and that is how you make your
07:59 - center tool um
08:04 - okay and so now you're free to start
08:08 - using your scanner
08:10 - i'm just going to ask the user for a
08:12 - random number
08:13 - uh so that they know that they can put
08:16 - something in
08:17 - uh so to do that we're going to print a
08:20 - statement like we taught yesterday
08:22 - um and just go enter
08:26 - an integer really let's make
08:30 - enter a whole number
08:38 - so like we yesterday this um
08:42 - this is now going to be printed out
08:45 - to the user and see that
08:49 - and then when they see that they're
08:50 - going to go oh
08:52 - okay so i'm going to type a number into
08:54 - the computer and press
08:55 - enter so a third to
08:59 - um that number that they typed in uh
09:02 - we're going to do
09:03 - as it says in this slide and create an
09:06 - integer value
09:07 - and enter your variable to hold that
09:09 - number
09:10 - so let's say this yesterday we're making
09:14 - an
09:14 - integer variable so we go in
09:18 - and then any random name so
09:22 - i'm just going to call it
09:25 - user answer and then
09:28 - it equals and then to use a scanner
09:32 - here we're going to type input
09:36 - because it's the same thing this word
09:40 - and this word dot
09:44 - and then next it to get the integer
09:47 - variable that the user typed in
09:51 - so
09:56 - that should be the basics of how to use
09:58 - a scanner
09:59 - and that this program should
10:03 - ask the user for a whole number and then
10:06 - store that number
10:07 - in an int variable i'm just going to
10:11 - compile
10:11 - and run it just to check that it works
10:14 - so the compile button as you remember is
10:16 - up here
10:18 - and then down here you right click on
10:21 - the brown box
10:23 - then click the second option okay
10:28 - and so it's going to ask to enter a
10:30 - whole number
10:32 - um chantal why don't you give us a
10:33 - random whole number
10:36 - honey sure see like
10:40 - since it like opens the ability to type
10:44 - into this box
10:46 - i realize that i make it
10:50 - like the answer actually
10:53 - we're gonna do that now then i'm just
10:56 - gonna print out their answer back to
10:58 - them
11:01 - you typed
11:04 - and then just going to print out the
11:07 - variable
11:08 - that we stored that value in
11:11 - compile it again oh shoot
11:19 - run the code it asks for a whole number
11:23 - we put in a whole number and it grabbed
11:26 - our variable and
11:28 - used it so yeah
11:32 - um yeah so like this thing might be kind
11:36 - of like
11:37 - awesome to you guys
11:40 - but i think after more practice and
11:43 - just more exercises you can like
11:47 - quickly get the hang of it and so yeah
11:50 - like right now it might be really
11:52 - like a lot of stuff like thrown at you
11:55 - but like with more practice
11:57 - i'm sure you guys can like get used to
12:00 - it
12:02 - but um if any of you guys have any
12:05 - questions
12:06 - then feel free to tell us
12:10 - or you can type in a chat or like yeah
12:16 - all right so um as you can see on the
12:20 - powerpoint it says reading other data
12:22 - types so right now in the example that
12:24 - alex just did
12:26 - we did an int variable um
12:29 - by using input.nextint but
12:32 - we can also use other data types and if
12:35 - you remember from
12:36 - yesterday when we talked about the
12:37 - different variables we also had
12:40 - double which is a number just with a
12:42 - decimal
12:43 - and we had a string which is like any
12:45 - text or anything like that
12:47 - so we can also read those data types
12:51 - using the different uh different things
12:55 - that we see
12:55 - on the powerpoint so it's pretty much
12:58 - gonna work
12:59 - it works the same way as the instance um
13:01 - where you do
13:02 - dot next except for double if you want
13:05 - to do a double then you do dot next
13:07 - double
13:08 - if you want to do a string you could do
13:10 - dot next
13:11 - line or yeah so dot next line
13:14 - if you want to do a boolean which i know
13:16 - we didn't talk a lot about but that's
13:18 - where you just have a true or false
13:20 - then you could do dot next boolean um
13:22 - and dot next
13:24 - is just going to so the last one which
13:26 - is just dot next
13:28 - and that's going to pick up anything but
13:31 - it'll only pick up the first thing that
13:33 - shows up so for example if you typed in
13:34 - like
13:36 - orange juice um it would only pick up
13:38 - the orange because you have that space
13:39 - separating it
13:40 - so in the case of two word inputs like
13:43 - orange juice then you would want to do
13:45 - um dot next line in order to pick up
13:47 - everything
13:49 - but yeah so it works the same way you
13:50 - would do the name of your scanner in
13:52 - this case the name is input and then dot
13:54 - next
13:55 - and then whatever data type you want to
13:57 - pick up
14:02 - we're just going to try um some examples
14:05 - for
14:06 - all of these methods um in your coder
14:09 - in your compiler um so the first one
14:12 - we're going to do
14:13 - is double so remember double as a
14:15 - decimal note
14:16 - though i'm just going to ask to enter
14:19 - a decimal number and basically the only
14:22 - thing that's
14:23 - different is this statement instead of
14:27 - next int um we're going to go
14:31 - next double so the computer knows
14:35 - and then we need to change our variable
14:38 - type
14:39 - yep you're right um
14:44 - because yeah it's a different type of
14:47 - variable
14:48 - um i guess i'll run it
14:56 - and
14:58 - here's the window oh well this is still
15:02 - from last time but
15:03 - enter a decimal number uh does someone
15:05 - want to just give us a random decimal
15:16 - okay whatever um i'm going to
15:20 - take three that's a decimal
15:23 - and it works here because
15:26 - uh it's a double and we changed it to
15:30 - reflect that um
15:34 - now one of the more common ones is you
15:37 - want
15:37 - to get a string a sentence or a word
15:41 - from your user so we're going to use
15:43 - next line
15:44 - for string uh notice that it's not
15:47 - dotnet
15:48 - it's done um
15:51 - just something you have a chat for and
15:56 - so we change that to dot next line and
16:00 - maybe enter a sentence
16:06 - and of course we have to change this to
16:09 - a string variable
16:13 - um we're going to run that really quick
16:16 - just
16:17 - so you can see that it works
16:20 - um
16:25 - does anyone have a random sentence we
16:27 - want to put in
16:31 - coding is cool okay
16:37 - is cool
16:40 - we're gonna put that in and if
16:44 - it back out to us um
16:47 - so you see here it took the sentence
16:50 - coding is cool a string
16:52 - stored it in a string variable and then
16:54 - printed it back out to us
16:56 - alex just to show them why don't you try
16:58 - doing just dot next
17:00 - and don't do the dot next point sure
17:08 - um so dot next is slightly different
17:13 - from the other ones
17:18 - uh it should only take in the first
17:21 - like word um in the string so
17:24 - we're gonna go with coding is cool again
17:28 - and so since we use dot next it only
17:32 - grabbed the first word and stored that
17:35 - and printed back up
17:40 - do you guys have any questions about
17:41 - this before so far
17:43 - want us to go slower or want to repeat
17:46 - anything like that
17:54 - all right
18:02 - okay so a little
18:07 - okay a little okay so just to
18:11 - recap scanner is um
18:14 - this tool that allows you to get
18:17 - like user input so the user can enter
18:20 - something
18:21 - and the computer can store it in a
18:24 - variable
18:26 - to like whatever they want to do with it
18:31 - so to use scanner we have to import it
18:35 - and um import java.util.scanner
18:40 - semicolon and we also have to
18:44 - create a new scanner and then
18:48 - afterwards we import it and create a new
18:52 - scanner
18:53 - then we can use it and
18:56 - we use it by just calling the
18:59 - scanner like what we named our scanner
19:03 - so in this example i need
19:06 - my scanner input so to just
19:09 - use scanner you just call it by
19:13 - the scanner name and then dot next
19:17 - whatever um whatever like
19:21 - type it is so like if it's a strain
19:25 - or if it's an integer or a double
19:29 - which is like a decimal so
19:33 - yeah you would do dot next line or dot
19:36 - next it
19:41 - um before we get into this madness game
19:44 - let's let's try something um we can kind
19:47 - of combine what we learned yesterday
19:49 - with the like in variables or decimals
19:52 - uh doubles so alex why don't we try
19:55 - something where like
19:56 - we um have the user
20:00 - enter in like dimensions
20:03 - of like a box or a cube or a triangle
20:06 - and then it could print out
20:08 - you know multiply uh whatever you're
20:10 - trying to do and then you could find
20:12 - like the volume or the area or something
20:14 - like that so we could kind of combine
20:15 - scanner with stuff that we did yesterday
20:20 - sure okay so you guys know that
20:23 - coding is really useful and it can be
20:25 - used uh
20:26 - to help us do a lot of
20:29 - rudimentary functions um
20:34 - so now we're going to
20:39 - find the volume of a rectangular prism
20:42 - given the length width and height
20:44 - um you've probably learned how to do do
20:46 - this in school
20:48 - but basically to find the volume of like
20:51 - a box
20:51 - you just need its dimensions so we're
20:54 - going to write a program
20:56 - that asks the user for the length width
20:59 - and height of a box
21:00 - and then it should spit out the volume
21:02 - of that
21:04 - so okay so first we're going to need to
21:07 - ask the user for those
21:12 - we're going to do that separately um
21:17 - what is the length of the box
21:23 - um as always we end with a semicolon and
21:25 - then we're going to
21:27 - make a double
21:31 - variable that is going to store the
21:33 - length
21:35 - um
21:38 - so that's going to be input.next
21:43 - double
21:46 - you can also use int but i'm just going
21:49 - to go with double because
21:51 - they might want to um
21:54 - and we're going to need to do the exact
21:56 - same thing for the width and the height
22:10 - so
22:13 - and if you wanted to try this with any
22:15 - other shape or
22:17 - anything like that um it's the exact
22:20 - same concept
22:22 - um like if you want to do triangle you
22:23 - just ask for the base and then the
22:25 - height and just
22:26 - you know do a formula for that um
22:29 - so if you want to try something
22:30 - different please feel free to do that as
22:33 - well
22:33 - it's fun to experiment
22:38 - yep okay so
22:41 - once you have this all typed out
22:43 - actually i'm going to give you a minute
22:44 - to do that
22:48 - like candace said like feel free to do
22:50 - any shape you want
22:52 - or just i'm just gonna go with a box but
22:55 - you can do anything
23:14 - [Music]
23:17 - okay so there are a few ways you can do
23:21 - this but i
23:22 - always feel like the easiest way is
23:25 - just to make a different variable to
23:28 - store the volume
23:29 - and then we can print that out to the
23:31 - user so that they can see it
23:34 - um so we're going to make a variable
23:41 - a double variable called volume that's
23:44 - going to
23:46 - where we're going to calculate and store
23:47 - the actual volume
23:50 - of the box and
23:53 - to get the volume we'd multiply the
23:56 - length the width and the height together
24:00 - again like this is something you
24:01 - probably learn in math class but
24:03 - if you haven't yet it's okay it's a
24:05 - really simple formula
24:08 - so as we said yesterday to multiply it
24:12 - in java
24:12 - we're just going to use an asterisk
24:16 - a star
24:23 - and that should give us our volume
24:26 - um and then finally we're going to want
24:29 - to print
24:30 - this volume out to the user so this
24:34 - is going to use another print statement
24:36 - like we used above
24:38 - and like we talked about yesterday um
24:42 - system dot out dot print line
24:48 - and we're going to tell the user
24:51 - volume
24:55 - box is
24:58 - and then we're combining um
25:01 - different things to print out in this
25:03 - single statement
25:05 - and we're just going to print out
25:08 - the variable volume
25:11 - um i remind you that it's really
25:14 - important we don't put
25:15 - quotations around this variable
25:19 - um because if we did this it would just
25:22 - print out
25:22 - the volume of this box is volume but we
25:26 - don't want to print out the word volume
25:27 - we want to print out the variable volume
25:30 - because that's going to give us the
25:31 - actual number
25:33 - so that's what i'm going to type
25:36 - out
25:41 - i'll give you another minute to like up
25:44 - if you haven't already
25:46 - and like how alex has said before about
25:48 - how there's multiple ways to
25:50 - do this um what she might is that
25:54 - like right here we created a variable
25:56 - called volume which multiplies length
25:58 - width and height um you could skip that
26:02 - all together and directly print out
26:04 - so in your system.print ln line
26:08 - um instead of writing plus volume you
26:11 - could do just directly
26:12 - length times width times height um
26:16 - it would print out the same thing it's
26:17 - just a matter of preference
26:20 - um so yeah you could do it any way you
26:24 - want
26:24 - you like uh we're just doing it where
26:26 - you create the
26:28 - variable first and then you print out
26:30 - the variable
26:32 - yeah like candice was saying instead of
26:35 - doing what
26:36 - i did you can
26:40 - do it like this and it should give you
26:42 - the same output
26:45 - but i personally just like to create a
26:47 - variable because
26:50 - oops this is a good idea when you
26:54 - uh code like longer codes so
26:57 - maybe you want to use the volume again
26:59 - later and then you don't have to type it
27:01 - out again
27:02 - but yep
27:15 - okay so i'm going to run it um
27:19 - if you're falling behind or you think
27:21 - we're moving too fast
27:22 - please just let us know and we'll like
27:25 - wait
27:25 - and pause for you uh like never feel
27:29 - afraid to speak up or anything so we're
27:32 - going to compile this code
27:36 - go to the round box right click second
27:39 - option okay
27:42 - so does someone want to give me a random
27:46 - length a double var example
27:49 - double value that is
27:54 - caitlyn do you want to give us a random
27:56 - double
27:58 - 10 okay sounds
28:01 - good um nikki how about a width
28:10 - five okay
28:16 - and then why don't we do it um like a
28:19 - decimal one for the next one
28:21 - sure
28:25 - ellie do you want to give us a decimal
28:29 - uh 7.5 okay
28:32 - sounds great so now we have
28:35 - three double values
28:39 - and then it gave us the volume of the
28:40 - box is
28:42 - 375. i don't know if that's actually
28:45 - right
28:46 - um i think it is yeah
28:53 - right doesn't have questions or did
28:54 - anyone have errors in their code that
28:56 - you want us
28:57 - to help you work out or anything like
28:59 - that
29:10 - nope no everyone's good to go
29:16 - don't ever be afraid to ask for help
29:18 - that's what we're here for
29:39 - all right should we move on to the last
29:42 - activity thing yep
29:46 - sounds good so
29:50 - i'm just going to delete all of this
29:52 - code but you can comment it out
29:54 - or save it in another class
29:58 - um so we're going to move on to our
30:02 - final activity which
30:03 - is basically mad libs um
30:07 - this is like you might have played mad
30:11 - libs before with your friends
30:13 - it's like a game where we have a
30:16 - pre-written story
30:17 - with like certain words that are just
30:21 - blank and then the players
30:24 - come up with the random words to put
30:27 - into that story when they
30:29 - don't exactly know what the story is so
30:32 - anyway it should come out to be funny
30:34 - and
30:36 - um it's a great way to practice using
30:38 - scanner
30:39 - um okay
30:42 - so we're going to make up a story you
30:46 - guys can do it however you want but
30:48 - i'm just going to um give
30:52 - the example up here um
30:56 - so the first thing we're going to need
30:58 - in our story
30:59 - is the name of our character
31:02 - so i'm going to type code that
31:06 - asks the user to give a name
31:10 - i'm so like um
31:20 - and then like before we're going to
31:24 - want to make a string variable not like
31:27 - before we like
31:28 - we're going to want to make a variable
31:30 - to store the user's answer
31:32 - in and since this is a name a word
31:35 - we're going to use a string variable to
31:37 - store that
31:45 - and then like you remember
31:49 - input dot next line for strings
31:55 - um actually that is really awkward
31:59 - wording so
32:00 - what is the character's name
32:04 - um
32:09 - we're going to do
32:13 - an adjective now um
32:20 - um type in an adjective
32:24 - a description word
32:29 - and then
32:35 - i think we're able to store that
32:40 - um
32:44 - we're going to do just for the sake of
32:47 - an integer variable we're going to do an
32:49 - age so
32:59 - type a whole number
33:06 - oh typo
33:14 - this is not a string um this is an
33:19 - h and we're going to
33:25 - get in it um
33:29 - one more for now we're going to do type
33:32 - of pet
33:36 - um
33:51 - and then store that nash
34:05 - okay so
34:08 - i'll just give you a couple of minutes
34:10 - to like
34:12 - finish your own maybe you want to do
34:15 - different
34:16 - types of variables and i did or like
34:19 - different
34:21 - questions um give you a couple minutes
34:24 - for that
34:25 - and then we'll move on
34:46 - so
35:00 - uh
35:14 - yes
35:28 - okay
35:42 - um
35:50 - okay so now that we have our variables
35:54 - we're going to start writing our story
35:59 - um this is going to
36:04 - um print the story out to the user so
36:06 - we're just going to use a print
36:07 - statement
36:10 - um
36:29 - okay we're going to start our story by
36:32 - going
36:33 - the character's name
36:37 - went for a walk um
36:41 - and to get the character's name we're
36:44 - just going to use the name variable that
36:46 - we made earlier
36:48 - um so name plus because name
36:52 - remember we're not going to put that in
36:54 - the quotations because
36:56 - we're going to call the actual variable
36:58 - and not just type
36:59 - the word name um
37:03 - actually we're going to say how old the
37:07 - character
37:08 - is um
37:11 - we could say like when you're walking
37:13 - this many
37:14 - objects something like that you're not
37:16 - gonna use the number for me
37:20 - okay um
37:24 - oops okay name went for a walk
37:28 - oh also notice i'm putting all these
37:31 - spaces
37:32 - like at the beginning and end of the
37:34 - quotations because
37:36 - if we didn't it would just the computer
37:39 - is not going to recognize that we need a
37:41 - space between words
37:43 - and it's just going to go alicia went
37:46 - instead of alicia space woman
37:50 - so that's something that people get
37:53 - tripped up on all the time but it's a
37:54 - really easy fix
37:57 - um
38:01 - he could be a he
38:04 - saw
38:08 - and then it's time to use
38:11 - our okay i guess it's not an age anymore
38:16 - number
38:23 - and then we can do enter
38:27 - if we think it like looks better or just
38:30 - for organization
38:32 - um so it the a single line of code
38:34 - doesn't just
38:35 - run all the coffee page but like there
38:38 - are very specific
38:39 - places where you can do that um
38:43 - on number
38:51 - i don't even know um
38:54 - butterflies
38:58 - uh she went okay
39:01 - i remember why i wanted to do pets
39:05 - so she went on a walk
39:10 - with her pet
39:18 - um
39:21 - is it we asked for that earlier um
39:25 - and we stored it in the variable pet
39:30 - so right now i'm going to read i'm just
39:32 - going to put in random things right now
39:33 - alicia went for a walk with her pet
39:36 - jaguar
39:37 - she saw
39:40 - 12 twelve butterflies and we have an
39:43 - adjective
39:44 - so we're just gonna use that to describe
39:46 - butterflies
39:48 - um
39:53 - oh but notice we need a space between
39:56 - the number and the adjective
39:57 - because well the computer is not going
40:00 - to recognize that there are two
40:01 - different words
40:03 - so
40:06 - space and there we go
40:12 - um
40:15 - i think that should be good so i'm going
40:17 - to run this
40:18 - code does that have any more time to
40:21 - write
40:22 - your own um sentence or copy down
40:24 - whatever
40:25 - it says can you scroll back like
40:28 - sideways
40:29 - oh alex do you wanna maybe just extend
40:30 - your screen there you go yeah
40:32 - just full screen
40:40 - i'll give y'all a few minutes to
40:43 - finish typing or like to make up your
40:45 - own story
41:04 - so
41:46 - okay
42:45 - all right does anyone need more time or
42:47 - are we good to try to run it
42:58 - okay so i'm just going to compile it up
43:02 - here
43:04 - and then run it
43:10 - so yeah it asks us for a random name
43:14 - um does someone want to give us
43:18 - a random name
43:35 - um ellie do you want to give us just a
43:38 - name
43:42 - um alex
43:46 - great okay
43:50 - um an adjective so like
43:54 - this can be pretty much anything
43:57 - don't think about like what it's what
44:00 - would make sense just like
44:02 - any adjective to make it funny um nikki
44:12 - silly
44:13 - [Music]
44:20 - um a whole number
44:28 - caitlyn do you want to give a random
44:30 - whole number
44:32 - 11 sure
44:36 - sounds great oh
44:39 - well all right let's
44:43 - fix that error okay so basically if you
44:46 - guys see how
44:48 - um after says type in an animal right we
44:50 - should have been able to type in like
44:52 - dog cat giraffe camel whatever we wanted
44:56 - um but i skipped over it and directly
44:58 - went to the next thing which was to
45:00 - print out
45:00 - our whole um
45:04 - it's called whole sentence i guess
45:07 - um so the way the reason that happens
45:10 - basically i'll see if i can try to
45:11 - explain this is
45:13 - um if you see uh back to the code
45:16 - um this happened after
45:19 - our int number software says type in a
45:22 - whole number
45:23 - so basically what happens is if you
45:26 - think about kind of you have like a
45:27 - curse on your computer
45:29 - and it picks up whatever is next to it
45:31 - so after the int
45:32 - it it stays at the end of that line um
45:36 - and we need it to go to the next line in
45:38 - order to pick up what we
45:39 - are going to write there so because the
45:42 - int it stays there and it doesn't
45:43 - move to the next line that's why it
45:45 - skips over
45:47 - the type in an animal so the way you
45:49 - could fix that is to kind of
45:52 - think about like consuming that
45:55 - extra space and then so then you can
45:58 - move
45:58 - over to the next line so the way you do
46:00 - that is after
46:02 - um where it says number equals
46:05 - input.nextint
46:06 - after that and before the the next one
46:09 - that you want to
46:10 - get before the string pad equals input
46:12 - on next line and what you're just going
46:14 - to do
46:15 - is input dot next
46:20 - and i think um i think that should fix
46:23 - it
46:23 - if not so yes what this is going to do
46:27 - it's going to get rid of that
46:28 - it's going to move the cursor from the
46:30 - end where there's nothing after
46:31 - to the next line where you can then type
46:34 - something in and then it'll gather that
46:35 - and put it into
46:37 - your next variable so hopefully this
46:40 - works
46:42 - okay we'll see and so much of coding is
46:47 - about troubleshooting so
46:49 - this should be common um
46:54 - okay we're not going to go through
46:55 - asking again
46:57 - just do what we had before um
47:01 - hello yes
47:05 - okay that didn't okay try pressing enter
47:09 - uh
47:10 - [Music]
47:12 - okay that did not work
47:16 - so let's stop next line
47:21 - next oh yeah you might have to do that
47:23 - next one
47:25 - i feel so as you guys could see errors
47:27 - are very very common in java
47:30 - um
47:30 - [Music]
47:33 - as you do more and more errors will
47:35 - hopefully decrease
47:37 - but um
47:41 - do you put it here
47:49 - um do you want me to try dot next one
47:51 - dude dot next line where we had it
47:53 - before
47:54 - try that okay
48:18 - hmm
48:24 - yay uh
48:28 - i'm just gonna go for
48:33 - yay okay so that worked
48:36 - um so i mean this is a pretty that's a
48:39 - pretty common error when working with
48:41 - scanner
48:42 - um so the reason why next line
48:47 - worked and just dot next didn't was
48:49 - because
48:50 - dot next line that's why it moves to the
48:52 - next line it was my bad
48:54 - i'm sorry about that but next it
48:56 - wouldn't move it so you need that next
48:58 - line in order to move from the end back
49:00 - to the next line where you can then
49:02 - input your next variable
49:10 - so yeah there's our little uh fun little
49:13 - mad loves game
49:15 - um again you can do anything you want
49:18 - make it longer shorter
49:20 - different kinds of variables different
49:22 - kind of story
49:23 - that's just a little simple thing to um
49:26 - i guess incorporate all the things that
49:28 - we learned from
49:30 - today and yesterday as well so
49:38 - so we have five minutes um
49:41 - you can use time to like
49:44 - maybe make even more labels up here
49:48 - that um we ask for
49:51 - so that we can make a more complicated
49:53 - story
49:54 - or if you want you are free to go
49:58 - uh does anyone have any final questions
50:00 - about anything
50:06 - all right cool so i think our next
50:11 - um next lesson is next
50:14 - saturday i think um
50:18 - wednesday isn't it oh yeah i think it's
50:20 - next saturday
50:23 - yeah it's saturday yeah
50:26 - um i have a question actually um about
50:29 - the
50:29 - tutoring that i saw in the email is that
50:33 - you know something we can use to
50:35 - communicate
50:37 - with you about questions um
50:41 - um
50:46 - did i send you the email yesterday or
50:48 - was it a different email
50:49 - um i've just seen at least maybe in a
50:52 - few emails that there's some kind of
50:54 - tutoring component on you know your
50:57 - website
50:58 - and i'm wondering if it's like you can
51:01 - just
51:02 - yeah like go there not during class
51:06 - times with yeah so the tutoring thing
51:09 - um i believe it's if you sign up then
51:12 - you could sign up for like a 30 minute
51:14 - um like one on one with one of the
51:17 - girls coded volunteers um as for just
51:20 - quick questions
51:24 - i think i don't think there's currently
51:26 - a function on the
51:28 - on the site where you can just type in a
51:30 - quick question
51:31 - um i'm not sure really alex
51:35 - you know andrea if i think they said
51:37 - they're trying to work on it but i don't
51:39 - think
51:39 - that we have a function like that yet um
51:42 - but the tutoring yeah so if you sign up
51:44 - for that um you could sign up for a
51:46 - 30-minute session
51:47 - and then um you and whoever
51:51 - like whichever volunteer you're dealing
51:53 - with would work out a time together
51:55 - um through like zoom or google meets or
51:57 - something like that and then
51:59 - i'll work on something there does that
52:01 - kind of make sense to your question
52:04 - um yeah i think so um
52:08 - yeah thank you yeah no problem yes as
52:11 - for just quick questions
52:12 - i don't think we have anything on the
52:14 - site yet
52:16 - i think they might be working on it i'm
52:17 - not a hundred percent sure
52:19 - um hopefully we can get something like
52:22 - that soon that'll be pretty cool
52:24 - yeah yeah right now
52:28 - sorry but you might just want to try
52:29 - googling it or saving it
52:31 - the next class when you can ask us okay
52:34 - that's
52:34 - true also thank you yeah thank you all
52:38 - so much for
52:39 - coming i hope you enjoyed it and
52:42 - learn something new
52:47 - yeah um from now on you can always
52:50 - practice
52:50 - or go back and try to code your own
52:54 - little something
52:55 - and we just hope you have fun
53:00 - you

Cleaned transcript:

okay guys hello welcome to java second class um well the second class in the session um uh we're really glad to have you here and hopefully more people will join later but we're just gonna get started now um i'm alex one of your java teachers as you remember from yesterday i'm andre doing it i want to introduce myself hi i'm andrea and i'm also one of your drama instructors um and i'm candace and i'm your other java instructor hey okay so we're gonna get started with our lesson um just let me share a screen okay so today we'll be talking about scanner yeah and so okay we're gonna be learning about scanner today and scanner is like this useful tool that allows you to get user input so what that means is like for example if we have like a website like gmail or facebook or something and it asks you for like your username then the user can enter their username and stuff so or like in their password so it's kind of like interacting with your computer like yeah with computer and the user so um candace andrea could you do i'm sending them sending the link really quick okay andrea yeah wait what wait are you doing the second slide oh um i thought i was gonna send like the link again i'm sending the link could you do it oh can i do the second slide yeah okay sure okay so to use scanner first you want to import it like right here it says to import scanner so what that does is it just gives you like the ability to use the scanner and um yeah uh we're going to go over an example in the next slide but basically you import it like right above the class stain which um alex will show later so first you need to import it and then we also need to create a scanner tool so to do that we just use this keyword scanner and then this thing is like the name of your scanner so you can name it like input keyboard user whatever you want and then you use this equal sign and then this new which just means you're creating like a new scanner and new scanner and then parentheses system dot in and parentheses and as always your semicolon so yeah next um this we have a system.out.printline so this part enter a number is just something that like prompts or like asks the user to enter something like a number and then to use that to like get user input sorry we have to do something called input which is the uh what we named our scanner and then something called dot next int and dot next and just gives you like an integer or um stores an integer value so um and then we have to store this in a end variable because um just so that we can use what the user inputted and yeah okay so this can be a lot of steps all in a row that seem kind of random but once you do it a few times you'll get used to um using all of them so now we're going to do an example of how to use a scanner so you all want to open your bluej or whatever code compiler you're using and then you're going to want to create a new class for today so the new class button in the top left and then just name it whatever i'm just talking and then double click on the new brown box and you should get a screen with all of this code that looks complicated and confusing and we're just gonna delete all of them and start new class um you can follow along with me in typing all this out or i can copy paste it into the chat once i'm done with all of the like foundation code problematic void main string arcs okay so i put it in the chat what did i do um okay so if you guys have that typed out we're going to start like andrea said before um the first thing we need to do is import the ability for the class to use the scanner tool um it's going to be all the way up here above your class name um you're going to type import java youtube dot scanner um and again you can name a class anything you want up here so we have to type that step up there and then the second thing we need to is to make your scanner tool like andrea said before um and also like you can see a powerpoint over on the right here we're going to type scanner you can name this anything i'll just go with input equal new inner system in and that is how you make your center tool um okay and so now you're free to start using your scanner i'm just going to ask the user for a random number uh so that they know that they can put something in uh so to do that we're going to print a statement like we taught yesterday um and just go enter an integer really let's make enter a whole number so like we yesterday this um this is now going to be printed out to the user and see that and then when they see that they're going to go oh okay so i'm going to type a number into the computer and press enter so a third to um that number that they typed in uh we're going to do as it says in this slide and create an integer value and enter your variable to hold that number so let's say this yesterday we're making an integer variable so we go in and then any random name so i'm just going to call it user answer and then it equals and then to use a scanner here we're going to type input because it's the same thing this word and this word dot and then next it to get the integer variable that the user typed in so that should be the basics of how to use a scanner and that this program should ask the user for a whole number and then store that number in an int variable i'm just going to compile and run it just to check that it works so the compile button as you remember is up here and then down here you right click on the brown box then click the second option okay and so it's going to ask to enter a whole number um chantal why don't you give us a random whole number honey sure see like since it like opens the ability to type into this box i realize that i make it like the answer actually we're gonna do that now then i'm just gonna print out their answer back to them you typed and then just going to print out the variable that we stored that value in compile it again oh shoot run the code it asks for a whole number we put in a whole number and it grabbed our variable and used it so yeah um yeah so like this thing might be kind of like awesome to you guys but i think after more practice and just more exercises you can like quickly get the hang of it and so yeah like right now it might be really like a lot of stuff like thrown at you but like with more practice i'm sure you guys can like get used to it but um if any of you guys have any questions then feel free to tell us or you can type in a chat or like yeah all right so um as you can see on the powerpoint it says reading other data types so right now in the example that alex just did we did an int variable um by using input.nextint but we can also use other data types and if you remember from yesterday when we talked about the different variables we also had double which is a number just with a decimal and we had a string which is like any text or anything like that so we can also read those data types using the different uh different things that we see on the powerpoint so it's pretty much gonna work it works the same way as the instance um where you do dot next except for double if you want to do a double then you do dot next double if you want to do a string you could do dot next line or yeah so dot next line if you want to do a boolean which i know we didn't talk a lot about but that's where you just have a true or false then you could do dot next boolean um and dot next is just going to so the last one which is just dot next and that's going to pick up anything but it'll only pick up the first thing that shows up so for example if you typed in like orange juice um it would only pick up the orange because you have that space separating it so in the case of two word inputs like orange juice then you would want to do um dot next line in order to pick up everything but yeah so it works the same way you would do the name of your scanner in this case the name is input and then dot next and then whatever data type you want to pick up we're just going to try um some examples for all of these methods um in your coder in your compiler um so the first one we're going to do is double so remember double as a decimal note though i'm just going to ask to enter a decimal number and basically the only thing that's different is this statement instead of next int um we're going to go next double so the computer knows and then we need to change our variable type yep you're right um because yeah it's a different type of variable um i guess i'll run it and here's the window oh well this is still from last time but enter a decimal number uh does someone want to just give us a random decimal okay whatever um i'm going to take three that's a decimal and it works here because uh it's a double and we changed it to reflect that um now one of the more common ones is you want to get a string a sentence or a word from your user so we're going to use next line for string uh notice that it's not dotnet it's done um just something you have a chat for and so we change that to dot next line and maybe enter a sentence and of course we have to change this to a string variable um we're going to run that really quick just so you can see that it works um does anyone have a random sentence we want to put in coding is cool okay is cool we're gonna put that in and if it back out to us um so you see here it took the sentence coding is cool a string stored it in a string variable and then printed it back out to us alex just to show them why don't you try doing just dot next and don't do the dot next point sure um so dot next is slightly different from the other ones uh it should only take in the first like word um in the string so we're gonna go with coding is cool again and so since we use dot next it only grabbed the first word and stored that and printed back up do you guys have any questions about this before so far want us to go slower or want to repeat anything like that all right okay so a little okay a little okay so just to recap scanner is um this tool that allows you to get like user input so the user can enter something and the computer can store it in a variable to like whatever they want to do with it so to use scanner we have to import it and um import java.util.scanner semicolon and we also have to create a new scanner and then afterwards we import it and create a new scanner then we can use it and we use it by just calling the scanner like what we named our scanner so in this example i need my scanner input so to just use scanner you just call it by the scanner name and then dot next whatever um whatever like type it is so like if it's a strain or if it's an integer or a double which is like a decimal so yeah you would do dot next line or dot next it um before we get into this madness game let's let's try something um we can kind of combine what we learned yesterday with the like in variables or decimals uh doubles so alex why don't we try something where like we um have the user enter in like dimensions of like a box or a cube or a triangle and then it could print out you know multiply uh whatever you're trying to do and then you could find like the volume or the area or something like that so we could kind of combine scanner with stuff that we did yesterday sure okay so you guys know that coding is really useful and it can be used uh to help us do a lot of rudimentary functions um so now we're going to find the volume of a rectangular prism given the length width and height um you've probably learned how to do do this in school but basically to find the volume of like a box you just need its dimensions so we're going to write a program that asks the user for the length width and height of a box and then it should spit out the volume of that so okay so first we're going to need to ask the user for those we're going to do that separately um what is the length of the box um as always we end with a semicolon and then we're going to make a double variable that is going to store the length um so that's going to be input.next double you can also use int but i'm just going to go with double because they might want to um and we're going to need to do the exact same thing for the width and the height so and if you wanted to try this with any other shape or anything like that um it's the exact same concept um like if you want to do triangle you just ask for the base and then the height and just you know do a formula for that um so if you want to try something different please feel free to do that as well it's fun to experiment yep okay so once you have this all typed out actually i'm going to give you a minute to do that like candace said like feel free to do any shape you want or just i'm just gonna go with a box but you can do anything okay so there are a few ways you can do this but i always feel like the easiest way is just to make a different variable to store the volume and then we can print that out to the user so that they can see it um so we're going to make a variable a double variable called volume that's going to where we're going to calculate and store the actual volume of the box and to get the volume we'd multiply the length the width and the height together again like this is something you probably learn in math class but if you haven't yet it's okay it's a really simple formula so as we said yesterday to multiply it in java we're just going to use an asterisk a star and that should give us our volume um and then finally we're going to want to print this volume out to the user so this is going to use another print statement like we used above and like we talked about yesterday um system dot out dot print line and we're going to tell the user volume box is and then we're combining um different things to print out in this single statement and we're just going to print out the variable volume um i remind you that it's really important we don't put quotations around this variable um because if we did this it would just print out the volume of this box is volume but we don't want to print out the word volume we want to print out the variable volume because that's going to give us the actual number so that's what i'm going to type out i'll give you another minute to like up if you haven't already and like how alex has said before about how there's multiple ways to do this um what she might is that like right here we created a variable called volume which multiplies length width and height um you could skip that all together and directly print out so in your system.print ln line um instead of writing plus volume you could do just directly length times width times height um it would print out the same thing it's just a matter of preference um so yeah you could do it any way you want you like uh we're just doing it where you create the variable first and then you print out the variable yeah like candice was saying instead of doing what i did you can do it like this and it should give you the same output but i personally just like to create a variable because oops this is a good idea when you uh code like longer codes so maybe you want to use the volume again later and then you don't have to type it out again but yep okay so i'm going to run it um if you're falling behind or you think we're moving too fast please just let us know and we'll like wait and pause for you uh like never feel afraid to speak up or anything so we're going to compile this code go to the round box right click second option okay so does someone want to give me a random length a double var example double value that is caitlyn do you want to give us a random double 10 okay sounds good um nikki how about a width five okay and then why don't we do it um like a decimal one for the next one sure ellie do you want to give us a decimal uh 7.5 okay sounds great so now we have three double values and then it gave us the volume of the box is 375. i don't know if that's actually right um i think it is yeah right doesn't have questions or did anyone have errors in their code that you want us to help you work out or anything like that nope no everyone's good to go don't ever be afraid to ask for help that's what we're here for all right should we move on to the last activity thing yep sounds good so i'm just going to delete all of this code but you can comment it out or save it in another class um so we're going to move on to our final activity which is basically mad libs um this is like you might have played mad libs before with your friends it's like a game where we have a prewritten story with like certain words that are just blank and then the players come up with the random words to put into that story when they don't exactly know what the story is so anyway it should come out to be funny and um it's a great way to practice using scanner um okay so we're going to make up a story you guys can do it however you want but i'm just going to um give the example up here um so the first thing we're going to need in our story is the name of our character so i'm going to type code that asks the user to give a name i'm so like um and then like before we're going to want to make a string variable not like before we like we're going to want to make a variable to store the user's answer in and since this is a name a word we're going to use a string variable to store that and then like you remember input dot next line for strings um actually that is really awkward wording so what is the character's name um we're going to do an adjective now um um type in an adjective a description word and then i think we're able to store that um we're going to do just for the sake of an integer variable we're going to do an age so type a whole number oh typo this is not a string um this is an h and we're going to get in it um one more for now we're going to do type of pet um and then store that nash okay so i'll just give you a couple of minutes to like finish your own maybe you want to do different types of variables and i did or like different questions um give you a couple minutes for that and then we'll move on so uh yes okay um okay so now that we have our variables we're going to start writing our story um this is going to um print the story out to the user so we're just going to use a print statement um okay we're going to start our story by going the character's name went for a walk um and to get the character's name we're just going to use the name variable that we made earlier um so name plus because name remember we're not going to put that in the quotations because we're going to call the actual variable and not just type the word name um actually we're going to say how old the character is um we could say like when you're walking this many objects something like that you're not gonna use the number for me okay um oops okay name went for a walk oh also notice i'm putting all these spaces like at the beginning and end of the quotations because if we didn't it would just the computer is not going to recognize that we need a space between words and it's just going to go alicia went instead of alicia space woman so that's something that people get tripped up on all the time but it's a really easy fix um he could be a he saw and then it's time to use our okay i guess it's not an age anymore number and then we can do enter if we think it like looks better or just for organization um so it the a single line of code doesn't just run all the coffee page but like there are very specific places where you can do that um on number i don't even know um butterflies uh she went okay i remember why i wanted to do pets so she went on a walk with her pet um is it we asked for that earlier um and we stored it in the variable pet so right now i'm going to read i'm just going to put in random things right now alicia went for a walk with her pet jaguar she saw 12 twelve butterflies and we have an adjective so we're just gonna use that to describe butterflies um oh but notice we need a space between the number and the adjective because well the computer is not going to recognize that there are two different words so space and there we go um i think that should be good so i'm going to run this code does that have any more time to write your own um sentence or copy down whatever it says can you scroll back like sideways oh alex do you wanna maybe just extend your screen there you go yeah just full screen i'll give y'all a few minutes to finish typing or like to make up your own story so okay all right does anyone need more time or are we good to try to run it okay so i'm just going to compile it up here and then run it so yeah it asks us for a random name um does someone want to give us a random name um ellie do you want to give us just a name um alex great okay um an adjective so like this can be pretty much anything don't think about like what it's what would make sense just like any adjective to make it funny um nikki silly um a whole number caitlyn do you want to give a random whole number 11 sure sounds great oh well all right let's fix that error okay so basically if you guys see how um after says type in an animal right we should have been able to type in like dog cat giraffe camel whatever we wanted um but i skipped over it and directly went to the next thing which was to print out our whole um it's called whole sentence i guess um so the way the reason that happens basically i'll see if i can try to explain this is um if you see uh back to the code um this happened after our int number software says type in a whole number so basically what happens is if you think about kind of you have like a curse on your computer and it picks up whatever is next to it so after the int it it stays at the end of that line um and we need it to go to the next line in order to pick up what we are going to write there so because the int it stays there and it doesn't move to the next line that's why it skips over the type in an animal so the way you could fix that is to kind of think about like consuming that extra space and then so then you can move over to the next line so the way you do that is after um where it says number equals input.nextint after that and before the the next one that you want to get before the string pad equals input on next line and what you're just going to do is input dot next and i think um i think that should fix it if not so yes what this is going to do it's going to get rid of that it's going to move the cursor from the end where there's nothing after to the next line where you can then type something in and then it'll gather that and put it into your next variable so hopefully this works okay we'll see and so much of coding is about troubleshooting so this should be common um okay we're not going to go through asking again just do what we had before um hello yes okay that didn't okay try pressing enter uh okay that did not work so let's stop next line next oh yeah you might have to do that next one i feel so as you guys could see errors are very very common in java um as you do more and more errors will hopefully decrease but um do you put it here um do you want me to try dot next one dude dot next line where we had it before try that okay hmm yay uh i'm just gonna go for yay okay so that worked um so i mean this is a pretty that's a pretty common error when working with scanner um so the reason why next line worked and just dot next didn't was because dot next line that's why it moves to the next line it was my bad i'm sorry about that but next it wouldn't move it so you need that next line in order to move from the end back to the next line where you can then input your next variable so yeah there's our little uh fun little mad loves game um again you can do anything you want make it longer shorter different kinds of variables different kind of story that's just a little simple thing to um i guess incorporate all the things that we learned from today and yesterday as well so so we have five minutes um you can use time to like maybe make even more labels up here that um we ask for so that we can make a more complicated story or if you want you are free to go uh does anyone have any final questions about anything all right cool so i think our next um next lesson is next saturday i think um wednesday isn't it oh yeah i think it's next saturday yeah it's saturday yeah um i have a question actually um about the tutoring that i saw in the email is that you know something we can use to communicate with you about questions um um did i send you the email yesterday or was it a different email um i've just seen at least maybe in a few emails that there's some kind of tutoring component on you know your website and i'm wondering if it's like you can just yeah like go there not during class times with yeah so the tutoring thing um i believe it's if you sign up then you could sign up for like a 30 minute um like one on one with one of the girls coded volunteers um as for just quick questions i think i don't think there's currently a function on the on the site where you can just type in a quick question um i'm not sure really alex you know andrea if i think they said they're trying to work on it but i don't think that we have a function like that yet um but the tutoring yeah so if you sign up for that um you could sign up for a 30minute session and then um you and whoever like whichever volunteer you're dealing with would work out a time together um through like zoom or google meets or something like that and then i'll work on something there does that kind of make sense to your question um yeah i think so um yeah thank you yeah no problem yes as for just quick questions i don't think we have anything on the site yet i think they might be working on it i'm not a hundred percent sure um hopefully we can get something like that soon that'll be pretty cool yeah yeah right now sorry but you might just want to try googling it or saving it the next class when you can ask us okay that's true also thank you yeah thank you all so much for coming i hope you enjoyed it and learn something new yeah um from now on you can always practice or go back and try to code your own little something and we just hope you have fun you
