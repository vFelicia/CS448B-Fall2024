00:28 - c
01:25 - you
02:16 - all right so just a heads up in about
02:18 - five minutes
02:20 - i like 3 35 um
02:23 - before you guys get too deep into a
02:25 - project i'm just gonna
02:26 - introduce like an extra feature for like
02:29 - if else statements and then
02:34 - we'll let you like play around with it
03:45 - is that again
03:54 - what do i do if i want one thing to
03:56 - print for a stick and another thing
03:58 - different for a wand so
04:01 - basically um just like in olivia's
04:04 - example
04:06 - um you have your if numbers
04:09 - equals one and if number equals equals
04:12 - two right
04:13 - so basically
04:16 - if you want um say number one to be a
04:20 - wand
04:21 - then you will basically
04:24 - put you've earned a magical one under
04:27 - inside of the number equal equals one
04:30 - if bracket then like outside you have
04:34 - the elsif
04:34 - if number equals two and then you can
04:37 - print something else
04:41 - so basically if you want
04:44 - one thing to print for a stick um you
04:47 - can just assign
04:48 - a number to like you can just
04:51 - print something inside that if statement
04:53 - and everything outside
04:56 - like inside that elsif statement what
04:58 - can be for something else
05:02 - sorry does that explain it for you
05:36 - like after you type the wand you can
05:39 - like
05:39 - enter and then you can do
05:42 - system dot out
05:47 - [Music]
05:50 - um
05:52 - okay okay so
05:56 - after let's use your example so after
05:59 - you earn the magic wand
06:01 - you can um
06:10 - so then you can add like
06:14 - oh okay then you can add like another
06:17 - choice
06:18 - so you can add like
06:24 - um
06:27 - let's see you have you have a choice
06:29 - like where do you want to go with the
06:31 - unicorn
06:32 - so um
06:50 - so then you can be like type one
06:53 - to go to the
06:57 - forest or type
07:01 - 2 to go to
07:04 - the mountains right
07:07 - so then after that
07:11 - that's when you can either make a new
07:15 - variable or you can use
07:17 - the same one to do the second choice
07:22 - and then you can make like a new if
07:24 - statement
07:26 - like copying the same one if
07:29 - number equals
07:32 - one and then something happens
07:37 - or else if
07:41 - number equals two
07:46 - and then something else happens or
07:49 - they type nothing so see that's like
07:53 - another pair and then you have
07:58 - like you have one
08:06 - okay so you have one set
08:09 - after you go to this set do you see what
08:11 - i mean
08:14 - yes so then you can do the same thing
08:18 - with the second one the um
08:21 - the choice with the stick
08:38 - um
09:01 - i want um okay that's good
09:09 - all right okay i will scroll up a little
09:11 - bit and then let you play around with
09:13 - what i just did and then do it for the
09:16 - second
09:17 - else if statements and you can make as
09:19 - many else if statements as you want it
09:21 - doesn't
09:22 - just have to be two choices it could be
09:24 - three portals or
09:25 - four so
09:30 - can give you about like 10 to 15 minutes
09:32 - to do that
09:43 - [Music]
09:46 - oh i see is it juicy
09:53 - who joined um
09:58 - have you attended any classes before
10:16 - sleep
10:21 - so just to cut you up to speed um right
10:24 - now we're basically making our own um
10:26 - choose your adventure game using ifo
10:30 - statements
10:39 - nice oh okay
10:42 - so do you understand how to make a class
10:45 - and
10:46 - start up the doc
10:49 - or do you need me to scroll up and show
10:58 - you
11:00 - see okay
12:09 - and i'm just wondering caitlyn with a c
12:11 - are you caught up
12:22 - sweet
12:45 - all right so i'm just gonna
12:49 - i'm gonna like talk about something
12:51 - extra you can do
12:52 - um before you get like too deep into
12:55 - your project
12:56 - um are you guys familiar with like and
12:59 - and or in java
13:08 - okay so i can just like go over it very
13:12 - quickly
13:12 - this is basically for when if you want
13:15 - to like
13:16 - do multiple if statements like in one
13:19 - giant if statement
13:21 - um and i can share my screen
13:42 - can everyone see it
13:52 - see so basically for this
13:55 - it's for if you want to do like
13:59 - a bunch of statements so in my example
14:02 - i have like if input equals one
14:05 - then i'm gonna quit my game and then
14:08 - input equals two i'll print something
14:10 - else
14:11 - input equals three i'll print like the
14:13 - statement
14:14 - and then for everything else i'll print
14:16 - else
14:17 - so right now my game basically
14:20 - runs like this
14:26 - create a new instance of game and then
14:30 - run it so if i print like three
14:34 - it will say printed three two will print
14:37 - something else
14:39 - for everything else will print else
14:42 - and then one will quit everything
14:46 - so in this case what if like
14:49 - say i wanted to print something else
14:53 - for another number like if i wanted
14:58 - if input equals 3
15:02 - or sorry 30 i
15:05 - also want to print this
15:09 - so in that case i could just put like
15:14 - another elsif statement over here right
15:17 - and then put like input equals
15:20 - 30.
15:24 - and then do whatever like
15:28 - basically copy and paste this over right
15:30 - but
15:31 - that's pretty inefficient because i
15:34 - basically have the same code twice
15:36 - instead of doing this what i can also do
15:40 - is over here put an or statement
15:46 - so this symbol the two pipes
15:51 - is basically or that means like
15:54 - if input equals 2 or input equals 3
15:58 - or input equals 30 then i'll print
16:00 - something else
16:05 - and let's say like in a different case
16:08 - right now i have if input equals three
16:11 - then i'll print printed three but what
16:14 - if
16:14 - i wanted like if input
16:19 - like if in a general case if input
16:22 - divided by 2
16:26 - equals 2
16:31 - or let's put it this way if input
16:35 - is an even number
16:38 - then it'll say print it even
16:41 - don't don't mind this symbol it's
16:43 - complicated
16:44 - this is basic the general statement of
16:46 - this is
16:47 - if input divided by two is zero or if
16:50 - the remainder of input divided by two is
16:52 - zero
16:53 - so basically if input is even then i'll
16:56 - say print it even
16:58 - but what if i wanted like more cases so
17:01 - input divided by two equals zero but i
17:03 - also want this
17:04 - input to be less than ten
17:12 - and i'll print even less than less than
17:16 - and less than 10.
17:19 - so i have multiple conditions then i'll
17:22 - use this symbol this is the and symbol
17:25 - so if input is even and input is less
17:27 - than 10
17:29 - then i'll do this
17:32 - so these are just two helpful tools for
17:35 - you to use
17:36 - in case you want to check multiple
17:37 - things at once
17:40 - any questions
17:49 - sweet so i'll let you go back to your
17:52 - coding
17:55 - and just let us know if you have any
17:58 - questions or like any trouble
18:00 - with your program
18:06 - do you still need my screen or y'all
18:12 - good
18:55 - you
19:23 - you
19:51 - you
20:28 - all right just a heads up guys we got
20:30 - about 10 minutes left for this class
21:56 - so
22:10 - foreign
23:06 - foreign
23:20 - um
28:13 - all right so we'll be ending a few
28:16 - minutes early because there's another
28:18 - meeting that's gonna be happening
28:20 - like right around seven or sorry
28:23 - four p.m pst sorry
28:27 - but um thank you so much for coming and
28:29 - we'll see you on one today
28:34 - [Music]
28:37 - bye

Cleaned transcript:

c you all right so just a heads up in about five minutes i like 3 35 um before you guys get too deep into a project i'm just gonna introduce like an extra feature for like if else statements and then we'll let you like play around with it is that again what do i do if i want one thing to print for a stick and another thing different for a wand so basically um just like in olivia's example um you have your if numbers equals one and if number equals equals two right so basically if you want um say number one to be a wand then you will basically put you've earned a magical one under inside of the number equal equals one if bracket then like outside you have the elsif if number equals two and then you can print something else so basically if you want one thing to print for a stick um you can just assign a number to like you can just print something inside that if statement and everything outside like inside that elsif statement what can be for something else sorry does that explain it for you like after you type the wand you can like enter and then you can do system dot out um okay okay so after let's use your example so after you earn the magic wand you can um so then you can add like oh okay then you can add like another choice so you can add like um let's see you have you have a choice like where do you want to go with the unicorn so um so then you can be like type one to go to the forest or type 2 to go to the mountains right so then after that that's when you can either make a new variable or you can use the same one to do the second choice and then you can make like a new if statement like copying the same one if number equals one and then something happens or else if number equals two and then something else happens or they type nothing so see that's like another pair and then you have like you have one okay so you have one set after you go to this set do you see what i mean yes so then you can do the same thing with the second one the um the choice with the stick um i want um okay that's good all right okay i will scroll up a little bit and then let you play around with what i just did and then do it for the second else if statements and you can make as many else if statements as you want it doesn't just have to be two choices it could be three portals or four so can give you about like 10 to 15 minutes to do that oh i see is it juicy who joined um have you attended any classes before sleep so just to cut you up to speed um right now we're basically making our own um choose your adventure game using ifo statements nice oh okay so do you understand how to make a class and start up the doc or do you need me to scroll up and show you see okay and i'm just wondering caitlyn with a c are you caught up sweet all right so i'm just gonna i'm
