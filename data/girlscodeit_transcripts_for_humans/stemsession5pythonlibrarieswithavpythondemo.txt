With timestamps:

00:00 - hi everyone welcome to our fifth stem
00:03 - session
00:04 - in um the girls coded stem session
00:07 - series
00:07 - this one will be on python libraries and
00:10 - we will
00:11 - cover what exactly is a library how and
00:14 - what they're used for we will
00:16 - i will show some basic shapes how to do
00:18 - them in v python
00:20 - and we'll end in with the bouncy box in
00:22 - a bouncy ball in the box tutorial
00:25 - i'm simone i'm the director of education
00:27 - one of the directors of education for
00:28 - girls code it and i'm really excited to
00:30 - share this information with you please
00:31 - subscribe to our channel
00:33 - make sure you come to our classes and
00:35 - without further ado let us begin
00:38 - what is a library so a library is
00:40 - actually pre-made code that can be
00:42 - important
00:42 - imported to avoid repetitively typing it
00:44 - out if you think about it
00:46 - if you have a lot needed to type out so
00:48 - if you have a program that is very long
00:51 - you don't want to keep typing out the
00:52 - same code so many times
00:54 - especially if it's a long piece of code
00:57 - that someone could have already made for
00:59 - you so if it's a basic function
01:00 - like maybe making an image you don't
01:02 - want to type all of that out someone
01:04 - would have already made it for you which
01:06 - is what
01:06 - libraries are they offer an easy and
01:08 - less time-consuming way
01:09 - to accomplish important tasks currently
01:12 - there are
01:13 - one third 137 000
01:16 - python libraries python is such a
01:18 - commonly used language
01:20 - that there are so many libraries because
01:22 - libraries are so useful so it's no
01:24 - surprise there are so many
01:26 - python libraries and libraries in
01:28 - general can help with machine learning
01:29 - data visualization
01:31 - image manipulation and a lot more crew
01:34 - today we'll be going over 3d imaging
01:36 - how to um put how to
01:40 - how to demonstrate images in python but
01:43 - most commonly python is used for this
01:45 - data
01:45 - visualization and manipulation and if
01:48 - you guys want to look into that i would
01:49 - recommend watching our past two stem
01:51 - session videos that were on an intro to
01:53 - data analysis
01:54 - and on a data analysis demo project and
01:56 - commonly used
01:58 - python libraries include numpy
01:59 - tensorflow and vpython
02:02 - and there are so many more but these are
02:04 - the ones that i have heard a lot so i
02:06 - assume you guys have heard them a lot
02:08 - but numpy is a data visualization one
02:11 - tensorflow is used for deep learning
02:13 - machine learning and v
02:14 - python well they're used to help with
02:15 - that and v python is used as i said for
02:18 - 3d images and animation
02:21 - okay let's get started with our visual
02:25 - python
02:26 - so visual python is a python package for
02:30 - 3d animation and design
02:31 - since python doesn't have a built-in 3d
02:34 - visualizer
02:35 - visual python really helps with that
02:37 - that's why it was created
02:38 - in 2000 by these
02:42 - by these men and they were very helpful
02:45 - since this allows us to
02:47 - make images in our code we're using code
02:51 - if you think about if you're creating
02:52 - something like a game the user will be
02:55 - really really bored if it's just text
02:56 - that they have to input
02:58 - and then it spits out something it'll is
03:00 - much more engaging if you have
03:02 - images and that's what v python will
03:03 - allow you to do
03:07 - but so for installing here i'll go into
03:12 - the v python demos so to install the
03:15 - python you can follow these instructions
03:18 - and this is for v python 7. this
03:20 - document is geared toward that but i've
03:21 - installed v
03:22 - python 9 which is a little bit different
03:24 - which is why some of these commands are
03:26 - a little bit different
03:27 - so just pay attention to that make sure
03:28 - you look into that before
03:31 - typing your commands you might get
03:32 - frustrated and then realize that it's
03:33 - just not the correct version
03:36 - but in terminal for os you type this and
03:38 - then in cmd in windows you can type this
03:42 - in both ways you'll get it but the way
03:44 - i'd recommend is i will
03:46 - demonstrate and these are the demos
03:47 - we'll just be using but if you go to
03:50 - this website
03:51 - and i will link this website in the
03:52 - description you can download python
03:54 - python from here and then download v
03:56 - python
03:57 - and of course you need python first
03:59 - before downloading v python
04:01 - so these two make sure to follow these
04:03 - instructions and here it has them for a
04:05 - variety of different
04:06 - systems and it'll take you to this
04:09 - website just download it make sure
04:10 - they're safe
04:11 - you've downloaded the entire file and
04:14 - then you can start using and this will
04:16 - pop up this little icon will pop up and
04:18 - you can start using the python
04:21 - so without further ado let's get to
04:24 - the demos so i will be going first over
04:27 - some basic shapes
04:29 - and i'll do this mostly here but
04:33 - the first thing you want to do is type
04:35 - this line
04:36 - this will allow you to import all of
04:37 - these functions instead of having to
04:39 - import them separately
04:40 - if you don't do this none of this will
04:42 - work you have to make sure that you
04:43 - import them asterix basically means
04:45 - that you're importing every single
04:47 - function that is used in this library
04:49 - you can import them separately but that
04:50 - takes so long it's much easier to just
04:52 - import
04:52 - the whole thing if you want to import
04:54 - like arrow then import
04:56 - box that just doesn't make sense just
04:58 - import them all
04:59 - it'll be way faster way more efficient
05:01 - and
05:02 - you will spend less time with it
05:05 - so i will begin with our arrow so
05:10 - what this is it's basically libraries
05:13 - are basically just
05:14 - a set of functions and that can
05:17 - include all these different attributes
05:20 - to
05:21 - draw out these shapes and the position
05:24 - attribute and there's so many different
05:26 - attributes i will link
05:27 - a website that will go through many more
05:31 - than i will ever be able to
05:32 - go over in a presentation but for now
05:35 - i'll show you guys the basics
05:36 - the position defines the starting point
05:39 - so where you want your arrow to be drawn
05:41 - from and that is zero zero zero and all
05:42 - of these quantities are in the x y and z
05:45 - planes and it's just a vector that you
05:47 - have to add it
05:49 - and you'll see where it is so we start
05:51 - from zero zero zero you guys can start
05:52 - from somewhere else this is just easiest
05:54 - to view for me
05:55 - but to you can start from zero zero zero
05:57 - and here we wanna comment this one
06:00 - i was working with it and uncomment the
06:04 - arrow
06:06 - but
06:07 - [Music]
06:09 - you guys start from zero zero zero and
06:11 - to run this you can press
06:13 - run and click run module or you can just
06:15 - press f5
06:16 - i found find that to be easier the axis
06:19 - will give it the direction that it wants
06:21 - the arrow to go in so it starts from 0 0
06:23 - 0 then it goes in a certain direction
06:24 - for a certain length which is defined
06:26 - here the default value for length if you
06:29 - don't include this it's no biggie it'll
06:31 - just default it to 1 so your arrow will
06:33 - have a length
06:34 - of 1 and the color will be green
06:37 - well i did i said it would be green you
06:39 - can change it to a different color here
06:40 - i've tried to include all the possible
06:42 - colors that can be used in v
06:43 - python but for now let's make our arrow
06:46 - green
06:47 - we click f5 and we get this
06:51 - we have our arrow it starts from zero
06:52 - zero zero and it goes in the axis
06:54 - direction
06:55 - and there's so many different attributes
06:56 - you can make it you can make the width
06:58 - of it to be different you can make this
07:00 - top part to be different
07:02 - so many different things you can do with
07:03 - this but for now let's focus on this so
07:06 - here it starts from zero zero
07:07 - and i just want to show how you can
07:10 - rotate to rotate you can press the shift
07:12 - key
07:12 - the right mouse key and then just move
07:15 - around
07:16 - and that is how you can rotate your
07:17 - arrow to zoom you can press the alt key
07:20 - alt the left mouse button
07:23 - and just drag your mouse forwards and
07:25 - backwards
07:28 - we x out of that x out of that this is
07:30 - the python shell that i showed a little
07:32 - bit
07:33 - before it runs your program
07:36 - let's comment this and move on to our
07:38 - next shape which is a box and the box is
07:40 - really useful
07:41 - it is going to be used in our bouncy
07:43 - ball in the box tutorial
07:44 - but for a box you want to define a
07:46 - starting position so it starts the
07:48 - center is at 0 0 0
07:50 - then its axis the way it is going to
07:51 - extend outwards towards
07:53 - is this vector 1 0 1. you can change
07:56 - these of course
07:57 - all of these values i've just set to
07:59 - values that
08:00 - popped into my mind but except these
08:03 - these are
08:04 - zero zero zero i think is the most
08:05 - efficient one unless you want you're
08:07 - making like a
08:08 - better project if you just want to view
08:09 - them set them as zero zero zero so
08:11 - they're in the center of your screen
08:13 - the length we've set to three height
08:15 - three with three of course if you don't
08:16 - set these they will just default to one
08:19 - and the color i've set to blue so let's
08:21 - run this and see how it
08:23 - is and all of the rest of these i've
08:25 - commented
08:26 - which means that you the program won't
08:28 - read them it'll just skip over them
08:30 - so we click f5 and we get our box
08:35 - and here is our beautiful magnificent
08:37 - box that starts at zero zero zero
08:39 - extends outwards with a length height
08:42 - and width of three so it's technically a
08:43 - cube
08:45 - if you want to think about that but this
08:48 - is our box and this is
08:49 - the basic way to make a box and of
08:51 - course there are so many different
08:52 - attributes i will link the website
08:54 - again i keep saying this but i'll link
08:55 - the website
08:57 - for you guys to look at the other
08:58 - attributes you can use moving on
09:01 - we have our cone and i wanted to
09:04 - demonstrate with the cone a different
09:06 - way
09:06 - if you want to work with this cone not
09:08 - just to have it print out
09:09 - you can and you want to do other stuff
09:11 - to it which we'll do later
09:12 - but if you want to just do different
09:14 - stuff with it you can define it as a
09:16 - separate variable
09:18 - and that way you can call it later in
09:20 - your program just like we
09:21 - call variables and define them in python
09:24 - but here we have our cone we've
09:26 - positioned it the vector zero zero zero
09:28 - the axis it'll extend outwards is this
09:30 - the radius of the base is three and its
09:32 - color
09:33 - will be red and here i will show this a
09:36 - little bit later i'll actually delete
09:38 - this for now
09:39 - and something cool you can do with it
09:42 - but let's
09:43 - run it and look at our amazing cone
09:47 - so this is our cone of course we'll want
09:48 - to rotate it a bit that's just the view
09:50 - that it gives us in
09:51 - and this is our amazing cone here has
09:53 - its base with the radius of i believe i
09:55 - said
09:56 - three yes three and you can rotate it
09:59 - around just like i said before
10:02 - and that's how you make a basic cone
10:04 - here i want to
10:05 - show how you can use materials so
10:08 - material
10:10 - is um just you can use you can make it
10:13 - like steel wood whatever
10:15 - there's a bunch of ones that are default
10:18 - already built into
10:19 - the python or you can import your own
10:21 - but for now we're just going to use
10:23 - the wood which is a simple built in one
10:25 - we're going to click f5 and it's going
10:27 - to give us a wooden
10:31 - oh whoops you want to type in materials
10:33 - not material
10:34 - my bad so you type in material equals
10:37 - materials dot wood
10:39 - f5 and you rotate it around and it's a
10:43 - wooden material
10:44 - and that's really awesome because this
10:46 - means you can create like a house in v
10:47 - python you there's endless possibilities
10:51 - so i hope you guys look into that
10:54 - next up is our
10:59 - cylinder our cylinder have made white
11:01 - we're going to make it start i've just
11:03 - been demoing these for you guys i could
11:04 - just link you guys to this document but
11:06 - i wanted to show you guys how these work
11:08 - um our cylinder starts at zero zero zero
11:12 - the center
11:12 - then its axis that it extends up and
11:15 - down from
11:16 - or side to side whatever direction it
11:18 - extends from is 5 0
11:19 - 0 and this will be sideways because of
11:21 - course this is an x coordinate that's
11:22 - being changed
11:24 - and our radius is 1
11:27 - and our color that we've set or i've set
11:29 - is one is white
11:32 - f5 and this should give us a horizontal
11:34 - cylinder
11:36 - with a radius of one we could rotate it
11:38 - as i showed you guys before
11:40 - and here is our magnificent cylinder
11:43 - and if you guys sent it to a different
11:45 - um
11:47 - point it'll rotate around that point
11:49 - right now it's rotating around zero zero
11:50 - when i rotate it
11:52 - but otherwise if you just offset it
11:54 - would rotate around different point of
11:55 - course
11:58 - here we comment cylinder and we move on
12:00 - to our next one which is the ellipsoid
12:02 - which is basically an ellipse i don't
12:04 - know why they call it ellipsoid but
12:05 - ellipse
12:07 - the center will be at zero zero zero the
12:09 - length will be three
12:10 - height eight two with two and of course
12:13 - i've just
12:13 - made up these values you could of course
12:15 - change them but this one
12:17 - works out really well in the small
12:18 - window
12:22 - we've set it to color yellow and let's
12:23 - see how it turns out
12:25 - f5 and here is our beautiful
12:28 - ellipse
12:31 - it starts at zero zero extends with the
12:34 - height width
12:35 - and length that i said and it is yellow
12:39 - yet another color that can be used in v
12:41 - python
12:46 - okay next we comment that
12:49 - and we have a helix and a helix is
12:51 - really neat i'll actually go to the
12:52 - powerpoint for a sec
12:54 - but um the helix and of course all of
12:57 - these have links attached to them but
12:59 - you guys can just find it at the main
13:00 - link that'll link in the description
13:02 - here it says navigation which i already
13:04 - went over
13:05 - but let's start with the helix the helix
13:06 - is basically a spiral
13:08 - and it looks really really cool it looks
13:11 - like a spring
13:12 - and we want to position the center or it
13:14 - to start from to start spiraling from
13:16 - zero zero zero
13:17 - then we're this is the axis or the
13:19 - vector negative 1 negative 2 negative 3
13:21 - is the
13:22 - vector across which it will spiral
13:25 - around
13:26 - the radius of 2 how large the coils will
13:28 - be
13:29 - and the color will be orange so let's go
13:31 - f5
13:33 - and here we have our amazing spiral
13:36 - it starts from zero zero spirals with a
13:38 - radius of two
13:40 - and it's along the axis that i defined
13:42 - and to find the axis you can just do a
13:44 - basic vector addition
13:46 - it's basically a coordinate in the x y
13:48 - and z planes
13:49 - pretty self-explanatory i hope
13:52 - but that is i think that is the one of
13:55 - the coolest ones of the shapes i really
13:57 - like the helix
13:59 - and now i'm going to actually move in to
14:02 - label and text
14:04 - and this is you can make text and
14:08 - in v python which is really cool if you
14:10 - want a label or just have text in it
14:13 - but the difference is that label will
14:15 - surround
14:16 - your text with a box text will just type
14:19 - it out
14:19 - but label will type it out with a box
14:22 - around it and let's see the difference i
14:24 - will demonstrate it here
14:26 - let's uncomment label so we uncomment
14:30 - labeled
14:30 - and you can change your text font
14:32 - whatever
14:33 - f5 we're going to make it a magenta
14:35 - color by the way v python does not you
14:37 - can't type in purple here you have to
14:39 - type in magenta as i have learned from
14:41 - experience
14:42 - because purple is my favorite color and
14:44 - they didn't have you have type and
14:45 - magenta
14:46 - it's so sad but f5
14:50 - and here we get the label of girls code
14:52 - it is amazing in our magenta letters
14:54 - and with the box around it and i just
14:57 - wanted to demonstrate and here it's
14:59 - centered at 0 0 0.
15:01 - i wanted to demonstrate how you can
15:03 - change it to a different font this is
15:04 - right now this font
15:06 - you can import fonts or just use the
15:07 - default built-in ones from the python
15:10 - i'm going to use the built-in ones
15:11 - because i don't have time to import but
15:15 - we can change it to this separate font
15:18 - and if we click f5
15:20 - it'll give us a different font see it's
15:22 - a much smaller
15:23 - different font okay
15:26 - and that as you guys saw and you guys
15:27 - can change the text here girls code
15:29 - is amazing which is why i put that in
15:31 - the text um
15:32 - i hope you guys join our classes
15:35 - subscribe to our channel
15:36 - watch our videos so on so forth
15:40 - but it starts at zero zero zero then if
15:43 - we comment this
15:44 - and we go to text i would just want to
15:46 - show the difference but
15:48 - text you um text will
15:51 - here we i'll just show you guys text is
15:53 - green and here i've
15:55 - aligned it left but it doesn't have the
15:58 - box around it which is what is different
16:01 - and i hope you guys see that it's pretty
16:04 - evident
16:04 - no box no label if we want to align it a
16:08 - different way
16:08 - here we can just type in center or right
16:11 - if we type in center it should put it in
16:13 - the center without
16:14 - us having to define it as a vector for
16:16 - its starting position
16:20 - and of course it puts in the center big
16:22 - words subscribe to our channel make sure
16:24 - to follow what the python is telling you
16:26 - guys
16:26 - subscribe to our channel
16:30 - alrighty moving on from text and labels
16:32 - we have
16:36 - we have our pyramid and this is just
16:39 - another shape i wanted to show
16:41 - this color is just a very light blue i
16:44 - have no idea how to pronounce it
16:45 - please don't laugh at me but this color
16:48 - is a light blue
16:49 - we have it at a starting position of
16:51 - zero zero zero as we've had all the rest
16:53 - f5 and here's our pyramid of course we
16:57 - have to zoom out a bit because you can't
16:58 - really see it
16:59 - so if you click alt and then you um
17:04 - drag the mouse down then to rotate shift
17:07 - right click and rotate and here's our
17:10 - beautiful pyramid it's a
17:12 - light blue color
17:16 - alrighty next shape
17:19 - we have points and points are really
17:21 - useful if you want to just
17:23 - like show a graph in python or in v
17:25 - python maybe
17:26 - or just have like a scatter plot
17:28 - different points or just
17:30 - have points everywhere i don't know if
17:32 - you want to make like a
17:34 - connect the dots type thing and be
17:35 - python sounds fun
17:37 - you guys should try that um but
17:41 - points we define their um where the
17:44 - point
17:44 - want we want it to be located its size
17:48 - and we define its color
17:51 - and if we click f5 it will give us a
17:53 - point right in the center at 0 0
17:56 - and its color will be red
17:59 - and if you just want to make multiple of
18:01 - these at different origins just define
18:02 - it at like 1
18:03 - 0 0 which will be like here and then you
18:07 - just can keep going like that to create
18:08 - a connect the dots game
18:13 - our next one that i want to talk about
18:15 - was the sphere
18:18 - and the sphere i wanted to note how we
18:20 - have a position
18:22 - radius color size so why have
18:25 - radius and size why did i put that there
18:28 - the truth is you don't have to do this
18:30 - um you can either use one i just put
18:32 - them here so it's easier for us to
18:34 - for me to show you guys but if you put
18:37 - both of them the program will still work
18:39 - python will just v python will just
18:41 - default to the first value and it will
18:43 - not pay attention to this value
18:46 - so if we run this it should give us a
18:48 - sphere with a radius of 5.
18:49 - and if you guys want it's a good
18:51 - opportunity since i don't have enough
18:52 - time
18:53 - but to try just this one and you'll see
18:55 - that it's a different sphere
18:57 - make sure to delete this one of course
19:01 - but um right now it will default to
19:03 - radius equals five so
19:05 - if and of course we have our starting
19:06 - position here
19:08 - f5 and it should run and give us a
19:11 - beautiful magnificent egg-like sphere
19:14 - with a radius of five if we want to zoom
19:16 - in
19:17 - or out out but we just drag our mouse
19:20 - down while pressing the alt key and
19:23 - here's our magnificent sphere that we
19:25 - can use
19:25 - let's say for a bouncy ball in the box
19:32 - commenting that we move on to the last
19:36 - thing i wanted to talk about which is
19:38 - i'm going to go back to the powerpoint
19:39 - for a second
19:41 - so here as you guys can see i actually
19:43 - didn't go over the curve
19:44 - from the last slide so make sure to look
19:47 - at that it's
19:48 - um really useful if you want to make a
19:49 - curve i just didn't have enough time to
19:51 - cover it
19:52 - but if you want to um
19:55 - i didn't go over lighten lighting either
19:58 - so make sure you look at that too this
20:00 - is pretty neat
20:01 - um in the python it's a nice feature
20:06 - but if we go on the extra features
20:08 - include
20:09 - such as textures materials which i
20:10 - showed you is very similar to textures
20:12 - which is why i didn't show textures i
20:14 - thought materials would be cooler
20:15 - textures is also really cool so you guys
20:17 - should look into that
20:19 - clone will just clone your object it'll
20:21 - make the same one
20:23 - but a different object if you want if
20:25 - you want to manipulate or
20:26 - change that object but make save the
20:28 - other one this is really useful
20:30 - rate will change the rate at which your
20:32 - animation is
20:34 - um completed and angle is the one i
20:36 - wanted to show
20:38 - angle will actually rotate your object
20:41 - so
20:41 - if you put it you want to have like c
20:45 - rotate angle let's make it like
20:50 - let's make it like 170 degrees
20:55 - and we want to rotate this object make
20:57 - sure to uncomment this if you're going
20:59 - to uncomment
21:00 - c because we've defined this object here
21:02 - we don't want to just call in a random
21:04 - object that we haven't created so it'll
21:05 - rotate it
21:07 - 70 degrees so f5 170 sorry
21:11 - and here our pyramid is rotated and it's
21:12 - not really visible because it's so close
21:14 - to 180
21:14 - but you guys should play around with
21:16 - that too here we have our wooden pyramid
21:18 - our redwood pyramid rotated at 175
21:23 - and it'll rotate it around the axis that
21:25 - you defined for it
21:26 - so make sure to uncommon this so it has
21:30 - an
21:30 - axis to rotate around let's close this
21:36 - yeah um
21:39 - and we comment this
21:44 - and let's comment that one too and i
21:46 - just wanted to note how here we define
21:47 - this object as c
21:49 - equals this is an example of how an
21:51 - object can be referenced or a variable
21:53 - can be referenced later in the program
21:56 - and that's really useful if you don't
21:57 - want to just print it out and if you're
21:59 - making a more complicated program like
22:01 - the tutorial for a ball in the box
22:03 - you want to define these objects
22:05 - beforehand so that you're not
22:08 - just having them print out and then not
22:10 - knowing what to do with them after that
22:14 - okay
22:18 - so i think
22:23 - let me check real quick awesome
22:26 - okay we're on track
22:32 - but um here as i explained rate is
22:35 - i don't think i explained this one i i'm
22:37 - gonna explain it right now again
22:39 - sorry if i'm explaining it again but
22:40 - this is the rate at which the animation
22:42 - performs
22:43 - so animations such as the bouncy ball on
22:45 - the box
22:47 - [Music]
22:49 - those will perform at a certain rate so
22:52 - you just want to define your frequency
22:55 - that you want them to perform at if you
22:56 - want to go slower so you can
22:58 - you know see how it's made trails is
23:01 - really neat
23:02 - it'll show you the way that the object
23:04 - has traveled in an animation or how it's
23:06 - made
23:07 - so it'll have um points appear
23:11 - and it'll show you an arrow like not an
23:13 - arrow but like the direction of how it's
23:15 - traveling
23:16 - so you guys should definitely check
23:17 - these out i didn't get to go through a
23:19 - lot of these
23:20 - but they're really cool um
23:23 - so i'm going to link this in the
23:25 - description which is just
23:27 - more information on it on v python
23:31 - and i just remembered that i forgot to
23:34 - note that you have to make sure to
23:36 - include this line at the top
23:38 - this line is very important because
23:40 - what's the point of using all these
23:41 - functions if you haven't imported them
23:43 - asterisks will allow you to import all
23:45 - of them i'm not sure actually if i went
23:47 - over this sorry if i'm going over it
23:48 - again
23:49 - but it'll allow you to import them you
23:51 - don't want to import them all separately
23:53 - that would make no sense but here
23:55 - in v python 7 this is a tricky thing
23:57 - because in the document
23:59 - if you guys noted it says
24:02 - that you have to import v python but
24:04 - we're importing visual
24:05 - so this is the an example of how
24:08 - different versions
24:10 - conflict so you have to make sure to
24:11 - know which work what works for your own
24:13 - version
24:14 - asterix will import everything make sure
24:16 - to include this line
24:17 - in order to actually be able to use
24:19 - these functions
24:21 - and of course i'd like to especially
24:24 - thank our volunteer kennedy for making
24:25 - us this presentation
24:27 - um thank you to the sources that she
24:30 - used
24:30 - which is this link that i'll link in the
24:32 - description that has a lot more
24:34 - information that covers this this was
24:36 - basically going over some basic shapes
24:38 - i hope you guys found it helpful but
24:39 - this is more in depth if you want to
24:41 - create a project
24:42 - and as i'm going to link this in the
24:45 - description but this is a bouncy ball in
24:47 - the box tutorial created by
24:48 - by our volunteer kennedy
24:52 - um this is one of the many projects you
24:54 - can create in python here i'll show the
24:56 - code for it
24:57 - how it looks we want to open
25:00 - and if you download it from here it has
25:02 - pre-made code for you so you can click
25:04 - open
25:04 - click bounce 2 which is the bouncy ball
25:07 - in a box
25:07 - this is all the code for it and we click
25:10 - f5 to run it
25:12 - and look at how cool it looks it's so
25:14 - mesmerizing
25:16 - but basically this you have to know
25:17 - about colors about the spheres that we
25:19 - talked about about boxes for the walls
25:21 - the trace
25:22 - here and um you have to know how to
25:26 - offset these so that it looks
25:28 - connected right so i hope you guys look
25:31 - into this more and create some fun
25:33 - projects such as this one
25:34 - look at the tutorial video it includes
25:36 - all the code necessary for this with
25:38 - explanations
25:41 - all right i think this concludes
25:45 - our lesson so of course thank you so
25:49 - much for being here with us
25:50 - our next stem session stem session six
25:52 - will be a live
25:53 - um zoom call with some of our volunteers
25:57 - who are in college
25:58 - and they will talk about their
25:59 - experiences and
26:01 - um you guys will have a chance to ask
26:03 - them questions so make sure
26:05 - to attend that one of course
26:09 - check out our website we have courses
26:10 - that are ongoing check out our channel
26:12 - if you can't make those courses to watch
26:14 - them recorded
26:15 - um right now we're doing python make
26:17 - sure to sign up for the web dev courses
26:19 - that are coming up
26:20 - sometime in late um in late november
26:23 - early december
26:26 - and yes thank you so much for being here
26:29 - make sure
26:30 - to look at some of the previous stem
26:32 - sessions
26:33 - i hope this tutorial helped for v python
26:36 - i hope you guys are
26:38 - interested now to see what v python can
26:40 - do and
26:41 - what how many projects you can create
26:42 - with it make sure to check out this
26:44 - tutorial
26:45 - thank you for supporting us oh and make
26:48 - sure to subscribe to our channel
26:49 - vpython tells you to subscribe so make
26:52 - sure to subscribe
26:54 - so thank you guys and hope to see you
26:57 - all soon
26:58 - bye guys

Cleaned transcript:

hi everyone welcome to our fifth stem session in um the girls coded stem session series this one will be on python libraries and we will cover what exactly is a library how and what they're used for we will i will show some basic shapes how to do them in v python and we'll end in with the bouncy box in a bouncy ball in the box tutorial i'm simone i'm the director of education one of the directors of education for girls code it and i'm really excited to share this information with you please subscribe to our channel make sure you come to our classes and without further ado let us begin what is a library so a library is actually premade code that can be important imported to avoid repetitively typing it out if you think about it if you have a lot needed to type out so if you have a program that is very long you don't want to keep typing out the same code so many times especially if it's a long piece of code that someone could have already made for you so if it's a basic function like maybe making an image you don't want to type all of that out someone would have already made it for you which is what libraries are they offer an easy and less timeconsuming way to accomplish important tasks currently there are one third 137 000 python libraries python is such a commonly used language that there are so many libraries because libraries are so useful so it's no surprise there are so many python libraries and libraries in general can help with machine learning data visualization image manipulation and a lot more crew today we'll be going over 3d imaging how to um put how to how to demonstrate images in python but most commonly python is used for this data visualization and manipulation and if you guys want to look into that i would recommend watching our past two stem session videos that were on an intro to data analysis and on a data analysis demo project and commonly used python libraries include numpy tensorflow and vpython and there are so many more but these are the ones that i have heard a lot so i assume you guys have heard them a lot but numpy is a data visualization one tensorflow is used for deep learning machine learning and v python well they're used to help with that and v python is used as i said for 3d images and animation okay let's get started with our visual python so visual python is a python package for 3d animation and design since python doesn't have a builtin 3d visualizer visual python really helps with that that's why it was created in 2000 by these by these men and they were very helpful since this allows us to make images in our code we're using code if you think about if you're creating something like a game the user will be really really bored if it's just text that they have to input and then it spits out something it'll is much more engaging if you have images and that's what v python will allow you to do but so for installing here i'll go into the v python demos so to install the python you can follow these instructions and this is for v python 7. this document is geared toward that but i've installed v python 9 which is a little bit different which is why some of these commands are a little bit different so just pay attention to that make sure you look into that before typing your commands you might get frustrated and then realize that it's just not the correct version but in terminal for os you type this and then in cmd in windows you can type this in both ways you'll get it but the way i'd recommend is i will demonstrate and these are the demos we'll just be using but if you go to this website and i will link this website in the description you can download python python from here and then download v python and of course you need python first before downloading v python so these two make sure to follow these instructions and here it has them for a variety of different systems and it'll take you to this website just download it make sure they're safe you've downloaded the entire file and then you can start using and this will pop up this little icon will pop up and you can start using the python so without further ado let's get to the demos so i will be going first over some basic shapes and i'll do this mostly here but the first thing you want to do is type this line this will allow you to import all of these functions instead of having to import them separately if you don't do this none of this will work you have to make sure that you import them asterix basically means that you're importing every single function that is used in this library you can import them separately but that takes so long it's much easier to just import the whole thing if you want to import like arrow then import box that just doesn't make sense just import them all it'll be way faster way more efficient and you will spend less time with it so i will begin with our arrow so what this is it's basically libraries are basically just a set of functions and that can include all these different attributes to draw out these shapes and the position attribute and there's so many different attributes i will link a website that will go through many more than i will ever be able to go over in a presentation but for now i'll show you guys the basics the position defines the starting point so where you want your arrow to be drawn from and that is zero zero zero and all of these quantities are in the x y and z planes and it's just a vector that you have to add it and you'll see where it is so we start from zero zero zero you guys can start from somewhere else this is just easiest to view for me but to you can start from zero zero zero and here we wanna comment this one i was working with it and uncomment the arrow but you guys start from zero zero zero and to run this you can press run and click run module or you can just press f5 i found find that to be easier the axis will give it the direction that it wants the arrow to go in so it starts from 0 0 0 then it goes in a certain direction for a certain length which is defined here the default value for length if you don't include this it's no biggie it'll just default it to 1 so your arrow will have a length of 1 and the color will be green well i did i said it would be green you can change it to a different color here i've tried to include all the possible colors that can be used in v python but for now let's make our arrow green we click f5 and we get this we have our arrow it starts from zero zero zero and it goes in the axis direction and there's so many different attributes you can make it you can make the width of it to be different you can make this top part to be different so many different things you can do with this but for now let's focus on this so here it starts from zero zero and i just want to show how you can rotate to rotate you can press the shift key the right mouse key and then just move around and that is how you can rotate your arrow to zoom you can press the alt key alt the left mouse button and just drag your mouse forwards and backwards we x out of that x out of that this is the python shell that i showed a little bit before it runs your program let's comment this and move on to our next shape which is a box and the box is really useful it is going to be used in our bouncy ball in the box tutorial but for a box you want to define a starting position so it starts the center is at 0 0 0 then its axis the way it is going to extend outwards towards is this vector 1 0 1. you can change these of course all of these values i've just set to values that popped into my mind but except these these are zero zero zero i think is the most efficient one unless you want you're making like a better project if you just want to view them set them as zero zero zero so they're in the center of your screen the length we've set to three height three with three of course if you don't set these they will just default to one and the color i've set to blue so let's run this and see how it is and all of the rest of these i've commented which means that you the program won't read them it'll just skip over them so we click f5 and we get our box and here is our beautiful magnificent box that starts at zero zero zero extends outwards with a length height and width of three so it's technically a cube if you want to think about that but this is our box and this is the basic way to make a box and of course there are so many different attributes i will link the website again i keep saying this but i'll link the website for you guys to look at the other attributes you can use moving on we have our cone and i wanted to demonstrate with the cone a different way if you want to work with this cone not just to have it print out you can and you want to do other stuff to it which we'll do later but if you want to just do different stuff with it you can define it as a separate variable and that way you can call it later in your program just like we call variables and define them in python but here we have our cone we've positioned it the vector zero zero zero the axis it'll extend outwards is this the radius of the base is three and its color will be red and here i will show this a little bit later i'll actually delete this for now and something cool you can do with it but let's run it and look at our amazing cone so this is our cone of course we'll want to rotate it a bit that's just the view that it gives us in and this is our amazing cone here has its base with the radius of i believe i said three yes three and you can rotate it around just like i said before and that's how you make a basic cone here i want to show how you can use materials so material is um just you can use you can make it like steel wood whatever there's a bunch of ones that are default already built into the python or you can import your own but for now we're just going to use the wood which is a simple built in one we're going to click f5 and it's going to give us a wooden oh whoops you want to type in materials not material my bad so you type in material equals materials dot wood f5 and you rotate it around and it's a wooden material and that's really awesome because this means you can create like a house in v python you there's endless possibilities so i hope you guys look into that next up is our cylinder our cylinder have made white we're going to make it start i've just been demoing these for you guys i could just link you guys to this document but i wanted to show you guys how these work um our cylinder starts at zero zero zero the center then its axis that it extends up and down from or side to side whatever direction it extends from is 5 0 0 and this will be sideways because of course this is an x coordinate that's being changed and our radius is 1 and our color that we've set or i've set is one is white f5 and this should give us a horizontal cylinder with a radius of one we could rotate it as i showed you guys before and here is our magnificent cylinder and if you guys sent it to a different um point it'll rotate around that point right now it's rotating around zero zero when i rotate it but otherwise if you just offset it would rotate around different point of course here we comment cylinder and we move on to our next one which is the ellipsoid which is basically an ellipse i don't know why they call it ellipsoid but ellipse the center will be at zero zero zero the length will be three height eight two with two and of course i've just made up these values you could of course change them but this one works out really well in the small window we've set it to color yellow and let's see how it turns out f5 and here is our beautiful ellipse it starts at zero zero extends with the height width and length that i said and it is yellow yet another color that can be used in v python okay next we comment that and we have a helix and a helix is really neat i'll actually go to the powerpoint for a sec but um the helix and of course all of these have links attached to them but you guys can just find it at the main link that'll link in the description here it says navigation which i already went over but let's start with the helix the helix is basically a spiral and it looks really really cool it looks like a spring and we want to position the center or it to start from to start spiraling from zero zero zero then we're this is the axis or the vector negative 1 negative 2 negative 3 is the vector across which it will spiral around the radius of 2 how large the coils will be and the color will be orange so let's go f5 and here we have our amazing spiral it starts from zero zero spirals with a radius of two and it's along the axis that i defined and to find the axis you can just do a basic vector addition it's basically a coordinate in the x y and z planes pretty selfexplanatory i hope but that is i think that is the one of the coolest ones of the shapes i really like the helix and now i'm going to actually move in to label and text and this is you can make text and in v python which is really cool if you want a label or just have text in it but the difference is that label will surround your text with a box text will just type it out but label will type it out with a box around it and let's see the difference i will demonstrate it here let's uncomment label so we uncomment labeled and you can change your text font whatever f5 we're going to make it a magenta color by the way v python does not you can't type in purple here you have to type in magenta as i have learned from experience because purple is my favorite color and they didn't have you have type and magenta it's so sad but f5 and here we get the label of girls code it is amazing in our magenta letters and with the box around it and i just wanted to demonstrate and here it's centered at 0 0 0. i wanted to demonstrate how you can change it to a different font this is right now this font you can import fonts or just use the default builtin ones from the python i'm going to use the builtin ones because i don't have time to import but we can change it to this separate font and if we click f5 it'll give us a different font see it's a much smaller different font okay and that as you guys saw and you guys can change the text here girls code is amazing which is why i put that in the text um i hope you guys join our classes subscribe to our channel watch our videos so on so forth but it starts at zero zero zero then if we comment this and we go to text i would just want to show the difference but text you um text will here we i'll just show you guys text is green and here i've aligned it left but it doesn't have the box around it which is what is different and i hope you guys see that it's pretty evident no box no label if we want to align it a different way here we can just type in center or right if we type in center it should put it in the center without us having to define it as a vector for its starting position and of course it puts in the center big words subscribe to our channel make sure to follow what the python is telling you guys subscribe to our channel alrighty moving on from text and labels we have we have our pyramid and this is just another shape i wanted to show this color is just a very light blue i have no idea how to pronounce it please don't laugh at me but this color is a light blue we have it at a starting position of zero zero zero as we've had all the rest f5 and here's our pyramid of course we have to zoom out a bit because you can't really see it so if you click alt and then you um drag the mouse down then to rotate shift right click and rotate and here's our beautiful pyramid it's a light blue color alrighty next shape we have points and points are really useful if you want to just like show a graph in python or in v python maybe or just have like a scatter plot different points or just have points everywhere i don't know if you want to make like a connect the dots type thing and be python sounds fun you guys should try that um but points we define their um where the point want we want it to be located its size and we define its color and if we click f5 it will give us a point right in the center at 0 0 and its color will be red and if you just want to make multiple of these at different origins just define it at like 1 0 0 which will be like here and then you just can keep going like that to create a connect the dots game our next one that i want to talk about was the sphere and the sphere i wanted to note how we have a position radius color size so why have radius and size why did i put that there the truth is you don't have to do this um you can either use one i just put them here so it's easier for us to for me to show you guys but if you put both of them the program will still work python will just v python will just default to the first value and it will not pay attention to this value so if we run this it should give us a sphere with a radius of 5. and if you guys want it's a good opportunity since i don't have enough time but to try just this one and you'll see that it's a different sphere make sure to delete this one of course but um right now it will default to radius equals five so if and of course we have our starting position here f5 and it should run and give us a beautiful magnificent egglike sphere with a radius of five if we want to zoom in or out out but we just drag our mouse down while pressing the alt key and here's our magnificent sphere that we can use let's say for a bouncy ball in the box commenting that we move on to the last thing i wanted to talk about which is i'm going to go back to the powerpoint for a second so here as you guys can see i actually didn't go over the curve from the last slide so make sure to look at that it's um really useful if you want to make a curve i just didn't have enough time to cover it but if you want to um i didn't go over lighten lighting either so make sure you look at that too this is pretty neat um in the python it's a nice feature but if we go on the extra features include such as textures materials which i showed you is very similar to textures which is why i didn't show textures i thought materials would be cooler textures is also really cool so you guys should look into that clone will just clone your object it'll make the same one but a different object if you want if you want to manipulate or change that object but make save the other one this is really useful rate will change the rate at which your animation is um completed and angle is the one i wanted to show angle will actually rotate your object so if you put it you want to have like c rotate angle let's make it like let's make it like 170 degrees and we want to rotate this object make sure to uncomment this if you're going to uncomment c because we've defined this object here we don't want to just call in a random object that we haven't created so it'll rotate it 70 degrees so f5 170 sorry and here our pyramid is rotated and it's not really visible because it's so close to 180 but you guys should play around with that too here we have our wooden pyramid our redwood pyramid rotated at 175 and it'll rotate it around the axis that you defined for it so make sure to uncommon this so it has an axis to rotate around let's close this yeah um and we comment this and let's comment that one too and i just wanted to note how here we define this object as c equals this is an example of how an object can be referenced or a variable can be referenced later in the program and that's really useful if you don't want to just print it out and if you're making a more complicated program like the tutorial for a ball in the box you want to define these objects beforehand so that you're not just having them print out and then not knowing what to do with them after that okay so i think let me check real quick awesome okay we're on track but um here as i explained rate is i don't think i explained this one i i'm gonna explain it right now again sorry if i'm explaining it again but this is the rate at which the animation performs so animations such as the bouncy ball on the box those will perform at a certain rate so you just want to define your frequency that you want them to perform at if you want to go slower so you can you know see how it's made trails is really neat it'll show you the way that the object has traveled in an animation or how it's made so it'll have um points appear and it'll show you an arrow like not an arrow but like the direction of how it's traveling so you guys should definitely check these out i didn't get to go through a lot of these but they're really cool um so i'm going to link this in the description which is just more information on it on v python and i just remembered that i forgot to note that you have to make sure to include this line at the top this line is very important because what's the point of using all these functions if you haven't imported them asterisks will allow you to import all of them i'm not sure actually if i went over this sorry if i'm going over it again but it'll allow you to import them you don't want to import them all separately that would make no sense but here in v python 7 this is a tricky thing because in the document if you guys noted it says that you have to import v python but we're importing visual so this is the an example of how different versions conflict so you have to make sure to know which work what works for your own version asterix will import everything make sure to include this line in order to actually be able to use these functions and of course i'd like to especially thank our volunteer kennedy for making us this presentation um thank you to the sources that she used which is this link that i'll link in the description that has a lot more information that covers this this was basically going over some basic shapes i hope you guys found it helpful but this is more in depth if you want to create a project and as i'm going to link this in the description but this is a bouncy ball in the box tutorial created by by our volunteer kennedy um this is one of the many projects you can create in python here i'll show the code for it how it looks we want to open and if you download it from here it has premade code for you so you can click open click bounce 2 which is the bouncy ball in a box this is all the code for it and we click f5 to run it and look at how cool it looks it's so mesmerizing but basically this you have to know about colors about the spheres that we talked about about boxes for the walls the trace here and um you have to know how to offset these so that it looks connected right so i hope you guys look into this more and create some fun projects such as this one look at the tutorial video it includes all the code necessary for this with explanations all right i think this concludes our lesson so of course thank you so much for being here with us our next stem session stem session six will be a live um zoom call with some of our volunteers who are in college and they will talk about their experiences and um you guys will have a chance to ask them questions so make sure to attend that one of course check out our website we have courses that are ongoing check out our channel if you can't make those courses to watch them recorded um right now we're doing python make sure to sign up for the web dev courses that are coming up sometime in late um in late november early december and yes thank you so much for being here make sure to look at some of the previous stem sessions i hope this tutorial helped for v python i hope you guys are interested now to see what v python can do and what how many projects you can create with it make sure to check out this tutorial thank you for supporting us oh and make sure to subscribe to our channel vpython tells you to subscribe so make sure to subscribe so thank you guys and hope to see you all soon bye guys
