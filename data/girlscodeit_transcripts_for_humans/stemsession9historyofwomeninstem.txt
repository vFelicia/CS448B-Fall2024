With timestamps:

00:00 - hi everyone welcome to our ninth stem
00:02 - session
00:03 - and today we'll be discussing the
00:04 - history of women in stem
00:06 - first we'll go into some historical
00:10 - discrimination
00:11 - that's happened in the past then we'll
00:12 - talk about some inspirational stories
00:15 - of influential women in the stem field
00:17 - and then we'll go on some more
00:19 - inspirational and motivational
00:21 - um quotes as well as ways that you can
00:24 - really get out there and pursue a stem
00:27 - education
00:29 - so let's begin um we'll start off with
00:32 - the history of discrimination
00:35 - throughout history many women were never
00:38 - able to receive an education this was
00:41 - a very this spanned a very long time
00:44 - were met there were all men
00:45 - schools women were seen as people who
00:47 - had to stay in the house
00:48 - cook clean and men were the only ones
00:51 - getting an education
00:53 - leading to the inability for them to
00:55 - pursue a stem career
00:57 - like how are you supposed to pursue stem
00:59 - if you don't have an education
01:01 - in some places it was illegal for women
01:04 - to have
01:05 - jobs or to pursue stem careers
01:08 - and the male workers would
01:12 - receive credit for their research which
01:14 - was very frustrating because
01:16 - who wants to um work on something for so
01:19 - long
01:20 - only not to get the credit for that and
01:23 - there were prejudices towards women of
01:25 - color and
01:26 - um always with racial minorities and
01:31 - it's been harder for women of who belong
01:34 - to those groups to receive education in
01:36 - recognition for their work
01:37 - but it's really important that we
01:39 - recognize women um
01:41 - in general and that we help
01:45 - women as well as helping ourselves to
01:48 - pursue those stem careers because them
01:51 - is such
01:52 - an amazing and versatile career
01:55 - education option that is so big and that
01:58 - can really help us in the future
02:01 - so now we'll discuss some historical
02:02 - contributions of woman
02:04 - and first we'll start off with mary
02:06 - jackson and you guys have probably heard
02:08 - of her she's nasa's first
02:09 - african-american
02:10 - woman to help in america's win at the
02:13 - space race which was
02:15 - the competition between the soviet union
02:18 - in the usa
02:19 - and she really helped put
02:22 - the um she helped build
02:26 - the rocket and she was very important
02:30 - um our next woman who we will talk about
02:34 - is
02:34 - ruby heroes so she was a
02:36 - japanese-american biochemist who
02:38 - conducted research
02:39 - for the development of vaccines for
02:42 - polio and hay fever
02:44 - this is a different field of course mary
02:46 - jackson worked more in like space
02:48 - engineering
02:49 - obviously ruby heroes works in
02:51 - biochemistry
02:52 - and well worked and she really helped
02:54 - there too
02:57 - our next woman is kanda
03:00 - kadambini ganguly who was the first
03:03 - south asian female
03:04 - physician and she was trained in western
03:06 - medicine and she graduated in south asia
03:09 - um especially in asian culture it was
03:12 - really hard for women to pursue
03:14 - um stem education or in many cases
03:18 - education in general so it's really a
03:20 - great achievement that she was able to
03:22 - be the first
03:23 - female doctor really who graduated in
03:26 - south asia
03:27 - and finally we have helia bravo hollis
03:31 - who became the first certified biologist
03:33 - of mexico and she even
03:34 - introduced a new career that we know
03:36 - today is botany
03:37 - and i think that not only are these
03:39 - stories inspiring of these women
03:41 - who have done so much in the past but
03:43 - also it's important to see all the
03:45 - different
03:46 - fields in stem you have biochemistry
03:49 - you have rocket science literally you
03:52 - have
03:53 - botany and you have medicine and it's
03:56 - just stem is not just
03:58 - engineering and programming there's so
04:00 - much more to it and that's why it's so
04:01 - important to get people
04:03 - into it because there's a lot of career
04:05 - options and it can
04:06 - help us so much in the future
04:09 - now we're going to talk about some
04:10 - ongoing discrimination as well as some
04:12 - statistics
04:13 - so women are really not represented in
04:16 - certain fields
04:17 - and that causes a lot of women who go
04:20 - into these fields
04:21 - to feel overwhelmed and isolated so of
04:23 - course a lot of women will not want to
04:25 - pursue stem careers
04:27 - if they're the only ones in their
04:29 - classes or their workplaces
04:32 - current stereotypes include that women
04:35 - should be more oriented towards
04:37 - fields that involve caring such as
04:40 - nursing
04:40 - teaching fields that aren't really um
04:43 - that are still important but that are
04:46 - not
04:46 - at the basis of stem the instead of
04:49 - nursing women should
04:50 - instead of doctors women should be
04:51 - nurses and another key thing here is
04:54 - that to bridge the gender gap we also
04:56 - have to allow
04:57 - male representation in these fields
04:58 - because a lot of men
05:00 - are not these jobs aren't seen fit for
05:03 - men
05:04 - either so that's also a key point that
05:06 - we should
05:07 - try to implement also
05:10 - there's a lot of lack of confidence when
05:13 - women are going to stem fields
05:15 - because even though as of
05:19 - this presentation mentions here young
05:21 - girls have the same
05:22 - or higher scores as men or as boys
05:25 - on their tests they tend not to go into
05:28 - these fields because
05:29 - there are so many men in
05:32 - their workplace or classes and they just
05:35 - don't want to feel alone
05:39 - there's also a huge gender gap in stem
05:41 - and that is what
05:42 - really girls code is trying to eliminate
05:44 - that gender gap that guy should do this
05:46 - girl should do this
05:47 - and guys should do more stem um
05:50 - girls who code actually report that 74
05:53 - of middle school
05:54 - girls are interested in stem which means
05:56 - that they have all
05:58 - said that they want to go into it but
06:00 - only 0.4 percent
06:02 - go to pursue computer science as a major
06:04 - in college that's a huge difference
06:06 - that's a decimal literally like a
06:09 - fraction less than 0.5
06:11 - it's um terrifying that those girls who
06:14 - have these dreams when they're
06:16 - let's say like um 11 or 12 that they
06:19 - want to
06:19 - be engineers or programmers that they
06:22 - only
06:22 - that they can't get into those majors
06:24 - because they feel isolated and
06:26 - overwhelmed
06:27 - at the male dominance of those careers
06:30 - and among stem another statistic is that
06:33 - among stem graduates
06:35 - aged 25 to 34 women account for 59
06:38 - percent of those in science and
06:40 - technology
06:41 - but only 23 um percent of those graduate
06:45 - from engineering
06:46 - and 30 are from mathematics so
06:49 - um women only account in general for 13
06:53 - of engineers and that's way less than
06:55 - half
06:56 - we should have a 50 and 50
06:59 - men and women should be equally
07:00 - represented in the stem
07:02 - fields but as you guys can see there is
07:05 - only
07:06 - 13 percent of woman and much
07:09 - more men male representation
07:14 - a lot of obstacles for women in stem is
07:17 - that
07:18 - they are being held to higher standards
07:21 - because
07:22 - of course they are not expected to go
07:23 - into these fields so once they do
07:26 - they're um there's a lot of competition
07:29 - there that
07:30 - um there's less women so they should be
07:32 - able to do more
07:33 - in a lot of cases um they should just be
07:36 - held to the standard of women or equal
07:38 - to male
07:39 - to men so they should have the same
07:42 - abilities and another key obstacle is
07:46 - family or cultural pressure many women
07:50 - especially in asia report
07:53 - being told by a co-worker that they
07:54 - should work less after having children
07:57 - and in some countries it's illegal for
08:00 - women
08:00 - to have jobs if their husband hasn't
08:04 - authorized them to so all of this um
08:07 - a woman's so in a lot of these cultures
08:10 - a woman's
08:10 - life depends on her husband or her
08:13 - family
08:14 - and what they want her to do which is
08:16 - unfair because a lot of times tradition
08:18 - can be blocking the progress
08:22 - especially getting more people into the
08:24 - stem careers and
08:25 - fields and finally mistaken identity
08:29 - is this one is
08:32 - very unmotivating because women
08:35 - um working in stem are often mistaken
08:39 - for just custodians or administrative
08:41 - staff such as secretaries
08:43 - um and instead of being
08:46 - seen as scientists and engineers and
08:48 - doctors and
08:49 - those people who really do the research
08:52 - and who help with that
08:53 - and it can be very um damaging
08:56 - when you do so much work and people only
08:59 - see you
09:00 - as let's say a custodian when people
09:02 - look at you and they're like oh you're
09:04 - not a scientist you're a custodian
09:06 - that's very um demoralizing
09:11 - and so now on a more positive note after
09:14 - we've discussed all those ways that
09:16 - um women have obstacles in the stem
09:18 - careers
09:19 - let's talk about ways to bridge the
09:21 - gender gap in stem
09:23 - and we can make a difference and that's
09:25 - the important thing that if we work
09:26 - together
09:27 - if we bridge that gender gap if we have
09:30 - um
09:31 - men and women working together then we
09:33 - can make the most progress
09:35 - and be the best society that we can be
09:39 - an important part is to showcase women
09:41 - in stem as role models
09:42 - a lot of girls will be looking towards
09:44 - role models that are women when they're
09:46 - in a class full of guys
09:47 - or when they're in their workplace full
09:49 - of men
09:51 - um and they'll need that inspiration
09:52 - from someone they should
09:54 - be able to see someone see oh she was in
09:56 - the same spot as i am but look at how
09:58 - far she got and there are so
10:00 - many women who can serve as role models
10:04 - such as the ones that we mentioned in
10:06 - the beginning they have inspiring
10:07 - stories and
10:08 - they should be showcased um instead of
10:11 - suppressed and that's a very
10:13 - that'll motivate other girls to pursue
10:15 - these careers
10:18 - um and a key other point is to encourage
10:21 - girls around you you should encourage
10:23 - your friends your family
10:25 - your colleagues anyone who's interested
10:26 - in stem to really pursue this career
10:28 - because it's an amazing career path
10:30 - and everyone it should be open to
10:31 - everyone um
10:33 - if you're a girl try to get all your
10:35 - friends if you're a guy try to get your
10:37 - girlfriends
10:38 - too to um pursue these stem careers it
10:42 - honestly doesn't matter your gender just
10:44 - try
10:44 - to get everyone around you to interest
10:48 - them
10:48 - because everyone should be allowed a
10:50 - chance and with that encouragement from
10:52 - your friends and family and with that
10:53 - support
10:54 - people girls or guys will be more likely
10:57 - to go
10:58 - into the stem field and we young women
11:01 - will feel more represented and won't be
11:03 - so overwhelmed
11:05 - if they're in a safe and supportive
11:07 - environment
11:10 - another thing is to get hands-on
11:11 - experience a lot of people find stem
11:15 - to be boring just sitting in front of a
11:18 - computer all day typing and tapping and
11:20 - typing and typing without much
11:23 - achievement and actually it's not like
11:25 - that
11:27 - with stem there are so many different
11:29 - career paths that you can pursue
11:31 - that eventually you'll find something
11:32 - that you like and the stem is really
11:34 - hands-on
11:35 - a lot of it is on the computer but if
11:37 - you think about it
11:38 - um you can have the science part
11:42 - of it or you're doing something and
11:44 - that's really motivational
11:45 - um and stem can be creative you can have
11:48 - you can find a problem and try to solve
11:50 - it in your own way
11:51 - and that creativity is very based on
11:53 - your own unique
11:54 - personality and what you can do and
11:57 - that's why
11:58 - a lot like 72 percent of girls it says
12:01 - here indicate that their willingness
12:03 - to work jobs that make a difference and
12:05 - 90 percent of girls
12:06 - identify as creative however they see
12:09 - stem as boring
12:10 - and pointless and this is important to
12:13 - educate
12:13 - um everyone about first the importance
12:17 - of stem and second that they can really
12:18 - be creative with it and that it's not
12:20 - just a job where you sit
12:21 - at your computer all day just typing out
12:24 - words on the screen
12:29 - and you everyone should try to join stem
12:33 - extracurriculars these extra classes
12:36 - extra ways to delve into stem
12:40 - are an excellent way of bridging the
12:42 - stem gap early on because they will
12:45 - allow everyone to see the beauty of stem
12:47 - and they will allow girls to have more
12:51 - experiences with stem more positive
12:53 - experiences with stem
12:56 - and can also it can also teach about
12:59 - real life
12:59 - and actual jobs a lot of these
13:03 - extra activities are just introducing
13:06 - you to a real life experience that you
13:08 - could have with a stem
13:09 - job and a microsoft study
13:14 - as it says here concluded that middle
13:16 - school girls who took part in
13:18 - extracurricular stem programs we're two
13:20 - to three times more likely to study
13:21 - physics engineering and computer science
13:23 - and that's huge because um when
13:27 - girls take these extra activities
13:28 - they're more motivated they're more
13:30 - interested
13:31 - and this is the point of these
13:32 - activities to make girls and
13:34 - everyone interested in these
13:37 - subjects and to pursue them later on to
13:39 - show them that they can be fun and
13:41 - creative and interesting
13:43 - and important
13:46 - and of course never get discouraged um
13:50 - it can be very discouraging
13:53 - um to see to be in a class with all guys
13:57 - to be the only girl in the class
13:58 - or to be in a male-dominated workplace
14:02 - when and of and of course is very
14:04 - discouraging if these people around you
14:06 - do not support what you're doing
14:08 - and um that's why it's really big
14:12 - to have that support from people around
14:14 - you but
14:16 - um you can't let all those obstacles
14:19 - overcome you
14:20 - there's so many inspirational stories of
14:22 - women out there who have done
14:24 - so much the stem career is so versatile
14:26 - there will always
14:27 - be something for you to do you will be
14:30 - you will
14:30 - be accepted and together it is important
14:35 - that we
14:36 - um bond and we can
14:39 - make we can create that supportive
14:41 - environment for girls
14:43 - and really help them pursue those stem
14:46 - fields to make
14:47 - our world more equal and to make our
14:49 - world
14:50 - progress really and change and change
14:53 - in a lot of cases can be good especially
14:55 - in our
14:56 - um coveted world right now we need so
14:58 - many
14:59 - people who are interested in those
15:01 - subjects such as stem
15:03 - to help us through these hard times
15:06 - and to find solutions to all of these
15:10 - problems
15:12 - and another key point is to be
15:15 - comfortable with mistakes
15:16 - mistakes are a part of progress um
15:20 - if you make a mistake that's okay
15:23 - because now you know what you did wrong
15:25 - you can keep going from there it can be
15:28 - very discouraging to make a mistake and
15:31 - to feel like you failed
15:33 - but you can't be successful if you
15:37 - haven't failed in the past because that
15:39 - just means that you're not pushing
15:40 - yourself enough that you're not
15:42 - going for the hardest that you're not
15:44 - going the 100 percent
15:47 - and it can be very discouraging when you
15:49 - do make a mistake but you just work
15:50 - through it and the more
15:51 - you mistake you make when you finally
15:54 - get in the end the more confident you
15:56 - feel the more
15:57 - um the more you feel just so good about
16:00 - yourself
16:01 - and the more achievement you can get
16:05 - and it's true that a lot of times women
16:08 - can be judged
16:09 - for failing harsher than men but
16:12 - it's important that we get over that and
16:16 - that we keep making
16:17 - those mistakes that help us make
16:20 - progress in our research
16:22 - and that really help us bridge that
16:25 - gender gap because
16:26 - um we are the change and we have to do
16:29 - something we can't just
16:30 - give up we have to keep going even when
16:32 - we make a mistake
16:34 - and it can be discouraging it can be
16:35 - hard but we have to
16:38 - get through that and make those mistakes
16:40 - in order to know what we're doing
16:41 - wrong in order to fully push ourselves
16:44 - and make that progress
16:48 - and here's some organizations to check
16:50 - out and of course
16:52 - it might not be easy if you don't live
16:55 - close to them but the smithsonian
16:57 - science education center you guys can
16:59 - look all of these up the open colleges
17:02 - society of stem women of color the
17:04 - national academics of science
17:05 - engineering and medicine and the stem
17:07 - sisterhood
17:07 - all of these places are known to
17:10 - bring guys and girls together to bridge
17:14 - that gender gap to
17:15 - support women in their journey through
17:17 - stem
17:19 - make sure to check these ones out and
17:23 - if you're passionate about stem you
17:25 - should explore those skills that you and
17:27 - those things that you like
17:28 - doing and get more into it and that'll
17:31 - make you feel
17:32 - more confident and less overwhelmed
17:34 - entering into a male dominated field
17:36 - knowing that you can do something
17:38 - very well is a huge morale booster
17:41 - when you're going into a difficult field
17:45 - in here of course are some resources and
17:47 - most of them are for all ages
17:50 - if you want to start somewhere of course
17:51 - we have girls coded courses that you can
17:53 - start with
17:54 - but you can also go for these code.org
17:57 - scratch
17:58 - hopscotch cs unplugged thimble coursera
18:01 - all of these you guys can look up and
18:04 - look into them
18:06 - because they can help girls get access
18:08 - to a coding and stem
18:12 - education
18:14 - and now we're going to talk about some
18:16 - few inspirational quotes
18:18 - of course these are
18:21 - quotes by women who have worked in the
18:24 - stem industry and as we said it's really
18:26 - important to have those inspirational
18:27 - stories and that inspirational advice
18:30 - and here is you have to always be open
18:32 - to learning
18:33 - new skills and miss maina says dare to
18:36 - dream and then go for it with everything
18:38 - you've got i'm not going to read an
18:39 - entire quote you guys can read on your
18:41 - own
18:41 - but it's really important to be open to
18:43 - learn these new skills because that's
18:44 - how you make progress you have to be
18:46 - open to learn new things
18:47 - in order to pursue those different paths
18:51 - to open your mind really to everything
18:55 - that's out there
18:59 - um the next quote is don't be afraid to
19:01 - ask questions
19:02 - questions like mistakes are not bad um
19:06 - questions can show your interest your
19:09 - curiosity your motivation
19:11 - questions allow you to understand better
19:14 - and
19:15 - um they'll allow you to make progress
19:18 - faster if you
19:19 - if you're not sure about something it's
19:21 - not good to just keep it to yourself
19:23 - because then you may make a mistake and
19:25 - that will hinder your progress
19:26 - even though we said mistakes are good
19:28 - asking questions if
19:30 - it can prevent those uncertainties
19:34 - and when you have an uncertainty you're
19:37 - really not motivated to keep going right
19:40 - so you have to ask those questions you
19:42 - have to make sure that you know what
19:44 - you're doing
19:45 - and that you're sure of the path that
19:48 - you want to take
19:53 - and of course you have to believe in
19:55 - yourself you have to believe that what
19:56 - you're doing
19:57 - is good and that what you're doing is
19:59 - right that what you're doing is
20:01 - motivational and inspiring and that even
20:04 - when it gets
20:05 - hard that you are making a difference
20:10 - i know sometimes it can seem unrewarding
20:12 - when you
20:13 - are working on a problem and you haven't
20:15 - been able to get far on it
20:16 - but even that research that you've done
20:19 - on that problem that
20:20 - is still really really big because the
20:21 - research is helpful since then you can
20:24 - communicate with others
20:25 - they can tell you they can add to your
20:28 - research and that communication
20:30 - with adding to your research eventually
20:33 - we will figure
20:34 - it out as a group and
20:37 - communication and believing in yourself
20:40 - is key because
20:41 - when you believe in yourself you can
20:42 - really break through all those
20:44 - stereotypes
20:45 - break through all that discrimination
20:47 - and that is
20:48 - key to being able to pursue any
20:51 - path that you would desire not just them
20:53 - but any
20:54 - path that you want to take in life
21:00 - and of course we already talked about
21:02 - this but don't be afraid of failures
21:03 - and this is another quote that helps
21:05 - with that
21:06 - um because failures teach us that we
21:09 - have to be accepting not only of others
21:11 - but of ourselves and without we have to
21:13 - be
21:14 - aware and that we realize what we need
21:16 - to work on and that's what failures help
21:18 - us with that's what mistakes help us
21:20 - with
21:21 - they really help with the progress the
21:24 - journey
21:26 - and its mistakes are the bene beginning
21:28 - of everyone's career path as she says in
21:30 - this quote
21:31 - because it is essential to learn what we
21:34 - that
21:35 - what could go wrong before making that
21:37 - progress
21:40 - um once again we talked about not
21:43 - getting discouraged because even if you
21:44 - got a negative response
21:46 - you should keep going because you don't
21:48 - need the
21:50 - um you have to believe in yourself you
21:54 - don't have to be discouraged by
21:56 - people giving you um harsh
21:59 - feedback because
22:02 - um you have to work hard
22:05 - and get past that because though you
22:08 - have to remember that those mistakes are
22:10 - fine
22:10 - and that that negative response is just
22:13 - trying to discourage you and that you
22:15 - can be
22:16 - you can change the way they think about
22:18 - you that you can really
22:20 - break through those stereotypes and
22:24 - be the best person you can be because of
22:27 - course the way she says it here you are
22:29 - perfect the way you are
22:30 - you have to believe in yourself that you
22:32 - can solve this problem
22:34 - even if people do not support you have
22:36 - to support yourself
22:38 - and that's really the most important
22:39 - thing to support yourself
22:41 - in your journey because eventually you
22:43 - will get there
22:44 - and it will be amazing
22:50 - um celebrating small successes this is a
22:52 - key part of progress um
22:54 - progress is made by a few small
22:56 - successes and then
22:58 - you get to the big ones even the
23:00 - smallest things can help you
23:02 - motivate you to keep going and that's
23:04 - why it's important to have those small
23:06 - um achievements because they
23:09 - lead up to a big achievement and really
23:11 - help you be
23:13 - give your best and um
23:18 - having those small successes lets you
23:20 - build up to
23:21 - one or many big successes in your life
23:25 - and every achievement should be
23:28 - celebrated
23:34 - and now let's talk girls code it as a
23:37 - part of girls code it
23:38 - you are already making a difference by
23:40 - learning to code
23:42 - in our lessons you are creating a safer
23:45 - environment for young women to prosper
23:46 - you're
23:47 - supporting people and um
23:50 - you it's amazing that you have chosen to
23:52 - enter into this organization to be
23:55 - a part of this organization to support
23:58 - others in their journey
23:59 - and to have others support you that you
24:01 - believe in yourself enough to challenge
24:03 - yourself
24:03 - with these classes and these videos
24:07 - in these challenges and to be able to
24:10 - help others
24:11 - along the way and in girls code that's
24:14 - what we really try to create a positive
24:16 - environment for a woman to work together
24:19 - um alongside a lot of guys to be able to
24:22 - bridge that gender gap
24:24 - and to help young woman
24:27 - prosper and really find
24:30 - that stem can be creative that it can be
24:33 - an amazing field and that is not just
24:36 - for guys
24:40 - last quote by our president obama
24:44 - one of the things that i really strongly
24:45 - believe in is that we need to have more
24:47 - girls interested in math science and
24:49 - engineering
24:50 - we've got half the population that is
24:52 - way underrepresented in those fields and
24:54 - that means that we've got a whole bunch
24:56 - of talent not being encouraged the way
24:57 - they need to
24:58 - and he's right when half of the
25:01 - population are girls there's so much
25:03 - talent hidden in there
25:05 - that we haven't unlocked that we haven't
25:10 - used and that's really terrible because
25:12 - in order to make the most
25:14 - progress in order for our world to be
25:15 - the best that it can be
25:17 - we have to all work together and having
25:20 - half the population
25:22 - represented by the while the other one
25:24 - is suppressed
25:25 - is not a good idea because then we only
25:27 - get half the progress
25:28 - and half the amazing achievements that
25:31 - we could have
25:34 - well thank you for listening everyone i
25:36 - hope you enjoyed this
25:38 - presentation on the history of woman in
25:40 - stem
25:41 - feel free to um let us know in the
25:44 - comments
25:45 - who is a woman that inspires you and to
25:47 - let us know about any suggestions
25:49 - to make our girls code organization more
25:54 - supportive and better and of course make
25:58 - sure to check out our classes and the
25:59 - rest of our stem session videos
26:01 - our web dev class is currently going on
26:04 - and just remember
26:05 - that it is important for you to be in
26:07 - these fields it is important for you to
26:09 - push yourself
26:10 - and to believe in yourself that you can
26:12 - do this and that is
26:13 - the um conclusion to this presentation
26:16 - the summary
26:17 - the most important point is to believe
26:19 - in yourself
26:20 - to that you can do this that you can
26:24 - pursue
26:25 - a field that is largely male dominated
26:27 - and that we can work together
26:29 - in order to create the best world
26:31 - possible
26:32 - thank you for listening everyone

Cleaned transcript:

hi everyone welcome to our ninth stem session and today we'll be discussing the history of women in stem first we'll go into some historical discrimination that's happened in the past then we'll talk about some inspirational stories of influential women in the stem field and then we'll go on some more inspirational and motivational um quotes as well as ways that you can really get out there and pursue a stem education so let's begin um we'll start off with the history of discrimination throughout history many women were never able to receive an education this was a very this spanned a very long time were met there were all men schools women were seen as people who had to stay in the house cook clean and men were the only ones getting an education leading to the inability for them to pursue a stem career like how are you supposed to pursue stem if you don't have an education in some places it was illegal for women to have jobs or to pursue stem careers and the male workers would receive credit for their research which was very frustrating because who wants to um work on something for so long only not to get the credit for that and there were prejudices towards women of color and um always with racial minorities and it's been harder for women of who belong to those groups to receive education in recognition for their work but it's really important that we recognize women um in general and that we help women as well as helping ourselves to pursue those stem careers because them is such an amazing and versatile career education option that is so big and that can really help us in the future so now we'll discuss some historical contributions of woman and first we'll start off with mary jackson and you guys have probably heard of her she's nasa's first africanamerican woman to help in america's win at the space race which was the competition between the soviet union in the usa and she really helped put the um she helped build the rocket and she was very important um our next woman who we will talk about is ruby heroes so she was a japaneseamerican biochemist who conducted research for the development of vaccines for polio and hay fever this is a different field of course mary jackson worked more in like space engineering obviously ruby heroes works in biochemistry and well worked and she really helped there too our next woman is kanda kadambini ganguly who was the first south asian female physician and she was trained in western medicine and she graduated in south asia um especially in asian culture it was really hard for women to pursue um stem education or in many cases education in general so it's really a great achievement that she was able to be the first female doctor really who graduated in south asia and finally we have helia bravo hollis who became the first certified biologist of mexico and she even introduced a new career that we know today is botany and i think that not only are these stories inspiring of these women who have done so much in the past but also it's important to see all the different fields in stem you have biochemistry you have rocket science literally you have botany and you have medicine and it's just stem is not just engineering and programming there's so much more to it and that's why it's so important to get people into it because there's a lot of career options and it can help us so much in the future now we're going to talk about some ongoing discrimination as well as some statistics so women are really not represented in certain fields and that causes a lot of women who go into these fields to feel overwhelmed and isolated so of course a lot of women will not want to pursue stem careers if they're the only ones in their classes or their workplaces current stereotypes include that women should be more oriented towards fields that involve caring such as nursing teaching fields that aren't really um that are still important but that are not at the basis of stem the instead of nursing women should instead of doctors women should be nurses and another key thing here is that to bridge the gender gap we also have to allow male representation in these fields because a lot of men are not these jobs aren't seen fit for men either so that's also a key point that we should try to implement also there's a lot of lack of confidence when women are going to stem fields because even though as of this presentation mentions here young girls have the same or higher scores as men or as boys on their tests they tend not to go into these fields because there are so many men in their workplace or classes and they just don't want to feel alone there's also a huge gender gap in stem and that is what really girls code is trying to eliminate that gender gap that guy should do this girl should do this and guys should do more stem um girls who code actually report that 74 of middle school girls are interested in stem which means that they have all said that they want to go into it but only 0.4 percent go to pursue computer science as a major in college that's a huge difference that's a decimal literally like a fraction less than 0.5 it's um terrifying that those girls who have these dreams when they're let's say like um 11 or 12 that they want to be engineers or programmers that they only that they can't get into those majors because they feel isolated and overwhelmed at the male dominance of those careers and among stem another statistic is that among stem graduates aged 25 to 34 women account for 59 percent of those in science and technology but only 23 um percent of those graduate from engineering and 30 are from mathematics so um women only account in general for 13 of engineers and that's way less than half we should have a 50 and 50 men and women should be equally represented in the stem fields but as you guys can see there is only 13 percent of woman and much more men male representation a lot of obstacles for women in stem is that they are being held to higher standards because of course they are not expected to go into these fields so once they do they're um there's a lot of competition there that um there's less women so they should be able to do more in a lot of cases um they should just be held to the standard of women or equal to male to men so they should have the same abilities and another key obstacle is family or cultural pressure many women especially in asia report being told by a coworker that they should work less after having children and in some countries it's illegal for women to have jobs if their husband hasn't authorized them to so all of this um a woman's so in a lot of these cultures a woman's life depends on her husband or her family and what they want her to do which is unfair because a lot of times tradition can be blocking the progress especially getting more people into the stem careers and fields and finally mistaken identity is this one is very unmotivating because women um working in stem are often mistaken for just custodians or administrative staff such as secretaries um and instead of being seen as scientists and engineers and doctors and those people who really do the research and who help with that and it can be very um damaging when you do so much work and people only see you as let's say a custodian when people look at you and they're like oh you're not a scientist you're a custodian that's very um demoralizing and so now on a more positive note after we've discussed all those ways that um women have obstacles in the stem careers let's talk about ways to bridge the gender gap in stem and we can make a difference and that's the important thing that if we work together if we bridge that gender gap if we have um men and women working together then we can make the most progress and be the best society that we can be an important part is to showcase women in stem as role models a lot of girls will be looking towards role models that are women when they're in a class full of guys or when they're in their workplace full of men um and they'll need that inspiration from someone they should be able to see someone see oh she was in the same spot as i am but look at how far she got and there are so many women who can serve as role models such as the ones that we mentioned in the beginning they have inspiring stories and they should be showcased um instead of suppressed and that's a very that'll motivate other girls to pursue these careers um and a key other point is to encourage girls around you you should encourage your friends your family your colleagues anyone who's interested in stem to really pursue this career because it's an amazing career path and everyone it should be open to everyone um if you're a girl try to get all your friends if you're a guy try to get your girlfriends too to um pursue these stem careers it honestly doesn't matter your gender just try to get everyone around you to interest them because everyone should be allowed a chance and with that encouragement from your friends and family and with that support people girls or guys will be more likely to go into the stem field and we young women will feel more represented and won't be so overwhelmed if they're in a safe and supportive environment another thing is to get handson experience a lot of people find stem to be boring just sitting in front of a computer all day typing and tapping and typing and typing without much achievement and actually it's not like that with stem there are so many different career paths that you can pursue that eventually you'll find something that you like and the stem is really handson a lot of it is on the computer but if you think about it um you can have the science part of it or you're doing something and that's really motivational um and stem can be creative you can have you can find a problem and try to solve it in your own way and that creativity is very based on your own unique personality and what you can do and that's why a lot like 72 percent of girls it says here indicate that their willingness to work jobs that make a difference and 90 percent of girls identify as creative however they see stem as boring and pointless and this is important to educate um everyone about first the importance of stem and second that they can really be creative with it and that it's not just a job where you sit at your computer all day just typing out words on the screen and you everyone should try to join stem extracurriculars these extra classes extra ways to delve into stem are an excellent way of bridging the stem gap early on because they will allow everyone to see the beauty of stem and they will allow girls to have more experiences with stem more positive experiences with stem and can also it can also teach about real life and actual jobs a lot of these extra activities are just introducing you to a real life experience that you could have with a stem job and a microsoft study as it says here concluded that middle school girls who took part in extracurricular stem programs we're two to three times more likely to study physics engineering and computer science and that's huge because um when girls take these extra activities they're more motivated they're more interested and this is the point of these activities to make girls and everyone interested in these subjects and to pursue them later on to show them that they can be fun and creative and interesting and important and of course never get discouraged um it can be very discouraging um to see to be in a class with all guys to be the only girl in the class or to be in a maledominated workplace when and of and of course is very discouraging if these people around you do not support what you're doing and um that's why it's really big to have that support from people around you but um you can't let all those obstacles overcome you there's so many inspirational stories of women out there who have done so much the stem career is so versatile there will always be something for you to do you will be you will be accepted and together it is important that we um bond and we can make we can create that supportive environment for girls and really help them pursue those stem fields to make our world more equal and to make our world progress really and change and change in a lot of cases can be good especially in our um coveted world right now we need so many people who are interested in those subjects such as stem to help us through these hard times and to find solutions to all of these problems and another key point is to be comfortable with mistakes mistakes are a part of progress um if you make a mistake that's okay because now you know what you did wrong you can keep going from there it can be very discouraging to make a mistake and to feel like you failed but you can't be successful if you haven't failed in the past because that just means that you're not pushing yourself enough that you're not going for the hardest that you're not going the 100 percent and it can be very discouraging when you do make a mistake but you just work through it and the more you mistake you make when you finally get in the end the more confident you feel the more um the more you feel just so good about yourself and the more achievement you can get and it's true that a lot of times women can be judged for failing harsher than men but it's important that we get over that and that we keep making those mistakes that help us make progress in our research and that really help us bridge that gender gap because um we are the change and we have to do something we can't just give up we have to keep going even when we make a mistake and it can be discouraging it can be hard but we have to get through that and make those mistakes in order to know what we're doing wrong in order to fully push ourselves and make that progress and here's some organizations to check out and of course it might not be easy if you don't live close to them but the smithsonian science education center you guys can look all of these up the open colleges society of stem women of color the national academics of science engineering and medicine and the stem sisterhood all of these places are known to bring guys and girls together to bridge that gender gap to support women in their journey through stem make sure to check these ones out and if you're passionate about stem you should explore those skills that you and those things that you like doing and get more into it and that'll make you feel more confident and less overwhelmed entering into a male dominated field knowing that you can do something very well is a huge morale booster when you're going into a difficult field in here of course are some resources and most of them are for all ages if you want to start somewhere of course we have girls coded courses that you can start with but you can also go for these code.org scratch hopscotch cs unplugged thimble coursera all of these you guys can look up and look into them because they can help girls get access to a coding and stem education and now we're going to talk about some few inspirational quotes of course these are quotes by women who have worked in the stem industry and as we said it's really important to have those inspirational stories and that inspirational advice and here is you have to always be open to learning new skills and miss maina says dare to dream and then go for it with everything you've got i'm not going to read an entire quote you guys can read on your own but it's really important to be open to learn these new skills because that's how you make progress you have to be open to learn new things in order to pursue those different paths to open your mind really to everything that's out there um the next quote is don't be afraid to ask questions questions like mistakes are not bad um questions can show your interest your curiosity your motivation questions allow you to understand better and um they'll allow you to make progress faster if you if you're not sure about something it's not good to just keep it to yourself because then you may make a mistake and that will hinder your progress even though we said mistakes are good asking questions if it can prevent those uncertainties and when you have an uncertainty you're really not motivated to keep going right so you have to ask those questions you have to make sure that you know what you're doing and that you're sure of the path that you want to take and of course you have to believe in yourself you have to believe that what you're doing is good and that what you're doing is right that what you're doing is motivational and inspiring and that even when it gets hard that you are making a difference i know sometimes it can seem unrewarding when you are working on a problem and you haven't been able to get far on it but even that research that you've done on that problem that is still really really big because the research is helpful since then you can communicate with others they can tell you they can add to your research and that communication with adding to your research eventually we will figure it out as a group and communication and believing in yourself is key because when you believe in yourself you can really break through all those stereotypes break through all that discrimination and that is key to being able to pursue any path that you would desire not just them but any path that you want to take in life and of course we already talked about this but don't be afraid of failures and this is another quote that helps with that um because failures teach us that we have to be accepting not only of others but of ourselves and without we have to be aware and that we realize what we need to work on and that's what failures help us with that's what mistakes help us with they really help with the progress the journey and its mistakes are the bene beginning of everyone's career path as she says in this quote because it is essential to learn what we that what could go wrong before making that progress um once again we talked about not getting discouraged because even if you got a negative response you should keep going because you don't need the um you have to believe in yourself you don't have to be discouraged by people giving you um harsh feedback because um you have to work hard and get past that because though you have to remember that those mistakes are fine and that that negative response is just trying to discourage you and that you can be you can change the way they think about you that you can really break through those stereotypes and be the best person you can be because of course the way she says it here you are perfect the way you are you have to believe in yourself that you can solve this problem even if people do not support you have to support yourself and that's really the most important thing to support yourself in your journey because eventually you will get there and it will be amazing um celebrating small successes this is a key part of progress um progress is made by a few small successes and then you get to the big ones even the smallest things can help you motivate you to keep going and that's why it's important to have those small um achievements because they lead up to a big achievement and really help you be give your best and um having those small successes lets you build up to one or many big successes in your life and every achievement should be celebrated and now let's talk girls code it as a part of girls code it you are already making a difference by learning to code in our lessons you are creating a safer environment for young women to prosper you're supporting people and um you it's amazing that you have chosen to enter into this organization to be a part of this organization to support others in their journey and to have others support you that you believe in yourself enough to challenge yourself with these classes and these videos in these challenges and to be able to help others along the way and in girls code that's what we really try to create a positive environment for a woman to work together um alongside a lot of guys to be able to bridge that gender gap and to help young woman prosper and really find that stem can be creative that it can be an amazing field and that is not just for guys last quote by our president obama one of the things that i really strongly believe in is that we need to have more girls interested in math science and engineering we've got half the population that is way underrepresented in those fields and that means that we've got a whole bunch of talent not being encouraged the way they need to and he's right when half of the population are girls there's so much talent hidden in there that we haven't unlocked that we haven't used and that's really terrible because in order to make the most progress in order for our world to be the best that it can be we have to all work together and having half the population represented by the while the other one is suppressed is not a good idea because then we only get half the progress and half the amazing achievements that we could have well thank you for listening everyone i hope you enjoyed this presentation on the history of woman in stem feel free to um let us know in the comments who is a woman that inspires you and to let us know about any suggestions to make our girls code organization more supportive and better and of course make sure to check out our classes and the rest of our stem session videos our web dev class is currently going on and just remember that it is important for you to be in these fields it is important for you to push yourself and to believe in yourself that you can do this and that is the um conclusion to this presentation the summary the most important point is to believe in yourself to that you can do this that you can pursue a field that is largely male dominated and that we can work together in order to create the best world possible thank you for listening everyone
