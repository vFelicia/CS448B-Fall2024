00:00 - all right so hey guys my name is jessica
00:02 - i'll be your teacher for today
00:04 - um i'm a senior cs student
00:08 - at university of maryland so and for
00:11 - this
00:12 - lesson or for this class i would just be
00:14 - like going through the um
00:16 - intro to java just giving you a basic
00:18 - overview
00:19 - of like what this language is about why
00:22 - you should learn java
00:24 - um we won't be doing any programming for
00:26 - today so don't worry
00:28 - about um all of that and
00:32 - let me see oh yeah if you have any
00:34 - questions feel free like if you're
00:36 - comfortable
00:36 - uh and and just like ask away
00:39 - um otherwise you can also just ask in
00:42 - chat and i'll try my best to answer
00:46 - all right so again for today's lesson
00:49 - all we'll really be doing is just
00:52 - going over a basic overview of the
00:54 - course like
00:55 - what you'll be learning and what to
00:56 - expect for this course
00:58 - um next just like what is java why do
01:01 - you want to learn java
01:03 - um finally like setting up our our ide
01:06 - basically we're using reflect for this
01:08 - class so just learning how to make it
01:10 - account
01:11 - and how to like start a java program um
01:14 - finally kind of a workshop more like a
01:17 - demo of
01:18 - like what java looks like um
01:21 - and then tips for learning a programming
01:23 - language and
01:25 - finally any helpful links
01:28 - so first off um just wondering how many
01:31 - of you
01:32 - are um wanting to take like the ap exam
01:44 - all right so basically on this course
01:47 - is sweet so this course is
01:51 - basically following the general ap
01:53 - curriculum
01:54 - um however like if you aren't if you
01:57 - aren't planning to take
01:58 - like the ap exams or you are an ap
02:00 - student don't worry
02:01 - this is still pretty accessible to
02:03 - beginners
02:04 - um and like i said it's designed to
02:07 - basically
02:09 - prep ap students for exams so we'll give
02:12 - you like example
02:13 - um frq and multiple choice questions if
02:16 - you aren't planning to take the ap exams
02:18 - um we do have questions that are geared
02:20 - more for beginners
02:22 - um again it follows the ap csa
02:24 - curriculum
02:25 - um don't worry about like having to be
02:28 - good at math you don't need to be good
02:30 - at math to honestly learn most
02:31 - programming languages
02:33 - unless they're like specifically geared
02:35 - towards math
02:36 - so don't worry about like oh i don't i
02:39 - haven't taken like
02:40 - calculus or anything so can i learn java
02:42 - you can still learn java
02:44 - um in the future we'll try to have
02:46 - separate breakout rooms
02:47 - that are like more specifically for ap
02:50 - review and
02:50 - other breakout rooms are that are geared
02:53 - for beginners
02:54 - um and yeah so
02:57 - the general overview of the course is
02:59 - basically
03:01 - um today is just a basic introduction um
03:04 - eventually you'll learn how to like use
03:06 - objects
03:07 - do you like bullying statements um
03:09 - iteration writing classes
03:12 - um we also have one lesson about arrays
03:15 - and working
03:16 - with the raid list um find the
03:18 - inheritance recursion
03:20 - and then a final project just to show
03:23 - um how much you guys have learned um it
03:26 - seems like a lot but
03:27 - don't worry it's these are all um well
03:30 - we'll try our best to like
03:32 - get you guys to learn it um
03:35 - and yeah that's so
03:40 - first off what is java java is
03:43 - a pretty um pretty old programming
03:46 - language
03:46 - originally developed by sun microsystems
03:49 - and now it's being
03:50 - maintained by this company called oracle
03:53 - um
03:54 - it's it ha it's basically a language
03:57 - that's centered around
03:58 - classes so everything in java is
04:01 - basically a class
04:02 - um we'll exp we'll like get to
04:06 - explaining all this later so don't worry
04:07 - if
04:08 - if you're not too sure about it um and
04:11 - because it's
04:12 - a language that is
04:15 - basically all classes it's super good
04:18 - for learning
04:18 - object-oriented programming and java
04:22 - is kind of like the object-oriented
04:24 - language
04:26 - finally java is a compiled language that
04:28 - runs on a java virtual machine
04:30 - which basically means that um in order
04:33 - to
04:33 - run java on your computer you have to
04:36 - download
04:37 - a compiler called a jvm and there are
04:39 - several different versions out there
04:41 - some are free some are paid but um you
04:44 - have to download one of these
04:45 - to be able to run java um because
04:49 - these like these jbms are basically
04:51 - what's going to translate java
04:53 - into something that the computer can
04:55 - read
04:59 - so next um why learn java java
05:02 - is like i said it's the object-oriented
05:05 - programming language
05:06 - so the most important part of why you
05:08 - should learn java is that
05:11 - it's really good for learning the
05:12 - fundamentals of object-oriented
05:14 - programming
05:15 - and this is like a skill and sort of
05:19 - a concept that you you kind of um
05:22 - have to you kind of need to learn other
05:26 - languages too
05:27 - and on a more practical level java is
05:30 - like used to create a lot of things
05:32 - so like there are games that are created
05:35 - in java
05:36 - if i recall correctly minecraft like
05:38 - just recently
05:40 - um refactored
05:43 - their code base to be in java um you can
05:46 - also even like make
05:47 - make mobile apps so a lot of android
05:49 - apps are actually made in java and
05:52 - there's like so much more like you can
05:54 - make entire programs
05:56 - that are really complex just in java
05:58 - itself
05:59 - and finally it's a great beginner
06:01 - language a lot of college courses
06:03 - actually use java as their sort of intro
06:07 - to programming classes
06:08 - so like for for university of maryland
06:11 - um
06:12 - our first language like my first
06:14 - language was actually java
06:16 - and it's compared to like other
06:18 - languages the concepts
06:20 - and like the sort of the skills you need
06:24 - to learn java
06:25 - are pretty low so and so there's first
06:28 - off there's a little barrier of entry
06:30 - and also um there's a lot of really
06:33 - helpful
06:34 - online um resources that you can
06:36 - basically
06:37 - um use if you learn java
06:42 - so for this class um we
06:45 - have we're using this website called
06:47 - roughlit to basically run all our code
06:50 - on
06:50 - so the reason we're using breathlet is
06:52 - that it's very accessible
06:54 - you don't really need like to download
06:56 - anything
06:57 - to use roughly and also um it's pretty
07:00 - easy to like create an account
07:02 - and act get like all the access to a
07:04 - code finally um
07:06 - all all of our demos will be on roughly
07:09 - so it makes it easier for us to share it
07:11 - with you
07:12 - but um if you want to create code
07:14 - locally there are several
07:16 - different um platforms that i can use to
07:18 - develop java
07:20 - um first off you have like for example
07:21 - you have blue jay um
07:23 - intellij idea or vs code um
07:27 - the really big one or the really big ide
07:30 - is eclipse
07:31 - and you also have nothing um again some
07:34 - of these are free some of these not so
07:36 - free but
07:37 - if you're interested in like in
07:40 - sort of being able to save your code to
07:42 - your disk
07:44 - um these are the ides you can look out
07:46 - for
07:49 - so um for today we aren't really gonna
07:52 - have
07:53 - you um do any coding but i'm gonna show
07:56 - you how to make a breathlet account
07:59 - so first off when you go to reflect
08:00 - you're going to see this
08:02 - um you just click on sign up you can log
08:06 - in through like google
08:07 - github or facebook but in case you don't
08:10 - want to
08:15 - you can just make a username
08:18 - enter your email um
08:26 - is a fake email account but it's okay
08:29 - and then um make a password
08:32 - and then just click sign up any
08:38 - questions
08:43 - all right also like again if you guys
08:46 - have any questions about like
08:47 - what i was talking about earlier um feel
08:49 - free to ask
08:54 - all right so let me log into
08:59 - my real wrestling account
09:02 - or my actual roughly account and then
09:04 - i'll also show you guys how to
09:06 - just make a
09:11 - oh what is an id is
09:14 - is an acronym that stands for integrated
09:17 - development
09:18 - environment so it's basically um
09:21 - an app that or a desktop application
09:25 - that allows you to create code so um
09:29 - for example eclipse will
09:32 - allow you to like open a file and
09:35 - basically like
09:36 - create your own java program in like
09:39 - on your own computer instead of like
09:41 - online
09:42 - so you can think about it sort of like
09:45 - um
09:45 - sort of like microsoft word or like
09:47 - microsoft office but for like coding
09:52 - yep so now
09:56 - i'm just going to share my screen again
10:02 - see so now i'm in my own roughly account
10:06 - so if you ever want to create code you
10:08 - can just go to create
10:10 - um sorry click this
10:13 - um plus button you can choose like java
10:16 - i'm going to call this
10:20 - java app
10:23 - press enter and it'll open sort of
10:26 - environment like this
10:28 - where um on the left hand side you have
10:30 - your files on the right this
10:32 - is sort of like where everything will
10:35 - print
10:36 - so this first program
10:40 - is just the hello world program um
10:43 - again like i said java is always like
10:47 - everything in java is a class so even
10:50 - your main function
10:51 - is sort of wrapped in the class called
10:53 - name and in java
10:55 - um you have this really long name
10:57 - function that
10:58 - will explain like what all this means
11:00 - later but right now
11:01 - the main function is public sac boy main
11:04 - string arts
11:06 - and um this is sort of where your
11:08 - program starts
11:10 - so what this program will do is it will
11:12 - just
11:13 - print out hello world and you can test
11:16 - it by clicking run
11:18 - um java will first compile
11:21 - and then after a few seconds
11:24 - it should print out hello world
11:28 - and then over here you have files you
11:30 - can even um
11:31 - like download packages which is pretty
11:33 - cool for roughly
11:35 - and then finally um so for this course
11:39 - we'll be sharing a lot of demo code and
11:42 - just a very important heads up so
11:45 - basically
11:46 - um whenever we share
11:49 - code and you sort of want to put like
11:50 - play with it or change it
11:52 - make sure um you press you click
11:56 - fork before you um do anything with code
12:00 - so um basically
12:03 - make sure you always fork before you
12:06 - like edit any devil code
12:08 - any um questions about that
12:16 - all right
12:23 - so um
12:28 - let me just do this and
12:31 - get back to the presentation
12:37 - so finally i'll just be going over
12:40 - like some tips that i have for just
12:43 - learning a programming language so and
12:47 - um
12:48 - basically in college like you have to
12:51 - it's like in programming in general so
12:54 - what does fourth do
12:56 - fork is basically um it
12:59 - basically will create your own copy of
13:01 - the code
13:02 - so um if i give you like a demo link and
13:06 - you look at it it's sort of like it's
13:08 - kind of like um
13:09 - google docs where we're sort of looking
13:12 - at the same thing
13:13 - so um the issue if you don't work before
13:16 - you change code
13:17 - is like i'll be like doing a demo or
13:19 - something and then
13:21 - if you like delete a line then it'll
13:23 - happen to my code too
13:25 - which can cause a lot of problems or
13:27 - like for example
13:29 - um another teacher might um change
13:32 - the code while i'm typing which will be
13:35 - an issue
13:36 - so basically um what
13:40 - like you should work before you change
13:42 - code so that um
13:44 - anything you change on your side won't
13:46 - um show up on my side
13:48 - so yeah yep
13:52 - um i'm moving on so just like some tips
13:56 - for learning languages
13:57 - um first off practice
14:00 - so um always like
14:04 - when we're we're like going through
14:06 - demos um
14:08 - just play with the code um don't be
14:10 - afraid of breaking anything
14:12 - um so make sure like first off
14:15 - whenever i'm doing demos you know how
14:17 - that code works
14:19 - um second off learn how to start like
14:21 - making your own programs
14:23 - so um fork all the demos and then you
14:27 - can even just like
14:28 - make little changes see what happens
14:31 - um second off google is your friend um
14:35 - don't be afraid of like oh is this
14:37 - cheating or like i can't copy code
14:40 - um just like don't be afraid
14:44 - of just copying other people's code um
14:46 - if you have like if you're running into
14:48 - issues
14:48 - google first um hopefully
14:52 - like especially with java there's really
14:54 - good online support
14:56 - so um if you have an error probably
14:58 - someone else
14:59 - has like has already had that error
15:01 - before and um
15:03 - someone has a solution for it um just
15:06 - like be careful when you're copying code
15:08 - because
15:09 - um don't just copy and paste blindly
15:12 - without understanding
15:13 - what's going on in that code what i find
15:15 - really helpful
15:16 - is that whenever i'm like i see
15:19 - someone's code online and i want to use
15:20 - it
15:21 - i don't just ctrl c ctrl v and call it a
15:24 - i'll actually type it out and just go
15:27 - through their code
15:28 - and try to understand like what's going
15:30 - on and why they like
15:31 - made these decisions um first off like
15:34 - not everyone's code online is perfect
15:36 - there might be some bugs that you can
15:38 - catch and second off
15:40 - it's sort of a learning experience for
15:41 - you so like you can see
15:44 - sort of someone else's logic of why they
15:46 - need code
15:47 - this way um second off this is more of a
15:51 - test taking
15:52 - tip so pay attention to details um
15:56 - i wouldn't call like a lot of questions
15:59 - on exams or trick questions
16:01 - but um there's like a certain logic
16:05 - behind um behind
16:08 - certain pieces of code and if you don't
16:11 - pay attention to small details you might
16:13 - get tripped up
16:15 - um lastly diagrams are very helpful so
16:18 - um when eventually we'll be learning
16:21 - things like
16:22 - about classes subclasses and inheritance
16:25 - um
16:26 - and it's always very helpful to draw
16:27 - class diagrams
16:29 - this is very important especially when
16:31 - we get to like
16:32 - more complex topics like inheritance and
16:35 - polymorphism and stuff like that
16:37 - um that way like that it just allows you
16:41 - to sort of organize everything visually
16:46 - and then finally i'll be posting all
16:47 - these links in chat so don't
16:49 - don't worry about like having these
16:50 - screenshots or anything um
16:52 - these are just a list of resources that
16:55 - we've compiled that
16:57 - um that are things you can refer to to
17:00 - sort of
17:01 - help you learn java first off is
17:04 - geeksforgeeks which is a really good
17:06 - tutorial site
17:07 - and they have really extensive like
17:10 - articles about anything you want to
17:11 - learn in java
17:13 - um second is just a youtube channel with
17:16 - java tutorials um
17:18 - yeah i also have like the college board
17:20 - csa um playlist
17:23 - w3school is kind of like geeks for geeks
17:26 - where it's a bunch of java tutorials
17:28 - um finally like if you want to apply
17:31 - like everything we learned here hacker
17:34 - rank is pretty good
17:35 - for um just doing practice problems also
17:38 - like hacker rank
17:39 - gives you um sort of example interview
17:42 - questions that you might
17:43 - see um when you're trying to like get a
17:46 - job
17:46 - in programming and then also for ap
17:49 - students
17:49 - there's also like whole bunch of
17:51 - examples of frqs and multiple choice
17:58 - questions
18:01 - so any questions about what we just
18:03 - talked about
18:05 - or like anything job related to be
18:07 - honest
18:12 - sweet so oh also
18:15 - i'm gonna first just drop the a discord
18:18 - invite to the girls coded discord
18:20 - that way um if you guys have any
18:22 - questions like outside of class
18:25 - or like uh just about anything
18:28 - um you can just ask us directly on
18:31 - discord
18:32 - so can you tell us some ways people use
18:35 - it
18:35 - applications so um
18:38 - an example of a java application
18:42 - like if you're familiar with minecraft
18:45 - that the entire like people have
18:48 - minecraft is basically coded
18:50 - in java um also
18:54 - a lot of android apps are also in java
18:57 - so
18:57 - um for example
19:00 - i did like uh i did an
19:03 - android app that would basically
19:05 - recognize like facial expressions
19:07 - using computer vision and machine
19:09 - learning and
19:10 - it'll like put an emoji like if you're
19:12 - smiling you'll put a smiling emoji or if
19:14 - you're frowning you'll put an angry
19:16 - emoji
19:17 - um that was all in java
19:20 - um other ways so
19:23 - java has a really strong um
19:26 - uh graphic ui library so like people
19:30 - will make like
19:31 - a lot of people a lot of companies will
19:32 - actually make like internal tools using
19:35 - java so um for example my parents
19:38 - are both computer programmers and they
19:41 - just use java to make a bunch of web
19:43 - apps
19:43 - and and that sort of stuff
19:47 - um and let me think if i'm missing
19:52 - anything else
19:53 - but that's mostly it like it's
19:57 - mostly used for like a lot of internal
19:59 - schools for companies
20:00 - um android development
20:03 - is both in java and kotlin um
20:07 - also yeah and even like games like
20:11 - minecraft
20:13 - do you need to know javascript to know
20:15 - java
20:16 - no you don't need like any you don't
20:19 - need to know any other language you know
20:21 - java
20:22 - and that's actually like what's so great
20:24 - about java is that like
20:26 - you don't need any uh like prior
20:28 - programming experience or anything
20:30 - to learn be able to learn java i would
20:33 - actually say that you need to know
20:34 - a little bit of java to know javascript
20:37 - because javascript is a scripting
20:39 - language that's based on java
20:42 - so i would say like more like the other
20:44 - way around than like
20:52 - and then i'm gonna start dropping the
20:55 - um resources links in chat um
20:58 - feel free to like just ask any questions
21:02 - or or like any of that while i'm
21:06 - dropping these all right oh yeah finally
21:09 - um
21:11 - for this class we also have a feedback
21:14 - board
21:16 - that it's like if you want to fill out
21:19 - it's really important that like me and
21:22 - like the rest of teachers know like
21:23 - how we're doing so that we can sort of
21:26 - adjust our teaching styles so that you
21:28 - can learn the most
21:30 - so please fill out the um feedback form
21:32 - otherwise
21:33 - um let me just show this
21:40 - otherwise we also have um a website
21:44 - girlsquoted.org
21:48 - and we also have um if you have any
21:50 - questions that you want to email to us

Cleaned transcript:

all right so hey guys my name is jessica i'll be your teacher for today um i'm a senior cs student at university of maryland so and for this lesson or for this class i would just be like going through the um intro to java just giving you a basic overview of like what this language is about why you should learn java um we won't be doing any programming for today so don't worry about um all of that and let me see oh yeah if you have any questions feel free like if you're comfortable uh and and just like ask away um otherwise you can also just ask in chat and i'll try my best to answer all right so again for today's lesson all we'll really be doing is just going over a basic overview of the course like what you'll be learning and what to expect for this course um next just like what is java why do you want to learn java um finally like setting up our our ide basically we're using reflect for this class so just learning how to make it account and how to like start a java program um finally kind of a workshop more like a demo of like what java looks like um and then tips for learning a programming language and finally any helpful links so first off um just wondering how many of you are um wanting to take like the ap exam all right so basically on this course is sweet so this course is basically following the general ap curriculum um however like if you aren't if you aren't planning to take like the ap exams or you are an ap student don't worry this is still pretty accessible to beginners um and like i said it's designed to basically prep ap students for exams so we'll give you like example um frq and multiple choice questions if you aren't planning to take the ap exams um we do have questions that are geared more for beginners um again it follows the ap csa curriculum um don't worry about like having to be good at math you don't need to be good at math to honestly learn most programming languages unless they're like specifically geared towards math so don't worry about like oh i don't i haven't taken like calculus or anything so can i learn java you can still learn java um in the future we'll try to have separate breakout rooms that are like more specifically for ap review and other breakout rooms are that are geared for beginners um and yeah so the general overview of the course is basically um today is just a basic introduction um eventually you'll learn how to like use objects do you like bullying statements um iteration writing classes um we also have one lesson about arrays and working with the raid list um find the inheritance recursion and then a final project just to show um how much you guys have learned um it seems like a lot but don't worry it's these are all um well we'll try our best to like get you guys to learn it um and yeah that's so first off what is java java is a pretty um pretty old programming language originally developed by sun microsystems and now it's being maintained by this company called oracle um it's it ha it's basically a language that's centered around classes so everything in java is basically a class um we'll exp we'll like get to explaining all this later so don't worry if if you're not too sure about it um and because it's a language that is basically all classes it's super good for learning objectoriented programming and java is kind of like the objectoriented language finally java is a compiled language that runs on a java virtual machine which basically means that um in order to run java on your computer you have to download a compiler called a jvm and there are several different versions out there some are free some are paid but um you have to download one of these to be able to run java um because these like these jbms are basically what's going to translate java into something that the computer can read so next um why learn java java is like i said it's the objectoriented programming language so the most important part of why you should learn java is that it's really good for learning the fundamentals of objectoriented programming and this is like a skill and sort of a concept that you you kind of um have to you kind of need to learn other languages too and on a more practical level java is like used to create a lot of things so like there are games that are created in java if i recall correctly minecraft like just recently um refactored their code base to be in java um you can also even like make make mobile apps so a lot of android apps are actually made in java and there's like so much more like you can make entire programs that are really complex just in java itself and finally it's a great beginner language a lot of college courses actually use java as their sort of intro to programming classes so like for for university of maryland um our first language like my first language was actually java and it's compared to like other languages the concepts and like the sort of the skills you need to learn java are pretty low so and so there's first off there's a little barrier of entry and also um there's a lot of really helpful online um resources that you can basically um use if you learn java so for this class um we have we're using this website called roughlit to basically run all our code on so the reason we're using breathlet is that it's very accessible you don't really need like to download anything to use roughly and also um it's pretty easy to like create an account and act get like all the access to a code finally um all all of our demos will be on roughly so it makes it easier for us to share it with you but um if you want to create code locally there are several different um platforms that i can use to develop java um first off you have like for example you have blue jay um intellij idea or vs code um the really big one or the really big ide is eclipse and you also have nothing um again some of these are free some of these not so free but if you're interested in like in sort of being able to save your code to your disk um these are the ides you can look out for so um for today we aren't really gonna have you um do any coding but i'm gonna show you how to make a breathlet account so first off when you go to reflect you're going to see this um you just click on sign up you can log in through like google github or facebook but in case you don't want to you can just make a username enter your email um is a fake email account but it's okay and then um make a password and then just click sign up any questions all right also like again if you guys have any questions about like what i was talking about earlier um feel free to ask all right so let me log into my real wrestling account or my actual roughly account and then i'll also show you guys how to just make a oh what is an id is is an acronym that stands for integrated development environment so it's basically um an app that or a desktop application that allows you to create code so um for example eclipse will allow you to like open a file and basically like create your own java program in like on your own computer instead of like online so you can think about it sort of like um sort of like microsoft word or like microsoft office but for like coding yep so now i'm just going to share my screen again see so now i'm in my own roughly account so if you ever want to create code you can just go to create um sorry click this um plus button you can choose like java i'm going to call this java app press enter and it'll open sort of environment like this where um on the left hand side you have your files on the right this is sort of like where everything will print so this first program is just the hello world program um again like i said java is always like everything in java is a class so even your main function is sort of wrapped in the class called name and in java um you have this really long name function that will explain like what all this means later but right now the main function is public sac boy main string arts and um this is sort of where your program starts so what this program will do is it will just print out hello world and you can test it by clicking run um java will first compile and then after a few seconds it should print out hello world and then over here you have files you can even um like download packages which is pretty cool for roughly and then finally um so for this course we'll be sharing a lot of demo code and just a very important heads up so basically um whenever we share code and you sort of want to put like play with it or change it make sure um you press you click fork before you um do anything with code so um basically make sure you always fork before you like edit any devil code any um questions about that all right so um let me just do this and get back to the presentation so finally i'll just be going over like some tips that i have for just learning a programming language so and um basically in college like you have to it's like in programming in general so what does fourth do fork is basically um it basically will create your own copy of the code so um if i give you like a demo link and you look at it it's sort of like it's kind of like um google docs where we're sort of looking at the same thing so um the issue if you don't work before you change code is like i'll be like doing a demo or something and then if you like delete a line then it'll happen to my code too which can cause a lot of problems or like for example um another teacher might um change the code while i'm typing which will be an issue so basically um what like you should work before you change code so that um anything you change on your side won't um show up on my side so yeah yep um i'm moving on so just like some tips for learning languages um first off practice so um always like when we're we're like going through demos um just play with the code um don't be afraid of breaking anything um so make sure like first off whenever i'm doing demos you know how that code works um second off learn how to start like making your own programs so um fork all the demos and then you can even just like make little changes see what happens um second off google is your friend um don't be afraid of like oh is this cheating or like i can't copy code um just like don't be afraid of just copying other people's code um if you have like if you're running into issues google first um hopefully like especially with java there's really good online support so um if you have an error probably someone else has like has already had that error before and um someone has a solution for it um just like be careful when you're copying code because um don't just copy and paste blindly without understanding what's going on in that code what i find really helpful is that whenever i'm like i see someone's code online and i want to use it i don't just ctrl c ctrl v and call it a i'll actually type it out and just go through their code and try to understand like what's going on and why they like made these decisions um first off like not everyone's code online is perfect there might be some bugs that you can catch and second off it's sort of a learning experience for you so like you can see sort of someone else's logic of why they need code this way um second off this is more of a test taking tip so pay attention to details um i wouldn't call like a lot of questions on exams or trick questions but um there's like a certain logic behind um behind certain pieces of code and if you don't pay attention to small details you might get tripped up um lastly diagrams are very helpful so um when eventually we'll be learning things like about classes subclasses and inheritance um and it's always very helpful to draw class diagrams this is very important especially when we get to like more complex topics like inheritance and polymorphism and stuff like that um that way like that it just allows you to sort of organize everything visually and then finally i'll be posting all these links in chat so don't don't worry about like having these screenshots or anything um these are just a list of resources that we've compiled that um that are things you can refer to to sort of help you learn java first off is geeksforgeeks which is a really good tutorial site and they have really extensive like articles about anything you want to learn in java um second is just a youtube channel with java tutorials um yeah i also have like the college board csa um playlist w3school is kind of like geeks for geeks where it's a bunch of java tutorials um finally like if you want to apply like everything we learned here hacker rank is pretty good for um just doing practice problems also like hacker rank gives you um sort of example interview questions that you might see um when you're trying to like get a job in programming and then also for ap students there's also like whole bunch of examples of frqs and multiple choice questions so any questions about what we just talked about or like anything job related to be honest sweet so oh also i'm gonna first just drop the a discord invite to the girls coded discord that way um if you guys have any questions like outside of class or like uh just about anything um you can just ask us directly on discord so can you tell us some ways people use it applications so um an example of a java application like if you're familiar with minecraft that the entire like people have minecraft is basically coded in java um also a lot of android apps are also in java so um for example i did like uh i did an android app that would basically recognize like facial expressions using computer vision and machine learning and it'll like put an emoji like if you're smiling you'll put a smiling emoji or if you're frowning you'll put an angry emoji um that was all in java um other ways so java has a really strong um uh graphic ui library so like people will make like a lot of people a lot of companies will actually make like internal tools using java so um for example my parents are both computer programmers and they just use java to make a bunch of web apps and and that sort of stuff um and let me think if i'm missing anything else but that's mostly it like it's mostly used for like a lot of internal schools for companies um android development is both in java and kotlin um also yeah and even like games like minecraft do you need to know javascript to know java no you don't need like any you don't need to know any other language you know java and that's actually like what's so great about java is that like you don't need any uh like prior programming experience or anything to learn be able to learn java i would actually say that you need to know a little bit of java to know javascript because javascript is a scripting language that's based on java so i would say like more like the other way around than like and then i'm gonna start dropping the um resources links in chat um feel free to like just ask any questions or or like any of that while i'm dropping these all right oh yeah finally um for this class we also have a feedback board that it's like if you want to fill out it's really important that like me and like the rest of teachers know like how we're doing so that we can sort of adjust our teaching styles so that you can learn the most so please fill out the um feedback form otherwise um let me just show this otherwise we also have um a website girlsquoted.org and we also have um if you have any questions that you want to email to us we we're available at education girlscoded.org we also have the instagram girl's code at pb and then i'll drop the um the discord i can drop the discord invite again um i if i run correctly we'll also be posting slides on discord which is why you should um i should join also um if you want to talk to me directly um i can also drop my butt otherwise that's kind of it for our lesson today thank you so much for um for coming
