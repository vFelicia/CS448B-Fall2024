With timestamps:

00:00 - joining me in this saturday noon time
00:03 - afternoon time i really appreciate you
00:05 - all coming
00:06 - so my name is wen i'm currently a rising
00:09 - senior studying computer science at the
00:11 - university of washington seattle
00:12 - um and i have been doing a couple of
00:16 - internships throughout my college times
00:18 - uh right now i'm currently a software
00:21 - engineering intern at cloudflare
00:23 - doing a remote internship because of
00:25 - covet and last summer i've been a ux
00:28 - engineering intern at microsoft
00:30 - and someone before i was a new
00:32 - technologist participant
00:34 - and after graduating from high school i
00:36 - also
00:37 - was a high school intern at autodesk as
00:40 - a software engineering intern
00:42 - and i can i'm pretty happy to like go a
00:44 - little bit deeper
00:45 - into each of these experience uh when we
00:48 - get to our question later
00:49 - um and other than my internship
00:51 - positions i'm also currently
00:53 - a head teaching assistant for one of the
00:56 - data programming classes at my school
00:58 - and i'm also rewriting the code fellow
01:00 - which is like a college women community
01:02 - in tech
01:04 - but yeah that's basically about me and
01:07 - i'm happy to answer questions
01:09 - yeah thank you so much and thank you for
01:11 - being here today um
01:12 - we'll get started on our first question
01:15 - which is
01:15 - what inspired you to pursue computer
01:18 - science
01:19 - yeah this is a good question so um just
01:22 - a little bit more background about me so
01:25 - i moved i actually moved
01:26 - uh here to the us from china five years
01:29 - ago
01:30 - with my parents so before i move here i
01:33 - actually have zero exposure to
01:35 - programming
01:36 - so um and then like i just have a free
01:40 - summer after i move
01:41 - because like in china there's a lot of
01:43 - homework so i don't really have free
01:45 - time to kind of explore what i want to
01:46 - do
01:47 - so i have a free summer after i move and
01:49 - then i started playing a lot of video
01:50 - games and
01:51 - i started watching a video on how video
01:54 - games are made
01:55 - and then it just really fascinates me on
01:57 - how like the programmers
01:58 - actually like encode all those logic
02:00 - into like video games
02:02 - uh with coding so um that just like kind
02:06 - of intrigued my interest
02:07 - in like coding in general and after i
02:10 - started high school here i also got
02:12 - involved in the first robotic
02:13 - competition
02:14 - and joined the programming team in the
02:17 - robotics team
02:18 - high school the first the moment that i
02:22 - really
02:22 - feel like uh cs is something that
02:24 - excites me is when i wrote a for loop
02:27 - that actually makes like fancy led
02:29 - patterns
02:30 - because for me it is like the first time
02:33 - that i actually see the power of how
02:35 - like you can
02:36 - make real things happen with code um
02:39 - and then after that i just uh do a lot
02:42 - of like
02:43 - digging around and exploring a lot of
02:44 - resources and kind of
02:46 - learn uh programming in my own time i
02:48 - also took an intro
02:50 - to programming class when i was doing a
02:52 - high school summer college program at
02:54 - stanford
02:55 - and that kind of gives me a little bit
02:57 - more theoretical background
02:58 - and actually learned how to think like a
03:01 - programmer
03:02 - and later i just like get a lot more
03:04 - involved into like my programming team
03:07 - um during my senior year of high school
03:09 - and i really
03:10 - enjoy the pro problem solving process
03:12 - and also finding out what's broken
03:15 - um and that kind of gives me a really
03:17 - solid
03:18 - idea of like i want to pursue a cs major
03:21 - in college
03:22 - yeah that's basically a story wow that's
03:24 - really interesting um
03:26 - could i actually ask you um which game
03:29 - really inspired you to start coding and
03:31 - like what language
03:32 - you started off with from your
03:36 - yeah so the game um
03:39 - that kind of intrigues me is actually
03:41 - assassin's creed uh maybe some of you
03:43 - know the series but i'm really a big fan
03:46 - of like the earlier assassin's creed
03:47 - series
03:48 - um and then i played them a lot but then
03:51 - when i actually started
03:52 - coding video games is i
03:56 - i actually took a video games
03:57 - programming class at my high school
03:59 - and the tool they use is called digipen
04:02 - so it's more like a drag and drop where
04:04 - you can feel like the
04:05 - interface but you can also integrate
04:08 - really
04:08 - simple code and i'm not sure what the
04:10 - language is i'm not thinking about it
04:13 - but after that i also tried to code
04:17 - video games in unity which is a game
04:20 - engine
04:21 - where you can use like c-sharp with as a
04:24 - language to build video games
04:26 - and it's a really cool engine too
04:30 - okay thank you so much um we'll be
04:32 - moving to our second question now
04:34 - um which is oops
04:38 - do you have any advice for aspiring
04:40 - students in the tech field
04:43 - yeah i guess my biggest advice is
04:45 - definitely
04:46 - do what excites you like for me
04:50 - uh what gets me excited about computer
04:53 - science the first place
04:54 - is video games so even though right now
04:57 - i am shifting more towards like web
04:59 - development and
05:00 - app development just uh like try to
05:03 - figure out what's the best
05:04 - how to create like the best experience
05:06 - for my users um
05:08 - my initial like entry point is video
05:10 - games
05:11 - so definitely if you're interested in
05:13 - building something just start finding
05:15 - resources
05:16 - and there's tons of online resources now
05:19 - nowadays available
05:20 - like their free coursera courses and all
05:24 - those like
05:24 - medium articles people like just write
05:26 - up and just show you how they make their
05:29 - own app
05:30 - so if you're interested in any of those
05:31 - just start like
05:33 - reaching out on those online resources
05:36 - and start looking into it
05:38 - because um you don't want to start up
05:41 - with something that is
05:42 - kind of boring because that will never
05:44 - carry you far
05:46 - that's basically my biggest advice
05:50 - okay um do you have any like
05:53 - recommendations or like places that you
05:55 - think
05:55 - people should start off with like
05:58 - something that they should do to start
06:00 - off with before they
06:01 - you know try to get into their tech
06:03 - field
06:05 - um so i guess
06:08 - uh my advice is to if your school is
06:12 - offering like cs classes
06:14 - um definitely take those classes
06:18 - because it's really like
06:21 - learning cs or programming is like
06:23 - really crucial that you kind of like
06:26 - in the mindset of how to program uh it's
06:29 - not
06:29 - it's something that you kind of need
06:31 - some uh prior training
06:33 - on in order to get into it but um
06:36 - it's not like uh so i would say like
06:40 - programming is not something that have a
06:42 - really high bar entry like when i was in
06:44 - china i always
06:45 - thought that you need to be really smart
06:47 - you need to be really good at math in
06:49 - order to
06:49 - get really good at coding but uh it's
06:52 - not true because like once i
06:54 - get really excited about something i
06:56 - decide to make up my mind to build it
06:58 - i can like look up resources and start
07:00 - like
07:01 - realizing my own idea and creativity in
07:05 - through programming and through that
07:07 - that actually kind of helped me practice
07:09 - my logical
07:10 - uh thinking and get get me better at
07:13 - math as well
07:14 - so i would say um definitely
07:18 - start looking at something that
07:20 - interests you and then look at some
07:22 - online tutorials
07:23 - yeah hope that's helpful okay so third
07:28 - question as a woman in the tech field
07:31 - did you experience
07:32 - any gender biases in school or while you
07:35 - were applying for internship positions
07:38 - yeah um so fortunately i didn't actually
07:42 - experience any ex biases that
07:45 - specifically targeted
07:46 - against me in those like ex like when
07:50 - i'm applying for
07:50 - internships or within classes that once
07:54 - you are in like the cs major or once you
07:56 - started doing
07:57 - all those like technical internships you
07:59 - do start to feel that pressure because
08:01 - you kind of look around you and you just
08:04 - see guys everywhere basically
08:06 - so when i was uh when i get into cs
08:10 - at uw it's just really
08:13 - apparent that when you look around the
08:15 - classroom most of the
08:17 - people are guys and you just see a
08:18 - couple of girls gathering around
08:20 - and that is part of the reason why it's
08:22 - super important as like a woman in tech
08:24 - you want to be really good at finding
08:26 - that
08:26 - community and like use
08:30 - the resources shared by that community
08:32 - um
08:33 - and even when i'm currently in my
08:35 - current internship when
08:37 - all the engineering teammates on my team
08:39 - are men but then
08:41 - so it's just you can feel like there's
08:44 - still a gender
08:45 - imbalance in the depth view in the tech
08:48 - view
08:48 - definitely but um the
08:52 - one good thing is that the tech view is
08:54 - kind of
08:55 - striving to gain more diversity when
08:58 - they're
08:58 - hiring in their hiring process so use
09:02 - this type of
09:03 - push to your advantage because um the
09:06 - tech industry is actually looking for
09:08 - more women engineers to join their team
09:11 - because they believe that you can
09:12 - contribute really valuable perspectives
09:15 - and skill sets
09:16 - and there are also a lot of great
09:18 - communities out there to support women
09:20 - for example like this one girls coded i
09:23 - don't think uh
09:25 - guys have this type of organization so
09:27 - definitely make use of these
09:29 - and for me my community is like
09:31 - rewriting a code which is like an
09:33 - online facebook community where people
09:35 - just like sharing
09:36 - resources on how to prepare for
09:38 - interviews how to
09:40 - prepare for internships and things like
09:42 - that those resources just like
09:44 - online so definitely keep an eye out for
09:47 - those communities
09:50 - um do you think like being in a class
09:52 - with women
09:53 - uh like a small amount of you know girls
09:56 - or like
09:56 - woman you think it brought you guys
09:58 - closer together as friends or did you
10:00 - like maybe not talk to them during the
10:02 - year
10:04 - um i think it definitely brought bring
10:06 - us closer
10:07 - as friends um that because like you
10:10 - assure the identity as a woman and kind
10:12 - of
10:12 - kind of like a minority in this field is
10:15 - really
10:16 - when you start like chatting with each
10:18 - other it's really natural that you share
10:19 - that kind of connection
10:21 - uh in terms of like you can like
10:22 - complain about how this just gets
10:24 - everywhere and then you can also talk
10:26 - about
10:27 - some like common experience like how do
10:30 - you overcome the imposter syndrome
10:32 - or overcome that kind of like you don't
10:34 - want to
10:35 - uh you want to kind of like prove
10:38 - yourself to be as good as guys just
10:40 - because you're a minority which is like
10:42 - basically not true but
10:44 - that kind of urge still exists because
10:46 - of like the gender imbalance
10:50 - we're going to move on to our fourth
10:51 - question then thank you for
10:53 - this one um what was the microsoft
10:57 - internship
10:57 - application process like and how did you
11:00 - prepare for your interviews
11:02 - yeah so for the microsoft internship
11:05 - application the traditional route is
11:06 - that you will fill out an
11:08 - online application form where you just
11:10 - fill out some basic information and
11:12 - also upload your resume and if you have
11:14 - a good enough resume uh
11:15 - the recruiters will reach out to you and
11:18 - schedule a phone screen
11:19 - so you you like kind of chat with them
11:22 - uh on some like behavioral questions
11:24 - like tell me about how you
11:27 - work with a team or tell me about your
11:29 - time you have to overcome some obstacles
11:32 - um and after that if you if they still
11:34 - think you're a good fit to a company
11:36 - you move on to like technical interviews
11:39 - um and in this uh i think like the final
11:43 - round of this process is actually on
11:45 - site so you would
11:46 - actually go to like at least in the
11:49 - normal
11:50 - circumstances you will go to the actual
11:52 - microsoft redmond campus
11:54 - um or if you're somewhere uh
11:57 - not in seattle maybe you would go to the
12:00 - other campuses
12:01 - um but then in the raving campus you
12:04 - just go through a whole day of
12:05 - back-to-back
12:06 - interviews and you meet with people in
12:09 - different roles
12:11 - so for my experience is a little bit
12:13 - different from the traditional one just
12:15 - because
12:15 - i have participated in the new
12:17 - technologies program in my
12:19 - in the summer of my freshman year so for
12:22 - those of you who are not familiar with
12:23 - that program
12:24 - is basically a seven-week academy type
12:28 - program
12:28 - where you learn the whole product
12:31 - development cycle
12:32 - from like ideation thinking about what
12:36 - the need of customer is
12:37 - to creating like a mock-up of like the
12:40 - idea
12:41 - or the app that you're trying to build
12:42 - to target the problem statement that you
12:45 - try to solve
12:46 - and finally you work with a team of
12:48 - other college students to kind of build
12:50 - up that app together
12:52 - and that program is kind of designed
12:55 - specifically for
12:56 - freshmen and sophomores so people who
12:58 - don't have a lot of like technical
13:00 - background
13:01 - so it's like so it kind of has a lower
13:05 - expectation
13:06 - in terms of like what what background
13:08 - you want to come in
13:09 - so i was a participant in that program
13:11 - and i have a really great experience
13:13 - and after that i got a referral from a
13:15 - coach in that program
13:17 - and he kind of recommended to me to do
13:19 - this uh
13:20 - ux engineering internship so i kind of
13:23 - skipped the
13:24 - like online application and like the
13:26 - phone screen and i go straight to
13:28 - outside
13:29 - so for my experience um the first
13:33 - like i have around with like engineers
13:36 - just like
13:36 - just asking some whiteboarding questions
13:39 - so you need to actually
13:40 - write down code on the whiteboard when
13:42 - they ask you a question
13:44 - and um that is mostly testing your
13:47 - technical skills
13:48 - and how well you are in terms of like
13:51 - communicating your thought process
13:53 - um i also have interviews with like a
13:56 - project manager
13:57 - and it's mostly like uh testing my
14:00 - design skills like how do i
14:02 - uh create this wireframe and also draw
14:05 - them on the whiteboard
14:07 - and later i have a lunch interview with
14:10 - like a engineering manager
14:11 - and it's mostly him asking a little bit
14:15 - me
14:16 - a little bit about me but mostly is me
14:19 - asking a question to him as well like
14:22 - asking
14:23 - uh why do you work in this team like
14:25 - what kind of intern projects
14:27 - are you expecting me to do for the
14:29 - summer and finally it's more
14:30 - more like uh a final round with um
14:34 - an engineering a design director at
14:37 - microsoft so it's
14:38 - someone who are more higher up and the
14:40 - question she mostly asked me was about
14:43 - like uh where do i see myself in five
14:46 - years and things like that
14:48 - so um because my the role i'm
14:51 - interviewing for is ux engineering so it
14:54 - has kind of a blend between like design
14:56 - and engineering uh if you are going for
14:59 - like
14:59 - software engineering roles you probably
15:02 - will get a lot more like technical
15:04 - focused
15:05 - back-to-back interviews but yeah that's
15:07 - basically
15:08 - my interview experience at microsoft wow
15:12 - that's really interesting and i think
15:15 - that would help a lot of people a lot um
15:17 - just knowing that process
15:19 - um next question
15:22 - is what was your day-to-day life
15:26 - like as a software engineer intern
15:29 - yeah um i guess i can just use my
15:32 - experience
15:33 - right now because uh again i'm a
15:35 - software engineering internet coupler so
15:38 - the project that i'm working on this
15:40 - summer i actually get to collaborate
15:42 - with a
15:43 - project management intern so uh for he
15:47 - so his task is mostly focused on like
15:49 - figuring out the
15:51 - general direction of the product and
15:53 - also like kind of
15:54 - a little bit of like thinking about what
15:56 - our competitors are
15:57 - like what the interface should look like
16:00 - for the product and things like that
16:01 - whereas me is mostly focused on
16:03 - importing that thing
16:05 - um so usually in the morning or in the
16:08 - beginning of the week i will check in
16:09 - with that intern
16:11 - just to kind of clarify like what will
16:14 - be our to-do items for the week and what
16:16 - would be our goals
16:18 - that we want to achieve by the end of
16:19 - the week and then after that is mostly
16:22 - like doing a lot of
16:23 - research on the things that i need to
16:26 - implement
16:27 - and this is the point where googling
16:29 - really comes in handy
16:30 - uh and i would definitely say if you're
16:33 - a good programmer you're definitely a
16:34 - really good googler
16:36 - because you really know how you need to
16:38 - know like how to find the resource you
16:40 - need via googling
16:42 - and even though it uh if you are even if
16:44 - you are like a senior engineer
16:46 - maybe like the besides like the
16:49 - technical experience that you get uh you
16:51 - just like get really good at googling
16:53 - compared to like the junior engineers
16:56 - um so after doing this research of
16:58 - course i need to like start coding and
17:00 - also do a lot of debugging on like the
17:03 - program that i wrote and another aspect
17:06 - is like documentation
17:07 - so after you write down the code you
17:09 - also want to
17:10 - document them and try because that is
17:13 - super important in terms of like
17:15 - uh telling whoever else is reading your
17:18 - code
17:19 - um like how do like what does your code
17:23 - do like how does though how does that
17:25 - work and if you they want to use your
17:27 - code
17:28 - how are they going to use it so
17:30 - documentation is like a
17:31 - super important part in this engineering
17:33 - process just because
17:35 - you want to write code that works but
17:37 - you also want to write code that works
17:39 - for other people
17:40 - as well um and if i get stuck i would
17:43 - like
17:43 - paying my mentor on google chat just
17:46 - asking them for help and then sometimes
17:49 - i also
17:50 - attend like team meetings where i just
17:52 - like kind of report
17:53 - the progress uh throughout the week to
17:56 - the team
17:57 - and there's also like some fireside
18:00 - chats or things like that where the
18:02 - company executives uh
18:04 - get to like uh it's more like a q a with
18:07 - company executives and they're also like
18:09 - social events where you have some
18:11 - interim mixers where you just get to
18:13 - know like
18:14 - other interns within the company so yeah
18:17 - that's
18:17 - basically the day-to-day as a software
18:20 - engineer intern
18:22 - um what would you say is the most fun
18:25 - part of your day as
18:26 - a software engineer intern
18:31 - i would say the best moments are the
18:34 - ones that
18:35 - after debugging for one or two or more
18:39 - hours
18:39 - you finally get it to work like even
18:42 - though the debugging process can be
18:44 - super painful but like the moment that
18:46 - you figure out
18:47 - how to solve the problem is like really
18:49 - amazing and it's basically something
18:51 - that keeps you going even though
18:53 - like you know like the next moment when
18:55 - you start working on something new
18:57 - you're going to start going back to that
18:59 - debugging process again
19:00 - but it just feels really good
19:05 - um okay so we'll start opening up to our
19:08 - audience here for some more questions so
19:11 - um here's an open q a for anyone who
19:14 - wants to ask
19:14 - questions you could type it in the chat
19:17 - if you don't feel comfortable with
19:18 - speaking
19:18 - or you can unmute yourself and um
19:22 - you know ask your questions
19:25 - um sharon from the audience asks in the
19:27 - chat
19:28 - what do you suggest to young girls who
19:30 - are interested in coding
19:31 - um so uh when would you like us to
19:34 - answer that
19:36 - um you mean like
19:40 - uh in terms of the technology
19:43 - or like what exactly
19:46 - i think that suggestion is targeting
19:49 - oh yeah she also asked a more specific
19:52 - questions like what language or
19:53 - activities do you think would help
19:55 - prepare them
19:56 - yeah um so i think python is a really
20:01 - good starter starter language to learn
20:03 - just because the syntax is
20:05 - really easy and um there's also a lot of
20:09 - really
20:09 - great tutorials out there just like
20:12 - helping guiding you out how to
20:13 - code the simple python game for example
20:17 - and that is definitely a good language
20:19 - to pick up in the beginning
20:20 - and even though it's simple it's
20:22 - actually a super powerful language
20:24 - because python is used in like the data
20:26 - analysis fields a lot
20:28 - and a lot of and a lot of people also i
20:31 - think it's like almost like the second
20:33 - most popular
20:34 - programming language nowadays um another
20:37 - the top most popular so far i think is
20:39 - actually java so
20:41 - java is like a more you have stricter
20:45 - syntax
20:47 - in java and there is a little bit
20:50 - of barrier to entry to java but then
20:54 - a lot of good concepts that you learn
20:56 - while you're programming java is
20:58 - actually applicable to other language as
21:00 - well
21:00 - so it's really good to have a really
21:02 - solid foundation in java as well
21:04 - and java is actually the language that i
21:06 - started coding in
21:07 - um but then if you want to make
21:11 - some project that you i can actually see
21:14 - things happening i would recommend
21:16 - like learning html and css just like
21:18 - building up your own website
21:20 - um and you can also learn a little bit
21:22 - about javascript
21:23 - which is actually really different from
21:26 - java even though they seem
21:27 - they sound really similar but then
21:30 - is a programming language for web
21:34 - and you can kind of give more
21:35 - interaction or dynamics to your website
21:40 - but yeah i think those are my
21:43 - recommendations that you can start
21:44 - looking into
21:45 - i know it's a lot but um i say if i have
21:48 - a fake one i'll say go for python
21:50 - but yeah um
21:53 - another audience member asks what are
21:55 - some companies
21:57 - slash organizations that offer high
21:59 - school internships
22:02 - high school internships let's see um
22:06 - like autodesk is the one that i know of
22:09 - just because but it's like a little bit
22:12 - more um
22:13 - regional specific because like i think
22:17 - it only hires
22:18 - like participants in the first robotics
22:21 - competition
22:22 - from the pacific northwest region so
22:25 - it's like super
22:26 - specific um i don't
22:29 - really know of anywhere else
22:32 - at this point um but if you like try to
22:35 - google it i believe you can also find
22:37 - find out some of them as well
22:40 - but yeah um another audience member asks
22:44 - uh how many languages you how many
22:47 - languages did you learn
22:48 - and what order did you learn them in
22:51 - yeah
22:53 - i mean looking back i actually learned a
22:55 - lot of language
22:57 - which is even like okay let me
23:00 - pull up my resume so that i can like
23:03 - read them out um let's see
23:06 - so my first language is java like i
23:10 - mentioned
23:10 - because i use it in my robotics team
23:14 - and it's also the language we use in the
23:16 - intro to programming class i have at my
23:18 - school
23:19 - and then the second language i learned
23:21 - is c sharp so
23:23 - uh c sharp is a language that is used by
23:27 - uh what if you need to develop games in
23:29 - unity c-sharp is an option the other
23:31 - option is the plus plus
23:32 - but that is like a lot more complicated
23:34 - actually
23:36 - c sharp have a really similar syntax to
23:38 - java so if you know java it's very
23:41 - really easy for you to transition to c
23:43 - sharp um
23:44 - and after that i learned swift so swift
23:47 - is a programming language that you can
23:50 - use to
23:51 - code ios apps so if you want to develop
23:53 - mobile
23:54 - mobile apps for apple this is the
23:56 - language that you go for
23:58 - and i learned it during the new
24:00 - technologies program because at that
24:02 - point
24:02 - that program is using script as the
24:05 - language
24:06 - uh for coding up like the app prototypes
24:09 - um and then after that i learned python
24:12 - and html and css and javascript and php
24:16 - and sql
24:16 - actually at the same time so basically
24:18 - what happens
24:19 - is that there are one quarter at my
24:22 - school
24:22 - where i take a web programming class and
24:25 - a data programming class at the same
24:27 - time
24:28 - so what happens at that quarter is
24:30 - actually super chaotic
24:32 - because i learned like six different
24:34 - languages
24:35 - in the web programming class just
24:38 - because you need to use different
24:40 - languages to do different things
24:43 - for when you're building a website
24:46 - whereas
24:47 - uh on the on the other hand i also need
24:49 - to learn python which
24:50 - uh in my data programming class so
24:53 - that was a really cool experience though
24:57 - because like you can as you are like
24:59 - picking up those language and kind of
25:01 - struggling to switch
25:02 - your mindset in between all those
25:04 - different languages
25:05 - you start to see like the commonalities
25:08 - shared between those languages
25:10 - and in fact there's a lot of really
25:12 - fundamental
25:13 - concepts in programming that is uh that
25:16 - is not language specific
25:18 - and as you're learning more and more
25:19 - language you started to see like a
25:21 - common pattern
25:22 - and it also actually helps you to pick
25:24 - up other language really quickly as well
25:25 - because
25:26 - the only thing that is different is um
25:29 - just like remembering what the syntax
25:32 - should be
25:33 - in that different language um and after
25:36 - that i also learned
25:37 - a it's not a language but it's more like
25:40 - a framework called react
25:41 - so react is a really popular web
25:44 - development framework nowadays that
25:45 - a lot of people use and it's built on
25:47 - top of javascript
25:49 - um so if you're interested in web
25:51 - development once you
25:52 - feel like you have a good hang of html
25:54 - css and javascript
25:56 - definitely looking to react because this
25:58 - is a really popular thing that people
26:00 - are using
26:02 - and finally in last quarter of my
26:05 - college i actually
26:06 - learned another language which is c plus
26:09 - and actually c
26:10 - so c and c plus plus are a lot kind of
26:13 - like lower level language
26:14 - in the sense that uh those language you
26:17 - are able to interact directly
26:19 - with like the hardware of the computer
26:22 - so it's not something that as fancy as
26:26 - html css as
26:27 - in the sense that you can build like a
26:29 - front end or like the interface that you
26:32 - can see
26:33 - but it's like those languages are really
26:35 - efficient
26:36 - in a sense that because they are built
26:39 - um with like with
26:43 - because like they're designed for
26:45 - building really
26:46 - powerful and efficient um applications
26:49 - um yeah so like i know this
26:53 - is a lot uh but then i think in the
26:55 - future as i move on to
26:57 - my actual full-time job or pick up more
26:59 - internship i would definitely learn
27:01 - a lot more languages um but it's just
27:04 - like the life of a software engineer
27:06 - you just need to be really good at
27:08 - picking up new skills and just keep
27:10 - learning
27:12 - great um we have another question um
27:15 - do you suggest any online resources for
27:18 - learning python or any other
27:20 - language um
27:23 - i see online resources
27:29 - so coursera probably
27:32 - have some really cool classes
27:36 - let's see
27:40 - so yeah but it's like
27:44 - let me send a link to the chat so
27:47 - i think coursera has some like free
27:49 - classes
27:50 - uh that you can look into and then unity
27:55 - if you're interested in like game
27:56 - development or just like
27:58 - some um just like interested in
28:02 - starting from building games you can
28:05 - uh look into unity
28:09 - which is this one
28:13 - um this is a link to like the unity so
28:15 - the good thing about starting with unity
28:18 - when you're building things is that they
28:19 - have really good documentation on
28:21 - everything so
28:22 - they have a lot of really cool tutorials
28:24 - that can like kind of guide you through
28:27 - every single step um but yeah this is
28:30 - like the
28:31 - tuesday that i have in mind right now
28:33 - but i guess i can also follow up if i
28:35 - come up with more resources later
28:38 - yeah just a quick shameless self promo
28:40 - we are um our organization is
28:43 - offering um python java and web
28:45 - development courses soon
28:47 - so i'll keep on look out for that we
28:49 - have an
28:50 - another question saying recommendations
28:53 - slash best resources for preparing for
28:56 - technical interviews
28:59 - yes um so i think for high school it
29:03 - might be a little bit early to mention
29:04 - this but
29:05 - um for so usually when people are
29:09 - preparing for technical interviews they
29:12 - use a resource called
29:14 - colleague code
29:17 - and leak code is one that is like super
29:20 - popular and the other one
29:22 - is hacker rank so basically
29:26 - uh for these two sites they kind of have
29:29 - a really similar
29:30 - um purpose of like they just have a lot
29:33 - of like those
29:34 - different algorithm problems um and they
29:37 - would like kind of show you the problem
29:39 - statement and you need to basically call
29:41 - up a solution
29:42 - to kind of solve those problems and they
29:44 - also have all those different test case
29:46 - that you can run so after you pull up
29:49 - the solution you can like test if that
29:51 - solution works or not
29:52 - um but then i guess uh if you
29:56 - for high school students this might be a
29:58 - higher bar
30:00 - of entry just because it would be
30:04 - you need to basically most of the
30:06 - question on there you need to basically
30:08 - have taken like the first data
30:10 - structures and algorithm class
30:12 - in college um to have that kind of
30:14 - theoretical background for you to
30:16 - be more comfortable in terms of like um
30:19 - practicing the actual problems on there
30:22 - and
30:23 - um the other book that a lot of people
30:26 - recommend
30:28 - for a coding interview is just uh
30:30 - something called cracking the coding
30:32 - interview you can google the book
30:34 - and it basically is a book that kind of
30:38 - walks you through the different aspects
30:39 - of like technical interview
30:41 - and um also like talk about some like
30:44 - basic concepts on the data structure
30:46 - but i would definitely say don't jump
30:49 - too fast into those resources because
30:52 - it's really
30:53 - easy to get discouraged if you don't
30:56 - have like the
30:57 - theoretical background coming into
30:59 - solving those questions
31:00 - um but yeah great uh we have another
31:05 - question
31:06 - um what coding language is the best to
31:08 - create a game
31:11 - um it depends a lot on what kind of game
31:14 - that you want to create
31:16 - um c plus plus is a language
31:20 - that a lot of popular game engines
31:23 - uh use just because um
31:27 - like i said before c plus plus is a
31:29 - language designed for
31:30 - building really fast and efficient uh
31:33 - games
31:33 - and you if you are a gamer you can
31:35 - imagine that people don't really like to
31:37 - have their games to lag
31:39 - a lot or just like have you need to wait
31:42 - a long time for the game to load etc
31:44 - and that's why a lot of uh game
31:46 - developers use the plus plus to kind of
31:49 - like build up their
31:51 - game uh to make them as performant as
31:54 - possible
31:55 - um but then c sharp is like
31:58 - c sharpness like c with like a pound
32:01 - sign
32:02 - um so c sharp is a language that unity
32:04 - use
32:05 - um and actually unity provides both
32:07 - options you can either code in c
32:08 - sharp or c plus plus and c sharp
32:10 - definitely have better
32:12 - uh better syntax and this is like
32:15 - a little bit less complicated than c
32:17 - plus plus to pick up
32:18 - but yeah that's the two that i can think
32:20 - of right now
32:22 - but i think um a lot of other i think
32:25 - javascript
32:26 - uh there a lot of people also building
32:28 - up javascript games
32:29 - just like you can run it on a website
32:31 - and it's also something that people use
32:34 - okay uh we have another question um what
32:37 - grade did you start learning programming
32:40 - um i started at grade 11
32:44 - so after because i moved to the u.s at
32:46 - grade 11
32:47 - this is uh where i start picking up um
32:50 - coding and yeah i would say
32:54 - like the if i have to say the real
32:58 - the learning like hardcore programming
33:01 - uh it's like at the it's more like the
33:04 - freshman year of my college or
33:06 - sophomore year because um when you
33:09 - started to take data structures class
33:12 - is like where you actually get into like
33:14 - the
33:15 - best side of the cs that's how you can
33:18 - describe so yeah
33:22 - um we have another question uh what kind
33:24 - of side projects do you think helped you
33:26 - on your internship
33:29 - um so i actually didn't do a lot of side
33:32 - projects
33:33 - coming into my internship just because
33:36 - um
33:36 - school is really busy so um
33:40 - for me i i don't think
33:43 - any of my side projects would be really
33:47 - like is something that gets me to those
33:49 - internships but
33:50 - um what i really focus on uh
33:54 - on the other side is actually being a
33:56 - teaching assistant
33:57 - so i am a head teaching assistant for a
34:00 - data programming class
34:01 - at my school and um the nice thing about
34:05 - being a teaching
34:06 - assistant and i would definitely
34:07 - recommend uh any
34:09 - every one of you um
34:12 - yeah if you're interested in being a
34:14 - teaching uh in college you should
34:16 - definitely explore the opportunity of
34:18 - being a teaching assistant just because
34:20 - um
34:21 - it helps you to kind of practice public
34:23 - speaking and also
34:25 - explain your thought process and because
34:26 - you're teaching you're also learning the
34:28 - concepts in cs better
34:30 - and it helps you to prepare for coding
34:31 - interview as well so yeah
34:34 - okay uh we have a really good question
34:36 - um they're saying i'm really interested
34:38 - in coding but i'm afraid of giving up in
34:40 - the middle of my progress
34:41 - is there any tip for overcoming it
34:45 - um i think i would just circle back to
34:48 - what i
34:48 - have before uh just just like try to
34:52 - do what excites you because like this is
34:55 - what
34:55 - keeps me going in terms of like coding
34:58 - if i
34:59 - do something that i'm not interested in
35:00 - even though i'm coding it's not
35:02 - something
35:03 - that i want to continue work on
35:06 - and of course if you're interested in cs
35:08 - it doesn't mean you have to code in
35:10 - front of the computer every single day
35:12 - you definitely need to like take a break
35:14 - um so i would say like if you feel like
35:17 - you have some free time
35:18 - just like take a look into like some
35:21 - tutorials just like building up side
35:23 - projects on the site and every
35:25 - like three months or something it
35:27 - doesn't have to be
35:28 - like doing it every single day
35:32 - okay um someone's interested in the
35:35 - stanford program you attended and they
35:37 - asked
35:37 - are can they still attend that program
35:39 - you attended
35:41 - um so i think it's something that is
35:44 - still ongoing so you need to go
35:46 - on the stanford website and then
35:50 - see uh you need to fill out an
35:52 - application uh let's go to summer
35:54 - college
35:55 - so here is the link to
35:59 - that website um but anyways
36:03 - they offer a lot of different classes
36:05 - not just um
36:06 - programming classes so if you're
36:08 - interested in taking classes at stanford
36:10 - in general just like go ahead and sign
36:12 - up
36:13 - but i think the selection process is a
36:15 - little bit rigorous as well so
36:17 - make sure you kind of like it's almost
36:20 - like applying to college
36:21 - so make sure you like have a really good
36:24 - promising
36:24 - personal statement when you're applying
36:27 - okay
36:28 - uh we have another question asking
36:30 - what's a good way to approach people for
36:32 - referrals
36:34 - um so me personally doesn't really like
36:38 - just reaching out to people out of the
36:41 - blue just like can you give me a
36:42 - referral
36:43 - so uh one thing that i recommend is that
36:46 - one sign up for linkedin because it's
36:48 - something that you can build your
36:49 - professional network and you can also
36:51 - find a lot of cool people on linkedin
36:54 - and then
36:55 - just think about what you're interested
36:57 - in what area of technology are you
36:59 - interested in are interested in data
37:01 - analysis are you interested in like web
37:03 - development
37:04 - um or what kind of companies are
37:06 - interested in working for
37:08 - and you can definitely find a lot of
37:10 - like engineers or recruiters
37:12 - on the platform for linkedin um
37:16 - and then i would say reach out to
37:19 - engineers in general because recruiters
37:21 - are super busy
37:22 - and they usually like don't respond to
37:24 - your emails but if you're interested in
37:26 - a particular area of tech reach out to
37:29 - some engineers who are working on that
37:31 - tag
37:31 - and try to like schedule a 30 minute
37:34 - coffee chat or something just talk about
37:36 - how
37:36 - you learn read about their profile
37:39 - you're really interested in the work
37:40 - they're doing can i schedule a 30 minute
37:42 - coffee chat
37:43 - um and just like talk ask you questions
37:46 - and learn about your experience
37:47 - and once you kind of started to build up
37:50 - that relationship
37:51 - um it's easy like it's easy to like
37:55 - ask for referrals down the road just
37:57 - because um
37:58 - now because you have been talking they
38:00 - have like a better idea
38:02 - like what you're interested in and what
38:03 - you're good at um
38:05 - and it's like easier for people to refer
38:07 - you
38:08 - so yeah okay uh someone asked
38:12 - um is it a good idea to pay for the
38:14 - certificates on coursera to put on the
38:16 - resume
38:18 - um let's see
38:23 - i don't think is a super
38:26 - good idea me personally doesn't really
38:28 - think it's a super good idea
38:30 - because um what you want to
38:34 - learn from those coursera courses is
38:37 - more like the technical
38:39 - aspects like the technical skills that
38:41 - you want to have you can
38:42 - like once you take those courses you can
38:44 - like list them
38:45 - on your resume and if you're can like
38:48 - kind of do it really involved in those
38:50 - classes you can like talk about those in
38:52 - your resume
38:53 - as well and i don't think it's worth the
38:56 - money to
38:57 - um like pay for it just because uh you
39:01 - can always just
39:01 - list it on linkedin um and then
39:05 - yeah and you can talk about it in
39:07 - interviews as well without
39:08 - actually having to that solid
39:11 - certificate that you pay for
39:13 - okay uh we have a question asking how do
39:16 - you score that first internship that
39:18 - that opens you to more opportunities
39:22 - um so my first internship is the high
39:24 - school
39:25 - internship at autodesk and basically
39:28 - what happens is that
39:29 - at the if you're like frc participate in
39:33 - the pacific northwest
39:34 - region you receive an email saying uh
39:37 - like all of that
39:38 - is interested in hiring high school
39:40 - interns and
39:41 - work on a product called synthesis and
39:43 - it's basically a robotic simulator built
39:46 - in the unity engine
39:47 - where it allows like uh programmers or
39:50 - drivers of like robotics team to kind of
39:53 - like
39:54 - import the 3d models of the robot and
39:56 - try it in a virtual field
39:58 - instead of building it up in the first
39:59 - place um
40:01 - so how i landed that internship is
40:03 - mostly like just
40:04 - like apply so look for those
40:06 - opportunities
40:08 - and the first even though like you feel
40:10 - like you might not have all the
40:11 - qualification
40:12 - the first tip that i have is just apply
40:14 - because you'll never know what happens
40:17 - uh and things will never happen if you
40:19 - don't apply in the first place
40:20 - and then after i apply i think is mostly
40:24 - like
40:24 - if you are really involved in some sort
40:26 - of like coding projects
40:28 - uh for me it was robotics back in high
40:30 - school
40:31 - you definitely have like a lot to talk
40:33 - about so get really good at practicing
40:35 - uh how you can like describe your
40:39 - experience like what kind of problem
40:41 - that you have
40:42 - and what kind of approach you take to
40:43 - solve that problem and what kind of
40:45 - improvement that you wish you
40:47 - made if you get a second chance to work
40:49 - on that project
40:50 - it's something that is really good to
40:52 - practice for those interview questions
40:56 - uh we have another question uh before
40:58 - the microsoft internship did you have
41:00 - any work experience if so where
41:04 - um yeah the work experience that i just
41:06 - talked about is like the autodesk
41:08 - leadership
41:09 - yeah okay uh
41:12 - let's see what is a facebook community
41:15 - group that you suggested earlier
41:18 - yep so um so that community
41:22 - group currently is only opening to
41:25 - like college women but once you are in
41:28 - college
41:28 - um i will definitely suggest you to
41:32 - apply since your freshman year so
41:34 - basically
41:35 - uh this is a program that kind of runs
41:38 - uh through your college years and they
41:41 - have like for example if you are
41:44 - okay so let me just like kind of restart
41:46 - it so
41:47 - for rewriting code you can like sign up
41:49 - their website and become a member so
41:51 - once you're a member you can join your
41:53 - facebook group
41:54 - and get access to whatever people are
41:56 - sharing on the facebook groups
41:58 - uh but they also have another position
42:01 - which is
42:02 - called something called fellow so as the
42:04 - rewriting co-fellow you need to fill out
42:06 - an application and you need to go to
42:08 - kind of like a
42:09 - selection process on their site but then
42:11 - as a fellow you get more resources and
42:14 - this year they're starting like a big
42:16 - little mentoring program where
42:17 - upperclassmen
42:18 - can kind of uh mentor some lower
42:21 - craftsmen
42:22 - for freshmen and sophomores uh in
42:24 - college and kind of like
42:25 - talk about their experience and get some
42:27 - help in terms of like
42:28 - internship applications and things like
42:30 - that um yeah so that's the organization
42:33 - that made
42:34 - okay uh we have another question asking
42:37 - if you are interested in both
42:38 - programming and design
42:40 - would you double major in computer
42:41 - science and product design
42:44 - um i think let's see
42:50 - um even though even if you are
42:53 - majoring i think the first question
42:57 - that you kind of want to ask is like
43:00 - which do you want to like which one do
43:04 - you like
43:04 - better so um there's not really
43:08 - it's not saying that if you're major in
43:10 - cs you cannot work
43:12 - in design because uh even though if
43:14 - you're in in the cs major
43:16 - you there's still different like
43:18 - concentrations within that major
43:20 - for example for utah we have like hci
43:23 - major which focus more on like humans
43:25 - and humor human computer interaction
43:28 - and you can take some classes that focus
43:31 - more on like the design aspect of things
43:34 - and you can definitely that get that
43:36 - kind of skills
43:37 - um so it doesn't mean that you have to
43:41 - double major in things
43:43 - such that you can take the classes uh
43:45 - and i believe a lot of college classes
43:47 - is open to
43:49 - all the majors so you can like pick up
43:51 - those skills as you go when you're
43:52 - taking those classes
43:56 - our next question is a little bit more
43:57 - general um they're asking how do i get
43:59 - an internship in high school
44:03 - um so i guess i don't really
44:08 - have a lot of good tips at this point
44:11 - um because for me it was mostly like
44:15 - i saw an opportunity and then i go ahead
44:17 - and apply
44:18 - but then in terms of high school
44:20 - internship i believe
44:22 - for microsoft they have like a high
44:24 - school intern program as well
44:26 - and for those high school internships i
44:29 - believe
44:29 - the most things they would look for is
44:31 - like your passion
44:32 - in technology and your ability to learn
44:35 - new things
44:36 - and if you are interested in getting a
44:38 - high school internship
44:40 - definitely try to get involved in some
44:42 - coding projects at your school
44:44 - so if your club needs a new website you
44:47 - can like offer to help them build it and
44:49 - in the process you can like look up
44:51 - resources and pick up new technology
44:54 - um yeah and that's like the type of
44:58 - advice i would give just keep doing a
45:00 - lot of different coding projects
45:02 - and getting good at describing that
45:04 - experience when you apply
45:07 - okay uh next question asks um i'm really
45:10 - interested in graphic design and i want
45:12 - to apply this to cs
45:13 - would it be a good idea to go into the
45:16 - ux engineering field
45:19 - so um i guess
45:22 - uh one thing that i kind of want to
45:23 - clarify about ux engineering
45:26 - is that it's not actually a field where
45:29 - you get to do
45:30 - both design and engineering so for my
45:33 - project it's a little bit
45:34 - special in the sense that my mentor
45:38 - is really aware that i know i really
45:40 - like design so i also have kind of have
45:43 - that experience back in the new
45:44 - technologies program
45:45 - so he kind of tailored that experience
45:48 - for me so for my project i actually get
45:50 - to
45:50 - both design like the app that i'm
45:52 - building and also like
45:54 - implement it but in reality what ux
45:56 - engineers usually do
45:58 - is that they uh usually they are
46:02 - building up like the coding components
46:04 - for the ui component so if you look at
46:07 - like your zoom
46:08 - interface for example you see all those
46:10 - like different buttons
46:12 - like the participants chat and share
46:13 - screen record and reactions
46:16 - all those different comp uh all those
46:18 - buttons uh
46:19 - have are just like components and their
46:22 - code they kind of run those components
46:24 - and what ux engineering's do
46:26 - uh is actually like code up all those
46:29 - components
46:30 - and like figure out how to make them as
46:34 - reusable as possible when other
46:36 - engineers want to use those components
46:37 - and build the app really quickly
46:40 - so yeah the main part of the job is
46:42 - actually building
46:43 - uh like coding not like designing
46:47 - okay uh since we're running out of time
46:48 - we're just gonna answer two more
46:49 - questions that people have already sent
46:51 - in the chat
46:52 - uh one of them is do you know any high
46:54 - school internships a beginner
46:56 - can apply apply to for a cse
47:00 - um high school internships is that the
47:03 - question
47:04 - sorry uh yeah yeah they asked
47:07 - any high school internships at a
47:09 - beginner can apply
47:10 - apply to for cse what's yes
47:15 - um the one that i know of is just a
47:18 - microsoft
47:19 - high school intern program um and again
47:22 - there are probably a lot out there
47:24 - um and they might not be like
47:26 - quote-unquote internships but there are
47:27 - more like
47:28 - summer programs and i think you don't
47:31 - have to have like that type of
47:33 - internship especially out of the high
47:35 - school um but you also
47:37 - you just want to have more experience in
47:39 - all those like different coding programs
47:41 - and get exposure to different technology
47:43 - so i would just say like google like
47:46 - coding programs for high schoolers
47:48 - or internships open for high schoolers
47:50 - and there are some lists that will pop
47:52 - up
47:52 - and just apply okay great
47:55 - we have our last question asking if i
47:58 - want to incorporate coding and design
48:00 - major in college
48:01 - what do i need to to prepare in high
48:03 - school
48:05 - um i would say
48:09 - be
48:13 - coding and design major
48:17 - um like there so in high school
48:20 - there isn't really a lot of things that
48:23 - you can like kind of prepare
48:26 - because um you just um
48:29 - i guess one thing that you can prepare
48:31 - well
48:32 - as a high schooler when you're applying
48:34 - to college is definitely do a lot of
48:36 - research
48:36 - unlike the colleges and kind of get to
48:39 - know like their design program and their
48:41 - cse program
48:43 - and know like what the culture is like
48:45 - in those programs
48:46 - because you want to make sure the school
48:49 - that you're applying to have really good
48:51 - coding slash design programs and
48:54 - there's also some other colleges out
48:56 - there i believe that
48:58 - have like programs that kind of like
49:00 - blend those two areas a little bit
49:01 - better
49:02 - um so definitely look into those and
49:05 - just like
49:06 - be i think um
49:11 - my biggest advice is just try to do what
49:14 - you're interested in and don't
49:16 - feel too pressured to um
49:20 - like be prepared well i know like
49:22 - nowadays there's a lot of pressure in
49:23 - like starting early and things like that
49:25 - but
49:26 - you need to also enjoy your high school
49:28 - times and
49:30 - and have fun you know before you get
49:32 - into college and
49:33 - be super stressed out about everything
49:35 - but yeah
49:38 - thank you so much um we'll be concluding
49:40 - our panel
49:41 - right now um thank you when and thank
49:44 - you for those who came today
49:46 - um as jen said before we will have our
49:49 - future courses
49:50 - on python web development and java
49:53 - you can see more information for future
49:56 - workshops and panels on our website
49:58 - thank you once again went so much for
50:00 - coming this is a great panel
50:02 - and you answered the questions really
50:04 - well thank you all for
50:06 - asking questions to when and yeah
50:09 - thank you for coming

Cleaned transcript:

joining me in this saturday noon time afternoon time i really appreciate you all coming so my name is wen i'm currently a rising senior studying computer science at the university of washington seattle um and i have been doing a couple of internships throughout my college times uh right now i'm currently a software engineering intern at cloudflare doing a remote internship because of covet and last summer i've been a ux engineering intern at microsoft and someone before i was a new technologist participant and after graduating from high school i also was a high school intern at autodesk as a software engineering intern and i can i'm pretty happy to like go a little bit deeper into each of these experience uh when we get to our question later um and other than my internship positions i'm also currently a head teaching assistant for one of the data programming classes at my school and i'm also rewriting the code fellow which is like a college women community in tech but yeah that's basically about me and i'm happy to answer questions yeah thank you so much and thank you for being here today um we'll get started on our first question which is what inspired you to pursue computer science yeah this is a good question so um just a little bit more background about me so i moved i actually moved uh here to the us from china five years ago with my parents so before i move here i actually have zero exposure to programming so um and then like i just have a free summer after i move because like in china there's a lot of homework so i don't really have free time to kind of explore what i want to do so i have a free summer after i move and then i started playing a lot of video games and i started watching a video on how video games are made and then it just really fascinates me on how like the programmers actually like encode all those logic into like video games uh with coding so um that just like kind of intrigued my interest in like coding in general and after i started high school here i also got involved in the first robotic competition and joined the programming team in the robotics team high school the first the moment that i really feel like uh cs is something that excites me is when i wrote a for loop that actually makes like fancy led patterns because for me it is like the first time that i actually see the power of how like you can make real things happen with code um and then after that i just uh do a lot of like digging around and exploring a lot of resources and kind of learn uh programming in my own time i also took an intro to programming class when i was doing a high school summer college program at stanford and that kind of gives me a little bit more theoretical background and actually learned how to think like a programmer and later i just like get a lot more involved into like my programming team um during my senior year of high school and i really enjoy the pro problem solving process and also finding out what's broken um and that kind of gives me a really solid idea of like i want to pursue a cs major in college yeah that's basically a story wow that's really interesting um could i actually ask you um which game really inspired you to start coding and like what language you started off with from your yeah so the game um that kind of intrigues me is actually assassin's creed uh maybe some of you know the series but i'm really a big fan of like the earlier assassin's creed series um and then i played them a lot but then when i actually started coding video games is i i actually took a video games programming class at my high school and the tool they use is called digipen so it's more like a drag and drop where you can feel like the interface but you can also integrate really simple code and i'm not sure what the language is i'm not thinking about it but after that i also tried to code video games in unity which is a game engine where you can use like csharp with as a language to build video games and it's a really cool engine too okay thank you so much um we'll be moving to our second question now um which is oops do you have any advice for aspiring students in the tech field yeah i guess my biggest advice is definitely do what excites you like for me uh what gets me excited about computer science the first place is video games so even though right now i am shifting more towards like web development and app development just uh like try to figure out what's the best how to create like the best experience for my users um my initial like entry point is video games so definitely if you're interested in building something just start finding resources and there's tons of online resources now nowadays available like their free coursera courses and all those like medium articles people like just write up and just show you how they make their own app so if you're interested in any of those just start like reaching out on those online resources and start looking into it because um you don't want to start up with something that is kind of boring because that will never carry you far that's basically my biggest advice okay um do you have any like recommendations or like places that you think people should start off with like something that they should do to start off with before they you know try to get into their tech field um so i guess uh my advice is to if your school is offering like cs classes um definitely take those classes because it's really like learning cs or programming is like really crucial that you kind of like in the mindset of how to program uh it's not it's something that you kind of need some uh prior training on in order to get into it but um it's not like uh so i would say like programming is not something that have a really high bar entry like when i was in china i always thought that you need to be really smart you need to be really good at math in order to get really good at coding but uh it's not true because like once i get really excited about something i decide to make up my mind to build it i can like look up resources and start like realizing my own idea and creativity in through programming and through that that actually kind of helped me practice my logical uh thinking and get get me better at math as well so i would say um definitely start looking at something that interests you and then look at some online tutorials yeah hope that's helpful okay so third question as a woman in the tech field did you experience any gender biases in school or while you were applying for internship positions yeah um so fortunately i didn't actually experience any ex biases that specifically targeted against me in those like ex like when i'm applying for internships or within classes that once you are in like the cs major or once you started doing all those like technical internships you do start to feel that pressure because you kind of look around you and you just see guys everywhere basically so when i was uh when i get into cs at uw it's just really apparent that when you look around the classroom most of the people are guys and you just see a couple of girls gathering around and that is part of the reason why it's super important as like a woman in tech you want to be really good at finding that community and like use the resources shared by that community um and even when i'm currently in my current internship when all the engineering teammates on my team are men but then so it's just you can feel like there's still a gender imbalance in the depth view in the tech view definitely but um the one good thing is that the tech view is kind of striving to gain more diversity when they're hiring in their hiring process so use this type of push to your advantage because um the tech industry is actually looking for more women engineers to join their team because they believe that you can contribute really valuable perspectives and skill sets and there are also a lot of great communities out there to support women for example like this one girls coded i don't think uh guys have this type of organization so definitely make use of these and for me my community is like rewriting a code which is like an online facebook community where people just like sharing resources on how to prepare for interviews how to prepare for internships and things like that those resources just like online so definitely keep an eye out for those communities um do you think like being in a class with women uh like a small amount of you know girls or like woman you think it brought you guys closer together as friends or did you like maybe not talk to them during the year um i think it definitely brought bring us closer as friends um that because like you assure the identity as a woman and kind of kind of like a minority in this field is really when you start like chatting with each other it's really natural that you share that kind of connection uh in terms of like you can like complain about how this just gets everywhere and then you can also talk about some like common experience like how do you overcome the imposter syndrome or overcome that kind of like you don't want to uh you want to kind of like prove yourself to be as good as guys just because you're a minority which is like basically not true but that kind of urge still exists because of like the gender imbalance we're going to move on to our fourth question then thank you for this one um what was the microsoft internship application process like and how did you prepare for your interviews yeah so for the microsoft internship application the traditional route is that you will fill out an online application form where you just fill out some basic information and also upload your resume and if you have a good enough resume uh the recruiters will reach out to you and schedule a phone screen so you you like kind of chat with them uh on some like behavioral questions like tell me about how you work with a team or tell me about your time you have to overcome some obstacles um and after that if you if they still think you're a good fit to a company you move on to like technical interviews um and in this uh i think like the final round of this process is actually on site so you would actually go to like at least in the normal circumstances you will go to the actual microsoft redmond campus um or if you're somewhere uh not in seattle maybe you would go to the other campuses um but then in the raving campus you just go through a whole day of backtoback interviews and you meet with people in different roles so for my experience is a little bit different from the traditional one just because i have participated in the new technologies program in my in the summer of my freshman year so for those of you who are not familiar with that program is basically a sevenweek academy type program where you learn the whole product development cycle from like ideation thinking about what the need of customer is to creating like a mockup of like the idea or the app that you're trying to build to target the problem statement that you try to solve and finally you work with a team of other college students to kind of build up that app together and that program is kind of designed specifically for freshmen and sophomores so people who don't have a lot of like technical background so it's like so it kind of has a lower expectation in terms of like what what background you want to come in so i was a participant in that program and i have a really great experience and after that i got a referral from a coach in that program and he kind of recommended to me to do this uh ux engineering internship so i kind of skipped the like online application and like the phone screen and i go straight to outside so for my experience um the first like i have around with like engineers just like just asking some whiteboarding questions so you need to actually write down code on the whiteboard when they ask you a question and um that is mostly testing your technical skills and how well you are in terms of like communicating your thought process um i also have interviews with like a project manager and it's mostly like uh testing my design skills like how do i uh create this wireframe and also draw them on the whiteboard and later i have a lunch interview with like a engineering manager and it's mostly him asking a little bit me a little bit about me but mostly is me asking a question to him as well like asking uh why do you work in this team like what kind of intern projects are you expecting me to do for the summer and finally it's more more like uh a final round with um an engineering a design director at microsoft so it's someone who are more higher up and the question she mostly asked me was about like uh where do i see myself in five years and things like that so um because my the role i'm interviewing for is ux engineering so it has kind of a blend between like design and engineering uh if you are going for like software engineering roles you probably will get a lot more like technical focused backtoback interviews but yeah that's basically my interview experience at microsoft wow that's really interesting and i think that would help a lot of people a lot um just knowing that process um next question is what was your daytoday life like as a software engineer intern yeah um i guess i can just use my experience right now because uh again i'm a software engineering internet coupler so the project that i'm working on this summer i actually get to collaborate with a project management intern so uh for he so his task is mostly focused on like figuring out the general direction of the product and also like kind of a little bit of like thinking about what our competitors are like what the interface should look like for the product and things like that whereas me is mostly focused on importing that thing um so usually in the morning or in the beginning of the week i will check in with that intern just to kind of clarify like what will be our todo items for the week and what would be our goals that we want to achieve by the end of the week and then after that is mostly like doing a lot of research on the things that i need to implement and this is the point where googling really comes in handy uh and i would definitely say if you're a good programmer you're definitely a really good googler because you really know how you need to know like how to find the resource you need via googling and even though it uh if you are even if you are like a senior engineer maybe like the besides like the technical experience that you get uh you just like get really good at googling compared to like the junior engineers um so after doing this research of course i need to like start coding and also do a lot of debugging on like the program that i wrote and another aspect is like documentation so after you write down the code you also want to document them and try because that is super important in terms of like uh telling whoever else is reading your code um like how do like what does your code do like how does though how does that work and if you they want to use your code how are they going to use it so documentation is like a super important part in this engineering process just because you want to write code that works but you also want to write code that works for other people as well um and if i get stuck i would like paying my mentor on google chat just asking them for help and then sometimes i also attend like team meetings where i just like kind of report the progress uh throughout the week to the team and there's also like some fireside chats or things like that where the company executives uh get to like uh it's more like a q a with company executives and they're also like social events where you have some interim mixers where you just get to know like other interns within the company so yeah that's basically the daytoday as a software engineer intern um what would you say is the most fun part of your day as a software engineer intern i would say the best moments are the ones that after debugging for one or two or more hours you finally get it to work like even though the debugging process can be super painful but like the moment that you figure out how to solve the problem is like really amazing and it's basically something that keeps you going even though like you know like the next moment when you start working on something new you're going to start going back to that debugging process again but it just feels really good um okay so we'll start opening up to our audience here for some more questions so um here's an open q a for anyone who wants to ask questions you could type it in the chat if you don't feel comfortable with speaking or you can unmute yourself and um you know ask your questions um sharon from the audience asks in the chat what do you suggest to young girls who are interested in coding um so uh when would you like us to answer that um you mean like uh in terms of the technology or like what exactly i think that suggestion is targeting oh yeah she also asked a more specific questions like what language or activities do you think would help prepare them yeah um so i think python is a really good starter starter language to learn just because the syntax is really easy and um there's also a lot of really great tutorials out there just like helping guiding you out how to code the simple python game for example and that is definitely a good language to pick up in the beginning and even though it's simple it's actually a super powerful language because python is used in like the data analysis fields a lot and a lot of and a lot of people also i think it's like almost like the second most popular programming language nowadays um another the top most popular so far i think is actually java so java is like a more you have stricter syntax in java and there is a little bit of barrier to entry to java but then a lot of good concepts that you learn while you're programming java is actually applicable to other language as well so it's really good to have a really solid foundation in java as well and java is actually the language that i started coding in um but then if you want to make some project that you i can actually see things happening i would recommend like learning html and css just like building up your own website um and you can also learn a little bit about javascript which is actually really different from java even though they seem they sound really similar but then is a programming language for web and you can kind of give more interaction or dynamics to your website but yeah i think those are my recommendations that you can start looking into i know it's a lot but um i say if i have a fake one i'll say go for python but yeah um another audience member asks what are some companies slash organizations that offer high school internships high school internships let's see um like autodesk is the one that i know of just because but it's like a little bit more um regional specific because like i think it only hires like participants in the first robotics competition from the pacific northwest region so it's like super specific um i don't really know of anywhere else at this point um but if you like try to google it i believe you can also find find out some of them as well but yeah um another audience member asks uh how many languages you how many languages did you learn and what order did you learn them in yeah i mean looking back i actually learned a lot of language which is even like okay let me pull up my resume so that i can like read them out um let's see so my first language is java like i mentioned because i use it in my robotics team and it's also the language we use in the intro to programming class i have at my school and then the second language i learned is c sharp so uh c sharp is a language that is used by uh what if you need to develop games in unity csharp is an option the other option is the plus plus but that is like a lot more complicated actually c sharp have a really similar syntax to java so if you know java it's very really easy for you to transition to c sharp um and after that i learned swift so swift is a programming language that you can use to code ios apps so if you want to develop mobile mobile apps for apple this is the language that you go for and i learned it during the new technologies program because at that point that program is using script as the language uh for coding up like the app prototypes um and then after that i learned python and html and css and javascript and php and sql actually at the same time so basically what happens is that there are one quarter at my school where i take a web programming class and a data programming class at the same time so what happens at that quarter is actually super chaotic because i learned like six different languages in the web programming class just because you need to use different languages to do different things for when you're building a website whereas uh on the on the other hand i also need to learn python which uh in my data programming class so that was a really cool experience though because like you can as you are like picking up those language and kind of struggling to switch your mindset in between all those different languages you start to see like the commonalities shared between those languages and in fact there's a lot of really fundamental concepts in programming that is uh that is not language specific and as you're learning more and more language you started to see like a common pattern and it also actually helps you to pick up other language really quickly as well because the only thing that is different is um just like remembering what the syntax should be in that different language um and after that i also learned a it's not a language but it's more like a framework called react so react is a really popular web development framework nowadays that a lot of people use and it's built on top of javascript um so if you're interested in web development once you feel like you have a good hang of html css and javascript definitely looking to react because this is a really popular thing that people are using and finally in last quarter of my college i actually learned another language which is c plus and actually c so c and c plus plus are a lot kind of like lower level language in the sense that uh those language you are able to interact directly with like the hardware of the computer so it's not something that as fancy as html css as in the sense that you can build like a front end or like the interface that you can see but it's like those languages are really efficient in a sense that because they are built um with like with because like they're designed for building really powerful and efficient um applications um yeah so like i know this is a lot uh but then i think in the future as i move on to my actual fulltime job or pick up more internship i would definitely learn a lot more languages um but it's just like the life of a software engineer you just need to be really good at picking up new skills and just keep learning great um we have another question um do you suggest any online resources for learning python or any other language um i see online resources so coursera probably have some really cool classes let's see so yeah but it's like let me send a link to the chat so i think coursera has some like free classes uh that you can look into and then unity if you're interested in like game development or just like some um just like interested in starting from building games you can uh look into unity which is this one um this is a link to like the unity so the good thing about starting with unity when you're building things is that they have really good documentation on everything so they have a lot of really cool tutorials that can like kind of guide you through every single step um but yeah this is like the tuesday that i have in mind right now but i guess i can also follow up if i come up with more resources later yeah just a quick shameless self promo we are um our organization is offering um python java and web development courses soon so i'll keep on look out for that we have an another question saying recommendations slash best resources for preparing for technical interviews yes um so i think for high school it might be a little bit early to mention this but um for so usually when people are preparing for technical interviews they use a resource called colleague code and leak code is one that is like super popular and the other one is hacker rank so basically uh for these two sites they kind of have a really similar um purpose of like they just have a lot of like those different algorithm problems um and they would like kind of show you the problem statement and you need to basically call up a solution to kind of solve those problems and they also have all those different test case that you can run so after you pull up the solution you can like test if that solution works or not um but then i guess uh if you for high school students this might be a higher bar of entry just because it would be you need to basically most of the question on there you need to basically have taken like the first data structures and algorithm class in college um to have that kind of theoretical background for you to be more comfortable in terms of like um practicing the actual problems on there and um the other book that a lot of people recommend for a coding interview is just uh something called cracking the coding interview you can google the book and it basically is a book that kind of walks you through the different aspects of like technical interview and um also like talk about some like basic concepts on the data structure but i would definitely say don't jump too fast into those resources because it's really easy to get discouraged if you don't have like the theoretical background coming into solving those questions um but yeah great uh we have another question um what coding language is the best to create a game um it depends a lot on what kind of game that you want to create um c plus plus is a language that a lot of popular game engines uh use just because um like i said before c plus plus is a language designed for building really fast and efficient uh games and you if you are a gamer you can imagine that people don't really like to have their games to lag a lot or just like have you need to wait a long time for the game to load etc and that's why a lot of uh game developers use the plus plus to kind of like build up their game uh to make them as performant as possible um but then c sharp is like c sharpness like c with like a pound sign um so c sharp is a language that unity use um and actually unity provides both options you can either code in c sharp or c plus plus and c sharp definitely have better uh better syntax and this is like a little bit less complicated than c plus plus to pick up but yeah that's the two that i can think of right now but i think um a lot of other i think javascript uh there a lot of people also building up javascript games just like you can run it on a website and it's also something that people use okay uh we have another question um what grade did you start learning programming um i started at grade 11 so after because i moved to the u.s at grade 11 this is uh where i start picking up um coding and yeah i would say like the if i have to say the real the learning like hardcore programming uh it's like at the it's more like the freshman year of my college or sophomore year because um when you started to take data structures class is like where you actually get into like the best side of the cs that's how you can describe so yeah um we have another question uh what kind of side projects do you think helped you on your internship um so i actually didn't do a lot of side projects coming into my internship just because um school is really busy so um for me i i don't think any of my side projects would be really like is something that gets me to those internships but um what i really focus on uh on the other side is actually being a teaching assistant so i am a head teaching assistant for a data programming class at my school and um the nice thing about being a teaching assistant and i would definitely recommend uh any every one of you um yeah if you're interested in being a teaching uh in college you should definitely explore the opportunity of being a teaching assistant just because um it helps you to kind of practice public speaking and also explain your thought process and because you're teaching you're also learning the concepts in cs better and it helps you to prepare for coding interview as well so yeah okay uh we have a really good question um they're saying i'm really interested in coding but i'm afraid of giving up in the middle of my progress is there any tip for overcoming it um i think i would just circle back to what i have before uh just just like try to do what excites you because like this is what keeps me going in terms of like coding if i do something that i'm not interested in even though i'm coding it's not something that i want to continue work on and of course if you're interested in cs it doesn't mean you have to code in front of the computer every single day you definitely need to like take a break um so i would say like if you feel like you have some free time just like take a look into like some tutorials just like building up side projects on the site and every like three months or something it doesn't have to be like doing it every single day okay um someone's interested in the stanford program you attended and they asked are can they still attend that program you attended um so i think it's something that is still ongoing so you need to go on the stanford website and then see uh you need to fill out an application uh let's go to summer college so here is the link to that website um but anyways they offer a lot of different classes not just um programming classes so if you're interested in taking classes at stanford in general just like go ahead and sign up but i think the selection process is a little bit rigorous as well so make sure you kind of like it's almost like applying to college so make sure you like have a really good promising personal statement when you're applying okay uh we have another question asking what's a good way to approach people for referrals um so me personally doesn't really like just reaching out to people out of the blue just like can you give me a referral so uh one thing that i recommend is that one sign up for linkedin because it's something that you can build your professional network and you can also find a lot of cool people on linkedin and then just think about what you're interested in what area of technology are you interested in are interested in data analysis are you interested in like web development um or what kind of companies are interested in working for and you can definitely find a lot of like engineers or recruiters on the platform for linkedin um and then i would say reach out to engineers in general because recruiters are super busy and they usually like don't respond to your emails but if you're interested in a particular area of tech reach out to some engineers who are working on that tag and try to like schedule a 30 minute coffee chat or something just talk about how you learn read about their profile you're really interested in the work they're doing can i schedule a 30 minute coffee chat um and just like talk ask you questions and learn about your experience and once you kind of started to build up that relationship um it's easy like it's easy to like ask for referrals down the road just because um now because you have been talking they have like a better idea like what you're interested in and what you're good at um and it's like easier for people to refer you so yeah okay uh someone asked um is it a good idea to pay for the certificates on coursera to put on the resume um let's see i don't think is a super good idea me personally doesn't really think it's a super good idea because um what you want to learn from those coursera courses is more like the technical aspects like the technical skills that you want to have you can like once you take those courses you can like list them on your resume and if you're can like kind of do it really involved in those classes you can like talk about those in your resume as well and i don't think it's worth the money to um like pay for it just because uh you can always just list it on linkedin um and then yeah and you can talk about it in interviews as well without actually having to that solid certificate that you pay for okay uh we have a question asking how do you score that first internship that that opens you to more opportunities um so my first internship is the high school internship at autodesk and basically what happens is that at the if you're like frc participate in the pacific northwest region you receive an email saying uh like all of that is interested in hiring high school interns and work on a product called synthesis and it's basically a robotic simulator built in the unity engine where it allows like uh programmers or drivers of like robotics team to kind of like import the 3d models of the robot and try it in a virtual field instead of building it up in the first place um so how i landed that internship is mostly like just like apply so look for those opportunities and the first even though like you feel like you might not have all the qualification the first tip that i have is just apply because you'll never know what happens uh and things will never happen if you don't apply in the first place and then after i apply i think is mostly like if you are really involved in some sort of like coding projects uh for me it was robotics back in high school you definitely have like a lot to talk about so get really good at practicing uh how you can like describe your experience like what kind of problem that you have and what kind of approach you take to solve that problem and what kind of improvement that you wish you made if you get a second chance to work on that project it's something that is really good to practice for those interview questions uh we have another question uh before the microsoft internship did you have any work experience if so where um yeah the work experience that i just talked about is like the autodesk leadership yeah okay uh let's see what is a facebook community group that you suggested earlier yep so um so that community group currently is only opening to like college women but once you are in college um i will definitely suggest you to apply since your freshman year so basically uh this is a program that kind of runs uh through your college years and they have like for example if you are okay so let me just like kind of restart it so for rewriting code you can like sign up their website and become a member so once you're a member you can join your facebook group and get access to whatever people are sharing on the facebook groups uh but they also have another position which is called something called fellow so as the rewriting cofellow you need to fill out an application and you need to go to kind of like a selection process on their site but then as a fellow you get more resources and this year they're starting like a big little mentoring program where upperclassmen can kind of uh mentor some lower craftsmen for freshmen and sophomores uh in college and kind of like talk about their experience and get some help in terms of like internship applications and things like that um yeah so that's the organization that made okay uh we have another question asking if you are interested in both programming and design would you double major in computer science and product design um i think let's see um even though even if you are majoring i think the first question that you kind of want to ask is like which do you want to like which one do you like better so um there's not really it's not saying that if you're major in cs you cannot work in design because uh even though if you're in in the cs major you there's still different like concentrations within that major for example for utah we have like hci major which focus more on like humans and humor human computer interaction and you can take some classes that focus more on like the design aspect of things and you can definitely that get that kind of skills um so it doesn't mean that you have to double major in things such that you can take the classes uh and i believe a lot of college classes is open to all the majors so you can like pick up those skills as you go when you're taking those classes our next question is a little bit more general um they're asking how do i get an internship in high school um so i guess i don't really have a lot of good tips at this point um because for me it was mostly like i saw an opportunity and then i go ahead and apply but then in terms of high school internship i believe for microsoft they have like a high school intern program as well and for those high school internships i believe the most things they would look for is like your passion in technology and your ability to learn new things and if you are interested in getting a high school internship definitely try to get involved in some coding projects at your school so if your club needs a new website you can like offer to help them build it and in the process you can like look up resources and pick up new technology um yeah and that's like the type of advice i would give just keep doing a lot of different coding projects and getting good at describing that experience when you apply okay uh next question asks um i'm really interested in graphic design and i want to apply this to cs would it be a good idea to go into the ux engineering field so um i guess uh one thing that i kind of want to clarify about ux engineering is that it's not actually a field where you get to do both design and engineering so for my project it's a little bit special in the sense that my mentor is really aware that i know i really like design so i also have kind of have that experience back in the new technologies program so he kind of tailored that experience for me so for my project i actually get to both design like the app that i'm building and also like implement it but in reality what ux engineers usually do is that they uh usually they are building up like the coding components for the ui component so if you look at like your zoom interface for example you see all those like different buttons like the participants chat and share screen record and reactions all those different comp uh all those buttons uh have are just like components and their code they kind of run those components and what ux engineering's do uh is actually like code up all those components and like figure out how to make them as reusable as possible when other engineers want to use those components and build the app really quickly so yeah the main part of the job is actually building uh like coding not like designing okay uh since we're running out of time we're just gonna answer two more questions that people have already sent in the chat uh one of them is do you know any high school internships a beginner can apply apply to for a cse um high school internships is that the question sorry uh yeah yeah they asked any high school internships at a beginner can apply apply to for cse what's yes um the one that i know of is just a microsoft high school intern program um and again there are probably a lot out there um and they might not be like quoteunquote internships but there are more like summer programs and i think you don't have to have like that type of internship especially out of the high school um but you also you just want to have more experience in all those like different coding programs and get exposure to different technology so i would just say like google like coding programs for high schoolers or internships open for high schoolers and there are some lists that will pop up and just apply okay great we have our last question asking if i want to incorporate coding and design major in college what do i need to to prepare in high school um i would say be coding and design major um like there so in high school there isn't really a lot of things that you can like kind of prepare because um you just um i guess one thing that you can prepare well as a high schooler when you're applying to college is definitely do a lot of research unlike the colleges and kind of get to know like their design program and their cse program and know like what the culture is like in those programs because you want to make sure the school that you're applying to have really good coding slash design programs and there's also some other colleges out there i believe that have like programs that kind of like blend those two areas a little bit better um so definitely look into those and just like be i think um my biggest advice is just try to do what you're interested in and don't feel too pressured to um like be prepared well i know like nowadays there's a lot of pressure in like starting early and things like that but you need to also enjoy your high school times and and have fun you know before you get into college and be super stressed out about everything but yeah thank you so much um we'll be concluding our panel right now um thank you when and thank you for those who came today um as jen said before we will have our future courses on python web development and java you can see more information for future workshops and panels on our website thank you once again went so much for coming this is a great panel and you answered the questions really well thank you all for asking questions to when and yeah thank you for coming
