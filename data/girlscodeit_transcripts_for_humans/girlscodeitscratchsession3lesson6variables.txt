With timestamps:

00:01 - okay we're gonna start coding now i'll
00:03 - share my screen for scratch okay so
00:17 - um i'm just gonna do a demonstration on
00:19 - a code that i already have but i'll
00:21 - explain
00:21 - every single step um today we'll be
00:24 - covering
00:25 - uh for variables we talked about this
00:27 - last time and then
00:28 - today we'll be covering lists but i'll
00:30 - also summarize what we learned last time
00:32 - so here we have our variables for things
00:34 - like points that we're earning and we
00:36 - also have a code for like
00:37 - high score to calculate um high score
00:40 - that we've gotten while playing our game
00:43 - so we have the code
00:46 - um if touching ball then change
00:49 - our point value by one
00:53 - so this means that every time you touch
00:54 - the ball on the point
00:56 - like the points value over here will go
00:58 - up by one but you can also change this
01:00 - like um to any number you want like
01:03 - maybe go up by five over ten
01:05 - or like if you want to discourage the
01:08 - players from
01:09 - um touching the ball you can like
01:11 - decrease the points like
01:13 - going by a negative number so maybe
01:15 - going by negative one
01:16 - will decrease the amount of points that
01:18 - you get and then
01:19 - tell the players that like oh you don't
01:21 - want to touch the ball because it'll
01:22 - take away your points
01:24 - and the goal of the game is usually to
01:25 - get as many points as possible
01:28 - so if you have your points already and
01:31 - you have it showing up here and you want
01:33 - to make it
01:34 - um go up or down you'll use the change
01:37 - points
01:38 - block and if you want it to go up or
01:40 - down based on a condition
01:42 - you need to put it in an if statement uh
01:45 - with a condition here like
01:47 - um it's touching the ball or something
01:50 - like that
01:51 - and then you'll use the change points
01:57 - does that answer your question
02:00 - yeah okay um also remember when you're
02:04 - doing your game
02:05 - um you want to make sure in the
02:07 - beginning you are starting from a clean
02:09 - slate
02:10 - unless you have something like a higher
02:12 - score so the highest score is never
02:14 - something you want to reset
02:16 - because um you want to keep the high
02:18 - score there forever
02:19 - to compare it to your score now or else
02:22 - um you'll never have like an accurate
02:25 - high school
02:26 - so something like the points that you
02:28 - get per game
02:29 - or like the collected items in a list
02:31 - here you want to make sure that you
02:33 - delete all the collected items
02:34 - and you set your point value to the
02:36 - initial points that you want
02:38 - in my case i want my points to start at
02:40 - zero
02:41 - so if you wanted your points to start at
02:43 - like five then you would change this to
02:46 - like five and then go up or down from
02:49 - there
02:50 - um does anyone have any questions on
02:52 - that
02:56 - i had a different question though it was
02:58 - about
03:00 - um it was about clones so i want to
03:03 - code something kind of like i guess
03:06 - atari breakout
03:08 - but then i don't know how to do a point
03:10 - sis
03:11 - like have a point system if
03:15 - for my clones or do i just need to
03:19 - um have a different sprite
03:23 - for every um block
03:27 - um yeah i think for um the variables
03:30 - here because when you make
03:32 - a variable you get a choice for like for
03:34 - all sprites or for this sprite only
03:36 - um i think maybe use another sprite as a
03:40 - clone
03:41 - um because then you can use the points
03:43 - variable
03:44 - for all the spikes also um
03:48 - can you remind me what atari breakout is
03:51 - it's that
03:52 - um game where you have those blocks and
03:55 - then the paddle
03:56 - move you have to move the paddle so that
03:58 - the block doesn't touch the bottom
04:00 - or the ball doesn't touch the bottom but
04:02 - the goal of the game is to clear
04:04 - all of the blocks oh yeah
04:07 - all right i remember that one now yeah
04:10 - [Music]
04:11 - i used to play that on my dad's phone
04:13 - all the time
04:15 - okay so um yeah for that
04:18 - for variables you can use them for
04:21 - either one
04:22 - [Music]
04:23 - or all sprites and um usually i do all
04:26 - sprites just so i have a choice
04:28 - and if you go down here today we'll be
04:31 - talking about lists
04:32 - so you can make a list and i already
04:34 - have one created called collected items
04:37 - um you won't see all of these blocks
04:39 - until you've made your list
04:41 - already so when you go down to variables
04:44 - you want to click this thing that says
04:46 - make a list
04:47 - and then once you've created your list
04:49 - you'll see all of these options
04:52 - so the first block here says add thing
04:56 - to and then the name of your list and
04:58 - what this does
04:59 - is it adds like the word that you type
05:02 - in here into your collected
05:04 - items so i have my list here called
05:07 - collected items and i have this code
05:10 - if i'm touching the ball the ball sprite
05:13 - then
05:14 - i'll add the word ball to my collected
05:16 - items list to show that
05:18 - i've collected like a ball and then i
05:21 - also changed points by one
05:25 - and um that's what this block of code
05:28 - means
05:29 - delete one of collected items um there's
05:32 - a number there
05:33 - and that basically references the
05:37 - order of which items are added into your
05:40 - list
05:41 - so let's say i collected a ball and then
05:44 - ball is up here
05:45 - and it's one um and then i use this code
05:48 - that says delete
05:49 - one of collected items that
05:53 - um the first ball that i collected which
05:55 - is the only one
05:56 - would be deleted so technically it would
05:58 - do the same thing as delete all
06:00 - but let's say i had three different
06:02 - items
06:03 - um a mushroom a
06:06 - chicken and
06:10 - a water bottle i have mushroom chicken
06:12 - water bottle in that order
06:14 - if i did delete one of collected items
06:18 - i would delete the mushroom because the
06:19 - mushroom is first if i did delete
06:22 - two of collected items um which means
06:24 - that the second item i collected
06:27 - i would delete chicken is that what i
06:30 - said
06:30 - was like anymore yeah i would delete the
06:32 - chicken because it was the second one i
06:34 - collected
06:36 - and then delete all is just deleting
06:39 - your entire list
06:40 - and i have it in the beginning here
06:42 - because i want to make sure my list is
06:44 - empty when i start the game
06:46 - so i don't have like stuff from my
06:48 - previous thing that i played
06:51 - um answer thing at one of
06:54 - collected items or maybe list means that
06:57 - you're inserting um this word that you
06:59 - put in here at and then a position
07:02 - on your list so one would be like the
07:05 - first
07:05 - item you have on your list so if you
07:07 - enter the word thing
07:08 - into your list at position one it'll be
07:11 - entered into
07:13 - the place where the first item of your
07:15 - list is
07:16 - if you put it like at three it'll become
07:19 - the third
07:20 - position on your list if your list only
07:23 - has
07:23 - like one item so far
07:28 - and then you do like insert thing at
07:30 - three of collected items
07:32 - um there are two ways that it might go
07:35 - down is that one
07:36 - it might not work because there's no
07:38 - second item
07:39 - or two it'll just put it in behind the
07:42 - first item so um i never really tried
07:45 - that one out
07:46 - but if you want to experiment with that
07:49 - um
07:49 - it would be good replace item one of
07:52 - collected items
07:54 - is basically taking the item in that
07:56 - position
07:57 - and replacing it with a different item
08:01 - so if i had mushroom chicken water
08:04 - bottle here
08:05 - and i wanted to replace mushroom with
08:11 - bird i would do replace item one
08:14 - of the list with bird and then instead
08:17 - of mushroom
08:18 - i will have the word bird
08:21 - and then
08:27 - and then answer and replace are
08:30 - two different things because insert is
08:33 - um
08:34 - just adding something at a specific
08:36 - place
08:37 - and then replace is taking out the thing
08:40 - from that area and then putting in
08:42 - something else
08:43 - so this one maintains the length of your
08:46 - list
08:46 - and then this one will increase the
08:48 - length of your list by one
08:54 - and then over here um you see this block
08:57 - these three blocks are like ovals which
09:00 - means that they're variables
09:02 - so item one of collected items is a
09:06 - variable
09:07 - that describes a word because in our
09:09 - list we are collecting words
09:11 - so item one of collected items let's go
09:14 - back to my
09:15 - mushroom chicken water bottle example
09:17 - item one of this
09:19 - if i use this variable if i called the
09:20 - variable for my list
09:22 - this variable would define mushroom
09:25 - because that's the first item on my list
09:28 - um item number of thing and collected
09:30 - item
09:31 - let's say that i have um chicken
09:35 - in here item number of chicken in my
09:37 - list that's mushroom chicken water
09:39 - bottle
09:40 - will be two because um chicken is second
09:43 - on my list so this variable
09:44 - um defined will be the number two
09:48 - and then length of collected items is
09:50 - also a number
09:51 - and it basically counts how many items
09:53 - you have in your list
09:54 - if you can look down here there's the
09:56 - thing that says length and then right
09:58 - now it says zero because our list is
10:00 - empty
10:01 - but when we have more objects um
10:04 - this will this variable will basically
10:06 - carry
10:07 - um how many objects we have does anyone
10:10 - have any questions on anything that i
10:12 - already talked about like
10:14 - i've been talking about right now
10:19 - does everyone understand how to use
10:22 - these
10:26 - if you understand can you give me like a
10:28 - thumbs up or a thumbs up sticker
10:34 - okay cool it looks like
10:38 - everyone understands so i'll move on to
10:42 - this vlog which is a boolean and you can
10:46 - tell because it is in the shape of a
10:47 - hexagon
10:48 - um collected items contains thing this
10:51 - uh basically asks you does our list
10:55 - contain a specific item and then over
10:58 - here
10:59 - over here um you can type whatever item
11:01 - you're looking for
11:03 - so once again going back to mushroom
11:06 - chicken
11:06 - water bottle if i ask um
11:10 - my code my computer that's running it
11:13 - um does my list have
11:16 - chicken it's going to check my list and
11:19 - it's going to see
11:20 - yes there's a chicken um the second item
11:23 - on the list is a chicken
11:25 - and then this boolean value which is can
11:27 - either be true or false
11:28 - in this case it will be true because it
11:30 - did find the chicken
11:32 - but if i asked does my list contain a
11:35 - book
11:36 - and my list does not contain a book the
11:39 - value for this boolean
11:40 - will become false and it in the case
11:44 - that i put this in an if statement
11:46 - if it's false that code won't run but if
11:48 - it's true the code will
11:50 - run and yeah so this has just come
11:54 - in collected items checking to see if we
11:56 - have a specific
11:57 - item okay and then show list and high
12:00 - list here
12:02 - um so our list
12:05 - already shows itself when we have um
12:08 - this checked off so if we uncheck it
12:10 - it'll be gone
12:12 - and if we check it it'll be there but
12:15 - hide list
12:16 - what hide list does is the same thing as
12:18 - if
12:19 - i unchecked it um it will make our list
12:22 - invisible and then show lists
12:25 - if we put that after high list will
12:28 - show our list so those are
12:32 - pretty easy to remember
12:35 - does anyone have any questions about
12:37 - lists
12:38 - or variables
12:45 - um does anyone want like a height to
12:48 - code
12:50 - a high score feature
12:54 - like you want to show a high score thing
12:58 - okay well then um that is
13:01 - what i have for today's lesson if there
13:04 - are no more questions
13:06 - um so i'll give you guys
13:10 - about 10 minutes
13:13 - to 10 to 15 15.
13:18 - how much time do you guys want to work
13:20 - on your projects right now like 10
13:22 - or 15 minutes 15
13:25 - minutes 15 minutes to work on your
13:28 - project
13:29 - and then um you can ask me a question
13:31 - anytime and then after
13:33 - hopefully some of you guys are willing
13:35 - to share your projects
13:36 - even if you're not finished with your
13:38 - project um especially if you have an
13:40 - issue with your project that you need
13:42 - fixing um it's
13:44 - helpful to share and then we'll talk
13:46 - through it so
13:48 - um i'll start our timer for 15 minutes
13:52 - and you guys can you know
13:55 - do your thing with your project um i
13:58 - have a question
13:59 - is there a mountain sprite in
14:03 - scratch um i'm sure there are mountain
14:06 - sprites
14:07 - but if not you could always um use the
14:10 - painting tool to make your own
14:12 - but i'm i'm like
14:16 - 90 sure there should be a mountain
14:18 - sprite
14:19 - yeah i'm trying to type it but it's not
14:21 - really coming
14:25 - maybe i'm wrong maybe there is no
14:27 - mountain sprite
14:28 - if you want i can take these 15 minutes
14:31 - um
14:32 - to make one for you but that will
14:35 - require me to send it to you through
14:36 - email
14:37 - and then that would probably take a lot
14:39 - of time
14:40 - um so if you want me to though
14:44 - i'm definitely free to do that or
14:48 - okay yeah um do you have
14:52 - any requests on the mountain
14:57 - like a snowy mountain
15:02 - mountain i just want like a regular
15:06 - mountain
15:06 - okay just one like a tall mountain
15:11 - just two that's it two
15:15 - okay well then 15 minutes
15:18 - i'll start now
20:32 - um
22:39 - is there a way to make your project sync
22:42 - or your sprites sync
22:48 - um by sync do you mean like s
22:51 - y and c or s i k
22:54 - s-i-n-k um
22:58 - like go down
23:01 - um yes but it's a little bit complicated
23:06 - because um if you have a background and
23:08 - you want your background to sync
23:10 - you're going to have to switch it into a
23:11 - sprite because you can't move
23:13 - backgrounds on their own
23:15 - oh i meant to make my sprites sink oh
23:18 - yeah yeah
23:18 - then uh that's fine um here let me like
23:22 - go look at the codes really quick
23:24 - on the scratch and then i'll show you
23:27 - um the code and then explain it
23:30 - thank you
25:55 - okay um elizabeth i think i got
25:58 - a code that will work
26:02 - thank you okay so um the thing though
26:05 - is that sprites can't go under the
26:07 - screen completely so
26:09 - you'll still see like a bit of the head
26:14 - okay so basically the code i wrote is
26:18 - that it'll start syncing when i press
26:19 - the space bar
26:21 - but for here if you use an if statement
26:23 - you can change the
26:24 - condition to anything you want um
26:27 - so this is what it looks like when the
26:29 - spread is fully synced
26:31 - okay so i have my sprite here and i'm
26:34 - gonna just take away the music i have
26:36 - because
26:38 - it's a little bit annoying
26:43 - okay so when um
26:46 - i run the code and i press the space bar
26:49 - down here
26:50 - um this is what it looks like you can
26:53 - also make it go faster
26:55 - um but yeah you can make it go faster by
26:58 - making this number bigger
27:01 - um and what you have to do is you want
27:03 - to change
27:04 - y because you don't want the thing to
27:06 - move left or right you want to change y
27:08 - by um a negative number and you want it
27:11 - to go on forever
27:13 - um because you want it to go all the way
27:14 - down no matter where it is
27:16 - so this is the code you have
27:20 - if and then a condition then
27:23 - forever it will go down and
27:26 - if we change this number to like
27:28 - negative 10 it'll
27:30 - go down pretty fast so depending on how
27:33 - fast you want your character to move
27:34 - down
27:37 - that was pretty fast
27:40 - yeah thank you
27:44 - okay no problem
27:51 - um we have about two minutes and 30
27:54 - seconds left
27:56 - um i sent you the mountain sprite inside
27:59 - the
28:00 - chat if you wanted to see that
28:03 - thank you um if you want me to change it
28:07 - though i could probably change it
30:19 - okay we can start um wrapping up now so
30:22 - you have 10 seconds
30:23 - um does anyone want to share what they
30:26 - have
30:27 - or if anyone has any questions and want
30:30 - to be talked through
30:41 - uh so does anyone want to share what
30:43 - they have
30:45 - um i can't really share today because um
30:48 - there's not there's like i can't name my
30:51 - project
30:52 - and i can't see my project so i can't
30:55 - share today
30:58 - okay can you explain what your project
31:00 - is about
31:02 - so my project is about like a city
31:06 - with the food truck going by
31:09 - what's the food truck doing like it's
31:12 - just
31:12 - honking well um if i put a sound
31:16 - so it if i share every
31:19 - it's very loud so i thought i thought of
31:22 - like
31:23 - like putting it a little low volume
31:26 - so then and then the
31:29 - and then the food truck says like
31:33 - uh does every um it says just it just
31:36 - says
31:36 - food everywhere so like it just says it
31:40 - has a space bubble and it says
31:44 - food
31:53 - but it's not letting me name my project
31:58 - hmm could i
32:02 - can i see your screen and then maybe i
32:04 - can help you
32:06 - yeah um
32:10 - can you give me the share oh yeah
32:15 - okay yeah i'm just putting this
32:21 - it's just
32:26 - it's not giving me
32:31 - oh i think maybe you have to sign into
32:34 - your account
32:36 - you know in order to
32:39 - like save stuff so just say
32:42 - like sign in yeah
32:45 - if you already have an account um you
32:47 - sign in and then you might need to
32:50 - um move your code over to that account
32:55 - i'm not 100 sure though just try signing
32:58 - in
32:59 - okay yeah i'll tell my dad to come
33:04 - okay
33:13 - [Music]
33:18 - or just like explain what they have
33:23 - oh sammy
33:48 - a new episode
34:01 - wow that's really smooth i like how
34:04 - um the potion
34:08 - went to your character there i think
34:11 - that was really cool
34:12 - and the background change and the
34:14 - dialogue was really nice as well
34:22 - this is the code how i made the potion
34:25 - glide
34:27 - okay
34:30 - so when that click wait 12 seconds glide
34:34 - 82 132 change size by
34:38 - 50 to make it smaller and when that
34:40 - click
34:42 - go to the position that was in the
34:44 - wizards hand
34:45 - and then with that click go to size 100
34:48 - because the
34:49 - wizard is basically holding it
34:52 - that's cool it really shows you how
34:56 - like um a lot of fun code can be written
34:59 - in ways that you might not know but
35:00 - they'll give you like the same
35:03 - kind of conclusion the same
35:06 - i guess not conclusion but the same um
35:10 - final product and it looks good
35:16 - um does anyone else have anything to
35:19 - share
35:21 - i just signed in and it worked okay
35:24 - cool do you want to share your code um
35:27 - i'm not gonna share but i had
35:29 - something i made at the last class but
35:32 - like
35:33 - i was making the soccer game so there's
35:36 - two players so
35:38 - my dad is not really three so i'm gonna
35:40 - only play with one character
35:43 - okay
36:02 - so
36:09 - so he has to try to kick the ball into
36:11 - the goal well
36:12 - um my dad um he's trying to play the
36:15 - other character
36:16 - so he won't be free to play
36:21 - um i forgot to add the score so i'm
36:24 - gonna do after class
36:27 - oh yeah um the code
36:30 - for the cats do you need help with the
36:34 - score
36:35 - now like would you want to start up now
36:38 - yeah can you help me okay so
36:42 - go to variables and then um let's set up
36:45 - the variable with score
36:46 - yeah and then i think you already have
36:48 - it you can press the check mark on it
36:51 - and do you have like a code for when the
36:54 - soccer ball
36:54 - hits the net um i don't really have a
36:58 - code for this
36:58 - oh yeah i have this soccer ball code
37:02 - okay so um do you want a score for each
37:06 - character
37:09 - yeah i want it for both of them okay so
37:13 - um you might need to make another
37:15 - variable and you might need to rename
37:17 - this one
37:18 - um like score green or score red
37:21 - to let people know like which scores for
37:24 - which character
37:31 - [Music]
37:48 - did we make it to the other character
37:54 - how do we make it for this character at
37:56 - this side
37:57 - um you can either make another variable
38:00 - that's called score red
38:02 - or you can rename the your other
38:05 - variables
38:06 - to become score red but it's just it
38:08 - just depends on you
38:16 - okay
38:20 - and then i think you can drag the score
38:24 - red
38:24 - on the screen to the right side
38:30 - oh yeah
38:38 - so how do we do the code again okay so
38:42 - do you want it so that every time the
38:44 - ball goes into the net it's a point
38:47 - or do you want it like every time the
38:49 - ball
38:51 - hits the edge it's a point um every time
38:54 - the ball goes in the net okay like
38:59 - yeah this might be a little bit
39:02 - complicated
39:03 - you might need to add like sprites for
39:05 - the net
39:06 - like um
39:10 - uh like if you go to sprites you can
39:13 - find
39:14 - like a net sprite
39:21 - soccer net um try using the search bar
39:28 - i don't i'm not completely sure they
39:30 - have one
39:31 - hopefully they do
39:42 - hmm it doesn't seem like they have a
39:44 - soccer net
39:47 - [Music]
39:49 - um but the easiest way is to make it so
39:52 - that
39:52 - the net is a sprite because otherwise
39:55 - you'll have to use coordinates
39:58 - and like make it so that it hits a
40:01 - certain coordinate
40:08 - okay
40:10 - so maybe if you can find like a small
40:12 - enough sprite
40:13 - where it's not very noticeable and put
40:15 - it in the net and then
40:17 - make it so that every time the ball hits
40:19 - that sprite
40:20 - it's just it's a point it'll look like
40:22 - it's going into the net but
40:24 - it'll be with a different sprite
40:27 - and that's just like a easy solution
40:32 - if you don't have a sprite for a soccer
40:34 - net
40:36 - okay so should i just put like
40:39 - um should i just put like some sprite
40:43 - inside or
40:44 - outside of the net um i think put a
40:46 - sprite inside but like make sure it's
40:48 - very small
40:49 - and not super noticeable
40:53 - unless you wanted to be noticeable
40:57 - okay so what can i use
41:00 - so like maybe a small circle or like
41:06 - a small ball you can also adjust the
41:10 - size of
41:12 - your sprite when you're in the code
41:19 - will this little ball work yeah
41:24 - and then just make it a little smaller
41:29 - so go to the size at the bottom
41:33 - if you go down and then change it to a
41:36 - number
41:36 - that's less than a hundred
41:45 - oh that's too tiny
41:56 - that's a pretty good size and then if
41:58 - you put it inside the net over there
42:04 - yeah and then create another one and put
42:07 - it over there
42:09 - look so should i put one at the other
42:12 - side too
42:13 - yeah okay
42:25 - actually um
42:28 - actually no that works
42:32 - um and then if you go to
42:36 - the sprite like the ball sprite
42:39 - and then you can code inside the ball
42:41 - sprite
42:43 - you only need one line of code for this
42:46 - actually
42:46 - or not one line but very few blocks of
42:49 - code
42:50 - if you go to events and then depending
42:52 - on how you start the game
42:56 - um go to your forever loop
43:04 - and then choose an if statement
43:09 - and then do if um
43:13 - in the sensing is touching
43:17 - [Music]
43:20 - the one on the very first
43:26 - and then for sprite go to soccer ball
43:33 - um and then go to variables
43:41 - change change score red by one
43:44 - or um however much you want your point
43:47 - to go
43:48 - so if the ball going in is um
43:51 - goes like you want that to be ten points
43:53 - then
43:55 - um you can change the one to ten
43:58 - [Music]
44:00 - score red light just change
44:03 - score red yeah
44:07 - and then you can do the exact same thing
44:08 - for the one in green but with the
44:10 - ball to spray
44:18 - okay does that make sense
44:29 - um does anyone else have any questions
44:34 - comments
44:37 - suggestions
44:41 - okay if not then we will be ending
44:44 - our class here and then our next two
44:46 - classes
44:47 - one will be tomorrow and then another
44:50 - will be on wednesday
44:51 - we will be focusing only on our projects
44:54 - and
44:54 - it'll be just like this where um we'll
44:57 - be sharing and
44:58 - asking questions and i'll give you a
45:00 - whole class time to
45:02 - do that so thank you guys for coming
45:07 - like always email if you have any
45:09 - questions
45:11 - bye-bye thank you

Cleaned transcript:

okay we're gonna start coding now i'll share my screen for scratch okay so um i'm just gonna do a demonstration on a code that i already have but i'll explain every single step um today we'll be covering uh for variables we talked about this last time and then today we'll be covering lists but i'll also summarize what we learned last time so here we have our variables for things like points that we're earning and we also have a code for like high score to calculate um high score that we've gotten while playing our game so we have the code um if touching ball then change our point value by one so this means that every time you touch the ball on the point like the points value over here will go up by one but you can also change this like um to any number you want like maybe go up by five over ten or like if you want to discourage the players from um touching the ball you can like decrease the points like going by a negative number so maybe going by negative one will decrease the amount of points that you get and then tell the players that like oh you don't want to touch the ball because it'll take away your points and the goal of the game is usually to get as many points as possible so if you have your points already and you have it showing up here and you want to make it um go up or down you'll use the change points block and if you want it to go up or down based on a condition you need to put it in an if statement uh with a condition here like um it's touching the ball or something like that and then you'll use the change points does that answer your question yeah okay um also remember when you're doing your game um you want to make sure in the beginning you are starting from a clean slate unless you have something like a higher score so the highest score is never something you want to reset because um you want to keep the high score there forever to compare it to your score now or else um you'll never have like an accurate high school so something like the points that you get per game or like the collected items in a list here you want to make sure that you delete all the collected items and you set your point value to the initial points that you want in my case i want my points to start at zero so if you wanted your points to start at like five then you would change this to like five and then go up or down from there um does anyone have any questions on that i had a different question though it was about um it was about clones so i want to code something kind of like i guess atari breakout but then i don't know how to do a point sis like have a point system if for my clones or do i just need to um have a different sprite for every um block um yeah i think for um the variables here because when you make a variable you get a choice for like for all sprites or for this sprite only um i think maybe use another sprite as a clone um because then you can use the points variable for all the spikes also um can you remind me what atari breakout is it's that um game where you have those blocks and then the paddle move you have to move the paddle so that the block doesn't touch the bottom or the ball doesn't touch the bottom but the goal of the game is to clear all of the blocks oh yeah all right i remember that one now yeah i used to play that on my dad's phone all the time okay so um yeah for that for variables you can use them for either one or all sprites and um usually i do all sprites just so i have a choice and if you go down here today we'll be talking about lists so you can make a list and i already have one created called collected items um you won't see all of these blocks until you've made your list already so when you go down to variables you want to click this thing that says make a list and then once you've created your list you'll see all of these options so the first block here says add thing to and then the name of your list and what this does is it adds like the word that you type in here into your collected items so i have my list here called collected items and i have this code if i'm touching the ball the ball sprite then i'll add the word ball to my collected items list to show that i've collected like a ball and then i also changed points by one and um that's what this block of code means delete one of collected items um there's a number there and that basically references the order of which items are added into your list so let's say i collected a ball and then ball is up here and it's one um and then i use this code that says delete one of collected items that um the first ball that i collected which is the only one would be deleted so technically it would do the same thing as delete all but let's say i had three different items um a mushroom a chicken and a water bottle i have mushroom chicken water bottle in that order if i did delete one of collected items i would delete the mushroom because the mushroom is first if i did delete two of collected items um which means that the second item i collected i would delete chicken is that what i said was like anymore yeah i would delete the chicken because it was the second one i collected and then delete all is just deleting your entire list and i have it in the beginning here because i want to make sure my list is empty when i start the game so i don't have like stuff from my previous thing that i played um answer thing at one of collected items or maybe list means that you're inserting um this word that you put in here at and then a position on your list so one would be like the first item you have on your list so if you enter the word thing into your list at position one it'll be entered into the place where the first item of your list is if you put it like at three it'll become the third position on your list if your list only has like one item so far and then you do like insert thing at three of collected items um there are two ways that it might go down is that one it might not work because there's no second item or two it'll just put it in behind the first item so um i never really tried that one out but if you want to experiment with that um it would be good replace item one of collected items is basically taking the item in that position and replacing it with a different item so if i had mushroom chicken water bottle here and i wanted to replace mushroom with bird i would do replace item one of the list with bird and then instead of mushroom i will have the word bird and then and then answer and replace are two different things because insert is um just adding something at a specific place and then replace is taking out the thing from that area and then putting in something else so this one maintains the length of your list and then this one will increase the length of your list by one and then over here um you see this block these three blocks are like ovals which means that they're variables so item one of collected items is a variable that describes a word because in our list we are collecting words so item one of collected items let's go back to my mushroom chicken water bottle example item one of this if i use this variable if i called the variable for my list this variable would define mushroom because that's the first item on my list um item number of thing and collected item let's say that i have um chicken in here item number of chicken in my list that's mushroom chicken water bottle will be two because um chicken is second on my list so this variable um defined will be the number two and then length of collected items is also a number and it basically counts how many items you have in your list if you can look down here there's the thing that says length and then right now it says zero because our list is empty but when we have more objects um this will this variable will basically carry um how many objects we have does anyone have any questions on anything that i already talked about like i've been talking about right now does everyone understand how to use these if you understand can you give me like a thumbs up or a thumbs up sticker okay cool it looks like everyone understands so i'll move on to this vlog which is a boolean and you can tell because it is in the shape of a hexagon um collected items contains thing this uh basically asks you does our list contain a specific item and then over here over here um you can type whatever item you're looking for so once again going back to mushroom chicken water bottle if i ask um my code my computer that's running it um does my list have chicken it's going to check my list and it's going to see yes there's a chicken um the second item on the list is a chicken and then this boolean value which is can either be true or false in this case it will be true because it did find the chicken but if i asked does my list contain a book and my list does not contain a book the value for this boolean will become false and it in the case that i put this in an if statement if it's false that code won't run but if it's true the code will run and yeah so this has just come in collected items checking to see if we have a specific item okay and then show list and high list here um so our list already shows itself when we have um this checked off so if we uncheck it it'll be gone and if we check it it'll be there but hide list what hide list does is the same thing as if i unchecked it um it will make our list invisible and then show lists if we put that after high list will show our list so those are pretty easy to remember does anyone have any questions about lists or variables um does anyone want like a height to code a high score feature like you want to show a high score thing okay well then um that is what i have for today's lesson if there are no more questions um so i'll give you guys about 10 minutes to 10 to 15 15. how much time do you guys want to work on your projects right now like 10 or 15 minutes 15 minutes 15 minutes to work on your project and then um you can ask me a question anytime and then after hopefully some of you guys are willing to share your projects even if you're not finished with your project um especially if you have an issue with your project that you need fixing um it's helpful to share and then we'll talk through it so um i'll start our timer for 15 minutes and you guys can you know do your thing with your project um i have a question is there a mountain sprite in scratch um i'm sure there are mountain sprites but if not you could always um use the painting tool to make your own but i'm i'm like 90 sure there should be a mountain sprite yeah i'm trying to type it but it's not really coming maybe i'm wrong maybe there is no mountain sprite if you want i can take these 15 minutes um to make one for you but that will require me to send it to you through email and then that would probably take a lot of time um so if you want me to though i'm definitely free to do that or okay yeah um do you have any requests on the mountain like a snowy mountain mountain i just want like a regular mountain okay just one like a tall mountain just two that's it two okay well then 15 minutes i'll start now um is there a way to make your project sync or your sprites sync um by sync do you mean like s y and c or s i k sink um like go down um yes but it's a little bit complicated because um if you have a background and you want your background to sync you're going to have to switch it into a sprite because you can't move backgrounds on their own oh i meant to make my sprites sink oh yeah yeah then uh that's fine um here let me like go look at the codes really quick on the scratch and then i'll show you um the code and then explain it thank you okay um elizabeth i think i got a code that will work thank you okay so um the thing though is that sprites can't go under the screen completely so you'll still see like a bit of the head okay so basically the code i wrote is that it'll start syncing when i press the space bar but for here if you use an if statement you can change the condition to anything you want um so this is what it looks like when the spread is fully synced okay so i have my sprite here and i'm gonna just take away the music i have because it's a little bit annoying okay so when um i run the code and i press the space bar down here um this is what it looks like you can also make it go faster um but yeah you can make it go faster by making this number bigger um and what you have to do is you want to change y because you don't want the thing to move left or right you want to change y by um a negative number and you want it to go on forever um because you want it to go all the way down no matter where it is so this is the code you have if and then a condition then forever it will go down and if we change this number to like negative 10 it'll go down pretty fast so depending on how fast you want your character to move down that was pretty fast yeah thank you okay no problem um we have about two minutes and 30 seconds left um i sent you the mountain sprite inside the chat if you wanted to see that thank you um if you want me to change it though i could probably change it okay we can start um wrapping up now so you have 10 seconds um does anyone want to share what they have or if anyone has any questions and want to be talked through uh so does anyone want to share what they have um i can't really share today because um there's not there's like i can't name my project and i can't see my project so i can't share today okay can you explain what your project is about so my project is about like a city with the food truck going by what's the food truck doing like it's just honking well um if i put a sound so it if i share every it's very loud so i thought i thought of like like putting it a little low volume so then and then the and then the food truck says like uh does every um it says just it just says food everywhere so like it just says it has a space bubble and it says food but it's not letting me name my project hmm could i can i see your screen and then maybe i can help you yeah um can you give me the share oh yeah okay yeah i'm just putting this it's just it's not giving me oh i think maybe you have to sign into your account you know in order to like save stuff so just say like sign in yeah if you already have an account um you sign in and then you might need to um move your code over to that account i'm not 100 sure though just try signing in okay yeah i'll tell my dad to come okay or just like explain what they have oh sammy a new episode wow that's really smooth i like how um the potion went to your character there i think that was really cool and the background change and the dialogue was really nice as well this is the code how i made the potion glide okay so when that click wait 12 seconds glide 82 132 change size by 50 to make it smaller and when that click go to the position that was in the wizards hand and then with that click go to size 100 because the wizard is basically holding it that's cool it really shows you how like um a lot of fun code can be written in ways that you might not know but they'll give you like the same kind of conclusion the same i guess not conclusion but the same um final product and it looks good um does anyone else have anything to share i just signed in and it worked okay cool do you want to share your code um i'm not gonna share but i had something i made at the last class but like i was making the soccer game so there's two players so my dad is not really three so i'm gonna only play with one character okay so so he has to try to kick the ball into the goal well um my dad um he's trying to play the other character so he won't be free to play um i forgot to add the score so i'm gonna do after class oh yeah um the code for the cats do you need help with the score now like would you want to start up now yeah can you help me okay so go to variables and then um let's set up the variable with score yeah and then i think you already have it you can press the check mark on it and do you have like a code for when the soccer ball hits the net um i don't really have a code for this oh yeah i have this soccer ball code okay so um do you want a score for each character yeah i want it for both of them okay so um you might need to make another variable and you might need to rename this one um like score green or score red to let people know like which scores for which character did we make it to the other character how do we make it for this character at this side um you can either make another variable that's called score red or you can rename the your other variables to become score red but it's just it just depends on you okay and then i think you can drag the score red on the screen to the right side oh yeah so how do we do the code again okay so do you want it so that every time the ball goes into the net it's a point or do you want it like every time the ball hits the edge it's a point um every time the ball goes in the net okay like yeah this might be a little bit complicated you might need to add like sprites for the net like um uh like if you go to sprites you can find like a net sprite soccer net um try using the search bar i don't i'm not completely sure they have one hopefully they do hmm it doesn't seem like they have a soccer net um but the easiest way is to make it so that the net is a sprite because otherwise you'll have to use coordinates and like make it so that it hits a certain coordinate okay so maybe if you can find like a small enough sprite where it's not very noticeable and put it in the net and then make it so that every time the ball hits that sprite it's just it's a point it'll look like it's going into the net but it'll be with a different sprite and that's just like a easy solution if you don't have a sprite for a soccer net okay so should i just put like um should i just put like some sprite inside or outside of the net um i think put a sprite inside but like make sure it's very small and not super noticeable unless you wanted to be noticeable okay so what can i use so like maybe a small circle or like a small ball you can also adjust the size of your sprite when you're in the code will this little ball work yeah and then just make it a little smaller so go to the size at the bottom if you go down and then change it to a number that's less than a hundred oh that's too tiny that's a pretty good size and then if you put it inside the net over there yeah and then create another one and put it over there look so should i put one at the other side too yeah okay actually um actually no that works um and then if you go to the sprite like the ball sprite and then you can code inside the ball sprite you only need one line of code for this actually or not one line but very few blocks of code if you go to events and then depending on how you start the game um go to your forever loop and then choose an if statement and then do if um in the sensing is touching the one on the very first and then for sprite go to soccer ball um and then go to variables change change score red by one or um however much you want your point to go so if the ball going in is um goes like you want that to be ten points then um you can change the one to ten score red light just change score red yeah and then you can do the exact same thing for the one in green but with the ball to spray okay does that make sense um does anyone else have any questions comments suggestions okay if not then we will be ending our class here and then our next two classes one will be tomorrow and then another will be on wednesday we will be focusing only on our projects and it'll be just like this where um we'll be sharing and asking questions and i'll give you a whole class time to do that so thank you guys for coming like always email if you have any questions byebye thank you
