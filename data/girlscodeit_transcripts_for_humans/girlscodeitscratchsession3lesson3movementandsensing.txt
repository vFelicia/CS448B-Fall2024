00:02 - okay so 15 minutes
00:03 - is up um
00:06 - does anyone want to share one of their
00:09 - projects
00:10 - or the product that they were working on
00:13 - um
00:13 - can i share my project yes of course
00:17 - yeah um yeah i should have given you the
00:21 - ability to share your screen i think
00:31 - one second
00:37 - can you help me
00:53 - oh is this a like a tennis game
00:57 - kind of it's like uh you have to try to
01:00 - make the ball bounce
01:05 - it's kinda
01:15 - so you want the ball to bounce on the
01:17 - green
01:19 - like what's in it i'm trying to play it
01:22 - okay
01:24 - um
01:26 - i think um something to
01:30 - really spice up the game and let people
01:32 - know that
01:33 - they want to hit the green paddle might
01:36 - be to add like a point system in here
01:39 - like maybe every time the ball touches
01:42 - the green rectangle
01:43 - um the player gets points
01:46 - or something and then maybe have like
01:49 - levels where
01:51 - i don't know where the score is
01:54 - um yeah we'll cover that when we learn
01:56 - about variables
01:58 - but yeah it's pretty easy since today we
02:01 - talked about
02:02 - um sensing and stuff already it'll just
02:04 - be based off of sensing
02:06 - and stuff like that do you mind
02:09 - me looking in your code i just want to
02:13 - see what's going on in there yeah i'm
02:15 - just going to say
02:16 - stop sharing not stop
02:37 - [Music]
02:49 - code is this
02:52 - yeah it seems like the ball is like
02:55 - twisting when it's touching
02:57 - the paddle yeah
03:02 - but yeah it's a really nice game and i
03:04 - think it could really be made into
03:06 - something that's like really nice
03:08 - um to play and like if you post it
03:12 - um after you're done i think a lot of
03:13 - people would enjoy playing it
03:15 - yeah i don't really know how to post it
03:18 - though
03:19 - oh yeah don't don't worry about that
03:20 - right now um because i think once you
03:22 - post something
03:24 - um i'm like
03:28 - 70 sure that it's a little
03:31 - difficult for you to edit it later and
03:33 - then post it again so
03:34 - i would say complete your game first and
03:36 - then um share it to the public
03:38 - yeah okay um
03:42 - yeah right now it looks really good and
03:44 - um
03:46 - probably in the future you could add
03:47 - maybe some more levels
03:49 - and like a coin system with what we
03:51 - learned today with the background
03:53 - sprite interaction or like just
03:55 - background interaction in general
03:58 - i would like to share a project that i
04:00 - made yeah
04:01 - of course okay everyone who wants to
04:05 - share
04:05 - um is welcome to share so
04:08 - was that you um yeah
04:11 - [Music]
04:13 - okay one second let me go ask my dad if
04:16 - i can change
04:30 - thank you
04:52 - [Music]
04:54 - oh
05:00 - um
05:03 - hello for those who maybe join a little
05:06 - after my
05:08 - lesson
05:11 - let me go
05:15 - i made this new project called on a run
05:20 - good name okay
05:34 - the problem is that it's not running
05:37 - properly it's like just teleporting
05:39 - there
05:40 - um um
05:43 - so you did a move 30 steps 300 steps
05:47 - sorry
05:49 - yeah oh i think i have
05:52 - the solution so on your left
05:55 - you can probably see a block of code
05:58 - that says glide
05:59 - blank second or like glide one second to
06:01 - and then position
06:04 - glide one second to random position oh
06:07 - not to random position
06:08 - on the one that says glide one second
06:10 - two x
06:12 - um so not that one the one under
06:16 - the one underneath that one
06:20 - the one that says glide one second to x
06:22 - 107 and y
06:24 - negative 146
06:29 - so you actually want to use um
06:34 - the line of code that's at the bottom
06:37 - um go back to your left
06:42 - and then go to the one below the glide
06:44 - to random position
06:49 - yeah the glide to
06:52 - an n coordinate
06:59 - and then um choose the coordinate that
07:03 - you wanted your character to stop
07:08 - at the coordinate
07:11 - yeah um so the coordinate is the one
07:14 - that says x and then y if you go
07:18 - to your right and it's a sprite and then
07:21 - you go walking yeah to the right of that
07:26 - um you'll see x and then y and then
07:29 - you'll see negative
07:30 - 204 negative 137 yeah
07:34 - um drag your character
07:37 - to where you wanted your character to go
07:41 - i want my character to go like
07:44 - here and then stop okay so then that
07:48 - would be
07:48 - um if you look down at the coordinates
07:50 - again 168
07:52 - for x and then negative 141 for y
08:10 - 441
08:13 - [Music]
08:18 - where do you want me to put the block of
08:20 - code um
08:21 - put it right where move 300 steps
08:24 - is like right under it or right above it
08:28 - um where it is so you can actually take
08:30 - that out um you can
08:31 - take the move 300 steps out
08:38 - okay
08:42 - [Music]
08:44 - and if you want your characters to
08:46 - always start from the beginning
08:48 - yeah you can do the when the flag is
08:51 - clicked
08:52 - go to and then the coordinates that they
08:55 - start off at
08:56 - so the coordinates that the um
09:01 - red one or the orange one whichever one
09:03 - you're clicking
09:04 - would be negative 186 negative 147 and
09:07 - you want your character to start
09:08 - there so go to the um your left
09:12 - again go down
09:16 - a bit oh you know sorry it's right there
09:20 - um it's under go to random position
09:27 - you go up um not that one
09:31 - if you go from there yeah go to and then
09:34 - x
09:34 - and y put it right under the first block
09:38 - so right under when flag is clicked
09:41 - or yeah that's a good place for it
09:46 - and the coordinates already in there so
09:47 - you don't actually have to change
09:48 - anything
09:50 - and then do the same thing for
09:54 - the other one okay
09:57 - as well
10:10 - [Music]
10:13 - [Applause]
10:18 - yeah you don't need to change um that
10:19 - number since
10:22 - the character is already at the position
10:25 - unless you wanted your character to go
10:27 - somewhere else
10:28 - no that's good okay so you don't need to
10:32 - change any of the
10:33 - coordinates for that and then what
10:36 - is it for the top yeah go to and then
10:40 - you have to move your character back to
10:42 - where you wanted them to start off
10:44 - yeah so let's see
10:47 - um that's gonna be it
10:53 - and then that would be negative 205.
11:09 - and negative seventy-one
11:26 - uh
11:32 - [Music]
11:37 - i'm making it like a tiny clip
11:42 - i'm making like i'm making it like a
11:44 - really short video
11:46 - oh a short video yeah
11:49 - okay so um do you have
11:52 - what you want to happen next already
11:54 - planned
11:58 - like what the next video is gonna be
12:00 - yeah
12:01 - like is is this video complete yeah
12:04 - oh okay awesome so i guess you can start
12:08 - working on
12:14 - hopefully that saved i think it did
12:20 - [Music]
12:21 - okay don't tell me it didn't save yes
12:26 - awesome
12:29 - yeah whenever i click it it just always
12:31 - saves it for me
12:33 - okay that's good i was just a little
12:35 - worried there
12:44 - yeah i think so i'm like brainstorming
12:47 - what the next episode is gonna be right
12:49 - now
12:50 - all right so once you have that done um
12:54 - what it's called brainstorming for your
12:56 - code i think it's called pseudocoding
12:59 - so what you're doing right now is
13:01 - pseudocode where you think of what you
13:02 - want to do and then you think of the
13:05 - code
13:06 - like the basic code outline that you
13:07 - think will do it you try it out
13:09 - and then um there probably will be some
13:12 - issues
13:13 - if it's rough it's a rough code and then
13:16 - the next process would be debugging the
13:18 - code
13:18 - and then fixing it so that it works the
13:20 - way you want it to so right now
13:22 - um it's good you're in the
13:23 - pseudo-quitting step
13:27 - let's go um
13:31 - olivia or dylan
13:34 - or anyone else does anyone
13:37 - else want to share their project
13:48 - um no one else wants to share a project
13:52 - or like a game that they're working on
13:55 - or something they've done in the past
14:02 - if not then we could probably end the
14:05 - class
14:05 - here since i um unless anyone has
14:09 - questions
14:09 - about what i talk today with motions and
14:14 - sensing
14:17 - okay so next class is tomorrow
14:21 - um at 4 p.m still 4 p.m pacific standard
14:24 - time
14:25 - we'll be learning about sound um which
14:28 - would be a really good touch
14:29 - for games
14:32 - so i'll just see you guys then and then
14:35 - we'll send out a reminder
14:37 - for today and also tomorrow thank you
14:42 - guys
14:45 - bye

Cleaned transcript:

okay so 15 minutes is up um does anyone want to share one of their projects or the product that they were working on um can i share my project yes of course yeah um yeah i should have given you the

to put the block of code um put it right where move 300 steps is like right under it or right above it um where it is so you can actually take that out um you can take the move 300 steps out okay and if you want your characters to always start from the beginning yeah you can do the when the flag is clicked go to and then the coordinates that they start off at so the coordinates that the um red one or the orange one whichever one you're clicking would be negative 186 negative 147 and you want your character to start there so go to the um your left again go down a bit oh you know sorry it's right there um it's under go to random position you go up um not that one if you go from there yeah go to and then x and y put it right under the first block so right under when flag is clicked or yeah that's a good place for it and the coordinates already in there so you don't actually have to change anything and then do the same thing for the other one okay as well yeah you don't need to change um that number since the character is already at the position unless you wanted your character to go somewhere else no that's good okay so you don't need to change any of the coordinates for that and then what is it for the top yeah go to and then you have to move your character back to where you wanted them to start off yeah so let's see um that's gonna be it and then that would be negative 205. and negative seventyone uh i'm making it like a tiny clip i'm making like i'm making it like a really short video oh a short video yeah okay so um do you have what you want to happen next already planned like what the next video is gonna be yeah like is is this video complete yeah oh okay awesome so i guess you can start working on hopefully that saved i think it did okay don't tell me it
