00:00 - development today we'll be covering what
00:02 - web dev is
00:04 - what is web dev well it's a process of
00:07 - creating websites like a single web page
00:09 - or creating web apps or games
00:13 - how do websites work when you access the
00:16 - internet you probably use something
00:17 - called a browser like google chrome or
00:19 - safari
00:20 - these browsers are what we call clients
00:22 - client center request website files from
00:24 - a server
00:25 - so that they can display the site
00:30 - what's the difference between client
00:32 - side and server side
00:34 - well client side oops well client side
00:38 - is the side of the website that you see
00:40 - when you visit sites like google
00:41 - yahoo or youtube any changes that you
00:45 - make to the client side webpage
00:47 - will make changes to what's what gets
00:49 - displayed on other devices
00:52 - server side is the side of the website
00:54 - that the server sees
00:55 - this is where your website files will be
00:57 - located
01:08 - what is html html stands for hypertext
01:12 - markup language and it's used to create
01:14 - and arrange things like
01:15 - text images and videos it's like the
01:19 - foundation of your website and it's what
01:22 - gets displayed
01:23 - to users
01:26 - that's what you're editing and i'll show
01:28 - you how that works
01:30 - um what is css it stands for cascading
01:32 - style sheets
01:33 - um it's to kind of edit the elements
01:37 - that
01:37 - you added on the html file to make it
01:39 - look prettier
01:41 - right like this slide
01:44 - the example is very bare there's no font
01:48 - there's no styling but with css
01:51 - which is cascading style sheets for
01:53 - short it makes it look really pretty
01:55 - and you could also work on like
01:58 - margins website layout
02:02 - all that stuff with css and here's an
02:05 - example of how that works
02:06 - so it's it looks a lot better than
02:09 - just black and white right and
02:13 - so now we have javascript um
02:16 - it's added it's used to add
02:18 - functionality and to change the behavior
02:20 - of websites
02:21 - and so it could be as simple as like
02:25 - a click of a button on the website right
02:28 - your to make that button work you have
02:30 - to use javascript
02:32 - right or to make it modify something
02:34 - that's on the web
02:36 - page or give you data you need a you
02:39 - need javascript right
02:41 - and um to get
02:45 - into apis which we'll get into later
02:47 - which is
02:48 - fetching data from another server
02:52 - um you need javascript for that you need
02:54 - ajax or
02:55 - fetch but those are both javascript
02:58 - things um some examples like
03:03 - you could get the time that's stored on
03:04 - your computer
03:06 - using this this is a function
03:09 - and then you could run the function
03:13 - and make it display the time
03:26 - upload account you can just create new
03:32 - and then make sure this is html and css
03:35 - javascript
03:36 - and we can name this let's just name
03:38 - this demo
03:39 - um i'm going to create the replit
03:44 - are you
03:53 - um okay so these are
03:56 - tags uh
04:00 - we have things like head
04:03 - meta link
04:10 - man let's go to these demos
04:24 - okay so you could put this on the bottom
04:29 - um i like to always put it on the top
04:33 - but i'll show you how you can do that
04:35 - later
04:36 - and so these this file all the elements
04:40 - get
04:40 - added from top to bottom right and
04:44 - the head tag anything that's within the
04:46 - head tag
04:48 - it's not going to be displayed on your
04:49 - website except the title
04:52 - um which is going to be this one and
04:54 - that's going to be displayed
04:56 - on the tab right and the body
04:59 - is what actually gets displayed on your
05:02 - website
05:04 - and so we have some important tags
05:07 - and i'll show you how they get displayed
05:09 - on the website
05:16 - see we have hello so if i
05:20 - man if i decided to put this in head
05:23 - it wouldn't pop up because nothing on
05:26 - head gets just
05:28 - okay never mind okay but
05:32 - you don't want to put anything in head
05:34 - head is basically what
05:36 - for all your imports and stuff like that
05:38 - and the body is what
05:41 - gets displayed in your website right and
05:43 - so we have some common tags here here's
05:45 - div
05:46 - e um
05:50 - image
06:03 - i'll stewie is
06:08 - okay so these are some commonly used
06:11 - uh tags um div is used a lot
06:14 - um actually i guess i should show you
06:18 - something first
06:20 - so in html all the elements
06:23 - which is stuff like div is um
06:27 - in a box right all these all these like
06:30 - this layer yeah for every element
06:33 - they're all boxes
06:34 - if that makes any sense and i'll show
06:35 - you what i mean um i'll set this to
06:38 - id
06:42 - right i'll show you what id means later
06:44 - as well
06:45 - but let's just set this
06:48 - okay
06:54 - you don't have to worry about what i'm
06:56 - doing
06:57 - i'm just trying to show you that
07:01 - these are rectangles and
07:04 - um
07:12 - all right so can you see that these are
07:16 - all rectangles it doesn't matter
07:17 - what the dimensions are
07:20 - they would always be rectangled
07:24 - and so you have to keep that in mind and
07:27 - um
07:28 - elements like to be added from top to
07:31 - bottom where they kind of stack up on
07:32 - top of each other
07:34 - um they very rarely want to go from left
07:38 - to right
07:39 - and so if you want to do that you'd have
07:41 - to do that with a
07:43 - css file but i'll show you what a couple
07:46 - of these
07:47 - common image tags do
07:51 - um this is a paragraph tab and so
07:54 - you can just write a bunch of things in
07:56 - here and it'll get displayed
08:00 - all right let me actually get rid of
08:01 - this box
08:05 - all right so we have a bunch of text
08:06 - like that gets displayed
08:09 - um the image tag is pretty cool because
08:11 - you could actually
08:13 - um get images from
08:17 - other websites so let's say i were to
08:20 - want to get an image of a bagel
08:24 - right go to images
08:29 - let's get this photo right here it
08:32 - doesn't look very appetizing
08:34 - but
08:37 - and if we were to get
08:41 - this photo and then
08:44 - put it into here
08:48 - we would see
08:52 - wow that's very big but yeah we see the
08:55 - photo
08:56 - of the bagel
09:02 - and it's very large so if you want to
09:06 - edit the size of that you're going to
09:07 - have to do that
09:08 - on the css file
09:11 - um we got the link
09:15 - not one second
09:32 - one second i'm sorry
09:50 - okay so now we're gonna work on
09:53 - inspecting element now that we know what
09:55 - those basic tags are
09:58 - um actually wait i haven't i haven't
10:00 - showed you all the tags yet
10:01 - let me finish sharing those really quick
10:05 - and then so now that we got the image
10:07 - tag out of the way
10:09 - um actually it should
10:12 - i didn't show you what the source tag
10:14 - did the source tag is really important
10:16 - or the source um
10:18 - just the source yeah you need the source
10:20 - for the image right now this could be a
10:22 - local file that's saved on your
10:25 - hosting service or your desktop um
10:29 - it's basically it could either be the
10:32 - folder that
10:34 - contains all these three files html css
10:37 - and javascript files
10:39 - or it could be a url either
10:42 - they both work right um
10:46 - now we have uh the link
10:50 - the link is really important because
10:52 - it's right here
10:53 - link and script
10:56 - this works here okay it works um
11:00 - these are really important because the
11:02 - link is to import your css file
11:05 - and we could see that in the link right
11:07 - here and then
11:09 - the script allows you to import your
11:11 - javascript file
11:12 - and then these are the headers
11:15 - now the headers are important because
11:19 - your website kind of gets ranked on your
11:21 - headers as well
11:24 - ranking means like how high up
11:28 - your website is is on like the google
11:31 - results right
11:33 - and then so if we have a header of hello
11:37 - and then so there's headers one through
11:39 - six
11:41 - and they basically work like that now
11:44 - header 1
11:45 - is bigger than header 6 and header 1 is
11:47 - usually reserved for the title of your
11:49 - website
11:51 - and then we have span which is basically
11:53 - like another text box
11:56 - i'll show you that right here
12:02 - okay
12:06 - all right now let's do the uh inspect
12:08 - element
12:11 - i think that'd be good
12:16 - all right so i'm gonna send you guys
12:20 - the link for the inspect element
12:26 - so we have the weather website and we
12:29 - have
12:30 - this website oh
12:34 - they're both the same size okay i'll
12:37 - send it to you guys
12:38 - in the chat
12:42 - i don't know if i can get this thing to
12:50 - work
13:03 - um i don't know why it's not showing up
13:06 - for me
13:11 - oh here we go okay so
13:14 - here's a link to the weather and then
13:18 - here's a link to the disney
13:21 - website and so we're going to work on
13:23 - the weatherworks
13:25 - uh weather website first
13:29 - and uh it's going to be pretty cool
13:33 - so once you guys open that all up we'll
13:36 - get started
13:47 - okay so this website right here
13:52 - um it runs on the same three files
13:55 - that i mentioned before html css and
13:59 - javascript
14:00 - and so whatever
14:03 - whatever is being displayed on the
14:05 - website that you can see right now
14:07 - it's because of html and uh
14:10 - css for styling and so
14:13 - that means that whatever you edit will
14:16 - also be an
14:17 - edit to the html file right which in
14:20 - turn edits what it displays
14:22 - and so now when we inspect element on
14:24 - certain elements of the page
14:26 - we can kind of mess around with what
14:30 - a website displays and you might have
14:32 - done this for
14:34 - i don't know your grades to show off or
14:36 - something
14:37 - but um in case you don't know we'll go
14:39 - over it and we'll
14:41 - kind of go over how it works
14:44 - and so let's say i want to change the
14:46 - weather to
14:48 - 400 degrees right um
14:51 - we see a span here which is what i kind
14:53 - of showed you on the replit
14:55 - right here the span right
15:00 - and we know that it's a text container
15:03 - and so we could change this
15:05 - to be something like 400 and then
15:08 - it gets displayed right because we're
15:10 - editing the html file which
15:13 - edits what we see on the on the website
15:16 - right
15:24 - and then so let's say we want to change
15:27 - this
15:28 - video or this image
15:32 - is this a video oh it's an image
15:36 - okay let's say i want to change this to
15:37 - the bagel image right
15:41 - um let's see let's look for that bagel
15:44 - image again
15:47 - that's how you get the same image right
15:49 - here
15:51 - and there is a new tab copy this
16:07 - is so we see the source
16:10 - that's what i showed you before the
16:12 - source is really important because
16:14 - um it's
16:17 - where your file is going to be sourced
16:20 - from i'm not sure why this isn't working
16:24 - but i'll show you an example of that on
16:26 - another website
16:29 - um
16:33 - so yeah i mean you could edit basically
16:36 - any text or any image on the site
16:39 - you could say connect with them
16:42 - i don't know and then um
16:45 - let's see if we could do something fun
16:47 - with this are you guys all following
16:49 - along by the way
16:50 - i don't know if you guys are but it's a
16:52 - good idea too
16:57 - so now let's move over to the uh disney
16:59 - site
17:00 - and then so let's try and change this
17:02 - image to the big website i'm pretty sure
17:04 - this will work
17:08 - let's move over here
17:13 - okay span
17:16 - here is the image source
17:21 - okay there we go how do you guys like
17:24 - that i
17:25 - oh wait okay
17:28 - wait hold up hold up that was actually
17:30 - really cool i like that
17:32 - let's let's leave it at that okay so now
17:36 - i know we have
17:37 - a bagel so we we changed the image using
17:40 - the image tag right
17:43 - the really use an image tag
17:47 - and then if you want to change this to
17:50 - um this one's actually pretty cool
17:54 - because
17:54 - when you click stream now it takes you
17:56 - another website right
17:58 - let's see if we could change that to do
18:01 - something else
18:02 - oh okay so an a tag
18:05 - is basically saying um
18:09 - move me to this page or something like
18:12 - that right
18:12 - so it's basically telling you to move to
18:15 - another page it's like an action
18:17 - you could say um if we wanted changes to
18:20 - move to
18:21 - google.com we could very much
18:25 - do that um let me see right now
18:31 - oops
18:35 - okay let's change this
18:38 - to google.com
18:42 - right if we click it now
18:45 - okay i think we're gonna need https
19:02 - okay so now when we click this it's
19:04 - going to take us to google
19:05 - and so it just shows you like
19:09 - you could literally edit anything on
19:11 - whatever website
19:13 - but it only shows up for you and the
19:15 - reason why that is because
19:17 - you're on the client side the server is
19:19 - set up so that it doesn't take changes
19:22 - that you make on the website
19:24 - so i mean if that was the case if we
19:27 - were allowed to make changes on whatever
19:28 - website we wanted that was that would be
19:30 - a huge security issue
19:32 - um let's see my chats
19:38 - you guys have any questions so far
19:45 - you did not get the link okay
19:50 - okay
19:54 - um i don't know if we're supposed to go
19:56 - back yet
20:10 - do you guys follow along okay
20:19 - yes yeah that was pretty cool
20:23 - okay sounds good
20:26 - um
20:31 - when i'm gonna spend a couple more
20:34 - minutes on the replay
20:36 - and then we'll head over and watch this
20:37 - last video
20:44 - okay so i'll kind of show you a quick
20:47 - demo
20:48 - of javascript and um
20:51 - css so let's say i have a button here
20:54 - now button's also a tag
20:56 - and i say click me right
20:59 - you'll have a button called click me now
21:02 - if i give us an id
21:03 - and an id is basically a way for
21:06 - an element to be identified right so
21:11 - if i had a thousand button elements if i
21:14 - if i just say hey
21:16 - when i click a button you know do this
21:19 - or that
21:20 - because you can't do that because you
21:21 - don't know what button you're talking
21:22 - about right it could be buttons for
21:23 - different functions
21:25 - and so we would give these ids
21:30 - a unique name right so we'd say
21:34 - um color button
21:37 - right now whatever
21:41 - id you give to any element here
21:44 - it automatically allows you to retrieve
21:46 - it from the javascript file in the css
21:48 - file
21:49 - you can see an example of the css one
21:52 - right here when it says
21:54 - box oh
21:58 - i think we are done for the day but um
22:03 - yeah i hope you guys
22:06 - learned something um
22:10 - i think they're closing the breaker
22:15 - now
22:19 - but in the meantime i guess i could
22:20 - finish this off
22:23 - um so
22:26 - we have uh okay well i guess we have to
22:28 - go now all right thanks guys

development today we'll be covering what web dev is what is web dev well it's a process of creating websites like a single web page or creating web apps or games how do websites work when you access the internet you probably use something called a browser like google chrome or safari these browsers are what we call clients client center request website files from a server so that they can display the site what's the difference between client side and server side well client side oops well client side is the side of the website that you see when you visit sites like google yahoo or youtube any changes that you make to the client side webpage will make changes to what's what gets displayed on other devices server side is the side of the website that the server sees this is where your website files will be located what is html html stands for hypertext markup language and it's used to create and arrange things like text images and videos it's like the foundation of your website and it's what gets displayed to users that's what you're editing and i'll show you how that works um what is css it stands for cascading style sheets um it's to kind of edit the elements that you added on the html file to make it look prettier right like this slide the example is very bare there's no font there's no styling but with css which is cascading style sheets for short it makes it look really pretty and you could also work on like margins website layout all that stuff with css and here's an example of how that works so it's it looks a lot better than just black and white right and so now we have javascript um it's added it's used to add functionality and to change the behavior of websites and so it could be as simple as like a click of a button on the website right your to make that button work you have to use javascript right or to make it modify something that's on the web page or give you data you need a you need javascript right and um to get into apis which we'll get into later which is fetching data from another server um you need javascript for that you need ajax or fetch but those are both javascript things um some examples like you could get the time that's stored on your computer using this this is a function and then you could run the function and make it display the time upload account you can just create new and then make sure this is html and css javascript and we can name this let's just name this demo um i'm going to create the replit are you um okay so these are tags uh we have things like head meta link man let's go to these demos okay so you could put this on the bottom um i like to always put it on the top but i'll show you how you can do that later and so these this file all the elements get added from top to bottom right and the head tag anything that's within the head tag it's not going to be displayed on your website except the title um which is going to be this one and that's going to be displayed on the tab right and the body is what actually gets displayed on your website and so we have some important tags and i'll show you how they get displayed on the website see we have hello so if i man if i decided to put this in head it wouldn't pop up because nothing on head gets just okay never mind okay but you don't want to put anything in head head is basically what for all your imports and stuff like that and the body is what gets displayed in your website right and so we have some common tags here here's div e um image i'll stewie is okay so these are some commonly used uh tags um div is used a lot um actually i guess i should show you something first so in html all the elements which is stuff like div is um in a box right all these all these like this layer yeah for every element they're all boxes if that makes any sense and i'll show you what i mean um i'll set this to id right i'll show you what id means later as well but let's just set this okay you don't have to worry about what i'm doing i'm just trying to show you that these are rectangles and um all right so can you see that these are all rectangles it doesn't matter what the dimensions are they would always be rectangled and so you have to keep that in mind and um elements like to be added from top to bottom where they kind of stack up on top of each other um they very rarely want to go from left to right and so if you want to do that you'd have to do that with a css file but i'll show you what a couple of these common image tags do um this is a paragraph tab and so you can just write a bunch of things in here and it'll get displayed all right let me actually get rid of this box all right so we have a bunch of text like that gets displayed um the image tag is pretty cool because you could actually um get images from other websites so let's say i were to want to get an image of a bagel right go to images let's get this photo right here it doesn't look very appetizing but and if we were to get this photo and then put it into here we would see wow that's very big but yeah we see the photo of the bagel and it's very large so if you want to edit the size of that you're going to have to do that on the css file um we got the link not one second one second i'm sorry okay so now we're gonna work on inspecting element now that we know what those basic tags are um actually wait i haven't i haven't showed you all the tags yet let me finish sharing those really quick and then so now that we got the image tag out of the way um actually it should i didn't show you what the source tag did the source tag is really important or the source um just the source yeah you need the source for the image right now this could be a local file that's saved on your hosting service or your desktop um it's basically it could either be the folder that contains all these three files html css and javascript files or it could be a url either they both work right um now we have uh the link the link is really important because it's right here link and script this works here okay it works um these are really important because the link is to import your css file and we could see that in the link right here and then the script allows you to import your javascript file and then these are the headers now the headers are important because your website kind of gets ranked on your headers as well ranking means like how high up your website is is on like the google results right and then so if we have a header of hello and then so there's headers one through six and they basically work like that now header 1 is bigger than header 6 and header 1 is usually reserved for the title of your website and then we have span which is basically like another text box i'll show you that right here okay all right now let's do the uh inspect element i think that'd be good all right so i'm gonna send you guys the link for the inspect element so we have the weather website and we have this website oh they're both the same size okay i'll send it to you guys in the chat i don't know if i can get this thing to work um i don't know why it's not showing up for me oh here we go okay so here's a link to the weather and then here's a link to the disney website and so we're going to work on the weatherworks uh weather website first and uh it's going to be pretty cool so once you guys open that all up we'll get started okay so this website right here um it runs on the same three files that i mentioned before html css and javascript and so whatever whatever is being displayed on the website that you can see right now it's because of html and uh css for styling and so that means that whatever you edit will also be an edit to the html file right which in turn edits what it displays and so now when we inspect element on certain elements of the page we can kind of mess around with what a website displays and you might have done this for i don't know your grades to show off or something but um in case you don't know we'll go over it and we'll kind of go over how it works and so let's say i want to change the weather to 400 degrees right um we see a span here which is what i kind of showed you on the replit right here the span right and we know that it's a text container and so we could change this to be something like 400 and then it gets displayed right because we're editing the html file which edits what we see on the on the website right and then so let's say we want to change this video or this image is this a video oh it's an image okay let's say i want to change this to the bagel image right um let's see let's look for that bagel image again that's how you get the same image right here and there is a new tab copy this is so we see the source that's what i showed you before the source is really important because um it's where your file is going to be sourced from i'm not sure why this isn't working but i'll show you an example of that on another website um so yeah i mean you could edit basically any text or any image on the site you could say connect with them i don't know and then um let's see if we could do something fun with this are you guys all following along by the way i don't know if you guys are but it's a good idea too so now let's move over to the uh disney site and then so let's try and change this image to the big website i'm pretty sure this will work let's move over here okay span here is the image source okay there we go how do you guys like that i oh wait okay wait hold up hold up that was actually really cool i like that let's let's leave it at that okay so now i know we have a bagel so we we changed the image using the image tag right the really use an image tag and then if you want to change this to um this one's actually pretty cool because when you click stream now it takes you another website right let's see if we could change that to do something else oh okay so an a tag is basically saying um move me to this page or something like that right so it's basically telling you to move to another page it's like an action you could say um if we wanted changes to move to google.com we could very much do that um let me see right now oops okay let's change this to google.com right if we click it now okay i think we're gonna need https okay so now when we click this it's going to take us to google and so it just shows you like you could literally edit anything on whatever website but it only shows up for you and the reason why that is because you're on the client side the server is set up so that it doesn't take changes that you make on the website so i mean if that was the case if we were allowed to make changes on whatever website we wanted that was that would be a huge security issue um let's see my chats you guys have any questions so far you did not get the link okay okay um i don't know if we're supposed to go back yet do you guys follow along okay yes yeah that was pretty cool okay sounds good um when i'm gonna spend a couple more minutes on the replay and then we'll head over and watch this last video okay so i'll kind of show you a quick demo of javascript and um css so let's say i have a button here now button's also a tag and i say click me right you'll have a button called click me now if i give us an id and an id is basically a way for an element to be identified right so if i had a thousand button elements if i if i just say hey when i click a button you know do this or that because you can't do that because you don't know what button you're talking about right it could be buttons for different functions and so we would give these ids a unique name right so we'd say um color button right now whatever id you give to any element here it automatically allows you to retrieve it from the javascript file in the css file you can see an example of the css one right here when it says box oh i think we are done for the day but um yeah i hope you guys learned something um i think they're closing the breaker now but in the meantime i guess i could finish this off um so we have uh okay well i guess we have to go now all right thanks guys
