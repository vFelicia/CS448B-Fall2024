With timestamps:

00:02 - hello
00:11 - so today we're talking about sound
00:15 - um that you can add to your game it's
00:18 - like
00:20 - mostly aesthetic reasons but i think it
00:23 - brings a lot of depth
00:24 - into your game and um i think it would
00:27 - be a good idea to
00:28 - have that in your game as well it also
00:31 - ties into
00:32 - a lot of what we're talking about
00:34 - yesterday and the class before
00:36 - about sensing and like the if loop
00:39 - so yeah here we go
00:44 - going to share my screen
00:52 - okay so let's look inside
00:56 - the code that we were working on
01:10 - yesterday
01:12 - okay so as you can see on the left here
01:15 - we have code costumes and sound
01:18 - um what we're going to be looking at
01:19 - today will be the sounds
01:22 - and uh it's basically the same thing as
01:25 - sprite or backdrop you can go over here
01:27 - look for sounds in the database
01:29 - record your own sounds choose a random
01:32 - sound or upload a sound that you already
01:34 - have on your computer
01:35 - so the sound that they give us as a
01:37 - default is the meow sound
01:39 - because um the default sprite they give
01:41 - us is a cat
01:42 - um you can hit the play button to
01:45 - hear what it sounds like
01:48 - and you can also alter the sounds here
01:51 - um
01:52 - with things like making it faster slower
01:55 - louder more quiet you can mute the sound
01:59 - um and then fade in fade out you can
02:02 - make the sound go backwards or you can
02:04 - make it
02:06 - robotic
02:08 - so um yeah
02:11 - you can just alter the sound like that
02:13 - and it'll be inside
02:14 - your database or your scratch codes
02:18 - um you can also go here choose sounds
02:20 - and like choose music to put in the back
02:22 - of your game
02:23 - so if you go over here to loops
02:26 - basically these um
02:30 - these oh my gosh um
02:37 - that's not
02:48 - okay
02:54 - okay um you take these like
02:58 - loops and then when you loop them
03:00 - throughout your code you'll have
03:02 - background music for your code
03:04 - so if you go over here like hover over
03:07 - it or like press the play button
03:12 - it just plays like music and then you
03:14 - can loop it so then that'll always play
03:16 - during your game
03:17 - and i'll show you guys how to do that
03:19 - right now um
03:21 - so here you have your cat you can make
03:24 - it play a sound whenever you you know
03:27 - touch something
03:28 - or anything um
03:32 - let's say our cat makes a sound every
03:36 - time it touches the sun
03:38 - so we already have code down here for
03:39 - what happens when it touches the sun
03:42 - um we switch the costume to a red cat
03:45 - and then we also stop everything but
03:47 - before that we can also make it play a
03:49 - sound
03:50 - so let's go to sounds here
03:54 - and then we can play sound this
03:57 - until done and let's make it
04:00 - now okay so now when we're starting the
04:04 - code
04:05 - or walking towards the sun and then
04:08 - the sound plays when we touch it and
04:11 - then it also turns red because that's
04:12 - what it says in a code
04:14 - and then our code also stops so that's
04:17 - how you put
04:18 - sound in um the difference between the
04:20 - play sound until dawn
04:22 - and the star sound is that playing sound
04:25 - until done
04:26 - means that however long your sound is
04:29 - over here
04:30 - it'll play until completion and
04:34 - it won't stop in the middle if you do
04:36 - start sound
04:37 - um it'll start sometimes it'll
04:40 - complete all the way to the end and
04:42 - sometimes it won't it really depends on
04:43 - your code
04:44 - if you say if my cat is touching the sun
04:48 - start the sound and you are constantly
04:51 - touching the sun
04:53 - then the sound will always replay from
04:55 - the beginning because it always sees you
04:57 - touching the sun
04:58 - um as the first time you touch the sun
05:01 - so then
05:02 - the sound will always start from the
05:03 - beginning does that make sense
05:07 - um does anyone have any questions or
05:09 - like thumbs up if you understand
05:13 - anything
05:16 - don't understand thumbs up
05:20 - if you don't understand maybe do a
05:23 - thumbs down
05:24 - okay seems like everyone understands
05:27 - so yeah and then i'll
05:30 - show you guys how to make a music loop
05:33 - in your
05:34 - game this might be a little loud but you
05:36 - can also adjust
05:38 - the sound if you go over here i'm going
05:40 - to use the bossa nova music
05:42 - but it's kind of loud so i'll just make
05:45 - it softer
05:52 - sorry hold on
06:10 - okay sorry about that um
06:14 - back to the music here we made it a
06:17 - little softer
06:19 - and then we can go into the code and for
06:22 - events we'll make a separate one that
06:24 - says
06:24 - when green flag is clicked over here
06:28 - and then our forever loop because we
06:30 - want
06:31 - um our music to loop as long as we're
06:33 - running the game
06:35 - and then for sounds we want to play
06:37 - until it's done or else it'll sound
06:39 - really weird and glitchy
06:41 - so from the beginning now we have the
06:43 - bossa nova music in the background
06:51 - and then we have the same sound where we
06:53 - touch the sun
06:55 - and then everything stops so
06:59 - that's basically it on sounds remember
07:02 - different ways you can get sound
07:03 - is to look in the database and you can
07:05 - search something up
07:06 - uh you can record your own sound if you
07:08 - don't have anything in the database that
07:11 - you would like to use
07:12 - or you can get a random sound or upload
07:14 - your own sound
07:16 - so is there any more
07:20 - questions about sound
07:25 - okay well i'll just also talk about this
07:28 - you can
07:28 - affect the sound inside the code instead
07:31 - of doing it outside of the code
07:33 - um like if something happens that makes
07:35 - your sound
07:36 - go up a pitch in your game you can do
07:38 - change the pitch effect by
07:40 - and then a number so the positive number
07:43 - will
07:44 - change the pitch to go higher so it'll
07:46 - be a higher pitch
07:47 - it'll be more squeaky a negative number
07:50 - will make it lower
07:51 - and like you know lower
07:54 - so you can also set the pitch um
07:58 - i think 100 is the normal and then a
08:00 - pitch higher than that would be
08:03 - like over 100 and then picture lower
08:06 - would be
08:07 - lower than 100 um same thing with volume
08:11 - if you use a positive number the volume
08:13 - will increase
08:14 - and get louder use a negative volume
08:16 - it'll become quieter
08:18 - and then set volume percentage is the
08:20 - same 100 is the normal percent
08:23 - um but if you want to set it like two
08:25 - times you do like 200
08:27 - or like 50 for half the volume
08:30 - and yeah you can also show your volume
08:34 - on the side here
08:35 - that's the volume it is that right now
08:38 - the normal volume okay
08:40 - so does anyone have any more questions
08:43 - on sound
08:50 - um thumbs up if you have no questions
08:52 - just so i know
08:57 - or yeah thumbs up you have no questions
09:00 - if you understand everything
09:03 - okay awesome so then it's
09:06 - 4 10 right now um i'll give you guys 15
09:09 - minutes to work a little bit on sound
09:12 - and then after i'll um
09:15 - maybe ask a few of you guys to share and
09:17 - i'll also talk about
09:18 - like some more things that we might use
09:21 - in the future like
09:22 - our events section okay so i'll stop
09:25 - trying
09:31 - okay so 15 minutes
09:35 - uh we'll come back at 4 25.
12:58 - hello for those of you who just um
13:01 - entered we are using
13:04 - 15 minutes to work on just sound effects
13:07 - that we are going to add to our project
13:09 - and we'll come back at 4 25. if you have
13:12 - any questions
13:14 - please message it in the chat and then
13:16 - i'll go over it
24:40 - okay so we have um we should come back
24:44 - now from working
24:48 - um someone asked where's the disappear
24:51 - block
24:52 - um is this for making the sprite
24:54 - disappear
24:55 - because um the sprite disappear would be
24:59 - in the looks block
25:07 - would be in the looks block um
25:15 - here and it says hide
25:19 - and that's how you make your sprite like
25:21 - disappear it just makes your
25:23 - right hide itself
25:38 - okay so the next thing we'll be talking
25:41 - about
25:42 - is the events um we briefly covered this
25:45 - in the beginning but basically they're
25:47 - just
25:48 - um conditions so when
25:51 - something happens and then below it
25:54 - something else
25:55 - will happen so when green flag is
25:57 - clicked our code will start running and
25:59 - this condition has to be met before
26:01 - anything at the bottom
26:02 - um happens at all so you can make
26:06 - when the space key is pressed i don't
26:09 - know make the character change colors
26:11 - and then you can do this
26:12 - throughout the game um you want you
26:15 - don't even need to
26:16 - use these at all unless they are
26:18 - activating your game
26:19 - so um if you have green flag
26:23 - over the code that basically runs your
26:26 - game you
26:27 - have to press it but if space the space
26:30 - key
26:30 - is only something like changing colors
26:32 - then and it's not important for your
26:34 - game
26:35 - you actually don't even need to press it
26:36 - the entire time that you're
26:38 - playing your game so these are um
26:41 - pretty useful for things that you might
26:44 - not want clogging up your
26:46 - regular um area here you can always make
26:50 - duplicates of these and then they'll
26:52 - both happen at the same time because
26:53 - they both have the same condition
26:56 - uh yeah and this will help you organize
26:58 - and
26:59 - also help you do things like changing
27:03 - whatever when something happens
27:07 - okay so we also have this
27:10 - if else if and then a condition
27:14 - then else this happens um
27:17 - this is different from the if statement
27:20 - because
27:20 - it says if this condition happens
27:23 - then um they would do this but if the
27:26 - condition is not met
27:28 - something completely different would
27:29 - happen so
27:31 - if we're talking about points and you
27:33 - wanted your character to get points
27:35 - every time you touch
27:36 - something but you wanted your character
27:38 - to lose points whenever they're not
27:40 - touching
27:41 - that thing you would do if sprite is
27:44 - touching
27:45 - that thing then points would go up
27:48 - else points would constantly be going
27:50 - down when the character is not touching
27:52 - that object
27:54 - um this is
27:58 - um a loop repeat until condition is met
28:02 - in java this would be a while loop
28:06 - while something is happening um keep
28:08 - repeating something
28:10 - um and then while that thing is not
28:12 - happening then the loop will end so
28:14 - it's kind of like a while loop but it's
28:16 - also different because this is
28:18 - waiting for a condition to be met and
28:20 - then the while loop is waiting for a
28:22 - condition to not be met
28:25 - so there are those
28:30 - um we also have our sensing here
28:33 - and all that stuff and we'll talk about
28:37 - a lot of these operators in the future
28:39 - as well as the variables
28:41 - um but yeah now that we've gone over
28:45 - that
28:46 - do you guys have a project that you want
28:48 - to share
28:50 - so um
28:53 - elizabeth and then sammy
28:57 - okay so elizabeth do you want to share
29:00 - okay um
29:04 - yeah you should have permission now
29:09 - thank you i have to get um
29:14 - it's not very impressive but it took a
29:16 - long time
29:17 - yeah no worries if you have any
29:19 - questions i can always help you with
29:21 - those
29:24 - okay
29:27 - i don't know if you can hear the music
29:29 - oh yeah we can hear
29:47 - oh and i see you added points there as
29:49 - well
29:51 - it's not really working really well
29:52 - today but
29:54 - it's fine if you do you have any
29:56 - questions on
29:57 - um some things in the game
30:00 - or like how to code something
30:04 - okay well then um sammy do you want to
30:07 - share next
30:08 - or
30:16 - oh is this your next episode in your
30:18 - game
30:19 - um this is the third one actually the
30:22 - third episode
30:24 - yeah it's pretty cool
30:34 - nice
30:51 - hmm
30:55 - what is the ice dragon there
30:59 - every so when i when the magic spell
31:02 - sound
31:02 - plays the i dragon says no and then it
31:06 - just disappears
31:08 - was the ice dragon there in the
31:10 - beginning
31:12 - um yeah it was
31:15 - i'll i'll show if you want me to if you
31:18 - want to see it again i can show you
31:20 - yeah can you share the screen again yeah
31:29 - oh okay so
31:33 - i need to do something yeah okay
31:45 - yes
32:08 - yay
32:11 - good episode i like that one
32:15 - yeah i made another episode two where
32:19 - um gigan pico meets
32:22 - these other three characters
32:27 - are you planning to make like a whole
32:28 - series with them
32:30 - yeah awesome yeah a lot of people who
32:34 - use
32:34 - scratch like to code um things like
32:37 - drawings or stories and yeah
32:40 - it just shows that scratch isn't only
32:42 - for coding games
32:44 - yeah is there anyone else who
32:47 - wants to share what they've done
32:56 - okay well um
32:59 - it's a little early to end class so i'll
33:02 - probably just talk a little bit about
33:04 - operators
33:05 - um and then we'll use that for
33:09 - next class so operators are
33:14 - you know things like addition
33:16 - subtraction
33:18 - multiplication and division and anything
33:20 - in the shape of an
33:21 - oval is supposed to be an integer or
33:24 - like a number
33:25 - so as you can see here um in this oval
33:29 - they have a number and uh
33:33 - these things are shaped as an oval you
33:34 - can actually put them in
33:36 - the spaces that have ovals in them so
33:38 - you can put it over there
33:39 - and uh that changes a lot of things
33:42 - because you can now
33:43 - like change the things while your code
33:46 - is running
33:47 - by using variables and there are things
33:50 - like pick random
33:51 - which basically picks a random number
33:53 - from one to ten
33:54 - and you can use this to play like to
33:56 - make games like
33:58 - um where you have to enter a number and
34:00 - then
34:01 - a computer enters a number and it could
34:03 - be like if you get the higher number
34:05 - then that was
34:07 - then the one generated by the computer
34:09 - you could win
34:10 - and then you can also change that into
34:11 - something like rock paper scissors
34:13 - where certain numbers mean rough and
34:15 - certain numbers mean paper
34:17 - and then stretching numbers mean scissor
34:19 - and then um
34:20 - play rock paper scissors against the
34:22 - computer which is always
34:24 - really fun to code um
34:27 - the one that are hexagons are boolean so
34:29 - they're true and false
34:31 - if this variable here is greater than 50
34:34 - then the boolean there the boolean value
34:37 - will be true
34:39 - and then when the condition is true as
34:42 - we know
34:42 - usually things below will start to run
34:47 - okay so we talked about those
34:52 - integers booleans and then now we have
34:54 - string which is basically just words
34:56 - um if you join apple and banana you're
35:00 - basically combining the word and you'll
35:01 - get apple banana
35:03 - and then letter one of apple you see it
35:06 - is a
35:07 - oval which means that it is a
35:12 - not okay so it's a variable
35:15 - not um a number
35:19 - um for these cases there are numbers um
35:22 - the ovals actually i made a mistake
35:24 - before when i said it was integers
35:26 - they're actually variables and variables
35:27 - can be both integers
35:29 - and string yeah sami do you have a
35:31 - question
35:33 - operators are mostly math right
35:37 - yeah mostly mostly math for the integers
35:40 - but um in this case they're kind of
35:43 - logic based
35:44 - as well because um the strength here is
35:47 - uh the words here
35:49 - are less math and more like just dealing
35:52 - with words so like joining apple and
35:54 - banana
35:55 - you would get apple banana letter one of
35:57 - apple
35:58 - will return a the length of apple will
36:01 - count the amount of letters in
36:03 - the apple and then return that as a
36:05 - number value which would be five
36:08 - this i don't know word length of apple
36:11 - would be like how long how big a app
36:15 - like the object apple is
36:19 - yeah that um the thing is
36:22 - because the our code has to be really
36:25 - specific
36:26 - when it says length and then a word
36:29 - usually they
36:30 - have to find the length of the word
36:32 - itself because you can type something in
36:33 - here
36:34 - that's not even real like like just run
36:37 - random letters
36:39 - and then if it was calculating the
36:42 - you know the length of that in real life
36:44 - it wouldn't know how to because it
36:46 - doesn't
36:46 - um the thing doesn't exist so when it
36:48 - says length of
36:50 - and then a word what it's talking about
36:52 - is the length of the word itself and not
36:54 - the
36:55 - word the object that the word is
36:58 - referencing
37:01 - so yeah whenever um
37:04 - it says length of something a lot of the
37:08 - time
37:08 - it's counting the amount of objects in
37:11 - the thing so
37:12 - in this case the letters
37:17 - um absolute value
37:21 - i don't know if you learned that in your
37:22 - math class i'm sure you guys did though
37:25 - is um the distance between the numbered
37:28 - given
37:28 - and zero so negative four the distance
37:31 - between negative four and zero would
37:33 - still be four
37:34 - absolute value is basically just a
37:35 - positive value for every number
37:38 - um so if you give 2 the absolute value
37:40 - is 2. negative 2
37:41 - they'll still be 2. that's just what
37:43 - absolute value
37:44 - means um
37:50 - yeah and then we have variables which
37:53 - we'll talk about
37:54 - in our next class so our next class will
37:56 - probably be a little bit longer than
37:58 - this one
38:00 - because can help like score
38:03 - point yeah you can make um let's make
38:06 - the variable right now actually and then
38:08 - i'll talk more about it
38:09 - next class points
38:13 - and then it'll show over there basically
38:15 - it shows you how much points
38:17 - how many points you're getting and
38:20 - you can change it so that it'll give you
38:23 - points whenever you do something
38:27 - and then you use these to you know
38:29 - change your variable
38:31 - set variable to a number change by
38:34 - number and then show up here or hide
38:38 - hide it up there um
38:44 - yeah for variables you can also
38:47 - make it so that they keep track of
38:49 - different things like
38:52 - location so let's say you're walking and
38:56 - you want to walk 10 spaces
38:58 - from wherever you are and then you want
39:00 - something to happen you can make it so
39:02 - that
39:02 - the points go up by 10 while you're
39:04 - walking
39:06 - and then when you reach a certain area
39:09 - it senses that the points um are over
39:13 - a certain number and then something
39:15 - could happen there
39:17 - so yeah points um i mean variables can
39:20 - be used for a lot of different things as
39:22 - long as you know how to use them
39:24 - um so hopefully next class there will be
39:27 - a lot of questions
39:28 - on it and then i can explain a lot on
39:31 - variables
39:33 - so yeah um
39:37 - that's it for today if no one has any
39:39 - more questions
39:43 - um yeah that's it for today then
39:47 - thank you guys for coming bye
39:51 - [Music]
39:53 - bye

Cleaned transcript:

hello so today we're talking about sound um that you can add to your game it's like mostly aesthetic reasons but i think it brings a lot of depth into your game and um i think it would be a good idea to have that in your game as well it also ties into a lot of what we're talking about yesterday and the class before about sensing and like the if loop so yeah here we go going to share my screen okay so let's look inside the code that we were working on yesterday okay so as you can see on the left here we have code costumes and sound um what we're going to be looking at today will be the sounds and uh it's basically the same thing as sprite or backdrop you can go over here look for sounds in the database record your own sounds choose a random sound or upload a sound that you already have on your computer so the sound that they give us as a default is the meow sound because um the default sprite they give us is a cat um you can hit the play button to hear what it sounds like and you can also alter the sounds here um with things like making it faster slower louder more quiet you can mute the sound um and then fade in fade out you can make the sound go backwards or you can make it robotic so um yeah you can just alter the sound like that and it'll be inside your database or your scratch codes um you can also go here choose sounds and like choose music to put in the back of your game so if you go over here to loops basically these um these oh my gosh um that's not okay okay um you take these like loops and then when you loop them throughout your code you'll have background music for your code so if you go over here like hover over it or like press the play button it just plays like music and then you can loop it so then that'll always play during your game and i'll show you guys how to do that right now um so here you have your cat you can make it play a sound whenever you you know touch something or anything um let's say our cat makes a sound every time it touches the sun so we already have code down here for what happens when it touches the sun um we switch the costume to a red cat and then we also stop everything but before that we can also make it play a sound so let's go to sounds here and then we can play sound this until done and let's make it now okay so now when we're starting the code or walking towards the sun and then the sound plays when we touch it and then it also turns red because that's what it says in a code and then our code also stops so that's how you put sound in um the difference between the play sound until dawn and the star sound is that playing sound until done means that however long your sound is over here it'll play until completion and it won't stop in the middle if you do start sound um it'll start sometimes it'll complete all the way to the end and sometimes it won't it really depends on your code if you say if my cat is touching the sun start the sound and you are constantly touching the sun then the sound will always replay from the beginning because it always sees you touching the sun um as the first time you touch the sun so then the sound will always start from the beginning does that make sense um does anyone have any questions or like thumbs up if you understand anything don't understand thumbs up if you don't understand maybe do a thumbs down okay seems like everyone understands so yeah and then i'll show you guys how to make a music loop in your game this might be a little loud but you can also adjust the sound if you go over here i'm going to use the bossa nova music but it's kind of loud so i'll just make it softer sorry hold on okay sorry about that um back to the music here we made it a little softer and then we can go into the code and for events we'll make a separate one that says when green flag is clicked over here and then our forever loop because we want um our music to loop as long as we're running the game and then for sounds we want to play until it's done or else it'll sound really weird and glitchy so from the beginning now we have the bossa nova music in the background and then we have the same sound where we touch the sun and then everything stops so that's basically it on sounds remember different ways you can get sound is to look in the database and you can search something up uh you can record your own sound if you don't have anything in the database that you would like to use or you can get a random sound or upload your own sound so is there any more questions about sound okay well i'll just also talk about this you can affect the sound inside the code instead of doing it outside of the code um like if something happens that makes your sound go up a pitch in your game you can do change the pitch effect by and then a number so the positive number will change the pitch to go higher so it'll be a higher pitch it'll be more squeaky a negative number will make it lower and like you know lower so you can also set the pitch um i think 100 is the normal and then a pitch higher than that would be like over 100 and then picture lower would be lower than 100 um same thing with volume if you use a positive number the volume will increase and get louder use a negative volume it'll become quieter and then set volume percentage is the same 100 is the normal percent um but if you want to set it like two times you do like 200 or like 50 for half the volume and yeah you can also show your volume on the side here that's the volume it is that right now the normal volume okay so does anyone have any more questions on sound um thumbs up if you have no questions just so i know or yeah thumbs up you have no questions if you understand everything okay awesome so then it's 4 10 right now um i'll give you guys 15 minutes to work a little bit on sound and then after i'll um maybe ask a few of you guys to share and i'll also talk about like some more things that we might use in the future like our events section okay so i'll stop trying okay so 15 minutes uh we'll come back at 4 25. hello for those of you who just um entered we are using 15 minutes to work on just sound effects that we are going to add to our project and we'll come back at 4 25. if you have any questions please message it in the chat and then i'll go over it okay so we have um we should come back now from working um someone asked where's the disappear block um is this for making the sprite disappear because um the sprite disappear would be in the looks block would be in the looks block um here and it says hide and that's how you make your sprite like disappear it just makes your right hide itself okay so the next thing we'll be talking about is the events um we briefly covered this in the beginning but basically they're just um conditions so when something happens and then below it something else will happen so when green flag is clicked our code will start running and this condition has to be met before anything at the bottom um happens at all so you can make when the space key is pressed i don't know make the character change colors and then you can do this throughout the game um you want you don't even need to use these at all unless they are activating your game so um if you have green flag over the code that basically runs your game you have to press it but if space the space key is only something like changing colors then and it's not important for your game you actually don't even need to press it the entire time that you're playing your game so these are um pretty useful for things that you might not want clogging up your regular um area here you can always make duplicates of these and then they'll both happen at the same time because they both have the same condition uh yeah and this will help you organize and also help you do things like changing whatever when something happens okay so we also have this if else if and then a condition then else this happens um this is different from the if statement because it says if this condition happens then um they would do this but if the condition is not met something completely different would happen so if we're talking about points and you wanted your character to get points every time you touch something but you wanted your character to lose points whenever they're not touching that thing you would do if sprite is touching that thing then points would go up else points would constantly be going down when the character is not touching that object um this is um a loop repeat until condition is met in java this would be a while loop while something is happening um keep repeating something um and then while that thing is not happening then the loop will end so it's kind of like a while loop but it's also different because this is waiting for a condition to be met and then the while loop is waiting for a condition to not be met so there are those um we also have our sensing here and all that stuff and we'll talk about a lot of these operators in the future as well as the variables um but yeah now that we've gone over that do you guys have a project that you want to share so um elizabeth and then sammy okay so elizabeth do you want to share okay um yeah you should have permission now thank you i have to get um it's not very impressive but it took a long time yeah no worries if you have any questions i can always help you with those okay i don't know if you can hear the music oh yeah we can hear oh and i see you added points there as well it's not really working really well today but it's fine if you do you have any questions on um some things in the game or like how to code something okay well then um sammy do you want to share next or oh is this your next episode in your game um this is the third one actually the third episode yeah it's pretty cool nice hmm what is the ice dragon there every so when i when the magic spell sound plays the i dragon says no and then it just disappears was the ice dragon there in the beginning um yeah it was i'll i'll show if you want me to if you want to see it again i can show you yeah can you share the screen again yeah oh okay so i need to do something yeah okay yes yay good episode i like that one yeah i made another episode two where um gigan pico meets these other three characters are you planning to make like a whole series with them yeah awesome yeah a lot of people who use scratch like to code um things like drawings or stories and yeah it just shows that scratch isn't only for coding games yeah is there anyone else who wants to share what they've done okay well um it's a little early to end class so i'll probably just talk a little bit about operators um and then we'll use that for next class so operators are you know things like addition subtraction multiplication and division and anything in the shape of an oval is supposed to be an integer or like a number so as you can see here um in this oval they have a number and uh these things are shaped as an oval you can actually put them in the spaces that have ovals in them so you can put it over there and uh that changes a lot of things because you can now like change the things while your code is running by using variables and there are things like pick random which basically picks a random number from one to ten and you can use this to play like to make games like um where you have to enter a number and then a computer enters a number and it could be like if you get the higher number then that was then the one generated by the computer you could win and then you can also change that into something like rock paper scissors where certain numbers mean rough and certain numbers mean paper and then stretching numbers mean scissor and then um play rock paper scissors against the computer which is always really fun to code um the one that are hexagons are boolean so they're true and false if this variable here is greater than 50 then the boolean there the boolean value will be true and then when the condition is true as we know usually things below will start to run okay so we talked about those integers booleans and then now we have string which is basically just words um if you join apple and banana you're basically combining the word and you'll get apple banana and then letter one of apple you see it is a oval which means that it is a not okay so it's a variable not um a number um for these cases there are numbers um the ovals actually i made a mistake before when i said it was integers they're actually variables and variables can be both integers and string yeah sami do you have a question operators are mostly math right yeah mostly mostly math for the integers but um in this case they're kind of logic based as well because um the strength here is uh the words here are less math and more like just dealing with words so like joining apple and banana you would get apple banana letter one of apple will return a the length of apple will count the amount of letters in the apple and then return that as a number value which would be five this i don't know word length of apple would be like how long how big a app like the object apple is yeah that um the thing is because the our code has to be really specific when it says length and then a word usually they have to find the length of the word itself because you can type something in here that's not even real like like just run random letters and then if it was calculating the you know the length of that in real life it wouldn't know how to because it doesn't um the thing doesn't exist so when it says length of and then a word what it's talking about is the length of the word itself and not the word the object that the word is referencing so yeah whenever um it says length of something a lot of the time it's counting the amount of objects in the thing so in this case the letters um absolute value i don't know if you learned that in your math class i'm sure you guys did though is um the distance between the numbered given and zero so negative four the distance between negative four and zero would still be four absolute value is basically just a positive value for every number um so if you give 2 the absolute value is 2. negative 2 they'll still be 2. that's just what absolute value means um yeah and then we have variables which we'll talk about in our next class so our next class will probably be a little bit longer than this one because can help like score point yeah you can make um let's make the variable right now actually and then i'll talk more about it next class points and then it'll show over there basically it shows you how much points how many points you're getting and you can change it so that it'll give you points whenever you do something and then you use these to you know change your variable set variable to a number change by number and then show up here or hide hide it up there um yeah for variables you can also make it so that they keep track of different things like location so let's say you're walking and you want to walk 10 spaces from wherever you are and then you want something to happen you can make it so that the points go up by 10 while you're walking and then when you reach a certain area it senses that the points um are over a certain number and then something could happen there so yeah points um i mean variables can be used for a lot of different things as long as you know how to use them um so hopefully next class there will be a lot of questions on it and then i can explain a lot on variables so yeah um that's it for today if no one has any more questions um yeah that's it for today then thank you guys for coming bye bye
