hello humans and welcome back to let's learn python on code with connor i'm adam we're here in the unit 3 project let's get right into it this is going to be a good one so here we are we are going to take uh the user menu that we used earlier in this unit for turtle graphics and we are going to extend it into a drawing program so you'll see my menu choices have uh kind of blown up a little bit so i've got a to q so i've got forward backward left right pen up pen down pen size color draw polygon draw square draw triangle those are familiar draw star draw spyro draw circle clear screen move turtle and quit program all these functions in here now some of them are repeats so we don't have to redo all of our code we can use that base structure to help build what we're going to do here so the nice thing here that it's not just it's not limited to just the shapes we can do manual drawing here as well so i can just move my turtle forward by 200 pixels okay and then i can turn my turtle to the left by 135 degrees and then move my turtle forward 400 pixels and then i can turn my turtle right by 45 degrees and i can go backwards 100 pixels and so you can start to see how i have this manual control now and now i could draw a circle right radius of oh i don't know 200 pixels so we have control over this drawing program so now i can clear my screen oh and it's gone i can move my thing back to zero zero there it goes i can change my color now i did a sub menu for the color choose from the following colors blue red green black orange so let's do orange so now it's orange so if i do a forward by 400 now you can see the lines orange so yeah you kind of get the idea of what we're looking at with this program there's going to be a lot of pieces in terms of what you might want to do you can change it up if you want to change it up move turtle back to zero zero let's change it to yellow and draw a star so color yellow let's make my pen size 10 and then let's draw a star 400 we got to start so play around with what you can do with this program but it's great that we can now create this kind of graphics program that uses functions and you can extend this in the future if you wanted to maybe incorporate mouse events or mouse clicks which should be a really cool thing to do but this is going to build off something you already did which is really important in programming to reuse code our code or other code that's already there in our code base and then expanding on that to make it function the way that we want so this is what you're going to do for your unit 3 project hopefully it goes well share with me i'd love to see some of the stuff that you guys create and i hope that you figure it out if you have questions or comments hit me up in the comment section and as always thank you so much for being here you're doing something great i hope you're a great human i'll see you back in unit number four like share subscribe if that's your thing it helps me out i don't know if that's your thing either way we'll see you soon have a good one
