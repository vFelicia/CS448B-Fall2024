hello humans welcome back to code with connor and this is the let's learn python tutorial series we are here in unit number five topic number two and we are getting so close to the end of the course and i hope you're doing well and i'm impressed that you're still here good on you all right going back to the challenge first and then we'll jump into today's stuff which is lists this is a big topic here we go code for the challenge take the x1 and the y1 take the x2 and the y2 turn them into two bulls and then calculate the slope of the line here we go all the inputs don't need to go over that at this point your pros awesome point one i store is a tubal x1 y1 0.2 i swore is a tubal x2 y2 slope y2 minus y1 so point two box one minus point one box one over x two minus x one point two box zero and point one box zero x two x one to the division and then print the slope now 23 shouldn't be there it's gone now it's fine it's like it was never there at all okay so that was just to test this kind of basic understanding of data structures tubals and and all that fun stuff i don't think you'll use tuples a ton in your life you might who knows they're there lots of people love them depending on what kind of project you're working on i usually use lists my goto but that's okay you do you all right jump it over we're gonna talk about lists okay here we are we're gonna talk about lists what they are how to set them up how to use them index mutability methods all that fun stuff let's get right into it i made a list it's empty you'll notice the notation it's not round brackets it's square brackets ooh all right now you can make an empty list or you can make a list that has stuff in it one two three four five right oh i put two different types of variables in that list is that can i do that i mean i don't know how would i ever find out the answer to the can i do that question oh i know i do it and i see what happens because i'm not going to break anything hey look at that it worked square brackets comma separated values one two three four and the string five it's all there okay now you can also set up an empty list and add stuff to it or you can just add stuff to a list that already has stuff in it you can also override stuff so for example we try to do this in tuples let's do it now my list box zero i want it to now equal the string one and then i'm going to print my list save that and run hey look at that it works it allows unit reassignment so it allows us to reassign a value inside of the data structure or the list all right so now i can do this kind of however i want i've got so much flexibility what if i want to add something to my list well i'm going to let you on your own go check out the w3schools link to list methods because there's a bunch of them and you should kind of look at them but i'll show you a few kind of nice ones append it's one of my favorites it adds something to the end of a list so if i did append six and my list dot append seven and then i print it you can see that it has added those on they weren't there when i originally started but they're there now that's great so we can use pop and this will let us put an index in and it'll remove that one from the list so let's say i want that 2 out of there so i'm going to pop index 1 right and then we run that okay you can see the 2 is gone because i popped it out now there's a little more to the pop method as well and again you'll learn this stuff as you get further on but this actually lets you steal it while it's being pulled so if you want to pull it but then grab that to store somewhere or to print out to the user or whatever it's actually going to return that value so if i print that for example it's still going to remove it from my list but it's going to allow me to use it one last time or store it in a separate variable one last time see so it actually printed it and then removed it so you can actually pop it from a list have it use it for other stuff in your code but then it's no longer in the list anymore which is great okay and there's lots of other ones here and i'll let you go look up some of them but i just wanted to talk core structure so you set up a list with the square brackets now look at the size here what about the size so we can do a len as well and we've done that before with strings and it'll print out how many things are in it so right now there's seven things in my list i got rid of that pop so it's showing me that there's seven so that's really helpful when we're looping right because we're gonna wanna know that so this is just a small snippet of what you can do now you can do multiple variable types we're going to get later you can do two dimensional lists it's kind of crazy and you're going to use lists a lot in your code because you're going to want to store stuff and another thing that's really common is this combination of files and lists where you'll read data in from a file store it in a list use the list variable to access all the stuff inside of your code and then maybe write it or save it back into a file kind of like a database that becomes really common as well now we don't usually write the background database code we use something like mongodb or whatever to handle that and we just pull from the database but that's what's happening in the background this stuff is stored in files it's being read into these data structures then we're accessing it through the data structures modifying it and it's getting written back to these files that's how your profile exists on social media and all that it's stored in files on servers it's pulled from those files into data structures those data structures allow us to reference modify and then store it back so we don't typically write it all from scratch we use you know existing code structures but it's important to kind of have that base understanding because sometimes we do need to write stuff from scratch and we want to have that kind of mindset of how it all connects together all right so i want you to play with lists i want you to look up some of the list functions see what you can do there's all kinds of cool stuff you do like counting things you know can i count how many of this occur in this list and all that kind of stuff play with it see what you can do and then we'll look at the challenge here and see what you can do for me okay for the challenge we're gonna go back in time to our mad lib game remember this thing enter an adjective harry enter a noun computer enter a verb run i'm just going to finish filling it in so i enter them all in and it prints my same outlet from earlier but you guessed it i'm using lists so i have a single list variable where i'm storing all of the user responses and then inside of my print statement i'm pulling from that list in order to fill in my mad lib so use a list and then store all the user responses into the list in order and then pull from that list to make your mad lib now you can go a step further with this if you want to where you actually have a list of mad libs and then those lists kind of get randomized and then from those we pick the right things so this is the challenge for unit five topic number two hopefully this goes well for you go there try it see what you can do lists are awesome you're going to love them once you get used to them like share subscribe do all that fun stuff and we'll see you back here for topic number three we're going to look at 2d lists see ya
