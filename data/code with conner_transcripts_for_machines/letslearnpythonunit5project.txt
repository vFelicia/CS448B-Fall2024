hello humans welcome back to code with connor this is the unified project this is the last unit project that we're gonna do and this is a text based choose your own adventure game so now that we've done all that we've done to create program structure it's time for you to plan and actually do something so what are you going to do you're going to make a game well kind of like zork back in the day i've ever played that europe maybe you read ready player one i don't think they put in the movie but it was in the book for sure and they talked a lot about zork and the white house but it was a text based choose your own adventure game and they can be wicked fun if you build it if you're into dnd this is a really cool experience because you can kind of take a d d campaign which is already very storytelling heavy very written heavy and turn it into something like this either way it's fun project i'm going to show you a couple of student examples of this we'll talk a bit about things that you should do or shouldn't do and then i'm going to set you loose i'd love it if you put it in a platform or you could share it with me if you do it on a code hs sandbox for example you can share the link to your game i can put it on my website if you want me to and people can check it out i want to check it out i think it'll be awesome i always enjoy looking at these every year when my students make them all right let's jump right in and have a look are you ready okay so right off the bat we've got some assy art ascii right using something online to create this string that actually prints out kind of like a fancy font you can google that stuff if you want to and then we immediately get right into the story mode right the text the story is what's going to sell it at the end of the day but mere moments ago you entered into what is commonly known as a dungeon the force field separating you from the grassy field above closing you have nothing on you except the clothes on your back and a strange sense of determination you see legend has told the legendary artifact lies in the depths of this dungeon one that will provide you with an embodiment of whatever you most desire that is if you can make it through to view the commands type help at any time not all of them can be used everywhere however have fun and then we enter the starting room starting room you find yourself in a rather spacious cavern there is a force field blocking the exit to the world above the sound of the nearby ocean can be heard and a small amount of light from outside illuminates your path it appears the caverns lead southward and blue crystals can be seen dotting the path so like just pause love it the world building the story this is awesome when i do this assignment with my students i always focus on that creative writing piece it's so key uh so what's happening from a code perspective so we've got some kind of function that's starting the game and kind of printing that intro and it's just a bunch of strings and print statements nothing there we've got another one for the first room probably a function for the starting room and it clearly is waiting for user input and if i enter help i'm going to guess this if statement is going to be in every function it prints a whole bunch of commands that i can use use help i can use attack and then a target kill and then a target n for north or i can use north so the or statements they must have in their if e s w i can do take if there's an object to take i can talk to if there's a person to talk to up down open an object i can quit i can read if i'm in a battle so they went a whole extra step here then i can attack i can use a shield or i can heal so what do i want to do i'm going to go south because the caverns lead southward all right castle gate the crystals all appear to congregate here forming a large castle a gate stands here currently closed there also appears to be a small window beside it to the south of you the window is closed a person is also leaning against the wall beside the gate aside from the castle a path leads to the west where there appears to be a forest before you can make a decision you hear a voice call from the castle gate yo you there i don't think i've seen you here before i'm charlotte she pauses for a moment well then again nobody comes down here anymore sighs but then again i think i know why you're here for the artifact aren't you yes or no let's go with the s i thought so whatever though anyhow i want to ask what do you plan on doing with the artifact anyway like dude it creates your wishes essentially what do you even wish for like if you're given the choice love power wealth or something else because i know those are your human typical desires i mean i don't know i'm gonna go love i'm a romantic figures nothing i would have picked i'll let you get back on your way though i want to keep playing games with that she pulls a game boy out of her pocket and you hear the sounds of what seems to be the game harvest moon you are now being heavily ignored what do you want to do so again here we go make the next move and you start to see the pattern i'm not going to play through this whole game this is a student game and it's phenomenal and it was based off a dnd campaign that they that they played and it goes really deep i could play this game for probably two hours and i don't think i would make it to the end i think i would screw up or die many times and end up back at the beginning so really cool experience playing something like this i got one more i'll load up real quick so hopefully you get a little bit of the idea now what code structure for a second here is not that crazy it's basically just you're in a function so if you're in room one okay and they make one choice maybe you call ballroom or you call study or you call hallway one and it's just inside your if statements you're going to call the next function so if they made a specific choice you're going to call the function that takes them to the next room i would suggest a flowchart or a map of some kind where each location has a function so that as they make their choices and they move to these new locations there's a function for each location and then within that function there might be if statements based on global variables so if you have a key then what you see in that function might be different than if you don't have a key okay so that room for example might look differently if you have something versus if you don't so things like that are important to put together i have a little sample file it's kind of like a sample game that's not really much to it other than code structure that i'm going to link in the description and you can steal some of that code just to help you get started but really the creativity piece is what's going to make your game work so give it a shot share with me what you make i think it could be awesome when i do this with my students in class i usually say you need at least 20 locations at least 20 functions with decision making you need at least three global variables that are going to be manipulated throughout the game you need many ways to lose and one clear way to win that's kind of the guidelines that i put forward when i do this with my class i think those would be great for you as well get out there try it and hit me up in the comments and let me know how it goes thanks for sticking it out we'll see you back with the final course project in the next video good luck and i look forward to seeing what you guys make and don't forget like share subscribe do all that fun stuff keeps me going see you soon bye
