hello humans welcome back to code with connor this is the let's learn python tutorial series and this is the end this is the end of course project we have come so far from someone who did not know how to write a single line of code did not know what a variable was did not know what printing was knew nothing about coding and maybe that's not you but i'm going to assume it is and now we're here we're doing a project and we're going to do a cool one well i think it's cool you might not think it's cool whatever we're into a project so i'm going to lay out a few options for the project i'm going to show you a couple of student examples that some of my students have made in the past you don't have to do this if you want to do something different go off script a little bit do it that's awesome but these are all examples that use the skills that we've already put in place and kind of push you to do that project design piece remember planning how are my functions going to work how am i going to actually make this thing do the thing i wanted to do and break it into chunks that i can write that code for and then get them to all connect together in the end right that's really what it's all about all right some choices hang man we all know hangman here's a puzzle guess the letters draw a little thingy right it's a classic game that kids play we can use the turtle graphics to draw a little thingy or we can just you know do it old school tictactoe again turtle graphics plus console equals a nice game of tictactoe just twoplayer you can go ai and kind of create a simple ai to play against again that's next level you've learned everything you need to learn to do it it's just a matter of doing it and writing the conditionals writing the random generators and doing all that there's no reason you can't rock paper scissors super simple game play against a random computer opponent and there you go okay ultimate tictactoe you want to push yourself a little bit more this gets a little heavy if you don't know what ultimate tictactoe is go check it out and how the rules work i will show you a quick example but it's just it's like tictactoe but times like 10 because it's a lot harder to write but that's okay it's there and we'll see how it works all right let's jump in and have a quick look at kind of the different examples and how they work i'm not going to show you code i'm just going to show you running projects all right so here we are with a hangman example so you'll see the two things happening i've got the console terminal over here and then i've got my turtle graphics window over here it says you have six wrong guesses left guess and this is my puzzle right here it's showing me there are characters so r good job that was in the work so r is there it shows me i haven't incorrectly guessed anything yet and it didn't draw anything in hangman okay s so it drew a circle no s in the word s is now in the list of words letters that are no good t so no good true another line l oh no good n all right that's in the word all right we got an n in there okay e no e so we got a lag drawn over there oh oh okay let's r a all right we got an a okay maybe it's anchor let's do a c okay let's do an h and i know hey oh and then we win and then we're out so there's an example of hangman and how that works let's jump in look at the next one which is rock paper scissors so this one is just on the terminal so again we get the asiar welcome what would you like to be called okay i'll be called code with connor boom and then ask me just type it out as it is rock paper scissors rock okay so i choose rock i tied the computer they must have chose rock too let's do paper i choose paper i win we covered the cpu and now you can see i have one win the computer is zero so it's tracking my wins paper paper oh i lost scissors i won scissors tied rock rock rock rock rock paper scissors right you get the idea can i play now this one we'd probably want to add a little bit more like how do you end how many rounds you want to do you know maybe a little more functionality in the menu but you get the basic idea of the game it's creating that system where you've got the user input so we're comparing it to get something we've got some kind of uh maybe a list or this is better than this this but in this case conditional statements in there so that's an example of rock paper scissors all right this one's an example of tic tac toe so you can see i got my board over here and i'm just using the standard zero one two zero one two zero one two notation for the rows and columns so upper left corner would be 0 0 and i'm player x so it draws an x on my turtle okay next player maybe i want to do oh we're going to talk in the middle sure so that's 0 1 2 so 1 row would be one column would be one so there's an o drawn different color great all right so we'll try to i don't know set this guy up i don't think it's going to work but let's try it out so let's do 2 2. throw an x in that corner okay so let's say that o is kind of thinking i don't know i'm going to do an up and down line so always going to go 2 and 1 2 all right and then x is going to block that up top so zero and one all right cool now always going to block x in the top corner so row zero column two and you have error protection in here so they can't input a value outside you have air protection but they can't go on top of somebody else so like if i do one one space is already taken i can't do that right so having those pieces in there is going to be important to make sure that it works so we'll do row two column zero and there we go so let's just say i was not very smart here so we go one two okay and then x has a chance to win so one zero and then we get the line it says we won amazing do i want to play again nah i'm good all right ultimate tictactoe it's like regular tictactoe except there's nine tictactoe boards and the difference is when a player makes a play within a mini board the position of that play and the mini board dictates which mini board the next player gets to use and the goal is to win mini boards in the right order that you create a line of mini board wins just like a regular tictactoe game so essentially you're playing nine different tictactoe games and the winner of each of those games dictates who gets that spot in the larger board right so we're gonna start in the middle so we'll do this one he used one two three so two two all right so we're in the middle we are going to go in the top left hand corner of the middle one one so c top left hand corner of the middle grid okay but now i'm up here so now i'm in the top lefthand square so now i'm going to go on the bottom right hand corner of this so 3 3. okay and now i'm down here right and so now my next player has to be down there so i'm going to go 22 in the middle and that brings me back to the middle square right where someone might be like 22 but that keeps us in the middle okay so now i'm gonna go like i don't know one three all right but that now sticks me up here i can't block that o right now because i'm not there i'm stuck up here now right so 1 1 okay cool but that brings me over here and this is how it works and then you have to win the little squares to eventually win the big square and you want to add the drawing and all the fancy this is a tough program i've had three students attempt it two students do it successfully it's a tough one but it's awesome and it uses all those skills that we've been working on in the course so get out there try one of these course projects again do it somewhere you could share it take your code dump it into replica dump it into code hs sandbox and share the link in the comments so we can check it out if i get some good ones i'll throw them on my website as well thank you for doing the course i think it's awesome that you're here and you're trying to learn a new skill whether you're doing it for school like actual traditional school or you're just doing it for your own learning you're doing something right you could be playing minecraft or call of duty right now or fortnite or apex or whatever other game but instead you're here trying to learn how all that stuff actually gets made which is really cool because we're content consumers all the time but we don't often understand the content that we're consuming and how it's made so thank you for being here i think it's awesome this won't be the end we'll do some other stuff as well maybe something a little more advanced i'd love to do something with java unity and hopefully you'll come back and check that out as well so have a good one thank you for being here like share subscribe let other people know what i'm doing and we'll see you back here hopefully not too long from now see ya you're awesome
