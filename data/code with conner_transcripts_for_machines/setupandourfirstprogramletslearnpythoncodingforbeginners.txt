hello humans welcome to code with connor this is your first time here thanks for coming in we're going to learn some python in this video series so if this is video 1a so we're going to start unit one by just introducing what python is uh talk a little bit what you need to do to get set up and get coding we'll give you a few options so that you can code along uh with these videos uh and then we'll kind of get rolling from there if you wanna learn more about me uh let me know in the comments and i'll post a video about it but for right now we'll just stick to the code so if you're here you're probably interested in learning something about python maybe somebody told you can make a lot of money uh as a programmer uh maybe you just want to know it because you think it's cool and it's got a cool sound a name either way i'm glad you're here first thing you're going to need is you're going to need the ability to run python scripts now i'm going to go through a series of instructions over the next few minutes about installing this stuff on a windows computer it'll be a very similar process on a mac os or a linux machine if you're going to be running this on a chromebook or a tablet or a phone you can just check in the call in the description of the video and i'll i'll chapter this thing up you can skip ahead to the section where i'll talk about some options you can use if you're doing it mobile let's get into it i'm just on chrome here and i've just gone to the python website it's python.org and i clicked on downloads okay so you're gonna need to download python to your computer so i'm gonna download python 3.91 this is the latest version of when i'm recording this video if python 4 is out when you're watching it you should probably download python 3 just because i imagine there'll be some major changes as they move from 3 to 4. so make sure you note where you download it download chrome's going to download the file and i'm going to open it up so it's going to ask me if there's one important piece here when you install this on a windows machine because of how we're going to use python it's really helpful for us if we add python as a path okay and this is going to allow us in powershell to use the python command which is just fantastic and it makes running our simple programs while we're learning really easy so we're going to do that cool install now awesome there we go python's installed close awesome now writing your actual python code you can use an ide an integrated development environment there's large scale ones there's tiny ones when i'm writing python i'm writing small scripts i'm teaching people i don't need the big convoluted debugging tools and all of that so i'm going to go to my go my goto favorite and this is what i'm going to use in the videos notepad plus plus i love notepad plus plus if we hop over here to download you can go in here and you can download the latest version so here's the 7.88 release click on that and then you can download it to your windows machine again take note of where you download it and then we're going to run the installer so i'm going to download the 64bit installer here and we'll save it and we'll launch it choose a language we go next accept next next and just like that we are up and running pam there we go so notepad plus plus is installed so these two things together are going to be our environment we're going to write our code in notepad plus plus then we're going to use python which is installed on the computer to actually run it now that we have nova plus plus installed and we have python installed we're ready to start kind of writing code we're going to write our code in notepad plus plus we're going to use windows powershell to actually run our code so first time we pull up windows powershell all we're going to do is we're going to start menu and we're going to type power this is one of many ways to do it and then once we launch powershell it's going to look something like this it's called windows powershell now it might bring you to a different drive obviously than the one i'm in so the one thing we're going to need to do from an organization standpoint is you're going to want a folder on your pc where you're going to save all your python scripts so you can make it something simple like you can navigate to this pc to your c drive whatever and then you can do it that way so so on your computer if you are on your pc and you go to your c drive this is one of the easiest things if you just right click and make a new folder call it like share subscribe right and then that folder can be where we save all of our python scripts so this way it's going to make it easy for us to access it so if we hop over here to our powershell we can see that if i go to c colon and i hit enter and then i'm going to use a couple of commands so i can do cd dot dot it takes me back one directory so you'll see i go from my folder back to users i can do it again now i'm back in c drive there's another command called cd space and you can put the name of a directory so like and i can hit tab at any point it'll try to autofill it like share subscribe i hit enter and now i'm inside of that folder so i'm in c colon like share subscribe and so this is where i'll be when i run commands if you ever want to clear your powershell you can do cls and it's gone okay you know pretty simple set of commands that we're going to use you you'll sometimes use cd dot dot or you'll use cd space and then start typing in a folder name and the last command we'll use will be python and we'll use that in just a minute so let's hop over here to our notepad plus plus and our powershell environments in notepad plus plus we'll go over just a very quick program and then we're going to end this video and then we'll get ready for moving on to the next one we're actually diving into stuff a little bit more so the very first program that we write in the world of programming and software development is always the hello world program and it seems to be going on for a long time it was the first program i wrote in java back i don't know 20 years ago and it's still the first program i teach my students so it looks something like this in python we're going to type print and we're going to open a set of parentheses parentheses are our curved brackets and then in quotation marks so quotation marks are just left to the enter key on your keyboard we're going to write hello world exclamation point then we're going to close our quotation marks and we're going to close our parentheses it's important in coding and you'll see this if you've learned any html or anything before that what we open we have to close all right so we open the brackets we open the quotes we type it we close we close and then we're going to go through the process how we run it so we're going to save this so i'm going to go to file and this one time i'm going to do save as but from now on i'm just going to do file save and i'm going to find my folder c drive like share subscribe and we're going to call this hello world dot p y and the dot p y is important because the dot p y is a file extension that tells windows this is a python script it also will tell python to read it as such and i hit save you'll notice my notepad plus plus is color coded once you save it as a dot py nobel plus plus will recognize python code and help color code elements for you until you've saved it it's not going to do that it's just going to see raw text so it's helpful to save your files at the beginning so you get those nice colors to help you kind of organize your code so now when it's time to run it we actually will leave nova plus plus and go to powershell and in here we're going to type python space and then we're going to type the name of the file and again we don't take the whole name we can hit tab at any point that we think we have enough characters to make it unique and there it is pythonhelloworld.py and when i hit enter it prints to the console hello world exclamation point so it printed the literal string that was inside of these quotation marks it didn't print the quotes it didn't print the brackets it just printed the characters that were inside of that so you could change that you know we could make that say something else like share subscribe right and we save our file hop over to powershell and there it is it's changed what's being printed remember at any point cls will clear our powershell window away so one other thing that is sometimes useful when we're writing our programs is sometimes we want to put notes in our code that don't actually get executed or run so we can do a single line comment using a hashtag so hashtag single line comment and this will not execute it won't affect how our code runs so if i save it now i'm using control s to save you can click file save it's all the same and then i run it oops you'll notice i'm not retyping oh what am i doing ah it's a crazy shortcut if i press the up arrow in powershell and i can press it more than once it'll bring up previously entered commands so it's a nice way to save some time hit enter you'll see it didn't affect how the program ran at all and i can do the same with multiline comments so instead you can use triple single quotes so these are next to the enter key without holding down shift three of them to open three of them to close this is a multiline comment and you can go as much as you want in between those triple quotes again save and run up enter and you'll see it did not affect the execution of the code at all okay so as far as your layout goes you're probably going to have a powershell window and a nobel plus plus window you'll probably be switching between them a lot i like to use alt tab on a windows machine to cycle between them but again you can click your way through it so this is the setup that i use when i'm on a windows computer or mac computer to do my coding and this is what i'll be doing in all of my videos let's just say that you don't have access to that type of system you still want to code along i'm going to show you my favorite recommended online ide that you can use to do this so let's check it out so my favorite is a website called codehscodehs.org and i'll throw a link in the description on cody jess you can go you can create a free account with google and they have a sandbox on code hs and what i love about the codehs sandbox so i can do my hello world uh cwc just so it distinguishes it for the code with connor create program now you can code in a lot of languages on here so the two that we'll use in this video series would be python3 and we might look at a couple that involve turtle graphics which would be the python turtle so if i just go to python 3 create my program it's going to give me an online coding interface you'll notice it defaulted to the hello world program and i can click run code and it gives me a little display right over here this is great it's all selfcontained you can do it in a browser you can do it on a chromebook whatever and you'll be able to follow along with pretty much everything we do here you can even have multiple files in a single project if that's your thing you can even change your editor settings right you can throw down like an old school terminal vibe you can maximize your editor so another great resource now i use this with my students as well because there's some learning tools amazing learning content built in again not a sponsor just love the site so this would be my preferred online ide if you're going to follow the course i'll make sure things work with this obviously there's a there's a ton of other options out there there's replica and there's others and you're going to kind of find the one that you're interested in but that's how i'm going to do it so in the event that you want to do this without using the windows setup this would be my option that i would recommend for you so that's the end of the first video hopefully that makes sense for you and hopefully that gives you kind of just that initial setup i didn't really talk much about the language and about programming kind of in a theoretical sense we'll hit on that a bit more in the next video when we actually start coding talking about variables and and really execution and what coding is thanks for watching don't forget to like subscribe share the videos and i hope you enjoy comment and i'll hit you back have a great day
