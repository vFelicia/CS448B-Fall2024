hello humans welcome back to code with connor this is the let's learn python course we are on unit four topic number three we're going to keep going with string functions but before we do that let's go back and look at the challenge from the last lesson so here we are in the challenge from the last lesson in this one we were printing a word vertically so you see i printed i have a word printed vertically i had to queue to quit took an input and i just did if the lowercase version of the word was q then break out and then my for each loop so my four character in the word print the character remember this type of print statement right here this automatically jumps to a new line after it prints the character so because it's printing one character at a time in the loop it's going to end up printing the word vertically so that was a challenge in the last lesson now let's jump in and talk a little bit more about string functions we're going to talk about string functions now we're already using one string function which we just used a second ago which is the dot lower function where we take a string variable and we do a dot notation dot notation says call a function on this data type so this is a string data type so it's going to call one of the string functions and we'll look at a list in a second so the one we want to call is the lower function which is going to make it lower case and i'm just then taking the result of that and passing it to my print so let's run that real quick so we can see what happens just enter a word and it turns it into lowercase if i run it again and i enter something caps you'll see that it returns it in lowercase so coming back this is not the only option that we have in fact there's a whole list of string functions or string methods that we can use let's have a quick look at the list and then go from there so here i am on w3schools and this is just a list of python methods that are related to strings so there's capitalize which makes the first character uppercase so you'll see a method and then you'll see a description and then you'll see the ability to click on it and get more details so let's take something like find for example searches the string for a specified value and returns the position of where it was found so we click on it we get an example so txt is hello welcome to my world and then x is txt dot there's my string dot font defined what am i looking for i'm looking for welcome so it's going to try to find welcome in this and then it's going to print out that variable so something like this welcome is here so it's going to find the starting index of that work it's going to starting index w and then it's going to return that to you if the word appeared more than once it would be the first instance so you can see first occurrence it returns negative 1 if it can't find it so we can handle that in an if statement so it's almost the same as the index method except the index method gives an exception and the fine method returns negative one so you could see how to use a method by clicking on it i'll put a link to w3 schools in the description so you've got it to go off of so there's lots in here that are useful there's all the is is digit is alphanumeric is decimal and those are helpful if you're trying to check that somebody entered something the way that you wanted them to there's things like replace which returns a string where specified values are placed with another one so we're placing part of a string with another thing you have an upper which will convert it to uppercase we have things like center which is kind of neat where we can pass it a parameter so it'll center my word inside of a string that big there's also a two parameter version of this and there's also a two parameter version of this and there's also a two parameter version of this let's play with it a little bit so let's do dot center 20 and dash so this will center it in a string of dashes so this will center it in a string of dashes that's 20 dashes long so we save it come over here and run it you'll see it centers my string in the middle awesome so you can go through and play with a bunch of these string methods on your own obviously the more you know the more flexible you can be with strings which is great i want to look briefly at the challenge for today so let's run it and show you how it works so enter a word or queue to quit superman your word is not a palindrome so it's checking for a palindrome okay so mom your word is a palindrome okay race car your word is a palindrome okay mom with a capital m still counts out so it must be lowering the case on the word okay race car yep definitely lowering the case and working mother not a palindrome cue and we quit and we're out so for the challenge we're going to be building this simple palindrome checker and you're allowed to use things like reversing have a look at reversing a string do a little google on it it's not on w3 schools because it's not actually a string function there's a neat notation that you can use in the index in the box notation for reversing a string so give that a shot and see how it goes and we'll see you back here for topic number four thanks for sticking with me this fair hopefully it's going well we'll see you back here real soon don't forget to like share subscribe bye humans have a good one
