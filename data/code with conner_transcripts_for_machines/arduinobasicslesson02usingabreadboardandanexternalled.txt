hello people of the Internet welcome back to code with Connor and the Arduino basics tutorial series this is lesson 2 o in this lesson we're gonna be taking what we did in Lesson one and extending on it by bringing in a breadboard we're gonna wire up an external LED on a breadboard it'll basically work the same way as the LED we turned on and off in lesson number one except the LED this time will be plugged into an external breadboard and it'll be an actual little LED light instead of the one built in on the Arduino board first things first once you're taking your breadboard and a few wires out of the package we're gonna wire up our circuit and then we'll go look at the code afterward let's talk briefly about a breadboard that this white thing here is a breadboard they come in all shapes and sizes there's what's important for you to know the row with the plus and the row with the minus are all connectivity we use these for voltage and ground a row on the top is not connected to the one on the bottom we would have to make that connection or so all of the inside sections are connected by column you can see on my screen how they light up green that means all of these pins are internally connected so if I plug something in the bottom here and then I plug something in the top they're going to be connected to each other that's the nice thing about a breadboard this middle channel acts as a brake there is not an automatic connection across the bridge so you would need to make a jump with a wire from one end of the bridge to the other if you wanted that column to be connected all the way down for this wiring diagram we're gonna start by running a wire from pin number eight to one of the channels on our board so I'm just gonna come up here to channel number 20 and just for fun I'm gonna make my wire yellow all I'm doing there is I'm connecting my Arduino pin eight to this column all my breadboard right here next I'm gonna bring in a resistant we haven't talked about resistors yes mister looks something like this it's a tiny little piece of electronic mines blue on here what it does it helps resist the current heading through the circuit reason we use this with external LEDs is that we don't want to burn out the LEDs by sending too much current to that we want to resist that current resistors come in all different sizes in terms of how much resistance that they provide in your area kit you'll see a package for 220 ohm resister so in your kit you have a bag full of resistors like this if you pull them out you'll see that it's labeled how many ohms it is so this one is 220 ohms okay so these are the types of resistors that we're looking for when we're wiring external LEDs so I'm gonna take my resistor and I'm gonna use it to bridge that gap on my breadboard so I'm gonna connect it here channel 20 where I have the yellow wire connected all the way through to the other side of the breadboard which now has created a connection or a bridge across that full call and that full channel 20 on my bridge now that I have the resistor in place I can hook up my LED light so you can grab an LED light out of your kid it doesn't matter what color you use what you'll find is that by using a 220 ohm resistor on all LEDs some colors will be brighter than others you can get really technical with the exact resistance value for different colors we don't go quite that technical with it in this tutorial series but feel free to do some research on the internet if you want to know more about that so we're gonna bring our LED into our breadboard now now you'll notice on the LED that there's a long pin or a long leg and a short leg we want the long leg to be the one connected to the resistor channel and the short leg is gonna be one channel over in this case I've got it hooked up to channel number 90 our voltage is gonna come out of pin eight it's gonna travel up this channel through the resistor the long leg of the LED now the short leg of the LED we're gonna connect to the ground all I'm gonna do is on this channel maybe above my LED I'm gonna run a wire to the ground check I'm gonna make that wire block just to make it clear that it's a ground wire now right now that ground is not actually coming back to my Arduino boards remember this ground channel is not connected to this ground channel I don't have any other wires going to my Arduino what I usually do whenever I'm working on a breadboard is I will connect these channel I'll take my voltage channel and I'll connect it here usually with a red wire and I'll usually take my ground channel and I'll connect it here usually with a black wire and what this does it just make sure that this row and this row are connected and that the to ground bros are connect now all I need to do is run a ground wire my Arduino ground to the ground to channel and now if I follow my circuit from pin number 8 to channel 20 through the resistor over the bridge into the long leg of the led through the LED itself to the short leg up here to the black wire which goes to ground which jumps all the way back down to this crown channel travels across ham back to my Arduino his ground pork so we have completed that circuit that is all the wiring that we need to do for this activity now it's time for us to go have a look what the codes going to so we're back into our code interface on the arduino website or on an arduino ide if that's where we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna create a new sketch so what i'm gonna do i like to give my sketch the name right away I'm gonna give this sketch a name because I want to make sure that I'm keeping things consistent lesson zero two in this lesson we're going to be controlling an external LED so I've just added a comment in here to say that that's what we're going to be doing I also always like to have a comment about my setup function and what its purpose is and about the beginning of my loop function let's think about our circuit our circuit is going to jump from pin number eight to the LED which means we need to find pin number eight as an output pin so let's do that now inside our setup function we're going to do pin mode and then we're gonna put the pin number in this case it's pin number eight and then a comma and then we decide whether it's an input or an output pin in this case we're gonna be sending a signal out to the led so it's an output pin and we end with the bracket and the semicolon so that's all the code that we need in our setup function now let's jump down to our loop we need to actually send a signal to turn the LED on well this is exactly the same as what we did in lesson number one where we're gonna send that digital right and then we're gonna send it again to turn it off stay with me okay so this code should look familiar from lesson number one we have a digital write call where we're giving the pin number that we want to send that right to and we're setting the value to high this means we are sending full 5 volts from the Arduino out through pin number 8 and then a delay the delay works in milliseconds remember so this is actually one second we do a digital write on pin number eight this time we're writing a low value which is essentially turning the signal off and then again delaying for one second so what should be the result of this is that our external LED which if we wired it correctly it's plugged into pin number eight should turn on for one second then turn off for one second this is going to repeat over and over because this code exists inside of the loop function I'm just gonna add a few comments to the code here to make it a little bit more clear those of you who might be struggling now the codes got lots of comments in there feel free to pause the video have a read of the comments if you've been struggling with figuring out what the different lines of code are going to do if all goes well at this point you should be able to push this code out to your Arduino we'll go ahead and do that now it says that the code is pushed out tomorrow doing it successfully let's have a look and see if our light is blinking so there you have it on for one second off for one second our circuit is working the way that it's supposed to work awesome so now you have an LED on an external breadboard that's blinking why don't we extend this a little bit and take it one led further why don't you wire up a second LED on to your board attached to your Arduino and then add in the additional code needed so that both lights are blinking together you can even make the lights blink at different speeds if you want to play around with that okay so maybe the lesson in the extension we're not enough for you how about a little bit of a challenge why don't you wire up those two LEDs from the extension except this time take one of them and treat it like a long take the other treat it like a short and get the two LEDs to do an SOS signal one of them represents the lungs one of them represents the shorts with a little bit of delay and between each broadcast so that it's clear that it is an SOS signal try that out and see if you can pull it off and I'll see you back in lesson number three thanks for watching and be sure to click like and subscribe to the channel to keep up with the Arduino basics tutorial series and more to come
