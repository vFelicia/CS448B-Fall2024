hello humans welcome back to code with conor in the let's learn python tutorial series we're ready to start unit number four that's crazy there's only five units in the course uh we're doing good uh hopefully that project went well for you back unit 3 share with me what you did i'd love to see it in unit number 4 we're going to be looking at strings so strings we've already introduced we've done a little bit of printing with them but we need to dive a little bit deeper in terms of how we can access and use strings in our code in this lesson we're going to be focusing on string indexing and sub strings we'll also have a brief conversation about something called immutability for the challenge in this one we're going to be creating a little substring function that uses user input has some loops has some functions that return we're kind of bringing everything together again and that's going to be normal with this kind of stuff we build off of everything we've already done before let's get into it so coming into our code we're going to start with this teeny little program right here so i have a variable called my string which i've set equal to the literal string superman all right literal string defined by quotation marks this is just a variable name we're going to talk about index notation for a string so for i and range len my string let's talk about this function for a second len is the length function and a length function is going to return the number of characters in the string variable here my strength so if i go counting one two three four five six seven eight there are eight characters in this string now if it was super space man that space counts as a character so make sure you're considering that when you're talking with the length now there are string methods you can use to remove some of the spaces but for right now let's just remember that they do count so this is a for for loop for i in range and the length of the string so it'll start at zero it'll loop up two but not including eight so it'll go zero one two three four five six seven it's going to print the word index followed by the actual number that we're at uh semicolon and then it's going to use this box notation okay this is what we're going to use anytime we get into data structures we're looking at elements inside of a variable so in this case my variable is called my string and it contains a whole bunch of characters because remember that's what a string is so what we're doing with the box notation is we're looking inside of this variable at a specific index so at index i so that should cycle through index 0 through 7. okay let's run this and see what it looks like so we can understand it better so when i run this you see index zero is an s one two three four five six seven and you can see the word superman down there okay so zero up to seven so you'll notice that the index notation doesn't start at one the length counter starts at one and goes to eight but the index counter starts at zero and goes to seven so it's important that we recognize that because any time we work with indices and they don't work with strings or later when we work with lists and other data structures that index notation remains consistent through all of programming so we're going to look at this little program now so i've got one string x is a big long one batman's clearly matched by the green lantern second one y is just a short one it's just superman so we can do that same index notation but i want to add to it so we can actually do a little range in here using a colon and we put the index that we start at on the left and the index that we end at on the right so let's say we wanted the word clearly so zero one two three four five spaces six seven eight nine ten so we're going to start at 10 that's the c of clearly and then 11 12 13 40 50 16 the y is 16. stick that in and let's run it and we get clear little that's not quite what we want it didn't include the y even though that was index 16. so the right bound just like in the range function the right bound is exclusive it is not going to include that character so if you want a character included you need to go to the next index so 10 to 17 should fix my problem and now i get clearly you can also do an open ended so i could do from 10 colon and then just leave it blank inside my square brackets and that will start at index 10 and go all the way to the end of the string so run that and i get clearly matched by the green lantern now you can do that the other way as well so i could do like colon up to 18 right that's gonna start at the beginning and go up two but not including 18. so batman is clearly right so starting at the meeting going there so that there's a couple of ways that you can do that um there's other notations here for strings like putting in a negative and stuff like that that i'm not going to get into i'll put a link in the description for w3schools give you a little bit more on strings but we're going to work through the lessons for this unit and we'll kind of get to some of that let's say we wanted to check the man from the two and see that they were equal so let's say in the first one i'm going to do 0 1 2 3 so 3 is the m so 3 4 5 6 to get the man from the first one and i want to see if that's equal to y and 0 1 2 3 4 5 to the end of the file so this should be man equals man so it should yield true so run that and we are true so this is the basics of using substrings and index notation on strings it can get complicated okay especially when you're trying to create these general case things that are going to loop through strings of any length and are going to be able to properly do what you want them to do so imagine trying to take a string and put it in alphabetical order right but it works for any string so the indexing piece starts to get pretty tricky and there's a lot in there but it's a great introduction just kind of get us started now we're going to look at the challenge for this lesson so you can see kind of how it works i'll show you a tiny bit of the code and then we'll look at execution tiny bit of code for the challenge i've got this function i've called print sub which is going to be like a substring print thing it takes an s a min and a max and it's actually going to return a true or a false value and then i have this other one print word indices it takes a string s and it's just going to do a nice print out of the word with their indices and i'll show you that in a second then i've got a while true loop where i'm essentially going to loop and as long as print sub is returning false i'm going to keep looping so if they're not doing it properly if they're making mistakes i'm going to keep looping as soon as they do it properly and they give me the right min and max values for the string then it's going to return true and it's going to kick me out of my loop and end my program let's look at it in execution so in execution it's going to ask me for a word superman it's going to give me this nice printout which is one of my functions with the indexes on top and then the letters underneath them okay and i had to get a little creative with my print statements to make it look that pretty and then it's asking me for a starting index so let's say 2 and an ending index say six and it prints perm so it prints two three four and five okay not including six and it ended now if i did that again and i did an invalid entry so let's say i wanted to go from 4 to 12. well 12 is beyond the scope of the string so it just says invalid index for the given word and lets me go again and i have a bunch of conditions in there what if i put the minimum value bigger than the maximum value no good won't let me do that okay what do i put a negative in no won't let me do that right so there should be protection in there for all the different situations so maybe i start at uh five and i put five again now i won't let me do that so i've got this protection built in now that's going to be boolean statements inside of an if that's going to make that happen now i chained my using and operators you might have another way that you want to do that so there's some stuff in there it's definitely got it's got some spice to it you're going to have to put a bit of work to get it working properly so good luck with it i hope it goes well that's it for the first topic of unit number four which is strings good luck with the challenge we'll see you back here for topic number two remember like share subscribe and we'll see you back here real soon bye humans
