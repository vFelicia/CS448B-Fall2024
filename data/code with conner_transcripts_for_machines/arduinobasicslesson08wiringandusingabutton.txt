hello fellow human fellow human fellow human welcome back to the Arduino basics tutorial series this is lesson number eight we're gonna be learning how to use a button in our circuits let's go through the wiring that you're going to need to setup in order to do this project once we set up the wiring we'll explain a little bit more with how the button actually works to start you'll need a few materials you'll need a 220 ohm resistor a 10 kiloohm resistor standard four pin push button and an LED so the first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna connect to pin number 4 up onto our breadboard I've got mine going to pin 20 make that a yellow wire next I'm gonna put my button on the bridge of my breadboard so here's a standard 4 pin button with the buttons you'll notice the pins stick out on opposite sides so two pins on one side two pins opposite and we're gonna cover over the bridge of the breadboard with our button so the bottom lefthand leg is connected through to pin number 4 on our Arduino board next we're gonna take the top left hand leg we're gonna connect through a 10 kiloohm resistor to the ground row so now I have the top left hand leg connected through a 10 kiloohm resistor to the ground row the top right hand leg we're just going to connect with a wire directly to voltage so our button bottom left leg pin going down through pin 4 and Arduino top left through a 10 kilo ohm resistor to ground top right through a voltage wire to the voltage row of our red book next we're gonna wire up our LED which we're already familiar how to do I'm gonna use pin number 8 connect it up onto my breadboard then I'm gonna use a 220 ohm resistor over the bridge of my breadboard the long leg of my LED pin and then the short leg through to ground so this is what our completed circuit will be how does the button work what's happening inside of a button as you can see in this pin out is that the opposite legs are already connected to each other so top left and bottom left are already connected top right and bottom right are already connected pushing in the button makes the lateral connection so it would connect bottom left to bottom right or top left to top right so right now our pin number four is connected directly through the button to the ground through a 10 kilo ohm resistor when the button gets pushed down it is going to connect top right and top left now that voltage that current is going to be choosing between going through the 10 kilo ohm resistor to ground or with no resistance into the Arduino well it will choose the path of least resistance and it will come into the Arduino and that's where we're gonna get our button reading when the voltage is passing through so when the button is pushed voltage is going to pass through the Arduino when the button is not pushed no voltage is gonna pass through we call this a passive low state you can switch this ground and voltage wire and Cree what's called a passive high state we're not gonna worry about doing that in this particular lesson so here we are in the code interface for lesson 8 I've created a new file new sketch called lesson 8 and we're ready to start our code so we're gonna start by declaring a pin for the LED and a pin for the button as you remember we wired up our button to 4 and our led to pin 8 so I've assigned those variables to those particular integer values next in our setup function we're going to set those as input or output pins so our LED pin it's gonna be an output pin our button pin is going to be an input pin I'll normally setup the serial monitor as well just in case I need to do any debugging in my program just in case I need to do any debugging in my program that's it for our set up function let's head over to the loop function now so inside of our loop function we need a variable that's going to tell us the state of the button whether it's high or low on or off so what I've done is I've created an integer called button state that's going to do a digital read on the button pin remember button pin is an input so it's going to be listening to pin number 4 for the state of the button and it's going to read it as an integer now that integer we can think of as 0 or 1 or we can also think of it as the constant slow and hot so now we get into if statements so we're going to set up an if statement that's gonna check the state of the button the way an if statement works is it's going to check the condition is button state equal to hot if it is it's going to run the code inside curly brackets if it is not true it's going to skip the code inside of these curly brackets so in here we need to turn the LED on which we've done before using a digital right led pin hot then we can do something called an else statement an else statement says if the if statement is not true therefore the code inside these curly brackets does not run will automatically look for an else if there's a else it will run code instead and this creates an eitheror situation either do this or do this but don't ever do both in the else I can do it a digital write led pin low and this is going to turn my LED back off so if the button is reading a high value it's going to turn the LED on otherwise or else in any other situation which would be low it's going to turn the LED off so let's push this out to our board and test it and see if it works and here we have it as I'm holding down the button the LED is on when I release the button the LED turns back off so it's working the way that we wanted it to work great job with the bass lesson for the extension instead of having the LED off when the button isn't being pressed have the LED dim and then when the button gets pressed the LED should brighten up I'll give you a hint you will need to mess with your wiring and with your code to make this happen and remember when we talked about analog versus digital how that affects the pins we use and how that affects the calls that we use inside of our code good luck for the challenge for lesson eight you're gonna need to look into using a variable as a toggle because what I want to happen now is when I press the button the LED should turn on when I press the button again the LED should turn off but I shouldn't need to hold the button down for it to stay on think of it like a light switch when you enter a room this one's going to take a little bit more digging and you might have to do some research online to make it happen good luck and I'll see you back here in Lesson number nine thanks for watching if you liked what
