hello and welcome this is the let's learn python tutorial series here on code with connor my name is adam connor i am a high school math computer science teacher and i'm excited to teach some python i just want to take a minute and go through the course so you know what's coming up and then yeah you can come to the next video if you want to just jump start right into it in the course each unit is going to include a series of videos depending on the size of the unit might depend on whether it's three videos or five videos in each video i'm gonna do guided examples with you as i explain a topic i'm gonna leave you with a coding challenge at the end of the lesson something for you to go off and complete on your own and then obviously after the first video i'll be starting them with quick solution to the previous challenge so just so that you don't feel lost if you're not keeping up and then obviously the end of that video will give you a new challenge at the end of each unit i'll give you a unit project if you want to go off and try it on your own and then share what you did with me uh post it in the comments or let me know where i can find it and i'll go have a look excited to see what you guys create and any spins that you put on it so what are we going to cover i'm going to go through five units on a project we're gonna start with the basics where we go through comments printing variables and their types we'll go through the math and the random libraries we'll go through user input for console programs in unit 2 we're going to do decision making so this includes boolean variables and statements it includes conditional and logical operators if l if and else statements a short circuit evaluation for while loops turtle graphics a little bit of turtle graphics we're not going to do anything crazy and then nested loops unit 3 we're going to talk all about functions this is where we start to get into like program execution this is like core stuff for any programming language so we'll talk about no parameter and return functions we'll talk about functions that take parameters functions that return values we'll look at try and accept statements and then we'll talk about globals versus a call and return structure for your program unifor is going to go into strings specifically so like words and sentences we're going to look at indexing substrings immutability of strings we're going to look at looping through a string and functions last unit is unit 5 where we're going to look at data structures so data structures we're going to look at tuples and index notation we're going to look at lists which are really powerful and list functions we're going to talk about twodimensional lists and unpacking and packing lists into variables and then lastly we'll touch briefly on dictionaries keys and the in keyword in python then we're going to wrap it up with a end of course project so i'll present a few different options to you that you might want to do as an intercourse project and obviously these are things you can find online for you know if you want to just go and find a project that walks you through the code do that that's great but if your goal here is to actually walk away with any real understanding that's going to come from actually coding you know it's going to come from the i'm typing code for two hours and i can't figure out why my code won't compile and working your way through those kinds of challenges is how you're going to learn to program if your goal is just to make something cool and not actually understand anything behind it there's lots of great instructables out there and other great resources to build a tictactoe game or to build whatever and they'll walk you through every line of code but it's not going to help you when you go to do your first project on your own or go to contribute to a github repo you're not going to be able to do that because you're not going to understand any of the actual code one of the biggest eye openers for me when i first started looking into actually working as a developer was the ability to read and understand code so when you walk into a project and there's already a you know 300 400 file code base you've got to go through that code base and understand the structure before you can ever contribute to it and and that requires a pretty deep understanding of a lot of these concepts so you know by no means will this uh you know course equate to a fouryear or you know twoyear degree after high school but it should give you a good introduction to programming a good introduction to a language that's very userfriendly and the concepts from within this course are going to carry over to whatever else you want to learn afterwards i'm glad you're here if you like the videos be sure to like share subscribe keeps me going and yeah good luck
