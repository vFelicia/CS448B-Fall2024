hello humans welcome back this is code with connor and we are doing the let's learn python tutorial series we are all the way in topic four in fact we are at the end of topic four which is exciting we're gonna go back and look at the challenge from the last video which was the palindrome checker using word reversal and then we're gonna talk about uniform project let's go so i told you last time you were gonna have to do a bit of googling around reversing a word in python i warned you i attached it to the lesson on string functions but it wasn't actually a string function it has to do with box notation and here it is right here when you take a string in box notation and you do colon colon negative one it's going to read that string in reverse okay so you'll notice i have word.lower that just returns a string with all lowercase and then i do it in reverse and what am i doing i'm comparing the word not reversed to the word in reversed and i'm checking to see if they're equal because if the word is the same when you reverse it then you have a palindrome okay so that's what they did here while true they enter a word or q to quit if their word is q then we print thanks for playing and we break out of the loop else if their word is the same forwards in reverse then we print it as a palindrome and we continue back to the loop else which means it was not so they didn't enter q but the word they entered was not a palindrome then we print not a palindrome and we continue the loop they enter another word and off they go from there so this is kind of that word reversal palindrome and this is you know the easy palindrome checker that doesn't really require any knowledge of strings or indexing just that one little trick about reversing a word it's a great example of looping in conditional statements stuff like that but for the challenge today i wanted to talk about a palindrome checker that does not use word reversal so i want you to think about the same program but you're not allowed to just check if the word is equal to itself in reverse in fact you need to somehow iterate through the indices of the string and compare characters this is going to test your knowledge of string indexing and looping a lot better than using word reversal so the functionality of this is going to be pretty straightforward let's run it and before you say anything yes i switched computers i'm on a mac my laptop was struggling a little bit with some of my videos you'll see the lag in there and so i was like i'm just gonna do this on the mac and see if it works better so when i run this i get a nice message it's a palindrome checker enter a word or enter q superman not a palindrome like share subscribe no you can still do it though let's try mom yes it is a palindrome race car yes it is what if one of them is capital race car with a capital r at the front a still works so it must be dropping it down to lower case which is great and then q a and it quits but this is done using character indexing in the string not using word reversal and that's what makes this an end to unit project that's what makes this a little bit more challenging give it a try see if you can do it you're really going to need to understand loops and indexing and all that stuff and just small teacher moment real quick if you made it this far you know you're clearly taking it somewhat seriously which is awesome anyone can google you know palindrome checker python or palindrome checkered loops python that's great but it's actually writing the code where you're gonna have your learning it's it's having the struggle where you're gonna learn you know if you just watch me and you google stuff you're going to retain 10 maybe 20 of any of this if you want to actually use this and your plan is to build off of this foundational skill you got to do that piece you got to actually struggle a little bit so go try it on your own see if you can get there hit me up in the comments with your success or failure or frustration or whatever and we'll see you back in unit number five and don't forget if you like what i'm doing like share subscribe and we'll see you back here real soon see ya
