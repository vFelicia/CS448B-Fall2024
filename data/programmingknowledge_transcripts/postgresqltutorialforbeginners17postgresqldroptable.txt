00:00 - hello friends welcome to programming
00:02 - knowledge in this video we will see how
00:04 - we can delete or drop a table in
00:08 - PostgreSQL e in our previous video we
00:11 - saw that how to delete data resurrect
00:14 - table and in this review we'll see how
00:17 - we can do it entire table so before
00:21 - going into execution let us first
00:23 - understand the syntax to be heat or drop
00:32 - the table the syntax is draw in table
00:38 - the name of the table which you want to
00:41 - delete and that's it it's pretty much
00:49 - easy so again first of all you specified
00:53 - drop command because you want to drop a
00:55 - table then you want to draw a table
00:59 - there so you are writing table here and
01:02 - the name of the table of course
01:05 - so let us open the terminal right
01:15 - PS given now let us see which are the
01:20 - databases present in our system for the
01:23 - right back slash and here we have test
01:28 - database so we are going to use that one
01:31 - for using the test database I write back
01:39 - let's see for connecting and test now we
01:44 - are connected to present early
01:45 - now let us say which are the tables
01:49 - present in our days database for that
01:51 - right business P we have two doubles
01:55 - first one is the employee and second one
01:58 - is to burn now I am going to create a
02:02 - new table because I don't want me to
02:04 - delete these papers so let me just
02:08 - create another
02:10 - or that I create table 10 name of the
02:15 - table we will write let us see this time
02:19 - let us say anyway okay and specify the
02:27 - column name so the first column will be
02:31 - new data type will be a name of the
02:41 - animal and let us see color of the pie
03:01 - sorry the paint ID which will be painted
03:20 - and pay that differently about primary
03:24 - key so whatever is clearly let us see
03:38 - this table and these new table
03:43 - let us see two structure name color and
03:50 - painted in white I think is primary key
03:53 - now I want to delete this table I have
03:58 - created a new table which is Kahneman
04:00 - and now I want to delete means drop the
04:03 - table so let's be known as I drop table
04:11 - the name of the table
04:16 - that's it and it will drop the devil
04:20 - Italy as you can see animal is not
04:24 - listed here it means it is deleted you
04:28 - can also delete multiple devil it was
04:31 - for that let me just create two
04:36 - temporary table okay
04:39 - create table then name of the table
04:44 - let's say demon because later I am going
04:51 - to delete it okay I write ID again let
05:12 - me create table with the name of p2 and
05:15 - there's to be the same let us see okay
05:21 - so we have two tables d1 and d2 and now
05:24 - I want to delete two table segments so
05:27 - right drop table the name of the table
05:39 - and our table is as you can see we did
05:45 - it in multiple different in one
05:47 - statement so Jamie okay in test and
05:59 - query - okay so let us first create new
06:05 - tables name of critical is the same one
06:28 - okay our table is created now to see
06:36 - just slightly and refresh and you can
06:39 - see even column you know ID column okay
06:45 - so to drop a table this intensively
06:49 - using draw table the name of the table
06:54 - which is even it is yes and table is
07:00 - deleted just right-click and refresh and
07:04 - you can see demon is no longer part of
07:08 - the tables
07:10 - just be careful while using this query
07:13 - because once you delete the table you
07:17 - cannot restore the data which was
07:20 - present endorse table so we can fill
07:24 - mine
07:25 - performing this type of way thanks for
07:28 - watching
