00:00 - video we are going to cover the one
00:01 - command that is the user mod like as the
00:03 - name sounds just it is the user
00:05 - modification command like with the help
00:07 - of this command you can modify the user
00:10 - details like their user id you can
00:12 - modify their username you can modify or
00:14 - if you want to add those users into that
00:17 - particular group then you can also do it
00:19 - in this particular video so basically
00:21 - mainly we will focus like adding users
00:23 - into groups in this particular video in
00:25 - our next video we will try to cover the
00:27 - like
00:28 - extra things or whatever is the like
00:30 - user locking changing uid changing their
00:33 - uh
00:34 - what you can say uh their group name all
00:37 - these things we will cover in our next
00:38 - video
00:40 - so here is the scenario for you guys
00:41 - like there is a some kind of company
00:44 - and here you can see
00:46 - different teams are there like developer
00:48 - tester marketing team okay these are
00:50 - some kind of teams in that particular
00:52 - company and we have our different users
00:55 - like d1 d2 t1 t2 m1 m2
00:58 - so basically suppose this this is our uh
01:01 - some kind of linux server and in which
01:03 - we want to create different groups
01:05 - so there will be separate groups for
01:07 - developer
01:08 - separate groups for tester and similarly
01:10 - for marketing there will be a separate
01:11 - group and these are the users
01:14 - so now what we will do we will try to
01:15 - first of all create all these user all
01:18 - these groups then we will create the
01:20 - users and then we will add these users
01:22 - into that
01:23 - groups using user mod command okay
01:28 - so now first what we will check if we
01:31 - have
01:35 - that
01:36 - group present or not
01:40 - i have
01:41 - sorry
01:46 - okay so here you can see uh there is no
01:49 - any other groups present like developers
01:52 - marketing team and all other groups okay
01:54 - so now what we can do we can try to add
01:57 - those groups so how we can do it you can
01:59 - do it easily by using group add command
02:03 - and i will try to
02:05 - give the uid that is 2001
02:09 - and the name of the group that will be
02:11 - developers
02:14 - okay so it is showing permission denied
02:16 - why because we have not added sudo here
02:18 - because it runs only if you have a
02:21 - permission
02:23 - like
02:24 - that user should be added in that
02:25 - suitors file
02:27 - so now i will need to enter my password
02:31 - and again let's check if this group is
02:33 - added or not
02:34 - so here you can see developers group has
02:36 - been added okay
02:38 - and 2001 is the gid and we have not
02:40 - still added any kind of user into this
02:42 - group
02:43 - okay
02:45 - so now let's uh
02:47 - create other groups
02:57 - testers i will try to give you a date is
03:00 - 2002
03:01 - again permission denied
03:04 - okay added
03:07 - and now marketing
03:10 - team
03:12 - okay
03:13 - two thousand two already just
03:15 - change the uid to three okay
03:20 - so now what we can do we can check if
03:22 - all the groups has been created or not
03:24 - so here you can see developers tester
03:26 - marketing team has been created now what
03:28 - we have to do we have to create all
03:30 - these users like d1 d2
03:33 - d1 t2 m1 m2 okay
03:36 - but before creating group there is a one
03:37 - concept of primary and secondary group
03:40 - in all this linux system
03:42 - so you will need to understand it first
03:44 - like basically what is primary group in
03:45 - primary group what happens when you
03:47 - create a one user or any new user so
03:50 - simultaneously a one group is also
03:52 - created with them like suppose i have
03:54 - created test
03:56 - okay a test user then test group will be
03:58 - also created okay so that is a primary
04:01 - group and what is the secondary group
04:03 - secondary group is nothing but uh like
04:05 - uh
04:06 - one user like will present in other
04:08 - groups also
04:10 - suppose this is a d1 user and he has a
04:14 - primary group of d1 and but he is also
04:16 - present in developer so developer is his
04:19 - what secondary group okay
04:22 - i've ever tried the concept of this okay
04:26 - so now what we can do i will add users
04:29 - so for users also we use sudo command
04:32 - and we will use add user command
04:35 - not user ad
04:37 - [Music]
04:39 - name it as a d1
04:44 - matching the regular expression okay so
04:46 - i think we cannot write a numerical
04:49 - uh
04:51 - deo
04:53 - one
04:55 - okay sudo add user day one is now
04:58 - imagine
05:00 - okay let me check
05:09 - cad user
05:16 - that is sudo again i will try to create
05:19 - user
05:26 - oh sorry
05:32 - add user
05:34 - developer
05:35 - [Music]
05:36 - one
05:38 - okay so here you can see like developer
05:41 - one has been uh like uh username has
05:43 - been created now it is asking me to
05:45 - enter the password of that particular
05:47 - user
05:48 - so i will enter some kind like
05:51 - anything maybe which i want
05:53 - [Music]
05:54 - and full name um
05:56 - i don't want to give
05:59 - and whether this information correct or
06:01 - not yes it is correct
06:03 - so this uh user has been created like to
06:05 - verify whether user has been created or
06:07 - not what you can do like as we have
06:09 - earlier learned like when whenever we
06:11 - create a user then the information is
06:13 - get stored or get added into the
06:16 - password file that is pass wd okay so we
06:19 - will check the content of that file
06:24 - sorry
06:25 - so here you can see our developer one
06:28 - has been created with the uid this and
06:30 - 1001
06:31 - gid what is the id that is the group id
06:34 - and this is
06:35 - his primary group okay
06:38 - so if you will check with the id command
06:40 - of that particular user devel
06:42 - developer one
06:44 - so here you can see their gids 1001 and
06:47 - their primary group is developer one
06:49 - okay and groups in which groups this
06:51 - user is present so basically it is
06:53 - present in only one group that is a
06:55 - developer one because we have not added
06:57 - this user into that developers group
06:59 - so now what i will do again i will
07:01 - create another user um
07:04 - developer 2
07:08 - okay let's
07:10 - enter password
07:14 - i don't want to provide yes
07:17 - done again
07:20 - now i will create for tester tester one
07:25 - same
07:28 - sorry
07:35 - why okay
07:37 - tester has been added now tester two
07:45 - no full name nothing required yes
07:48 - okay we have already covered this user
07:50 - creation you can watch our previous
07:52 - video okay
07:53 - so uh these two users has been added
07:55 - let's again check the content of that
07:58 - password file so here you can see
07:59 - developer one developer two tester one
08:01 - tester two has been added again last one
08:03 - is remaining that is which one marketing
08:05 - team
08:06 - okay
08:07 - so
08:10 - where that last command which we have
08:12 - done okay
08:15 - i will just write empty one
08:18 - password
08:20 - okay
08:23 - nothing is required yes
08:25 - again mt2
08:28 - password uh
08:30 - enter anything which you want
08:37 - nothing required nothing and then yes
08:40 - okay so successfully we have created all
08:42 - these three users and the groups okay so
08:44 - as per this scenario like developer has
08:47 - developer one developer two tester one
08:49 - tester two marketing team one and
08:52 - marketing team two okay
08:54 - so now we will check whether all these
08:56 - things has been created or not
08:58 - for your like clarification
09:02 - cat slash ctc
09:06 - so here you can see all the six users
09:08 - has been created so now the main thing
09:11 - uh the main topic of our this video is
09:13 - user mod like user modification
09:15 - so
09:16 - now let's check the uh first of all
09:18 - check the like group of developer uh not
09:21 - developer let's check for tester one
09:24 - so here you can see gid is this and
09:27 - group is this is added only in this
09:29 - group particular and now let's check the
09:31 - like whatever the groups we have present
09:38 - so there you can see
09:42 - here one developers
09:44 - testers marketing team and
09:47 - also you can see developer one developer
09:49 - to this this this and why why this is
09:51 - happening because these are the primary
09:53 - groups for that particular user like
09:55 - when you have created that developer one
09:57 - user then simultaneously another group
09:59 - has been also created okay that's why
10:01 - this is a primary group now what we will
10:03 - do we will add this developer one user
10:05 - into this developers group and then we
10:07 - will check that
10:09 - like check with the id command like
10:12 - what are the other groups in which that
10:14 - particular user is present okay
10:16 - so now the role of user mod begins so
10:19 - let's start with this so basically our
10:21 - user mod we will use it
10:24 - like this like user mod and then we will
10:26 - provide the name of the group in which
10:28 - we want
10:30 - and hyphen a option hyphen a is nothing
10:32 - for the append option okay i hope you
10:35 - are aware of append like appending
10:36 - something like uh
10:39 - suppose there is a some kind of
10:41 - container and you are just appending
10:43 - into something things in it okay you can
10:45 - think of it like that and we will use
10:48 - hyphen g option for the
10:50 - groups
10:53 - and the group name so what we want to
10:55 - that is the developers
10:57 - i think this is the same name if i'm
10:59 - correct
11:01 - let me check it
11:12 - okay
11:14 - leave
11:15 - i'm correct i know
11:17 - ah
11:19 - developer one
11:23 - permission denied again because we have
11:25 - not used sudo here
11:28 - and now let's check the
11:31 - groups of this particular user developer
11:34 - one
11:35 - so here you can see
11:36 - like
11:38 - gid is 1001 and the groups which in
11:40 - which groups this particular user is
11:42 - present so here you can see developer
11:44 - one this is his primary group and
11:46 - developers is it secondary group okay
11:50 - so again let's add other users also
11:54 - like uh
11:56 - developer
11:58 - 2
11:59 - i will add this user into this
12:01 - developers
12:03 - what you can say developers group
12:06 - added simultaneously we will add a
12:09 - users and testers group
12:17 - tester1
12:26 - i have written wrong name
12:33 - twister one okay
12:40 - added
12:41 - again for tester 2
12:43 - added
12:44 - similarly for marketing team
12:47 - uh let me check the name of that
12:51 - particular group
12:58 - marketing team okay
13:01 - and here you can see like in developers
13:03 - we have you can see like developer one
13:04 - has been added and developer 2 has been
13:06 - added similarly in testers we have
13:08 - tested 1 and tester 2 ok
13:11 - so now what we will do
13:16 - we will add
13:18 - users into the marketing team
13:22 - let me clear the screen
13:23 - and marketing team and
13:27 - my username was empty one i think empty
13:29 - one okay
13:31 - added and similarly empty
13:33 - [Music]
13:35 - empty
13:36 - to it was i think
13:39 - let me check the name of that particular
13:41 - user
13:49 - okay this is m2 okay
13:57 - added
13:58 - so now again we will check
14:05 - so now here you can see the developers
14:08 - group
14:08 - like what are the users present that is
14:10 - developer 1 and developer 2. in
14:12 - similarly interested group we have a
14:14 - tester 1 and tester two
14:16 - and in our this uh what you can see in
14:19 - the marketing we have uh m1 and m2 okay
14:23 - so uh this is the like um
14:26 - thing which you should learn about like
14:27 - user modification like this is uh
14:30 - like what you can say important thing
14:33 - because uh when you will go in the
14:35 - corporate then maybe as a system
14:36 - engineer or whatever like a linux
14:38 - administrator then at that time you will
14:40 - get to know about this these things okay
14:43 - so uh that's all for this video and for
14:45 - user modification command like there
14:47 - will be another video for further
14:49 - details like how you can add the command
14:51 - add a uid
14:53 - and you can change the
14:55 - like old username to the new username so
14:57 - let me show you this command like how
15:00 - you can change that i have to change
15:01 - this m2 to m
15:03 - like marketing team two okay this is the
15:06 - user
15:06 - m2 and i have to change his username to
15:09 - marketing team two so how how i can do
15:12 - it
15:12 - i will just use user mod
15:15 - and then i will use the option hyphen
15:17 - and the old username is m2 and the new
15:20 - username what i want is marketing
15:23 - team 2.
15:27 - okay user
15:28 - mod what is it showing user marketing
15:31 - team 2 does not exist
15:34 - why it not exist i'm just
15:37 - ok
15:38 - maybe the new name will come up here
15:48 - permission is denied
15:50 - sudo
15:51 - okay again let's check the group name
15:54 - if it is changed so
15:57 - okay here you can see marketing two like
15:59 - in from m2 to marketing to the name of
16:02 - the username has been changed and also
16:05 - you can verify it from this uh our
16:07 - password file
16:11 - here you can see it is marketing two
16:14 - okay so that's all for this video and in
16:16 - our next video we will cover up the
16:17 - other options of user mod command okay
16:20 - so thank you thank you for watching and
16:21 - we'll meet in the next video thank you
