00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Java fix tutorial for beginners in this
00:04 - video we will see how we can use images
00:07 - in Java FX so we will see how we can use
00:13 - image view to add images and we will
00:16 - also see how we can add images or icons
00:19 - to your buttons or labels so let's get
00:23 - started
00:23 - I will use the same project which I have
00:26 - created in the last video so I have
00:29 - created in the last video this Login
00:31 - project and I'm going to open this login
00:35 - dot F XML which I have created using the
00:38 - scene builder and this was the layout
00:43 - which I have created in the last video
00:45 - ok so I will go to the Eclipse IDE and
00:49 - first of all I will create some
00:52 - resources for the images right so I will
00:55 - go to my source package and I will
00:58 - create a new package here and I will
01:01 - name it as IMG for images right and I
01:05 - will click finish and inside the images
01:08 - package I can transfer some aged images
01:12 - right so I have this image of JavaFX
01:16 - logo and I can drag and drop into this
01:19 - image folder okay and just say copy file
01:24 - and click OK so now my image folder has
01:28 - this one PNG file right now we will go
01:32 - to the scene builder and there is a
01:34 - control called image view so let's
01:37 - search for the image view which we can
01:40 - drag and drop into our scene and inside
01:44 - this image view we can give the source
01:48 - of the image right you may see here
01:51 - there is a property here which is the
01:54 - first property which says image and you
01:56 - can you know search for your image and
01:59 - give the path of your image from here
02:02 - but we are not going to use this we are
02:06 - going to use the relative path which we
02:08 - have created ok so just drag and drop
02:11 - this image view and resize it
02:12 - accordingly
02:13 - to your requirement and save your f XML
02:18 - file so just save and go to your Eclipse
02:21 - IDE and open your login dot F XML and
02:25 - this is the image view which we have
02:27 - created it has the height of 150 and
02:31 - width of 200 right so what I'm going to
02:34 - do is I'm going to create this image
02:37 - element something like this so I will
02:39 - delete this forward slash from here and
02:41 - I will add this ending tag for image
02:46 - right and I will just press Enter and in
02:49 - between this image tag I can add one
02:52 - more element which is called image okay
02:57 - and inside this image element I can
03:00 - provide the source for the image so I
03:03 - will just add this element with capital
03:07 - I image and then I can provide URL is
03:12 - equal to the source of your image and
03:17 - just close it okay so the source for
03:21 - your image is inside your image folder
03:24 - so you can do something like this you
03:27 - can just write IMG slash the name of
03:30 - your image my image name is Java FX dot
03:34 - PNG now save your code and run it and
03:40 - now I can see this image is shown here
03:43 - right now for example you want to resize
03:45 - this image to smaller or bigger size
03:48 - right so how you can do it so right now
03:51 - our height is 150 and width is 200 here
03:57 - in the image view so you can change it
04:00 - for example I want 350 by 500 okay just
04:05 - save it and run it once again and now
04:09 - your image is resized to the size you
04:11 - have given here okay and for example I
04:15 - want to have a smaller image so I can
04:18 - give 50 by 100 save it and run it once
04:24 - again and now I have the small
04:27 - our image here right now for example I
04:31 - want to add the image to the button so I
04:35 - have this login button
04:37 - and I want to add some image to this
04:39 - button so how can I do it so what I can
04:42 - do here is I can go to my button element
04:46 - this is my button element and inside
04:50 - this button element I can add element
04:54 - called graphic so add this element and
04:58 - between this graphic element I'm going
05:01 - to add this image view element so just
05:04 - add image view and just close it and in
05:10 - between this image view I can just have
05:14 - the same code like this so just copy the
05:17 - same code from here and paste it here so
05:22 - what I have done here inside the button
05:24 - element I have added first of all this
05:26 - graphic element and using this graphic
05:29 - element I can use the image view inside
05:33 - this graphic element to show my image
05:35 - right so I can use this so something
05:40 - like this which is same as we have done
05:43 - in the last element here and save your
05:46 - code and run it once again and you can
05:50 - see here the image is added to the
05:53 - button but if you can see the image size
05:57 - is its original size so it's not resized
06:01 - because we haven't provided any size to
06:04 - the image view yet so you can see here
06:07 - our image view has no element so to
06:10 - resize your image you need to give these
06:14 - two attributes to your image view
06:17 - element one is fit height and other is
06:21 - fit width okay so for example I will
06:24 - give the same fit height and fit width
06:27 - parameter and fit height is 50 for us
06:31 - and fit width is 100 right now
06:34 - okay so run the code once again and now
06:38 - you can see the image is
06:40 - resized and now it looks good on this
06:44 - button okay so same you can do for
06:47 - labels or if you have some other
06:51 - controls you can add images to those
06:54 - controls like this okay
06:57 - so if you have a label it will be the
07:00 - same code like this okay
07:03 - now for example you want to add an image
07:07 - from online source so instead of using
07:11 - this local resource you can also use
07:15 - here the online resource for example you
07:19 - have some image somewhere located on
07:21 - internet for example I have this image
07:23 - on my website and I can see here and I
07:27 - just need to use the URL just copy the
07:30 - URL go to your code and instead of using
07:34 - this local path you can just paste your
07:38 - resource path which is online so my
07:42 - picture is on the website easy online
07:46 - converter comm slash images slash logo 1
07:50 - dot PNG right save the code and run it
07:53 - once again and now I can see this logo
07:56 - here on the button right so in this way
07:59 - also you can add images to your controls
08:02 - in JavaFX so I hope you enjoyed this
