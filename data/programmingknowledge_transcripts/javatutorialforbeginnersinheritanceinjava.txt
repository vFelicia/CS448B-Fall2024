00:02 - hello and welcome back to another video
00:03 - of the Java tutorial Series so till now
00:06 - we have covered class objects and I
00:09 - guess static keyword in Java and today
00:12 - onwards we will be learning inheritance
00:14 - in Java so I will be dividing
00:17 - inheritance in two videos in this video
00:19 - we will be talking about the theoretical
00:21 - theoretical part of the inheritance what
00:24 - is inheritance why it is required and
00:26 - what are the different terms which is
00:27 - which are used in The Inheritance and in
00:31 - the second video we will be discussing
00:32 - about the types of inheritance because
00:34 - there are basically five types in are
00:37 - there in inheritance and we will be
00:39 - discussing each type using the example
00:42 - code example okay so let's just get
00:45 - started uh so what is inheritance
00:47 - inheritance in Java is a mechanism in
00:49 - which one object acquires all the
00:51 - property and the behavior of the parent
00:53 - object so basically there are two terms
00:56 - are here
00:57 - sub class or the child class or the
01:00 - parent class okay parent class is the
01:02 - class whose properties are inherited by
01:05 - the child class child class uses the
01:07 - property which are declared inside the
01:08 - parent class and it is important it is
01:12 - important part of the object oriented
01:13 - programming system and inheritance
01:15 - represents the is a relationship which
01:18 - is also known as parent child
01:19 - relationship okay and you may ask why to
01:23 - use inheritance in Java okay so there
01:25 - are basically two reasons for method
01:27 - overriding so that we will discuss what
01:30 - is method overriding in our upcoming
01:31 - videos uh basically it it is used to
01:34 - achieve the runtime polymorphism in Java
01:37 - and photo code reusability code
01:40 - reusability means uh suppose we you have
01:44 - declared some variables and the methods
01:45 - inside the parent class and those
01:47 - methods and variables are required for
01:49 - you to write in in the another class
01:52 - and then instead of writing those
01:54 - variables and methods again and again
01:55 - you can just inherit the properties of
01:57 - that method and variable from the parent
02:00 - class to the child class in that case
02:03 - one is one become the parent class whose
02:06 - properties can get getting inherited and
02:08 - child class becomes the class whose
02:11 - property who's inheriting the property
02:13 - okay
02:14 - so there are different terms which are
02:16 - used in inheritance one is class a class
02:18 - is a group of objects which have common
02:20 - properties it is a template of blueprint
02:23 - from which objects are created uh as we
02:26 - have discussed in our previous videos
02:27 - and subclass and the child class
02:30 - subclass is the class which inherits the
02:32 - other class as I have told you the child
02:35 - class will inherit the properties from
02:37 - the parent class and superclass slash
02:40 - parent class is the class whose
02:42 - properties are getting inherited by the
02:44 - child classes and reusability as the
02:47 - names specifies reliability is a
02:49 - mechanism which gives you to reuse the
02:53 - fields and the methods of the existing
02:54 - class when you create a new class and
02:57 - you can use the same fields and methods
02:59 - already defined in the previous class so
03:02 - for achieving The Inheritance in Java we
03:04 - have the syntax uh we have to write this
03:06 - in this syntax class sub class name you
03:10 - can write here the subclass name and
03:12 - extend is the keyword which is used to
03:15 - Java and the superclass name and inside
03:18 - the curly basis you can write a write
03:21 - ordinary to the properties which you
03:22 - want to inherit from the building parent
03:24 - class
03:24 - okay so this is pretty much about the
03:27 - inheritance in Java theoretical part uh
03:29 - from the next video onwards we will be
03:31 - looking into the types of the United
03:33 - States that there are single multi-level
03:35 - hierarchical multiple and hybrid there
03:38 - are five types of initials in Java and
03:40 - one more thing multiple inheritances in
03:43 - Java is not supported and we can still
03:46 - achieve it but there is one thing uh
03:48 - concept that you to know how to achieve
03:51 - the multiple inheritance in Java that
03:53 - way that also we will be looking into
03:54 - the when we are going into the abstracts
03:56 - and encapsulation part
03:58 - okay so for now uh this is pretty much
04:02 - about the United NC Java and from next
04:04 - video onwards we will be saving seeing
04:06 - uh each type in detail with code example
04:09 - thank you
