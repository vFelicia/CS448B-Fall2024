00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - more tears to toll for beginners in the
00:04 - last video we have seen how we can send
00:06 - a HTML page using readable streams and
00:11 - writable streams in nodejs
00:13 - now in this video I'm going to show you
00:15 - how we can send our Chasen to the
00:19 - browser using node.js right so Jason now
00:24 - you know most of the you know so
00:26 - application uses Jason as a data to send
00:31 - it to the browser and this data can be
00:34 - passed on the browser side for example
00:36 - and then it can be used for you know
00:40 - multiple purposes so it's also a popular
00:44 - technique that Jason is sent from the
00:48 - server to the browser and then with this
00:52 - g3 data some useful things can be done
00:54 - so let's get started and see how we can
00:58 - use Jason and we can send Jason to the
01:01 - browser so I'm using the code from the
01:05 - previous example I have removed the
01:07 - readable streams and writable streams
01:09 - code from here because we are not going
01:12 - to use them in this code and we are
01:16 - going to directly use this response
01:19 - variable to send the data using response
01:22 - dot and ok so first of all we need to
01:26 - change the content type right so here
01:29 - previously we were sending the text for
01:32 - a slash HTML but because we want to send
01:36 - now the JSON data so you just need to
01:40 - write application forward slash Jason
01:43 - okay and then this means that we want to
01:48 - send the JSON data and browser will be
01:51 - able to pass this JSON data
01:53 - appropriately right now in the next step
01:57 - we will create our JSON objects so you
02:00 - can use a JSON file for that or you can
02:05 - create a JSON object using the code also
02:08 - so I am going to create my JSON object
02:11 - using the code but this can be done also
02:15 - using the Jason file so you can create a
02:18 - Jason file here and read this Jason file
02:21 - and then convert it to for example
02:24 - stream and then send it to the browser
02:27 - right so let's create a Jason so far for
02:31 - example the Jason obj purchase an object
02:35 - and inside this brackets we can add some
02:40 - elements to the Jason
02:42 - so what elements we want for example we
02:45 - want the name some name and thing can be
02:50 - max and then the so name for example and
02:56 - this can be something and the H for
03:02 - example each can be 26 okay so this is
03:10 - our JSON object and this you want to
03:13 - send it to the browser so we can simply
03:16 - use this response variable and then call
03:20 - a method called end which we have been
03:24 - using in the previous video also so just
03:27 - write and and then you just pass your
03:31 - jason object here bust this code will
03:36 - not work because the browser or whatever
03:40 - you want to send using this method
03:43 - it only takes the streams or the string
03:46 - as an argument and this is our object so
03:49 - we want to convert this JSON object to a
03:52 - stream and how we can do this we can do
03:56 - this using a method called Jason dot
04:00 - stringify which will convert our jason
04:03 - to a string okay so this is the method
04:07 - jason dot stringify which takes our
04:10 - argument you can see the details here so
04:14 - it takes object as an argument which can
04:17 - be a chaser right so this is our code
04:21 - and
04:22 - what this object will be converted to a
04:25 - string and then using this method it's
04:27 - going to be sent to the browser so let's
04:30 - run our server first of all and it has
04:34 - some errors so let's see what the error
04:36 - is so the error is instead of equal to
04:42 - PI I need to use this :
04:44 - yeah and once again run the code and
04:47 - then use the browser to see the response
04:51 - and you can see our response Jason is
04:54 - here right I'm going to make it a little
04:56 - bit bigger so this is our response Jason
04:59 - now in order to inspect this you can
05:02 - just right click on your browser and
05:04 - then click inspect in Google Chrome I
05:07 - think this is the same option inspect
05:10 - element or inspect right so click this
05:12 - and then go to a tab called Network okay
05:18 - so go to network here and you need to
05:21 - reload our page so you can click this
05:23 - reader load button and you can see it
05:27 - has the status 200 which we are sending
05:30 - from the code this code right and then
05:33 - we will see the content type also so
05:35 - just click on this you know get method
05:39 - and you can see here the content type is
05:43 - application for slash Jason so this is
05:47 - send using this code and then when you
05:52 - go to the response here response tab
05:55 - this tab you can see this Jason is
05:58 - passed and shown in comment in way right
06:02 - so in this way you can send a Jason to
06:07 - the browser using no Cheers ok and this
06:10 - is also a very useful technique whenever
06:13 - you want to you know send some dynamic
06:16 - data to the browser for example you want
06:20 - to fill some table using this Jason data
06:23 - then you can do this right because you
06:26 - can pass this Jason data based upon the
06:29 - alum
06:29 - and values right so I hope you've
