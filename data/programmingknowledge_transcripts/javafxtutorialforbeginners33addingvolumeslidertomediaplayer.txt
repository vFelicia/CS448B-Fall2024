00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Java effects tutorial for beginners in
00:05 - the last two videos we have been seeing
00:07 - how we can create a media player using
00:11 - Java fix and we have written a code to
00:14 - load of a media file resize it and to
00:18 - add some functionality like play pause
00:21 - or play faster or play slower or move
00:24 - the video to the start or to the last
00:26 - now in this video we will try to add a
00:30 - volume bar to your media player so we
00:34 - can control the volume of our media
00:36 - player so let's get started so first of
00:40 - all what I'm going to do is I'm going to
00:42 - open my main dot F XML file in scene
00:46 - builder and in this scene builder what
00:48 - I'm going to do is I'm going to search
00:50 - for a slider which is a horizontal
00:52 - slider and I'm going to drag and drop in
00:55 - my bottom you know horizontal box for
01:00 - each box which I have here okay
01:02 - so just drag and drop this slider here
01:05 - and then you have some functionality of
01:09 - your slider for example minimum value
01:11 - maximum value just okay for us 0 and 100
01:15 - and we can set the initial value also
01:18 - from here but we are going to set the
01:20 - initial value or value to the slider
01:23 - using the code not from here which will
01:27 - be better for us and then we will just
01:30 - give the ID to our slider we can say
01:34 - it's our volume slider okay and just
01:39 - copy the name save your F XML file go to
01:44 - your project refresh your project and go
01:47 - to the main controller dot Java class
01:50 - and in here first of all we are going to
01:53 - add this slider so just right at the
01:56 - rate F XML and then slider search for
02:01 - the slider and the name of the slider is
02:05 - volume slider as we have given in the F
02:08 - XML file right now using this volume
02:13 - slider
02:13 - what we can do is first of all we will
02:15 - go to our initialize method which is
02:18 - like a first method which will be called
02:21 - when this app will run or this class
02:25 - will run and what we are going to do is
02:28 - first of all take the slider and then
02:31 - dot set value so just call set value and
02:38 - then we will call our Media Player
02:42 - instance here and then we will call a
02:46 - method called get volume okay so just
02:50 - write get volume and this volume if you
02:54 - hover over on this method you can see
02:56 - the default value of this get value
03:01 - method is 1 and 1 means here is maximum
03:06 - value and 0 means the minimum value okay
03:09 - and you can see in the slider if you
03:12 - observed in the properties our maximum
03:15 - value for the slider was hundred right
03:18 - so it's hundred times more so what we
03:22 - can do here is we can multiply this gate
03:25 - value by 100 which will be you know
03:29 - proportional to our volume property okay
03:33 - and now in the next step what we are
03:36 - going to do is we will take a volume
03:39 - slider once again and then call a
03:42 - property called value change property or
03:47 - value property and then call a method
03:49 - called add listener and in the
03:52 - constructor of this add listener we will
03:55 - just write new invalidation listener
04:00 - okay so just search for new invalidation
04:03 - listener and you can see it has given us
04:07 - this default method using this
04:10 - invalidation listener right and inside
04:13 - this invalidated method what we want to
04:16 - do is we want to set the value according
04:18 - to the value set on the volume slider
04:21 - right so just take your MP or media
04:26 - player object
04:27 - and then just call a method called set
04:30 - volume and this set volume takes a
04:33 - double value right which can be taken
04:36 - from the value of the slider so just
04:39 - take the volume slider dot get value and
04:44 - this will give you the value in
04:48 - proportional to hundred right so to
04:51 - convert this value to match with your
04:54 - Media Player value you need to divide it
04:57 - by 100 right in here we have multiplied
05:00 - it and in here we need to divide it okay
05:03 - and then save your project and build
05:07 - your project and then run your project
05:11 - so run it and now our app is running so
05:15 - let's play our app and pause the app and
05:20 - you can see this slider is on 100 right
05:24 - so the default value which was given by
05:27 - this get volume method is one which is
05:30 - multiply it by 100 and this value is set
05:33 - to your volume slider right once again
05:38 - I'm going to play my video and then I'm
05:42 - going to move this slider and see what
05:45 - happens with the volume so you can see
05:49 - the volume has been reduced to the
05:53 - minimum value of the slider which is
05:55 - zero right and you know as you increase
06:00 - this volume slider the volume will also
06:03 - increase so in this way you can add a
06:12 - volume slider to your media player I
