00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome back to our
00:01 - YouTube channel and welcome to this
00:03 - video this is the part 9 of our laravel
00:07 - for beginners tutorial series in the
00:09 - previous video we have worked with the
00:12 - controller or post controllers we have
00:15 - added their outs so you've tried to open
00:17 - the web dot PHP in our routes folder so
00:21 - as you can see we have defined here
00:23 - route and then the resource and then the
00:26 - name is post and our controller which is
00:30 - post controller and then we also added
00:33 - or generated the post controller class
00:37 - so ii see here we have here all the
00:40 - functions that we need in order for us
00:43 - to work with our code or create read
00:47 - update and delete functionality of our
00:51 - project and in this video we're going to
00:53 - continue working with our post
00:54 - controller and try to fetch data coming
00:57 - from our database and display it on our
00:59 - browser by the way guys if you try to
01:02 - open our post model so as you can see we
01:06 - haven't done much here and if you want
01:09 - to change the table name you can change
01:12 - it here and also you can change the
01:14 - primary key so it's a for example you
01:17 - want to change the table name here so
01:20 - for table name and then protected and of
01:27 - course the variable table equals the new
01:32 - name or the name of your table that you
01:36 - want in your database and of course you
01:40 - can also change the primary key because
01:41 - by default we have we are using the ID
01:45 - auto increment ID so you can also change
01:49 - that in here so protected say for
01:51 - example protected and then the primary
01:53 - key primary key it was ID there you go
02:01 - or you can change it into public so
02:06 - public primary key and then say for
02:09 - example you if you want to name it as
02:12 - item underscore
02:14 - so for example you want to name it as
02:17 - item underscore ID as the primary key so
02:20 - you can do that also by by default we're
02:23 - using the ID right and also if you want
02:26 - to change or if you don't want to
02:29 - include the timestamps that we have or
02:33 - that has been added automatically for us
02:36 - so time stamps remember that created at
02:40 - and updated at fields so we can set it
02:47 - to false to not include that in our
02:50 - database so you can do that here but I'm
02:55 - going to show you now how to display the
02:59 - data coming from our database into our
03:01 - page or post page because let's open our
03:05 - project in our breath so this is the
03:09 - home page right and if you try to go to
03:11 - the post section and the page is
03:18 - currently now blank but we can change it
03:21 - because currently it is loading the
03:25 - index function coming from our post
03:29 - controller which is now returning or it
03:32 - doesn't return anything for now so we
03:34 - will change this and we will return in
03:37 - the view for our index so we're just
03:39 - going to edit this so instead of
03:42 - returning empty it should return a view
03:46 - so it should be a file under post
03:50 - directory and then the name should be
03:53 - indexed at blade that PHP so there you
03:56 - go so we need to create that in our view
03:59 - so resources and then views and then we
04:04 - need to create a new folder here so it
04:08 - should be post and there should be a
04:13 - file here that says index that blade
04:20 - that PHP so there you go and in here
04:25 - let's just stay
04:26 - the layout coming from our layouts
04:29 - folder so layouts and app and of course
04:34 - we need to add the suction content for
04:38 - our content to be here especially the
04:43 - post so and section need to add end of
04:50 - the section here and of course we are
04:52 - going to place an h1 to have our post
04:57 - there and now let's try to preview our
05:00 - post page so as you can see we have the
05:06 - navigation bar and the h1 post and now
05:10 - let's try to get all the posts coming
05:13 - from our database so in our post
05:16 - controller instead of returning just the
05:19 - post index so we can return the actual
05:26 - post so we can use the post model
05:31 - because we're using the eloquent so it
05:34 - is basically just a object relational
05:37 - mapper and in here we can just say post
05:40 - double colon and then all so it will
05:43 - return all the records or all the posts
05:47 - coming from our database so I just
05:52 - comment this one out and also this and
05:57 - also this one so save and then review
06:01 - our code so refresh this page and we
06:06 - have some sort of error here so class
06:08 - HTTP controllers post not found so
06:12 - that's because we then click or use the
06:18 - app post here so we're just going to add
06:21 - that so use app backslash and then post
06:25 - and then semicolon and then save that
06:29 - and let's go back to our browser and
06:31 - refresh so there you go you can see that
06:35 - all the posts coming from our post table
06:37 - in our database has been loaded
06:39 - and it is an array so let's go back to
06:42 - our post page and try to iterate this
06:46 - array to actually display the title so
06:51 - instead of returning the just the post
06:54 - so we're just going to return the actual
06:58 - variable post so this will be returned
07:01 - view with and of course the name is post
07:07 - and our actual variable is post so it
07:11 - should be S or with s because this
07:14 - variable should contain all the posts
07:17 - coming from our database so save this
07:19 - and in our index that laid that PHP
07:22 - we're going to iterate all the posts
07:26 - coming from our database so let's just
07:28 - do that and in here we'll be adding a
07:33 - condition so at if and then count so
07:38 - first we're going to check if the post
07:40 - array has an element so pose is greater
07:45 - than 1 and then we're just going to have
07:50 - an else here and of course the end of
07:55 - our if statement if there's an element
07:58 - inside the post array so we're going to
08:01 - iterate that by using the for each and
08:04 - then post and individual posts there and
08:12 - we're just going to use the bootstrap
08:17 - element for a division so and if for now
08:21 - or end of our for each and of course
08:27 - this one is coming from our bootstrap
08:31 - implementation so class well and it
08:35 - should contain the h3 it will hold the
08:40 - title of our posts so post and then the
08:45 - title of course and let's try to preview
08:49 - this in our browser so save this one
08:52 - and refresh so there you go we have the
08:57 - post one in post too so we can add also
09:02 - decorated add variable or created add
09:06 - attribute in this so we can see that
09:09 - when it is created and also we can make
09:13 - this title as link so we can actually
09:16 - click on this and then redirect it to
09:19 - another page specifying the ID and then
09:22 - we can see all the details of that
09:24 - particular post so let's go back to our
09:27 - code and and in here let's add an
09:31 - element so small so this will hold the
09:35 - date that the post has been created so
09:39 - small and then it should be written on
09:46 - the double braces the post variable and
09:52 - of course decorated add attribute so
09:57 - save this and preview our page in a
10:00 - browser and refresh so as you can see we
10:05 - have the post one post over and of
10:08 - course the day that when it is created
10:11 - and let's make this post one or post two
10:15 - as a link so let's go back to our code
10:18 - editor and instead of just returning the
10:20 - h3 here we're going to add a link
10:24 - element so H or h3 and inside that is
10:27 - the link element so href and then double
10:32 - code so we should close this one here so
10:36 - a for our link and then of course it
10:41 - should be redirecting into the post page
10:45 - specifying the post ID so and then ID
10:52 - let's try that save this and let's go
10:56 - back to our browser and refresh so as
11:01 - you can see the post 1 and post o title
11:04 - has been converted into link
11:06 - and then we can actually click on this
11:09 - and we can see that is blank for now
11:13 - because we haven't configured yet this
11:17 - particular page so in the next video
11:19 - we're going to discuss and continue
11:21 - working on with this how to view your
11:24 - information coming from the database so
11:27 - I hope you learned something from this
11:28 - video and see you in the next video of
11:30 - Thanks
