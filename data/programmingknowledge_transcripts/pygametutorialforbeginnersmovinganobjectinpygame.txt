00:04 - hey everyone in the last video we made
00:07 - our own snowfall and tried to use the
00:09 - basic concepts to make something better
00:12 - this time we would again move an object
00:14 - around but the movement would be user
00:16 - controlled
00:18 - last time if you remember it was
00:20 - pre-programmed
00:21 - so if I say user control that means we
00:24 - would take the
00:25 - keyboard inputs
00:27 - and move our figure around the screen
00:30 - according to those inputs I hope you
00:33 - remember the key module we talked about
00:35 - in the second video now it's time we put
00:38 - that to use
00:40 - let's get to the code right away we
00:42 - would go step by initializing Pi games
00:44 - setting up a screen the screen size I
00:46 - have taken it to be 500 by 500 you can
00:49 - take any screen size not a problem I
00:51 - have also set up a caption which is
00:54 - moving the given object
00:56 - then we have declared the initial
00:58 - position of the object as X comma y it
01:01 - is 100 comma 100 it is the position on
01:04 - screen we would find our object right
01:06 - after we run the code
01:08 - cool
01:09 - then we have to set up the speed
01:12 - the speed by which the object would move
01:14 - the speed by which we want the object
01:16 - move
01:17 - so it is set up to 3 which means the
01:20 - object should be displayed by three
01:22 - units along the given axis on pressing
01:25 - the respective key once
01:28 - then we have the size of the object I
01:31 - have tried to make a man figure with a
01:33 - circle and rectangle it's my object
01:34 - that's what I want to move around
01:37 - so this width and height is for that
01:39 - rectangle if you didn't understand you
01:42 - would get it when I draw the figure
01:44 - okay
01:46 - so then we have our game Loop the
01:49 - regular one
01:50 - I have given a time delay of 10
01:52 - milliseconds so that object doesn't run
01:55 - and we can observe the defined speed
01:57 - properly
01:58 - dealer is used to pause the program and
02:01 - so we have a refreshed screen after that
02:05 - then we have our events Loop
02:07 - used for handling events and quit the
02:10 - program if asked to do so
02:13 - then I have taken a key variable that
02:16 - would contain a list or sequence of the
02:19 - status of all the keys on the keyboard
02:21 - key is a list of booleans that can be
02:24 - accessed like this
02:26 - we just access it like a normal list but
02:29 - the indexing is done using the key
02:31 - constants so this is done with the help
02:34 - of
02:34 - unders get underscore pressed method
02:39 - the one key that is pressed its state is
02:42 - true other Keys have a false state
02:46 - so I have these four conditions my
02:48 - object can move around in only four
02:51 - directions
02:53 - left right up and down so accordingly I
02:57 - have these four conditions when I press
02:59 - the left Arrow key I will reduce the
03:02 - speed units
03:03 - from current x coordinate
03:06 - when the right arrow key is pressed
03:09 - I will increment the x coordinate by
03:11 - speed units and similarly for going up
03:14 - and down I decrease or increase the y
03:17 - coordinate respectively
03:19 - I would print what Arrow key I have
03:22 - pressed or
03:23 - so that it is it is easy for you to
03:26 - understand and there is no confusion
03:28 - this x greater than 0 and x less than
03:31 - 500 minus width then y greater than 0 y
03:34 - less than 500 minus height these all
03:37 - conditions are used to keep the object
03:40 - within the screen so that the object
03:42 - doesn't run out of the screen
03:44 - so that should be easy to understand
03:47 - now this is the code for making my man
03:50 - flicker so it's just a circle on a
03:53 - rectangle
03:54 - so you use the rect function in draw to
03:58 - draw a rectangle here x comma y are the
04:01 - coordinates or position of the rectangle
04:03 - and width and height are for the size
04:06 - then there is a circle
04:09 - now to place the circle right on top
04:11 - middle of the rectangle
04:13 - I found the mid of the width and also
04:16 - reduced Y axis by 5 so that there is
04:20 - just an overlap of two units between
04:22 - rectangle and the circle
04:25 - I hope you understand the height of the
04:28 - rectangle with 7
04:30 - and if I reduce the y-axis this 7 by 5
04:33 - there is an overlap of only two units
04:36 - hope you can visualize it
04:38 - then we update the program
04:41 - and let's run it
04:49 - okay so this is what we get when we run
04:52 - this code
04:54 - we find our object at the
04:57 - initialize position it's 100 comma 100
04:59 - it's that coordinates 100 comma hundred
05:02 - now if I press the right arrow key I
05:05 - should see right arrow key printed and
05:07 - the object should also move right cool
05:09 - let's do it once
05:12 - the object move right
05:14 - and right arrow key was also printed let
05:17 - me press the down arrow key so it should
05:20 - move down
05:22 - it moved down the object moved down now
05:26 - let's try for left Arrow key we have
05:28 - left auto key printed and it also moved
05:31 - left
05:32 - let me press left Arrow key again
05:35 - so yeah it's going left again I'm gonna
05:37 - press left Arrow key yeah so let me take
05:41 - it to the origin
05:42 - cool
05:44 - in the next video we would try to make
05:46 - the snake game we would try to create
05:49 - that on our own a video game a live
05:52 - working video game
05:54 - for that this moving object program
05:57 - would be very important if you
05:59 - understood this moving object program
06:01 - then the Snake Game program would be
06:04 - very easy for you
06:06 - and
06:08 - from the next video onwards we would put
06:11 - to use all that we have learned till now
06:13 - all the basics that we have learned now
06:15 - and things are going to be very
06:17 - interesting
06:19 - so from now on we would look at the real
06:23 - application of Pi game module which is
06:26 - video game creation things are going to
06:28 - be very fun and easy
06:30 - I hope you're understanding what all I
06:33 - have explained till now everything that
06:35 - I have taught you
06:37 - thank you
