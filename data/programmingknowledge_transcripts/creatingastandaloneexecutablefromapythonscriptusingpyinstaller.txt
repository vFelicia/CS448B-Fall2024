00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can create a standalone
00:04 - executable file using your Python
00:07 - scripts so let's say I have a project
00:10 - and it contains some Python scripts or a
00:15 - Python script and let's say I want to
00:18 - convert this test dot py into an
00:21 - executable file so on Windows it will be
00:24 - dot exe file or on Linux it will be a
00:28 - binary file which I can execute by
00:31 - double clicking so for that for
00:33 - converting your Python scripts into an
00:37 - executable file we can use a utility
00:41 - called PI installer so you can see there
00:45 - is a website called PI installer dot
00:46 - o-r-g
00:47 - and you can find more about this PI
00:50 - installer utility on this website and PI
00:53 - installer is a Python application which
00:56 - creates standalone executable file under
01:00 - Windows Linux or your Mac's operating
01:04 - system so for using PI installer you
01:09 - need to have pip installed on your
01:12 - operating system so what is PIP first of
01:16 - all if you don't know what is PIP you
01:19 - can just go to this website
01:20 - pi PI dot o-r-g py p i-- dot o-r-g and
01:25 - pip is a package management system which
01:29 - is used for the management of the Python
01:33 - applications so for using PI installer
01:37 - you need pip and how you can install pip
01:41 - on your operating system you just need
01:44 - to install Python on your operating
01:47 - system pip will be automatically
01:49 - installed with the installation of
01:52 - Python so you don't need any extra strap
01:55 - to install this pip on your operating
01:59 - system so if the Python installed the
02:03 - latest version then pip is going to work
02:06 - I have already created a video about how
02:09 - to install Python on your Windows
02:12 - operating system let's say
02:13 - so I will just put the link in the
02:15 - description so you can see that video
02:17 - and move ahead so once you have
02:21 - installed Python you can just open the
02:25 - command prompt and once the command
02:28 - prompt is open you can check if pip is
02:31 - installed or not using this command just
02:34 - give P IP - - version and if this
02:38 - command gives any useful reply for
02:42 - example in my case it says pip and the
02:45 - version of pip which is installed on my
02:48 - system and which python version it's
02:51 - using so this is the python version it's
02:55 - using and this is the pip version which
02:57 - is installed on my system so once this
03:00 - command works then what I can do is I
03:04 - can go to the PI installer website and
03:07 - you can see it's a simple command to
03:10 - install the PI installer so you just
03:11 - need to give this command pip install PI
03:14 - installer in order to install PI
03:17 - installer so let's copy and paste this
03:20 - command pip install PI installer and
03:22 - then press ENTER and it will take a few
03:27 - seconds to install by installing utility
03:31 - using pip so once this installation
03:34 - command is finished successfully you can
03:36 - see it's finished successfully on my
03:39 - terminal what I will do is I will just
03:42 - go to my installer website and see how
03:45 - to use it so it's the it's a very simple
03:49 - usage of this pious taller command you
03:52 - just need to give the PI installer
03:54 - command and after that the name of your
03:57 - python script so let's do that so what
04:00 - I'm going to do is I'm going to go to
04:03 - this folder where my python script is
04:06 - there so I'm going to just restart my
04:09 - command prompt and once the command
04:11 - prompt is open I'm going to just copy
04:14 - the part of this python script and then
04:17 - I'm going to just say CD and the path
04:19 - and then press Enter let me just make it
04:23 - a little bit bigger and let me
04:26 - just move this folder Explorer so in
04:29 - order to convert this test dot py a
04:32 - script into the executable file you just
04:35 - need to give this command PI installer
04:37 - space the name of your python script
04:40 - which is test dot py in my case and then
04:42 - press enter and it's going to take some
04:46 - time and you can see some folders and
04:49 - files are created by pi installer inside
04:52 - the project folder for you so once this
04:55 - pi installer command is finished you
04:58 - will see in addition to your python
05:01 - script there are a few folders which are
05:03 - created so the interesting folder for
05:06 - you will be this folder which is the DI
05:10 - st or dist folder so i'm going to go
05:12 - inside this dist folder and then i'm
05:15 - going to go inside the test folder so
05:17 - this name will be the same as your
05:21 - python script name so i'm going to go
05:23 - inside this folder and here you will be
05:26 - able to find an exe file with the same
05:29 - name as your python script so because my
05:32 - python script name was test dot py
05:34 - that's why the executable file name is
05:37 - test dot exe file so let me just double
05:41 - click this file and you can see when i
05:44 - double-click this executable file it
05:47 - will give me the same output as my
05:51 - python script is going to give me so
05:54 - this is how you can convert your python
05:58 - script into our executable file so let
06:02 - me also show you the output of the
06:03 - python script so let me just clear this
06:06 - console here and then I'm going to just
06:09 - say Python and then test dot py and you
06:14 - can see the executable file gives me the
06:16 - same output as this command is giving me
06:19 - now you might observe one minor issue
06:22 - here and this issue is you can see there
06:26 - are lot of dependency files which are
06:29 - created by PI installer for just running
06:32 - this test dot exe file so what if I just
06:36 - need to create this test dot exe
06:40 - doubt all these dependencies so let's go
06:43 - back to my project so this was the
06:46 - project and I'm going to delete all
06:48 - these generated the files and folders
06:51 - which were created by PI installer and
06:54 - once again I'm going to give the same
06:57 - command which is PI Staller test dot py
07:01 - but I'm going to add one extra flag here
07:05 - which is - - one file flag so what this
07:11 - flag will do is it's going to just
07:14 - create one exe file without the
07:19 - dependency files so let me just give
07:22 - this command and let's see what happens
07:24 - when I give this PI installer command
07:27 - with one file flag so now you can see
07:30 - all these folders are recreated but when
07:34 - I go to the dist folder here you can see
07:39 - this time only test dot exe file is
07:41 - created without any extra dependency
07:45 - right so all the dependencies will be
07:48 - bundled with this exe file and only one
07:52 - file will be created and this is much
07:54 - better than creating all the
07:57 - dependencies and just transferring all
08:00 - the dependencies to your client or
08:03 - anyone so let me just double click this
08:05 - also and you will see it's going to give
08:08 - you the same result so if you want to
08:11 - create only one exe file without any
08:14 - dependencies you just need to give this
08:16 - flag which is - - one file and you will
08:21 - just get only the exe file once again
08:24 - let me just give the CLS command to
08:27 - clear the terminal now I have one more
08:30 - example for you so let me show you the
08:33 - second example and let me go inside this
08:35 - folder which is tkinter project and let
08:39 - me just run this project so I'm going to
08:41 - just go back one folder and then I'm
08:44 - going to CD into the Kinta underscore
08:48 - project and let me just run this python
08:52 - script
08:53 - quick and this is the output of this
08:56 - Python script so this is a window which
08:59 - I want to open and I want to convert
09:01 - this Python script into an executable
09:04 - file so this Python script uses Kinta
09:09 - for creating this window so there are
09:13 - some dependencies which you need to
09:15 - import inside your Python script now in
09:18 - order to convert this into an executable
09:21 - file you might already know the answer
09:24 - how to convert it you just need to give
09:26 - this command PI installer space - - one
09:29 - file and the name of your script which
09:31 - is going to create an executable file
09:35 - using this Python script and once again
09:38 - when I go inside this dist folder you
09:41 - can see this main underscore window dot
09:44 - exe file is created and when I double
09:47 - click on this window then there is a
09:50 - terminal which is opened first and then
09:53 - after few second your real application
09:56 - will start so now the real application
09:59 - which is this kinter window is started
10:04 - now so you can see us little problem
10:06 - here which is this terminal window
10:09 - always opens before opening your real
10:11 - application which is this Bindu so how
10:15 - can I just remove this terminal and I
10:20 - just want to open this registration form
10:23 - without this terminal so there is one
10:26 - more flag which you need to add in order
10:28 - to achieve this so I'm going to just
10:30 - close these two windows and terminal and
10:34 - for now let me just remove all these
10:38 - directories so delete and let me just
10:42 - clear the terminal and in addition to
10:46 - your - - one file flag what you need to
10:51 - do is you just need to give one more
10:53 - flag which is - W ok so PI installer - -
10:59 - one file space - W and then your script
11:03 - name and then I'm going to just
11:06 - Center which is once again going to
11:08 - create these directories so once this
11:11 - command is finished I'm going to go once
11:13 - again to the dist folder and run my main
11:16 - underscore Windows dot exe file and this
11:20 - time no terminal will open only your
11:23 - application window will open without
11:26 - opening any console terminal so you can
11:30 - see only my real application is opening
11:33 - without opening any extra console
11:35 - terminal so - W is for opening your real
11:41 - application without any console output
11:43 - now there is one more thing which I want
11:45 - to show you here is for example your
11:48 - project contains some extra dependencies
11:51 - on some extra things which are related
11:57 - to for example your Chrome extensions or
11:59 - any other thing what you can do is you
12:03 - can use a utility called nsis which is
12:08 - open source utility so you can just go
12:11 - to this website which is NSIS dot
12:15 - SourceForge
12:18 - in the description and when you reach to
12:22 - this page you can see the download a
12:24 - button on the right hand side so I'm
12:27 - going to click this download button
12:28 - which is going to open this page and
12:31 - then I'm going to just click on the
12:32 - download link here and after a few
12:35 - seconds this executable file for NSIS
12:39 - utility will be downloaded on my system
12:42 - you can see it's about 1.4 megabytes so
12:45 - it's not a big file so you can directly
12:48 - install it and then run this executable
12:51 - file and once you run it let me just
12:55 - minimize the browser and also let me
12:57 - just minimize these windows and this is
13:01 - the Installer window so I'm going to
13:03 - just click Next I agree and then leave
13:06 - everything as default next and this will
13:08 - be the location click install and once
13:11 - this nsis utility is installed you can
13:16 - just leave this checkbox checked which
13:19 - says run and
13:20 - is which is going to run your NSIS
13:23 - application so this is the an sis menu
13:27 - what you need to do is you just need to
13:30 - click on this link which is installer
13:34 - based on zip file so just click on this
13:37 - link installer based on zip file and
13:40 - provide the path for your directory so
13:45 - what you can do here is once you have
13:48 - created your Exe file so there is this
13:52 - Exe file you can name this folder
13:56 - anything for example I will just leave
13:58 - it as dist folder and then you just need
14:03 - to convert it into a zip file so let me
14:06 - convert it to a zip file so I'm going to
14:09 - just say add to archive and then I'm
14:12 - going to create a zip file and then I'm
14:14 - going to just say ok which is going to
14:18 - create this zip file and inside this zip
14:20 - file
14:21 - you already know my Exe file is there so
14:24 - once you have created your zip file just
14:26 - copy the path of this directory and go
14:31 - to this window which is opened using
14:33 - NSIS and then just give the part of your
14:37 - zip file so this is the zip file I'm
14:41 - going to just give the part of this zip
14:43 - file and then I'm going to just click on
14:45 - this generate button which is going to
14:48 - generate you can see this dist
14:50 - dot exe file ok so once this this dot
14:55 - exe file is created using your zip file
14:58 - you can test this using this test button
15:01 - so just click on test and it's going to
15:04 - open this kind of installation windows
15:07 - so this this dot exe file you can just
15:11 - give to your clients or your colleagues
15:14 - in order to install this Exe file on
15:18 - their operating system obviously it
15:21 - should be a Windows operating system so
15:23 - I'm going to just double click on this
15:25 - Exe file and it will work like a normal
15:28 - installer now one thing to note about PI
15:31 - installer utility is if you want to
15:33 - create
15:34 - it a Windows Exe file you need to run PI
15:37 - installer on your Windows operating
15:40 - system so if you want to create a Linux
15:44 - binary using your Windows operating
15:47 - system PI installer it will not work
15:49 - okay so if you want to create a
15:52 - executable file you use Windows
15:54 - operating system with PI installer if
15:57 - you want to create a Linux binary then
15:59 - just run that python script with PI
16:02 - installer using that operating system so
16:06 - that's it for this video this is how you
16:08 - can create a standalone executable file
16:11 - using your Python script I hope you've
16:14 - enjoyed this video and I will see you in
16:16 - the next video
16:25 - you
