00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video in
00:02 - python tutorial for beginners in this
00:04 - video I'm going to show you how you can
00:06 - write your first Python script in the
00:09 - form of dot py file and execute it but
00:14 - not just by idle but I'm going to show
00:17 - you various different ways you can
00:20 - execute this Python file which you will
00:23 - create so let's get started so first of
00:26 - all I'm going to show you how you can
00:27 - create your Python file using idle so
00:31 - first of all open your idle IDE and just
00:34 - go to file here and you will be able to
00:37 - see at this option here which says new
00:40 - file and then you will be able to see
00:42 - this kind of window opens which is a
00:45 - Python file editor now first of all we
00:48 - are going to save this file so let's
00:49 - save this file you can save this file at
00:52 - any directory or any path wherever you
00:56 - want so for this first file I'm going to
00:58 - name it as hello dot py so dot py is the
01:02 - python extension and Hello is the name
01:06 - of our file so I'm going to save this
01:08 - file first of all and you can see it's
01:10 - saved at my desired location so in this
01:13 - file let's write some Python code so
01:17 - let's say I want to create a program in
01:18 - which I will ask the user to input three
01:22 - numbers and as the output I want the
01:25 - maximum out of these three numbers which
01:28 - is inputted by the user so how can I do
01:32 - this so as we have already seen you can
01:34 - define a variable in Python like this so
01:37 - I'm going to define a variable X is
01:39 - equal to and we also know that there is
01:42 - a inbuilt function in Python called
01:44 - input to take the user input and then in
01:48 - the double quotes so we are going to ask
01:49 - the user that he needs to enter the
01:53 - first number so enter first number and
01:56 - in a similar way I am going to ask the
01:58 - user to enter the second number and the
02:01 - third number let me change the variable
02:03 - name here so instead of X this variable
02:06 - will be Y and the last variable will be
02:09 - Z and this is the third number
02:13 - and this is the second number but when I
02:17 - write the input like this this may give
02:20 - us some problem the problem is input
02:23 - function gives us a string and we need
02:27 - to convert the string into integer or a
02:31 - float so let's convert this number into
02:35 - a float value so you can use another
02:40 - inbuilt function which is float and then
02:44 - this string will be converted to float
02:46 - so I'm going to do the same for other
02:49 - two numbers now in order to get the
02:52 - maximum numbers out of these three
02:54 - numbers we have seen there is our
02:56 - inbuilt function in Python which is
02:58 - called Max and we are going to use this
03:01 - Max function but first of all we need to
03:04 - print something so we will just write
03:07 - the max value is and then we can
03:12 - calculate the maximum value and print it
03:14 - from here so we can use this comma and
03:17 - then we can use this inbuilt function
03:20 - which is Max and then we will just pass
03:23 - these three values which is x y and z so
03:28 - will this program work let's see so
03:31 - first of all before doing anything you
03:34 - need to once again save this file okay
03:37 - so right now you can see there is a
03:39 - little Asterix symbol here in front of
03:43 - my file which means my file is not saved
03:46 - so you need to first of all save your
03:49 - file and then you will see this Esther X
03:51 - is gone that means our file is saved so
03:54 - let's run our code so if you want to run
03:57 - this Python file using your idle IDE you
04:03 - just need to click on the Run button
04:05 - here and then choose the third option
04:08 - which says run module so I'm going to
04:11 - click on run module and after some time
04:14 - you will be able to see this output
04:17 - printed on the idle IDE so it says enter
04:22 - the first number which we have written
04:25 - in our code you can see
04:27 - this line is executed first of all so we
04:31 - will enter some number I'm going to just
04:33 - write 50 here and then press ENTER and
04:35 - then it asks us to provide the second
04:38 - number so let's say this number is 90
04:41 - and now we need to give the third number
04:45 - so I'm going to just give 1 0 1 here and
04:47 - then press ENTER and it says the max
04:51 - value is 1 0 1 which is correct but in
04:56 - real world you will not have this idol
04:58 - ide installed everywhere so how can I
05:02 - run my hello dot py file so I'm going to
05:07 - minimize this idol ID for now and I'm
05:10 - going to go to the location where I have
05:13 - saved this hello dot py file ok so just
05:17 - go to the location where you have saved
05:19 - your hello dot py file and now you just
05:24 - need to double click on this hello dot
05:26 - py file so I'm going to just double
05:29 - click on this hello dot py file and you
05:32 - can see as soon as I double click on
05:34 - hello dot py it opens this program in
05:39 - our terminal ok so once again I'm going
05:42 - to close this terminal and I'm going to
05:44 - double click on my hello dot py file and
05:48 - it opens our program in our terminal so
05:52 - once again I'm going to give three
05:54 - inputs here let's say 1 1 0 enter 55
05:59 - enter 200 and enter as soon as you press
06:04 - ENTER this window disappears so why this
06:08 - window disappears because after the
06:10 - execution of your program this terminal
06:13 - immediately closes so we need to provide
06:16 - something in our program in order to
06:19 - avoid the closing of this terminal and
06:22 - how we can do this we can do this using
06:25 - our input method which is an inbuilt
06:28 - method right and here we can just type
06:31 - press any key to exit so what will
06:38 - happen here is after printing the
06:40 - reserved
06:41 - your terminal will wait for the user
06:45 - input and once the input is given by the
06:48 - user then only the terminal will exit so
06:52 - let's test our program once again but
06:54 - before this don't forget to save this
06:57 - program so I'm going to just save my
06:59 - program and then I'm going to open the
07:01 - folder where I have saved this hello dot
07:04 - EUI file and once again I'm going to
07:06 - double click on this hello dot py and
07:09 - I'm going to give three numbers here and
07:13 - then I'm going to press ENTER and it
07:15 - prints 99 which is the maximum out of
07:18 - three numbers and at last it asks us to
07:22 - press any key so I'm going to press any
07:25 - key for example Z and then press ENTER
07:28 - and this terminal disappears so now the
07:31 - question is how does this Python file is
07:36 - executed without compiling this file so
07:40 - the answer of this question I have
07:41 - already given in the introduction video
07:45 - and the answer is Python is a
07:48 - interpreted language and not the
07:51 - compiled language so what happens in
07:55 - normal languages like Java C++ C you
07:59 - have a source code and this source code
08:02 - you need to compile in order to convert
08:06 - this source code into an executable file
08:10 - for example you have a hello dot Java
08:12 - file you need to compile this Java file
08:15 - in order to convert it into a hello dot
08:18 - class file which is a executable file
08:21 - and when you run this hello dot class
08:24 - file hello world or whatever program you
08:26 - have written will be executed now in the
08:29 - case of Python because it's a
08:31 - interpreted file you just need to create
08:34 - this hello dot py file and you just need
08:38 - to run it you don't need to compile this
08:41 - file and that is the difference between
08:43 - interpreted languages like Python and
08:46 - the compiled language like Java C++ or C
08:50 - now there is one more way using which
08:52 - you can run your Python file
08:55 - and that is by using your command prompt
08:58 - so I'm going to open my command prompt
09:01 - I'm going to right-click on this windows
09:03 - icon and then I'm going to open this
09:06 - command prompt from here so make sure
09:08 - that this command prompt is able to
09:11 - understand this Python command so first
09:15 - of all type Python on your command
09:17 - prompt and then press ENTER and if it
09:20 - shows you this output like python and
09:22 - the version of Python then python is
09:25 - working on your command prompt so this
09:28 - command prompt is Windows command prompt
09:31 - and not the Python shell which we have
09:35 - installed so this is our Windows command
09:37 - prompt right now let me make this
09:40 - terminal little bit bigger so we will be
09:43 - able to see what I'm typing so I'm going
09:45 - to change the font size to let's say 24
09:49 - here so now we will be able to see
09:51 - what's happening you can just right quit
09:54 - and then these two parentheses and then
09:57 - press Enter and you will come out of
10:00 - this command prompt so you need to come
10:03 - out of your command prompt in order to
10:05 - execute your python file now in here
10:08 - what you need to do is you need to copy
10:11 - the path of your Python file so I'm
10:15 - going to right click here and then go to
10:17 - the properties and then in the
10:19 - securities I'm going to just copy full a
10:22 - part of this Python file up to dot
10:25 - Python okay so I have copied full path
10:29 - of this Python file and now what I need
10:32 - to do is I need to just write Python
10:34 - here ok so just write Python and then
10:38 - paste the path which you have copied so
10:42 - I'm going to just paste the path which I
10:44 - have copied and then press Enter and you
10:47 - can see our program is executed so I'm
10:50 - going to just give quickly three numbers
10:53 - and it gives us the maximum of these
10:55 - three numbers now I will just type any
10:58 - letter here and then press Enter and I
11:01 - will come out of this terminal there is
11:04 - one more way of executing your file
11:08 - and this is you need to just give this
11:11 - command which is CD and then your a
11:13 - directory part so up to your directory
11:17 - you just need to copy this path from
11:19 - here okay
11:20 - so you just need to copy this path and
11:22 - then after CD you just need to give
11:24 - space and then paste this path without
11:28 - your hello dot py file okay so I haven't
11:32 - given the hello dot py file name here
11:35 - and now press Enter which will change
11:39 - your directory to your Python directory
11:42 - so now we are inside our Python
11:46 - directory from here you can directly
11:48 - give Python and the name of your file
11:51 - which is hello dot P Y and then press
11:55 - Enter and once again the program opens
11:58 - so we can just give three inputs here
12:01 - and the result is shown once again I'm
12:03 - going to just type any key or any letter
12:06 - here for example R and then press enter
12:09 - and now I'm out of this program so this
12:12 - is how you can run your python script on
12:14 - any terminal you don't need any IDE or
12:18 - any other special software in order to
12:22 - run your python script you can run it on
12:25 - your terminal or directly click on the
12:29 - python file so I hope you have learned
12:31 - something new this time I will see you
12:34 - in the next video so bye for now
