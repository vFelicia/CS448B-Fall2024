00:00 - now in this video we are going to learn
00:01 - about the process in Linux Operating
00:03 - System case so basically in this video
00:05 - we are going to cover multiple things
00:06 - about the process uh what is the process
00:08 - what are the types of process what is
00:10 - the PID and basically we will surely
00:13 - learn about the basic concept of PS
00:15 - command we will just take an overview
00:17 - but in detail we will make a separate
00:19 - video about this on PS command okay
00:21 - so let's start with the process if you
00:24 - are a cc student and if you are a
00:26 - operatic system student also then I hope
00:28 - you are aware of process but if not then
00:30 - I am here for you guys okay so let's
00:33 - start so what is the process so the
00:35 - basic and simple definition of process
00:37 - is execution of a program
00:41 - so now what many of you will ask me what
00:43 - is the program set so program is nothing
00:46 - but a
00:47 - buddy like whatever you write in CPP
00:50 - code or a python code or the Java code
00:52 - that is a program and whenever you
00:53 - execute that program it becomes one of
00:55 - the process
00:56 - but if you take a real life example of a
00:59 - process here here you will see many apps
01:02 - are there if I will open Firefox that
01:04 - will become one of the process if I will
01:06 - open this Thunderbird that will become
01:08 - one of the persons if you will open
01:09 - files that will become one of the
01:10 - process okay so as for definition
01:13 - process nothing but execution of a
01:16 - program
01:17 - when you are executing any program
01:20 - then you are simply creating one process
01:23 - in your operating system
01:26 - moving forward what is a PID
01:30 - so PID is nothing but uh you can say it
01:33 - like as a process ID it is created by
01:37 - the
01:38 - created by machine from balance machine
01:42 - and which what it does which unique is
01:45 - identify is the process Suppose there
01:49 - are multiple processors going on in this
01:51 - Linux operating system so to identify
01:54 - each and every process there are a
01:55 - unique PID like if you are aware of the
01:58 - primary key of bbms so it's similar like
02:01 - that it uniquely identify each and every
02:03 - process okay or if you you will get a
02:07 - real life example of account number so
02:09 - more than one account number cannot be
02:12 - associated with the two different people
02:14 - okay so similarly PID also works like it
02:18 - uniquely identifies the particular
02:19 - process
02:21 - and also uh in Linux there are basically
02:23 - the we learn about the two types of
02:25 - processes mainly that is uh one is the
02:29 - foreground
02:32 - okay
02:33 - and the second one is the background
02:36 - process
02:37 - so as a name suggest you might have
02:40 - guessed like what is the foreground or
02:42 - what is the background so forward means
02:44 - whatever the process which are run by
02:45 - the user so that is the foreground
02:47 - person if I will do here
02:50 - uh what I can do I can just do PWD this
02:54 - is one of the process if I will do who
02:56 - am I it is sorry who am I it is one of
03:00 - the process
03:01 - so whatever the user is entering the
03:04 - command or opening any kind of X
03:05 - application or anything happening that
03:07 - is a pro example of the four dot process
03:11 - and now if we will talk about the
03:13 - background process then in this case uh
03:16 - what happens the operating system has
03:19 - multiple process which runs on the
03:21 - background as for example if you will
03:22 - take an example of the Microsoft Word
03:24 - Ms word so in this what happened
03:27 - whatever you write in uh like you know
03:31 - what we say in a word then if any
03:35 - mistake happens
03:37 - spelling mistake then what happens in
03:39 - that case like it stays as the yeah this
03:42 - is your spelling mistake it like shows
03:45 - in red color
03:46 - so how how is it possible it's possible
03:49 - as the background process running on to
03:51 - check the spelling mistake you might
03:53 - have might happen Okay so this is the
03:56 - concept of the background process okay
03:59 - so in Linux we basically we can also
04:01 - create the vaginal browser using uh I
04:04 - think some kind of ampersand
04:06 - right we use Ampersand to use the
04:09 - background process
04:10 - so yeah as you can see the two one two
04:13 - five one zero or PID has been created
04:16 - for this to create to do who am I as the
04:19 - background process
04:21 - to stop this you can hit just Ctrl Z or
04:24 - Ctrl C TRL C okay so if I will do FS
04:29 - command so it will display me the
04:31 - foreground process I think
04:33 - not FS
04:36 - I will need to like install this command
04:39 - FS or FB it is I am not remembering this
04:42 - like we will cover this all those
04:43 - command and all those things in our next
04:46 - video
04:47 - FPS there may be no not it's not there
04:50 - FP is not there uh let me remember the
04:54 - what is the concept what are the command
04:56 - for the checking format process
04:59 - yeah so FG is the command to get the
05:04 - foreground process so here like no job
05:06 - is it is showing more job okay
05:09 - so if I will do B3 so be there is also
05:14 - there is no background process going on
05:15 - as per this operating system
05:18 - so also we will learn about this some of
05:21 - the command like in the left lecture
05:23 - that is the PS commentary bit which
05:25 - displays of the process State okay so
05:27 - right now it is displaying me the two
05:29 - like what you say
05:31 - two processors so let us clear the
05:34 - screen and surely we will learn in
05:36 - detail about what is the pidtty time CMD
05:39 - now next lecture but let me just show
05:41 - you the example of the foreground
05:42 - process
05:43 - so if I will open up this Firefox right
05:46 - let me just split the screen and I will
05:49 - just do not Firefox I will open this uh
05:52 - let me open Firefox
05:55 - so right now currently it's showing me
05:57 - like this processor but for more you can
06:00 - check vs iPhone e
06:02 - okay so here you can see now Firefox is
06:05 - displaying here like 12630 if I will
06:09 - close
06:12 - okay and again I will check whether it
06:14 - is paying me or not I will just check
06:16 - with the PSI funny
06:19 - okay so here you can see there is no
06:21 - Firefox but when I will open up so
06:24 - Firefox process will get added and it
06:27 - will display me the PID of that Firefox
06:31 - so now again I will just clear the
06:32 - screen and I will again I will enter
06:34 - this PSI funny so here you can see like
06:36 - now different PID is being used for the
06:38 - Firefox now to stop this process review
06:41 - you can use skill command also so kill
06:43 - command and the PID that is the one
06:45 - double three six five and now we're
06:48 - gonna done so we'll fire Focus close now
06:51 - so that's all about uh yeah guys about
06:54 - the process I hope you liked it
06:55 - particular video and surely now next
06:57 - lecture we will get to learn about the
06:59 - foreground how to get foreground
07:01 - background and the PS command
07:04 - okay so we will learn all about these
07:07 - three commands and the process States in
07:09 - our next lecture so thank you guys for
07:11 - watching this particular video and I
07:12 - hope you liked it and if you have any
07:14 - query then you can ask us in the comment
07:16 - section
07:17 - thank you guys and we'll meet you in the
07:18 - next one thank you
