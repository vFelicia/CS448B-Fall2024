00:00 - hello is now in this particular video we
00:01 - are going to learn about the how we can
00:03 - mirror a particular website or download
00:05 - a particular website you can select that
00:06 - also so using W get command so already
00:09 - we have covered the first part of wget
00:11 - command and now in this particular video
00:13 - we will just mirror the website okay
00:16 - so what are the things we will be doing
00:18 - in this particular video so first of all
00:20 - we will mirror the website and secondly
00:22 - we will just locally host the website
00:24 - using python
00:25 - okay and already the python installed in
00:28 - our Ubuntu PC okay
00:29 - this machine so these are the two things
00:31 - we will perform and let's start the
00:34 - implementation part so we will we will
00:36 - use this W get command and some of the
00:38 - options the common option is use hyphen
00:41 - M but it is not suitable to browse that
00:44 - downloaded website locally so
00:45 - additionally we use some other options
00:47 - that is hyphen K and hyphen P option
00:51 - also to browse those website locally in
00:54 - an easy way okay and it downloads the
00:56 - website in a particular format you can
00:58 - select that
00:59 - okay
01:00 - so I have already selected this
01:02 - particular website you can see uh this
01:05 - is a quite a good website and this is
01:07 - nothing but a free template from I've
01:09 - got this from this html.design slash
01:13 - demos Lewis bird uh bird IM okay
01:18 - so you can do this you can also download
01:21 - this template or also any other okay
01:24 - so I'll just copy the URL and I will
01:28 - just paste it here
01:30 - and but before that uh
01:33 - wait a minute I'll just close it
01:36 - I will just create One Directory uh
01:40 - mirror website
01:42 - okay CD mirror website
01:47 - okay and now here I will use those
01:50 - particular
01:53 - this one command okay
01:55 - so now it will fetch all the HTML Pages
01:57 - CSS all the images it is fetching and
02:00 - here we can see contact dot HTML images
02:03 - bird lion dear dog anything whatever is
02:06 - the images and all those things it is
