00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can download the Linux Mint
00:05 - ISO file and install it using virtualbox
00:09 - on your windows 11 operating system
00:12 - so let's get started so let's start with
00:14 - the ISO file download of Linux Mint so
00:19 - just go to your favorite browser and
00:21 - search for Linux Mint and the first link
00:23 - which will appear here will be from
00:25 - linuxmint.com so we are going to click
00:28 - on this link
00:29 - and straight away you will see this
00:31 - download button here also you can see
00:33 - the download link at the top so here you
00:36 - can hover over the download and then
00:39 - click on the latest version so we are
00:43 - going to click on this download button
00:44 - here so once you are on the download
00:47 - page you have three variants of Linux
00:50 - Mint you can download
00:52 - one is the cinnamon Edition which looks
00:55 - like this other is the mate Edition
00:58 - which looks like this and then third one
01:02 - is the xfce Edition which looks like
01:06 - this we are going to download and
01:09 - install the cinnamon Edition so just
01:12 - click on this button which says download
01:14 - under cinnamon Edition and then when you
01:17 - scroll down a little you will see the
01:20 - download mirrors so the first one here
01:23 - is the world mirror I will recommend you
01:27 - to choose the mirror which is near to
01:31 - your location so if you live in USA just
01:35 - choose from one of these options
01:38 - so I'm going to uh choose the first
01:41 - option which is the word option for
01:45 - Simplicity but I will recommend you to
01:48 - download the ISO file from the nearest
01:51 - location from your location so you can
01:55 - see it's around 2.8 GB file so it will
01:57 - take some time to download
01:59 - once this file is downloaded I have
02:02 - already downloaded this file so let me
02:03 - cancel this so once the file is
02:06 - downloaded it's going to look like this
02:08 - Linux Mint and then the version then
02:11 - cinnamon hyphen 64 bit dot ISO file
02:15 - so once you have this ISO file we are
02:18 - ready to install it on our virtualbox
02:22 - so just open your virtual box and we are
02:25 - going to create a new virtual machine so
02:27 - click on new button here
02:29 - and then just write
02:32 - Linux Mint here and
02:37 - Linux Mint is not available in the
02:40 - versions here so you can see when you
02:43 - type Linux Mint you have the type
02:46 - selected Linux automatically and
02:49 - automatically the version which is
02:51 - selected is Ubuntu 64-bit
02:53 - the reason for that is the Linux Mint
02:57 - option is not available here so you can
03:00 - see the Ubuntu option and the other
03:05 - options here you can see but there is no
03:10 - Linux Mint option
03:11 - so that's why we are going to choose the
03:16 - nearest uh version which is Ubuntu
03:21 - 64-bit and then click on next here
03:25 - now here you can choose the hardware
03:28 - right so generally what I do is
03:31 - you can see there is this green Mark
03:35 - here and then there is this red mark
03:37 - here so I move it where the green Mark
03:42 - ends and the red mark starts base memory
03:45 - I can allocate here this much amount of
03:48 - memory and then the processors I can
03:52 - allocate four processors for this one
03:55 - now you have this enable EFI special OSS
04:00 - only for now we are going to uh not
04:03 - going to enable this but you can enable
04:07 - this for for example for Windows
04:09 - operating system so I'm going to click
04:12 - on next so here you can choose the
04:14 - virtual hard disk size so depending on
04:17 - how much amount of hard disk available
04:21 - on your host machine in my case the host
04:24 - machine is Windows right so I can easily
04:28 - allocate 100 GB because I have one
04:31 - terabyte of space available on my
04:34 - Windows operating system so I will just
04:36 - move it around 100 GB but it totally
04:40 - depends on how much memory you have
04:42 - so you can choose that here and then you
04:46 - have the pre-allocate full size here I
04:50 - generally don't like to check this
04:52 - checkbox I want my memory to be
04:54 - dynamically allocated and I don't want
04:57 - to pre-allocate the full size so just
04:59 - leave it as unchecked and then click on
05:01 - next
05:02 - here you can see the summary what you
05:05 - have chosen so
05:07 - our type or version is Ubuntu 64-bit
05:10 - base memory is this one processor 4 and
05:14 - then disk size is around 100 GB in my
05:17 - case and then click on finish here
05:19 - once you click on finish your virtual
05:21 - machine is created
05:23 - now click on Linux Mint here and then go
05:26 - to the settings we can just
05:30 - do some more settings in this settings
05:32 - window for your virtual machine in
05:35 - general section you have these four tabs
05:38 - here go to the advanced Tab and then
05:42 - click on shared clipboard here you can
05:46 - just choose bi-directional for shared
05:49 - clipboard and drag and drop
05:51 - so this is going to allow you to copy
05:55 - from your Windows operating system to
05:58 - your Linux Mint operating system and
06:00 - vice versa right so this is for the
06:03 - shared clipboard and you can also drag
06:05 - and drop files from host to your Linux
06:09 - Mint virtual machine so just choose
06:12 - these two options as bi-directional you
06:15 - have system
06:17 - so here I have already chosen my memory
06:20 - and processors but if you haven't chosen
06:22 - yours you have the option to choose it
06:25 - now
06:27 - so now I'm going to move it to display I
06:30 - will leave everything as default here in
06:32 - the storage you have the option to
06:36 - provide the ISO file
06:38 - so if you remember we have downloaded
06:41 - this Linux Mint ISO file so you can
06:44 - click on this empty option here under
06:47 - controller and then click on this disk
06:50 - icon and then click on
06:53 - the choose a disk file so I'm going to
06:57 - click on choose a disk file and then I'm
06:59 - going to just copy the path where my
07:01 - Linux Mint ISO file is located and then
07:04 - paste it here and then select my ISO
07:08 - file for Linux Mint and then click on
07:09 - open
07:10 - which is going to just set this ISO file
07:14 - for my virtual machine so you can see
07:17 - this ISO file is set here so now I can
07:20 - click on OK
07:22 - and once all the settings are done I can
07:25 - start my virtual machine so click on
07:26 - start here so now you can see uh the
07:30 - Linux Mint installation has been started
07:33 - so here you have few options right the
07:37 - first option is start Linux Mint
07:39 - cinnamon 64-bit you have the
07:43 - compatibility mode you have the OEM
07:45 - install and then test memory mode
07:48 - so we are going to choose the first
07:51 - option which is Linux Mint uh the
07:54 - version cinnamon 64-bit just press enter
07:59 - here if you are on some other
08:02 - version you can use your down or up
08:05 - arrow keys to move up or down right so
08:08 - choose the start Linux Mint which is the
08:11 - first option here
08:14 - which is going to start the Linux Mint
08:16 - on your virtualbox
08:19 - so you can see the Linux Mint virtual
08:21 - machine has been started so now you can
08:24 - have the look and feel of your Linux
08:29 - Mint virtual machine so you can see you
08:32 - can click here and then you can open the
08:35 - terminal from here and you can open the
08:37 - folders or files from here right
08:40 - but the Linux Mint installation is not
08:43 - yet finished right so this is just for
08:45 - the look and feel but here you can see
08:47 - the install Linux Mint option with the
08:50 - disk icon so just click on this uh disk
08:53 - icon here which is going to actually
08:55 - start the installation of Linux Mint on
08:59 - your virtualbox
09:02 - so because we haven't given any username
09:05 - or password to log into our Linux Mint
09:09 - so these are the things we are going to
09:12 - do in the installation step so first of
09:15 - all you need to choose the language in
09:17 - the first step I will choose English
09:19 - here and then click on continue here
09:23 - and then you can choose the keyboard
09:26 - layout right so in different countries
09:28 - people use different keyboard layouts so
09:32 - for example I am living in Germany so I
09:34 - will choose the German keyboard layout
09:36 - if you are not sure you can also select
09:39 - detect keyboard layout from here right
09:42 - so let me choose the German language
09:45 - keyboard layout from here
09:48 - and then I'm going to choose the default
09:50 - German one once you have selected your
09:52 - keyboard layout click on continue
09:54 - and then you have this option so
09:58 - multimedia codex I'm going to click on
10:01 - this checkbox and then click on continue
10:03 - and then you have this option so here
10:06 - you can see this computer currently has
10:08 - no detected operating system what would
10:10 - you like to do erase this can install
10:13 - Linux Mint and then second option is do
10:16 - something else
10:17 - just leave this option which says it is
10:20 - disk and install Linux Mint it's not
10:23 - going to delete your host operating
10:27 - system it's just the option for your
10:30 - virtualbox so it's not going to do
10:32 - anything to your Windows operating
10:34 - system or any other host operating
10:36 - system which you are using it's just the
10:39 - step so don't worry about erasing
10:42 - anything just
10:43 - leave it as it is and then click on
10:47 - install now
10:50 - and then you have this option so write
10:54 - the changes to the disk if you continue
10:56 - the changes listed below will be written
10:59 - to the disk so I will click on continue
11:01 - here
11:03 - and now you can choose the location
11:06 - right so this is for the time settings
11:11 - and date settings so just choose the
11:14 - location which is nearer to your
11:16 - location by default Linux Mint is going
11:18 - to detect the nearest location but if
11:23 - it's not selecting that then you can
11:25 - choose it manually from here and then
11:27 - click on continue
11:30 - now at this point you need to give the
11:33 - username and password and the name of
11:36 - your computer
11:37 - so the name I'm going to give here is
11:40 - code bind here and then the computer
11:43 - name will be code bind hyphen virtualbox
11:46 - because we are installing it on
11:49 - virtualbox but generally I don't want
11:51 - this virtualbox extension here so I just
11:55 - change the name to uh the same name I
11:58 - have given here right
12:00 - so the username in my case is code bind
12:03 - you can leave it as what you want
12:07 - and then give the password so I'm going
12:09 - to provide a very simple password and
12:13 - then once again I'm going to provide the
12:15 - password again
12:17 - you might want to have the strong
12:18 - password
12:20 - and then you have this option require my
12:22 - password to log in and then click on
12:24 - continue
12:27 - and then the installation of Linux Mint
12:30 - will start so you need to wait for few
12:33 - uh minutes at this point so that Linux
12:37 - Mint installation can be finished and
12:40 - now after some time you can see the
12:42 - installation has been completed and you
12:44 - will see this kind of window which says
12:46 - installation is finished you can
12:49 - continue testing Linux Mint now but
12:51 - until you restart the computer and it
12:53 - changes you make or documents you save
12:57 - will not be preserved so we are going to
13:00 - restart our Linux Mint so just click on
13:03 - restart Now button which is going to
13:06 - restart your Linux Mint and now it has
13:09 - been restarted so I'm going to give my
13:12 - password which I have given at the time
13:15 - of installation so let me give that
13:17 - password again and then press enter and
13:19 - now I can see my Linux Mint operating
13:23 - system has been started on Virtual box
13:26 - right
13:28 - for the first time you will see this
13:29 - kind of Welcome window which says
13:31 - welcome to Linux Mint and then you can
13:35 - just go through this tour but if you
13:39 - don't want to do that just click on this
13:41 - cross and then
13:44 - you can start using Linux Mint
13:46 - now let me resize this Linux Mint you
13:49 - can see
13:51 - when I resize my virtual box window
13:54 - the desktop size for Linux Mint is not
13:58 - resizing
13:59 - so to resolve this problem you need to
14:03 - click on devices here and then click on
14:06 - insert guest Edition CD image
14:10 - so basically in order to have all the
14:14 - other features like resizing of this
14:18 - desktop according to the size of your
14:21 - virtualbox window you need to install
14:23 - virtualbox guest editions on your
14:27 - virtual machine and this you can do by
14:30 - clicking on device and then click on
14:31 - insert guest additions CD image
14:38 - and after few seconds you will see this
14:41 - kind of pop-up window which says this
14:44 - medium contains software intended to be
14:46 - automatically started just click on run
14:49 - here and then give your Linux mints
14:52 - password so let me
14:53 - give my password here and then click on
14:55 - authenticate
14:57 - and then it will start the installation
15:00 - of virtualbox guest editions so you just
15:03 - need to wait for few seconds until this
15:06 - installation is finished and once the
15:09 - installation of virtualbox gas station
15:11 - is finished you will see this kind of
15:13 - message at the end which says press
15:16 - return to close this window so at this
15:19 - point you just need to press enter key
15:21 - on your keyboard which is going to close
15:23 - this window and now you just need to
15:26 - restart your Linux Mint once again so
15:29 - click on this icon here click on this
15:32 - red button here and then click on
15:34 - shutdown which is going to shut down
15:37 - your Linux Mint virtual machine and from
15:41 - the next time when you restart your
15:43 - Linux Mint so just select Linux Mint
15:45 - here and then click on start and when
15:47 - your Linux Mint starts you can see when
15:50 - you resize your virtual box window the
15:54 - Linux Mint desktop also resizes
15:57 - accordingly right so let me just
16:00 - give my password again
16:02 - and then I can just maximize this and
16:05 - you can see
16:06 - the Linux Mint window also resizes
16:09 - according to the size of my desktop on
16:12 - my host machine right
16:14 - so now you can start using Linux Mint on
16:18 - your virtualbox on your host machine my
16:22 - guess the host machine is Windows 11.
16:25 - so I hope you've enjoyed this video I
16:26 - will see you in the next video
