00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Java programming for
00:04 - beginners in this video we will see how
00:07 - link list work in Java link lists are
00:12 - similar to array list in a sense that
00:16 - they can contain value or list of values
00:21 - but basically those those two things are
00:25 - totally different in terms of
00:27 - performance and in terms of usage
00:31 - also so let's see how we can uh use
00:34 - links lists in Java so first of all to
00:39 - declare a link list you need to uh use
00:43 - this keyword called link list and in
00:46 - angular bracket you give the data type
00:48 - of uh the list you want to make and then
00:52 - you give your variable name is equal to
00:54 - new instance of Link lists okay and for
00:59 - the first time when you write this code
01:02 - it'll give you little error because you
01:06 - haven't included this link list class
01:09 - which is there in java. utle so you just
01:13 - need to hover over link list and then
01:17 - you just need to import link list so
01:20 - just click this it will import link list
01:23 - class in your program now to add the
01:27 - values you can just do it something like
01:31 - this name do add and then you can add
01:36 - your name so for
01:41 - example some name you can
01:46 - add and some more name you can add like
01:50 - these and to access the values in the
01:53 - list you can use uh this for Loop or
01:58 - Advanced for loop as we can say and we
02:02 - can just use this something like this
02:06 - name is our list name and
02:09 - then you can just print this X and when
02:14 - you run this
02:16 - program you will be able to see your
02:18 - list something like this now in order to
02:21 - add some more values if you want to add
02:24 - the mo value at the top you can just use
02:28 - this list Dot
02:31 - add first and you can add value at the
02:35 - top of this list something like
02:39 - this okay if you want to add the value
02:44 - at the bottom you can do it something
02:47 - like this name dot
02:50 - add at the last
02:54 - okay so you can add this to the last for
02:59 - example example I want to add Zach at
03:02 - the last so whenever I run the program
03:06 - you see in my list at the top the name
03:10 - Jack is there which we added at the
03:12 - first add first using add first method
03:16 - and at the last of my list there is a
03:18 - name called sack which we added
03:22 - using add last method in a similar way
03:26 - you can
03:27 - remove first and last value by using
03:31 - remove method so
03:33 - name
03:36 - dot remove last it will remove the last
03:40 - value name
03:43 - dot remove
03:46 - first and it will remove the first value
03:50 - okay so once again run the
03:53 - program and it removes Jack and Zach
03:56 - from the list okay now if you want to uh
04:01 - remove all the data you can just write
04:05 - name dot clear and it will clear all the
04:09 - data from the list so something like
04:13 - this and nothing is
04:14 - printed if you want to
04:18 - uh get the size of this list you can
04:22 - just print it like
04:25 - this so name dot size
04:30 - and it will print the size of the list
04:33 - run the program and our size of the list
04:37 - is six because it contains six elements
04:43 - okay there are some other methods for
04:46 - example you want to add at some
04:49 - particular position you can add it also
04:53 - for example I can add
04:57 - name Dot
05:00 - add and add can be overloaded so you can
05:05 - give the index of the element for
05:09 - example I want to add at index
05:12 - one uh some element for
05:19 - example index one element okay and run
05:24 - the program and now at the index one I
05:27 - have this index one zero 1 right so you
05:32 - can add on the basis of index
05:35 - also in a similar way uh you can remove
05:39 - on the basis of index so name dot
05:47 - remove at index one it will remove
05:51 - Patrick because at first or zero index
05:55 - Jack is there and at first place or
05:57 - first index
05:59 - Patrick is there so now it's removed and
06:02 - we have only five engs okay so there are
06:08 - some other method like uh set and get
06:13 - method which you can use to set and get
06:16 - the values for example you are not happy
06:19 - with the name Patrick with small P at
06:22 - the starting you can change it
06:25 - to Patrick to the capital P so you can
06:31 - just write set at the index one because
06:35 - Patrick at is at the index one zero is
06:38 - this one Patrick is one and we will
06:41 - remove this otherwise it will remove the
06:43 - first index and then we can just
06:48 - write
06:49 - here Patrick with capital
06:53 - P okay and then semicolon and run the
06:58 - program
07:00 - and it
07:01 - adds Patrick with capital P so it change
07:05 - this name with this name so setting
07:09 - change the name or modifies your list at
07:13 - the particular
07:15 - index so there are some other method and
07:19 - which you can search by yourself you
07:21 - just need to write the name of the list
07:24 - and Dot and here comes all the method
07:27 - which you can use to to access the
07:31 - values to the list insert values in the
07:33 - list sort value there is a method called
07:36 - sort so you can sort it and you can even
07:40 - check if the uh list is empty or not and
07:46 - there are so many method which you can
07:49 - just use and see what suits your
07:53 - requirement so I hope you have enjoyed
