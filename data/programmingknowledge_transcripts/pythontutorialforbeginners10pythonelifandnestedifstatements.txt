00:00 - hello guys welcome once again in the
00:02 - last video I have shown you how to use
00:04 - IFL statements in Python so I have given
00:07 - you a little brief introduction how to
00:09 - use IFL statement but there's more to
00:12 - IFL statement which is u l if statement
00:17 - and nested uh IFL statement so let's see
00:21 - how we can use uh those two so for
00:25 - example I'm going to just uh take a new
00:28 - example so I'm going to do delete all
00:30 - these stuff and for example I want to
00:36 - compare some names this time I want to
00:39 - have a variable called
00:42 - name and I want to take a input from a
00:45 - user that uh he will give me a name and
00:51 - then I will compare the name and I'm
00:54 - going to show the result okay so what I
00:58 - can do is I want to compare the the name
01:00 - right uh so in my if condition I will
01:03 - compare my name if my name and to
01:06 - compare equality you use double equal
01:09 - not this but double equal sign here okay
01:13 - so always remember if you want to uh
01:15 - compare the equality of two string or
01:18 - two values you just use not single uh
01:22 - equal to but you use double equal to if
01:25 - you use single equal to this means
01:28 - assignment so assign so this single
01:31 - equal to means that assign the value
01:34 - whatever user enters to the name but if
01:36 - you use double equal to it means that
01:39 - you want to compare the two values okay
01:43 - so I want to compare this value to for
01:45 - example name called Mark and I can say
01:51 - uh
01:55 - print the name entered is the
02:03 - name entered is and then comma name for
02:10 - example okay now I want to check some
02:15 - more names if user enter some uh other
02:19 - names right so for example if user enter
02:23 - some other name I want to check it so
02:25 - how I can check it just I can check it
02:28 - by L if condition okay so there is a
02:32 - condition called else if this L if means
02:36 - else if okay and then I can check one
02:40 - more condition for example this
02:43 - name is this
02:47 - time
02:49 - John and then I will print uh some other
02:54 - value of so I will uh just print the
02:59 - name of John here so the name entered is
03:01 - John in a same similar way I can have
03:06 - multiple FS conditions like this and
03:11 - just don't remember to give the
03:13 - intent and then for example some other
03:17 - name I can compare
03:19 - or some other name I can
03:24 - compare okay so if you want to uh
03:28 - compare different PR conditions you can
03:32 - use l if condition and else if
03:36 - the condition is false what I can do I
03:40 - can just print that the name
03:44 - entered
03:47 - is not valid for
03:50 - example not valid okay and now I've
03:55 - saved the program and when I run
03:58 - this
04:02 - it ask me to enter a name Al so for
04:05 - example I enter a name mark it says the
04:09 - name entered is Mark okay once again
04:12 - when I run the program once
04:14 - again and this time I enter some other
04:18 - name for example Tom and press enter it
04:22 - says name entered is Tom because it goes
04:25 - here so what's uh the flow of the
04:28 - program so we are checking or we are
04:31 - asking the user to enter any name so
04:33 - when the user enters any name this name
04:37 - goes in this name variable and then the
04:41 - program comes to this place to compare
04:44 - this name to the name called Mark and
04:47 - the if the name is Mark it will print
04:52 - this okay otherwise it'll go on to check
04:57 - uh that if the name is John and and if
04:59 - the name is John it goes here and it
05:02 - print this otherwise it will check if
05:05 - the name is Julie and it will print this
05:08 - okay so in this way your if else
05:12 - statement works or else if or if else
05:17 - else if else if else if else so L if
05:20 - means else if and you can uh compare
05:25 - multiple condition using L if right now
05:30 - for
05:31 - example
05:33 - I want to uh you know have multiple if
05:38 - condition inside my if condition okay so
05:41 - it's called nested if condition okay and
05:45 - I uh tell the user to enter any name and
05:51 - if this name is
05:55 - um let's uh say name uh we assign this
06:00 - value this name to for
06:05 - example we have this name is equal to
06:09 - [Applause]
06:12 - animal
06:14 - animal and then this I declare another
06:19 - variable
06:21 - uh animal name for example animal name
06:26 - and this animal name is uh
06:31 - dog okay so I have a name which is
06:35 - animal and then I have animal name is
06:37 - equal to dog so first of all I want to
06:40 - compare if the name is animal okay so if
06:45 - the name is animal then I will I want to
06:48 - do some some other I want to check some
06:52 - other condition in this uh animal
06:56 - condition so I will just I can just uh
07:00 - give one more condition to check if this
07:03 - animal name is equal to so double is
07:08 - equal to dog
07:10 - okay
07:12 - dog and don't forget this colon and then
07:16 - I will uh print
07:18 - here so if your if statement starts from
07:23 - here in the last video I've shown you
07:25 - that you need to give the um indentation
07:28 - here okay if you write so let me show
07:33 - you
07:35 - print you can just uh print valid
07:39 - animal
07:41 - valid animal okay so why this
07:46 - indentation here is more important is
07:50 - because for example I can just
07:57 - write print uh
08:00 - like this without I only give this
08:03 - indentation so I can
08:07 - say uh
08:11 - name entered
08:15 - is animal okay so see the indentation
08:20 - here here
08:22 - indentation so this statement belongs to
08:25 - this if condition and this print
08:28 - statement belongs to this condition
08:30 - because this comes in the line of this
08:35 - if statement right so whatever you write
08:37 - here in the line of this it will be the
08:41 - condition of or valid condition of this
08:45 - and it will print this one and if uh you
08:51 - know animal name is dog it'll go here
08:55 - and it'll print valid animal so what do
08:57 - you think what happens let's see what
09:00 - happens I will just run my program save
09:04 - it and it says valid animal name entered
09:08 - is animal right
09:12 - so uh and just remember that whenever
09:18 - you want to give uh the statement or
09:21 - code for this if condition just uh make
09:25 - sure that this is in line with this if
09:29 - and whenever you want to give the code
09:31 - for this if condition you just give your
09:36 - statement in this uh or along this line
09:40 - okay so indentation just remember
09:43 - indentation and this is called the
09:45 - nested if else condition so what we have
09:49 - done we have
09:51 - checked if uh this name is equal to
09:54 - animal and if name is equal to animal
09:57 - then we say that um we compare one more
10:02 - condition that if animal name is dog and
10:04 - then we print this or in the case of
10:09 - name uh any this animal name is not dog
10:13 - we can just
10:15 - say else and I can just print one more
10:21 - condition
10:24 - print animal name I can just uh print
10:30 - animal name
10:33 - in valid okay so this is my if else
10:38 - condition inside my another if condition
10:42 - so this is like a parent if and this is
10:44 - like a child F El condition okay so I
10:48 - just change this name some other name
10:51 - cat for
10:52 - example and I save it and I run
10:57 - it and invalid expression because here I
11:01 - forgot the colon save run it once
11:05 - again and now it will print animal name
11:09 - is invalid because it goes here it sees
11:13 - okay name is equal to animal so I go to
11:15 - this condition but animal name is not
11:18 - dog here it's cat so it's it goes in
11:22 - this condition and it says animal name
11:24 - is invalid and then it just print the
11:27 - name entered is animal okay so in this
11:31 - way you can use El if and nested El if
11:35 - statement in Python I hope you have
