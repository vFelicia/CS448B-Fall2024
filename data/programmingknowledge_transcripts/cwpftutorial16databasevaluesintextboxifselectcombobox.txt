00:01 - hello guys welcome to yet another video
00:04 - tutorial on
00:05 - WPF cop
00:08 - application so till now we have made
00:11 - this application where we
00:13 - can log in with username and password
00:17 - and it opens our second form and here we
00:21 - can save update or delete data and in
00:24 - the last two video we have seen how to
00:26 - load or how to link your datab base with
00:30 - your um list box and your combo box in
00:35 - this video I will show you how to
00:38 - show values in the text box when you
00:41 - select some value in the combo box so
00:45 - for example I select this name mark
00:49 - because the combo box is loaded with my
00:53 - column Mark values my column name values
00:57 - sorry and when I select Mark the
01:00 - corresponding value which are related to
01:02 - mark his employee ID name surname and
01:05 - age should appear
01:07 - here so that I will show you today how
01:10 - to show the corresponding value in the
01:13 - text box when some value is selected in
01:16 - the combo
01:18 - box so let's get
01:21 - started I have this code right now and
01:24 - in the last to last video I have shown
01:26 - you how to link your combo box with the
01:30 - database and I have shown you how to
01:33 - load name column values in
01:37 - your combo box
01:40 - so if you haven't seen that video just
01:44 - see that to know the code and just
01:47 - select this combo box and double click
01:49 - it and we reach to the combo box one
01:54 - selection changed
01:56 - event and I'm copying the whole code
01:59 - from from the last to last video where I
02:02 - have shown you how to link your combo
02:04 - box with the database value
02:07 - so this is my fill combo method which I
02:13 - have written in the last to last video I
02:15 - will copy all the code from escolite
02:19 - connection to the end of try catch
02:23 - block and I will once again go to my
02:26 - window and double click it and in this
02:29 - com box selection change event I will
02:31 - paste all the code so what I was doing
02:35 - basically is creating the connection
02:38 - from the database and in the TR catch
02:41 - block I have written the TR catch block
02:44 - to catch any
02:47 - exceptions and then I'm opening the
02:51 - eslite connection in eslite con. open
02:55 - and then I was passing the query select
02:59 - star from employee ID and
03:02 - then I create the excite command where I
03:06 - pass the query and the connection and
03:09 - then I execute query so I write this
03:13 - esite datar Reader Dr is equal to
03:15 - command. ex execute reader and while
03:21 - this data reader continues reading I am
03:24 - showing the
03:26 - values so if you want you can just copy
03:30 - this code I will just focus on the
03:34 - code and we will edit some of the part
03:39 - of this code in order to show the values
03:42 - in the text box so basically we are
03:45 - going to change the query so just go
03:50 - here string query is equal to select
03:52 - star from your table name so we have
03:55 - this
03:56 - table employee info where I have called
03:59 - colum
04:01 - Eid name surname and
04:04 - age so I go here do the code and I write
04:08 - select star from my table
04:11 - name where name is equal
04:16 - to my combo box name so my combo box
04:19 - name is select your combo box
04:24 - and go to the properties here and copy
04:28 - the name of your combo box in my case
04:30 - combo box one go to the code once again
04:34 - and in here write single code in between
04:39 - double quote in between Plus+ and paste
04:42 - your combo box name there and write
04:46 - dot
04:48 - text okay so our query is Select star
04:52 - from employee ID where your name because
04:54 - we loaded
04:56 - names in the combo box in last to last
05:00 - video when we linked our combo box with
05:04 - the database we are showing the names
05:06 - that's why I have written name is equal
05:08 - to combo whatever we select in the combo
05:13 - box so combo box.
05:15 - text and all the code will remain this
05:18 - the same here after that and we are
05:23 - going to change inside this while loop
05:25 - Dr Dr which is DOA reader do read and I
05:32 - was adding the items to the combo box in
05:35 - the last videos and I delete this code
05:40 - here and I will copy this string name is
05:44 - equal to Dr doget string and paste it
05:48 - four times because I have four text
05:52 - boxes to show the
05:55 - values and I will change the name first
05:58 - is
06:00 - e d
06:03 - string s
06:05 - e and I will name rename them s
06:09 - name
06:13 - s
06:15 - surname and
06:17 - S
06:20 - AG I'm adding s before
06:24 - my variable names
06:27 - because it shows St
06:30 - so I just prefer to add
06:34 - s
06:37 - now these are the column the these
06:41 - string variable will take each column
06:46 - value so this is for the column employee
06:49 - ID so I have this First Column which is
06:53 - employee ID right second is name third
06:57 - is surname and fourth is age so index
07:00 - start from 0 1 2 3 so I will change it
07:06 - here first column is zero second is 1
07:12 - third is two and fourth column is
07:17 - three
07:19 - three and now because my employee ID is
07:25 - of data type int I will show you here
07:30 - when I created this data
07:33 - table I assigned this employee ID as
07:37 - integer type name as Vare which is a
07:40 - type of string surname as Vare which is
07:44 - also a string and age is my integer so
07:47 - what I will do
07:49 - is instead of this get
07:52 - string I will write Dr
07:55 - do
07:57 - get in in
08:01 - 32 and this will show error because this
08:05 - is int and we need to convert it into
08:08 - the string so write dot to string
08:13 - bracket and bracket
08:15 - closed same thing we will do for age
08:19 - also because it's also a end type so
08:23 - right
08:24 - dot
08:25 - in
08:28 - 32 and and Dot two string bracket and
08:32 - bracket
08:33 - closed so what this will do is this code
08:36 - will see whatever value selected in the
08:40 - combo box and it reads all the values
08:44 - corresponding to it and it loads
08:48 - corresponding values to this string so
08:51 - it reads the employee ID and loads it
08:53 - loads it in
08:56 - this um string
08:59 - e ID name surname or age right and then
09:04 - what we can do
09:06 - is we will copy the names of our text
09:11 - boxes one by one so First Column name
09:15 - is
09:18 - here Eid
09:21 - text go to the code and just paste below
09:27 - your string variable
09:30 - declarations second column name
09:33 - is not column name is but textbox
09:37 - name text box name is for name text box
09:41 - is name
09:45 - text and paste it just below it I will
09:49 - use it I'm just copying all the text box
09:52 - names the text box name for surname
09:58 - is name
10:02 - txt and the text box name for age
10:09 - is age txt
10:14 - right so age
10:18 - txt I will just arrange them
10:22 - in right
10:25 - Manner and what I will do is I will this
10:29 - is my employee ID textbox name
10:33 - dot text is equal to my Eid string
10:40 - variable
10:41 - okay in the same way name
10:48 - dot
10:50 - text is equal
10:52 - to string variable name s
10:56 - name so name text box name is equal
11:14 - to text is equal to my string variable s
11:22 - surname and last is
11:26 - my age
11:31 - so
11:36 - dot text is equal
11:39 - to my string
11:43 - variable
11:45 - s so what I have done is I have taken
11:48 - the values from the database
11:50 - corresponding to this combo box selected
11:53 - value and now I'm setting the values in
11:56 - your text box right
12:01 - so if you want you can just copy this
12:06 - code and now I will run the
12:09 - code run this
12:11 - code username and
12:14 - password
12:16 - correct and I have
12:20 - these name loaded in my combo box which
12:24 - I have shown you in the last to last
12:25 - video so when I select this the Cor
12:29 - responding values which is there in the
12:31 - database should appear in these text
12:34 - boxes let's see if it happens or
12:38 - not yes it's happening
12:42 - 2
12:44 - 3 four
12:47 - okay so I have this John as
12:51 - [Music]
12:54 - one and let's see in the database if
12:57 - it's showing the right values or
13:02 - not so I have first employee as Mark and
13:08 - his surname
13:10 - is Henry and his age is
13:13 - 33 but when I select
13:16 - this it's
13:20 - selecting random values which is not
13:23 - right right when I select John it's
13:27 - selecting Mark values and when I
13:32 - select this Peter it's selecting the
13:35 - John values so let's see what have I
13:41 - done
13:46 - wrong stop the
13:48 - program so what I have done wrong is I
13:53 - think I have selected wrong event for my
13:57 - action so right now my event is when you
14:02 - select this combo box and when you see
14:05 - the event
14:07 - here my current event is selection
14:11 - changed so instead of using this
14:14 - selection change in
14:16 - events we must select
14:20 - this go
14:22 - above and search for this drop- down
14:26 - closed event just just select this drop-
14:29 - down close event double click it and we
14:32 - reach to the function called combo box
14:37 - one drop down close event so copy all
14:41 - the code from combo box selection change
14:45 - event just copy and cut all the code
14:49 - from there so just make it empty this
14:54 - function combo box one selection change
14:57 - event just just copy all the code cut
15:00 - all the code and paste it here in this
15:04 - uh combo box one drop down close event
15:08 - pasted all the code in this
15:12 - function so what I have done is I have
15:15 - cut all the code from selection change
15:17 - event and pasted all the code in the
15:21 - dropdown closed event the same code we
15:24 - have
15:25 - written earlier and now when you run the
15:30 - program and when
15:34 - you give username and
15:37 - password and when you select the
15:39 - corresponding name corresponding value
15:43 - will come so name and this name is same
15:47 - here and in the database also if you
15:52 - check corresponding value for Mark is
15:55 - employee ID is one which is here surname
15:58 - name is Henry which is here age is 32 33
16:02 - which is here let's select John employee
16:06 - ID 2 which is
16:10 - here soame is same and age is 42 same so
16:15 - now it's giving me the corresponding
16:18 - values
16:19 - correctly okay so just change the code
16:23 - like that so I hope you have learned
16:27 - something new this time please writ
