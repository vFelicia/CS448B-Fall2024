00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can download and install
00:04 - Anaconda python on your Ubuntu operating
00:07 - system
00:09 - so let's get started and let's see how
00:10 - we can do it so first of all open your
00:12 - favorite browser and search for Anaconda
00:14 - download and the first link which will
00:16 - appear here will be from anaconda.com
00:18 - forward slash downloads We are going to
00:20 - click on this link
00:22 - now when you scroll down you can see the
00:25 - option for download for your Linux
00:27 - operating system so I'm going to click
00:29 - on this and it's going to download this
00:32 - Anaconda dot sh file so just wait for
00:35 - the download to complete and once this
00:37 - dot sh file is downloaded let's open the
00:40 - terminal and let's run this file so you
00:43 - can open the terminal by pressing Ctrl
00:45 - alt t on your keyboard or you can just
00:48 - search for terminal in applications and
00:50 - then open the terminal
00:52 - and then once the terminal is open we
00:55 - just will go to the downloads folder by
00:58 - using CD so just try it CD downloads and
01:02 - then write LS here so you can see this
01:06 - Anaconda 3 dot sh file is available here
01:10 - right so once this file is downloaded we
01:13 - need to execute this file we can execute
01:17 - this file using bash for example so just
01:19 - write bash and the name of your anaconda
01:22 - dot sh file just write Anna and then
01:26 - press Tab Key on your keyboard which is
01:29 - going to auto complete
01:31 - the file name and then press enter
01:34 - and you can see the installation will
01:36 - start using the command line right
01:40 - so here first tab is to press enter to
01:43 - continue so I'm going to press enter key
01:46 - and then you have these license terms
01:49 - and conditions so press enter to go to
01:51 - the very end if you want to read these
01:54 - license terms and conditions you can
01:56 - read them and once you are at the end
01:59 - you can just type yes and then press
02:03 - enter
02:04 - now we are on the next step so this will
02:07 - be the default location where Anaconda
02:10 - will be installed which is in your home
02:12 - folder and it will create this folder
02:14 - called Anaconda 3. I agree with this so
02:17 - I can press enter key once again so
02:19 - press enter and once I press enter it's
02:22 - going to create this directory in my
02:24 - home folder and I will wait for the next
02:26 - step
02:28 - so you can see it's extracting all these
02:31 - files in this directory so just wait for
02:34 - this step to be completed so once the
02:37 - previous step is finished you can see
02:40 - some examples here and then it asks do
02:43 - you wish the installer to initialize
02:45 - Anaconda 3 we are going to type yes here
02:47 - and then press enter which is going to
02:50 - just initialize the Anaconda 3. so once
02:54 - that's done the Anaconda installation is
02:58 - finished so now you can start using
03:00 - anaconda on your Ubuntu operating system
03:03 - just one step you can do before exiting
03:07 - this terminal is you can run this
03:09 - command which is Source bash RC which is
03:12 - going to
03:13 - activate all your environment variables
03:16 - in the current terminal itself right so
03:19 - I'm going to just give this command if
03:21 - you don't wish to give this command you
03:24 - can close your terminal and open the
03:26 - terminal once again right so once that's
03:30 - done I'm going to clear my terminal and
03:34 - then
03:35 - the conda command is going to work
03:37 - because we have activated
03:39 - Anaconda 3 right so just write
03:43 - conda here
03:45 - and then just write a list and then
03:48 - press enter it's going to give you the
03:51 - list of packages which are available on
03:54 - condo you can see there are so many
03:56 - packages which you can
03:59 - use on Anaconda and for example if you
04:04 - want to search for the python version
04:07 - which is available to use with Anaconda
04:11 - you can give this command which is condo
04:14 - search and then in double quotes
04:16 - this symbol and then python dollar and
04:20 - then press enter
04:22 - and it's going to search for that
04:26 - and now you can see all the versions
04:28 - which are available uh to be used using
04:32 - uh conda right so these are the python
04:35 - versions which are available
04:37 - now once you installed
04:39 - Anaconda it also comes with a few nice
04:43 - packages like Jupiter notebook which you
04:47 - can use to develop your Python scripts
04:50 - so what I'm going to do is let me clear
04:52 - the terminal and then I will go to my
04:55 - home folder where I want to create this
04:57 - Jupiter notebook so I will just write MK
05:00 - there and then the name of the folder
05:03 - where I want to create my notebooks
05:05 - right
05:06 - so I can create J
05:11 - notebook folder and then I'm going to
05:15 - just CD into this folder and then here I
05:18 - can just write Jupiter notebook and then
05:21 - press enter which is going to start the
05:24 - jupyter notebook on my Ubuntu operating
05:26 - system and it's going to be opened in my
05:31 - default browser which is this one right
05:33 - so here I can create
05:37 - a new folder for example so you can see
05:40 - I can create a new file folder or
05:42 - terminal right
05:44 - so let's create a new file here and you
05:48 - can start using jupyter notebook from
05:50 - here or you can go to the home folder
05:53 - and create the terminal
05:57 - and you can start using jupyter Notebook
06:01 - on the terminal
06:03 - in your browser itself right so this is
06:07 - how you can use jupyter notebook using
06:11 - uh Anaconda let me just close this uh
06:15 - terminal and I want to show one more
06:18 - cool thing to you so let me close this
06:21 - terminal and let me open the new
06:24 - terminal
06:25 - and once this terminal is open there is
06:27 - this utility called Anaconda Navigator
06:30 - so let's open this Anaconda Navigator
06:35 - GUI so just write Anaconda navigator on
06:38 - the terminal and then press enter
06:40 - which is going to start this Anaconda
06:43 - Navigator
06:44 - so just wait for few seconds
06:47 - you can see this Anaconda Navigator is
06:49 - starting
06:51 - and now it's been started right so for
06:53 - the first time you can just click on yes
06:55 - here so for the first time when Anaconda
06:58 - Navigator starts you can see this kind
07:00 - of interface
07:02 - so from here you can launch few
07:04 - applications for example if you want to
07:06 - launch Jupiter notebook you can launch
07:08 - it from here
07:10 - so I can click on launch and it's going
07:12 - to open a new Anaconda notebook from
07:16 - this Navigator itself on your home
07:19 - browser right you can see this jupyter
07:23 - notebook has been launched so now you
07:26 - can go to the folder where you want to
07:27 - create your notebook and then start
07:30 - using the jupyter notebook using
07:33 - Anaconda also you have all these
07:36 - utilities here Jupiter lab is available
07:39 - there is this utility called spider
07:42 - which is a very good ide
07:44 - so I can just click on launch spider
07:48 - and it's going to launch this uh Spider
07:53 - IDE on my Ubuntu operating system if you
07:56 - want you can start the tour or if you
07:59 - know already how spider works you can
08:02 - just click on dismiss and start using
08:05 - your spider IDE using Anaconda itself
08:09 - right so really nice features so I can
08:13 - just type print here and then I can
08:19 - just print hello world and once I'm done
08:23 - I can even run this script using these
08:26 - options I have all these debug option
08:29 - and running options so I can click on
08:31 - run so first save your file and then run
08:35 - it and then
08:37 - click on run which is going to run your
08:40 - file and give you the output here okay
08:43 - so this is how you can download and
08:45 - install anaconda and use Anaconda
08:47 - navigator to
08:49 - use all these applications using
08:52 - Anaconda right
08:54 - so I hope you enjoyed this video and I
08:56 - will see you in the next video
