00:00 - now in this video we will be learning
00:02 - about the what are the variables okay so
00:04 - first of all let me tell you about the
00:06 - what are the topics which we will be
00:08 - covering in this particular video
00:09 - so let me just open up the terminal and
00:12 - I will write all those topics which will
00:14 - be covering this particular video so
00:16 - first of all we will cover variables
00:18 - what are the variables
00:21 - then use the defined variables and next
00:23 - environment variables
00:25 - okay so these are the topics which we'll
00:28 - be covering in this particular video so
00:30 - first of all let me start with the
00:32 - variables okay what are the variables
00:34 - okay but before that let me first open
00:36 - up my vs code actually I've already done
00:38 - it here
00:39 - you can see now you have to just create
00:43 - one file that is zero two variables dot
00:46 - sh okay so we will use dot sh extension
00:49 - for creation of file and I hope you have
00:52 - already installed this vs code actually
00:54 - in our previous video we have covered
00:55 - this part of installation so now what we
00:59 - have to do uh
01:01 - we have to just uh
01:03 - enter this shape band and then you have
01:07 - to just you are good to go you can write
01:10 - any command here also like you uh
01:13 - variables you can write here variables
01:18 - okay just to save it and here is the Run
01:22 - button if you run it maybe it will run
01:24 - yeah it's working fine
01:26 - okay so now what we can do
01:29 - uh let me tell you about first variables
01:32 - what are the variables okay so variables
01:34 - is nothing but uh just like a container
01:37 - okay
01:39 - container which will hold some values
01:43 - okay so variable is nothing but just
01:46 - like a container which will hold some
01:48 - kind of value it may be integer it may
01:50 - be a string it can be your uh any kind
01:53 - of value like your decimal value or
01:55 - character value okay so these are the
01:58 - variables okay so what happens actually
02:00 - uh like internally what are those what
02:03 - things happen okay if you are coming
02:05 - from the C plus plus background so you
02:08 - might be aware of those things like let
02:09 - me tell you all this uh I will open up
02:12 - the paint
02:15 - so that will be easy to understand for
02:18 - you
02:20 - okay so I will just create a block here
02:23 - okay so what happens if you create a
02:27 - variable suppose you create a variable a
02:29 - equal to 10 okay so at that time what
02:32 - will happen a block will be created in a
02:36 - memory and some address will be given to
02:39 - that okay now you will tell ask me what
02:43 - are the address values nothing but uh
02:45 - which is used to access those variables
02:48 - okay if you are aware of C plus plus or
02:51 - python then you might be aware of it but
02:53 - right now just keep in mind that
02:55 - variables are stored at one particular
02:58 - address so it can be any address I will
03:00 - just
03:01 - enter like it it uh what we can say
03:06 - address is in the form of hexadecimal so
03:10 - you can write anything like hexadecimal
03:12 - is like a to f 1 to 9 anything you can
03:15 - like this okay
03:19 - so you can think like this is the
03:20 - address and this will be the value you
03:24 - can suppose like it will be 10 and the
03:27 - name of the variable will be a
03:30 - okay so this is the case happens
03:34 - internally if you create a variable in
03:37 - any operating system okay so now we will
03:41 - start with the basic one like we will
03:43 - create some variables and we will also
03:45 - learn about some kind of rules which we
03:47 - follows while creating the variables in
03:51 - our
03:52 - shell okay or bash scripting you can say
03:56 - so here what we will do uh I will just
03:59 - uh create some variables I can create
04:02 - name equal to I
04:06 - okay you can write like this
04:10 - and then what you will need to do you
04:13 - can also give like H equal to 20 you can
04:18 - say
04:19 - and now we are good to go right now we
04:22 - will just print those variables so how
04:25 - you can print using dollar
04:27 - and the name of the variable you can
04:29 - easily print the variables okay
04:32 - so just save these variables and I will
04:35 - run up run this variable okay
04:38 - so here you can see the variable the
04:40 - first line and the second my name is
04:43 - printed okay so but before moving
04:47 - forward let me tell you about some of
04:49 - the rules which we follow while creating
04:51 - a variables okay so there are some
04:53 - interesting thing if you do like this
04:55 - add a space so at that time your cell
04:57 - thinks like it's kind of for command so
04:59 - there should be no any spaces in your
05:02 - variable name
05:03 - in cell scripting spatially or bash
05:06 - scripting so if you will do so it will
05:09 - say
05:10 - command not form here you can see so you
05:14 - don't have to give any kind of space in
05:17 - your variable name
05:19 - okay I hope it's clear to you guys let
05:22 - me just create some another variable
05:25 - like pointer I will create some kind of
05:27 - 9.9 I will give it a time okay it's fine
05:30 - so here I will
05:33 - add equal
05:36 - my pointer is
05:40 - like this
05:42 - maybe a string Point coordination will
05:45 - happen there
05:46 - pointer
05:48 - let me just to save and I will again run
05:51 - this
05:51 - script
05:53 - so here you can see my pointer is this
05:57 - plus okay
05:58 - if I will not give it it doesn't affect
06:01 - I think
06:06 - okay so here you can see my pointer is
06:08 - 9.89
06:10 - so in this way you can uh enter the
06:13 - variables and enter the values assign
06:16 - the value to the variables so these are
06:18 - basically the user defined variables
06:21 - okay
06:23 - Echo you have to just here to user
06:27 - defined
06:29 - variables okay
06:32 - so this is the okay
06:37 - so what if I want to uh print all those
06:41 - in a same line
06:43 - like equal name
06:45 - and equal it is also I want okay let's
06:49 - do it I will remove this line
06:52 - save it
06:55 - okay
06:56 - here you can see the ayush 20 okay so
07:00 - these are the user defined variables
07:02 - okay I hope it is clear to you what are
07:04 - the variables now moving forward
07:06 - uh we will learn about the sum of
07:09 - what we can say involvement variables
07:12 - okay
07:13 - so I will just do a quick Google search
07:15 - for you guys
07:16 - and I will search for the user not user
07:20 - environment variables okay
07:23 - so involvement
07:27 - will write that much being smiling
07:29 - environment variables
07:31 - shells cutting in JavaScript yeah
07:35 - here we got it
07:40 - okay so here you can see uh there are
07:43 - many blocks for on EX for gigs or
07:46 - digitalocean
07:48 - okay so let me open this one Geeks for
07:51 - gigs so it's uh
07:53 - good
07:55 - website to learn more things okay
07:59 - so here you can see
08:02 - it's loading just wait for some time
08:07 - okay so here you can see what are the
08:09 - environment values so environment is
08:11 - very
08:12 - system defined variables you can see it
08:14 - is given by the shell to use for you
08:17 - guys
08:18 - okay so here you can see the scope of an
08:21 - environment variable and all those
08:23 - things I will tell you about this scope
08:25 - and always in the next video okay right
08:28 - now just learn about the
08:31 - environment variables okay
08:33 - so here you can see the name is one of
08:35 - the environmental variables both over
08:37 - here and Google
08:38 - in the same way okay
08:43 - let me just this
08:47 - so here you can see
08:52 - okay name equal to value
08:58 - okay I will use some different flip side
09:00 - let me use this solution
09:02 - not this one
09:04 - this one looks good
09:07 - or I will just do list here because I
09:10 - want the list of the environment
09:11 - variables
09:13 - and cell script we use so here you can
09:16 - see the
09:18 - uh not Windows I want Linux
09:24 - foreign variables
09:31 - okay
09:36 - so uh let me just use some variables
09:39 - here like uh I remember some value books
09:42 - like Eco shell
09:45 - if you will use shell with I need one
09:47 - variables keep in mind like it is
09:49 - written always in the capital letter and
09:53 - here I will just add some text like
09:56 - first environment variable
10:01 - okay
10:02 - and just
10:06 - save it and run it and here you will see
10:09 - the bin bash it gives you the name of a
10:12 - like cell which cell you are using right
10:15 - now
10:15 - okay if you will do date also it will
10:18 - give you the information about date okay
10:21 - so just save it and run it from here
10:26 - and here you can see the okay it's not
10:30 - displaying with a date why I don't know
10:33 - okay
10:36 - okay
10:37 - it should
10:51 - okay just run this
10:55 - okay I think date is not one involvement
10:57 - variable let me just pick the search for
11:00 - it date environment variable
11:03 - minutes
11:05 - okay
11:07 - so here you can see the uh
11:10 - current environment variables
11:15 - so there are many articles so you can
11:17 - read here like when you do
11:23 - we can do like this also
11:27 - uh let me just copy and I will paste it
11:29 - here
11:30 - now and I will use here now
11:35 - okay just save it
11:38 - and click
11:40 - on run and here you can see the current
11:42 - date and time all those things
11:44 - okay
11:46 - so in this way you can use uh variables
11:49 - you can assign values and I hope you got
11:52 - to learn about this user defined
11:54 - variables as well as environment
11:56 - variables and in the next video also I
11:59 - will tell you some more environment
12:00 - variables okay so I hope you like this
12:03 - particular video guys and thank you
12:04 - thank you for watching and if you have
12:06 - any queries then you can ask in the
12:08 - comment section and for these all the
12:10 - source code I will be posting on my
12:12 - GitHub repository I will give the link
12:14 - in the description okay so thank you
12:17 - thank you for watching I'll meet you in
12:18 - the next one thank you and bye bye
