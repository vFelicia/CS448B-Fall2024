00:01 - [Music]
00:12 - in this section we are going to create a
00:14 - blog um the blog is mostly uh created
00:18 - just have one page left and I am going
00:21 - to live code that page so what we're
00:23 - going to do in this section is we're
00:24 - going to walk through the code I'll show
00:26 - you some tricks that I used to create uh
00:29 - the block and then we are going to live
00:32 - code the contact me page because that
00:35 - page does not exist yet on that blog and
00:38 - this is the blog that uh we are going to
00:41 - work on so it is made on
00:44 - bootstrap and uh believe it or not this
00:48 - web page um took me like 120 custom CSS
00:53 - lines to create so mainly just boot up
00:56 - with some um small amount of custom CSS
01:00 - and we have a fully function block
01:03 - basically what I got here is just quotes
01:06 - from Albert Einstein and if we click on
01:09 - this link we'll get to uh the page with
01:14 - um like a block single post and um by
01:18 - the way this is the Red Riding Hood
01:20 - story or part of it and then we have
01:23 - about
01:24 - page which has some short um extract
01:28 - from the um Albert Einstein biography
01:31 - and then the homepage so we need a
01:34 - contact page and we're going to add that
01:36 - page in and the this is a very modern
01:39 - slick looking very clean uh blog made on
01:42 - boot shop and uses very small amount of
01:46 - custom CSS so in our next video we are
01:48 - going to walk through the code I'm going
01:50 - to show you how I did it what um options
01:53 - I've used what boost shop components I
01:55 - have used over here and hopefully you're
01:58 - going to learn a lot from from this
02:06 - project so in this video we are going to
02:09 - talk about the way I have done this
02:11 - website and the first off I think the
02:13 - most important aspect of creating a web
02:17 - page is um how you are structuring your
02:21 - SS um and I'll just want to take a brief
02:24 - moment and talk about um my partials and
02:28 - basically I have a global partial from
02:31 - the previous sections and then I have a
02:34 - header with some bootstop override and
02:38 - then I have a Blog
02:41 - archive a very small component for the
02:44 - blog archive blog archive is uh this
02:47 - part over
02:49 - here
02:50 - and uh after blog archive I have the
02:53 - page is for the blog uh single post and
02:57 - then I have the footer uh so not not a
03:00 - lot of code as you see and uh we get a
03:02 - pretty nice looking website from that
03:05 - and for the HTML markup I will go ahead
03:08 - and look at index. HTML and the first
03:11 - off I have a header uh and then I have a
03:15 - container a regular container inside of
03:17 - that I have a now bar I have removed
03:19 - some of this now bar parts that came
03:22 - with um boot shop component and uh if we
03:27 - scroll down I have this um
03:30 - a header title title and inside of the
03:32 - column md8 and I have this modifier
03:36 - added to that uh to the row class
03:39 - justify content Center which means the
03:42 - following column will be in a center so
03:45 - before bootstop 4 you were uh supposed
03:48 - to do like column md2 then column md8
03:53 - and in that way the column md8 would be
03:55 - in a center uh with B 4 with flex box
03:59 - you you don't have to do that you just
04:00 - put whatever column you want and it will
04:02 - be in a center uh actually you can do
04:06 - like column mg 11 and that will be in a
04:10 - center so they on this side will be a
04:12 - half a column and on this side will be a
04:14 - half a column but we are not going to do
04:17 - that and the same goes for the blog
04:20 - archive so I use justify content Center
04:22 - to Center my column
04:24 - md8 uh on in the center of the container
04:28 - and uh you can you can see I use um B
04:31 - name convention over here and also over
04:34 - here I have a a tag that will um cover
04:40 - this uh title in the paragraph So if we
04:43 - look over here both of them are
04:45 - hoverable with one link then I have some
04:47 - meta uh meta information down below uh
04:52 - posted by and a link to Albert Einstein
04:56 - posts and the date and that's it for the
04:59 - blog archive item and it just goes on
05:02 - repeating couple of those and then we
05:05 - have a footer and the footer is um
05:08 - practically the same from the previous
05:10 - section and uh this is it for the index
05:14 - page and if we go into a header at scss
05:19 - I have a image for the header and then I
05:21 - I'm using after pseudo element to have
05:25 - like an overlay that will be um this
05:28 - shade of black and that will be overlay
05:31 - uh overlay the header um and also I'm
05:34 - using Z index one and everything that is
05:39 - inside of the header I am bringing it up
05:42 - to Z index 2 Z index 3 because Z index
05:46 - one is the image then I have Z index 2
05:48 - for the overlay for this background and
05:52 - whatever sits on top of this overlay is
05:54 - the index 3 so I have nowar brand and
05:57 - now bar uh nowar now so the navigation
06:00 - the links and then the header title also
06:04 - has the Z index 3 and also I have this
06:09 - uh Blog Page modifier and I will show
06:11 - you how that works so if we head over
06:16 - to um this
06:21 - page uh simple
06:23 - post and we can see that I have a very
06:26 - similar design of the header but uh all
06:29 - of my text is to the left and I have
06:32 - this uh stuff this meta data information
06:36 - uh for the blog post and if we go and
06:40 - look at the header I have that stuff um
06:44 - the styles for those for that meta
06:46 - information over here and I also have
06:50 - this block page modifier so if we go to
06:54 - um blog. HTML scroll down
06:57 - to um the head
07:00 - so we have header title header title
07:02 - block page and this is the modifier and
07:05 - basically it takes the header title and
07:08 - aligns the text to the left and this is
07:11 - how I have added wait a minute where's
07:14 - there it is this how I have added
07:17 - the uh modifier just as another sort of
07:21 - child to the header title so I'm
07:24 - grabbing this header title uh and adding
07:27 - it to to here and then
07:30 - um-- Blog Page and that is my modifier
07:33 - so this is a very good example how to do
07:36 - uh modifiers with BS uh with BM and you
07:39 - don't have to like create a uh separate
07:42 - class you can do all inside of this um
07:44 - SAS component and if we go back to
07:50 - index. HTML not index but block.
07:54 - HTML and um I have some um paragraphs
08:00 - over here it's a red writing Hood um
08:03 - story or a part of it and I have it a
08:07 - bit differently from the
08:10 - index.html so the styles are pretty
08:13 - similar to this part over here but if we
08:16 - go
08:18 - to um blog archive that uh CSS uh we
08:23 - have this um options for H2 and a
08:27 - paragraph but if we open
08:31 - page that scss I have a couple more
08:33 - options and this is uh just to show you
08:38 - um how to do a fluid typography so if I
08:42 - will go ahead and duplicate this website
08:44 - and go to
08:48 - 3001 uh go to remote debuggin overlay
08:51 - CSS create and need to Overlay with Main
08:56 - and since my font size is 20 pixels
09:00 - so I will do a uh 20 pixel grid size so
09:04 - this is all set up and we are now doing
09:07 - no offset and for um vertical axis we
09:11 - are going to remove that we don't need
09:14 - the grid just uh lines and if we head
09:17 - back over to the Local Host we can see
09:20 - that every uh line of text sits on a
09:25 - fluid uh line so this is very easy to
09:27 - read very com comfortable to the user
09:30 - eyes so uh that is the main reason
09:33 - behind more of these options over here
09:36 - uh so uh this is it for this video um
09:41 - basically it's pretty easy not a lot of
09:44 - Uh custom CSS mainly just uh some uh CSS
09:49 - on this page
09:51 - and on the homepage and to create this
09:55 - um widgets for blog archive item and in
09:59 - our next next video we are going to
10:01 - create one more link over here for
10:03 - contact me and we are going to have some
10:05 - text paragraph and a
10:11 - form so before we go ahead and create
10:14 - that last page for this blog one thing I
10:18 - forgot uh to mention I think I forgot to
10:20 - mention U because I think this uh could
10:23 - be very useful is how to center this
10:25 - text in the header and if we head over
10:28 - to
10:30 - header the CSS I have header title as
10:33 - position relative because I need to use
10:35 - Z indexed and then I have this pattern
10:38 - so top is 200 pixels minus 68 pixels and
10:43 - bottom is 200 pixels and the reason why
10:46 - I'm using this uh
10:48 - subtraction of I'm subtracting 68 pixels
10:51 - from 200 is because if we going to go
10:54 - ahead and
10:57 - inspect uh our document
11:00 - head over to the now bar you can see
11:03 - that the now bar is uh
11:07 - 1,110 pixels by 68 pixels so what I'm
11:11 - doing is I'm making sure that my uh
11:15 - header title stays in the center of the
11:17 - image uh excluding this um nowbar so it
11:23 - sort of ignores the naber height and
11:25 - centers it in in the center of the image
11:28 - and if we head over to
11:29 - the uh sample um sample post it's still
11:34 - in the center of the image and the
11:36 - pattern stays the same and that's why
11:38 - the header kind of uh grows uh with the
11:41 - height of the header kind of grows um
11:44 - because of my 200 pixels so this is a
11:46 - very easy way to center a text in the
11:50 - center of uh the section just by adding
11:54 - the pattern on top and the bottom so
11:57 - having said that let's go ahead and get
11:59 - started with our new page so the first
12:02 - thing first we need a new file and we
12:06 - are going to call that
12:11 - file
12:13 - contact Das
12:15 - me
12:17 - HTML and I will go ahead and grab the
12:21 - about page and I'm just going to select
12:25 - all copy and paste paste it inside of
12:31 - here oops something did not work right
12:36 - copy and paste there we go and now this
12:41 - is going to be a contact me so instead
12:46 - of this about will
12:49 - be contact
12:52 - me uh maybe I can help
13:01 - maybe I can help Okay so for the uh H1
13:09 - over here actually we are going to get
13:12 - rid of this for the blog single exrt we
13:15 - are going to remove
13:18 - that and we are going to create a new
13:22 - div and call it
13:25 - contact and inside of that we are going
13:28 - to create create an
13:31 - H2
13:33 - uh contact
13:35 - form and we are going to assign a class
13:39 - so it's going to be
13:41 - contact uh underscore double underscore
13:45 - and
13:47 - H2 and now we need a form actually this
13:52 - supposed to be a class
13:59 - just like that so uh now we need the
14:02 - form and I will go ahead and grab that
14:04 - from the bootstrap page uh bootstrap
14:07 - documentation so if we head over to
14:09 - components form on get boot shop.com and
14:12 - I'll just go ahead and grab this one uh
14:14 - the first one and I will copy that code
14:18 - and come back over here and paste in
14:22 - that code
14:24 - beautify editor content and I will
14:27 - remove this um
14:30 - labels and the small text and label and
14:34 - a small text and this third one label
14:37 - and a small text so I have this form
14:39 - groups and for which I need I will have
14:43 - a name email and a message so I need um
14:49 - a name so this looks like it's going to
14:52 - work for
14:53 - me um for email actually so I'm going to
14:57 - paste this inside of here
15:00 - um email address and looks like
15:03 - everything is all right with this
15:07 - one and I will go ahead
15:09 - and paste it inside of here too and this
15:13 - one is going to
15:14 - be
15:17 - um this one's going to be for the name
15:20 - so instead of email address uh we'll say
15:24 - name and type is going to be text form
15:28 - control ID is going to be
15:34 - um
15:36 - contact form name and same thing for the
15:41 - email
15:42 - address going to be
15:44 - contact form
15:48 - email and if we scroll for uh further we
15:53 - have at the placeholder so we are going
15:57 - to uh just have name over
16:01 - here and over
16:04 - here is going to be name
16:11 - help and that's going to be email help
16:13 - so uh that is done and now we need just
16:17 - a text area so let's go ahead and grab
16:21 - this example text area over here
16:26 - so I think this is what we're looking
16:28 - for for so let's go ahead and copy this
16:33 - part of
16:35 - documentation and head over to the text
16:38 - editor and paste that in and instead of
16:43 - this example form control text area we
16:47 - are going to
16:49 - do like that double
16:57 - cursor there you go
16:59 - uh we are going
17:02 - to uh call it contact
17:08 - form text
17:13 - area and just have message over
17:19 - here
17:22 - and that should be fine beautify editor
17:26 - content hit save and now we need to open
17:29 - this page so what I'm going to do is I'm
17:31 - going to duplicate this blog and instead
17:34 - of this blog. HTML have contact me.
17:39 - HTML um this says cannot get contact me
17:44 - at HTML and let's see what is going on
17:48 - so it looks like my contact me that HTML
17:51 - is sort of a partial so that's not where
17:54 - supposed to be a Sly mistake happens to
17:56 - everyone so let's move to the rout and
18:01 - now our web page should uh work properly
18:05 - so uh here we got uh our contact form
18:09 - looks pretty horrible and uh let's go
18:12 - ahead and fix it uh so the first thing
18:15 - is we need to figure out why this um
18:17 - message is um not in line and let's take
18:22 - a look at our code and we have this form
18:26 - check that we need to get rid of and
18:29 - that should solve the
18:33 - problem so that uh that's working and
18:36 - now let's uh uh let's give it some
18:39 - styles for the contact form so let's uh
18:43 - head over to our partials and now inside
18:46 - of the partials we are going to create a
18:48 - new file and call it uh contact that is
18:53 - CSS and inside of that file we are going
18:56 - to put the style for the contact page so
19:01 - uh to contact
19:02 - me uh we need to grab the this
19:07 - class and add it in
19:11 - and uh first off I'm going to add some
19:14 - margins so uh top and bottom 50
19:22 - pixels uh so that this will add the 50
19:26 - pixels on top and the bottom
19:30 - and the reason why we are not seeing any
19:32 - changes is because we need to add this
19:34 - contact. scss to our index. SSS so we
19:40 - are going to run import statement for
19:43 - contact and now we have those changes so
19:48 - the form looks uh kind of okay but we
19:51 - can do more styles on it and first off I
19:55 - want to Target this uh title and uh give
19:58 - it some other settings
20:01 - so we are going to go back to contact.
20:05 - SSS and I'm going to use a parent
20:08 - keyword and go for H2 and give it font
20:15 - uh weight of
20:18 - 900 so this should give it give it some
20:21 - font weight and now I am going to remove
20:25 - this um border radius so first off I
20:29 - need to find out which class exactly
20:32 - gives this um border radius and it looks
20:36 - like uh form control so inside of the
20:42 - contact I am going to look for a form
20:48 - control and I'm going to set border
20:51 - radius to zero and it should
20:54 - successfully
20:55 - override uh the Border radius so the
20:58 - Border radius looks different and same
21:00 - thing I'm going to do with the button
21:02 - because I don't like the uh rounded
21:04 - button and I'm going to apply this
21:07 - only to the form button so uh
21:13 - let's do the same thing for the
21:16 - BTN and Border radius to
21:23 - zero and that's it for the form it's
21:27 - pretty simple um not a lot of uh stuff
21:31 - not a lot of text not a lot of styles
21:33 - but nonetheless we have a form and one
21:35 - last thing that we need to do is um
21:39 - actually two two last things I want to
21:41 - change the color and add the uh contact
21:44 - me to the navigation so uh for the H2 I
21:50 - am going to go with the color pound
21:54 - 333 and uh let's go to index
21:59 - and uh to the navigation and we are
22:03 - going to copy this and paste it in and
22:06 - instead of block that HTML going to be
22:09 - contact me. HTML and we are going to
22:13 - have
22:15 - contct me so now what we are going to do
22:18 - is we're going to copy this
22:22 - ul
22:24 - and uh we have to add it to every single
22:29 - page
22:32 - so this gets the new new
22:36 - navigation as well as the
22:41 - blog and as well as contact
22:45 - me gets the new navigation and index
22:50 - should have the new
22:52 - navigation uh so we save all of our
22:55 - pages and now we have contact me over
22:58 - here go to simple post we have contact
23:00 - me about and
23:03 - home so this is a complete version of
23:08 - very simple blog that you can uh build
23:10 - with boot shop as you can see it's very
23:13 - simple not a lot of CSS maybe like 160
23:16 - lines of custom CSS and you have a very
23:19 - clean very modern um block of with
23:23 - bootstrap
