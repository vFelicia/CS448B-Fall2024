00:01 - hello guys welcome once again in the
00:02 - last video I have shown you how to use
00:05 - IFL statement in C++ in this video I'm
00:08 - going to talk about second type of
00:12 - conditional statement which is switch
00:14 - statement so let's see how we can use
00:16 - switch statement in
00:18 - C++ so I'm going to take an example
00:21 - first of all I will
00:23 - declare a variable called character and
00:27 - I name it as grade
00:30 - and then I will
00:33 - output a question to the
00:37 - user that
00:41 - please enter
00:43 - the
00:46 - grade and I
00:49 - will close this and end the
00:55 - line okay now we will wait for the user
01:00 - to input the grade so I will say c
01:04 - n insertion
01:06 - operator
01:08 - grade now on the basis of uh user
01:13 - defined grade or whatever user enters as
01:16 - a grade I want to show some message so
01:20 - let's see how I can do this with switch
01:23 - statement so what is the Declaration of
01:25 - the switch statement so you need to
01:28 - write
01:31 - switch and then these parenthesis and
01:34 - then you need to give these curly braces
01:38 - and in here inside this curly braces we
01:41 - are going to Define some cases okay but
01:44 - first of all in this curly bracket we
01:47 - provide the condition okay so our
01:50 - condition is this grade on the basis of
01:53 - this grade we are going to decide the
01:56 - message we want to show right so in here
02:00 - we write cases so just write case and
02:05 - because uh we are evaluating the
02:09 - character grade which is a character and
02:12 - character we can write it
02:16 - as like this right so if user enters
02:21 - character a then just
02:24 - give
02:26 - this colon this is not a semic but a Col
02:30 - right so remember this and then you can
02:34 - output your
02:37 - message see
02:41 - out and we can
02:48 - say excellent
02:51 - okay and end the
02:54 - line and in the same way on the basis of
02:58 - grade entered
03:00 - you can Define different cases
03:03 - but there is a optional break point in
03:07 - switch cases which you can declare it
03:10 - like
03:11 - this
03:13 - break so what this does is I will
03:15 - explain you in a moment but I will copy
03:19 - this and paste it two or three three
03:23 - times uh for different conditions so if
03:26 - the grade is B grade entered this V you
03:30 - can
03:35 - say
03:38 - very good and if the G grade entered is
03:43 - C you can show the message
03:48 - that
03:50 - you passed okay and there is
03:54 - a one more important condition in switch
03:58 - cases that doesn't fulfill uh the
04:02 - provided conditions so what happens if
04:05 - the user doesn't provide a b or c what
04:08 - happens in the case user provides some
04:11 - uh
04:13 - random character so what will happen
04:17 - then so you can just deal with that
04:19 - random character
04:22 - by
04:24 - default
04:26 - and what is a default in uh any case
04:30 - other than the case listed above you are
04:33 - going to show the
04:35 - message see
04:44 - out
04:46 - invalid entry okay so the user knows
04:52 - that he has entered a wrong entry right
04:57 - and I will just close it and and break
05:01 - I'll provide break
05:05 - here okay so now I will explain what's
05:09 - happening here so what's happening here
05:14 - is this is a switch statement so this a
05:18 - typo I made it here so switch statement
05:22 - decide on the basis of grade on the
05:26 - condition you enter or or user enters so
05:29 - it sees uh whether user has entered a b
05:34 - or c and on the basis of the provided
05:37 - condition it decide what message he want
05:41 - to print okay so let's build the program
05:46 - and run the
05:48 - program program is
05:52 - building and now let's run the program
05:55 - and for
05:57 - example I enter the gray
06:00 - a so I should ideally see this message
06:02 - excellent let's see if I get it or not I
06:05 - enter a as a grade and press enter and
06:09 - programs shows me excellent once again I
06:13 - enter the
06:15 - Grade B and press enter it says very
06:20 - good and once again if I enter some
06:24 - random random character for example D
06:29 - and press enter it says me invalid entry
06:32 - because it's not
06:34 - fulfilling these listed condition in
06:37 - case
06:39 - right now there is a unique property in
06:42 - switch cases
06:44 - that this break is optional right so for
06:49 - example I give a new case here
06:58 - case
07:00 - small
07:02 - a here okay so in the case of if the
07:07 - user enters small a I'm not providing
07:11 - any condition or any break here right so
07:16 - now what happens in this condition if I
07:18 - don't provide any break after my case
07:23 - what happens
07:24 - is it goes to this condition if user
07:27 - enters small a and and then it sees that
07:31 - if the break is there and if he finds
07:34 - the break it breaks the switch
07:36 - conditions and go out of this switch
07:39 - otherwise if the break is not found in
07:43 - this case or in this condition it goes
07:46 - to the next case
07:49 - and performs
07:52 - the conditions here Contrition here so
07:55 - which is excellent and then he sees yes
07:59 - now I find break so it goes out of this
08:03 - condition here
08:05 - so when you enter or when the user
08:08 - enters the small a
08:12 - this code will be executed which is the
08:15 - next immediate next case of the switch
08:19 - statement so let me explain or Let Me
08:23 - Show You by this example I will build
08:25 - the example
08:26 - and run the program and and for example
08:30 - I enter small a small a and I will press
08:34 - enter and you see the message comes here
08:37 - is excellent and you can ask why this
08:42 - condition is uh
08:44 - executed other than this small a
08:48 - condition because you haven't provided
08:50 - the break here so if you don't provide
08:53 - break after your condition or after the
08:56 - case it'll go and execute the
09:00 - next code or next condition okay and
09:04 - when it sees that yeah I get the break
09:08 - then it goes out of the condition so
09:11 - always remember that
09:14 - what do you want to do you want to give
09:17 - the break or you want to execute the
09:21 - next condition also okay so this is the
09:26 - thing to remember in case and always
09:30 - remember that you catch any exception
09:34 - other than cases by default okay so
09:39 - these are the two things to remember in
09:41 - switch cases I hope you have understood
09:43 - the concept of case and I hope you have
09:46 - enjoyed this video please RIT comment
09:47 - and subscribe and bye for now
