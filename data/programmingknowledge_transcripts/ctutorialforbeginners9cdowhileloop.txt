00:00 - hello guys welcome once again in the
00:02 - last video I have shown you how to use
00:04 - while loop in C now in this video I'm
00:07 - going to show you how to use do while
00:10 - loop in
00:12 - C so first of all what is a difference
00:16 - between while loop and do while loop the
00:21 - basic difference between while loop and
00:23 - do while loop is a y Loop first checks
00:28 - the condition and then performs the code
00:32 - but the do while loop first performs the
00:36 - code and then checks the condition so
00:40 - let me give you an example I'm going to
00:44 - just use the example I have used last
00:47 - time to print 10 values and Ive also
00:50 - shown you how to print 10 values using
00:52 - this V Loop right
00:56 - so while this count was less than
01:00 - whatever we entered as a number for
01:02 - example 10 it will been printing the
01:04 - values right and for example I will just
01:09 - increase this count to 10 so now I I
01:13 - have initialized this count variable
01:15 - with 10 then what happens is I will run
01:20 - the
01:21 - code and for example I enter the number
01:24 - nine and press enter and you see nothing
01:28 - happens because our condition is not
01:31 - true 10 is not not less than n which we
01:35 - have entered so our code is not executed
01:40 - right now let me
01:45 - just rewrite this code using do while
01:49 - loop okay so let's see a do while
01:54 - declaration is like this you first write
01:58 - do and then then you give this two curly
02:02 - braces and
02:04 - then what you do here is you
02:08 - write while and your condition and this
02:14 - semicolon okay this is the basic
02:16 - structure of two while loop and I will
02:19 - just give the same condition here in the
02:23 - while loop so I have the condition count
02:25 - is less than this number and I have the
02:28 - same statement which I was performing
02:31 - last time and once again let's see what
02:34 - happens now to differentiate this print
02:40 - message I will write
02:43 - here while and I will write here do
02:49 - while so we don't we will know that
02:52 - which message is printed this one or
02:55 - this one now let's run the program once
02:58 - again once again we will give the value
03:01 - nine which will be less than 10 so I
03:05 - will give nine and press enter and you
03:09 - see here the message printed do while
03:12 - number 10 right so this message is
03:17 - printed this one do while message and
03:21 - while message is not printed so this
03:25 - means that while loop first of all
03:28 - checks the condition
03:30 - and then execute your code and do while
03:33 - loop first execute your code so it will
03:37 - just because there is no condition in
03:40 - initially right it says do so you do
03:43 - this and then it sees okay this is the
03:47 - condition if this condition is true I'm
03:50 - going to go to do once again and print
03:55 - this now let's give the value valid
04:00 - conditions for both of them okay so I
04:04 - will just run the code and I will give
04:08 - 10 and I will enter this once
04:13 - again and it says
04:16 - while 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 it says do
04:22 - while is equal to 10 okay
04:26 - so you see why this is happening
04:32 - because all the because this is this
04:35 - variable and this variable is same right
04:38 - so this has already increased to 10 and
04:42 - at the time of reaching this code this
04:45 - value is already 10 right so this code
04:49 - will be performed and it sees that 10
04:53 - is not less than 10 it's equal to 10
04:57 - right so it will not repeat it once
04:59 - again but when you declare uh another
05:04 - variable you can call it count one and
05:07 - just copy it and paste it with this do
05:13 - while loop what it will do is I will
05:18 - just run the code once again and I will
05:22 - press and 10 and press enter and you can
05:26 - see it has printed in the while loop
05:30 - also while 0 to 9 and in the do while
05:33 - loop also 0 to 9 same values right but
05:38 - the basic difference is do while
05:41 - loop performs the code first or perform
05:44 - the statement first and then the checks
05:47 - the condition and if the condition is
05:48 - true it goes to the statement once again
05:51 - and if the condition is true it goes to
05:53 - the statement once again and on the
05:57 - other hand the while loop checks the
05:59 - condition first and then performs your
06:02 - statement so I hope you have understood
06:05 - the basic difference between do and do
06:07 - while
06:08 - loop not do and do while loop but while
06:11 - and do while loop and I hope you have
