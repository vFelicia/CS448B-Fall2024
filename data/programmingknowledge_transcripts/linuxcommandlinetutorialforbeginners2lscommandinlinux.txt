00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Linux command line tutorial for
00:04 - beginners and in this video we will
00:06 - learn about LS command LS is a Linux
00:11 - shell command that lists directory
00:14 - contents of files and
00:16 - directories now first of all let's open
00:19 - our terminal I have uh told you in the
00:22 - last video If you press control alt T
00:26 - then it's going to open your terminal so
00:28 - just press control alt T to open the
00:31 - terminal now for the ls command you need
00:34 - to know some syntax so we all know that
00:38 - LS command can be given by just writing
00:42 - LS on the terminal but it has some
00:44 - options so these options will come in as
00:48 - a second argument so we can say here
00:52 - comes the options right and then comes
00:56 - the file or directory name so you can
00:59 - say here here comes the file uh or
01:03 - directory name so you can write FD okay
01:07 - so LS command comes with options first
01:11 - and then files and directory now I will
01:14 - show you what I mean by that so first of
01:18 - all simple LS command will uh you know
01:22 - work like this only which list the
01:25 - content of uh directory so we are uh you
01:30 - know whenever we open the terminal we
01:32 - are in the home directory right so we
01:35 - can just say LS and it will show us the
01:38 - contents of our home directory which is
01:42 - uh the desktop or um other document
01:45 - directory or you know downloads or other
01:48 - directories the same when you open this
01:51 - folder when you click here it will also
01:54 - open the home directory and you will be
01:56 - able to see all the contents uh of the
01:59 - directories here so these all the you
02:02 - know contents are here also so whatever
02:05 - you see here will be listed here also
02:09 - okay now the second uh option of using
02:14 - Lis command is by using a directory uh
02:19 - name for example we want to see the
02:21 - contents of uh this document directory
02:25 - right so our document directory contains
02:29 - these two files so how we can list uh
02:32 - the content of this document directory
02:34 - you can just write LS and then just
02:37 - write uh documents and then press enter
02:42 - and it will list all the files which are
02:44 - there in the documents directory right
02:47 - in the same way if you want to list out
02:49 - all the contents in the downloads folder
02:52 - then I will just say LS downloads okay
02:56 - and press enter it will show us the
02:59 - contents of the downloads folder right
03:02 - so simple now if you want to list out
03:06 - all the contents of our root folder as I
03:08 - have shown you in the last video you
03:10 - just need to give LS and then forward
03:13 - slash which is our root directory right
03:16 - and press enter it will show us the
03:19 - content of our uh root directory and in
03:22 - here you can verify this by going to
03:24 - this uh computer option and you can
03:27 - match all the directories here and here
03:30 - right now uh by default as I already uh
03:34 - told you we whenever we open the
03:37 - terminal we are in the home uh you know
03:40 - directory right now home directory uh
03:44 - you can just uh give PWD command and it
03:47 - will give you what is your home
03:50 - directory and this is your home
03:53 - directory right right so you are
03:55 - presently in your home directory now in
03:58 - uh uh other the terms when you uh you
04:02 - know want to uh list out the content of
04:05 - home directory you can just say LS and
04:08 - then give this uh till day symbol which
04:11 - will also give you the same content as
04:14 - Lis will give you so let's print out Lis
04:17 - first but uh let me clear all the
04:20 - commands which I have given earlier so
04:24 - to clear the terminal you just need to
04:26 - write clear here so just write clear and
04:29 - press enter and it will clear your
04:31 - terminal and clear means your terminal
04:34 - will be you know blank but when you
04:37 - scroll up all the you know all the
04:40 - commands are there so clear means it
04:42 - will just scroll down a little and it'll
04:45 - blank out your terminal for you so let's
04:49 - list out again so LS so it gives me the
04:52 - content of my home directory and when
04:55 - whenever you give LS and the till the
04:58 - symbol this still day also means the
05:01 - home directory so whenever you press
05:03 - enter it'll give you the same content
05:06 - and whenever you do uh LS and you can uh
05:11 - type the path Pro uh you know by
05:14 - yourself so home programming knowledge
05:17 - which is my home directory once again
05:19 - and when I press enter it will give me
05:21 - the same uh directory structure right so
05:25 - there are three command to list out uh
05:28 - the same thing one is LS which will give
05:31 - you uh all the contents of your home
05:34 - directory when you open your terminal
05:37 - right and then LS till day which will be
05:40 - uh also giving you the same content so
05:43 - the till Day means the your home
05:45 - directory and also your uh you can type
05:49 - the home directory file path something
05:52 - like this now let's see some
05:55 - options so whenever you want to go
05:58 - inside some directory as I have uh done
06:01 - so I will just say LS document and uh
06:06 - you can just list out anything but you
06:09 - can just write LS and then dot dot and
06:13 - this dot dot means you want to print out
06:17 - one step back directory structure right
06:20 - so whenever you press LS like this it
06:23 - will give you programming knowledge
06:26 - because right now we are in home and
06:29 - then programming knowledge so whenever
06:32 - we want to uh print the content of Home
06:34 - folder then uh we just need to give
06:38 - these two D dots it will tell you just
06:41 - one folder back right if you want to go
06:45 - two folders back and you want to list
06:47 - out the content of uh two folders back
06:51 - uh content then you can do dot dot and
06:54 - then forward slash and once again dot
06:56 - dot and then press enter and and you can
07:00 - see it will give you your root directory
07:03 - uh you know directories and file
07:05 - structure so this will uh you know go to
07:10 - the root directory because right now we
07:13 - are in home uh our home you know you
07:17 - directory so whenever you go one step
07:19 - back you will be here in your home and
07:22 - one step back once again you will be in
07:25 - your root folder okay once again I will
07:28 - uh clear the screen and then we will
07:31 - move forward now uh there is uh are some
07:36 - Flags or options as I told you you can
07:38 - use with ls files so for example you
07:41 - give LS minus L and this means you want
07:46 - to list out all the files and directory
07:48 - in Long format and when you press enter
07:51 - it will give you the listings in Long
07:53 - format let me just uh make it a little
07:57 - bit bigger and I will give it once again
07:59 - in this command so clear and LS minus L
08:03 - and it gives you the you know content in
08:06 - Long format long format means it will
08:09 - give you the details uh who is your uh
08:13 - you know user what are the rights for
08:17 - this file and what is the size of your
08:20 - file and at which date this file was
08:23 - created and the time at which this file
08:26 - is created right now you may wondering
08:30 - what is this Dr WXR or what are all
08:34 - these things so you can see there these
08:38 - are the user rights so these user rights
08:42 - are separated by uh this minus uh symbol
08:46 - so the first uh you know this thing
08:50 - which is Dr WXR so what does this mean
08:55 - so d means directory here R means read w
09:01 - means uh write X means execute and once
09:04 - again R means write so these are the
09:07 - rights of the owner owner means so
09:11 - whoever is logged in so I can uh you
09:14 - know read WR execute this uh directory
09:18 - which is desktop right second is the
09:22 - group right after this minus right so
09:25 - execute and read are the rights of the
09:28 - group and then the third is for the
09:31 - others which is only execute this
09:33 - directory okay so this is how you can uh
09:38 - you know list out the long list of files
09:42 - and directories now there is one more
09:45 - command which is LS minus a and this
09:48 - will give you the hidden files also so
09:52 - this will show you the hidden files also
09:55 - so just write LS minus a and it will
09:58 - give give you all the hidden files so
10:01 - these are dots and double dots and do
10:03 - Android and Bash history logout do cach
10:08 - these are all the hidden files so hidden
10:10 - files in Linux start from dot okay and
10:14 - they will not be shown here you can see
10:16 - these uh dot files are not here so
10:20 - whenever you give LS minus a it will
10:23 - give you all the hidden files right and
10:26 - then you can combine uh the options so
10:28 - you you give LS
10:31 - minus a for uh showing the hidden file
10:34 - and then L for showing the long list
10:38 - then it will give you the hidden file
10:40 - and long list
10:42 - com combined okay so press enter it will
10:46 - give you long list and hidden file right
10:48 - something like this I will make it a
10:50 - little bit bigger so you can see it okay
10:53 - and I will uh just clear the terminal
10:55 - once again now there are some more
10:58 - commands for example you can sort
11:02 - your directory by their size so I will
11:06 - just give LS minus L for long list and
11:10 - then when you give capital S it'll sort
11:13 - your directory by their size so press
11:16 - enter and you can see the file which has
11:20 - uh the biggest size is listed first and
11:24 - then uh this will go down as according
11:28 - to the size so whatever file has the
11:31 - lowest size it will be at the bottom and
11:34 - whatever files or directory has the
11:36 - biggest size it will go at the top right
11:38 - so you can sort it something like this
11:41 - now for example we want to uh you know
11:45 - list something which uh Only We Know the
11:48 - extension of so let's uh list for
11:52 - example uh you can just write LS once
11:55 - again we will uh list out document list
11:58 - so just write documents and press enter
12:02 - and this document has uh this uh
12:05 - test.html and uh test. CS file but for
12:09 - example I want to only list out all the
12:11 - HTML files which are there in the
12:14 - document folder so what I I can do so I
12:17 - can just write LS and then I can just uh
12:20 - write documents and then I will just
12:23 - give this wild card which is estx so
12:26 - which uh will be will search for all the
12:29 - prefix uh which are there right and then
12:32 - I will just write Dot and then I will
12:35 - just write HTML so this means I want to
12:38 - search for all the files which ends with
12:42 - HTML and then I will press enter and it
12:45 - only prints out this uh test. HTML which
12:49 - is correct because we wanted to print
12:51 - out only HTML files in the other way
12:55 - when you give uh est. Atrix which means
12:59 - all the files so whatever all the
13:01 - extensions and all the names right and
13:05 - press enter and it will list out these
13:07 - two files which are there in your
13:10 - documents directory
13:12 - right now uh you can also output uh the
13:17 - content of your LS to a file so for
13:21 - example I want to uh you know save all
13:25 - the result which I have listed here to
13:28 - some file so I will write LS minus for
13:32 - example L with capital S and then I want
13:36 - to save all the content to a file so I
13:38 - can just give this angle bracket and
13:42 - then the name of the file which uh I
13:45 - want to uh you know save these content
13:48 - to so I will just say out.txt by the way
13:52 - this out.txt is not existing here so it
13:55 - will create this out.txt and then f fill
13:59 - all the result of Lis command to this uh
14:03 - you know out.txt file so this arrow
14:06 - means the direction of uh the stream so
14:09 - it'll uh put all the content into the
14:12 - output right and press enter and you
14:15 - will be able to see we have one new file
14:19 - created which is out.txt and when I open
14:22 - this file then it'll uh just you know
14:26 - fill all the result of LS minus LS
14:30 - command to this output file right so you
14:34 - can do this or you can output the
14:36 - content of the file also to a file now
14:40 - the next command is to list out only the
14:44 - director so for example you want to just
14:46 - list out only the directories you can
14:48 - just give uh LS minus D and then you
14:52 - just need to give uh estx and forward
14:55 - slash and it will list out all the
14:57 - direct directory trees okay so you can
15:00 - see it's not listing out the files but
15:03 - only the directories right so these are
15:06 - the all the important commands related
15:09 - to Lis but this is not all alsis uh is
15:13 - uh you know having more options and
15:16 - flags and if you want to know more about
15:19 - this LS command what you can do so you I
15:22 - will just clear the terminal first of
15:24 - all and to know more about this LS
15:28 - command you you can just write men and
15:31 - then LS so men is uh you know is a you
15:36 - can say the dictionary kind of thing for
15:39 - your Linux commands right and whenever
15:42 - you give this men command and then uh
15:45 - give the command name which you want to
15:47 - see or uh you want to take the reference
15:50 - of then when you when you click enter
15:53 - here it'll give you all the options
15:55 - which you can use with ls so you you can
15:58 - see LS minus list directory content so
16:01 - this is the explanation of this and then
16:04 - you can see all the flags so I have
16:06 - shown you how to use minus a but I
16:08 - haven't shown you how to use minus B so
16:11 - you can find out all the you know
16:13 - important information what this minus B
16:16 - does or what this minus C does or what
16:18 - this minus D does so d as I've shown you
16:22 - list directory entries right and uh I
16:25 - have also shown you what L does so I
16:28 - have only shown you the important
16:30 - command related to LS but there is a big
16:34 - list uh which you can uh you know
16:36 - execute with this LS command so you just
16:39 - need to write M man and then LS and it
16:42 - will give you this kind of interface
16:44 - which you can see the reference right
16:47 - and you can see at the bottom whenever
16:49 - you press Q or write quit then you uh
16:53 - quit this man terminal so I will just
16:56 - press Q which will quit the uh terminal
16:59 - right so just remember this man command
17:03 - if you want to take the reference of all
17:06 - the all the you know references of
17:09 - particular commands so I hope you have
17:11 - enjoyed this video please writ com And
