00:00 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:02 - show you how you can create your first
00:04 - visual basic windows form application
00:06 - project in Visual Studio 2015 so just
00:11 - open your Visual Studio IDE and go to
00:13 - file here and create new and click
00:17 - project and in here you will be able to
00:20 - see these options and choose the option
00:24 - which says Visual Basic and in here you
00:27 - can see a different type of project you
00:30 - can make in Visual Basic and we are
00:32 - going to choose this first option which
00:35 - is windows form application which is the
00:37 - desktop application and click OK and
00:42 - it's going to create the visual basic
00:45 - project for you now for the first time
00:48 - when you create your project it will
00:50 - look something like this now in here you
00:53 - will see your blank form and in this
00:56 - form you can design your stuff you can
00:59 - resize this form and you can pick and
01:03 - place some items which I'm going to show
01:05 - you in a moment but on the right hand
01:09 - side you can see this section called
01:11 - solution Explorer where all your project
01:15 - will be there so this is your project
01:18 - named Windows application and in here
01:21 - you have all the files related to your
01:24 - visual studio project we have this file
01:27 - which is form 1 dot VB right
01:30 - now there is something called tool box
01:33 - and if you don't see this section here
01:36 - on the left hand side you can see a
01:39 - section called toolbox so you just need
01:42 - to click it and it will show you all the
01:45 - tools which you can drag-and-drop here
01:48 - so just click this toolbox option and
01:50 - pin it so just click this option which
01:54 - is pin right so click this pin here and
01:58 - it will permanently attach this section
02:01 - to the left side right now in order to
02:05 - add these items you can see in the
02:08 - toolbox we have so many items like
02:11 - buttons and text bar
02:13 - and all the options related to this
02:18 - forms right so for example I'm going to
02:21 - add a button so I just need to drag and
02:24 - drop this button to my form and this
02:27 - will but this button will look like this
02:29 - I can resize this button like this and
02:32 - if I want to change the text on the
02:35 - button I can just click this button and
02:37 - in here you can see the properties so I
02:40 - go to the property called the text and
02:44 - in here I can change the text of this
02:46 - button for example click me ok and the
02:51 - button text will be changed and there
02:54 - are so many properties you can change
02:56 - for your tools here for example you can
03:00 - select this button and you can change
03:03 - the background or font size or
03:05 - foreground color or if you want to add
03:08 - images you can do everything from the
03:11 - properties ok so for example I want to
03:14 - change the foreground to something else
03:17 - there are so many options like this or
03:20 - from web I have these options for
03:23 - example I will choose this one and it
03:25 - will change the font color to the color
03:29 - I chose right for example I want a
03:32 - little bit darker color which is this
03:35 - one and it will change it to this thing
03:37 - or for example I want to change the font
03:40 - size I can click to the property call
03:43 - font I make it bold and make it a little
03:47 - bit bigger click OK and it will become
03:49 - bigger now in order to add the
03:52 - functionality to this button for example
03:55 - what we can do is you can select your
03:57 - button and double click on it and when
04:01 - you double click on it you will go to
04:03 - the code-behind part of your form so
04:09 - this is your form and this is the
04:11 - code-behind for your form so for example
04:15 - I want to display a message when
04:17 - somebody clicks this button so what I
04:19 - can do is I can add a message box here
04:24 - and then click
04:27 - dot show and this is the function
04:30 - inbuilt function which helps us to show
04:34 - or display some message okay so just add
04:37 - these two double quotes and inside
04:40 - whatever you add as a txt in sight these
04:45 - two double quotes it will be displaced
04:47 - as a message for example this is my
04:53 - first VA
04:57 - okay and remember you don't need any
05:00 - semicolon or anything at the last you
05:02 - just need to write it like this okay so
05:06 - now everything is set and we are ready
05:10 - to run our project so save everything
05:12 - and then just click this start button
05:15 - from here okay so this is a green button
05:18 - like this so just click it and it's
05:21 - going to compile our project and if
05:24 - there is no error it's going to run our
05:26 - project
05:30 - so now you can see our form is running
05:34 - now this is the design we have created
05:37 - and there's only one button here and
05:40 - when I click this button click me
05:41 - it's going to show me this message
05:43 - called this is my first vehicle so in
05:47 - this way you can create your first
05:49 - visual basic project in Visual Studio
