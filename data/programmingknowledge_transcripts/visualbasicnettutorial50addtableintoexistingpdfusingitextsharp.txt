00:01 - hello guys welcome once again in the
00:02 - last three videos I've been showing you
00:04 - how to create a PDF file using your
00:08 - Visual Basic Windows Form application
00:10 - and a third party dll called itch shop
00:13 - and in this video I'm going to continue
00:16 - with this itex shot dll to create the
00:19 - tables so in this video I'm going to
00:20 - show you how to create a table inside
00:23 - your PDF file and I think you will
00:28 - be familiar with this code because I've
00:32 - been writing this code in the last three
00:35 - videos so I'm going not going into
00:37 - details for this code and if you want
00:39 - you can just copy this code also and
00:44 - then in this code just go where I have
00:47 - declared PDF doc. open and PDF doc do
00:53 - close and inside this PDF do doc. open
00:58 - I'm going to write the code to create a
01:03 - table so this is the code to create a
01:07 - table I will explain this code line by
01:11 - line so first of all declare a variable
01:15 - called table which is uh instance of
01:19 - PDF P table class which is from itch
01:25 - shop and inside this
01:27 - bracket just give the number of columns
01:32 - you want in your table so this is the
01:35 - number of columns you want in your table
01:37 - right and in the second line I have
01:40 - declared a variable called cell as a new
01:45 - PDF Pell and inside this argument I have
01:50 - passed a phrase so just write new phrase
01:55 - and give the heading of your
02:00 - PDF file table name so just this is the
02:04 - table header you are going to write okay
02:08 - just write this line to give the header
02:12 - and now you will Define how
02:16 - much
02:18 - columns it will contain so this is the
02:21 - column and this is the column span okay
02:24 - so this will decide after three columns
02:27 - or after three items of cell it is going
02:32 - to repeat on it is going to add a new
02:34 - row okay so just write cell do colum
02:39 - call span is equal to three which is
02:42 - like
02:43 - this same as this right and now in the
02:49 - second line or the next line you are
02:51 - going to
02:53 - define
02:56 - the alignment of your header f quiries
03:02 - so just write cell do horizontal
03:05 - alignment is equal to one and if you
03:10 - write here one your header will appear
03:12 - in the center of the header cell okay so
03:18 - these three lines I have I think you
03:21 - have understood so first line is to
03:24 - create the column or PDF table of column
03:28 - 3
03:30 - and in the second line you are giving
03:33 - the header to your table and in the
03:37 - third
03:38 - line you which whatever cell you have
03:41 - created you are giving the span to
03:44 - your table header so because you
03:48 - have three column table so we are going
03:53 - to SP spend your table header to the
03:58 - three cells okay
04:00 - so it will cover all the three columns
04:03 - and in the fourth line we are defining
04:07 - the alignment of the header so we want
04:09 - to show our header in the middle of your
04:12 - cell that's why I have written one if
04:15 - you write here zero in place of this it
04:19 - will be a line left and if you write two
04:23 - in place of one here it will be the
04:25 - header will be aligned to the right okay
04:29 - now in the next line just copy this
04:31 - table
04:32 - variable and just add your cell which
04:36 - contains the header so just write table.
04:40 - add cell and copy and paste this
04:43 - variable here now we are going to add
04:47 - rows to
04:48 - our table so because this is a three
04:53 - column table we are going to add two
04:56 - rows for
04:57 - example so just write table do add cell
05:01 - column 1 Row one so first cell will be
05:06 - column one row one second column will be
05:09 - column 2 row two and
05:13 - third cell will contain column 3 Row
05:17 - three so for now for example I will
05:21 - delete this code which I have written
05:23 - below and I will run this code
05:26 - here and I will say create p PDF and
05:31 - when my table is created it will look
05:34 - like this so column one row one column
05:37 - two Row one and column 3 Row one which
05:40 - is which has this is Row one and this is
05:44 - column one column two and column 3 and
05:47 - you can see here your header is header
05:52 - cell is has a span of three columns so
05:57 - it's stretched from from here to here
06:01 - which covers one column 1 column 2 and
06:04 - column 3 that's why we have written
06:08 - column column span is equal to 3 for
06:11 - example I write column span is equal to
06:14 - 2
06:16 - here so I will break my code and I will
06:19 - write column
06:20 - span not here but columns call span is
06:24 - equal to two and once again I will run
06:27 - my code
06:28 - here
06:32 - and create PDF file and I will open my
06:36 - PDF you see here your column or header
06:41 - will be Spann to two columns right and
06:46 - it's a Hotpot it's created because it's
06:50 - thinking that this column will start
06:54 - from here column cells will start from
06:56 - here
06:58 - so generally whatever
07:02 - your column number is you assign the
07:07 - header size according to that right and
07:12 - once again I'm going to paste the second
07:15 - row code just add table once again
07:20 - table. add cell column 1 row two and in
07:25 - the similar fashion we will write the
07:28 - column 1 three and row two okay so this
07:33 - is the code to add table to
07:38 - your PDF file at last what you need to
07:42 - do is just add this uh table to your
07:45 - document so just write PDF doc. add
07:48 - table and this will add your table to
07:51 - your document right so this is the whole
07:54 - code to add table to your p PDF
08:01 - file and finally when I run the
08:04 - program and I will say create PDF once
08:07 - again it will show the error because my
08:09 - PDF is already open once again I will
08:13 - create the PDF and once
08:15 - again if you see I have a header and I
08:20 - have two rows in a similar way you can
08:23 - add multiple rows to
08:26 - your PDF files so so I hope you have
08:30 - enjoyed this video please rate comment
08:31 - and subscribe and bye for now
