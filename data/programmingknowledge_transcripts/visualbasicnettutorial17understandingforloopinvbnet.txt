00:01 - hello guys in this video I will show you
00:03 - how to use for loop with your Visual
00:05 - Basic Windows Farm
00:07 - application so what is a fall Loop by uh
00:12 - name itself we know that fall Loop is a
00:15 - kind of loop and specifically we use for
00:19 - Loop if we know the number of iteration
00:23 - which we want to execute for example if
00:26 - you want to show a message t 10 times
00:31 - without uh writing a quote repeatedly 10
00:35 - times then you can use for Loop and the
00:39 - number of iteration are fixed in the for
00:42 - Loop that's the main property of for
00:46 - Loop so let's get started I have taken a
00:49 - button in my sample project so just drag
00:53 - and drop a button and just change uh
00:56 - text as for Loop and I double click this
01:00 - button and first of all I will declare a
01:05 - integer variable for example so I'll
01:09 - write dim
01:12 - I
01:17 - as
01:19 - integer okay and then I will now write a
01:25 - for
01:26 - Loop so I will write
01:33 - for I which we have
01:36 - declared just
01:38 - now is equal
01:40 - to the initial value from which we are
01:44 - uh initializing our integer which is 0
01:50 - 2 and the maximum number of iteration
01:54 - you want to iterate for example 10 and
01:59 - then I hit enter and you will see here
02:03 - it's automatically has generated this
02:06 - next code for us so what it will do is
02:11 - let me just initialize this integer as
02:14 - zero also so we don't have any confusion
02:17 - in here so now for what this for Loop
02:21 - will do is it will start with zero and
02:28 - it'll execute the code which is inside
02:31 - this um for Loop and then it sees this
02:35 - next and it will increase this integer
02:39 - by one and it will keep on
02:42 - looping this code and executing this
02:44 - code which we will write inside this for
02:47 - Loop till 10 is reached right so let's
02:53 - see for example I want to show the
02:55 - message so I will
02:57 - write message box
03:01 - box do
03:04 - show and I will write a
03:07 - message for example I'll will
03:14 - write
03:17 - I
03:20 - value is equal to and then I will write
03:24 - this end sign and I will write this
03:28 - I okay and now when I run my
03:36 - program and when I click this for Loop
03:39 - it will show first value of for Loop
03:41 - which is
03:42 - zero and then 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 10
03:51 - so if you see when I just click it to
03:57 - the 12th time my message is not
04:01 - repeating because we are outside our
04:05 - fall Loop right so it goes from 0 to 10
04:09 - which are 11 values if we have
04:12 - initialized this with 1 to
04:15 - 10 then it will go or it will execute
04:19 - this code 10 times right so in this way
04:23 - you can execute any code in a loop and
04:29 - this variable can be anything it can be
04:32 - x and x and x or any variable but just
04:39 - remember it's better to initialize this
04:43 - um integer or
04:45 - whatever variable you want to Loop
04:48 - because if you don't initialize your
04:52 - Loop then it will take a random values
04:55 - and it will behave uh and uously so just
05:01 - remember that you don't forget to
05:03 - initialize this for Loop so I hope you
05:06 - have understood the basic concept behind
05:09 - for Loop and you will be able to use it
05:12 - in your Visual Basic project I hope you
05:15 - have learned something new this time
