00:00 - hey guys in this video i'm going to show
00:01 - you how you can download and install
00:03 - mingw
00:05 - on your windows 11 operating system so
00:07 - min gw provides the tool set to compile
00:11 - your c or c plus plus programs on your
00:14 - windows operating system using gcc or g
00:17 - plus plus
00:19 - so let's see how we can download and
00:20 - install mingw so first of all open your
00:23 - favorite browser and search for bin gw
00:26 - and in the search result you will see
00:28 - some websites so don't click on the
00:31 - first website which you will see here
00:33 - which is from sourceforge
00:35 - you need to open this website which says
00:39 - mingw hyphen w64.org
00:43 - so just click on this link which says
00:45 - mingw hyphen w64.org
00:50 - and once this website opens you will be
00:52 - able to see the overview here and on
00:55 - this website you can click on the
00:57 - downloads
00:58 - link here
00:59 - so here you will be able to see all the
01:02 - download link for bing w for different
01:05 - operating systems so the one we are
01:07 - looking for is the windows version so we
01:10 - are going to click on this link which
01:12 - says mingw w64 builds so just click on
01:16 - this link which is going to open this
01:19 - kind of window again
01:21 - and from here you can download the mingw
01:24 - builds from sourceforge so you need to
01:26 - click on this link now right
01:29 - so sourceforge link was
01:31 - shown directly in the search result but
01:33 - you need to
01:35 - go through this website in order to come
01:37 - to this website and once you are
01:39 - redirected to the sourceforge.net
01:42 - website you will see that min gw 64-bit
01:45 - installer exe file will be downloaded on
01:49 - your windows 11 operating system so once
01:52 - this file is downloaded i'm going to
01:53 - click on this file
01:56 - and then you will see this warning which
01:57 - says do you want to allow this app
02:00 - from unknown publisher to make changes
02:02 - on your device i trust this so i will
02:05 - click on yes here
02:06 - and i'm going to minimize this browser
02:09 - and you can see mingw installer has been
02:12 - started on my windows 11 operating
02:15 - system so on the first window i just
02:17 - need to click on next here which is
02:19 - going to
02:21 - start the installation
02:23 - here you can choose the version for
02:25 - mingw so i'm going to choose the topmost
02:29 - option which is 8.1.0 at the time of
02:31 - making this video you can also choose
02:34 - the architecture i'm going to choose x
02:36 - 8664
02:38 - and then you can choose the
02:40 - threads so generally for threads i
02:43 - always choose pause 6 but you can also
02:45 - choose win32 also
02:48 - also exception you have two options i
02:51 - will leave it as default
02:52 - and then you have the build revision i
02:55 - will leave it as default also and then
02:57 - click on next
02:59 - and this will be the location where
03:02 - your mingw compiler will be installed so
03:05 - you can see
03:06 - it will be installed in
03:09 - the program files min gw directory will
03:12 - be created and then
03:14 - this folder will be created right
03:17 - so if you don't have the good reason to
03:19 - change this location just leave it as
03:20 - default and also you can leave this
03:23 - checkbox as checked which is going to
03:25 - create a shortcut for your mingw uh
03:28 - compiler tool so i'm going to click on
03:30 - next now which is going to start the
03:32 - download of all the files and packages
03:35 - for your mingw tools
03:38 - so just wait for this process to reach
03:41 - to the 100 mark so now after some time i
03:43 - can see this window it says click next
03:46 - to continue the installation so i'm
03:47 - going to click on the next
03:50 - and now i can see this message it says
03:52 - mingw has been successfully installed
03:55 - and i can click on finish to complete
03:57 - the installation so let me click on the
03:59 - finish button so once i click on the
04:02 - finish button
04:03 - mingw is installed on my windows
04:05 - operating systems so now once mingw is
04:08 - installed first of all we need to know
04:11 - the location where mingw is installed so
04:14 - at the time of installation you might
04:16 - have noted the location so let me show
04:18 - you the default location where mingw
04:21 - will be installed so you need to go
04:23 - inside the c directory and then go
04:26 - inside
04:27 - program files and then you will be able
04:29 - to see this mingw hyphen w
04:32 - 64 bit folder here and then this folder
04:37 - will be there
04:38 - so this is the location where mingw is
04:41 - installed
04:42 - then you need to go inside mingw64
04:45 - and here
04:47 - under the bin folder
04:49 - you will see all the files which will
04:52 - help you to compile your c or c plus
04:54 - programs okay so go until the bin folder
04:58 - right
04:59 - and you need to copy this path now we
05:02 - need to set the environment variable for
05:04 - mingw so that we can
05:06 - use gcc or g plus plus command on our
05:09 - windows command prompt or powershell or
05:12 - terminal
05:13 - so for that what you need to do you just
05:16 - need to click on search and then search
05:18 - for
05:19 - edit
05:20 - env and it's going to show you this
05:22 - result which says edit environment
05:24 - variables for your account and you can
05:26 - see this window is going to open right
05:30 - now if you
05:31 - can't find this edit environment
05:34 - variable window using the search option
05:36 - then you can always open the control
05:39 - panel
05:40 - and then once control panel opens you
05:42 - need to view by category here and then
05:44 - click on system and security and then
05:47 - once again click on system here which is
05:48 - going to open the settings app and here
05:52 - it's going to show you an about section
05:55 - this link which says advanced system
05:58 - settings
05:59 - so just click on that and then click on
06:01 - environment variables which is also
06:02 - going to
06:04 - open the same window so you can choose
06:06 - any one of the method so once this
06:09 - environment variables window opens
06:11 - select path under system variables and
06:14 - then click on edit
06:16 - and then click on new here okay so it's
06:19 - going to allow you to
06:21 - add a new environment variable
06:23 - and then just copy
06:26 - the path
06:27 - until the bin folder inside your
06:31 - mingw64 bit folder okay so this path is
06:35 - until bin folder okay
06:37 - and once you copied it you can
06:40 - just
06:41 - add this path here
06:43 - inside your environment variable and
06:45 - then just press enter which is going to
06:47 - add your path
06:49 - and then click ok here and then click ok
06:52 - and then once again click on ok
06:54 - and now you can close all the windows
06:57 - here and now we can test our gcc and g
07:01 - plus plus
07:02 - versions and commands right
07:05 - so you can open the command prompt by
07:07 - just pressing cmd
07:09 - and then open the command prompt from
07:12 - the result and once the command prompt
07:14 - is open here you can just write gcc
07:18 - space hyphen hyphen
07:20 - version and then press enter and if you
07:22 - see some result which looks like this
07:25 - that means gcc command is working
07:28 - successfully on your windows 11
07:30 - operating system similarly you can also
07:32 - check the g plus plus command which is
07:34 - also used to compile your c plus
07:36 - programs so it's also going to show you
07:38 - this kind of result here so once you see
07:41 - this kind of result that means your gcc
07:43 - and g plus plus commands are working so
07:46 - let me show you how you can compile a
07:48 - very simple c program using gcc on your
07:53 - windows operating system using the gcc
07:55 - command
07:56 - so for that you just need to uh go to
07:59 - the location where
08:01 - you want to uh create uh your c file so
08:05 - i'm going to go to this folder which is
08:08 - under my documents and here i'm going to
08:10 - right click here
08:11 - and windows by default is not going to
08:14 - allow you to create
08:16 - c files directly so you need to create a
08:18 - text file first of all
08:20 - and name your file something so in my
08:23 - case hello and you can see the extension
08:26 - here hello dot text right if you don't
08:28 - see
08:29 - dot text extension here you can click on
08:32 - view
08:33 - and then click on show
08:35 - and then click on file
08:38 - name extension
08:39 - so this options should be selected in
08:42 - order to see this dot txt in front of
08:44 - your file
08:46 - once that's done you can just rename
08:48 - your file
08:49 - and then instead of dot txt just
08:52 - give the extension dot c and then press
08:55 - enter and then press yes
08:57 - which is going to create a hello.c file
09:00 - for you
09:01 - once that's done you can just copy the
09:03 - path where your c file
09:05 - is present and then once again open the
09:07 - command prompt
09:09 - and then just write cd and then paste
09:11 - the part which you have copied and then
09:13 - press enter
09:15 - and from here you can compile
09:17 - your c program so first of all you need
09:20 - to write some code inside your c program
09:22 - right so just
09:24 - open this c file
09:26 - with notepad
09:28 - generally we use some sophisticated
09:31 - editors like code blocks or visual
09:35 - studio code or some other ides to write
09:38 - our c or c plus program but let me also
09:41 - show you how you can do it without them
09:44 - so once your
09:46 - hello.c file is
09:48 - opened you just need to uh copy and
09:51 - paste a very simple c program inside it
09:53 - and then save it you can just press ctrl
09:56 - s to save it or
09:57 - just click on save from here and once
10:00 - your c program is saved
10:02 - you can go to the location where your c
10:04 - file is there
10:06 - and then just write gcc and the name of
10:09 - your file in my case my file name is
10:11 - hello.c
10:13 - and then space
10:14 - hyphen o
10:16 - hyphen o is the flag which you use to
10:18 - provide the name of your output binary
10:21 - or executable file
10:23 - so hyphen o and then the name of your
10:25 - executable file so for example i'm going
10:28 - to just say
10:29 - out
10:30 - here okay
10:32 - so
10:33 - this is the
10:34 - c a program i want to compile and once
10:37 - it's compiled successfully the binary
10:40 - will be called out or let me just name
10:42 - it output right so output
10:45 - and then press enter
10:47 - which is going to compile your c program
10:50 - and if it doesn't contain any error
10:53 - then it's going to create
10:56 - this
10:57 - output.exe file right so in order to run
11:00 - this output.exe file you can just write
11:03 - dot forward slash and the name of the
11:06 - file which is output.exe and then press
11:08 - enter which should show you the result
11:11 - but it says dot is not recognized as an
11:14 - internal or external command so this is
11:17 - how you run it in your linux operating
11:20 - systems in order to run your
11:23 - output file in windows you just need to
11:26 - write output.exe and then press enter
11:29 - which is going to just show you the
11:31 - output in my case a sample c program
11:34 - was printed because in my c program i
11:38 - was just printing a sample c program
11:40 - here right
11:42 - if your program contains some error let
11:45 - me remove this semicolon from here for
11:47 - example and then save it
11:49 - and then
11:50 - run the compile command once again which
11:52 - is gcc hello dot c
11:54 - hyphen o output
11:56 - file
11:57 - and now it shows me the error right
12:01 - because if your program contains some
12:03 - error it's going to show the error where
12:06 - this error is coming from so you can see
12:08 - this error is coming from the line
12:10 - number five okay so i can just go to the
12:13 - line number five and then fix the
12:16 - semicolon once again because it says
12:19 - expected semicolon before return right
12:23 - so i can fix it and then save it and
12:26 - then compile the program once again and
12:29 - then i will be able to see the output
12:31 - once again right so i can just write
12:34 - output.exe and it shows me the result
12:36 - once again
12:37 - so this is how you can install and use
12:41 - mingw on your windows 11 operating
12:44 - system i hope you've enjoyed this video
12:46 - and i will see you in the next video
