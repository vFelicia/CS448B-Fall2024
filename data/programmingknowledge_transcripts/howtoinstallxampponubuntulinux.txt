00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can download and install
00:04 - zamp server on your urban to operating
00:06 - system so let's get started and let's
00:08 - see how we can install it so first of
00:11 - all open your favorite browser and
00:13 - search for install samp
00:14 - and the first language will appear here
00:16 - will be from Apache a friend's dot o-r-g
00:19 - /downloads if you open the apache french
00:24 - dot o-r-g let's go to the website which
00:27 - is apache a french dot o-r-g you will
00:30 - see this downloads tab on the top of
00:33 - this website so I'm going to click on
00:35 - this downloads tab and here you will
00:38 - find variety of samp installation files
00:42 - so first is for Windows and then the
00:46 - second section is for Linux and so third
00:49 - section is for OSX so we want to
00:53 - download the binaries for the Linux
00:57 - operating system so we will just go to
01:01 - this section which says Sam for Linux
01:03 - and we are going to install the latest
01:06 - version which seems to be seven point
01:09 - two point three at the time of making
01:10 - this video so I'm going to just click on
01:13 - this option which says download 64-bit
01:15 - and this is going to download this file
01:19 - which is called Sam's Linux x64
01:22 - installation dot run file so I'm going
01:25 - to save this file on my oven to
01:28 - operating system its around one thirty
01:30 - one megabyte file so it will take some
01:33 - time to download so just wait for the
01:36 - download to complete so now the download
01:38 - of this dot run file is completed so we
01:42 - will just minimize our browser and we
01:46 - are going to open the terminal so you
01:48 - can open the terminal by clicking this
01:50 - button and then search for terminal so
01:54 - let's open the terminal and once the
01:58 - terminal is open we are going to first
01:59 - of all CD to the Downloads folder so I'm
02:03 - going to just see the two Downloads
02:05 - folder and then here we will find our
02:08 - zamp dot run file which is this one
02:12 - right so first of all we
02:13 - need to change the permission of this
02:15 - file so when for example you see the
02:19 - permissions of this file so I'm going to
02:22 - do LS - al and press Enter
02:26 - so the permission of this file is read
02:29 - write read write and read so there are
02:33 - no executable permission for this run
02:36 - file so we are going to provide the
02:39 - executable permission to this file and
02:42 - then we will run this file so to change
02:44 - the permission of the file you just need
02:47 - to run sudo and then CH mod and then + X
02:53 - to provide the executable permission and
02:55 - then the name of the file which is zamp
02:57 - - Linux - x64 and whatever is the name
03:02 - of your file okay so sudo chmod plus X
03:06 - and the name of the file which is going
03:08 - to just ask for your password so I'm
03:11 - going to just provide my password here
03:15 - and then the permissions for this file
03:18 - will be changed let's verify that by
03:21 - doing LS minus l4 this file and then
03:26 - press ENTER and now you can see X is
03:29 - added to the file permissions right so
03:34 - now we can execute our zamp file so let
03:39 - me clear the terminal and then we are
03:43 - going to just say sudo once again and
03:45 - then dot forward slash and then the name
03:48 - of your file which is zamp
03:50 - - Linux whatever dot run and then press
03:53 - enter and this is going to start the
03:56 - install law for the samp server so you
04:00 - can see this installer has been started
04:02 - so this is the first window of the setup
04:05 - we are going to just click Next and this
04:08 - is the second step where it says examp
04:11 - will be installed on opt for a slash
04:14 - lamp directory so this is the default
04:16 - directory where samp will be installed
04:18 - so we are going to click Next and then
04:22 - you will see this window here we don't
04:24 - want to do anything we just need to
04:27 - click Next and now it says ready to
04:30 - install so we are going to just click
04:32 - Next once again which will start the
04:34 - installation of this zamp
04:36 - server so I'm going to wait for the
04:38 - installation to complete so now the
04:41 - installation of zamp is completed and
04:43 - you will see this window which says
04:45 - completing the samp setup wizard launch
04:48 - exam so this check box will be checked
04:51 - so leave it as checked because we want
04:53 - to launch the samp application and then
04:56 - click finish which is going to launch
04:59 - the samp application which will look
05:01 - like this so here what we want to do is
05:04 - we want to go to manage servers here and
05:07 - you will see that Apache web server is
05:10 - already running but our MySQL database
05:13 - and trough ft PD is stopped so we will
05:18 - start one by one everything so start the
05:22 - MySQL database and then once it started
05:25 - we will start the prof FTP D so now you
05:30 - can see everything is started and
05:32 - everything is running if you want to
05:34 - stop everything you can press this
05:36 - button which will stop everything and if
05:39 - you want to restart everything you can
05:42 - just press this button which says
05:44 - restart all now to check if everything
05:47 - is working fine or not we are going to
05:49 - open a new tab here and then we are
05:52 - going to just write local host and then
05:56 - forward slash dashboard so just write
06:00 - local host dashboard or better if you
06:03 - write HTTP colon forward slash forward
06:08 - slash and then and then local host
06:10 - dashboard okay and then press Enter
06:12 - which is going to give you this welcome
06:15 - page for the Apache so if you see this
06:18 - kind of zamp apache a welcome page that
06:21 - means
06:22 - zamp server is running fine on your open
06:26 - to operating system now let's check if
06:28 - PHP my admin is working or not so for
06:30 - that you just need to write HTTP colon
06:33 - forward slash forward slash
06:35 - localhost and then PHP my admin so just
06:39 - write PHP
06:41 - my ad min and then press ENTER which is
06:45 - going to open the PHP myadmin
06:48 - welcome page so if you see this kind of
06:50 - PHP myadmin welcome page that means PHP
06:54 - myadmin is also working fine on your
06:56 - open to operating system now once you
06:59 - checked that everything is working PHP
07:01 - myadmin and the Sam server you're going
07:04 - to just minimize the browser so let's
07:07 - say I'm going to just stop everything
07:09 - which is going to stop everything and
07:11 - then I'm going to close it so I will
07:14 - just say yes I want to close it and once
07:17 - I closed this Sam control panel how can
07:20 - I open it so you can open it by going to
07:23 - your lamp directory which is in your opt
07:27 - directory so what we can do here is we
07:30 - can go to opt which is the location
07:33 - where your lamp is installed so opt and
07:37 - then lamp and then just press enter so
07:41 - VI inside the lamp directory inside art
07:44 - and then do LS here and you will see
07:48 - lots of files here so what we are
07:51 - interested in is this file which is
07:54 - manager - Linux - X 64 dot 1 file which
07:59 - is going to start our panel which is the
08:02 - control panel we have opened so I'm
08:04 - going to just write sudo and then dot
08:07 - forward slash and then the name of this
08:10 - file which is manager - Linux - X 64 dot
08:14 - run file and then press Enter which is
08:17 - going to start this control panel so now
08:20 - you know from where you can start this
08:22 - control panel and you can see right now
08:26 - the Apache web server is stopped and
08:28 - MySQL databases stops so you can just
08:31 - press Start all which is going to start
08:35 - everything which is MySQL database
08:37 - Apache and this prof FTP D so now you
08:42 - know how to open your zamp control panel
08:44 - and where it is located so now I'm going
08:48 - to close this because everything is
08:50 - running or let's minimize this and we
08:53 - are going to just close it by a
08:54 - pressing the ctrl C button which is
08:56 - going to close this control panel and
08:59 - now what we are going to do is we are
09:01 - going to create some very basic hello
09:04 - world PHP code and we will check with
09:07 - our Apache server so now what we want to
09:11 - do is we will just write C D so we are
09:14 - in our home directory and then we will
09:16 - just type C D once again opt directory
09:21 - and inside opt we will just go to lamp
09:24 - directory and inside lam directory you
09:26 - may have observed there is a directory
09:28 - called htdocs directory so we are going
09:30 - to go inside that directory so opt lamp
09:34 - htdocs and then press enter so we are
09:37 - inside the HG docks and let's do LS here
09:40 - first of all so there are some files
09:42 - here already so what we are going to do
09:45 - is we are going to create a new file so
09:47 - I'm going to just write G add it here
09:50 - and then I will say my PHP dot PHP file
09:56 - ok so G edit is the editor name and my
10:00 - PHP dot PHP is the file name so just do
10:04 - that and don't forget to add the sudo in
10:07 - front of this command and then press
10:09 - Enter which is going to open the editor
10:12 - and here we will just write the very
10:15 - basic hello world program for your PHP
10:18 - and then I'm going to save this file and
10:20 - then I'm going to close this file ok so
10:24 - once you have closed this file you need
10:25 - to change the permission of this file
10:27 - and how you can do it you have already
10:30 - seen it which is the command so let me
10:33 - clear the terminal first of all and
10:35 - let's do LS first of all so you can see
10:38 - that my PHP dot PHP file is there so
10:42 - let's see the permission of this by
10:44 - using LS - al and then my PHP dot PHP so
10:49 - the permission is only read permission
10:52 - right now so we will change it using
10:54 - sudo chmod and then plus X and then the
11:01 - name of the file which is my PHP dot PHP
11:03 - which is going to change the permission
11:06 - of this file you can see one
11:07 - again X is added to the permissions and
11:10 - now once this is done we can just open
11:14 - our browser once again and then we will
11:17 - check using localhost forward slash your
11:21 - PHP file name so our PHP file name was
11:26 - my PHP dot PHP and then I'm going to
11:29 - just press ENTER we're just going to
11:31 - just print hello world and this hello
11:34 - world is coming from this file which is
11:38 - my PHP dot PHP okay so you can even
11:42 - change it I'm going to just use Nano
11:45 - this time my PHP dot PHP or I forgot the
11:50 - sudo command so I need to just give the
11:53 - sudo nano commands so everything which
11:56 - is inside opt you need to give sudo
11:58 - command for that so sudo nano my PHP dot
12:02 - PHP and let's add some characters after
12:04 - hello world so we know that this is not
12:08 - fake so just ctrl o for saving the file
12:12 - and then ctrl X to come out of this file
12:15 - and once again I'm going to refresh my
12:18 - localhost dot my PHP dot PHP page and
12:22 - you can see this is added to your hello
12:25 - world so in this way you can download
12:27 - and install Sam server and test your
12:30 - sample server on your open to operating
12:32 - system I hope you have enjoyed this
