00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - JavaFX tutorial for beginners in this
00:04 - video we will see how we can create a
00:06 - simple login app using java application
00:10 - so for example I want to create an app
00:14 - on which I want to give the user name
00:17 - and password and when I click the login
00:20 - button I want to open the second F XML
00:23 - file so how we can do it let's see so
00:27 - I'm going to create a new project which
00:30 - will be a Java FX project once again so
00:35 - just choose Java FX project and the name
00:37 - of the project I will name it as login
00:41 - FX and click finish and in here inside
00:47 - the source I'm going to create one more
00:50 - class so just right click on application
00:54 - package and we are going to create a
00:56 - class called mean controller for the
01:00 - controller and I'm going to create two F
01:04 - XML files one for login and other for if
01:10 - the login is success I want to open the
01:12 - second scene right so I'm going to first
01:16 - create a first
01:19 - Epic's ml file so right click and choose
01:22 - this new F XML document and first of all
01:26 - I will name it as login F XML ok and the
01:31 - second F XML file I'm going to name it
01:35 - as a mean F XML okay so we have two F
01:42 - XML files right so our classes and the
01:47 - effects ml files are ready so let's
01:50 - create some design so first of all I
01:53 - will choose this login F XML file right
01:57 - click and open in scene builder and I'm
02:00 - going to select this anchor pane here
02:03 - and initial size I want to give here so
02:07 - I will give the initial width of for
02:11 - example 1
02:12 - again 300 by 300 so prep with and play
02:17 - fight is equal to 300 by 300 okay and
02:21 - now what I want to do here is I want to
02:25 - first of all go to controls and inside
02:29 - the control I will take a button first
02:31 - of all and then I will take our text
02:35 - field from here so just search for text
02:38 - field which is for user name and I'm
02:42 - going to choose a password field so
02:45 - password field is a special kind of
02:47 - field on which the characters are not
02:52 - visible so it will show something like
02:55 - dot dot dot dot instead of the character
02:58 - so your password is protected right and
03:01 - I'm also going to take our label from
03:05 - here so just take a labels to show if
03:07 - our login is successful or not okay so
03:12 - we have two text boxes one label and one
03:18 - button now I'm going to just select all
03:22 - these item and change the font size of
03:25 - all these items to 18 for example so I
03:30 - will just select 18 here and I will just
03:32 - readjust these text boxes something like
03:36 - this
03:36 - okay now to show some prompt text for
03:40 - example we want to prompt user that this
03:43 - is our user name field and this is our
03:46 - password field what we can do is we can
03:49 - just select this text field and go to
03:52 - the properties here and at the top you
03:55 - can see prompt text so we can write here
03:58 - user name and press enter and same we
04:05 - will do for password fields so select
04:07 - password field and just write password
04:09 - here right so it will be seen here in
04:13 - the background that this field is for
04:16 - user name and this is for the password
04:18 - we can change the text of this label
04:21 - also as status for example and we can
04:24 - change the color of this
04:26 - label also using this text phil' and in
04:29 - here I'm going to choose little bit red
04:32 - color so just choose this color and now
04:38 - we have the red foreground color for
04:42 - this text now what I'm going to do is
04:45 - I'm going to change the text of this
04:46 - button also to login so it's so clearly
04:52 - visible and now we are ready I think so
04:56 - let's just give the ID to this label
05:00 - also so just go to code and here ID will
05:04 - be LBL and for example status okay
05:10 - so the ID of label has status now let's
05:13 - give the ID to these username and
05:17 - password fields also just go to the code
05:19 - here and just give the FX ID to txt user
05:26 - name and for the password also just give
05:30 - the FX ID is equal to txt password okay
05:36 - and now we are going to save our code so
05:40 - just go here and save it okay now we
05:44 - will go to our Eclipse IDE and in here
05:48 - what we are going to do is in the
05:51 - controller first of all we are going to
05:53 - create these three variable which are
05:57 - two text boxes for username and password
06:00 - and one label okay
06:02 - so just give this tag here at the rate X
06:06 - effects ml and then just write private
06:10 - label and the label name should match
06:13 - the label here so just select the label
06:16 - and copy the label name and paste it
06:19 - here okay in a same way we will add the
06:23 - text box fields also so just copy and
06:28 - paste something like this and this
06:30 - should be text field and this should be
06:32 - text field also and we want to match
06:35 - this ID to the ID which we have defined
06:38 - here so just
06:39 - like this copy the FX ID from here and
06:42 - paste it here and same we will do for
06:46 - the password so just select this copy it
06:49 - and paste it here and now just click and
06:53 - fix the import for F XML and the label
06:58 - and also the text field okay so
07:02 - everything is done and inside the
07:04 - controller we will define a public
07:08 - method which will be a void and we will
07:14 - name it as for example login itself
07:16 - okay so login and here we will pass
07:21 - action event and inside the function
07:24 - what we are going to do is we are going
07:26 - to just check what is the text for these
07:31 - text boxes so we will check if the text
07:37 - for the user name matches our text so
07:41 - text dot get text cools some predefined
07:46 - value for example we define user as the
07:51 - username you want to match this keyword
07:53 - here right and we also want to match
07:57 - this password field so just take the
08:01 - text from it so get get text and dot
08:08 - equals and we want to match for example
08:13 - some keyword also for example pass okay
08:16 - and if these two keyword matches then we
08:21 - want to display some message so we will
08:24 - just copy this label here and we will
08:28 - just set text on it and we will say
08:32 - login success otherwise we will display
08:36 - the message that login is failed okay
08:40 - so just take this label and paste it
08:43 - here and in this time login is failed
08:47 - okay and one thing we forgot here is we
08:51 - haven't connected our effects
08:53 - they'll file to the controller right so
08:56 - you open your scene builder and open
08:59 - this controller on the left hand side
09:02 - you will see at the bottom here and then
09:05 - choose this class called application dot
09:07 - main controller and then choose the
09:10 - button and go to the code here on the
09:13 - right hand side and in the on action
09:16 - category just choose this login method
09:19 - which we have defined okay and save
09:22 - everything okay and one more thing which
09:27 - is remaining here is we want to go to
09:29 - the main dot Java file and in here
09:32 - instead of this border pane we want to
09:35 - provide our parent root something like
09:38 - this but this is our login dot F XML so
09:42 - this will be something like this ok save
09:46 - your code and right-click and refresh
09:49 - your code and run it our app is running
09:53 - now so for example I give some wrong
09:57 - username and password here and it shows
10:00 - login field right but for example I give
10:04 - the valid user so in our case valid user
10:09 - ID is user right so just give here user
10:12 - and well it password is pass here so
10:16 - just give pass here and click login and
10:19 - now it says login success ok now for
10:23 - example we want to open the second scene
10:26 - using this login button so for example
10:30 - if the login a success we want to open
10:33 - the main F XML file right so how do we
10:38 - do it so what we are going to do is we
10:41 - will go to the main dot Java file here
10:43 - and we will copy this code for creating
10:47 - the scene and opening the scene from
10:49 - here ok so copy this all code we are
10:53 - going to reuse this code and go to the
10:56 - main controller and inside this if
10:59 - condition after the message is shown
11:02 - just paste this code
11:05 - and this will give you this error
11:07 - because we haven't defined the stage
11:10 - here so we just need to define our state
11:14 - so just right stage primary stage
11:18 - because we have this primary stage
11:21 - object name from our previous code is
11:24 - equal to new stage and import the stage
11:30 - here so just import stage and in here
11:34 - you will see this line will give you
11:37 - this error line and it says unhandled
11:41 - exception type IO exception so we will
11:44 - extend this method as it throws so just
11:49 - throw exception from here okay so just
11:52 - throw exception and now this error will
11:56 - go okay and if you want you can just
11:59 - open this main dot F XML file first of
12:03 - all add this main dot F XML file here so
12:06 - just change the name as main dot F XML
12:10 - file and now open your main dot F XML
12:13 - file in scene builder and in here first
12:16 - of all we will provide some width here
12:20 - for example 300 by 300 and now we can
12:28 - add a label here so just add a label
12:32 - just search for the label in controls
12:35 - and drag and drop this label here and
12:38 - just go to the property and change the
12:43 - font size 18 for example and the text is
12:46 - for example mean window okay and save
12:51 - your code and now we will run our code
12:55 - but before that just right click on your
12:57 - project and refresh it and save
13:01 - everything and run it and in here we
13:05 - will give the valid user name for
13:08 - example user and valid password which
13:11 - was passed and click login and it opens
13:15 - our second scene here right with
13:19 - our main window okay now if we provide
13:23 - some random username and password it's
13:25 - not going to open the second scene and
13:28 - it says login failed so in this way you
13:32 - can create a simple login application
13:35 - using JavaFX I hope you have enjoyed
