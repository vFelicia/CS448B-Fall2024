00:01 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on C programming for beginners
00:04 - and in this video we will see how string
00:08 - Works in C and what is a
00:11 - string now what is a string first a
00:16 - string is a single dimensional array of
00:21 - characters which is terminated by a null
00:25 - character now let's see how we can
00:28 - declare string in array and then we will
00:31 - look this definition once again so what
00:34 - I have said a character array so
00:37 - character array you can declare it like
00:39 - this care and for example
00:44 - my
00:46 - string this should be string and then
00:49 - character array so square bracket for
00:51 - example we Define the size of this is
00:55 - this array as six is equal to and here
01:00 - comes uh these curly braces and inside
01:03 - these curly bra braces you can Define
01:07 - the initialization to these characters
01:10 - right or you can do something like
01:14 - this okay
01:17 - so this is called a string once again
01:21 - the definition a string is a array of
01:27 - character so this is the array of of
01:30 - characters which
01:32 - is null terminated so in this slash zero
01:39 - and C is
01:41 - called null terminated character okay
01:46 - and so this hello is the string and our
01:51 - string is terminated by this null
01:55 - character that's why we are saying our
01:58 - string as null
02:01 - terminated character array
02:04 - right in other terms you can define a
02:08 - string with a character array of uh
02:13 - non-definite size for example care
02:19 - my
02:21 - other string and we give our array uh a
02:27 - non-definite size which is not defined
02:30 - and you can just write something like
02:34 - this and it's also totally valid okay so
02:39 - you can Define string in two ways in C
02:42 - one is like definite sized array and you
02:47 - can initialize it like this
02:50 - or uh undefined sized array of
02:53 - characters and you can initialize it
02:56 - like this now to print these uh string
03:00 - you can just use print F not this but
03:05 - print F and I can just print my string
03:09 - so I can write
03:12 - my string
03:16 - value is equal to percentage s so here
03:22 - we are using percentage s to uh print
03:25 - string right and comma we will we'll
03:30 - just use this
03:33 - variable and let's see what is the value
03:36 - of this variable and let's uh give a
03:39 - line break to
03:42 - the message we are printing so that we
03:45 - can print in the next line the next
03:48 - message and in here we will just write
03:53 - my other string value and we will print
03:57 - this second variable like this okay and
04:00 - let's compile and run the program and
04:03 - it's printing the same value right my
04:07 - string value is equal to hello my other
04:10 - string value is equal to also hello
04:13 - right so in this way you can
04:16 - Define string in Array now there is a
04:20 - header file in C called string which you
04:25 - can add to your uh main. C
04:30 - and then you can use some function from
04:34 - this header file and you can perform
04:38 - some different uh functionality using
04:41 - this header file so first of all we will
04:43 - include this header file in our uh C
04:48 - main. C file so just
04:51 - include and then we will
04:56 - add string
05:00 - or string do H right so this is the
05:04 - header file in C which we can use to uh
05:08 - perform different uh functionality with
05:13 - string
05:16 - okay now the first F function from this
05:19 - string. we are going to use is string
05:24 - copy
05:26 - s
05:28 - CP y
05:30 - okay this is this function and this
05:34 - function what it does is it enables us
05:38 - to
05:39 - copy one string to another okay so for
05:44 - example we have a string of some size
05:50 - for example let's
05:53 - say we have a
05:56 - string so string
06:03 - string one for example and we give this
06:08 - uh array of size of 12 and let's uh
06:12 - Delete for this for now
06:17 - and then we will declare in the same
06:21 - manner string two of size 12 and I will
06:25 - tell you why I'm taking this size as 12
06:29 - okay in a moment and we will declare a
06:32 - third
06:34 - string and it's also of size 12 but we
06:39 - are not initializing it
06:42 - okay this should be string three okay
06:46 - and now using this
06:49 - string.
06:50 - header uh header file we can use this
06:54 - function called string cpy and it takes
06:57 - two argument one is the destination and
07:02 - one is the source okay so for example we
07:06 - want to copy this should be for example
07:09 - let's change this
07:11 - to World okay so for example I want to
07:17 - copy string one to string
07:20 - three so this string copy function
07:24 - copies string one to string three in
07:28 - this way so so you just write or you
07:32 - just take a variable in which you want
07:34 - to copy first as a first argument of Str
07:39 - Str copy and then you take the second
07:44 - argument this second argument is the
07:48 - variable whose value you want to copy
07:51 - okay so in other other word you can just
07:56 - uh think like this s Str C p
08:00 - y and it's used to uh copy to the which
08:07 - is
08:08 - destination from
08:11 - source source this should
08:16 - be Source okay so to the destination
08:21 - from source so source is string one from
08:24 - which we want to copy and destination is
08:28 - uh string three and to which we want to
08:31 - copy
08:33 - okay now there is another function in
08:37 - string.h header file which is called
08:41 - string cat St Str c a t and this
08:48 - function allows us to concatenate two
08:53 - strings for example we want to
08:57 - concatenate this first string and second
09:00 - string we can concatenate it like
09:04 - this
09:06 - so just take a first string comma second
09:12 - string okay so we want to concatenate
09:16 - first string and just after that you
09:19 - want to join second string to it you can
09:22 - do it like this okay and when you hover
09:27 - over this
09:29 - what it
09:31 - says this says that this also can return
09:36 - some value
09:39 - okay so what's uh this uh string cat
09:44 - basically doing is
09:47 - it's adding string two to string one
09:51 - okay so
09:55 - add
09:57 - string two
10:00 - to string
10:03 - one which should be like
10:07 - this string two to string one okay now
10:11 - there is another function in uh C in
10:17 - this header called
10:20 - s l n and this gives you the length of
10:25 - the string okay so for example you want
10:28 - to get the Len length of the string
10:30 - length means number of character or size
10:35 - of this uh uh character array for
10:38 - example right so we will do this
10:42 - also and this we will save in another
10:46 - variable for example we name this
10:48 - variable as integer length
10:52 - [Music]
10:55 - int
10:57 - length string
10:59 - one is equal to okay so this St Str
11:04 - length Returns the string of uh the
11:08 - variable which you pass it as an
11:12 - argument let's try to print all these
11:15 - values so first of all print
11:20 - F and this is the result of string copy
11:24 - we want to print for now for example
11:29 - string
11:30 - copy uh is equal to and percentage
11:35 - F percentage
11:37 - s and then we will just see the value of
11:42 - this uh string three because it we are
11:44 - copying into string three from string
11:47 - one using this
11:49 - function now in the same way let's
11:52 - change the line here in the same way we
11:56 - will see how this string cat
12:00 - works and we will see the value of
12:03 - string one because we are adding string
12:07 - two to string one so let's see the value
12:09 - of string one and we will also see the
12:14 - length so we will also see something
12:18 - like this so we will also verify this
12:22 - Str Str Len and this will be verified by
12:27 - this but this is the integer so we will
12:30 - write percentage D
12:32 - here let's try to compile the program
12:35 - and run it and it
12:38 - says first of all the string three value
12:42 - is hello which is true because we are
12:46 - copy we have successfully copied the
12:49 - value hello to string three okay so this
12:52 - is printing hello now second string s
12:56 - Str cat have concatenate of concatenated
13:00 - our first string and second string which
13:02 - is hello world so it has added second
13:06 - string to the first
13:08 - string the third uh value returns us uh
13:14 - 10 why it's returning 10 because now our
13:19 - string one has the size of 10 because
13:21 - it's hello world one 2 3 4 5 for hello
13:27 - and 1 2 3 4 4 five for world so string
13:32 - size is hello world
13:34 - now for example we want to see the size
13:38 - of uh string three it should be five
13:41 - because it only contains hello in it
13:44 - right compile it and it says
13:47 - five because the size of string three is
13:51 - h e l o which is 1 2 3 4 five characters
13:56 - that's why it's showing five here
13:59 - okay there are other functions in uh
14:03 - this header file uh for example string
14:08 - uh compare or some other functions for
14:12 - example you want to compare two strings
14:14 - you can use St
14:17 - Str
14:19 - CMP and this compares the two strings so
14:23 - for this string. Ed file is uh very
14:28 - important important uh header whenever
14:31 - you are working with string files I hope
