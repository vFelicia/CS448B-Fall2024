00:00 - hello guys welcome once again till now
00:03 - we have made in our WPF application a
00:07 - login page which looks like this and
00:11 - when you enter uh username and password
00:15 - and Press login it says whether your
00:19 - username and password is correct and if
00:21 - it's correct it opens the second form
00:25 - which is blank right
00:26 - now so in this video I will show you how
00:30 - how
00:31 - to uh save data in the
00:36 - database in the second form so I will
00:40 - use this form to save the data in the
00:44 - database so let's see how can I do
00:48 - this
00:49 - so I have shown you in the previous
00:52 - videos
00:53 - that how can you make this uh second XML
00:59 - file and I want to give the same
01:02 - appearance as my main window so what I
01:06 - will do
01:07 - is in the second video I think I have
01:12 - shown you how to set the image
01:15 - background to
01:17 - your window so go
01:21 - to that code in which you have set the
01:27 - image and just copy this image source
01:30 - and the source location the whole code
01:33 - from here in the
01:37 - grid section and then go to your second.
01:41 - XML file and go here in Grid once again
01:47 - grid tag and paste it here and once you
01:51 - paste this your second XML file will
01:57 - look same as your login page page so
02:01 - this is setting your
02:03 - background now for saving the data in
02:07 - the data base I need some text boxes and
02:13 - the button so I will take first of all
02:18 - from here text
02:21 - box
02:23 - one
02:25 - 2
02:26 - 3
02:28 - 4
02:34 - four okay it's
02:37 - here and I will
02:40 - take four labels
02:44 - also for employee ID name surname and
02:50 - age and I want to assemble it
02:56 - in proper
02:58 - way so like
03:02 - this so now I assembled my labels and
03:06 - text boxes and I have given the
03:09 - labels employee ID or or Eid name
03:12 - surname and age so you already know I
03:16 - think how to change just go to the
03:18 - properties here and go to the content
03:21 - just select your label and
03:24 - change the name or content from here in
03:28 - a similar way I have selected this text
03:32 - boxes and I change the text
03:36 - box name from here so first text box
03:40 - name is employee ID e Eid text second
03:44 - text box name is name underscore text
03:48 - third textbox name is surname underscore
03:51 - text and fourth text box name is agore
03:58 - text so for text boxes and
04:01 - four labels I have taken now I will take
04:05 - a
04:06 - button and I will name this button
04:11 - as BTN
04:16 - uncore
04:18 - save and I will change its content also
04:24 - as
04:27 - save so this button I will use for
04:30 - saving
04:32 - now we need to make first of all
04:36 - connection to the database with this
04:39 - page we have made the connection with
04:42 - the login page now we will make the
04:45 - connection with
04:48 - this second XML file so in my ski
04:54 - database I have these fields called Eid
04:59 - names her name age user name and
05:04 - password so I have six field but I want
05:08 - to just save four columns Eid name
05:12 - surname and age so I choose these four
05:16 - columns from
05:18 - here now I go to
05:23 - my program once again and I go to m the
05:26 - main window and here I have written the
05:31 - connection to the skite database so I go
05:34 - to the code I just copy the code in
05:36 - order to save the time so you need this
05:40 - system. dat.
05:42 - escolite Nam space so just double click
05:45 - this save button and at the top just
05:49 - import this name space system. dat.
05:53 - esite
05:55 - now once again go to your main
06:00 - XML file and here we have defined the
06:03 - connection to the database in the login
06:07 - page video so I just copy this same code
06:11 - for the connection our database name is
06:14 - database. DV and version of escal is 3
06:17 - so I just copy this string
06:20 - connection and paste it in my
06:24 - code here after this public second
06:30 - method so this is my connection now in
06:34 - here in the save button click event what
06:38 - I will do is I
06:40 - will first go to main do XML file I'll
06:46 - click this login
06:50 - button and you can just copy the login
06:54 - page code as it is because we will just
06:57 - addit this code so it will be faster
07:01 - just copy all the code which you have
07:03 - used in the login page go to your second
07:07 - or CS file and paste your all code in
07:11 - button click
07:13 - event okay now in
07:17 - here we don't need this three if
07:21 - conditions so we delete this and we
07:25 - don't need discount variable so we also
07:27 - delete this
07:30 - so the basic
07:32 - code looks like this
07:35 - so here is the connection and in the
07:38 - first line of your button click event
07:41 - you are creating escolite connection
07:43 - escolite con is equal to new escolite
07:46 - connection and pass
07:49 - your
07:50 - configuration strings or connection
07:53 - string from here so just copy it and
07:56 - paste it
07:57 - here and here we are opening our
08:04 - connection so escalate con. open and
08:09 - here we need to change this query this
08:11 - time we want to save
08:14 - the data so what we will write
08:18 - here I will write double quote and then
08:22 - close first of all and here I will
08:26 - write insert
08:33 - in insert into your database name so my
08:38 - database name is
08:41 - here employee ID so this is the table in
08:45 - which my data is there so I will copy
08:48 - the table
08:49 - name and go to my
08:52 - code and right here so insert into the
08:56 - table
08:57 - name and then we will give the table
09:01 - names so what table name we have in our
09:05 - database e name surname and age so we go
09:10 - here insert into
09:13 - Eid comma name
09:17 - comma surname comma
09:21 - age and then we
09:25 - write values here and we pass the values
09:30 - so give the bracket and here we are
09:33 - going to pass the value so we will pass
09:37 - the value in the same sequence as we
09:40 - provided the name here on name of the
09:43 - column here so first for the
09:46 - Eid I will go to my XM XML file I will
09:51 - select this Eid text box name I will
09:54 - copy this textbox name from
09:56 - here and once again go to to the code
10:00 - and in here in the query value I will
10:08 - write
10:11 - this so this will
10:14 - be like this but we don't want to write
10:19 - this like this so write single code in
10:24 - between double quote in between Plus+
10:28 - and then write
10:29 - here your employee ID text box name and
10:34 - here
10:35 - write this do textbox and after this
10:39 - textbox name
10:44 - write
10:46 - text
10:48 - okay so we have passed the value for the
10:53 - first text box so it will go into this
10:57 - Eid column
10:59 - in the same way I will
11:03 - make three other columns so I will write
11:07 - comma and then single
11:11 - code double code and
11:14 - Plus+ and my second text box name for
11:18 - name copy the name for the name text box
11:23 - go to your code paste it here before
11:27 - write this Dot
11:29 - and after right
11:35 - dot
11:38 - text
11:40 - okay two more text boxes we have so I
11:45 - will just
11:46 - copy
11:50 - these copy this code once again plus up
11:55 - to
11:57 - Plus
12:01 - and paste it two times one and
12:08 - two and we already have this plus sign
12:11 - so I delete this and the error should
12:15 - go and here also we have this plus sign
12:19 - already so
12:21 - we and then just copy the name of the
12:25 - surname text box and pass here
12:29 - and the age text
12:32 - box and pass
12:34 - here so our query basically looks like
12:38 - this I will break it into two parts so
12:41 - you can see
12:46 - this or I will leave
12:49 - it
12:52 - same so I have written the query insert
12:55 - into employee ID and the column name Eid
12:58 - names surname and age and then I pass
13:01 - the values
13:02 - for Eid name surname so write values and
13:09 - pass all the values from the text
13:11 - boxes okay now I'm passing this query in
13:16 - the escolite command as in the login
13:20 - page so this line I'm not going to
13:24 - change and then I have this create
13:28 - command execute non-query this line will
13:32 - also remain same and we will leave this
13:37 - code also same in while loop we are not
13:40 - going to pass anything the most
13:43 - important thing in this code is the
13:47 - query so write your query
13:51 - correct now once you have written this
13:54 - code I think we are not going to use
13:57 - this while loop and
13:59 - this so we can safely delete it so we
14:03 - just have this code for saving our data
14:07 - so once your data is saved you
14:09 - definitely want to show the message that
14:12 - the data is saved so I will just show
14:15 - show it in the message box so I write
14:18 - messagebox do show show and then double
14:23 - cot and I will write
14:26 - saved so I know that
14:29 - my data is saved into the database okay
14:34 - so write the query and write this code
14:37 - if you want you can pause the video
14:41 - and just write the code one thing I also
14:46 - forgot once you open the this connection
14:51 - you must close the connection also so
14:55 - the database is not busy with this
14:58 - connection ction so once you open the
15:00 - connection you just close the
15:02 - connection here you are closing the
15:05 - connection and you need to close the
15:07 - connections when you are in the login
15:11 - page so when you login here and your
15:15 - login and password condition is correct
15:17 - and you are opening the second page
15:20 - where you count is equal to one just go
15:23 - after your message message. show
15:25 - username and password is correct and
15:27 - paste it here also your connection so
15:31 - you close your connection and then you
15:34 - go to the next page one more thing you
15:37 - can do is you can hide this page so you
15:42 - can write this
15:47 - dot
15:48 - hide bracket and bracket close so this
15:52 - will hide your login page and show your
15:56 - second page now when I run the
15:59 - [Music]
16:02 - program now so in my database I have
16:06 - this three employee ID one employee ID 1
16:09 - employee ID 2 and employee ID 3 and I
16:12 - want to add one more employee ID so what
16:15 - I will do here first I will login with
16:19 - my username and password which is
16:21 - correct and you see my previous form is
16:24 - gone and new form is
16:26 - open and now I will add employee ID 4 so
16:31 - employee ID 4 his name
16:39 - is soame and age and I press
16:44 - save and you see the message that my
16:48 - data is saved now we will check in this
16:52 - escal database so once you go to the
16:55 - escal database you need to refresh your
16:58 - database so one way to refresh this
17:01 - database is just go to this structure
17:06 - Tab and
17:07 - just come back again and your data is
17:12 - refreshed and you can see whatever data
17:15 - we have enter it is saved in this
17:18 - database one more data if you want you
17:22 - can add for example
17:24 - five
17:26 - and his name is
17:34 - is any
17:36 - name and age age is too much okay so we
17:41 - have employee ID 5 also and save it my
17:46 - data is saved and I refresh my database
17:49 - go to structure once again and my data
17:52 - is here once again so in this way you
17:55 - can save your data into the D database
17:58 - using your WPF
18:01 - application okay so I hope you have
18:04 - enjoyed this video please rate comment
18:05 - and subscribe and bye for now
