00:00 - special programming knowledge in this
00:02 - video we will see how we can specify
00:04 - multiple values in select statement so
00:08 - first of all open your terminal okay by
00:17 - P is given and now let us see which are
00:25 - the databases present in our system for
00:28 - that right index less here you can see
00:33 - we have tested a bit so we are just want
00:36 - to use that for connecting that test
00:39 - database but let's let's see for connect
00:42 - and test now we are connected to paste
00:47 - out of it so let us see now which are
00:50 - the tables presenting this database for
00:53 - that type X less T we have employee
00:58 - table and preventable so let us see the
01:02 - structure of run table first
01:06 - okay so we have roll number and name
01:09 - here and student table is the primary
01:16 - key roll number okay so let us see the
01:21 - data present in front of L select from
01:28 - student so we have five rows here so let
01:35 - us consider a scenario where I want the
01:39 - data of the student which is roll number
01:42 - of either 1 0 1 1 0 3 or 1 0 5 so how we
01:50 - can write it okay so let us try the
01:54 - method which we learn earlier okay
02:10 - well to whom one or condition is equal
02:19 - to okay so we get these three grows
02:31 - because this straight rodent hair is
02:34 - roll number either 1 0 1 or 1 0 3 or x
02:38 - look at this condition it's
02:42 - unnecessarily you know because we
02:44 - specify our own number three times here
02:47 - so how we can get rid of this there's an
02:52 - elegant solution for that
02:53 - alright select and you specify okay so
03:19 - this looks more readable and it is much
03:23 - smaller than the previous one and the
03:27 - upper with the same
03:29 - it really gives us the data where
03:32 - student has roll number either 1 0 1 1 0
03:37 - 3 4 1 0 5 so let us close the terminal
03:41 - and open peach ami in this database open
03:47 - 32 this time we will use employee table
03:53 - square employee table has to follow
03:55 - employee ID in a premium so we have 4
04:07 - rows here
04:09 - employee ID is 1 2 3 4 I want to select
04:14 - the employees whose employee ID are
04:18 - either 1 or 4
04:20 - okay so we can like like ntid liquid
04:30 - bunny or PID before you can see the our
04:40 - food consists of two rows Mia and okay
04:46 - we can write it in another matter where
04:55 - he IDs we specify in p1 in and then we
05:02 - specify the way the output will be the
05:06 - same
05:07 - before Toros yeah and so this is how can
05:13 - you in keyword to specify multiple
05:16 - values in select way and you can specify
05:21 - as many as values if you want okay
05:24 - it is fine one more example so that you
05:27 - can a clear idea about it so let us try
05:31 - this feed another table a new
05:34 - development so feed table name of the
05:40 - table will be less than mobile first of
05:46 - all ID of the mobile this will yield
05:49 - company primary key will be ideal so
06:12 - whatever is created let us see slightly
06:15 - refresh as you can see we have mobile
06:19 - column ID n company okay
06:25 - let us accept some values
07:25 - so we have inserted four rows let us see
07:39 - here is our data now I want to select
07:44 - the body whose ID is 1 0 1 1 0 C and
07:49 - wonderful I don't want it 1 0 2 samsung
07:52 - okay so I write select ID in then we
08:12 - specify the multiple value 1 0 1 as you
08:22 - can see we have this data which has CIT
08:27 - of 1 0 1 or 1 0 3 or 1 0 4 we can also
08:32 - specify T 1 0 2 then we get all the data
08:37 - ok we can also specify the
08:41 - follow me I want only the company as you
08:46 - can see so that's it this is Duncan
08:52 - specify multiple values in order to find
08:56 - the beta so thanks for watching
