00:01 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Android app development for
00:04 - beginners and in this video we will see
00:07 - how to use time picker in Android time
00:11 - picker you can use to choose some time
00:14 - whenever you are making some activity
00:18 - related to time or Android app related
00:22 - to time setting or time
00:24 - picking so let's see how we can use time
00:27 - picker with an example so what you uh
00:31 - going to do is or what you need to do is
00:34 - first of all create a blank project for
00:36 - you and then go to your pallet and
00:39 - search for date and time category and in
00:42 - here choose time picker control and drag
00:47 - and drop into your
00:49 - activity and time picker looks like this
00:53 - and what we are going to do in this uh
00:55 - example is we are going to uh show show
01:00 - the time chosen by the time picker in a
01:05 - toast using a button okay so let's take
01:10 - a
01:10 - [Music]
01:12 - button and we change the text of this
01:15 - button as
01:21 - showtime and the ID I will uh leave it
01:24 - as default which is button itself now uh
01:27 - our design is complete so we can go to
01:30 - our main activity. Java in our Java
01:33 - folder so just go to the main
01:35 - activity. Java file and in here first of
01:39 - all we will uh declare the object of uh
01:43 - time picker and button
01:53 - so so our objects are created now and
01:57 - now what we are going to do is we are
01:59 - going toate create a function and uh
02:02 - this function in this function uh we
02:05 - going to write a code whenever the
02:07 - button is clicked we want to show the
02:09 - time which is picked by time picker so
02:13 - let's create a
02:16 - function
02:17 - public
02:19 - void
02:22 - show time which takes no
02:25 - argument and inside this function we are
02:28 - going to first of all cast our object
02:31 - which we have declared first is for date
02:33 - time
02:42 - picker so we have successfully casted
02:45 - both our objects and now we are going to
02:48 - take this object of uh button and we
02:52 - will call set on click method on this
02:54 - button and then inside this set on click
02:57 - uh method we are going to write the code
03:00 - to show the time right so take the
03:03 - button in instance dot set on click
03:07 - listner and inside this we are going to
03:10 - create a new onclick listener and inside
03:14 - our onclick um method what we are going
03:17 - to do is Let's uh take a toast to show
03:21 - the time so toast
03:23 - dot make text and first instance let's
03:27 - take the get base
03:32 - context second is uh the actual you know
03:38 - text in which we want to show the time
03:41 - so for example we will take this uh time
03:44 - picker instance
03:46 - dot get current hour and this will give
03:51 - you the current hours so for example if
03:53 - the time is
03:55 - 11:15 then it will show you 11 right
03:59 - because because it's hour
04:02 - plus we want to also show the minute
04:05 - also for example so after this we will
04:14 - concatenate it with minutes so time
04:17 - picker dot get current minute okay and
04:22 - the third argument is the duration so
04:28 - toast
04:32 - dot let's take length short and then we
04:36 - are going to show this message so show
04:40 - okay now our code is uh complete the
04:44 - only thing which remains is the calling
04:46 - of our function inside on create method
04:49 - so just uh call it inside on create
04:53 - method or copy this function inside on
04:57 - create method and now we can run our
05:01 - program Let's uh one do one thing more
05:06 - here is we I forgot to give this
05:09 - concatenation operator so just give it
05:12 - and now let's run our program so now our
05:17 - app is running now you can see uh the
05:20 - date time pricker and the button here
05:23 - and you can choose the time by clicking
05:26 - on this uh
05:28 - green pallet
05:30 - here so right now the time is 11: and if
05:33 - you want to change the minutes you can
05:36 - just click this thing and you can change
05:39 - minute by dragging this uh arrow on the
05:44 - circle like this or if you want to
05:46 - change the time you can change it by
05:49 - clicking on time and dragging
05:52 - this like this okay so for example I
05:56 - want to set 25 so I can set it like this
06:02 - and I can also even set the AM or PM
06:08 - options and now for example I want to
06:12 - set or or show the time so when I click
06:16 - show time button it's going to show the
06:19 - time okay
06:21 - 215 let's change the time
06:23 - [Music]
06:25 - some to some new time and
06:30 - let's change it to 10 55 and it shows
06:35 - 1055
06:37 - right so in this way you can use D date
06:41 - time picker there is one more option
06:43 - right now you can see it in you know
06:46 - 24hour format you can set it to uh other
06:51 - formats uh using
06:54 - set so you can take this uh time picker
06:59 - and
07:00 - call set is
07:04 - 24hour as true and it will be changed to
07:08 - I think 12 hour or something like this
07:11 - okay so you can do uh this also to set
07:15 - the time
07:17 - options so in this way you can use a
07:19 - date time picker or or time picker in
07:22 - Android I hope you have enjoyed this
