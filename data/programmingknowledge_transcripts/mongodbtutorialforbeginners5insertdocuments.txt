00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - MongoDB database tutorial for beginners
00:04 - in this video we will learn how we can
00:06 - insert a document inside a database so
00:11 - let's get started first of all we are
00:13 - going to create a database and for
00:15 - example we have a database called school
00:17 - so let's create a database called school
00:21 - and just execute this command and we are
00:25 - switched to this school database now for
00:28 - example the school has a number of
00:31 - students and students can be collections
00:34 - here right so we are going to create a
00:38 - collection or like student and then we
00:42 - are going to insert some document in
00:44 - that ok so just give DB dot students
00:51 - which is the name of our collections
00:53 - write dot insert and then you just need
00:59 - to give something like these round
01:03 - brackets and inside these wrong brackets
01:07 - MongoDB takes its data in the form of a
01:11 - jason okay so if you don't know what is
01:14 - jason you may probably want to learn
01:17 - about it but i can just give you a brief
01:21 - introduction that jason is a format in
01:25 - which you can you know save the data and
01:29 - it makes easier to pass your data and
01:32 - you know save your data in the JSON
01:35 - format now a jason can look something
01:39 - like this so for example we are creating
01:43 - the database for school which contains
01:46 - students as a collection and the
01:49 - document can be here this kind of a
01:53 - jason element right so this is one jason
01:58 - element in our case this is second jason
02:01 - element this is third jason element and
02:04 - they are separated by comma here okay
02:08 - now a student can have different
02:11 - attributes
02:12 - something like to number first name last
02:16 - name his age he can have other
02:19 - attributes like what class he is in or
02:24 - what subjects he likes so you can add
02:27 - these type of things inside these
02:30 - elements of a Jason right now for
02:34 - example we want to insert this one
02:37 - element of a Jason inside our MongoDB
02:42 - what we can do inside these round
02:44 - brackets you can just paste this data
02:47 - something like this okay so this is for
02:52 - inserting one document okay and when you
02:57 - execute it so for executing this you
03:00 - just need to select all this command
03:02 - which is a one command right so select
03:05 - this and then execute it and you can see
03:09 - it has been written to our database okay
03:13 - now the second way of inserting document
03:16 - is inserting multiple documents so for
03:19 - example in this JSON file we have
03:23 - multiple student data now to insert
03:27 - multiple student data what we can do is
03:29 - we can just copy all these you know
03:34 - elements from here which are separated
03:36 - by comma so just copy the second student
03:39 - and third student because first food and
03:41 - we have already created right so from
03:44 - the second student to the last student I
03:46 - am going to copy these elements and then
03:51 - to insert multiple documents you need to
03:55 - add these kind of square brackets and
03:57 - this is called a array in Jason
04:02 - terminology okay so for example you want
04:06 - to enter multiple elements then you need
04:09 - to do it inside these square brackets
04:12 - right and just paste your data so let's
04:16 - see how our data looks like so in the
04:19 - square brackets we have second student
04:22 - data then comma third student data and
04:26 - , for student data and so on and at the
04:29 - last you can see there is no comma right
04:33 - it's like a normal array of elements
04:36 - okay now just execute it first of all we
04:41 - need to select all this line because
04:43 - this is one line we want to execute
04:45 - right so just executed by this button
04:50 - and you can see seven you know data or
04:55 - seven documents are inserted into our
04:58 - database right so in this way you can
05:02 - insert single document or multiple
05:04 - document in MongoDB in the next video I
05:08 - will show you how you can query this
05:11 - data in MongoDB so I hope you've enjoyed
