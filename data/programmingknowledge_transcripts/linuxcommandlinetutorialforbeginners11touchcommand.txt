00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Linux command line tutorial for
00:03 - beginners in this video we will learn
00:05 - how to use touch command in Linux the
00:09 - touch command is the easiest way to
00:11 - create new empty files in Linux
00:15 - it is also used to change the timestamps
00:18 - on existing files or directories so
00:21 - let's see how we can use it so first of
00:23 - all I will open my terminal and as you
00:26 - can see on the desktop I have our
00:28 - directory called a dir so I will just CD
00:32 - to the desktop first of all so CD
00:35 - desktop and then I will just CD inside
00:39 - the directory okay and let's list all
00:45 - the contents of the directory so I will
00:47 - just do LS - L for long list and you can
00:52 - see this directory contains five files
00:55 - file1 file2 file three file for and file
01:00 - five and you can see the time of the
01:03 - files which is the timestamp at which
01:07 - they are created or updated right now
01:11 - for example we want to create a new
01:15 - empty file we can use a touch command to
01:20 - create a new empty file and to create a
01:24 - new empty file you just need to write
01:27 - touch which is a command and then there
01:31 - can be options for touch but the
01:34 - simplest way is to give the name of the
01:37 - file so you can see the directory
01:40 - already contains five files and I want
01:42 - to create a sixth file so I can just say
01:45 - file six and press ENTER and then I will
01:49 - just list all the files once again
01:52 - now you can see file six is created
01:55 - right and the time stamp of this file is
01:58 - the time right now which is 11:22 p.m.
02:03 - right which is the creation of this file
02:08 - time stamp of this file right and these
02:11 - files are created at
02:13 - 1005 or 10:05 p.m. you can say right so
02:20 - the first you know use of touch command
02:24 - is to create a empty file you cannot
02:27 - create a directory using a touch command
02:29 - you can only create a empty file right
02:33 - now earlier with touch command I have
02:36 - all only used the name of the file I can
02:40 - even give the you know extension of the
02:43 - file for example file seven dot txt or
02:47 - cpp or any other extension and it will
02:50 - create it okay and let's list out all
02:54 - the contents and you can see the file is
02:57 - created and because we are using the the
03:00 - long listing so it's also showing the
03:03 - permissions and the timestamp at which
03:07 - they are created or modified right now
03:10 - the second use of touch command is to
03:13 - change the timestamp of a file so let me
03:17 - clear this terminal first and I will do
03:21 - LS - L once again and you can see the
03:26 - time at which these files are created or
03:29 - modified now for example I want to you
03:33 - know change the timestamp on these files
03:37 - at which they are you know modified or
03:41 - created then what I can do is I can use
03:44 - the touch command on them okay so if the
03:48 - file doesn't exist and if you use touch
03:53 - command then it's going to create this
03:55 - file right and if file already exists
03:58 - and you can I if you use the touch
04:02 - command on this file which already
04:04 - exists it's going to update the
04:07 - timestamp of this file to the current
04:11 - you know time stem right so you can see
04:14 - current timestamp is 23 24 and I want to
04:20 - change the timestamp of this file one I
04:22 - can just to touch file one
04:25 - press ENTER and once again I can do LS -
04:29 - L and you can see file one timestamp was
04:32 - earlier
04:33 - 22:05 and right now it's 23 0 24 right
04:40 - so in this way you can update the
04:42 - timestamp of the file using a touch
04:46 - command ok so these are the two basic
04:50 - uses of touch command first is to create
04:53 - empty files and second is to update the
04:57 - timestamp of a given file so I hope you
