05:02 - this and I will copy the name of my
05:05 - second text box name just copy it and
05:10 - replace it
05:11 - here in the same way I will do the same
05:15 - for surname and age write
05:21 - comma surname is equal to single
05:25 - code double
05:27 - code Plus+
05:30 - copy
05:31 - this from here to
05:34 - here and I will just copy the name of my
05:37 - surname text field which is surname
05:40 - text and I paste it here one last more
05:45 - last time
05:47 - comma age is equal to single
05:52 - quote inside double quote inside
05:57 - Plus+ write this
06:04 - and then take the name of the age text
06:09 - field and paste it
06:12 - here so your query is basically update
06:17 - your table name set your First Column
06:20 - name and then whatever value you want to
06:23 - set
06:24 - here that here that you write and then
06:28 - comma your second column name then the
06:31 - value from the text box then the third
06:34 - column name and the fourth column name
06:37 - then the value from the text box now
06:41 - this query only defines you want to set
06:44 - your data somewhere but where you want
06:48 - to set your data you will write now so
06:52 - after this
06:54 - uh setting where you'd want to say
06:58 - update your data you will
07:00 - write where so for example you want to
07:05 - update your data on the basis of Eid so
07:10 - just copy
07:12 - this
07:14 - Eid code from here to the single code
07:18 - here before this Comma just copy this
07:21 - code and paste it after this
07:25 - where so write where and where e ID is
07:29 - equal to your text box so it will delete
07:34 - your data where your employee ID is set
07:39 - in the whatever employee ID is set in
07:43 - your Eid text box it will uh update your
07:46 - data in on the basis of that text
07:50 - box and once you executed your query we
07:55 - want to show the message instead of save
07:58 - I want to
08:00 - show
08:03 - updated
08:04 - okay now let's try and run the program
08:08 - it if it works or
08:15 - not so now my program is running I will
08:19 - log in first username and ID password
08:23 - username and password is correct okay
08:27 - and it opens the second form here let's
08:30 - see what data we want to add it so I
08:35 - have this
08:37 - six employee from 1 to six and I have
08:40 - these names from 1 to six name surname
08:43 - and age so for example I want to change
08:48 - this
08:49 - employee I ID3 data okay so I will write
08:57 - here employee ID 3 three and I want to
09:00 - change the data as I want to make this P
09:06 - capital in the name and P capital in the
09:09 - surname also so I will write
09:14 - here and capital
09:21 - P and the age age also I want to change
09:25 - for example 34 instead of this 20
09:30 - 3 and then I click this update
09:34 - button
09:35 - and your message comes your data is
09:39 - updated but here it will not show
09:42 - immediately you need to refresh your
09:44 - database so just click structure and
09:47 - once again go to your table and now you
09:50 - can see your data is saved whatever you
09:54 - have written here your data is here
09:58 - now
09:59 - okay same thing you can do
10:03 - for employee ID 4
10:06 - also so I want to make it bigger the
10:12 - first letter of the name
10:15 - and first letter of the surname also
10:19 - bigger and the
10:22 - age is same for example update data is
10:27 - updated I refresh my t
10:33 - and you see here my data is updated now
10:38 - so the name and surname has now Capital
10:42 - first letter and the age is 32 now so in
10:46 - this way you can update your data
10:50 - using WPF cop application and your esite
10:54 - database so I hope you have enjoyed this
