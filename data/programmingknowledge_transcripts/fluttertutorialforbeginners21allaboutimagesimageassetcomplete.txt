00:00 - welcome to programming knowledge so in
00:02 - this video we are going to continue
00:04 - where we left
00:05 - in the previous video we were discussing
00:08 - about images and to be more specific
00:10 - asset images and the last
00:12 - thing that we saw was the frame builder
00:15 - okay so in this video we'll discuss
00:16 - a few more properties of this image
00:19 - asset
00:20 - okay so for now i'll remove this
00:23 - height and the frame builder okay and
00:27 - i'll surround this image with a
00:31 - container now you might think that if i
00:34 - wanted a container then i could have
00:36 - simply sent it
00:37 - returned it in my frame builder but why
00:40 - am i surrounding this image asset with a
00:42 - container instead
00:44 - so the reason is when we return
00:46 - something from the frame builder
00:48 - then the entire frame acts as the image
00:51 - widget
00:52 - okay so if i apply any property to the
00:54 - image then that property will be applied
00:57 - to the entire
00:58 - frame which might be the container in
01:00 - our case
01:01 - so to avoid such type of situation we
01:04 - surround the image with a container
01:06 - okay so now for now i'll give the height
01:09 - and width
01:10 - to infinity okay height is
01:14 - double dot infinity
01:18 - and the width is also
01:21 - double dot infinity okay then i'll
01:24 - format it
01:26 - save it and you can see our image is in
01:30 - the
01:30 - center okay so now the property that we
01:33 - are going to discuss about is
01:35 - fit okay so fit decides
01:38 - how to inscribe the image into the space
01:41 - allocated
01:42 - during layout so this is the function of
01:45 - fit
01:45 - okay so there are there is a enum that
01:48 - has all the types of fit
01:50 - and the enum is as the name as you can
01:52 - see in the suggestion it is
01:54 - box fit okay so the default
01:57 - type is contain okay that means the
02:00 - entire image will be in the container
02:02 - and no part will be clipped out
02:05 - okay so let's save this and see and you
02:08 - can see no significant
02:10 - change but you can also see that no part
02:12 - is clipped out we can see the entire
02:14 - circular thing
02:16 - in the screen okay so then the next type
02:19 - is
02:20 - cover okay so that means it will cover
02:24 - the
02:24 - entire container okay so let's save this
02:28 - and see
02:30 - and you can see it has covered the
02:32 - entire container that means the entire
02:34 - height
02:35 - and the entire width okay and if some
02:39 - part is clipped out then it will be
02:41 - clipped out only okay so it doesn't care
02:44 - if the image is being clipped out or not
02:46 - but the entire screen will be filled
02:48 - with the
02:49 - image okay then the next
02:53 - type is fill okay that means it will
02:56 - fill the container
02:57 - so let's see and you can see the image
03:01 - is neither clipped out and nor any space
03:04 - is left it took
03:05 - took the entire height it took the
03:08 - entire width
03:09 - but no part of the image was clipped out
03:12 - so what happened was it got
03:14 - extended and it got stretched in some
03:17 - directions
03:18 - so as to fit the requirements okay
03:22 - now the next thing is
03:25 - fit height okay so as the name suggests
03:28 - it will fit the height and it will not
03:30 - care about its
03:32 - width so let's see
03:35 - and you can see the height has been all
03:38 - the height has been taken up
03:40 - and the width is also taken because the
03:43 - image is big but you can see
03:44 - some part of the image got clipped on
03:47 - both the
03:48 - horizontal sides and that is what the
03:51 - flutter will not care about because
03:53 - right now we are using fit height
03:55 - so all it cares about is the height okay
03:57 - and similarly we have
03:59 - fit width okay so now all it will care
04:03 - is about the width and
04:04 - whatever happens to height flutter will
04:06 - not care okay so let's see
04:08 - and you can see the entire width is
04:10 - taken by the image and
04:13 - there is no significant change in the
04:14 - height but if the image was
04:17 - a horizontally long image then you could
04:19 - see the significant change
04:22 - okay so this was fit width then the
04:25 - next one is none that means no change
04:28 - okay so it is equal to fit equal to null
04:31 - okay so the same image as it was before
04:34 - we had fit
04:36 - then the next part is scale down okay so
04:40 - what this basically does is it will
04:42 - shrink the image if required
04:44 - but it will never stretch the image okay
04:47 - so let's see
04:51 - and this also so shows no significant
04:54 - change but if we had some image
04:56 - that exceeded the length or the width
04:59 - then it would have automatically shrink
05:01 - okay so to understand better we you can
05:05 - go to the official flutter box fit enum
05:08 - and over there you can see with very
05:11 - good examples
05:12 - how these all work okay so the contain
05:15 - it contains the box okay and it
05:18 - changes the it shrinks or increases the
05:22 - size of the
05:24 - child as requi as needed okay and in box
05:27 - fit it covers the entire space in
05:30 - fill it it stretches such that
05:33 - all the spaces are filled and fit height
05:35 - it only cares about the height
05:37 - in fit width it only cares about the
05:40 - width
05:40 - in none you can see no changes happening
05:44 - irrespective of the shape and size of
05:46 - the container
05:47 - and then is scaled down and you can see
05:49 - as the size changes
05:51 - its height is shrinking okay
05:54 - so this was about this fit
05:57 - thing okay so i'll remove it for now
06:01 - and save it so now we got the image back
06:06 - in the center
06:07 - now the next thing that we are going to
06:09 - discuss about is
06:10 - alignment okay so as we have seen in the
06:14 - text in the text widget over there we
06:17 - had a
06:18 - text align but over here we have a
06:21 - alignment enum okay and
06:24 - over here these are the options that we
06:27 - have so let's try
06:28 - top center and then the image
06:31 - should be pushed to the top okay and you
06:35 - can see that
06:36 - similarly we have bottom center
06:42 - and the image is pushed at the bottom
06:44 - now if we had a
06:45 - image which had
06:48 - the width less than the screen size then
06:52 - we could also try
06:54 - bottom left and bottom right and the
06:56 - image will
06:57 - accordingly be placed at those positions
07:02 - okay so then after alignment the
07:05 - last thing that i want to discuss is
07:08 - repeat
07:09 - okay so sometimes you could see that a
07:11 - single image is being repeated in all
07:13 - the places
07:14 - okay means like in the entire screen of
07:16 - single images is
07:18 - repeated uh in column wise also and in
07:20 - rows wise also
07:22 - so that can be done using this repeat
07:25 - argument okay and it also has a image
07:28 - repeat
07:29 - enum okay and the first one let's say
07:32 - try repeat okay so that
07:33 - means that the image will be repeated in
07:36 - all the place available in the screen
07:39 - which is unused
07:40 - okay so let's see and you can see the
07:44 - image is repeated over here because this
07:46 - was the unused space
07:48 - and the same goes for this bottom part
07:51 - because this was the unused space
07:53 - okay so this is what we can do with
07:55 - repeat
07:56 - now the next type is repeat x and
07:59 - it is for the x axis that means the
08:02 - width
08:02 - so let's see and since we had no free
08:06 - space in the width
08:07 - so no repeat no repetition has taken
08:10 - place
08:11 - okay now let's try for repeat y okay
08:14 - that is for the y
08:15 - axis or the height
08:18 - so now you can see the same repetition
08:20 - took place as we
08:22 - saw in repeat okay so i hope you are
08:25 - able
08:26 - to relate all all these things together
08:29 - okay and then the last type is no repeat
08:31 - okay that means
08:33 - no repeat which is equal to null okay so
08:36 - you can
08:37 - see that okay so this was about image
08:40 - asset
08:40 - in the next video we will discuss about
08:42 - image network
08:44 - thank you
