00:00 - hello guys welcome once again in this
00:02 - video I'm going to show you how to use
00:06 - post Global or super Global variable in
00:10 - your PHP script in the last video I've
00:12 - shown you how to use get uh variable
00:15 - which is also a super Global variable in
00:18 - PHP and I have shown you how you can uh
00:22 - get some values something like this
00:27 - whenever you can uh make a form and when
00:30 - you submit this form you will be able to
00:32 - see the response and your url also will
00:35 - be modified like this the the key which
00:39 - you pass and the value key and value and
00:43 - these are separated by this end and this
00:46 - is uh prepared by PHP for you so you
00:50 - don't need to do anything here right now
00:54 - in this video we are going to see the
00:56 - post
00:57 - variable uh basically
01:00 - post uh behaves like get but it's a
01:04 - little different and I'm going to show
01:06 - you what is the differ between them but
01:09 - first of all we will prepare our uh form
01:14 - so in the last video I have made this
01:16 - form like
01:18 - this this kind of a form in HTML and
01:22 - this was the code so if you don't know
01:24 - um how to make this form just watch the
01:27 - last video and you will be able to go to
01:30 - and this time I want to make it uh
01:33 - something different so for example I
01:36 - want to make a form to use a login this
01:41 - will you know in real life situation uh
01:45 - you don't use this kind of login page
01:48 - but for this example let's make a user
01:51 - login so for example I
01:54 - have
01:56 - uh student info and I want to uh for
02:00 - example I want the user uh student to
02:03 - enter his username so I will write
02:07 - username and his
02:10 - password
02:12 - password and this name variable I will
02:15 - change it
02:17 - to uh
02:19 - username and this name I will change it
02:22 - to pass word okay and I have this submit
02:27 - button here so now when I save this I
02:33 - want to save this first of all okay so
02:36 - when I save this this form will be
02:39 - modified like this so I want to enter
02:41 - the username and password and I want to
02:43 - submit this okay so if you don't know
02:46 - how to make this just copy it okay and
02:50 - in the place of this form action I'm
02:54 - going to change this uh PHP file to the
02:57 - post method but let me make the new post
03:00 - uh post.php file so I have made this new
03:05 - file I will rename it as save
03:08 - as
03:10 - post not this
03:13 - post.php okay save it and this post.php
03:19 - I will just replace here in the student.
03:23 - PHP and I will replace this by
03:27 - post not this but
03:31 - post.php okay this is a student. PHP
03:35 - which Ive made in the last video and in
03:37 - the action of this I will pass my new
03:40 - PHP file which is post okay and the
03:44 - method this time will be post last time
03:46 - the method was get because I was uh
03:49 - showing the get demonstration get
03:52 - variable demonstration this time the
03:54 - method will be
03:56 - post
03:57 - okay so just copy this kind of form or
04:01 - make uh this kind of a form which can
04:04 - take the username and password and I
04:07 - will save it now I come to my PHP here
04:14 - and here for example I just want to
04:17 - display if the username and password is
04:21 - correct or not so for example I I can
04:24 - say if first of all how to declare this
04:28 - post you just need to use this dollar
04:31 - sign then underscore and just write
04:34 - post post and the square sign and
04:38 - semicolon and Here Comes
04:41 - Your variable okay so whatever you have
04:45 - given here username and
04:48 - password which is equal to name just
04:51 - pass it here so we are indirectly
04:53 - passing the value of username and
04:56 - password to this uh post.php
04:59 - okay in a similar way I can pass the
05:03 - password like
05:07 - this and it will give me username and
05:10 - password right but let's make this
05:13 - little bit interesting and I want to
05:16 - check whether
05:19 - my username is equal to something so I
05:23 - can say user if username is equal
05:28 - to uh for
05:30 - example what can be the name Mark
05:35 - okay and let's make it small Mark and
05:41 - password uh this and and my
05:46 - password is equal
05:49 - to uh for example some name or some
05:53 - password p s okay so if the username and
05:58 - password is correct I want to display
06:01 - some
06:02 - message
06:06 - Echo
06:08 - username and
06:11 - password
06:13 - is correct for
06:17 - example else I want to
06:21 - display um
06:23 - else it should be else I want to display
06:27 - username and password is not correct
06:29 - okay so I just copy this and paste is
06:32 - here and is not correct okay
06:38 - so now I will just remove this
06:43 - and hopefully we will not face any
06:46 - problem let's
06:48 - include brackets here so that it will be
06:52 - more visible that we have two end
06:55 - conditions here I will save this and I
06:59 - will check whether my username and
07:01 - password is correct or not so I will go
07:03 - to the browser refresh it and let's give
07:07 - the name
07:09 - Mark and password
07:12 - pass and ideally we should see the
07:15 - message username and password is correct
07:17 - let's see yes I can see the message for
07:20 - example I enter some weird
07:23 - username submit username and password is
07:26 - not correct
07:28 - right so and let's make this password uh
07:33 - character hidden or masked by some
07:35 - character so what I I can do here is I
07:38 - can go to student. PHP and I can change
07:40 - this type to
07:44 - password
07:46 - password and then when I refresh this
07:50 - form I'll just uh go back and come here
07:55 - once again and
07:57 - Mark and when I type password hopefully
08:00 - it will mask my
08:02 - password
08:04 - no let's see what can we do okay we
08:07 - haven't saved this so we need to save it
08:10 - first and then reload it and hopefully
08:15 - it will work yes it's working okay so
08:18 - pass and still we are getting the
08:20 - message and it says do you want to
08:22 - remember this password I don't want to
08:25 - remember this but yeah so it's working
08:28 - like this but the important thing to
08:31 - notice here is it's not modifying your
08:36 - URL and it's different from get variable
08:40 - in a way that in get method you will be
08:42 - able to see your url or whatever you
08:46 - have whatever variable you have passed
08:49 - from this to the to the other PHP file
08:53 - right but this will not show any URL so
08:58 - whenever you want to use uh some uh I
09:03 - mean secret stuff for example password
09:07 - uh you don't want to use get method
09:09 - because whenever you uh for example it's
09:12 - a get method and you will post something
09:17 - from or just give some uh values here
09:21 - username and password and submit this
09:23 - you will be able to see your password
09:25 - here okay or other user will be able to
09:28 - see this password in the URL which is
09:30 - unsecure so whenever you uh need to make
09:34 - some kind of uh uh login form you just
09:38 - use post method instead of this uh get
09:42 - method because this will U give you the
09:46 - URL or this will pass your variables in
09:50 - the URL and your url can anybody can
09:54 - read this URL the second thing is for
09:57 - example if you are making some site
10:00 - which can which will be able to upload
10:03 - some files for example a PHP file or a
10:06 - video file then whenever you post this
10:11 - file this URL can become you know URL
10:16 - can become very large it can have
10:18 - thousands and uh you know thousands and
10:21 - thousands of characters which will
10:23 - become very big right and this is also
10:28 - undesirable so in case of big files or
10:33 - whenever you want to post something uh
10:36 - very big or whenever you want to have a
10:38 - form which is uh submitting a big data
10:43 - or a private data just use post okay
10:47 - otherwise uh if you want to see the link
10:50 - here uh see the values which are posted
10:53 - or which are submitted then use get
10:56 - variable so this is the small little
10:58 - difference between post and get so post
11:01 - doesn't modify your url but it will
11:05 - definitely submit your data but in the
11:09 - case of get it will modify your URL and
11:13 - if you have a big uh data submission it
11:17 - will have very big URL right and just to
11:22 - check
11:23 - whether uh it's really giving me the
11:27 - username and password
11:29 - I can just Echo the username and
11:31 - password Here For
11:33 - example Echo for example
11:37 - post this one as a
11:40 - username so I can just
11:43 - concatenate
11:45 - us
11:47 - name and this should be like
11:52 - this and concatenate and password right
11:57 - just concatenate
12:04 - password
12:06 - password
12:07 - D and then our password post here and
12:12 - then maybe we can add this break so that
12:17 - it will be
12:19 - printed in the next line other message
12:21 - will be printed in the next
12:23 - line okay so hopefully it
12:26 - will give me the US us name and password
12:30 - Mark pass for example submit
12:34 - it and you will be able to see this
12:37 - username is equal to Mark password is
12:39 - equal to pass right so it transfers your
12:43 - variable to your PHP file but it doesn't
12:47 - modify your
12:48 - url so this is the video tutorial on
12:51 - post variable in PHP I hope you have
12:54 - enjoyed this video please R comment and
