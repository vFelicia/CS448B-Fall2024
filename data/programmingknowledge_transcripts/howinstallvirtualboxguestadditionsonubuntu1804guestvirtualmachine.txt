00:02 - you how you can install VirtualBox guest
00:05 - additions on Ubuntu 18.4 desktop on your
00:09 - VirtualBox so let's get started so first
00:12 - of all before installing guest additions
00:14 - we need to install some packages so just
00:18 - click on this button and then open the
00:21 - terminal from here and in the terminal
00:23 - you need to give this command I'm going
00:26 - to give this command in the description
00:28 - also so you can directly copy this
00:30 - command and paste it into your terminal
00:34 - so this is going to install some Linux
00:36 - headers and baled essentials on your
00:39 - Ubuntu operating system so I'm going to
00:41 - copy this and now I'm going to paste
00:43 - this on my terminal and then press ENTER
00:46 - and then I'm going to give my open two
00:48 - password and then it's going to install
00:52 - these packages and here I just need to
00:54 - press Y to continue so now all the
00:57 - packages are installed on my open to
01:00 - operating system so let's just install
01:03 - the VirtualBox guest additions so if you
01:06 - open the VirtualBox here you can see on
01:09 - the top there is a device option so I'm
01:12 - going to choose the device option and
01:13 - then you just need to click on this
01:15 - option which says insert guest additions
01:17 - CD image so I'm going to click on this
01:19 - and this is going to give you this kind
01:21 - of window so we just need to run this
01:24 - image so I'm going to just click on run
01:27 - which is going to run it and first of
01:30 - all we need to authenticate so give your
01:32 - open tools password and now it's going
01:36 - to install this guest Edition on your
01:39 - ribbon to operating system so now the
01:41 - VirtualBox guest additions are installed
01:43 - on my system and if you see this message
01:45 - which says VirtualBox guest additions
01:47 - starting press return to close the
01:50 - window so we are going to press Enter
01:52 - which is going to close this window and
01:55 - once the window is closed the guest
01:58 - additions are installed on your system
02:00 - the next step I'm going to do is I'm
02:02 - going to restart my virtual machine so
02:04 - I'm going to first of all shut it down
02:06 - I'm going to just power of this virtual
02:09 - machine and then I'm going to go to my
02:12 - virtual machine which is open to 18.04
02:15 - and I'm going to go to the settings and
02:18 - just verify that these two options are
02:22 - enabled so shared clipboard'
02:25 - bi-directional drag-and-drop
02:26 - bi-directional so if these two options
02:28 - are bi-directional so you will be able
02:30 - to drag and drop anything to your
02:32 - virtual machine and also you will be
02:35 - able to copy and paste from your host to
02:37 - your guest so now I'm going to once
02:39 - again restart the machine and now I'm
02:44 - going to do a small test to check
02:46 - whether this drag-and-drop and copy and
02:49 - paste is working on my ubuntu guest or
02:52 - not so first of all I'm going to open
02:54 - the text editor and on this text editor
02:58 - I'm going to paste something which I
03:02 - will copy from my windows host so this
03:04 - is the browser which runs on my windows
03:08 - and this is the Wikipedia page of Ubuntu
03:11 - and I'm going to just copy some of the
03:13 - text from here and then paste it to my
03:16 - guest on Ubuntu and you can see it folks
03:20 - so copy and paste is definitely working
03:24 - so in this way you can download and
03:26 - install VirtualBox guest additions on
03:29 - Ubuntu 18.4 guest on your VirtualBox I
