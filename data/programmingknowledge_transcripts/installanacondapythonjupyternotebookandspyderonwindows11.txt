00:09 - so first of all what is anaconda so
00:11 - anaconda is a free and open source
00:13 - distribution of python and r programming
00:16 - languages
00:18 - for data science and machine learning
00:20 - related applications in addition
00:22 - anaconda comes with various tools such
00:26 - as jupyter notebook spider ide and
00:29 - various other tools which can be used by
00:32 - beginners also to learn python
00:35 - so let's see how we can install anaconda
00:38 - distribution first of all so first of
00:40 - all open your favorite browser and
00:41 - search for anaconda python and the first

02:18 - installed you can change this location
02:20 - also but i'm going to leave it as
02:22 - default and then click on next and then
02:24 - on the next window you can see advanced
02:26 - installation options
02:29 - as you can see one option is already
02:32 - checked which is register anaconda 3 as
02:35 - the system python 3.9
02:38 - you also have this checkbox which is add
02:41 - anaconda to the system path variables
02:44 - also you can see it's not recommended so
02:46 - i'm going to just leave this window as
02:49 - it is and then click on next
02:52 - which is going to start the installation
02:54 - of anaconda on your windows 11 operating
02:57 - system if you want to see the details
03:00 - about your installation you can click on
03:02 - show details and you can see

03:18 - once again on the next button
03:21 - and here it says completing anaconda 3
03:24 - and you have these two check boxes
03:27 - anaconda distribution tutorial and
03:30 - getting started with anaconda so if you
03:32 - want to learn more about anaconda and if
03:35 - you want to uh
03:37 - see the documentation of anaconda you
03:39 - can leave these two checkboxes as
03:42 - checked otherwise you can also uncheck
03:45 - them and then click on finish so i'm
03:47 - going to uncheck both of them and then
03:49 - click on finish here
03:51 - and once the installation of anaconda
03:53 - distribution is done you can click on
03:55 - this windows start
03:57 - icon here and then you can click on all
04:00 - apps and then you will be able to see
04:02 - all the anaconda related tools under
04:04 - anaconda 3 here so i'm going to just
04:07 - expand this
04:08 - you can see
04:10 - these tools on the anacondra you have
04:13 - anaconda navigator
04:15 - then you have anaconda prompt you have
04:18 - jupiter notebook also you have spider
04:20 - ide we will talk about
04:23 - all these tools let's start with the
04:26 - anaconda prompt so i'm going to click on
04:28 - the anaconda prompt here
04:30 - which is going to open this kind of
04:32 - prompt
04:33 - if you want to
04:34 - increase the font size or change some
04:37 - properties you can click on the
04:39 - properties option here and then i'm
04:41 - going to go to the font and then click
04:43 - on let's say 20 which is going to
04:45 - increase this font a little and then
04:48 - click on ok and then click on ok
04:50 - and here
04:51 - let's first try to check the version of
04:54 - python we have installed
04:56 - with anaconda so the command will be the
04:58 - same as python
05:00 - version prompt when you install python
05:03 - using python.org so i'm going to just
05:06 - type
05:06 - python space hyphen hyphen version and
05:10 - then press enter which is going to give
05:12 - me
05:13 - the version of python here which is
05:16 - python
05:17 - 3.9.12 at the time of making this video
05:20 - also you can check the version of conda
05:21 - which is installed with your anaconda
05:23 - distribution so for that you can just
05:26 - write
05:27 - conda and then space
05:29 - info and then press enter
05:32 - which is going to give you the version
05:34 - of conda at the time of making this
05:36 - video the condo version is 4.12.0
05:41 - now you might be asking what is conda so
05:44 - conda is an open source cross platform
05:47 - language agnostic package management and
05:51 - environment management system
05:53 - which is similar to pip right so
05:56 - for example
05:57 - if you want to install any package using
06:01 - pip you give pip install and the name of
06:03 - the package
06:04 - you use the conda in a same way you can
06:07 - just write
06:09 - ah conda here and then
06:11 - install and then for example you want to
06:14 - install numpy just write numpy here and
06:17 - then
06:18 - it is going to install numpy package
06:20 - using conda package manager now let's
06:23 - say you want to uh
06:25 - start jupyter notebook using this
06:27 - command prompt right so you can just
06:29 - type
06:31 - jupiter
06:32 - notebook here and then press enter
06:35 - and once you press enter it's going to
06:37 - start the jupyter notebook on your
06:41 - default browser you can also choose the
06:44 - browser on which you want to open
06:46 - jupyter notebook so i'm going to choose
06:48 - chrome browser for now and then i'm
06:50 - going to choose always use this app to
06:52 - open
06:54 - dot html files i'm going to click on ok
06:57 - and it's going to start this jupyter
07:00 - notebook server
07:02 - and you can see uh this server is
07:05 - started at localhost
07:08 - colon8888 so on this first window you
07:10 - will be able to see that it's going to
07:13 - show you your folder structure
07:16 - so from here you can navigate to the
07:19 - folder where you want to create your
07:21 - jupyter project so let's say i want to
07:23 - create my project in my desktop folder
07:26 - i'm going to choose the desktop folder
07:28 - here and then let us say i want to
07:30 - create a new folder here so i can create
07:33 - a new folder by clicking on new here and
07:35 - then click on
07:37 - folder
07:38 - you can see this folder is created with
07:41 - the name untitled folder you can check
07:45 - this
07:46 - check box in front of untitled folder
07:48 - and then rename it by clicking on rename
07:51 - button
07:52 - let's say i want to name my folder as
07:55 - python i can just give the name and then
07:57 - click on rename which is going to rename
08:00 - this
08:01 - folder right
08:02 - i will go inside this python folder
08:05 - and then once again i'm going to click
08:07 - on new and this time i'm going to click
08:09 - on python 3 here which is going to open
08:12 - this jupiter command shell right as you
08:16 - can see right now it's untitled we are
08:18 - going to change the name little bit
08:20 - later and here you can give some python
08:23 - commands to evaluate them so it will
08:26 - work similar to your python rapple
08:29 - for example i can write five plus five
08:32 - but when you press enter it is going to
08:35 - just give you the next line so in order
08:38 - to execute this
08:41 - line you need to press shift enter and
08:45 - not
08:46 - just enter right so just press shift and
08:49 - then press enter and it is going to show
08:51 - you the result okay once again i'm going
08:54 - to
08:55 - give some
08:57 - math command here
08:59 - once again i can press shift enter and
09:02 - only then you will be able to see the
09:05 - result of that expression right
09:09 - if you want to give multiple line
09:12 - command for example x
09:14 - is equal to let's say 6
09:17 - and then you want to multiply
09:20 - let's say x
09:21 - by once again six and then you want to
09:25 - uh give one more command for that you
09:27 - can use enter but if you want to execute
09:31 - as i said you need to choose
09:33 - the shift and then enter key so i'm
09:36 - going to just press backspace here and
09:38 - then shift enter and it's going to
09:40 - evaluate
09:42 - that
09:42 - python code and then give you the result
09:45 - right
09:46 - now how to save this file so you can see
09:49 - right now it's untitled i can click on
09:52 - this and then give any name to my file
09:55 - so let's say i'm going to name my file
09:56 - as a test for example so just give the
09:59 - name and then click on rename here and
10:02 - then my jupiter notebook file name has
10:05 - been changed to test here so once you
10:08 - have saved the file you can navigate to
10:10 - the folder where you have created this
10:12 - file i have created this file inside my
10:14 - python folder so i can open the python
10:17 - and you can see there is this test dot i
10:20 - pi nb file so i can once again open this
10:23 - file by clicking on this file and then
10:26 - choosing my browser on which i want to
10:29 - open this file right so this is how you
10:31 - can
10:32 - start and use jupyter notebook using
10:34 - anaconda prompt
10:36 - let me also show you how you can
10:39 - open the spider
10:41 - ide using anaconda prompt so once again
10:45 - i can just search for
10:48 - this anaconda prompt which is here i'm
10:51 - going to open this anaconda prompt and
10:54 - to start spider you just need to give
10:56 - this command just type
10:58 - start and then space and then just type
11:03 - spy der spider start spider which is the
11:07 - command and then press enter it's going
11:09 - to open
11:10 - the spider ide
11:12 - on your windows 11 operating system so
11:15 - you can see the spider ide has been
11:18 - started now here also you can create
11:20 - your python files and then execute your
11:23 - python files or
11:25 - individual
11:26 - commands using this spider ide for
11:30 - example you can just type
11:33 - print here
11:34 - and then in the parenthesis
11:38 - under the double quotes you can type
11:40 - something for example hello
11:42 - world here
11:44 - and then you can execute this file by
11:46 - pressing on this
11:48 - green button
11:49 - and then click on run and you can see it
11:51 - prints hello world you can also see the
11:54 - location where this file is saved right
11:57 - now it's saved under
11:59 - c user and then your username and then
12:02 - there will be dot spider
12:04 - hyphen py3 folder by default and then
12:09 - there is this temp dot py file which is
12:11 - created
12:12 - you can also create any folder wherever
12:16 - you want in your file system using
12:19 - this file and then and then you can
12:21 - choose your folder in which you want to
12:23 - create your project right now one last
12:25 - thing i want to show you and that is
