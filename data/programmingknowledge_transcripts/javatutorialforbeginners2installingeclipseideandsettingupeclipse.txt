00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Java programming for
00:04 - beginners in the last video we have seen
00:07 - how we can install Java in our Windows 8
00:09 - or Windows 8.1 operating system same uh
00:13 - will be the procedure for uh installing
00:16 - Java on Windows 7 also now in this video
00:20 - we will see how we can install Eclipse
00:24 - IDE on our Windows operating system now
00:28 - IDE stands for integrated development
00:32 - environment which helps you to code your
00:37 - program so for example IDE is an editor
00:41 - which will help you to write your
00:43 - program and compile your program and
00:47 - eclipse is one such IDE and most used uh
00:52 - IDE in terms of java development so
00:56 - let's see how we can install Eclipse IDE
00:59 - on on our Windows operating system so
01:02 - first of all open your uh favorite
01:05 - browser and search for Eclipse IDE and
01:09 - the first link hopefully comes here is
01:13 - www. eclipse.org just click this link
01:16 - here and in here you will be able to see
01:18 - this download button click this download
01:20 - button and in here you will be able to
01:23 - see different uh versions of uh Java so
01:30 - not different versions of java but
01:32 - different versions of Eclipse IDE so
01:36 - Eclipse IDE uh comes in different
01:39 - versions for example ex Eclipse IDE for
01:43 - Java developers Eclipse IDE for Java e
01:46 - developers which is basically for uh web
01:50 - development and all such uh programs
01:54 - there is uh Eclipse IDE for C++ or PHP
01:58 - and other langu languages also but right
02:01 - now we are interested in developing Java
02:05 - applications so we will download uh this
02:09 - first option which is Eclipse IDE for
02:13 - Java development okay now depending upon
02:17 - the system type of your computer if it's
02:20 - 64-bit or 32bit you need to uh download
02:25 - one of uh these uh Zep files so to check
02:30 - which system type you have you can just
02:33 - uh search for system on your computer
02:37 - and and in system type you will be able
02:39 - to see that mine is 64-bit operating
02:42 - system but if you have 32-bit operating
02:44 - system you need to download uh this
02:47 - thing so I will click this windows
02:49 - 64bit and then it will uh redirect me to
02:53 - the mirror uh location which is nearer
02:57 - to my PC's location
03:00 - so this is the nearest location to my PC
03:04 - but other mirror locations are down so
03:08 - you can choose your uh mirror
03:10 - location I will click this link and then
03:14 - I will be able to save this uh ZIP file
03:17 - so it's a zip file so don't be confused
03:21 - uh that it should be executable it's not
03:24 - an executable file but it's a do zip
03:27 - file so I will wait wait for uh this to
03:31 - download and once it will be downloaded
03:33 - we will see how we can configure eclipse
03:36 - on our Windows operating
03:39 - system so my download is complete now
03:42 - now I can uh just open this uh ZIP file
03:46 - so I will just open this ZIP file and I
03:49 - will minimize everything and this ZIP
03:52 - file contains a folder called Eclipse so
03:56 - uh this ZIP file we are going to extract
03:58 - in our c C folder so I will just extract
04:02 - this to our C folder okay so just
04:07 - extract to uh the C
04:10 - folder and I will wait for the
04:13 - extraction to
04:15 - complete and once this extraction is
04:18 - complete I can see this Eclipse folder
04:21 - inside my C folders folder of my
04:25 - computer so in C I can see this eclipse
04:29 - and in here all the eclipse files are
04:33 - extracted now in order to run this you
04:35 - can just doubleclick this Eclipse icon
04:39 - and you can also create a shortcut uh to
04:43 - it and then you can drag and drop to
04:47 - your desktop and then you can double
04:50 - click this shortcut or you can click
04:53 - this Eclipse icon from here also so I
04:56 - will double click it and this is uh the
04:59 - arrow error which is commonly you know
05:02 - occurs while uh you are installing uh
05:06 - eclipse and you uh you know it's your
05:10 - first time when you install Eclipse so
05:14 - don't uh worry this error is J jvm
05:18 - terminated uh exit code is equal to two
05:22 - and this error comes generally whenever
05:27 - you have something
05:30 - uh wrong configured in your path or
05:33 - environment variable and generally
05:37 - uh from somewhere you have configured
05:41 - this path c/ program data/ Oracle SL
05:46 - Java SL Java path uh in your environment
05:51 - variable remember in the last video I
05:54 - have told you to set environment
05:57 - variable for Java jdk8 and
06:01 - j8 those environment variable are not
06:05 - responsible for this error this error is
06:08 - uh
06:09 - the uh due to the environment variable
06:14 - setting of the C SL program data
06:19 - slash uh Java program and this okay so I
06:23 - will uh open
06:25 - notepad or
06:28 - wordpad to uh you know give this
06:31 - location to you so that you can see it
06:37 - uh exact path so this path if you see
06:42 - this uh error this error then you need
06:47 - to go to this
06:49 - path and see whether this location exist
06:53 - or not so I will just copy this path to
06:56 - my folder Explorer and I can see this
06:59 - path exist so most probably this
07:02 - environment variable exist in my
07:05 - computer so I will go to my system
07:08 - search for
07:11 - system and then uh go to Advanced system
07:17 - settings and in here go to environment
07:20 - variable and in here go to path okay and
07:26 - I can see directly here the first path
07:28 - is c/ program data/ Oracle SL Java SL
07:35 - Java path so just double click this
07:39 - path variable in system variable and you
07:43 - need to delete this uh path which is
07:46 - wrongly configured right so just search
07:50 - for this path in your environment
07:53 - variable here so I can easily find uh
07:57 - this path I can see that this path is
07:59 - there so I just need to delete this path
08:03 - from my uh system
08:06 - variables and click okay here okay and
08:10 - once again click okay and click okay so
08:15 - once I have done that I will be able
08:18 - to uh run my Eclipse once again so I
08:22 - will click uh this Eclipse icon once
08:27 - again and
08:29 - now Eclipse runs so I wanted to uh you
08:34 - know intentionally uh reproduce this
08:37 - error so if you uh see this error you
08:40 - will be able to find the solution now
08:44 - first for the first time whenever
08:47 - Eclipse starts on your computer it will
08:50 - ask for the location where all your um
08:54 - project will be saved and by default it
08:58 - will be saved in c/ users in slash
09:02 - whatever your computer name is slash
09:05 - workspace so by default all your
09:08 - programs will be saved in this folder if
09:10 - you want to change this folder you can
09:12 - change it but I will leave it as default
09:15 - for now I will click
09:19 - okay and then Eclipse will open in some
09:28 - moment now eclipse is open on my
09:32 - computer right so I will just maximize
09:36 - it and I will be able to see uh this
09:39 - message welcome to the eclipse ID for
09:42 - Java
09:43 - developers and you can see they have
09:46 - some tutorials samples overview and
09:49 - what's new so to create a new project in
09:54 - uh Eclipse ID you just need to go to
09:56 - this file option here and go to to new
10:00 - and we are going to create a new Java
10:03 - project so just click Java
10:07 - project and in here in Project name you
10:12 - just need to give the name to your
10:15 - project for example
10:20 - my
10:23 - first project okay and just uh you know
10:29 - for uh the Simplicity you always uh give
10:32 - your name to your project in camel case
10:36 - starting with uh the capital letter each
10:40 - word so my in my m is capital first f is
10:45 - capital project p is capital so it's
10:47 - called camel case so it's convention to
10:50 - give uh names like
10:53 - this and just uh all things are okay you
10:58 - can just click
11:02 - next and in here you will be able to see
11:05 - that uh this will be your project folder
11:08 - and in that there will be a source
11:11 - folder it's okay click
11:15 - finish and once you do
11:18 - that Eclipse will create a my project
11:24 - folder for you okay so you can click at
11:28 - the corner and open this perspective
11:31 - it's called P perspective and in this my
11:34 - first project you will be able to see
11:36 - there is a folder called
11:39 - Source now in this folder we can create
11:43 - a simple class and this is just for
11:48 - testing whether eclipse is working the
11:51 - in the next video I will show you how to
11:53 - properly configure a project and how to
11:56 - create your first Java project you know
11:59 - in a proper way so in this uh Source
12:03 - just right click the source and create
12:07 - new class and give the class name so you
12:11 - can give the name like
12:14 - my class for example and just click this
12:19 - option uh which is which method Subs
12:22 - would you like to create just check this
12:25 - option which is public static void main
12:28 - option here here okay so just check this
12:31 - option here which will create a main
12:33 - method we will see what uh classes and
12:37 - main method in uh Java but for now we
12:40 - just want to check whether it's working
12:42 - or not just click finish and it will
12:46 - create a class called my class called ja
12:50 - Java and in here you will be able to see
12:54 - uh uh this kind of class and in here we
12:58 - we are going to print something so for
13:03 - example we want to print something uh we
13:07 - can just uh write here
13:12 - system
13:14 - system not SZ but
13:18 - system system dot
13:26 - out Dot
13:33 - print Ln for print line okay and in this
13:38 - print line we will just print hello
13:43 - world so I will
13:45 - just print this but let me change it to
13:49 - my keyboard layout and we will print
13:54 - [Music]
13:56 - hello world okay
13:59 - so I will explain this in detail but for
14:02 - now we will just check it and then we
14:05 - are going to run this program but first
14:09 - of all we will build this so I will
14:11 - right click my project and I'm going to
14:15 - uh for example
14:17 - run as Java application and then it will
14:22 - give me this uh save and launch option I
14:25 - will click
14:26 - okay and now I can see Hello World
14:29 - printed on the console here so that
14:33 - means Eclipse IDE is properly configured
14:36 - in my system and I will be able to
14:38 - compile my Java
14:41 - program so that's it for this video in
14:43 - the next video we will see how to
14:45 - properly uh you know configure our first
14:49 - Java project and what are all these uh
14:53 - you know names classes and methods means
14:56 - in Java so I hope you have enjoyed this
14:59 - video please rate comment and subscribe
15:00 - and bye for
15:01 - now
