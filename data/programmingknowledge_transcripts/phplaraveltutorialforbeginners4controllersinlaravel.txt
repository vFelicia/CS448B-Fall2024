00:00 - hey what's going on guys welcome back to
00:01 - our YouTube channel and welcome to this
00:04 - laravel for beginners tutorials and in
00:07 - this video guys we're going to discuss
00:09 - how to work with controllers inside our
00:13 - novel project and as a sort of review a
00:16 - recap in the previous video we work on
00:19 - how to use the basic routings
00:24 - so we have discussed basic routing in
00:26 - the previous tutorial and like I've said
00:29 - in this tutorial we're going to discuss
00:31 - controllers but firstly we need some
00:34 - configurations especially if you are or
00:37 - if you're using the atom code editor so
00:44 - basically we're going to install some
00:46 - packages required for us to continue
00:48 - working with our laravel project so one
00:52 - thing that we need is the terminal
00:54 - because by default terminal or the
00:58 - built-in terminal of atom is not
01:01 - currently installed so we need to
01:03 - install the atom terminal for this
01:07 - particular code editor so in order for
01:10 - us to do that we need to go to file and
01:13 - in settings and then under packages we
01:20 - can see all the packages installed here
01:22 - in our code editor and in order for us
01:27 - to install so let's go here in the
01:31 - installed section and then we need to
01:34 - search for atom terminal and then we're
01:39 - going to use this terminal for us to
01:42 - issue a command by using the artist sign
01:44 - for us to create controllers
01:47 - automatically so there are a lot of
01:50 - terminal available if we search for
01:53 - terminal inside the atom code editor but
01:59 - I'm using this one this is Adam -
02:03 - terminal 0.8.0 so accordingly it open
02:08 - terminal terminal the current files
02:10 - directory so whenever we activated this
02:13 - we'll be inside the current files
02:16 - directory so go ahead and try to install
02:20 - that so it is developed by Karen so as
02:23 - you can see here and this will be our
02:25 - basis and this will be we will be using
02:28 - this to issue commands by using the
02:30 - artisan 2 to create our controllers
02:33 - automatically so after installing the
02:36 - terminal we can finally issued artisan
02:38 - commands by using the built-in add-on
02:40 - terminal and in order for us to activate
02:43 - that we need to press alt shift e in our
02:48 - keyboard so ctrl or alt shift e and then
02:53 - this will be or this will open the
02:55 - current files directory which is the
02:58 - name of our project currently is M or PK
03:01 - project and then from here we can issue
03:05 - the artisan command to create the
03:08 - controller's of our project so let's try
03:12 - to issue command or others issue artisan
03:16 - command to create our controller so the
03:18 - key word for that is we need to use the
03:20 - PHP and then artisan and of course the
03:23 - key word make next to that is the
03:26 - controller keyword and of course the
03:29 - name of our controller which is pages so
03:32 - for example were using pages and then
03:34 - pages controller so you might want to
03:38 - use this code or I mean the naming
03:42 - notation so all the first letter of the
03:46 - word or any word is capitalized so
03:49 - example for this the P in the pages is
03:52 - capitalized and of course the C in
03:55 - controller is capitalized so every first
03:58 - letter of words in our controller must
04:01 - be like this like a naming convention
04:03 - for our controller so after that you
04:07 - just need to press ENTER and then wait
04:10 - for a few seconds and there you have it
04:13 - controller created successfully and then
04:15 - if we try to check our app directory
04:19 - inside here and there HTTP and then
04:23 - controllers and then there you can
04:26 - see the pages controller that pastry
04:29 - file has been generated with all the
04:31 - necessary terms and code included so we
04:36 - have here the name namespace up HTTP
04:40 - controllers and also it automatically
04:42 - added the illuminate HTTP request and
04:45 - then created the class pages controllers
04:48 - which extends the controller class and
04:52 - any controller that you created should
04:55 - extend the controller class and inside
04:59 - here we can create a function or method
05:02 - so a function inside the class is can be
05:05 - called a method also so public function
05:08 - and then index okay so public means that
05:15 - we can access this outside of this class
05:17 - so for now let's just say it will return
05:20 - a tax or word index and let's go back to
05:26 - our routes folder and web dot PHP so we
05:31 - have here the index setup like this so
05:35 - instead of using this so I'm just gonna
05:38 - go ahead and comment this out and then
05:46 - paste it here so instead of using this
05:51 - function to return our index so let's
05:56 - just try the pages controller or we'll
06:00 - try to use our pages controller here
06:03 - so first let's use the occultations
06:07 - pages controller and add symbol and of
06:12 - course the method or the function that
06:14 - we have defined which is the index and
06:17 - now let's try this in our browser so I'm
06:21 - just gonna save this web dot PHP and go
06:25 - back to our browser and try to refresh
06:30 - so as you can see we are on the root
06:33 - folder or the root directory of our file
06:35 - or our project and
06:37 - it says the index which is coming from
06:40 - our pages controller and index method so
06:44 - now we want to return the view index
06:49 - instead of this string index so let's go
06:52 - back to our code editor and in here
06:56 - let's go to pages controller and instead
06:59 - of returning the index we just need to
07:02 - return the view and of course it should
07:04 - be under the pages and then the file
07:09 - index so currently I think I think we
07:16 - don't have yet the index that page P
07:19 - file so let's just go ahead and create
07:21 - that so under resources so we have here
07:24 - the views so under pages let's just go
07:29 - ahead and create a new file so this
07:32 - should be index that blade that PHP and
07:37 - let's just try to copy all the HTML from
07:44 - welcome that way dot PHP to our index
07:46 - not late that PHP and just we're just
07:50 - going to delete this content from here
07:54 - and I think also the Styles all the
07:57 - stylings available here that's just it
08:00 - this and of course this font and for the
08:05 - title we're going to get back on this
08:10 - later on but for now let's just define a
08:14 - tag here each one and then welcome to
08:19 - larva
08:22 - for beginners right they're beginners
08:29 - from programming knowledge and then
08:38 - paragraphs there you go this is a larvan
08:47 - tutorial series okay so if you try to
08:53 - open up the dot env file it holds all
08:58 - the connection like the values for our
09:01 - database connection the database name
09:04 - the password username and all other
09:07 - values and also it holds the app name of
09:11 - our project so it kind it it says
09:15 - laravel it's instead of laudable I'm
09:17 - just going to rename the speak a project
09:21 - or programming knowledge project and
09:23 - save that and go back to our index that
09:27 - played at PHP so instead of using the
09:30 - laravel as title here let's just use the
09:33 - config file so config and then open
09:38 - closed parenthesis and app that name and
09:43 - if that is not available let's just use
09:47 - PK project okay
09:51 - and save that and let's go back to our
09:54 - browser and refresh our page so as you
10:01 - can see here we have the new HTML coming
10:04 - from our index that page B welcome to
10:06 - laravel for beginners from programming
10:09 - knowledge so this is a laravel tutorial
10:11 - series and this reflects all the content
10:14 - from our index dot PHP file so as you
10:18 - can see here the code or the HTML code
10:21 - behind this page okay so for now let's
10:25 - just do the same for our about page so
10:28 - let's just copy this and go to about
10:32 - that maybe that PHP file so instead of
10:34 - using the about so let's just face the
10:38 - HTML and let's just change this instead
10:42 - of welcome to level for beginners it
10:45 - should be about and let's just say here
10:51 - that this is the about page and while
10:57 - we're at it we're just going to do the
10:59 - same for our services so we need to add
11:01 - a new page so this will be services that
11:05 - laid that PHP and paste the HTML and of
11:12 - course change this into services right
11:16 - and this is the services page right so
11:21 - save that and I think I have misspelled
11:24 - the blade so I just named this in too
11:28 - late instead of needed and for our page
11:33 - controller pages controller we need to
11:35 - define functions as well two other
11:38 - functions for our services and about so
11:41 - instead of index this should be for
11:44 - about so pages that about and this will
11:48 - be for our services so services save
11:55 - that and in our route file stead of
12:02 - using this routing mechanism so let's
12:05 - just replace them with our newly updated
12:08 - functions from pages controllers so
12:11 - let's just copy this this will be for
12:14 - about and of course change this into the
12:18 - about method and this will be for our
12:21 - services and this will be services as
12:27 - well so save this and let's go back to
12:29 - our browser and try to check if all are
12:33 - working ok so try to refresh and then
12:39 - let's go to our about page so as you can
12:43 - see here we have
12:45 - updated our about page and of course if
12:49 - we try to go to our services page so
12:52 - services and there you have it this is
12:56 - the service page of our application so I
13:00 - think that's all there is to it for this
13:02 - tutorial and in the next video we're
13:04 - going to discuss how to go about blade
13:07 - template nning because currently we are
13:10 - using or HTML for our about for our
13:13 - services and for our index that PHP file
13:16 - so we want to reuse and reduce the code
13:21 - for this particular file so we're going
13:24 - to look at how to go about by templating
13:27 - on the next video thanks
