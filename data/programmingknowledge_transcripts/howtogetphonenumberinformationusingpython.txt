00:00 - hey all welcome to programming knowledge
00:02 - hope you're all doing good
00:04 - so we are back with another tutorial in
00:06 - this tutorial we are going to see
00:08 - how we are going to take out the
00:10 - information of our mobile phone number
00:12 - like its country and its service
00:15 - provider
00:17 - the network the network operator of that
00:19 - particular mobile phone number
00:21 - so the there will be two sections in the
00:23 - first section we will discuss about
00:25 - by using a particular phone number how
00:27 - we are going to extract that
00:29 - information of its country of that
00:32 - mobile phone number
00:33 - so let's go ahead and start writing the
00:35 - code the first thing what we need to do
00:38 - in order to get the country's
00:39 - information is the
00:41 - we need to import the phone numbers by
00:43 - using the phone numbers
00:45 - we are going to uh like get the context
00:47 - information
00:48 - to do that the first thing we need to do
00:50 - is we need to install a library called
00:52 - phone numbers
00:53 - in which by using that we are going to
00:57 - get the country's information so the
01:00 - in order to install that library the
01:02 - first step what we are going to do is we
01:04 - are going to use the pip
01:05 - command and use pip install
01:08 - phone numbers
01:12 - let's go ahead and click on shift enter
01:15 - so as you can see it's installed already
01:18 - which is requirements is already
01:20 - satisfied so
01:22 - i have already installed and if you have
01:24 - not installed you can use this code
01:26 - which is pip installed phone numbers
01:28 - once you have installed you just need to
01:30 - restart the kernel uh in the jupyter as
01:33 - i'm using jupyter
01:34 - so i'm going to restart this
01:39 - to make sure that the package is updated
01:44 - so here we go
01:45 - it has been restarted so
01:48 - as we have installed the phone numbers
01:50 - so we can
01:52 - use this library the first thing
01:56 - after installing what we are going to do
01:58 - is we are going to
02:00 - import the phone numbers
02:04 - okay so let's import the phone numbers
02:07 - why
02:08 - we are going to use input the phone
02:09 - numbers because by using this phone
02:11 - numbers
02:12 - and passing our mobile phone number
02:15 - uh we will be getting the country
02:18 - history
02:19 - that is the country information
02:22 - let us go ahead and click on this so we
02:24 - have i have imported phone numbers
02:27 - the next step what we are going to do is
02:30 - we are going to
02:31 - import the geocoder which will be used
02:34 - to get the latitude and longitude uh
02:36 - that is basically
02:38 - the the directions
02:41 - or uh there are so many geocoders which
02:44 - is uh
02:45 - either it could be direction either it
02:47 - could be uh
02:49 - used for getting the exact location
02:52 - let's say asia or
02:55 - india like the the countries which
02:58 - in the basic form you
03:02 - you can go to the python documentation
03:04 - if you want to view
03:05 - all the uh keywords that we are going to
03:10 - use
03:10 - uh the joko geocoder and other
03:13 - informations as well
03:15 - so i have also used this python
03:18 - documentation
03:19 - which is pip.org by project and phone
03:22 - numbers
03:25 - here if you can see
03:29 - geocoder is available so we use this
03:31 - command
03:33 - in the coming part of the program which
03:35 - is geocoder
03:37 - dot area of description number
03:42 - okay let's now go again back to the
03:44 - program
03:45 - and import the geocoder which is
03:47 - available in the library of phone
03:49 - numbers
03:51 - so i am going to use the from
03:56 - and we will be using phone numbers
04:00 - which we have imported so inside the
04:04 - phone numbers by using the from keyword
04:06 - from phone numbers
04:07 - i'll import your coder
04:13 - okay so let's go ahead and click on
04:16 - enter
04:16 - we have successfully imported the
04:18 - geocoder which we are going to
04:20 - use in the in the program
04:24 - now what we are going to do we are going
04:27 - to use our
04:28 - phone number which is let's say 9192450
04:32 - or
04:32 - your number your phone number for
04:34 - checking for for that purpose we need to
04:36 - first the pass on
04:38 - our mobile number in order to do that
04:41 - first we'll create a variable in which
04:43 - we'll be passing on our number to make
04:46 - sure
04:46 - uh that the country information we will
04:49 - get it
04:51 - i'm going to use let's a variable called
04:54 - ch underscore number either you can use
04:57 - your own variable
04:58 - and just use it for example purpose so
05:01 - inside this i'm going to use
05:06 - the phone numbers which is the library
05:09 - which we have imported
05:11 - phone numbers and we are going to use
05:14 - the
05:15 - command dot which is not parse
05:18 - pause is by used to pass on the number
05:20 - which we are going to
05:21 - import now and inside this
05:25 - columns i am i'm going to provide first
05:28 - thing
05:29 - uh our country's
05:32 - num pin which is i'm going to use it
05:34 - right now
05:35 - the country code which is plus nine one
05:38 - uh which is of mic
05:39 - and which is the country of india or
05:41 - similarly you can use
05:42 - any country uh code of u.s so let's
05:45 - provide
05:46 - i'm going to use a random number now
05:48 - let's say i'm going to point nine double
05:50 - zero
05:51 - three double zero four zero zero one
05:53 - that's it
05:54 - two four six eight ten it's ten numbers
05:57 - uh this is random number so i've just
06:01 - pointed it and followed by
06:03 - what i'm going to do in order to get the
06:05 - country information i am going to use a
06:07 - keyword called
06:09 - ch which is used to get
06:12 - the ch is basically country history or
06:15 - other particular this particular number
06:18 - the belongs to that particular country
06:20 - we are going to use that ch country
06:22 - history so
06:23 - after doing this what i am going to do i
06:27 - am going to use the
06:29 - geocoder to get the country history
06:35 - so let's use this geocoder
06:39 - okay and followed by we need to pass a
06:42 - command
06:44 - which is description of number as i have
06:47 - shown from
06:48 - the python documentation uh
06:51 - where is it
06:54 - okay right now yeah so we use
06:58 - this geocoder description for number
07:01 - to get some information about the
07:03 - location that corresponds to your phone
07:05 - number
07:07 - okay so i'm going to use that command
07:10 - which is
07:11 - geodes geocode.description
07:16 - and followed by use the same description
07:19 - underscore for underscore number this is
07:22 - a command to get the information
07:24 - by using geocoder so geogra dot
07:27 - description for underscore number and
07:30 - inside this
07:32 - as we have already passed this number
07:34 - and
07:35 - kept it inside the variable ch
07:37 - underscore number i am going to use this
07:39 - ch underscore number
07:45 - followed by i'm going to use the
07:48 - language which i need
07:49 - let's say i'm going to use en which is
07:51 - english
07:52 - similarly we can use for french fn
07:55 - and as you can see inside this
07:58 - documentation we have
07:59 - different types uh we have d e and
08:02 - french
08:02 - and i t uh that corresponds to different
08:05 - different languages f4 is for french
08:07 - d is for dutch similarly we use en
08:12 - no uh the expected output what i am
08:16 - after uh running this program
08:19 - i am expected to get india as i have
08:22 - used the plus nine one
08:24 - so it should be coming as india if you
08:26 - if you are going to use some other
08:28 - countries uh code it will it will show
08:31 - the corresponding country
08:33 - let's go ahead and run this here he goes
08:36 - we have successfully got the
08:38 - output of the program which is india as
08:40 - i have used the plus nine
08:42 - similarly we can use uh other countries
08:44 - code
08:45 - you can try it on so this is the first
08:48 - part of the program where we have
08:49 - successfully got the output as india due
08:52 - to the plus nine one
08:54 - no um yeah you can view this python
08:58 - documentation of phone numbers in which
09:00 - you have uh
09:01 - other fields as well um yeah
09:04 - you can use this right now i'm going to
09:08 - uh discuss about the second part of
09:10 - program which is we are going to view
09:13 - these particular phone numbers country
09:15 - service provider
09:16 - service provider can like the
09:18 - organization which
09:20 - uh you're going you're using we have so
09:22 - many different or
09:23 - uh organizations let's say like uh in
09:26 - india and we have ital
09:28 - we have docomo we have uh like sorry
09:32 - dokom is not now
09:33 - we have vodafone we have jio reliance
09:36 - everything will be coming in
09:37 - so let's go ahead and do that for
09:40 - in order to do that the first thing what
09:42 - we need to we require
09:44 - is first phone numbers and then we need
09:47 - a
09:47 - carrier which is used for to get the
09:50 - network service provider
09:52 - and we'll use a
09:55 - ro which is registers organization or
09:57 - radio operator
10:00 - first we need a carrier so carrier we
10:03 - need
10:04 - that so we need to import that from
10:06 - phone numbers just like we did it
10:08 - for a geocoder we'll use the same code
10:12 - which is from phone numbers
10:16 - we are going to import
10:19 - barrier this note down this
10:22 - is used to get the network service
10:24 - provider
10:26 - we are going to import this carrier
10:29 - okay then once after we have import this
10:32 - courier we will use this inside this
10:34 - program
10:35 - but before that as we have passed the
10:37 - phone number we will again pass on the
10:39 - phone number
10:40 - just like we did let's say i'm going to
10:44 - first create a variable just like we did
10:46 - it for ch underscore number
10:48 - i am going to do it uh as ro underscore
10:50 - number
10:51 - uh this is a sample variable uh like
10:55 - example variable you can create your own
10:57 - now i am going to again pass on the
10:59 - phone number
11:02 - dot i am going to use the pass command
11:05 - just like
11:06 - we did it while uh in the first part of
11:08 - the program
11:09 - we do it again and inside with
11:13 - brackets we are going to provide first
11:15 - the country code
11:17 - and let's say i'm i'm gonna use the same
11:19 - number again
11:20 - random zero three double zero four
11:21 - double zero one
11:23 - and after this just like we use the
11:26 - country history that
11:27 - like ch the that is a keyword to get the
11:31 - country information
11:32 - uh we are going to use an another
11:35 - keyword
11:36 - called ro which can be called as
11:41 - uh the business organization or radio
11:43 - operator i'm not sure about this
11:45 - uh but as i have referred the
11:47 - documentation and other commands
11:49 - so i got to know about this ro is used
11:51 - to get the
11:52 - uh the radio operator or registers
11:54 - organization
11:56 - just like 8lgo vodafone that is a
11:59 - company provider
12:01 - we use that and after that what we are
12:04 - going to do
12:05 - we are going to use this carrier which
12:07 - we have imported
12:08 - which is used to get the network
12:09 - priority provider we use that
12:12 - just like we use the geocoder
12:16 - or to get the content information we use
12:18 - the carrier let's go
12:20 - again and use this carrier
12:23 - and use the dot operator and we need to
12:26 - uh get the uh like we need to pass on
12:29 - the command just like we did it for
12:30 - description for underscore number we use
12:33 - here name underscore
12:36 - for underscore number
12:40 - okay so we use this name underscore for
12:42 - underscore number
12:44 - to get the name of that particular
12:48 - service provider now inside this
12:53 - i am going to use ro underscore number
12:56 - in which
12:57 - i have pass on my this particular mobile
12:59 - number
13:00 - random number which is which is ro
13:03 - underscore number
13:05 - just like we did it for the
13:10 - country information we use the ro
13:12 - underscore number
13:16 - okay so comma
13:20 - inside the brackets last thing we
13:22 - require is
13:23 - we'll pass en which is english
13:27 - here we go so we have written down the
13:30 - code
13:31 - after running this program the expected
13:32 - output is oops i have missed
13:35 - the plus symbol over here which
13:37 - corresponds 91 to india
13:39 - so let's now go ahead and run and check
13:41 - for the organization's name
13:44 - here we go it's showing a tell ital is
13:46 - one of the uh
13:47 - service pointers which is used in india
13:49 - so plus nine one
13:51 - now let's play ahead uh play around with
13:54 - it i'll
13:54 - just change number to nine one
13:58 - let's see what the series for that comes
14:01 - let's so it's showing reliance jio this
14:03 - is another series provider
14:05 - i'm going to pass on as 9 2 and run
14:08 - again so here we can see tata docomo is
14:12 - another series provider
14:14 - and yeah nine three is reliance zero
14:19 - so this is one more series spider which
14:21 - is bsnl mobile
14:23 - nine four then we provide nine five
14:26 - nine five zero and six is idea
14:30 - then we have nine seven vodafone
14:34 - and yet it's sell okay
14:37 - so nine nine is it
14:40 - so this is a random number which i was
14:42 - playing around similarly you can play
14:44 - around with the country codes
14:45 - uh it will show up with a different
14:48 - country name and as well as
14:50 - uh as i did it as i did for
14:53 - uh after changing this uh particular one
14:56 - by one number it was showing it
14:58 - up with different organization's name
15:02 - so that's it for today hope you like
15:04 - this session
15:05 - where we have discussed two things here
15:07 - one is for the country and one is for
15:09 - the service provider
15:11 - uh hope you guys like the tutorial so
15:13 - that's it for today we'll be coming back
15:15 - with uh
15:16 - other tutorials in a in the next
15:18 - sessions will with more exciting stuff
15:20 - thank you for joining with programming
15:22 - knowledge and for the other informations
15:24 - you can refer this uh p a y p i dot
15:27 - o r g slash project slash phone numbers
15:30 - where you have
15:31 - time zones uh where you can get time
15:34 - zones
15:35 - yeah in order to get the time zone we
15:37 - provide the code and we get the
15:39 - information
15:40 - uh output as exact location with the
15:43 - time zone europe or london
15:45 - similarly we we have different uh here
15:49 - in this
15:49 - documentation there's so many uh other
15:53 - geocoder description for valid number
15:56 - name for number just we did it for uh we
16:00 - rewriting the program
16:02 - so many steps are available here and you
16:05 - can use this and enjoy the program
16:07 - and get some interesting stuffs
16:10 - so that's it for today thank you for
16:13 - joining with programming knowledge
16:15 - bye guys
