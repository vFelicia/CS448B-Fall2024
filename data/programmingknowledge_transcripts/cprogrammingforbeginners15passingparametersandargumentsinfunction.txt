00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on C programming for beginners
00:04 - and in the last video I have shown you
00:07 - what is a function and how we can call
00:10 - function from our main uh function right
00:15 - and how we can declare a simple function
00:18 - like this okay now in this video I'm
00:21 - going to show you how to declare and use
00:24 - a function which takes parameters or
00:28 - arguments so suppose we want to uh make
00:32 - a function which adds two values and
00:36 - prints uh the sum okay so what we are
00:41 - going to do is here we will declare a
00:45 - function which returns nothing so we
00:48 - will write void and then the name of the
00:52 - function you can name it as a sum or
00:57 - add whatever you find out appropriate
01:00 - for your program okay I will name it as
01:03 - sum and
01:06 - now because we want to pass uh two
01:11 - numbers which we can sum we will pass
01:14 - them as an argument for for a function
01:17 - so how to pass an argument in these two
01:20 - brackets these two brackets we will give
01:24 - int the type of the argument first and
01:27 - then we will give the name of the
01:30 - argument for example a and in a similar
01:33 - way we can pass the second argument int
01:37 - B and you can pass any number of
01:40 - argument in the function for example int
01:43 - C int D and so on but right now we want
01:48 - to just add two numbers so we will pass
01:51 - only two arguments right and then we
01:54 - will just give two curly braces here or
01:59 - this one
02:00 - but this
02:06 - one and now what we want to do from this
02:10 - function we want to add these two
02:12 - functions and pass it into other
02:14 - variable for example we will name it as
02:17 - sum which will hold the sum of our two
02:20 - argument which is a and b so we will
02:25 - just do a + b and now we want to print
02:29 - the sum so we will just write
02:32 - print
02:34 - F and inside this we will just write sum
02:39 - is equal to percentage
02:43 - D
02:45 - comma
02:47 - sum okay and now and whenever you want
02:51 - to add these two numbers you can just
02:54 - call the sum function inside your main
02:57 - function here so just call it and uh for
03:02 - example you want to add two numbers for
03:04 - example you want to add
03:07 - 50 and 60 so we will just write 50 comma
03:11 - 60 because this sum function takes two
03:14 - arguments one is a and one is B so you
03:17 - can pass 50 as a and 60 as B here right
03:24 - and what will this will do so this some
03:28 - function will replace place a by 50 and
03:32 - B by 60 and then in here this A + B will
03:37 - be 50 + 60 and it will transfer the sum
03:40 - to this sum variable and then this sum
03:43 - will be printed here so let's uh try to
03:46 - run the program first and it prints 110
03:50 - which is true in a similar way you can
03:53 - uh call this function multiple times for
03:57 - example you want to uh get the sum
04:01 - multiple times Let's uh give slash n
04:05 - here to change the line and this time we
04:07 - want to add 100 or th000 +
04:12 - 500 and here we want to add one one1 and
04:17 - 222 and in here we want to add 1 2 3 and
04:22 - 4 5 6 for example and we want to print
04:25 - the sum of uh all these this this and
04:29 - this
04:30 - run the program and it will give you the
04:33 - sum 110 1500 which is the sum of these
04:37 - two numbers 33 or 333 which is the sum
04:42 - of these two numbers and 5 96 which is
04:46 - some sum of these two numbers
04:50 - right let me change the slash to back
04:54 - slash because it'll just
04:58 - uh change the line like this and run the
05:02 - program once again and now it will
05:04 - change the line 100
05:06 - tr500 333 and 59 579 which is the
05:12 - addition of first sum second sum third
05:16 - sum and fourth sum like this and you can
05:19 - call your function multiple times now
05:21 - for example you want uh that user should
05:24 - Define these uh two values uh at runtime
05:28 - what we can do is we can can declare two
05:31 - numbers X comma y two integers which are
05:36 - and then we will ask the user to give
05:39 - these two numbers so we will print F
05:43 - uh and we will write
05:49 - please
05:50 - enter
05:52 - to numbers okay and
05:57 - then slash n to to change the line and
06:01 - then we will just say print
06:05 - F print F number
06:12 - one number
06:14 - one and change the line once
06:18 - again and then we will use scanf which
06:23 - we use to take input right so we'll
06:26 - write scan scan f
06:29 - and then in the bracket percentage D
06:33 - percentage D and
06:36 - then comma and then this symbol to take
06:40 - integer this end symbol right and then
06:44 - value of x which will be our first
06:47 - number and in the same way we will pass
06:50 - the second number which is
06:52 - by so print F
06:55 - number two this is number two I'll give
07:00 - space so we can see it better and the
07:04 - second time we will pass or scan y so X
07:09 - is this one and Y is this one we are
07:11 - scanning two numbers and now we will
07:14 - pass these X and Y sum as a first
07:18 - argument and second argument for this
07:20 - sum function and what will this
07:24 - do now when we run the program we will
07:26 - run the program first and now the
07:29 - program asks for two numbers so it says
07:34 - please enter two numbers number one so
07:37 - we will give number one for
07:39 - example 6 4 58 this is the number one
07:43 - and PR press enter and now it says
07:46 - number two so we'll give second number
07:50 - 1025 for example and when we press
07:54 - enter we will see sum is equal to
07:58 - 7483
08:00 - which is the sum of the above two
08:03 - numbers right so in this way we can ask
08:07 - the user to give two numbers and we can
08:10 - make the sum of these two numbers and
08:12 - print it on the screen right so these
08:16 - are called function with argument and
08:20 - arguments is this one argument one
08:23 - argument two and in the same way you can
08:26 - pass any number of argument to a
08:28 - function and and you can call your
08:30 - function inside your main program with
08:33 - those
08:34 - arguments all right so I hope you have
08:38 - uh understood the basic concept of
08:40 - functions with arguments or functions
08:43 - with parameter and I hope you have
08:45 - enjoyed this video please writ comment
08:47 - and subscribe and bye for now
