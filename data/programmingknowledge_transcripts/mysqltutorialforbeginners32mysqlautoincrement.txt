00:00 - other friends some to programming
00:02 - knowledge in this video we will see how
00:05 - to use increment field the auto
00:08 - increment field basically allows a
00:11 - unique number to be generated
00:13 - automatically when a new record is
00:14 - inserted into a table and very often
00:18 - this is the primary key field that we
00:21 - would like to be created automatically
00:23 - every time a new record is inserted and
00:26 - for this we are going to use auto
00:30 - increment keyword so let me just open
00:34 - terminal mask you
00:55 - so databases we have data test database
01:03 - here just use that
01:16 - now which are the tables that we have
01:25 - okay so this is the list of tables now
01:29 - we are going to create create table the
01:37 - name of the table let's say example in
01:44 - cream and then the first field let's say
01:50 - I get a type an integer and I want this
01:55 - film to be auto increment okay the
02:06 - second cell will be working off let's
02:14 - say 20
02:15 - and lastly primary key which will be our
02:24 - ID okay okay the table is created and
02:33 - let me show you okay so here is our
02:39 - table now we are going to insert some
02:42 - records insert into and I do not want to
02:53 - insert into YT I want to insert only
02:56 - name and you you will see that by
03:02 - default it will accept the value as 1
03:06 - because by default increment value
03:09 - starts from 1 I provided name here okay
03:21 - let me show you select star from
03:33 - okay hey you can see IDs one if I insert
03:41 - another value okay you can see ID is
03:51 - equal to two so this is the use of what
03:55 - intimate let me just close this terminal
04:01 - open my workbench as I said earlier by
04:12 - default the starting value for Auto
04:14 - increment is one and it will increment
04:17 - by one for each new record and to let
04:20 - the auto increment sequence start with
04:22 - another value we can use alter table to
04:27 - alter table in name of the table an auto
04:37 - increment is equal to let's say hundred
04:48 - okay now again we will try to insert
04:53 - some values insert into
05:06 - we'll use Smith okay let me just fire
05:16 - this and let me show you the result now
05:30 - you can see the idea of Smith is hundred
05:35 - now if I insert another record it will
05:39 - be 1 0 1
05:51 - here it is so this is how you can use
05:55 - for pain treatment in your papers and
05:58 - for watching
