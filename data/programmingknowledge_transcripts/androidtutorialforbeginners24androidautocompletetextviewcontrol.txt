00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Android app development for
00:04 - beginners and in this video we will see
00:07 - how to use autocomplete text view in
00:10 - Android autocomplete text view is just
00:13 - like normal addit text but the main
00:18 - advantage or main feature of this text
00:21 - view is it will give you some suggestion
00:24 - while typing some text inside this uh
00:27 - text view so let's get started it first
00:31 - of all I have this blank project and in
00:34 - here what I'm going to do is I'm going
00:36 - to search for auto complete text view in
00:40 - uh the expert category here so this is
00:43 - autocomplete text view just drag and
00:46 - drop into your
00:49 - activity and then you can change the ID
00:54 - or you can even change the text inside
00:57 - this I'm going to leave this uh text as
01:01 - empty and uh I'm going to leave this ID
01:04 - as it is okay and if you want you can
01:08 - just change the property of this
01:10 - autocomplete text view uh as a layout
01:14 - width I will uh change it to match
01:18 - parent okay so that it fills the parent
01:23 - right so just change the width uh layout
01:27 - width to match parent and it will be
01:29 - resized
01:30 - now what we are going to do is we are
01:32 - going to go to our main activity. Java
01:36 - folder here of f Java file here and in
01:39 - here first of all we will Define
01:42 - autocomplete text view instance so just
01:47 - write
01:50 - auto complete text View and then just
01:55 - give give the name of this variable I
01:58 - will name it as
02:02 - AC text view for example and then for
02:10 - showing some list inside this
02:12 - autocomplete text view uh for the list
02:15 - of suggestion what you can do is you can
02:18 - define a string array so I will Define a
02:22 - string array and for example uh we want
02:26 - to uh enter some country name
02:30 - inside this text View and we want some
02:33 - suggestions okay so depending upon the
02:36 - characters we insert in this uh text
02:39 - view uh we want uh to match them to the
02:44 - country name characters and then give us
02:47 - the suggestion okay so I will name my
02:50 - variable as and I will initialize this
02:54 - string
02:56 - array by some values so I'm not going to
02:59 - take Pi uh every country uh name just
03:03 - some country names which start from a
03:08 - okay uh you can extend this array uh by
03:11 - taking you know each and every country
03:14 - name or array of your choice uh and then
03:18 - what we are going to do is we are going
03:20 - to take this uh Auto control text View
03:25 - and we will just find the ID of uh the
03:28 - autoc control text you from our activity
03:31 - main.xml
03:42 - now what we are going to do is first of
03:45 - all we need to create an adopter or
03:50 - array adopter which we can uh you know
03:54 - uh set to this autoc complete text view
03:58 - so let's declare
04:00 - this array adopter variable array
04:04 - adopter adopter is equal to
04:08 - new array adopter and this takes three
04:11 - argument first is the context second is
04:16 - the style so we will take the style from
04:26 - Android Android Dot
04:31 - r
04:33 - dot
04:37 - layout
04:46 - dot simple uh dialogue item okay and
04:51 - then the third argument we will pass it
04:55 - as our array string array
05:00 - and now once our adopter is created or
05:03 - adopter instance is created we just need
05:06 - to set two things one is we just need to
05:11 - set so just take your array adopter
05:16 - instance from here
05:19 - dot
05:23 - set
05:25 - threshold and what this threshold does
05:28 - is it uh you know it takes an argument
05:31 - which is an integer so for example we
05:35 - give argument as one so it will wait
05:39 - your arrow array adopter text view will
05:41 - wait for one character to show the hints
05:47 - right if we uh enter here two then your
05:52 - array adopter text view will uh wait for
05:55 - two characters to be entered and then it
05:57 - will show the suggestion or hints okay
06:00 - so it depends upon you how many
06:02 - characters you want to enter uh to get
06:07 - the suggestions okay and the second uh
06:12 - thing is we just need to set this
06:14 - adopter so just
06:18 - uh use your use this
06:20 - variable uh text view aut to complete
06:24 - text view. set adopter and we will set
06:26 - the same adopter which we have created
06:28 - here
06:30 - okay so this is the code now we are
06:33 - going to just run our program so now our
06:37 - app is running and we just need to check
06:40 - whether it works or not so let's uh
06:44 - check so what I'm going to do is I'm
06:47 - going to enter some uh country name with
06:50 - start from a for example a and it shows
06:54 - me this hint so because we have set here
06:59 - set threshold as one so we will get the
07:02 - suggestion whenever we enter our first
07:05 - character like this okay and for example
07:09 - I want to search a I get the two country
07:14 - suggestion argentinia Argentina and
07:18 - armania for example I want to search for
07:23 - Au it gives me two
07:26 - options or I can search for a z it gives
07:31 - me one option so in this way you can uh
07:35 - create a autocomplete text View and you
07:38 - know you can provide uh the hints um
07:41 - according to your array and in this way
07:44 - you can use auto complete text view in
07:48 - Android so I hope you have enjoyed this

07:52 - and bye
