00:00 - now in this video we will be talking
00:01 - about some basic and the important
00:03 - concept that is the local variable and
00:05 - the global variable okay so actually we
00:07 - have already covered the function so
00:09 - that is very important to know about the
00:11 - concept of local variable in the global
00:12 - variable
00:14 - so let me create the file with the name
00:16 - L where and the g where
00:19 - dot sh okay and I'll just add the
00:21 - shebang here bin bash okay now we are
00:25 - good to go so I will start with the
00:27 - basic definition of the local variables
00:29 - so if you like I will just write local
00:33 - variable so we can Define the local
00:35 - variable as the
00:37 - a variable which is uh which is sorry uh
00:44 - which is declared inside of function is
00:49 - called as local variable okay sorry for
00:54 - mistakes
00:55 - okay my typing is not good so much
00:58 - that's why it is happening so so what is
01:01 - the local variable so local variable we
01:03 - can Define it as like the variable which
01:05 - is declared inside a function that is
01:07 - the local variable Okay so
01:09 - so suppose if I am creating one variable
01:12 - that is the function one okay name of
01:16 - the function is function one and I'm
01:18 - defining a variable that is a equal to
01:21 - 20 sorry 10. so in this case what is
01:24 - this so a is nothing but the local
01:27 - variable okay so if I will do equal a
01:31 - here Eco dollar a and I will just call
01:35 - this function Function One
01:38 - and let me just add certain permission
01:41 - to this file that is the 21
01:44 - clear dot slash 21
01:51 - okay so now I'll just run the script 21
01:54 - underscore
01:55 - okay so it's not uh
01:59 - okay let me just again yeah
02:02 - click the screen dot slash 21 now okay
02:05 - so here you can see we are getting the
02:07 - value as a value of a as a 10. okay so
02:10 - this is the local variable like we have
02:12 - declared this variable inside a function
02:14 - so that we can access this inside this
02:17 - function only not outside of this
02:19 - function so if you want to print like uh
02:24 - without function calling okay I will
02:27 - just print here Eco dollar a
02:30 - so let me let's see what happens so it
02:35 - will I don't think it will print
02:36 - anything
02:37 - till the screen again so here you can
02:38 - see we are not getting any kind of
02:40 - result here okay so this is happening
02:42 - because we can't access the uh local
02:45 - variable outside of the function so that
02:47 - is the thing we can get to know with
02:49 - this thing okay so I will just comment
02:52 - out of this and I will just again uh
02:55 - call this function and now I will
02:56 - discuss about with the what is the
02:58 - global variable okay
03:00 - so global
03:02 - let me just write like this Global
03:05 - variable
03:06 - okay so this is the variable which is uh
03:11 - which is declared outside
03:15 - the function okay
03:18 - like whatever the variable which is
03:20 - declared outside the function that is
03:22 - called as the global variable okay I
03:24 - hope you got the idea okay
03:26 - so let me just comment out these things
03:28 - and I will create the variable name as
03:30 - the G where Okay g where equal to 20
03:33 - okay or I can just Define the string
03:36 - like I am uh
03:39 - Global variables okay so this variable
03:43 - can be accessed from anywhere of your
03:45 - program like inside a function or
03:47 - outside the function so if I will just
03:49 - call here eco
03:51 - dollar G bar okay so here we can see the
03:55 - result as the um the global variable
03:58 - okay so here we can we are getting the
04:00 - result I am a global variable but now if
04:03 - you want to uh again Echo the same thing
04:05 - inside the function also so we can also
04:08 - get the result two times like I am a
04:10 - global variable
04:13 - so here you can see 10 and then I'm a
04:15 - global variable so you you should see
04:17 - the uh like how the function is
04:19 - executing like when you when first what
04:22 - is happening we are just printing This
04:23 - Global variable and when we and then we
04:25 - have called the function so after
04:27 - calling the Friendship we are getting
04:28 - the first it is calling this local
04:30 - variable and then it is calling this one
04:32 - G where that is the global variable okay
04:34 - so this is the simple concept of the uh
04:37 - local variable and the global variable
04:40 - uh I have discovered y because we have
04:42 - already covered the functions and this
04:44 - thing you should know about it okay so
04:46 - that's all for today guys and I hope you
04:48 - liked it and if you have any queries you
04:49 - can also in the comment section and I
04:51 - will post all these things in our GitHub
04:53 - repository okay so thank you for
04:56 - watching and I'll meet you in the next
04:57 - video thank you
