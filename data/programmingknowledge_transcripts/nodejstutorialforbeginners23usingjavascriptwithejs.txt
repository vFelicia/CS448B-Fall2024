00:01 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - node.js tutorial for beginners in the
00:04 - last video we have seen how we can use
00:07 - ejs with Express and
00:10 - nodejs now in this video I'm going to
00:13 - give you some more information about ejs
00:16 - and I'm going to show you how we can use
00:18 - some control flows uh with your EGS
00:23 - templating engine and let's see how we
00:26 - can use it for example we want to use a
00:29 - for Loop which we normally use on the
00:32 - client site uh using for Loop we can
00:35 - iterate over any array or something like
00:38 - that how we can use uh with the help of
00:41 - EGS let's see so for that I'm going to
00:45 - modify this uh data structure which we
00:48 - have so we have uh this student Json and
00:53 - earlier uh I have uh created something
00:57 - like that that it's like a key value
01:00 - pair but in a more complex application a
01:04 - student can have a name surname age or
01:09 - many other things right if you are
01:11 - querying with uh in the database it can
01:14 - have many uh you know data data columns
01:18 - and then I will uh you know try to
01:22 - emulate that thing with this uh Jon so
01:26 - what I'm going to do now is I'm going to
01:29 - just just uh modify this uh array like
01:33 - this and uh for the student ID one I'm
01:37 - going to first of all add the the
01:40 - students name here and then I'm going to
01:43 - add uh the students name so for example
01:47 - Mark and then for example let's say what
01:50 - subject he has taken so I'm going to
01:53 - just write subjects here and then this
01:56 - is going to be an array okay so array
02:00 - you can uh do with square brackets and
02:03 - let's say uh this student is of uh some
02:07 - computer class or programming class so
02:10 - he has taken uh
02:13 - C++ Java for example and let's say he
02:16 - has taken C also and same we are going
02:19 - to do with other two students so instead
02:22 - of this I'm just going to copy and paste
02:25 - this code here and here also okay and
02:30 - then the student name was Tom here and
02:33 - the student name for the third ID is for
02:37 - example John right and the programing
02:41 - language let's change the programming
02:43 - language so for example second student
02:46 - like
02:48 - C Python and let's say he likes some
02:52 - database my sqls and third for example
02:56 - he likes JavaScript and he likes likes
03:00 - uh for example
03:03 - site database and he likes see itself
03:07 - okay so we have this kind of data
03:10 - structure now for the students right now
03:13 - this we want to show on our client how
03:16 - we can do it so for that in the last
03:19 - video we have created this kind of uh
03:22 - you know render method and we have
03:24 - injected this kind of uh Json there
03:27 - right now because we have modified our
03:30 - um Json data structure so here we will
03:34 - take the student uh Json and then we
03:37 - will first of all find its ID so this
03:40 - will be this one and then name is going
03:45 - to give you the name of the student okay
03:49 - and then ID will be same and let's say
03:52 - we want to add one more field which is
03:55 - uh subjects okay so I'm just going to
03:58 - copy here and place it here and then
04:01 - subjects how we can uh extract the
04:04 - subjects let's see so I'm just going to
04:07 - just give the line break here and
04:09 - subjects will be the same as the name
04:13 - but instead of subjects instead of name
04:16 - we will just uh replace the name with
04:19 - the subject so you can uh do something
04:21 - like this now this is going to be uh
04:26 - sent as an array to the client so the
04:30 - client EGS file has to uh you know pass
04:34 - it or rate over this array and then uh
04:37 - you know show the output right so here
04:41 - what I'm going to do is I'm going to
04:43 - just add a H1 tag and uh then I'm going
04:48 - to just write here for example subjects
04:52 - and then I'm going to add a unordered
04:56 - list or ordered list uh whatever you
04:58 - want so for example examp I'm going to
05:00 - add an unordered list here so let's add
05:03 - a
05:03 - unordered list so UL for unordered list
05:08 - and then we can inject uh for example
05:12 - some JavaScript code for passing uh this
05:16 - uh subjects array right so what we are
05:19 - going to do is we are going to write the
05:23 - name of uh the array so this time the
05:27 - element name is subject we want to pass
05:30 - this uh element right so we will take
05:32 - this element subjects and then we will
05:35 - iterate over it so there are many ways
05:37 - of iterating over array in JavaScript we
05:41 - are going to just use for each for
05:43 - example okay so just write for each and
05:47 - then we will uh just uh write a callback
05:51 - function so just write uh function and
05:55 - then just write for example it item and
06:01 - then just uh we will iterate over all
06:03 - the subjects and we will print it okay
06:05 - and don't forget to give uh the ending
06:09 - bracket and the semicolon here now the
06:12 - way you uh you know show this using ejs
06:17 - is uh the same way you used in the last
06:20 - video so you use this uh starting angle
06:23 - bracket and then mod symbol but for the
06:28 - JavaScript you don't use this kind of
06:31 - equals for the code right so you just
06:34 - need to use uh for example this starting
06:38 - angle bracket and mod and in the end the
06:42 - mod and then closing angle bracket right
06:45 - and then you need to do the same here
06:48 - also with the next
06:51 - line like this okay so you don't uh need
06:55 - to use equals here whenever you are
06:58 - using for example a Java script function
07:00 - and then you can uh normally uh you know
07:04 - add uh HTML tag once again so for
07:07 - example this is a list item for us so
07:10 - I'm going to just write list item and
07:13 - then uh we are going to just print that
07:17 - item so how we we can uh print it we
07:20 - just need to print the item because uh
07:24 - this item contains our uh you know data
07:28 - for example subject right right so the
07:30 - way you do it uh using EGS you just need
07:34 - to do this angle bracket percentage
07:38 - equals as we have done in the last video
07:40 - like this right and then this would be
07:45 - the item right so all the items will be
07:48 - iterated so let's save our code and
07:50 - let's run it and let's see what's the
07:52 - result so I'm going to uh ask for the
07:56 - student one so student and then one and
07:58 - then refresh the page page so we got the
08:00 - error and let's see what the error is so
08:02 - it says syntax unexpected token then
08:07 - this curly bracket so we need to search
08:10 - for this kind of bracket and uh let's
08:13 - see where it is so in our function yeah
08:18 - so I have closed this Anonymous function
08:21 - here we don't need this extra bracket
08:24 - here because we are closing this bracket
08:27 - for this function here right and this
08:30 - curly brick is brace is with this one
08:34 - and this is the item right so there was
08:37 - a extra bracket here so that's why the
08:40 - error was coming let's refresh the page
08:44 - on again and now we see the output right
08:48 - let's see the output for student two and
08:51 - now he has different subjects right and
08:54 - let's see the output for student 3 and
08:57 - here is the different subjects right so
08:59 - in this way you can use arrays and
09:01 - JavaScript code with ejs so I hope you
