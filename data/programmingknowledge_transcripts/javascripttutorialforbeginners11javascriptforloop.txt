00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - JavaScript tutorial for beginners in
00:04 - this video we will see how to use for
00:07 - loop in Java Script in the last video we
00:10 - have seen how to use while loop and
00:12 - do-while loop in JavaScript so for loop
00:16 - is also a kind of loop which you can use
00:20 - to execute your piece of code again and
00:24 - again right so let's see what is the
00:28 - basic syntax of for loop and then we
00:32 - will see why for loop is convenient and
00:35 - how it's used okay so in here you just
00:40 - need to use a for keyword and inside
00:43 - these round brackets comes three
00:46 - statements which I'm going to tell you
00:49 - in a moment and then in the curly braces
00:52 - comes your code okay now in here comes
00:57 - three statements which are separated by
01:01 - these semicolons right the first
01:04 - statement which comes here is the
01:07 - initialization of a variable so if you
01:12 - remember in the last video when we have
01:14 - seen this while loop we have initialized
01:17 - the value of a is equal to zero here
01:20 - right at the top and for loop allows you
01:25 - to initialize your variables inside this
01:29 - bracket okay so for example you want to
01:33 - initialize a instead of here you want to
01:38 - initialize it here then you can do it
01:41 - with the help of for loop right then
01:45 - second statement comes here is the
01:48 - condition which is same as this
01:52 - condition which you have given in the
01:54 - while loop so second statement is the
01:56 - condition which you want to satisfy okay
01:59 - and third statement is the increment or
02:04 - decrement with whatever you want so for
02:07 - example in the while loop we have to do
02:10 - this increment inside the while loop
02:13 - but in the for-loop it allows you to
02:16 - increment this value of a for example in
02:20 - these bracket itself okay so the for
02:25 - loop allows you to initialize your
02:27 - variable compare your variable and
02:31 - increment your variable in a single line
02:34 - right so this is really convenient when
02:37 - you want to iterate over some array for
02:39 - example right and let's say we want to
02:43 - just print the same result here okay and
02:46 - I will just comment this code for the
02:50 - while loop and save my code and refresh
02:54 - my webpage and it prints 0 to 10 right
02:59 - so in a lesser number of lines we have
03:03 - performed the same functionality as we
03:06 - have done in the while loop okay so this
03:09 - you can do here as a third statement
03:12 - this comparison you can do here as a
03:15 - second statement and this initialization
03:17 - you can do here as a first statement
03:21 - okay now it's not necessary that you
03:24 - need to initialize something here you
03:27 - can initialize the value of a here and
03:30 - it's totally fine and you can leave this
03:34 - first statement as blank also and when
03:37 - you refresh your page the result will be
03:39 - same okay or you can initialize the
03:42 - value of result so for example you want
03:44 - to initialize the value of result
03:47 - instead of a you can just do something
03:50 - like this here so you initialize the
03:55 - value of result here and then you just
03:58 - refresh your webpage and the result will
04:02 - be same also okay so you can initialize
04:05 - the value of a here and for example you
04:09 - want to initialize the value of result
04:11 - also you can do with a comma separator
04:14 - okay so you initialized a comma
04:18 - initialize the second value and then
04:21 - after the semicolon comes your condition
04:24 - so if you want to initialize multiple
04:26 - values
04:27 - you can do it separated by comma okay so
04:32 - the save your code and refresh it and
04:34 - result is same now for example I have an
04:38 - array called names here and I want to
04:43 - print the value of all the array one by
04:46 - one what I can do here is I can leave
04:49 - this a as it is and result also as a
04:53 - test so initialization is fine here but
04:56 - as a condition where we can give here a
05:00 - is less than the length of names so
05:05 - names dot length okay and this will give
05:09 - you the slant of this array right and
05:12 - then you can increment the value by one
05:16 - and in here if you want to print the
05:18 - names what we can do here is we can use
05:22 - the index property of array using this a
05:26 - so just write a and in the square
05:29 - bracket you just pass a okay because a
05:33 - is initially 0 and it will increment one
05:36 - by one in the for loop so it will
05:39 - iterate over each index one by one and
05:43 - it will print the names right so save
05:46 - your code and refresh our page and you
05:49 - can see all the names are printed one by
05:51 - one here now there is one more alternate
05:54 - way of using for loop and that's called
05:57 - for in loop and the syntax of that loop
06:01 - is you just use keyword for and then you
06:06 - use your variable for example you have
06:09 - declared a variable var X for example
06:13 - right and then you just transfer here X
06:18 - and then in and then you can iterate
06:21 - over some object now object in
06:24 - JavaScript looks something like this so
06:27 - it will look something like a jason
06:30 - which has associative property so for
06:33 - example i declare an object called
06:35 - student and it has some properties like
06:38 - name surname and
06:40 - age and we can give the value of name
06:44 - something like this surname something
06:47 - like this and it's something like this
06:49 - in the curly braces okay so this is
06:52 - called an object in JavaScript so you
06:55 - can iterate over this student object
06:58 - something like this so you just write X
07:02 - in student and what it will do is it
07:06 - will iterate over every element in this
07:11 - object for a first name and then second
07:14 - surname and third age and then it will
07:17 - transfer the value in here as X okay and
07:21 - then you can do the same so I will just
07:25 - pass this result here and I'm going to
07:27 - comment this for loop for now and what
07:31 - I'm going to do is I'm going to just
07:33 - take the student and pass it here and
07:35 - don't forget to give the value of X here
07:39 - inside the square brackets and save your
07:41 - code and refresh your webpage and now it
07:44 - gives the name surname and age as the
07:48 - value right so in here what you are
07:50 - doing you are iterating over the object
07:53 - and this will give you the value of each
07:58 - object so first it will give you the
08:00 - value of name then it will give you the
08:02 - value of surname and then it will give
08:04 - you the value of the age okay so in this
08:08 - way you can use for loop in JavaScript I
