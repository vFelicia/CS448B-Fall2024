00:01 - hello and welcome back to the another
00:02 - video of the Java tutorial Series so
00:04 - today we are looking the solution to the
00:07 - exercise number two that I have given in
00:09 - the previous videos
00:10 - okay so let's just get started so first
00:13 - of all uh I'll be covering first three
00:15 - questions in this video and other two
00:18 - other two questions will be covered in
00:20 - the upcoming videos because the video
00:22 - link should it should be it increased if
00:24 - I cover all those questions in one one
00:26 - video okay
00:27 - okay so let's just get started so what
00:30 - is our first problem uh write a program
00:32 - to calculate the sum of first 10 natural
00:34 - numbers okay so I hope you know what is
00:37 - natural numbers natural numbers uh start
00:39 - from one okay so let me just get into my
00:43 - IDE and
00:46 - and inside my SRC folder I will create
00:49 - one Java class and I will name it as
00:53 - exercise to
00:56 - Solutions
01:00 - okay
01:01 - so let me just increase the font size
01:04 - for you guys
01:07 - okay and inside this I will
01:10 - write my main method okay
01:13 - okay so I have to print the sum of the
01:17 - natural number first 10 natural number
01:19 - okay so for that I will be requiring one
01:22 - variable which will hold my sum okay and
01:27 - again
01:29 - one for Loop is there int
01:32 - I is equals to 1. so I hope you are
01:35 - getting why I have written one here
01:37 - because the natural uh natural number
01:39 - starts from 1 so that's why I have
01:42 - written here I is less than equals to 10
01:47 - less than equals is there because we
01:49 - have to iterate for the value 10 also
01:52 - okay and since our value as value is 1
01:54 - also there
01:56 - and each time I will be incrementing the
01:58 - value of I okay so inside my for loop I
02:00 - will be doing here
02:03 - sum plus is equals to
02:06 - I so at this point uh I am updating my
02:09 - sums value okay so what does it means
02:13 - plus is equals to is nothing but this
02:15 - let me just make it simple for you so
02:17 - that you can understand better okay sum
02:20 - plus I
02:22 - so at line number six and line number
02:26 - five are the same it just uh we write a
02:29 - Sim at a simpler manner okay so I like
02:33 - that first one okay uh so here we are
02:37 - just updating the sums value with the
02:39 - previous sums Value Plus current I is
02:41 - value okay
02:42 - and after my Loop I will just print
02:47 - my value of the sum that is the sum of
02:51 - the first
02:52 - 10 natural numbers okay
02:55 - now let me just concat with
02:58 - some variable okay
03:00 - so I hope this will work let me just run
03:04 - this
03:06 - I hope you guys are liking this tutorial
03:09 - series
03:10 - okay so here the here you can see the
03:13 - sum is 55 because when you add 1 plus 2
03:17 - plus 3 plus 4 plus 5 up to 10 the sum
03:21 - will be 55 okay so that is about the
03:24 - first question so let's just move on to
03:27 - the second question what is write a
03:30 - program that prompts the user to give a
03:33 - positive integer and it should print the
03:35 - multiplication table of that number okay
03:39 - so
03:40 - let me go inside my IDE and I will
03:44 - comment this okay so let me just give it
03:49 - a comment over here so that you guys can
03:51 - understand
03:53 - first
03:55 - okay first
03:57 - and I will comment this also and inside
04:00 - below this
04:02 - I will create another commander in a
04:05 - second so this is the solution for the
04:07 - second one
04:08 - so here I require one
04:11 - input from the user so that's why I have
04:14 - to
04:15 - create a object of the scanner class
04:18 - I hope you guys know the scanner class
04:22 - system
04:23 - sorry system.in
04:27 - okay
04:28 - so here you can see I have not imported
04:31 - the scanner class so that is the good
04:34 - thing about the IntelliJ IDE whichever
04:36 - class you use here it will automatically
04:39 - import that class inside the import
04:42 - statement at line number one UK you guys
04:45 - can see okay and uh I will require one a
04:48 - variable called num which is rough type
04:51 - integer and then in the next line I will
04:54 - just print enter a positive number
04:57 - because I want a user to enter a number
05:01 - enter any
05:05 - positive number
05:09 - okay
05:10 - and below this
05:12 - uh I will simply write
05:15 - num is equal to
05:17 - SC dot next int
05:22 - okay
05:23 - so now uh when I get input from the user
05:27 - I just have to generate the
05:29 - multiplication table of that number okay
05:31 - so for that I will be printing oops let
05:34 - me just create yes
05:36 - let me just write multiplication
05:39 - multiplication
05:43 - table of
05:50 - num okay
05:52 - So Below this I will be generating the
05:53 - multiplication table for that number I
05:56 - mean user icon so I will be using for
05:58 - Loop for INT I is equals to 1
06:03 - I is less than equals to 10.
06:07 - because we have to generate uh for
06:09 - example for two stable we have to
06:10 - generate two two tens are 20. up to that
06:14 - we have to change it you can generate
06:17 - how much you want okay
06:20 - and inside this I will be printing
06:24 - the num
06:28 - Plus
06:30 - one sign which represent multiplication
06:34 - and I will again concatenate it with
06:37 - value of I
06:40 - and then again I will
06:43 - concatenate it with
06:46 - equal to sine
06:48 - and again I will write 1
06:51 - operation over here which is
06:54 - my num
06:56 - multiplied by I
07:00 - okay so I hope you guys are getting this
07:03 - line number 20 what I have done here I
07:05 - have I first print the number that is
07:08 - the input given input by the user so at
07:10 - this line I will just show you what will
07:13 - be uh so
07:14 - if the user has given input as two so at
07:18 - this point 2 will get printed on the
07:19 - screen and then
07:21 - multiplication sign will be get printed
07:23 - and what is whatever the value of the I
07:26 - will be there let's suppose for the
07:28 - first time if the loop is incrementing
07:30 - then the value of the I is 1. and again
07:33 - one equals to sign will be there and
07:35 - after equal to sine the operation there
07:38 - is nothing to 2 num into I that is 2
07:40 - into 1 is 2 will be get printed likewise
07:43 - the whole table of the two will get
07:45 - printed on the console each time uh the
07:48 - loop get increment is value get
07:49 - incremented by 1 up to 10 okay
07:52 - so let me just run this I hope this will
07:55 - work
07:59 - enter a positive number let's suppose if
08:01 - I enter 2 so here you can see two and
08:04 - the two two two by four two two three
08:06 - two three the six likewise hold the two
08:09 - stable get rendered on the screen Okay
08:10 - so
08:15 - okay sorry for the interruption guys uh
08:18 - so our third question is write a program
08:20 - to find the factorial value of a number
08:22 - entered by the uh enter through the
08:24 - keyboard okay so you have to create
08:28 - factorial of the number okay
08:31 - not create we have to generate okay so I
08:33 - will just comment this out
08:35 - and I will write another comment as
08:38 - third third means the third solution for
08:40 - the third question okay so we have to
08:43 - generate a factorial of that number okay
08:45 - so what is factorial for factor is
08:47 - nothing but the
08:48 - here I can give you one example if I
08:50 - want to find the Fifth Fifth five
08:53 - factorial then it will be equals to the
08:57 - it will be equals to the
09:00 - 5
09:01 - into 4 into
09:03 - 3 into 2 into 1 okay so to find this uh
09:10 - I again I require one input from the
09:14 - user so I will just comment this comment
09:16 - of this so that I can receive input from
09:19 - the user
09:20 - and now I require one variable name as
09:24 - int num which will hold that number
09:27 - actually
09:29 - and again I will require another
09:32 - variable name as fact
09:36 - its current value is 1. okay and I will
09:39 - just print it out
09:42 - enter
09:46 - uh
09:48 - number
09:51 - and here I will just
09:54 - right sorry
09:57 - num is equals to
10:00 - sa dot next int
10:04 - okay and I will write one for Loop
10:08 - and whose value will be
10:11 - uh I is equals to one
10:16 - each time I will be doing I let's
10:19 - checking I less than equals to num
10:22 - and I am doing I plus plus okay
10:26 - and inside this I will be doing fact
10:31 - multiplied is equals to
10:34 - I
10:35 - so I hope you guys are getting this at
10:38 - this point we are just getting the value
10:40 - of the I and it multiplying it with the
10:43 - previous value of the fact that is the
10:45 - fact variable and the fact variable uh
10:47 - initial value is 1 and when this Loop
10:51 - kill term gets terminated the value
10:53 - inside fact distort it is the factorial
10:57 - of that number okay so now
11:00 - I will simply print
11:04 - let me just write
11:07 - fact to real
11:11 - it's
11:13 - and I will contact it with
11:16 - fact
11:18 - okay so I hope it this will run if I
11:21 - click on execute
11:23 - it was it it was asking for a number
11:26 - let's suppose I write five
11:29 - and factorial is 120 because 5 into 4
11:32 - into 3 into 2 into 1 is 120.
11:35 - so I hope you you guys can solve these
11:40 - questions first second and third and in
11:41 - our upcoming videos we will be looking
11:43 - into the solution for the fourth and
11:45 - fifth question okay thank you guys for
11:48 - watching this video
