00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video and
00:02 - by them to troll for beginners in this
00:04 - video I'm going to show you how to
00:05 - install Python 3 on your Windows 10
00:08 - operating system so let's get started so
00:10 - first of all open your favorite browser
00:12 - on your Windows 10 operating system and
00:14 - then search for Python and the first
00:16 - link which will appear here will be from
00:18 - python dot o-r-g so we are going to
00:20 - click on that link and once this Python
00:22 - Wadi website is open you just need to
00:24 - scroll down a little until you see this
00:26 - downloads section and you can see at the
00:30 - time of making this video python 3.7.0
00:33 - is the latest version of python
00:35 - available so we are going to click on
00:37 - this link which says python 3.7.0 and
00:40 - you will be redirected to this page
00:42 - which says python 3.7.0 and now i'm
00:45 - going to scroll down until i see the
00:48 - files here and you will see there are
00:50 - various kinds of installer available
00:52 - here we are going to install the python
00:54 - using the executable installer so we are
00:56 - going to choose this option which says
00:58 - windows x86 - 64 executable installer
01:02 - and now I will wait for this executable
01:05 - to be downloaded and once this
01:06 - executable is downloaded you just need
01:08 - to click on this Exe file and I'm going
01:11 - to minimize the browser here so you can
01:13 - see pythons 3.7.0 setup window has been
01:16 - started and on the first window you will
01:19 - see two options here one is Install Now
01:22 - and other is customized installation so
01:25 - what we are going to choose is this
01:28 - option which says customize installation
01:30 - because when you choose this Install Now
01:32 - option Python will be installed at this
01:36 - path which I don't want to use you can
01:39 - see it's a long path which I don't want
01:42 - to remember so I will use this option
01:45 - which says customize installation and I
01:47 - will also check this option which says
01:48 - add Python 3.7 to path so now let's
01:52 - click on customize installation and next
01:54 - you will see this optional feature
01:56 - window and you can see there are some
01:59 - optional feature which this Python
02:01 - installer will install for example
02:03 - documentation tip it will install which
02:06 - is a Python package manager idle IDE
02:09 - Python test suit and other feature it's
02:12 - going to install so I'm going to
02:13 - leave everything is default and then I'm
02:15 - going to click Next and now this next
02:17 - window will open which says advanced
02:20 - option here I'm going to check this
02:22 - option which says install for all users
02:24 - and I'm going to leave other checkboxes
02:28 - as checked and then you will see this
02:30 - section here which says customize
02:31 - install location so I want to install
02:34 - Python on my C directory so what I'm
02:36 - going to do is I'm going to open the
02:37 - Windows Explorer and I'm going to go to
02:40 - the C directory here and once the C
02:43 - directory is open I'm going to right
02:45 - click here and I'm going to create a new
02:47 - directory and I'm going to name this our
02:49 - directory as Python and then I'm going
02:51 - to press enter and this part I'm going
02:54 - to give here in the customize install
02:57 - location so I'm going to just give this
02:59 - part which says C colon slash Python and
03:03 - then backslash Python 3 7 3 7 here means
03:08 - that we are going to install 3.7 version
03:10 - of Python
03:11 - so now python will be installed at this
03:13 - location on my computer and then i'm
03:16 - going to click on the install button
03:17 - here and then you will see the
03:18 - installation will start and it will be
03:20 - finished in a few seconds so just wait
03:22 - for the installation to complete and
03:24 - after some time i can see this message
03:26 - which say setup was successful so i'm
03:28 - going to click on this close button
03:29 - which is going to close this installer
03:31 - so now in order to check whether python
03:33 - is installed on our Windows operating
03:35 - system or not we are going to search for
03:37 - Python here and you will see few options
03:40 - here one is this Python 3.7 terminal
03:44 - other is idle IDE so first of all we are
03:48 - going to click on this option which says
03:50 - Python 3.7 64-bit which is going to open
03:53 - this kind of terminal so this is a
03:56 - python terminal and here we can for
03:59 - example print something so i'm going to
04:01 - just write print and in the parenthesis
04:03 - and in between the double quotes I can
04:05 - just write hello world and then press
04:09 - ENTER which is going to in return print
04:11 - hello world
04:12 - that means python 3.7 terminal is
04:15 - working so i'm going to close this
04:17 - terminal now and once again i'm going to
04:19 - search for python here and this time i'm
04:21 - going to select this option which says
04:23 - idle ok so just select this option which
04:26 - says I do
04:27 - and in the parentheses Python 3.7 64 bit
04:30 - so this Idol is an IDE which comes with
04:33 - Python installation at the time of
04:36 - installation we have chosen this option
04:37 - to install Idol that's why we can see
04:40 - this option here and also this is an
04:42 - interactive shell so you can once again
04:44 - write a print and inside the parentheses
04:47 - you can just write for example once
04:49 - again hello world and then press ENTER
04:53 - and it's going to give you this kind of
04:55 - output here
04:56 - so now python interactive shell is
04:57 - working and idle ide is also working so
05:01 - i'm going to close this idle ide and now
05:03 - i want to check whether python is
05:05 - working using my command prompt or not
05:08 - so i'm going to right click on this
05:10 - windows button and then i'm going to
05:12 - click on command prompt and here i'm
05:15 - going to first of all write python and
05:17 - then press enter and you can see this
05:20 - python option is working now even on
05:23 - your command prompt right so here also
05:26 - you can just write print and inside the
05:29 - parenthesis you can just print hello
05:31 - world and then press enter and it prints
05:35 - hello world in return so now we have
05:37 - successfully installed Python on our
05:40 - Windows 10 operating system so from the
05:42 - next video we are going to use these
05:45 - tools in order to develop Python code so
05:49 - stay tuned and see you in the next video
