00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome back to our
00:01 - YouTube channel and welcome to this
00:03 - video so this is part 6 of PHP restful
00:06 - api tutorial series and in this video
00:10 - guys were you going to discuss how to
00:12 - create or implement a create record into
00:17 - our page previous API project so as a
00:20 - sort of review guys in the previous
00:22 - video we also have implemented the
00:25 - reading of single record coming from our
00:28 - database so we have laid out the
00:31 - function read underscore single and of
00:34 - course we created a file read single dot
00:37 - PHP and then we're querying the record
00:40 - by using its ID and of course returning
00:44 - all the data related to that particular
00:46 - ID and now let's continue working on
00:51 - with our post dot PHP file and just
00:54 - below the read underscore single
00:56 - function we're going to create another
00:58 - function here so the name of this
01:01 - particular function will be public
01:07 - function and then create okay so in this
01:12 - particular function we're going to add
01:17 - some lines in order for us to create
01:21 - another or create a record by using our
01:26 - API project so for us to do that let's
01:31 - go ahead and build first our query so
01:36 - here we need to create our good query
01:40 - okay and that'll the query and of course
01:44 - the actual query of our function which
01:48 - will be insert because we're trying to
01:50 - create a record into our database and of
01:56 - course we'll just concatenate our table
01:59 - name here so this and then the table
02:07 - this particular class so I think it's
02:11 - yeah table okay that should be table and
02:17 - right after that is another string set
02:24 - title equals placeholder title okay and
02:31 - then body equals the placeholder of the
02:39 - body of a post okay another one for our
02:44 - author and the placeholder for our
02:47 - author and then of course the category
02:51 - ID so category ID and then the
02:58 - placeholder for our category ID hey so
03:03 - and then we need to prepare our
03:05 - statement here below so prepare
03:08 - statement so that will be s dmt and
03:13 - using the connection that we have so
03:17 - that will be connection and then prepare
03:24 - and of course the query a and then we
03:33 - need to clean the data next because the
03:39 - information that will be saved into our
03:42 - database is coming from the user or the
03:45 - input of the user or the requests coming
03:48 - from our user so that's why we need to
03:50 - clean the data clean data so for our
03:56 - title we need to set the title equals to
04:01 - HTML special special chars okay and then
04:07 - strip tags okay and then this that or
04:16 - this and then the attribute title
04:20 - so this line it only means that we just
04:24 - want to remove all the unwanted problems
04:29 - with our data so so this will be for our
04:35 - body okay this will be for the author
04:40 - okay and of course this will be for our
04:44 - category diagur e ID okay there you go
04:49 - so we just want to make sure that it
04:52 - will be the same also for this
04:55 - particular part so category underscore
04:57 - ID and yes we just need to make sure to
05:03 - indent this or to align this to make our
05:07 - code read the ball okay and then right
05:12 - after that one we need to bind the
05:14 - parameter or the params for our tight a
05:20 - placeholder for a title body author and
05:23 - category ID so this part right here will
05:26 - be binding of parameters
05:30 - okay so STM P and then vine param
05:37 - specifying the placeholder over it of
05:41 - our title and then the actual value of
05:44 - our item so there you go and then we'll
05:48 - just copy this one for the other
05:50 - attributes as well for our category ID
05:56 - for our author and of course for our
06:00 - body or body of the post and of course
06:03 - we need to change also D placeholder for
06:06 - this this and so with this category ID
06:13 - okay so after that one we need to
06:20 - execute the query of course after
06:23 - binding all the bottoms cleaning the
06:25 - data so the last part will be executing
06:28 - or execute the query so all we have to
06:32 - do is
06:34 - called the SDM T and then execute okay
06:40 - and then if the execution of this
06:45 - particular query is successful then all
06:48 - we have to do is return through okay
06:51 - otherwise we print an error here print
06:57 - error if something goes wrong so that
07:04 - will be print F a print F and then error
07:12 - will be percent s okay
07:21 - and the error our statement or the query
07:30 - that we have and then return false
07:35 - something like that
07:37 - Hey so basically guys we only prepared
07:40 - our public function or public function
07:44 - create and this will be used for our
07:48 - files especially in our API so in under
07:53 - or API directory we need to create
07:56 - another file so that will be great so
08:03 - let's go ahead and create a new file and
08:06 - then
08:07 - new file and then we need to say here
08:11 - create that PHP so in our create that
08:14 - page we guys we just want to add some
08:20 - headers also the same with ours reading
08:23 - I mean the read that page P a so we
08:28 - might as well copy all this all this
08:31 - code right here and then paste it here
08:33 - and then we just need to remove okay
08:41 - starting from here and then guys as I've
08:45 - said we need to add some other either
08:47 - either we need to add some other headers
08:50 - here so we have access control allow
08:54 - region and we have content type so
08:57 - another one header is access control
09:03 - access control and then allow methods
09:12 - okay so this is save or create query or
09:20 - we need to create a record to our
09:22 - database so this will be a post method
09:24 - meaning the request the request should
09:27 - have data for us to save into our
09:31 - database and then we also have to add
09:35 - another header year so this will be
09:41 - access and then control and then allow
09:48 - headers so basically we're just
09:51 - specifying here what are the header is
09:53 - that I needed so that will be this one
09:59 - we just need to duplicate this okay and
10:08 - content type also okay
10:14 - another thing is the access control
10:19 - alone methods okay and also the
10:27 - authorization okay so basically we're
10:31 - not going to touch authorization in this
10:34 - particular series but for the sake of
10:36 - this tutorial we're going to add a
10:37 - translation there so maybe in the future
10:40 - you want to implement authorization for
10:44 - your PHP API and the last one will be
10:48 - the X requested twit okay so these are
10:54 - all the headers that are required or
10:57 - specified as the allowed headers so I
11:01 - think guys this is a good point to stop
11:03 - our tutorial because this is rather long
11:05 - and in the next video we're going to
11:07 - continue working on with our create that
11:10 - PHP file and we should be able to create
11:14 - a record by specifying a post method and
11:18 - then we can save that into our database
11:21 - so thank you for watching and see you in
11:22 - the next video
