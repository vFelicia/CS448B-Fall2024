00:04 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:06 - shell scripting tutorial for beginners
00:08 - in the last video we have seen how to
00:10 - use for loop in shell scripting now in
00:14 - this video we will see how we can use a
00:16 - for loop with some command and we will
00:18 - see some examples to understand this
00:21 - better so this is the basic syntax we
00:25 - have seen in the last video so we use
00:26 - for keyboard and then command or any
00:30 - variable here and then we use the
00:33 - keyword in and then after the keyword we
00:35 - give some input in the form of some
00:38 - lists or some commands right and then we
00:42 - use do and done keyword and then we use
00:46 - some come on to you know execute the
00:51 - item value right which is here okay so
00:55 - let's see how we can use commands here
00:58 - so we can give our list of commands in
01:01 - order to execute them so for example I
01:04 - can give LS here and then I can give the
01:09 - PWD for present working directory and
01:13 - for example I give the date command to
01:16 - know the date right so this is the list
01:18 - of command and these commands will be
01:21 - executed one by one so first of all the
01:25 - LS command will be executed and then the
01:28 - PWD command will be executed and then
01:31 - the date command will be executed right
01:33 - so let's see how this works so what I'm
01:37 - going to do is I am going to echo for
01:40 - example online and then I'm going to
01:45 - print the name of the command
01:48 - so let's print the name of the command
01:51 - first and then we are going to execute
01:54 - the command itself so how we can execute
01:57 - the command itself we can execute it
02:00 - without the echo command so echo command
02:03 - is going to give you the name of the
02:06 - command and then this is going to
02:09 - actually execute that command okay so
02:14 - let's run the script and let's see what
02:16 - happens
02:16 - so I'm going to run my script and this
02:19 - is the output so the LS command is
02:22 - giving us all these LS command values
02:26 - right and then the PWD command is going
02:29 - to give us this output and the date
02:31 - command has given us this output right
02:34 - so we can execute a number of commands
02:38 - like this and they will be executed one
02:41 - by one using this method right now let's
02:45 - take some practical example also so for
02:49 - example I'm in my home folder right now
02:52 - and then I want to print all the
02:55 - directories which are there in my home
02:57 - folder for example right so let me do LS
03:01 - minus a here and I can see there are
03:05 - some directories here and I want to
03:08 - print all the directories which are
03:09 - there in this folder so I'm going to
03:12 - clear the terminal first of all and then
03:14 - let's write the code so here I can use
03:18 - Astrix and Astrix means here that I want
03:24 - to iterate over each and every file or
03:27 - directory in this directory which I am
03:31 - currently in right
03:32 - so as strix is a wild-card and hopefully
03:35 - you know how it works and then what I'm
03:38 - going to do is instead of this code in
03:41 - the do and done keyword we will first of
03:45 - all use the if statement and we will
03:50 - evaluate the value of command and
03:53 - command is not appropriate keyword here
03:56 - for example I will say item here right
03:59 - so whatever item is iterated or whatever
04:03 - item we have using this Asterix keyword
04:07 - then we will evaluate if it's a
04:09 - directory or not and if it's a directory
04:12 - then we will print it so we will use - D
04:15 - for this and then the name of the item
04:19 - right and then we use the keyword then
04:24 - as we do with the if-else conditions and
04:29 - then fi - n
04:30 - viii right and in here we will just echo
04:34 - this directory name okay so just right
04:39 - echo and then the name of the item so
04:43 - what it's not going to do this Astrix
04:46 - command it's going to see all the items
04:50 - which are there in this directory it can
04:53 - be file or it can be a directory name
04:55 - and then we are checking using this code
04:59 - whether this is a directory or a file
05:03 - and if it's a directory then we will
05:06 - print the name of it okay so let's run
05:09 - the script and let's see what happens
05:10 - and we run the script and you can see
05:14 - it's giving us all the directory names
05:17 - so this is the name of the directory
05:19 - name of the directory name of the
05:21 - directory and then all the name of the
05:24 - directories right now in this output we
05:28 - can also see this warning or error also
05:31 - here and let's see why this error is
05:34 - coming so I'm going to open this
05:37 - directory which is printing this output
05:41 - and I can see there is a file name and
05:44 - this file name has you know the keywords
05:49 - then this file name has a qrt function
05:52 - is da so there are four keywords
05:55 - separated by spaces here right and now
05:59 - our script is confused that these names
06:02 - are separate or these names is the name
06:06 - of one file so for example I will delete
06:09 - this file name and let's run the script
06:13 - once again so let me run it and now it
06:16 - prints all the directories like this
06:19 - okay so let me clear the terminal and
06:22 - for example I just want to print all the
06:25 - files so instead of using - tea I can
06:27 - use - f or choosing all the files and
06:31 - I'm going to run the script once again
06:33 - and now it prints all the files which
06:36 - are there in this directories okay so in
06:39 - this way we can use commands with for
06:41 - loop I hope you enjoyed this video
06:43 - please read comments
06:44 - and bye for now
