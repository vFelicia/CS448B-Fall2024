00:01 - okay so welcome back guys to the another
00:03 - video of the Java tutorial Series so
00:05 - today we are we are starting with our
00:07 - very first concept of the
00:08 - object-oriented programming languages
00:11 - that is objects and classes so in this
00:14 - video we will be covering objects and
00:15 - classes
00:16 - so let's just get started so first of
00:20 - all I'm covering objects then I will
00:22 - cover uh class okay
00:26 - so what is object an object is an entity
00:28 - that hasn't State a behavior is known as
00:31 - object for example chair bike marker pen
00:34 - everything you see surrounding you is an
00:36 - object in a real world entity right it
00:39 - can be physical or theological okay the
00:42 - example of an intangible object is a
00:44 - banking system that we have done project
00:46 - on it as if you have watched or
00:49 - following the series okay so what are
00:52 - the characteristics of the object a
00:54 - state a state represent represents the
00:56 - data of an object and the behavior
00:58 - Behavior represents the behavior of an
01:01 - uh object such as deposit withdraw this
01:04 - is related to the banking application
01:06 - that project we have done uh in our
01:08 - previous videos okay and identity it is
01:11 - used internally by the jvm to identify
01:14 - each object uniquely so this is just
01:17 - identity is the just a jvm part that it
01:19 - handles to identify the each object uh
01:22 - uniquely in Java okay
01:24 - uh so first we will see the theoretical
01:28 - part of the object in the class then we
01:30 - will get into get into our IDE and see
01:33 - how class and objects are declared
01:36 - inside the code okay so what is the
01:38 - class a class is a group of objects a
01:41 - Fields methods Constructors blocks or
01:44 - nested classes and interfaces these all
01:47 - kinds of methods Constructors that you
01:49 - wrote in uh in Java you put it inside a
01:52 - class and a class holds all these fields
01:55 - okay and a class it is a template or a
01:59 - blueprint from which objects are created
02:01 - and it is a logical entity and it can it
02:04 - can't be physical okay so I will explain
02:06 - you one by one what what I have to uh
02:10 - speak right now okay so let me just open
02:12 - my IDE
02:18 - a by the way guys if you are enjoying
02:20 - this series so please like share and
02:22 - subscribe to the channel also okay
02:25 - okay
02:26 - wait hey this is the code of the project
02:30 - which you have which we have done
02:32 - previously okay if you have not watched
02:34 - this video go and watch it
02:36 - okay so here let me just create a new
02:40 - Java class name
02:43 - um what should I name this
02:45 - classes
02:48 - and
02:51 - objects okay
02:54 - okay let me just increase the font size
02:56 - and let me just get my main method
03:01 - okay so here you can see one one class
03:05 - is declared okay public class classes
03:08 - and objects okay so as I have taught you
03:11 - over here you know in my notes okay it
03:14 - holds methods Constructors blocks and
03:17 - nested classes so right now this class
03:20 - is holding one main method main is a
03:24 - method method name okay and what what
03:25 - here here we have written it is holding
03:28 - method Constructor okay class is nothing
03:30 - but the
03:31 - one place where you in in which you have
03:34 - writing methods all those uh interfaces
03:37 - and code okay and here I can do whatever
03:42 - I want like just I will print one
03:45 - statement
03:48 - and low
03:49 - world and if I click here
03:54 - okay so it it will get that class and it
03:58 - will run that class okay just wait
04:02 - let me run this class
04:06 - okay so here you can see hello world is
04:09 - getting printed on the console what
04:10 - internally Java does is our class is
04:13 - this classes and objects okay dot Java
04:17 - this this is our file and whenever I
04:20 - click on the Run button it converts that
04:22 - dot Java file this file into a DOT class
04:25 - file the dot class file is then again
04:27 - used by the jvm and it uh it is
04:31 - converted uh into the byte code and
04:33 - which is the machine understandable code
04:35 - and our code get executed in the console
04:37 - okay so this is the behind the scene how
04:40 - this works okay and now I will give you
04:44 - an example of the object also so that
04:47 - you can understand clearly uh instead of
04:50 - writing here I will wait
04:52 - okay forgot let me just create one new
04:55 - class for you so that you can understand
04:57 - clearly
05:00 - okay uh so this this is our class and
05:05 - here
05:06 - wait let me just create one method okay
05:10 - uh
05:12 - print
05:15 - and this method is better than accepting
05:17 - anything and this method is simply
05:19 - printing
05:23 - hello world message on the screen
05:26 - okay so I have created another class
05:29 - name objects and one method is there
05:31 - inside this class name print and this
05:34 - method is doing nothing just simply
05:35 - printing the hello world on the screen
05:36 - okay so let me just clear it out uh
05:39 - comment it out
05:40 - and how to create an object okay so this
05:43 - is one part uh listen carefully so to
05:47 - create an object you have to write the
05:49 - class name
05:51 - oops sorry objects and then you have to
05:55 - write
05:56 - the what name you are giving to an
05:59 - object okay so name can be anything like
06:02 - this anything you want you name you name
06:05 - that object okay so I will name this as
06:08 - obj1 because this is my first object so
06:12 - you can write anything okay uh so after
06:14 - that here you can see we we have also
06:16 - created uh this object during our
06:18 - project itself okay after that you have
06:22 - to write new then again the class name
06:25 - and this okay so you'll be wondering you
06:28 - know why I have not passed over
06:30 - something over here because it if you
06:32 - are following the series you you can see
06:33 - we have passed something over here
06:35 - that's because our we have created one
06:37 - Constructor of this class we will cover
06:39 - in depth quarter look at the Constructor
06:41 - in our upcoming videos also okay so now
06:43 - for till now you just understand how to
06:46 - create an object okay so this is where
06:48 - we just have to write the class name the
06:50 - object name and the new keyword is used
06:52 - to memory memory allocation of that
06:54 - object okay and after that using that
06:57 - object I can call all those methods and
06:59 - construct trade which are written inside
07:00 - this class okay so I will write obj1
07:04 - dot Sprint okay so here you can see and
07:09 - I will just click on this
07:12 - run button and here you can see again
07:16 - hello world is getting printed on the
07:17 - console I have con I have commented out
07:20 - this uh let me just clearly it again so
07:24 - that you guys can understand clearly
07:26 - okay hello well it's printed on the
07:28 - console how it is working internally
07:30 - just uh look at here one object is
07:32 - objects object is the class name we
07:35 - create an object object one we use the
07:36 - new keyword to uh allocate the memory of
07:38 - the to our object and using that object
07:41 - we have called one print method of that
07:44 - class okay one print method is here and
07:47 - uh the egg call get executed uh call
07:51 - gets over here wired print is called and
07:54 - executed and inside this we have written
07:57 - one South print statement
07:59 - that is hello world and this hello world
08:01 - is getting printed on the console the
08:03 - program execution comes here and comes
08:06 - here and Main methods gets over and our
08:08 - program gets terminated
08:10 - okay so this is pretty much about the
08:12 - classes and objects in Java so I hope
08:15 - you guys have get got some idea of the
08:16 - about the classes and objects in Java so
08:19 - in our upcoming videos we will cover uh
08:22 - I guess methods uh which is the next
08:24 - part of the object oriented programming
08:26 - language so thank you guys for watching
08:27 - this video
