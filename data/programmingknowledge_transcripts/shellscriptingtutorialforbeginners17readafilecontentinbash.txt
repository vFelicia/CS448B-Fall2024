00:01 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - shell scripting tutorial for beginners
00:04 - in this video I'm going to show you how
00:06 - we can read files using while loop now
00:10 - there are several ways of reading files
00:12 - using while loop and we are going to see
00:14 - some of them the first way of reading
00:17 - files using while loop is by using input
00:22 - redirection so we use this while loop
00:25 - skeleton and after this keyword while we
00:29 - will use the read command so just use
00:31 - read and then the variable in which we
00:34 - want to save the content of the file
00:37 - line by line okay and then what we are
00:40 - going to do is we will Echo this uh
00:43 - variable so just write Echo and uh
00:47 - dollar P which is this variable itself
00:50 - and then if you know file redirection we
00:53 - use uh a angle bracket here so we are
00:56 - going to use this angle bracket and the
00:59 - name of the file whatever file you want
01:02 - to uh you know read for example I want
01:05 - to read this file itself which is my
01:08 - script file
01:09 - hello.sh right so I can just write
01:14 - hello.sh and then this is going to read
01:17 - this file and then this is going to go
01:21 - here in the parameter p and then using
01:24 - this Echo is going to read it right and
01:28 - what is input read Direction so input
01:32 - redirection is something like this that
01:34 - what wherever the pointing edge of this
01:38 - angle bracket is the stream of the red
01:41 - content goes to that direction so the
01:44 - file content inside this hello.sh is
01:47 - redirected to this while loop right and
01:51 - then it is read using the read command
01:53 - and then it's printed using the echo
01:55 - Command right so let's run the script
01:58 - and let's see what happens
02:00 - and you can see it prints the content of
02:03 - the file which is our script itself now
02:05 - the second way of reading the file is to
02:08 - read the file in a single variable and
02:11 - then print it now if you know pipes then
02:15 - it's easier for you so I'm going to just
02:18 - remove this things from here and then
02:22 - what I'm going to do here is I'm going
02:25 - to first of all use a cat command so
02:28 - before this while keyword I'm going to
02:30 - use scat and then whatever file uh you
02:33 - want to read once again
02:36 - hello.sh and then I will use this pipe
02:39 - symbol and that's it so what's happening
02:41 - here is whatever is the content which is
02:45 - red using this cat command is like a
02:49 - input for this while Command right so
02:54 - the content of uh this scat output is
02:57 - like a input to this while loop and then
03:00 - it's going to read it using this read
03:02 - command and then it's going to print the
03:04 - content of the file so once again let's
03:07 - run the script and once again you can
03:09 - see the same content is printed so the
03:13 - first way is by using the input
03:16 - redirection and second way is to uh you
03:19 - know read the file content into one
03:23 - variable and then print it now sometimes
03:27 - uh it's hard to read the files using
03:29 - using these two methods and uh the
03:32 - problem is some special characters in
03:34 - the file for example line indentation
03:37 - and other things so what we can do is in
03:41 - the last method is we will use this read
03:44 - commands once again but we will use the
03:48 - ifs now ifs stands for internal field
03:52 - separator and it is used by the shell to
03:55 - determine how to do word splitting and
03:58 - that is how to recognize word boundaries
04:02 - right so let's see how we can do this
04:04 - using ifs so we will use the while
04:08 - keyword here and then in capital use ifs
04:12 - and then is equal to and then give our
04:15 - space here so it's important to note
04:18 - here is that we are not assigning read
04:22 - to IFS we are assigning a space to an
04:26 - ifs right so just give the space between
04:30 - this equal to sign and the read command
04:33 - and with this read command we have to
04:35 - use minus r flag here and minus r
04:40 - prevents the back slash escape from
04:42 - being interpreted right so this flag is
04:46 - going to prevent backs slashes escapes
04:48 - from being interpreted right and instead
04:51 - of P you can also use LINE because it's
04:55 - more uh descriptive of this method and
04:59 - just use the line here okay now we are
05:02 - going to use once again input
05:04 - redirection here so use this angle
05:07 - bracket and then use the file name for
05:10 - example hello
05:12 - Dosh okay and uh let's run the script
05:17 - once again and let's see what happens
05:19 - and you can see it's uh printing the
05:21 - content of the file once again now if
05:23 - you are confused here instead of using
05:26 - space here you can just use in single
05:29 - code
05:30 - and a space here like this also and once
05:33 - again once again you can run the script
05:36 - and the you know output will be the same
05:40 - you can see here right so you can do
05:43 - this also right and uh for example we
05:47 - want to read the file which is uh there
05:50 - in my Etc folder for example so let's
05:54 - say what are the content in my Etc
05:56 - folder so I'm going to just uh LS for
06:00 - example
06:01 - Etc and you can see there are several
06:04 - files here and let's see what we want to
06:08 - read from here so for example I want to
06:11 - read uh the host conf which is here this
06:17 - is the host comp so let me just cat the
06:20 - content of this and then we will uh read
06:24 - this file using our while loop so cat
06:27 - and then Etc and then the file name
06:30 - host.com and this is the content of this
06:33 - file right so we will just copy the path
06:38 - of this file and then paste it here okay
06:42 - and then once again we will run the
06:44 - script and then press it and you can see
06:47 - the same content is printed whatever is
06:50 - printed using the cat command right so
06:53 - you can use these three methods to read
06:56 - the file using while loop now there are
06:59 - some other methods of reading files for
07:02 - example using file descriptors and that
07:06 - we will see in the later videos uh when
07:09 - we will learn what are file descriptors
07:11 - and other things right but these are the
07:13 - basic ways of reading the file using
07:16 - while loop so I hope youve enjoyed this

07:20 - and bye for now
