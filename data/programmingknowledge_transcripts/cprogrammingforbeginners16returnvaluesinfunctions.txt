00:01 - hello guys welcome once again in the
00:03 - last two videos I have been showing you
00:05 - how to use functions in C and in the
00:08 - last video I have shown you how to use a
00:10 - function with arguments or parameters
00:14 - now in this video I'm going to show you
00:16 - how you can use function to return some
00:20 - value right so till now we have been
00:24 - writing functions like this with a void
00:28 - but from uh any function you can return
00:32 - some value uh which can be of any type
00:36 - for example integer double character or
00:39 - string or anything so let's see how we
00:42 - can use a function to return a
00:44 - value now for example we want to make a
00:48 - function which gives us uh the product
00:53 - of uh something this example I have
00:55 - shown you uh last time if you remember
00:59 - and what uh I was doing in this function
01:02 - is I was asking the user to enter two
01:06 - values so it says please enter two
01:09 - values number one and I scan uh first
01:13 - number and I scanned second number and
01:16 - then I passed it passed these two number
01:19 - to this function now let's uh say we
01:22 - want to uh make a function which uh
01:25 - gives us the uh value or product of
01:31 - something and then we want to uh process
01:35 - this number so we will make a new
01:37 - function here to return some value so
01:41 - for example we want to make a function
01:44 - which gives us the multiplication of two
01:46 - numbers or product of two numbers so uh
01:49 - and it will return something so what we
01:52 - are going to do we are going to write
01:55 - first of all return value earlier we
01:58 - used to write here void because we were
02:01 - not returning anything but this time we
02:04 - will return some integer from the
02:07 - function that's why we are writing int
02:10 - here right and then write the name of
02:13 - the function for
02:15 - example product this is the name of the
02:18 - function and what this will do it'll
02:20 - take two argument int a comma int B and
02:26 - it's going to give us the result as a
02:29 - product of these two numbers so in order
02:32 - to return some value for example product
02:36 - of these two numbers we use a keyword
02:42 - called return okay and because we want
02:46 - to uh return product of A and B we can
02:49 - write a as STX B right so we can return
02:55 - the product of A and B and what this
02:59 - basically means mean is this this
03:01 - function will take two parameters A and
03:03 - B and then in here it will uh make the
03:07 - product of these two numbers A and B and
03:10 - then it will return this number as an
03:13 - integer right and then we can use this
03:17 - number uh for doing some other
03:21 - mathematical stuff or anything else so
03:25 - for calling this function we can call it
03:27 - just by its name
03:30 - and because we have the code from the
03:32 - last time in which uh we have declared
03:35 - two numbers and we were asking user to
03:38 - enter two numbers this is really basic
03:41 - so by now you uh may have known what uh
03:45 - this code is doing it's just taking two
03:47 - values from the user and then we will
03:50 - pass these two values X comma y to our
03:53 - product function right and then this x
03:57 - comma y will be replaced here in the
04:02 - place of A and B it will give multiply
04:06 - these two um numbers and then it will
04:10 - return the product as an integer so
04:14 - because it's going to return our product
04:17 - we will define an integer for example
04:20 - int uh p o
04:24 - d so this integer we will use integer
04:27 - variable we will use to the product
04:30 - which will be returned by this product
04:33 - function right so product or pre is
04:38 - equal to product
04:41 - because this function is going to return
04:43 - something as an integer and we will
04:46 - store this integer which this function
04:49 - is going to return in this uh variable
04:53 - right and then we can print the value
04:56 - of
04:58 - print print
05:00 - F and then we can print
05:05 - uh
05:07 - product is equal to percentage
05:11 - D
05:12 - comma p o d which is this one this
05:17 - variable right and let's see what
05:20 - happens when we uh compile our program I
05:23 - will just make it little bit smaller so
05:25 - that we can see all our uh program I
05:28 - will run the program
05:30 - now and it's saying something let's see
05:33 - what's the
05:35 - error and the error here is
05:40 - um undefined reference
05:43 - to print
05:46 - F so this should be P small right run
05:53 - the
05:54 - program and it says enter first number
05:58 - for example 20 I press enter enter
06:01 - second number for example 30 and when I
06:03 - press enter it gives us the product of
06:06 - these two number which is 600 right and
06:11 - what this has basically done uh we have
06:13 - given two numbers X is equal 20 Y is
06:17 - equal to 30 so now X is equal to 20
06:21 - which is uh replaced here and Y is equal
06:24 - to 30 which is replaced here so 20 and
06:26 - 30 is passed to this function and this
06:29 - goes here then it will multiply 20 and
06:33 - 30 and then it will return the result
06:36 - into this variable which we can store
06:40 - okay in a simple uh you know simple
06:44 - usage if you don't understand still what
06:47 - this is
06:48 - doing then what we can do is we can
06:52 - directly uh pass two values for example
06:57 - 10 and
07:00 - 60 for example I'm taking simple values
07:03 - so that you can understand so this is
07:06 - basically 10 and 20 we have passed to
07:09 - this function because this function TS
07:12 - integer so we need to pass uh only
07:14 - integers here right so 10 will be
07:17 - replaced here at the place of a and 20
07:20 - 60 will be replaced here at the place of
07:22 - B now 10 will be multiplied by 60 and
07:26 - then it will be return and this value we
07:29 - can store it in another
07:32 - variable for example this variable which
07:35 - we can use for uh
07:39 - something or for example if you want to
07:41 - use this function in or this variable
07:44 - for some other use so what we want to do
07:48 - is for example a
07:51 - result
07:53 - result is equal to and then do
07:58 - percentage d
08:00 - and what we want to do is whatever
08:02 - product we are getting from a product
08:07 - function we want to add uh 10 to it and
08:11 - then show the result okay so I will call
08:16 - product and let's uh delete this thing
08:21 - for now and we will make it more simple
08:24 - so what we are going to do is we are
08:26 - going to call this function called
08:29 - product and we will pass two values for
08:31 - example we pass this uh time five and
08:37 - five once again so 5 into 5 is 25 right
08:42 - this is a simple uh uh parameter I'm
08:45 - giving so that we know the result so 5
08:48 - into 5 is 25 which will be returned by
08:50 - this uh product and we can add 10 to
08:54 - it 10 to it and the result will be 30 5
09:00 - right so let's try and run the program
09:03 - it says result is equal to 35 so you can
09:07 - use uh
09:08 - this function which returns integer
09:11 - value uh as a you know parameter which
09:15 - you can uh you know do arithmetic
09:18 - operation on this parameter or on this
09:21 - function also so in this way you can use
09:25 - function which Returns value okay and
09:28 - don't don't forget to use this return
09:31 - keyword whenever you are returning
09:34 - anything so I hope you understood the
09:36 - basic concept of function which returns
09:40 - and I hope you have enjoyed this video
09:41 - please RIT comment and subscribe and bye
09:43 - for now
