00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - shell scripting tutorial for beginners
00:04 - and in this video we will talk about
00:06 - local
00:07 - variables Now by default every variable
00:11 - which you declare in your script is a
00:13 - global variable and that means it can be
00:17 - existed from anywhere in your script now
00:21 - let me give you an example and then we
00:22 - will understand why do we need a local
00:25 - variable and how to use them so this
00:29 - print function I have shown you in the
00:31 - last video that you can declare a
00:34 - function like this and this is a
00:36 - function print which takes an argument
00:39 - and whenever we provide an argument for
00:41 - example we call this uh print function
00:43 - like this and we provide the first
00:45 - argument this will will be assigned to
00:48 - this dollar one we have seen in the last
00:50 - video right now let's say this function
00:53 - we need to use to print a name so I'm
00:57 - going to declare a variable called name
00:59 - here and and I'm going to assign the
01:00 - value of uh this first argument like
01:03 - this here and here we will just print
01:07 - the value of the name right so we can
01:11 - just write the name is and then the
01:16 - variable name which is dollar name here
01:18 - right and let's run the script and let's
01:22 - give some name here so print for example
01:24 - the name is Max here right so I'm going
01:28 - to just run the script and let's see
01:30 - what happens so it prints the name is
01:32 - Max which is correct right because this
01:35 - name is assigned to this variable uh and
01:39 - then this first argument is assigned to
01:41 - the variable name and we are printing
01:44 - the value of name now I said previously
01:48 - that all variables are Global in shell
01:52 - script so the name can be declared here
01:55 - also and then we can assign some value
01:58 - to it so let's say now we assigned a
02:02 - name a value Tom to this name variable
02:06 - right and then we can just write Echo
02:10 - here and then we can just say the name
02:16 - is and once again dollar name right so
02:21 - let's run the script once again now and
02:23 - let's see what happens so first it says
02:26 - the name is Tom because we have a sign
02:29 - find the value of name first of all Tom
02:34 - so this is the function declaration
02:36 - right and until unless you call a
02:39 - function uh it will uh sit like this
02:42 - right so the shell script execution
02:46 - start from here right and uh we declare
02:49 - a variable called name and then we
02:52 - assign some value to it which is stor
02:55 - here and then first of all we are
02:57 - printing uh the value value of a name
03:01 - which is we which is assigned to the
03:02 - name so uh it will print it will be
03:05 - printed from this uh Echo command and
03:08 - then our print function will be called
03:12 - and then using this name variable this
03:15 - Echo command will be executed which is
03:18 - printing the second uh line of code
03:21 - which is the name is Max and then our
03:24 - default Echo value which is Fu is
03:27 - printed here right so what uh it tells
03:32 - us that uh this name is a global
03:35 - variable and we can access it from
03:38 - anywhere in the script but sometimes we
03:41 - want that our variable which we Define
03:46 - in a function should remain a local
03:49 - variable so it should not be uh changed
03:53 - outside of the function and that's where
03:56 - the local command comes in
04:00 - so there is a command called local and
04:04 - whenever you uh add this command then
04:07 - your local VAR your variable becomes
04:10 - local and it can be used inside a
04:14 - function only right so we can just
04:18 - declare this variable name something
04:20 - like this and then we can
04:22 - say local we add a local keyword before
04:27 - it so let me just uh remove this local
04:30 - keyword for now and let me add once
04:34 - again the name is here so I'm printing
04:38 - the name is after the print uh function
04:42 - is called and before the print function
04:45 - is called right so I will just say the
04:49 - name is this and then uh we can just
04:53 - write uh colon
04:57 - before and colon after
05:01 - right and let's see what happens here
05:04 - before adding the local keyword right so
05:07 - I'm going to just run the script once
05:08 - again and you can
05:10 - see that uh once again the Tom value is
05:14 - assigned to the name so before this
05:18 - function is called the value which is
05:21 - assigned to name is uh Tom which is
05:25 - correct but after this uh function print
05:29 - is called
05:30 - now the value Max is assigned to the
05:33 - name variable now so it prints the name
05:37 - is Max from this Echo command and here
05:41 - this command prints the value uh the
05:43 - name is Max once again so the uh you
05:47 - know variable which is name uh now
05:51 - possesses the value Max right so this is
05:56 - little bit confusing right because our
05:59 - uh
06:00 - we expect that this should remain Tom
06:04 - because this is outside our function
06:07 - right so this name is local to this
06:10 - function and we expect that it should
06:13 - not change the value of This Global name
06:16 - right so here we want the name is Tom
06:20 - because originally this is a global
06:22 - variable and we have assign the value of
06:24 - Tom here and after this function is
06:26 - called we expect this this variable
06:30 - possess the value Tom and not Max but
06:33 - what's happening here after this
06:35 - function is called the value Max is
06:38 - assigned to this name and then it's
06:40 - printing the Max uh name here using this
06:44 - Echo command which we don't want and
06:48 - that's why we use the local variable for
06:50 - example we just write local here and
06:54 - once again when we call the script or
06:57 - run the script now see what happens so
07:01 - now whenever you add this uh keyword
07:05 - local in front of your variable then
07:08 - your variable is local to this function
07:12 - and it cannot be accessed outside the
07:15 - function so this is just a local uh
07:18 - execution of codes and it will not
07:20 - affect the global variable so now what
07:24 - happens we uh this variable name is
07:28 - different from this variable local name
07:32 - right so first of all we have assigned
07:34 - the value Tom to the name and it will
07:37 - print the name is uh Tom using this
07:42 - before right so this is the uh EO
07:45 - command which is printing uh the name is
07:47 - Tom here then we are calling the print
07:50 - function and print the name is Max here
07:54 - because we have assigned the value uh to
07:57 - this local variable Max
08:00 - but not the global variable name right
08:03 - so it prints the name is uh Max but once
08:07 - again when we call our name variable
08:09 - then it prints the name is Tom once
08:12 - again which we expect right so This
08:15 - Global variable is now different from
08:19 - this local variable because this local
08:21 - variable is uh you know only accessible
08:25 - by this print function and not from
08:28 - somewhere else from this script so this
08:30 - is how you can use local variables and
08:33 - this is the concept behind using the
08:36 - local variable so I hope you understood
08:38 - the basic concept I hope you enjoyed
