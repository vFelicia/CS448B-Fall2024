00:00 - hello friends welcome to programming
00:01 - knowledge with this video we are
00:04 - starting based in a programming series
00:05 - which is based upon false Christ's will
00:08 - so before going further let us first
00:11 - discuss about what is database first of
00:16 - all what is data in simple words data
00:19 - came to fact related to any object in
00:21 - consideration if we consider a human
00:24 - object then name age height weight
00:27 - etcetera
00:28 - anything that can define a person is a
00:31 - data a data has many format it can be
00:35 - text number picture image file PDF
00:39 - etcetera that all be considers as data
00:44 - now what is database databases support
00:48 - storage and manipulation of data if we
00:52 - have data we need something to
00:54 - manipulate that data
00:55 - that's why database come into picture if
00:59 - you consider an online telephone
01:00 - directory definitely it is a database
01:04 - because it store people information like
01:07 - numbers contact details and we use this
01:10 - telephone directory to find it data if
01:13 - we consider a social network like
01:16 - Facebook it contains data about people
01:20 - their friends their activities messages
01:24 - advertisements and a lots more this is
01:27 - also a database now too many is all of
01:31 - this database we need a system that is
01:34 - called database management system in
01:36 - that's why poor screens will come into
01:39 - picture PostgreSQL is a powerful and
01:43 - open source object relational database
01:46 - that uses and extend this sequel
01:48 - language combined with many features
01:50 - that safely store and scale the most
01:54 - complicated data records it supports
01:57 - acid properties some of you may not
02:01 - aware of what is acid properties so let
02:04 - me tell that first in acid property L
02:08 - stands for atomicity it means that
02:12 - either
02:13 - all the instruction follows on either
02:15 - should be it's must be atomic
02:19 - C stands for consistency after
02:23 - performing sequel queries your data your
02:27 - data base must be consistence I stands
02:31 - for integrity integrity means all the
02:36 - transaction should perform independently
02:39 - that do not depends on each other and
02:42 - lastly these stands for durability which
02:46 - means reliability your data base must be
02:48 - durable so you can get the right data
02:53 - now post press runs from all the major
02:56 - operating system whether it is Windows
02:58 - Mac or Linux and it is no surprise that
03:02 - Postgres kan has become the open source
03:05 - relational database of choice for many
03:07 - people and organizations it provides so
03:11 - many more features that nowadays strumsy
03:15 - organization uses the force for SQL it
03:19 - comes with many features like
03:22 - administrator to protect data integrity
03:24 - and build fault tolerant environment and
03:27 - helps you to manage your debt and no
03:30 - matter how big or small the data set
03:32 - whether your database is small or big
03:35 - you can use Foursquare sphere we can
03:38 - also extends our database for example we
03:41 - can define our own data types our own
03:44 - custom function and we can even write
03:46 - code from different programming
03:48 - languages without recompiling your
03:50 - database that means a single database
03:53 - can be used with multiple programming
03:56 - languages now this is the main features
04:01 - of the Postgres well first of all data
04:05 - types
04:05 - it supports most of the data types
04:10 - whether this integer float or string or
04:15 - character or where care or every type of
04:18 - database depending Italy is a
04:24 - as I told you in data integrity in acid
04:28 - property all the transaction should be
04:31 - performed independently it is a reliable
04:34 - and disaster recovery it also provides
04:37 - supports for recovery security it is
04:41 - secure and extensibility means we can
04:43 - write our own custom function our own
04:46 - data types so this is all about
04:50 - PostgreSQL we'll discuss things to
04:53 - understand process in our next video
04:56 - thanks for watching
