00:00 - hello guys welcome once again in this
00:02 - video I will show you how to use
00:05 - autocomplete properties with your combo
00:07 - box and text boxes so let's get started
00:10 - I will take a combo box from my toolbox
00:14 - and I will take a text box from my
00:17 - toolbox and what I will do is first of
00:19 - all I will select my text box and I will
00:22 - go to the
00:24 - property Explorer here and I will search
00:29 - for the property called autocomplete
00:32 - custom source autocomplete mode and
00:34 - autocomplete
00:36 - source so let's uh give a custom source
00:41 - to the uh text box first so what I will
00:46 - do is I will select this property called
00:49 - autocomplete custom mode and here I will
00:52 - click the small button and here I can
00:55 - add custom source for example list of
00:58 - names so I will add
01:01 - add some names
01:04 - here
01:10 - and okay so I have included four names
01:13 - here and I will click okay and then what
01:16 - I need to do is I need to select what
01:19 - mode I want to choose there are three
01:23 - mode suggest upend and suggest upend
01:26 - both at the same time first of all I
01:28 - will select this suggest mode here and
01:32 - in the third property I need to select
01:34 - what is the source type of my
01:36 - autocomplete so I will select custom
01:39 - source because I have selected custom
01:42 - source from here right so select this
01:45 - custom source and when I run the
01:48 - program and when I enter some word or
01:53 - letter here it will show me the
01:55 - suggestions here right and this concept
01:59 - you you can utilize for example I want
02:01 - to show the list of the countries and I
02:04 - want to see the
02:06 - suggestions okay so we have selected
02:09 - custom uh autocomplete mode as suggest
02:12 - and upend what it will do is it
02:17 - will not show the suggestion but it will
02:20 - append the name so for example I write M
02:23 - here it'll append all the other
02:28 - words or all the other letters of the
02:30 - name here right and it will not show any
02:33 - suggestions and when I choose suggestion
02:37 - and append it will append and suggest
02:39 - suggest both now for example on a bigger
02:44 - application for example I want to show
02:47 - or and see
02:49 - the list of the countries as a custom
02:52 - source so what I will do is I have the
02:55 - list of the countries which you can uh
02:58 - take it from the the internet for free
03:01 - and I will copy this and I will paste it
03:05 - in my custom source block
03:10 - okay and this these name I need to
03:14 - remove and I'll click
03:21 - okay and in here I have once again
03:24 - suggest upend so it will upend and
03:27 - suggest at the same time and here I will
03:31 - say I want to
03:34 - search for
03:37 - um let's see what is what country we
03:40 - want to search Germany so it's when I
03:45 - just entered GE and it will suggest me
03:49 - all the suggestion with uh the letter GE
03:54 - and I have two options and it also
03:56 - appends the first suggestion in my
03:59 - textbook
04:00 - box and for example I write a I get all
04:04 - the suggestions and first it will append
04:07 - the first suggestion in the text box
04:10 - okay in this way you can use this custom
04:14 - suggestion second thing you can choose
04:18 - from here is the auto complete source as
04:22 - other types for example file system so
04:27 - when I run the program once again
04:30 - it'll give
04:32 - me when
04:34 - I enter something it will suggest me the
04:37 - file system right now there is no file
04:40 - system right
04:42 - now and for
04:45 - example I want the all URL uh complete
04:50 - Source or yeah autoc complete source so
04:54 - I will select this all
04:56 - URL and when I run the program it will
05:00 - upend so for example I will
05:04 - write msdn
05:07 - or Google then it will all give me all
05:11 - the options which I have recently
05:14 - browsed with the URL Google or Microsoft
05:18 - whatever suggestion it has to offer so
05:22 - in this way you can use to suggest URLs
05:26 - also and you can explore all the kind of
05:30 - suggestions from here recently used list
05:33 - or all system source and file system
05:37 - directories and other list are there and
05:41 - the same thing you can do it for your
05:44 - list box also so you can choose the
05:47 - custom
05:49 - source like that only and just you can
05:52 - select all the modes from here and you
05:56 - can choose all the source from here but
06:00 - one more suggestion or one more Source
06:04 - autocomplete Source option uh the combo
06:06 - box has is the list item so when you
06:10 - want to bind the database options with
06:14 - your combo box you can do it with this
06:17 - list item but but right now I haven't
