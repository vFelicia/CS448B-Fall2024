00:01 - hello guys welcome once again in this
00:02 - video I'm going to show you how you can
00:05 - declare your classes in different file
00:08 - other than your
00:10 - main.cpp and use those classes from
00:14 - different files in your main. cpb and
00:18 - why it is important and useful to Define
00:22 - your classes in different
00:24 - files is because uh whenever you write
00:29 - uh
00:30 - programmer or whenever programmers write
00:33 - a big program which can contain hundreds
00:37 - of classes and if they write each and
00:41 - every class on the same file it becomes
00:44 - really overwhelming for the other uh
00:48 - programmers for example uh the
00:50 - colleagues or the uh for or the boss to
00:56 - read those classes in the same file so
01:00 - in order to make your program readable
01:06 - and more accessible we Define our
01:10 - classes in different file so we can find
01:13 - those uh classes uh really fast and this
01:18 - makes your program really uh readable
01:21 - and understandable so let's see how we
01:24 - can create files for the class and then
01:29 - we will see how we can use this class in
01:32 - our
01:33 - main.cpp so if you're using Code blocks
01:36 - or any good ide it has a mechanism of
01:41 - making those those file class files for
01:45 - you so for example this uh tutorial
01:49 - series I'm doing on code blocks uh in
01:52 - here you need to go to
01:54 - file new and you will see the option
01:57 - class here in every good ID you will be
02:01 - able to find this option class and in
02:04 - here you can Define the name of the
02:06 - class so for example I want to make the
02:09 - book class so I will
02:11 - say
02:13 - books
02:15 - and here you can provide other other
02:19 - options like if you want to have
02:21 - Destructor or if you want to have
02:23 - virtual Destructor which I haven't uh
02:26 - taught you yet so I will just uncheck
02:29 - every thing because I would like to um
02:32 - write my code by myself and not uh by
02:37 - this wizard so I will just use this
02:39 - visual wizard to make the class and
02:42 - everything else we are going to do by
02:46 - ourself so it will be easier to you know
02:50 - remember things now the second thing is
02:54 - you need to do is if by default this uh
02:58 - checkbox is unchecked which is header
03:00 - and implementation file shall be in same
03:03 - F folder just check this checkbox and
03:08 - what this mean is you want to create
03:11 - this class files in
03:15 - your project folder for example I have
03:18 - my project folder here and this project
03:22 - folder contains the
03:24 - main.cpp and this project file and I
03:28 - want this class file also in the same
03:31 - folder okay so this checkboxes does that
03:36 - and then just click
03:39 - create and just say yes and you can
03:44 - say yes okay and as soon as you do that
03:50 - just go to your uh project file once
03:52 - again and you see here there are two new
03:56 - file generated here one is called both
03:59 - book. CPP and one is
04:02 - books. and you will be able to see them
04:05 - here also
04:08 - book. and book. CPP okay before
04:14 - explaining this uh these uh classes to
04:18 - you and header files to you I would like
04:20 - to compile my program so I will compile
04:24 - this and in code blocks whenever you
04:28 - create uh this
04:30 - class by this Wizard and whenever you
04:34 - compile it it will give you this error I
04:37 - I am getting this error if you are in
04:40 - case you are getting this error which is
04:42 - undefined reference to win main at the
04:44 - rate 16 then what you need to do you
04:48 - just
04:49 - need to close this your project so I
04:53 - will just close my project and I will
04:55 - save all my
04:57 - changes and I will once again open code
05:05 - blocks and then this problem will be
05:09 - solved so I will reopen my project once
05:12 - again and once once again I compile this
05:16 - and you see there are no errors now so I
05:20 - I don't know if it's a bug or what but
05:24 - uh this is the solution I found for this
05:28 - problem okay once this is
05:31 - done you have
05:37 - your book. CPP file so how you can open
05:41 - the these files just right click and
05:44 - just say open books. or books. CPP okay
05:49 - so we have two files here this code
05:53 - blogs wizard has created two files for
05:55 - us one is called books. which is called
05:59 - header file file and one other is called
06:02 - books. CPP which is called source file
06:06 - and we haven't seen uh this declaration
06:11 - of classes so what Hader file is doing
06:16 - here is it contains the Declaration or
06:20 - prototyping of your class or your method
06:23 - so whatever Declaration of the class you
06:26 - want to do you will do in this
06:30 - header file or books. Ed file okay and
06:33 - this source file we can will contain the
06:37 - definition of those member functions or
06:40 - those classes so here you will write the
06:45 - method definition so I have I think in
06:48 - the earlier videos I have uh uh
06:51 - explained you what is member not member
06:54 - function but what is function
06:57 - prototyping what you do in function
07:00 - prototyping you just make a prototype of
07:02 - function at the top of or above your
07:05 - main function and you can define the
07:08 - definition of the function below your
07:10 - main function so this above uh which you
07:15 - define is called the prototyping same
07:17 - this header file is doing it's only
07:20 - containing
07:22 - the the prototypes and this will contain
07:26 - all of your code for your function so
07:28 - let's see what is this class containing
07:33 - this uh code I will explain you later so
07:37 - just uh uh leave it as it is for now but
07:41 - this is the class definition and we know
07:43 - that uh this is how you declare the
07:46 - class and it has
07:48 - three
07:50 - pre-processor directives
07:53 - or this public protected and private and
07:58 - this I will explain you later in later
08:01 - videoos but we have learned how we can
08:04 - use Public Access specifier right
08:09 - so I will use only public and this is
08:12 - Constructor if you have followed my last
08:15 - video so let's
08:17 - define some member variable in this
08:21 - public uh domain so I will Define int
08:26 - book ID for example so I will say book
08:31 - ID and I want to define the getter and
08:34 - Setter function for this uh book ID I
08:37 - also explained you this getter and
08:39 - Setter functions in the previous videos
08:41 - if you remember so I will Define first
08:44 - of all set so
08:49 - set book ID and what it takes it is
08:54 - initialized by void so we are not
08:58 - returning anything and it takes an
09:00 - argument which
09:02 - is same as book ID so I will say book ID
09:07 - but with an underscore so we know that
09:10 - this is the argument and this is our
09:13 - member variable in a similar way I will
09:16 - Define uh get getter so I will say int
09:20 - getter Returns the type which uh we want
09:26 - to return so we have book and it's has
09:29 - type or data type int so we are
09:31 - returning int and I will say
09:35 - get book ID okay and it doesn't take any
09:42 - parameter so this is called the
09:44 - prototyping of the function right and in
09:49 - header file we do the prototyping of
09:51 - these function and the definition or the
09:55 - source code of the these function will
09:58 - come in this
10:00 - book. CPP in here now before moving
10:05 - further you might be wondering what is
10:08 - this why uh it's written here book colon
10:12 - colon books so this
10:16 - uh double colon is called binary scope
10:21 - resolution operator and why we are using
10:25 - this binary scope resolution operator
10:28 - because you can Define different uh
10:33 - classes which can have the same function
10:36 - uh set ID and get book ID set book ID
10:40 - and get book ID so how you will
10:44 - recognize that this set book ID is a
10:48 - part of this class so you you use the
10:52 - name of the class colon colon the member
10:55 - function so this is the
10:57 - Constructor which is this one and first
11:00 - one is the class name so class name and
11:05 - the member function and this is books
11:08 - because this is the Constructor and this
11:10 - is also a member function of your class
11:12 - right so same thing we do with our set
11:15 - book ID and get book ID so just remember
11:19 - this double colon is called binary scope
11:23 - resolution operator okay I'll copy this
11:27 - and this comes just after or just before
11:31 - the name of your function so this is the
11:33 - name of your function just before the
11:35 - name of your function you use this uh
11:39 - name of the class and then this binary
11:42 - scope resolution operator and then name
11:45 - of the function now you can easily say
11:48 - that this function is a member function
11:52 - of this book class right that's why we
11:55 - are using this and same we are doing
11:58 - with we will do with this get book ID
12:01 - but this is our CP file so we need to
12:05 - Define these function or we need to
12:08 - write the source C code for set book ID
12:11 - and get book ID
12:14 - right so in set a function what we do we
12:18 - just take our argument here and we will
12:24 - just pass it to our member variable so I
12:29 - will just do
12:32 - this equal to this okay and what getter
12:37 - does it only returns your member
12:41 - variable which is this one so you can
12:46 - write return PO ID okay so this you know
12:52 - how to declare or Define member
12:55 - functions now
12:59 - whenever you see this uh
13:02 - main.cpp you see here we have defined
13:05 - these uh files here so it has include
13:11 - this iio stream and include this string
13:14 - and using namespace STD so what you need
13:17 - to do is in you need to copy this all
13:22 - these
13:24 - inclusions and paste it in your header
13:27 - file also so so that your uh header file
13:32 - or class will also know that uh if you
13:36 - use uh string or I stream or standard uh
13:40 - name space your uh you know this member
13:45 - variable doesn't get confused that where
13:47 - this comes from you need to include
13:50 - these includes I streams and whatever uh
13:54 - files or headers you want are including
13:57 - in the main file you need to include it
14:00 - in the header file also
14:03 - and if you see in
14:06 - the books. CPP it's including books.
14:11 - which is this header file so your source
14:14 - file will
14:16 - always initialized by this inclusion of
14:19 - your header file and why we are
14:21 - including this we are including this to
14:24 - tell your source file which is your
14:27 - book. CPP that we have declared the
14:31 - Prototype of this class in the header
14:35 - file so include all the all the all the
14:38 - classes or the Declaration from the
14:40 - header file in the CPP file so this line
14:44 - will include your your classes or
14:48 - whatever declaration you have done in
14:50 - the header file now your CPP file will
14:54 - know that uh yes I need
14:57 - to I will see this s declaration here
14:59 - and yes I can then
15:03 - uh give the source code for these member
15:08 - functions here so always include this in
15:11 - the CPP file so you are including this
15:14 - in the CPP file books. CP file you need
15:17 - to include this just copy this in your
15:19 - main file in order to call this
15:23 - class in your
15:25 - main.cpp okay so just include this book
15:29 - header file in your
15:31 - main.cpp now your main.cpp knows that
15:35 - there is some header file and it will go
15:38 - to this header file and it will see
15:40 - there is a class de declaration there so
15:44 - now it knows that there exist a a class
15:47 - in this header file which I can use okay
15:52 - now everything is simple whatever you
15:55 - can make the object of the class I have
15:58 - already told you how to use classes so
16:01 - just copy the name of the class go to
16:03 - your main function and we will Define
16:06 - the object of the class books and for
16:10 - example book one this is the object
16:14 - declaration and then we can use this
16:17 - object to call our function member
16:19 - functions of the class so first book dot
16:22 - I will call the set book ID so this will
16:25 - set the book ID and this will take some
16:29 - argument so I want to set book ID is
16:30 - equal to 100 for example and I will use
16:33 - get book ID to print this uh uh ID of
16:38 - the book right so I'll write see
16:43 - out
16:46 - and then I will write
16:49 - book 1 dot get book ID so this will
16:54 - return you the book ID right and then
16:58 - once again
17:01 - and line okay
17:04 - so this will return you 100 because we
17:08 - have set the value of book ID is equal
17:11 - to 100 and we are getting this here and
17:14 - printing it so let's compile our our
17:17 - code and it's compiled successfully and
17:21 - when I run this program you will see 100
17:23 - here okay so now you can declare your
17:28 - classes
17:29 - in this form of uh source file and
17:33 - header file and use these classes in
17:36 - your main
17:38 - main.cpp file so that it's
17:42 - easier to uh you know see and you
17:46 - understand that you have this class
17:49 - declaration here and you can use these
17:52 - classes here so this makes your code
17:55 - really simple in terms of
17:59 - understanding
18:01 - and uh in a long run when you have you
18:05 - know 10 or 50 classes it will make your
18:09 - uh you know programming really easy when
18:12 - you define these classes in
18:15 - different header files and source files
18:18 - okay so I hope you understood the basic
18:21 - concept of these the classes which we
18:24 - declare in the other files and I hope
18:29 - you have enjoyed this video please RIT
18:30 - comment and subscribe and bye for now
