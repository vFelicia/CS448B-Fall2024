00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Android app development for
00:04 - beginners in this video we will see how
00:07 - we can create a text file and save it
00:12 - into the internal storage of your
00:14 - Android device so there are two ways you
00:18 - can uh save a file in your Android
00:22 - device one is in the internal memory and
00:26 - other is the external memory so in this
00:29 - video we are going to see how we can
00:31 - save a file in a in the internal memory
00:35 - okay so what I have here is I have two
00:39 - buttons one is to read the text file and
00:43 - one is to write to the text file and I
00:46 - have one edit text here and one large
00:50 - text this edit text I'm going to use to
00:53 - enter some text to save and this large
00:58 - text I'm going to use to retrieve the
01:03 - data I have saved okay so let's get
01:07 - started first of all I'm going to create
01:09 - some method so I will go to the text
01:12 - area here and for the button two which
01:18 - is for reading I'm going to add a
01:21 - attribute on click and the name I will
01:26 - uh give it here is read okay
01:30 - and same I will do for the write button
01:33 - so instead of read here I will just
01:36 - write write
01:39 - okay now I will go to the main activity.
01:44 - Java file here and in here first of all
01:48 - I will declare two variable one for text
01:51 - View and other for edit views so addit
01:58 - text
02:02 - now I will uh cast these two
02:16 - variables now after casting these two
02:19 - variables what I'm going to do is I'm
02:21 - going to create two method one to read
02:24 - and one to write
02:28 - right
02:34 - now what I'm going to do is I'm going to
02:36 - go to my right method and inside my
02:39 - right method I'm going to create a
02:41 - variable called my text message for
02:43 - example and I'm going to extract the
02:47 - text from the text edit and pass it into
02:52 - this variable so I will take my edit
02:55 - text variable from here paste it here
02:58 - dot get
03:00 - text and Dot two string okay now what
03:05 - I'm going to do is I'm going to create
03:07 - an instance of file output stream which
03:10 - we can use to Output to a text file
03:14 - right so file output stream the object
03:16 - name is equal to open file output and
03:20 - then give the name to your text file for
03:23 - example my text. text and then give the
03:27 - mode so for example mode I am going to
03:30 - give it like uh for example mode private
03:34 - okay and this mode private indicates
03:36 - that no other uh app can use this file
03:41 - other than your app okay so it's private
03:43 - to your app now you can see here it's
03:46 - going to give you this red line and this
03:49 - red bulb and it says you need to
03:51 - surround your code by tratch block
03:54 - because it can throw so just click
03:56 - suround with TR catch and everything
03:58 - will be good to go go now take your
04:01 - object which is file output stream and
04:04 - then just call a right method on it and
04:07 - then we will pass our string here in the
04:10 - form of bytes so my text message. get
04:15 - bytes okay and this is also going to
04:18 - throw an exception so you need to add
04:22 - one more catch Clause so just click this
04:25 - red bulb and just add a catch Clause
04:29 - here
04:30 - okay now once you are done with this
04:33 - once you have written to the file you
04:36 - need to close the file so take your file
04:39 - output stream and close it okay and
04:43 - after closing you may want to uh show
04:45 - that your file is saved so you can call
04:49 - a toast do make text and then the
04:53 - context and then you can uh give some
04:56 - text for example text saved okay and
05:01 - then the length of your text so for
05:05 - example toast length long do show okay
05:10 - and you may also want to uh clear your
05:14 - addit text after writing to the file so
05:17 - you can just use edit text do set text
05:21 - and set an empty string here okay when
05:25 - you want to read a file this time you
05:28 - want to use uh object of the class
05:32 - called file input stream okay so file
05:35 - input stream is equal to
05:38 - new file input
05:42 - stream and give the name of your text
05:46 - file which is this one my text. text
05:50 - right or if you have provided some
05:53 - location give the location of your text
05:55 - file and close it okay and now this time
05:59 - also it's going to give you this uh red
06:02 - line here because you need to enclose it
06:05 - in the TR catch block okay now after
06:09 - this you need to
06:11 - have input stream
06:15 - reader input stream reader object is
06:18 - equal to new input stream reader and
06:22 - then you need to pass your file input
06:25 - stream to this input stream reader
06:29 - object object Okay the third object you
06:32 - need is buffer reader okay so just use
06:36 - buffered reader buffered reader
06:41 - object is equal to
06:43 - new buffer reader and pass your input
06:48 - stream reader in this Constructor here
06:52 - and then last thing we need is string
06:56 - buffer is equal to new string
07:00 - buffer and one more variable we need is
07:03 - a string because we want to read this
07:07 - text line by line in a variable and this
07:10 - will store these lines this variable
07:14 - lines for example okay now I'm going to
07:17 - create a while loop
07:21 - here and what I'm going to do is I'm
07:23 - going to just write lines is equal to
07:27 - your buffer reader name
07:30 - dot read line and then enclose all this
07:35 - into one more bracket so here one more
07:38 - bracket
07:40 - and here one more bracket and then just
07:43 - write not equal to null okay and close
07:49 - this while loop and once again you will
07:52 - observe here that it's going to give you
07:54 - this uh red line and this is because we
07:57 - need to add this C CCH Clause here and
08:01 - it will go okay after this you just need
08:03 - to take your string buffer and append
08:07 - these lines into this string buffer so
08:10 - append and then
08:14 - line and then uh we are reading these
08:18 - lines one by one so we need to give the
08:21 - line break also here right so just
08:24 - give back sln now once you have all this
08:29 - string what you can do is you can show
08:32 - it into your text view so just use this
08:36 - text view here dot set text and take
08:40 - your string
08:42 - buffer and then give to
08:46 - string okay now I think one thing we are
08:49 - missing here is instead of using file
08:52 - input stream we must use open file input
08:56 - right so instead of uh file input stream
09:00 - just replace it with open file input
09:02 - here like we have done here for the open
09:06 - file output right so let's run our code
09:09 - and now our app is running so I can
09:12 - write something here so for example
09:17 - this and when I click write button here
09:21 - it's going to write this to our text
09:24 - file and we can see text save message
09:27 - here right and when whenever we want to
09:29 - read it we can just click this uh read
09:33 - button and it's going to read this text
09:35 - and show it into the text view okay once
09:39 - again some random text I'm going to
09:42 - write so this is some random text and I
09:46 - click right and it's saved and now I can
09:50 - read it by just clicking this read
09:52 - button and it reads it and display it
09:55 - here so in this way you can create a
09:57 - text file and write it into the internal
10:00 - storage of your device using Android I
