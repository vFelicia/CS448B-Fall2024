00:00 - hello guys welcome once again in this
00:02 - video I will show you how to use a
00:04 - progress bar using your Visual Basic
00:06 - Windows Form application so let's get
00:09 - started first of all I will go to the
00:11 - toolbox and I will drag and drop a
00:13 - progress bar from here into my form and
00:15 - I will resize it a little and then I
00:20 - will take
00:21 - uh three buttons
00:25 - 1 2 and
00:28 - three
00:30 - and I will take two
00:33 - labels one and two labels and I will
00:38 - take two text
00:40 - boxes so one text box and second text
00:45 - box and first text label name I will
00:50 - change it
00:53 - as increment and second textbox name I
00:57 - will change it
00:58 - as
01:02 - interval okay now what I will do is I
01:06 - will change the text of this uh button
01:11 - first button text
01:15 - is start second button text
01:23 - is stop and the third button text
01:28 - is
01:31 - clear and once again I will go to my
01:34 - toolbox and I will drag and drop a timer
01:37 - from here pick a timer and drop it into
01:41 - my form and you will see this timer will
01:44 - go down and not directly into the form
01:47 - now I will write the code for this start
01:50 - button
01:50 - so just select this timer one and just
01:54 - see the name of this U timer is timer
01:58 - one so I will select the start button
02:01 - and double click it and here I will
02:03 - write timer one which is the name of my
02:05 - timer dot
02:08 - start
02:09 - okay and then once again I will go to
02:13 - the form and I will select the stop
02:16 - button and double click it and I will
02:18 - write timer one dot
02:24 - stop
02:26 - and once again I will go to the form and
02:29 - I will select this clear button and here
02:31 - I will write timer one
02:35 - dot
02:37 - stop and I will
02:41 - write
02:43 - prog progress bar one
02:49 - dot value is equal to Zer so it will
02:54 - clear the progress bar now I will click
02:59 - this time timer one from here and double
03:01 - click it and we go to the timer tick
03:05 - event in here I will
03:11 - write progress
03:14 - bar dot increment so increment we will
03:20 - increment our progress bar whatever
03:24 - value we will give here so just copy the
03:29 - name of this text
03:31 - box and just paste it inside this
03:34 - bracket dot
03:37 - text okay and then in the next line I
03:43 - will
03:46 - write timer
03:50 - 1
03:52 - dot
03:55 - interval and is equal to whatever I will
03:59 - write right in the the text box for
04:02 - Interval which is this text box so this
04:05 - is text box
04:06 - two and and I will say textbox 2 do
04:12 - text so now I think our code is ready
04:16 - let's try and run the
04:18 - code so for example I write it that my
04:24 - timer should increment or my progress
04:27 - bar should increment by the fact VOR of
04:30 - 10 and it should increment every 1
04:34 - second okay so now I start my progress
04:37 - bar and you see here it's increasing
04:42 - very fast let's give the interval of one
04:45 - and and uh increment of one also first
04:49 - of all clear it clear the progress bar
04:52 - and start it once again you see it's
04:55 - incre increment
04:58 - every
05:01 - one increment let's give the interval 10
05:07 - and clear the progress bar and just
05:10 - start it you see and th000 clear the uh
05:16 - progress bar and start progress once
05:20 - again and now it increases every second
05:24 - so this interval is taking the time in
05:28 - Mill second right so 1,000 millisecond
05:32 - is equal to 1 second that's why it's
05:34 - incrementing the time every second now
05:39 - and this is the increment by the factor
05:43 - of 100 so for example you write 50
05:48 - here then once again when you clear
05:52 - it'll go once again 50 and then 100 okay
05:57 - so in this way you can create a progress
05:59 - bar with the help of timers and buttons
