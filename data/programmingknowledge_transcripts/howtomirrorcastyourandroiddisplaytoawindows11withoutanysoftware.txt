00:00 - hey guys in this video i'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can cast or mirror your
00:06 - android screen on your windows 11
00:09 - operating system
00:11 - so let's get started and let's see how
00:13 - we can do it
00:15 - so windows 10 used to have this
00:18 - option or app which was called connect
00:21 - which was available on
00:24 - the windows 10 task bar so when you
00:27 - click on the windows 10 taskbar here it
00:30 - used to be available right but in the
00:33 - windows 11 this connect app is not
00:37 - available by default
00:39 - but you can install this connect app
00:42 - using optional features
00:44 - so first of all we need to install the
00:47 - connect app which is from microsoft only
00:50 - but we need to install it so i'm going
00:52 - to show you how you can install it
00:54 - and then i'm going to show you how you
00:56 - can use this connect app to just mirror
01:00 - or cast your android screen on your
01:01 - windows operating system so you might
01:04 - have observed that when you search for
01:06 - the connect app using the search option
01:10 - and when i
01:11 - just search for
01:13 - connect app
01:15 - i don't see any connect app here right
01:18 - it used to be present in the windows 10
01:21 - operating system
01:22 - but
01:23 - in windows 11 operating system it's not
01:26 - present
01:28 - so let me show you how to fix that
01:30 - so for that you need to open the
01:32 - settings app you can open the settings
01:34 - app by just clicking on your windows
01:36 - start icon
01:37 - and then clicking on the settings
01:40 - or when you click on search option you
01:43 - can search for settings from here also
01:46 - and then click on
01:47 - settings app
01:50 - so once the settings app window opens
01:53 - click on apps here
01:55 - and then click on
01:56 - optional features
01:59 - on the optional features window click on
02:02 - view features
02:04 - and in the view features you will be
02:07 - able to see
02:09 - all these features
02:11 - what you need here is
02:13 - the wireless display feature okay so
02:16 - search for
02:18 - wireless display
02:20 - and once this result appears you just
02:22 - need to check this check box
02:25 - which is around 2.49 megabyte at the
02:28 - time of making this video
02:30 - and then click on next
02:32 - and then click on install
02:34 - which is going to install this wireless
02:37 - display app on your windows 11 operating
02:40 - system so once this app is installed you
02:43 - will be able to see that this app is
02:45 - installed
02:46 - and you will be able to see this app in
02:49 - the installed
02:51 - section also so here you can see
02:53 - installed features
02:55 - and you will be able to see this app in
02:57 - the installed section also
03:00 - so once you see this app in the
03:02 - installed section you can close the
03:04 - settings window and once again try to
03:07 - search for connect app so i'm going to
03:09 - just search for
03:11 - connect app here and this time you will
03:14 - be able to see this connect app right so
03:17 - you can click on this arrow here
03:20 - and you can see this connect app is now
03:22 - available
03:24 - so i can click on open or i can directly
03:26 - click on the connect app here okay
03:30 - so once you click on the connect app you
03:32 - can see
03:33 - my connect app is now open so once you
03:36 - have this connect app
03:39 - what you need to do now is once again
03:42 - you need to click on the search option
03:44 - and then search for
03:46 - projection settings okay so search for
03:49 - projection settings
03:51 - and in here you just need to click on
03:53 - projection settings option
03:55 - which is going to open this
03:57 - window
03:58 - here you need to choose few options
04:01 - right so under this projecting to this
04:04 - pc you need to select all these options
04:07 - here so the first option is some windows
04:09 - and android devices can project to this
04:11 - pc when you allow them to i have set it
04:15 - to available everywhere you can set it
04:18 - to
04:19 - available
04:20 - everywhere on secure network also but i
04:23 - have just chosen
04:25 - available everywhere
04:27 - and the next option is ask to project to
04:30 - this pc
04:31 - i have selected every time
04:33 - our connection is required
04:36 - and then the pin i have set to never you
04:39 - can also set it to first time or always
04:42 - right
04:43 - so
04:44 - these are my settings and when you uh
04:47 - just select always off here you can see
04:50 - this option is disabled and your pc name
04:54 - will be displayed here this pc name will
04:57 - be displayed on the device you want to
05:00 - connect right
05:02 - so now once these settings are done on
05:05 - your pc and you can see your device name
05:08 - will be displayed here
05:10 - you need to go to your android device
05:14 - so different devices have different
05:17 - options which you can choose to mirror
05:20 - or cast your android screen on
05:24 - this connect app
05:26 - so let me show you two devices
05:29 - so on your windows screen when you go to
05:32 - the settings you will see
05:34 - a cast option here or mirror share
05:36 - option here or share option
05:39 - different
05:40 - android devices have different
05:43 - name for the casting or mirroring
05:46 - so what you need to do is just
05:48 - click on the cast option or the mirror
05:51 - option whatever option you see on your
05:53 - android device on my android device i
05:56 - see mirror share option so i'm going to
05:59 - just select the mirror share option here
06:01 - so just click on the mirror share
06:04 - and then you will be able to see all the
06:07 - devices on which you can cast
06:10 - now i have the second device on which i
06:14 - need to go to the settings app here so
06:17 - let me open the settings app
06:19 - and on my other device this option is
06:22 - available under more
06:24 - and when i click on wireless display
06:27 - here
06:28 - i can see my device name which is
06:31 - desktop ph
06:33 - e
06:35 - right this one
06:37 - so on my other device this option is
06:39 - available here
06:41 - so as i said different devices have
06:43 - different options right
06:45 - so whatever device you have you just
06:47 - need to find out what this option is
06:49 - called and once you know what is the
06:51 - name of this option on your device you
06:54 - can always go to that device and then on
06:57 - your android phone search for this
06:59 - device which is uh displayed here so
07:03 - this name will be displayed on your
07:06 - android device so just select the name
07:10 - in my case in my case this name is
07:12 - desktop.phsc658
07:15 - on my android device so i will choose
07:18 - that and as soon as i do that you can
07:20 - see my android screen
07:23 - is displayed on my windows 11 operating
07:26 - system right so this is how you can cast
07:30 - your android screen on your
07:33 - windows 11 operating system now let me
07:36 - mention this once again
07:38 - this doesn't require connecting wire usb
07:42 - cable or any other cable right so this
07:45 - we have done wirelessly the one
07:48 - requirement is you need to be on the
07:50 - same network so both the devices your
07:53 - windows 11 operating system and your
07:56 - phone should be on the same wireless
07:59 - network and then this is going to work
08:02 - so now to disconnect this uh device i
08:05 - just need to go to the settings here
08:08 - and then you can see i can either forget
08:12 - this device or when i just press on this
08:16 - connected device i can see the
08:18 - disconnect option here also so when i
08:20 - press on the disconnect my device will
08:23 - be disconnected from this connect app on
08:26 - my windows 11 operating system so let me
08:29 - show you once again when i press on
08:31 - disconnect you can see
08:33 - my device is no longer connected to my
08:37 - connect app on windows 11 and let me
08:40 - connect once again
08:41 - and you can see once again my android
08:44 - screen is mirrored on my windows 11
08:46 - operating system
08:48 - using this connect app wirelessly right
08:51 - without any software
08:53 - so this is how you can cast or mirror
08:55 - your android screen on your windows 11
08:59 - operating system i hope you've enjoyed
09:01 - this video and i will see you in the
09:03 - next video
