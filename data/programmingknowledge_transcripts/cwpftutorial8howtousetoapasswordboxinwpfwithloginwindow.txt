00:00 - [Music]
00:00 - hello guys in the last video I have
00:03 - shown you how to make a simple login
00:06 - page with the help of your WPF
00:09 - application and site database so I have
00:13 - this uh main window in which I can enter
00:18 - my username and password and when I
00:21 - press this login button it gives me some
00:24 - message whether my password is correct
00:28 - or not right
00:31 - so in this video I will show you because
00:34 - this is a password field and you don't
00:37 - want to show your password to the other
00:40 - users or to the world so you need
00:46 - something like these kind of password
00:50 - and right now when you type your
00:52 - password it's like this so in this video
00:56 - I will show you how to set this field as
00:59 - a password so it will only
01:02 - take these kind of stars or something
01:05 - whatever you
01:06 - set so if you have followed uh my
01:10 - Windows Form application for c tutorial
01:14 - it's a little bit different from uh that
01:17 - so just see how it's done in
01:22 - WPF so now I have this form here and
01:28 - it's name here the text box name of this
01:32 - password field is text password here so
01:36 - what I'm going to do is I will copy this
01:39 - name as it
01:42 - is and I will delete
01:45 - this text box from
01:47 - here and what I will do is I will go to
01:50 - my tech
01:52 - toolbx and in this WPF application there
01:56 - is a
01:57 - special box for the password password
02:00 - field so just go scroll and find this
02:04 - password box from here and I will drag
02:07 - and drop into
02:09 - my main window here once
02:13 - again and now I will give this password
02:17 - box the same name as my previous
02:22 - password box name is so its name is now
02:26 - text
02:27 - password okay so in this this way it
02:30 - will not show the error in this code
02:34 - where we have used that password text
02:37 - box name so just copy this textbox name
02:40 - and drag and drop a password box from
02:44 - your
02:45 - toolbox which is below this menu item so
02:50 - just drag and drop here
02:53 - and then just run your
02:57 - program so I will just run my
03:01 - program it's showing me some error why
03:04 - let's
03:06 - see so here in the error it shows that
03:10 - this password box doesn't contain the
03:14 - definition for this text so what I will
03:16 - do is I will go to the login button
03:21 - event and I will see for the error and
03:24 - right away you can see this password.
03:28 - text is showing me error because this is
03:30 - a password box and this is a text box so
03:34 - with text box it the do text can work
03:39 - but with password box the text extension
03:43 - will not work so what you need to do is
03:47 - just delete this text and write password
03:54 - dot password here so text password do
03:57 - password instead of this do text just
04:00 - change it like password and now when I
04:04 - run my
04:06 - program and I will just enter my
04:10 - username and password and you can
04:14 - see your password field
04:17 - is looking like this which looks like
04:21 - it's uh taking the real password you can
04:25 - change this character right now it's set
04:28 - as this Dot
04:30 - symbol and you can change this character
04:34 - also so just go to your main form main
04:40 - window. xaml file and just select your
04:47 - password password box and go here and go
04:51 - to the properties and search for the
04:54 - password care so this is the password
04:57 - care here and right now it set as dot
05:01 - you can set it like for example this
05:04 - dollar sign and when you run it
05:09 - now and now when you enter your password
05:14 - any
05:14 - password no it's not
05:17 - showing why let's see because I think my
05:22 - password is not set here
05:24 - correctly yes you see here password care
05:28 - is not changed so I need to change it I
05:31 - will just give dollar sign once again
05:34 - and press enter and hopefully this time
05:37 - it will work let's
05:42 - see and I write my usern name and I
05:46 - write my password yes now it's working
05:49 - so you can change this character also
05:52 - according to your
05:53 - convenience so this is also very nice
05:58 - feature of this password walk box and
06:02 - here you can play with more properties
06:06 - you can
06:08 - change lot of properties from here you
06:10 - can change the color text anything so
06:13 - just play with it and you will be good
06:16 - to go so I hope you have enjoyed this
