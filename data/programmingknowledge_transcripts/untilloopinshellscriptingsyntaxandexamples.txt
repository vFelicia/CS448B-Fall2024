00:00 - now in this video I'll be talking about
00:02 - the anti-looper case so already we have
00:04 - covered the for Loop here you can see
00:07 - and the while loop okay so now let's
00:08 - start with the anti-loop okay so before
00:10 - starting let me first tell you about
00:12 - this what what is this how this Loop
00:14 - actually works so anti-loop is basically
00:18 - it works
00:21 - sorry
00:23 - it works until the
00:28 - condition is false
00:31 - condition is false okay so it's quite
00:35 - interesting like it works when until the
00:37 - conditions fall whenever your condition
00:38 - becomes true it you will come out of the
00:41 - loop just like the reverse of the while
00:43 - loop okay so it's just like you if you
00:46 - will say like 2 is greater than 5 so
00:49 - yeah it then in that condition the loop
00:52 - will run if you will say like 6 is
00:54 - greater than 5 now in that condition
00:56 - this Loop will not work like you will
00:58 - come out of the loop okay so I will uh
01:01 - do a visualization for you and I will
01:05 - open up my pane to
01:07 - so I'll show you but before that let me
01:09 - just write the syntax here
01:11 - uh sorry what happened here
01:14 - uh wait a minute guys
01:17 - I will open the paint in different
01:19 - window yeah
01:20 - and I will open up my terminal okay so
01:23 - now let me just create the Syntax for
01:25 - you so the syntax is very easy just like
01:27 - the while loop so you have to just give
01:29 - the until
01:30 - and the whatever the condition you will
01:32 - provide here condition and the do and
01:36 - then here you will write the code
01:39 - and done okay this is the basic syntax
01:42 - and the increment decrement whatever you
01:44 - want to do here you can do like this
01:45 - okay I plus plus or whatever
01:47 - okay so here you can see uh I will just
01:51 - copy of this syntax and I will open up
01:52 - my paint so that will be easy for you to
01:56 - understand so I will take the same
01:58 - example of printing the name and all
02:00 - those things
02:01 - because that will be easy for you to
02:03 - understand okay so here I want to print
02:06 - my the same thing like my name so I will
02:08 - provide the variable I equal to 0 and I
02:10 - should be less than equal to 3 I will
02:13 - choose right now so it will print I
02:15 - think four times
02:17 - and then I will uh increase the
02:21 - increment let I plus plus
02:24 - and here I will write the code
02:27 - uh the code will be like ayush I will
02:30 - just write like this
02:31 - and here what you have to do you have to
02:33 - keep the wrong information like false
02:36 - con condition you have to provide so
02:38 - here I will do like I greater than equal
02:41 - to 3 so here if condition is false then
02:45 - it will execute the this code okay so
02:49 - value of I so I am I am writing like
02:52 - this V of I
02:53 - and then the condition check
02:58 - okay and then
03:01 - increment
03:04 - okay or you I can write like this print
03:06 - also okay so currently value of I is I
03:10 - equal to 0 so
03:12 - 0 greater than equal to 3
03:15 - yes condition is false okay so if false
03:18 - then it will execute so it is right now
03:21 - zero greater than equal to
03:24 - 3 that is keyword false okay so in this
03:27 - case what it will do it will print
03:29 - ayush and the value of I will get
03:30 - increased by one so I will be 1 right
03:34 - now so here again it will check 1 is
03:37 - greater than equal to 3 condition is
03:38 - false so again it will what it will do
03:40 - it will print
03:41 - okay so it will print now condition will
03:43 - increase by one that is now I will
03:45 - become 2 so I equal to 2 so here again 2
03:49 - is greater than equal to 3 so again this
03:51 - condition is false so I usually get
03:53 - printed
03:54 - okay so now I increment by 1 that is I
03:58 - will become 3 so now for I equal to 3 so
04:00 - 3 greater than equal to 3
04:02 - yes condition is uh like uh
04:06 - false it will be false okay and I
04:09 - usually get printed and increment by
04:11 - what now I equal to 4 so 4 is greater
04:15 - than equal to
04:16 - 3 yeah condition is now true so now you
04:20 - will come out of the Loop okay so in
04:23 - this way until it basically just the
04:25 - opposite of Y Loop like if condition is
04:27 - for the loop will execute otherwise not
04:31 - so let me just uh do with this uh
04:35 - what you can see what you can say like
04:39 - run this loop I will provide the I equal
04:41 - to 0
04:42 - and I will use until Loop until
04:45 - condition will be
04:47 - dollar of I is only greater than if I
04:51 - use a greater than equal to
04:53 - 3 so in this case do
04:57 - equal
05:01 - ayush okay and just do it done here
05:06 - and you have to just increment the value
05:09 - of I also okay now we are good to go I
05:13 - will just give the appropriate
05:14 - permission to this file
05:17 - 14 okay dot slash 14 and we got some
05:22 - kind of error here
05:24 - line number 21 Centex error
05:30 - okay
05:31 - okay here I do
05:35 - semicolon let me just check now
05:38 - unexpected End of Line
05:43 - let me just check the syntax like I
05:45 - equal to 0 until dollar of I is greater
05:48 - than equal to 3 do equal I use and then
05:52 - let I plus plus and I have done here
05:59 - I haven't done a right to and done
06:06 - okay uh so
06:08 - here you can see we have not comment out
06:10 - this so let me just comment it and again
06:12 - I will run this script
06:13 - let me just clear the screen and Dot
06:16 - slash 14 yeah so here you can see uh the
06:20 - loop has been executed
06:21 - that is greater than equal to Phi I will
06:24 - do so it will run five times four times
06:27 - I think
06:29 - let me just clear the screen
06:31 - okay the three times I is greater than
06:33 - equal to 3 okay it will run only three
06:35 - times okay I'm sorry for for here like
06:39 - here here like condition will get true
06:42 - yeah condition will get true here
06:44 - because it will be equal to three
06:46 - so in this case it will come out of the
06:48 - loop and there will be no further check
06:50 - okay so it will print only
06:52 - three times okay
06:55 - so uh now what I will do I will let me
06:57 - just try uh what you can say we can
07:00 - print the table okay
07:02 - so you can print the table of any number
07:06 - like if you want to print the table of
07:07 - five okay
07:10 - so you can do like this uh you can write
07:15 - the expression here like whatever the
07:18 - expression you write like dollar
07:20 - let me just write for you
07:23 - I will just dollar
07:26 - parenthesis and you have to provide the
07:29 - number that is the any number 5 into and
07:33 - you will do like this dollar I
07:36 - and here just to 0 and here you provide
07:39 - 10 okay
07:42 - and I hope it should run
07:45 - so here you can see uh now we will start
07:48 - with the one okay
07:51 - so let's check so here you can see and
07:54 - here we need to do 11.
07:59 - okay so here in this way you can print
08:01 - the table of any number also you can do
08:04 - your customize changes like you can take
08:07 - input from the user and then passing
08:09 - that value here and then give the result
08:11 - and the terminal okay so I hope you
08:14 - liked it guys and you got to know about
08:16 - the antelope and I will post all the
08:18 - source codes of this particular video in
08:21 - our GitHub repository you can access
08:22 - from there and I will provide the link
08:24 - also in our description
08:26 - okay so that's all for today's and I
08:28 - will meet you in the next video so thank
08:30 - you for watching bye
