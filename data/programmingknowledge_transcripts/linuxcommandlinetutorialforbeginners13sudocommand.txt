00:00 - hello guys welcome to the ranks video on
00:02 - linux command line tutorial for
00:03 - beginners in this video we will learn
00:05 - how we can use sudo command in linux so
00:10 - first of all what is a sudo command you
00:14 - can say sudo is the command which rules
00:18 - them all the abbreviation or full form
00:22 - of sudo is super user do so it allows
00:27 - you to some extra privileges as an
00:32 - administrator or a power user so let's
00:36 - see how we can use a pseudo in Linux now
00:40 - first of all I'm going to open the
00:42 - terminal and right now we are in our
00:46 - home folder right by default
00:50 - now for example I will first of all list
00:54 - out all the directory which are in the
00:57 - root directory so we'll just to LS and
01:01 - then this forward slash now for example
01:04 - I want to make a directory inside this
01:08 - etc' folder so what I'm going to do is
01:12 - I'm just to see Det see and here I want
01:18 - to create some directory for example so
01:20 - this etc' directory contains some of the
01:25 - configuration files and other files you
01:27 - can see and let's say I want to create a
01:30 - directory for me for some purpose right
01:34 - so I will just use mkdir which we have
01:38 - already seen that this is the command
01:40 - and for example I will say new there for
01:46 - new directory ok and I will press enter
01:49 - and now this gives me this error that
01:54 - mkdir creates a direct here new there
01:57 - which doesn't have permission so it's
02:00 - showing the permission denied error this
02:04 - is because for example on my Ubuntu
02:09 - Linux operating system by default when I
02:12 - the terminal it doesn't have the
02:15 - administrative or root privileges so we
02:19 - need to use a special command which is
02:22 - called sudo in order to tell this Linux
02:26 - terminal that we want to execute this
02:29 - command as an administrator right so
02:33 - let's see how we can use it so whenever
02:37 - you see permission denied most cases of
02:42 - permission denied can be solved by this
02:45 - sudo command
02:47 - because sudo allows us to run any
02:52 - command or most of the command using
02:55 - administrative privilege or super user
02:58 - privilege okay so let's see we will just
03:03 - give the same command but this time we
03:06 - will just add a sudo in front of this
03:09 - command right so sudo mkdir new
03:13 - directory which is the name of the
03:14 - directory and what this command does is
03:18 - first of all when I and press enter is
03:22 - going to ask me the password for my
03:25 - computer it's the same password which
03:27 - you provide at the time of login right
03:30 - so I'm going to provide my password and
03:33 - this password will not be shown on the
03:36 - terminal it will be hidden but you just
03:39 - need to type your password and then
03:40 - press Enter and you can see here this
03:45 - sudo this mkdir command is executed with
03:50 - sudo or super user privileges and
03:54 - because you have already provided the
03:56 - password once now you don't need to
03:59 - provide the password in the same session
04:02 - in the terminal right so let's see if
04:07 - this directory is created or not this
04:09 - time we didn't see any permission denied
04:13 - error and most probably it will create
04:17 - this new dear directory so let's see if
04:22 - it's created or not
04:24 - so let's search for new deer and
04:29 - hopefully we will be able to find this
04:33 - directory this is here so you can see
04:37 - this new directory is created so super
04:41 - user command allows you to execute some
04:45 - command which with the superuser
04:48 - privileges right now whenever we will
04:52 - you know learn how to install some
04:55 - third-party software something like GCC
04:59 - or G + + or any other libraries which we
05:03 - may require to perform some tasks most
05:08 - probably it will ask you for this super
05:11 - user privileges for example there are
05:14 - some command in Linux most of the time
05:18 - in Debian operating systems that you can
05:22 - give apt-get install command so have to
05:27 - get install and the name of the software
05:31 - which we want to install for example you
05:33 - want to install GCC you will just give
05:37 - GCC or for example C++ or any other
05:41 - software for example but this apt-get
05:46 - install command you know ask you most of
05:50 - the time whenever you are installing
05:52 - some software this is super user
05:54 - privileges so you just need to add sudo
05:56 - in front of it and then give your
05:58 - password so that this software or
06:02 - library can be installed on your system
06:05 - right so sudo is forgiving the
06:08 - administrative privileges right now for
06:12 - example I will open the next terminal
06:15 - you whenever you press control shift T
06:19 - is going to open the new terminal as a
06:22 - second tab so I have the first term and
06:24 - second tab so ctrl shift T will open the
06:27 - next
06:29 - tab now whenever I will give sudo - s
06:35 - and then press ENTER and I will give the
06:39 - password here once again which will not
06:41 - be shown by the way on the terminal and
06:43 - press Enter
06:44 - you can see earlier I was having the
06:49 - user privileges which is the name of my
06:53 - PC but now I have the root privileges so
06:57 - it changes to the root user and then you
07:01 - can see the asterisks here right this
07:05 - not Asterix but this hash symbol here
07:08 - which means you are now in super user
07:12 - mode so you can easily you know do
07:17 - anything as a super user okay so
07:21 - whenever you will give sudo - s you will
07:24 - go into the super user mode
07:27 - automatically and that now you can
07:30 - execute any command using a super user
07:34 - as yourself right now this is the small
07:40 - introduction for sudo su has many
07:42 - capabilities which we are going to learn
07:45 - slowly when we learn more about legs and
07:50 - more commands and then we will see
07:52 - slowly how it can be used in more
07:56 - efficient way so this was just a brief
07:59 - introduction how you can use sudo so I
