00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:01 - you how you can download and install
00:03 - node.js on your windows 11 operating
00:05 - system so let's get started and let's
00:07 - see how we can do it so first of all
00:09 - open your favorite browser and search
00:11 - for node.js and the first link which
00:13 - will appear here will be from nodejs.org
00:16 - so we are going to click on this link
00:19 - and once you reach to the main webpage
00:22 - of node.js.org you will see two versions
00:27 - first version will be the LTS version
00:30 - and the other version will be the latest
00:33 - and greatest current version
00:36 - so I'm going to download the LTS version
00:39 - because support for this will be longer
00:42 - so I am going to click on
00:46 - 18.15.0 LTS which is the latest version
00:50 - at the time of making this video so let
00:52 - me click on this button which is going
00:54 - to download this MSI file and once this
00:57 - file is downloaded let me just click on
01:00 - this file and let me minimize my browser
01:03 - and you will see this kind of window
01:05 - which is the node.js setup window so I'm
01:09 - going to click on next here
01:11 - and this is the license terms and
01:13 - conditions just to check this checkbox
01:15 - and then click on next
01:17 - this will be the default location where
01:19 - node.js will be installed so if you
01:22 - don't have the good reason to change
01:23 - this location just leave it as default
01:25 - and then click on next
01:26 - and at this point also you can just
01:29 - leave everything as default and then
01:31 - click on next
01:33 - here you can see tools for Native
01:36 - modules
01:38 - so here if you check this check box it's
01:41 - going to automatically install the
01:43 - necessary tools and also it says note
01:47 - that this will also install chocolaty
01:49 - and chocolaty is a very good utility
01:53 - which allows you to install various
01:55 - different tools on your Windows
01:57 - operating system so if it installs
02:00 - chocolaty it will be good so I'm okay
02:03 - with that so I'm going to check this
02:05 - checkbox and then click on next
02:07 - and then click on install here which is
02:09 - going to install a node.js but first of
02:13 - all you will see this kind of prompt
02:14 - which says do you want to allow this app
02:16 - to make changes on your device I will
02:17 - click on yes
02:19 - which starts the installation and it
02:22 - will finish the installation really fast
02:23 - so just wait for few seconds and after
02:26 - some time you will see this message
02:28 - which says completed the node.js setup
02:31 - and node.js has been successfully
02:34 - installed so I can click on finish and
02:36 - node.js is installed on my windows 11
02:39 - operating system
02:41 - now here
02:43 - there is this uh command prompt which is
02:46 - open I can press any key on my keyboard
02:49 - and here it's going to install the
02:53 - additional tools because I have checked
02:56 - that check box to install the additional
02:58 - tool for node.js and then I will click
03:00 - on yes which is going to start the
03:03 - process of installing those additional
03:05 - tools in the meantime those additional
03:07 - tools are being installed we can even
03:10 - check the node.js installation so I am
03:13 - going to just
03:16 - click on the search icon or I can just
03:18 - click on the
03:20 - Windows start icon and then click on all
03:24 - apps here
03:26 - and then I will search for node.js
03:29 - I will scroll down and I will search for
03:33 - node.js you can see this node.js
03:36 - folder has been created I will click on
03:39 - this and you can see uh install
03:42 - additional tools for node.js which is
03:44 - already running
03:45 - there is this node.js command prompt so
03:48 - node.js comes with its own command
03:50 - prompt so I can click on this command
03:53 - prompt and it will open
03:55 - node.js rapper and it will open this
03:59 - command line here I can change the
04:01 - properties of this command line
04:04 - to make the fonts little bit bigger so
04:06 - we can see all these commands
04:09 - and I can click on OK
04:11 - and here I can just write a node here
04:14 - and press enter and you can see it says
04:17 - welcome to the node.js so version 18.5.0
04:21 - which is the version which we have
04:22 - installed
04:23 - you can also write
04:26 - console DOT log and then log a message
04:30 - here for example hello
04:33 - World here and then close the
04:35 - parenthesis and then provide the
04:39 - semicolon and then press enter it prints
04:41 - hello world which means that node.js is
04:44 - working fine on my Windows operating
04:46 - system you can even open the node.js in
04:50 - your command prompt so I can just write
04:51 - CMD in the search option here and then
04:55 - click on the command prompt and then I
04:58 - will just type node and then press enter
04:59 - and it also opens the node rapid stands
05:04 - for read a well print Loop which is
05:06 - nothing but ah this interactive session
05:10 - where you can give the node.js commands
05:14 - and get the output right so I can just
05:17 - say cost a is equal to 10 plus 20
05:22 - and it will give me the answer when I
05:25 - just ask for it so I just write a and it
05:29 - gives me 30 right
05:31 - so this is also working so you can use
05:33 - the native command prompt or you can
05:37 - even use node.js command prompt or you
05:40 - can use the Powershell on your Windows
05:42 - operating system so I can again search
05:45 - for Powershell let me just open
05:49 - Powershell
05:51 - and in Powershell also this will work in
05:55 - a same way so let the Powershell open
06:00 - and once that opens I can just write
06:03 - node and then I can just
06:06 - write console DOT log and then
06:11 - hello for example
06:13 - and it prints hello so you can use the
06:17 - node
06:18 - rapple from your Powershell command line
06:21 - or the tool which comes with node.js
06:25 - also you can see it's installing the
06:28 - essential packages for
06:30 - your node.js and let this window be
06:36 - opened until this command is finished
06:39 - but these are the additional tools right
06:41 - node.js is already installed on our
06:44 - Windows operating system
06:47 - now let us say you want to create a
06:49 - node.js server very simple server to
06:52 - test whether it's working or not so go
06:56 - to any folder where you want to create
06:59 - your file so I'm going to create my file
07:03 - in documents here and let me create a
07:06 - new folder with the name test for
07:10 - example right so generally when you
07:12 - write node.js code you use some kind of
07:15 - IDE or editor for example Visual Studio
07:17 - code or atom editor or any other IDE
07:23 - which is specifically made for node.js
07:27 - code but for now ah let us say if you
07:31 - don't have anything then also you can
07:34 - test node.js application
07:36 - so go to the folder and then right click
07:39 - and create a text file so I'm going to
07:41 - create a new text file here and right
07:45 - now I can see that there is no extension
07:48 - visible for this file so here you can
07:51 - just click on this view option and then
07:53 - click on show and then click on file
07:56 - extensions which is going to show you
07:58 - the file extension right now it's a txt
08:00 - file let me just rename it for example
08:05 - test and the extension I am going to
08:07 - give here is dot JS file so test dot Js
08:12 - and then click on yes here is going to
08:15 - create this Javascript file and then you
08:19 - can open this file using any editor I am
08:23 - going to open this with let's say
08:25 - Notepad
08:26 - and then click on OK
08:29 - and then I am going to just copy the
08:34 - very simple node.js code which is even
08:36 - available on the
08:39 - node.js.org website this is the
08:42 - simple server which you can create
08:45 - in node.js so I am going to just copy
08:48 - this code and then paste it here and
08:51 - then save it and then close this file
08:54 - so once your Javascript file is created
08:56 - just copy this path and then you can
08:59 - open the command prompt or Powershell or
09:01 - any other tool so I'm going to open the
09:03 - command prompt here
09:05 - and then I'm going to CD inside this
09:08 - folder so CD and the path you have
09:11 - copied just paste it there and then
09:13 - press enter
09:14 - and here you can just write node and the
09:17 - name of your file so my file name is
09:19 - test.js I'm going to provide that and
09:22 - then press enter and it's going to
09:24 - start the node.js server because what
09:28 - this code is doing inside this
09:30 - Javascript file is it's just
09:33 - creating a very simple node.js server
09:36 - and it's running it on Port 3000 right
09:40 - so when you open this URL which is
09:45 - essentially localhost
09:47 - at Port 3000 so let me just go to the
09:51 - browser open this URL
09:55 - it's going to show me Hello World here
09:58 - okay
09:59 - so our node.js
10:01 - is working fine and now you can start
10:07 - using node.js on your windows 11
10:09 - operating system so this is how you can
10:11 - download and install node.js on your
10:13 - windows 11 operating system I hope
10:15 - you've enjoyed this video and I will see
10:17 - you in the next video
