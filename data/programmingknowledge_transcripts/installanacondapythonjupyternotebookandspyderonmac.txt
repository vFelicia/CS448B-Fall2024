00:10 - all what is anaconda so anaconda is a
00:12 - free and open source distribution of
00:15 - Python and our programming languages for
00:17 - scientific computing such as data
00:20 - science machine learning applications
00:22 - and large-scale data processing etc now
00:26 - anaconda comes with really nice tools
00:29 - such as Jupiter notebook and spider
00:31 - which are really easy and convenient to
00:34 - use and nowadays anaconda is also used
00:37 - by beginners to start learning Python so
00:41 - let's see how we can download and

01:11 - Mac operating system so automatically
01:14 - this option will be selected which is
01:15 - Mac and then here you will see two
01:18 - options one is Python 3.7 version and

02:39 - then click continue and here you can see
02:42 - a 2.2 GB of space will be taken on my
02:44 - computer so I will just say install
02:47 - which is going to start the installation
02:49 - of anaconda on my Mac operating system
02:52 - so now I will wait for the installation
02:54 - to complete so now the installation of
02:57 - anaconda is complete on my Mac operating
03:00 - system and now you will see this window
03:02 - which will ask you if you want to
03:04 - download and install Microsoft Visual
03:07 - Studio code on your Mac operating system
03:10 - or not so I already have Visual Studio
03:12 - code on my Mac operating system so I
03:14 - will skip this step and I'm going to
03:17 - click on continue which is going to show
03:19 - me the summary and then I'm going to
03:22 - click on the close which is going to
03:24 - close this window and move this
03:28 - Installer to the Thresh so I'm going to
03:30 - just click on move to Thresh and now
03:33 - once anaconda distribution is installed
03:35 - on our Mac operating system we can just
03:37 - click on launch pad icon and then you
03:41 - will be able to see the Anaconda
03:43 - Navigator I can here so I'm going to
03:45 - click on the Anaconda navigator icon it
03:48 - is going to start the Anaconda navigator
03:51 - and using this Anaconda navigator we
03:54 - will be able to launch Jupiter notebook
03:58 - or spider IDE so now you can see
04:01 - anaconda Navigator is launched and I'm
04:04 - going to first of all click on ok here
04:06 - and you will be able to see these icons
04:09 - so here you can find some tools which
04:11 - comes pre-installed with your anaconda
04:14 - distribution and these tools are Jupiter
04:17 - lab notebook QT console Spyder Lewis or
04:22 - orange 3 tool now there are some tools
04:26 - which you
04:27 - also install which is our studio or a
04:30 - visual studio code so you will be able
04:33 - to see in this install button under the
04:36 - tool which you want to install or if
04:38 - it's already installed you will be able
04:40 - to see this kind of Launch button
04:43 - so let's first launch the jupiter
04:46 - notebook using this anaconda navigator
04:48 - so i'm going to click on the launch
04:50 - button which is going to open the
04:52 - command prompt first of all and after
04:54 - some time it's going to launch the
04:57 - jupiter notebook on your default browser
05:01 - so now i can see this jupiter notebook
05:04 - is launched on the safari browser which
05:07 - is my default browser and let's say i
05:09 - want to go to the desktop first of all
05:12 - and here let's say i want to create a
05:14 - new folder so i'm going to click on new
05:16 - here and then i'm going to just click on
05:18 - folder and this folder is first of all
05:22 - untitled folder so i'm going to just
05:25 - click on untitled folder and once i'm in
05:28 - this untitled folder what I'm going to
05:31 - do is I'm going to select Python 3 here
05:33 - which is going to open the new notebook
05:37 - on the next tab which is going to launch
05:41 - that Jupiter notebook on the next tab so
05:44 - now from here I can change or give the
05:46 - name to my notebook so let's say I want
05:49 - to just say this is my first notebook so
05:53 - I'm going to just say first and then
05:55 - click on rename which is going to rename
05:57 - this notebook now in here I can give
06:00 - some commands so for example I want to
06:02 - just test whether it's working or not so
06:05 - I'm going to just write 2 plus 2 and
06:07 - then press Enter you can see by pressing
06:10 - enter it's not going to give you the
06:12 - result but when you press shift enter
06:15 - it's going to print the output and give
06:18 - you the next cell so this is how it
06:21 - works
06:21 - so whenever you want to execute some
06:24 - command or statement you just need to
06:27 - write that command so for example I'm
06:29 - going to just write a equals 3 and then
06:33 - press ENTER and let's say I want to
06:35 - print the value of a so I'm going to
06:38 - just write print a
06:41 - and then press shift enter which is
06:44 - going to print the value of a which is
06:46 - three so this is how you can open and
06:49 - use Jupiter notebook now let's see how
06:52 - we can launch the spyder IDE so I'm
06:55 - going to go to the Anaconda navigator
06:58 - once again and then I'm going to go to
07:01 - the spider icon and then click on the
07:04 - launch button which is going to launch
07:06 - the spider IDE so now you can see spider
07:09 - IDE has been started and here also we
07:12 - are going to just try to do something
07:15 - with pythons statement so I'm going to
07:18 - just write two plus two and in order to
07:20 - execute this command you just need to
07:22 - select select this line and then press
07:24 - shift enter which is going to execute
07:27 - this statement on the console which you
07:30 - can see on the right-hand bottom side
07:32 - here also if you want to execute a
07:35 - command you can directly execute it on
07:38 - the console here so you can just write
07:40 - two plus two and it's going to show you
07:42 - the result in order to import some
07:45 - package for example I want to just
07:47 - import numpy so I'm going to just write
07:50 - import numpy as NP and then press Enter
07:55 - we're just going to import the numpy
07:57 - module into the console so now you can
08:02 - use this numpy to just test whatever you
08:05 - want to do so let me just close this
08:08 - spider IDE and I want to show you one
08:12 - more thing so if you open the terminal
08:15 - after installing the anaconda you can
08:17 - also check for the Conda command if it's
08:20 - working or not so first of all what is
08:23 - Conda so Conda is an open source
08:25 - cross-platform language agnostic package
08:29 - management system which we can use with
08:32 - the anaconda distribution so in order to
08:36 - check whether Conda is working fine you
08:38 - can just right Conda info and then press
08:41 - Enter it's going to show you the
08:44 - information about the Kahn diversion so
08:47 - you can see condo version which is
08:48 - installed right now is four point five
08:51 - point eleven at the time of making this
08:52 - video
08:54 - now if you want to launch the Jupiter
08:57 - notebook or spider from the terminal you
09:01 - can also do that so let me open a new
09:03 - terminal by right-clicking on the
09:05 - terminal icon and then press on new
09:07 - window and once this terminal is open in
09:11 - order to start spider I can just write
09:13 - spider and then press ENTER and this
09:17 - command is going to start the spider IDE
09:20 - let me open one more terminal and let me
09:24 - show you what is the command to open the
09:28 - Jupiter notebook so in order to open the
09:31 - Jupiter notebook you can just write
09:33 - Jupiter notebook but right now you can
09:35 - see the spider IDE is initializing right
09:39 - now so let's open the Jupiter notebook
09:43 - also by the command line so just write
09:45 - Jupiter
09:47 - notebook here and then press Enter which
09:50 - is going to start the Jupiter notebook
09:52 - in your default browser which is Safari
09:55 - in my case so you can see the spider ID
09:59 - is started using the command line and
10:02 - also the Jupiter notebook will start
10:05 - after some time in your default browser
10:07 - so you can see this spider IDE has been
10:11 - started and I will wait for the Jupiter
10:14 - notebook to start so now you can see
10:16 - Jupiter notebook is also started on a
10:19 - safari so in this way also you can open
10:22 - the Jupiter notebook and spider IDE
10:25 - using the Mac terminal so this is how
10:30 - you can download and install and use
10:32 - anaconda distribution on your Mac
10:35 - operating system I hope you have enjoyed
10:37 - this video and I will see you in the
10:39 - next
10:47 - you
