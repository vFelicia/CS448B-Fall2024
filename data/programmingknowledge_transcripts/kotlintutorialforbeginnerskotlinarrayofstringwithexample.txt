00:00 - in the previous video we have discussed
00:01 - about arrays in kotlin and in this
00:04 - particular video we are going to
00:07 - learn about
00:08 - areas of string
00:10 - okay or an area of strings
00:13 - so
00:14 - i'll just go ahead and create a main
00:17 - function
00:18 - and inside the main function i will just
00:21 - create a variable
00:24 - string named string array
00:27 - and
00:28 - so if you remember for creating an array
00:32 - we have to use
00:33 - array of function and
00:36 - if
00:38 - we have to
00:39 - specify the data types we will use the
00:42 - less than and greater than sign and then
00:44 - we will use the open and close
00:46 - parenthesis and inside the open close
00:48 - parenthesis
00:49 - uh we will
00:51 - use the
00:55 - the the things that we have to add to
00:57 - this
00:58 - okay so uh i'll just create a string the
01:01 - array of string
01:04 - containing some strings so i'll just
01:06 - write hi
01:08 - this
01:09 - and again a string
01:11 - is
01:13 - and again string
01:16 - programming
01:20 - knowledge
01:22 - okay
01:23 - so
01:24 - it is a string
01:25 - [Music]
01:27 - it is an area of string containing four
01:29 - strings
01:32 - okay
01:33 - so specifically it is called an area of
01:35 - strings
01:36 - so what if i have to get a particular
01:42 - at a particular index
01:44 - so what if i have to get the string at a
01:46 - particular index so i can use a
01:48 - function
01:51 - that is
01:52 - the name of string that is string array
01:55 - and then dot
01:58 - get
02:00 - and then open and close parenthesis and
02:02 - then zero
02:04 - okay
02:04 - so what this
02:07 - function get does it does
02:09 - that
02:10 - it just
02:12 - gets the
02:14 - particular string at the particular
02:16 - index mentioned
02:18 - so when it shows a
02:20 - green line so when i go to it and hit
02:24 - alt plus enter
02:26 - it
02:26 - shows that replace get call with
02:28 - indexing operator and when i hit enter
02:30 - it
02:32 - chooses the
02:34 - open and close square box
02:37 - square bracket
02:38 - so the get function is the same as the
02:41 - square bracket that we used in the
02:42 - previous video
02:44 - okay so now if i just skip that
02:48 - and
02:51 - okay
02:53 - and uh
02:55 - so what if i have to change the
02:59 - change the string at a particular index
03:01 - so as i mentioned in the previous video
03:04 - what i have to do is
03:06 - write the name of the string
03:08 - that is
03:09 - write the name of the array
03:11 - and then
03:13 - use the square bracket
03:15 - and
03:16 - if i have to change the
03:18 - string at the zero index
03:22 - so i'll just
03:25 - write here
03:27 - hola
03:29 - okay so
03:31 - it changes the
03:34 - string at the zeroth index okay
03:37 - so when i
03:39 - print
03:42 - the
03:44 - string array
03:46 - what it does is
03:49 - so what happens when i print the whole
03:53 - array instead of printing a particular
03:56 - particular
03:57 - index of the array so it prints the this
04:00 - thing
04:01 - it prints l java lang string
04:05 - semicolon and this is an address
04:08 - so when i string when i print a
04:09 - particular array
04:11 - it it it shows that it is an array of
04:15 - containing strings and it shows its
04:17 - address
04:18 - that at this address the string is
04:20 - stored
04:21 - but it does not print that array
04:24 - so i'll just go ahead and print the
04:27 - zeroth element
04:29 - or the a string at element at index 0
04:34 - so we can see that
04:36 - the
04:37 - string at particular index
04:39 - has changed now what if i have to
04:43 - get the
04:45 - size of a particular array so for
04:47 - getting the size of a particular array
04:49 - is
04:50 - we use the function
04:51 - dot size
04:53 - so i will just
04:54 - print write the print statement
04:57 - and then i'll write the string name
05:00 - sorry the array name and
05:02 - i'll just write dot size
05:06 - now when i run this
05:08 - program
05:09 - this the seventh line
05:12 - prints the size of an array
05:14 - okay and we can see that the size of an
05:17 - array is
05:19 - size of this array is four
05:24 - so that's correct
05:26 - now what if i have to
05:29 - make a whole string from an array of
05:32 - string
05:33 - like i have to
05:35 - make this a particular string so i'll
05:38 - just
05:39 - name a value
05:41 - that should be
05:43 - string
05:45 - and
05:46 - make that equal to so i'll just write
05:48 - the
05:51 - array name
05:52 - and
05:53 - i'll just
05:55 - type the
05:57 - function that is content to string
06:01 - now
06:02 - the string
06:04 - variable
06:05 - is a string that contains the
06:09 - the
06:10 - the content of the string array
06:12 - converted to a string
06:14 - okay so content to string is a function
06:18 - that converts
06:19 - an array to an string
06:22 - now let's go ahead and
06:24 - print this
06:26 - string
06:28 - okay so when i run this function
06:37 - it prints hola this is programming
06:39 - knowledge but it shows that as an array
06:43 - why
06:45 - because we have converted it to string
06:46 - and string should be
06:48 - the value string should be an string
06:52 - so it isn't string but
06:54 - when i print this and also we can note
06:57 - that
06:58 - i have left spaces here so it also
07:00 - leaves spaces here
07:02 - so whatever i not leave spaces here
07:05 - so it automatically detects that
07:08 - that it should be a string with four
07:10 - different words or four different string
07:14 - so it automatically leaves the
07:16 - spaces out of there
07:18 - so when i
07:20 - want to print a particular string
07:22 - particular array of string
07:25 - so i'll just
07:27 - instead of doing all this i'll just
07:31 - write the print statement
07:34 - and in the print statement i'll write
07:35 - the string name and then content to
07:38 - string
07:39 - so when i write
07:41 - only the string array
07:43 - it does not print the
07:45 - array it prints that this is an array
07:47 - and it contains it contains string and
07:49 - the location of the array is this the
07:52 - location at which the arrow is stored is
07:54 - this
07:55 - so for printing the whole string array
07:58 - we use this
08:00 - okay so that's all for this video stay
08:02 - tuned
