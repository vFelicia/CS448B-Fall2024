00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Android app development for
00:04 - beginners in this video and the next
00:07 - video we are going to see how to create
00:10 - a simple login app using Android studio
00:14 - now I decided to break this login app in
00:17 - two videos because uh if I show it in
00:20 - one video this video can be a really
00:23 - lendy and boring so uh let's get started
00:27 - in this first video of uh this login app
00:30 - we are going to design our login uh
00:34 - application and we are going to set up
00:36 - all the resources and in the next video
00:39 - we are going to see how to uh write the
00:43 - backend code for this
00:45 - application so let's get started I have
00:48 - opened my Android studio and we are
00:50 - going to create a new Android uh Studio
00:54 - project and in here we are going to name
00:57 - our application for example
01:02 - simple
01:03 - login app okay and now I'm going to
01:08 - click next and we are going to make this
01:11 - project for uh phone and tablets and
01:13 - make sure whatever version you uh choose
01:17 - here minimum SD it covers 100% of
01:20 - devices here click next and we are going
01:24 - to choose the blank Activity Click next
01:27 - and the activity name we are going to
01:30 - give is login okay
01:35 - so login activity okay now I'm going to
01:39 - finish my so now our project is uh set
01:43 - up uh and now uh this is the first
01:47 - activity we uh can see here which is
01:50 - login activity now I'm going to create
01:53 - one more activity so that we can
01:56 - redirect uh the user if he provides uh
02:00 - valid login and password so that uh it's
02:03 - can be a you know user activity so that
02:07 - he can access some some screen or some
02:11 - activity after login so now now what I'm
02:15 - going to do is I'm going to create a new
02:18 - activity and I will name it as user
02:21 - activity so in your app just go to this
02:24 - resources folder or Rees folder and
02:28 - inside this you will be able to see this
02:30 - folder called layout I'm going to right
02:33 - click this folder and I'm going to
02:35 - create a new activity here and this
02:39 - activity will also be a blank activity
02:42 - and this activity I will name it
02:46 - as user activity okay and I will finish
02:50 - this so now we have two activities one
02:54 - is login which we will use to uh create
02:58 - our login page and the other is user
03:03 - activity which will open after uh you
03:07 - know authentication of the user okay now
03:12 - uh what we are going to do is uh let's
03:16 - go to this uh activity user. XML and see
03:21 - the path or the context of uh this
03:25 - activity you can see here so what we are
03:28 - going to do is in our manifest folder so
03:31 - in the app folder there will be a folder
03:35 - called manifests and inside this folder
03:38 - there will be a XML file called Android
03:41 - manifest file okay Android manifest.xml
03:44 - file I will click this and here you can
03:48 - see your both Activity one is our main
03:52 - activity or the launcher activity and
03:55 - the other is our user
03:57 - activity so in here what we are going to
04:00 - do is we are going to set up the intent
04:03 - filter for the second activity also in
04:06 - uh our first activity which is uh login
04:09 - activity this intent filter is already
04:11 - there right but in this um user activity
04:16 - you can see only the name is there and
04:17 - the label is there but there is no
04:20 - intent filter okay so we are just going
04:23 - to copy this uh intent filter tag from
04:27 - our login activity and we will go to
04:29 - this uh user activity which we have just
04:33 - created and paste this intent filter
04:36 - here now there can only be one launch uh
04:40 - activity for your uh app right so the
04:43 - second activity will be a default
04:46 - activity launcher activity means that
04:49 - the first activity which will appear is
04:52 - this launcher activity which is our
04:54 - login activity now the user activity is
04:57 - our default activity and this we are
05:00 - going to open whenever we uh you know
05:05 - authenticate uh the user right and the
05:09 - name of this activity uh will be the
05:13 - content name of this uh second activity
05:17 - so go to your activity unor user. XML
05:21 - file and in here you can copy this path
05:24 - from here which will be com dot uh
05:28 - whatever your path you have given here
05:30 - com do something. something. user right
05:34 - so just copy it here go to the Android
05:36 - manifest.xml file and paste it here in
05:41 - the action Android colon name is equal
05:45 - to and in the quotes you just paste this
05:48 - path
05:49 - here now we have um successfully set up
05:53 - uh our second activity now we are going
05:57 - to design our first login activity here
06:01 - so what we are going to do is in here we
06:04 - will uh uh pick and place some text
06:09 - views and added views so that uh you
06:12 - know user can enter his uh login
06:28 - credentials
07:28 - so now our
07:29 - design part is almost complete we are
07:33 - going to do one more uh thing which is
07:36 - transferring our all string constant to
07:40 - the string.xml
07:42 - file so uh in your app folder there will
07:47 - be a folder called values here in the
07:50 - resources folder so go to resources or
07:52 - RDS folder and there will be a folder
07:55 - called values and inside this values
07:58 - there will be a folder called
07:59 - strings.xml file and in here you can
08:03 - Define all your all your string constant
08:06 - and it's a good practice to uh you know
08:09 - transfer all your string constant here
08:12 - so that you can easily find them right
08:17 - so what we are going to do is uh once uh
08:21 - you have done designing your app you can
08:25 - uh just go to this content tree and in
08:28 - here on every uh you know text View and
08:33 - other uh button you can see a small
08:36 - little warning yellow uh light and when
08:40 - you click this you will be able to see a
08:42 - small little button or bulb here and
08:46 - just click this bulb and this bulb says
08:49 - hardcoded string login page should use
08:53 - string resource so uh Android studio
08:57 - also gives us uh the option to you know
09:00 - Define all the string constant in our
09:03 - string XML so just click this um um
09:07 - message here and then it will open your
09:11 - extract resources file and file name
09:14 - here is strings.xml
09:16 - and in here you can uh name your
09:20 - resource so this text page is our text
09:24 - right so you can just name it as login
09:32 - underscore text so it's just a ID for
09:37 - your string okay and once you done with
09:41 - that you can click okay okay so for the
09:46 - first time it can show the warning like
09:48 - this rendering problem could not resolve
09:51 - a resource but when you do the same for
09:56 - other other stuff like this one uh
10:00 - username you no longer you know face
10:04 - these problems so this is for user name
10:10 - underscore text okay and I will do the
10:15 - same
10:16 - for you know every
10:19 - text and edit text and button here so
10:23 - that all these resources are transferred
10:26 - to my string.xml file you you can see we
10:29 - have created loog loginor text and the
10:33 - text on this login uncore text is uh
10:36 - login page in the same way we have uh
10:39 - defined uh one more tag for uh username
10:44 - so I will do the same for
10:46 - other other text boxes or text views and
10:50 - buttons
10:58 - right
11:06 - so now I have successfully defined all
11:08 - my strings uh to the string in the
11:13 - string.xml
11:17 - file so now I have defined all my string
11:20 - constants or all my strings as constant
11:24 - and I have transferred all my strings as
11:27 - constant in my strings XML file you can
11:30 - see all my uh you know uh strings like
11:34 - username password attempt login have
11:38 - some you know tag here or constant name
11:41 - here so that I can reuse them in some
11:45 - different uh Place using these uh tags
11:50 - or tag IDs right now our designing is
11:55 - done you can uh even go to the second
11:58 - activity which is activity _ user. XML
12:02 - file and go to the design and in here I
12:06 - can just uh drag and drop a large text
12:11 - and I can change the
12:25 - text so now our design part part is
12:29 - almost complete or complete and in this
12:33 - video I'm going to just show you this
12:35 - design and I'm going to stop this video
12:38 - here itself and in the next video what
12:41 - we are going to do is we are going to
12:42 - write some code so that user can enter
12:46 - his uh username and password and we will
12:49 - also uh provide some number of attempts
12:53 - here and then once he logs in and if the
12:56 - login is successful he will be
12:58 - successfully redirected to the activity.
13:02 - XML file so stay tuned for that video
13:04 - please wait comment and subscribe and
13:06 - bye for now
