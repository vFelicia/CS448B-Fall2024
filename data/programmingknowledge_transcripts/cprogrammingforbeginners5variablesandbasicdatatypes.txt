00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on C programming for beginners
00:05 - and in this video I'm going to uh teach
00:07 - you about variables so I'm going to
00:09 - teach you what are variables and how we
00:13 - can declare variables in C and how we
00:15 - can use them so first question is what
00:18 - are
00:19 - variables variables are nothing but uh
00:23 - the data holder or you can save values
00:28 - in a variable so it just like you want
00:33 - to save your age in some place you can
00:37 - store it in a variable and then you can
00:40 - extract your age uh using this variable
00:43 - also now variable has uh two different
00:49 - things one is called data type for
00:52 - example int int is an integer and then
00:56 - the name of the variable for example age
00:59 - and then
01:00 - you give a semicolon here and this is
01:03 - the Declaration of the
01:05 - variable now what uh this the variable
01:08 - means is we want to uh declare a
01:12 - variable called age age is the name of
01:15 - the variable and int is the data type
01:18 - data types is the type of data this
01:21 - variable is going to store so it's going
01:24 - to store integer in our case then it's
01:27 - uh initialized by this data type called
01:30 - int okay now you can assign some value
01:34 - to this age for example age is equal to
01:39 - 21 and then you can print this age by
01:43 - print F function for example the age is
01:48 - percentage D which holds integer value
01:51 - and then comma and then the variable
01:55 - name which is age okay and when you
01:59 - compile and run this program it will
02:02 - show you the age is and whatever the age
02:05 - value is which is 21 in our case
02:10 - right and you can see this the age is 21
02:15 - so once again the variable are used to
02:19 - store some value okay now there are some
02:24 - rules for declaring the variables also
02:28 - for example you you want to uh store the
02:33 - variables using some number starting
02:36 - with a number then you cannot do this so
02:40 - these are some rules I will just enclose
02:44 - them in the comments so that uh they are
02:48 - not executed the rules are your variable
02:51 - name cannot start with a number okay so
02:54 - for for example you want to start your
02:56 - variable with a number it's invalid the
03:00 - number must not be there or or at the
03:03 - initial place okay so whenever you
03:07 - compile this program it will give you an
03:08 - error because your variable name starts
03:10 - with a number but it can end with a
03:14 - number or the number can uh you know
03:17 - come in between your variable name it
03:20 - will be totally
03:22 - fine
03:24 - because what's the problem here yeah
03:26 - this
03:27 - age I will just commend this out because
03:30 - H I haven't declared it yet right so
03:34 - it's totally fine to have numbers in
03:36 - between your word but your variable name
03:39 - cannot start with a number okay the
03:42 - second rule is your variable name cannot
03:46 - have spaces for example you want to
03:48 - declare a variable
03:51 - called any age for
03:54 - example uh with a space in between so
03:58 - this is invalid you can canot have
04:00 - spaces in your variable name right the
04:04 - third rule is you cannot start or use
04:09 - any special character for example dollar
04:12 - you want to use dollar to initialize the
04:15 - variable name it's not allowed or you
04:17 - want to use S in between your variable
04:20 - name it's also not allowed okay so avoid
04:24 - using special characters in variables
04:27 - but it's totally Define to use
04:31 - underscore underscore is an exception
04:34 - which you can use as a special character
04:36 - in between your name so for example my
04:41 - underscore age is totally valid variable
04:46 - name
04:47 - okay the fourth rule is always avoid to
04:52 - use special function names for example
04:56 - main is uh the function already declared
04:59 - in C C if you want to declare main as
05:02 - your variable name it's okay but it will
05:05 - create conflict in C because c will
05:09 - think that this is a function name and
05:11 - you have declared it as a variable name
05:14 - so it will give you some conflicts and
05:16 - in the warning also when you compile
05:18 - this program it says main is usually
05:21 - used as a
05:23 - function so avoid using any special
05:26 - function names in as a variable name
05:30 - okay so these are some rules for the
05:33 - variable names and you can also
05:36 - initialize your variable like this 21
05:40 - it's totally fine whenever you declare
05:42 - your variable you can at the same time
05:44 - you can initialize it by this equal to
05:47 - sign okay and whenever you build and run
05:51 - it will run totally
05:54 - fine now there are different type of
05:57 - variables uh I will just just run this
06:00 - program and then I will show you what
06:03 - are different type of variable name
06:06 - which are very basic to see so you can
06:09 - declare integer variable names for
06:12 - example you want to declare uh uh
06:16 - decimal uh Point variables you can do it
06:20 - with the data type
06:24 - float so float you can use to store some
06:29 - uh
06:30 - uh floating point value or decimal
06:32 - values for
06:34 - example Pi Pi has the value for example
06:38 - 3.14 and whatever so it's a decimal
06:41 - value you can store this decimal values
06:45 - uh using a data type float okay now in
06:50 - order to uh store a character you use
06:55 - car and car you know you can name it as
06:59 - as
07:01 - mycore care it's totally fine is equal
07:04 - to any character for example and always
07:07 - remember that whenever you want to uh
07:10 - store a character you store it in single
07:13 - codes okay so do it like this and it's
07:18 - totally fine and the fourth type is
07:22 - which is very basic is double double is
07:26 - also a data type and you can say this is
07:30 - a
07:31 - big pi value is equal to
07:36 - 3.14 and whatever is the value of pi big
07:41 - uh float value so these are the four
07:45 - basic data type you can use in C there
07:49 - are other data types but these are the
07:52 - most basic data type you can use to
07:56 - declare variables in C
08:01 - now I think that's it for this video I
08:05 - hope you have understood the basic
08:06 - concept of variables and I hope you have
08:09 - enjoyed this video please wait comment
08:10 - and subscribe and bye for now
