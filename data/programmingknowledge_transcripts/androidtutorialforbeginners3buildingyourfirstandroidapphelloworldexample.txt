00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Android app development for
00:04 - beginners in the last video we have seen
00:07 - how to install Android Studio on our
00:10 - Windows operating system and how we can
00:14 - do the Android Studio SDK configuration
00:17 - so in this category we have done some
00:21 - SDK configurations and we have
00:23 - downloaded some default packages right
00:27 - and the most important package was was
00:30 - this one which was Intel x86 emulator
00:35 - accelerator so if this is not installed
00:38 - you uh may want to install it because
00:42 - our emulator will run on this okay so
00:46 - this is in extra so make sure it's
00:48 - installed now once this is done we are
00:51 - ready to create our first Android
00:54 - application now in here in the quick
00:58 - start menu you will see some options Ops
01:00 - the first option is the start a new
01:04 - Android Studio project so we will click
01:06 - this option and then you can give the
01:10 - name to your Android application now
01:14 - it's encouraged to start the name of
01:17 - your application with a capital letter
01:21 - for example my application or I can
01:23 - change this
01:27 - to my first application for example exle
01:31 - my first app right but if you do or if
01:37 - you start the name by small letter you
01:40 - can see a small little warning here
01:43 - which says the application name of most
01:46 - app begin with an uppercase so it's
01:51 - encouraged to uh you know give your app
01:55 - name with a capital letter now here
01:58 - second uh uh thing thing here is the
02:01 - company domain name right now we are uh
02:05 - at the starting of our you know uh
02:08 - learning cycle so we will leave it as
02:10 - default but in the later uh you know
02:14 - later exercises or later uh videos you
02:19 - may want to change it to uh your
02:22 - personal domain
02:24 - name this is the location where your
02:27 - project will be saved so see uh username
02:30 - Android Studio project and the name of
02:33 - your project so just click
02:36 - next and we are going to develop uh our
02:40 - application for phone and tablet uh you
02:43 - can even make uh Android application for
02:47 - TV or variable uh Technologies like
02:51 - watches or Google Glass but uh right now
02:55 - we will concentrate only on this phone
02:58 - and tablet application
03:00 - and in here this is in interesting in
03:04 - here it says the lower API level Target
03:08 - more devices but have fewer feature
03:12 - available right so it's uh on you how
03:17 - much audience you want to reach so right
03:20 - now by default uh this Android 4.0.3 is
03:25 - selected which covers
03:28 - 87% of all the devices right so for
03:32 - example uh if you choose the latest
03:35 - version which is Android 5 it covers
03:40 - right now 0% almost 0% devices and if
03:45 - you go to KitKat it covers only
03:48 - 24% of the devices and uh generally you
03:53 - may want to make some application which
03:55 - covers almost all the devices and have a
03:59 - back back backward and forward
04:01 - compatibility so for example if we
04:04 - choose this Android 2.2 it means that it
04:08 - will cover 100% of devices which will
04:11 - run on your newer devices and on older
04:15 - devices so choose the one which covers
04:19 - the most uh percentage of devices for
04:22 - example this Android froo right click
04:27 - next and
04:30 - in
04:31 - here this is the name of your uh you
04:35 - know blank activity and uh in here you
04:40 - can give the name of your activity now
04:43 - what is activity activity is nothing but
04:48 - you can say a section or page of your
04:52 - application uh similarly uh if you uh
04:55 - consider or if you compare this activity
04:58 - with uh or Android app with some website
05:01 - an activity can be a homepage or about
05:05 - page or some other page so an activity
05:08 - you can compare to a page of a website
05:12 - right now once everything is done you
05:15 - can just
05:28 - finish
05:36 - and
05:37 - now uh this is for the first time we are
05:41 - running our application so I will just
05:43 - try to uh you know run this application
05:46 - and I want to uh you know print this
05:49 - hello world on my uh running Android
05:54 - emulator right so for the first time
05:58 - when you open uh this Android Studio you
06:01 - can even do open your Android SDK
06:05 - manager from here itself uh this is this
06:08 - small Android uh button here which uh
06:12 - says SDK manager you can just open this
06:16 - and in here if you haven't uh done your
06:21 - SDK manager or if you need to do some
06:24 - settings for f SDK manager you can open
06:27 - it from here itself right
06:30 - so uh right now nothing is required so I
06:34 - will close this now the other button
06:37 - here is for avd
06:40 - manager and avd manager is the full form
06:44 - of Android virtual device manager and
06:48 - this avd manager you can uh use to set
06:54 - your default Android device for which uh
06:58 - you are going to run your your
06:59 - application so by default it's Nexus 5
07:03 - in my case this can be uh different if
07:06 - uh you are watching this video in the
07:09 - future but by default it going to give
07:13 - you a default device right so we will
07:16 - leave this device as default for now but
07:19 - uh you can you know create your own
07:22 - devices by clicking this create button
07:25 - and this we are going to see in the
07:27 - further videos but but uh for now we
07:31 - will just concentrate on our default
07:34 - device
07:35 - now in here in the default device in the
07:39 - actions you can take three actions one
07:42 - is to launch your avd emulator second is
07:47 - the addit you can addit your uh
07:50 - configurations of your device so you can
07:53 - just click this pencil button and in
07:57 - here all the settings of your uh device
07:59 - you can see okay and in the show
08:03 - advanced settings you can uh even do
08:06 - some advanced settings for example Ram
08:08 - settings or VM Heap or internal storage
08:12 - right so for now by default uh I can see
08:16 - this uh RAM is
08:18 - 1536 which I think uh we need to change
08:22 - but for now I will leave it as default
08:25 - because I want to uh run my application
08:30 - and see if any error occurs we will
08:33 - change this Ram because sometimes uh
08:36 - whenever you for the first time run your
08:40 - uh emulator it gives uh this error okay
08:44 - so I will just close this and I will
08:47 - press this uh green triangle button here
08:50 - which is for running our application
08:53 - just click
08:55 - this and now it's waiting for avd D
08:59 - which is and a
09:02 - ABD and now it will run or execute your
09:07 - task so it's
09:10 - second I want to choose and we only have
09:14 - one device which was the default we will
09:15 - choose that so I will wait for uh this
09:20 - uh device manager to
09:23 - appear so this is
09:25 - the uh launch emulator and the default
09:29 - device device is Nexus 5 which was our
09:32 - default device I will just leave it as
09:35 - it is and click okay and
09:39 - now hopefully it will run but sometimes
09:43 - you can see it gives you this error and
09:47 - the error says that x86 emulator
09:51 - currently requires Hardware acceleration
09:54 - please ensure that hxm is properly
09:58 - installed so this is a common uh uh
10:02 - Android you know problem whenever you
10:04 - run your first Android application so
10:08 - don't worry uh we are going to solve it
10:11 - and to solve it what we need to do is
10:14 - just see the location of your SDK file
10:18 - which is uh the F in the first line so
10:21 - this is the location where your SDK
10:24 - folder is there so just copy this path
10:26 - until SDK which is which will be
10:29 - something like c/ user your username
10:33 - slapp
10:34 - data/ local SL Android SL SDK so just
10:39 - copy this path from
10:40 - here and open your file manager and
10:43 - paste this
10:45 - path and this will open your SDK folder
10:49 - and in your SDK folder there will be a
10:51 - folder called extras and in this extras
10:55 - folder there will be a folder called
10:57 - Intel and in this uh Intel folder there
11:00 - will be a folder called Hardware
11:03 - accelerated uh execution manager which
11:07 - has the uh short form of hxm right so we
11:12 - will go inside this and there is a
11:15 - executable file which we need to install
11:19 - in order to install this Android
11:22 - emulator so we will click this
11:25 - application executable file which is
11:27 - Intel haxm minus Android uh executable
11:31 - file I will just run
11:33 - this
11:35 - and just click
11:37 - next and uh this can be different for
11:41 - different devices the default value of
11:43 - Ram uh can be different for different
11:46 - devices if you have the uh you know
11:50 - larger Ram or memory you uh can have
11:55 - more uh you know memory here or
11:59 - otherwise or depending upon the you know
12:02 - uh space you have so right now for me
12:05 - it's 2 GB it can be 1 GB for uh you know
12:09 - uh other devices or it can be a 4 GB for
12:13 - some other just click next and
12:25 - install so now the installation of hxm
12:29 - is complete so we will click finish and
12:33 - now we will close
12:35 - everything and we are going to run our
12:39 - application so I'm going to close this
12:41 - browser for now and now I'm going to run
12:45 - our application once again so this one
12:49 - is finished minimize it and let's run
12:53 - our application by clicking this green
12:55 - button and hopefully this time we we
12:58 - will not see the same error we will
13:02 - choose the default application from
13:05 - here and
13:07 - now we will wait for the
13:11 - message and in some seconds we are going
13:14 - to see the
13:19 - response so in here we are going to see
13:22 - the response any
13:25 - moment and here we can see now now the
13:30 - application is successfully launched so
13:34 - it says HX is working
13:38 - and it's
13:41 - started so now uh for the first time
13:44 - this Android will load this is an
13:47 - emulator on which our application will
13:51 - run so now uh Android will start or
13:56 - Android emulator will start and once
13:59 - this emulator starts our application is
14:02 - going to run on it so it will work like
14:06 - an Android appliation or Android uh you
14:10 - know device and we just need to unlock
14:13 - it when uh this is uh you know ready so
14:17 - now just drag uh this up upwards and the
14:22 - lock will be uh you know open and now uh
14:26 - we just need to click okay
14:29 - and
14:31 - uh just wait for our uh hello world to
14:37 - you know compile and appear here so now
14:40 - it's going to appear hello world and you
14:43 - can see the hello world message we uh
14:46 - are able to see so this is our
14:49 - application which is running on this uh
14:52 - Android
14:53 - emulator so I hope you have enjoyed
