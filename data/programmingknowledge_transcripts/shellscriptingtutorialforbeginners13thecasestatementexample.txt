00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - shell scripting tools for beginners in
00:04 - the last video we have seen how we can
00:06 - use the case statement in shell
00:09 - scripting now in this video we will take
00:11 - one more example on case statements and
00:15 - we will consolidate our knowledge which
00:17 - we have gained in the last video so we
00:20 - already know that how case statement
00:23 - works in scripting and this is the basic
00:26 - syntax which we have learned in the last
00:28 - video so let's take an example and this
00:32 - time we are going to use some pattern to
00:36 - evaluate some cases so let's say we want
00:41 - to allow the user to enter any character
00:44 - and then we will evaluate that character
00:49 - and based upon the character entered by
00:51 - the user we will display if it's a
00:54 - capital letter or a small letter or a
00:59 - integer or some other special character
01:03 - or it's not a character he entered some
01:07 - string for example so let's get started
01:10 - so what I am going to do is on the top I
01:13 - am going to ask the user to enter some
01:18 - character so I will just use - II for
01:22 - this and I will say enter some character
01:25 - and then we will allow the user to enter
01:28 - the character on the same line right and
01:31 - then we will take that character using
01:34 - the read command so just write read and
01:37 - then we will save it for example in a
01:40 - value so just try it value variable and
01:45 - then we will take this variable so I am
01:48 - going to remove this variable because we
01:50 - don't need this variable so now our
01:53 - character or whatever input is entered
01:56 - by the user is in the value variable so
02:00 - we will evaluate this value expression
02:03 - and then we will check if it's a capital
02:07 - letter or small letter right
02:10 - for that we can use some patterns now
02:14 - how pattern works so for example we want
02:16 - to evaluate if user has entered the
02:20 - small letter A to Z so we can may use
02:24 - this square bracket and then you just
02:26 - need to write a and then minus Z and
02:30 - this pattern represent that we are
02:34 - expecting a small letter between A to Z
02:39 - okay in a similar way if you want to
02:43 - evaluate a capital character then we can
02:48 - just say capital A to Z like this so
02:52 - this is the pattern for capital A to Z
02:54 - right now if you want to evaluate the
03:00 - number any integer 0 to 9 so we can just
03:03 - write 0 to 9 right now if the user
03:08 - enters any other special character for
03:11 - example Asterix or some other characters
03:14 - which is not the part of e to Z or any
03:19 - number then we can evaluate it with the
03:22 - question mark now what is question mark
03:25 - question mark is a pattern which expects
03:30 - any special character any character
03:34 - which is one letter character right and
03:38 - this asterisk or star symbol R waits for
03:43 - more than one character so it can be one
03:45 - on more than one special character so if
03:49 - the user enters for example any string
03:52 - and not a character then it goes into
03:55 - this situation or in this case and this
03:59 - is for only one character any special
04:02 - character right and here we can echo
04:06 - that character so for example user
04:10 - entered value and then we can just say A
04:14 - to Z smaller letters write in a similar
04:21 - way for capital A to Z
04:23 - can just right here capital a to Zed and
04:27 - in the case of integer let's copy this
04:30 - and paste it here and we will just say 0
04:34 - to 9 and in the case of question mark we
04:38 - will just say it's a special character
04:41 - right and in the last case we will just
04:43 - say unknown input so we will just write
04:47 - here unknown input so let's run the
04:51 - script and let's see what happens when
04:53 - we run this script let's run the script
04:57 - and let's enter any small letter for
05:01 - example app and then press Enter and say
05:05 - the user entered letter F which is
05:09 - between small a to small Z right once
05:14 - again let's run the script and this time
05:17 - we will enter the capital K for example
05:19 - and then press Enter and you can you see
05:23 - there is an error here because we were
05:28 - expecting this statement to be printed
05:31 - which is capital a to capital Z but here
05:35 - it prints user entered capital K but
05:38 - then it prints small a to Z so it goes
05:43 - into this condition and if you also get
05:47 - the same error then most probably you
05:50 - need to do a small hack and this is you
05:55 - just need to set the Lang as C so just
06:01 - write Lang is equal to C so in capital
06:06 - Lang is equal to capital C and this
06:09 - means you are setting a languor
06:12 - environment variable is equal to C right
06:15 - and this means that you are using the
06:20 - safe locale everywhere in your operating
06:23 - system so if it doesn't work for you for
06:26 - capital letter the script you just need
06:29 - to set this environment variable as C so
06:32 - lang is equal to C and once again we
06:35 - will run the script
06:36 - and once again we will enter the capital
06:38 - K and this time it shows the right
06:42 - result to us right so if you face the
06:45 - same problem just use this environment
06:48 - variable is equal to C right once again
06:51 - let's run the script and this time we
06:53 - will enter any number and press ENTER
06:56 - and says of course it's between zero to
06:59 - nine right or any other number for
07:02 - example five it's also between zero to
07:04 - nine right now let's enter any special
07:08 - character so I'm entering for example
07:11 - this and symbol which is a special
07:13 - character and then press Enter
07:15 - and it says user entered this and it's a
07:20 - special character now let's enter any
07:23 - random string and let's see what's the
07:26 - result so it says unknown input right so
07:31 - in this way you can match characters
07:34 - using these kind of patterns right for
07:39 - more information on patterns and regular
07:42 - expression you can always search for a
07:45 - regular expression and you will see a
07:48 - vicky pedia page on regular expression
07:51 - and you will be able to understand and
07:54 - read their what the square bracket is
07:57 - what is - what is this question mark
08:00 - stands for or what is this asterisk
08:03 - everything so the Wikipedia page for
08:06 - regular expression has a good
08:09 - explanation on pattern so just read that
08:12 - Wikipedia page and you will be able to
08:15 - understand these patterns in a better
08:18 - manner so case is not just used for our
08:23 - strict letters or characters you can you
08:27 - know evaluate any patterns using the
08:30 - case statement and that's the beauty of
08:32 - this case statement so I hope you
