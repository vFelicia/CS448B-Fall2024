00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can download and install
00:04 - NetBeans IDE on your Windows 10
00:07 - operating system with Java JDK so in
00:11 - order to install NetBeans IDE you need
00:13 - to have Java JDK installed on your
00:16 - windows operating system so first of all
00:18 - we are going to see how we can download
00:20 - and install Java JDK and then in the
00:23 - next step we are going to see how to
00:25 - install NetBeans on our Windows
00:27 - operating system
00:28 - so first of all we are going to check
00:30 - whether Java is already installed on our
00:32 - system or not so just right-click on
00:35 - your windows icon here and then click on
00:38 - command prompt and here you just need to
00:40 - type a simple command which is Java C
00:44 - command so if this Java C command is
00:48 - going to give you this kind of response
00:50 - which says Java C is not recognized as
00:54 - an internal or external command then
00:56 - most probably java jdk is not not
00:59 - installed on your windows 10 operating
01:02 - system so we are going to install it so
01:05 - first of all open your favorite browser
01:07 - and search for java jdk now you will see
01:12 - different versions of java jdk x' in the
01:16 - search results so right now I'm seeing
01:18 - Java SE development kit 8 which is most
01:22 - popular right now but when I scroll down
01:24 - I can also see Java SE development kit
01:29 - 12 so this is the latest version of java
01:33 - jdk at the time of making this video so
01:36 - i'm going to show you how you can
01:38 - download and install java SE development
01:41 - kit 12 so i'm going to click on this
01:44 - link and you will see this oracle.com
01:48 - website will open and you will see first
01:52 - of all this agreement so I'm going to
01:54 - just say I accept all cookies and now
01:58 - you can see this version on this web
02:01 - page again which is Java SE development
02:04 - kit 12 downloads so first of all you
02:08 - just need to scroll down and then click
02:11 - on the accept license
02:13 - agreement radio button and then
02:16 - depending upon your operating system you
02:19 - can choose the binaries or the
02:22 - executable file so right now we are on
02:24 - Windows 10 so we are going to choose the
02:27 - second last option which says JDK 12
02:30 - windows
02:31 - - x64 underscore bin dot exe file so we
02:37 - are going to download this exe file and
02:39 - that this exe file is about 159 megabyte
02:44 - so you just need to wait for some time
02:47 - to download at this exe file so once
02:50 - this executable file is downloaded you
02:52 - just need to click on this executable
02:54 - file and then I'm going to minimize the
02:57 - browser and first of all you will see
02:59 - this kind of warning I'm going to just
03:01 - click on yes and now the installation
03:03 - wizard has been started so I'm going to
03:05 - just click on next and then if you don't
03:09 - have the good reason to change the
03:13 - location where this Java JDK will be
03:16 - installed on your operating system just
03:18 - leave everything as default so this will
03:21 - be the location where your Java
03:23 - development kit will be installed so we
03:27 - are going to go to this location after
03:29 - installing Java JDK for now I'm going to
03:31 - just click on the next button which is
03:33 - going to start the installation of Java
03:37 - development kit so just wait for some
03:39 - time until this progress bar reaches to
03:42 - the hundred percent mark and after a few
03:44 - seconds you will see this message which
03:46 - says Java development kit is
03:48 - successfully installed so you can just
03:50 - close this window and now we are going
03:53 - to go to the location where this Java
03:55 - development kit is installed so go to
03:58 - your C Drive and here go to Program
04:02 - Files and you will be able to see this
04:05 - new Java folder which is created by this
04:08 - installer for you so I'm going to click
04:10 - inside this and you can see this folder
04:13 - which is JDK folder so now we are going
04:17 - to just set up our environment variables
04:21 - so our command prompt is going to
04:23 - recognize the java c command or any
04:25 - other
04:26 - related command so what you need to do
04:28 - is you just need to go inside this bin
04:31 - folder and then copy this part from here
04:34 - and then right click on your windows
04:37 - icon once again and then click on system
04:40 - and once the system window is open just
04:43 - click on advanced system settings and
04:46 - then environment variables and here you
04:50 - can see two kind of environment
04:53 - variables one is user variables for the
04:56 - user and other is the system variables
05:00 - so we are going to create the system
05:02 - variables so first of all just click on
05:05 - this path system variable so here on the
05:08 - left hand side you will be able to see
05:10 - path so just double click on it or just
05:13 - click on the edit button and then you
05:16 - can just click on new and then paste
05:19 - this part until bin folder which you
05:23 - have copied so once you are finished
05:24 - with this environment variable then
05:28 - click on OK and now we are going to
05:30 - create a new environment variable which
05:33 - is called Java home environment variable
05:35 - which is required by some IDE s and
05:39 - other Java related programs to recognize
05:43 - your Java JDK directory so here we are
05:49 - going to just click on new and then we
05:52 - are going to create a Java home variable
05:54 - so just type Java underscore home all in
05:57 - capital and then here as the variable
06:01 - value we are going to go to the folder
06:04 - once again where we have our Java JDK
06:08 - folder so this time just go to this
06:10 - folder under Java folder which is the
06:12 - JDK folder and then you don't need to go
06:17 - inside the bin folder now you just need
06:19 - to go until the JDK folder so just copy
06:22 - this part and then paste this part as
06:26 - the variable value for the Java
06:28 - underscore home environment variables so
06:31 - I'm going to just click on OK
06:32 - and you can see this new environment
06:35 - variable is created here so now once you
06:38 - are done with the setting
06:39 - of the environment variables we are
06:41 - going to just click okay and then okay
06:43 - and I'm going to close this system
06:46 - window
06:46 - so now Java is installed on your Windows
06:49 - operating system and we are going to
06:51 - check once again if it works or not so
06:54 - once again right click on the windows
06:56 - icon and then once again open your
06:59 - command prompt and once again we are
07:01 - going to give this command Java C and
07:04 - first of all let's see the version so
07:06 - I'm going to just say Java C - version
07:09 - and then press Enter
07:11 - which is going to give me the version of
07:13 - Java C which is installed on my system
07:16 - which is at this time Java C twelve
07:20 - point zero point two because we have
07:21 - installed Java JDK twelve on our Windows
07:25 - operating system also if you want to
07:28 - know the Java version you just need to
07:30 - type Java - - version and then press
07:35 - Enter which is going to give you the
07:37 - version of Java installed on your system
07:39 - also once you have installed this Java
07:41 - JDK the Java SE runtime environment will
07:45 - be automatically installed so you don't
07:48 - need to do anything extra for this and
07:51 - here is the Java hotspot 64-bit server
07:54 - virtual machine now once you are
07:57 - finished with the installation of Java
08:00 - JDK on your Windows 10 operating system
08:02 - we are ready to install NetBeans IDE on
08:06 - our Windows operating systems so once
08:08 - again go to your favorite browser and
08:10 - search for NetBeans and the first link
08:13 - which will appear here will be from
08:15 - NetBeans dot orgy so I'm going to click
08:17 - on this link and once this website is
08:20 - open straight away you will see this
08:23 - download button so I'm going to click on
08:24 - this download button and it's going to
08:28 - redirect me to this URL which is net B's
08:31 - dot Apache dot o-r-g for slash downloads
08:35 - now on this Apache dot o-r-g page you
08:38 - can see there are two versions of
08:40 - NetBeans available at the time of making
08:42 - this video
08:43 - one is Apache NetBeans 11 feature update
08:47 - and the second is the Apache NetBeans
08:50 - eleven LTS version LTS means long-term
08:54 - support right so we are going to
08:57 - download and install the LTS version and
09:01 - I will also recommend you to download
09:02 - this LTS version because it has a
09:06 - long-term support so I'm going to click
09:08 - on this download button under LTS and
09:11 - you will be redirected to this page
09:13 - which says downloading Apache NetBeans
09:16 - 11 just scroll down a little and you
09:18 - will be able to see three options here
09:22 - one is source other is binary and next
09:25 - is Java doc so just click on incubating
09:29 - NetBeans 11 bin dot zip file so I'm
09:32 - going to click on this zip file and then
09:35 - at last you just need to click on this
09:38 - mirror link which is going to actually
09:40 - start your download of this zip file
09:43 - this file lays around three hundred and
09:46 - three megabytes so it's going to take
09:48 - some time to download so I'm going to
09:49 - cancel this download because I have
09:51 - already downloaded this file to save the
09:55 - time so I'm going to directly go to the
09:57 - folder where I have downloaded this file
09:59 - so this is going to look like this which
10:02 - is a zip file so first of all you need
10:05 - to extract it so I'm going to just right
10:07 - click and then I'm going to just say
10:09 - extract all which is going to extract
10:11 - this file into the current folder itself
10:15 - so now this zip file is extracted in the
10:18 - form of this folder so I'm going to go
10:20 - inside this folder and you will be able
10:23 - to see this NetBeans folder and once you
10:26 - go inside this NetBeans folder all the
10:29 - folders and files related to NetBeans
10:31 - are present here so the next step is to
10:35 - just go inside this NetBeans folder and
10:40 - just cut this NetBeans folder from here
10:43 - so once again I'm going to go to this
10:47 - extracted folder where I have this
10:49 - NetBeans folder so I'm going to just cut
10:52 - this NetBeans folder and then I'm going
10:56 - to paste this folder to my C Drive so
10:59 - I'm going to go to my C Drive and then
11:01 - paste this NetBeans folder
11:03 - into my C Drive now I'm going to go
11:07 - inside this NetBeans folder and then I'm
11:10 - going to go inside the bin folder and
11:13 - you will be able to see two executable
11:16 - file here one is NetBeans and other is
11:18 - NetBeans 64 so we need to run this
11:22 - executable file which says NetBeans 64
11:25 - which is for 64-bit operating system so
11:28 - I'm going to just double click on it and
11:30 - I'm going to just click on run and I'm
11:33 - going to minimize this folder and you
11:35 - can see the NetBeans IDE is starting and
11:39 - now as you can see here this NetBeans
11:41 - IDE has been opened on my Windows 10
11:45 - operating system so the first thing
11:46 - before doing anything to the NetBeans
11:49 - IDE
11:50 - I'm going to just right click on this
11:52 - NetBeans icon so I'm going to just right
11:54 - click and then pin it to my taskbar and
11:57 - also I'm going to go to the folder and
11:59 - then right-click on this NetBeans 64-bit
12:03 - executable file
12:04 - and I am going to just click on create
12:07 - shortcut which is going to create the
12:09 - shortcut for this NetBeans executable
12:12 - file which I'm going to move to the
12:15 - desktop if you want you can just move
12:18 - this icon to the desktop which is the
12:20 - shortcut for opening this NetBeans IDE
12:23 - so that's done let's create a Java
12:26 - project using this NetBeans IDE so now
12:30 - let's create a very simple Java project
12:32 - here so I'm going to click on the file
12:35 - option here and then click on a new
12:37 - project and here you will be able to see
12:40 - a few options where it says Java with
12:44 - maven Java with Gradle and other options
12:48 - also are available here so what we want
12:52 - to do is we want to create a simple java
12:55 - application so I'm going to choose Java
12:57 - with ant here and then I'm going to just
13:00 - choose Java application and then click
13:01 - Next and you can see the name of the
13:05 - java application is displayed here you
13:09 - can change the project name for example
13:12 - hello world and then I'm going to click
13:15 - on finish and you can see
13:17 - this simple java application has been
13:20 - created with the mean method because I
13:24 - have checked the main method so let's
13:27 - print something so I'm going to just
13:29 - print system dot out dot print hello
13:34 - world and we are going to build this
13:37 - program so I'm going to just click on
13:39 - run option here on the top bar and then
13:42 - I'm going to just say build project
13:45 - which is going to build our project and
13:47 - if any problem exists is going to tell
13:50 - us what crap problem is there and if our
13:53 - program is compiled successfully it's
13:56 - not going to give us any problem so now
13:59 - we will be able to run our project so
14:01 - I'm going to once again go to the run
14:03 - option and now click on this green
14:07 - triangle option which says run project
14:10 - which is the hello world project and
14:12 - once you click on run option you will be
14:17 - able to see hello world is printed here
14:18 - because this is the system dot out dot
14:22 - print method if you right here print Ln
14:26 - which is for print line and then build
14:29 - and run your project once again so build
14:32 - the project and then run the project
14:34 - once again it's going to print hello
14:37 - world and then this will be your
14:40 - displayed on the next line so all things
14:45 - are working fine on our NetBeans IDE or
14:48 - Java is configured successfully and it's
14:52 - working so this is how you can download
14:54 - and install NetBeans on your Windows 10
14:58 - operating system I hope you have enjoyed
15:00 - this video I will see you in the next
15:02 - video
