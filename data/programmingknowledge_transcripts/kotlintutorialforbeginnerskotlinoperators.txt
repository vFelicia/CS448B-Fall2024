00:00 - in this video we are going to cover the
00:03 - operators in
00:05 - kotlin
00:06 - so i have already listed the type of
00:08 - operators and the operators
00:11 - here so the first type of operators are
00:14 - arithmetic operators
00:17 - so here is the list of arithmetic
00:19 - operators the first one is the addition
00:22 - so whenever i use the plus sign
00:25 - we are going to use it for addition so
00:28 - the addition can be of two integers or
00:31 - it can be of uh two strings also it is
00:34 - known as string uh consent concat
00:37 - concatenation and we will be uh knowing
00:40 - about it in a while
00:42 - so another arithmetic operator is the
00:44 - minus sign or the subtraction
00:47 - so it is a subtraction of subtraction
00:49 - operator
00:50 - when i
00:51 - use it it generally subtract one integer
00:54 - from other or one variable from other
00:56 - okay other is the multiplication
00:59 - operator
01:00 - okay it is self-explanatory so when i
01:03 - use it it is used to multiply the
01:07 - data type the other is
01:10 - division data type so whenever i use the
01:13 - division operator so whenever i use the
01:16 - slash
01:18 - so it generally means that we have to
01:20 - define we have to divide
01:22 - one variable from other so here
01:24 - interesting part is the uh the
01:27 - percentage sign or the modulus operator
01:31 - so the modulus operator retains uh
01:33 - returns the
01:35 - remainder
01:37 - so i'll just make a function and explain
01:40 - all this to you
01:42 - so
01:44 - i will create a value
01:47 - a
01:48 - equals to 15
01:50 - and
01:52 - b equals to
01:55 - 5
01:56 - okay
01:57 - so
01:58 - i'll just print
02:00 - all these
02:02 - the result of all these operators
02:04 - so a plus
02:06 - b and i'll just
02:10 - copy it
02:15 - okay
02:17 - so
02:19 - plus
02:20 - minus
02:22 - multiplication
02:24 - division and the modulus operator
02:28 - so you can already
02:31 - guess the result and we will be seeing
02:34 - it in a while so the result of this will
02:36 - be
02:37 - 20 the result of this will be 10 the
02:40 - result of this will be 15 into 5 the
02:42 - result of this will be 15 divided by 5
02:44 - that is 3 what will be the result of
02:46 - this
02:47 - the result of this will be 0 so it
02:49 - returns the uh
02:52 - the
02:53 - remainder when a is divided by v
02:57 - so
02:58 - uh i'll just
03:00 - so these are explainable what i'll do is
03:03 - i'll make it 17 here
03:06 - and run the program again
03:08 - so now what will be the uh well the
03:11 - result the printed so it is 2 so when 17
03:15 - is divided by 5
03:17 - it is three times five plus two so the
03:20 - remainder is two so the result of the
03:22 - modulus operator is two
03:24 - okay i hope it is clear
03:26 - so moving on we have uh comparison
03:29 - operators
03:32 - so
03:35 - okay before that
03:36 - okay
03:37 - so uh we have comparison operators
03:41 - so the first one is
03:44 - we uh
03:45 - uh
03:46 - the
03:48 - less than sign
03:50 - so whenever
03:52 - a is less than b so i'll just make
03:57 - so can you guess what will be the result
04:00 - of an comparison operator
04:03 - it will be a boolean
04:06 - so whenever i'll compare
04:09 - a less than b
04:12 - okay so when i run this program
04:15 - what will be the result
04:18 - is a is less than b no so the result
04:20 - will be false okay so mostly the result
04:24 - of the comparison operator is a boolean
04:27 - so first is less than operator second is
04:29 - the greater than operator third is the
04:31 - less than or equals to operator okay
04:33 - fourth is the greater than or equal to
04:35 - operator this is the equal to equal to
04:38 - operator so it's check whether a is
04:40 - equals to b or not is equal to operator
04:42 - this is this is is not equal to operator
04:44 - so
04:45 - when i define both as 5 and 5
04:51 - and
04:52 - when i
04:54 - do this printer and a is equals to
04:56 - equals to b so what will be the result
04:58 - what will be the output so the output
05:00 - would be true as a is equals to b
05:04 - okay
05:05 - so these are the comparison operators
05:08 - now we will move on to the
05:12 - assignment operator
05:13 - so we have already used assignment
05:15 - operator here
05:17 - okay
05:18 - so the assignment operator used here is
05:20 - the
05:21 - equal to operator
05:23 - okay we have also plus equal to minus
05:26 - equal to into equal to divided by equal
05:28 - to and
05:29 - modulus equal to
05:32 - okay so what are the
05:35 - basic functionality of this so i'll
05:38 - explain that
05:39 - so what if i
05:42 - create a variable x which is equals to
05:47 - a
05:49 - which is
05:50 - equals to a okay so i can do that
05:54 - now i'll print the value of
05:58 - println
06:00 - x
06:02 - okay
06:03 - now what i i will do is i'll
06:06 - assign x as
06:08 - x
06:09 - plus equals to a
06:12 - and now i'll
06:13 - print the value of x what i'll do is now
06:16 - i'll assign x as x minus equals to a
06:21 - and now i'll print the value of x
06:23 - now x
06:26 - into equals to
06:27 - a
06:29 - and now print the value of x now x
06:32 - divided by equals to
06:35 - a
06:43 - okay so
06:44 - you can guess the result or we will see
06:47 - them and then i'll explain them to you
06:52 - so the results are 5 10 5 5 25 5 0 okay
06:55 - so first was
06:57 - x equals to eighth of an intel and x so
06:59 - the value of a was five basically
07:02 - so here x is equals to 5
07:05 - okay
07:05 - so here the value of x was 5
07:12 - so what i did is i did x plus equals to
07:15 - a so this basically means means that
07:18 - x
07:19 - should be equal to
07:21 - x plus a
07:27 - okay
07:28 - so
07:29 - the value of x was 5 and i assigned
07:32 - reassigned the value of x as x plus a so
07:35 - the value of x here would be
07:38 - 10
07:39 - okay i hope it was clear to you so the
07:42 - basically the meaning of x plus equals
07:44 - to a is x equals to x plus a
07:47 - okay so the value of x was already 5 and
07:49 - i here reassigned the value of x as x
07:52 - plus a so 5 plus 5 that is 10
07:56 - now here the value of x is 10
07:58 - and
07:59 - this implies that x should be equals to
08:02 - x minus a
08:04 - okay
08:05 - so x was 10
08:07 - and x was 10 and a was five so i i
08:11 - reassigned the value of x is 10 minus 5
08:14 - so here the value of x should be 5
08:17 - okay and we can check that also
08:20 - so here the value of x is 5 and i
08:24 - to
08:25 - create reassign the value of x such that
08:27 - x is x should be equal to x into a
08:30 - so x is 5 a is 5 so here the
08:33 - reassigned value of x should be 25
08:36 - okay so it is pretty easy and
08:39 - interesting and i hope that should be
08:41 - clear to you
08:42 - so here
08:44 - the value of reassigned
08:46 - value of x should be x divided by a
08:49 - so x was 25
08:52 - a was five so x the new value of x
08:55 - should again be
08:57 - five
08:58 - okay and
09:00 - we are also seeing that it is true
09:03 - now it means that the reassigned value
09:07 - of x should be the remainder
09:09 - when x is divided by a
09:12 - so now x is 5 a is also 5 if the
09:14 - remainder is 0 when x is divided by a so
09:17 - here the reassigned value of a is 0.
09:20 - okay so we have now completed the
09:24 - arithmetic comparison and assignment
09:25 - operator now we will move on to the
09:28 - increment and the decrement operator
09:30 - so
09:31 - what i do i'll do is i'll just
09:35 - so here what is the value of x x is 0
09:40 - okay
09:42 - so now what i'll do is i'll just
09:46 - increase
09:48 - the value of x as x plus plus
09:50 - okay
09:51 - and then i'll print the value of x and
09:54 - then i'll do x minus minus and then
09:56 - again print the value of x
09:59 - okay so uh when i have to comment this
10:02 - all out
10:04 - okay no problem
10:06 - when if i have to comment all this out
10:09 - so what i can do is i can just press
10:12 - ctrl and the slash button
10:14 - so it it is all commented out okay so
10:18 - the value of x is a and it is 5 so value
10:22 - of x is 5 when i run this program
10:25 - when i run this program
10:27 - so the output is
10:31 - so output is six and five so here the
10:34 - value of x was five and i did x plus
10:36 - plus the in i incremented the value of x
10:38 - and then printed it so it is six and
10:41 - then i decremented the value of f x and
10:44 - then printed it so it is 5
10:47 - okay
10:48 - so i hope
10:49 - that all is clear to you and
10:52 - before the video ends i like you to
10:56 - make a program
11:02 - that
11:04 - that
11:05 - prints
11:06 - the sum of two number
11:09 - okay i hope that would be easy and you
11:12 - will do it
11:14 - some of the
11:16 - that prints the
11:18 - sum of two numbers
11:20 - okay thank you for watching this video i
11:22 - hope you enjoyed and learned
11:24 - thank you
