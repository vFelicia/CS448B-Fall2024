00:00 - hello guys now in this particular video
00:02 - we'll be learning about the operators
00:03 - okay so let me first discuss with you
00:05 - what will be covering in this particular
00:07 - video so we will go first with
00:10 - arithmetic operators then we will go
00:13 - with the relational and the Boolean
00:18 - and so on okay so I hope uh you guys
00:22 - have completed our previous videos so
00:24 - now let's just create the new script
00:27 - that is 0 8 operators dot sh
00:32 - okay just add the hash bank or pin
00:38 - C Bank you can say okay now I will
00:41 - create uh one variable
00:44 - and one enter N1
00:47 - and I'll create a variable name as N1
00:49 - read iPhone P enter and to
00:55 - give the value name as n2o then uh I
00:58 - will Echo I will do addition is or just
01:04 - addition
01:06 - so to for in cell how you do it we
01:09 - cannot write like this N1 plus N2 there
01:12 - is a proper Syntax for it you need to
01:15 - write like this
01:16 - N1 plus N2 okay all you can inside also
01:21 - you can give dollar but there is no need
01:24 - okay so now in this way you can write
01:27 - the expression inside these two
01:29 - parentheses and the dollar sign outside
01:31 - of that expression okay
01:34 - so let me just run this script once I
01:37 - will give first the certain permission
01:39 - to this file
01:41 - and then I will execute it d08 and N1 is
01:46 - 4 4 that is eight yeah we are going to
01:49 - go now now I will just copy
01:52 - all these things like
01:55 - addition so here we you can go with the
01:59 - subtraction
02:02 - what I'm doing wait
02:04 - subtraction then here you can go for
02:09 - multiplication
02:13 - and here division
02:16 - okay
02:19 - and next uh we can go with modulus also
02:25 - so
02:27 - let's go with modulus
02:31 - modulus okay
02:34 - m o d u l u s okay modulus now let's
02:39 - give the operator like here it will be
02:43 - percent
02:45 - uh let me just write like this so that
02:49 - it will be easy to read for you for
02:53 - division you have to give this forward
02:55 - slash for multiplication you know the
02:57 - star and for the subsection there is the
03:00 - minus okay
03:03 - so let's run this script and we will get
03:06 - the output for each Arab number so I
03:08 - will give the 10 and 5. so as you can
03:11 - see the addition is 15 subtraction is 5
03:13 - multiplication is
03:15 - 50 division is 2 and modulus is 0 why
03:18 - because modulus gives you the remainder
03:20 - okay if you do uh three by two then in
03:23 - that case you will get the remainder as
03:25 - 1.
03:26 - so here you can see the modulus is one
03:29 - okay now next uh you can do increment
03:33 - operator and decrement operator also you
03:36 - can use so how you can do it uh using
03:39 - plus plus and minus minus okay so I will
03:43 - do Echo
03:46 - increment
03:48 - so here we will use dollar
03:54 - and what you have to increment N1 plus
03:57 - plus or what you can do plus plus N1 it
04:01 - will first increase and then print the
04:03 - value
04:04 - okay so let's just run the script
04:08 - clear enter the n155 so that you can see
04:11 - incremented six okay in case if you do
04:15 - N1 plus plus so here we will not see the
04:18 - increment because it first prints the
04:19 - value then increments okay so in this
04:23 - case we will get the value else
04:25 - 5 here okay so but now what I will do if
04:29 - we will Echo the N1
04:32 - then we will get the six okay
04:35 - so let me just clear the screen enter
04:38 - five five okay so now here you can see
04:40 - you have got the six so I hope you got
04:42 - the concept of incremental decrement if
04:44 - plus plus is after the variable and then
04:46 - it will first print then it will
04:47 - increment f plus plus is first then it
04:49 - will increment then print
04:51 - okay so similar case with decrement
04:54 - equal
04:57 - decrement
04:59 - where is the dollar
05:01 - and you have to do minus minus and 2.
05:06 - to use yeah N2 we can use and here also
05:10 - I I do uh
05:13 - leave it as it is
05:16 - so clear the screen
05:19 - enter N15 into six
05:22 - and now decrement value with 6. first it
05:25 - was 7 and now it is six okay
05:29 - so I hope you got it uh how the things
05:32 - are working okay so now let's check with
05:35 - some relational operators like equal to
05:37 - equal to greater than equal to less than
05:39 - equal to greater than less than all
05:42 - those things okay now you have to just
05:44 - equal okay
05:48 - automatic operators okay
05:52 - just copy it and you have to go there
05:56 - and just write here read
06:01 - the relational operators okay I just uh
06:06 - comment out these things
06:09 - okay
06:10 - so now what we have to do so now we will
06:14 - use this relation operator with the if
06:16 - else so till now we have not covered the
06:18 - effects but still we can use it okay so
06:21 - how will you do it uh we will use if and
06:25 - then the big bracket this is the
06:27 - whatever the condition we will write in
06:29 - this so dollar N1 and we use GT for
06:33 - greater than and dollar N2 okay and then
06:37 - so don't worry I will teach you about
06:40 - refers in our next video okay so you
06:42 - have to just Echo
06:44 - N1 greater than N2 like this and then
06:47 - you have to close the if block okay so
06:49 - GT means greater than and there are also
06:51 - many like GT for greater than and GE for
06:55 - greater than equal to and LT for less
07:00 - than l e for greater than equal less
07:02 - than equal to n e for not equal to okay
07:06 - like this you can uh use okay so we will
07:10 - use first GT and then we will use other
07:13 - options in next okay
07:16 - so now you can run the script
07:21 - 0 8
07:24 - and I will write 5
07:26 - and 4.
07:28 - so here you can see yeah N1 is greater
07:30 - than N2 now I will change the G's to GE
07:34 - and I will write here greater than equal
07:37 - to so
07:40 - now let me just clear the screen and run
07:42 - this script again so 5 and 5 so yeah N1
07:45 - greater than equal to it this line is
07:47 - executing and you can do now LT
07:51 - if n 1 less than equal to so in one less
07:55 - here I will do and I will again run this
07:58 - script
08:00 - so five four five so yeah and one
08:02 - there's an N2 it is executing again less
08:06 - than equal to
08:08 - so we can use like this
08:12 - um four four yeah it is executing we can
08:17 - use hyphen EQ to check equality
08:20 - python EQ we can do like this
08:24 - five five yeah so here we have not
08:27 - changed but still you can and you can
08:30 - think like okay so now what we do five
08:33 - and five years okay so c n one equal to
08:36 - N2 so in this way we can use the
08:39 - relation operators now let me tell you
08:41 - about the end of data so and of it is
08:44 - nothing but if both the condition
08:45 - becomes true then that then the uh
08:49 - whatever inside that condition will be
08:51 - executed okay so if N1 equal to N2 and I
08:55 - use a hyphen a option to check and and
08:59 - operator
09:00 - and I will check if dollar N1 is greater
09:04 - than 1. okay if this is the case then
09:08 - this line will be execute okay
09:13 - so N1 I will write 5 5 and N1 greater
09:17 - than 1 yes so
09:18 - okay I am getting some error here okay
09:23 - you can write like this
09:25 - clear
09:27 - five five yeah now here you you got the
09:32 - like output as N1 equal to N2 now what I
09:35 - will do I write 0 0
09:37 - and let's check what happens whether we
09:40 - will get any output or not so here we
09:42 - are not getting any output but now we
09:44 - can use hyphen o option for or operator
09:47 - okay so let me just clear this screen
09:50 - and use like this iPhone
09:53 - 0 0 so in this case you
09:57 - like this condition is equal like this
10:00 - condition satisfies N1 equal to N2
10:03 - that's why this particular line has been
10:05 - executed okay
10:07 - so in this way and and operator and or
10:11 - operator works so that's all for today's
10:13 - videos guys I hope you liked it and yeah
10:15 - if you have any query then you can ask
10:16 - us in the comment section and I will
10:19 - surely update this code in our GitHub
10:21 - repository I will add the link in our
10:23 - description so that's all for today I
10:25 - will meet you in the next video thank
10:26 - you thank you for watching
