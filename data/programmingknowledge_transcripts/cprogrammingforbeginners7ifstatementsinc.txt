00:01 - hello guys welcome once again in this
00:02 - video I'm going to show you how to use
00:05 - if conditions and what are if conditions
00:08 - in C so as the name suggest if condition
00:13 - or if statements check the condition
00:17 - whether it's true or false and on the
00:20 - basis of the condition it execute some
00:24 - code or it will not execute some other
00:28 - code Okay so how we can declare if
00:33 - condition now I will give you an example
00:35 - first for example we
00:38 - want that we want to check some person's
00:43 - age and if this age is equal to 18 we
00:47 - want to print that the age is 18 if this
00:51 - age is greater than 18 we want to print
00:54 - that the age is greater than 18 and if
00:57 - this age is smaller than 18 then also we
01:00 - want to print that this age is smaller
01:04 - than 18 so how we can do this we can do
01:08 - this by if conditions now to uh write if
01:12 - condition the structure looks like this
01:15 - you need to use this if statement or if
01:19 - if keyword and then these two brackets
01:23 - and inside these two brackets comes
01:26 - your
01:28 - condition so so this condition can be
01:32 - true or false so we evaluate our
01:34 - condition inside this bracket okay and
01:39 - then in these curly brackets we execute
01:43 - some code on the basis of the uh you
01:48 - know validity of this condition if this
01:50 - condition is true the code inside these
01:53 - curly braces will be ex executed
01:56 - otherwise this code will not be executed
01:59 - now let's see how we can uh check the
02:02 - age of some person now for taking the
02:07 - age from uh the user at runtime we use
02:12 - scan F and you know I have uh Al also
02:18 - you know shown that this scan F you can
02:22 - use to take the inputs from the user
02:25 - right so I will just tell the user first
02:30 - by printing this message that please
02:32 - enter the age and in using this scan F I
02:35 - will take this input and because this
02:39 - age is an integer I will use this
02:42 - modulus D to take the integer and then
02:46 - comma then the age okay but the correct
02:52 - way of using
02:53 - scanf with any value is to use this and
02:59 - the symbol before your Val variable name
03:03 - and what this end symbol indicate is the
03:07 - address of this value okay so in
03:11 - somewhere in your computer memory your
03:15 - variable will be stored okay and
03:18 - whenever you write this end in your
03:22 - before your variable name it indicates
03:26 - that your uh you're scanning the address
03:29 - add of this variable okay so whenever
03:34 - some user will enter some value it will
03:36 - be stored at this address and we can
03:40 - access this uh age value after that so
03:45 - when ever I will execute this program
03:47 - you will uh understand it better so it
03:51 - will take the input and depending upon
03:54 - the age the user has enter for example
03:58 - the age if the age is greater
04:02 - than
04:05 - 18 or 18 we will print that the age is
04:12 - so if the age is greater than 18 we are
04:15 - checking the some condition here this is
04:17 - our condition AG age is greater than 18
04:21 - and in here we are going to print or
04:24 - execute some codes for example printing
04:26 - something that the age
04:31 - is greater than
04:35 - 18 greater than 18 okay now for example
04:41 - we want to check that if the age is
04:44 - equal to 18 then we can use some more if
04:49 - conditions so if the age is equal to 18
04:53 - now to uh calculate or to compare equal
04:58 - to we need to use double equal sign
05:02 - because when if you use single equal to
05:05 - sign it will assign 18 to age but we
05:09 - want to compare these two values uh and
05:12 - to compare these two values we use
05:14 - double equal to here okay now if the age
05:18 - is equal to 18 then we will print the
05:22 - age
05:24 - is equal to 18 okay equal 2 18
05:30 - and here greater
05:32 - than now for example we want to check if
05:35 - the age is less than 18 once again we
05:38 - can use this by if condition and this
05:41 - time we check if the age is less than
05:44 - and less than symbol is this one less
05:47 - than okay if the is is less than then
05:51 - just write
05:54 - less then okay so we are going to check
05:59 - these three conditions if this condition
06:02 - is true this will be executed if this
06:06 - condition is true this one if age is
06:09 - equal to 18 then this will be uh
06:12 - executed otherwise if this condition is
06:14 - true then this code will be executed so
06:18 - th this is condition based code
06:22 - execution I will build the program and
06:25 - run the
06:26 - program and first of all we are going to
06:30 - see this message please enter the age
06:34 - and we are going to enter the age so it
06:36 - says please enter the age I'm going to
06:39 - enter the age for example I enter the
06:41 - age 21 21 is greater than 18 so we are
06:47 - expecting this message to be
06:50 - executed be and because these condition
06:54 - are not met match then these
06:59 - code or these printf messages will not
07:02 - be printed so let's see the output just
07:06 - write 21 and press enter and it says age
07:11 - is greater than 18 which is true age the
07:14 - age is greater than 18 so this condition
07:18 - is true that's why we can see this
07:21 - message and because this condition age
07:24 - is not equal to 18 21 is not equal to 18
07:28 - then this one is not executed and 21 is
07:33 - not less than 18 so this condition is
07:35 - not executed as well but 21 is greater
07:40 - than 18 so this condition is true and
07:42 - this message will be
07:44 - printed now let's try to run this
07:48 - program once
07:49 - again now this time we will uh enter 18
07:53 - okay and now this time we can see the
07:56 - message the age is equal to 18 okay okay
08:00 - so age is equal to 18 because 18 is
08:02 - equal to 18 this condition is true and
08:04 - this is printed and other conditions are
08:08 - not true so their code is not executed
08:11 - once again we enter the age 15 and the
08:15 - third condition is true this time age is
08:18 - less than 18 15 is less than 18 so it
08:22 - says the age is less than 18 which is
08:25 - this
08:26 - message so in this way you can use if
08:29 - conditions in C I hope you have
08:33 - understood this concept please writ
08:34 - comment and subscribe and bye for now
