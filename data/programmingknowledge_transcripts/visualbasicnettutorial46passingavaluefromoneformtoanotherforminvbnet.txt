00:00 - hello guys welcome once again in this
00:02 - video I'm going to show you how to pass
00:04 - values from one form to another in your
00:07 - Visual Basic Windows Form application so
00:10 - I have this uh sample blank project made
00:14 - and first of all what I'm going to do is
00:16 - I'm going to make a second form so I
00:19 - will right click my project and I will
00:21 - go to add new
00:24 - item and in the new item I'm going to
00:27 - add a Windows Form and this form name I
00:31 - will leave as default which is form two
00:34 - and I will click add so that my second
00:38 - form is added now to my first form I
00:43 - will click my first
00:46 - form and in this form what I'm going to
00:48 - do is I'm going to
00:50 - take uh text
00:54 - box and a
00:58 - button
01:00 - so what I want
01:04 - is I want to send whatever
01:07 - I right in this text box and when I
01:11 - click the button I want to pass the
01:14 - values from form one to form two
01:17 - whatever I write in this text box so let
01:21 - me change
01:23 - the font size
01:28 - also
01:32 - so I will select my control and I will
01:37 - change the font size
01:41 - first bold and
01:45 - 18
01:47 - okay
01:49 - and to the text box I'm going to change
01:53 - text
01:57 - as pass
02:03 - string okay now just go to your form
02:10 - two and in here just add a
02:14 - label so I'm going to add a label
02:19 - here and this label also I'm going to
02:23 - change the
02:24 - text
02:28 - as first of all let me change the font
02:32 - size and I will
02:34 - change the text of this
02:39 - as
02:42 - get
02:44 - string okay now whatever I sent from the
02:49 - form number one I want to set this text
02:53 - to this label so what I'm going to do is
02:57 - I will right click my form two and and I
03:00 - will say view code and in this view code
03:03 - of form two I will declare a public
03:07 - variable
03:09 - so just
03:12 - uh go to form two and in here in this
03:16 - public class form two just
03:21 - write public prototype and whatever the
03:26 - name of the variable you want to give so
03:28 - for example
03:32 - string pass this is the name of my
03:35 - string which I want to pass
03:41 - as string so this is a public variable
03:46 - in form two I have declared and just
03:50 - remember this uh string variable name
03:53 - now I'm going to go to form number one
03:56 - and now I'm going to just double click
03:59 - this pass string button here and in here
04:04 - what I'm going to do is I'm going to
04:06 - declare a object of form
04:12 - two so I will write
04:15 - [Music]
04:17 - them
04:19 - obj
04:21 - as
04:24 - new form
04:26 - two so this form two is the name of my
04:29 - form class form two class right and then
04:32 - I will write
04:35 - object dot the string Global string
04:39 - which I have declared here so just copy
04:41 - the name of this uh string which we have
04:45 - declared here so This Global string just
04:50 - copy the name from here and in this
04:54 - button click event just write obj do
04:58 - string
05:00 - pass is equal
05:02 - to and whatever we write in our text box
05:08 - so form one text box name
05:11 - is text box one so I will copy the name
05:14 - of the text box one and I will write
05:17 - here dot
05:20 - text so in the form one what I have
05:24 - declared of instance of form two or the
05:28 - object of form 2 and then I have
05:32 - assigned the string variable or I have
05:36 - exess the string variable which I have
05:38 - declared in the form two as a public
05:40 - variable is equal to whatever I write in
05:43 - the text box one right now I just need
05:47 - to
05:49 - show my form two so I will write obj
05:54 - dot
05:58 - show and and if I want I can hide this
06:02 - form by writing me do hide this is not a
06:08 - necessary step but if you want you can
06:11 - hide this form and just show the other
06:13 - form
06:14 - right and in the second form code what I
06:19 - need to do is just go to the form two
06:24 - and just select your form as a whole so
06:28 - click anywhere in the form and just
06:30 - double click it and in this form load
06:33 - event what I'm going to do is I'll copy
06:35 - the name of my label which is label
06:39 - one okay and in this form load event I
06:43 - will say label one
06:46 - dot
06:47 - text is equal to this string pass which
06:53 - is my Global variable now when I run the
06:58 - program
07:01 - and whatever I write here for example I
07:04 - will
07:05 - write
07:07 - sample string and I will say pass string
07:12 - so I will click this button and you will
07:15 - see here whatever I have written in the
07:18 - form one it's passed to the form
07:22 - two so once again what we can do is we
07:26 - can unhide this form so we can see both
07:31 - the forms at the same time now once
07:33 - again for example I will
07:36 - write
07:39 - hello
07:40 - YouTube
07:42 - and then I will pass the string to the
07:45 - second form so I will press this pass
07:48 - string and you can see here whatever I
07:51 - have written in my form one it's passed
07:54 - to the form two so in this way you can
07:57 - pass not only string but you can pass
08:00 - integer or or other variables from form
08:05 - from form one to form two okay so this
08:09 - need not only
08:12 - be the string variable This Global
08:15 - variable it can be integer it can be
08:18 - float decimal whatever you want you can
08:21 - declare it so I hope you have learned
08:24 - something new this time please rate
08:26 - comment and subscribe and bye for now
