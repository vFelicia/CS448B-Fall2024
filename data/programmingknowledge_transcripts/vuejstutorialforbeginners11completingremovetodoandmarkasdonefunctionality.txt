00:00 - welcome to the tutorial number 11. so in
00:02 - this tutorial we are going to complete
00:05 - remove to do and mark as done
00:07 - functionality and we will complete the
00:09 - remove to do method
00:10 - and also delete also or bind a class
00:13 - which changes the color background to
00:15 - green on completion so this is the part
00:17 - of the markers done functionality
00:20 - and this is the remove to do method
00:22 - which we had created earlier
00:23 - by the name delete to do so this means
00:26 - the same thing we will complete that
00:28 - method
00:28 - and then we will make sure that we
00:32 - that our app works perfectly fine so
00:35 - let's carry on with the code first
00:38 - we can add input type visible checkbox
00:41 - which we have already added
00:43 - so we can add a class to here that is
00:46 - form check input so i'll add this
00:49 - class form check input
00:55 - and let me refresh the page
00:58 - and add a random to do and here you can
01:00 - see it's now becomes
01:02 - looks pretty decent as compared to the
01:03 - earlier one
01:05 - and for this what we can do
01:08 - class is equal to button
01:13 - button
01:16 - danger so this would mark the button
01:19 - as red and let me add it to do
01:23 - yeah so here you can see now both of
01:25 - them have been marked
01:26 - this is marked right and this looks
01:28 - pretty decent
01:29 - so what we can do we can
01:32 - style them both of them side is equal to
01:36 - margin 0 auto
01:40 - and we would style the same as
01:45 - text align is equal to center
01:49 - and the display would be the block
01:54 - let me check with this is this works
01:56 - perfectly fine or not
01:57 - so yeah this is now in center and now we
02:00 - would apply the same styling to the
02:01 - button as well
02:04 - and this would be text display block
02:07 - would be to the center
02:10 - and now when i refresh the page and add
02:13 - a simple to do
02:14 - so here you can see the both of them are
02:16 - in the center
02:17 - and to avoid a spacing between the them
02:20 - between the two you can change either
02:22 - this to one ram or auto
02:24 - or other to the same so let me add
02:28 - another to do
02:28 - yeah now we are done with the style
02:30 - perfectly fine now what i plan to do
02:33 - is first i would call the
02:36 - uh like i'll do one thing
02:42 - first i would bind the check box to this
02:46 - i'll show you to do app.js
02:49 - so this dot uh
02:52 - this is the dunk functionality and done
02:54 - functionality is either false or true
02:57 - so this represents our check box because
03:00 - we are making sure that the check box is
03:03 - binded with this done functionality
03:04 - which is true or false
03:06 - so now what we can do we can bind this
03:10 - to our check box and we can
03:12 - this would add the functionality okay so
03:15 - i'll show you one thing first what i'll
03:18 - do
03:20 - i'll print to do
03:25 - dot done here okay this is just for the
03:28 - debug portion because this will help you
03:31 - so this is false when i clicked on
03:32 - checkbook this should turn out to be
03:34 - true
03:35 - so what i can do i would add the done
03:37 - functionality
03:38 - using the bind method what i can do
03:41 - first i'll
03:42 - add this a name name is equal to
03:46 - done and i'll add
03:49 - id id is same as
03:52 - done so this is option uh
03:55 - this is like i'm hiding name and id this
03:58 - is html part but now
04:00 - comes the view part i'll add v model
04:05 - v model v
04:08 - model is equal to
04:13 - to do dot done
04:16 - okay now i have binded successfully now
04:18 - i'll refresh the page add
04:20 - to do when i click on this it will turn
04:22 - out to be true this
04:23 - button will be true true perfectly fine
04:26 - even there you can see
04:27 - it refreshes itself so this is it true
04:30 - when i click false to false true false
04:33 - true false okay
04:35 - now what i want to do i want to add
04:38 - a class which turns the background to
04:41 - the green okay
04:42 - so what i can do
04:45 - i can add
04:50 - a style component here
04:56 - and okay so i'll complete this so a
04:59 - style component has been added there so
05:01 - first we remove
05:02 - the complete the tool uh done uh the
05:05 - remove functionality
05:07 - that is using the delete button so so
05:09 - what we can do we should call
05:11 - at the right at the right click function
05:13 - to add it
05:14 - click functionality using android click
05:16 - functionality so we will add
05:18 - at the right click in the button
05:22 - so this should be in the middle
05:24 - something yeah so this is fine
05:26 - okay okay i'll add here
05:31 - in just a second sorry
05:35 - i'll cut this v model to do done since
05:38 - this is important part it should be
05:39 - visible clearly
05:41 - yes so this is perfectly fine and i'll
05:44 - add the little click
05:45 - at the red click
05:48 - is equal to so what was the name of our
05:52 - method that is was delete to do
05:54 - right so this was the name delete to do
06:01 - and we are passing
06:05 - i told you that we use a for loop for
06:07 - every list component that is
06:10 - to do in two do's right so this was our
06:13 - v
06:13 - for to do introduce with key is a two
06:15 - dot id now we are passing a to do
06:18 - we are passing a to do here to delete
06:21 - so that it could pass to the delete
06:23 - functionality and
06:24 - it could delete it okay right so for
06:28 - that
06:28 - what we are going to do we are using
06:30 - going to use the splice method
06:33 - of js so
06:36 - remove to do so like delete to do
06:41 - and this is first we get the index
06:46 - constant index
06:51 - is equal to this dot to do's
06:57 - dot index
07:00 - of to do so first we get the particular
07:05 - index
07:06 - using this method and then what we do
07:10 - this dot to do's
07:14 - dot splice okay
07:18 - dot splice index comma one
07:21 - uh this one represents how many delete
07:23 - count number
07:24 - so that is one we need to only remove
07:26 - the one okay
07:28 - now we refresh the page let us
07:31 - start with the console add to do delete
07:35 - perfectly fine add to do had to do
07:39 - had to do now we delete our delete
07:41 - delete and
07:43 - delete so we delete everything one by
07:45 - one so this is i'll explain you again
07:47 - once again so this was the index so this
07:50 - was this dot two rules dot index of to
07:52 - do
07:53 - first we got the index and then we
07:55 - remove using this price method
07:56 - that at this particular index we want to
07:58 - pop that item out
08:00 - so this was the removal now
08:03 - we need to add a class that would change
08:05 - the background to the green
08:07 - and for that what we are going to use we
08:10 - are going to use
08:10 - v bind method so this is very simple
08:14 - so we wind method is like
08:18 - like we bind a class like if this is
08:21 - true okay so by we which we mean that if
08:26 - this is true
08:26 - then binder class v bind
08:30 - class is equal to
08:35 - okay so now we add a class
08:41 - done done class
08:44 - on the functionality to do dot done
08:48 - because i told you that if this is true
08:50 - then this class should be active
08:52 - okay then we will make a done class here
08:56 - done class
09:00 - okay and i add first font
09:04 - size uh okay one size is equal to
09:09 - 100 pixels just for the just for the
09:11 - sake i'm just try trying out if this is
09:12 - working or not
09:14 - i do done class is this
09:19 - okay true is this right
09:24 - okay i'll get to know i'll click on
09:25 - inspect
09:29 - so when i click true
09:35 - okay
09:38 - so we can add background
09:45 - uh wait a second i'll do color is equal
09:48 - to green
09:54 - and i'll refresh this page
10:00 - so here you can see when i click on true
10:03 - so the color
10:04 - is green so that functionality was not
10:06 - working but now it works perfectly fine
10:08 - color is equal to green
10:09 - and the background color should be also
10:12 - green
10:12 - background color should be green let me
10:15 - mark this background also as green
10:19 - and this should become
10:24 - this should become white i hope this is
10:27 - fine
10:30 - okay and yeah
10:34 - okay so added to do
10:38 - okay mark is done so here you can see
10:40 - the background changes out to be green
10:42 - and the text becomes white
10:43 - when i do false the default color is
10:46 - back
10:47 - so this is now we have completed our
10:48 - to-do app
10:50 - you can add to those and delete them as
10:53 - well delete
10:55 - add mark is done green so this one is
10:58 - white
10:59 - marker then it also becomes green okay
11:02 - added to do this one is white so you can
11:04 - delete it delete this one and perfectly
11:06 - fine so app works perfectly fine
