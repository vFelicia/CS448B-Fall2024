00:00 - hello everyone welcome to programming
00:01 - knowledge so I again welcome you all to
00:04 - programming knowledge so guys this is
00:05 - the 21st tutorial of a django series and
00:08 - this is the github link of our poetry so
00:11 - you can download the coke alone this
00:12 - project from here and I have to find
00:15 - blow the instructions how you can run
00:16 - this project on your local machine so
00:18 - let's get started with this so basically
00:20 - what we are going to do we would in this
00:22 - tutorial what we are going to do the
00:24 - valuation of query and adding a try
00:26 - except block in this tutorial this
00:28 - continuation of tutorial number 20 in
00:30 - this view would evaluate query as well
00:32 - as a try except law so we will implement
00:35 - evaluation try except block and render
00:37 - to front-end part so this is going to be
00:39 - an interesting tutorial so let's get
00:41 - started with this
00:41 - so basically till now we had defined our
00:44 - submit query route and we were taking
00:46 - request or the quiet query and Q then we
00:48 - returned an HTTP response of Q so
00:50 - basically what we can do I can type any
00:52 - math in the mathematical equation light
00:54 - is two plus three so I would submit this
00:56 - and it returns me to persley so this
00:59 - looks good so we can move to the back
01:01 - back page home page index page so
01:03 - basically this we are making a
01:05 - application so basically about then
01:08 - instructions so you can check this force
01:12 - in nature as well ctrl shift I ok and
01:14 - this is an app bar and then instruction
01:17 - from this so what we can also try like
01:21 - if you scroll down the page what you see
01:23 - the nav bar is name but we cannot see
01:26 - the number on the top if we scroll down
01:28 - the page like we on the top of the page
01:30 - as soon as you scroll down the page we
01:32 - don't see the number on the top so this
01:34 - is like what you can do on the number
01:37 - class we can move to the nav bar class
01:39 - and try type fixed top so what would it
01:45 - do like and refresh this page so like
01:50 - and refresh this page and you can see
01:52 - here is an app per okay and when you
01:54 - press control-shift eyes when you scroll
01:56 - down the page you see the number is
01:58 - fixed on the top so this is an initial
02:00 - utility off to your front-end part if
02:03 - you want to carry on with this then is
02:04 - absolutely fine
02:05 - so I just showed you like you can fix
02:07 - the nav bar on top when you scroll down
02:09 - the page so as soon as I remove this
02:11 - fish stop pit stop so
02:13 - what I observe when i refresh this okay
02:17 - so the number is looking on the top but
02:19 - as soon as scroll it disappeared so you
02:21 - can choose a boost charity to your part
02:24 - if you want to use the fixed top edition
02:26 - your utility of Naga okay
02:28 - so now we move to use dot py file so we
02:31 - would are you trying sub-block try if
02:35 - this is successful and accept okay so
02:39 - this is fine so what we are going to do
02:41 - we are taking an answer is equal to eval
02:45 - eval is an inbred is an inbuilt function
02:50 - in Python which it takes a string as a
02:53 - string as a mathematical equation then
02:56 - evaluates it and returns an basically
02:59 - the answer to that mathematical equation
03:03 - okay so what you can do answer is equal
03:06 - to the valve Q then I would define my
03:10 - dictionary my dictionary so basically
03:16 - the Q would remain the Q okay and the
03:20 - answer would be the answer and if this
03:24 - operation is successfully if this tribe
03:26 - block gets executed so I would say error
03:31 - is false
03:33 - okay so this should work fine to know
03:36 - and if if what I can do if if this is
03:44 - true like what I mean to say this if
03:47 - this operation is successful then I
03:49 - would return render return render
03:54 - request then index dot HTML and then I
04:03 - would context is equal to my big theory
04:09 - okay if this is true then till time till
04:13 - the time being I would say pass is equal
04:15 - to I'm a DAP a statement to the except
04:19 - block because it was showing an error
04:21 - because so this should work fine okay
04:24 - now what I can do if this
04:27 - true then this should work fine okay
04:30 - then
04:32 - like I'll move to my index.html this is
04:35 - a navbar navbar okay fine yeah so this
04:38 - is the container fluid so their class is
04:41 - equal to Rho then their class is equal
04:46 - to call em d6 style would be margin auto
04:55 - zero style will do margin:0 auto okay so
05:02 - if this okay what I can do
05:06 - percent if error
05:08 - so basically four percent if error
05:12 - because I am trying to say if means if
05:15 - error was true so it would show the
05:17 - error okay so if true then I would do
05:20 - something else if error is for the by
05:23 - mean there is no error then I would use
05:26 - else part to show the result then I
05:30 - would end this end if I would end this a
05:35 - pulse equation with an F at okay this is
05:39 - this looks good
05:40 - okay so portion and if it wasn't else
05:44 - okay good so what I can do
05:48 - alert and move the load and I will copy
05:51 - this and if this is an error okay so
05:56 - what I can do is quickly a better sorry
06:06 - there is an error or you can simply type
06:10 - sorry an error is fine strong and to do
06:17 - this you would use alert warning not
06:19 - alert danger okay and in the else part
06:25 - you need to show that if the data could
06:28 - result over successfully so I'll copy
06:30 - this okay and I'll use alert alert
06:37 - success
06:40 - so first we are going to test our
06:42 - application so we will move to the page
06:46 - as refresh this
06:48 - okay so first focus up there is some
06:54 - issue here with the okay
07:03 - div class we will do a note to call mv6
07:17 - okay I need to check this like a better
07:23 - yes yes okay I'll move this equation
07:34 - okay the if Clause would call him the
07:37 - six yes and here is the yes yeah now
07:48 - this is absolutely working fine and
07:49 - editor showing me in green color let me
07:51 - check this okay okay okay because this
07:56 - was cancer okay yeah okay okay so let me
08:08 - go with this two plus three
08:10 - yeah two plus three is five so this
08:13 - looks fine okay so yes two plus three is
08:17 - equal to five so let me do perform some
08:19 - mathematical equation 2 plus 3 star for
08:23 - 14 okay yeah this is gold good and let
08:28 - me define some equation let me do two
08:32 - plus three divided by two like this will
08:38 - do value to 5 then 5 divided by 2 2
08:40 - point 5 this should return to point 5
08:41 - yes but if I do the same equation bit
08:44 - lower division that is 2 okay we can try
08:50 - some more mathematical operations like
08:53 - to the power 3 yeah this is a so what
08:58 - you can do
08:59 - so like a you can add add this like
09:04 - double star for exponential exponential
09:13 - like you can add this double star for
09:18 - exponential okay and in the same way you
09:22 - can add modernist modulus as well Maude
09:33 - Maude Maude so this would like this is
09:37 - for the more operation okay so basically
09:41 - more operation is to get a remitted you
09:43 - can quickly perform more operation like
09:45 - this is n modulus 3 so it should give
09:54 - one I guess yes this is one so
09:56 - absolutely correct so like I will
09:59 - quickly explain this so like we added
10:02 - explanation operator hazards to try to
10:04 - explain five double star 5 so and then
10:09 - minus 2 so this is 25 okay thank you
10:16 - quickly good bases here so this is 25
10:20 - minus 23 there might be some error I
10:30 - okay I made a mistake I'm really sorry
10:32 - for that that was 5 to the power 5 if
10:35 - I'm not wrong that is 5 to the power 5
10:37 - then minus 2 okay so the 5 to the power
10:40 - 5 was 3 1 2 5 10 minus 2 return 3 1 2 3
10:45 - basically what I meant was 5 square so
10:48 - that was 5 to the double star 2 minus 2
10:52 - that is 5 square is 25 minus 2 is 23 so
10:55 - basically we are tested with the
10:56 - application and one thing I would show
10:57 - then a person√≠s at type 1 divided by 0
11:00 - this is an error so it should return me
11:03 - an error so it returned then you can
11:07 - should be response object so we'll go to
11:08 - the user py file so so we'll continue
11:12 - this my dictionary
11:15 - error is equal to true okay and in the
11:23 - same way my dictionary of error is equal
11:29 - to true so what you can do or you can
11:33 - define a new dictionary here error is
11:38 - true and I should return the same page
11:42 - with the context is automatic sorry yes
11:46 - so I have not now I will go back to the
11:49 - page now 1/2 0 yeah
11:52 - now this also caption if you find that 1
11:54 - divided by 0 was an error so it through
11:57 - to me an error
11:58 - ok then again there is an issue with the
12:01 - front end part so let me check de plus 2
12:08 - yes do get better ok error there is an
12:21 - error on this front end on the front end
12:24 - part let me check
12:45 - okay then I will show that this is a
12:53 - deal okay so this district : MD and the
13:01 - three two ends to row if this error then
13:04 - you describe this row else on the else
13:07 - part what we can do Dave class is able
13:13 - to row okay good then again I'll define
13:22 - sorry sorry sorry Dave plus is able to
13:28 - call mv6 yes now I would close this tail
13:36 - okay this is a dip now this is a dip to
13:39 - the cold and another tip to the row and
13:45 - this is a do container this this should
13:48 - not be to the content of do it yes now
13:53 - we'll move to the page yeah now this is
13:56 - absolutely looking fine not 1/0 will
13:59 - quickly test the application when
14:03 - divided by zero error yeah down the
14:05 - front end is good and quickly 2 Plus 3
14:07 - is equal to 5/2 plus C is equal to 5 and
14:12 - this is on the left
14:14 - okay let me check let me check this is a
14:18 - call MV 6 hip error okay okay let me
14:27 - move this
14:36 - okay let me click on inspect inspect I
14:40 - am this column the sixth margin:0 auto
14:45 - okay I'll let me change the view at 8:00
14:54 - I'll add a laptop screen yeah this is
15:01 - working fine this is no this is I'm
15:03 - inside the row coal is you can be six so
15:06 - style you go to margin:0 auto yes okay
15:13 - okay okay okay
15:14 - yes slide is about to margin:0 auto so
15:21 - yes now this should work okay we'll
15:24 - quickly two plus three is equal to five
15:26 - or will type two plus three sir for
15:29 - voting occurred now one divided by zero
15:33 - so basically you need to tackle errors
15:36 - when the because now we are completely
15:38 - done with the application now here you
15:40 - can see like we get an error on
15:42 - evaluating on when we put the zero as an
15:44 - input
15:45 - let me type 1 minus one this should be
15:49 - our return zero not now absolutely
15:51 - absolutely fine so let me tie in some
15:53 - random words like something something is
15:55 - random and what does it show
15:58 - so dude shows an error as well okay on
16:00 - random input so basically you can put
16:02 - numbers like you can cook cookie put
16:05 - numbers then reset it okay then again
16:08 - put numbers then submit here then 40
16:10 - then one zero it will show error yeah on
16:13 - random text on random text it would also
16:17 - show that it so guys were completely
16:19 - done with their application so thank you
16:21 - guys thank you so much I'll catch up in
16:23 - the next lecture so basically the error
16:26 - on the front end part how I resolved it
16:28 - as quickly if there was a terror so I
16:30 - made an new row
16:32 - particular row for that okay so it and
16:35 - the cone md fix both on the margin:0
16:38 - auto of center and if there is no error
16:40 - so I would return the answer and in the
16:43 - same way what you can do you can simply
16:47 - add
16:48 - q is equal to this so basically this
16:52 - would return the two area as well so so
16:55 - we can do two custody yes so it says two
16:59 - plus three is you will do five so so
17:02 - this is absolutely correct so yeah now
17:05 - this looks a pollution looks pretty good
17:07 - so you can try out the front end part so
17:09 - just just try to we'll also try the
17:12 - sponsor nature of this path as well so I
17:14 - have no control shift I okay so
17:18 - basically I had type something to double
17:22 - star three okay so two double star is
17:26 - equal to eight
17:27 - yeah so right this is absolutely fine so
17:29 - thank you guys thank you so much I'll
17:30 - catch up in the next nature so I have to
17:33 - get some exponential as models operator
17:35 - you can try out some modulus of greater
17:37 - than ten modify ten mode five so this
17:41 - should be zero yes so thank you guys
17:44 - thank you so much I'll catch up in the
17:46 - next lecture so thank you so much at
17:49 - everyone so like a hello I saw an error
17:52 - in this application like when we go to
17:54 - the index page without any query
17:56 - submission I see a equal to sign so
17:58 - actually this equal to sign is basically
18:00 - to do to this else part so we need to
18:03 - get just a little bit different logic so
18:05 - what we can do we can do we will move to
18:08 - used or PFI and here we can do result
18:12 - result is equal to true okay yes and
18:18 - I'll quickly copy this and in this part
18:21 - I would do result if the error that it
18:24 - is fall then resulted should true it is
18:26 - true the result should be false
18:28 - okay good now I would move to my
18:31 - index.html page so I would if this
18:34 - condition with an ended person tent a
18:38 - and I would give this else part as a
18:41 - result okay so this is this look good
18:45 - and this would y dot error so I'll
18:48 - quickly test for application when I move
18:50 - to the index page yes now that equal to
18:53 - sign has gone now I would query to Percy
18:56 - rule to submit yes five is good then one
18:59 - plus zero the error should be there
19:01 - yeah but when I move to the index page
19:04 - when I move to the index page so there
19:07 - is no equal to sign so that is a bit a
19:09 - little bit of logical error but I have
19:11 - no character so thank you guys thank you
19:13 - so
