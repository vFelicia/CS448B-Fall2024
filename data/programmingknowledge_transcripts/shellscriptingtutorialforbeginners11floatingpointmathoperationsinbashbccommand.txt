00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - shell scripting tutorials for beginners
00:03 - in the last video we have seen how we
00:06 - can perform basic Electra Matic
00:08 - operations in shell scripting now in
00:12 - this video we will see how we can
00:14 - perform the same automatic operations on
00:17 - decimal numbers now by default the
00:21 - scripting doesn't support decimal number
00:24 - or thematic operations using these two
00:27 - method which I have shown you in the
00:29 - last video now we need to use a special
00:32 - tool and there are many tools and I am
00:36 - going to show you one of the tools which
00:38 - are frequently used to perform automatic
00:42 - operations on decimal numbers but first
00:45 - I will show you what the problem with
00:47 - these two method and we want to perform
00:51 - the automatic operation on decimal
00:54 - number so for example instead of 20 I
00:58 - will just take 20 point 5 here and I
01:02 - want to see the result what I get when I
01:05 - perform the these addition or
01:09 - subtraction or multiplication division
01:11 - or modulus operations on these two
01:15 - numbers right so let me run the script
01:18 - and let's see what happens so you can
01:20 - see we got this error that this is
01:25 - invalid the automatic operator and you
01:29 - know you can see these kind of errors
01:31 - here right so when the value is decimal
01:35 - shell scripting of the bash scripting
01:38 - does not perform these are automatic
01:40 - operations on those numbers here also it
01:43 - says non integer argument for using
01:46 - whenever you be used exp our command it
01:50 - says non integer argument right so we
01:54 - need to use a special tool which is
01:57 - called BC BC stands for basic calculator
02:01 - and most of the time it comes with your
02:05 - Linux distribution right so you can just
02:11 - search for BC you can do man
02:14 - BC here and then press ENTER and you
02:17 - will be able to see this kind of man
02:20 - page of BC and by definition you can see
02:25 - BC is an arbitrary precision calculator
02:29 - language so it's a language in itself
02:33 - for basic calculations right now if you
02:38 - want to know more about this command you
02:42 - can read what are the options we can use
02:46 - in with BC or you know what we can do
02:50 - with BC right but for now we want to do
02:53 - the basic arithmetic operations so let
02:57 - me clear this script and in here also we
03:02 - will just remove this and for now what
03:05 - we want to do is some basic arithmetic
03:08 - operations let scripting so how we can
03:12 - perform these operations so what we do
03:15 - is we basically for example what what up
03:18 - with whatever integers or decimal values
03:22 - you want to perform this automatic
03:25 - operations you just need to write those
03:28 - integers for example I want to add
03:31 - twenty point five plus five for example
03:36 - and if I want to do this automatic
03:40 - operation I can use a pipe symbol here
03:43 - and then the BC command okay
03:46 - and this basically means is whatever
03:50 - come on you use on the left hand side we
03:52 - are using this echo and this text on the
03:57 - left hand side will be treated as an
04:00 - input for the command on the right hand
04:03 - side of this pipe okay so this will be
04:10 - treated as an input for the BC command
04:14 - okay and let's see what happens when we
04:17 - run the script once again so let's run
04:19 - the script once again and it gives us
04:21 - the answer right it gives
04:24 - twenty-five point five which is true and
04:27 - we can do the different automatic
04:29 - operations using this PC command
04:32 - so let's perform them so for example I
04:34 - want to do the subtraction I want to do
04:37 - the multiplication for example and I
04:40 - want to do the division and I want to do
04:43 - the modulus operation and let's run the
04:47 - script once again it does give the
04:50 - answer of each operation so addition
04:53 - gives us the right answer subtraction is
04:55 - also correct you can see here
04:57 - multiplication is also correct division
05:00 - in the case of division you can see it
05:03 - gives a give it's giving us four right
05:05 - and it's not giving us the proper value
05:10 - of division and I will tell you why and
05:13 - I will also tell you how we can solve
05:16 - this problem right but modulus operation
05:19 - is giving us the correct value so we
05:21 - want to solve this problem which is for
05:24 - the division so to solve this problem we
05:26 - need to set a variable scale for this
05:31 - division operation and how we can do it
05:34 - we can just write scale here so just
05:37 - write scale and then we need to set the
05:40 - value of scale for example we want to
05:43 - have the result up to two decimal places
05:46 - then we can do scale is equal to two so
05:50 - scale is the value we want the decimal
05:53 - places to be right so we want the two
05:57 - decimal places then scale can be two you
06:00 - want the 20 wrestle places then the
06:02 - scale can be 20 right and once again we
06:05 - run the script and you can see this time
06:08 - we got the correct result so always use
06:12 - the scale whenever you use the division
06:16 - operation right and division operation
06:19 - or scale is just our decimal point value
06:23 - whatever you want so if I write here 20
06:26 - decimal points or 20 as a scale and when
06:30 - I run the script you can see I get the
06:33 - result up to 20 decimal points right
06:38 - so this is how you can use BC but BC as
06:43 - you have seen in the main pages it's not
06:46 - just for arithmetic operations it can do
06:50 - much more than that so for example we
06:53 - want to calculate the square root of
06:57 - some number or if you want to do some
07:00 - trigonometric operations with BC you can
07:05 - do everything now we have seen as we
07:07 - have done this arithmetic operations
07:09 - with these decimal values but what if we
07:12 - have these two you know variables and we
07:16 - need to use these variables in place of
07:19 - these values so to do this you can just
07:22 - do like this as you do with variables so
07:26 - variable number one plus dollar num -
07:32 - mum - okay same you can do with other
07:36 - you know other values so instead of this
07:41 - you can just - - here and so on right
07:45 - and let's run the script once again and
07:48 - it gives us the same result
07:50 - so whenever you want to use the variable
07:51 - use the dollar symbol with the variable
07:54 - and the arithmetic operation you want to
07:56 - perform now I was talking about the
07:59 - square root so how we can perform the
08:01 - square root or something so say I have a
08:06 - number once again I will declare a
08:09 - variable num and its value is for
08:13 - example I will say 27 okay and I want to
08:17 - do the square root of 27 so I can just
08:21 - do echo and then first of all I will set
08:25 - the scale to be 2 for example so scale
08:28 - is equal to 2 and then the semicolon and
08:32 - then there is a function called square
08:35 - root or sq RT so you just use sq RT and
08:40 - then in the bracket you can use the
08:44 - variable for which you want to calculate
08:47 - the square root so I want to calculate
08:51 - the square
08:51 - of this variable or this number so I can
08:55 - do something like this now after this as
08:59 - you already have guessed we use BC but
09:02 - alone of it BC command it will not work
09:05 - because this is a math operation and to
09:10 - use this math operation we need to use
09:13 - the math library with this BC command
09:17 - and to use this math library you just
09:19 - need to write minus L for that right and
09:22 - minus L for calling the math library in
09:25 - which the square root function is okay
09:29 - and let's run the script once again let
09:32 - me clear the terminal and run the script
09:34 - once again and you can see the last
09:36 - value here is the square root of 27
09:40 - which is correct you can do the square
09:43 - root of 27 and you will get this result
09:46 - right for example I want to do the
09:49 - square root of 4 and I want to run the
09:53 - script once again you can see the result
09:55 - is 2 which is easier to understand right
09:58 - now for example I want to perform for
10:02 - example I want to get the power of 4
10:04 - something so something to the power of
10:06 - something how we can get it so for this
10:10 - we just need to use whatever integer I
10:14 - have so for example I want to get 3 to
10:17 - the power 3 I can write 3 and then this
10:21 - symbol I don't know what we call the
10:24 - symbol for example cap symbol and then 3
10:28 - ok
10:29 - so this means to the power okay so 3 to
10:32 - the power 3 and once again we can run
10:35 - the script and it gives us 27 which is
10:38 - correct 3 to the power 3 is 27 so there
10:42 - are many math operations you can perform
10:44 - the width BC and you can do a man BC for
10:50 - reference so you can give this command
10:53 - and you can go little bit down so you
10:55 - can see for calling the math library
10:58 - which we have used here we use minus L
11:02 - Flags is for interactive mode
11:05 - W is for warning as is for standard q is
11:09 - for quit whenever we run the BC command
11:14 - on terminal this is handy command to
11:17 - quit out of the BC command and then V is
11:21 - for version and then when I scroll a
11:24 - little bit down I can see what are the
11:27 - operation I can do with the BC command
11:30 - so I can do post increment or pre
11:34 - increment you can see here
11:35 - multiplication and subtraction division
11:38 - modular of operation and you can see
11:41 - this is for calculating ^ something
11:45 - right and then we have other operations
11:48 - here also so comparison also you can do
11:51 - with BC commands and all the logical
11:54 - operations you can do and we have called
11:57 - this function or method which is used to
12:02 - calculate the square root which is this
12:04 - one right so you can read this man page
12:07 - and you can see what are the things you
12:11 - can do with BC come on so just to man BC
12:14 - and you will be good to go so I hope
