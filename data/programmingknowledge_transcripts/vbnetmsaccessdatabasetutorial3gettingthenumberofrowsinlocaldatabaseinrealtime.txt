00:00 - hello guys welcome once again in this
00:02 - video I'm going to show you how you can
00:05 - uh show the number of row count uh in
00:09 - here in some label at real time so for
00:14 - example I have this uh table here right
00:17 - and I want to know how many rows of data
00:22 - I have uh and I want to show it here in
00:25 - the message because this data will
00:28 - change you will uh you know delete some
00:31 - data you will add some data and in case
00:34 - of uh a big data for example thousands
00:37 - of rows if you need to know of how many
00:41 - rows or how many uh number of uh data I
00:45 - have or how many employees I have in my
00:49 - case then I can show it here and I will
00:53 - show you how you can do it okay so what
00:56 - you need to do first is uh just go to
00:59 - your tool back box and search for the
01:01 - tool called timer and drag and drop into
01:05 - your form and as soon as as you will
01:09 - drag and drop this timer into your form
01:12 - you will see it will not go directly
01:14 - into your form but it will go here at
01:16 - the bottom okay so it's fine that it
01:19 - goes here and its name is timer one okay
01:23 - so just remember the name now the second
01:27 - thing what you need to do is just select
01:29 - your form as a whole so you need to
01:32 - select your form anywhere not any tool
01:36 - but the form form as a whole okay and
01:39 - double click it and you will reach to
01:42 - the form load event of uh
01:46 - your your project okay so just uh see
01:50 - that it's form load event and in
01:53 - here just go down and in here you need
01:57 - to write timer
02:00 - one which is our timer name
02:04 - dot start and what this code will do
02:10 - is as soon as your uh form will load or
02:14 - as soon as you will start running your
02:17 - program this timer will start okay so
02:21 - this is uh the code which will start
02:24 - your timer okay now once again go to
02:27 - your design view and in here
02:30 - select your timer tool from here just
02:32 - select it and double click it and you
02:34 - will go to the timer one tick event okay
02:39 - and in here what we are going to do is
02:42 - we will declare a variable which is int
02:46 - so we will say
02:50 - dim count
02:54 - as
02:58 - integer okay and and in the next line I
03:01 - will say
03:02 - count is equal
03:05 - to and then I
03:08 - will take the name of my employee
03:12 - binding source so my employee data
03:15 - binding Source name is employee data
03:17 - binding Source right so I will
03:21 - say employee datab binding
03:26 - Source dot count
03:30 - okay and now in the next line what I
03:34 - will do is I Will Show discount in the
03:38 - label so I will go to my design view and
03:41 - I will take a label from my toolbox so
03:45 - search for the
03:48 - label
03:49 - label yeah it's it is so I will drag and
03:54 - drop a label here in my toolbx and uh uh
04:00 - I will increase the font size of this
04:02 - label so we can see it so I will go to
04:05 - the label properties here and I will
04:08 - search for the property called
04:11 - font click this
04:15 - property and in here I will select bold
04:18 - 14 or 16 okay so now we will be able to
04:22 - see our label better okay and now what
04:27 - you need to do is once again go to this
04:30 - timer take event or just select your
04:32 - timer one and double click it and in
04:35 - here we will write label one which is
04:38 - the name of our label okay in case you
04:40 - don't know how to know the name of the
04:43 - label just select your NAB label and see
04:47 - in the properties what is the name of
04:49 - your label by default it will be label
04:51 - one but yeah you can see it like this so
04:56 - you can say label
04:58 - dot text
05:00 - is equal
05:01 - to count okay so you can just uh show uh
05:06 - the count or number of rows in your
05:08 - label but just to make it a little bit
05:11 - better I can add the text to it so I I
05:15 - can
05:17 - say
05:23 - there
05:25 - R and then I will give a plus sign here
05:30 - which will concatenate our do our string
05:33 - and
05:34 - discount and once again I will give a
05:36 - plus sign and I will once again give
05:40 - these double quotes and I will say there
05:43 - are this much amount
05:48 - of employees for example in my case you
05:52 - can change this text according to your
05:54 - data right okay now when I run the
05:58 - program
06:03 - and it's not showing anything right now
06:06 - and it shows error let's see what's the
06:10 - error and it says conversion from string
06:13 - there are to double is not valid right
06:17 - this is true because we are trying to
06:21 - convert our integer value to a string
06:25 - what you can do is just go to the code
06:28 - once again and in here we have written
06:30 - there are and then plus count so this is
06:34 - a integer and this is a string and this
06:37 - is not valid that you can conc you
06:39 - cannot concatenate string and integer in
06:43 - the same line so you need to go to this
06:45 - count variable and just write dot to
06:48 - string so this will convert your integer
06:51 - to your to the string and that now it
06:54 - will work fine hopefully I'll run the
06:56 - program and now you can see there are 12
07:00 - employee
07:02 - right so I can count the number 1 2 3 4
07:09 - 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 right so it gives me
07:14 - the right data for example I will add a
07:17 - new data so I will say add new and I
07:21 - will give a new data for employee ID 14
07:26 - some name some
07:27 - surname and Country
07:31 - USA phone
07:33 - number and pay and I will say
07:38 - save save data so data is
07:41 - saved and
07:43 - now it will
07:46 - refresh so you may have observed that
07:50 - whenever I click this add new here your
07:55 - account will increase so I will once
07:57 - again add new and your account will
08:00 - increase and for example I will add 15th
08:05 - employee
08:07 - name and country name
08:12 - here okay once
08:16 - again and I want to choose this here
08:20 - this date okay and the phone number and
08:24 - the
08:25 - pay and
08:27 - save Okay so you will see the number of
08:31 - employee changing here whenever you add
08:34 - some data or remove some data so for
08:37 - example I will select this and remove
08:39 - this your number of employee immediately
08:42 - updates right so in this way you can
08:45 - count the number of rows in your table
08:49 - at real time I hope you have enjoyed
