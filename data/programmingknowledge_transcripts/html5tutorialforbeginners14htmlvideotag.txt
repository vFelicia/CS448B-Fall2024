00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - HTML 5 tutorial for beginners in this
00:05 - video we will see how we can add and use
00:08 - video element in
00:10 - HTML so to add a video element in HTML
00:14 - you need to use this element called
00:17 - video and uh this video takes the source
00:21 - of the video so just go between these
00:26 - video element and add a ele ment called
00:30 - Source okay and then you can provide the
00:34 - source of your video here so to add a
00:37 - source uh I have this video which I have
00:40 - made in the last video I'm going to just
00:43 - drag and drop into my web content folder
00:46 - and it will copy this into my web
00:49 - content folder so just leave this option
00:51 - copy files and click okay and it's going
00:54 - to add this inside my web content folder
00:58 - same I'm going to do with with a picture
01:01 - which I have so I have a PNG picture and
01:05 - I'm going to drag and drop into my web
01:07 - content folder this also this picture
01:10 - I'm going to use as a poster for the
01:13 - video in the later section but first of
01:16 - all let's see how we can add this source
01:19 - to our video element so to add this uh
01:23 - video to the source you just need to
01:25 - write the name of your video which is
01:27 - HTML 5
01:30 - MP4 and you can also add the type of
01:34 - video you are adding so just add an
01:36 - attribute called type and in here just
01:39 - write video/ MP4 so it's a MP4 video
01:44 - okay now you can refresh your page and
01:48 - now you can see this video but it will
01:51 - not start automatically because we
01:53 - haven't added any flag for starting
01:57 - right so let's add a flag for
02:01 - automatically restarting this video so
02:05 - in your video element just add an
02:07 - attribute called auto play and save your
02:12 - code and refresh
02:13 - it hello guys welcome to the next and
02:16 - now your video will start playing okay
02:21 - now you will still not see the controls
02:24 - to stop or pause this video so to pause
02:28 - or to have for more control for volume
02:31 - and maximizing and minimizing you can
02:34 - add an attribute called controls here so
02:37 - just add an attribute called controls
02:41 - and save your code and refresh the web
02:43 - page and now you can see these controls
02:47 - here so you have this uh play and pause
02:50 - button you have this volume button you
02:52 - have this full screen uh button here
02:55 - right so this control attribute adds the
02:59 - control to your video right now there is
03:03 - one more attribute which you can add
03:05 - here is Loop and what this does is it
03:09 - will provide the loop to your video so
03:11 - for example your video is finished here
03:14 - and then it will be replayed again and
03:17 - again until and unless you stops it now
03:19 - there is one more attribute here which
03:22 - is called muted so when you add this
03:25 - attribute called muted and save your
03:28 - code and refresh it
03:30 - then your video will be muted when it
03:34 - will be loaded so you can see it's muted
03:38 - when it's loaded right now suppose you
03:41 - want to give the size to your video so
03:43 - right now it's in its maximum size now
03:47 - you want to limit the size of your video
03:50 - what you can do here is you can add an
03:52 - attribute called width and you can give
03:56 - the width in pixel so you can give for
03:59 - example example 500 and same you can do
04:02 - for height so just add this height
04:05 - attribute and you can give the amount of
04:09 - pixel you want okay save your code and
04:12 - refresh it and now your video will be
04:15 - resized okay so let's say it's 600 by
04:20 - 300 okay so save your code and uh once
04:24 - again refresh it and it resizes your
04:28 - video okay now for example you want to
04:31 - give the banner or poster to your video
04:36 - so this is your video but whenever your
04:39 - web page loads you want to show some
04:41 - poster on your video so how you can add
04:44 - it you can add it something like this so
04:46 - just add a attribute called poster here
04:51 - and give the location of the picture you
04:53 - want to add here so just add this uh for
04:58 - example I have this HT ml
05:00 - 5.png I can add it here so
05:03 - HTML
05:06 - 5.png
05:08 - G and save your code and refresh it and
05:13 - you will see the picture but because
05:15 - it's in autoplay mode so let's remove
05:18 - this autoplay mode and save your code
05:20 - and refresh it once again now you can
05:23 - see this picture and when you start it
05:26 - your video will be started okay so in
