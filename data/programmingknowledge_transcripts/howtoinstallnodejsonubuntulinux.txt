00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can download and install
00:03 - node.js on your Rubin to operating
00:05 - system so there can be several ways in
00:08 - which you can install node.js on your
00:11 - window operating system and I'm going to
00:13 - show you a few different options of
00:15 - installing node.js on your Ubuntu
00:17 - operating system so first of all I would
00:20 - recommend you to watch the complete
00:22 - video and then decide which option you
00:25 - want to opt for so let's get started so
00:28 - just open your terminal by just pressing
00:31 - ctrl alt T and when your terminal is
00:34 - opened just write sudo apt - cash show
00:39 - and then the package name which is
00:42 - node.js and then press Enter and give
00:45 - your open two password and here you will
00:49 - see that the version if you want to
00:53 - install node.js from the ubuntu
00:56 - repositories the version which is
00:58 - available here is ten point nineteen
01:01 - point zero at the time of making this
01:03 - video and when you go to the node.js dot
01:08 - o-r-g website you can see the latest
01:10 - version is fourteen point three point
01:13 - zero and the LTS version which is the
01:17 - long-term support version is twelve
01:19 - point nineteen point zero so you can see
01:22 - that when you install node.js using apt
01:25 - install node.js then you are going to
01:29 - get this version so as I mentioned you
01:32 - can install the node GS on your Rubin to
01:35 - operating system by Ubuntu reporter
01:37 - trees and this is by giving this command
01:41 - sudo apt install node GS just give this
01:47 - command and the version you will install
01:50 - for node.js will be 10 point nineteen
01:53 - point zero as I have shown you so if you
01:58 - are comfortable with the older version
02:00 - of node.js and if you are ok with it
02:03 - then just provide this command and you
02:05 - are going to install the version which
02:08 - is available in ubuntu repositories now
02:11 - if you want to install the DEF
02:13 - and version let's say that you want to
02:15 - install the latest version then let me
02:18 - show you what you can do so just go to
02:21 - your node GS dot o-r-g website and if
02:25 - you want to install this 12 point 17
02:28 - point LTS you have this option and then
02:32 - for the latest version you have this
02:34 - option just click on the other downloads
02:37 - link here and then scroll down and you
02:41 - will be able to see these links here so
02:43 - just click on this link which says
02:46 - installing node.js via package manager
02:49 - and then you will be able to see this
02:52 - option which says Debian and Ubuntu
02:55 - based Linux distributions so just click
02:57 - on this option which is going to
02:58 - redirect you to this place
03:02 - now still you don't need to give any
03:06 - command you can see there is a link
03:08 - available here so I'm going to just
03:10 - click on this link which is node.js
03:13 - binary distribution so when you click on
03:17 - this link it's going to open the github
03:19 - repository so this is going to open this
03:22 - kind of repository which is node source
03:24 - distributions so I'm going to give you
03:27 - this link in the description of this
03:29 - video so if you don't want to go through
03:31 - all the steps you can just click on the
03:33 - link which is provided in the
03:35 - description and you will come to this
03:38 - place which is the github readme page
03:40 - when you scroll down here you will be
03:43 - able to see all these versions so you
03:46 - can see you can install node.js for 20.0
03:53 - for LTS which is the latest version at
03:55 - the time of making this video and when
03:57 - you scroll down more here you will see
04:00 - how you can install different versions
04:03 - of node.js so you can see the node.js 14
04:06 - point X version is there no GS 13 point
04:09 - X version is there and node.js 12 point
04:12 - X version is there so we are going to
04:14 - install the node.js 14 point whatever
04:17 - version is available at the time of
04:19 - making this video which is the newest
04:21 - version so just copy the first command
04:24 - and then
04:25 - open your terminal again and then paste
04:29 - this command which is the curl command
04:31 - so just press Enter
04:32 - so because this is the newer
04:34 - installation of Ubuntu which I'm using
04:36 - so it says command curl not found but
04:39 - can be installed with sudo apt install
04:42 - so first of all just use this command in
04:46 - order to install curl on your Ubuntu
04:49 - operating system so just give sudo apt
04:51 - install curl and then just give your
04:54 - Ubuntu is password and just press Enter
04:58 - which is going to install curl on your
05:00 - open to operating system and once curl
05:02 - is installed i'm going to just clear
05:04 - this terminal and then give that curl
05:08 - command once again which we have copied
05:10 - from this github link so this is this
05:15 - command right so once again I'm going to
05:17 - give this command and now it's going to
05:20 - apt-get update so first it gives this
05:23 - command and then it's going to fetch the
05:28 - node GS libraries so now you can see you
05:32 - can give this command sudo apt-get
05:34 - install why node.js in order to install
05:37 - node.js you can also verify this by
05:39 - going to this github page which is the
05:42 - same command so I'm going to just copy
05:43 - this command and then just paste this
05:46 - command on my terminal and then press
05:49 - ENTER which is going to install the
05:51 - node.js on my open to operating system
05:55 - and once this installation is finished
05:57 - let me clear the terminal and we are
06:00 - going to verify which version of node we
06:03 - have installed so just give this command
06:05 - which is node space - - version and you
06:09 - can see the latest version of node which
06:12 - is available at the time of making this
06:14 - video is version fourteen point three
06:16 - point zero so we have installed this
06:19 - version we can also verify the version
06:22 - of NPM because when you install node GS
06:26 - using this procedure which I'm showing
06:28 - you you will automatically install NPM
06:31 - with node.js so just give NPM version
06:35 - command and you can see version six
06:38 - point four
06:39 - in point 5 is the version we have
06:41 - installed at the time of making this
06:43 - video so this is how you can install the
06:47 - latest version of node.js on your open
06:50 - to operating system now if you are
06:52 - advanced user and you want to switch
06:57 - between different versions of node GS
07:00 - then I'm going to show you one more
07:03 - option so at this point your node GS
07:06 - version is totally working and you can
07:08 - start working with node.js and you can
07:11 - skip the rest of the video if you are
07:13 - not the advanced user but if you are the
07:17 - advanced user and you want to use
07:19 - node.js for a long time and if you want
07:24 - to use different node GS version so if
07:27 - you want to test your code with
07:29 - different node.js versions then I'm
07:32 - going to show you one more option so for
07:34 - that you can search for nvm on your
07:36 - favorite browser there are several
07:39 - different node version managers
07:42 - available I use nvm but there are many
07:47 - different options like this on internet
07:52 - which gives you the similar
07:54 - functionality so for this video I'm
07:58 - using nvm which is node version manager
08:02 - which will allow you to install
08:04 - different version of node anytime on
08:07 - your Rubin to operating system so the
08:10 - first link here is the github link so
08:12 - this is the link we want to use I'm
08:15 - going to give the link in the
08:16 - description also for nvm and when you
08:19 - scroll down on this github link let me
08:23 - just scroll down you can see how to
08:25 - install the nvm it's just one command
08:29 - which is this curl command so let's just
08:32 - copy this command and then go to our
08:36 - terminal
08:37 - let me just clear this terminal once
08:39 - again and then paste this command and
08:42 - then press Enter which is going to just
08:45 - get this installed OTT Sh
08:50 - file on your window operating system and
08:54 - then it's going to install nvm so let's
08:58 - wait for this command to finish it's
09:01 - finished now
09:01 - so after this command is finished you
09:04 - can see a pending nvm source string to
09:07 - the dot bash RC so for all the changes
09:12 - to take effect you need to give the
09:15 - source forward slash dot bash RC in
09:19 - order to just make those changes
09:22 - permanent or refresh the bash RC on the
09:25 - current terminal so you can open the
09:28 - next terminal so just close this
09:31 - terminal and open the next terminal or
09:32 - you can give this come out so just give
09:35 - this command source so tilde forward
09:38 - slash dot bash RC and you will be good
09:40 - to go let's clear the terminal at this
09:42 - point and now let's see how we can use
09:46 - this nvm so to view all the node.js
09:48 - version which is available remotely
09:50 - using nvm you can give this command
09:54 - which is nvm list - remote and then
09:59 - press ENTER and it's going to give you a
10:01 - long list of all the versions which are
10:04 - available remotely for the NPM so you
10:09 - can see all these versions are available
10:11 - by the way we have installed that latest
10:14 - version which is 14 point 3.0 so you can
10:17 - install any version which is available
10:19 - in this list which is literally all the
10:21 - versions right so let's say you want to
10:24 - install the LTS version so latest LTS
10:28 - version of node.js which is 12 point 17
10:32 - point zero we can verify this by going
10:35 - to the node G s website also so let's
10:38 - see which is the latest version at the
10:40 - time of making this video for the LTS
10:43 - you can see twelve point seven 15.0 is
10:46 - the latest version for the LTS which is
10:49 - also given here ok so let's install this
10:54 - version so in order to install this
10:56 - version using nvm just use nvm and then
11:01 - give install command and
11:03 - the version so just copy the version as
11:07 - it is which is shown here with the V and
11:11 - then the version so let me just give
11:14 - this command once again and we am
11:17 - installed and then the version which is
11:19 - V 12 point 17 point zero and then press
11:25 - ENTER which is going to install this
11:29 - version 12 point 7 teen point 0 using
11:31 - and BM and once this command is finished
11:34 - you can see creating default alias for
11:38 - 12 point 17.0 so let me clear the
11:42 - terminal once again and now you can give
11:45 - this command and VM list in order to
11:48 - list out what are the version which are
11:50 - available locally on your open to
11:54 - operating system so we have installed
11:55 - this version and we have the system
11:58 - version which is 14 point 3.0 which we
12:01 - have installed using the node source
12:03 - right so let's see how we can switch
12:05 - between different versions so to switch
12:09 - between different versions what you can
12:12 - do is you can just give this command and
12:14 - BM use and then the version but before
12:18 - that let's check which version is right
12:20 - now available for this terminal so I'm
12:23 - going to just give this command Nord - -
12:26 - version and you can see right now 12
12:31 - point 17.0 is available which we have
12:34 - installed using nvm now in order to
12:37 - switch between versions so let's switch
12:38 - to the system version which is 14 point
12:41 - 3.0 which we have installed from node
12:44 - source you can just give this command
12:46 - and VM use and then the version you want
12:51 - to switch to so let's say we want to
12:53 - switch to the system version so just
12:54 - copy the system and place it here and
12:57 - you can see it's showing now using
13:01 - system version of node which is version
13:03 - 14 point 3.0 and the associated NPM
13:07 - version with that so once again when you
13:09 - give node version you can see now we are
13:13 - using fourteen point three point zero so
13:14 - this is how you can switch between
13:16 - different node
13:17 - so these are the few different ways of
13:20 - installing node.js on your Ubuntu
13:22 - operating system so you can decide which
13:25 - command or which procedure or which
13:27 - option you want to use for the
13:29 - installation of node.js all the options
13:32 - are okay in my opinion if you want to
13:37 - start with the latest version then just
13:39 - use the second option which I have shown
13:41 - you if you just want to test and if you
13:44 - are just a new user you can use just
13:48 - sudo apt install node.js which is also
13:51 - okay it's nothing wrong with that if you
13:54 - are not a advanced user and if you are
13:57 - really an advanced user and if you want
13:59 - to test your code with different
14:00 - versions of node.js then use the NPM so
14:05 - I hope you have enjoyed this video and I
14:07 - will see you in the next video
