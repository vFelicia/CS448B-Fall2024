00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Linux command line tutorial for
00:04 - beginners and in this video we will talk
00:06 - about bash RC file in Linux and how we
00:11 - can use it and what is bash RC file so
00:15 - first of all what is bash RC file the
00:19 - bash RC file is a script that is
00:22 - executed whenever a new terminal session
00:25 - is started in interactive mode right so
00:31 - first of all for example you open your
00:36 - terminal and just check whether you are
00:39 - in your home directory or not by default
00:42 - you are already in home directory
00:44 - whenever you open your terminal right
00:47 - now in here you can just write LS - a
00:52 - for the listing and you will be able to
00:56 - see there is a file called dot bash RC
00:59 - and this is the file which is
01:02 - responsible whenever you open a new
01:05 - terminal this file is executed this is a
01:09 - kind of a script which is executed first
01:12 - whenever you open a new terminal session
01:15 - right so let's go inside this dot bash
01:20 - RC file so you can use Nano to display
01:25 - the content of this bash RC file so just
01:29 - write nano dot bash RC and you can go
01:33 - inside this file and you can see the
01:35 - content of this file like this or I am
01:39 - going to just exit by just pressing
01:42 - control X or you can use the command
01:45 - called G added so just read G add it and
01:49 - then dot bash RC write this is also a
01:54 - kind of GUI editor which is used as an
01:59 - editor for your you know text file or
02:02 - any other file right so just write G
02:05 - edit and dot bash RC and press ENTER and
02:08 - this is going to open this file in this
02:11 - kind of GUI editor right
02:13 - so in some operating system I'm talking
02:18 - about the Linux operating systems this
02:20 - bash RC file is already there and some
02:23 - strips are already there inside this
02:26 - batch RC file so for example I'm using
02:28 - this open to operating system and it
02:31 - already have a bash RC file and it
02:34 - already have this kind of script inside
02:37 - this bash RC file right now in some
02:41 - other kind of call in X operating system
02:43 - a few days ago I was using for example
02:46 - Linux Mint it doesn't have this bash RC
02:49 - file right so anyway if it exists it's
02:54 - ok and if it doesn't exist you can just
02:57 - create one for you using this Kadlec G
03:00 - added command or not no command it
03:03 - doesn't matter right so now what we were
03:07 - talking is that this script is executed
03:10 - whenever you open a new terminal right
03:13 - so whatever you add to the script it
03:18 - will be executed first whenever you open
03:20 - a new terminal session right so just go
03:23 - at the end of this file and if you
03:25 - create a new bed dot bash RC file it's
03:28 - ok just go at the end or if you have a
03:32 - new just right there just right for
03:35 - example echo and then in double quotes
03:39 - this is a test right so just write this
03:46 - command here you already know what is
03:49 - echo command right and then just close
03:51 - this pressure on C file ok and now we
03:55 - are going to open a new terminal session
03:58 - and this terminal session I can open
04:00 - from here just go to file and then you
04:04 - can just say open tab or you can just
04:08 - press control shift T to open the new
04:12 - tab you can see the new tab is open so
04:15 - this is first tab we were in and this is
04:17 - a new tab we have created and as soon as
04:20 - we have created this new tab this text
04:23 - we have written in the bash RC file is
04:27 - executed right so this is a test and
04:30 - this was we have a written echo command
04:33 - for this right so using this we know
04:37 - that this bash RC file is called first
04:40 - because it's executing our echo command
04:43 - also and then your you know your normal
04:48 - terminal operation you can do right once
04:51 - again we can add it the bash RC content
04:54 - so I'm going to just go to the gadget
04:58 - command so get G added dot bash RC and
05:01 - this time instead of echoing something I
05:04 - can use some aliases for example right
05:09 - so for example what I can do here is
05:13 - instead of echoing I can do a layer so
05:18 - just write LS LS is equal to for example
05:24 - we want to do the long listing and the
05:28 - color also so LS minus minus gala is
05:34 - equal to auto and then we will say -
05:39 - he'll also we want to do that long
05:42 - listing also right and I will save the
05:45 - content then I will close this and once
05:47 - again I can just close this tab and open
05:51 - the new tab this time I will go here and
05:54 - then click open tab and now whenever I
05:59 - do LS and press Enter is going to do the
06:04 - long listing with the color options for
06:06 - me right so in this way you can
06:10 - customize your bash RC file mostly we
06:14 - use this bash RC file for a number of
06:16 - things for example if you want to set up
06:19 - the environment variables whenever for
06:22 - example you install Java you need to set
06:26 - up the Java home environment variable
06:28 - and this can be done using this bash RC
06:31 - file right or whenever you want to use
06:34 - git and you want to see which you know
06:39 - repository you have
06:40 - checked in or you have flown you can
06:43 - write the script for this and then you
06:46 - will be able to see in the terminal
06:49 - itself which you know version or which
06:53 - you know get script get repository you
06:57 - have right so for this batch RC file is
07:01 - really useful so I hope you understood
07:04 - the basic concept of dot bash RC file I
07:07 - hope you enjoyed this video please rate
