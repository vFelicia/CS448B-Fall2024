00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can get started with Python
00:04 - on your visual studio code editor using
00:08 - your Windows 10 operating system so
00:11 - let's get started so to start with you
00:14 - need to have Python installed on your
00:17 - Windows 10 operating system and also I'm
00:20 - hoping and expecting that you already
00:23 - have installed Visual Studio code on
00:26 - your Windows 10 operating system now to
00:28 - check where the Python is installed I am
00:30 - going to right click on my windows icon
00:33 - here and open the command prompt and
00:35 - here I'm going to just type Python and
00:38 - then space - - version and then press
00:42 - Enter and you can see I have Python
00:45 - three point seven point four installed
00:48 - on my Windows operating system so make
00:50 - sure that python is installed and also
00:53 - visual studio code is installed so you
00:56 - can see visual studio code is already
00:58 - installed so now the only thing remains
01:01 - is I need to open the Visual Studio code
01:06 - and create my project so to start with
01:10 - because this is a Python development
01:14 - kind of tutorial I'm going to open the
01:18 - command prompt and I want to show you
01:20 - some more things so you can go to your
01:24 - chosen directory let's say I want to
01:27 - just create a project inside my desktop
01:31 - directory so I'm going to just type
01:33 - desktop CD desktop and then I'm going to
01:36 - create a directory using mkdir command
01:40 - and then the name of your directory
01:44 - which you want to create so let's say I
01:47 - want to create a directory called books
01:50 - so I'm going to just give this command
01:52 - mkdir work which is going to create this
01:55 - directory in your desktop right so you
02:00 - can CD to your work directory so now you
02:04 - are inside your work directly in the
02:06 - terminal so you can directly open visual
02:09 - studio code inside this directory using
02:13 - this command code space dot so just keep
02:15 - this comma and then press Enter which is
02:18 - going to open visual studio code on the
02:22 - same directory you can see so now the
02:24 - work of this terminal is done so I'm
02:28 - going to just close this terminal so now
02:30 - we want to create some Python script and
02:34 - we want to run this python script using
02:36 - visual studio code and also we want to
02:39 - debug our python script using visual
02:42 - studio code so let's create a python
02:46 - file first of all so i'm going to just
02:48 - create a test dot py file and then press
02:51 - enter which is going to create this file
02:53 - and as soon as you create this file
02:56 - inside Visual Studio code straightaway
02:59 - this message will pop up which says the
03:04 - python extension is recommended for this
03:07 - file type so if you want to install it
03:10 - you can just click on the install button
03:13 - if you don't want to install it straight
03:16 - away from this message you can also go
03:19 - to this last option which is called the
03:23 - extensions and just click on this here
03:27 - also you can search for Python inside
03:30 - the search for box or you will see in
03:33 - the recommendation this Python plug-in
03:35 - also so for example I just type here
03:39 - Python and the first result here will be
03:43 - the Python plug-in extension you can
03:45 - also read more about this extension by
03:48 - clicking on this extension right so this
03:51 - is the same extension which is
03:53 - recommended by visual studio code to us
03:57 - which is this pop-up right so if you
04:01 - just click on the install button it's
04:03 - going to install the Python extension
04:06 - and you can see how many number of time
04:08 - it is downloaded it is downloaded about
04:12 - 62 million times so it's the most
04:15 - popular or one of the most popular
04:18 - extensions which is provided by
04:20 - Microsoft that's also important right so
04:23 - I'm going to just click on install
04:25 - button
04:26 - which is going to install this Python
04:28 - extension you can see some more
04:30 - extensions also here for example Python
04:33 - for visual studio code which is also
04:37 - relatively popular you can see 1 million
04:40 - downloads of this extension and you can
04:44 - see many more extensions when you just
04:47 - type here Python so for example Python
04:50 - preview or Python path so now you can
04:53 - see that this python extension is added
04:57 - to our Visual Studio code and at any
05:00 - time you can also uninstall this
05:03 - extension by clicking on the uninstall
05:05 - button so once this extension is
05:09 - installed just go to your Explorer once
05:12 - again I'm going to just close this page
05:16 - from here and now you can also see some
05:18 - tips and recommendations from your
05:21 - visual studio code editor which is to
05:25 - install pee violent extension so this
05:28 - time I'm going to just directly click on
05:30 - this install button which is going to
05:33 - install this pee violent extension on
05:36 - our Visual Studio code so you can see
05:39 - it's installing this package and you
05:42 - will also observe that this package is
05:44 - just a pip package and you can see this
05:48 - command is already given on your
05:51 - terminal which is PIP install a pee
05:54 - violent for this user so if you want to
05:58 - install pee violent manually you can
06:00 - also give this command using pip so you
06:03 - can just write pip install pee by length
06:05 - and this procedure is same as what
06:10 - Visual Studio code is doing for us right
06:13 - I'm going to just close this
06:15 - recommendation because we have already
06:17 - installed the python extension for the
06:22 - Visual Studio code and now you can see
06:24 - that the py length the extension is also
06:26 - installed so you can see this terminal
06:29 - is also available inside your Visual
06:31 - Studio code from where you can run your
06:34 - script directly so I'm going to just
06:36 - close this terminal for now and
06:39 - I'm going to show you how you can open
06:40 - it once again you can go to the view and
06:43 - then from here you can just click on the
06:46 - terminal which is going to open the
06:48 - terminal if you want to open multiple
06:50 - terminal you can just click on this plus
06:52 - button and you can see there are
06:55 - multiple terminals open which you can
06:57 - switch using this menu bar from here
07:01 - right so let's just create some code so
07:06 - I'm going to just define for example msg
07:10 - for a message is equal to hello world
07:13 - let's say we want to print hello world
07:16 - on the terminal and then inside this
07:19 - print function I'm going to just pass my
07:22 - MSG variable so once you have done
07:24 - writing your code you can right click on
07:26 - the same file and then you will see this
07:29 - option which says run Python in terminal
07:32 - which is going to run your python script
07:34 - inside your terminal so I'm going to
07:36 - just click on this option and you can
07:39 - see it runs this Python script using
07:42 - Python on your terminal and it prints
07:46 - hello world here so you can see this
07:49 - output hello world also if you want to
07:51 - increase the font size you can just go
07:54 - to file and then go to the Preferences
07:57 - here and then click on settings which is
08:00 - going to open this window and then you
08:03 - can go to the text editor here and then
08:06 - go to the font and I'm going to increase
08:09 - this font size to let's say 18 and then
08:12 - press ENTER which is going to increase
08:14 - this font size to 18 you can see the
08:17 - font size is now increased you can also
08:20 - do it let's say 20 which is going to
08:23 - make this font little bit more bigger so
08:27 - let me just close this window once again
08:29 - and let's concentrate on our Python
08:32 - script now let's try to do it manually
08:35 - we have just ran our script using just
08:38 - right clicking on the file and then
08:40 - choosing this option but you can run
08:42 - your python script using the command
08:45 - line simply so you can just write python
08:47 - and the name of your script which is a
08:49 - test in our case and because it's
08:54 - PS terminal which is a PowerShell
08:56 - terminal that's why it's adding this dot
08:59 - and this backslash here otherwise we
09:03 - could have just used test dot py also on
09:07 - your Linux operating system and it will
09:10 - run fine also so you can see the same
09:12 - result here also you can see on the left
09:15 - hand corner this Python version which is
09:19 - available for your visual studio code so
09:22 - you can see python 3.7 point for 64-bit
09:26 - version is used by Visual Studio code on
09:29 - our Windows 10 operating system so now
09:33 - let's try to debug our code so to debug
09:35 - our code we just need to give the
09:39 - breakpoint breakpoint you can give from
09:42 - here so just click on the Left bar here
09:46 - and then you can see the red dot that
09:49 - means we have set the breakpoint and
09:52 - then you can just go to the debug
09:54 - options and right now there is no
09:57 - configuration here so when you click on
09:59 - this spanner option you can see this
10:02 - round I can here you will be able to see
10:06 - the first option here it says python
10:09 - file so you can just click on this
10:12 - python file which is going to create
10:14 - this launch dot jason file inside your
10:19 - project so now you can see there is a
10:21 - folder which is created which is called
10:23 - dot vs code and inside this dot vs code
10:27 - your launch dot JSON file is there but
10:30 - let's not just concentrate on this
10:32 - launch dot JSON file yet we want to
10:35 - debug our code so we just want to click
10:38 - on the debug option and once you have
10:41 - clicked on the python file options you
10:43 - will be able to see python here or when
10:46 - you drop this menu you will be able to
10:49 - see python here once you have clicked
10:51 - this open launch date JSON file and then
10:55 - you can see this green button here so
10:59 - I'm going to just click on this green
11:00 - button which is going to start the
11:02 - debugging of the python script so
11:06 - debugger has
11:07 - been started and in some time you can
11:09 - see that our debugger is stopped at this
11:15 - breakpoint which we have set for our
11:17 - print function and on the left hand side
11:21 - you can see the local variables here so
11:24 - there is only one local variable which
11:26 - we have defined which was this message
11:30 - variable and also there are so many
11:32 - built-ins which are available inside
11:35 - your standard Python so those are also
11:38 - shown here if you want to watch any
11:41 - variable you can also write the name of
11:44 - that expression for example MSG and then
11:47 - I'm going to just press ENTER and it's
11:49 - going to give you the value of that
11:53 - expression so I have just added this
11:55 - expression and it shows me hello world
11:58 - also there is a call stake here and you
12:02 - can see the breakpoints here you can
12:05 - also see these button first button here
12:07 - is for the continue second is for step
12:11 - over third is for step into and the
12:15 - fourth button is for step out and this
12:19 - button is to restart your debugging and
12:22 - the last button is for stop your
12:24 - debugging so let's say I'm going to just
12:27 - click on continue button which is going
12:29 - to just continue the script after the
12:32 - breakpoint and it's going to show us
12:34 - this output once again when you run your
12:37 - debugger your debugger is going to stop
12:40 - at this breakpoint which you have set so
12:43 - this is how you can debug your code you
12:45 - can also restart your debugging by just
12:48 - pressing the restart button and it's
12:51 - going to restart your debugging so let's
12:54 - stop our debugging for now and let's go
12:56 - to our script once again now let's see
12:58 - how the intelligence work in your visual
13:03 - studio code for python so we have
13:05 - declared this variable called MSG when
13:08 - you write for example dot here you will
13:11 - be able to see bunch of functions which
13:14 - you can apply on your a string variable
13:17 - for example capitalized or all
13:20 - these functions which are available here
13:23 - so let's say we want to apply this lower
13:27 - function and when you try to complete
13:29 - this function using this parenthesis
13:32 - it's also going to show you what this
13:35 - function is going to do so it's going to
13:37 - return the copy of the string converted
13:40 - to the lowercase right so this is how
13:43 - you can use the intellisense if the
13:47 - intellisense is not working you just
13:48 - need to relaunch your Visual Studio
13:51 - codes because sometimes you need to
13:55 - restart your Visual Studio code on your
13:57 - Windows operating system after
13:59 - installing the extensions so we have
14:02 - installed the python extension and if
14:06 - you don't restart it sometime it's not
14:08 - going to work so try to restart your
14:11 - Visual Studio code and then try to use
14:14 - this intelligence and it's going to work
14:18 - most probably so this is how you can get
14:20 - started with python on your Visual
14:23 - Studio code editor inside your Windows
14:26 - 10 operating system I hope you have
14:28 - enjoyed this video and I will see you in
14:30 - the next video
