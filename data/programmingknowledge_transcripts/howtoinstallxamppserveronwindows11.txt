03:24 - this check box as checked and then click
03:26 - on finish which is going to start the
03:28 - xampp server on my windows 11 operating
03:31 - system
03:32 - so you can see the xampp server
03:35 - control panel window has been started
03:38 - you can also open the xampp server from
03:42 - the list of all these apps on your
03:45 - windows 11 operating system so when you
03:47 - will scroll down here
03:49 - you will be able to see the zam server
03:52 - here under zamp folder okay so you can
03:56 - see this is the control panel which is
03:58 - opened right now so you can always uh go
04:01 - to your
04:03 - windows start menu and then
04:06 - open this sam server from here
04:08 - once the sam server is started you will
04:10 - see this kind of window also you will be
04:13 - able to see uh this icon which is
04:15 - created here which is for xampp server
04:17 - so it also indicates
04:19 - that xampp server is running so on this
04:22 - xampp control panel window you will be
04:25 - able to see all these modules the apache
04:28 - module mysql filezilla mercury and
04:31 - tomcat and you will be able to see some
04:33 - button in front of all these modules
04:37 - so
04:38 - the first section is for the start
04:40 - button or the stop buttons
04:42 - and then the next section is for the
04:45 - config button so you can configure all
04:48 - these modules using this config module
04:51 - and you can also see the individual logs
04:54 - of all these modules so if they have any
04:58 - errors you will be able to see in the
05:00 - logs right
05:01 - so let's start the apache server first
05:04 - of all so
05:05 - in front of apache i'm going to click on
05:07 - the start button which is going to start
05:10 - the apache server right
05:12 - once the apache server starts you will
05:14 - be able to see that
05:17 - here you will be able to see the green
05:20 - color around this apache that means
05:23 - everything is running successfully
05:25 - once the apache server is running you
05:27 - will be able to see the stop button for
05:30 - stopping
05:31 - the purchase server
05:33 - you will also see the pids so using
05:36 - these pids you know on which pids this
05:40 - apache server is running so if you want
05:43 - to force kill the purchase server you
05:45 - can use these pids right
05:48 - you can also see the config and logs
05:50 - which i'm going to cover little bit
05:53 - later you will also see these ports so
05:56 - these are the default ports on which the
05:59 - purchase server starts
06:01 - so if by chance these ports are not free
06:05 - on your windows 11 operating system then
06:08 - your apache server is going to show the
06:10 - error and i'm also going to show you how
06:12 - you can solve that error but first of
06:14 - all
06:16 - our apache server is running on port 80
06:18 - so we can go to our browser
06:21 - and then here i can just write
06:24 - local host and then press enter
06:28 - and if you see this kind of window that
06:30 - means apache server is running
06:32 - successfully on your windows 11
06:35 - operating system and it's working fine
06:38 - right so you can see i have opened the
06:41 - local host on which apache server is
06:44 - running and it has
06:45 - opened the dashboard on the apache
06:48 - server so everything is working fine for
06:51 - the apache server also in this
06:54 - web page you will be able to see this
06:56 - php my admin so when you click on the
06:58 - php my admin it should open the php my
07:02 - admin window
07:04 - but for now it's not going to show you
07:07 - the
07:08 - php my admin window and it's going to
07:10 - show you this error
07:12 - why it's showing this error because we
07:14 - haven't started our mysql server here
07:17 - right
07:18 - so you can see mysql is not started so
07:21 - we have to start
07:22 - mysql in order to
07:24 - see the phpmyadmin interface so let me
07:28 - just click on the start button here
07:31 - and then i'm going to click on allow
07:32 - access here and now you can see my mysql
07:36 - server is also running on port
07:39 - 3306
07:40 - and i can stop this mysql server at any
07:44 - time now my mysql server is running so
07:47 - i'm going to refresh this webpage once
07:49 - again for phpmyadmin
07:52 - and you will see that this php my admin
07:55 - window
07:56 - and it's going to show you this kind of
07:58 - interface that means uh your php myadmin
08:03 - is also working from here you can create
08:05 - databases
08:07 - you can run sql queries and do many
08:10 - things related to your database right
08:15 - so
08:15 - that's running
08:17 - now remember i have told you that if
08:20 - this port 80 is already occupied on
08:24 - your windows operating system by some
08:26 - other service this apache server is
08:28 - going to show you some errors so first
08:31 - of all how you can check which ports are
08:34 - already occupied on your windows 11
08:37 - operating system
08:38 - so xampp control panel comes with this
08:41 - netstat tool so when you click on this
08:44 - netstat button
08:46 - it's going to show you the list of all
08:48 - the ports which are occupied on your
08:52 - windows 11 operating system so you can
08:54 - see port 80 is occupied right now by my
08:58 - apache server
08:59 - but let's say if it's occupied by some
09:01 - other service
09:03 - it's also going to show you the name of
09:05 - that service right
09:07 - similarly you can see mysql is running
09:11 - on port 3306
09:14 - and you can see all the other ports
09:16 - which
09:17 - are occupied on your windows 11
09:19 - operating system
09:21 - with all these services right so let's
09:24 - say this port 80 is already occupied so
09:27 - i want to change this port of apache
09:30 - server
09:31 - so for changing this port you just need
09:34 - to stop your apache server first of all
09:37 - and then click on config here so for the
09:40 - configuration you can choose the first
09:42 - option which is
09:43 - httpd.conf file so i'm going to click on
09:46 - the first option
09:48 - which is going to open this kind of file
09:50 - so on this http.conf file
09:53 - just scroll down a little
09:55 - until you see this listen keyword right
10:00 - so you can see the default port right
10:02 - now is 80
10:04 - i can change this port to something else
10:06 - so let's say i want to change this port
10:09 - to port 8080 8080 right i can also
10:14 - change this but it will not
10:17 - change anything because you can see this
10:20 - line is commented
10:21 - right so you need to change this port in
10:25 - order to change the port of your apache
10:27 - server and then just save this file by
10:30 - pressing ctrl s and then you can close
10:33 - this file
10:34 - once that's done you can once again
10:36 - start your apache server so click on the
10:39 - start button
10:40 - and this time you will see that now the
10:43 - port of apache is changed to port 8080
10:48 - in my case right so this is how you can
10:51 - change the port
10:53 - now once again when you go to your
10:56 - browser and
10:57 - type localhost here this time it's not
11:01 - going to open
11:03 - because
11:04 - now our server is running on the
11:06 - different port right so if the port is
11:09 - 80 on your windows operating system you
11:13 - don't need to provide any port
11:15 - information on the browser but if you
11:18 - change the port from port 80 to some
11:21 - other port in our case we have changed
11:23 - it to port 8080 i need to add this colon
11:28 - and then
11:29 - add the port number in my case it's port
11:33 - 8080 and then press enter
11:36 - and then only it's going to open right
11:39 - so you need to write the port number
11:42 - after the local host in order to open
11:45 - this
11:46 - web page if you changed the port here so
11:50 - the port should be similar which is
11:52 - visible here on this browser after local
11:56 - host
11:57 - similarly
11:58 - this php my admin is also not going to
12:01 - work right why it's not going to work
12:04 - because you guessed it right you need to
12:07 - add colon
12:08 - 8080 after the local host and then press
12:12 - enter and then it's going to work
12:14 - normally right
12:16 - so
12:18 - if you change the port here you need to
12:20 - change the url also here so this is how
12:23 - you can download and install and use
12:26 - xampp server on your windows 11
12:28 - operating system
12:30 - i hope you've enjoyed this video and i
12:32 - will see you in the next video
