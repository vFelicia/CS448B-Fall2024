00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - shell scripting tutorial for beginners
00:04 - in the last video we have seen how to
00:06 - use and logical operator with scripting
00:10 - now in this video we will learn how to
00:12 - use or a logical operator encrypting so
00:16 - let's get started so if you understood
00:19 - the last concept of n the logical
00:22 - operator it's really easy to understand
00:25 - our logical operator so we will take the
00:28 - example which we have taken in the last
00:30 - video and we will you know have the
00:34 - students age or anybody's age here in
00:37 - the age variable and then we will just
00:40 - evaluate that age if the age is greater
00:44 - than 18 and in the last video we have
00:47 - seen and with the end operator we have
00:50 - added one more condition that if the age
00:53 - is less than 30 then we will say it's a
00:56 - valid age or it's not a valid age now
01:00 - this time for example we want that if
01:03 - the age is greater than 18 or age is
01:09 - less than 30 then we will say that ages
01:11 - are valid so instead of using the and
01:15 - operator like this we can just use
01:18 - double pipe to you know use the or
01:22 - operators right so we will just take
01:25 - these square bracket and in the first
01:27 - square bracket you can give the first
01:30 - expression and then these two pipe for
01:34 - or operator and then use the second
01:38 - expression which you want to evaluate
01:40 - now this or if you already know is for
01:45 - logical or so if any of the condition
01:49 - separated by these pipe is true then
01:53 - it's going to give this valid age
01:56 - otherwise it's going to give the other
02:00 - condition which is an else statement if
02:03 - both conditions are false then the code
02:07 - will go to this condition or as
02:11 - statement okay
02:13 - so let's run the script and let's see
02:17 - what happens so our age which we have
02:20 - given is 60 so in this case the age is
02:26 - greater than 18 because 60 is greater
02:28 - than 18 but it's not less than 30 so
02:33 - only one condition is fulfilled and then
02:36 - we will just run our script and we will
02:39 - see what happens and it says something
02:43 - is missing yeah I forgot this space here
02:45 - and once again I'm going to run this
02:47 - script at face valid age because one
02:51 - condition is fulfilled and other is not
02:54 - right now for example we will just give
02:58 - some current some age in which both
03:02 - conditions are fulfilled you will still
03:04 - get the same answer or result they say
03:08 - it's valid age right now for evaluating
03:14 - the false current condition or to you
03:17 - know come into the as condition for
03:20 - example I gave the age 25 here and
03:23 - instead of for greater then I will use
03:26 - equal to here and equal to here okay and
03:30 - then of course the age is not equal to
03:34 - 18 and of course age is not equal to 30
03:37 - because it's 25 and let's run the script
03:40 - once again and it will say the age is
03:44 - not valid and it also gives me the
03:47 - warning that this square bracket has
03:51 - some problem in it so we will solve it
03:53 - by giving the space here once again and
03:55 - then once again we will run the script
03:57 - and it saves age is not valid right so
04:01 - this is how you can use or operators and
04:04 - of course as an operator the or operator
04:08 - also have some options so if you want to
04:12 - use the of or operator with one bracket
04:16 - and not two bracket you can just use -
04:21 - Oh for or operator and the result will
04:24 - be same so let's run the script and the
04:26 - is the same so you can use double
04:30 - brackets and those two pipes for the or
04:34 - operator or you can use this flag - Oh
04:37 - for the Opera auto operator with single
04:40 - square bracket and the last way you can
04:45 - use this is using the double square
04:48 - brackets and in here you just need to
04:51 - give double pipes once again as you have
04:54 - seen in the end operators also and the
04:57 - condition still will be the same okay so
05:00 - as the end logical operator you can use
05:04 - the or logical operators also in three
05:07 - ways
05:08 - one is with two brackets and these pipes
05:11 - and other is with the flag and single
05:15 - brackets so - oh flag and this single
05:19 - square bracket or otherwise you just
05:22 - need to use double brackets with the or
05:26 - operator pipe so you just need to write
05:29 - something like this and between the two
05:34 - square brackets you can give the pipe or
05:37 - for all operator okay so I hope you
