00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - HTML tutorial for beginners using html5
00:05 - in this video we will learn about the
00:08 - new element which was introduced in
00:11 - html5 which are section header footer
00:16 - and nav so these are the four new
00:21 - element along with the other elements
00:24 - which are introduced in html5 and let's
00:28 - see how we can use them so in the last
00:31 - video we have seen how we can create
00:33 - this kind of HTML layout page with
00:39 - header navigation bar and the section
00:43 - and the footer and for creating this
00:47 - layout we have used this div element
00:51 - along with some ID and the styles like
00:55 - for header we have given some style for
01:00 - navigation also we have given some style
01:03 - here and we have segregated or divided
01:07 - our code in for section of word
01:10 - divisions which was header navigation
01:14 - section and foot right now in html5
01:19 - these four elements are introduced which
01:21 - are called header nav section and footer
01:25 - which we can use instead of this div
01:27 - element so your code can be more clear
01:30 - so for example in the last video I have
01:33 - defined this develoment and I have
01:35 - defined this ID header right now instead
01:38 - of using this div element you can use a
01:42 - header element like this and it will
01:47 - still be same right and for navigation
01:51 - instead of using navigation we will add
01:56 - a element called nav and in here instead
02:00 - of this develoment and ID call section
02:04 - we can add element called a section and
02:07 - end it with section and for the last we
02:13 - have defined of
02:14 - footer develoment so instead of using
02:17 - this develoment we can use a element
02:20 - called photo and and your footer in here
02:25 - so instead of using these develoment
02:28 - with the ids you can use these new
02:32 - elements which was introduced in HTML
02:34 - file which are called header nav section
02:38 - and footer ok and for the styling of
02:43 - these elements what you can do here is
02:47 - instead of using hash header you can
02:51 - directly use the name of your element
02:53 - which is header and the second element
02:56 - was the nav which is this element and
03:00 - then third element was the section
03:04 - element and the fourth element was the
03:07 - footer right like this so you can use
03:11 - these four element and these styles with
03:16 - them which we have seen in the last
03:18 - video I'm not going to change these
03:20 - styles just change the element name
03:24 - instead of the ID of the element right
03:27 - save your code and refresh it again
03:30 - and it will be same and what these
03:34 - elements are doing here they are helping
03:36 - us to define our style in an easy way
03:41 - for header footer and nav and section
03:45 - right instead of defining long div and
03:49 - ID you can directly use them and then
03:53 - your code readability also is better
03:56 - when you use these elements okay so in
04:01 - this way you can use these four elements
04:04 - in html5 I hope you enjoyed this video
