00:00 - hello guys so in the previous video we
00:02 - have created the high school system for
00:04 - our game
00:05 - and in this video we are going to export
00:07 - our game to the
00:09 - android platform
00:11 - first of all we have to change some
00:13 - settings so click on the file and
00:17 - go into the build settings
00:20 - after that click on the player settings
00:23 - and in here
00:25 - we can change the company name
00:28 - currently it is default company you can
00:30 - also change it to whatever you want
00:33 - you can also change the name of the game
00:37 - and
00:39 - we can also change the
00:40 - version
00:41 - so every time you update the game
00:44 - you may want to increase this
00:47 - and
00:49 - let's uh select the icon for our game
00:54 - and i will select this
00:56 - [Music]
00:57 - knob icon
00:59 - which is a default one
01:02 - so you can also make your own custom
01:05 - icon
01:06 - obviously you will
01:07 - make your own icon for your game you can
01:10 - set it there
01:11 - now in the resolution and presentation
01:14 - uh
01:16 - make the default orientation as portrait
01:20 - so our game will be played in the
01:22 - portrait mode only
01:24 - and we are not going to publish this
01:26 - game so
01:28 - these settings are
01:30 - currently okay
01:32 - after that make sure you have installed
01:34 - the
01:35 - android build support while installing
01:37 - the unity
01:39 - and
01:40 - click on the build
01:42 - and you can save this
01:43 - apk wherever you want currently we are
01:46 - saving it into the desktop and in the
01:48 - new folder
01:50 - so save it
01:52 - and it will take some time
01:55 - to build the project
01:58 - make sure you have an active internet
02:00 - connection
02:02 - because it will require the internet
02:05 - connection to build our project
02:09 - so
02:10 - it may take some more time for you so
02:14 - please wait while it is building
02:17 - for now the this
02:19 - series this beginner series is completed
02:23 - we may add some extra things in the
02:25 - future like double jump functionality
02:28 - and
02:29 - simple store system etc
02:31 - but for now it is
02:35 - completed as a beginner series
02:40 - now let's wait for the gradle
02:43 - build to complete
02:47 - and after that you can see that our
02:51 - app is in the new folder and you can
02:53 - install this app
02:55 - into your android device
02:57 - and
02:58 - you can play it on your own device
03:02 - okay so that was it for this video
