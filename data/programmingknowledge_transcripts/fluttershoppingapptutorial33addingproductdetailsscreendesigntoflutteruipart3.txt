00:00 - until the previous
00:02 - video
00:03 - we were working on the product details
00:07 - screen
00:08 - okay and over there we were trying to
00:09 - display the product image but since the
00:12 - image was compressed
00:14 - so the image was getting pixelated when
00:17 - we were trying to display it in a
00:20 - product details screen where the size of
00:24 - image was comparatively larger than what
00:26 - we had in pro pro product screen
00:29 - okay so what i did was i did add an
00:32 - image okay and i'll show you how i did
00:36 - it
00:36 - so first
00:38 - let's go to server handler where i'm
00:40 - getting all the
00:42 - products okay so over here what i am
00:45 - gonna do is i am gonna print it once
00:48 - so that
00:49 - you can see how i am getting the
00:51 - response over here
00:52 - so print
00:55 - response dot
00:57 - body
00:59 - let me format it then we can do a full
01:03 - restart to see
01:06 - okay
01:09 - so
01:11 - it is loading the sellers let's go to
01:13 - albert einstein
01:15 - okay so over here you can see that i am
01:19 - getting an image and after that i am
01:21 - getting an uncompressed image
01:24 - okay and that is inside another folder
01:27 - products uncompressed images and the
01:29 - same product name okay so now i have
01:33 - done it on the server and was not able
01:36 - to record it but i will give you a gist
01:38 - of how to do it if you want to do so
01:41 - so this is the api okay this is
01:45 - the last point till where we have
01:46 - written so all you need to do is simply
01:48 - go inside models inside product
01:52 - okay add
01:53 - another variable over here and when you
01:56 - create an add product with this image
01:58 - there will be another uncompressed image
02:00 - similarly in the sql also after image
02:03 - there will be uncompressed image
02:05 - okay and over here since it is select
02:07 - star we don't need to worry about it
02:09 - along with this
02:12 - uh in the apis
02:14 - okay inside gen because general and the
02:18 - products
02:19 - okay uh
02:21 - no over not over here actually i'm sorry
02:23 - inside api inside seller
02:27 - and when we go to add
02:30 - along with this image we will also take
02:33 - another image that is the uncompressed
02:35 - image which will comparatively be larger
02:37 - in size and thus larger in dimension and
02:40 - thus pixelation will not happen
02:44 - okay and along with this you also need
02:45 - to alter the database and add a key
02:47 - value pair for the
02:49 - side image okay so the process is pretty
02:51 - simple we have done for some other
02:54 - properties
02:55 - earlier you can look in those videos if
02:57 - you are still not clear okay
03:00 - so let's get back to our code editor now
03:04 - over here we are getting an uncompressed
03:06 - image let's uh add that key value pair
03:09 - in our product model
03:12 - so i'll add another string over here
03:15 - okay and i'll call it
03:17 - uncompressed
03:19 - image
03:21 - okay and over here below image
03:24 - i'll add that uncompressed image
03:27 - okay and get it from the same json with
03:31 - the key name
03:32 - uncompressed image with a underscore
03:37 - so now that we have our image let me
03:39 - save this
03:40 - now that we have our image in the
03:43 - product details screen instead of
03:46 - product image i'm gonna use
03:49 - uncompressed image
03:53 - okay instead of typing so much
03:59 - yeah
04:01 - so we have our uncompressed image let me
04:04 - format it save it
04:06 - and i don't think we need this print
04:08 - anymore
04:10 - and anyways it is giving us a warning
04:13 - okay so that is that and with that i
04:16 - remember that in main yes i might have
04:19 - forgot to add the
04:21 - const so let's fix that
04:25 - once that is done let's do a full
04:27 - restart we don't need main and those
04:30 - things
04:33 - okay
04:36 - so
04:38 - let's go in albert einstein the seller
04:40 - now as we were seeing the broccoli last
04:45 - time let's see if there is any change
04:48 - and you can see that the image is like
04:51 - far more better than what it was earlier
04:54 - okay so
04:56 - this is one thing done
04:58 - okay
04:59 - so now let's move continue with the rest
05:03 - of the design so before that i noticed
05:05 - one thing over here and that is that it
05:08 - has curvy edges
05:10 - okay so let's try to achieve this
05:14 - okay let's go back over here
05:19 - now we have this app bar we don't want
05:22 - to touch that we have this column
05:26 - okay now let's surround it with our
05:28 - container again we'll refracter it
05:31 - wrap it with a container
05:32 - okay now in this container
05:35 - let's give it a color okay or maybe
05:38 - inside the decoration we take a box
05:41 - decoration
05:43 - okay
05:44 - and over here we give it a color just as
05:46 - to check if the thing is happening
05:48 - properly or not so color
05:52 - colors dot
05:54 - amber
05:56 - is fine
05:57 - okay and then after that
05:59 - okay first let's say wait and see
06:02 - so we have the color now let's give it a
06:05 - border radius
06:07 - uh border
06:08 - radius
06:10 - and there is something only yeah over
06:12 - here only
06:14 - okay
06:14 - now over here we need to give it in top
06:17 - left
06:18 - okay now it takes a radius okay so it
06:21 - takes a radius
06:23 - now i'm not sure how the radius is but
06:26 - we just can't try so radius dot
06:31 - circular yeah okay so this is how we can
06:33 - do it radius dot
06:35 - circular so what i am trying to tell
06:38 - over here is that it is not necessary
06:40 - for you to know everything all you need
06:42 - to do is have some common sense and do
06:45 - hit and try until you stumble to the
06:48 - best option there okay
06:51 - now let me format it save it
06:55 - and we have a very slight border radius
06:58 - let me change that i'm gonna make it 50
07:01 - okay so over here is a significant
07:03 - border radius
07:04 - now i want the
07:07 - same for
07:09 - i guess top right yeah
07:11 - so top right
07:13 - again it is gonna be radius and dot
07:16 - circular
07:18 - and
07:19 - 50 is actually too much i'm gonna make
07:21 - it 40
07:23 - okay
07:26 - let's see
07:27 - so 40 seems fine
07:29 - this is also going to be 40
07:33 - yes so now
07:35 - we have this black white space over here
07:39 - we don't want that we want the same
07:41 - color as we have over here so
07:44 - we can't actually add a background color
07:46 - to it but we can do other stuff we can
07:49 - wrap it inside another container and
07:51 - give that a color okay so that is
07:53 - exactly what i'm going to try right now
07:55 - before that i'll let me just fix this
07:57 - warning
07:58 - and it is again for
08:00 - const
08:03 - okay so
08:04 - let me wrap it inside our container
08:08 - now since it is a container the
08:10 - refractoring tool will not show a
08:11 - container so i'm gonna take widget and
08:14 - then
08:15 - call it container
08:17 - okay the container will have a color the
08:20 - color that is this color
08:23 - okay
08:26 - so
08:28 - here we go
08:30 - let me format it save it and we have the
08:33 - color over here we don't need this amber
08:36 - anymore
08:39 - okay sorry we need to make it white
08:41 - actually
08:46 - yeah but now if you see we have a line
08:50 - over here and that is nothing but the
08:52 - elevation of abba so all we need to do
08:55 - is go inside app bar
08:58 - and make the elevation as 0
09:01 - or 0.0 since it is a
09:04 - double
09:06 - yeah so we can see that it all
09:08 - is same and we have it
09:11 - as we had it in the
09:13 - design
09:14 - so that is cool
