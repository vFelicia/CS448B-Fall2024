00:00 - hello friends welcome to programming
00:03 - knowledge in this video I will show you
00:06 - how to use describe command in MySQL
00:10 - whenever we create a table using insert
00:13 - query we describe the structure of the
00:16 - table like what should be the name of
00:19 - the column what should be the datatype
00:21 - and what should be constrained now at
00:24 - any point if we want to see the
00:26 - structure of your table or schema that
00:29 - you have created then we can use
00:32 - describe command so let us see first
00:35 - open terminal MySQL - new route - be
00:53 - okay
00:54 - we are my CL now write show databases to
01:01 - see which are the database they present
01:03 - in our computer ok so as you can see we
01:09 - have data test database here just use
01:13 - that now how database is changed we
01:24 - right show tables and we have two tables
01:29 - here one student and second step so now
01:35 - we want to see the structure of student
01:38 - table
01:39 - let us first fire select query select
01:42 - star from student as you can see first
01:50 - we have roll number then name and then
01:54 - surname in which roll number is our
01:57 - primary key so write describe
02:04 - and then stable name press enter as you
02:12 - can see this is the structure of student
02:15 - table for schema let us understand them
02:19 - one by one the first column is stand for
02:24 - the name of the field there are present
02:26 - in the table the first column is roll
02:30 - number as you can see here the second
02:33 - one is name and the third one is surname
02:37 - so these are the fields that are present
02:40 - instrument ever the second column stands
02:45 - for the data type that we have specified
02:47 - while creating this student table as you
02:50 - can see roll number has type of integer
02:54 - and the maximum value or the maximum
02:58 - length that we can insert is 11 and name
03:03 - and surname both have datatype werke
03:06 - where stands for variable and guest and
03:09 - hot character that means we're care
03:12 - variable character and maximum length is
03:16 - fortified if on you want to see the data
03:21 - type or list of data type they're
03:23 - present in my square you can go to the
03:26 - documentation in MySQL website where you
03:30 - can find all the data types that are
03:32 - available in MySQL there are lots of
03:35 - data type like integer characters small
03:38 - int begin long double float also
03:42 - characters text and the third column is
03:48 - represent null constraint and this means
03:53 - that whether you can amp you can left a
03:58 - fill or a column null or not because the
04:03 - roll number is our primary key it cannot
04:06 - be not null because we have to specify
04:09 - the primary key otherwise there is no
04:12 - value that can uniquely identify the
04:15 - entire row in your table
04:18 - name and surname possibly convener and
04:22 - the fourth column specify which of the
04:27 - field we have declared as primary key in
04:30 - this particular table roll number is our
04:34 - primary key as you can see and the
04:40 - default column is stands for if you
04:44 - haven't specified any values for the
04:48 - column that you have declared in student
04:50 - table then by default which value it
04:54 - should get me we had not specified any
04:59 - default value while creating this
05:01 - turntable that's why there are null here
05:05 - if you want to specify the default value
05:08 - then you can specify we will see about
05:11 - this in our later wizard in much deeper
05:14 - so this is how we can use describe table
05:19 - to see the structure of your table or
05:23 - schema that you have created now just
05:26 - close this terminal and open my scan
05:31 - work mate
05:39 - so describe and then table name just
05:44 - fire it as you can see the first name is
05:52 - stands for fields that you have in your
05:55 - table the second is datatype the third
06:01 - one is for null constraint and then the
06:05 - key constraint that your primary key
06:07 - that roll number is our primary key
06:09 - that's why its own fried in roll number
06:13 - and the default value now let me just
06:19 - write another table
06:21 - tap as you can see we have only one
06:27 - filled in temp table that is ID the data
06:32 - type is integer and the null constraint
06:37 - is no because iodine our primary key as
06:40 - you can see here default one is not
06:43 - ready so this is how you can use this
06:46 - flag and the table so thank
