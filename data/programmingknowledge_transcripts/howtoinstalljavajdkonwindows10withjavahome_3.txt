00:00 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:02 - show you how you can download and
00:03 - install java jdk on your windows 10
00:07 - operating system so let's get started
00:09 - first of all open your favorite browser
00:11 - and search for java jdk and here you
00:16 - will see the first link which will
00:18 - appear here will be from oracle comm
00:20 - just click this link here and here you
00:24 - will see two options one is Java
00:26 - platform with JDK another is NetBeans
00:29 - with JDK 8 we want to click this Java
00:34 - button here and in here you will see
00:39 - various options to download Java on your
00:43 - Windows operating system or Linux or Mac
00:46 - OS so first of all just click this
00:50 - accept license agreement this radio
00:53 - button and then you can download these
00:57 - executable file for your operating
00:59 - systems so we want to install it for our
01:02 - Windows operating system and if you are
01:04 - using Windows 10 most probably you have
01:06 - windows 64-bit so just click this last
01:10 - option ok and it's going to install Java
01:15 - JDK on your Windows 10 operating system
01:17 - now once it's downloaded I have already
01:21 - downloaded it it's going to look like
01:23 - this it's it will be like an executable
01:26 - file which you can run so just just
01:28 - double click on it and it's going to
01:34 - show you this user account control just
01:38 - click yes and I'm going to minimize
01:41 - everything else and now the Java setup
01:47 - has been started you just need to click
01:48 - Next here and leave everything is
01:52 - default click Next
02:01 - you
02:05 - now while this installation is going on
02:08 - let's see how to check whether Java is
02:11 - already installed on your system or not
02:14 - so the simple way to check if Java is
02:17 - installed in your system is just go to
02:20 - your Windows Start button here and right
02:23 - click here and open command prompt and
02:27 - by the way our Java installation is
02:31 - asking for this next procedure so just
02:35 - click Next and then we will come to this
02:39 - command prompt and in here you just need
02:42 - to write Java C and press ENTER and if
02:47 - it gives you this result that Java C is
02:51 - not recognized as an internal or
02:54 - external command then most probably Java
02:56 - is not installed on your system so close
02:59 - this command prompt so now we will check
03:01 - it once again once Java is installed on
03:03 - our system
03:06 - and when the Java installation is
03:09 - complete it will give you this message
03:12 - that Java SE development kit 8 update 60
03:16 - successfully installed you just need to
03:18 - click close and now what you need to do
03:22 - is open your folder explorer and go to
03:25 - your pc or click this pc and go to see
03:30 - folder and go to program files and here
03:35 - you will be able to see this folder
03:36 - called java and inside this java you
03:40 - will see two folders one is jdk another
03:44 - is JRE
03:45 - so for simplicity you can just rename
03:49 - those as only JDK and JRE so JDK
03:55 - Jadakiss stands for Java development kit
03:57 - and JRE stands for Java runtime
04:02 - environment
04:03 - okay so JDK and JRE now once you have
04:08 - installed Java you just need to setup
04:12 - environment variable for Java so that
04:14 - whenever some program wants to look for
04:18 - Java it's automatically recognized by
04:22 - your program so to setup environment
04:26 - variable what you need to do is
04:27 - right-click on your windows button here
04:31 - not left click but right click right so
04:34 - left click will open this option but
04:37 - when you right click it will open this
04:40 - these options and in right click you
04:43 - will see this option called control
04:45 - panel just open it and in here go to
04:49 - system and in here click system ok so go
04:55 - to system and security and click system
04:57 - and in here you just need to click
04:59 - advanced system settings and in here you
05:03 - will be able to see this environment
05:05 - variables and in here go to system
05:09 - variables here and just go down and
05:13 - click the option which says path ok so
05:17 - just double click on it and it's going
05:20 - to open
05:20 - so we need to added this path variable
05:25 - system variable right so go at the last
05:28 - and what you need to do is you need to
05:31 - copy the location where you have
05:33 - installed this Java so go to Program
05:36 - Files Java and go inside JDK folder and
05:40 - then go inside bin folder where all the
05:43 - binary files are there and copy this
05:46 - location which is c program files slash
05:49 - Java slash JDK slash bin right and then
05:53 - give a semicolon here and then paste
05:56 - your path which you have copied which is
05:58 - C colon slash program file slash Java
06:01 - slash JDK slash bin okay and once again
06:05 - give a semicolon here and then go to the
06:09 - folder where you have installed Java
06:12 - once again and here this time go to JRE
06:16 - folder and inside JRE go to bin folder
06:19 - ok and once again copy this path and
06:22 - after the semicolon just paste this path
06:26 - here ok and click OK which will save
06:31 - your parts and click OK once again click
06:34 - OK once again and you can minimize this
06:37 - and now once again when you open the
06:40 - command prompt so just open command
06:43 - prompt once again and then run Java C
06:46 - once again so Java C and press ENTER and
06:51 - now you can see it will give you so many
06:54 - options and Java C is basically a
06:58 - command to compile Java source files so
07:02 - it will give you this message that the
07:05 - uses of Java C is like this Java C then
07:08 - options then source file right so now
07:12 - Java JDK is installed on your system now
07:16 - in some cases you may want to configure
07:19 - Java home also after installing Java so
07:25 - let's see how we can configure Java home
07:28 - so once again right click on your Start
07:31 - menu and then go
07:34 - - control panel and once again go to
07:36 - system security and once again go to
07:39 - system
07:40 - and in here go to advanced system
07:43 - settings and go to environment variables
07:46 - and this time we will go to user
07:49 - variables for your whatever your
07:51 - computer name is and in here just click
07:54 - this new button and we will create a new
07:57 - variable name which is Java in capital
08:01 - and then underscore and then home and
08:05 - this will be the variable name which is
08:08 - Java home so make it capital and
08:11 - separated by underscore and then write
08:14 - it home so just remember that the
08:17 - spelling must be same and separated by
08:20 - by this underscore right and in here you
08:24 - need to give the path to your JDK folder
08:27 - so go to the location wherever you have
08:29 - installed Java and go to the JDK folder
08:33 - and then copy the path of the JDK folder
08:37 - and paste it here ok and click OK ok and
08:43 - ok so in this way you can configure Java
08:47 - home or environment variable so I hope
