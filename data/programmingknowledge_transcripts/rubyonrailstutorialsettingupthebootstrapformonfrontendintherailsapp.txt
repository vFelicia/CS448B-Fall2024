00:00 - now what in previous tutorial we have
00:02 - learned about models and rails
00:04 - so we are going to continue with uh like
00:06 - further development how to develop our
00:08 - application
00:09 - in rails so we had created a model in
00:12 - rails
00:13 - and basically you can type here so i
00:16 - have started already started my server
00:18 - i'll
00:18 - show you how to like you can type trails
00:22 - server to start your server and instead
00:24 - of server you can type rails console so
00:27 - it will open interactive shell on your
00:28 - rails machine
00:30 - okay so and here you can start your
00:33 - server rails
00:34 - server so i have opened the console here
00:37 - so that it gives you a better view
00:39 - and we had made post.connection so
00:42 - we had made a model post.connection and
00:45 - you can
00:46 - now press ctrl and then you can print
00:49 - post so it gives you the data structure
00:52 - what we are following in the post so it
00:54 - has an id integer title string
00:56 - description text created at datetime and
00:57 - updated our data
00:59 - so we so this is how we i showed you
01:01 - operations in the last video of hostel
01:03 - what we can form
01:05 - now let's this is our server and
01:08 - let's uh now let's move with some
01:11 - like something new to this edition
01:15 - now what you can do you can move the
01:16 - bootstrap website and i can
01:18 - click here open into tab and this would
01:21 - guide me to the bootstrap website
01:22 - i can refer to this page and here what i
01:26 - can do
01:27 - uh what i can do i can move to forms
01:31 - and and i can refer to forms and what i
01:34 - can do
01:35 - here is uh click on overview
01:39 - then click on like this and overview
01:43 - and this would give you like diff you
01:44 - will have different things or forms here
01:46 - uh then you can
01:47 - click on like form control
01:50 - so you can move to this page and you can
01:53 - copy
01:54 - this let's copy this
01:57 - let's copy this and let's paste this
02:00 - inside we have a few files let's paste
02:03 - this on index.html
02:05 - and let's print let's paste this this
02:08 - here
02:09 - and then your application let's refresh
02:11 - this
02:12 - so basically now we have a form here
02:14 - okay
02:15 - so this forms looks pretty big so what
02:18 - we can do we can
02:20 - try to small it down and for this we can
02:23 - add this give this class as call
02:27 - call md6 to take the width of six
02:31 - and and let's give it a class of column
02:34 - d6 so
02:36 - okay so nothing to this so let me
02:39 - inspect this element
02:40 - and yeah so here yeah
02:43 - so i have this diff class is called md6
02:48 - and this should work i think
02:51 - okay so let's let's make another div
02:55 - let's make another dip div and
02:59 - let's wrap this inside this day
03:03 - yeah and let's this give this dip a
03:06 - class
03:07 - of call nd six
03:11 - because bushra has a total width of 12
03:14 - columns we are
03:14 - asking it to take a width of six columns
03:17 - let's
03:18 - okay it doesn't look either now
03:22 - and let's give it a call six
03:26 - okay i forgot to like close the tag
03:30 - yeah yeah so now it works perfectly fine
03:34 - uh and then you can give style
03:38 - of margin
03:41 - uh zero auto so this would place this
03:44 - inside the center
03:46 - okay so this should work perfectly fine
03:49 - yeah and you can like this is perfectly
03:53 - fine and
03:54 - inside our header uh let's create
03:57 - instead of header let's give this a go
04:01 - to app and let's give this a two app
04:05 - and we can like now everything looks
04:08 - perfectly fine
04:09 - and we could do like so yeah
04:12 - so this is good okay so yeah so
04:15 - now we try to create a to-do app here
04:18 - from now
04:19 - and this is example email address now
04:22 - let's modify the
04:23 - few things so that we can uh operate on
04:25 - them so
04:26 - instead of this let's give this
04:30 - a title
04:33 - and if here if we give this a title name
04:36 - is equal to title
04:39 - so here we give it a name as a title and
04:42 - here we give this
04:43 - a name
04:46 - okay the name should the input type is
04:48 - equal to text
04:49 - and let's give the input type
04:53 - okay we'll try to close this yeah yeah
04:56 - so
04:58 - so this is this is the input type is
05:00 - equal to text and let's give this
05:04 - name is equal to title and here we have
05:06 - a text area
05:07 - let's give this as a name you go to text
05:11 - area
05:12 - okay so this looks good
05:16 - so this is how we printed so this is
05:18 - title
05:19 - and and this is basically for us this
05:22 - means description so we will give this a
05:24 - description
05:26 - and and this is here we also type it as
05:29 - description okay
05:32 - so this cryption
05:36 - is good yeah so let's
05:39 - and we remove this and we need to wrap
05:42 - this everything inside a form
05:45 - okay and let's close this here
05:51 - so let's yeah so we need to wrap this
05:53 - inside a form
05:55 - yeah so this looks pretty good yeah so
05:57 - fine so
05:59 - so this is like a kind of a footer for
06:01 - us this is like a kind of header
06:03 - and so we need to like this is how we
06:05 - define it
06:06 - so this looks good so we have made some
06:09 - boilerplate
06:10 - front end for our app and instead of
06:13 - email you should change this to text
06:16 - okay and now we create a method for this
06:22 - method is equal to post
06:27 - and yeah so let's refresh this
06:30 - so good so we have made this method
06:33 - equal to pose
06:34 - and let's create a action equal to
06:38 - add okay let's create this to add
06:41 - so action is to slash add and
06:45 - uh so this should work fine and
06:49 - so let's create uh so
06:52 - since like we have created this created
06:54 - this response so left
06:55 - let's create this action which takes a
06:59 - post request
06:59 - and give it a slash add and
07:03 - let's create something as this 2
07:06 - is equal to root add
07:10 - okay and let's create a okay one thing
07:13 - you need to make sure
07:15 - that you need to add a token tag here
07:18 - because
07:19 - a post request the question is the csc
07:22 - css csf rf token
07:24 - and you need to define token underscore
07:27 - tag here
07:28 - and you can now close this tag and this
07:30 - is looks perfectly fine so let's
07:32 - finish this page so yeah good now
07:36 - we need to define a post request inside
07:38 - of controller so
07:39 - that is define add
07:42 - and that is end and render json params
07:46 - is the same thing we are going to do
07:48 - here
07:49 - and inside a form we need to define uh
07:51 - like a
07:52 - button so let's define a button
07:57 - so let's click this the same plus if
08:00 - class is equal to
08:02 - mb3 and let's
08:06 - get a button
08:12 - input let's create a button yeah
08:20 - so let's create a button input type
08:26 - is equal to text class
08:30 - is equal to btn btn primary
08:37 - and let's yeah so it's a good good
08:41 - and we can
08:44 - remove this placeholder because this is
08:46 - not needed
08:49 - we can move this placeholder
08:54 - okay we can move this placeholder id is
08:56 - also not needed
08:58 - okay okay id is needed and because id is
09:01 - equal to needed because
09:05 - let's get give this to
09:09 - title id and
09:12 - let's give to this is this a description
09:15 - id
09:17 - description id
09:20 - and we need to like wrap this
09:23 - description id
09:24 - here because this is
09:27 - works on id and this is text id
09:33 - so like a good amount of changes has
09:35 - been done let's refresh this
09:37 - and yes so this is between button
09:40 - primary and
09:41 - a value should be
09:44 - add okay and let's give a style
09:50 - is equal to display
09:55 - block okay and it should be done
09:59 - yeah so yeah so this is a button i add
10:02 - and let's give a display block and
10:06 - margin 0
10:10 - auto because margin 0 auto will align
10:13 - this button to center
10:16 - okay so let's give this yeah
10:20 - refresh yeah so this looks perfectly
10:22 - fine
