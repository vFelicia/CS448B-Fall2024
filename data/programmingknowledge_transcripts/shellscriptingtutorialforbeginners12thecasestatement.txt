00:01 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - shell scripting tutorial for beginners
00:05 - in this video we will learn how to use
00:07 - case statement in
00:09 - scripting so the case statement is good
00:12 - alternate for multi-level if then else
00:16 - condition or statements it enables us to
00:19 - match several uh values against one
00:22 - value now what is the basic uh Syntax
00:26 - for a case statement so let me show you
00:29 - the basic Syntax for case statement so
00:33 - this is the basic Syntax for case
00:34 - statement you use the keyword uh case
00:38 - and then you give any expression to
00:40 - evaluate right this can be a variable
00:43 - name or any expression to evaluate then
00:46 - you will uh give the keyword in and then
00:51 - you Match multiple patterns so you can
00:55 - have multiple cases to evaluate so you
00:59 - can can use a pattern here it can be a
01:04 - strict pattern or flexible pattern like
01:07 - regular expression and then you use this
01:11 - parenthesis closing parenthesis to show
01:14 - that this is the end of this case and
01:17 - then comes the uh statement after this
01:21 - case so if the case is uh true then the
01:26 - statement is executed and then this
01:28 - double semicolon
01:30 - indicates the script that this case
01:33 - statement has been finished so start
01:36 - using the second uh case or start
01:39 - evaluating the second case right and
01:42 - with the second case also you can use a
01:45 - statement and then the third case comes
01:47 - and fourth case and then all the case
01:50 - comes and at the end you have this Eck
01:55 - or the reverse of case so from uh right
01:59 - hand side you can see c a s e but it's
02:03 - the reverse of this case uh spelling
02:06 - right so this is how you can use case
02:10 - let's take an example and uh let's see
02:12 - how we can uh you know actually use case
02:16 - statement in real life so let's say we
02:20 - want to evaluate uh a rental uh of some
02:25 - vehicle So to that for example I will uh
02:29 - just just take an argument with the
02:34 - script so I will take an argument with
02:36 - the script when I run the script and
02:39 - this argument I will save in uh for
02:41 - example in a variable and variable name
02:44 - I will name it as vehicle is equal to
02:48 - and then the first argument which is
02:50 - passed using the script I will just pass
02:54 - it to the variable vehicle okay and then
02:57 - I will evaluate this vehicle so this
03:00 - expression comes here and it can be a
03:04 - variable also so you can just evaluate
03:07 - this vehicle here so case and then
03:09 - dollar symbol and then the name of the
03:12 - variable which contains the name of the
03:14 - vehicle or type of the vehicle and then
03:17 - this uh in and then comes the pattern
03:22 - okay so for now we will just see the
03:25 - strict pattern here or compare the
03:27 - strict pattern so if this vle is for
03:30 - example car we will just execute some
03:35 - statement for example we will Echo that
03:39 - uh the rent of this car is something so
03:42 - let's say we will print rent of the
03:45 - vehicle in our case which is car uh is
03:48 - $100 for example right in the similar
03:52 - manner you can Echo second uh statement
03:56 - so if the vehicle is for for example van
04:01 - then we will say rent of the van is uh
04:06 - uh $80 right and in the same way we can
04:10 - uh add multiple uh uh pattern matching
04:13 - here so let me add one more pattern for
04:17 - example we will get the input bicycle so
04:22 - bicycle rent is for example $20 or let's
04:25 - say $5 okay and uh let's say user inputs
04:33 - truck so the rent of the truck is $150
04:38 - for example right and if the user inputs
04:42 - the any other value other than these
04:46 - four values we want to catch this value
04:49 - which is uh random value for example and
04:52 - this random value you can catch from
04:56 - star and then this parenthesis okay now
04:59 - this estx means if you know uh Linux
05:02 - command line uh estx means a wild card
05:06 - which matches any text okay so in the
05:10 - default case this case will be uh
05:13 - followed and then we will say here we
05:16 - will Echo here that this uh vehicle is
05:20 - unknown and we will just say the vehicle
05:22 - is unknown okay so this is the default
05:25 - condition right so let's run the script
05:29 - and let let's see what happens when we
05:31 - uh run the script so and then I will
05:34 - just run this
05:35 - script and it says unknown vehicle
05:39 - because I haven't given any argument
05:43 - with this script and this script expect
05:46 - that the first argument which is passed
05:49 - with the script is the vehicle type
05:52 - right so let's run the script once again
05:55 - so let's say we enter car this time so
05:59 - the script group name and the argument
06:00 - is car and you can see uh rent of the
06:03 - car is $100 right so this condition or
06:08 - expression is met so it echoes this uh
06:13 - statement right earlier we haven't given
06:15 - any argument here so it goes to the
06:18 - default uh case which is this case which
06:21 - is unknown vehicle right let's give some
06:24 - other case for example
06:26 - van and this time the van is uh $80 for
06:30 - example let's say we enter
06:34 - truck and this time the rent is $150 for
06:38 - the truck right so in this way you can
06:41 - do the pattern matching and uh in this
06:45 - way you can use the case statement in
06:48 - scripting but here the pattern matching
06:52 - can be anything so right now we are
06:54 - matching the strict uh pattern so we are
06:57 - just matching whatever is enter using
07:00 - this argument but this can be uh
07:03 - anything so this uh case can be any uh
07:07 - regular expression or any pattern which
07:09 - you want to match so if you want to
07:12 - match some pattern you can do it uh also
07:16 - in this case and if you don't know what
07:19 - is pattern and how to use pattern just
07:22 - uh search for regular expression I think
07:25 - and you will have the good idea about
07:28 - pattern matching and uh you know regular
07:30 - Expressions also okay so this is uh just
07:34 - one example of using uh case statement
07:37 - in the next video I will uh take one
07:40 - more example of uh using case statement
07:43 - and we will consolidate our knowledge on
07:46 - case statements so stay tuned and please
07:48 - rate comment subscribe and bye for now
