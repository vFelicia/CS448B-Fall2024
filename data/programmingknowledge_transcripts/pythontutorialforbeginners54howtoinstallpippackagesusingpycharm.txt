00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - python tutorial for beginners in the
00:04 - last video I have shown you how you can
00:06 - install and manage your packages using
00:09 - Python pip now in this video I'm going
00:12 - to show you how you can install and
00:15 - manage your pip packages using PyCharm
00:19 - IDE so here I have a very simple OpenCV
00:23 - Python script which I used to load this
00:27 - image which is Python logo dot PNG file
00:30 - now in order to run this script I need
00:33 - to import this package which is called
00:35 - cb2 and this package is available on
00:40 - Python package index so let me just open
00:44 - the pi pi dot o-r-g website and let me
00:49 - search for OpenCV here and when I search
00:51 - for OpenCV you will be able to see
00:54 - multiple OpenCV related packages but the
00:58 - one I want to install is this one which
01:00 - is OpenCV - python so i'm going to click
01:04 - on this package to see more details
01:06 - about this package so you can see the
01:08 - latest version of this package at that
01:11 - time of making this video is three point
01:13 - four point three point eighteen and in
01:16 - order to install this package with pip
01:19 - you just need to run this command which
01:21 - is PIP install OpenCV - python now in
01:26 - order to import this OpenCV - python on
01:30 - your PyCharm ide what you need to do is
01:34 - just create your project and write your
01:38 - code and then go to the file and then go
01:42 - to the settings so just choose the
01:44 - settings option here and once the
01:47 - settings option is open you will be able
01:49 - to see different categories here you
01:53 - need to choose this category which says
01:55 - project : the name of your project
01:58 - and then click on project interpreter
02:02 - now by default some packages are already
02:05 - available here which is PIP and setup
02:08 - tools and we want to install a special
02:12 - package which is
02:13 - OpenCV - python so in order to add this
02:17 - package you just need to click on this
02:20 - plus button so I'm going to click on
02:23 - this plus button and you will be able to
02:25 - see this search bar here so here you
02:29 - just need to search for the package you
02:31 - are looking for so I have just entered
02:34 - open CV - Python here and the first
02:38 - option which is available here I have
02:41 - just selected it and you can see this is
02:43 - the same package which we have seen on
02:46 - the Python package index website so
02:49 - let's match this once again so here you
02:52 - can see the latest version as three
02:54 - point four point three point eighteen
02:56 - and here also the latest version is the
02:59 - same and the description is also same so
03:01 - wrapper package for OpenCV python
03:04 - bindings and here also the description
03:07 - is same so this is the package we want
03:11 - to install if you want to see the github
03:13 - repository also I'm going to just scroll
03:15 - here and then I'm going to open the
03:18 - github page from the PI pi website for
03:21 - this open CV - Python and this github
03:25 - URL is also same which we are seeing on
03:29 - the PyCharm IDE so now we know that we
03:33 - need to install this package which is
03:35 - open CV - Python so we just need to
03:38 - click on this button which says install
03:41 - package which is going to install this
03:44 - package for your project and after some
03:47 - time you will be able to see this
03:49 - message which says package open CV -
03:52 - Python installed successfully so I'm
03:55 - going to just close this window and
03:57 - after closing this window you will be
04:00 - able to see that this open CV is now
04:03 - visible in your project interpreter and
04:06 - now we are going to click once again ok
04:09 - and once you click OK you will be able
04:12 - to see here at the bottom some processes
04:15 - are running which is the process of
04:18 - importing this library into your project
04:20 - and after some time you will see that
04:23 - this red squiggly line for the error
04:26 - has disappeared from the import CV line
04:31 - so now we will be able to run this code
04:34 - so let's run this code and let's verify
04:37 - if everything is working fine so I'm
04:39 - going to just right click and then click
04:41 - on run the project name or the file name
04:45 - and it has opened the picture which I
04:48 - want to open which is this Python logo
04:52 - picture so this is how you can install
04:54 - and manage your pip packages using
04:57 - PyCharm IDE I hope you have enjoyed this
05:00 - video and I will see you in the next
