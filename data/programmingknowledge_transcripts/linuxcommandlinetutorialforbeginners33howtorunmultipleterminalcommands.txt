00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Linux command line tutorial for
00:03 - beginners in this video we will see how
00:06 - to run two or more terminal commands at
00:09 - once in Linux so till now we have seen
00:12 - how we can you know use commands but we
00:16 - haven't seen how we can combine two
00:18 - commands and run them together and this
00:21 - is what we are going to see in this
00:23 - video so there are few options we can
00:26 - use to combine commands so the first
00:29 - command or first option which we can use
00:33 - to combine command is semicolon and I am
00:37 - going to tell you how this works so
00:39 - whenever you want to combine command for
00:42 - example I want to use LS command and I
00:45 - also want to know the present working
00:48 - directory so I am going to use PWD
00:51 - command and in between I have used this
00:53 - semicolon right and this is going to
00:57 - combine these commands and then it is
01:00 - going to show us the output right and I
01:03 - am going to just press ENTER and this is
01:06 - what the output is so first of all it
01:09 - has you know given us the output for the
01:12 - LS command which is this output and then
01:16 - it has executed the PWD command which is
01:19 - this output right so this is the output
01:23 - from the PWD command
01:24 - and this is the output from the you know
01:27 - LS come on so in this way you can you
01:31 - know combine these commands using
01:33 - semicolon right we can also execute some
01:36 - other command for example in the last
01:39 - videos I have shown you how to use date
01:41 - command and Cal command and let us say
01:45 - we also you want to use PWD this time
01:49 - also right so I am going to just press
01:52 - ENTER and now it shows the first of all
01:55 - that gate if this come on then the
02:00 - calendar which is by this command and
02:02 - then the present working directory which
02:05 - is by this command right now one thing
02:09 - to note here is whenever you use semi
02:12 - : then for example one command is wrong
02:16 - so what I am going to do first is for
02:18 - example I want to give this command Cal
02:21 - which is not existing so it is going to
02:24 - give us this kind of output right so
02:27 - let's use this scale in between here so
02:32 - instead of smaller letter Cal I'm going
02:35 - to just use Cal in capital letters and I
02:38 - am going to press ENTER here so you can
02:41 - see what happened here
02:43 - so first command is executed which is
02:45 - going to give this output for us second
02:48 - command doesn't really exist so it's
02:51 - going to give us the error but it's also
02:54 - going to go to the next command is going
02:57 - to print the next command output which
03:00 - is the present working directory right
03:02 - so this command doesn't stop executing
03:06 - command if one command fails right so
03:09 - it's going to execute the next command
03:11 - if the command in between also fails
03:14 - right so this is the speciality of this
03:17 - command so I am going to just clear the
03:19 - terminal and then I am going to talk
03:21 - about the second command the second
03:24 - command to combine a few commands
03:27 - together is using these ampersand symbol
03:31 - mm puts in percent symbols right and
03:34 - this is essentially is going to do the
03:37 - same so for example I want to do LS once
03:40 - again and then double ampersand I want
03:44 - to do PW T and then once again mm % then
03:48 - I want to see the date so I'm going to
03:51 - give the date and for example I want to
03:54 - see the calendar also so I am going to
03:56 - give the CA el command and press ENTER
03:59 - so it gives the same output so the
04:03 - output first will be the LS and then the
04:07 - present working directory then output
04:10 - for the date and then the output for the
04:13 - calendar right now one thing to note
04:16 - here in both these combining command
04:19 - with semicolon and these M percent is
04:21 - the sequence of matters here so for
04:25 - example
04:26 - when I use a date semicolon Cal here
04:32 - then first date will be executed and
04:35 - then calendar will be executed so this
04:38 - sequence matter so for example when you
04:40 - do Cal and them date then it's going to
04:44 - show the calendar first and then the
04:46 - date okay and same is with the ampersand
04:51 - also so instead of this semicolon when
04:54 - you use ampersand is going to show us
04:57 - the calendar first and then the date and
04:59 - when we use date I am present Cal then
05:04 - it's going to give us the you know this
05:06 - date first and then the calendar okay
05:09 - but what is the difference between these
05:12 - two commands so let me clear the
05:13 - terminal and then I'm going to show you
05:16 - what is the difference between these two
05:18 - commands okay so the difference between
05:21 - these two command is whenever you use
05:24 - this semicolon is going to run us every
05:28 - command regardless of the success or
05:31 - failure of the previous command right so
05:35 - we have already seen for example we give
05:38 - the wrong command which doesn't really
05:41 - exist for example Cal here and then
05:44 - semicolon date then first command fails
05:48 - here but second execute so it doesn't
05:52 - matter if first command is fail or the
05:55 - command in between field is going to
05:57 - execute all the command there right but
06:01 - when you use the same thing with the
06:04 - ampersand then whenever you know
06:08 - previous command fails then it is going
06:11 - to stop executing the next command so
06:13 - when we use this you see it just give
06:17 - the output that this command does not
06:18 - exist and it doesn't go to the next
06:22 - command which is date right we can once
06:25 - again check this by typing PWD
06:28 - ampersand for example once again capital
06:33 - date here and then apus m % Cal here
06:37 - right so it
06:39 - was the output for the PWD and then the
06:42 - next command doesn't really exist so
06:44 - it's you know give the output command
06:47 - doesn't exist and then it doesn't
06:49 - execute the next command after the error
06:52 - but with the semicolon it's going to
06:55 - execute every command regardless the
06:58 - previous command is failed or succeeded
07:00 - okay so this is the difference between
07:02 - these two command now we are going to
07:05 - see the next option which is the or
07:07 - option right so or you can use using
07:12 - these double pipes here and this is how
07:17 - you can use it so for example you use LS
07:20 - and then you use or for example with
07:24 - these pipes and then PWD and then press
07:28 - ENTER and then what you see as an output
07:31 - here is the output is the combination of
07:35 - logical or here so if the first command
07:38 - is successful it's not going to go to
07:41 - the second comma right and then when the
07:45 - same command I do with for example LS
07:48 - capital LS and press Enter then it's
07:52 - going to show you the output for the
07:55 - second command right so once the first
07:58 - command is not successful the or will
08:02 - allow this
08:04 - you know these commands go to the next
08:06 - command and it's going to execute the
08:07 - next command so it's like a logical or
08:10 - operation so if the first command
08:12 - execution fails then it's going to go to
08:15 - the next command right so this is how
08:18 - you can combine commands in Linux so
08:22 - what we have learned so for example of
08:25 - what we have learned is for example we
08:27 - have to command a and B then whenever we
08:31 - use semicolon then run a and then B
08:36 - regardless of the success or failure of
08:39 - a right so a and B are going to run
08:43 - regardless a fails or not right and we
08:47 - have also seen the ampersand and in this
08:50 - case if a fails then B is
08:52 - not going to execute right now however
08:55 - is the or operator and in this case B is
09:00 - only going to be executed if a fails
09:03 - right if a succeeds then B will not be
09:06 - executed so these are the few options
09:09 - you can use to combine command in Linux
