00:01 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Java programming for
00:04 - beginners in this video we will learn
00:07 - about method
00:10 - overloading in the last videos I have
00:12 - shown you how to use a
00:15 - method now method overloading is same as
00:19 - declaring method but the main thing is
00:25 - you can Define different method with the
00:28 - same name so
00:30 - two method you can Define with the same
00:33 - name which can perform two different uh
00:38 - you know different logic so for example
00:41 - I want to add two values and I want to
00:44 - declare some method for this so I will
00:47 - declare a function called
00:54 - public static and it will return return
01:00 - integer
01:03 - value and uh I will name it as ADD okay
01:09 - and what it's going to do is it's going
01:11 - to add two values okay and it will
01:15 - return these two values and then I will
01:18 - pass int
01:20 - a comma int b as the parameters and I
01:27 - will return
01:30 - the sum of these two values right A +
01:36 - B and I can call it in here right but in
01:42 - uh real uh World programming the
01:46 - situation may occur uh that you want to
01:49 - add not only two integer values you may
01:53 - want to add two uh double values or
01:57 - decimal values or you may want to add to
02:01 - uh strings because plus you can be used
02:05 - as a concatenation operators also so
02:09 - what you can do in Java is you can
02:12 - Define the method two different method
02:15 - with the same name but for
02:20 - example different parameters and
02:25 - different values okay so you can Define
02:29 - as add something like this or you can
02:32 - Define add something
02:35 - like
02:38 - this and this is called method
02:43 - overloading whenever you
02:45 - define different method with the same
02:48 - name which performs some different logic
02:52 - but they have I mean the same name they
02:56 - can perform mostly same logic but you
03:01 - know data type you want to use them or
03:04 - parameter you want to pass them can be
03:08 - different and whenever you will call
03:11 - these method for example something like
03:15 - this you want to add two values you can
03:19 - just call add two integer one comma
03:26 - 36 so it will by default J knows that
03:31 - whenever you pass two integers here in a
03:34 - method you are calling this method
03:38 - because you are passing two integers in
03:40 - a same way whenever you pass to a double
03:44 - values for
03:46 - example 5
03:48 - something
03:51 - and 40 point something then your Java
03:56 - program knows that you're calling this
03:59 - video so Java is intelligent enough to
04:03 - deduce your method by your uh
04:08 - initialization of the method in the same
04:11 - way you can uh pass whenever you want to
04:14 - pass uh to names for
04:19 - example hello and second parameter
04:24 - as
04:27 - world then also it uh you know it can uh
04:32 - know that you're calling this function
04:35 - because it takes string values and
04:37 - whenever you run the program it'll give
04:40 - you different result and so in the first
04:44 - case this ad is calling this function in
04:48 - the second case this ad function is
04:51 - calling this function and in the third
04:54 - case this ad is calling this
04:56 - function so the method over overloading
05:00 - or the basic logic of method overloading
05:03 - is you can
05:04 - Define different method with a same
05:08 - name to perform different operations
05:12 - okay but logically they will be doing
05:16 - some same kind of
05:18 - work so this is method overloading in
05:21 - Java I hope you enjoyed this video
