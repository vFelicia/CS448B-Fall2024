00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can download and install and
00:04 - configure maven on your Ubuntu operating
00:07 - system so let's get started so I have
00:10 - just collected and written all the
00:15 - commands which you will need to install
00:17 - maven and configure maven on your open
00:21 - to operating system so all these
00:24 - commands I'm going to give you in the
00:26 - description of this video so you can
00:28 - directly copy them and paste them into
00:30 - your terminal and you will be good to go
00:34 - so first of all we need to install Java
00:37 - in order to install maven so let's start
00:41 - with the installation of Java so for
00:44 - installing Java we will need these four
00:46 - commands so I'm going to minimize this
00:48 - editor and I'm going to open the
00:51 - terminal so the first command is this
00:54 - sudo add - apt - repository PPA colon
00:59 - web up8 team four slash Java and then
01:04 - press ENTER and then give your open to
01:07 - spaz word and then press ENTER and once
01:10 - again press ENTER and once this command
01:12 - is finished I'm going to paste the
01:14 - second command in order to install Java
01:16 - 8 so this is the second command which is
01:18 - sudo apt install Oracle - Java 8 -
01:22 - Installer press ENTER in order to
01:25 - install Java 8 so now we can see this
01:27 - message here which says Oracle JDK 8 is
01:31 - installed on my system and then there is
01:34 - an important message here and this
01:37 - message says to set Oracle Java JDK 8 as
01:41 - default we need to install Oracle - Java
01:45 - 8 - set - default so we are going to run
01:49 - this command which is given in the
01:51 - example which is this one so I'm going
01:53 - to just copy this command in order to
01:56 - set Java 8 as the default Java version
02:00 - so just copy this command which is sudo
02:03 - apt install Oracle - Java 8 - set -
02:07 - default and paste on to your terminal
02:09 - and then press ENTER and then
02:13 - why and once this command is finished we
02:16 - are going to check the Java version so
02:18 - I'm going to just write Java - - version
02:22 - and then press ENTER and this command
02:25 - gives us some problem I can see could
02:28 - not create Java Virtual Machine so
02:30 - instead of giving double - I think the
02:34 - command is Java - version and you can
02:37 - see this version Java version one point
02:39 - eight point zero point something so if
02:42 - you see this version here that Java
02:45 - eight is installed on your system
02:47 - so now once Java is installed on your
02:49 - abun to operating system we will move to
02:51 - the next step which is actually
02:53 - installing maven so first of all let's
02:56 - see which is the latest version of maven
02:59 - available on the maven website so you
03:02 - just need to go to maven dot Apache dot
03:05 - o-r-g and you will be able to see this
03:08 - Downloads button here or you can also
03:12 - click on this download option so we are
03:15 - going to click on that and I will scroll
03:18 - down and you can see Apache maven three
03:21 - point five point three is the latest
03:24 - version at the time of making this video
03:27 - so we will install this version on our
03:30 - open to operating system so now what we
03:34 - need to do first is we need to CD to the
03:37 - opt directory so I'm going to open the
03:40 - terminal once again and I will just go
03:44 - to the opt directory and then we will
03:49 - download this maven tar dot GZ file so
03:54 - you can see the version we will download
03:57 - is three point five point three which is
04:01 - this one and if you want to know the
04:04 - location of this tar god key that file
04:08 - you can just right click and then copy
04:11 - the location from here and then you will
04:14 - be able to see the location of this star
04:17 - dot cheese that file for the maven okay
04:20 - so I'm going to just copy this command
04:23 - in order to download this
04:26 - gzip file so I'm going to just paste
04:30 - this command which is pseudo W get and
04:32 - the link for this on cheese at file
04:37 - and then I'm going to press ENTER and
04:40 - I'm going to provide my Ubuntu's
04:41 - password and then press Enter
04:43 - which is going to download this tar dodd
04:46 - cheese at file let's see what's the next
04:49 - step next step is obviously we need to
04:51 - enter this so this is the command to
04:54 - extract this file which is sudo tar
04:57 - minus XF and then the tar file name and
05:02 - then I'm going to just press enter once
05:04 - again which is going to extract this
05:07 - file into a folder let's do a LS and
05:09 - let's see what folder we have here so
05:13 - you can see now we have Apache - maven -
05:17 - three point five point three folder now
05:20 - the next step is to move this folder
05:23 - into more understandable form which is
05:29 - Apache maven so we will just remove this
05:33 - extension from here so I'm going to just
05:35 - use this move command to just move this
05:40 - folder into Apache maven folder so just
05:44 - give this command sudo MV your Apache
05:47 - maven folder name and then this will be
05:50 - the destination and I'm going to just
05:53 - press ENTER and I will do LS once again
05:56 - and now you can see our folder name is
06:00 - changed to Apache - maven without the
06:04 - version now the next step is to give
06:09 - this command so I'm going to just copy
06:11 - this command and let me clear the
06:14 - terminal so we will see this command
06:16 - clearer so I'm going to just paste this
06:19 - command and then press ENTER and this
06:21 - command is successful now so we will
06:23 - just move to the next section which is
06:27 - configuring the Apache maven environment
06:30 - so for that we need to go to the etc'
06:36 - profile D folder so I'm going to just
06:39 - see
06:39 - to the et Cie profile D folder so I will
06:43 - just write CD or slash et Cie profile D
06:48 - and inside this folder we are going to
06:51 - create a new file with the name maven
06:54 - dot Sh so you can see using this command
06:59 - you can create dot H file you can use
07:03 - your favorite editor I'm using G added
07:06 - for editing this file you can use Nano
07:10 - or whim or any other editor which you
07:12 - like to create and edit this file so I'm
07:15 - going to use this pseudo G edit maven
07:19 - dot SH which is going to just create
07:22 - this file and open this file in the
07:26 - editor now the next step is to just copy
07:31 - all this text and then paste it into
07:37 - this maven dot SH file and what this
07:41 - text is doing is just exporting some of
07:45 - the environment variables for example
07:47 - Java home environment variable and then
07:51 - m2 home environment variable this is the
07:54 - location and then maven home environment
07:57 - variable and the path environment
07:59 - variable so just copy and paste these
08:03 - exports into your maven dot H file and
08:08 - just save it and then close it so once
08:11 - you have created and copied and pasted
08:14 - this text into your maven dot Sh file we
08:19 - just need to change the permission of
08:21 - this maven dot SH file in order to
08:24 - execute it and this will be the command
08:27 - to change the permission of this maven
08:30 - dot SH and what this chmod command does
08:35 - is so I'm going to just clear the
08:37 - terminal once again and I'm going to
08:39 - just paste this command and this command
08:41 - is sudo chmod plus x maven dot Sh so
08:46 - this is going to change the permission
08:48 - of this maven dot SH to become an
08:52 - executable
08:53 - so I'm going to just give this come on
08:55 - and then we will do LS - al and then we
09:01 - can do maven dot SH and you will see
09:05 - here X is added to the permission of
09:09 - this file so now this file becomes an
09:12 - executable file now the last thing we
09:15 - need to do here is to just give the
09:18 - source command for this maven dot Sh in
09:22 - order to set all the environment
09:23 - variables so just give source come on
09:27 - and then maven dot SH and then press
09:29 - Enter which is going to refresh all the
09:31 - environment variables so now maven is
09:34 - installed on your system and to check
09:36 - whether maven is working you can just
09:40 - provide this Kevon mbn and then - -
09:44 - version and then press enter and you
09:47 - will see which version of maven you have
09:49 - installed so we have installed a three
09:52 - point five point three maven version so
09:54 - if you see all this text that means
09:57 - maven is working fine on your open to
10:02 - operating system now in order to do the
10:04 - quick test you can also go on this maven
10:09 - website which is maven Apache dot o-r-g
10:14 - so I'm going to just go to the home page
10:17 - of this website and then in order to
10:20 - just test whether maven is working fine
10:24 - or not you can go to this section which
10:27 - says use and then there is a five minute
10:31 - test here so I'm going to click on this
10:33 - and you can see first of all you can
10:36 - check the maven version using this MVN -
10:40 - - version command and if you see text
10:43 - like this then it's installed perfectly
10:47 - on your system now in order to create a
10:49 - sample project you can just follow these
10:52 - command which is given under the
10:54 - creating a project so let's do that I'm
10:57 - going to just copy the first command and
11:01 - first of all I will go to my home folder
11:04 - so I will just could do CD
11:07 - and I'm going to clear the terminal and
11:09 - I'm going to do LS and let's create our
11:12 - directory in which we are going to
11:14 - create this maven projects well mkdir
11:18 - MBN underscore work space and then I'm
11:25 - going to CD into this ambien workspace
11:28 - and now I'm going to just paste this
11:30 - command which I have copied which is
11:32 - this one and I'm going to just press
11:36 - Enter
11:37 - we're just going to create this my - app
11:42 - directory first of all it will download
11:44 - all the requirements from the maven
11:47 - repository it will take some time so
11:49 - just wait for that so now this command
11:51 - is successful so now it says we need to
11:54 - CD to my app folder so we will do that
11:57 - I'm going to just LS first of all here
12:01 - and you can see my app folder is created
12:04 - so we will just CD into my app folder
12:07 - and then you will be able to see this
12:11 - kind of folder structure there I'm going
12:14 - to do LS - L air - just see you can see
12:19 - pom dot XML file is there and then the
12:22 - source directory is there so let's build
12:25 - our project using ambient package
12:28 - command which is this one so I'm going
12:30 - to just copy this ambient package come
12:34 - on and I'm going to clear the terminal
12:36 - and then I'm going to just say MB in a
12:39 - package and then press ENTER and this is
12:43 - going to just build my project once
12:46 - again and if I see build successful
12:50 - message then package command worked
12:53 - successfully and everything is working
12:55 - fine regarding maven on my open to
12:59 - operating system so I can see build
13:01 - success that means maven is working fine
13:04 - on my open to operating system so that's
13:08 - it for this video I hope you've enjoyed
