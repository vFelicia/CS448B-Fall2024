00:00 - hello friends welcome to programming
00:02 - knowledge in our previous videos we saw
00:05 - that how to select specific column from
00:09 - a table by a select statement and in
00:12 - this video we will say that how to
00:15 - select specific rows in that column also
00:19 - we want that only the specific values
00:23 - from a particular column will be
00:25 - displayed on the table so let us first
00:28 - see how to do it in a terminal so first
00:31 - of all open your terminal write MySQL
00:40 - provide password let's see which other
00:51 - services that we have
00:53 - so data test information schema MySQL
01:00 - performance schema and system so we use
01:03 - data test let us see which are the
01:12 - tables that we have so we have created
01:20 - one table student table select from
01:32 - student we have this many records in our
01:37 - table so now we want that we want to
01:43 - show the roll number which are greater
01:46 - than 40 so how will we do that so right
01:52 - select star from student
02:02 - and for providing condition we use van
02:07 - keyword there right the columnar on
02:13 - which you want to specify the condition
02:15 - in our case it is roll number is greater
02:22 - than 40 so you can see that only the
02:30 - name and surname of those students who
02:32 - have their roll a much greater than 14
02:34 - bit bit is paying here we can use
02:41 - various arithmetic operators here like
02:45 - hole number 14 we have a student whose
02:52 - roll number is 14 you can also use less
02:59 - and now we want to display the values
03:11 - based on the name so select star from
03:20 - student where name is equal to let's say
03:31 - bridge in here you can see students who
03:39 - have their name is pigeon displaying
03:41 - here now we can also write like select
03:50 - star from name and we want to display
04:05 - the records except that bridging so we
04:12 - have to specify the operator not
04:15 - so for that we use open and closed and
04:19 - clear brackets and then we specify a
04:21 - name you can see here we have all the
04:29 - record except those to Britain we want
04:37 - to specify the column then we can select
04:43 - only ID from student where let's say
04:59 - name is region yeah we have roll number
05:13 - you know number okay yeah you can see 10
05:26 - and 12 are there all numbers so let's
05:30 - just scroll it and open workbench okay
05:44 - so right first of all thanking show you
05:52 - the reports these are the reports that
06:02 - we have before to show the records where
06:13 - roll number less than or equal to 14
06:25 - here you can see 10 11 12 and 14 if we
06:31 - remove that is equal to sign here then
06:33 - this 14 will disappear okay we can also
06:42 - provide specific column name here look
06:45 - like we want then let's say let's say
07:02 - name is equal to redo okay so our
07:12 - condition is based on name but we are
07:15 - displaying roll number and sorry
07:19 - here you can see surname is null and
07:23 - roll number is 11 now let me once again
07:29 - so all the records
07:45 - now if we want to specify condition on
07:51 - these null values as you can see here
07:55 - then you cannot write like select star
07:59 - for student where Sun name is equal to
08:09 - let's say no yeah you can see it
08:17 - displays the last record and even it is
08:21 - not there about it says that the tables
08:24 - contain only these circles let me clear
08:29 - this I want to specify my condition on
08:38 - this particular record you can see the
08:41 - roll number is 11 name is ritu and
08:45 - surname is not I want to display the
08:49 - record which has their surname field
08:53 - null so for that we cannot use is equal
08:59 - to operator we use in keyword select
09:03 - star from student where surname is null
09:21 - here you can see it it is playing the
09:26 - roll number name and surname okay so
09:32 - this is how you can also write specific
09:36 - column name here like roll number only
09:44 - okay so
09:46 - thanks for watching it
09:55 - you
