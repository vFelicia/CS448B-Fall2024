00:01 - hello guys welcome once again in the
00:03 - last video I have shown you how to
00:04 - populate your combo box with the
00:07 - database value so for example I open
00:11 - this combo box and all the values from
00:13 - the database is shown here so these are
00:17 - the names from the database which I I'm
00:20 - showing here in this video I will show
00:23 - you how to show your database values
00:28 - column values in the list box instead of
00:32 - this column I will show you how to load
00:35 - the same values in the list box so let's
00:39 - see how we can do
00:43 - it so first of all this is our window I
00:47 - will go to my tool box and I will search
00:51 - for this list box drag and drop into my
00:55 - form
00:57 - okay just resize it
01:00 - and then I will go to my codes section
01:05 - of my
01:08 - uh window and in the last video I have
01:12 - shown you this fill combo method to fill
01:16 - the database value from column name so
01:21 - all the values from this name column
01:25 - Mark and these all list was displaying
01:29 - in the combo box or was populated in the
01:32 - combo
01:33 - box right so I don't need to do much
01:37 - here I will just copy this whole
01:42 - function all the function so from void
01:46 - to the end of the
01:50 - function and I will paste just below the
01:54 - same method okay so what I have done is
01:58 - I copied the function as and I pasted
02:00 - all the function just below that same
02:03 - fill combo function and I just change
02:07 - the name of this function as
02:10 - fill list
02:13 - box okay so I changed the name of this
02:18 - function and which is list fill list
02:21 - box and
02:24 - then all the code will remain the same
02:27 - so you don't need to change much
02:30 - in the fill combo function so if you
02:34 - don't know the fill combo function code
02:39 - just go to the last video I have
02:42 - explained all the code
02:44 - there so just go there and just see the
02:47 - code and copy all the code from there
02:50 - and in that video we were populating
02:54 - combo box so go to this while loop
02:57 - inside this while loop I was populating
03:00 - my names in my combo box but this time I
03:05 - want to populate my names in my list box
03:09 - so what I will do is I will go to the
03:12 - design view I will select my list box
03:15 - and I will copy the name of my list box
03:17 - from here just copy it go to the code
03:21 - section and instead of this combo box we
03:25 - will
03:26 - paste list box so we replace this combo
03:30 - Box by the list box so I have done just
03:36 - this to populate my list box and all the
03:39 - code will remain same so write listbox
03:42 - do item do add names so it will add all
03:47 - the names to your list box one more
03:51 - thing we need to do is we need to call
03:55 - this function what at the start of the
03:59 - running of the window so just copy this
04:03 - function from here go
04:06 - to the top where your P public method is
04:11 - called and where this initialized
04:15 - component function is there last time we
04:17 - have called fill com combo so it was
04:20 - filling combo box and this time we
04:24 - are calling this fill list box so it
04:28 - will fill the list T
04:31 - box from the database so let's see if it
04:35 - works or
04:38 - not run the code username and
04:43 - password and it's
04:46 - correct okay it's opening the second
04:50 - form and you see here it populates all
04:54 - the
04:56 - names from the database to the list box
05:00 - so let's check if these names are
05:04 - correct so you can see here all the
05:07 - names from my name column comes here now
05:11 - suppose you want instead of these names
05:15 - you want to show the
05:17 - surnames in this list box okay so how
05:22 - you can do that it's very simple just
05:25 - see the column number of the surname so
05:29 - this is column number 0o column number
05:31 - one and column number two so the surname
05:34 - column number is two so I want to
05:38 - populate this column number two in my
05:40 - list box so go to your code we need to
05:46 - change
05:49 - just one thing here in my list box
05:52 - function I will change this get value
05:56 - from here so in your while loop I have
05:59 - declared a string called name I change
06:03 - it as
06:05 - surname and in here I write dr. getet
06:09 - value from my second column so I write
06:13 - two here and I just copy this string and
06:16 - paste it here now it will populate the
06:20 - surname column in my list box let's try
06:23 - and run the
06:27 - program username and password is correct
06:30 - and now the surnames are populated in
06:33 - the list box let's check
06:37 - whether it's correct or
06:39 - not yes all the surnames comes here in
06:43 - the same way you can show these
06:47 - age values or these employee ID values
06:50 - in your list
06:52 - box you can do one more cool thing with
06:57 - this list box if you want to show names
07:01 - and surname together what you can do
07:05 - is just right now you are showing the
07:08 - name just above just copy this code and
07:12 - paste it above and I want the name and
07:16 - surname together so I write this and the
07:20 - name column was one so I change the
07:23 - column number and in here you what you
07:26 - can do is you can write
07:30 - name plus and double
07:35 - quotes you I'm providing call colon you
07:38 - can provide space or something else and
07:41 - then surname so it will show name and
07:44 - surname of the employee together and it
07:48 - will populate in your list box let's
07:56 - see username and password is correct and
07:59 - you see Mark and his
08:03 - surname let's
08:05 - check so yes Mark and Henry John War see
08:13 - here Peter Parker here Julie Bell
08:19 - here so basically I wanted to show that
08:23 - you can show two columns side by side
08:27 - also in the list box you can show this
08:30 - age also and employee ID also in the
08:35 - same
08:36 - manner so I hope you have learned
08:41 - something new this time please keep
08:43 - watching these video and please wait
08:45 - comment and subscribe and bye for now
