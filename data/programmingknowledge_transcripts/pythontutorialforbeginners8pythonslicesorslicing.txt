00:01 - hello guys welcome to the 8th with your
00:03 - tutorial on Python programming for
00:04 - beginners and in this video I'm going to
00:06 - show you how to use slicing in Python so
00:11 - as the name suggests slicing we can use
00:14 - it for you know separating a slice from
00:17 - a list so for example I have a a list
00:22 - like this and I will call it my list and
00:26 - it contains some integer values from 0
00:29 - to 9
00:30 - and I press enter and it allocates this
00:34 - uh 0 to 9 values to my list and I can
00:38 - just see this by printing the list so it
00:43 - has 0 to n values now suppose I want uh
00:46 - to print only or I want only the values
00:52 - from 4 to 7 how can I get this these
00:55 - values from my list so what what I can
01:00 - do is I can just use my list and then in
01:05 - the square bracket I will start from the
01:10 - value which I want to print so for
01:13 - example four and then I give this um
01:17 - colon and then I give the ending value
01:21 - till whatever value I want to print for
01:25 - example eight and I press enter and it
01:28 - prints from four to just before the
01:33 - value you want to print
01:38 - so you if you remember this index of the
01:41 - list starts from zero right so index uh
01:45 - is zero here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 nine right
01:53 - so to print your
01:57 - values this starting value whenever you
02:00 - write it includes the index of the value
02:05 - you want to print okay so when you write
02:08 - four it will include 0 1 2 3 4 so it
02:13 - will print the value from four it will
02:16 - go to 8 4 5 6 7 8 but it excludes this
02:22 - value and it only prints up to seven
02:26 - okay now suppose uh you want to print
02:31 - uh something like you want to print to
02:34 - the end
02:36 - from 5 to 9 how you can do it you can
02:40 - just do it like my
02:44 - list and you can just write five and
02:50 - because this will print if you write
02:53 - here nine this will print up to eight
02:57 - right because uh whenever we have
02:59 - written eight here it was printing up to
03:02 - seven value right and remember this is
03:05 - the index not the values the these
03:08 - values can be string data type or any
03:11 - other data type right so this these
03:14 - value has nothing to do with these uh
03:16 - index values okay these are the position
03:19 - which you want to print okay so in order
03:22 - to uh print from 5 to 9 you need to add
03:26 - one more to your slide
03:30 - and then it'll print from five to 9 okay
03:33 - so remember if you want to go from some
03:38 - value in the middle to the end just add
03:42 - one to the index here okay so you want
03:46 - to print nine then just print 10
03:49 - here
03:51 - now as I have already told you that uh
03:55 - you not only can have the list
04:00 - or you can not only uh can uh print the
04:05 - index slice the index for the integer
04:09 - array or list but any string list also
04:14 - so for example I
04:17 - have a list like
04:19 - this of character for example
04:24 - characters and then I want to uh print
04:28 - or slide these uh list uh characters
04:32 - right so how you can do it I will just
04:36 - write name my uh List names and then in
04:41 - the square bracket I will just write two
04:45 - to uh three for example I want to print
04:48 - 2 to three it'll just print second value
04:52 - because uh it skips the third value
04:56 - right so 0 1 2 it includes the two and
05:02 - it skips the value which you give here
05:05 - so it will only print to uh C here right
05:10 - for example I want to go to the end I
05:13 - will just write 22
05:18 - 4 it gives list like this now for
05:22 - example uh there is a short way of doing
05:25 - this if you want to
05:27 - print from five to the end what you can
05:32 - do I have this my list here I will copy
05:35 - and paste it here and in the square
05:37 - backet what you can do you can just
05:39 - write five and semicolon and leave the
05:42 - other part of this slice and when you
05:45 - press enter it will just print uh the
05:48 - values from five to 9 to the end of your
05:51 - list okay now for example you do the
05:56 - same thing but you leave the first part
05:59 - and just
06:01 - uh go up to the last part it will print
06:05 - from start to the end okay so for
06:09 - example I want to print once
06:14 - again uh colon or to the fifth value and
06:19 - it will
06:20 - print from the starting to the fifth
06:23 - value
06:25 - okay
06:26 - now this will uh be true for the
06:31 - negative sequence also so I have already
06:33 - told you in the last video that you can
06:36 - um in the list you can have the index
06:39 - negative index from the back word of
06:42 - from the back right so what you can do
06:46 - is uh you can just use this list and you
06:49 - can just say
06:51 - minus 4
06:54 - 2 minus 2 and press enter it will give
06:58 - you the values from so this is min -1 -2
07:04 - and it will skip this value and it will
07:06 - print here and then we have -1 - 2 -- 3
07:12 - -4 and Min - four is this one right so
07:17 - it will print this one it will print
07:19 - this one but it will not print this one
07:22 - because it will skip this right as you
07:25 - have seen in this positive or forward H
07:28 - forward index
07:30 - in a similar way it uh this also works
07:34 - for the blank sequence for example - 6
07:41 - to blank and it will print from 4 to
07:45 - nine okay it will be same for uh if you
07:51 - leave the first part and uh want to
07:54 - print the last part okay
07:57 - now if you want want to print the whole
08:00 - array you just can do it like this but
08:04 - you can also do it like just give a
08:07 - square and give this semicolon here it
08:10 - will also give you the whole
08:12 - array
08:14 - okay
08:17 - now there is one more thing you can do
08:20 - with your list is for example I have my
08:24 - list and I want to print the values
08:29 - for example I want to
08:31 - print
08:33 - 0 3 6 in some sequence okay so you want
08:38 - to skip some values and you want to
08:41 - print only some other values so what you
08:44 - can do here you can just write zero
08:48 - which is a starting index and to 10 so
08:51 - you want to print from Zer to the end
08:56 - and there is a optional value you can
08:59 - can give here and you can give the value
09:03 - here which you want to skip so for
09:05 - example you want to
09:07 - skip 0 1 2 3 here so you want to print 0
09:13 - 3 and six and 9 what you can do here you
09:18 - can skip the value by two okay and when
09:21 - you print here it will print
09:25 - 0 2 4 6 8
09:29 - okay so it prints here and it skips the
09:33 - first value and second value it prints
09:35 - uh skips the third value and fourth
09:38 - value it prints and it just like this
09:41 - right so for example I can once again
09:44 - skip two values at a time instead of two
09:47 - I can write three here and press enter
09:50 - it will give 0 3
09:53 - 69 okay and there is a very short way of
09:58 - doing this
09:59 - is you can just uh write the skip value
10:05 - number of index you want to skip and
10:08 - just leave
10:09 - these things or these uh Parts blank
10:13 - here and it will print the same value
10:16 - okay so this is optional it's not
10:19 - necessary to use this but if you use
10:21 - this it will skip uh you know those
10:25 - values like this okay and you can do it
10:30 - with the negative index also for example
10:33 - you can just leave this and write two
10:38 - here it will print from the backward to
10:44 - the front right so it when you write -2
10:49 - it will start from 9 and then -2 it will
10:54 - print 7 and then five and three and 1
10:58 - okay so if you want to print backwards
11:00 - just give this sequence in negative okay
11:04 - once again you want to print backward
11:08 - skipping third value or three
11:11 - values just do it like this 9 6 3 0 okay
11:19 - so in this way you can use sequence in
11:22 - Python there's more to sequence which
11:24 - will I will discuss in later videos but
11:28 - that's it for sequence in Python I hope
