00:00 - hello everyone welcome to altrex
00:02 - tutorials in this video we are going to
00:05 - take a look at the chart creation
00:07 - process only
00:08 - but in this video we are going to take a
00:10 - look at how can we create batch charts
00:13 - and what is basically the concept of
00:15 - batch charts in ultrix so the batch
00:17 - charts are basically used to group the
00:19 - data as we
00:21 - previously saw in the video that we
00:23 - created a pie chart which provided us
00:25 - the sales percentage and the sales
00:28 - amount on the basis of the category now
00:30 - there are two things as we know in our
00:32 - data set that are present for grouping
00:34 - the data that is category and
00:36 - subcategory
00:37 - so here we have category and then we
00:39 - have subcategory so what i want to do is
00:41 - i want to create separate pie charts for
00:43 - three separate categories
00:46 - firstly in the furniture
00:48 - category chart i want the different sub
00:51 - categories that are part of the
00:53 - furniture and then i want them to show
00:55 - me that what is the total sales that has
00:57 - been done in each of these categories
01:00 - right similarly i want to create it for
01:02 - office supplies category and then for
01:04 - the technology category now instead of
01:06 - creating three charts
01:08 - each for separate categories what i'm
01:10 - gonna do is i'm just going to create a
01:12 - single chart
01:13 - with the help of the bad chart option
01:15 - alteryx would automatically create
01:17 - copies of the same chart for me right so
01:20 - let us see how we are going to do that
01:23 - here what we have is three tools the
01:25 - input tool the
01:27 - chart tool and the browse tool so first
01:30 - of all let's just go to the interactive
01:31 - chart tool click on configure chart
01:33 - option in the configuration panel
01:35 - to open up this interactive chart okay
01:37 - now first of all you need to go to this
01:39 - batch option and by default it would be
01:41 - turn to off so you need to click here to
01:42 - on
01:44 - it would ask you to select the columns
01:46 - through which you are going to group by
01:48 - your options so uh i'm going to group
01:50 - them by category so from the drop down
01:53 - you can just select category if you want
01:55 - another field through which you want to
01:57 - group it by so you can select the second
01:59 - field as well
02:00 - if you want custom title for the batched
02:02 - charts that you can
02:05 - do
02:05 - but i'm not just going to go with it uh
02:08 - the category is written and i'm fine
02:09 - with it okay
02:11 - next go to the layers option click on
02:13 - add layer uh and let's just provide it a
02:16 - name like pie
02:17 - chart
02:22 - okay
02:23 - now select the type to pi
02:26 - for the values what i'm going to do is
02:28 - select the sales value
02:31 - and let's just give it a few seconds
02:34 - till it is going to fetch all the
02:35 - records from the sales and put them over
02:38 - here
02:38 - so this kind of a chart is being
02:40 - generated which is of course very
02:42 - difficult to understand because it is
02:43 - not a correct chart
02:45 - then what i'm going to do in the labels
02:47 - column i am going to select the sub
02:49 - category
02:51 - so now
02:52 - our chart is clean and what we are
02:53 - getting over here is the name of the
02:55 - category which is furniture
02:57 - now in this furniture we have four sub
02:59 - categories the chairs which is
03:01 - represented in the blue color tables
03:03 - represented in the orange color
03:06 - bookcases represented in the green color
03:08 - and furnishings represented in the red
03:09 - color so the total sales of the
03:12 - furniture
03:15 - whatever the total sales value of the
03:16 - furnitures was it has been bifurcated
03:19 - into these four subcategories and
03:22 - it has uh taken the percentages as this
03:25 - so in the furniture most of the sales
03:27 - has been done by chairs that is 43.6
03:30 - percent
03:31 - then if we just click on the second page
03:33 - we would have the office supplies
03:35 - category
03:36 - which combines these sub categories from
03:39 - storage till fasteners
03:41 - now in each of these subcategories how
03:43 - the bifurcation of the sales has been
03:45 - done is being shown on the percentage
03:47 - basis on the third we have the third
03:49 - subcategory which is the technology
03:51 - category having four subcategories again
03:53 - with phones accessories machines and
03:55 - copiers
03:57 - now what customizations we can do over
03:59 - here is
04:00 - by going into this chart option
04:05 - uh and in this font option like if you
04:07 - want to change the font it says
04:08 - everything that you can change like if
04:11 - you want to increase the size so as to
04:13 - get a better look at what is happening
04:14 - over here
04:16 - okay
04:17 - then we have layers option through which
04:19 - you can just uh change the colors like
04:21 - these are the colors that have been
04:23 - taken by default but if you want some
04:25 - other color scheme to be there you want
04:27 - some other colors to be there that also
04:29 - you can change
04:31 - okay
04:32 - like this the divergent scales are there
04:36 - or the sequential scales are there too
04:40 - for a particular color that you can just
04:42 - select okay
04:43 - uh then we have the slice label that is
04:46 - what you want to be shown on the slice
04:47 - label right now the percentage has been
04:49 - shown if you want the value has to be
04:50 - shown as well that means what is the
04:52 - total number of sales that was done
04:55 - that you want to show and the label that
04:57 - means the value of the subcategory that
05:00 - to which subcategory it belongs that
05:02 - also you can select i'm just going with
05:03 - label and percentage not with the value
05:05 - part
05:05 - the order is sorted which means they are
05:07 - all sorted
05:09 - and if you want to show the legend or
05:10 - not this is the legion part you want to
05:12 - show it you want to hide it
05:15 - and then if you just hover over it then
05:17 - we are getting some additional
05:19 - information as well so that is uh
05:21 - controlled through this hover text value
05:23 - so i don't want the percentage to be
05:25 - shown i just want the label and the
05:26 - values to be shown over here because the
05:28 - percentage is already visible over here
05:31 - next we have is the chart option which
05:33 - you can use to set the width of the
05:35 - chart
05:36 - in pixels or in inches
05:38 - uh you can just select the um
05:40 - margins and the padding color etc the
05:44 - background color of the chart everything
05:46 - that you want you can just control from
05:48 - here okay
05:49 - so this is a custom color that i want
05:53 - this is the title
05:55 - if you want to change the title you can
05:57 - change it over here using lattice or
05:59 - using a simple
06:01 - text as well
06:03 - then we have the access option
06:05 - which is not
06:06 - been used over here next we have is the
06:08 - legion if you want to just change the
06:10 - way the legend is being shown that you
06:12 - can do you can just work with its size
06:15 - its color
06:17 - let me just get a black color for the
06:18 - legend
06:20 - for better visibility
06:22 - then we have the box if you want a box
06:25 - to be there on the legend
06:27 - the color of the border for the legion
06:29 - it's going to be red
06:32 - and the background color or if you want
06:34 - a different background color let's just
06:35 - go with
06:37 - this kind of color
06:40 - the orientation you wanted vertically or
06:42 - horizontally like this
06:44 - and the layer order of
06:46 - that
06:47 - what is the order of the layers
06:48 - accordingly you want that or not okay so
06:51 - this is where it is starting from
06:52 - storage all the way to fasteners okay
06:55 - ah then
06:57 - you can just close this
06:59 - and using the browse tool you can just
07:00 - run the browse tool to get a look at the
07:03 - chart
07:09 - so here it is how it is looking you can
07:11 - just adjust it
07:12 - and see that these three charts are
07:14 - lined one after the other
07:16 - now let us just render this chart using
07:18 - the render tool so let's just delete
07:20 - this browse tool for a bit
07:23 - go to the reporting and here we have
07:25 - this render
07:27 - in this render what i'm gonna do is just
07:30 - select the
07:33 - specific output file and save it
07:38 - in the form of
07:39 - png images three images would be created
07:43 - and select
07:44 - bulk charts or batch charts
07:51 - now click on save
07:54 - and if you just go to that location
07:58 - bad charts.png
07:59 - is what we are getting over here
08:04 - okay so let me just
08:06 - take a look at this
08:13 - so uh this is the kind of the image that
08:16 - we are getting over here
08:18 - and if you just zoom in these are being
08:21 - created like this
08:23 - uh in the form of a png image okay now
08:25 - let's see what happens if we just um
08:28 - store it in the form of a pdf document
08:30 - so for saving it i'm just going to
08:33 - select a pdf document
08:37 - here
08:38 - and just select batch charts as the name
08:45 - click on save
08:46 - and click on run to run the workflow so
08:49 - that the actual uh saving process occurs
08:53 - okay now let's just see how it is
08:56 - looking
08:58 - so here it is three pages have been
09:00 - created for the pdf each for a different
09:02 - category along with its legend along
09:04 - with its chart along with its everything
09:07 - so this is how we can use the render
09:09 - button to render the batch charts for us
09:12 - and that's all for this video with this
09:14 - we wrap up the whole uh tutorial course
09:17 - on alteryx as well
09:19 - during this course we learnt about the
09:22 - different tools and their
09:23 - functionalities we also got to
09:26 - see that what all actions we can perform
09:28 - through ultrix
09:30 - and we got to understand that there are
09:31 - a bunch of things that we can do now
09:34 - with more practice we would be able to
09:36 - create
09:37 - a really good charts for us render them
09:39 - and uh use it as the tool it is meant to
09:43 - be
09:44 - so that's all for this video that's all
09:46 - for this course
09:47 - i hope you all learned something new
09:49 - throughout this course i really hope you
09:51 - all enjoyed this journey
09:53 - thanks for watching goodbye
