00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - shell scripting tutorial for beginners
00:03 - in the last video I've shown you how to
00:05 - use the while loops in shell scripting
00:08 - now in this video I want to continue
00:11 - using the while loop and I'm going to
00:14 - show you some more tricks which you can
00:16 - use with value and the first trick is
00:19 - using sleep with the loops right so as
00:24 - you know this code I have written in the
00:27 - last video and this prints the value 1
00:31 - to 10 on terminal right now for some
00:35 - reason I want to give some delay while
00:39 - printing the value and this I can do
00:42 - with sleep command so I can just write
00:44 - sleep here and then whatever number I
00:47 - will give you for example 1 it's going
00:51 - to pause the execution of this loop for
00:55 - this much amount of seconds and once
00:57 - again executing this loop normally right
01:00 - so the sleep command gives a pause or
01:03 - for whatever seconds you want you can
01:07 - write here so if you want to seconds you
01:08 - can write to second or whatever seconds
01:11 - right so let's run the script and let's
01:13 - see what happens now so run the script
01:16 - and you can see the numbers are printing
01:20 - after interval of one second and once
01:24 - the condition is met you can see it
01:27 - comes out of the loop and we can see our
01:30 - normal terminal right now if I don't
01:34 - provide this increment the value of n
01:38 - will always be one so for example I
01:42 - remove this increment of n the value of
01:45 - n will always remain one for example and
01:48 - this loop will execute infinitely so
01:52 - let's run the script and let's see what
01:54 - happens now so you can see it's printing
01:57 - 1 1 1 1 and this condition is always
02:02 - true so this script will run always
02:06 - until you stop executing it right and
02:10 - how to terminate this process
02:13 - is running using this shell script you
02:16 - can just press control-c to come off of
02:20 - this script so ctrl C and I'm out of
02:23 - this script okay
02:25 - so if you want the continuous loop you
02:28 - give a condition such that it's always
02:31 - true right but always remember that you
02:37 - know whatever is the logic of your code
02:39 - if you do not provide this sleep this
02:44 - loop will work infinitely and it will
02:46 - run so fast that it may you know slow
02:51 - your computer even sometimes right so
02:54 - this is the first trick now the second
02:57 - trick I want to show here is how we can
03:02 - open some terminals so for example I
03:05 - want to open three terminals so I will
03:08 - just write instead of ten three here and
03:11 - I want to open a terminal using my bash
03:15 - script right so what I can do here is
03:18 - depending upon the what kind of terminal
03:22 - available on your operating system you
03:25 - can open those terminal so on my open
03:30 - two operating system I have X term for
03:33 - example and genome terminal which is
03:35 - this terminal this is the genome
03:38 - terminal and X term is also available on
03:41 - my system so let's use the genome
03:44 - terminal command to open those terminal
03:47 - first so I will just use genome -
03:50 - terminal and just give this and single
03:53 - after this right and let me clear the
03:57 - terminal first of all and let me choose
04:00 - run the script and you will see three
04:03 - more terminals are open so there is the
04:05 - first I will close this the second once
04:08 - again close this and the third I will
04:10 - close this right so using this genome
04:14 - terminal command you can open the normal
04:17 - tunnel like this and X term is available
04:21 - also on my
04:23 - Ubuntu operating system so instead of
04:25 - genome I can just write X term and then
04:31 - once again I will run the script and you
04:34 - can see these terminals are open three
04:37 - terminals right so I can close them once
04:40 - again so these are the two traits I
04:44 - wanted to show you in this video and in
04:47 - the next video we will see how we can
04:49 - read a file using while loop so stay
04:53 - tuned and please recommend subscribe and
04:55 - bye for now
