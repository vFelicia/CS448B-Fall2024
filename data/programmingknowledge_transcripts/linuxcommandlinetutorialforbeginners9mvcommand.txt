00:00 - I know guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Linux command line to troll for
00:04 - beginners and in this video we will see
00:06 - how we can use MV command in Linux so
00:10 - let's get started I will just press ctrl
00:12 - alt T to open my terminal and you can
00:15 - see on my desktop I have a directory and
00:17 - a file right so first of all I will
00:21 - browse to my directory using CD command
00:24 - and press enter and I can LS here and I
00:28 - can see I have directory 1 and file 1
00:31 - now to use MB c'mon we have this option
00:36 - so you use MV command with some options
00:40 - and then you have a source and then a
00:46 - destination
00:47 - ok so first you use MV as a command then
00:53 - you can use options like - V or - I or -
00:59 - F then comes your source file it can be
01:02 - one or many files or directories and
01:06 - then comes the destination file or
01:10 - directory ok so let's see how we can use
01:14 - it so first of all I have this file 1
01:17 - and I want to use MV command to change
01:21 - the name of this file for example so I
01:25 - will just use MV and then the name of
01:27 - the file and then I will just give some
01:31 - other name to the file for example file
01:34 - 2 dot txt ok and press enter and you
01:40 - will see here this file becomes file -
01:44 - ok
01:44 - and the content of the file will remain
01:47 - the same so I can use cat cat command -
01:50 - you know display the content of the file
01:54 - so just use cat and I have this you know
01:58 - content in my file 1 which is also
02:00 - transferred to the file 2 now for
02:03 - example I want to create a new file and
02:06 - move the content of file 2 to file you
02:09 - know 3 for example
02:11 - and I want to just you know transfer all
02:15 - the content of file to to file three so
02:17 - I can just use MV and then file to which
02:21 - is a source and then I can just write
02:24 - file three dot txt here and press enter
02:28 - and you will observe here that file 2 is
02:33 - gone now and file 3 is created and the
02:37 - content of the file we can check is the
02:40 - same as file 2 because it has changed
02:42 - the name of the file and moved the
02:46 - content of the file to file 3 so if the
02:49 - file doesn't really exist then it's
02:52 - going to create the file the simple you
02:55 - know formula of this now for example I
02:58 - want to move for this file 3 to direct G
03:01 - 1 I can just use MV and then on the file
03:05 - name and then my directory name right
03:09 - now for example I will just open this
03:12 - directory and you can see here file 2 is
03:16 - already there and I'm going to transfer
03:18 - file 3 also there right so I will just
03:22 - press Enter MV and the file name and the
03:26 - destination name and then I will LS
03:28 - directory 1 and let's see the content of
03:31 - it and you can see now it has file - and
03:34 - file 3 both ok so in this way you can
03:38 - transfer the file or move the file to
03:42 - our directory using the move command ok
03:46 - now for example I will create a new file
03:51 - for example file 3 once again so I will
03:55 - just say file 3 dot txt and this is a
04:00 - new file I want to create on the desktop
04:03 - and that content for example will be
04:06 - some random text here ok and I will just
04:10 - press control D to end the file so this
04:13 - is file 3 and I want to move this file
04:16 - to directory 1 which already have file 3
04:19 - so let's see what happens now this file
04:23 - 3 new file contains random
04:25 - next and the old file which is in the
04:28 - directory tree contains this kind of
04:31 - text I can show you this kind of text
04:33 - right so now what I want is I want to
04:37 - transfer this file three to the
04:40 - directory one so I can just use MV and
04:44 - then I can use the name of the file and
04:46 - once again what I have done is I've
04:50 - given the destination with name which is
04:52 - directory one right now let me open the
04:57 - directory one and we will see what
04:59 - happens and the result of it so I will
05:04 - just press ENTER and it will move the
05:06 - content of file three which is on the
05:10 - desktop to the directory one and what
05:13 - happens here is it will overwrite so the
05:16 - file three which was there on the
05:18 - desktop is you know overwritten and this
05:22 - file in the directory one is overwritten
05:25 - by the desktop file three okay so I can
05:28 - just cat there one file three for
05:33 - example and the content will be the
05:35 - random content which we have given which
05:38 - is the new file three which we have
05:40 - created right so if you want to you know
05:44 - move the file which already exists then
05:49 - it will overwrite the file okay so for
05:53 - example once again let's see an example
05:56 - but this time what we are going to do is
05:59 - we are going to you know do it with the
06:03 - some command so first of all I will
06:06 - create once again file three and this
06:09 - time I will once again give some random
06:12 - text here and press control D and this
06:16 - time instead of using this command like
06:20 - this I will use a flag I and flag I or
06:25 - minus I stands for interactive mode so
06:28 - it will ask you if you want to overwrite
06:31 - the file which was already present in
06:33 - the directory one with the same name so
06:36 - I'm going to just
06:37 - press ENTER and you can see it will ask
06:40 - me if I want to overwrite and when I
06:42 - press Y and press Enter is going to
06:45 - overwrite the file or if I have press N
06:48 - and press Enter
06:50 - it's not going to overwrite the file
06:53 - which was already there in directory 1
06:56 - right so I will press N and it will not
06:58 - overwrite ok let me clear the terminal
07:02 - now let's create our directory okay so
07:07 - what I'm going to do is I will just use
07:10 - mkdir command which we have learned in
07:13 - the previous video and I will create a
07:16 - directory - for example oops the command
07:20 - was wrong it was mkdir not Mak dir ok
07:26 - I was going to create this directory -
07:29 - right now for example I want to transfer
07:36 - the directory inside the directory - so
07:39 - for example I want to transfer the
07:41 - directory one inside directory - I can
07:44 - use the Move command so I can just write
07:47 - directory 1 and V directory one which is
07:49 - my source and I want to move it inside
07:52 - directory - so I can just write the
07:55 - destination name which is directly - and
07:57 - by the way type 2 2 is right now empty
08:00 - you can see there is no content inside
08:03 - this and when I press this command and
08:06 - press Enter is going to move directly
08:10 - one inside directly - so we can just LS
08:13 - inside the directory - and you can see
08:17 - directory 1 is there and inside directly
08:20 - 1 there was some file right so I can
08:24 - just write directly 1 directly - and
08:28 - inside that I have directly 1 and I can
08:30 - Alice the you know files inside the
08:34 - directory 1 like this and you can see
08:36 - the content is also moved with the
08:39 - directory ok so you can you know move
08:43 - the directory and its content using MV
08:46 - command also now let's see what happens
08:49 - the directory which we you know want to
08:53 - move this directory to doesn't really
08:55 - exist
08:56 - right so I will just use MV and I will
08:59 - just write directed to and I will I want
09:02 - to create a new directory and move the
09:04 - content to this directory tree right so
09:08 - when you do this press enter the name of
09:12 - the directory is changed and content is
09:15 - moved to this directory tree and the
09:18 - directory to is you know disappearing
09:21 - right so if the directory doesn't exist
09:25 - it's going to create a directory and
09:28 - then move the content of the directory
09:31 - inside directory 3 so it will not move
09:35 - the directly true inside directory tree
09:37 - but the content of directory to inside
09:39 - directory tree so you can see there is
09:41 - no directory - inside directory tree
09:44 - it's going to create the directory and
09:47 - you can say it's like renaming the
09:50 - directory if the directory doesn't
09:52 - really exist and if the directory
09:53 - already exists then it's going to
09:56 - transfer directly to inside directory 3
09:59 - ok so I hope you understood the this
10:02 - basic concept which I want to convey
10:06 - here right now there are many command
10:10 - which we are you know can use for
10:13 - example mb - me for verbose and for
10:18 - example once again i want to transfer
10:21 - the file 3 to the directory so i will
10:25 - just give the directory name and press
10:27 - enter and gives you you know though you
10:31 - know explanation what this command has
10:34 - done so it has moved this file 3 to the
10:38 - directory 3 right and it has overwritten
10:41 - this thing right and there are many
10:43 - commands and this command you can you
10:47 - know know by using this command which
10:50 - say which is man and then MV command ok
10:55 - so just write man and mb and it's going
10:59 - to key
11:00 - view the whole you know description of
11:03 - using MV command right so you can use -
11:07 - be with MV command or - F with FB
11:10 - command I we have already seen and these
11:15 - are the description of all the flags and
11:18 - you know options you have with MV
11:21 - command
11:22 - so just use this and you know read these
11:26 - descriptions and you will be good to go
11:28 - so I hope you have enjoyed this video
11:30 - please rate comment subscribe and bye
11:32 - for now
