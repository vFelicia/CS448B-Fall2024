00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:01 - you how you can set the Java home so for
00:05 - that what we need to do we need to first
00:08 - of all find out where Java is installed
00:11 - on our Mac operating system so for that
00:14 - we are going to open the terminal so
00:16 - just click on this Spotlight icon and
00:19 - then search for terminal and then open
00:23 - the terminal from here so generally once
00:25 - you install Java jdk its location is
00:28 - for/ USR for slash
00:33 - libexec slash Java home so Java uncore
00:37 - home and then you need to give hyphen
00:41 - and then capital V and it's going to
00:43 - give you the version of java which you
00:46 - have installed so this is the version
00:49 - which we have installed which is Java 20
00:53 - 1.0.1 once we know the version of uh
00:56 - Java so now in The Next Step what what
01:00 - we need to do is we need to set or
01:02 - export the path of java home in our bash
01:08 - RC file or zshrc file now if you are
01:12 - using the newer version of MEC operating
01:15 - system most propably by default your Mac
01:18 - terminal is using zsh so we are going to
01:21 - set the Java home in the zshrc file now
01:27 - this zshrc file is located
01:30 - in your home folder so when you do PWD
01:36 - and when you open the terminal for the
01:38 - first time this is the home folder of
01:41 - your Mac operating system or for your
01:44 - particular user right and this zshrc is
01:49 - located in this directory so how to uh
01:53 - know that you can do LS space hyphen Al
01:59 - and then and press enter and you will be
02:02 - able to see this kind of file which says
02:05 - do zshrc now if this file is not present
02:11 - you don't need to worry about it we will
02:13 - create a new zshrc file so if this file
02:17 - is present we will add our location to
02:20 - it if it's not present we will first
02:23 - create this file and then we are going
02:26 - to add our export now you can use any
02:29 - edit to uh edit or create this file if
02:33 - this zshrc file is not there you can uh
02:37 - use this touch command and then write
02:40 - Dot
02:41 - zshrc and then press enter and it's
02:44 - going to create your do zshrc file in my
02:49 - case it's already present so I'm not
02:51 - going to give this command the next
02:53 - command is using a text editor you need
02:56 - to open this file you can use Nano to
02:58 - open the dot that s file or if you are
03:02 - the fan of text editor then you can use
03:05 - open also so just write open and then
03:08 - write dot
03:11 - zshrc which is the name of this file and
03:15 - then press enter which is going to open
03:18 - this zsh file using the text editor let
03:22 - me make this uh text a little bit bigger
03:25 - so you can see
03:26 - here so I already have one export here
03:29 - in your case if you have created this
03:32 - file for the first time you will not see
03:34 - any export here it will be blank what
03:37 - you need to do here is you need to copy
03:40 - and paste these two lines here I'm going
03:43 - to paste these two lines in the
03:45 - description of this video also so you
03:48 - can directly copy them and paste it into
03:51 - your terminal so the first command is
03:53 - export Java unor home is equal to dollar
03:57 - and then this is the path which we have
03:59 - uh seen in the terminal so we have used
04:04 - this path right user SL Li exact for/
04:09 - Java home space hyphen version and we
04:13 - got this version in my case right
04:17 - 2.0.1 so here we have given the same
04:20 - path hyphen version and instead of this
04:24 - version you need to give the version
04:27 - which you see after giving this command
04:31 - so in my case the version is
04:34 - 2.0.1 so I'm going to replace this
04:38 - version with
04:40 - 2.0.1 so let me just write
04:44 - 2.0.1 here and then in the next line you
04:48 - need to uh give this command which is
04:51 - export space path is equal to Dollar
04:55 - Java home/ bin colon dollar path right
04:59 - right so these two lines you need to
05:01 - copy and paste and don't forget to
05:04 - change the version with the version
05:06 - which you have once you are done you can
05:10 - save this file so I'm going to just uh
05:13 - click on the file option and then click
05:16 - on Save which is going to save this shrc
05:20 - file and then I'm going to close this
05:23 - once this is closed you can verify that
05:27 - your changes are saved by just
05:30 - giving the same command once again is
05:32 - openspace do zshrc and I can see that my
05:37 - changes are already there so I know that
05:42 - my changes are saved right once your
05:45 - changes are saved the next command you
05:48 - need to write here is this one so let me
05:52 - clear the terminal because uh it's full
05:56 - so after uh saving your export you just
05:59 - need to give this command which is
06:02 - source and then give the name of your
06:05 - file which is do Z
06:08 - SRC and then press enter if you don't
06:11 - give this command then do zshrc will not
06:14 - load in the current terminal so if you
06:18 - don't give this command just close your
06:20 - terminal and then reopen the terminal
06:23 - once again okay so you can also do this
06:27 - so I'm going to just close this terminal
06:29 - and then quit from this terminal and
06:32 - then once again open the
06:35 - terminal and once the terminal is open I
06:39 - can check the Java home is set or Not by
06:43 - giving Echo command so I'm going to just
06:45 - give echo dollar Java uncore home and
06:50 - then press enter and it's going to give
06:52 - you the location of java home in my case
06:56 - it's uh Library SL Java / Java virtual
07:00 - machine SL jdk 21. jdk contents slome
07:06 - okay so if you have followed all the
07:08 - step which I have shown you you will see
07:10 - this kind of
07:12 - output now once uh Java home is set and
07:17 - Java is installed we can also check the
07:19 - version of java so you can give this
07:21 - command which is Java space
07:25 - hyphen version and then press enter and
07:28 - it's going to give give you the version
07:30 - of java which is 21.0 point1 in my
07:34 - case so Java is now successfully
07:37 - installed on my Mac operating system
