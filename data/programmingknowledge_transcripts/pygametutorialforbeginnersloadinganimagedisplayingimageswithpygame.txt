00:00 - hey everyone this video is going to be
00:03 - about image handling in pi game we would
00:05 - load an image see it scrolling across
00:08 - the screen rotate it and scale it and
00:10 - also we would talk about the transform
00:12 - module which is readily used with images
00:14 - in pyking so let's start with normal
00:17 - image loading i have initialized pygame
00:20 - declared the screen and in the fourth
00:22 - line i have used the load function from
00:24 - image module by pygame to load the image
00:27 - it takes one argument that is the name
00:29 - of the file or path let's keep it simple
00:32 - for now just use the file name this is
00:34 - the image we would work with
00:37 - then is our normal game loop i have
00:39 - colored the screen white with fill used
00:42 - blit to get the image at the provided
00:44 - coordinates we can also use direct
00:46 - object we would do that in a minute and
00:49 - then there's our regular events loop so
00:51 - let's run this code and see if the image
00:53 - is loaded on the screen
00:54 - so yeah it is up and running but what if
00:57 - i needed the image at the center of the
00:59 - screen we would just repeat what we did
01:02 - last time to bring this text at the
01:03 - center
01:05 - there we have the font object here we
01:06 - have the image object we would get it on
01:09 - the rectangle by declaring a direct
01:12 - object and assign its center the center
01:14 - coordinates of the screen
01:16 - let's run this now see if our image is
01:18 - at the center
01:24 - so yeah we have our image at the center
01:27 - of the screen cool
01:29 - what if i want to move this image across
01:31 - the screen
01:32 - for that we would repeat exactly what we
01:35 - did for scrolling the text
01:37 - you can see here i have taken the speed
01:39 - determining i variable put up a
01:41 - condition given a weight of 5
01:43 - milliseconds
01:45 - incremented i by 80
01:47 - it's exactly the same
01:49 - it's just that last time we had text
01:51 - object now we have image object
01:54 - so let's see how it moves
01:58 - here you can see the picture moving
02:01 - across the x-axis you can also try it
02:04 - moving across
02:05 - the extreme left you can try moving it
02:09 - in the bottom along the bottom
02:12 - and
02:13 - along the right side too
02:15 - just like we did for the text
02:21 - now let's try to rotate a still picture
02:24 - for this we would use the transform
02:26 - module as you can see i have loaded the
02:28 - image
02:29 - in the seventh line
02:32 - then i have used rotate function by
02:34 - transform
02:35 - it takes two arguments the object you
02:38 - want to rotate and the angle by which
02:39 - you want to rotate the positive angles
02:42 - rotate anti-clockwise and please note
02:44 - the angles are in degrees
02:47 - and after that we have our simple game
02:49 - loop with no new things you will fill a
02:52 - color get the image object on the given
02:54 - position then run the events loop so
02:57 - without wasting any time let's run it
02:59 - and see if the image is rotated
03:02 - yeah we have our image rotated
03:04 - clockwise by 90 degrees since i gave an
03:07 - argument of minus 90. cool
03:13 - now let's try to scale the same image
03:15 - for that we would use the scale function
03:17 - by transform scaling is just resizing
03:20 - the surface to a new size
03:22 - the second argument here
03:24 - is of the new size that you want for the
03:27 - image
03:28 - and then it's our normal game loop so
03:30 - let's run it and see if we have new
03:32 - sized image
03:34 - yes we do have a new sized image the
03:37 - original image squeezes into the size we
03:40 - have provided that is 200 by 200.
03:46 - in the last two programs we use
03:48 - transform module this module has some
03:51 - more functionalities let's look at them
03:53 - so i have loaded an image
03:56 - it's the same program as of the first
03:58 - one
03:59 - and use the flip function now by
04:01 - transform so it takes in three arguments
04:04 - the surface you want to flip and the
04:07 - axis about which you want to flip
04:09 - i have flipped it about x-axis as the
04:11 - second argument is true and the third
04:13 - one is false
04:16 - if i run it my picture is flipped about
04:18 - x-axis you can do this for y-axis as
04:21 - well then you can even set both the of
04:24 - the arguments as true
04:26 - then the image would be flipped about
04:28 - both the axis
04:32 - next up we have the auto zoom which is a
04:34 - combination of rotation and zooming in
04:37 - the image
04:39 - of course the function itself the name
04:41 - of the function itself explains it
04:43 - it takes three arguments as well the
04:46 - surface you want to work with then the
04:48 - angle of rotation
04:49 - and then the zoom in factor which takes
04:51 - a flow data type so you can given
04:54 - arguments like 1.5 2.5 and 2.25 etc
04:59 - even given a float data type
05:02 - it is not just confined to integers
05:04 - fine let's run it and see what we get
05:08 - so we have our picture zoomed in
05:10 - by 1.5 and it is even rotated by 90
05:14 - degrees you can even rotate it by 180
05:16 - degrees not a problem
05:18 - or by 360 then you'd get the same image
05:21 - again
05:26 - now if you want a picture double the
05:28 - original size you can use the scale 2x
05:30 - function
05:33 - if you're using this function you do not
05:35 - need to mention
05:36 - the zoom in factor it's automatically
05:39 - two
05:40 - we get a picture which is double the
05:41 - size of its original size
05:44 - so let's run it and see if we have what
05:46 - we are expecting
05:49 - so yeah the image is double the size of
05:52 - its original one
05:54 - transform also has this average color
05:56 - function which gives you the average
05:58 - color of the mentioned surface
06:01 - now if i print this
06:03 - for the current image it comes out to be
06:05 - this color
06:06 - there's a color
06:08 - this is an rgb
06:11 - format
06:12 - so yeah this is one color that we get
06:16 - it is the average color of the given
06:18 - image
06:19 - so in this video we work with the image
06:21 - and transfer module next time we would
06:23 - work with the music module in buy game
06:26 - hope this video helped you thank you
