00:00 - hello guys welcome once again in this
00:02 - video I'm going to show you how to use
00:04 - chart control with your Visual Basic
00:07 - Windows Form
00:08 - application so let's get started I have
00:11 - this blank project made and in here I
00:14 - will take a button to load a chart and I
00:17 - will take a chart control obviously to
00:21 - load my charts so I will search for the
00:24 - chart and you will find this chart
00:26 - control in this data tab so just drag
00:30 - and drop this chart
00:32 - control and resize it according to your
00:37 - requirements and I will change the name
00:41 - or text of this button as
00:45 - load
00:46 - chart and before writing any quote for
00:50 - our application I want to show some of
00:53 - the properties of these charts and how
00:56 - you can customize these
00:58 - charts so the first
01:00 - property I want to show you is the cies
01:03 - so just select your chart and go to the
01:06 - property called series here which is
01:09 - this so just click this button near
01:13 - series collection and in here you can
01:16 - customize your Series so first of all by
01:20 - default your series name is uh series 1
01:23 - so I change
01:25 - it as something else for example I want
01:28 - to show name versus Age series so I to
01:31 - name my series as
01:35 - age and I can customize
01:39 - my chart by changing the background
01:43 - image if you want you can just choose
01:45 - any image into your
01:48 - uh into your background as your
01:51 - background image of your
01:53 - series and you can also change the
01:56 - Border
01:57 - color for example red you can also
02:01 - change the foreground color for example
02:04 - I'm going to choose this green color and
02:07 - immediately when you choose it you will
02:09 - be able to see this effect here green
02:12 - color and the broader are red right and
02:17 - you
02:18 - have the most important property called
02:22 - chart type so this defines what kind of
02:25 - chart you want to make it's not
02:27 - restricted to the bar chart you can make
02:31 - uh different type of chart using this
02:34 - chart control so just click this chart
02:36 - control and just click
02:38 - this button here and you can choose
02:43 - here py chart point chart and other line
02:47 - chart and whatever you want to
02:50 - use so for this video I'm going to stick
02:55 - to the column chart which is most basic
02:58 - and I will click okay okay and you can
03:01 - also change the property of this chart
03:03 - also for example you want to change the
03:06 - background color of this chart so go to
03:08 - the
03:09 - property of back color by default it's
03:12 - white you can choose any color for
03:15 - example this dark gray and you can see
03:19 - its property is changed now some code so
03:22 - double click this button and in here
03:26 - right first of all just see the name of
03:30 - your chart which is chart one right so
03:32 - just remember this and here
03:35 - write
03:37 - me dot chart one which is the name of
03:40 - your chart dot
03:45 - series and in here we will pass the name
03:48 - of the series which is age right so just
03:52 - write here age this is the name of the
03:54 - series and then write dot points
04:00 - do add
04:02 - XY and in here we will pass two argument
04:05 - one is the xais and other is the y axis
04:09 - first argument it will take is the xaxis
04:12 - value so first argument is the name as
04:16 - xais so I will write name versus his age
04:21 - so for example 33 and I will press enter
04:27 - and in this is the first
04:30 - bar of your bar data of your chart right
04:34 - for example I want to show multiple bars
04:37 - I will just copy and paste
04:41 - it four times for example and I will
04:44 - change the
04:48 - name John and AG is
04:53 - 15 and the age is
04:58 - 20
05:00 - and the age is for example 40 and now
05:05 - when I run the
05:07 - program and when I click this button
05:10 - it'll load the chart which is name
05:14 - versus age so our first age was for the
05:18 - mark is 33 you can see here it's 33 for
05:22 - John it's 50 so for John the age is 50
05:26 - in this way it will show the chart now
05:29 - for examp example you want to show
05:30 - multiple bars with the same
05:34 - xais so for example I want to show the
05:38 - marks age plus I want to show the score
05:43 - or marks coded by Mark in some
05:46 - examination so how how can I show
05:48 - multiple bars with the same name so
05:52 - let's see how can we you add it just
05:56 - select your chart once again and go go
05:59 - to the property series once again
06:03 - here and in here we just need to add one
06:06 - more series so I will just click this
06:08 - add button and I will change the name of
06:11 - the series
06:13 - as marks this time and this time I'm
06:18 - going to leave all these uh things all
06:23 - these properties as default so basically
06:26 - you
06:27 - know or you need need to play with these
06:30 - property in order to customize your
06:33 - chart right so I will click okay and I
06:36 - will just click this button once
06:40 - again and I will copy this
06:43 - code and paste it below and this series
06:47 - name is marks right so I will write
06:50 - Marks here and the age of marks for
06:53 - example he is 70 year old
06:57 - guy or maybe he is 40 year old no his
07:03 - score we are giving the score right so
07:06 - he scored n 90 out of 100 marks right
07:11 - and for the
07:14 - other other
07:17 - persons we just copy and paste the
07:22 - data and
07:25 - copy and paste right and and these are
07:30 - the marks so second series will be Mark
07:35 - marks and the age or the scores right so
07:40 - second person scores 703d
07:44 - scores 40 and fourth
07:48 - scores 66 for
07:50 - example and now we will run the
07:54 - program and when I click this load chart
07:57 - button it shows me
07:59 - the name versus age chart plus it shows
08:02 - me the name versus marks chart and it
08:06 - shows the name of the series here also
08:09 - age and marks right so in in this way
08:12 - you can make different kind of chart
08:16 - with the help of this Microsoft chart
08:19 - control I hope you have enjoyed this
