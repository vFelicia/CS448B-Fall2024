00:00 - hello guys welcome to the first video on
00:02 - HTML tutorial for beginners using html5
00:07 - now the first question you may ask
00:10 - yourself is what is HTML now HTML which
00:16 - stands for hypertext markup language is
00:19 - the language for specifying the static
00:22 - content of web pages now what does this
00:27 - mean for example whenever you open any
00:30 - web site for example I'm using Firefox
00:33 - browser and this is the default page and
00:36 - any web page which you see on web
00:41 - browser has a code behind it and it's
00:46 - written in HTML along with some other
00:49 - languages like JavaScript PHP or some
00:53 - styling sheets like CSS and other stuff
00:57 - but the static content which you see for
01:01 - example some paragraph or some heading
01:04 - or some other stuff like tables and
01:08 - links it's all HTML now whenever you
01:13 - open your web page any web page you just
01:15 - right click on it and just click on view
01:20 - page source it's available on any other
01:23 - browser like Chrome or Safari you just
01:25 - right click and just click on view on
01:29 - source and here you will see all the
01:33 - HTML code which is responsible for this
01:37 - page right so this is all written is
01:42 - HTML now what is the meaning of static
01:46 - there are two kind of web pages one is
01:50 - dynamic web page and other is static web
01:55 - page so static web page is a page in
01:59 - which you can only see the content for
02:04 - example you can see tables paragraphs or
02:07 - some article headings and other stuff
02:10 - and a dynamic page
02:13 - is a page in which you can interact with
02:16 - the web page for example you can submit
02:18 - your username and password to your gmail
02:23 - account or Facebook account and then it
02:26 - authenticates this username and password
02:28 - with the server-side scripting and then
02:33 - you get your login sxs right so this
02:38 - kind of pages are called
02:40 - dynamic pages okay but all the you know
02:45 - web pages which you see on your browser
02:48 - have this kind of code and the static
02:51 - content of all the pages are due to this
02:56 - HTML now what is the history of this
03:01 - HTML language right so in the year 1991
03:07 - the first version of HTML came which was
03:11 - really basic and it doesn't include any
03:13 - multimedia like video or audio or any
03:17 - other content and then it was you know

06:21 - NetBeans Visual Studio also supports
06:24 - HTML and other advanced i des IDE stands
06:29 - for integrated development environment
06:31 - which can which you can use to develop
06:35 - HTML pages now second thing you need
06:40 - to test your web pages is the web
06:44 - browser it can be any web browser for
06:47 - example Firefox Internet Explorer Chrome
06:51 - or Safari okay so we can test on any web
06:56 - browser right now let's see how we can
07:00 - create a simple HTML web page okay so
07:04 - I'm not going to explain the content
07:06 - which I'm going to use inside the HTML
07:08 - page but we are going to create how we
07:12 - can create our HTML page so just go to
07:15 - your any folder in which you want to
07:19 - create this file right click on it and
07:21 - then new and click text file and in here

09:12 - your browser right so just be ready to
09:17 - develop our own HTML web pages I will
09:20 - see you in the next video so stay tuned
