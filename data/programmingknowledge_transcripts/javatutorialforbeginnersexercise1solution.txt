00:00 - in this video we will be talking about
00:02 - the solution of the exercise one
00:06 - okay that I given to you in those
00:08 - previous videos
00:10 - okay so in this video I'll be giving you
00:13 - the solution of the problem number one
00:15 - two and three and in the next video I'll
00:19 - be talking about the solution for the
00:20 - fourth and fifth because if I make all
00:23 - those five solution in one video the
00:24 - video will get lengthy and you guys will
00:27 - not watch all these videos Okay so let's
00:29 - just get started so what is the first
00:32 - first problem statement says write a
00:34 - Java program to convert the temperature
00:36 - from Fahrenheit to the Celsius degree
00:39 - okay
00:40 - so let me get into my IDE
00:45 - right click here
00:47 - create a Java class
00:51 - and I'll be giving
00:53 - class name as the cell CS
00:57 - convert
01:01 - okay
01:03 - let me rename this because class name
01:06 - should always start with capital let
01:10 - okay
01:12 - so inside this let me create my main
01:15 - method
01:17 - okay let me just
01:20 - increase the font size so that it will
01:22 - visible to you guys also
01:25 - okay
01:27 - so first thing first
01:30 - to solve this problem you guys first
01:33 - know the formula of the conversion from
01:36 - Fahrenheit to the Celsius so formula is
01:38 - like this let's suppose C is the
01:42 - variable which holds this actual Celsius
01:45 - and which is equals to the
01:49 - 5
01:50 - into
01:52 - f means the Fahrenheit temperature
01:54 - minus 32
01:58 - then it's divided by 9.
02:01 - okay so this is our conversion formula
02:04 - to convert the temperature from
02:05 - Fahrenheit to Celsius okay
02:07 - so here so first I will import some
02:11 - classes
02:13 - from a package name
02:15 - java.util
02:18 - so to import it this you have to write
02:21 - import
02:22 - Java Dot util
02:26 - dot scanner
02:29 - so I know at this point you guys didn't
02:32 - know what is this import Java util.star
02:35 - bear with me I will tell you or each and
02:38 - everything in this code itself okay so
02:43 - at first I will create one
02:46 - object of that scanner class let me
02:48 - create like import let me call it as
02:52 - input because we are receiving the input
02:55 - from the user okay
02:57 - scanner and then system dot in
03:03 - so first let me explain you what I did
03:06 - here okay so in the first line import
03:09 - java.ital.scanner I have imported the
03:11 - scanner class from the util package of
03:14 - the okay main Java package util package
03:16 - is there and scanner class is there
03:18 - inside the util package okay what does
03:20 - the scanner class scanner class do
03:22 - scanner will just gives get the input
03:26 - from the user and give it to the program
03:28 - okay so to use that scanner class you
03:31 - have to create one object of that class
03:32 - okay so here I have declared the car
03:36 - scanner and input input is the object
03:39 - name for that scanner class and I have
03:42 - initialized that
03:43 - object here okay
03:45 - simply and system dot in represent you
03:47 - have to get the input from the system
03:50 - that means user will get type those
03:52 - input and hit enter and that input will
03:54 - pass to the program okay
03:56 - so next I will just print
04:00 - okay let me print so first we have to
04:04 - receive that Fahrenheit temperature from
04:06 - the user okay so I will just try it
04:09 - input uh
04:14 - degree in
04:17 - fah fa is just a short form for the
04:20 - fahrenheit that I have given okay
04:23 - so this line will get printed on the
04:26 - screen so next at this point line number
04:28 - eight we have to receive the input from
04:30 - the user that is the Fahrenheit
04:31 - temperature okay for that I will be
04:34 - using double data type okay so and I
04:37 - hope you know the double data type that
04:38 - I have discussed in the data type video
04:40 - and I will call that
04:43 - I will create a variable name fah okay
04:47 - and at the next line I have assign it
04:50 - the value add input Dot
04:53 - next
04:56 - double okay
05:00 - okay so in line number eight we have
05:02 - create one fah variable and assign it
05:04 - the value that the input dot next Double
05:07 - and what next Double method will do just
05:10 - simply it will take the input from the
05:12 - user that that is in the form of double
05:14 - and store it inside the variable FH that
05:17 - is the Fahrenheit cell Fahrenheit
05:19 - temperature that we will be receiving
05:21 - from the user okay
05:22 - so next we have to require we have
05:26 - required another variable which will
05:29 - store our Celsius temperature okay
05:33 - Celsius temperature
05:35 - okay and the formula that I have given
05:38 - here in the line number five you have
05:40 - you just you just have to create or
05:43 - just write it down here like this
05:46 - same here
05:48 - 5
05:50 - okay so 5 into
05:53 - again when brackets are there and the f
05:57 - means the fahrenheit so we have received
05:59 - that Fahrenheit in this variable okay so
06:02 - I will write fah
06:06 - minus 32.0
06:10 - that is our formula you can see in the
06:12 - line number five also and after those
06:15 - two circular bracket I will divide it
06:18 - the result of it by 9.0 okay and at the
06:23 - end I'll add the semicolon
06:25 - okay so at this point of our code we
06:29 - have taken the input from the user that
06:30 - is in the fahrenheit and then we have
06:32 - stored inside the fah and when and we
06:34 - have created the Celsius variable
06:36 - wherein we'll be converting those
06:38 - Fahrenheit temperature to the Celsius
06:39 - and storing in the Celsius variable okay
06:42 - so at last I have to just print that
06:46 - Celsius variable to the user okay
06:49 - so for the printing
06:51 - first let me get that Fahrenheit
06:54 - temperature
06:55 - and I will be concatenating it with this
06:59 - okay so let let me first type it out
07:02 - then I will tell you what is
07:04 - concatenation in Java
07:07 - okay
07:08 - so here
07:10 - I will write
07:13 - degree
07:15 - FH stands for Fahrenheit
07:20 - is
07:23 - equal to
07:27 - okay
07:29 - okay
07:30 - it's equal to Celsius I guess yes
07:34 - Celsius
07:36 - then again one
07:39 - okay Celsius
07:42 - in Celsius
07:45 - let me just
07:48 - decrease the font size so that you can
07:50 - see in one window
07:52 - Celsius okay
07:54 - so what in this line is we'll be doing
07:56 - is first it will be printing fah value
07:59 - FH value that user will give us give us
08:01 - one space is there to concatenate those
08:04 - two strings we use the string
08:08 - concatenation which is plus where plus
08:10 - operator is there you can just write the
08:12 - plus and the one blank space is there
08:15 - right in this case let me just explain
08:18 - you
08:19 - when I run the code okay I will explain
08:22 - you okay
08:23 - so I guess this is what we have to
08:26 - achieve in this code let me just click
08:28 - on run
08:35 - so here it it was saying that input a
08:39 - degree in Fahrenheit so I just go here
08:42 - and what is the input 2 and 2 is there
08:44 - okay two one two
08:48 - so here you can see
08:50 - FH 212.0 is get printed one space is
08:54 - there after that degree Fahrenheit is
08:57 - equal to
08:58 - 100.00 in Celsius when space should be
09:01 - there you can just give it a space and
09:04 - that will get rectified here okay so
09:06 - we'll see 100.0 is the
09:10 - actual expected out output of that code
09:13 - and we are getting that same here okay
09:15 - so I hope you have also implemented this
09:19 - same way that I have done here
09:22 - okay so moving forward
09:25 - for the second code we have to write a
09:28 - Java program to convert the minutes into
09:30 - a number of years and the dates
09:33 - okay
09:34 - for this let me just create another
09:36 - class
09:40 - so let me just call it as
09:43 - so what we have to do actually convert
09:46 - the year and days okay
09:48 - here
09:52 - here and
09:55 - dates
09:58 - sorry guys
10:01 - okay
10:02 - let me just increase the font size
10:06 - okay
10:07 - and I will write the main method here
10:09 - okay
10:12 - so we have to convert minutes into
10:15 - number of years and equivalent days okay
10:18 - so here is the minute okay
10:20 - so for this
10:22 - again we we want we have to take one
10:25 - input from the user that is in the form
10:26 - of the minute okay
10:29 - for that I have told you which package
10:32 - to import
10:33 - import
10:35 - Java Dot
10:38 - YouTube
10:40 - Dot
10:42 - scanner
10:44 - okay
10:46 - so first of all let me just create one
10:48 - scanner variable
10:51 - scanner sorry object of that scanner
10:53 - class not variable
10:56 - import
10:58 - news scanner
11:02 - system dot in
11:05 - okay
11:07 - so now we have to take one input from
11:10 - the user that is minutes okay so I will
11:13 - create one double variable
11:16 - and name it as
11:19 - minutes
11:21 - in here you can name it whatever you
11:25 - want but
11:27 - name
11:29 - like that okay
11:30 - according to you
11:32 - so minutes in here I will assign the
11:35 - value of that 60
11:38 - into
11:39 - 24
11:41 - into
11:42 - 365.
11:44 - okay
11:47 - now so in the next step
11:49 - I will be
11:51 - printing
11:53 - one string one line that is input the
11:57 - number of minutes
11:59 - I'll be getting those input from the
12:01 - user at this line
12:03 - and put the number
12:07 - of minutes okay
12:12 - let me go into another line so here we
12:16 - have to take the input actual input that
12:18 - is user gonna give us and I'll be
12:20 - storing that inside a variable called
12:22 - Main
12:24 - okay so I I guess all of you know how to
12:28 - take input
12:30 - from the user
12:32 - as we discussed in the last
12:34 - problem statement
12:37 - okay
12:39 - so after receiving the input from the
12:42 - user I have to generate the number of
12:45 - years that is equivalent to that minute
12:47 - and with whatever days that are left
12:50 - after converting that years I have to
12:52 - convert those into days so also okay so
12:55 - I will be creating one long
12:58 - take long variable is there
13:01 - okay I will name it as
13:06 - long years okay so in that I will be
13:09 - giving
13:10 - Min means the minutes that user have
13:14 - input
13:16 - okay that is going to divide it by
13:19 - minutes in the year
13:22 - okay
13:23 - so at this line number nine years are
13:26 - going to store in that
13:28 - variable okay
13:31 - so uh then we have to store the days
13:34 - that are equivalent
13:37 - that the the minutes are left okay
13:39 - okay so in here I have to write int
13:44 - and inside that I can write the whatever
13:48 - the minutes are left divided by 60
13:52 - and again divided by 24
13:56 - mod
13:58 - 365. okay
14:03 - so here at last I will just print out
14:06 - all those information that I have
14:08 - calculated over here
14:10 - okay
14:11 - I will write int
14:15 - Min means the minutes that are using
14:18 - user in going to get give the give us
14:21 - okay
14:22 - that is the minutes
14:26 - is
14:29 - approximately
14:32 - I will concatenate this
14:36 - with the ears okay here's
14:41 - again
14:45 - ears and
14:50 - okay
14:52 - yeah after the years I have to print
14:54 - those days also
14:56 - let me just print those days and after
14:59 - that
15:00 - I will concatenate with it
15:03 - equivalent it's okay
15:06 - I hope this is the answer okay
15:10 - just
15:13 - check me okay so it is asking for the
15:16 - minutes so minutes are three four five
15:19 - six seven eight nine okay
15:22 - let me give this input three four five
15:25 - six seven eight nine
15:26 - if I hit enter it will say
15:30 - 3456789 minutes is approximately six
15:33 - years and 210 days so that is the
15:36 - expected output here you can see okay
15:39 - so I hope you have understood the second
15:41 - question also so just quickly we will
15:44 - move to the third question what is the
15:46 - question let me check write a job
15:48 - program to compute a body mass index of
15:51 - the user okay
15:55 - this is another simple
15:58 - question is there we I will just name
16:01 - the class as BMI
16:05 - calculate okay hit enter
16:09 - let me increase the font size
16:13 - okay
16:15 - main method is there
16:17 - and inside that
16:21 - let me just import
16:23 - scanner okay
16:25 - because we have to receive the weight
16:28 - and height of the user okay
16:33 - java.util dot scanner
16:37 - okay
16:39 - and again I have to create one variable
16:43 - so not variable object
16:47 - input is equal to
16:50 - news
16:51 - scanner
16:54 - system dot in
16:58 - okay till here I hope you either
17:00 - understood so
17:03 - now I will first of all
17:06 - get the weight and height from the user
17:09 - okay
17:10 - so for that let me just print on the
17:13 - console
17:15 - enter your
17:17 - sorry
17:18 - enter your weight
17:22 - and I'll be receiving it in pounds
17:26 - you can take any
17:28 - convention
17:30 - just the formula will change to
17:33 - calculate the BMI okay double
17:36 - weight variable I will declare and store
17:39 - that weight inside that weight variable
17:41 - and to get the input from the user I
17:45 - guess you know what to write
17:48 - down put dot
17:50 - next Double
17:53 - okay now we have to receive the height
17:55 - of the user
17:57 - so again I will shout and
18:00 - enter
18:03 - your
18:05 - height
18:06 - in inches I I will receive the height in
18:10 - inches from the user okay
18:12 - and I will be storing that in the double
18:15 - variable
18:16 - name inches which is will be equal to
18:22 - import
18:24 - Dot
18:26 - next level
18:29 - so now when formula is there to
18:31 - calculate the BMI so the formula is let
18:36 - me just explain you
18:37 - so I will hold all these BMI inside one
18:42 - double variable named BMI
18:46 - okay
18:48 - and inside this the formula is
18:52 - weight
18:54 - okay
18:56 - into
18:58 - zero point
19:01 - four
19:02 - three sorry four five three five I will
19:08 - just write first four
19:10 - points only after the decimal okay
19:15 - divided by
19:17 - inches inches means the height of the
19:19 - user okay
19:21 - multiplied by zero point
19:25 - zero
19:26 - two five four
19:28 - okay and again it will get multiplied
19:33 - by the inches
19:36 - and again multiplied with zero point
19:40 - 0
19:41 - two five four
19:43 - okay after this I will end that line
19:47 - so at this point my BMI is get
19:50 - calculated using the weight and height
19:52 - of the user and it will get stored
19:54 - inside this BMI variable so I I will
19:58 - just simply print that BMI in on the
20:01 - console that is
20:05 - your
20:07 - BMI
20:09 - will be
20:11 - I hope you know how to concatenate two
20:14 - strings okay
20:17 - as we have discussed
20:19 - okay
20:22 - I hope the code will get run
20:25 - okay so it will asking for the weight
20:29 - let me get the sample input 4 5 2 is the
20:33 - weight okay
20:34 - four five two is the weight and what is
20:38 - the height of the user that is 72 inches
20:42 - okay so here you can see the BMI for
20:45 - that user having
20:46 - 4.452 weight and 72 inches height will
20:49 - be 61.2891
20:52 - okay
20:54 - so I hope first three questions you
20:57 - understood and you have
20:59 - you have give it a try to solve by your
21:02 - own so in the next video we'll be
21:05 - talking about the solution for the
21:07 - fourth and fifth question okay
21:09 - so thank you thank you for watching this
21:11 - video I will see you in the next one
