00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Java programming for
00:04 - beginners and in this V video we will
00:06 - see what are arrays and how we can
00:09 - declare and use arrays in Java now what
00:13 - is an array an array is same as a
00:18 - variable but it can store more than one
00:22 - values at a time but the only condition
00:27 - with array is you need to store or you
00:30 - can only store same kind of uh values in
00:34 - an array for example you want to store
00:37 - 10 integer in an array you can do it but
00:41 - you want if you want to store five
00:44 - integers and five double values you can
00:47 - not do it so you can only store same
00:51 - kind of uh you know data type in an
00:55 - array so let's see how we can declare
00:58 - array in Java it's very simple you just
01:02 - need to uh give the data type first of
01:05 - all for example we want to create an
01:07 - integer array then we give the data type
01:10 - and then we use these square brackets
01:13 - and then we give the variable name for
01:17 - example my
01:20 - int array okay and then you can
01:24 - initialize this array in these curly
01:27 - braces and whatever inside these curly
01:31 - braces for example 1A 3A 2A 4A 5 these
01:39 - are the values or elements of the array
01:44 - so it can store multiple integer so we
01:48 - have stored right now five integers in
01:51 - this array right and when you compile it
01:54 - it will work
01:56 - fine there is other way of uh declaring
01:59 - AR
02:00 - and which is like this you just uh use
02:04 - your data type and then uh my
02:09 - int array 2 for
02:12 - example and then you give your square
02:15 - bracket and then you can give values to
02:19 - the array and this will also work fine
02:24 - but it's not the preferred way of
02:28 - declaring array so this first way of uh
02:31 - declaring array is preferred this is not
02:34 - preferred way of declaring array in Java
02:37 - but it'll work if you uh want to declare
02:40 - it so we compile it and it will compile
02:43 - fine it will not complain
02:46 - okay now there are different ways of uh
02:50 - declaring array uh the most basic one is
02:53 - this one but uh there are different ways
02:57 - of declaring arrays like this the most
03:01 - uh used ways of declaring array are
03:05 - these three
03:06 - ways so first is whatever I have showed
03:11 - you here like this and which is like
03:15 - this right and you can declare an array
03:18 - like this integer square bracket and the
03:21 - name and is equal to new uh we haven't
03:25 - learned what is new
03:27 - keyword uh here so I will not go into
03:31 - deep in this and this kind of array this
03:35 - we will learn when we will you know
03:38 - learn how to use classes and
03:40 - objects so we will use this kind of
03:43 - array right now but I want to show you I
03:46 - wanted to show you that these
03:49 - declarations are also possible right so
03:55 - now if you declare an array these are
03:58 - called the elements of the the array and
04:01 - right now our array contains five
04:04 - elements and the index so the position
04:08 - at which these values are stored are
04:11 - called index and the index of the array
04:16 - if you think that uh it will start from
04:19 - one it will not the index of an array
04:22 - starts from zero so for example I want
04:25 - to print the value this one two for
04:29 - example so I can
04:31 - write
04:34 - system.out
04:36 - dot print
04:38 - line and then in here I can print uh my
04:44 - array like this and in the Square ret
04:47 - you can give the index so if you want to
04:50 - uh print this two you may think that uh
04:54 - the Val the position is 1 2 3 third
04:57 - position uh two is at the the third
05:00 - position and you can do it like this but
05:03 - when you run this
05:04 - program it'll give you the value four
05:07 - which is this one so index of the array
05:12 - starts from zero so 0 1 and two so the
05:17 - actual position of uh this value is two
05:20 - and whenever you write index two it will
05:24 - give you the value
05:25 - two okay let's give take some bigger
05:29 - value use 3 31 26 40
05:35 - something and 52 okay and we want to
05:38 - print 26 here so the index of this is 0
05:44 - 1 2 so just write give write the name of
05:47 - your array and then in square braet the
05:50 - index of the array and it will print the
05:53 - index of the array like this okay so in
05:56 - this way you can access the value of a
06:01 - you if you want to access this 100 you
06:03 - can just write the position index zero
06:06 - and then you can access the value 100
06:11 - like this
06:13 - okay and if you want to print all the
06:16 - values in the array I have shown you how
06:18 - to use loops and using for example while
06:22 - loop you can print all the values in the
06:25 - array like this for example we want to
06:28 - print the
06:30 - value of all the
06:33 - elements okay so on the basis of uh its
06:38 - position you can do it for example I
06:41 - declare one more variable int I is equal
06:45 - to Zer which will be the index or let's
06:49 - name it
06:50 - as index of the array okay and if index
06:56 - is less than
07:00 - five right because 0 1 2 3 4 it will go
07:05 - up to four but as soon as it goes to
07:08 - five it will be exhausted right if index
07:12 - is less than five we want to print the
07:15 - value of the array so index we will
07:20 - paste it here instead of zero and then
07:23 - we will increase the value of index by
07:26 - one every time in the loop and this
07:29 - when we run this
07:32 - program this will give
07:34 - you
07:35 - the value of this array like this you
07:39 - see all the elements are printed like
07:42 - using this y Loop first is 100 second is
07:45 - 31 third is 26 fourth is 48 and Fifth
07:49 - Element is 52 okay but if you do
07:54 - something like this for example you
07:57 - change it to six but your array value is
08:02 - five then it will give you an error
08:04 - because the last value it will try try
08:08 - to access is not existing so it will
08:11 - give you some error so always remember
08:13 - what is the size of your array and
08:15 - depending upon the size of the array uh
08:18 - you know consider making your program
08:20 - then it will not give an error right so
08:23 - size of an array is important whenever
08:26 - you use the array so hope you have
08:29 - understood the basic declarations and
08:32 - how to use arrays in Java and I hope you
