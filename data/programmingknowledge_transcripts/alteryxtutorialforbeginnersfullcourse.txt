00:00 - hello everyone welcome to this course
00:04 - altrex for beginners in this course we
00:07 - would be discussing all about a tool
00:09 - called altrex we would be learning its
00:12 - practical Concepts and we would be also
00:14 - seeing that why is it so useful also I
00:17 - would be showing you the procedure
00:19 - through which you can use it into your
00:21 - day-to-day lives also we would be seeing
00:24 - that what difference it is going to be
00:25 - and how it is going to prove useful to
00:28 - us
00:29 - so in this video we are going to
00:31 - introduce ourselves to this particular
00:33 - tool and discuss about its features so
00:36 - that you can decide whether to go for
00:38 - this course or not
00:39 - so this is the first video introduction
00:41 - to altrix let us start by understanding
00:45 - that what actually is altrix so alteryx
00:48 - is a tool that is primarily used for
00:51 - data cleaning so whenever you have a
00:54 - data set with you and you want to clean
00:56 - it then 90 of the task of data cleaning
00:59 - can be done automatically through
01:01 - altrics apart from this there are
01:04 - different features provided by altrex
01:06 - are all combined into this slide altrex
01:09 - is not just only a data cleaning tool
01:11 - but it is also a predictive analysis
01:14 - tool predictive analysis means that a
01:17 - variety of statistical techniques
01:19 - are combined from like data mining
01:21 - predictive modeling and machine learning
01:23 - which will analyze the historical Trends
01:26 - and will make predictions about the
01:28 - future
01:29 - so for this purpose we can use altrix if
01:32 - you want spatial analysis that is when
01:35 - you want to analyze the locations uh
01:38 - relationships or basically the
01:40 - proximities in a geospatial data to
01:43 - extract the insights
01:45 - then you can use this tool altrix altrex
01:48 - also acts as a ETL tool that means to
01:51 - extract transform and load the general
01:54 - procedure of copying the data from one
01:56 - source to destination which can then be
02:00 - used to visualize the data or represent
02:02 - it in a completely different format
02:04 - altrex also acts as a data blending tool
02:07 - that means you can get a data from the
02:09 - different sources and then merge it into
02:12 - a single data warehouse or basically a
02:14 - data set
02:16 - and then analyze it
02:18 - last but not the least Ultra exercise
02:21 - service analysis tool now what is this
02:24 - means cell service analysis tool so once
02:26 - you have created something called a
02:28 - workflow in altrex now you do not need
02:31 - to create it again and again what you
02:33 - can do is simply combine the altrics to
02:36 - just
02:37 - follow the same procedures that you have
02:39 - done up till now and altrix would
02:41 - automatically do the same tasks for you
02:43 - means we can just create the workflow
02:45 - once and use it as many times as you
02:48 - want there is no limit on using it you
02:51 - can create once use many times
02:54 - now let us understand that why should we
02:57 - use altrex so these are some of the
02:59 - features that helps us to understand
03:01 - that why altrex is so much important for
03:04 - us first of all low coding knowledge is
03:06 - needed for this tool it has a very
03:08 - simple interface if you have a knowledge
03:10 - of Excel and some of the features of
03:13 - excel like pivot tables or vlookup where
03:16 - you can simply use altrex for all of
03:19 - your needs so that is why if you do not
03:22 - have a strong coding background then you
03:24 - can use altrex as well
03:26 - it has a very simple drag and drop
03:28 - interface all of the filters or all of
03:30 - the features all of the tools that you
03:32 - want to use that you can simply just
03:35 - drag and drop suppose you want to sort
03:36 - the data so we have a sorting tool
03:38 - provided to us in altrex all you need to
03:40 - do is drag it and drop it on your data
03:42 - set and the data set would be sorted if
03:44 - you want to filter it according to a
03:46 - particular criteria similarly you can
03:47 - just drag the filter tool and drop it
03:49 - over there and that particular filter
03:51 - would be applied
03:53 - it is compatible with different data
03:55 - sources around 80 plus data sources are
03:58 - supported by altrex that means you can
04:01 - use the data set which is in any format
04:04 - it could be in the form of an Excel file
04:06 - a CSV file or basically a
04:09 - semi-structured or unstructured Json
04:11 - file as well you can simply use it in
04:14 - altrex imported in altrex and actually
04:17 - analyze it using the tool because it
04:20 - supports a variety of data sources the
04:23 - integration with the power bi tools with
04:26 - the business intelligence tools like
04:28 - power bi Tableau click sense is also
04:31 - provided to Irish so once you have
04:33 - created some of the insights in those
04:35 - tools you can easily interact with that
04:39 - report or with that dashboard using
04:41 - altrix you can actually make a
04:43 - connection between those two and get a
04:45 - better Insight of your data
04:48 - now uh
04:50 - the last but not the least it is
04:52 - actually the most important feature of
04:54 - altrix that is it provides automation of
04:56 - the manual tasks so all the tasks that
04:58 - you had been doing manually up till now
05:00 - you can actually automate them with the
05:03 - help of altrex and once you have
05:05 - automated those tasks and once the
05:07 - workflow is created you do not have to
05:09 - create it again and again simply you can
05:10 - reuse it as many times as you want
05:14 - now let us take a look at some of the
05:16 - features of altrex and these are the
05:18 - same features that make it so special
05:21 - so first of all is that it supports 80
05:23 - plus data sources as we have already
05:25 - discussed the data files that we are
05:28 - using in altrex can be in any format
05:30 - like a CSV file an Excel file a Json
05:32 - file XML file HTML file any type of a
05:35 - file if it contains data it is supported
05:38 - by itrix you can simply just use it you
05:41 - can import it in altrex and then uh
05:44 - analyze it
05:45 - one more thing this number of the data
05:48 - sources is actually increasing as new
05:50 - versions of altrex are being released so
05:53 - uh even if your data source is not
05:57 - compatible right now it might come in
05:59 - the future
06:00 - it supports all the formats of data like
06:02 - it may be a structured data in the form
06:04 - of a SQL it could be semi-structured or
06:06 - unstructured data in the form of a Json
06:08 - files so whatever the format of the data
06:11 - is it is supported by altrix you don't
06:13 - have to worry about the data format if
06:15 - it is not in a tabular format or so
06:18 - there are 260 plus automation tools that
06:21 - are available for analytics in altrex
06:24 - now these automation tools not only
06:26 - reduce our tasks but also make the
06:29 - analysis and the data cleaning process
06:31 - very smooth like you want to filter out
06:33 - some records you want to sort out some
06:35 - records all you got to do is just use
06:37 - these automation tools through a simple
06:39 - drag and drop and use them on your data
06:41 - set and just see that how it works you
06:44 - do not need to perform complex
06:46 - procedures you do not need any kind of a
06:48 - coding knowledge for this purpose just
06:51 - drag and drop
06:52 - report creation is supported from
06:55 - different data sources that means the
06:57 - different bi tools or the different data
06:59 - sources you can create reports using
07:01 - those like once you have created a
07:03 - report or a workflow in altrex then you
07:06 - can actually use the different data
07:08 - sources for different sorts of
07:10 - visualizations to be combined together
07:11 - in a single report so this is one of the
07:14 - best features supported by altrex now
07:17 - once you have created the report and you
07:19 - want to share it with your team or with
07:21 - a different sets of people then you can
07:23 - export this report in the different file
07:25 - formats that are supported by altrex
07:28 - like PDF Excel file or many more uh and
07:32 - also with the upcoming versions this
07:35 - number of file formats that are
07:37 - supported by altrex is also increasing
07:39 - finally altrix supports the reusable
07:42 - workflows what does it means it means
07:45 - that once you have created a workflow
07:46 - you can reuse it as many times as you
07:48 - want you do not need to just perform
07:50 - those same steps again and again and
07:52 - again you can just simply reuse the
07:54 - workflow that you have already created
07:56 - so this is about the features of altrex
07:59 - and
08:00 - now since we know about the basics of
08:03 - altrex and why is it so useful let us
08:06 - see that how can we actually install
08:09 - Idol tricks into our systems so it is a
08:12 - paid tool but you can get a trial
08:14 - version of 14 days for yourself so we
08:17 - would be just using that trial version
08:19 - only right now okay
08:21 - okay so for this what you need to do is
08:23 - just basically Google idrix
08:27 - here you will see this website official
08:29 - website www.altrex.com
08:32 - in this official website you need to go
08:34 - to this products option so once this
08:37 - products option is open you will see
08:39 - that these are these different products
08:41 - that are available like designer server
08:44 - intelligent Suite Etc from this we need
08:47 - to go with this designer product because
08:48 - it is suitable for individuals so let's
08:51 - just click on this learn more option
08:53 - once you click on this learn more option
08:55 - or you will go to this home page of this
08:58 - particular product which is altrex
08:59 - designer product you can just read all
09:04 - about it the system requirements and the
09:06 - features of this particular product then
09:08 - if you want to install it you can just
09:10 - click on start free trial if you want to
09:12 - watch a demo you can just go with a demo
09:15 - video Let's just click on start free
09:17 - trial
09:18 - now what will you do is it will ask you
09:21 - if you are a new user or if you are an
09:24 - existing user or whatever so I'm a new
09:27 - user let's just click on a new user
09:29 - download now button now what will you do
09:32 - is it will ask you all of these details
09:34 - so uh what you need to do is just
09:37 - actually provide all these details and
09:39 - once you have provided these details you
09:41 - can click on confirm once you will click
09:43 - on confirm the downloading process for
09:46 - an exe file will start for you so uh
09:49 - that's it that's the simple process for
09:52 - downloading this particular setup in the
09:55 - previous video we have already seen the
09:57 - features of altrex and how to actually
10:00 - install its setup so uh now as you can
10:04 - see the exe file is already downloaded
10:07 - I'm just going to click on it to open it
10:09 - up and just work you out throughout this
10:12 - installation process right it is a very
10:15 - simple installation process so first of
10:17 - all what you need to do is you need to
10:19 - just go with the first option which is a
10:21 - typical altrex version
10:24 - if you want our programming language
10:27 - based predictive tools which is an
10:29 - advanced version of alteryx you can go
10:31 - for it but since this course is aimed at
10:34 - beginners so we are just going with a
10:36 - typical version the language you can
10:38 - select I'm just going with English let's
10:40 - click on next
10:41 - then it is going to download all the
10:43 - required files so let's just wait for a
10:46 - few seconds till these files are
10:47 - downloaded
10:49 - now once all the required files are
10:52 - downloaded this kind of a menu
10:55 - will appear in front of you where it
10:58 - would be just verifying all the contents
11:02 - of the setup package so you need to wait
11:03 - for a few seconds let's just meet after
11:06 - this has been done
11:10 - now it will ask for a where to install
11:15 - P application so you can just select a
11:18 - particular folder but I'm just going
11:20 - with the default path let's click on
11:22 - next
11:24 - accept the license agreement again click
11:26 - on next and then it's again going to
11:28 - take a few seconds to install the whole
11:31 - program of your system
11:34 - now once all the installation process
11:37 - has been completed you would be getting
11:39 - just screen just like this make sure
11:42 - this box is checked on and click on
11:44 - finish now once this box is checked on
11:47 - altrex would automatically be running
11:49 - onto your system
11:51 - now once the altrex application has been
11:54 - launched onto your system it would ask
11:56 - you to enter a license key if you have a
11:59 - license key you can just enter it or you
12:01 - can simply click on start free trial
12:03 - then it would ask your mail address and
12:06 - just remember this thing that this
12:08 - should be the same email address that
12:10 - you needed to provide once you were
12:13 - registering like when you were providing
12:15 - your details the email address you
12:17 - entered over there that's the same
12:19 - address that you need to provide over
12:20 - here so let's just enter this email
12:22 - address and click on continue
12:25 - now once you have entered your email
12:27 - address it would ask you whether you
12:29 - want to include the altrex intelligence
12:31 - Suite in your package or not
12:33 - so
12:35 - for now what we can do is just click on
12:37 - this I'll try it later option because I
12:39 - just don't want to use it right now
12:42 - and you can click on start solving so
12:44 - once you have done all these steps this
12:46 - kind of dialog box would appear for the
12:48 - tour we can just click on close to work
12:51 - because we don't need it right so uh
12:54 - this is how the altrex user interface is
12:57 - looking let us take a quick look at all
13:00 - the operations that are going to be of
13:02 - use to us so first of all we have this
13:05 - menu bar with the usual options like
13:06 - file edit View and many more if you just
13:09 - hover over it you will find these
13:11 - different options right next we have is
13:14 - this tabs these are the different tabs
13:17 - having different functionalities like if
13:19 - you want some to add some of the tools
13:22 - then you can use these tabs like for
13:24 - data preparation for joining for parsing
13:28 - for transforming for the machine
13:29 - learning
13:30 - Etc these different tools are available
13:32 - if you want to use any tools what you
13:33 - need to do is just go to its tab get
13:36 - that tool suppose I want to apply a
13:37 - filter just drag it and drop it over
13:40 - here this place where drop tools here is
13:43 - written it is known as a workflow or
13:45 - canvas so you can just drop that
13:47 - particular tool over here and then you
13:49 - would be able to use it now once you've
13:52 - dropped a tool you can see that
13:53 - something changed over here this is a
13:56 - configuration window which would help us
13:58 - to configure this tools like if you want
14:01 - to apply a filter what kind of a filter
14:03 - you want to apply the basic filter or a
14:05 - custom filter in a basic filter what
14:07 - changes you want to do so all these
14:09 - customizations or configurations can be
14:11 - done through this tab known as the
14:12 - configuration tab now once you have
14:14 - configured all the tools into the canvas
14:17 - you can click on this button that is
14:19 - known as the Run button to actually run
14:20 - and this workflow the shortcut is Ctrl R
14:23 - so either you can use the shortcut or
14:25 - just the Run button then what will
14:27 - happen is you would be getting a result
14:29 - or an output so this result would be
14:32 - shown over here in this window this is
14:34 - known as the results window this is
14:36 - where the output would be shown to you
14:38 - right next we have is the search part
14:41 - that is really important especially for
14:44 - the beginners like there are different
14:46 - tabs and the different tools are
14:47 - actually separated in those steps
14:50 - suppose you want to search for a
14:52 - particular tool like let's say you want
14:54 - to search for a formula so we can just
14:56 - simply type formula and you would see
14:59 - this formula is over here you can just
15:01 - use it like this you can just drag it
15:03 - and drop it over here like this okay so
15:05 - this search bar would be of very use to
15:09 - us next we have is this kind of a plus
15:12 - sign so if you want to add or remove
15:13 - some of the tools because there are many
15:15 - tools supported by altrex not all are
15:17 - shown over here you want to add or
15:19 - remove them you can just simply use this
15:21 - option suppose I don't want this SDK
15:24 - example so let's just uncheck this and
15:26 - in case of that I want a spatial
15:29 - analysis right so let's just check on
15:31 - spatial and click on OK so what would
15:34 - happen is as you can see
15:37 - the spatial has been added over here and
15:39 - the SDK analysis has been gone from here
15:42 - so this is how you can work with a
15:44 - simple interface of altrex this is just
15:46 - the introduction part in this video we
15:49 - are going to see that how can we
15:51 - actually import a file into altrix now
15:54 - altrex supports different formats of the
15:57 - file so no matter if your data is in the
16:00 - form of an Excel file or a CSV file or
16:03 - basically any of the formats that are
16:05 - supported by altrex the importing
16:08 - process is going to be same in this
16:11 - video I am going to import an Excel file
16:13 - and show you that how it's done
16:15 - similarly you can just duplicate the
16:18 - steps for any of the file extensions
16:21 - that you have so let us start with the
16:24 - video this is the altrex interface and I
16:27 - have already created a new workflow now
16:30 - once you want to do anything in altrex
16:33 - you need to create a workflow because
16:35 - that is like the basic building block
16:36 - look in altrex so let me first show you
16:39 - how to create a workflow to create a
16:41 - workflow you can do three steps or
16:44 - basically any of the three process you
16:46 - can follow to create a workflow first of
16:49 - all is in this particular window there
16:51 - is this plus sign if you just click on
16:53 - this a new workflow would be created
16:55 - like new workflow too if you want to
16:57 - close the workflow of course there is
16:59 - this cross sign through which you can
17:00 - close this workflow the second way is
17:03 - that you can just go to this file on the
17:05 - top left corner and here is this option
17:07 - of new workflow if you just click on it
17:09 - a new workflow would be created or you
17:11 - can use the keyboard shortcut of Ctrl n
17:13 - to create a new workflow now once your
17:16 - workflow is created as we know in altrex
17:19 - there are a number of tools that are
17:21 - supported by it and all the tools are
17:23 - available in the menu bar
17:25 - so the thing that we need to do is
17:27 - actually input the data as you can see
17:30 - we have these menus of different uh
17:32 - colors that helps us to organize the
17:35 - different tools
17:37 - and separate them from one another so
17:39 - here we need to go to this in and out
17:42 - um Tab and here we have this input data
17:45 - if you see there is this star sign over
17:47 - this input data which means that it has
17:49 - been also added to the favorite stuff if
17:51 - you just go to the favorites tab here is
17:53 - the input data that is present so if you
17:55 - want uh some of your tools that you are
17:58 - frequently using to be added to your
18:00 - favorites that you can also do so that
18:02 - they are available to you in just one
18:04 - menu without having to switch the menus
18:06 - but here we are just going to In and Out
18:09 - just drag it and drop this tool over
18:12 - here
18:13 - right now its location doesn't matter
18:15 - you can essentially place it anywhere in
18:18 - this window
18:19 - then what we are going to do is as you
18:22 - can see as soon as we drag this tool
18:24 - over here this left side panel changed a
18:27 - little bit and why it changed it changed
18:29 - to accommodate the changes that are
18:31 - going to happen right now this means we
18:33 - are going to input some data so how can
18:36 - we input this data we are going to
18:38 - control this using this panel okay so
18:41 - first option is connect a file or
18:43 - database so let's just click on this
18:44 - drop down this shows us this data
18:47 - connections um tab or this data
18:49 - connections dialog box from here we need
18:52 - to select files now why are we selecting
18:54 - these files we are selecting this files
18:56 - because we have an Excel sheet that is
18:59 - already created and that is what we want
19:02 - to import in it so let's just click on
19:04 - select file then you've got to select
19:06 - the location so in my case the sheet
19:09 - that I want to import is present in this
19:11 - desktop and it's named as quarter one
19:13 - data dot xlsx that is it is an Excel
19:18 - worksheet you can click on open
19:20 - now once you click on open this kind of
19:23 - an Excel dialog box would be appearing
19:26 - in front of you let us understand this
19:28 - but before understanding it let us let
19:30 - me show you that how the Excel file is
19:32 - looking okay
19:34 - so uh this is the Excel sheet uh that we
19:37 - have available with us actually the
19:39 - whole Excel file in this whole Excel
19:41 - file we have three sheets November 2021
19:43 - December 2021 and Jan 2022 so basically
19:47 - it contains three columns all of these
19:49 - sheets contains three or four columns in
19:52 - Jan 2022 we have three columns which is
19:54 - date product and the quantity in
19:57 - December 2021 we have four columns State
19:59 - product quantity and the total number of
20:01 - sales and in November we have date
20:03 - product quantity and the number of the
20:05 - items that were returned okay so this is
20:07 - the Excel sheet now one thing you must
20:09 - remember if you are working with ultra X
20:12 - type whatever file you're gonna Import
20:13 - in altrex first you have to close that
20:15 - way I want to import this particular
20:17 - Excel file into altrex so I need to just
20:19 - close it so that it could work in altrex
20:22 - so let me just close this file uh let me
20:24 - just delete this tool over here
20:27 - and simple delete key would work over
20:29 - here again let's just drag and drop this
20:31 - tool over here and then we can just
20:34 - connect a Philo database once again by
20:36 - clicking on this drop down going to
20:38 - files select file and this time this
20:41 - quarter one data Dot
20:44 - Excel file now here we have as you can
20:47 - see we had three sheets available that
20:49 - is December 2021 Jan 2022 and November
20:52 - 2021 so if you want to just import only
20:55 - a single sheet you can just select the
20:57 - sheet from here
20:59 - if you don't want to import the whole
21:01 - sheet you just want a range of cells
21:03 - that you can select from here or if you
21:06 - want a named range now what is a named
21:08 - range in case of excel if the named
21:10 - range is available so what would happen
21:12 - is like there is a table you can name a
21:15 - table that would be a named range so if
21:17 - that name range is available into your
21:19 - sheet this option would be enabled and
21:22 - then you can just select the named range
21:24 - that you want to import instead of the
21:26 - whole sheet okay or if you want to
21:29 - import the list of sheet names that uh
21:31 - it would only get you all the sheet
21:34 - names in a list format so I don't want
21:35 - all of this I just want to import the
21:37 - sheet that is the December 2021 sheet
21:40 - this is what I want to import now you
21:42 - can click on OK
21:44 - and once you click on OK you can see the
21:46 - left panel has again changed and this
21:49 - time we are getting a lot more
21:51 - information first of all on this bottom
21:53 - panel you can see the records are being
21:55 - shown since our sheet was small the
21:58 - number of records were less around six
22:00 - to seven records were there so all the
22:02 - records are being shown over here
22:04 - but if your data set is huge then only
22:07 - the first 100 records will be shown in
22:09 - this preview tab as you can see the
22:12 - messages written here preview first 100
22:15 - records only the first 100 records would
22:17 - be shown now if you want to make any
22:18 - changes over here this is the
22:20 - configuration panel that would allow you
22:22 - to make the changes right like you can
22:24 - set the record limit Suppose there are
22:26 - seven records but I don't want all seven
22:28 - I just want the five records to be shown
22:29 - I can simply type here 5 but as you can
22:32 - see there is no change so how can we uh
22:34 - incorporate this change either we can
22:36 - click on this refresh button so only the
22:38 - five records would be visible
22:40 - or what we can do is if you want to use
22:44 - this output panel so what is this output
22:46 - panel this is an output panel that
22:48 - actually would import or show you the
22:51 - changes that would occur once you have
22:53 - made any changes into the tool right so
22:55 - we can just use this run button or the
22:57 - shortcut Ctrl R to incorporate this
23:00 - output panel
23:02 - and as you can see once you click on the
23:04 - Run button this dialog box would appear
23:06 - that would tell you that how much time
23:08 - this whole query this whole process took
23:11 - into a consideration that is 0.04
23:14 - seconds so let's just click on OK and
23:17 - now you can see the five records have
23:19 - been displayed you would get plenty of
23:21 - information in this output panel as well
23:23 - like how many fields are there so there
23:25 - are four fields and all the fields of
23:26 - this are being shown
23:28 - okay uh if you click on this drop down
23:31 - you would be able to change these fields
23:32 - if you want like uh all these fields are
23:35 - available let me just
23:37 - like all these fields are checked right
23:39 - now suppose I don't want to get the date
23:41 - I just want all these things okay these
23:44 - three things so only these three things
23:45 - are visible and here we are getting uh
23:47 - information that three out of four
23:48 - fields are being shown you can
23:51 - um just hide all Fields or click on this
23:54 - tick sign to show all the fields okay
23:57 - then we have the format that is being
24:00 - displayed which is the cell viewer
24:01 - format if you want to get the
24:04 - information about the particular cell
24:05 - that you can get like what is the name
24:08 - of the column what is its type what is
24:10 - its size where is the source file
24:12 - Etc
24:13 - so all of this we are getting in the
24:15 - cell viewer information how many recalls
24:17 - are displayed over here this is also
24:18 - being shown
24:20 - so this is the data that we are getting
24:21 - next option is a metadata option so if
24:24 - you click on this metadata you would be
24:26 - getting information about the data like
24:27 - the cell viewer option that we just
24:29 - selected this is all available over here
24:31 - the name of the column it's type its
24:33 - size and its source if the description
24:36 - have added any description that would
24:38 - also be shown in this metadata let's
24:39 - just go to data because that's what we
24:41 - are going to work on so this is about
24:43 - the output panel and the uh Records or
24:46 - the information that it displays now
24:48 - let's head back to this left panel that
24:50 - is the configuration panel
24:52 - in this you can see the file format is
24:54 - Excel if you want to change any of the
24:56 - file formats you can just select from
24:59 - these these are all supported by alteryx
25:01 - now we have output file name as field
25:05 - now what is this thing
25:07 - suppose you are importing multiple files
25:11 - in one group okay and you want to know
25:13 - that which field belongs to which file
25:15 - so you can use this particular option
25:16 - like right now inside to know let's just
25:19 - select file name only now if you just
25:21 - click on run remember one thing once you
25:23 - have made any change you have to click
25:25 - on run you will see that it would give
25:28 - you the name of the file or the Excel
25:29 - file from where you have taken this data
25:32 - right so this is actually how the Excel
25:35 - file is imported in altrex it is a
25:37 - pretty simple process and as you can see
25:40 - it's very easy and gives you so much
25:42 - information about the data in this video
25:45 - we are going to see two things first of
25:47 - all we are going to see that how can we
25:49 - save an altrex file or an altrex
25:51 - workflow to be more precise next we are
25:54 - going to see that how can we import
25:55 - multiple files into altrex okay so first
25:59 - of all let's see how can we save a
26:01 - workflow this is the workflow from our
26:03 - previous video it says start term we
26:05 - have created
26:06 - so how do we save it we can just go to
26:08 - file there is this option to save with a
26:11 - shortcut Ctrl s that you can select uh
26:14 - you have to select the path where you
26:15 - want to save so whatever path you want
26:18 - that you can just select
26:21 - so this is this altrex files folder
26:23 - where I want to save it okay you can
26:25 - give it any name like let me just give
26:27 - it
26:29 - XL1
26:33 - okay and the extension is going to be y
26:37 - x empty that means it is a workflow file
26:40 - okay then you can click on Save once you
26:43 - have saved it you can see the workflow
26:44 - has renamed itself to xl1.y XMD okay
26:49 - so that's a pretty simple process of
26:51 - saving now what we can do is create a
26:52 - new workflow from here
26:54 - and just close this workflow so the new
26:57 - workflow that we have created is now
26:59 - going to help us import multiple files
27:01 - so first of all let's take a look at the
27:03 - files that we want to import okay
27:06 - okay so we have this folder called CSV
27:09 - in which we have two CSV files data 2021
27:12 - and data 2022 okay uh also I do data
27:16 - 2020. so what is a CSV file CSV stands
27:19 - for comma separated values in which all
27:21 - the records are separated by commas and
27:24 - are placed one beside the other so if
27:26 - you just open it with the help of a
27:28 - notepad you can see this is how this
27:31 - file is looking the names of the column
27:33 - is series reference period data value
27:35 - suppressed status units magnitude Etc
27:38 - there are columns and then these are all
27:41 - the values of the columns and as you can
27:43 - see they are all separated by commas
27:45 - these are the commas that are going to
27:47 - separate them one from the other okay so
27:50 - this is the CSV files that we have the
27:52 - name of the folder is CSV it is present
27:54 - in the desktop and the two files is data
27:56 - 2021 and data 2020 okay so the common
27:59 - thing between them is the word data and
28:03 - the first two characters of the year
28:04 - that is 20 okay
28:06 - or actually the first three characters
28:08 - okay so let's see how can we work with
28:11 - it on ultrix so let's just bring our
28:13 - workflow let's just input the data so
28:16 - this is the tool drop it over here now
28:19 - uh what we are going to do is just click
28:21 - on this drop down the process of
28:24 - importing the file is going to be same
28:26 - okay let's just click on files select a
28:29 - file and here this is the CSV folder and
28:32 - now if you want you can just select any
28:34 - of the file that you want to import okay
28:36 - so this is this data so 2021 let's click
28:39 - on open now what would happen is uh the
28:42 - first 100 records would be shown to you
28:44 - if you just click on run this workflow
28:46 - then in the case of the output
28:49 - and you will get the time it takes to
28:52 - execute it which is 0.6 seconds and you
28:54 - would see how many columns are there
28:56 - there are a total of 14 columns and uh
28:59 - 5000 records are being displayed now why
29:02 - the 5000 records are being displayed
29:03 - there are a total of around 20 000
29:05 - records okay so in the case of a huge
29:08 - data set we get only few records to be
29:11 - displayed in this output panel
29:13 - why is it because in the output panel
29:16 - the maximum allowed limit is 1 MB so how
29:19 - many records you can get in 1 MB only
29:21 - those records would be displayed right
29:23 - like in this case we have 5102 records
29:26 - out of the total number now uh these are
29:29 - sufficient to get you an idea of the
29:32 - fact that how the things are gonna work
29:36 - so it's okay but here in this case what
29:39 - we are getting is only
29:42 - the records of the table of the sheet
29:45 - that is data 2021 we are not getting
29:48 - 2020s data right so how can we get
29:51 - multiple files how can we like import
29:53 - multiple files into altarex right so for
29:56 - this we are going to use something known
29:58 - as the wildcard characters
30:00 - now there are multiple white card
30:02 - characters that are available but here
30:04 - we are going to use the Asterix file
30:06 - guide character and how are we gonna use
30:08 - it here you can see uh when we import a
30:11 - file you get the path of that particular
30:13 - file okay so what I'm gonna do is just
30:15 - remove this thing and as we saw that the
30:18 - Common Ground was Data space 2020 or 22.
30:24 - so the last
30:26 - or digit was different just the two
30:29 - files rest of the name was same right so
30:32 - what we are going to do is after data
30:34 - I'm just going to put an asterisk
30:37 - and click on enter or click on refresh
30:39 - now once I do that all the data files
30:42 - over here
30:45 - are being you know
30:50 - imported
30:52 - so let's just wait for a few seconds
31:00 - right
31:03 - if you just click on this uh you will
31:06 - get the file over here the link that
31:08 - would be was shown to you
31:12 - so here what we have done is actually I
31:15 - have reduced the number of Records in
31:18 - both the files and why I have done this
31:20 - uh this step is done to uh just show you
31:24 - that how these two files are
31:27 - actually taken together okay so let's
31:31 - see how it is happening right now what
31:33 - we are getting over here is two warnings
31:35 - it is fairly normal it's just because
31:37 - the number of Records
31:39 - or the number of fields are different
31:42 - for different records okay
31:44 - so if you just click on this output
31:46 - column uh we are going getting total 13
31:49 - records that are being displayed okay
31:51 - now these 13 records are actually from a
31:55 - combination of both the files that is
31:57 - 2021 and 2022 or 2021 or 2020 okay now
32:02 - how do we verify this in order to verify
32:04 - this we are going to use this fourth
32:06 - field that is output file name as feed
32:09 - right now it's selected to know
32:11 - that means we do not know which records
32:13 - belongs to which file but if we just
32:15 - selected to file name only and click on
32:17 - Run for the workflow
32:19 - then we would be getting this dialog box
32:22 - let's just click on OK and we just click
32:25 - on this output panel then you can see
32:28 - the number of fields has changed to 15
32:29 - and here is this file name field where
32:32 - we are getting 2021 data and 2022 data
32:35 - okay so uh here you can see the first
32:38 - six records
32:39 - are from 2021 data and the remaining
32:42 - seven records are from 2022 data a
32:45 - combination of totals 13 records is
32:47 - being shown over here that means there
32:49 - are a total of 13 records that are being
32:51 - displayed to us okay now
32:55 - let's just see what all uh things we can
32:57 - do over here
32:58 - and that is like
33:01 - uh just keep it to file name only here
33:04 - we have some information like the
33:06 - delimiters information so what is a
33:08 - delimiter like in comma separated values
33:10 - the different values are separated by a
33:12 - comma so that means comma is a delimiter
33:14 - it separates the values right so comma
33:17 - is taken as a delimiter if you have uh
33:20 - like a Json file or an HTML file then of
33:23 - course comma would not be the delimiter
33:25 - the delimiter would be different so
33:27 - whatever character you want as a
33:29 - delimiter that you can use over here
33:32 - next we have first row contains field
33:34 - names so in order to understand this let
33:37 - me just open the CSV file in notepad
33:39 - once okay
33:40 - so here is the CSV file that I have
33:42 - opened in notepad this is the first
33:45 - series of commas that we are getting and
33:48 - this is actually
33:50 - the column names so this is the first
33:52 - field that a series reference period
33:54 - data value suppress Etc this is all
33:57 - taken as the field name so this first
34:00 - option that we have let me just close
34:02 - this file this first option that we have
34:03 - first row contains field names if it is
34:05 - checked then the first row is selected
34:08 - as the field names if you just uncheck
34:10 - it and run it once again
34:12 - then what would happen is
34:15 - click on okay show the output uh you can
34:19 - see field two field three Field Four
34:21 - like this all the field names have been
34:23 - shown to us and the first comma
34:25 - separated values that we had would be
34:27 - taken as a record itself right so which
34:30 - is of course not correct so let me just
34:32 - Rectify it by again running it by
34:35 - checking that particular option okay
34:39 - uh next we have all these information
34:42 - which is actually not that important but
34:44 - it is there
34:46 - to you know just um
34:49 - give you much more information about the
34:51 - data one thing is ignored elementors and
34:53 - quotes So suppose we have some values uh
34:56 - into our data which actually includes
34:58 - the comma like apple comma banana which
35:01 - are not two separate values so to tell
35:04 - the computer this thing what we can do
35:06 - is actually include it in quotes and
35:08 - that would be ignored as a delimiter so
35:10 - if you want to ignore anything as that
35:12 - element of that you can do okay so this
35:15 - is all about the multiple files there is
35:18 - one more thing that we need to know and
35:20 - that is suppose we make some changes
35:21 - into the folder let me just go to the
35:24 - CSV folder and let me just copy this
35:26 - file and paste it so Suppose there is a
35:29 - change in the folder
35:30 - uh let me just rename it to
35:34 - 2020 underscore data okay
35:39 - now what happens if I have added a
35:42 - another file or if I remove some files
35:44 - okay
35:45 - we can just click on run
35:47 - and
35:49 - now if we just click on this output you
35:52 - can see the total number of Records
35:53 - displayed is 20. so this whole process
35:57 - is now automatic if any changes are
36:00 - being made into your data or into the
36:03 - folder in the files that would be
36:04 - reflected automatically in altrex that's
36:08 - the beauty of this in this video we are
36:10 - going to talk about the data types that
36:12 - are supported in altrex so as we know
36:15 - that altrex is a self-service data
36:17 - analytics tool it makes the process of
36:20 - ETL easier
36:22 - and it is a super tool that combines the
36:24 - functionalities that are required for
36:26 - the steps of data preparation geospatial
36:29 - analysis and data science
36:31 - mainly to support all these
36:33 - functionalities altrix uses these five
36:37 - data types these are the five data types
36:39 - that are supported in altrex which are
36:42 - string data numeric data date and time
36:44 - data Boolean data and spatial objects
36:46 - once the data is brought into altrex the
36:49 - altrex data type is applied to the
36:52 - entire column and each value within that
36:54 - column altrex tends to use the best
36:57 - suitable data type for the data coming
36:59 - from the databases or the structured
37:01 - files such as Excel within the altrex
37:04 - table
37:05 - now let us look at all of these data
37:07 - types in detail one by one so first of
37:10 - all we come to the string data type
37:12 - string data represents only text even if
37:16 - the data is numeric or spaces or special
37:17 - characters if a string consists of
37:19 - numbers it is ideally advised to First
37:22 - convert it to the numeric data type then
37:25 - you can just perform the calculations
37:26 - into it
37:27 - the string data is the one that is kept
37:30 - as it is
37:32 - it is further divided into these four
37:34 - categories that is string v string W
37:37 - string and V underscore string string
37:39 - and W string are of fixed length
37:42 - and you have to set the predefined
37:43 - length of the string so suppose you have
37:45 - set 8 to 100 characters then every time
37:48 - it would take a hundred characters
37:50 - um The W string can hold more
37:52 - International characters
37:54 - now we have v string and we underscore W
37:56 - string it stands for variable the V here
37:59 - stands for variable that means we cannot
38:02 - set any predefined length or we should
38:03 - not send any predefined length and it
38:07 - adjusts itself according to the length
38:09 - of the text of of the value that it is
38:12 - going to hold
38:14 - next we have is the numeric data type
38:16 - numeric altered stereotypes um are the
38:19 - ones that contains only the numbers it
38:22 - stores the numbers
38:24 - that could be represented by either a
38:26 - single digit or by multiple digits as
38:28 - well we have different combinations in
38:31 - this like byte integer fixed decimal
38:34 - float and double by 10 integer are the
38:37 - whole numbers fixed decimal float and
38:40 - double include a decimal number as well
38:42 - byte is a small number then we have
38:45 - integer which has more significant
38:47 - numbers as you can see they range as
38:49 - well in the examples
38:51 - um then we have fixed decimal which is
38:54 - used for currency and float and double
38:56 - so this is fixed SML which is used as a
38:59 - currency
39:00 - that's a numeric value with a decimal
39:02 - next we have the float and double which
39:05 - are used for most precise numbers float
39:08 - and code are not good because it comes
39:11 - to comparison they are never equal float
39:15 - is generally used to save the memory
39:18 - now the next stereotype we have is the
39:20 - date time data type
39:21 - uh in altrex the format of date time and
39:26 - date and time combined together are
39:27 - fixed so you will need to do some
39:30 - manipulation on your data if it is not
39:32 - in the format that you need as
39:35 - generalized by alteryx sometimes it is
39:38 - very difficult to work with date and
39:39 - time there is a tool known as the
39:42 - daytime macro that converts the date and
39:44 - time in human readable as well as altrex
39:47 - readable format
39:49 - so the format is as you can see for the
39:51 - date there is a 10 character string uh
39:54 - employing four characters for EO two for
39:57 - month and two for date this is the
39:59 - general format that is supported by
40:00 - altrex then we have time which is again
40:03 - an eight character string
40:05 - two characters for R2 for minutes and
40:07 - two for seconds and the examples have
40:10 - been shown on the right side of the
40:11 - screen next we have date and time
40:13 - combined which is a 19 character string
40:16 - employing four characters for the year
40:18 - two for the month two for the date and
40:21 - two each for the hours minutes and
40:23 - seconds and an example has been shown on
40:25 - the right side
40:27 - so these are the date and time data used
40:29 - that are supported in altrex next we
40:32 - have is the Boolean data type
40:35 - so the Boolean basically represents a
40:38 - flag and it has only two possible values
40:40 - that is true and false so true means
40:43 - non-zero or one
40:45 - and false means zero
40:48 - or basically any other digit that is not
40:51 - zero can be considered as true
40:53 - Boolean is used to basically
40:56 - characterize the objects categorize them
40:59 - into various categories or identify them
41:01 - whether the objects
41:02 - are a part of the particular category or
41:04 - not for example let's take a a student
41:07 - data set so
41:09 - in the student data set we can check
41:11 - that if the student has passed the test
41:14 - or not so we can just create or the data
41:17 - can have a column as passed it could
41:20 - have values true false or yes no so true
41:24 - false in that case would be represented
41:26 - using the Boolean data types
41:30 - next we have is the spatial objects
41:32 - spatial objects are used for mapping and
41:35 - are associated with maintaining the data
41:37 - records
41:38 - a point a line polyline or polygon all
41:43 - comes under spatial objects which can be
41:45 - used for mapping
41:47 - it is associated with the data record
41:49 - and
41:51 - they can be multiple spatial object
41:53 - fields in a table
41:55 - furthermore if you want to use any of
41:57 - the data like which is which cannot be
42:01 - represented in the format of a text like
42:03 - let's suppose an image or a video
42:05 - or an audio file then we use the spatial
42:08 - objects again
42:10 - so what happens is when you just import
42:12 - the table or any kind of an Excel file
42:16 - then what happens is these spatial
42:19 - objects are
42:20 - automatically invoked actually there are
42:23 - two ways through which
42:25 - this altrex
42:27 - Imports this data types like how it uses
42:30 - these data types so let us take a look
42:31 - at them as well
42:33 - data in altrex can be brought through
42:36 - these two Fields or three through these
42:39 - two tools that is the auto field tool
42:41 - and the select tool now what is the
42:43 - difference between them auto field tool
42:45 - is used to select the data type
42:47 - automatically by altrex while the select
42:49 - tool helps the user to decide the data
42:52 - type so in case you are a user and you
42:54 - don't want an overhead of selecting the
42:57 - data for altrix you can just go for the
42:59 - auto field tool so autofill tool is used
43:03 - to read through all of the records of an
43:05 - input and set the field type to the
43:07 - smallest possible size that is relative
43:09 - to the data contained in the column the
43:12 - tool correctly assigns a numeric field
43:14 - to a string data type where any record
43:17 - starts with 0 and not a number
43:20 - so in order to configure the tool we can
43:22 - just go to the select string fields to
43:24 - Auto change field type and select the
43:27 - fields to Auto configure them we can use
43:30 - either individually or all the fields at
43:32 - once as well
43:35 - next we have is the select tool so the
43:37 - select tool is used to include exclude
43:40 - and reorder The Columns of data that
43:42 - pass through your workflow excluding The
43:44 - Columns that can limit the data passing
43:46 - through a workflow and improve
43:48 - performance we can also use the select
43:50 - tool to modify the type and size of the
43:52 - data rename a column or add a
43:54 - description to it
43:56 - now there are other tools that include
43:58 - the select tool functionality such are
44:01 - append Fields tool find nearest tool
44:03 - join tool join multiple tool selecting
44:05 - DB tool and spatial match tool we can
44:08 - use the table to modify the incoming
44:10 - data stream each row in the table
44:12 - represents a column in the data the
44:14 - field column in the table identifies the
44:16 - name of the column in the data and auto
44:18 - sizes to fit the column names without
44:20 - cutting off any text which is taken up
44:23 - to 40 characters so this is how the
44:26 - autofill tool and the select tool works
44:29 - in itrix now as we know that there are
44:31 - multiple Tools in altrex and each of
44:34 - them have a specific functionality in
44:37 - case you are interested in learning more
44:39 - about these tools then what you can do
44:42 - is refer to the official altrex
44:44 - documentation now how to access it let
44:46 - me show you so in order to access it uh
44:49 - first of all I have opened up Google and
44:51 - all you need to do is Google altrex help
44:55 - so once you uh Google it the first link
44:57 - that comes up is the home page instead
44:59 - of going to the home page you can select
45:01 - on this documentation link so what would
45:04 - happen is the whole altrex health
45:07 - documentation would be open in front of
45:10 - you now in case you want to learn about
45:12 - anything related to altrex you can refer
45:14 - to this documentation which is very much
45:16 - precise and clean
45:18 - in case you want to learn about these
45:19 - tools specific tools then you can refer
45:22 - to this um
45:23 - menu over here where all the tools are
45:26 - present and they are configured or they
45:28 - are
45:29 - grouped together like all these tools
45:32 - that are present in the in-out tab are
45:33 - together grouped in this in out the
45:36 - tools that are present in the
45:37 - preparation tab are all present over
45:39 - here you can click on any of these links
45:41 - and that link would be opened here you
45:44 - would find theme way through which you
45:46 - can use the tools how to use it how is
45:49 - it looking and how you can configure it
45:53 - then uh you can also see some examples
45:56 - that what would happen when this tool is
45:58 - being used what kind of output you would
46:00 - be seeing so uh these are the
46:03 - documentation that would help you to
46:05 - learn about all the tools in altrex but
46:07 - the common ones that are used and the
46:09 - most important ones we would be covering
46:11 - in this course in this video we are
46:13 - going to start discussing about the
46:16 - important tools in altrex the tools that
46:19 - would help you carry out the different
46:21 - tasks that are really important
46:24 - throughout your altrex journey
46:26 - so without any further Ado let us start
46:29 - with this video
46:30 - first of all before jumping into the
46:32 - tools part let us download the data set
46:35 - now this data set that we are going to
46:37 - download is going to be used throughout
46:40 - this course so it is important for you
46:44 - to have a copy of this data set for you
46:46 - as well so how do we download this uh
46:49 - first of all what you need to do is
46:51 - simply Google sample Superstore data set
46:53 - like I have Googled over here
46:55 - now once you do that the first link that
46:57 - would come up would be a tableau
46:58 - community so let's just click on this
47:00 - link
47:02 - and
47:04 - this is actually a data set that has the
47:08 - different types of information like the
47:11 - five data types of altrix that we have
47:13 - just learned are all supported in this
47:16 - particular data set it has around 10 000
47:18 - records so it is easier for you to
47:21 - understand the concepts and practice it
47:23 - on this kind of a data set it is
47:25 - available for free so you can use it as
47:28 - many times as you want now once this
47:30 - link is open here you can see this is an
47:32 - Excel file you can just simply click on
47:34 - download and store it into the location
47:37 - that you want so since I have already
47:39 - downloaded it over here sample
47:41 - superstore.xlx as you can see so I'm not
47:43 - going to redownload it but you can just
47:46 - save it now once you have downloaded the
47:48 - data set let's come back to our altrex
47:50 - tool
47:51 - here today I'm going to discuss about
47:54 - the browse tool in altrex now the browse
47:57 - tool is a really important tool and here
47:59 - I have actually implemented the browse
48:01 - tool but what I'm going to do is just
48:03 - delete all of this functionality and
48:06 - show you once again that how it is
48:07 - working okay
48:09 - so first of all let's understand what is
48:11 - a browse tool as you can see uh we have
48:14 - in this favorites tab the browse tool is
48:15 - available but if you just check the
48:18 - in-out tab that's where the browse tool
48:20 - would be present okay so the browse tool
48:23 - is used to view the data from a
48:25 - connected tool what do you mean by a
48:27 - connected tool that means the browse
48:28 - tool if you just bring it over here like
48:31 - this then it won't be able to show you
48:33 - some data it needs some kind of a tool
48:35 - so browse tool is actually a connected
48:37 - tool
48:38 - okay so we can see the data profile
48:43 - for multiple columns at once in a single
48:45 - holistic view or for a single column of
48:48 - the data we can
48:50 - see the information on a data type the
48:53 - number of Records the quality of the
48:55 - data and a variety of other statistics
48:57 - as well using the browse tool uh in case
49:00 - of a spatial report or a behavioral data
49:03 - analysis the type is connected and
49:05 - additional tab is available in the
49:07 - browse Tool uh that shows the preview of
49:10 - the actual object on a map or a report
49:13 - okay so browse tool if you just bring it
49:16 - up listen understand this this thing
49:20 - that's green over here is known as an
49:23 - anchor it has one anchor
49:25 - that is the input anchor now if you just
49:28 - bring up this input data tool which you
49:30 - have already used you can see it also
49:31 - has one anchor but it has the shape of
49:34 - the anchor of the browse tool and the
49:36 - input tool is different so the input
49:38 - tool has an output anchor that means the
49:41 - input tool contains the data and it
49:43 - gives its data to some other tool browse
49:46 - tool on the other hand
49:47 - cannot exist independently it needs some
49:50 - other tool to exist that's why it takes
49:52 - the data from some other tool and to
49:55 - take the data from some other tool it
49:57 - needs an anchor that's why to use the
49:59 - browse tool at least the input tool
50:01 - should be present so that it acts as an
50:03 - input anchor and this acts as a
50:05 - receiving anchor for itself okay
50:07 - so
50:09 - let us now see how can we uh use the
50:11 - data or use the browse tool to show the
50:14 - data the data profile okay so first of
50:17 - all uh we have this input tool using
50:19 - this input tool what I'm going to do is
50:21 - actually import a file into altrex okay
50:24 - the sample Superstore data set file that
50:26 - we have just downloaded that is the file
50:29 - that I'm going to import so let's go to
50:31 - file
50:33 - and select file here is the sample
50:36 - Superstore file let us open it now it
50:39 - asks for a sheet so the order sheet is
50:42 - what I'm going to go with let's just
50:43 - click on OK
50:45 - so after a few seconds you can see that
50:48 - here in the configuration panel we have
50:50 - this whole data set right now only a
50:53 - hundred rows are being shown over here
50:54 - if you just run this workflow
50:57 - then we would be able to see it in the
51:00 - output column but the output would not
51:04 - be shown over here right now
51:10 - and these kind of Errors would be
51:12 - opening why because of the browse tool
51:15 - we have used the browse tool but not
51:17 - actually provided a connection to it so
51:19 - let's see how do we work with it
51:23 - how do we uh you know
51:26 - work around it okay so let's just first
51:28 - close this message now what we are going
51:31 - to do is connect these two anchors like
51:33 - this drag from the input anchor and drop
51:36 - it to the browse tool anchor right now
51:39 - it's going to take a few seconds
51:40 - and again if you just run the workflow
51:45 - then it's going to take a few seconds
51:47 - and then the information will be shown
51:49 - you can see the percentage of the work
51:51 - that's been done
51:53 - and once all the work has been done you
51:55 - would get this kind of a message let's
51:57 - click on OK now the information being
51:59 - shown in the configuration panel is with
52:01 - relevant to the input data tool if you
52:03 - just click on the browse tool then right
52:05 - now nothing is being shown because we
52:07 - have not selected any of the records
52:08 - right if you remember I just told you
52:10 - that uh you have to select at least one
52:13 - column or you can select multiple
52:15 - columns as well so that the information
52:17 - is being shown
52:19 - to you okay so let's just select some
52:21 - column uh let's say the category column
52:23 - if you just select this category column
52:25 - from here
52:27 - then wait for a few seconds and the
52:29 - information or the report of the
52:31 - category column or the data profile of
52:33 - the category column would be shown in
52:35 - this configuration panel
52:38 - so this is the data profile of the
52:40 - category column that has been shown over
52:42 - here
52:44 - just a second
52:48 - yeah so um
52:52 - we just select the category column here
52:54 - it is being shown and as you can see the
52:57 - data type first it has taken is the
52:59 - variable string so that means the length
53:03 - is variable to just save the memory
53:05 - space the total number of Records the
53:07 - size that has been taken is 255 bytes
53:10 - okay now out of the total
53:14 - 9994 records the total records that are
53:17 - okay is all the records are okay here
53:20 - you can see the number of records that
53:21 - are okay and the percentage so 100
53:23 - records are okay unique means how many
53:26 - different values are there so as you can
53:28 - see we are getting three over here that
53:30 - means the three possible values for
53:32 - category of furniture office supplies
53:34 - and Technology
53:36 - that has been shown over here then we
53:38 - have some of the statistics of the
53:39 - length so the minimum length of the
53:41 - value is nine as you can see it should
53:44 - be furniture
53:45 - then the maximum is 15 which is for
53:47 - office space supplies then we have the
53:50 - shortest value which is Furniture of
53:52 - course longest values office underscore
53:54 - supplies
53:55 - then we have the first alphanumeric
53:57 - value that is the first value that you
53:59 - are getting is furniture and the last
54:00 - record must be having the category as
54:03 - office supplies right
54:05 - as technology uh there are no blanks
54:09 - that means the particular column is
54:12 - clean it has no inconsistent data there
54:14 - is no leading white space and there is
54:16 - no trailing white space now there is
54:18 - another reason of choosing this
54:19 - particular data set because this is a
54:21 - clean data set it does not have any of
54:23 - the inconsistencies so for us as a
54:25 - beginners it's easier to understand and
54:28 - work with these kind of data sets okay
54:30 - uh then we have the frequent values
54:33 - so it would tell you that how many
54:36 - um
54:37 - instances of the particular category are
54:39 - there if we talk about office supplies
54:41 - so there are six thousand uh 26 records
54:44 - of the office supplies that is the most
54:46 - number of records for this then we have
54:48 - furniture about 2521 records and
54:51 - Technology with 1.8 uh K records
54:55 - so this is the data profile of the
54:57 - particular column that has been shown
54:59 - over here as you can see the column is
55:01 - uh taken over here as category if we
55:03 - just try to employ subcategory as well
55:05 - over here
55:09 - so this is the subcategory
55:12 - that we have implied over here right now
55:14 - and now the summary has changed as you
55:16 - can see the number of unique values is
55:18 - 17 now uh so there are 17 subcategories
55:21 - and here is the introduction of the
55:24 - individual subcategories of frequent
55:26 - values the graph that has been shown
55:27 - over here there are 12 more values you
55:29 - can expand it and see that what is the
55:31 - occurrence of each of these
55:33 - subcategories okay
55:35 - next we have is the country so the
55:37 - country if you just select on this
55:38 - country column it's all United States
55:41 - right now so I don't think it's going to
55:44 - make any difference then we have the
55:46 - cities which has 531 uh unique values
55:49 - for the cities and how it has been shown
55:52 - so this is the usage of the browse tool
55:54 - through which it is used to show the
55:56 - different records okay
55:58 - now
55:59 - in order to view multiple values uh what
56:03 - we can do is actually use the Left Right
56:05 - View or the top bottom view right now
56:08 - subcategories being selected in this
56:09 - profile but in this profile nothing is
56:11 - being selected as you scroll down you
56:14 - can see that the different columns are
56:15 - being shown over here so suppose I want
56:18 - to show the segment I can just click on
56:20 - segment and the values or the data
56:21 - profile or segment would be shown over
56:23 - here
56:24 - so here you can see the segment it has
56:27 - three unique values uh consumer home
56:30 - office are the two values and the third
56:32 - value as you can see is the corporate
56:34 - segment so the data profile of two uh
56:37 - columns are being shown over here using
56:39 - the browse tools simultaneously so
56:41 - that's all about the browse tool that
56:43 - you need to know in this video we are
56:46 - going to talk about data manipulation
56:48 - and output tool in altrex
56:52 - so as we know that altrex is a tool that
56:55 - is used for the purposes of data
56:57 - cleaning as well right so what we are
57:00 - going to do today is actually I am going
57:02 - to show you how to clean the data if
57:05 - inconsistencies are present using the
57:08 - data manipulation tool in altrex okay so
57:11 - this is the sample Superstore data set
57:13 - that we downloaded and as I have already
57:15 - told you that it is a super clean data
57:18 - set there are no inconsistencies in this
57:20 - data set so what I have done is I have
57:22 - introduced an inconsistency
57:25 - and that is in this furniture
57:28 - what I have done is I have actually
57:31 - added some leading white spaces in this
57:34 - category Furniture I have added some
57:36 - leading white spaces now let us add some
57:39 - more in the subcategory field okay so
57:42 - there is this chairs I am just going to
57:43 - replace the stairs value
57:48 - and introduce some leading white spaces
57:51 - so around three white spaces would be
57:53 - good
57:54 - and replace all the values out of here
57:57 - okay so 791 Replacements were made and
58:00 - this is the change that I have done to
58:02 - introduce some inconsistencies into our
58:04 - data set and to see that how can we
58:06 - solve it using ultrix now using Ctrl s
58:08 - let me just save this Excel file and
58:11 - close this Excel file
58:13 - right so let's create a new workflow new
58:15 - workflow 3 over here and uh just
58:19 - import this data set so let's just use
58:22 - this input data
58:24 - and what we're going to do is connect it
58:26 - to a file
58:28 - so this is the data set that we have and
58:31 - the Autos sheet click on okay
58:34 - so now
58:36 - um
58:36 - as you can see there is nothing that's
58:38 - been shown over here let's just start a
58:40 - browse tool now there is another way
58:42 - through adding a browse tool let's you
58:43 - can just right click over here and there
58:46 - is this option add browse after and the
58:48 - shortcut for the same as Ctrl shift B so
58:50 - you can just add it and click on run
58:53 - now once you do that what would happen
58:56 - is uh you would get this kind of a
58:58 - message and
59:00 - of course the records would be shown
59:02 - over here okay so the profiles had been
59:04 - shown over here now the changes we made
59:06 - were in the category okay so let's just
59:09 - see the category and the subcategory
59:11 - right now the changes were made in the
59:13 - category and the subcategory fields now
59:15 - if you just hover over this category
59:16 - field there are few records
59:19 - that are not okay right the red line has
59:22 - been shown over here and
59:24 - um that is around 21.22 records that are
59:27 - not okay in the category field because
59:29 - the inconsistency is there similarly in
59:32 - the subcategory field as well there is
59:34 - 6.17 records uh 6.17 percent records
59:38 - that are not okay represented by red so
59:40 - if you just show the category over here
59:42 - and just split the view
59:45 - so over here we had been shown the
59:47 - category field and here let's just go
59:49 - with the subcategory field
59:51 - so here is the subcategory field okay
59:55 - so now what we get first of all let's
59:57 - take a look at the category field that
59:59 - is uh 7000 some records are okay but
60:03 - 2121 reports are not okay
60:06 - now what is the reason uh that these
60:08 - records are not okay these are the
60:10 - values with leading white space how many
60:12 - values 2121 values okay
60:16 - similarly if we just talk about the
60:17 - subcategory over here so we have 617
60:21 - records that are not okay represented in
60:23 - the red color
60:25 - and what is the issue the issue is the
60:28 - values with the leading white space so
60:30 - these are some of the inconsistencies
60:31 - that would be shown into your data
60:33 - profile only okay so how do we uh just
60:36 - get rid of these inconsistencies right
60:39 - so what you need to do is search for
60:41 - that particular column over here here as
60:44 - well you can see that the mark of not
60:46 - okay is being shown over here
60:48 - represented by red and the rest is green
60:50 - in category and subcategory Fields okay
60:52 - in the output Pane and the values that
60:55 - are inconsistent have been marked as
60:57 - read and the message is the cell has
60:59 - leading spaces the cell has leading
61:01 - spaces so whatever the inconsistency is
61:03 - it's been automatically shown to you by
61:06 - altrex now how do we manipulate it how
61:08 - do we clean it you need to select the
61:10 - column which has inconsistency click on
61:12 - these three dots here we have the option
61:14 - of data cleanse so you can just go to
61:19 - this data cleanse option just a second
61:24 - and here we have remove unwanted
61:25 - characters and in the remove unwanted
61:28 - characters the first option is leading
61:30 - slash trailing white space so that means
61:32 - any of the leading or the trailing white
61:34 - spaces if there would be removed so just
61:37 - select that option and click on apply
61:39 - now it's going to take a few seconds and
61:42 - the changes would be applied now once
61:45 - the changes have been applied you can
61:46 - see the red mark in the category has
61:47 - gone from here uh we can see them all
61:50 - correctly the furniture leading spaces
61:52 - have been removed if you want to cross
61:54 - check it uh let's just bring up the
61:56 - category field once again
62:00 - here
62:02 - so if you see right now okay is changed
62:05 - to a hundred percent
62:06 - similarly we can do the same thing for
62:09 - the subcategory field as well we can go
62:11 - to subcategory data cleanse remove
62:12 - unbounded characters leading trailing
62:14 - white space and click on apply now again
62:17 - it's going to take a few seconds and the
62:19 - changes would be applied
62:23 - in order to cross check it you can just
62:25 - go to subcategory option over here and
62:28 - the OK has been changed to 100 now again
62:31 - run the workflow
62:36 - so if you again run the workflow the
62:38 - inconsistencies would be uh introduced
62:40 - once again and why is that because
62:43 - now what we are getting is we are again
62:45 - getting the data from input that means
62:47 - altrex only makes changes into the
62:50 - format of the data that is brought in
62:52 - front of it not on the original files
62:53 - okay
62:54 - so that's why using the browse tool the
62:57 - changes that have been made are only
62:58 - made onto this data that has been used
63:01 - in altrex right now once we have changed
63:04 - the data what we need to do is actually
63:06 - make use of this data right
63:09 - so what I'm going to do is output this
63:12 - data into an Excel file but not on to a
63:16 - single sheet into multiple sheets
63:18 - so how do we do that for this we use the
63:21 - output data tool of this in out category
63:25 - so output data tool let's just bring it
63:26 - up now what I'm going to do with this
63:29 - output data tool is
63:31 - I am going to select the category as the
63:33 - criteria
63:34 - so what I'm going to do or what I'm
63:37 - planning to do is actually use
63:40 - this category over here uh to Output the
63:44 - data
63:45 - or basically use a segment to Output the
63:48 - data
63:51 - uh so what would happen is
63:54 - all the datas
63:55 - uh all three separate sheets would be
63:59 - created right so
64:02 - uh if you just apply this segment if you
64:05 - just take a look at the segment field
64:09 - just a second
64:14 - okay so now if we take a look at this
64:16 - segment then what we are getting is that
64:18 - there are three unique values so that
64:20 - means three different sheets would be
64:21 - created in the Excel file so for this
64:24 - what we need to do is go to this output
64:25 - Tool uh click on this Arrow here and go
64:29 - to files and select files so basically
64:32 - we are selecting the location where our
64:33 - file needs to be saved now provide a
64:36 - name for the file let's say output
64:40 - Excel
64:42 - okay and make sure that in the save as
64:45 - type it is selected as an Excel file or
64:49 - a Microsoft Excel with extension XLS or
64:53 - xlsx because then only you would be able
64:56 - to create multiple sheets in case you
64:59 - decide to save it as an altrex database
65:01 - so multiple sheets in that case is not
65:03 - possible okay
65:04 - click on Save
65:06 - now it would ask you to specify the name
65:09 - of a sheet we can just go with sheet 1
65:11 - and click on OK right
65:13 - uh
65:15 - now what would happen is
65:18 - if you just click on this tool here we
65:21 - have this configuration panel in this
65:22 - you need to just check this option that
65:24 - is take file slash table name from field
65:28 - then there is this drop down from this
65:30 - drop down you have to select the third
65:32 - option which is change file slash table
65:34 - name
65:35 - now what would happen is this would
65:36 - allow you to select the column on the
65:39 - basis of which you want to create
65:40 - different sheets right so uh here we can
65:45 - just use the drop down to select p
65:47 - value and that is a segment so you can
65:50 - just select the segment
65:52 - once you have done all the steps then
65:54 - you need to use this control r or run
65:57 - button to just run the workflow
65:59 - then you can see that the dialog box
66:03 - would be there showing the time taken
66:06 - and if you just click on this messages
66:08 - or that is this three hamburger menu
66:11 - over here you will see that these three
66:13 - sheets were created consumer corporate
66:15 - and the home office sheets and the
66:17 - number of records that were written into
66:20 - each of these sheets to cross check what
66:22 - you can do is go to that particular
66:24 - folder which was present in my desktop
66:26 - here output Excel the Excel sheet that
66:29 - has been created
66:31 - and you can see that there are three
66:33 - sheets that are available
66:35 - the consumer sheet the corporate sheet
66:37 - and the home office sheet now each of
66:39 - these sheets has the data that is split
66:42 - according to their segments all the home
66:44 - office data in the sheet all the
66:45 - corporate data in this sheet and all the
66:47 - consumer data in this sheet so this is
66:49 - how the output tool in altrex works the
66:52 - output data tool is used to Output the
66:54 - multiple Excel sheets so in this video
66:57 - we are going to take a look at the few
66:59 - tools of this in out configuration
67:03 - so the first tool that we are going to
67:04 - look at is the directory tool so the
67:07 - directory tool is used to return a list
67:09 - of all the files that are present in the
67:11 - specified directory
67:13 - it Returns the file name and other
67:15 - information about each file like its
67:18 - size the date it was created the last
67:21 - modified date and many more information
67:22 - okay so let's see how do we use it first
67:26 - of all grab the directory tool
67:29 - tab into your workflow workspace then
67:32 - what you need to do is in this
67:34 - configuration tab you have to specify
67:35 - the directory of the folder from where
67:37 - you want to get the files okay so in my
67:39 - case I have already specified the folder
67:41 - that is this files folder in the altrex
67:45 - click on ok now if you want specific
67:48 - files to be there only then you can
67:50 - specify the files otherwise uh this
67:53 - asterisk is over here that means uh any
67:56 - of the files any of the file names dot
67:58 - any of the file extensions would be
68:00 - taken
68:01 - if you want to um include the
68:04 - subdirectories like if you want to
68:06 - search for the specified file types in
68:08 - directories that are specified within
68:10 - the specified directory then this box
68:13 - um is checked otherwise leave it
68:15 - unchecked okay
68:17 - it's only for the specific price but we
68:19 - are going for the generic ones so no
68:20 - need to include the subdirectories let's
68:22 - just click on run
68:24 - so what would happen is uh you would get
68:26 - this kind of an output that is the list
68:29 - of all of these uh
68:31 - files that are present in this directory
68:33 - the full path the directory the name of
68:36 - the file along with its extension
68:39 - the creation time the time when it was
68:43 - last access last written the size
68:47 - and some of the attributes like it is it
68:50 - encrypted is it compressed is it
68:52 - archived is it hidden is it normal uh is
68:56 - it offline is it read-only uh and so on
69:00 - so these are all the fields that we
69:02 - would be getting so this is for the
69:04 - generic files let us now search for the
69:06 - specific files
69:07 - okay so we are going with the extension
69:10 - as you can see yxmd files are present
69:12 - over here so instead of
69:14 - all the files y x MD files are the only
69:18 - ones that I am interested in right now
69:20 - and in the subdirectories as well then
69:22 - click on run
69:24 - so what I would be getting is
69:27 - only the Y X MD file so there are a
69:29 - total of seven YX MD files in the
69:31 - subdirectories and the directory of this
69:33 - particular folder so this is what I am
69:35 - getting through the directory tool
69:38 - right let's just click Ctrl s to save it
69:42 - next tool that we have is the date time
69:44 - tool so as we have discussed about the
69:47 - date time already uh in the data types
69:51 - video in altrex so this date time now
69:55 - tool is used to return a single record
69:57 - that is the date or the time at the time
70:01 - when the workflow was run
70:03 - and you can just convert the value into
70:05 - the string format of your choosing so
70:07 - basically this is useful that once you
70:10 - are creating a new report and you want
70:12 - to show the date or the time of its
70:15 - creation then you can use this
70:17 - particular tool okay so let's just bring
70:19 - in this tool this is the daytime now
70:21 - tool
70:22 - over here it requires us to specify two
70:25 - things the language in which we want the
70:27 - date and time and the format and which
70:28 - we want that is the output format so
70:30 - let's just get the
70:33 - format like this where I am getting the
70:35 - date as well as the time now click on
70:38 - run or use the shortcut Ctrl R so we
70:41 - would be getting a column with today's
70:43 - date and the time at which this was run
70:46 - okay
70:47 - now in case you decide to change the
70:49 - language right now I have taken English
70:51 - but let me just go with Spanish Okay
70:53 - click on OK and now what we are getting
70:57 - is the same output but to get a
71:00 - different output let's just choose a
71:01 - different format like this
71:04 - click on run
71:05 - and now what we are getting is a
71:07 - different format like the month name is
71:09 - in Spanish right now
71:11 - so this is what we are getting this is
71:13 - the usage of the um date time now tool
71:17 - let's just press Ctrl s to save it and
71:20 - move on to the next tool which is the
71:22 - text input tool now what is the usage of
71:24 - this text input tool
71:26 - uh it is used to manually enter the text
71:29 - to create small data files for input it
71:33 - can be useful in like testing and
71:36 - creating the lookup tables while we are
71:38 - building the workflow the data input
71:41 - from the text input tool saves within
71:43 - the workflow so you can share the
71:44 - workflow without having to provide an
71:46 - input file okay
71:48 - so let's see how do we work with it uh
71:50 - first of all let's just get this input
71:52 - data that is this text input tool
71:54 - over here now once we have got it over
71:57 - here we would be getting these different
71:58 - options like this is the option to
72:00 - import if you want to import any of the
72:02 - files but treat it as the input that has
72:05 - been manually taken into the workflow so
72:07 - when we share the workflow the file gets
72:10 - shared as well we do not have to
72:11 - externally show the file right then we
72:14 - have the copy once we have entered the
72:16 - values if you want to copy it if you
72:17 - have already copied the values from
72:19 - somewhere and just want to paste it over
72:21 - here that's the spaced option you can
72:23 - use the delete and the insert options
72:25 - are there as well so delete is to delete
72:27 - any of the data Labs existing and insert
72:29 - to insert the columns so let's just
72:31 - insert a row first of all
72:34 - so this is the row that's been inserted
72:35 - if you just double click over here you
72:37 - can start adding the values so what I'm
72:40 - going to add is name let's say Sameer
72:43 - then I'm going to add a value
72:45 - let's say 12 and then I'm going to add a
72:48 - CD let's say delete okay so this is my
72:51 - first value that I have entered great
72:53 - similarly I can add another value let's
72:55 - say
72:58 - a name a value and a city
73:02 - show Mumbai okay so this is how I can
73:07 - keep on adding the records manually
73:09 - these are the field names right now
73:11 - taken as field one field two and field
73:13 - three but if you want you can change
73:15 - them as well by double clicking on them
73:17 - so the first field name is going to be
73:19 - name
73:20 - the second one is going to be age and
73:23 - the third one is going to be City okay
73:26 - so this is the record that I have got if
73:29 - I just click on run then what would be
73:31 - getting is this uh hold record in the
73:33 - form of a table like this now let's just
73:37 - see how the import function works so
73:38 - let's just click on import this is the
73:40 - sheet Excel sheet that I want to import
73:42 - this is the one that we just exported
73:45 - uh in the form of an Excel file so the
73:47 - consumer one is what I'm going to import
73:49 - so uh 10 000 is the sell limit for this
73:52 - tool so that's when the whole sheet was
73:55 - not imported but I'm happy with it let's
73:57 - just click on run
73:58 - now once we do that
74:00 - this whole table is actually a part of
74:05 - this
74:06 - tool this input tool okay a text input
74:10 - tool now this means there is no external
74:13 - file being associated with this if you
74:15 - just delete the Excel file then also
74:17 - there would be no change in altrex
74:19 - because altrex has created a copy using
74:21 - the text input tool of this particular
74:23 - data set so
74:24 - this is uh the importance of the text
74:27 - input tool over the normal input data
74:30 - tool that we were using up till now but
74:33 - there is an added disadvantage as well
74:34 - because in this case altrex create
74:37 - another memory of itself to store this
74:39 - data so there would be an additional
74:42 - memory requirement so it depends upon
74:43 - you and the requirement of the
74:46 - particular workflow that whether you
74:49 - want to use the text input tool or the
74:51 - input data tool okay
74:53 - now let's uh save it yeah in case you
74:57 - want to delete it suppose I just don't
74:58 - want this order ID column so delete the
75:01 - columns so you can just select the
75:02 - column and delete it if you want to
75:05 - select uh delete a particular role like
75:07 - I want to delete this row number six
75:10 - delete row so the row number six has
75:12 - been deleted okay
75:13 - so this is how the things work in the
75:15 - text input tool you can actually make
75:17 - changes into the data set as well
75:19 - without affecting the original Excel
75:21 - file
75:22 - uh you can copy it and if I just open up
75:25 - my notepad
75:28 - I would be able to paste it as well
75:30 - like six was selected so this was being
75:32 - copied you want to select multiple
75:34 - records like this
75:37 - and copy them
75:39 - then go to notepad
75:41 - and paste them so you would be able to
75:43 - create a copy for them for yourself as
75:45 - well okay
75:47 - let's remove it right now so that's
75:49 - about the text input tool that you need
75:51 - to know now let us talk about the map
75:53 - input tool which is the final tool in
75:56 - this particular group so what is the map
75:58 - input tool as you can see the name
76:01 - itself is suggesting
76:04 - it is used to draw or select the desired
76:06 - map object to use as an input in a
76:09 - workflow you can either draw or select a
76:12 - point line or polygon to form a map that
76:14 - displays a reference base map okay so
76:17 - let's just get this tool map input tool
76:19 - over here and as soon as we get there uh
76:22 - there would be a map you can just select
76:24 - the base map right now it's selected to
76:26 - none
76:27 - let's say select altered stock so you'd
76:29 - be getting a map you can hover over it
76:31 - uh to just you know load any of the
76:34 - countries or the continents that you
76:35 - like so I'm just going to go all the way
76:38 - to India using the zoom buttons you can
76:41 - zoom in or zoom out
76:43 - and get a location let's say kanpur
76:47 - and here I want to point to kanpur so uh
76:50 - right now as you can see the mode has
76:52 - been set to draw so I can draw anything
76:53 - so we can just get a point to draw it on
76:56 - kanbur over here
76:58 - and if you want to provide it a name so
77:01 - let me just provide it a name as home
77:03 - click on Save
77:05 - and that's it you can click on run to
77:07 - run the workflow so what we'll do is it
77:09 - will create this kind of a value for you
77:12 - the label is home and the spatial object
77:14 - is Point View browse tool map tab so the
77:18 - spatial object has been created using
77:20 - the map input
77:22 - hello everyone welcome back to the
77:23 - altrex tutorials in this video we are
77:26 - going to talk about a few tools from the
77:28 - preparation tab in altrex so first of
77:32 - all we have discussed the tools of the
77:34 - in-out tab that means the tools that
77:36 - would be handy when we are importing the
77:39 - data or exporting it now once we have
77:42 - imported the data we may need to perform
77:44 - some manipulations over the data so we
77:46 - would be looking at the tools that would
77:48 - help us to do the exact same thing the
77:51 - preparation tools okay
77:53 - so first tool that we are going to look
77:55 - for is the auto field tool the autofill
77:58 - tool we have already discussed in the
78:00 - data types video that it is used to read
78:03 - through all of the records of an input
78:05 - and set the field type to the smallest
78:07 - possible size that is relative to the
78:09 - data contained in the column so what we
78:12 - are going to do is in this particular
78:14 - video see the practical application of
78:16 - the auto field tool so first of all what
78:18 - I have done is I have already input the
78:21 - data
78:22 - using the input data tool so because
78:26 - this is the step that we have done
78:27 - multiple times till now so we do not
78:30 - need to again see it next I have
78:33 - cleansed this data like in the
78:35 - subcategory there were some of the
78:37 - trailing white spaces so I have cleaned
78:39 - it and let me just show you how to clean
78:42 - it real quick the use of this data
78:44 - cleansing tool so let me just remove
78:46 - this tool once
78:48 - from here now how can you clean the data
78:51 - is you can just bring in the data
78:53 - cleansing tool or what you can do is
78:55 - wait for um altrex to automatically
78:58 - bring it in okay so let's see how to do
79:00 - that so first of all uh you have
79:02 - imported the data then you need to just
79:04 - search for the inconsistent blocks that
79:06 - is the subcategory go on to these three
79:08 - dots click on data cleanse remove
79:10 - unwanted characters leading slash
79:12 - trailing white space click on apply now
79:15 - once the changes have been applied click
79:16 - on this green tick icon that's okay so
79:19 - now the changes would be applied and you
79:22 - would see the data cleansing tool has
79:23 - been brought in automatically okay
79:26 - now its configuration panel is also
79:28 - present there which you can use to
79:30 - further clean the values but
79:33 - now our data is clean so we won't be
79:35 - using it anymore right the next thing we
79:38 - are going to do is use the auto field
79:40 - tool
79:41 - so let's just bring in the autofill tool
79:43 - over here now if you see the data
79:46 - preparation tools all have two anchors
79:48 - the input anchor and the output angle
79:50 - the input anchor is used to take the
79:52 - input data and the output anchor is used
79:54 - to present it further okay
79:56 - so this is the autofill tool as soon as
79:59 - I brought it up there is this
80:00 - configuration panel now here I can
80:02 - select the values through which you want
80:04 - to change the field type okay let's just
80:06 - clear all the values and select only
80:08 - category subcategory and segment from
80:11 - here now once we have selected these
80:13 - fields click on run
80:15 - now what we'll do is it would show us
80:17 - the message box that's okay
80:20 - now let's just see the messages that
80:22 - would actually tell us what changes it
80:25 - had made so uh the field type of segment
80:28 - has been changed to string for eight
80:30 - characters field type of category change
80:32 - to string of 15 directors and the other
80:35 - subcategory to string of 11 characters
80:36 - so this is uh what the change is made by
80:40 - the auto field tool the uh
80:45 - the changes that it has made in these
80:47 - three Fields is being shown to us in
80:48 - case we select all these fields let's
80:50 - select all and click on Run for the
80:52 - autofill tool so what we would be
80:54 - getting is
80:57 - again go to the messages so uh we would
81:00 - be getting that what Fields it has
81:02 - changed to the all these records okay so
81:05 - you can see some of them have been
81:06 - changed to string some of them to
81:07 - variable string and so on like this it
81:10 - has made the changes automatically so
81:13 - this is the use of the auto field tool
81:15 - and the data cleansing tool in the
81:17 - preparation tab now uh let's just save
81:20 - this using Ctrl s
81:22 - and move on to the next tool that is the
81:24 - filter tool so filter tool as the name
81:27 - suggests is used to select the data
81:30 - paste on a particular condition uh the
81:33 - rows of the data that make the condition
81:35 - are output to the
81:37 - uh
81:38 - screen in the form of a true anchor and
81:41 - those that do not meet the criteria are
81:43 - output in the form of a false anchor so
81:46 - if we just bring up this filter tool
81:48 - over here you can see it has three
81:50 - anchors the input anchor and in the
81:52 - output it has two anchors the true
81:54 - anchor and the false anchor so we
81:56 - specify a base condition and if the data
81:58 - meets the base condition then it goes
82:00 - into the true anchor otherwise it goes
82:03 - into the false anchor okay so let's see
82:05 - with the example let's click on this
82:07 - filter tool
82:08 - over here so this kind of a
82:10 - configuration box would be there now
82:12 - there are two kinds of filters that we
82:14 - can apply the basic filter or the custom
82:16 - filter in the case of the basic filter
82:18 - we can specify the basic information
82:19 - like if the um
82:22 - criteria is being matched or not if you
82:26 - want to apply some complex operations
82:28 - then we use the custom filters custom
82:30 - filters allow us to add functionalities
82:33 - to add mathematical functions the
82:36 - Boolean values the if else statements
82:38 - and many more things which we would be
82:40 - of course seeing one by one but first of
82:42 - all let's take a look at the basic
82:44 - filter
82:45 - so if you remember we had a column
82:47 - called category
82:49 - in this we had some categories like the
82:51 - furniture technology and the officer
82:53 - place so what I'm going to do is I'm
82:56 - going to assign the Furnitures
82:58 - separately that means all the categories
83:00 - where Financial is the category it would
83:02 - be assigned to a true value right so
83:05 - from the basic filter let's just select
83:06 - the column the column name is going to
83:08 - be the category column and equals let's
83:12 - just type in the value furniture
83:15 - okay now once you have typed it you can
83:18 - just click on run
83:19 - to run the workflow and then you would
83:22 - see that
83:24 - okay
83:26 - we have two anchors the true anchor if
83:28 - you just hover over it it would give you
83:30 - the category furniture and then we have
83:32 - is the false anchor for the category
83:34 - Furniture okay
83:36 - now here are all the records that are
83:37 - being displayed in the output panel for
83:39 - the True Value here you can see this is
83:40 - the true value being shown there are a
83:43 - one thousand one hundred and thirteen
83:46 - records that belong to the category
83:48 - Furniture okay so if you hover over it
83:51 - the category here is Furniture Only
83:52 - Furniture
83:54 - all the way Furniture but if you go to
83:56 - the false value then what we have is the
83:59 - category technology and officer place
84:02 - right let's just add another filter and
84:04 - go over here into the false part
84:07 - where what we would be doing is adding
84:09 - another base filter on the basis of the
84:11 - category let's just select the category
84:13 - again
84:15 - and it must be equal to technology
84:18 - technology
84:21 - over here okay click on run
84:26 - and here
84:28 - so now we again have these true false
84:31 - values for this so in the true there
84:33 - would be the technology values
84:35 - and in the false there would be the
84:37 - office supplies values so this is how we
84:39 - have used the basic filter tool to
84:42 - actually create three separate uh values
84:46 - for these like the furniture categories
84:48 - are separate the technology is separate
84:51 - and the office supplies is now separate
84:52 - in the separate records okay so this is
84:54 - how the basic filter is being used now
84:57 - what I'm going to do is just I'm gonna
84:59 - copy these two fields or these two tools
85:01 - that is the input tool and the data
85:03 - cleansing tool into a new workflow
85:06 - and show you the demonstration of the uh
85:10 - filter tool for the custom filter okay
85:13 - so let's just bring in our tool over
85:16 - here connect it
85:19 - and here let's just select a custom
85:21 - filter right so here is the effects
85:23 - which you can use to apply any of these
85:26 - conditions or any of these functions
85:28 - like you want to convert it
85:31 - right or you want to perform any kind of
85:34 - a manipulation over here you want to
85:37 - apply any of the conditional statements
85:39 - if you want to
85:41 - allow any daytime applications any of
85:44 - the file applications that you can do
85:47 - over here like the string functions
85:51 - so let's just use the count Words
85:53 - so I basically needed to count the words
85:56 - okay and then from this x you can just
85:58 - select the existing columns so I want it
86:01 - to select the count words for the city
86:03 - click on run
86:07 - and then
86:11 - uh it's going to give you the values for
86:15 - of course there won't be any false
86:17 - values right now because there could not
86:19 - be any false values for the count
86:20 - function
86:24 - the count of the calories of this city
86:27 - right
86:31 - or basically what we can do is actually
86:34 - use any kind of a basic filter like
86:37 - let's say if the profit
86:39 - is greater than equal to one
86:42 - so that would be a profit rate so we
86:45 - have written a basic filter query but if
86:47 - you want to see how it is looking in the
86:49 - custom filter there you can apply it
86:50 - profit is greater than equal to 1. now
86:53 - if you just run it
86:55 - what you would be getting is In the two
86:56 - values the true and the false values so
86:59 - that means the records where we are
87:01 - getting a profit and the records where
87:02 - we are getting a loss in the case of the
87:04 - true are the ones where we are getting a
87:06 - profit here you can see all of these
87:07 - values we are getting a profit but in
87:10 - these values we are getting a loss and
87:12 - see this is a loss okay so we just go to
87:15 - the messages
87:16 - um
87:17 - you would get that in the 4008 records
87:20 - there were the True Values that means
87:21 - there is where we are getting a profit
87:24 - and the remaining 1183 values return
87:26 - false that means these are the values
87:29 - where we are getting a loss so this is
87:31 - the usage of the filter tool in altrex
87:35 - and this is how we use it so that's all
87:37 - for this video thanks for watching
87:40 - hello everyone welcome back to the
87:42 - altrex tutorials in this video we are
87:45 - going to discuss about some more uh
87:47 - tools that are present in the data
87:49 - preparation group in Excel
87:51 - in altrex so the first tool that we are
87:54 - going to look in this is the formula
87:56 - tool so the formula tool is actually
87:59 - used to create new columns uh update the
88:02 - columns or use the Expressions to
88:05 - perform a variety of the calculations on
88:08 - the already existing values that are
88:11 - present in the columns okay so we can
88:15 - use it to apply conditional statements
88:17 - convert the data type from one to
88:20 - another format the dates extract file
88:23 - paths apply algorithms clean the data
88:26 - apply the validations or perform the
88:30 - tests Etc okay so let us see how are we
88:33 - going to use this formula tool
88:36 - so right now I have got the same data
88:39 - set that is the consumer sheet from the
88:42 - sample store data set okay and I have
88:45 - cleansed it
88:47 - that is removed the inconsistencies now
88:49 - let's just bring up our formula tool
88:52 - to here
88:54 - and in this what I'm going to do is uh
88:56 - in the configuration panel I have two
88:58 - options either I can just select a
89:01 - column and that data would be
89:03 - overwritten or I can add a new column so
89:05 - what I'm going to do is I'm actually I'm
89:08 - going to add a new column so add a
89:10 - column and then you go to specify the
89:12 - name of the column so that's going to be
89:15 - profit slash loss okay
89:20 - and here what I'm going to do is apply a
89:23 - conditional statement that
89:26 - uh
89:28 - this conditional statement
89:31 - if the value of the profit so for
89:34 - getting the column names we can simply
89:36 - just use a square bracket so we have the
89:39 - profit value over here
89:42 - if the profit value is greater than
89:45 - equals to 0 then
89:47 - the value in this column is going to be
89:50 - profit
89:52 - else it is going to be loss okay
89:56 - like this and whatever the text for
89:58 - Value you want you need to just write it
90:00 - in the single quotes okay
90:03 - so the size we can just specify over
90:06 - here it's going to be the data type you
90:08 - can check is
90:10 - going to be the variable string and
90:13 - click on run
90:16 - now it's going to take a few seconds 1.6
90:19 - seconds to be precise
90:20 - and as you can see
90:23 - uh we should be getting a new column
90:26 - over here
90:30 - and here on the very last uh you can see
90:33 - the column profit and loss if the values
90:36 - are positive then we are getting the
90:38 - value profit if it is negative then we
90:40 - are getting the value loss okay
90:43 - uh so here is a warning in the profit
90:45 - that
90:46 - the there was a large value over here
90:49 - but it has been rounded up by altrex for
90:51 - clarity okay so that's why the
90:53 - parade
90:55 - um it's been shown over here the red
90:57 - Mark has been shown over here so this is
90:59 - one way of using the formula tool right
91:02 - um just like this you can actually make
91:05 - changes into the existing data like um
91:10 - right now if you just don't want to add
91:13 - an extra column so we want to apply
91:15 - another formula
91:16 - and the thing is that I want to get the
91:21 - profit and the loss the same thing but
91:23 - in this column only that is the value
91:26 - that is showing me profit in that value
91:28 - only I want this to happen so I can just
91:30 - select the column and here I'm just
91:33 - going to select the profit column okay
91:35 - now if I just click on run then what
91:37 - would happen is the values in that
91:39 - particular column would be overwritten
91:43 - okay so there is an error
91:46 - uh the thing is that we wanted string
91:49 - value but the field is numeric so that's
91:51 - why it's not happening so let me just
91:52 - change it a little bit
91:55 - that is
91:57 - over here
91:59 - if there is a profit then I want 100 to
92:02 - be written over there
92:04 - else I want zero to be written over here
92:07 - okay or I can just actually you know
92:11 - uh change its data type as well like
92:15 - it's double so 100 and 0 would be okay
92:17 - let's click on run
92:21 - now if you just go to this output panel
92:25 - and here we have only two values hundred
92:27 - and zero hundred and zero so this is how
92:29 - you can actually update the existing
92:31 - values or create a new column now in
92:34 - case you want to remove any formula you
92:36 - can just go to that formula and here is
92:38 - this delete button you can just delete
92:39 - that
92:40 - and now if you again run it then the
92:43 - changes that were made initially would
92:46 - be overwritten and you would be getting
92:47 - the original values of the profit that
92:50 - were present in the call so this is how
92:52 - we work with the formula tool
92:54 - to either add new columns or update the
92:57 - existing volumes right
92:59 - next tool that we are going to talk
93:00 - about is the sample tool so let's just
93:03 - go to the sample tool now what is the
93:05 - sample tool it is used to limit the data
93:08 - stream to a specified number percentage
93:10 - or a random set of rows uh also if you
93:14 - want a selected configuration to the
93:16 - columns so
93:18 - to be applied you can group The Columns
93:20 - using the sample tool so let's just get
93:22 - the sample tool over here
93:25 - and as soon as we get it this is the
93:27 - configuration panel that we are getting
93:28 - the first option is the first n rows uh
93:32 - it returns every Row in the data from
93:34 - the beginning to the data through the
93:36 - value of n like you can specify a value
93:38 - of n here you can see right now if you
93:40 - just run it so it would return the first
93:43 - 100 rows as you can see first 100 has
93:45 - been shown over here because the value
93:46 - of n was 100 but if we just set it to
93:49 - 10.
93:50 - and then run it so what will I do is it
93:54 - would just show you the first 10 rows
93:56 - okay so you can set the value of n next
93:59 - option is last and row switch of course
94:01 - is used to show us the last n rows the
94:06 - value of n which you can specify as per
94:08 - your wish
94:09 - next is Skip first n rows which returns
94:13 - all the rows in the data that start
94:16 - after the specified number of rows
94:18 - next we have one of every n rows that
94:21 - means return the first row of every
94:23 - group of n rows like if I just select 10
94:26 - so the whole record would be uh split
94:30 - into groups of 10 and the first row in
94:33 - each group would be returned to me so if
94:35 - you just run it
94:38 - then we would be able to see the changes
94:40 - like
94:42 - through this row ID like 1 10 12 10 26
94:45 - then 48 this is how the rows are being
94:47 - returned to me okay
94:49 - next is one inch one in N chance to
94:52 - include each row that means it would
94:55 - return randomly it would randomly
94:58 - determine if each row is included in the
95:00 - sample or not so the random values are
95:03 - being returned to me as you can see from
95:06 - the row ID itself 11 then 20 then 21
95:09 - randomly the rows are being return to me
95:12 - okay
95:14 - so um
95:15 - then we have the first n percent of rows
95:19 - that means it Returns the N percent in
95:22 - this case the 10 of rows it requires the
95:25 - data to pass through the tool twice like
95:28 - once we calculate the count of rows and
95:30 - then to return the specified percent of
95:32 - rows
95:33 - okay then we can just run it to get the
95:35 - N percent of rows that's the 10 percent
95:37 - of the rows are of the total values okay
95:40 - so there were around 5000 or 191 records
95:44 - so 5 19 records that's the 10 of the
95:46 - records have been displayed over here
95:48 - okay next we have is the group by option
95:51 - so if you want to group it uh on the
95:53 - basis of some column that you can do
95:55 - let's just group it by category
95:58 - and
96:00 - just get the first 10 rows to be grouped
96:02 - by category we can click on run
96:05 - so this is what we would be getting in
96:07 - the output
96:10 - okay
96:12 - so Furniture categories then the office
96:14 - supplies categories and the technology
96:15 - categories have been used to group by
96:17 - the values so this is how the sample
96:20 - tool works for us
96:23 - uh
96:24 - next we have is the sort tool so the
96:29 - sort tool is actually uh very important
96:32 - and as the name suggests it is used to
96:34 - sort the data so
96:37 - um let's see how it works it actually
96:39 - takes two things into consideration
96:42 - let's just get the sort tool over here
96:45 - it takes two things into consideration
96:47 - the name and the order so basically uh
96:51 - any of the name
96:53 - of the field that you want to sort and
96:56 - in which order you want to sort if in
96:57 - the ascending order of in the descending
96:59 - order okay
97:00 - okay so let's just delete this tool once
97:03 - and let's see how we manually apply it
97:05 - like without using this tool okay so now
97:07 - if we just run this
97:09 - we would be getting our hands on the
97:11 - data set
97:14 - okay
97:17 - so if you want to sort the values like I
97:20 - want to sort it on the basis of the
97:21 - sales so let's just go to the sales
97:23 - column or click on these three dots go
97:27 - to sort and I want to sort it on the
97:29 - base of the ascending order then click
97:31 - on apply
97:32 - so once we do that we can click on this
97:34 - read this green tick button and you
97:38 - would see that it has been applied if
97:40 - you just click on the output
97:43 - actually run the workflow
97:46 - so here is what we would be getting the
97:48 - sorted values
97:50 - like you can see the value have been
97:51 - sorted on the basis of the sales the
97:53 - ascending order the sort tool has
97:56 - already been applied and the name is
97:58 - taken as sales and the order is taken as
98:00 - ascending so this is the usage of the
98:01 - swap tool that's all for this video
98:03 - thanks for watching
98:05 - hello everyone welcome to altrex
98:08 - tutorials in this video we are going to
98:10 - see the three most important tools in
98:14 - the data preparation tab of altrex the
98:16 - first tool that we are going to see is
98:18 - the unique tool as the name suggests
98:21 - unique is used to distinguish that
98:23 - whether a data record is unique or if it
98:26 - is duplicate by grouping on one or more
98:29 - specified Fields then it sorts those
98:33 - fields so if you want some of the fields
98:35 - to be unique then you can simply check
98:37 - it using this unique tool that whether
98:40 - the particular field or particular
98:42 - column is actually containing unique
98:45 - values or not so how can we use it let's
98:48 - just get this tool
98:50 - just like the filter tool we have used
98:52 - the unique tool also has three angles
98:54 - one is the anchor where it gets the data
98:56 - the next two anchors are the unique and
98:58 - the duplicate angles as you can see the
99:00 - U and the D so it basically shows you
99:04 - that which of the values are unique and
99:06 - which of them are not okay now this is
99:09 - the configuration panel from where you
99:11 - can just select the values like I would
99:13 - select the customer name
99:15 - I have one blue check that if the
99:17 - customer is returning to me or not so if
99:20 - I just click on run
99:21 - then
99:23 - okay
99:24 - I'm getting some of the unique values so
99:27 - there are 409 records where the customer
99:29 - name is unique so there are 409 unique
99:32 - customers I'm also getting duplicates
99:34 - that means the customers we have are the
99:37 - returning customers and now all of these
99:40 - values are grouped together as a
99:41 - customer name like first you can see
99:43 - Iron boardsman so the customer uh
99:46 - whatever purchases the customer has made
99:48 - is being grouped together by his name
99:51 - then
99:52 - by the second customer Third customer
99:54 - and so on okay so these are the uni
99:57 - customers the total of 409 customers are
99:59 - there and they're returning to me again
100:00 - and again to purchase a total of a ten
100:03 - thousand uh record items okay so this is
100:06 - what the unique tool helps us to
100:09 - understand about the data now uh you
100:11 - have applied it on one field but if you
100:13 - want you can apply it on multiple feeds
100:15 - like for the category also I want to
100:17 - apply
100:18 - then click on run
100:20 - now what will happen is
100:22 - we would be getting the unique values
100:24 - for
100:26 - uh the combination of both right so now
100:30 - the in the unique value over here the
100:32 - total of 1136 records have been
100:34 - displayed the customer name uh if they
100:37 - have purchased from each of these
100:38 - categories right so in the category
100:40 - there are these three categories
100:42 - Furniture office supply sign technology
100:43 - and the customer name as you can see
100:46 - is same
100:48 - for the three and the remaining are the
100:50 - duplicates which means the customer has
100:52 - made another purchase in the same
100:54 - category of the items so this is the
100:56 - usage of the unique tool okay
100:59 - now let's move on to the next tool that
101:01 - is the imputation tool now what is the
101:04 - imputation tool
101:06 - imputation tool is used to replace a
101:09 - specified value within one or more
101:11 - numeric data fields with another
101:13 - specified value so basically it's used
101:16 - that if your data is inconsistent and
101:18 - contains some of the null values then
101:20 - what you can do is actually clean the
101:22 - data set
101:23 - so you can replace the null values with
101:26 - either the average of the values of that
101:28 - particular column or
101:31 - um basically with any value that you
101:33 - want okay so let's just get the
101:34 - imputation tool to get a better look at
101:37 - how it works
101:38 - over here so here you would get the
101:41 - fields which you want to impute now only
101:43 - the numeric Fields would be there
101:44 - because that's uh what we get for the
101:47 - imputation tool now what value you want
101:49 - to replace if there are null values you
101:51 - can replace those null values but if the
101:53 - null values are not present then you can
101:55 - use a user specified value next we have
101:58 - is the replace with value that is with
102:00 - which value you want to replace it so
102:02 - average that means average of all values
102:04 - not including the incoming values to
102:07 - replace okay so basically the values
102:09 - that are already existing those average
102:11 - would be taken and that would be
102:13 - replaced in place of null values we have
102:15 - a median value that is the value
102:17 - separating the higher half from the
102:18 - lower half or the middle value
102:20 - we have the mode value that the value
102:22 - that appears most often
102:24 - or if you want to use a specified value
102:26 - that you want to replace that you can do
102:28 - okay so what I'm gonna do is actually
102:30 - just work for the quantity part over
102:33 - here since I know that my data set is
102:36 - clean it has no null values so I'm just
102:38 - going to check a user specified value of
102:40 - 7 and I'm going to specify another value
102:44 - for it that is going to be 8. okay
102:46 - that's a minor change that I'm just
102:47 - going to do of course it would be undone
102:50 - because it has no meaning it's just to
102:52 - show you the usage of this tool next we
102:55 - have these two check boxes that is
102:56 - include imputed value in the indicator
102:58 - field that means there would be a field
103:00 - that would be added to specify whether
103:02 - or not a value has been imputed
103:04 - or you want to Output the imputed value
103:06 - in a separate field that means the
103:08 - original field would be as it is but in
103:11 - a separate field the value would be
103:13 - outputted by imputed value okay so first
103:16 - of all let's just select the first
103:17 - option and run it to see how it works
103:21 - here it would take few seconds and then
103:27 - let's just see if it has worked for the
103:30 - quantity
103:31 - so now here we can see that um it's 8
103:34 - and the quantity indicator is showing
103:37 - one that means the change has been made
103:39 - over here and on the rest of the values
103:41 - it's showing 0 again it's showing 1 that
103:44 - means the value was originally 7 but now
103:46 - it has been changed to 8. so this is how
103:49 - the imputed value indicator Field Works
103:51 - next option is the output imputed values
103:53 - as a separate field so we can just
103:55 - select this option and click on run
103:58 - now what would happen is
104:02 - we would be getting a separate value in
104:04 - which the quantity value original field
104:06 - would be as it is like here it was 7 but
104:09 - in the new values the field would a new
104:12 - field the values would be 8 over here
104:14 - from 7 it changed to 8. so this is how
104:17 - the imputation works but uh if the null
104:20 - values are present on your data or if
104:22 - you want to replace of any of the values
104:23 - numeric values only then you can use
104:25 - this imputation tool
104:28 - now last but not the least we have the
104:30 - multi-field binning tool now what is
104:33 - this tool
104:35 - it is actually used to replicate some of
104:38 - the functionality of the Tile tool okay
104:42 - um basically it allows the data to be
104:44 - bent on multiple fields
104:47 - uh mainly it is used for the predictive
104:49 - tool set
104:51 - multi-field billing tool accepts only
104:54 - the numeric Fields just like the
104:56 - imputation tool we have just seen
104:58 - for the purpose of pinning we can bend
105:01 - the fields either in the form of the
105:03 - equal records or equal intervals so what
105:06 - is a bin uh if you just take a look at a
105:10 - histogram let's just bring up a
105:12 - histogram here
105:13 - right so this is a histogram and as you
105:16 - can see it shows the salary
105:19 - and the number of the players so 0 to 10
105:22 - is actually an interval 10 to 20 is an
105:26 - interval right so this is called a bin
105:30 - histogram is depicted using bins and in
105:34 - order to create those bins we are going
105:37 - to use the multi field binning tool in
105:39 - altrex so let's see how it works
105:42 - uh let's just get this
105:45 - over here and it would get all the
105:47 - numeric Fields I'm going to do it on the
105:49 - basis of the sales the number of the
105:52 - tiles or the bins that you want to
105:54 - create so I want to create it 10. uh
105:57 - tiles or the 10 bills now we have uh two
106:00 - options either equal records or equal
106:02 - intervals equal records what it says
106:05 - that the input records are divided into
106:07 - the specified number of pins each bin is
106:09 - assigned to assign the same number of
106:12 - Records okay so the number of Records
106:13 - would be equal in each bin
106:16 - um then we have equal intervals that
106:19 - means the minimum and the maximum values
106:21 - of the selected fields are determined
106:24 - and the records are assigned based upon
106:26 - these ranges so if we go with equal
106:29 - intervals that would be like more
106:31 - appropriate to get a varied length of
106:34 - the histogram
106:35 - then you can click on run
106:39 - so after a few seconds you would be
106:41 - getting
106:42 - this field
106:47 - uh it's on the base of sales rate
106:50 - uh here is the field a sales style num
106:54 - so what is the tile number right now
106:56 - it's one and as you can see this one has
106:59 - a higher sales value of 1706 that's why
107:02 - it's been assigned to tile two and just
107:05 - like this if you just scroll over it you
107:07 - will get some other numbers as well
107:10 - so it's one two one and two and that was
107:14 - five over here
107:15 - it has a higher range of 6000 that's why
107:18 - it's been given a number five so just
107:20 - like this uh we have been our sales
107:23 - records if we just get it into equal
107:25 - number of records and click on run so uh
107:28 - the records would be given
107:30 - two different bins
107:32 - equally like as you can see the
107:34 - different bins have been assigned
107:37 - the different brains have been assigned
107:39 - to each of these sales values okay
107:41 - so as you have specified 10 so the 10
107:45 - tiles have been created and the maximum
107:47 - of a thousand tiles we can create
107:49 - so any number between
107:51 - 1 to 999 is acceptable so this is the
107:54 - function of the multi-filled binning
107:56 - tool and these are all the major tools
107:59 - that you need to know about in the
108:01 - preparation group in altrex that's all
108:03 - for this video and that's all for the
108:05 - preparation Tools in altrex in the next
108:08 - video we would be looking at the other
108:10 - group which is the join group that's all
108:12 - for this video thanks for watching
108:15 - foreign
108:17 - welcome to altrex tutorials in this
108:20 - video we are going to take a look at
108:22 - some of the tools that are present in
108:25 - the join tab of the altrex tools in the
108:28 - previous videos we have already seen the
108:30 - in-out tab and the preparation Tab and
108:33 - their individual tools that are going to
108:35 - be useful for us while preparing the
108:38 - workflows in altrex in this video we are
108:41 - going to start a new tab that is the
108:43 - join tab so without any further Ado let
108:45 - us start with the video in this video we
108:48 - are going to talk about a very special
108:50 - tool known as the append Fields tool
108:52 - this append Fields tool is present in
108:54 - the join tab as you can see denoted by a
108:57 - purple color
108:58 - now before starting with this tool what
109:00 - I have already done is I have already
109:02 - input my data that is the sample
109:06 - Superstore data
109:07 - and from that data set I have taken the
109:10 - orders sheet in case you don't know
109:12 - where to get this data from you can
109:14 - simply Google sample Superstore Excel
109:16 - and that data site would be downloaded
109:18 - for you the reason why we are choosing
109:20 - this data site is because it is having a
109:23 - wide variety of data ranging from text
109:24 - to numbers to location everything that
109:27 - one could ask for furthermore the data
109:29 - set is completely clean there are no
109:31 - inconsistencies so it would be easier
109:33 - for us to work on it and
109:36 - once you have downloaded the data set
109:38 - using the input tool you can simply just
109:40 - input the data then I have used two data
109:43 - cleansing tools which are in the
109:46 - preparation tab to clean the data
109:48 - now in case you are wondering what I
109:51 - have done over here I recommend you to
109:52 - just go through the previous videos
109:54 - where I've explained this process in a
109:56 - step-by-step fashion now once we have
109:58 - done with all this let us just go back
110:00 - to our append Fields tool and bring it
110:02 - up over here
110:03 - as you can see the append Fields tool
110:05 - has two anchors on the input that is T
110:08 - and S
110:10 - uh T stands for Target and S stands for
110:13 - source and there is one output anchor so
110:15 - let us understand first of all what is
110:17 - this tool all about a pen Fields tool is
110:20 - used to append the fields of one small
110:22 - input which is taken as a source denoted
110:24 - by the S over here to every record of
110:27 - another larger input that is the target
110:30 - the result is a Cartesian join now in a
110:33 - Cartesian join every Row from one table
110:35 - is joined to every row of the other
110:37 - table like if there are two tables a
110:40 - table one has like 100 rows and table
110:42 - two has thousand rows so the Cartesian
110:44 - join would be hundred into thousand that
110:46 - is a hundred thousand rows in total
110:49 - so this is what happens in the Cartesian
110:51 - joint and in case you want to perform a
110:53 - Cartesian join on your tables then you
110:55 - can use this append Fields option okay
110:57 - the append field tool accepts two inputs
111:00 - which is again a Target and a source the
111:02 - target is a larger data stream and the
111:04 - source is a smaller data stream that
111:06 - provides the records that are added to
111:08 - the Target stream okay
111:10 - now in order to configure the tool here
111:12 - we can see the configuration panel over
111:14 - here
111:15 - we can use this table to modify the
111:17 - incoming data stream
111:18 - uh here each row is representing an
111:21 - individual column in the table as you
111:24 - can see row ID order ID order date ship
111:26 - date shipment Etc now here what are the
111:29 - options what are the things that we can
111:31 - do is
111:32 - we can modify the type of the column
111:34 - like right now it's double but if you
111:37 - want to change it to anything else you
111:39 - can change it like I want int 16 over
111:40 - here so that its size also decreases if
111:43 - in the case of the strings you want to
111:45 - change the size you can do that as well
111:47 - if you want to rename a column that also
111:50 - you can do like instead of the row ID I
111:52 - want s number to be present over here
111:53 - serial number okay
111:55 - okay so sno is what I want to rename it
111:59 - in case you want to provide a
112:01 - description for your columns that you
112:03 - can also provide
112:05 - now what would happen is once the
112:07 - Cartesian join is performed this is how
112:09 - the columns would be treated like with
112:10 - the description with the renamed value
112:12 - and with a modified type over here okay
112:14 - now uh this is a one thing that you can
112:17 - do now in case you want to select
112:19 - multiple Fields like this then there is
112:21 - this options button that is present
112:23 - there are a bunch of options that you
112:25 - can use like save or load that means you
112:27 - can save the field configuration as a
112:29 - DOT yxft file which is altrex fail type
112:34 - file
112:35 - um that can be used in other workflows
112:37 - as well
112:39 - then we can use the select option to
112:41 - either select all of the columns or
112:43 - deselect them all we can change the
112:46 - field type of the highlighted Fields
112:47 - this is only available if all the fields
112:50 - that you have highlighted are the same
112:51 - type so you can just change them to uh a
112:55 - common or a mutual type right
112:57 - next we have is the sort option which is
112:59 - of course used to sort the columns
113:02 - in ascending all the descending orders
113:03 - like uh sort on the original field name
113:06 - on a new field name on the field type or
113:08 - a river to the incoming field water next
113:11 - we have is the move option that is used
113:13 - to move the highlighted columns to the
113:15 - top or the bottom of the list if you
113:17 - want to perform this option
113:19 - if you want to add some prefix to the
113:21 - field names if you want to add suffix to
113:22 - the field names if you want to remove
113:24 - any prefix remove any subfix or if you
113:26 - want to uh clear all the renames that I
113:29 - have done so far that you can do
113:32 - using this if you want uh the
113:34 - highlighted Fields only whose renames
113:37 - you want to clear that also you can do
113:38 - revert all to racial types that means
113:41 - all of the changes that you have done
113:42 - would be unchanged
113:44 - and
113:46 - so on these are all the options that we
113:48 - have available next we have is
113:52 - this option one slash error on too many
113:55 - records being generated so uh in this
113:58 - append Fields tool it performs a
114:00 - Cartesian join which means the number of
114:02 - the rows of both of these tables are
114:05 - actually multiplied with one another
114:06 - that means a huge number of rows would
114:08 - be generated right
114:09 - so it is a possibility that
114:12 - unintentionally you can produce so many
114:15 - errors so you can configure the warnings
114:18 - or errors to be reported so that not too
114:21 - many records are being produced now for
114:24 - this we have three options allow all
114:26 - appends that means all records should be
114:27 - appended to all the records with no
114:29 - error or warning next is one on a prince
114:32 - of more than three uh 16 records like if
114:36 - there are more than 16 records in the
114:37 - source file
114:38 - a warning is reported and the workflow
114:41 - continues processing
114:42 - third option is error on appends of more
114:45 - than 16 records so if there are more
114:47 - than 16 records in the source file then
114:50 - the error is reported and the workflow
114:52 - stops it processing so it is just to
114:54 - save the memory and provide a fail safe
114:58 - in case of the errors right so I'm going
115:00 - to go with all allow all appends just
115:03 - for this case to show you how the stool
115:05 - is gonna work okay
115:08 - so here I have actually
115:10 - um
115:11 - run the append Fields tool let me
115:13 - explain to you quickly that what I have
115:15 - done
115:15 - uh the target we have already taken in
115:20 - the case of source what we have done is
115:22 - we have taken a few records around 5000
115:25 - records for the source now where these
115:28 - records come from uh from the target
115:30 - itself we created three separate Excel
115:33 - sheets on the basis of segment so if you
115:36 - just go to this particular data here you
115:38 - will find that there is this field
115:40 - called segment it has three possible
115:42 - values consumer home office and
115:45 - corporate
115:47 - these are the three segments okay so uh
115:50 - these three Excel sheets were created in
115:52 - one Excel sheet all the consumer related
115:54 - records were there in another there were
115:56 - all corporate related records and so on
115:59 - so just like that I have taken one more
116:01 - Excel sheet which contains all the
116:03 - consumer records now this would act as
116:05 - my source because source is usually
116:07 - smaller in size than the target
116:09 - so a total of 5191 records were in this
116:13 - and a total of 9994 records were in this
116:17 - as you can see over here the number of
116:19 - the records is shown
116:20 - so what we I have done is uh I have used
116:23 - these two things in the append tool and
116:26 - run this after running it I applied a
116:29 - browse tool the browse tool is nothing
116:31 - but it helps us to you know
116:35 - see that what is going on inside the
116:37 - tool if you just uh click over this
116:40 - append Fields tool then you will see
116:42 - that this is the targets field
116:44 - it is same the changes that we did here
116:46 - that was renaming the serial name number
116:48 - row ID to serial number is not being
116:51 - reflected over here and in the source we
116:53 - have the row ID again with all the
116:55 - records present over here but as soon as
116:58 - we added the browse tool and click on
117:00 - run then it is going to show me the
117:02 - updated records like how many records
117:05 - were taken from there so a 5191 records
117:08 - from the consumer that means the source
117:10 - and 9994 records from the orders sheet
117:13 - that is the actual data set now it's
117:15 - going to take a few seconds and here you
117:17 - can see the percentage of the process
117:20 - that has been completed
117:22 - and along with this you can see the
117:24 - memory that it is being occupied right
117:26 - now it's 4.9 GB so let's just give it a
117:29 - few seconds
117:30 - and see what happens when it's fully run
117:33 - so let us made after it's completed
117:35 - fully after it's fully executed
117:39 - now uh the whole process has run
117:42 - and you can see uh due to the browse
117:45 - tool we are able to see that the first
117:48 - row that was row ID initially has been
117:51 - changed to serial number and now we are
117:54 - getting a
117:56 - the combination of the records that is a
117:59 - target the number of rows of the target
118:02 - multiplied by the number of rows of the
118:04 - source so this is the total number of
118:06 - records that we are getting and this is
118:08 - the size 37.9 GB so this is how the
118:11 - append Fields tool or the Cartesian join
118:13 - Works in altrex that's all for this
118:15 - video thanks for watching
118:17 - hello everyone welcome back to the
118:19 - altrex tutorials in this video we are
118:22 - going to talk about very important tools
118:24 - that are present in the join tab of the
118:27 - altrex tool now these tools are defined
118:29 - on the replace tool as the name suggests
118:31 - they help you to find for the values and
118:34 - if you want to replace your found value
118:35 - with any other value so for that also
118:38 - this tool is used okay so here in the
118:41 - workflow as you can already see I have
118:43 - input the data that is the sample
118:45 - Superstore data and I have applied two
118:48 - data cleansing operations so this I have
118:50 - already explained in the previous videos
118:52 - in case you have not seen the videos I
118:54 - would recommend you to go and watch them
118:55 - to easily understand that what's going
118:57 - on here
118:57 - now once your data is clean let us make
119:00 - use of the find and replace tool it is
119:02 - present in the join tab so here's the
119:03 - join nav and here is the fine and
119:05 - replace tool let me just drag it over
119:06 - here
119:07 - now uh let us understand this tool it is
119:10 - used to find a string in one column of a
119:12 - data set and look up and replace it with
119:14 - the specified value from another data
119:16 - set right
119:18 - so you can use it to append columns as
119:21 - well
119:22 - uh
119:23 - now if we take a look at the
119:26 - configuration tab we have this fine
119:28 - section and the replay section there are
119:29 - two different sections right in the find
119:31 - section we have these three radio
119:33 - buttons that can be chosen as per our
119:36 - wish first is beginning of field that
119:38 - searches for the instance of the field
119:40 - value at the beginning of the field the
119:43 - entire field does not have to contain
119:44 - what is being searched for
119:46 - next we have any part of the field which
119:49 - means it would search for the instance
119:51 - of the field value in any part of the
119:53 - field the entire field again does not
119:55 - have to be containing what is being
119:57 - searched for
119:58 - third is the entire field that it would
120:00 - search for the instance of the field
120:02 - value contained within the entire field
120:05 - the instance must be there in its
120:07 - entirety to be replaced with a new value
120:10 - then we have find within field option
120:13 - which is used to select the field in the
120:15 - table with the data to be replaced f is
120:18 - the input anchor by the data in the
120:21 - reference table and R is the input
120:23 - anchor
120:25 - uh that is being specified by which data
120:27 - to be replaced okay next we have is the
120:30 - find Value that is um used to select the
120:33 - field from the reference table that is
120:34 - the r
120:35 - that contains the same values as the
120:37 - find within table in the original table
120:40 - okay
120:41 - next we have the case and sensitive find
120:43 - and match the whole world only so
120:46 - what we will do is if we take a look at
120:49 - this Autos table this we would be
120:51 - connecting to the replace okay next we
120:54 - would be getting another in out and let
120:57 - me just get the input data
120:59 - here what I have done is let me just
121:02 - move it a little bit here
121:04 - so what I have done is I have made some
121:06 - changes into the subcategory field and
121:09 - the category Fields okay so what I'm
121:11 - going to do is just first of all get the
121:14 - file over here
121:17 - and this is the file that I want
121:25 - yeah
121:26 - so here let's just click on OK
121:32 - and connect it to the find values okay
121:34 - so it is going to find the values and
121:38 - replace it okay so let me just go back
121:41 - to this tool
121:43 - if I just click on the output anchor of
121:45 - this first field what we would be
121:48 - getting here
121:51 - is 100 records actually
121:54 - and here you can see the subcategory
121:57 - chose is having a different spelling
122:00 - means there are some of the white spaces
122:02 - but in the case of this the output angle
122:04 - of the data cleansed field
122:06 - we'll find that in the subcategory the
122:09 - chairs are correct okay so we need to
122:12 - find the value of chairs and replace it
122:13 - with this that means the subcategory
122:15 - field would be employed so let's just
122:17 - click on this entire field
122:20 - subcategory and replace it with a
122:23 - subcategory value okay
122:25 - and that's the case in sensitifying or
122:28 - let's just keep all the settings as this
122:30 - only and click on run
122:33 - now you can see that we have find
122:37 - in this F targets there are a number of
122:40 - records and in the r Target that's the
122:42 - source there are a number of Records
122:44 - if we click on the output anchor so the
122:46 - total number of Records is 591 that
122:49 - means the field where we have replaced
122:51 - the values right
122:53 - and the values would have been replaced
122:55 - over here
122:58 - okay so here we can just select the
123:01 - subcategory again
123:03 - and click on run
123:13 - so this is how the fine and the replace
123:15 - tool works it is used to replace the
123:18 - values right so this was all about the
123:20 - fine section let us now focus on the
123:22 - replay section
123:23 - so we have replace found text with value
123:25 - that means we have to choose the field
123:28 - from the reference table to update the
123:31 - original table that means the fine table
123:33 - if you want to replace multiple items
123:36 - then you can just check this uh button
123:39 - or you can just uncheck it
123:41 - uh append fields to record if you want
123:43 - to append a column
123:46 - from the find field to the replace field
123:48 - then you can just do that as well okay
123:50 - so these are the options uh that are
123:52 - available let me just open some records
123:54 - category and the product Name Records
123:57 - and click on run
124:00 - now if you just click on this
124:04 - output anchor
124:09 - then you can see Category 2 and product
124:11 - name 2 are also available over here that
124:13 - means these have been appended in the
124:15 - final output so that's how the find and
124:18 - the replace tool works now let us talk
124:20 - about the other tool that is available
124:23 - which is known as the union tool so the
124:26 - union tool is a special tool which is
124:28 - again present in the join tab
124:30 - now what is the function of this tool it
124:33 - is used to combine two or more data sets
124:35 - on the column names or the position so
124:37 - on the basis of the column names of the
124:39 - position
124:40 - it is used to combine the data sets
124:42 - right and in the output each column
124:44 - contains the row from each input
124:47 - we can actually perform the union
124:50 - operation on the basis of the number of
124:51 - the columns or the position the name of
124:53 - the columns or the position or the
124:55 - columns right so if we take a look at
124:57 - this
124:58 - we have two columns we have two data
125:01 - sets right now that is the consumer
125:03 - segment data set and the corporate
125:05 - segment data set so if we just take a
125:07 - look at these data sets they all have
125:09 - the same values that is the same columns
125:12 - column names are same and the position
125:14 - is also same rate so we can just perform
125:16 - the Union on both cases that is on the
125:19 - basis of name and on the basis of
125:21 - positions as well right
125:23 - so what we are going to do is we are
125:26 - just going to take both of them
125:28 - drag this Union tool over here and we
125:31 - are going to connect them so this is one
125:35 - and this is 2. so we can just uh
125:38 - attach them both of them the one is the
125:41 - consumer and the second is the corporate
125:43 - now if you just check on this output tab
125:46 - what we would be getting
125:48 - is a combination of the rows that is
125:51 - 8211 records in total here you can see
125:55 - right then we have this
125:58 - for
125:59 - cross check we have the segment column
126:01 - where first of all the consumer values
126:03 - are there
126:04 - and then if you just scroll down
126:10 - we would be having the corporate values
126:12 - okay
126:14 - so this is what we are getting over here
126:17 - um
126:18 - now if we just go to this Union tool
126:20 - here we have three options Auto config
126:22 - by name that means if the column names
126:24 - is similar then you can use this option
126:26 - next is auto config by position that
126:29 - means if the position is similar then
126:31 - automatic configuration would be done on
126:33 - the base of position so we can do that
126:34 - as well because in our case both of the
126:37 - things are same so there would be no
126:38 - change
126:40 - right but the third option that we have
126:42 - right now is the manual configuration by
126:45 - the fields so if you want to configure
126:47 - some fields to other values that you can
126:48 - do like
126:49 - here we have state and postal code so if
126:52 - you want to just change them
126:55 - with this interchange them like this
126:57 - okay
126:58 - and click on run
127:01 - so now what would happen is if you just
127:04 - go there
127:06 - in the state and the postal code these
127:08 - values would be interchanged with one
127:10 - another right
127:11 - to understand it in a better way we can
127:14 - just use the browse tool over here
127:16 - so that we can get to see the individual
127:18 - records and run it
127:23 - right
127:24 - now if you just go to this tool here
127:30 - we can find the postal code
127:36 - right
127:37 - and as you can see the longest value is
127:40 - not Carolina or the last alphanumeric
127:42 - value is Winsconsin that means the
127:45 - values have been interchanged okay
127:48 - and similarly in order to check for the
127:50 - segment
127:51 - what we can do is just select the
127:53 - segment one
127:55 - segment field over here
127:57 - here is the segment field and there are
127:58 - two values the consumer segment and the
128:00 - corporate segment so that is how the
128:01 - union works for the union to work at
128:04 - least to the of the data sets must be
128:06 - available and they must have some of the
128:09 - Common Ground on the basis of which you
128:11 - can perform the union operation Union
128:13 - operation is similar that is one table
128:16 - is appended over the other table no
128:20 - changes are made into the individual
128:21 - records only uh the
128:25 - appending operation takes place so
128:27 - that's all for this Union tool and
128:29 - that's all for this video in the next
128:31 - videos we would be looking at some more
128:33 - tools of this joint app that's all for
128:35 - this video thanks for watching
128:38 - hello everyone welcome to altrex
128:40 - tutorials in this video we are going to
128:42 - take a look at the join tool in altrex
128:45 - so the join tool is a part of the join
128:47 - tab group and it is a very useful tool
128:50 - in altrex we would be seeing all about
128:52 - this tool in this video
128:54 - so first of all let us understand that
128:56 - what is the basic functions of this tool
128:58 - a joint tool is used to combine the two
129:01 - inputs based on some common fields
129:04 - between the two tables we can also join
129:06 - two data streams based upon the record
129:09 - position of those streams so for the
129:12 - join tool we have two inputs over here
129:14 - as you can see input data one
129:17 - we just click on it it would open the
129:19 - Excel file
129:21 - so it has a few fields
129:24 - here and it is the segment field is the
129:28 - consumer segment as you can see all
129:29 - these segments are consumer over here in
129:31 - this field okay
129:33 - and the second we have is the same table
129:36 - but the number of Records is different
129:38 - and the segment here is the corporate
129:40 - segment over here like this so here are
129:43 - the two sheets the consumer sheet and
129:44 - the corporate sheet which are actually a
129:46 - part
129:47 - um and they can ask two different inputs
129:49 - to be joined together right that means
129:52 - we have two inputs with common fields
129:55 - between them which we need to join now
129:57 - let us drag this join tool over here as
130:00 - you can see
130:01 - this is a join tool
130:04 - and um in order to perform the join we
130:08 - can uh
130:11 - actually use two options which are
130:13 - available in this configuration tab that
130:15 - is joined by record position or joined
130:17 - by specific fields now if we talk about
130:19 - join by record position this option is
130:21 - used when two tables have the same field
130:24 - structure and the data will be joined by
130:26 - its position within the two tables next
130:29 - we have is join with specific fields
130:32 - it is used when the two tables have one
130:34 - or more fields in common and the data
130:37 - will be joined together on the basis of
130:39 - the common field only
130:40 - and we can choose to join based upon the
130:43 - multiple fields and each joint should be
130:45 - a separate Row in the grid like this is
130:47 - the grid so each join each criteria that
130:50 - you are giving for the joint should be
130:51 - for a separate Row in this table but I'm
130:53 - just going to go with the join with
130:54 - record position joined by record
130:56 - position first of all let me just drag
130:58 - this 1 to L and the other two R so l
131:02 - means left and R means right these are
131:04 - the two anchors that we are getting
131:07 - now each input L and R or left and right
131:10 - has a drop down list
131:12 - from where we can just actually select
131:15 - the fields or the join field for each of
131:18 - the inputs altrix designer will
131:21 - automatically select the field for us as
131:22 - in this case you can see it has selected
131:24 - the row ID field for us
131:26 - to be taken as the drop down uh as the
131:29 - joining field okay
131:31 - now we can just use the stable to modify
131:34 - the data that means it's type we can
131:36 - modify like right now it's double we can
131:38 - just select it to in 16 to reduce its
131:40 - size a little bit
131:42 - we can rename it so let's just rename it
131:45 - to a serial number just to show you that
131:47 - how the changes are gonna work and like
131:49 - this we can just modify it like the data
131:52 - type the size we can rename it or add a
131:54 - description so
131:55 - let's just add a description that is
131:57 - serial number
132:00 - like this okay
132:03 - so these are the changes that I have
132:05 - done
132:07 - all right and then there is this unknown
132:09 - column which is basically used in case
132:11 - we want to add more columns
132:15 - now uh in case of the view output there
132:17 - are these three options that is the L
132:19 - anchor that contains the records from
132:21 - the L input that didn't join to the
132:23 - records from the r input the J anchor
132:25 - that contains the records that join from
132:27 - the L and the r input and then we have
132:29 - the r anchor
132:31 - uh that contains the records from the r
132:34 - input that didn't join into the records
132:36 - from the L input so this is the
132:38 - um order and these are the three angles
132:41 - that have been shown over here if you
132:42 - just click on run
132:45 - so the joining would occur let's just
132:47 - click on the L anchor to get the uh
132:50 - records from the error input that didn't
132:51 - join to the records from the r input so
132:53 - a total of 2171 records are there
132:56 - we click on J so 3020 records are J uh
133:00 - in this J anchor that means the records
133:02 - that have been joined from the
133:04 - alienboard to the r input
133:07 - over here as you can see
133:10 - there are 3020 records and in this R
133:12 - anchor we have no records that means
133:14 - there are no records in the r input that
133:17 - didn't join to the records of the L
133:19 - input so this is how the join tool works
133:23 - and uh there are these different types
133:26 - of joins that can happen uh in this
133:31 - using the drawing tool first is the
133:33 - inner join that we have done right now
133:36 - specified by this J uncut this is the
133:38 - inner join that contains the records
133:41 - that join from the L input to the
133:42 - records in the r input
133:44 - on this L anchor refers to the left
133:47 - unjoined that contains only of the
133:50 - records that didn't join to those of the
133:52 - r and this R contains of the r unjoined
133:56 - records
133:58 - next we have is a possibility of a left
134:00 - outer join that all the records from the
134:02 - L input including the records that
134:04 - joined with the r input right
134:08 - now this can be achieved with the help
134:09 - of two tools The Joint tool and the
134:11 - union tool
134:13 - um
134:14 - so what we can do is actually
134:18 - get a union tool
134:21 - here and if we just combine them
134:23 - together that means connect the J and L
134:28 - outputs are the join tool to the union
134:30 - rule so the L is connected let's just
134:32 - connect the J as well now if we just
134:34 - click on this output button
134:40 - and um
134:41 - just run it then what we would be
134:44 - getting is a total of 5191 Records which
134:48 - is the result of the left outer joint
134:51 - similarly if you want to get a result of
134:53 - the right Auto join now what is Right
134:55 - outer join uh that means all the records
134:57 - from the r input including the records
135:00 - that are joined
135:01 - with the Ali input so again let's just
135:03 - get a union uh let's just drag the J
135:06 - and the r anchors over here
135:10 - and run the workflow
135:14 - so here it is let's just click on the
135:16 - output and this is around 3020 records
135:19 - that are a part of the right outer join
135:21 - last but not the least we have the full
135:23 - outer join so that means all the records
135:26 - that are a part of the L and the r
135:29 - inputs are the full auto join
135:33 - a full outer join is actually similar to
135:37 - be a Penfield showing which means it
135:41 - actually performs the Cartesian joint a
135:42 - combination of all the records of both
135:44 - the tables would be shown over here and
135:46 - the total number of rows would be the
135:48 - product of the
135:49 - individual rows in the tables so either
135:53 - we can directly use the paint fields or
135:55 - if you don't want to use the paint
135:56 - Fields then you can actually use a third
135:59 - option so what I'm gonna do is just copy
136:02 - these three tools
136:04 - right click copy and create a new
136:06 - workflow out of them so as to avoid the
136:08 - confusion and here I am going to perform
136:10 - the full auto joint so let's just get
136:13 - the union tool over here
136:15 - uh we need to connect all these three
136:17 - that is LJ and R over here so first of
136:20 - all we need to connect the J output or
136:23 - the J angle why we are doing it every
136:25 - time we are using the union tool after
136:28 - the join tool make sure you first
136:29 - connect the chip to establish the
136:31 - combined table schema that what is going
136:34 - to be the final detail schema right then
136:36 - you can connect L and then you can
136:39 - connect R
136:42 - and then run this workflow
136:44 - so after a few seconds
136:46 - here is the output total of 5191 Records
136:50 - would be displayed over here
136:53 - with all the values right and if you
136:56 - want to cross check your results what
136:57 - you can do is actually use the paint
136:59 - Fields option so for this we are just
137:01 - going to copy these two tools
137:04 - you can select multiple by control
137:06 - clicking them right click copy
137:08 - go to the new workflow and paste them
137:11 - either using the shortcut Ctrl V or
137:13 - simply just right click and paste right
137:16 - let me move it here KTR paint field
137:18 - stool
137:19 - over here get it here
137:25 - run it
137:34 - allow all the pens and click on run
137:39 - it do take a few seconds of course a
137:41 - point Fields is a little bit slower
137:43 - option
137:45 - than the
137:47 - um
137:48 - Union and the joint rule combined so
137:51 - let's just wait for a few seconds
137:53 - and while we are waiting you can see
137:55 - actually the progress with which it is
137:57 - working on okay
138:00 - right so now if you just click on this
138:02 - output anchor
138:04 - then we would be seeing a total of all
138:06 - the records that are present over here
138:08 - so that is how the joints work uh the
138:11 - Cartesian join or the full outer join
138:14 - the left outer join the right outer join
138:16 - and basically all the types of the
138:18 - joints with the help of the join tool
138:19 - Union tool and the append Fields tool
138:21 - that is all that we would be looking at
138:24 - in this join Tab and that's all for this
138:27 - video thanks for watching
138:31 - hello everyone welcome to altrex videos
138:34 - in this video we are going to talk about
138:36 - a tool that is known as the regex tool
138:39 - in altrex so regex is basically stands
138:42 - for regular expressions and that helps
138:45 - us to find for particular values in the
138:49 - uh table okay
138:52 - so here is a few small setup that I have
138:55 - done for the regex tool this is how a
138:57 - regex tool looks and it is a part of the
139:00 - parse tab in the altrex so here is the
139:04 - regex tool that's present it is used to
139:07 - leverage the regular expression syntax
139:09 - to pass match or replace the data
139:12 - so for the regex tool first of all the
139:14 - data must be present so I have taken a
139:16 - data that is the consumer shipment data
139:18 - from the output Excel sheets that we
139:20 - have already prepared in the previous
139:21 - videos
139:22 - in case you have not watched the videos
139:24 - I would recommend you to watch them to
139:26 - better understand what we are doing over
139:27 - here
139:28 - so once I have taken the data from the
139:31 - input data tool then let me just delete
139:33 - it once
139:34 - the next thing is to go to this Parts
139:36 - Tab and grab this regex tool over here
139:39 - okay now what we are going to do is
139:41 - connect these anchors like this
139:44 - and in the regex tools configuration we
139:47 - have the first option that is the
139:50 - configure the column two parts so here
139:53 - you can just select the column which we
139:55 - want to parse so what I'm going to do is
139:57 - I'm just going to go with the customer
139:59 - name column that I want to parse
140:01 - next is in format to convert option we
140:05 - have to add the regular expression so
140:08 - here is the Pearl 5 regex syntax that
140:12 - has been followed by this regular
140:14 - expressions in case you do not know
140:16 - about the regular expressions and want
140:18 - to read about it then how can you go
140:20 - with it you can simply just go to Google
140:24 - and here you can just search for regex
140:29 - altrex regex tool tricks are basically
140:31 - regex ultrax so if you just uh search
140:34 - for it you would get the first link that
140:36 - is help.alltricks.com that would give
140:39 - you the official altrex documentation
140:42 - for this tool and in this official
140:44 - documentation you will find this link
140:46 - that is per regular expression syntax
140:48 - you can just click on this link and here
140:50 - is all the information that you need to
140:52 - know about the regular Expressions
140:54 - before working on them like everything
140:56 - that on every syntax of regex that is
141:00 - being used is shown over here okay
141:04 - so you can take your time and read it
141:06 - understand it well and then come back to
141:09 - this video so let me just quickly show
141:12 - you that how these regular expressions
141:14 - are gonna work
141:15 - here what we have is the plus sign which
141:18 - is the button that is used to access the
141:20 - common regular Expressions that we may
141:22 - need while creating the expression
141:25 - so if you just click on this plus icon
141:27 - we would be seeing these operations like
141:29 - if you want to match for a single
141:31 - character you want to
141:33 - match for zero or more characters or one
141:35 - or more characters you want to match for
141:37 - the start of the word end of the world
141:38 - beginning with line end of the line and
141:40 - so on these are all the regular
141:42 - expression syntax that have been given
141:44 - to you next is the case insensitive
141:46 - option
141:50 - here is this case insensitive option
141:52 - which is checked by default that means
141:54 - um
141:55 - the searches that would be happening
141:58 - through regular expression would not
142:00 - distinguish between the upper case and
142:01 - the lowercase letters right next we have
142:04 - is the output where we have the output
142:06 - method which is used when parsing
142:10 - to configure the related properties like
142:12 - what you want to do once the Expressions
142:14 - have been matched so we have four
142:16 - methods that are available the first one
142:18 - is replace so it means that we want to
142:21 - replace the expression that we have
142:24 - searched with a second expression now
142:27 - where you want to find the second
142:29 - expression that is in the replacement X
142:31 - you can enter the replacement text
142:34 - uh that we want to uh the original
142:36 - expression to be replaced with again we
142:38 - have this plus that would allow you to
142:42 - actually find the entire text or just
142:45 - the particular character
142:47 - to be replaced okay the common regular
142:49 - Expressions again that are needed and
142:52 - then we have the copy unmatched text to
142:55 - Output if you want to copy to the output
142:57 - as well but also you can do otherwise
142:59 - you can just remove it next option that
143:02 - we have in this output is the tokenize
143:03 - method that is used to split the
143:06 - incoming data using a regular expression
143:08 - it works in similar to the next tool
143:12 - that we have is the text to columns tool
143:14 - so we would be working more with the
143:16 - text to columns tool so I'm not going to
143:18 - explain everything over here
143:20 - and
143:21 - it has um some options like
143:25 - if you just select it tokenize method
143:27 - then you can see we have different
143:29 - options like uh split to columns option
143:31 - like you want to split a single column
143:34 - of data at each instance to the
143:36 - specified delimiter into the multiple
143:38 - columns and what would be the extra
143:41 - Behavior or the behavior of the extra
143:43 - columns like you want to drop them with
143:44 - a warning you want to drop them without
143:46 - warning or you want to show an error
143:48 - before dropping the columns then there
143:51 - is this output root name which is
143:54 - actually the original name of the column
143:57 - that we are going to use and if you want
144:00 - to split a single column of data at each
144:02 - instance of the specified delimiter into
144:04 - multiple rows then this option needs to
144:06 - be checked
144:08 - third method we have is the parse method
144:10 - uh it is used to separate the expression
144:13 - into new columns and set the name type
144:15 - size and expression for the new columns
144:18 - a new column is created in the output
144:21 - columns table with the its name its
144:24 - particular data type its size and the
144:26 - expression which is automatically
144:27 - populated so you can just specify name
144:30 - type and size
144:32 - last but not the least we have is the
144:34 - match uh option that is used to append a
144:38 - column containing a number that is one
144:40 - if the expression is matched and 0 if it
144:42 - did not matched now um column ID column
144:46 - name for match status that means the new
144:48 - column would be created so what would be
144:50 - the name of the column that you can
144:51 - specify over here by default it is taken
144:53 - as order ID underscore matched right
144:57 - um and there is this option of error if
144:59 - not match so if the expression is not
145:02 - matched and you want to generate some
145:04 - kind of an error that it would generate
145:06 - by checking on this option or by
145:07 - unchecking it okay so let's just see uh
145:10 - the practical application of this
145:12 - regular expression but before that let
145:14 - me just get a look of how the data is
145:16 - looking
145:17 - so here it is we are using the customer
145:19 - name
145:22 - in the customer name field we have
145:25 - different customer names
145:27 - starting with different letters right so
145:29 - let's just go to the regular expression
145:31 - field
145:32 - and I wanted to start with
145:35 - any single character should be Z
145:38 - okay
145:39 - and uh I just want a match column to be
145:42 - there that
145:43 - there should be a column uh that should
145:46 - be name underscore matched
145:50 - that if it is matched it should show me
145:53 - one otherwise it should show me a zero
145:56 - and click on run
145:58 - now wait for a few seconds till it's
145:59 - been run
146:03 - here now we can see that we are getting
146:05 - this name matched option where the
146:07 - results are false there should be some
146:09 - true results in order to get that what
146:10 - we're going to do is grab the browse
146:12 - tool over here
146:14 - and in this browse tool
146:17 - let's just run it once again run the
146:19 - workflow
146:21 - now in the browse tool we are going to
146:24 - go with the last record that is the name
146:27 - matched record so all are false that
146:29 - means uh there were no records that had
146:32 - said in them
146:33 - right so let me just append my query
146:36 - just modify my query a little bit
146:38 - and here get a instead of set run it
146:44 - so here what we have done is added a and
146:47 - in this case uh check pick option of
146:49 - error if not matched so if there is no
146:51 - matching in the first record itself then
146:53 - the error would be there so let me just
146:55 - turn on it
146:57 - so this is what we are getting as the
146:59 - error because the first letter was not a
147:02 - that is why it didn't match the
147:04 - expression and the error was there and
147:06 - it has finished its running in just 1.4
147:09 - seconds okay
147:11 - uh so this is how the regular
147:12 - Expressions work now let us move on to
147:15 - the next tool that we have and that is
147:18 - the
147:19 - text to columns tool so let me just
147:21 - create a new workflow and in this
147:23 - workflow what I'm going to do is just
147:25 - copy paste this input data okay so let's
147:29 - just copy it
147:31 - and paste it
147:35 - and grab this text to columns tool
147:39 - over here so it would give me the um
147:43 - freedom to just you know uh split the
147:47 - columns like we have the order ID column
147:49 - in which hyphen can act as a delimiter
147:51 - so I want to split this column so let's
147:53 - just go to this
147:55 - um tool select order ID column the
147:57 - delimiter specified needs to be hyphen
147:59 - the number of columns that needs to be
148:01 - created is three
148:03 - and leave if there are any extra columns
148:06 - then leave it in the last column and the
148:08 - output root name is going to be order ID
148:10 - right let's just click on run
148:14 - and now what we can see is a total of 24
148:17 - fields
148:19 - so
148:21 - here what we are getting order id1 order
148:23 - id2 and Order ID3 since there were only
148:26 - three things so three have been shown
148:28 - over here in case they were multiple
148:30 - hyphens like let me just
148:34 - decrease the number of columns to do and
148:36 - click on run then what would happen is
148:40 - we would be getting order id1 and in the
148:42 - last column the combination of both of
148:44 - them like order ID 2 and 3 with the
148:47 - hyphen is present over here if you want
148:49 - to rename the column you can just rename
148:50 - it simply
148:53 - uh using the tools that we have seen in
148:55 - the past so um any kind of a renaming
148:57 - that you want to perform that you can do
148:59 - so that's all for this video in which we
149:01 - looked about the regex tool and the text
149:03 - to columns tool
149:04 - uh in the parts tab of the altrex that's
149:07 - all for this video thanks for watching
149:10 - hello everyone welcome to altrex
149:12 - tutorials in this video we are going to
149:15 - talk about a very important tool in
149:17 - altrex known as the count records tool
149:20 - so count record tool is present in the
149:23 - transform tab
149:25 - in the altrex it is used to return the
149:28 - count of the number of the records that
149:30 - are passing through the tool now we can
149:33 - use this tool when we want to report on
149:35 - the resulting record uh or the record
149:38 - count that is being used in the workflow
149:43 - um it even returns account of a zero as
149:45 - well
149:46 - so in case you are wondering that how
149:48 - would you get the total number of
149:50 - Records then you can do that with the
149:52 - help of the count records tool now you
149:55 - can get that on the entire database or
149:58 - you can apply some filters and get the
150:01 - records that match that particular
150:03 - filter as well
150:04 - so I'm going to show you the example for
150:06 - both
150:07 - let me first get the input data tool and
150:10 - get my data that is stored in this
150:12 - output Excel file the consumer sheet
150:15 - now if I just run it right now
150:19 - I would be getting all the records that
150:21 - are present in there that is a total of
150:23 - 5191 Records okay
150:25 - now the thing is I'm going to uh go to
150:27 - this output and apply a filter
150:30 - over here right so let's just use this
150:33 - filter tool
150:35 - here and the filter is going to be a
150:38 - basic filter that is I want to select
150:40 - the segment where the segment value is
150:42 - let's just get a value for the segment
150:45 - or let's just get a value for a say
150:49 - category that is equal to technology
150:52 - so let me just apply the filter that is
150:55 - for the category if it is equals to
150:59 - technology okay
151:02 - then run this
151:05 - and we would be getting in the true part
151:08 - we are getting 951 records and in the
151:10 - false part we are getting a 4 000 sub
151:13 - records okay so if you just go to the
151:16 - true part
151:17 - and then go to the transform tab get
151:19 - discount records filter or this count
151:22 - records tool and apply it over here
151:25 - then we just go to its output part okay
151:27 - or basically we just run this tool
151:30 - then what we are getting is 951 as the
151:33 - total because it is only added to the
151:35 - true part if I also connect this false
151:38 - part to here then you can see it's um
151:40 - not able to connect because this counter
151:43 - codes tool only accept one input right
151:46 - so to get the number of the false
151:48 - records we add another counter codes
151:49 - tool and click on run
151:52 - so now for this second counter chords
151:55 - tool if you just click on its output
151:57 - part we are getting four to four zero
151:59 - that's the number of the records for the
152:00 - false and this is the number of the
152:02 - records 951 is the number of records for
152:04 - the true part
152:05 - in case we decide to remove this filter
152:07 - right let me just remove this filter
152:10 - over here
152:12 - and also delete one of the counter calls
152:14 - tools then what can I do is right click
152:15 - connect my database to this counter
152:17 - codes tool
152:19 - now if I just run it
152:22 - then what do we get is 5191 that is the
152:25 - total number of Records in the actual
152:28 - database so that's how the counter cards
152:30 - tool works either through filter or
152:32 - without the filter okay
152:34 - next tool that we are going to see is
152:37 - the cross tab tool so let me just save
152:39 - this workflow and move on to our second
152:41 - tool that is the cross tab tool now what
152:44 - is a usage of this tool it is used to
152:46 - Pivot the orientation of the data in a
152:48 - table uh what it does is it moves the
152:51 - vertical data fields onto a horizontal
152:53 - axis and summarizes the data whenever it
152:56 - is specified
152:57 - it is in Reverse application of the
152:59 - transpose tool which of course we would
153:01 - be seeing as well
153:03 - so there is no limit on the number of
153:05 - the rows or the columns that can be
153:06 - passed through this cross tab tool okay
153:08 - so for this crosstab tool what I have
153:10 - done is I have taken another database or
153:12 - I have created another database let me
153:14 - just use that because it is fairly small
153:16 - so it would be easier to understand for
153:18 - us
153:18 - so this database is present in the form
153:21 - of verb a named range in Excel it has
153:24 - two columns the number of R's and the
153:26 - score so the name of the range is the
153:28 - scores so let me just get that click on
153:30 - OK
153:31 - this is how it is looking it has around
153:33 - 10 records okay it gives us the number
153:36 - of the R's the student has studied and
153:38 - the score that he has scored okay let's
153:40 - just go to the transform Tab and get our
153:42 - crosstab tool over here
153:46 - now once we get there it would ask us
153:49 - that if we want to group the data by any
153:52 - of these values so it is all the
153:55 - available data values that are present
153:57 - in the data set
153:59 - if you want it to be a grouped with a
154:02 - specific value you can just select that
154:04 - next is um
154:06 - if you want to create a value or change
154:11 - the column headers so a new column would
154:13 - be created for each of the unique values
154:14 - in this particular
154:17 - um header so the number of hours then we
154:20 - have values for new columns so these
154:23 - values would be used to propagate the
154:25 - new columns that are created by the
154:26 - number of r's
154:28 - now if you want to aggregate it then you
154:32 - can just aggregate it using these all
154:34 - options so what all options we have some
154:36 - average count
154:37 - a percent two percent column total first
154:40 - and last
154:41 - so uh what we are going to do is just go
154:44 - with the total row and the total column
154:46 - and click on run
154:50 - now here
154:51 - um
154:53 - we just select on the output tab here
154:55 - this is the output that we are getting
154:57 - that is the total
154:59 - of the rows and the columns is 733 if we
155:03 - just
155:04 - um
155:05 - now instead of getting this total row
155:08 - and the total column I am changing the
155:09 - method of aggregating values to sum and
155:12 - just deselect them both and click on run
155:15 - now what would be getting is the record
155:18 - and the um
155:20 - sum of the scores over here
155:24 - so this is how it is looking so this is
155:27 - basically the usage of the crosstab tool
155:29 - in altrex
155:31 - now let us take a look at the tool that
155:33 - is very similar to The crosstab Tool and
155:35 - it is known as the transpose tool so let
155:38 - me just save it
155:40 - and what is the transpose tool it is
155:42 - actually
155:45 - uh somewhat different from the crosstab
155:48 - tool it is used to Pivot the orientation
155:51 - of the data table uh it is basically
155:54 - used to transform the data so what we
155:57 - can do is the horizontal data fields
155:59 - would be shown on the vertical axis
156:01 - it is the reverse application of the
156:03 - crosstab tool and it is useful for
156:06 - extracting the non-conforming data there
156:09 - is no limit again on the number of
156:11 - records of the fields that could be
156:12 - transformed so here is the input data
156:15 - part that is same with the um crosstab
156:19 - tool that we just saw that is the number
156:21 - of hours and the score
156:22 - now let's go to this transform Tab and
156:25 - get this transpose tool so when we get
156:27 - this transpose tool these are the
156:29 - configuration panel options that we are
156:31 - getting first is the key columns so from
156:35 - here we can select the columns to Pivot
156:37 - the table around this name remains on
156:39 - the horizontal axis with its value
156:42 - replicated vertically for each data
156:44 - field that is selected
156:46 - so let me just select them all
156:48 - next is the data columns now that means
156:51 - that we can select the columns to carry
156:54 - through the analysis so let's just keep
156:56 - number of hours over here and the score
156:58 - over here
156:59 - here we have an option of a dynamic or
157:01 - unknown columns so if you want to go for
157:04 - a dynamic or unknown columns as well you
157:06 - can just keep it checked okay
157:08 - uh you can just go to this question mark
157:11 - to run about uh to read about it that is
157:13 - running a workflow can introduce the new
157:15 - columns that were unknown ID
157:17 - configuration time so if you want to
157:20 - include those new columns you can make
157:21 - sure that this option is set that's for
157:23 - uh uh further step towards security
157:27 - last but not the least we have the
157:29 - missing columns option that means what
157:31 - action we want to take if some of the
157:33 - columns are missing we want to report an
157:35 - error and stop processing the result we
157:37 - just want to throw a warning and
157:39 - continue on with the results or we just
157:41 - want to completely ignore it right so
157:43 - let's just keep it on one and click on
157:46 - run
157:48 - now what happens is
157:50 - um if you just click on the output panel
157:52 - this is how it's looking the number of
157:54 - hours
157:56 - uh is same uh the name has been changed
157:59 - to score and its value is being shown
158:01 - like this so uh basically score has been
158:05 - transposed into a horizontal row instead
158:07 - of a vertical a vertical column so this
158:10 - is what the function of the transpose
158:12 - tool is and this is what it has done now
158:15 - if you want you can compare it with the
158:17 - crosstab tool the crosstab tool what it
158:19 - did was
158:21 - transformed the horizontal rows into the
158:24 - vertical columns now we have these
158:26 - columns for all of these values right
158:28 - but what the transpose tool did was just
158:31 - opposite of the crosstab tool it took
158:34 - the name of the column or the header of
158:36 - the column that was score and created
158:39 - multiple rows out of it the value for
158:41 - each of that was written over here like
158:44 - the value value like this okay now in
158:47 - this transpose tool if we just select
158:49 - all the key columns and click on run
158:51 - once again
158:52 - then what would happen uh then we would
158:54 - be getting like this no values because
158:57 - we have transposed both of these columns
158:59 - so no of none of the values are
159:01 - remaining with us okay
159:03 - uh and let me just show you another uh
159:06 - possibility that is
159:08 - if I just decide to transform the number
159:11 - of hours instead of this course value so
159:13 - this is how it would be looking the
159:14 - number of R should be taking up the
159:16 - horizontal rows and its values would be
159:19 - assigned like this with a value field so
159:21 - name and value it would be taken in the
159:23 - form of a pair
159:25 - so that's all for this video in which we
159:27 - learned about three rules of the
159:28 - transform tab
159:30 - and thanks for watching the video
159:33 - hello everyone welcome to altrex
159:36 - tutorials in this video we are going to
159:38 - talk about two very important tools of
159:41 - the transform tab these are the running
159:43 - total tool and the summarize tool so
159:46 - first of all let's start with the
159:47 - running total tool this tool is present
159:50 - in the transform tab in altrex
159:53 - and it is used to calculate a cumulative
159:55 - sum on a numeric field per record in a
159:59 - field
160:00 - it can also be used to create sums of
160:02 - groups of records and calculate the
160:04 - cumulative sums of multiple Fields add
160:07 - the record or even at the group level
160:10 - so let us understand the usage of this
160:13 - running total tool with the help of an
160:14 - example right so let me just first get
160:17 - my data using this input data tool which
160:20 - is present in the in out tab
160:22 - now let's just click on this drop down
160:24 - and get our Excel sheet which is the
160:27 - consumer sheet click on OK
160:29 - now let's just grab this running doodle
160:31 - tool and bring it over here
160:34 - here we have two options that are
160:36 - present in this running total tool
160:39 - in the configuration panel that is the
160:40 - group by field which is again optional
160:42 - and the second option is the create
160:45 - running total field so it helps us to
160:48 - create the numeric fields to create a
160:50 - running total basically to select the
160:52 - fields through which we want to create a
160:54 - running total in your database there
160:56 - might be different kinds of fields like
160:58 - the textual Fields the date fields
161:01 - or spatial object Fields but the running
161:03 - doodle tool will automatically fetch out
161:06 - the numerical fields and would give you
161:07 - only those fields on which it is
161:09 - applicable right so these are all the
161:11 - numeric fields that are present in my
161:13 - data set that's why it's showing the
161:15 - list of all of them right now uh what
161:18 - you want is you can just select the
161:21 - fields of whose running total you want
161:23 - the new columns would be created and
161:26 - they would be added with a run total
161:28 - underscore prefix
161:30 - to show that this was the original
161:33 - record and this is the total that has
161:35 - been calculated by this particular tool
161:37 - so let's just see how it is going to
161:39 - work I want the total of sales quantity
161:43 - discount and profit these are the four
161:45 - values whose total I want
161:49 - next what I can do is I can click on run
161:51 - and wait for a few seconds till it has
161:53 - finished running
161:55 - this is how it's looking
161:59 - foreign
162:04 - if I just click on this output tab over
162:07 - here or using this ankle
162:10 - then I would be getting these four
162:13 - columns running total underscore sales
162:15 - quantity discount and profit this means
162:19 - that this is the total values that have
162:21 - been calculated by this particular tool
162:24 - if you go to the very last record you
162:26 - would be of course getting the highest
162:28 - value or the total value of the sales
162:29 - quantity discount and profit if you take
162:33 - a look on the profit values then there
162:35 - is a point where these values are in
162:36 - negatives which means I'm not getting a
162:38 - total profit I am getting some of the
162:40 - loss from my sales but slowly if you see
162:43 - uh the values have again
162:45 - converted them into the positives that
162:48 - means the total value is a profit or a
162:49 - loss that would be getting for the last
162:51 - record
162:53 - so this is how the running total uh tool
162:55 - works it is actually used to give you a
162:57 - summary of the numeric field start of
162:59 - pin uh working on
163:02 - next we have is the summarize tool now
163:04 - this is a really important tool in
163:06 - altrex and we are going to use it often
163:10 - whenever we are developing the workflows
163:12 - so let us understand it's working first
163:13 - of all
163:14 - it is used to perform the various
163:17 - actions which could be the functions or
163:19 - the calculations on the data it can like
163:23 - return the sum of the column
163:25 - for the data which is basically
163:28 - calculated by adding all the rows in the
163:31 - column it can return the minimum or the
163:33 - maximum value in the column it can count
163:35 - the number of rows it can group the
163:37 - column of a data by identical values it
163:39 - can concatenate the string values it can
163:41 - perform a variety of mathematical
163:43 - calculations and even perform spatial
163:46 - object processing
163:48 - now uh these are a variety of steps that
163:52 - are really important whenever we are
163:53 - working with the workflow right so let's
163:56 - just see some of the actions one by one
163:58 - to understand it
164:00 - let me just grab my summarize tool and
164:02 - connect it
164:04 - connect my database
164:06 - the database here I'm using is the Excel
164:08 - sheet for the consumer segment okay
164:11 - now here we have two things the fields
164:13 - and the actions the fields is basically
164:16 - the data fields that has been taken from
164:18 - the input data set
164:20 - along with its data type okay
164:23 - now what we can do is we can just select
164:26 - some of the fields and if you want to
164:28 - select multiple Fields you can just
164:29 - shift and click on them
164:31 - [Music]
164:35 - like this okay or what you can do is
164:37 - Ctrl click them
164:40 - to select multiple fields
164:43 - um then we have is a select option which
164:46 - has different options like all which
164:48 - means it would select all the fields
164:50 - none it would deselect all the fields
164:52 - numeric it would select only the fields
164:54 - with the numeric data type string would
164:56 - select only the string fields and
164:58 - spatial would select only the fields
165:00 - with the spatial data types right
165:03 - so these are the kinds of the options
165:04 - that we could perform Let me just select
165:06 - the numeric Fields so you can see the
165:07 - row ID sales quantity discount and
165:10 - profit have been selected next uh what
165:13 - we need to do is once we have selected
165:15 - the fields we come to this add option
165:18 - so uh this add option is actually used
165:20 - to just search for the action that we
165:22 - need to perform we just click on it
165:25 - here are the different options that
165:27 - could be performed we can find the
165:29 - minimum value the maximum value the sum
165:31 - count count non-null count distinct
165:33 - count distinct normal count null Group
165:36 - by first last and these are the number
165:39 - of the functions that could be applied
165:40 - like numeric functions string functions
165:43 - uh spatial functions behavioral analysis
165:46 - and the report functions okay
165:48 - so if you just go to the numeric
165:50 - functions uh here is the number of the
165:52 - functions that could be applied like
165:54 - average percentile median and mode
165:57 - so what I'm going to do is I'm just
165:58 - going to select none and I'm going to
166:00 - show you the different functions that
166:02 - could be applied for each of the data
166:04 - types that is double string
166:06 - and we don't have spatial data so let me
166:08 - just go with numeric and the string
166:10 - values only okay so first of all let's
166:11 - just select these four
166:13 - I'm ignoring the row ID because that's
166:16 - no need for that
166:17 - next what we can do is just go to this
166:19 - numeric fields and here select the
166:21 - percentile
166:23 - now in the action field we have the
166:27 - fields the action style could be found
166:28 - and what would be the name of the output
166:30 - field if you want to change the name of
166:31 - the output field that you can do if you
166:32 - want to change the action that also you
166:34 - can do for example in the case of sales
166:36 - I want the max value in the case of
166:40 - quantity I want the percentile
166:42 - in the case of discount
166:44 - or in the case of discount I want
166:46 - percentile in the quantity again I want
166:47 - the minimum value
166:49 - and in the case of profit I want the sum
166:52 - okay so these are the four different
166:55 - actions that I want to perform on the
166:57 - different fields and once you have
166:59 - selected all of these things you can
167:00 - just simply click on run
167:03 - and wait for a few seconds let's just go
167:05 - to the output so it is giving me the
167:07 - maximum value of the sales
167:09 - the minimum quantity that was purchased
167:11 - was one the percentile discount is 0.2
167:14 - percent and the total sum of the profit
167:17 - that I have taken is this much of the
167:19 - profit okay
167:22 - uh now the names of the columns have
167:25 - been named accordingly which means you
167:28 - can understand that what's what is going
167:30 - on in these right
167:33 - so uh this is for the numeric values let
167:35 - me just copy this
167:38 - create a new workflow to show some of
167:40 - the functions for the string values as
167:42 - well okay here I can just paste them
167:44 - and for this tool I'm just going to make
167:48 - the changes by selecting the string
167:50 - values
167:52 - and what are the uh those things that I
167:55 - could add is Count null count not null
167:57 - so let me just give go with the count
168:01 - if you want to delete any of these
168:03 - actions you can just simply select that
168:04 - action and click on minus select that
168:06 - action click on minus okay
168:08 - so this is what I'm going to go with
168:10 - that is the count in the case of
168:12 - category I want Count distinct in the
168:14 - case of category a subcategory also I
168:17 - want to count distinct in the case of
168:19 - segment I want
168:21 - count non-null uh in the case of country
168:24 - I want Count null
168:27 - and so on okay
168:29 - I have created a bunch of different
168:31 - actions
168:32 - uh in the case of customer ID
168:35 - I want the longest okay
168:38 - now once I have selected all these
168:40 - operations I can click on run
168:45 - begins and let us just go to this output
168:49 - to select the uh to just see the values
168:51 - so first of all is count that would give
168:53 - me the count of order ID next is Count 2
168:55 - that is giving me the count of the ship
168:57 - mode which is actually the total number
168:59 - of the records
169:00 - next is the longest customer ID then the
169:03 - customer name customer segment then
169:06 - count of the null in the country is zero
169:08 - that means there are known all values
169:09 - right similarly for the count distinct
169:12 - category there are three distinct
169:13 - categories that's why it's giving me the
169:15 - result as three similarly in the case of
169:18 - subcategory it is counting it as 17 that
169:21 - are 17 distinct subcategories at present
169:24 - and finally we have the count of the
169:27 - product name so there are
169:29 - 5191 products that are available that
169:32 - means
169:33 - everyone has purchased some products so
169:36 - this is how the summarize tool works in
169:38 - the transform tab that's all for this
169:41 - video that's all for the tools for the
169:43 - transform tab and thanks for watching
169:48 - hello everyone welcome back to the
169:50 - altrex tutorials in this video we are
169:53 - going to talk about a new tab that is
169:57 - the reporting tab in our tricks so uh
170:00 - this tab might not be by default present
170:02 - in your altrex designer view so what
170:05 - we're going to do is actually uh see
170:07 - that how can we add the few tabs that
170:09 - are supported by altrex okay
170:12 - so what we are going to do first of all
170:14 - let's just go to this option this plus
170:16 - icon which would automatically give you
170:19 - an option to add or remove the tools so
170:21 - let's just click on that this would open
170:23 - up the configure tool palette that means
170:25 - all the tools that are actually
170:27 - supported by Ultra expert are not being
170:29 - shown on your screen right now so here
170:32 - if you just go and check there are many
170:34 - of the tools that are actually supported
170:36 - by altrex okay
170:38 - so from here what I'm gonna do is I'm
170:40 - just going to support uh this check on
170:43 - this reporting tab
170:45 - so this would give me a bunch of other
170:48 - tools that I'm gonna use
170:50 - uh like email image inside interactive
170:53 - chart layout map legend overlay render
170:56 - report and table okay so let's just
170:59 - click on OK once we do that this is the
171:02 - reporting tab that would be present in
171:04 - front of us and these are the tools
171:06 - supported by the reporting tab in this
171:09 - video we are going to take a look at the
171:10 - table tool and the interactive chart
171:12 - tool which are of very important in this
171:17 - whole workflow building thing okay
171:20 - so first of all let's just bring up the
171:21 - table tool
171:24 - now I have already used the input data
171:26 - tool to get my data set let us just
171:29 - understand the usage of the table tool
171:32 - as the name suggests table tool is used
171:34 - to create a data table or a pivot table
171:37 - to Output the report through the render
171:40 - tool okay
171:42 - so as you can see this is the render
171:43 - tool if you want to Output the report
171:45 - the render tool is what we are going to
171:47 - use
171:48 - so if we just talk about this tool we
171:51 - first have the table mode which means
171:52 - you can select the basic table for the
171:53 - pivot table pivot table is basically
171:58 - used when we are using the data from the
172:00 - crosstab tool in case you have not seen
172:02 - the video the crosstab tool I would
172:04 - recommend you to First go and watch it
172:06 - and then you would be able to understand
172:08 - it easier uh that's what I'm trying to
172:10 - say okay so I'm just going to go with
172:12 - the basic table
172:14 - next option we have is the group by
172:16 - option that means the fields through
172:18 - which you want to group by these um
172:20 - values if there is anything so what I'm
172:23 - gonna do is I'm just gonna Group by
172:25 - category
172:26 - and subcategory okay next we have is the
172:30 - value of a table width which is
172:33 - basically
172:34 - how you want to
172:36 - adjust your table so automatic that
172:39 - means the minimum width percentage you
172:41 - want a particular percentage fix you
172:42 - want a particular fixed value okay so
172:44 - I'm just gonna go with automatic
172:46 - right next we have is the
172:51 - column headings if you want to show the
172:54 - column headings or not
172:56 - or then we have the option of a bar
172:58 - graph
172:59 - so if you want to create a bar graph
173:03 - just a second layer again let's just add
173:05 - a little bit
173:08 - yeah
173:09 - so if you want uh to create a bar graph
173:11 - that means you can specify the data
173:13 - field for which the bar graph needs to
173:16 - be created in the table
173:18 - and this paragraph option is only
173:20 - available for the basic table in case
173:22 - you have selected the pivot table over
173:23 - here then this option would not be
173:25 - available
173:26 - now you can just click on the settings
173:28 - to modify the style of the graph
173:31 - like its weight scale its base value
173:34 - label bars colors Etc but I'm not just
173:36 - gonna go into very much deep into this
173:39 - bar graph option right now right now
173:41 - we're just going to focus on the table
173:42 - tool okay
173:44 - uh next is show column headings which is
173:46 - of course let me just uncheck this bar
173:49 - graph so that would be available to us
173:51 - if you want to show the column headings
173:52 - then we have the power column of the
173:55 - methodology configuration option
173:57 - if the table mode is basic then we can
174:00 - configure The Columns and if the table
174:03 - mode is the pivot mode then we need to
174:06 - configure the methodologies so in case
174:08 - we have selected basic mode so we are
174:11 - getting the option as per column
174:12 - configuration
174:13 - now we can use it to select the data
174:17 - fields that we want to include in the
174:18 - table
174:19 - using these up and down arrows that are
174:21 - present over here we can just set their
174:24 - order we can just rename these fields as
174:27 - well so what I'm going to do is I'm just
174:28 - gonna uncheck some of these fields
174:32 - okay and I'm just going to go with the
174:38 - only few Fields over here okay
174:41 - categories of category product name
174:48 - like this okay I am just uh interested
174:52 - in these fields only okay
174:55 - now if you want uh to configure the
174:58 - attribute of a particular field you can
174:59 - just select that particular field and
175:01 - these attributes would be available for
175:03 - you if you want to get a new name for
175:05 - the field so
175:06 - ensure the consumer name I'm just going
175:09 - to go with the name
175:10 - if you want to select its width its
175:12 - alignment its borders prefix suffix
175:15 - anything you want to select you can just
175:17 - select
175:19 - uh this is the easy places for the
175:21 - number of the decimal places so if you
175:23 - just select some numerical value let's
175:25 - say the sales value so this field would
175:27 - be
175:28 - enabled okay
175:30 - and like in the prefix I want a dollar
175:32 - symbol to show me that this was the
175:35 - dollar amount and in the end I want to
175:39 - I don't want hfx just for the prefix I
175:41 - won't do dollar okay
175:43 - for the sales
175:44 - and that's it if you want to create some
175:47 - of the column rules you can just create
175:48 - the column rules which basically uh says
175:51 - that what you want to do if you want to
175:53 - apply some kind of a formattings uh for
175:56 - it so the sales rule one is you apply to
176:00 - the data when
176:02 - the
176:03 - sales is greater than equal to
176:07 - a thousand dollars
176:10 - you can just save
176:13 - the background color
176:15 - must be kind of like green
176:18 - so if the sales value is greater than a
176:20 - thousand dollar I want a green uh
176:22 - background color okay
176:25 - so this is the rule that I have applied
176:28 - okay now next two options we have is the
176:32 - default table settings that means the
176:34 - style options that we want are table to
176:37 - contain would be changed over here or if
176:40 - you want to create a rule for um to be
176:43 - applied to All The Columns of the data
176:45 - that you can apply using this create row
176:47 - rule option
176:49 - so these are the options that you can
176:52 - control or configure in this table tool
176:55 - now once you are happy with the changes
176:57 - that you have made you can click on run
177:01 - and yes so here is how the output is
177:05 - looking
177:07 - we have categorized them or we have
177:09 - grouped them on the basis of category
177:11 - and subcategory
177:13 - and this is the table
177:16 - uh this is the table that we have got
177:18 - over here
177:19 - just a second
177:24 - okay now uh
177:28 - if you want to get to show the staple
177:33 - how would you be able to show it so for
177:36 - that what we need to do is
177:39 - to view the individual records and see
177:42 - whether the changes that you have made
177:44 - in the table are been actually made or
177:47 - not we can simply use a browse tool that
177:49 - is present in the in-out tab okay so
177:52 - once we have used the browse tool and
177:53 - run the workflow this is the kind of the
177:55 - output that we would be getting as you
177:57 - can see the number of the fields have
177:59 - been reduced drastically
178:01 - we are now only getting the fields which
178:04 - we actually uh modified right and if you
178:09 - just want to scroll up and down to get a
178:11 - better view that also you can get
178:14 - here you can see in the sales the prefix
178:16 - is added that is a dollar symbol and
178:19 - whenever the sales quantity is more than
178:21 - a thousand dollars we are getting the
178:23 - color the background color as green this
178:25 - was the rule that we created for this
178:27 - values right so you can see all these
178:30 - values are colored in green now so this
178:32 - is how the whole field uh the whole
178:34 - table tool is looking
178:37 - now let us talk about how can you
178:40 - actually render this table okay
178:43 - now here what we have done is created a
178:46 - copy of these uh two things the basic
178:48 - table and the data in order to render it
178:52 - we go to the reporting Tab and grab the
178:54 - window tool the render tool is actually
178:56 - used to render or transform the report
178:59 - Snippets into the presentation quality
179:01 - reports
179:02 - uh into a variety of formats now the
179:04 - formats supported by it are these HTML
179:07 - compressor PDF RTF word XL PNG image or
179:10 - a specific output file so from this you
179:13 - need to select the specific output file
179:15 - option in the output file you can just
179:17 - click on this save file and select the
179:20 - format in which you want to save the
179:21 - file I am going with the Excel and here
179:24 - you need to type a name so let me just
179:25 - grab the name that is report Table
179:30 - over here and click on Save now once you
179:33 - do that the
179:36 - path would be taken
179:38 - you can just select these different
179:41 - options like if you want a header you
179:43 - want a footer for the table or not
179:46 - that you can just select okay the page
179:49 - of this paper size the orientation for
179:52 - the report as well
179:53 - then click on run
179:55 - once you do that
179:57 - the rendering needs to be completed
180:01 - so let's see when it's completed you can
180:04 - just go to this location where you have
180:06 - saved the file and
180:08 - you would see that the changes have been
180:10 - made so here is the report Table that we
180:13 - just created the Excel sheet and this is
180:15 - how it is looking uh it has been
180:18 - rendered as it is we required like all
180:20 - the changes all the rules have been
180:22 - applied so that's all for the render
180:24 - tool and that's all for this video as
180:26 - well thanks for watching
180:28 - hello everyone welcome to altrex
180:30 - tutorials in this video we are going to
180:33 - talk about the creation of a visual data
180:36 - representation in altrex so it is
180:39 - possible through uh different tools but
180:42 - we would be looking at the table tool
180:44 - and the interactive chart tool which are
180:47 - primarily used for this purpose so if we
180:50 - talk about the table tool we have
180:52 - studied all about it in the previous
180:54 - video in case you haven't watched it
180:56 - already I would recommend you to just go
180:58 - there and watch it first to understand
181:00 - its Basics because in this video I'm not
181:03 - just going to explain the basics again
181:05 - I'm simply just going to show you the
181:07 - application of the table tool
181:10 - especially the bar chart part so let's
181:13 - just go to the table Tool uh this is the
181:15 - basic table tool that we have been using
181:18 - now here if you see there is this option
181:20 - of bar graph so what I have done over
181:22 - here is in this bar graph option I have
181:25 - selected sales and the settings all the
181:28 - settings I have kept as same
181:30 - okay or basically the default settings
181:32 - then what I have done is I have used the
181:35 - render tool and in the render tool I
181:37 - have
181:38 - outputted it in the form of a PDF file
181:41 - so once I run this workflow what would
181:44 - happen is I would be getting this kind
181:46 - of a report
181:47 - uh now all the settings for the table
181:50 - tool are same as we did for the previous
181:52 - file but the format of the file has
181:55 - changed from Excel to PDF right now now
181:58 - you can see all these things have been
182:00 - shown like this only but whatever the
182:02 - sales amount is like 732 is the sales
182:04 - amount so a bar a slight bar of light
182:07 - blue color is shown along with its value
182:09 - 71 for 90. so this is how the bar chart
182:12 - tool works we have selected it for the
182:15 - sales value so for the sales value this
182:17 - is how it's being shown
182:19 - like it shows us the bar that would
182:22 - roughly give us an estimate of the
182:24 - quantity that is being or the total
182:26 - sales amount that it is contributing uh
182:30 - with respect to the total amount so this
182:32 - is how we can use the barge out of the
182:34 - visual representation within a table
182:36 - using the table tool now let us move on
182:39 - to the tool that is specifically
182:40 - designed for this purpose and that is
182:42 - the interactive chart tool so first of
182:45 - all let me just save this workflow and
182:47 - close it because we don't need it
182:49 - anymore
182:49 - we are going to take a look at the
182:52 - interactive chart tool now
182:54 - what is this interactive chart tool it
182:56 - is used to basically visualize the data
182:58 - in the workflow we can create charts uh
183:01 - interactive multi-layered bar charts
183:03 - line graphs skater plots pie charts and
183:06 - more we can use your uh the data set
183:09 - that we've been using to calculate the
183:11 - sum count average minimum maximum of the
183:13 - selected fields and output them into the
183:16 - different file types again using the
183:18 - render tool so first of all let's just
183:20 - get the input file this is our input
183:22 - tool let me just get the file I'm
183:25 - starting with a simple file so let's
183:26 - just go with this course file right now
183:30 - and now what I'm gonna do is apply the
183:32 - interactive chart
183:34 - uh tool over here okay
183:36 - so
183:38 - we can just configure the chart by
183:40 - clicking on this configure chart option
183:43 - and it's going to open up this kind of a
183:45 - dialog box the interactive chart dialog
183:47 - box which would help us to configure the
183:49 - chart okay so we can just create the
183:51 - chart over here
183:53 - in this as you can see there is a format
183:55 - of a chart that's been given to us so we
183:57 - can just create the chart like this
184:01 - control the zoom control the
184:03 - location and everything okay
184:06 - so for this data first you have to
184:08 - ensure that what kind of a chart you
184:10 - want to create I want to create a bar
184:12 - chart okay
184:13 - so once you are in this interactive
184:15 - chart workflow you can just go to create
184:19 - click on layer and here you need to just
184:21 - select on ADD layer option uh you can
184:24 - give a name to the layout by default
184:26 - it's taken as layer 0 but you can give
184:28 - it any name so what I'm gonna do is I'm
184:30 - just gonna add bar chart okay
184:34 - then we have the type option in this you
184:37 - need to just select the type of the
184:39 - chart to the bar
184:40 - then uh we have the X which means you
184:44 - need to select the column or which you
184:45 - want on the x axis so I want the uh
184:49 - score on the x axis on the y axis I want
184:52 - the number of R's okay
184:54 - so that's number of hours and scores to
184:57 - be taken over here okay
184:59 - then what we can do is we can just
185:05 - um
185:06 - go to the template if you want a
185:08 - particular template to be used otherwise
185:10 - we can just go with it and
185:15 - so once you have made all the changes as
185:17 - per your choice you can just close that
185:19 - a dialog box and bring in the browse
185:21 - tool this would help you to take a look
185:23 - at the chart that you have created so
185:25 - this is the bar chart that we have
185:27 - created based on the data
185:29 - as you can see
185:30 - um
185:31 - here is 98 that is the score and 9 is
185:35 - the number of the hours the student has
185:36 - studied so this is how we have got the
185:38 - chart for us but
185:40 - uh if you want to just zoom in you can
185:42 - just zoom in and out of it to get a
185:44 - better look at how the things are
185:45 - looking inside the chart
185:48 - right so this is how basically the chart
185:50 - is created and if you want to create it
185:52 - for different things what we can do is
185:55 - first of all get rid of this data set
185:58 - and bring in our sales data because it
186:01 - has more scope of trading charts it has
186:03 - more values right
186:04 - so let's just go to this output Excel
186:07 - file and get in our consumer data set
186:09 - right again we go to this chart option
186:12 - configure chart
186:14 - now there are all types of
186:16 - configurations that you can apply uh
186:18 - right now you can see the score and the
186:20 - number of hours is missing so what we
186:21 - can do is just get rid of it add a new
186:24 - layer again it's going to be a bar chart
186:30 - right now the type is again going to be
186:32 - bar in the column uh I'm just going to
186:35 - get the
186:37 - in the x axis I'm just going to get the
186:40 - sales amount
186:42 - and in the Y I'm just going to get the
186:45 - category
186:47 - okay so the category by sales is what I
186:50 - want uh next what I can do is just
186:52 - basically close it go to the browse tool
186:55 - and run it to get the overview
186:58 - it's going to take a few seconds
187:00 - depending upon the processing speed of
187:02 - your computer and then it would render
187:04 - an output for you
187:06 - so once we have made the changes uh then
187:10 - this is how the output would be looking
187:12 - this is the sales on the basis of the
187:15 - category that is Furniture office
187:17 - supplies and the technology category
187:19 - and these are the individual sales
187:21 - records that we are getting right now
187:22 - okay
187:23 - uh Now using this uh chart tool we can
187:26 - actually configure the chart the way we
187:29 - like okay so there are multiple
187:30 - configuration options that are available
187:32 - like if you just go to this layer option
187:36 - there are these different types of
187:38 - um
187:39 - options that you can perform
187:42 - like the opacity you can select the
187:44 - Border width you can select
187:46 - the Border color you can just select and
187:49 - everything like this okay
187:51 - so this is how it's gonna look
187:54 - um
187:56 - we can just select the different bar
187:57 - modes like stack or overlay
188:00 - or relative to one another
188:04 - next we have is the option for the
188:06 - Legend So if you want to work with the
188:08 - legions like if you want to show the
188:10 - legions or not then you can just select
188:12 - them also you can just
188:14 - hide them all together if you don't want
188:17 - to be shown
188:19 - in the Lewis panel
188:21 - here you can just select the orientation
188:23 - of the chart as well
188:25 - like this
188:30 - so this is what we can do
188:32 - uh then we have this access part where
188:35 - we can just select the display range
188:38 - like what is the maximum and the minimum
188:40 - range that you want the access line you
188:42 - want to show or hide the grid lines you
188:44 - want to show or hide
188:47 - Etc all these things you can just select
188:49 - okay
188:52 - then we have the batch if you want to
188:54 - create patched charts or not so this is
188:57 - how we work with these charts this is a
188:59 - simple bar chart that we have created
189:01 - now let us just move on to another type
189:04 - of a chart uh that we're going to create
189:06 - which is a pie chart let's just see how
189:07 - do we create that real quick
189:10 - so what I'm gonna do is just create a
189:12 - new workflow
189:14 - and in this I'm just gonna copy these
189:17 - two tools actually the three tools can
189:20 - be copied
189:22 - all of these three rules can be copied
189:24 - and pasted over here
189:26 - now for the pie chart what we are going
189:28 - to do is actually create it on the basis
189:30 - of the sales and the category that means
189:32 - there are three categories and I'm just
189:34 - going to get the bifurcated amount of
189:36 - sales for each of these categories
189:38 - so um
189:40 - let's see how do we do that
189:42 - so in the configure chart option we go
189:45 - to the layer and just select the type to
189:48 - pipe the values I have taken to sales
189:51 - and the labels I have set to category
189:53 - this is how it is looking
189:55 - and the name of course I have renamed it
189:57 - to pie chart for more clarity on what is
189:59 - going on now this is how it is looking
190:02 - it is giving me the percentage of the
190:04 - sales
190:04 - in case you want to give it a chart
190:07 - title you can just click here and
190:09 - provide it with a title or if you want
190:11 - to save it as a PNG file you can just
190:13 - click on this floppy disk icon and you
190:16 - would be able to save it so I'm just
190:17 - going to save it as a chart
190:20 - and let's just see how it is looking so
190:22 - this is my chart.png
190:25 - this is how it's looking this is a
190:26 - legend that tells you that blue
190:28 - represents technology orange represents
190:30 - furniture and green represents office
190:32 - supplies so that's how the charts are
190:34 - created in altrex that's all for this
190:36 - video thanks for watching
190:39 - hello everyone welcome to altrex
190:41 - tutorials in this video we are going to
190:44 - take a look at the chart creation
190:45 - process only but in this video we are
190:48 - going to take a look at how can we
190:50 - create batch charts and what is
190:52 - basically the concept of batch charts in
190:54 - altrex so the batch charts are basically
190:57 - used to group the data as we previously
191:00 - saw in the video that we created a pie
191:03 - chart which provided us the sales
191:05 - percentage and the sales amount on the
191:08 - basis of the category now there are two
191:10 - things as we know in our data set that
191:12 - are present for grouping the data that
191:14 - is category and subcategory
191:16 - so here we have category and then we
191:18 - have subcategory so what I want to do is
191:20 - I want to create separate pie charts for
191:22 - three separate categories
191:24 - firstly in the furniture
191:26 - category chart I want the different
191:30 - subcategories that are part of the
191:32 - furniture and then I want them to show
191:34 - me that what is the total sales that has
191:36 - been done in each of these categories
191:39 - right similarly I want to create it for
191:41 - office supplies category and then for
191:43 - the technology category now instead of
191:45 - creating three charts each for separate
191:48 - categories what I'm gonna do is I'm just
191:50 - going to create a single chart with the
191:52 - help of the bad chart option altrex
191:55 - would automatically create copies of the
191:57 - same chart for me right so let us see
191:59 - how we are going to do that
192:01 - here what we have is three tools the
192:04 - input tool the chart tool and the browse
192:08 - tool so first of all let's just go to
192:10 - the interactive chart tool click on
192:11 - configure chart option in the
192:12 - configuration panel to open up this
192:14 - interactive chart okay now first of all
192:17 - you need to go to this batch option and
192:19 - by default it would be turn to off so
192:20 - you need to click here to on
192:23 - it would ask you to select the columns
192:25 - through which you are going to group by
192:27 - your options so uh I'm going to group
192:29 - them by category so from the drop down
192:31 - you can just select category if you want
192:34 - another field through which you want to
192:36 - group it by so you can select the second
192:37 - field as well
192:39 - if you want custom title for the badged
192:41 - charts that you can
192:43 - do but I'm not just going to go with it
192:46 - uh the category is written and I'm fine
192:48 - with it okay next go to the layers
192:51 - option click on ADD layer and let's just
192:54 - provide it a name like pie chart
193:02 - now select the type 2 pi
193:05 - for the values what I'm going to do is
193:07 - select the sales value
193:09 - and let's just give it a few seconds
193:13 - till it is going to fetch all the
193:14 - records from the sales and put them over
193:17 - here so this kind of a chart is being
193:19 - generated which is of course very
193:21 - difficult to understand because it is
193:22 - not a correct chart
193:24 - then what I'm going to do in the labels
193:25 - column I am going to select the
193:28 - subcategory
193:29 - so now
193:31 - our chart is clean and what we are
193:32 - getting over here is the name of the
193:34 - category which is furniture
193:36 - now in this furniture we have four
193:38 - subcategories the chairs which is
193:40 - represented in the blue color tables
193:42 - represented in the orange color a
193:45 - bookcases represented in the green color
193:46 - and Furnishings represented in the red
193:48 - color so the total sales of the
193:51 - furniture
193:53 - whatever the total sales value of the
193:55 - furniture's was it has been bifurcated
193:58 - into these four subcategories and
194:01 - it has taken the percentages as this so
194:04 - in the furniture most of the sales has
194:06 - been done by chairs that is 43.6 percent
194:09 - then if we just click on the second page
194:12 - we would have the office supplies
194:14 - category
194:15 - which combines these subcategories from
194:18 - Storage till fasteners
194:20 - now in each of these subcategories how
194:22 - the bifurcation of the sales has been
194:24 - done is been shown on the percentage
194:26 - basis on the third we have the third
194:28 - subcategory which is the technology
194:30 - category having four subcategories again
194:32 - with phones accessories machines and
194:34 - copiers
194:35 - now what customizations we can do over
194:38 - here is by going into this chart option
194:43 - uh and in this font option like if you
194:46 - want to change the font it says
194:47 - everything that you can change like if
194:50 - you want to increase the size so as to
194:52 - get a better look at what is happening
194:53 - over here
194:54 - okay then we have layers option through
194:57 - which you can just uh change the colors
195:00 - like these are the colors that have been
195:01 - taken by default but if you want some
195:04 - other color scheme to be there you want
195:05 - some other colors to be there that also
195:08 - you can change
195:09 - okay
195:11 - like this the Divergent scales are there
195:15 - or the sequential scales are there too
195:19 - for a particular color that you can just
195:21 - select okay then we have the slice label
195:24 - that is what you want to be shown on the
195:26 - slice label right now the percentage has
195:28 - been shown if you want the value has to
195:29 - be shown as well that means what is the
195:31 - total number of sales that was done
195:34 - that you want to show and the label that
195:36 - means the value of the subcategory that
195:39 - to which subcategory it belongs that
195:40 - also you can select I'm just going with
195:42 - label and percentage not with the value
195:43 - part the order is sorted which means
195:46 - they are all sorted and if you want to
195:49 - show the legend or not this is the
195:50 - legion part you want to show it you want
195:52 - to hide it
195:53 - and then if you just uh hover over it
195:56 - then we are getting some additional
195:57 - information as well so that is uh
196:00 - controlled through this hover text value
196:02 - so I don't want the percentage to be
196:04 - shown I just want the label and the
196:05 - values to be shown over here okay
196:06 - because the percentage is already
196:08 - visible over here
196:10 - next we have is the chart option which
196:11 - you can use to set the width of the
196:14 - chart
196:15 - in pixels or in inches or you can just
196:18 - select the um margins and The Parting
196:21 - color Etc the
196:23 - background color of the chart everything
196:24 - that you want you can just control from
196:27 - here okay
196:28 - so this is a custom color that I want
196:31 - this is the title
196:34 - if you want to change the title you can
196:36 - change it over here using latex or using
196:39 - a simple uh text as well then we have
196:42 - the access option
196:43 - which is not uh being used over here
196:46 - next we have is the legend if you want
196:48 - to just change the way the legend is
196:50 - being shown that you can do you can just
196:53 - work with its size its color
196:56 - let me just create a black color for the
196:57 - legend
196:59 - for better visibility
197:01 - then we have the box if you want a box
197:04 - to be there on the legend
197:06 - the color of the border for the legend
197:08 - it's going to be red
197:11 - and the background color or if you want
197:13 - a different background color let's just
197:14 - go with the
197:16 - this kind of color
197:19 - the orientation you wanted vertically or
197:21 - horizontally like this and the layer
197:23 - order of that
197:26 - what is the order of the layers
197:27 - accordingly you want that or not okay so
197:30 - this is where it is starting from
197:31 - Storage all the way to Fasteners if
197:34 - then
197:35 - you can just close this
197:37 - and using the browse tool you can just
197:39 - run the browse tool to get a look at the
197:42 - chart
197:47 - so here it is how it is looking you can
197:50 - just adjust it and see that these three
197:52 - charts are lined one after the other
197:55 - now let us just render the chart using
197:57 - the render tool so let's just delete
197:59 - this browse tool for a bit
198:01 - go to the reporting and here we have
198:04 - this render
198:06 - uh in this render what I'm gonna do is
198:08 - just select the
198:12 - specific output file and save it
198:16 - uh in the form of um PNG images three
198:20 - images would be created and select
198:23 - bulk charts or batch charts okay
198:30 - now click on Save
198:32 - and if you just go to that location
198:37 - badcharts.png is what we are getting
198:39 - over here
198:43 - so let me just take a look at this
198:52 - so uh this is the kind of the image that
198:54 - we are getting over here
198:57 - and if you just zoom in these are being
199:00 - created like this
199:01 - uh in the form of a PNG image okay now
199:04 - let's see what happens if we just
199:06 - um store it in the form of a PDF
199:08 - document
199:09 - show you for saving it I'm just going to
199:12 - select a PDF document
199:16 - here
199:17 - and you select batch charts as the name
199:23 - click on Save
199:25 - and click on run to run the workflow so
199:28 - that the actual saving process occurs
199:32 - okay now let's just see how it is
199:34 - looking
199:37 - so here it is three pages have been
199:39 - created for the PDF each for a different
199:40 - category along with its Legion along
199:43 - with its chart along with its everything
199:45 - so this is how we can use the render
199:48 - button to render the batch charts for us
199:51 - and that's all for this video with this
199:53 - we wrap up the whole tutorial course on
199:57 - altrex as well
199:58 - during this course we learned about the
200:01 - different tools and their
200:02 - functionalities we also got to see that
200:05 - what all actions we can perform through
200:07 - altrex and we got to understand that
200:10 - there are a bunch of things that we can
200:12 - do now with more practice we would be
200:14 - able to create a really good charts for
200:17 - us render them and use it as the tool it
200:21 - is meant to be
200:22 - so that's all for this video that's all
200:25 - for this course I hope you all learned
200:27 - something new throughout this course I
200:29 - really hope you all enjoyed this journey
