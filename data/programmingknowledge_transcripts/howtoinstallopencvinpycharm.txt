00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can install the opencv
00:06 - packages on your pycharm IDE
00:09 - so as you can see I have created a very
00:12 - simple opencv project and the main
00:14 - package for opencv python is CV2 and I'm
00:19 - also adding the numpy package in my code
00:24 - right so I want to run this code but it
00:27 - shows me this red squiggly line here and
00:31 - when I run this code it's going to show
00:33 - me this error which is no module name
00:36 - CV2
00:37 - now in order to install the CV2 package
00:40 - I can just click on file and then click
00:43 - on settings option here and then I can
00:48 - just collapse this and then click on
00:51 - Project colon whatever my project name
00:54 - is my project name is opencb proj so you
00:58 - can see a project and then the project
01:00 - name click on python interpreter here
01:04 - choose the python interpreter you have
01:07 - so I'm going to choose my python
01:09 - interpreter and once you choose the
01:12 - python interpreter click on plus here
01:14 - and here just search for opencv hyphen
01:18 - python okay so search for opencv hyphen
01:22 - Python and you will be able to see this
01:24 - opencv hyphen python option just click
01:27 - on install package
01:30 - which is going to install this opencv
01:33 - python package and once this package is
01:36 - installed you can see this message which
01:38 - says package opencv python is
01:41 - successfully installed so once that's
01:43 - done you can close this window
01:45 - and you will be able to see this opencv
01:48 - python is installed on your pycharm IDE
01:52 - also it installs numpy because it has a
01:58 - dependency on numpy so both the packages
02:01 - are installed click on apply and then
02:03 - click on OK so let me just run my
02:06 - program so I'm going to click on run
02:08 - here and you can see it opens this image
02:12 - which is using this CV2 package which
02:16 - comes inside The opencv Hyphen python
02:20 - package okay so this is how you can
02:22 - install opencv on your pycharm IDE I
02:26 - hope you enjoyed this video and I will
