00:00 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:02 - show you how you can create your first
00:04 - swing Java GUI application in intellig
00:08 - idea IDE so let's get started first of
00:11 - all open your uh intellig idea IDE and
00:16 - in here we are going to create a new
00:17 - project so just click new project here
00:20 - and in here we need to choose the first
00:22 - option which says Java okay and then uh
00:27 - we just need to click next
00:30 - and in here we need to just click next
00:34 - once again because we don't want to
00:35 - choose any default template so just
00:38 - click next and in here we just need to
00:41 - give the name to our app so for example
00:46 - app swing okay and then click finish so
00:51 - it's going to create a blank Java
00:54 - project for us so this is our project
00:57 - and inside our project there is a s
01:00 - Source package or Source folder and we
01:03 - are going to create a new package inside
01:06 - this folder and then we are going to
01:07 - create uh new class inside the package
01:10 - so for example I'm going to just click
01:13 - on uh the source so I'm going to WR
01:16 - click on the source folder and then I'm
01:18 - going to create a new package and I'm
01:20 - going to name my package as com do
01:24 - code bind for example okay and click
01:27 - okay and then inside
01:32 - [Music]
01:39 - [Music]
01:46 - [Music]
01:53 - [Music]
02:04 - [Music]
02:26 - [Music]
02:29 - to uh you know uh pick and place any uh
02:34 - component from the pallet you need to
02:37 - set first of all your layout using this
02:40 - layout manager so there are uh some
02:44 - layouts you can see here
02:46 - defined so for now I will leave the
02:49 - default layout which is grid layout
02:52 - manager here okay and what I'm going to
02:55 - do is I'm going to add a j button here
02:58 - so I'm going to just drag and drop A J
03:00 - button and it's going to just um you
03:03 - know be placed inside your J panel now
03:08 - let's give the name to our J panel so by
03:11 - default you can see field name and the J
03:14 - panel name is panel one for example so
03:18 - we can change the name of our panel as
03:21 - for
03:22 - example
03:24 - panel main okay and the name to our butt
03:29 - Buton will be for example
03:32 - button uh MSG for message okay so you
03:37 - can give the names which will be uh like
03:41 - a ID to your button okay and when you go
03:45 - to the app. Java class here you can see
03:49 - whatever name you have given here they
03:51 - will be uh you know created in your app.
03:55 - Java class so there will be some private
03:58 - variables created whenever you define
04:02 - the this name here okay so this is a
04:06 - simple uh J panel inside which we have a
04:11 - button so for example we want to show
04:14 - some message when we click this button
04:16 - so how do we do it first of all uh I
04:19 - want to explain something about this
04:21 - pallet so from this pallet you can see
04:25 - there are so many uh you know components
04:27 - here like J panel button
04:30 - jxt Fields text pan combo box list and
04:35 - everything else which it supports you
04:38 - whatever component you want from here
04:41 - you just need to drag and drop here and
04:44 - then you just need to give a listener to
04:48 - this component so for example I want to
04:51 - press this button and I want to show
04:53 - some message so I will uh just right
04:56 - click on this button and I'm going to
04:59 - add a list to it so just right click on
05:01 - the button and then you see here it says
05:06 - create listener so just click this
05:09 - create listener and there are uh you
05:12 - know list of uh listeners which buttons
05:16 - can listen to so for example default
05:18 - listener is action event so this is just
05:21 - like clicking the button and then
05:24 - component listener or Focus listener or
05:27 - uh input method listener item listener
05:30 - key listener so there are few listeners
05:33 - for the button so that it can listens
05:36 - for some events so we are going to
05:39 - choose the default listener which is
05:41 - action listener so just click on this
05:44 - first option and it's going to
05:46 - automatically create a method for you
05:50 - you can see in the background so just
05:52 - choose uh this action performed and then
05:55 - click okay here so this is going to
05:58 - create
06:00 - this method by default for you okay so
06:04 - this is your action
06:06 - list method which is called by your
06:09 - button which is this one right and by
06:12 - default it overwrites a function which
06:14 - is action performed and inside this
06:17 - action perform you can write some code
06:19 - so for example we want to show some
06:20 - message so there is a component in uh
06:24 - Java Swing which is called J option pin
06:27 - it's like a message box which opens and
06:31 - shows some message so J option pin do
06:34 - show message dialogue so just call a
06:36 - method called show message dialog which
06:38 - takes two argument which first is null
06:42 - which is the context here and second is
06:45 - the message for example you want to just
06:48 - show the message hello world so just
06:51 - write
06:53 - hello world here and then save your code
06:58 - now at this point your code will not run
07:01 - because you don't have any main method
07:05 - in your class so let's uh create a main
07:08 - method in our class so just go below
07:11 - this and just write public static void
07:15 - main or you can just write
07:17 - psvm for public status vo Main and then
07:21 - click or press a tab here which is going
07:24 - to create this method for you and inside
07:27 - your main method what we are going to do
07:29 - is we are going to create a JF frame so
07:31 - just write
07:33 - J frame and then name your frame for
07:37 - example frame itself is equal to new
07:41 - jframe and it takes one argument which
07:43 - is the name of your app for example app
07:47 - itself okay we take our frame object and
07:50 - call a method called set content pane
07:54 - here and we can uh set the new content
07:57 - pane here so we want to call this uh you
08:00 - know object which is J panel in here so
08:04 - we can just call our class which is app
08:07 - and then we can call this uh object
08:11 - which is panel main now there is few
08:15 - more things remaining here one is frame
08:19 - do set closing method so just write
08:23 - set default close operation and in here
08:27 - just write jframe dot exit on close Okay
08:33 - and then once again take your frame
08:35 - object and then call a method called
08:39 - pack so just call method called pack and
08:43 - at the last just call your frame and
08:45 - then we are going to set it visible so
08:48 - set visible is equal to True okay so
08:53 - this is our main method and in which we
08:56 - have defined the JF frame and we have
08:59 - called this panel inside the frame right
09:03 - now save your code and we are going to
09:06 - run it so just go here and then click
09:09 - this run button from here and it's going
09:12 - to ask you for the class which we want
09:15 - to run which is app class and then it's
09:18 - going to compile this class and then
09:20 - it's going to run it okay so let's see
09:24 - it runs so you can see there is a small
09:28 - you know here frame appeared here and
09:32 - it's like only button inside the frame
09:35 - so you can just make it bigger for now
09:38 - and when we click this button it's going
09:40 - to show some message so it shows hello
09:42 - world once again hello world okay so
09:46 - this is the very basic uh program which
09:50 - you can create in your intellig idea IDE
09:55 - which is a guy swing application here so
09:58 - I hope you have enjoyed this this video

10:01 - now
