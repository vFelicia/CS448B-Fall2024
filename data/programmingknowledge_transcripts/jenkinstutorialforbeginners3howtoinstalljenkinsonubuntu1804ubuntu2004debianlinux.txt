00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can download and install
00:04 - Jenkins on your Ubuntu or Debian based
00:07 - operating system so in order to install
00:10 - Jenkins
00:11 - you need to have Java installed on your
00:13 - system but we will look into the
00:16 - documentation which version of Java is
00:18 - required to install Jenkins from the
00:22 - Jenkins website so first of all just
00:26 - open your favorite browser and search
00:28 - for Jenkins and the first link which
00:31 - will appear here will be from Jenkins
00:33 - dot IO so I'm going to click on this
00:36 - link and once this website is open there
00:40 - is a documentation given to install at
00:43 - Jenkins on a Linux or Debian based
00:45 - operating system and this documentation
00:48 - you can find in the documentation
00:50 - section so I'm going to click on the
00:52 - documentation section and then just
00:55 - click on use Jenkins now when I scroll
01:00 - down a little under user handbook
01:03 - section I can see this section which
01:06 - says installing Jenkins so I'm going to
01:09 - click on this link and then you will see
01:13 - this section which is installing Jenkins
01:16 - I'm going to put this link in the
01:19 - description so you can directly click on
01:21 - this link and come to this page now
01:23 - let's see the prerequisite of installing
01:27 - Jenkins so here these are some of the
01:30 - system requirements and then you can see
01:34 - software requirement and here you can
01:36 - see Java eight either Java runtime
01:40 - environment or Java development kit is
01:43 - fine right so first of all we are going
01:46 - to install Java eight and then we are
01:50 - going to install the Jenkins on our open
01:54 - to operating system now when I scroll
01:56 - down a little you will see the
01:59 - installation process for different
02:00 - operating systems for example Mac OS or
02:04 - Windows operating system and when you
02:07 - scroll a little bit more you will see
02:09 - the section for Linux Debian /o
02:13 - - and these are the steps you need to
02:16 - follow in order to install Jenkins so we
02:20 - will execute these steps after we
02:23 - install the Java version so I'm going to
02:26 - just minimize this browser and I'm going
02:28 - to open the terminal just press ctrl alt
02:31 - T in order to open the terminal or you
02:33 - can open the terminal from here also
02:35 - so once the terminal is open to install
02:39 - the java 8 i'm going to use the PPA and
02:43 - this command also i'm going to give you
02:45 - in the description so the first command
02:48 - is this sudo add - apt - repository PPA
02:53 - colon web up8 team four slash java and
02:58 - then press ENTER and then KVR Ubuntu's
03:01 - password and then press enter and once
03:04 - again press enter and once this command
03:06 - is finished I'm going to paste the
03:08 - second command in order to install java
03:10 - 8 so this is the second command which is
03:12 - sudo apt install oracle - java 8 -
03:16 - installer press enter in order to
03:19 - install java 8 so now we can see this
03:22 - message here which says Oracle JDK 8 is
03:25 - installed on my system and then there is
03:29 - an important message here and this
03:31 - message says to set Oracle Java JDK 8 as
03:35 - default we need to install Oracle - Java
03:39 - 8 - set - default so we are going to run
03:43 - this command which is given in the
03:45 - example which is this one so I'm going
03:48 - to just copy this command in order to
03:50 - set Java 8 as the default Java version
03:54 - so just copy this command which is sudo
03:57 - apt install Oracle - Java 8 - set -
04:01 - default and paste on to your terminal
04:03 - and then press ENTER and then press Y
04:07 - and once this command is finished we are
04:10 - going to check the Java version so I'm
04:13 - going to just write Java - - version and
04:17 - then press ENTER and this command gives
04:20 - us some problem I can see could not
04:23 - create Java Virtual Machine so instead
04:25 - of giving
04:26 - double - I think the command is Java -
04:30 - version and you can see this version
04:32 - Java version one point eight point zero
04:34 - point something so if you see this
04:37 - version here that Java eight is
04:39 - installed on your system so let's clear
04:42 - the terminal so I'm going to clear the
04:45 - terminal so now let's start with the
04:47 - installation of Jenkins so when you go
04:51 - to this page and you will see these
04:53 - commands somehow these commands did not
04:56 - work for me so I found on internet some
04:59 - commands which works for me so the first
05:03 - command is this one so I'm not going to
05:05 - follow and copy and paste these commands
05:08 - because these did not work for me I'm
05:11 - going to copy this command and these
05:14 - commands I'm going to give you in the
05:15 - description also so we are going to give
05:19 - the first command and then press ENTER
05:21 - and then give your open to password and
05:24 - then the second command which is this
05:28 - one just copy and paste and then press
05:30 - enter and now the third command which is
05:35 - to update and now the fourth command
05:42 - which is to actually install Jenkins
05:45 - which is sudo apt-get install Jenkins
05:49 - and then press Y and you can see this
05:54 - command is also finished so in order to
05:57 - check whether Jenkins is really
06:00 - installed or not you can open your
06:01 - browser and here Jenkins generally
06:05 - starts on localhost port 8080 so I'm
06:08 - going to just write local host :
06:12 - 8080 and then press ENTER and you will
06:16 - be able to see this kind of page which
06:18 - says unlock Jenkins so here we are going
06:22 - to provide the initial password which is
06:25 - saved at this location so we are going
06:29 - to go to this location but first of all
06:32 - I want to show you some more command in
06:34 - order to just many Jenkins on Ubuntu so
06:38 - because Jenkins
06:40 - installed as a service on your window
06:42 - operating system you can always use a
06:45 - system CTL status for example if you
06:51 - want to check the status Jenkins
06:55 - okay so with this system CTL command you
06:59 - can start Jenkins or stop Jenkins or see
07:02 - the status of Jenkins or restart Jenkins
07:05 - also so when I give this command sudo
07:07 - systemctl status Jenkins and then press
07:10 - enter it's going to give me the status
07:13 - of check-ins and right now it's active
07:15 - and running and for example I want to
07:20 - restart or start my Jenkins once again
07:22 - instead of status I can just right start
07:25 - if I want to restart it I can just right
07:29 - here
07:30 - restart and it's going to be restarted
07:33 - so all these commands are for future
07:36 - references if you want to restart or
07:38 - stop in order to stop you can just right
07:41 - stop here so just write stop and Jenkins
07:44 - will be stopped
07:45 - so these commands are for the future
07:48 - reference whenever you want to just
07:50 - manage your Jenkins or stop or restart
07:52 - Jenkins now let's finish the
07:54 - installation process so you can see on
07:57 - this page it says unlock Jenkins and you
08:00 - will see this path here and on this path
08:03 - the initial admin password is saved so
08:06 - I'm going to just copy this path whole
08:09 - path and then go to the terminal once
08:12 - again and then I'm going to let's let me
08:15 - clear the terminal first of all and here
08:18 - I'm going to just write cat and then
08:21 - just paste this part which I have copied
08:24 - from here which is this one and in this
08:27 - file your initial password is there and
08:30 - cat is used to just output the content
08:33 - of the file so I'm going to just do this
08:36 - I says permission denied so I will do
08:39 - this with the sudo in front of it so I'm
08:42 - going to just write sudo and then press
08:44 - ENTER and you can see this password here
08:47 - so you can just directly copy this path
08:49 - password right click copy or what you
08:53 - can do is you can
08:54 - also use the G added command so instead
08:57 - of cat you can just write G add it this
09:01 - is the graphical editor and here you
09:04 - will find the same password and then you
09:08 - can just copy and then you just need to
09:10 - paste this password here so once you
09:13 - have pasted your initial password I'm
09:15 - going to just click continue and I don't
09:19 - want to save anything and in here I can
09:21 - see two options for customizing Jenkins
09:24 - one is install suggested plugins and
09:27 - other is select plugins to install so
09:30 - I'm going to choose the first option
09:32 - which says install suggested plugins so
09:34 - I'm going to click on this option we're
09:37 - just going to start installing the
09:38 - suggested plugins here so you can see a
09:41 - different kind of plugins will be
09:43 - installed for Kate for example
09:46 - subversion or LDAP or Gradle and other
09:51 - plugins now keep in mind I don't have a
09:54 - gate or a subversion or LDAP yet
09:57 - installed on my window operating system
10:00 - so it's ok if you don't have these
10:03 - installed previously so we will just
10:06 - install the plugins and whenever we want
10:09 - some software for example get or
10:12 - subversion or LDAP or anything we will
10:15 - install it later
10:16 - so I'm going to wait for this plug-in
10:19 - installation to complete so now the
10:21 - installation of all the plugins are
10:22 - complete and this page is redirected to
10:26 - this window where it says create first
10:29 - admin user so we are going to create our
10:32 - first admin user so you can provide any
10:35 - name I'm going to just provide username
10:38 - admin here you can provide any name and
10:40 - then give us some password which you can
10:44 - remember and which is strong so I'm
10:47 - going to give some password here and I'm
10:50 - going to repeat my password and now I'm
10:54 - going to give the name for example admin
10:57 - once again and now I'm going to give the
11:01 - email ID email address and then I'm
11:05 - going to just press this button which
11:07 - say
11:07 - is save and continue' and you can see
11:10 - this message which says instance come
11:12 - figuration jenkins URL which is this one
11:16 - which is a localhost:8080 which is okay
11:19 - for us for now so just leave it as
11:21 - default and then press save and finish
11:23 - and you will be able to see this message
11:27 - which says Jenkins is ready your Jenkins
11:30 - setup is complete start using Jenkins so
11:32 - we are going to just press this button
11:34 - which says start using Jenkins and now
11:40 - if you see this kind of interface you
11:42 - know that Jenkins is working fine on
11:45 - your system so this is how you can
11:48 - install a Jenkins on your open to
11:51 - operating system I hope you've enjoyed
