00:00 - hello guys so in the previous video we
00:02 - have created the
00:04 - game over screen
00:06 - so currently you can disable this
00:08 - game over panel
00:11 - like this
00:12 - now
00:14 - before we create the scoring system
00:18 - we will change some settings in this
00:20 - spawner
00:21 - so
00:23 - for the time to spawn i have assigned
00:26 - 1.8 and for main height minus 4 and for
00:30 - max height minus 2.2 you can play around
00:33 - with these values
00:35 - if you want
00:36 - but
00:37 - these are the values that i am going to
00:40 - use
00:41 - in this game
00:42 - so now to make this scoring system we
00:45 - will first make
00:47 - the ui for our
00:49 - score
00:51 - so right click on the canvas and create
00:54 - new ui element
00:56 - and this time create a text
00:59 - and we will rename it
01:01 - to
01:02 - score
01:06 - now
01:08 - click on this
01:10 - icon here
01:11 - and
01:13 - click here
01:14 - top center
01:16 - to anchor it
01:18 - on to the
01:20 - top center of our canvas
01:23 - now
01:24 - we will change its width and height
01:28 - so
01:30 - select this rect tool
01:33 - now we can change its width
01:36 - so we will make it
01:40 - as the
01:42 - width of the canvas
01:44 - and for the height
01:46 - we will
01:50 - type in 300
01:53 - or let's make it 200
01:56 - now
01:59 - move this
02:00 - score text
02:03 - to
02:04 - the upper side of our canvas
02:07 - and
02:09 - we will write score
02:15 - by default
02:16 - change it to bold and for the font size
02:22 - we will go with
02:27 - let's say 80
02:32 - now
02:33 - click on this alignment and align it
02:39 - horizontally and vertically
02:41 - to the center
02:44 - now
02:45 - click on this best fit
02:48 - now we will
02:50 - change its color to red
02:56 - we will give it an outline
02:58 - so
03:00 - type in outline
03:03 - now we will also give it a shadow
03:08 - and
03:09 - change the effect distance
03:26 - now
03:28 - we have created our ui for displaying
03:30 - this score
03:32 - so now
03:34 - go to the game manager script
03:37 - and we will make a public variable
03:40 - to refer to reference the
03:42 - score text
03:44 - so make a public text
03:48 - so if your
03:50 - if it doesn't suggest you this text then
03:53 - you have to include this
03:56 - namespace here using unityengine.ui
04:00 - so we will name our variable as
04:04 - score text
04:06 - score txt
04:10 - and we will also make another variable
04:12 - which is private
04:16 - float
04:18 - and
04:19 - score
04:21 - so it will keep track of our score
04:24 - so now
04:26 - at the beginning of our game our
04:28 - score
04:30 - would be zero
04:33 - so
04:34 - make it zero
04:36 - now
04:37 - in the update method
04:39 - we will increment our score variable so
04:43 - let's increment
04:45 - it by time dot delta time
04:50 - so time dot delta time
04:56 - now
04:58 - in the update method we will also change
05:01 - the
05:02 - score text
05:03 - so let's write score text
05:07 - dot text
05:09 - so we are accessing the
05:12 - text property of our
05:14 - score text component
05:17 - so
05:18 - let's go to the unity
05:20 - and click on this
05:22 - score text
05:24 - and we can say see that we are accessing
05:28 - this text
05:30 - property
05:31 - of this text
05:32 - component
05:34 - here
05:36 - so
05:37 - now we will make it equal to
05:42 - score
05:45 - plus
05:50 - our score variable
05:56 - so
05:58 - we are adding a string and
06:00 - if load
06:03 - so now let's save this script and
06:06 - go back to the unity
06:09 - and now
06:10 - we have to assign this score text to our
06:13 - game manager so let's drag and drop this
06:17 - score text to
06:19 - the game manager's score text field
06:22 - now hit play button
06:27 - and you will see that our
06:29 - score is
06:31 - increasing
06:32 - but it is displaying the float value
06:36 - so we have to convert this float
06:38 - into an integer
06:40 - so let's get back to the script
06:44 - and we will here
06:46 - type cast this score variable which is
06:49 - float into integer
06:51 - so let's
06:54 - type cast it
06:55 - from score from float to integer
06:59 - now save this script and go back to the
07:01 - unity
07:03 - now
07:05 - if we hit play
07:08 - then
07:09 - we can see that now it only displays
07:12 - the integer values
07:16 - so
07:17 - that's it for this video we have
07:19 - implemented the
07:21 - scoring system for our game
07:24 - so in the next video we will implement
07:27 - pause menu
07:28 - so thank you for watching this video
