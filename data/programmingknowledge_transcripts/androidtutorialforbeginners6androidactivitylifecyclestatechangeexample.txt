00:01 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Android app development for
00:04 - beginners in the last video we have seen
00:07 - the basic overview of Android activity
00:11 - life cycle now in order to understand
00:15 - this activity life cycle in a more
00:19 - deeper sense we will take an example
00:23 - which will show how these U activity
00:27 - methods will be called in some order so
00:32 - in the last video I have shown you in
00:34 - this main activity uh. Java file there
00:38 - is a method called oncreate which uh is
00:42 - called first whenever you launch your
00:46 - application right and I have shown you
00:49 - uh a diagram like this uh which shows
00:53 - the order of the calling of this method
00:57 - one by one whenever your activi is
00:59 - launched
01:00 - two activity is running two activity is
01:03 - shut down so we will try to call all
01:07 - these method one by one and we will see
01:12 - how uh these method are called in order
01:16 - right so what we are going to do is in
01:19 - our main or main activity. Java class we
01:24 - are going to import
01:27 - one more Library so import
01:30 - Port
01:35 - Android
01:37 - dot
01:42 - util
01:45 - dot. log okay so just uh add the this um
01:52 - library and this is just for logging uh
01:55 - messages to your console here okay so we
02:00 - will log some messages while calling uh
02:03 - these uh methods and we will see uh
02:06 - which method uh is you know logged first
02:11 - so that we know that this is called
02:13 - first and then other method and then
02:15 - other meod and then uh we will uh just
02:19 - make a string so
02:24 - public
02:27 - static final then and we will name our
02:31 - string
02:33 - so string and the name of the string for
02:36 - example
02:37 - my
02:39 - my tag because we are going to uh use
02:43 - tags and then we will just name our
02:48 - string something so for example we uh
02:51 - name our tag as my custom message okay
02:56 - and now to log this what you can do is
02:59 - is you can just call log in your on
03:04 - create method so this is my on create
03:06 - method inside my on create method I will
03:09 - write
03:10 - log dot i and then my tag name so my tag
03:17 - name is this
03:19 - one comma the message I want to display
03:23 - so I want to display for example I for
03:26 - the first time when it's called I want
03:28 - to call this on create method okay so
03:32 - this is simple uh you know logging
03:35 - messages whenever this uh method is
03:38 - called now we want uh you know every
03:43 - method here so on create on start on
03:46 - resume so you can do the same for every
03:49 - method on create or and then you can
03:53 - just copy this and paste it and then do
03:56 - it for on start so this I have done or I
04:01 - have uhu uh you know written in my blog
04:07 - all the method which you can call on
04:09 - start on resume on pause on stop all
04:13 - these method which are called here right
04:15 - so that you don't have to you know uh
04:18 - rewrite this code you can just go to my
04:21 - blog and just see this code and you can
04:24 - copy uh all the code up till on Destroy
04:29 - method and this is the whole uh code of
04:33 - this Java file which I'm using right now
04:36 - here okay so you you just need to copy
04:39 - this from on start to on Destroy okay
04:45 - and all the you know uh library is
04:49 - imported here log util and this is just
04:53 - the same example I'm going to show you
04:55 - so I'm going to copy this and paste it
04:57 - here in order to save the time
05:00 - now once you have uh copied and pasted
05:03 - all the method these are the method
05:06 - which are same as on create so on create
05:10 - on start on resume on pause which are
05:15 - listed in this diagram
05:18 - right and now what we are going to do is
05:21 - in order to display these messages what
05:24 - we are going to do is first of all uh uh
05:28 - go to your activity _ main XML file and
05:32 - in here in the console you can customize
05:35 - your messages so just go to this little
05:39 - combo box here and just uh right click
05:43 - or click added filter configurations and
05:47 - you can uh use your own configuration
05:49 - for example I want to make
05:52 - my uh custom message for example or my
05:58 - uh
06:00 - messages okay so I made my own uh uh own
06:05 - uh message configuration and then I can
06:09 - use the tag here so my tag was my custom
06:13 - message right so in here you can see in
06:17 - this the tag name was my custom message
06:22 - or in my activity you can see the tag
06:26 - name was my custom message right so just
06:29 - go to the same configuration my message
06:33 - and just paste this message in the log
06:36 - tag category okay and just click
06:41 - okay now uh what we are going to do is
06:44 - we will run our Android application once
06:47 - again and you can choose your uh tag by
06:52 - filtering here so this is my custom
06:54 - message you can choose your custom
06:56 - message from here I will click okay to
06:58 - run the emulator and just choose this uh
07:02 - tag which you have created here okay so
07:04 - my message was my custom uh tag and when
07:09 - it runs uh suddenly it goes so once
07:12 - again choose this my message and let's
07:15 - see what happens whenever you create
07:18 - your or whenever you run your Android
07:20 - application so you can see first method
07:23 - which is called is on create method
07:26 - which is this one then on start method
07:30 - then on a resume method in here once
07:34 - again and then slowly whenever you go
07:38 - down then it's called on Save instance
07:42 - and then you can see all the methods are
07:46 - called one by one on start on resume on
07:49 - pause right so you can see the sequence
07:52 - of these messages in the same man manner
07:56 - now once you uh you know you know click
08:00 - this button this message will be to
08:04 - destroy the application because it it's
08:06 - closed and now whenever we want to run
08:09 - our application from here it will we
08:12 - will just click our application name and
08:15 - it will be created okay and when we
08:18 - click this button our application is not
08:21 - um destroyed or closed but it's paused
08:25 - okay and you can go to uh the other
08:28 - application but but the last application
08:30 - is not destroyed so it's paused and it's
08:33 - it's stopped last message is paus and
08:36 - stopped but it's not destroyed right so
08:39 - whenever you want to open your
08:41 - application once again you can just uh
08:44 - go to this application double click this
08:47 - and it's it res resumes itself so it's
08:50 - not created once again but it resumes
08:55 - itself once again you see resume okay
08:59 - so in this way you can play with your
09:03 - app close it and rerun it and see what
09:06 - messages uh are printed here and this
09:09 - will give you uh the more clear overview
09:12 - of uh this uh these method how they are
09:16 - called and in what sequence they are
09:19 - called so I hope you enjoyed this video
