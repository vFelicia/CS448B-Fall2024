00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:01 - you how you can solve this problem while
00:04 - installing the code blocks IDE on your
00:07 - uh Mac operating system so you have
00:10 - copied uh this code blocks icon into
00:13 - your applications folder but when you uh
00:16 - just uh click on it to start it it says
00:19 - code blocks needs to be
00:21 - updated and it says the developer of
00:24 - this app needs to update it to work with
00:27 - the version of Mac OS so let's see how
00:30 - we can solve this problem so let me
00:33 - delete this code blocks application
00:35 - first of all because we don't need it we
00:38 - need the different version of code
00:40 - blocks so to solve that you need to go
00:43 - to your browser and search for code
00:45 - blocks once again and then the first
00:47 - link which will appear here will be from
00:49 - code blocks. org so I'm going to click
00:51 - on this link and then click on the
00:54 - downloads link here and then click on
00:57 - download the binary release and then
00:59 - click on Mac OSX uh link here and now
01:04 - you can see two options one is fsub and
01:07 - other is source.net I'm going to click
01:10 - on the sourceforge.net and most probably
01:13 - you have also done the same previously
01:16 - but you don't need to download this
01:20 - version of code blocks so I'm going to
01:23 - cancel the download of this version
01:26 - which starts
01:28 - automatically this is the thir 2bit
01:30 - version for code blocks which is
01:32 - compatible with the previous version of
01:34 - Mac OS but you need to go here once
01:39 - again once the download of that file is
01:42 - complete when you scroll down you will
01:44 - be redirected to uh the sourceforge.net
01:48 - SL projects SL codeblocks URL here you
01:53 - need to scroll down and then click on
01:56 - this files tab here so click on the
01:58 - files tab and then you need to download
02:02 - the 64bit DMG version here okay so you
02:07 - don't need to uh download the zip file
02:11 - but when you go to the files option you
02:13 - need to download the DMG version of code
02:17 - blocks here I'm going to give this URL
02:21 - in the description of this video also so
02:23 - you can directly come to this uh website
02:27 - otherwise when you click on the source
02:29 - for website from the code blocks it's
02:32 - going to download the zip file which we
02:33 - don't require I'm going to download this
02:37 - DMG file for the 64bit option and once I
02:43 - click on that option the download of the
02:45 - DMG file will start and not the zip file
02:49 - you can see I have previously downloaded
02:52 - the zip file because the download of the
02:55 - zip file starts automatically which I
02:58 - don't want right I want the DMG file for
03:01 - OSX 64 once the file is downloaded click
03:05 - on uh the file which is going to start
03:08 - the installer for code blocks let me
03:11 - minimize the browser now the process of
03:14 - installation is really simple just click
03:17 - on the code blocks icon here press
03:19 - command key and then drag and drop this
03:22 - code blocks icon on top of the
03:25 - applications folder until you see the
03:28 - plus symbol and then leave it on the
03:32 - applications folder so now code blocks
03:35 - is transferred to your applications
03:38 - folder and now I can see this icon here
03:41 - once you see the code blocks icon or
03:44 - inside your applications folder you can
03:47 - uh just close this installer window and
03:51 - then I can go to Launchpad and then open
03:54 - the code blocks from here or I can even
03:57 - go to the applications folder in the
03:58 - finder and open the code blocks from
04:01 - there just click on the code blocks IDE
04:04 - it's going to start the code blocks IDE
04:06 - now so for the first time when a code
04:08 - block starts it's going to recognize the
04:11 - compiler in my case it has recognized
04:14 - two compilers one is the gnu GCC
04:17 - compiler and other is llvm cang compiler
04:22 - default is the gnu GCC compiler so I'm
04:25 - going to leave it as default you can
04:27 - also leave it as default if you want to
04:30 - change the default compiler to the cang
04:32 - compiler just select that and then set
04:35 - as default so just click on set as
04:36 - default and then you will use the C
04:39 - length compiler but for now I will use
04:41 - the GCC compiler so I'm going to click
04:45 - on okay here which is going to start the
04:47 - code blocks
04:49 - IDE now once the code blocks IDE starts
04:52 - let's create a very simple C++ program
04:55 - so I'm going to click on the file here
04:57 - and then click on new and then I can
05:00 - click on the project option so new
05:03 - project and here you can choose from so
05:07 - many different projects for now I want
05:11 - to create a console application so I'm
05:14 - going to click on Console application
05:16 - here and then click on go and then it
05:20 - says uh we are going to create the
05:22 - console application I'm going to click
05:24 - on next and it will be a C++ application
05:27 - so I'm going to select C++ and then
05:29 - click on next and then I'm going to
05:32 - provide the project title I'm going to
05:35 - name my project as hello world here and
05:40 - then I can also choose the destination
05:42 - where I want to save this project so I'm
05:44 - going to click on these two dots button
05:48 - and then I want to save this project in
05:51 - my documents folder so I'm going to
05:53 - choose the documents folder and then
05:55 - click on open which is going to save my
05:58 - project in my my documents folder now
06:01 - I'm going to click on
06:02 - next and then here you can see I can
06:05 - choose the compiler which is GCC by
06:08 - default here I also have the option to
06:11 - choose the other compilers if I have
06:13 - those compilers right also it says
06:16 - create a debug configuration I will
06:18 - leave it as default also it says create
06:21 - a release configuration I will also
06:23 - leave it as default and then click on
06:26 - finish here once I click on finish my
06:29 - project project is created so this is a
06:31 - C++ project and here I can see under
06:34 - sources I have one main. cpb file so let
06:38 - me click on that which is going to code
06:40 - blocks application quits unexpectedly
06:44 - and I can see this message which says
06:46 - code blocks quit unexpectedly click
06:49 - report to see the details so let's see
06:51 - how we can solve this problem so for now
06:53 - I'm going to click on ignore once again
06:56 - I'm going to open the code blocks here
06:59 - and and once code blocks opens before
07:02 - opening my project what I need to do is
07:05 - I need to click on plugins here and then
07:08 - click on manage plugins and there is a
07:11 - plugin called code completion plugin
07:14 - which causes this error so I'm going to
07:16 - select code completion plugin and then
07:18 - click on disable in front of it so I
07:21 - have disabled this code completion
07:24 - plugin and once this code completion
07:26 - plugins is disabled I'm going to try to
07:29 - open the project once again so let me
07:32 - just click on file click on open and
07:35 - then click on my project and then click
07:37 - on open once again and this time you
07:40 - will observe that the code blocks
07:43 - doesn't quit unexpectedly and my project
07:46 - is opened so let me just uh click on the
07:49 - main.cpp file here and this is the code
07:54 - which is generated automatically by the
07:57 - code blocks for us so to compile this
08:00 - code I just need to click on this build
08:03 - button so let me click on build button
08:05 - which is going to compile my project and
08:08 - there is no error in it zero error zero
08:11 - warning to run it I'm going to click on
08:13 - this uh Green Run button so when I click
08:16 - on run button says code blocks wants
08:19 - access to control terminal yes because
08:22 - we are creating the terminal application
08:25 - code blocks will run this uh C++ program
08:29 - in the terminal so I'm going to click on
08:31 - okay here and it runs the application in
08:35 - the terminal and it will show this kind
08:38 - of uh problem here so when you see uh
08:42 - this kind of problem on your zsh which
08:45 - says no such file or directory on code
08:48 - blogs what you need to do is um let me
08:51 - just close this terminal go to your code
08:54 - blocks and then here click on settings
08:58 - and then click on
09:00 - environment and under terminal to launch
09:03 - the console program instead of this line
09:06 - so instead of uh this script terminal to
09:09 - launch the console program I need to
09:11 - change this script a little so I need to
09:13 - change it to uh this uh script so first
09:18 - part is okay Osa script hyphen e tell
09:21 - app terminal hyphen e activate hypen do
09:24 - script until do script everything is

10:16 - work you can see it prints hello world
10:19 - now and everything is working this is
10:22 - how you can download and install code
10:25 - blocks on your Mac operating system I
