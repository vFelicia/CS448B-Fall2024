00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can install Jenkins on your
00:06 - windows 11 operating system
00:08 - so the prerequisite of installing
00:10 - Jenkins is that you need to have Java
00:14 - jdk installed on your Windows operating
00:17 - system so if you haven't yet installed
00:21 - Java just install it the procedure is
00:24 - really simple if you don't know how to
00:27 - install Java then I have already created
00:30 - few videos about that so you can watch
00:32 - those videos
00:34 - and once you have Java on your Windows
00:37 - operating system we are ready to install
00:39 - Jenkins
00:41 - so let's start with the download of
00:45 - Jenkins binary so first of all open your
00:48 - favorite browser and search for Jenkins
00:50 - and the first link which will appear
00:52 - here will be from jenkins.io so we are
00:55 - going to click on this link and once we
00:57 - are on jenkins.io website
01:00 - straight away you will be able to see
01:02 - the download button here you can also
01:04 - see the download link here at the top
01:07 - also
01:08 - so wherever you see the download link or
01:10 - button just click on that so now we are
01:12 - on the downloads page
01:15 - now here you have this table LTS version
01:18 - and the regular releases
01:22 - so we can just scroll down here where
01:26 - you can see different options for
01:28 - installing Jenkins on various operating
01:31 - systems
01:32 - so you can see we can install Jenkins
01:35 - with docker kubernetes
01:38 - Ubuntu Debian and all the other options
01:44 - so what we want is we want to install
01:47 - the Jenkins on windows so we will use
01:50 - this
01:52 - Windows version and make sure you are
01:55 - under the LTS version LTS stands for
01:58 - long term support version right
02:00 - so I'm going to click on Windows here
02:03 - and once you click on the Windows option
02:06 - this
02:08 - jenkins.msi file will start downloading
02:12 - now if this MSI file is not downloaded
02:16 - you can click on this alternate link
02:19 - which will start the download of this
02:21 - MSI file so once the MSI file for
02:24 - Jenkins is downloaded let's click on
02:27 - this file
02:28 - and if you uh want you can read uh some
02:32 - documentation on the download page
02:35 - itself and you can see by default
02:38 - Jenkins run at this IP address which is
02:42 - localhost colon 8080
02:45 - and then if you want to change some
02:48 - configuration it can be changed using
02:51 - jenkins.xml file right let me minimize
02:55 - this browser so you can see the
02:58 - installer is preparing and now you can
03:00 - see the Jenkins Setup Wizard
03:03 - so let's click on the next button on the
03:07 - first window
03:08 - this will be the default location where
03:10 - Jenkins will be installed on your
03:13 - Windows operating system so if you don't
03:15 - have the good reason to change this
03:16 - location just leave it as default and
03:19 - then click on next so here on the next
03:21 - page we will see service login
03:23 - credentials generally what I do is I
03:26 - select this option which is run Service
03:29 - as local system and then later on I can
03:35 - add the username and password when
03:38 - Jenkins is installed right
03:41 - so I'm going to choose the first option
03:43 - here and then click on next
03:45 - this is the default port on which
03:47 - Jenkins will start so uh it's port 8080
03:52 - right now if this port is not available
03:55 - then Jenkins will complain so it's
03:58 - better to test this port so just click
04:00 - on test port
04:02 - and this port is available on my Windows
04:05 - operating system so that's okay if it
04:07 - gives any error you can change this port
04:10 - also right
04:12 - so once you have provided the port click
04:16 - on next
04:17 - and then you need to provide the path of
04:21 - your Java development kit as I said I
04:25 - already have installed Java on my
04:27 - windows 11 operating system so Jenkins
04:30 - installation has recognized the path of
04:33 - java automatically
04:35 - if it doesn't recognize this path you
04:37 - can just browse this path and change
04:41 - this path also right
04:44 - once
04:45 - that's done click on next
04:48 - and at this point leave everything as
04:50 - default and then click on next and then
04:52 - click on install and then at this point
04:55 - you can see this kind of warning do you
04:58 - want to allow this app to make changes
04:59 - on your device click on yes
05:01 - and the installation of Jenkins will
05:04 - start
05:05 - so now uh in few seconds the giant
05:08 - Gaines setup has been completed and at
05:11 - the end you will see this kind of
05:13 - message which has completed the Jenkins
05:15 - Setup Wizard and now I can click on the
05:18 - Finish button to finish the setup now as
05:21 - you have seen on this webpage you can
05:24 - open this URL which is https localhost
05:28 - port 8080 to uh open Jenkins so just uh
05:34 - click on this link here which is going
05:36 - to open this localhost port 8080
05:41 - and if Jenkins installation is done
05:45 - successfully you will see this kind of
05:47 - web page here
05:49 - now here to unlock Jenkins you need to
05:52 - provide the initial password and this
05:54 - password is present at this path which
05:58 - is shown here so you just need to go to
06:01 - this directory and then open this file
06:05 - here and your initial admin password
06:07 - will be there right so I'm going to just
06:10 - copy this path go to my folder Explorer
06:14 - and then open this path here
06:17 - and here I can see initial admin
06:19 - password file I can right click here and
06:22 - then open it with uh some editor
06:27 - so I have multiple editors here you can
06:31 - choose any editor of your choice I'm
06:33 - going to choose notepad here and then
06:36 - click on OK
06:38 - and then this is the password so this is
06:41 - the initial password so I'm going to
06:42 - copy this password and then paste it
06:45 - here and then click on continue
06:49 - and then you can see customize Jenkins
06:53 - install suggested plugins
06:56 - which is recommended so I'm going to
06:58 - click on this option which says install
07:00 - suggested plugins
07:03 - we're just going to install all these
07:05 - suggested plugins
07:06 - like git ldap pipeline
07:11 - workspace cleanup GitHub Branch so so
07:14 - all these plugins will be installed so
07:16 - just wait for uh all those plugins to be
07:20 - installed and once all those plugins are
07:23 - installed uh you will see this kind of
07:26 - window where you can create a new admin
07:30 - username and password right
07:32 - so here you can create a new username
07:35 - and password let me create that username
07:38 - and password so the username I want to
07:41 - give here is code bind for example and
07:44 - the password I'm going to provide a very
