00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - JavaScript tutorial for beginners in
00:04 - this video we will see how we can
00:06 - install notepad plus plus which is a
00:09 - code editor for JavaScript or Eclipse
00:13 - IDE for developing your JavaScript
00:16 - project so first of all let's see how we
00:19 - can install a notepad plus plus so just
00:22 - open your browser and search for notepad
00:25 - plus plus and the first option most
00:27 - probably will come here will be from
00:29 - notepad minus plus minus plus 0 RG you
00:33 - can directly click download option from
00:36 - here and in here they have the download
00:39 - option for Windows as an installer so
00:43 - you just need to click this notepad plus
00:45 - plus installer and you just need to run
00:48 - the installer ok and once the notepad
00:52 - plus plus is installed you just need to
00:54 - search for notepad plus plus and it's
00:56 - going to look like this ok now to make a
01:00 - HTML 5 here you just need to create a
01:03 - new file and then right click on it and
01:06 - then save it as our HTML file ok so just
01:10 - choose hypertext markup language from
01:14 - here and give the name to your file for
01:18 - example test dot HTML okay and save it
01:22 - and here you can write your code for
01:25 - example my code looks like this which we
01:28 - have seen in the last video and to run
01:31 - this first you need to save it and then
01:33 - go to this option called run and here
01:36 - you will be able to see some options
01:39 - depending upon the browser installed on
01:42 - your system so it says launch in Firefox
01:44 - Internet Explorer Chrome or Safari so we
01:48 - want to do it in Firefox we'll launch it
01:50 - in Firefox so choose this option and
01:52 - it's going to open this in Firefox ok so
01:57 - this is how you can install notepad plus
02:00 - plus now let's see how we can install
02:02 - Eclipse IDE on our Windows operating
02:04 - system so to install Eclipse IDE you
02:07 - need to have a Java JDK install in your
02:10 - system because it's a prerequisite for
02:12 - installing
02:13 - Eclipse IDE now you just need to search
02:16 - for Java JDK here and just click the
02:20 - link which says oracle.com
02:23 - ok so go inside here and here you need
02:27 - to choose this option which says Java
02:29 - download and once you click here you
02:32 - need to click this radio button which
02:35 - says accept license and condition and
02:37 - you need to install or download the
02:40 - installer which says x64 dot exe which
02:44 - is the last option we can see right now
02:46 - if you have 32-bit operating system you
02:49 - need to choose x86 which is the second
02:52 - last option from the top or if you have
02:55 - some other operating system like Mac OS
02:57 - or Linux then you can choose those here
03:01 - as well once this executable file is
03:05 - downloaded you just need to double click
03:07 - on it and run it and it will probably
03:09 - take few seconds of few minutes to
03:13 - install it and after installing you will
03:15 - be able to see in your C folder of your
03:19 - windows operating system there will be a
03:21 - folder called Program Files and in the
03:25 - Program Files you will be able to see
03:27 - this Java folder and here you will find
03:29 - two folders one is JDK and other is JRE
03:35 - you can even change the name of these
03:38 - folder because when they were installed
03:42 - on my system there was something like
03:44 - JDK 8 point 1 point 4 whatever so I
03:47 - change the name to this JDK 8 and jay-ar
03:50 - in and once you change the folder name
03:54 - you can go to your search option of for
03:57 - Windows and then search for system here
04:01 - ok and for after installing Java JDK you
04:05 - need to set the environment variable for
04:08 - Java so that Eclipse IDE can recognize
04:12 - this Java ok so go to system then go to
04:15 - advanced setting and in that one setting
04:18 - go to environment variable and in the
04:21 - environment variable you just need to go
04:22 - to this
04:24 - system variable called path and
04:27 - double-click on it and in here what you
04:30 - need to do is you just need to copy the
04:32 - path where your JDK folder is so just go
04:36 - inside this JDK 8 folder and then go
04:39 - inside this bin folder ok and then copy
04:43 - this path from here and go at the last
04:45 - and give the semicolon and paste this
04:49 - path up to bin ok so I have already done
04:54 - this so I will not do it again but you
04:56 - need to do it here and same you need to
05:00 - do it with JRE folder so go into the JRE
05:02 - folder and then go to bin folder and
05:05 - copy the path and go at the last give
05:08 - the semicolon 1 semicolon here and then
05:11 - paste the path here ok once you do that
05:14 - click OK and ok and ok ok and now your
05:19 - environment variables are set now after
05:22 - installing Java and setting the
05:24 - environment variable you need to go to
05:26 - the eclipse website which is Eclipse dot
05:30 - download or let's see how is this home
05:35 - page looks like for the Eclipse IDE so
05:38 - you will be able to see this home page
05:40 - like this and then you can just click
05:43 - this download button which will lead you
05:45 - to this page now you can see here they
05:51 - have introduced the Eclipse installer
05:53 - recently so you can choose this
05:55 - installer and you don't need to worry
05:58 - about anything so just click for this
06:02 - installer for example 64-bit installer
06:04 - and download it and install it and it
06:08 - will ask you which version of Eclipse
06:11 - you want to install so there are
06:14 - different type of Eclipse available on
06:17 - this website for example Eclipse IDE for
06:20 - Java EE Eclipse IDE for Java developer
06:23 - Eclipse IDE for C++ Eclipse IDE for PHP
06:27 - the one we want is Eclipse IDE for EE
06:31 - developers and when you see the
06:34 - description you will see here that it
06:36 - can be used for depth
06:38 - element and you can use it for HTML or
06:41 - JavaScript projects right so I will
06:45 - prefer to choose this option and
06:47 - depending upon the operating system I
06:50 - will choose 64 bit because my operating
06:52 - system is 64 bit and once you click this
06:56 - you will be able to see you know
06:58 - different option to download ok so you
07:01 - can see the one which is closer to my
07:04 - location is this one so I can just click
07:08 - this option download and it will be
07:11 - downloaded to my computer if you want to
07:14 - get it faster you can see here there are
07:17 - different links so for example I can
07:20 - choose this IBM source from yours and
07:22 - click this download button and from here
07:26 - you can just click this 64-bit version
07:30 - and it will download our Eclipse zip
07:34 - file ok so once you download this
07:37 - Eclipse zip file it's going to look like
07:39 - this so you just need to extract this
07:43 - zip file so extract file and I would
07:46 - like to extract this file in my C folder
07:50 - so extract it in your C folder and once
07:53 - you extract this Eclipse folder in your
07:56 - C folder go to this Eclipse folder here
08:00 - and it's going to look like this the
08:03 - contents are like this ok so this is our
08:08 - executable which opens Eclipse IDE you
08:12 - can just right click on it and you can
08:15 - send it to your desktop as a shortcut
08:17 - also so send to desktop and it will
08:21 - create a shortcut and if you want to
08:25 - open this Eclipse IDE you just need to
08:28 - click this Eclipse dot exe file here so
08:31 - just double click on it and it's going
08:33 - to open Eclipse IDE so for the first
08:35 - time when you open a Clips ID it's going
08:37 - to show you this option to create your
08:40 - workspace workspace is nothing but the
08:43 - location where all your project will be
08:46 - saved
08:47 - ok so leave it as default and click OK
08:53 - and it's going to open your Eclipse IDE
08:57 - now for the first time when you open
09:00 - Eclipse IDE it's going to give you this
09:02 - kind of a welcome message which you can
09:05 - cancel from here and to create a new
09:07 - project what you need to do is you need
09:09 - to go to file and go to new and choose
09:12 - project from here and in here you have
09:15 - two options to create a Java Script
09:17 - project one is go to the Java Script and
09:20 - select JavaScript project or other one
09:23 - is go to web folder and select static
09:26 - web project for now so for now I'm going
09:29 - to choose this static web project and
09:31 - click Next
09:31 - and now I am going to give the name to
09:34 - my project for example test project for
09:38 - example ok and now you can just click
09:40 - finish I'm just going to create you this
09:44 - project now you can open multiple
09:47 - project inside this Eclipse IDE you can
09:50 - see one I was already using so I can
09:54 - right click on this project which I was
09:56 - using and I can close this by selecting
10:00 - this option close project ok it's going
10:03 - to close my project ok or if you want to
10:06 - delete this project from this project
10:08 - was Explorer you can right click and
10:11 - click delete and if you click OK it's
10:15 - going to delete it from this project to
10:17 - Explorer but it's not going to delete it
10:19 - from your hard disk ok so in order to
10:22 - delete it forever
10:25 - you just need to check this option and
10:27 - it's going to delete it forever ok
10:30 - now this is my project here and it
10:33 - contains one folder called web content
10:35 - which is empty so I will right-click on
10:38 - it and I will create a new HTML file
10:41 - here and I will name it as for example
10:44 - test dot HTML and click finish and it's
10:48 - going to create me the HTML file okay
10:51 - now this Eclipse IDE gives you the ill
10:56 - will web browser to test your code ok so
11:00 - you can just go to the location where
11:02 - this text dot HTML is inside
11:04 - the web content folder right-click on it
11:06 - and then go to open width and then click
11:11 - web browser and Eclipse has its own web
11:15 - browser which you can use to run your
11:17 - code so for example I can add some
11:21 - JavaScript code here for example script
11:24 - and as we have done last time we are
11:28 - going to just add document here dot
11:32 - write and we can just add hello world
11:35 - and save your code and refresh this web
11:39 - page and it's going to give you this
11:40 - hello world output here okay
11:43 - so in this way you can install notepad
11:46 - plus plus or Eclipse IDE to create your
11:49 - new Java Script project now you can
11:53 - choose either of them I will be using
11:55 - this Eclipse IDE but if you wish you can
11:58 - also choose this notepad plus plus
12:00 - editor so that's it for this video I
