00:03 - hey everyone so to display text on the
00:07 - tank top window we just have learned
00:08 - about the create text function in canvas
00:10 - but we also have label and message to
00:13 - print a message on the screen to get
00:16 - text on screen so we haven't discussed
00:18 - that yet that's what we are going to
00:20 - talk about today we will learn about the
00:23 - label and message widgets
00:25 - there is just a little difference
00:27 - between label and message let's write
00:29 - some code to check that out
00:31 - so from thinker
00:35 - import Star
00:38 - and I'll have my window right when TK
00:43 - packets
00:45 - I'll given a title I'll write win dot
00:47 - title
00:49 - display text
00:54 - let the title be display text
00:57 - now I'm gonna add my widget
01:00 - that is message and I will given a
01:03 - variable I'll write
01:05 - my message
01:11 - equals message
01:15 - and where do I want that I want it on
01:17 - the main screen
01:18 - so I'll write when
01:21 - comma what is the text that we want to
01:24 - display so the text equals
01:30 - hello everyone
01:34 - kindly pay attention
01:41 - we are learning
01:44 - tinker
01:45 - cool
01:47 - and then we'll give in a background
01:49 - color
01:51 - I'll write PG equals
01:53 - I think
01:56 - okay then I'll give an aspect so aspect
02:00 - is the ratio
02:02 - basically it's aspect ratio it's the
02:05 - ratio of width and height in percent the
02:08 - default is 150 which means the
02:12 - width would be 50 percent greater than
02:15 - the height of the message box
02:16 - so you can think of on your own what
02:19 - aspect you would give in I will give in
02:22 - an aspect of
02:25 - 500
02:27 - and then
02:29 - I will give an border with it will be 5
02:33 - PD equals five
02:36 - I've also given a type of water relief
02:39 - equals rich
02:42 - I've given a padding
02:44 - fad x equals 10 just along the x-axis
02:49 - okay also the foreground let it be dark
02:52 - blue
02:55 - I can also given a font Let It Be ink
02:59 - free
03:01 - 14 and atomic
03:03 - so that's the way you can given a font
03:06 - that's how you describe a font in Tinker
03:10 - then you can just look up what all
03:13 - arguments you can given for message
03:16 - so we have already described master
03:20 - we have not talked about anchors so
03:23 - anchor is used to decide where the text
03:25 - should be placed in the message widget
03:27 - it can be North North East
03:31 - the top right corner
03:33 - east south east south Southwest or
03:37 - Center the default is Center
03:39 - do not get confused between justify and
03:42 - anchor anchor is for possession whereas
03:45 - justify is like alignment okay
03:49 - then we have aspect we just discussed it
03:52 - we have decided the background
03:55 - and water and the font for round color
03:59 - too
04:00 - we know about justify
04:03 - we can given a padding pad by and Pat X
04:07 - we know about relief we know about text
04:11 - and you can also given the width but I
04:14 - have not given it that's fine I have
04:17 - already given in the aspect
04:19 - then I'll get to the label
04:22 - I'll write label
04:24 - equals label
04:29 - so for the master it would be win again
04:33 - and then text
04:35 - Let It Be
04:36 - label which it does not allow multiple
04:39 - lines
04:52 - okay so this is a fact label widget
04:55 - would not let you get a long text in
04:58 - several lines
05:01 - there is no line wrap-up option so it
05:05 - will just cut off the text that does not
05:08 - fit into the specified height and width
05:10 - so if you have mentioned a smaller size
05:13 - the text will just disappear and not all
05:17 - the text would appear on the screen
05:19 - cool
05:20 - so
05:22 - this is one difference between message
05:24 - and label widget there are many
05:27 - but this is a major one then I will
05:30 - given the Border
05:32 - size let it be eight
05:35 - let the background be
05:37 - sky blue
05:40 - and I'll have a cursor for this
05:44 - that the cursor
05:46 - the cross
05:48 - foreground Let It Be
05:51 - yellow and I'll also given a font here
05:54 - right Georgia
05:59 - 18 italic
06:03 - relief
06:07 - raised
06:10 - height let it be two
06:13 - and I'll not given the width let the
06:16 - label widget decided on its own
06:18 - according to the text
06:20 - now I'll pack this
06:22 - but first I'll pack the label then I'll
06:26 - pack the message okay
06:28 - now let's see if the packing order
06:31 - affects the order of display or is it
06:34 - the order of defining the widgets that
06:36 - decide in which order the widgets would
06:38 - be displayed
06:40 - so I'll write down
06:43 - label dot pack
06:46 - I'll simply use spark and then
06:50 - I'll also pack the message widget
06:55 - dot back
06:57 - now I will call the main Loop
06:59 - wind dot main Loop
07:02 - fine
07:03 - let's check out how the label and
07:05 - message widgets work
