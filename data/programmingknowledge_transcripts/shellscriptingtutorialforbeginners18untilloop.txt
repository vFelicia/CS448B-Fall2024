00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - shell scripting tutorial for beginners
00:04 - in this video we will learn how to use
00:06 - until loops in shell scripting now until
00:09 - loops are almost similar to while you
00:12 - but with a slight difference and the
00:14 - difference we are going to see in a
00:16 - moment but let's see first the syntax of
00:20 - until loop so the syntax of until loop
00:23 - is like this so you use the keyword
00:26 - until and then in square brackets or in
00:30 - double parenthesis also you give a
00:33 - condition and if the condition is false
00:36 - then the commands between the keyword do
00:40 - and done are executed right so the
00:43 - difference is in the while loop if the
00:45 - condition is true then only the commands
00:48 - are executed in the until loop the
00:51 - condition is false then only the
00:54 - commands are executed right so let's
00:58 - take an example so once again for
01:02 - example I want to print the value one to
01:05 - ten on the terminal so I will declare a
01:07 - variable and assign a value of 1 to it
01:09 - and in the condition this time I want to
01:13 - write here dollar n and then I will just
01:17 - give it a flag GE which is greater than
01:22 - or equal to right and then 10 so we want
01:26 - to evaluate the condition if the value
01:28 - of n is greater than or equal to 10 and
01:31 - if it's not greater than or equal to 10
01:35 - then it's going to echo the value of n
01:39 - for example right so we will just write
01:42 - like this and to increment the value of
01:46 - n we can just write this notation so
01:48 - just write and is equal to double
01:51 - parenthesis and then n plus 1 here okay
01:56 - so let's run the script and let's see
01:59 - what happens so I am going to run the
02:01 - script and it prints the value 1 to 9
02:04 - and why it's happening here because this
02:09 - condition is false
02:11 - whenever we start
02:13 - our script n is equal to one here right
02:17 - so when this point is reached the N is
02:22 - equal to 1 which is not greater 210 or
02:26 - not greater than or equal to 10 so it
02:29 - goes here right so it's checks for the
02:32 - false condition right and then if the
02:36 - condition is false which is false in
02:40 - this case because n is not greater than
02:43 - or equal to 10 then it prints this value
02:46 - with the echo command and then increment
02:49 - the value of n by this right and it goes
02:53 - on and on and on until the value of n
02:55 - becomes 11 which is greater than or
02:58 - equal to 10 which is true
03:01 - so if the condition is true this is not
03:03 - executed right now if I want to print 1
03:07 - to 10 I need to just write greater than
03:11 - here not greater than or equal to what's
03:13 - greater than right once again when I run
03:16 - the script it prints 1 to 10 right
03:19 - similar to a while loops you can just
03:22 - use these double parentheses here to
03:26 - evaluate the condition and we will just
03:29 - do something like this but instead of
03:32 - greater than you just need to write
03:35 - something like this so until the n is
03:38 - not greater than 10 then we will execute
03:41 - the command so once again the values are
03:46 - printed 1 to 10 right and as we have
03:49 - seen we can increment the value of n in
03:52 - few ways so the post increment is
03:56 - possible let me clear the terminal and
03:59 - once again run the script and the result
04:02 - will be same and pre increment is also
04:05 - possible so like this and once again run
04:08 - the script and give us the similar
04:11 - result okay so in this way you can use
04:15 - until loop in shell scripting I hope you
