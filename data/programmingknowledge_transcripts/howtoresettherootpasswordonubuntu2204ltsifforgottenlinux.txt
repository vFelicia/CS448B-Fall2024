00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can reset your root password
00:04 - on your Ubuntu operating system so let's
00:07 - say you forgot your password and you can
00:11 - no longer log into your Ubuntu operating
00:13 - system
00:15 - there is a way using which you can reset
00:17 - your Ubuntu a password and then log into
00:22 - your Ubuntu operating system
00:24 - for demonstration purposes I'm showing
00:28 - this on a virtual machine but on an
00:32 - actual machine it will work fine okay
00:36 - so
00:37 - let's say you are on this login page and
00:40 - you can't log in anymore
00:43 - so what you need to do is you need to go
00:46 - or boot your Ubuntu operating system in
00:49 - grub mode
00:51 - how you can do that
00:52 - you can restart your Ubuntu operating
00:56 - system by clicking on the these icons at
00:59 - the top and then click on power of log
01:01 - out and then click on restart
01:05 - so before clicking on restart you need
01:09 - to do one thing
01:11 - so when you click on restart and when
01:14 - your Ubuntu operating system boots again
01:18 - you need to press shift and Escape key
01:23 - so let me just click on restart button
01:27 - here
01:27 - and right now I don't need to do
01:30 - anything when it starts booting at that
01:33 - time I need to press
01:34 - shift and Escape key okay so let's wait
01:39 - and then at this time I will press shift
01:43 - end Escape key and you are in the grub
01:47 - menu okay
01:49 - so you can see uh you have these options
01:53 - Ubuntu Advanced option for Ubuntu memory
01:57 - test and the other option you need to go
02:01 - to the advanced option for Ubuntu
02:04 - so use your down arrow key to move up or
02:09 - down and select Advanced option for
02:11 - Ubuntu and then press enter
02:14 - and here
02:15 - you will see a few options
02:18 - you need to go to the option which says
02:21 - recovery mode at the end so just uh go
02:26 - to the option which says recovery mode
02:28 - at the end now if you see a multiple
02:31 - recovery mode options just choose the
02:34 - top one okay so as in my case I have
02:38 - these two right so I will choose the top
02:41 - one which ends with recovery mode and
02:44 - then press enter
02:46 - and then wait for few seconds now after
02:49 - few seconds automatically you will see
02:52 - this kind of recovery menu
02:55 - now here once again you need to use your
02:58 - up and down arrow keys on your keyboard
03:01 - to move down and then select the option
03:04 - which says root okay so select the
03:08 - option which says root and then press
03:10 - enter
03:11 - once you press enter at the bottom you
03:15 - will see this press enter for
03:18 - maintenance mode okay so just press
03:21 - enter once again and then you will see
03:23 - this command line okay
03:26 - so once you see this command line you
03:29 - need to give few commands so let me uh
03:32 - show you these commands
03:34 - I will give all these commands in the
03:36 - description of this video okay
03:38 - so here at the bottom you need to type
03:41 - this First Command which is Mount space
03:45 - hyphen n space hyphen o remount comma RW
03:49 - forward slash okay so let me type this
03:52 - command
03:54 - space hyphen n space hyphen o
03:58 - space
04:00 - remount
04:01 - comma RW forward slash right so space
04:06 - forward slash and then press enter
04:09 - once this command is successful you need
04:11 - to give the second command
04:13 - the second command is essentially for
04:16 - changing your root password
04:19 - so just give
04:21 - pass WD and then your username now you
04:25 - your username is already printed here so
04:29 - as you can see here root at the rate and
04:32 - then I can see my username my username
04:34 - right now is code bind right this is the
04:38 - username I need to give here okay so
04:41 - whatever you see after root at the rate
04:43 - that is your username so I will give
04:47 - code bind here
04:50 - and then press enter
04:52 - as soon as I press enter it will ask me
04:55 - to give my new password
04:57 - so here I can provide my new passwords
05:00 - so let me provide that new password and
05:03 - then I need to retype that password so
05:05 - let me
05:06 - retype that password and then I will
05:10 - press enter
05:12 - and you will see that when I press enter
05:15 - for the second time
05:17 - my password is updated successfully
05:20 - right so the password is updated
05:23 - successfully now I just need to reboot
05:26 - my Ubuntu operating system for this you
05:29 - just need to write
05:31 - reboot here and then press enter and
05:34 - it's going to reboot your Ubuntu
05:37 - operating system
05:39 - so let me just minimize this and wait
05:42 - for the reboot so once my system reboots
05:46 - I just need to click on my username and
05:49 - then I need to login with my new
05:52 - password so I'm going to give my new
05:54 - password here and then press enter
05:56 - and I will be successfully logged into
06:00 - my Ubuntu operating system so so you can
06:03 - see I'm successfully logged into my

06:07 - so this is how you can reset your root
06:11 - password on your Ubuntu operating system
