00:00 - today we are going to learn about how to
00:02 - install rails on
00:03 - our local machine so this is like a
00:06 - rail to install a rails on your machine
00:09 - it has like a
00:09 - few dependencies so basically we are
00:12 - going to cover each dependency how we
00:14 - can
00:15 - install the dependency so that our rails
00:18 - application works perfectly why uh
00:20 - perfectly fine on our machine so what we
00:23 - can do
00:24 - so we can like first what we can do we
00:27 - can
00:28 - like just like open few links and
00:31 - so basically we will start with one link
00:33 - at a time
00:35 - so let's open this link
00:38 - now this is the node.js official website
00:40 - you can move to this
00:41 - website and download this installer and
00:44 - this is the lts
00:46 - version you can download the long term
00:47 - support version so
00:49 - lts version and you can install node.js
00:51 - on your machine
00:52 - so when you have installed node.js on
00:55 - your machine
00:56 - then you can this would help you to
00:59 - install like the npm package okay
01:02 - so when you have installed like
01:06 - node.js so you can run this command on
01:08 - your machine
01:09 - node minus minus version and this will
01:11 - help you get started with that
01:13 - so i'll give you a quick hint uh
01:16 - when like i've opened the command prompt
01:19 - and i will type node minus minus version
01:24 - so here you can see the node has been
01:26 - stored on my machine so it looks
01:27 - perfectly fine okay
01:30 - so yeah so then you can like
01:34 - then you have installed an audio on your
01:35 - machine then what you can do
01:37 - you can move to the another link this is
01:40 - like
01:41 - how to install yarn the yarn is another
01:44 - dependency required to install rails
01:47 - on your machine so so when you have
01:51 - installed node.js so you would have
01:53 - access to npm package
01:55 - so you can run this command npm install
01:57 - minus minus global yarn
01:58 - or the alternate way alternative way it
02:01 - is to click on this
02:02 - and click on operating system windows
02:04 - classic stable version and you can
02:06 - download the installer
02:07 - so when you have downloaded the
02:08 - installer so you can install
02:11 - yarn as per like as you will get a setup
02:15 - so you will have an msi installer and
02:17 - you will like uh
02:18 - you this will give you a msi file that
02:20 - will run
02:21 - walk you through installing your own
02:22 - window so basically it will give you a
02:24 - setup
02:24 - which will help you installing yarn on
02:26 - your machine
02:28 - so this is one of the methods but okay
02:30 - to install
02:31 - uh yarn on your machine so so basically
02:34 - now you have covered the two
02:36 - for two parts so basically you have
02:38 - installed node.js and yarn
02:40 - and you can install with by npm also so
02:43 - you can solve at npm and you can run
02:45 - this command
02:46 - and to check if this is installed after
02:50 - then you have to type yarn minus minus
02:52 - version
02:54 - okay so here you can see you have got
02:57 - like
02:57 - two things the one is node and another
03:00 - is yarn
03:01 - so next moving to the third part
03:04 - uh like you can move to sqlite
03:08 - uh website so this is the third
03:10 - dependency
03:13 - and when you click on this link
03:16 - so you can access to this so this is
03:20 - now you move to this pre-compiled
03:23 - binaries for windows
03:24 - uh now you have to choose either of
03:28 - one um one of them either 32-bit or
03:31 - 64-bit
03:33 - okay choose according to your system
03:35 - 32-bit or 64-bit
03:37 - so uh like this is required so this
03:40 - is required either 32-bit of 64-bit
03:43 - install
03:44 - any one of them so uh
03:47 - like depending on your system then this
03:50 - one is mandatory like
03:51 - uh you have been solved so what you'll
03:54 - get you get two files in this
03:56 - and two files in this and three files in
03:59 - this so
04:00 - since this one is like compulsory so
04:03 - this will be three files and either one
04:04 - of them will be three plus two that is
04:06 - five files
04:07 - you have to extract all the file files
04:09 - and copy them and paste them into your c
04:12 - windows system 32 okay so
04:15 - then when you install copy and paste
04:17 - them inside in the c windows system32
04:19 - then you
04:19 - your sqlite is perfectly installed and
04:22 - you can type
04:26 - sqlite3 minus minus
04:28 - version okay so this would help install
04:32 - sql light on your machine
04:34 - so here it's good to go yeah nice
04:37 - now what you need to do the now moving
04:40 - to the fourth part
04:42 - you need to do you need to move to ruby
04:44 - installer website so basically ruby's
04:46 - installer is intended to install ruby on
04:48 - your windows machine
04:50 - okay so basically
04:54 - you have ruby and like you can click on
04:57 - download button
04:58 - and this will give you a list from where
05:00 - you can choose from which ruby version
05:02 - you have to download and install
05:04 - i would recommend you to download this
05:05 - latest version and then you can walk
05:07 - through if you have like
05:09 - followed in previous tutorials so you
05:10 - must have already you followed this
05:12 - step to install ruby on your machine
05:15 - okay so this is the fifth part now uh
05:18 - to access like to access
05:22 - check whether ruby installed you need to
05:23 - type ruby
05:26 - minus minus version uh
05:29 - you have ruby now ruby by default
05:32 - installs the gem package
05:34 - manager so gem minus minus version
05:37 - so so 3.23 is also installed
05:40 - so now you have to execute two commands
05:42 - one is gem install sqlite3
05:45 - okay okay then gem install sqlite3
05:48 - would like install sqlite on your
05:50 - machine and
05:52 - there's something like this you need to
05:55 - type
05:56 - okay and yeah so this is
06:00 - this is the step is needed uh and
06:03 - another one is this you have to learn
06:05 - around this command gem install rails
06:08 - so after running these two command then
06:11 - you can
06:12 - like you have installed rails on your
06:14 - machine successfully
06:16 - but this one is the most important
06:17 - command gem install rails
06:19 - okay so after that you have to type
06:22 - rails minus minus version
06:24 - then you have rails on your machine so
06:26 - the latest version of the rails is six
06:28 - point one point three
06:29 - six point one point three point one so
06:32 - like uh then you have installed rails on
06:35 - your machine
06:36 - so i walked you through the part like uh
06:40 - how you can install rails on your
06:42 - machine
06:43 - then simply you can move to like
06:46 - see so see you can move to desktop
06:50 - i can move to desktop and i will do
06:53 - rails new and basically this is your
06:56 - project name
06:58 - okay so you can type any project name
07:01 - i can type rails my project
07:04 - and here you can see that now it will
07:08 - start creating a rails project
07:10 - on your machine and a bundle installed
07:12 - is like installing all the like
07:13 - dependencies required for your project
07:16 - so basically this would show you how to
07:18 - install like dependencies these on your
07:20 - like for your project and
07:23 - when this process is successful
07:26 - then you are able to run the rails
07:28 - application on your machine
07:30 - okay so like this would like take a
07:32 - little time
07:34 - so you can like so basically then you
07:37 - can i can walk you through
07:38 - like a few commands so basically rails
07:41 - i'll give a quick overview rails is an
07:45 - mvc architecture so mvc m
07:48 - stands for model so n stand for models
07:52 - uh v stands for view and
07:55 - c stands for controller
07:59 - okay so models is like basically
08:02 - like working with your database
08:06 - database and then you have view
08:09 - then like views like presentation on
08:12 - front end
08:12 - presentation layer presentation layer
08:18 - and controller is like communicating
08:22 - logic and communication okay
08:26 - so so basically logic and communication
08:31 - and and then you can see either linking
08:34 - the above to
08:34 - linking above to
08:38 - okay so like this is like mvc
08:41 - architecture
08:41 - followed in rails so here you can see
08:44 - like
08:45 - uh it's in installing like the rails or
08:47 - it's like
08:48 - like drills on your like a project
08:51 - on your machine then you can type the
08:54 - command
08:56 - uh so basically there are two commands
08:58 - one is rails
09:00 - new project name
09:04 - and you can then type rails server okay
09:08 - so by default it will start with server
09:10 - on your local machine
09:12 - okay so i hope it's good to go then
09:15 - the real server will be started on your
09:16 - local machine so this is how like the
09:19 - process will go
09:20 - and then you like like this is like
09:25 - this follower so
09:29 - so we can like wait for this process to
09:31 - complete
09:34 - then i think we can like start the real
09:36 - server on our machine
09:42 - so hey everyone welcome back so like uh
09:44 - like i had like
09:46 - now this has been installed the rails
09:48 - project has been
09:49 - industrialized in our like directory so
09:51 - basically
09:52 - uh we can like i was this here see use
09:55 - personal desktop i had created the rails
09:57 - project here now i can move inside my
09:59 - project by cd
10:01 - my project and i can simply type rails
10:03 - server
10:05 - and here you can see now the real server
10:07 - will start on
10:08 - my local host and at the same point
10:12 - you can move to the project inside the
10:14 - same project directory and you type code
10:16 - dot
10:17 - dot so this would open vs code so
10:19 - basically this is the gem file
10:21 - like they're like various things here so
10:24 - we will like
10:25 - go over through it and like
10:28 - so the rails like server has been
10:30 - started on my machine
10:32 - so now you can type local
10:35 - host colon 3000
10:39 - and you can see the rails or server runs
10:41 - perfectly fine on my machine
10:43 - so this is like the rails now you can
10:46 - this is how you can access real server
10:48 - on your machine and at the same time you
10:50 - can see
10:51 - that i made a get request for the same
10:53 - so you can drag the server here
10:55 - so from next we will start with some
10:57 - basics of rails so thank you for
10:59 - watching this tutorial thank you
11:02 - everyone
