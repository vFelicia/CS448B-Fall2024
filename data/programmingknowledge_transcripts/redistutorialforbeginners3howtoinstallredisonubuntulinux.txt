00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:01 - register total for beginners in this
00:03 - video I'm going to show you how you can
00:05 - download and install Redis on our Linux
00:08 - operating system for this demonstration
00:10 - I will be using Ubuntu operating system
00:13 - so let's get started so there are two
00:16 - ways of installing Redis on our Ubuntu
00:20 - operating system so first of all we can
00:23 - use apt-get install to install Redis but
00:28 - there is a disadvantage of installing
00:31 - Redis using apt CAD and that is the
00:35 - version you will install so with apt-get
00:40 - whenever you use app CAD to install
00:42 - Redis the repositories are not updated
00:45 - frequently as the Redis portion is
00:49 - released so you will be able to see that
00:52 - you have installed the older version of
00:55 - Redis if you use apt-get command so for
01:00 - example let's go to the Redis website so
01:03 - search for Redis and the first result
01:06 - which will appear here will be from
01:09 - ready Scott Eyre and we will see the
01:11 - version of for Redis right now so as I
01:14 - can see here the Redis four point zero
01:17 - point zero is the latest version right
01:20 - and we can see using the up cat command
01:24 - so I'm going to open the terminal here
01:26 - in Ubuntu
01:27 - and here I can just type app - cash - no
01:32 - the version of Redis available right so
01:36 - just write app cache and then policy and
01:39 - then the Redis server so just write
01:42 - Redis - server ok and then press ENTER
01:47 - and then you will be able to see the
01:49 - version so as far as I can see the
01:52 - version of a label using apt-get command
01:56 - will be 2.8 or something near to that
02:00 - right for my Ubuntu operating system it
02:04 - may be different if you have the more
02:05 - newest version of Ubuntu I have
02:08 - Ubuntu 14.04 but if you have for example
02:13 - ubuntu 16.04 or given to 17.04 it may be
02:20 - little bit better this version but it
02:23 - will not be the latest version which is
02:26 - four point zero point zero in most of
02:29 - the cases right so if you want the
02:32 - easiest way then you can just write sudo
02:35 - apt - get install Redis - server ok and
02:42 - then once you press enter it's going to
02:45 - install ready server on your Ubuntu
02:48 - operating system but the version of this
02:51 - Ubuntu server will be 2.8 right so in
02:55 - this case I'm going to show you how you
02:56 - can install the latest version of Redis
02:59 - so for that I'm going to just clear the
03:03 - terminal let's go to the website once
03:05 - again so I'm on the red s dot IO website
03:08 - and I will just click downloads here and
03:11 - then I will go little bit down and I can
03:15 - see the version 4.0 point zero and I
03:19 - will scroll a little more down and I can
03:23 - see this installation step here and here
03:27 - it's using W get to get this zip file
03:32 - and then we need to unzip the zip file
03:35 - and then we will do CD and then we will
03:39 - make the Redis binaries right so this is
03:43 - the procedure for installing Redis on a
03:47 - Linux operating system or a Mac
03:49 - operating system this procedure will be
03:52 - almost the same right so let's open that
03:54 - terminal first of all and then once the
03:57 - terminal is open we are going to install
04:00 - two packages here one is the build
04:03 - essential package and other is the TCL
04:06 - package build essential package we use
04:08 - to compile our binaries for the raddest
04:12 - server and TCL package we will use to
04:15 - test our binaries ok so first of all we
04:18 - will give this command sudo apt - get
04:22 - update first of all we will update all
04:26 - the repositories and I am going to
04:27 - my Ubuntu password so updates is done
04:30 - I'm going to just clear the terminal
04:33 - once again and this time I will give
04:35 - sudo app - get install build essential
04:40 - and TCL okay and then press Enter which
04:44 - is going to install these two packages
04:46 - in my case I can see both the packages
04:50 - are already installed so if they are
04:53 - already installed you will see these
04:55 - kind of message that they are already
04:57 - installed otherwise if they are not
04:59 - present they will be installed on your
05:00 - system so first of all give this command
05:03 - to install these two packages and then
05:06 - once again let me clear the terminal and
05:08 - then we are ready to install Redis using
05:12 - these command which are there on the
05:15 - Redis dot IO website right so the first
05:18 - command is just to download this tar
05:21 - file so what we are going to do is I'm
05:25 - going to first of all make a Redis
05:27 - folder so let me make a Redis folder and
05:30 - K dir Redis and then I will CD to this
05:36 - Redis folder or directory
05:39 - and inside this directory I am going to
05:41 - give this W get command which I copied
05:44 - from the Redis website so let me just
05:47 - maximize the terminal and just give this
05:51 - command so w get HTTP download whatever
05:54 - version of the Redis you are downloading
05:58 - so at the time of making this video for
06:00 - point zero point zero is the latest
06:02 - version so you can see this version 4.0
06:05 - point zero right otherwise this version
06:09 - will be different in your case if the
06:10 - latest version is released right so this
06:13 - just give this command and then press
06:15 - Enter it is going to download this tar
06:18 - file you can see the star per file is
06:21 - downloaded and then let me clear the
06:24 - terminal once again and let me do LS
06:25 - once again and now we are going to give
06:28 - the tar command to unzip this tar file
06:34 - so just give this command copy and paste
06:37 - nothing else and then once again LS
06:40 - you can see this red is four point zero
06:43 - point zero directory is extracted and
06:46 - then we will go inside this Redis
06:49 - directory CD to this directory and then
06:52 - we just need to give them make command
06:55 - so just give make command so just right
06:58 - make here and then press enter which is
07:02 - going to start the making of this Redis
07:07 - binaries it can take some time so just
07:11 - wait for the process to complete so now
07:14 - I can see the make command is
07:16 - successfully completed and at the end of
07:19 - the make command I can see this message
07:22 - it says it's good idea to run make test
07:25 - after this may come on so I'm going to
07:28 - run make test now so I'm going to just
07:30 - give make test command and then press
07:33 - ENTER and let it run so now the make
07:36 - test command is also finished so now
07:39 - let's go to the next step so I'm going
07:41 - to the website so make test is finished
07:44 - and now it says we just need to go to
07:47 - the source and we need to start the
07:51 - ready server using the source folder and
07:54 - then Redis server okay and ready CLI
07:58 - will be started from source where this
08:02 - CLI right so let's start red if server
08:05 - first of all so let's do LS here and I
08:09 - can see this source directory right so I
08:12 - can just start the ready server like
08:15 - this so you just need to give sr c /a
08:20 - Redis so okay and then press enter which
08:24 - is going to start the ready server and
08:26 - you can see the ready server has been
08:29 - started I will just move it to the left
08:32 - hand side this come on line terminal and
08:35 - now I will open the next terminal so let
08:38 - me open the next terminal and then in
08:41 - this next terminal I'm going to start
08:43 - the Redis line so I will just go to the
08:46 - register ik tree once again where I have
08:49 - installed or created the binaries and
08:53 - then I will go to the
08:54 - the reddest directory and then we give
08:58 - this Redis command so SRC and then
09:02 - forward slash ratify thing so let me do
09:06 - LS once again and yes SRC is here so I
09:10 - will give SRC forward slash Redis client
09:16 - or CLI I think yeah so right if CLI let
09:20 - me just make it little bit bigger so we
09:23 - can see it perfectly so now you can see
09:27 - we are connected to the server using
09:30 - this IP address and on this port so you
09:33 - can see the reddit server was started on
09:36 - this default port 67 9 and we are
09:40 - connected to this port using the Redis
09:42 - CLI so let's set something so I'm going
09:46 - to set for example name max for example
09:50 - and then press ENTER and it says ok and
09:53 - now I will just get name and it's going
09:57 - to give me the name max so everything is
10:00 - working fine but one more thing we can
10:04 - do here is because we have installed
10:06 - Redis on some directly on a particular
10:11 - directory every time we need to start
10:13 - Redis we need to CD to that directory
10:17 - and then we need to start the server and
10:20 - we do not want that we want that
10:23 - whenever we give the Redis server
10:26 - command from any directory we just need
10:30 - to start the Redis server so in order to
10:32 - do this what we need to do is let me
10:35 - just minimize this and let me just
10:37 - maximize this terminal and we are inside
10:40 - the raddest directory as you already
10:43 - know and you can see the SRC folder is
10:47 - already here right so this is the SRC
10:51 - folder now the last command you can give
10:54 - here is make install so that whenever
10:57 - you give Redis server command from
10:59 - anywhere from any directory it will
11:02 - start the server and you don't need to
11:04 - navigate to this particular directory in
11:07 - order to
11:08 - at the ready server so just give make
11:11 - install command in order to install
11:14 - ready server and ready
11:16 - CLI so let's do that and it save that
11:20 - cannot create regular file because the
11:23 - permissions are denied permission denied
11:26 - that means I need to give the sudo
11:29 - command before the make install so just
11:31 - give sudo make install command here ok
11:35 - so you just need to give sudo make
11:38 - install come on and then once again
11:41 - press enter and now the Redis server and
11:45 - ready CLI and other stop which are there
11:48 - inside this SRC folder is installed
11:52 - right so let me just close this terminal
11:55 - and let me open the fresh terminal now
11:59 - and we are not inside that Redis
12:02 - directory right we are in our home
12:04 - folder and then from here I will just
12:06 - give Redis server command and it will
12:11 - start the server so I don't need to
12:13 - navigate to that that Redis direct tree
12:16 - because Redis is now installed on up on
12:20 - my system in a same way I can start the
12:23 - client so I will just start on new
12:24 - terminal and I will just give read if -
12:28 - CLI to connect to it and I am connected
12:32 - right so in this way you can download
12:34 - and install Redis on your Ubuntu Linux
12:37 - operating system I hope you have enjoyed
12:39 - this video please we're coming subscribe
12:41 - and bye for now
