00:03 - hello guys and welcome to programming
00:05 - knowledge on the previous video we
00:07 - learned about how to create a
00:09 - registration form and feed that data
00:12 - into a database using the sqlite3
00:16 - package which is placing already in the
00:20 - pipe programming language so in this
00:24 - will you will be seeing about how to
00:27 - create a color chooser is slider and
00:32 - canvas so we'll just find everything
00:35 - into a small application like a paint
00:39 - kind of application so you will get an
00:41 - idea how those things work together so
00:46 - follow along with me and the code will
00:48 - be available in the description below so
00:50 - first of all from kinder involved stop
00:54 - so this is the basic procedure so it
00:56 - also provides color chooser on the scale
01:00 - and everything we will be inside the
01:03 - window modules you just have to import
01:05 - it so the second line will be from
01:08 - kinder import TT k slash comma color
01:18 - chooser now the approach will be using
01:23 - over here is kind of creating a class a
01:27 - constructor that is i-19 and within that
01:31 - will be creating different functions for
01:33 - creating also you are clearing the
01:35 - canvas and I'm creasing the width of the
01:37 - pen and etc so you will just get the
01:42 - object-oriented procedures to so first
01:45 - we'll create a class editing main class
01:51 - now we'll be using constructor that is a
01:55 - 980 method if you know pattern
01:59 - programming language might be familiar
02:02 - with it that is self comma master
02:08 - and now we'll be self thought master is
02:17 - equal to alpha so this is follow our
02:19 - kinder window we are just making sure
02:23 - that that window is executed properly
02:25 - and so this method that is an ID method
02:31 - sorry I just forgot I T okay so number
02:36 - so this particular method will be having
02:40 - default parameters for that entire small
02:44 - application which we are going to pay so
02:46 - Lucy so no program in the background
02:51 - color will be for editing so our color
02:55 - on the scope foreground sir okay and
03:01 - foreground is equal to black serve not
03:13 - color let's go digitally for background
03:19 - of the canvas letters white now okay we
03:27 - have a small mistake wheel itself okay
03:31 - okay so now we will be holding the
03:38 - coordinates x and y for the pen which
03:40 - will be which will be we will be using
03:44 - in the canvas cell let's go X is equal
03:56 - to none so it is a mentioning it as none
04:02 - got this for y same as X
04:12 - now the father default end with we are
04:15 - providing as five width is equal to five
04:28 - okay it's okay so the following two
04:51 - methods are basically used for the
04:54 - motion of the mouse the trackpad which
04:57 - we are going to draw some line or shape
04:59 - or something like that here it will be
05:07 - like this here self dot C dot mind will
05:30 - get will get over there don't wait so
05:33 - what is C right so these are the key
05:40 - binding and the mouse binding which are
05:42 - used for the motion of mouse
05:56 - cells not change
06:12 - again we'll be using this copy yes
06:24 - or reset
06:32 - I will just change the montage we do
06:36 - button press release
06:51 - oh now now be moving into the motion of
07:02 - the pen that will be using into the
07:06 - canvas okay self comma :
07:16 - if self
07:24 - dot hold X and serve dot y score okay so
07:53 - C one C drop three eight three eight
08:01 - underscore line so initially we will be
08:06 - using the canvas for just drawing lines
08:08 - so there will be no specific shapes to
08:11 - be drawn so we'll be starting with a
08:13 - with lines so this is the function use
08:16 - for it got all with X ourselves or of
08:32 - fold y comma P dot y
08:51 - or x e ex and ey comma rule it is equal
09:04 - to self then with several pen width and
09:13 - will be filling says to take color color
09:22 - that is a foreground what will be
09:26 - drawing into the canvas will have a
09:30 - color right so that is for that color
09:34 - right now program and comma
09:39 - cap style these are some of the
09:45 - functions using kinder so documentation
09:50 - is the one we refer for getting into
09:53 - details and what kind of texture will
09:58 - get when you draw something on that and
10:00 - mouse right so okay so I guess there is
10:08 - no error PDF
10:18 - you
10:26 - so
10:31 - both mole X is equal to e and z
10:35 - coordinates matching to that convenor
10:41 - y is equal to V comma plus now we'll be
10:49 - using the function reset
10:55 - along with itself for surface micro
10:59 - object on that wearable my yields on the
11:04 - score self X is equal to none again so
11:17 - what reset will do over here is that it
11:20 - will whatever drawn whatever which is
11:24 - drawn within the canvas is like erased
11:28 - so it is a function okay so that change
11:48 - so now if you want to change the width
11:51 - so change with change W self dot pen
12:12 - width is equal to e now we'll be using
12:22 - DDT everything up here
12:38 - surf Nazi God
12:51 - you
13:02 - now for changing the foreground and the
13:04 - background we have two functions change
13:06 - from down and change the background we
13:09 - have a P that so for change and spoiled
13:14 - for brown self dot color dot so what we
13:32 - using we use for ground edge so it
13:35 - should be
13:40 - color chooser not hostile
13:47 - you
13:55 - so not color not color us
14:09 - or wrong and the one
14:16 - you
14:21 - now you choose this same function for
14:24 - background coffee
14:30 - you
14:31 - you
14:35 - let's change into background
14:40 - you
14:51 - you
14:54 - now we'll be using on multiple widgets
14:58 - as is the scale the canvas and creating
15:04 - menus for Lt within a single function so
15:08 - we find draw widget the one we have
15:14 - mentioned earlier such as let's check
15:23 - whether desired draw birds
15:29 - self dot control is equal to strain so
15:38 - we'll be creating frame with an
15:39 - application and the self master tan X
15:50 - equal to 5 and y equal to 5 now for
16:05 - illegal labor
16:14 - you
16:16 - you
16:23 - not penguins so what are lo here is that
16:27 - others are used in the poll which are
16:29 - already created will be more Rico
16:34 - Alex clean you through what is going on
16:37 - today so then basically label I am
16:43 - depending wilt
16:47 - then we forwarding have fun to it this
16:50 - something which is already in covered
16:53 - earlier so I don't need to or take time
16:56 - and just come to a contribution and not
17:06 - read
17:13 - is equal to zero comma column
17:19 - you
17:23 - you
17:26 - now first line down what loser
17:36 - the procedure for creating the mangoes
17:39 - inside I'll just show you and get what
17:44 - is actually growing and how we have
17:45 - created that
17:54 - so we just went there now this method
18:00 - specific is used for creating is slider
18:03 - and slider with six waiting in position
18:11 - two and within that recording in
18:15 - position to it now control now we're
18:19 - creating a canvas side said this is the
18:23 - method for creating a canvas basic width
18:28 - height and what will be the foreground
18:31 - diagram of it now this entire thing is
18:36 - just for creating minnows
18:41 - and this method is for creating and
18:45 - executing the mean inter object
18:49 - so I guess the bonus turn that will be
18:52 - available in the description so link
18:55 - clear act from that link
19:06 - you
19:37 - cilantro run
19:39 - so it was it was within the glass so
19:42 - that is what will not run sudo me
19:47 - nonsense so we have an arrow here
19:49 - tortured line
19:58 - stick it on this coin I guess and let's
20:01 - see whether router so here is output and
20:07 - so on the middle which we have created
20:10 - over here and this will do so this is
20:15 - the menu there is a brush color
20:16 - background options and and this is the
20:23 - width it is the slider for the one we
20:26 - have used to is skilled this is for the
20:32 - slider and this is canvas the white and
20:38 - I will show you how you can go up so
20:42 - this is a basic can ask for it for
20:44 - drawing then you can increase the width
20:48 - and souza that is - color you can use
20:56 - orange okay
21:02 - you
21:04 - so these are you can use at our scale
21:09 - widget to increase individual pen width
21:13 - and let's create clear everything out so
21:17 - canvas is cleared so so that business
21:25 - for this video guys so in this video we
21:27 - have covered another thing that is the
21:29 - scale which is the canvas widget how you
21:33 - can use color chooser which is this to
21:40 - create a a small application and we'll
21:44 - show you the background and the
21:45 - foreground so if I want background has
21:48 - stopped
21:48 - okay so as you can see the canvas
21:51 - background has been changed so and I
21:54 - have always been over over here above
21:58 - and black and if you don't appear this
22:06 - is for the slider to haze and decrease
22:08 - the width of the pen so okay yeah this
22:12 - is it for this video guys thanks for
22:15 - watching
