00:01 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Java programming for
00:04 - beginners and in this video we will see
00:07 - how to get user input using
00:12 - Java so for example uh you want to
00:17 - enable user input so user should give
00:21 - you the input and then you want to
00:24 - perform some action on the input how you
00:27 - can do it I will show you in this video
00:30 - so there is a special uh class in Java
00:36 - called scanner which enables us to take
00:41 - input so we will Define scanner which is
00:45 - a class or you can uh say this can be a
00:49 - data type and then I can define a
00:53 - variable for this data type or
00:56 - instance is equal
00:58 - to
01:02 - new
01:03 - scanner and it takes some input and what
01:09 - input it
01:10 - takes so to give the output on the
01:14 - console we write
01:21 - system.out right we have seen in the
01:24 - last videos and to take input we gave
01:28 - system.in
01:30 - okay so this uh code will enable us to
01:35 - take the input from the user now for the
01:40 - first time when you write this code you
01:43 - can see a red Squigly line below the
01:48 - scanner so this is because we need to
01:52 - add this class in our uh project or in
01:58 - our project file that's why it's showing
02:01 - error so when we compile this program it
02:04 - will give us error I'm going to compile
02:06 - it and it says error exit in required
02:11 - project okay so this there is an error
02:14 - when you go to the problem tab here the
02:17 - error says scanner cannot be resolved
02:20 - okay so to solve this problem you just
02:23 - need to hover over the
02:25 - scanner and then Eclipse because it's a
02:29 - an intelligent IDE it will give you some
02:32 - suggestion to solve the problem and the
02:35 - first suggestion is import scanner and
02:38 - this is the solution of this problem you
02:40 - just click import scanner and it will
02:44 - add this line to your code and this uh
02:48 - line is nothing but it's
02:51 - importing the scanner class which is
02:55 - already defined in Java so this is uh
02:59 - provided by by Java to you which helps
03:03 - us to take the scan uh from the input uh
03:07 - from the user right so you don't need to
03:11 - even write anything you just hover over
03:13 - this and click the first option and this
03:15 - will be added okay now there will be no
03:19 - error you see there's no error right now
03:24 - okay now to
03:27 - uh show what input
03:30 - uh the user has given you can uh tell a
03:34 - user that
03:35 - you system so we will write
03:39 - system
03:41 - dot out
03:45 - dot print
03:48 - Ln and in the brackets we can ask the
03:53 - user enter
03:57 - some number okay okay and
04:02 - then in the next line we will Define a
04:05 - variable we have seen how to declare a
04:07 - variable in the last video so for
04:10 - example
04:11 - int
04:13 - uh
04:16 - user
04:20 - input number this is the variable name
04:23 - this is long but uh it uh you know
04:28 - explains uh the use of this variable
04:31 - right and then you just need to use the
04:35 - scan object which is this one small
04:39 - scan and then you just need to paste it
04:42 - here then just write Dot and when you
04:45 - write dot it will give you some
04:48 - suggestions right and we are looking for
04:51 - taking number as an input because this
04:55 - is integer right so we are take uh
04:59 - interested in taking numbers as an input
05:02 - so just search for uh next int okay next
05:09 - int and then just give this uh semicolon
05:15 - here and in the next line we are just
05:17 - going to print uh the value
05:22 - so we will just
05:25 - print the entered value is
05:32 - the
05:34 - entered value is and then you can just
05:40 - print the value right so you can just
05:44 - write print I haven't told you what is
05:48 - the meaning of this print
05:50 - system.out.print without Allen then this
05:54 - will just
05:56 - print your output without
06:00 - breaking the line okay so just copy this
06:04 - uh variable from here and paste it here
06:09 - and now I'm going to run this
06:11 - program and now you can see the output
06:15 - here is enter some number so we will
06:17 - enter some number for example thousand
06:21 - so we have given this user input so it's
06:25 - asking uh the program is asking the user
06:28 - to enter some number so we have entered
06:31 - this number th000 and press enter and it
06:34 - says the entered value is 1,000 which is
06:39 - printed by these two lines
06:42 - okay in the same way uh you can rerun
06:46 - this uh
06:48 - program and once again you can give some
06:50 - number for example some random number
06:54 - and press enter and it says the entered
06:57 - value is this okay
07:00 - so in the same way this is just for the
07:04 - number so next in it says you want or
07:10 - you are expecting an integer now suppose
07:13 - you want to scan or you want that the
07:17 - user must enter some uh double value or
07:22 - some uh text value how you can do this
07:27 - so you can do this at I will just copy
07:30 - the same uh lines from
07:33 - here but instead of uh using this
07:38 - scan I'm just defining another scanner
07:41 - which is scan one and in here I will say
07:44 - enter
07:46 - some
07:48 - uh
07:50 - decimal value okay and then I will just
07:56 - change it to double and in here whenever
08:01 - you are expecting double value user
08:06 - input double then you need to change
08:10 - this function so you now expecting
08:13 - double Valu so scan dot next Double okay
08:19 - so whatever you are expecting from here
08:23 - you need to ensure that next after next
08:27 - this uh name comes here right so right
08:30 - now you're
08:32 - expecting the double value okay so what
08:36 - we are doing in this code first we will
08:39 - ask for a number then we will ask for
08:43 - the uh double value and this scan should
08:46 - be changed to scan one right we will
08:50 - compile the
08:52 - program and first it says give the
08:55 - number I will give number 4222 and it
08:59 - says the entered value is uh
09:04 - 422 and then it says enter some decimal
09:09 - value so I will enter some decimal value
09:13 - 1451 1523 for example and press enter
09:18 - and it says enter value
09:21 - is the same right so in this way you can
09:24 - take double as an input okay now for
09:29 - example you want to take uh some text
09:33 - input okay so take to take a text input
09:38 - what you need to do is you need to
09:40 - Define here
09:43 - string and a
09:45 - string is a data type which uh you know
09:50 - takes a string string means uh the array
09:54 - of
09:55 - characters right and in here you just
09:59 - need to change it to scan
10:04 - dot next line so we are expecting a line
10:09 - from the user this time and please I
10:12 - enter
10:13 - some
10:15 - string and the entered string is okay so
10:20 - string means uh some kind of text uh we
10:24 - are expecting from the user okay and
10:28 - this also so we can change it to
10:31 - string and the variable name here also
10:34 - we will change as
10:36 - string now we when we run the program
10:40 - here the program says please enter some
10:44 - uh string we will enter
10:48 - hi
10:50 - there
10:51 - how are you for example this is a string
10:56 - and press enter and it says the entered
10:59 - string is hi there how are you right so
11:03 - in this way you can take uh different
11:06 - kind of inputs from the user and print
11:10 - it uh or assign it to some variable and
11:13 - then use this variable uh in your
11:16 - program in the same way in this in the
11:20 - place of this next line there can be
11:23 - different uh function which can call
11:25 - Float next float is there next uh simple
11:30 - next is there which uh will return you
11:33 - uh the
11:35 - string there are some uh function like
11:39 - next Boolean which can take uh Boolean
11:42 - value next big decimal that next big
11:45 - integer Next Bite next float so whatever
11:49 - data type input you want to take you
11:51 - just need to uh take the corresponding
11:54 - next uh value to this okay so I have
11:59 - hope you understood the basic concept of
12:01 - taking or or scanning inputs from the
12:04 - user and I hope you enjoyed this video
12:06 - please wait comment and subscribe and
12:08 - bye for now
