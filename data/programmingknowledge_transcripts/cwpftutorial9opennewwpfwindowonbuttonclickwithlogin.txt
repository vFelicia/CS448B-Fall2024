00:01 - hello guys welcome once again in the
00:03 - last video I have shown you how to use
00:05 - password box with your wpfc shop
00:09 - application and when I run my program
00:13 - now I can give any username and when I
00:16 - give the password it is replaced by a
00:20 - character which is set by
00:22 - me so like this and now I can log log in
00:27 - or Press login and it will show me a
00:29 - message
00:30 - in this video I will show you how to
00:33 - create and open a
00:36 - second WPF window when you logged in so
00:41 - what I want is when I log in when I
00:43 - press login and my username and password
00:46 - is correct then it should go to the next
00:51 - window and if my username and password
00:54 - is not correct then it will show me a
00:58 - regular message
01:00 - so in this video I will show you how to
01:03 - create a
01:04 - new window and I will also show you how
01:09 - to jump or how to go from one window to
01:14 - other other when your password is
01:16 - correct username and password is correct
01:20 - so what you need to do is just go to
01:22 - your project right click your
01:25 - project and go to
01:28 - add add new
01:30 - new
01:31 - item and you need to go here in
01:35 - WPF here and select this
01:39 - window and I will leave this uh window
01:44 - name as default which is window
01:48 - one
01:50 - and I will just or I can change this
01:54 - window name
01:57 - as second. XM ml so I know that this is
02:02 - my second form okay so
02:06 - just give the name which you want and
02:09 - press add and it will create a second
02:13 - XML form
02:15 - here now go to your first form once
02:18 - again because we want to open a new
02:23 - window when I press this login button
02:26 - and my username and password is correct
02:29 - so just select this login button and
02:31 - double click it and in here I have
02:35 - written the
02:37 - code for login application or login
02:42 - button
02:43 - event so if you don't know how I write
02:47 - this code then you can go to the video
02:53 - where I have shown you how to make a
02:55 - login page and in that video I have
02:58 - shown you how to to write this code so
03:02 - go where your condition is wherever your
03:06 - message box is showing username and
03:08 - password is correct so I want to go in
03:11 - this condition where my username and
03:14 - password is correct and I will make a
03:19 - little space here and here I will write
03:23 - my code for opening the second window so
03:28 - what I will write here is the name of my
03:32 - XML file so
03:35 - my X XML file name is second so in here
03:40 - in the
03:41 - condition I will
03:44 - write second and I will give my form
03:48 - name so I will give SEC second and is
03:54 - equal to once again
03:57 - second and before this just write new
04:01 - and just close this and then just copy
04:05 - this second variable it showing error
04:08 - because I haven't provide this bracket
04:12 - so just copy the second paste it here
04:16 - and write
04:19 - dot show
04:23 - dialogue and bracket and bracket closed
04:27 - so you just need to add these two Lin
04:31 - when your username and password is
04:33 - correct it will
04:36 - take
04:39 - your command to this second form and it
04:42 - will open this second form so let's see
04:45 - how this uh code works so I will run the
04:50 - program and uh first uh I will enter a
04:54 - correct username and password and when I
04:58 - click
05:00 - login it shows me the message first that
05:04 - my username and password is correct when
05:06 - I click here okay it opens my second
05:10 - form
05:12 - right and whenever I enter some username
05:17 - and password which is not correct it'll
05:19 - give me the error that my
05:22 - username and password is not correct
05:27 - so here it's giving me the error or the
05:31 - error message that username and password
05:33 - is not correct and it's not opening the
05:37 - second window so only in the case of uh
05:41 - the correct username and password it
05:44 - will open the second window username and
05:46 - password is correct and it opens the
05:49 - second window so in this way you can
05:53 - open the second window with the help of
05:55 - your WPF C application I hope you have
