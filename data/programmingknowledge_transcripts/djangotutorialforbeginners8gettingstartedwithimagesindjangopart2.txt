00:00 - welcome to programming knowledge so this
00:02 - is our a tutorial for Django series so I
00:04 - again welcome your programming knowledge
00:06 - so in the previous tutorial we were
00:08 - working with images so in this tutorial
00:11 - we are also going to continue working
00:12 - with images and we will I will tell you
00:15 - how you can show images on the front-end
00:17 - part of our application in a beautiful
00:19 - manner so before this I would like to
00:22 - tell you again that this is the github
00:24 - link of our repository you can move to
00:26 - this repository download this project
00:28 - clone this project and with simple
00:30 - instructions you can run this project on
00:32 - your local machine so you can have a
00:34 - look at our source core source code as
00:36 - well so today we are going to work with
00:39 - images so in the previous tutorial I
00:41 - showed you how to show an image and I
00:44 - applied some bootstrap classes to show
00:47 - that image on the HTML page so today
00:50 - before we start we are going to
00:52 - basically have a overview of the
00:53 - bootstrap grid system so in this a group
00:56 - system I will show you that there are
00:59 - some predefined classes with extra small
01:02 - small medium large and extra large and
01:05 - this is the syntax for them called SM
01:08 - called
01:09 - MD called LG and call Excel for
01:12 - respective classes and for extra extras
01:14 - all we only need to we don't need to
01:16 - define anything with the practical
01:18 - implementation we'll get to know one
01:21 - thing you need to observe in this that
01:23 - the bootstrap container has a column
01:26 - width of total 12 columns so what you
01:29 - need to do you can define columns
01:31 - fighting either in the multiple you need
01:34 - to define them in the multiple of 12
01:35 - like either you can define for an
01:38 - example a column of width 4 then again 4
01:42 - then again 4 or then 6 and again 6
01:46 - because 4 plus 4 plus 4 is equal to 12
01:48 - and again 6 plus 6 is equal to 12 also
01:51 - of you if you want to define any other
01:53 - ratio you can define the column of the
01:56 - width 10 and the next with the 2 because
01:58 - 10 plus 2 is equal to 12 and this way
02:02 - you can define a column width of 12
02:04 - columns by defining them and giving a
02:06 - proportion with your with your desire
02:09 - what you want to give to your front end
02:12 - application so this is
02:13 - the syntax how you can have make columns
02:17 - plus rows so we will have some idea yeah
02:20 - this was what I was explaining that
02:22 - accrued to the width of the column is 12
02:24 - so what you can do do like here it is
02:27 - been mentioned the first is of column 8
02:29 - and another is of column 4 so this was
02:32 - total about 12 and this was a total bits
02:35 - of shell and this would help you and
02:37 - would shop and just you to help have a
02:39 - responsive design of your application
02:42 - like in the previous tutorial I showed
02:44 - you how you can render an image using
02:46 - bootstrap and how you can render an
02:50 - image with Django then with the help of
02:51 - bootstrap classes how you can make it
02:53 - responsive so let's get started with
02:56 - this tutorial so I would tell you first
02:59 - I would go to my vs code editor then I
03:02 - would run my server with the command
03:04 - Python manage dot py run server so this
03:15 - would start the server on my local
03:16 - machine and what we can do till the
03:20 - times I can show you one thing so this
03:23 - is our template which we hadn't made it
03:26 - yesterday so I would move to the local o
03:29 - server so what you can do the this so
03:35 - this is my local server so I would move
03:38 - to a route with the name I had defined
03:41 - in the previous two tools I would move
03:44 - to my user py file and my image page I
03:48 - had defined so I would move to that
03:50 - route my image page okay you can see an
03:56 - image had been already uploaded it down
04:00 - this route and on this page so basically
04:03 - I showed you how you can see the
04:05 - responsible design you can press control
04:08 - shift I or you can right click and go to
04:12 - inspect so this will lead to you to
04:14 - chrome developer tools and from here you
04:16 - can see the responsive design of your
04:19 - application like iPhone X shows this way
04:21 - and iPhone 6 then pixel to excel then
04:26 - galaxy s5 so this
04:27 - shows that responsive design so one
04:30 - thing you notice as soon as I was on on
04:33 - a big screen the navbar used to had
04:36 - expanded view but as soon as I moved to
04:38 - a small screen so you can see that an AK
04:41 - bar had been collapsed so this is the
04:43 - beautiful nature of bootstrap so this
04:45 - would help you in designing your
04:46 - front-end application so today what I'm
04:50 - going to do I'm going to define a path
04:54 - my image page two and in views dot py
05:01 - file
05:01 - I also defined views dot my image page
05:05 - two with the name is equal to my image
05:11 - page do okay so this looks pretty fine
05:15 - so inside my views dot py file I will
05:19 - define I'll quickly copy this and I'll
05:26 - paste it here and one changes I need to
05:28 - make my image page two it will have
05:32 - image page two dot HTML as well so
05:35 - inside my templates I need to define an
05:38 - image page two dot HTML okay I will move
05:41 - to my templates folder okay so the
05:44 - headsman so this is my image dot HTML I
05:46 - will quickly copy this control I'll
05:51 - paste it here an image page two okay
05:55 - this looks pretty fine okay so till the
05:59 - time what I will do I'll remove this
06:01 - code and I'll save it as my image page
06:14 - two dot HTML so this was predefined and
06:19 - I will move to my image page two okay so
06:26 - it says my image page two dot HTML does
06:31 - not exist oh ho I made a mistake here
06:33 - so our you need it as image page two
06:38 - sorry for the error
06:40 - now I'll quickly refresh this page over
06:43 - here this is MH page two so what I'm
06:46 - going to show you the beautiful nature
06:48 - of bootstrap here so this is a container
06:51 - fluid which you will always mentioned
06:53 - then inside this container fluid I have
06:55 - a row then now I'm telling my bootstrap
06:58 - to divide this row into two columns div
07:02 - class forget and div class is equal to
07:07 - call em d6 and I'm also defining another
07:16 - column of vit six because I told do the
07:19 - bootstrap will have six plus six is
07:22 - equal to twelve has a column width so
07:24 - I'll also define another column div
07:26 - class this is going to call MD six and
07:33 - this would now this you can see now I
07:37 - have a column of two six six six with
07:40 - each and this would sum up to twelve now
07:44 - I told you yesterday that this is the
07:46 - sentence you are going to use because I
07:48 - told you that I have a static folder
07:50 - inside there I there are two images so
07:52 - in order to load the load images from
07:55 - the static folder first you will define
07:56 - percent load static and then you need to
07:59 - define this in text with a personal
08:01 - static size this birth percent static
08:03 - with the image name and person again
08:05 - with the curly brace so I'll quickly
08:07 - copy this and this image fluid is in
08:10 - bootstrap class which helps you to make
08:11 - a responsive page okay in this first
08:14 - line I would I would put this image okay
08:20 - so this is the image I am going to put
08:23 - and one shortcut you can see I can right
08:27 - click here and click format document
08:30 - with HTML language features so what
08:34 - would it do it will format my source
08:36 - code and it will help you to better
08:37 - maintain the indentation of the code and
08:40 - in the next I'll copy this so since I'm
08:44 - showing you a demo we had done this in
08:47 - the previous tutorial how to load and
08:48 - starting image so let me give another m8
08:52 - type of Python dot PNG
08:54 - so I'll give this a name as a Python dot
08:59 - PNG and I will move to my page and and
09:04 - refresh this page so you can see now
09:07 - I'll quickly I'll click inspect and I
09:11 - will show you let me do this okay so you
09:17 - can see here I have an expansion view
09:20 - this is my row okay this is not you this
09:24 - would pretty help you to have a clear
09:27 - understanding understanding how
09:28 - bootstrap works this is my container and
09:31 - this is my nav bar okay this is a nav
09:34 - bar this is the container I go inside a
09:37 - row so this was my row then a column of
09:39 - which six you can the left portion is
09:42 - the column of six then this is the image
09:45 - okay okay
09:47 - this is the column of whit six okay then
09:50 - I move to the second column of bit six
09:52 - here it is that this was the second
09:54 - column on vest six and this is the first
09:57 - column of bit six first second and that
10:01 - was the image but now as soon as I
10:03 - change my display I moved to a galaxy s5
10:06 - see the magic yeah it automatically
10:09 - OPS's the image and it helps you to make
10:12 - much design much responsive so you need
10:15 - to inspect element in order to learn
10:17 - about this so this is again called M d66
10:21 - width and this is the six of called md6
10:24 - in another so we are going to continue
10:27 - with this in the next lecture as well
10:30 - I'll tell you how you can render images
10:33 - and how what would be the responsive
10:34 - design of your application so let's
10:38 - catch you up in the next lecture so
10:40 - thank you guys thank you so much and
10:42 - yeah thank you guys
