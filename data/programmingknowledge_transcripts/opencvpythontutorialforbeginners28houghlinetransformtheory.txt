00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - open CV tutorial for beginners using
00:04 - Python in this video we will understand
00:07 - the concept behind the half transform so
00:11 - first of all what is Hough transform so
00:14 - half transform is a popular technique to
00:16 - detect any shape if you can represent
00:19 - that shape in a mathematical form Hough
00:23 - transform can detect the shape even if
00:25 - it is broken or distorted a little bit
00:29 - now this explanation might seem a little
00:32 - bit confusing so let me explain it by an
00:36 - example so let's say you have an image
00:40 - of this road and you want to detect
00:43 - these lane lines in this road image so
00:48 - the first step in order to detect these
00:51 - Lane lines in this road is to find the
00:56 - edge pixels using canny edge detection
00:59 - or any other edge detection method now
01:02 - after you found out the edges using any
01:06 - edge detection method you want a
01:09 - geometrical representation of that edge
01:12 - and in order to find out the geometrical
01:15 - representation for example you want to
01:17 - find out the slope of this edge or its
01:21 - intercept you can use half transform to
01:25 - represent these pixels or edges in the
01:30 - mathematical or geometrical form so
01:33 - after you find out the edges using any
01:36 - edge detector you just have the sequence
01:39 - of pixels so you can loop through all
01:42 - the pixels and somehow figure out the
01:45 - slope and intercepts but it's a very
01:48 - difficult task so we want some mechanism
01:51 - that gives more weight age to pixels
01:54 - that are already in line and this is
01:57 - what we can achieve using Hough
02:00 - transform so let's begin and let's start
02:03 - with the lines so a line in the image
02:07 - can be represented by two coordinate
02:09 - systems first is using the cut
02:13 - in coordinate system and using this
02:17 - equation you can represent a line which
02:19 - is y is equal to MX plus C and you can
02:23 - also represent this line using polar
02:27 - coordinate system using this equation
02:29 - which is X cos theta plus y sine theta
02:33 - is equal to R or Rho sometimes so let's
02:38 - start with this equation first which is
02:41 - a Cartesian coordinate system equation
02:44 - which is y is equal to MX plus C so when
02:50 - you represent a line in x and y
02:53 - coordinates which is also called the XY
02:57 - space this equation looks like this so Y
03:01 - is equal to MX plus C where m is the
03:05 - slope of the line and C is the intercept
03:08 - of this line so if you know the values
03:11 - of M and C you can represent this line
03:15 - in the X and y coordinate now in Hough
03:18 - transform you can represent this line in
03:21 - other form also and this is called the M
03:25 - C space or the Hough space so using this
03:30 - equation when you take M on this axis
03:34 - and C on this vertical axis then this is
03:39 - called the M C space so earlier we have
03:42 - represented this line in the XY space
03:45 - and now we are saying that we want to
03:47 - represent this using the M C coordinate
03:51 - where M is on the horizontal line and C
03:55 - is on the vertical line so when you
03:58 - represent this simple line in the MC
04:03 - space or the half space it can be
04:06 - represented as a point so this line can
04:09 - be represented as a point so we all know
04:12 - that a line is a collection of points
04:15 - and managing the collection of points is
04:18 - tougher than managing a single point so
04:21 - if you want to manage a collection of
04:24 - point and if you were to manage
04:27 - a single point which will you prefer and
04:30 - an obvious answer will be to manage the
04:33 - single point and this is what this MC
04:35 - space is doing it's representing a line
04:39 - in the form of a point in MC space or
04:44 - the Hough space and the opposite of this
04:47 - concept is also possible so if you can
04:50 - represent a point using this coordinate
04:52 - in the XY space then it can be
04:56 - represented as a line in the MC space
05:00 - okay and the formula now will turn into
05:04 - this equation which is C is equal to
05:07 - minus X a.m. plus y a right so you can
05:13 - represent a point and if you have the
05:17 - X&Y coordinate in the MC space you can
05:21 - represent this as a line and this will
05:25 - be the equation where X will be the
05:28 - slope now and Y will be the intercept
05:31 - earlier M was the slope and C was the
05:35 - intercept but when you just transform or
05:39 - just represent this point into MC space
05:43 - then your X becomes or minus X becomes
05:47 - the slope and y becomes the intercept so
05:52 - how does these concepts are going to
05:55 - help us
05:56 - so the Hough transform is all about
06:00 - doing what we have learned converting
06:03 - points in the XY space to the lines in
06:06 - the MC space or the Huff space so for
06:10 - example you can see four points 1 2 3 4
06:15 - which are joined by a line right so you
06:20 - can represent these four points and you
06:23 - can join all these four points and it's
06:26 - our representation of a line and here
06:30 - slope is equal to M and intercept is
06:33 - equal to C in the XY space the same line
06:38 - you can represent in the
06:40 - see space using these four lines okay so
06:45 - every point is a line in the MC space
06:48 - and you see the intersection point here
06:52 - which is on the MC coordinate so you
06:56 - have taken an edge detected image and
06:59 - for every point that is a non black
07:03 - point you draw lines in the MC space and
07:07 - obviously when you draw these lines
07:09 - these lines will intersect with each
07:12 - other and these intersections mark are
07:15 - the parameter of a line okay so in the
07:19 - MC space you can represent each and
07:22 - every point as a line and they will
07:26 - intersect on a single point and now this
07:30 - intersection point can be used to draw a
07:34 - line so this was the representation of
07:37 - points in a line using MC space using a
07:42 - Cartesian coordinate system now let's
07:44 - apply these same concepts which we have
07:47 - learned using the Cartesian coordinate
07:50 - system into a polar coordinate system so
07:54 - as we all know that in the polar
07:58 - coordinate system we can represent a
08:01 - line using this equation also which is R
08:05 - is equal to X multiplied by cos theta
08:07 - plus y multiplied by sine theta or in
08:12 - other form you can also represent this
08:14 - equation like this where Y is equal to
08:19 - minus cos theta by sine theta multiplied
08:22 - by X plus R divided by sine theta so
08:27 - this is your XY space where line can be
08:31 - represented like this and we are going
08:35 - to transform or represent this line
08:38 - using this equation into the R theta
08:43 - space or the half space okay so this
08:47 - line using this equation can also be
08:50 - represented as a point in R theta or the
08:54 - ha
08:54 - space like this so let's take an example
08:58 - about this so as I said the equation was
09:02 - R is equal to X multiplied by cos theta
09:05 - plus y multiplied by sine theta where
09:09 - this theta is the angle of the line and
09:11 - R is the distance from the origin to the
09:15 - line so let's say we want to represent a
09:18 - point which is from XY space into a half
09:23 - space into R theta space so we give the
09:27 - values of x 0 and y 0 which will be the
09:31 - first point we can represent this point
09:34 - in the form of line in the half space or
09:38 - the artistas space in this formation
09:42 - which looks like a sine curve using this
09:46 - equation so this is for the one point
09:50 - representation in XY space to a line
09:54 - representation in the half space so
09:56 - let's say you have multiple points so we
09:59 - take three points then it's going to
10:03 - look like this
10:04 - so let's say x0 is equal to 8 and y 0 is
10:08 - equal to 6 X 1 is equal to 4 y 1 is
10:10 - equal to 9 and X 2 is equal to 12 and Y
10:13 - 2 is equal to 3 so we have three points
10:17 - in the XY space they can be represented
10:21 - in the half space using three lines and
10:24 - as we have seen in the Cartesian
10:26 - coordinate system these points can be
10:30 - represented in these lines in the half
10:34 - space in the polar coordinate system
10:37 - also using these curved line and this
10:40 - intersection is going to represent a
10:43 - line in the half space
10:46 - so which representation we are going to
10:49 - use in order to use the Hough transform
10:51 - so this equation is not able to
10:54 - represent the vertical lines
10:56 - that's why generally we use this
11:00 - equation or polar coordinate system in
11:03 - order to use half transform
11:06 - so the Hough transform Algar
11:08 - involves these four important steps in
11:12 - the first step as detection is done
11:14 - using canny edge detector or any edge
11:17 - detection method in the second step
11:20 - mapping of the edge points to the half
11:22 - space is done and all these edge points
11:26 - are stored in an accumulator in the
11:29 - third step interpretation of accumulator
11:32 - to yield lines of invalid length is done
11:35 - and this interpretation can be done by
11:37 - threshold Anor any other constraint the
11:41 - fourth step involves the conversion of
11:44 - infinite line to finite lines now OpenCV
11:48 - implements two kind of half line
11:50 - transforms the first is the standard
11:53 - Hough transform which is done using half
11:57 - lines method the second type is the
12:01 - probabilistic half line transform which
12:04 - is done by half lines P method so this
12:09 - is the half lines method and this is the
12:12 - half lines P method so the
12:14 - implementation of these two methods in
12:16 - OpenCV we are going to see in the next
12:19 - video so stay tuned and I'm going to see
12:22 - you in the next video
12:33 - you
