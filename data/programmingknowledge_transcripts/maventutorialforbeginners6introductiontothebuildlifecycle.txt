00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - maven tutorial for beginners in the last
00:04 - video we have seen some commands to
00:06 - build our maven project and create a jar
00:09 - file now in this video we will see how
00:12 - maven build lifecycle works now maven is
00:16 - based around the central concept of a
00:19 - build lifecycle and what this means is
00:22 - that the process of building and
00:25 - distributing a particular project is
00:27 - clearly defined now for a developer
00:31 - who's developing this project this means
00:34 - that he is only you know required to
00:37 - learn a small set of command to build
00:40 - his maven project and the palm or
00:44 - project object model will ensure that
00:47 - they get the desired result okay now
00:52 - these are the list of commands which our
00:54 - developer essentially needs to learn and
00:58 - these commands are validate compile test
01:01 - package integration tests verify install
01:05 - and deploy now some of the command we
01:08 - have already seen in the last video we
01:10 - have seen compile command test command
01:13 - and install command from this list right
01:17 - so in order to you know validate your
01:22 - project whether everything is correct in
01:26 - your project or not or any information
01:29 - or necessary information is available in
01:31 - your project or not you use this
01:34 - validate command now these commands
01:37 - follow some hierarchy so for example
01:41 - whenever you give the compile command
01:43 - which is used to compile your source
01:45 - code it's also going to you know
01:48 - validate first and then compile your
01:52 - code and for example you run this test
01:56 - command then it's going to validate
01:58 - compile and then run this test so it's
02:02 - going to you know follow some hierarchy
02:04 - so we have run the install command last
02:07 - time
02:08 - so what maven has done for us is it has
02:12 - done
02:12 - datian for us and compliation for us
02:16 - test packaging and if we have
02:19 - integration test is going to do the
02:20 - integration test and then verify and
02:23 - then run the install command so all the
02:26 - above commands before the command are
02:29 - executed in order to run you know
02:32 - install and if you do the deploy then
02:35 - all the above command will be executed
02:38 - now we have seen validate compile is to
02:42 - you know compile a source test is to
02:45 - compile your test package is used to you
02:50 - know package your code which you have
02:53 - compiled in distributable formats such
02:56 - as jar okay the integration test we
03:00 - haven't got any integration test but if
03:03 - you have integration test then this
03:06 - command will compile and you know deploy
03:09 - your integration test the verify command
03:14 - run any checks to verify the package is
03:17 - valid and means the quality criteria
03:20 - okay the install command we have already
03:23 - run last time the install command will
03:27 - install the package into a local
03:29 - repository for use as a dependency in
03:33 - other project locally and the deploy
03:36 - command is done in an integration or
03:40 - release environment and it copies the
03:43 - final package to the remote repository
03:46 - for sharing with other developers and
03:50 - projects so these are the some of the
03:53 - important phases of your maven builds
03:57 - lifecycle and these are the command you
04:01 - you know need to learn in order to
04:04 - compile your project and package your
04:07 - project and build your project right
04:11 - there are some other command which we
04:14 - have seen in the last video
04:16 - for example clean and this is not the
04:19 - part of this build lifecycle but it's
04:22 - you know the command clean handles the
04:25 - project
04:26 - cleaning right but this is not the part
04:29 - of this builds lifecycle and some of the
04:32 - command like default and site which we
04:35 - will see in the later videos are also
04:37 - not the part of this build life cycle
04:41 - but they are also used with maven so
04:45 - this is how they even build life cycle
04:47 - works I hope you enjoyed this video

04:51 - for now
