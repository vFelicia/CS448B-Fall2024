00:00 - hey guys in this video i'm going to show
00:01 - you how you can download and install
00:04 - sqlite on your windows 11 operating
00:07 - system
00:08 - so sqlite is a database engine which is
00:10 - written in c language
00:12 - and sqlite is a self-contained
00:15 - serverless database that means you can
00:19 - create and use this sqlite database on
00:23 - your local computer
00:25 - and you can create your database and
00:27 - transfer your database from one computer
00:29 - to another without worrying about
00:32 - some server configuration
00:34 - so let's see how we can install sqlite
00:37 - on our windows 11 operating system
00:40 - so first of all open your favorite
00:41 - browser and search for sqlite and the
00:44 - first link which will appear here will
00:46 - be from
00:47 - sqlite.org so we are going to click on
00:49 - this link
00:51 - in here you will be able to see this
00:53 - downloads tab here on the top you can
00:56 - also see the downloads button
00:59 - under the latest releases
01:02 - so you can click any of
01:04 - these links i'm going to click on
01:05 - downloads tab here
01:07 - and once you click on the downloads tab
01:10 - you will see different
01:13 - versions of downloads right so you can
01:16 - download the source code
01:18 - you can download the documentation
01:20 - pre-release snapshot
01:23 - we are interested in the pre-compiled
01:26 - binaries for windows so just scroll down
01:30 - where it says pre-compiled binary for
01:32 - windows
01:33 - and we will download the sqlite tool
01:38 - for our windows 11 operating system
01:40 - right
01:41 - so just select the third option here
01:44 - which says sqlite tool win32
01:48 - and you can see what it says a bundle of
01:51 - command line tools for managing sqlite
01:53 - database files
01:55 - so i'm going to click on this link which
01:57 - is going to download this zip file
02:00 - so once this zip file is downloaded just
02:02 - go to the location where
02:05 - this zip file is downloaded
02:07 - and first of all we need to extract this
02:09 - zip file so right click on it
02:11 - and you can choose any tool or
02:14 - which you have for extracting this zip
02:17 - file i'm going to click on extract
02:20 - and then i'm going to click on
02:22 - extract once again
02:24 - which is going to extract this zip file
02:27 - in the downloads folder itself
02:29 - so once this zip file is downloaded you
02:32 - will be able to see only three files
02:34 - here so what i like to do here is i just
02:37 - cut this folder from here so let me cut
02:40 - this folder
02:41 - and then i go to the c folder and then
02:44 - i'm going to paste this folder here
02:47 - and then i'm going to rename this folder
02:49 - so let me rename this folder
02:52 - to sqlite 3
02:54 - right so this way i can remember where i
02:58 - have
02:59 - my sqlite binaries
03:01 - and i can also set the environment
03:05 - variables for the sqlite which will help
03:08 - me to run my sqlite commands from
03:11 - my command prompt right
03:13 - so once you have copied this sqlite 3
03:16 - into your c directory just go
03:18 - where all of your executable files
03:21 - related to sqlite
03:23 - are there and then copy this path from
03:26 - here
03:26 - we need to set the environment variables
03:28 - for sqlite in order to use so just copy
03:31 - this path from the top and then just
03:34 - click on the search icon here and then
03:36 - search for environment variables and
03:38 - when you type few letters of environment
03:41 - in the search result you will be able to
03:43 - see this
03:44 - result which says edit the system
03:46 - environment variables
03:48 - click on this option
03:49 - which is going to open this kind of
03:51 - window
03:52 - click on environment variables here and
03:54 - then click on path environment variables
03:57 - under system variable
03:59 - so just select this and then click on
04:01 - edit
04:02 - and here you just need to create a new
04:04 - environment variable and then paste your
04:07 - path so my path is c
04:10 - colon backslash sqlite3 in my case
04:13 - so make sure you copy the path where all
04:17 - your files relate to sqlite are there
04:20 - right so this is the path
04:22 - just paste the path here once you are
04:24 - done click on ok and then click on ok
04:27 - and once again click on ok so once you
04:30 - are done setting the environment
04:31 - variables for sqlite you can start using
04:34 - sqlite using command prompt so just
04:36 - search for cmd and then open the command
04:39 - prompt
04:40 - and in here you can just type sql ite
04:44 - sqlite 3 and then press enter
04:48 - and if you see this kind of
04:51 - output which
04:52 - will show the version of sqlite which
04:55 - you have downloaded in my case escalade
04:58 - version 3.372
05:00 - and here you can see uh that sqlite
05:04 - shell has been started so from here you
05:06 - can create the database
05:08 - you can
05:10 - manage your database using the command
05:13 - prompt from this shell right
05:16 - now let me show you some basic sqlite
05:19 - command so how you can get help
05:22 - about sqlite
05:24 - when you type dot
05:25 - help here and then press enter
05:28 - you will be able to see all the commands
05:30 - which are available in your sqlite
05:34 - database
05:35 - and then
05:36 - you can use one of these command
05:38 - to uh manage and use sqlite right
05:42 - so one such command is dot quit you can
05:45 - use this command dot
05:48 - quit
05:49 - to quit
05:50 - from your escalate shell so now i'm out
05:54 - of my escalate shell right
05:56 - now how we can create a sqlite database
06:00 - so let me just close this command prompt
06:02 - let's say i want to create this database
06:04 - on our directory which is on my desktop
06:08 - so let me create
06:09 - a new directory here so let so let's say
06:13 - this directory name is db
06:16 - and i want to create my database here so
06:18 - let me just open this db database here
06:22 - and once again i'm going to open the
06:24 - command prompt by just typing cmd
06:28 - and
06:29 - let me just move this
06:31 - command from little bit
06:33 - on the right hand side so you can see
06:36 - the
06:37 - database which is created inside this
06:39 - folder
06:40 - so first of all copy the path where you
06:43 - want to create this database and then
06:45 - just type cd and then paste this path
06:48 - press enter
06:50 - so now you are inside this uh database
06:53 - directory where you want to create this
06:55 - database right
06:57 - so here you can just type sqlite
07:00 - 3 and the name of your database in my
07:03 - case let's say i want to just create my
07:06 - db
07:07 - which is the name of my database and
07:09 - then the extension you can give db
07:12 - extension or sqlite extension whatever
07:14 - you like and then press enter
07:17 - once you do that your database is
07:20 - created so you are switched
07:22 - into this database but still you will
07:24 - not see any database file which is
07:27 - uh visible on in your database folder in
07:31 - order to view your database you can give
07:33 - this command dot databases and then
07:36 - press enter and it's going to show me
07:40 - all the databases
07:42 - which
07:43 - i'm using so once you give this command
07:45 - it's going to show you the list of all
07:47 - the databases right now we have only one
07:50 - database and now you can see
07:52 - this database file which is created here
07:55 - now how you can create a table inside
07:57 - your database so as you have created
08:00 - this
08:01 - mydb.db database and you are
08:04 - working inside this database when you
08:06 - give this command
08:08 - you can create the table using this
08:10 - command you can just write
08:12 - create and then the table
08:15 - and then write table here and then the
08:18 - name of your table let's say my table
08:21 - name will be
08:23 - books
08:24 - and then inside these
08:26 - parentheses
08:28 - i can give my column names
08:30 - so let's say i just want to give one
08:33 - column name which will be id
08:36 - and the data type will be int here and
08:38 - let's say it will be the primary keys so
08:41 - i can just write primary key here and
08:44 - then once you are done you just need to
08:45 - give the semicolon here so this command
08:48 - is going to create a table with the name
08:50 - books and it will have only one column
08:53 - which will be called id right i'm going
08:56 - to press enter here
08:58 - so this table is created so once your
09:01 - table is created how you can view the
09:03 - table
09:04 - so you can give this command dot
09:07 - tables and then press enter
09:09 - and you will be able to see all the
09:11 - tables inside your database we only have
09:13 - one table which is called books
09:16 - so
09:16 - i can see only one table here now if i
09:19 - want to see the schema of the table i
09:21 - can just write dot
09:24 - schema here and then the name of the
09:26 - table which is books in my case and then
09:29 - press enter
09:30 - it's going to show me the schema of that
09:32 - table so you can see
09:34 - this table
09:35 - contain only one column
09:38 - and this table name is books right
09:41 - so this is how you can install and use
09:43 - sqlite database on your windows 11
09:46 - operating system i hope you've enjoyed
09:48 - this video and i will see you in the
09:50 - next video
