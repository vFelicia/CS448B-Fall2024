00:00 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:02 - show you how to download a file from
00:04 - internet using your Visual Basic Windows
00:06 - Form
00:07 - application so I have this sample
00:10 - project and I have taken a button here
00:14 - and I've changed this text to the button
00:18 - I hope you know how to drag and drop a
00:20 - button and change the text by now and
00:24 - now I want to for example I want to
00:26 - download a file from my website which is
00:29 - a p file so let me show you which I want
00:32 - to download so this file I want to
00:34 - download and I have the URL of the file
00:38 - which is program knowledge. g/ images.
00:43 - header
00:45 - image.png so I will copy the path of
00:48 - this file and go to my project and now I
00:51 - will double click this button and in
00:53 - here I will write my
00:57 - DOT computer do dot Network do download
01:03 - file and in the bracket I will pass two
01:07 - argument first is the URL of the file
01:10 - which I have just copied so I will just
01:13 - give this double codes and copy the path
01:15 - of the file and second is
01:19 - the name of the file and the folder of
01:22 - the file where you want to download your
01:25 - file so for example I have a folder
01:28 - where I want to download a file so I
01:30 - copy the path of that
01:32 - folder and I in the double quotes as a
01:35 - second argument I will paste this path
01:37 - here and I need to give the name to the
01:42 - file so copy the path and just give the
01:46 - name to your path so for example I will
01:50 - give my um image name as
01:56 - image.png file right and don't forget
01:59 - when you copy the path these backward
02:03 - slashes should be forward slashes so
02:06 - just change these backward slash to the
02:08 - forward slash otherwise it should not
02:12 - take the right path so just go to Every
02:16 - backward slash and convert it to the
02:18 - forward
02:20 - slash okay so now this program is
02:25 - complete just take two argument one is
02:28 - the URL and second is the name of the
02:30 - file and the folder in which you want to
02:32 - save now I will run the
02:35 - program and I will also open the folder
02:39 - where I'm downloading the file so you
02:40 - can see it download when it's downloaded
02:44 - so when I click this button it should
02:45 - give me image.png in this folder so
02:48 - let's click the
02:51 - button and you can see here it has
02:54 - produced a file called
02:57 - image.png and when I open this file
03:01 - it is the same file which I downloaded
03:05 - from my
03:07 - website so let's open this
03:16 - file okay so this is the file I have
03:18 - downloaded which is the same file here
03:22 - okay so in this way you can download any
03:26 - file it can be a PDF or zip or text or
03:30 - any other format which is download
