00:01 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Android app development for
00:04 - beginners and in this video we will see
00:08 - how we can make a very basic app to add
00:12 - two numbers so what we are going to do
00:15 - is we are going to take two inputs two
00:19 - numbers from user and uh by clicking
00:23 - some button we are going to add these
00:25 - two numbers so that you will be able to
00:28 - learn how uh these uh button action
00:32 - perform or button click event works and
00:36 - how uh these text boxes
00:39 - work so let's get started I have deleted
00:43 - my older uh large text widget from here
00:47 - and now my activity is blank so what I'm
00:50 - going to do is I'm going to go to
00:54 - the text field here and in here I'm
00:58 - going to uh take
01:00 - this number field so I'm going to take
01:03 - one number field and I'm going to take
01:06 - another number field so I'm going to add
01:09 - two numbers right now I will can
01:12 - doubleclick this text box and I can add
01:16 - the text to this text field but right
01:19 - now uh text field is not required
01:22 - because uh uh we are not going to
01:25 - display any text on uh these text boxes
01:29 - but you can see the ID is important ID
01:33 - is the unique uh ID which differentiates
01:38 - one tool from other another for example
01:42 - this edit text ID is the ID of this uh
01:47 - number text and edit text ID 2 is the ID
01:52 - of this second edit text right now to uh
01:59 - show uh this number text or added text
02:03 - uh a little bit more or why we are using
02:06 - this addit text we can provide the hint
02:10 - to this uh text box so you just select
02:14 - this added text and go to the property
02:18 - called hint so there is a property
02:21 - called hint and here we can uh provide
02:24 - the hint to the user that what he is
02:27 - expected to enter here so for example I
02:29 - will
02:36 - say so now uh these are the hint you can
02:40 - provide so it will uh you know uh appear
02:43 - on your text boxes but it will not
02:46 - appear as a text but it will appear as a
02:49 - hint for example you want to uh you know
02:52 - provide the hint that this can be the
02:55 - text box for email or some name or any
02:58 - other hint you want to provide to any
03:01 - text box you can provide uh this uh Hint
03:04 - by going to the property called hint
03:06 - here okay and whatever text you write
03:09 - here it will be uh provided as a hint
03:13 - now to add these new
03:15 - numbers uh how we want to display the
03:19 - message you can uh display message by
03:24 - these plain text views or any other text
03:28 - views from here so we are going to take
03:31 - this uh text view which is a plain text
03:35 - View and we are going to make it little
03:39 - bit larger and you can you know adjust
03:44 - the length of the uh text view by
03:47 - adjusting these uh this thing okay so
03:51 - for now uh let's take a large text
03:58 - View
04:03 - we are going to add one more button to
04:07 - our activity so that whenever this
04:10 - button is clicked we should be able to
04:13 - see the results so in the visits you
04:15 - just drag and drop a button
04:19 - here now what we need to do is now our
04:24 - design is complete we have two text
04:26 - boxes we have a result uh text box or
04:32 - text edit or text View and we have our
04:38 - button and once you uh have these in
04:41 - your activity you will be able to see
04:43 - them here so you have added text one
04:46 - edit text two and text view which is
04:50 - this one and the button which is this
04:53 - one right now everything is done then we
04:57 - are going to go to our Java folder and
04:59 - in our Java folder we are going to go
05:02 - inside the main activity so go inside
05:05 - your main activity or just open this
05:08 - main activity. Java okay and last time
05:12 - we have added some uh methods here to uh
05:16 - log some messages so I'm going to delete
05:18 - all these things because um we are not
05:22 - going to uh use them anymore and
05:26 - then I will go and delete up to this
05:30 - destroy and then I will delete all the
05:34 - logging messages which we have
05:37 - uh printed last time and now everything
05:41 - is clear okay so this is uh just basic
05:46 - uh main activity. Java okay so now in
05:50 - here what you need to do is we are going
05:54 - to make a public function to uh provide
05:58 - the button click event to uh the button
06:02 - so what we are going to do is we will uh
06:04 - just write public
06:06 - void
06:09 - public void and then we will write
06:15 - on
06:17 - button click okay and then make uh
06:23 - bracket here I will change my
06:27 - text format and I will write here
06:31 - view view V okay and then I will write
06:37 - something inside here okay and for the
06:42 - first time whenever you uh you know
06:45 - write this view here you will be able to
06:47 - see this red symbol here okay so what
06:51 - you need to do is you just need to click
06:54 - Alt Enter and all your Imports will be
06:57 - fixed so just just click alt and press
07:02 - enter and it will give you some option
07:04 - click the first option and then your
07:08 - error will be fixed so it has added this
07:10 - uh import android. view. view in your
07:17 - main class or main uh activity. Java
07:21 - okay so whenever you see some error just
07:24 - uh press alt and enter and it will give
07:28 - you some options okay now inside your um
07:33 - function or method you just need to
07:35 - write addit text edit text because we
07:38 - are using this and then we will uh name
07:41 - our text as for example E1 is equal to
07:45 - once again
07:46 - addit
07:48 - text and we are going to find our edit
07:52 - text by its ID so I'm going to enclose
07:56 - my this edit text with which is a
08:00 - default uh keyword for addit text and
08:04 - then I will just write
08:06 - find and you you can see it's autoc
08:10 - complete so under studio will give you
08:13 - the hints what can be uh the you know
08:17 - method you can call with this find uh
08:20 - keyword okay so just press enter and
08:23 - just write find view by ID and inside
08:27 - this we are going to find view by ID by
08:30 - writing r
08:32 - dot
08:34 - ID
08:36 - dot added
08:39 - text and this added text if you remember
08:42 - is the ID of
08:45 - the added text number one so when you go
08:49 - here and when you click this the ID of
08:53 - this is edit text you can see here or in
08:56 - the ID here in the properties you can
08:59 - see the ID of this uh text is addit text
09:03 - so this is the ID of this one right
09:06 - similarly the ID of uh this edit text 2
09:09 - is edit text 2 itself you can see here
09:12 - or you can see it here so this ID is
09:16 - this ID we are writing here okay so in a
09:20 - same way I will copy this and I will uh
09:23 - do the same for added text
09:28 - two
09:29 - text view here the result will be shown
09:33 - in the text view right so we will uh
09:36 - create the instance of uh this text view
09:55 - also what we can do now is we'll declare
09:59 - uh integer variable for
10:02 - example num one and we will assign
10:06 - whatever user will enter in this first
10:09 - text box and we will convert this text
10:12 - to the number and then we are going to
10:15 - use this number to add the
10:28 - values
10:45 - so this will give us the sum of these
10:47 - two numbers and then we can display this
10:50 - sum to our text view okay so we will
10:55 - take T1 on which we want to set our text
10:59 - and then dot set
11:02 - text and uh then we set the text so this
11:08 - is the integer and then we need to
11:10 - convert this integer to uh text so we
11:12 - will write
11:16 - integer with capital I integer dot two
11:23 - string and then sum okay so this is
11:28 - going to uh um give this in integer and
11:33 - then from integer to two string integer.
11:36 - two string we are converting our integer
11:39 - to sum okay so now we have this
11:43 - method now how can we tell this
11:47 - button that we want to call this method
11:52 - when we press this button okay so what
11:55 - we can do is just select the button so
11:58 - I'm going to select the button
11:59 - and in here in the properties I will
12:02 - find the property called
12:05 - onclick okay so just find the property
12:08 - called on click and once you are on
12:12 - click property here you can just click
12:14 - this combo box and you will be able to
12:17 - see this on button click um method
12:22 - automatically appearing here okay so
12:26 - this method which we have created when
12:28 - you go into into the uh design view you
12:32 - will be able to see this on button click
12:34 - method here you can just select it and
12:37 - now whenever we run the program we will
12:40 - be able to see our result in our
12:58 - emulator and now it's running here okay
13:02 - so our application is running Let's uh
13:05 - check this so for number one I will
13:08 - enter for example
13:11 - 500 1 and number two I will enter 6 not
13:16 - 5001 but it was 50001 and in here I will
13:20 - enter 6,002 for example or 60,000 to
13:25 - okay let's enter
13:27 - 60002 and then when I click sum see the
13:32 - result here so click sum and the sum
13:35 - will appear in here as as a result you
13:39 - can add some uh other numbers for
13:42 - example some different
13:45 - number and click okay sum and the sum
13:49 - appears here in a similar way you can
13:52 - use this um activity to calculate the
13:57 - subtraction division or multiplication
14:00 - of these two numbers so you can add some
14:03 - more method and some more buttons and
14:05 - you can uh whatever you enter here you
14:07 - can click the subtraction button or
14:10 - addition button or multiplication button
14:13 - or division button it will give you the
14:16 - same result right so this uh application
14:19 - you can simply extend it to uh do
14:22 - arithmatic operations different
14:24 - arithmetic operations with uh the two
14:28 - numbers so I hope you have enjoyed this
14:30 - video please R comment and subscribe and
14:32 - bye for now
