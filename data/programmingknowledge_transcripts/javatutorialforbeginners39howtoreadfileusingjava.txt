00:01 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:03 - Java programming tutorial for beginners
00:05 - in this video we will see how we can
00:08 - read a text file using Java now there
00:11 - are many ways of uh reading a text file
00:15 - using Java but we are going to see the
00:19 - most common way of reading file so first
00:23 - of all we need to import some classes
00:25 - which are from java IO package so first
00:30 - of all Let's uh import those classes so
00:33 - first class we need here is the buffer
00:36 - reader class and this class we are going
00:40 - to use to read your uh data okay now
00:47 - second class is the file reader which
00:49 - will read the file and third is the io
00:52 - exception which we are going to handle
00:54 - some exceptions if it's thrown by this
00:59 - file reader so first of all in my main
01:03 - method what I'm going to do is I'm going
01:05 - to create an instance of uh buffer
01:08 - reader for example BR and I will
01:11 - initialize it by null okay now I'm going
01:15 - to create a try catch block here and uh
01:21 - this
01:22 - block I'm going to use to handle some
01:25 - exception for example if file reader
01:28 - throws some exception then I'm going to
01:30 - catch it in the okay so catch and I'm
01:35 - going to catch IO exception here okay so
01:40 - just take this IO exception e and then
01:44 - we can catch this and for now this is
01:48 - going to give you this error bubble and
01:50 - when you hover over it it will say
01:52 - unreachable catch block for Io exception
01:56 - this exception is never thrown from the
01:59 - truck TR statement body which is true
02:02 - because we haven't written anything in
02:04 - our Tri block so let's uh write some
02:07 - code in our Tri block so what we are
02:10 - going to do is we are going to
02:11 - initialize BR is equal to new buffer
02:17 - reader and in the Constructor of this
02:19 - buffer reader we are going to call a
02:23 - file reader so
02:25 - file reader and inside this we are going
02:29 - to give the name of our text file okay
02:34 - so for now I have a text file which is
02:37 - present in my project folder if you know
02:40 - don't know how to reach to this project
02:43 - folder you just need to right click your
02:44 - folder go to the properties and in the
02:47 - location here you will be able to find
02:49 - the path of your project okay so this is
02:53 - the same path uh of my project and this
02:58 - is the file inside my project folder
03:01 - okay so I'm going to open it and this
03:03 - file contains some lines which I want to
03:06 - read from this text file and I want to
03:10 - print it for
03:11 - example
03:13 - so I will give the name of the file so
03:16 - if your file or if your text file is in
03:20 - your project folder you don't need any
03:22 - extra path so you just just write file
03:26 - name with the exact uh you know spelling
03:30 - of the file name and then
03:34 - txt okay and then in the next line we
03:39 - can read from this file so for reading
03:44 - this file first of all I want to store
03:46 - it somewhere right so I will declare a
03:49 - string variable
03:51 - string line for example and now I'm
03:54 - going to create a while loop to read
03:58 - every line okay so while and inside this
04:03 - while loop we are going to read our file
04:05 - so just make one more bracket here and
04:08 - we are going to assign the value which
04:12 - we read from our file using this
04:16 - BR so line is equal to BR dot read line
04:23 - okay which will not be equal to null
04:28 - then we will will get the value of each
04:31 - line okay not equal to
04:34 - here so what we are going doing in this
04:37 - while loop in this while loop we are
04:41 - assigning the value of each line which
04:45 - we read from the file to this line
04:48 - variable and we are checking whether
04:51 - it's null or not and if it's null we are
04:54 - going out of the loop and if it's not
04:57 - null we are going to uh print this file
05:00 - so I'm just writing sis out and line
05:07 - okay which is this variable okay so I'm
05:10 - printing this line if this line is not
05:14 - null okay now once everything is done
05:19 - and you are done reading your file you
05:22 - need to close it so I'm going to use
05:25 - finally and if you are watching my
05:28 - videos you know that this finally is
05:31 - called when you want to perform some
05:35 - action whether your triack block throws
05:39 - some exception or not this code is going
05:43 - to happen definitely okay so we are
05:46 - going to use BR do close and this will
05:51 - close your file okay and in here you
05:55 - will see it's also going to throw some
05:59 - exception so we can surround it by TR
06:02 - catch block inside this finally block
06:05 - okay so just surround with tri catch
06:08 - block and it's going to surround it by
06:10 - Tri catch block so I think we are done
06:12 - with the code uh one more thing if you
06:15 - want you can just use this e do print
06:19 - stack trace and it's going to print your
06:23 - exception details whenever this code
06:26 - throws okay so let's try and run the
06:30 - program but before this let's save this
06:33 - and I'm going to run this program so run
06:35 - it and you can see it reads all the
06:40 - lines from the file so this was my text
06:43 - file which has seven lines and it's
06:45 - reading all the lines from the text file
06:48 - okay now if you are wondering uh you
06:52 - want to read a file which is not in your
06:56 - uh project folder right and you want to
06:59 - give some path to this file here how can
07:03 - you give it you can give it like this so
07:06 - just copy the path from here like this
07:11 - and paste it
07:12 - here and with the slash back slash and
07:17 - this will not work because Java will uh
07:22 - find it difficult to uh read this single
07:26 - black slash so if you want you can just
07:28 - use double backs slash instead of single
07:32 - back slash everywhere where this backs
07:34 - slash is used and this will give the
07:38 - path of your text
07:41 - file okay so you can uh give the path of
07:45 - your text file from anywhere from your
07:48 - computer like this okay now I'm going to
07:51 - save this and I'm going to run this
07:54 - program and it gives me the same result
07:57 - because it reads from the same file
08:00 - so in this way you can read a text file
08:03 - in Java using buffer reader and file
08:07 - reader classes I hope you have enjoyed
