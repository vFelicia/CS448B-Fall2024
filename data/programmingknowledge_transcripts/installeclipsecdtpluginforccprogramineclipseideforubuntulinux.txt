00:13 - system but by default if you want to
00:16 - program C or C++ program into your
00:21 - Eclipse platform it will not provide the
00:25 - default project configuration for C and
00:30 - C++ so you need to
00:33 - add C and C++ uh plugins to your eclipse
00:38 - in order to make and compile the
00:41 - program so I have already
00:45 - opened the eclipse
00:47 - platform and now I will show you how to
00:50 - add those Eclipse CNC Plus+ plug-in that
