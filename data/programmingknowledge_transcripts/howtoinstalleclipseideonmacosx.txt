00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:01 - you how you can download and install
00:03 - Eclipse IDE for Java development on your
00:07 - Mac operating system so let's get
00:10 - started so first of all you need to have
00:13 - Java jdk and Java runtime environment
00:17 - installed before installing Eclipse IDE
00:20 - on your Mac now in order to check
00:23 - whether the Java jdk and J is installed
00:26 - on your system the simple check is to go
00:30 - to the system preferences this is the
00:33 - icon for system preferences you can just
00:36 - open the system preferences and at the
00:39 - bottom you will be able to see this Java
00:42 - icon here and by this Java icon you will
00:46 - be able to know uh that Java is already
00:48 - installed on your system right so in my
00:53 - case Java is already installed but if in
00:56 - your case it's not installed then you
00:58 - need to install it and I have already
01:00 - made a video on how to install Java on
01:05 - your Mac operating system so if you
01:08 - don't have Java just you you just need
01:10 - to install it first and then come to
01:13 - this video and continue okay so just
01:16 - check if the Java is there and if the
01:19 - Java is already there then we are good
01:21 - to go now the next step is to open your
01:25 - favorite browser and search for download
01:29 - eclipse for Mac you just need to search
01:32 - that and the first link which will
01:35 - appear here is from
01:38 - www. eclipse.org g/d downloads okay so
01:44 - just click the first link and now uh
01:48 - they keep on changing the eclipse
01:50 - website so in uh your case it may be
01:53 - different in future so just keep an eye
01:57 - on that so what I'm going to do here
02:00 - here is I will just scroll down a little
02:03 - and I can see get Eclipse neon which is
02:05 - the newest version I think and I can see
02:09 - this download 64-bit button here but for
02:12 - now I'm not going to press this button
02:15 - I'm going to just press this link which
02:17 - says download packages okay so don't
02:21 - click this button which says download
02:23 - 64bit but click this button which says
02:26 - download packages and I'm going to just
02:29 - click this link which is going to open
02:31 - this kind of
02:32 - interface now uh this website is
02:35 - intelligent enough to recognize that you
02:38 - have Mac OS so it will automatically
02:42 - select Mac OS X for you but if it
02:45 - doesn't you can just choose it from here
02:48 - okay now you can just scroll a little
02:50 - bit down and you have few
02:53 - options the first option is Eclipse IDE
02:56 - for Java e developers and you can also
03:00 - see what are uh the tools which you will
03:03 - get for from this uh you know this IDE
03:08 - right second is the eclipse ID for Java
03:11 - developers and uh the description of all
03:14 - the tools are given here but if you
03:18 - download for example uh this uh Java IDE
03:22 - for Java e you don't have to worry about
03:26 - uh Java IDE for Java developers because
03:30 - in future you can always add this uh you
03:33 - know this support to your Eclipse IDE
03:37 - right so if by mistake you wanted to
03:40 - download uh this one and you downloaded
03:43 - this one in future you can easily extend
03:46 - your Eclipse IDE to support uh this one
03:49 - also or if you want to support C++ you
03:52 - can do that also in future so I'm going
03:56 - to just download this first version
03:59 - right and I have the 64bit operating
04:02 - system so I will just choose uh this uh
04:06 - and I'm going to just click this link
04:08 - which says 64bit right and now it's
04:11 - going to redirect me to the other page
04:14 - now in here you have the download button
04:17 - and if you can scroll down you have uh
04:22 - other uh you know mirrors also you can
04:25 - see IBM and some other mirrors for
04:28 - example spring by pivotal and other
04:31 - mirrors right so if you are you know uh
04:36 - comfortable with this uh mirror which is
04:39 - near to you then just click this
04:42 - otherwise you can choose uh other mirror
04:45 - from uh this link right let me uh just
04:48 - open it for just showing you that what
04:52 - are the other mirror which are available
04:55 - you can uh just choose for example uh
04:58 - Spring by pivot
05:00 - just click get
05:02 - it and then you can scroll down and you
05:06 - have the option for for example window
05:08 - which we don't want you have this Mac
05:11 - and then you have this option which says
05:14 - Eclipse IDE for Java e developers right
05:18 - so you can just click this and you will
05:21 - be good to go okay otherwise uh you can
05:24 - just simply click this download button
05:27 - and it's going to download uh that for
05:29 - you okay so I'm going to just click this
05:32 - button which is automatically shown to
05:37 - me and it says thank you for uh
05:40 - downloading Eclipse it's a
05:43 - tar.gz file so it's a zip file and it's
05:47 - going to take some time to download So
05:50 - for that time I'm going to just pause
05:53 - the video because maybe it's going to
05:55 - take a little while to download this uh
05:58 - zip file okay so once this download is
06:01 - complete we are going to go ahead and
06:05 - see how we can uh install eclipse and
06:08 - then we will also see how we can write
06:11 - our first hello world Java program with
06:15 - so now the download of this uh tar.gz
06:18 - file is complete in my case so I can
06:21 - just uh open it in finder wherever I
06:25 - have downloaded this file so this is the
06:27 - gz file and what I like to do is I like
06:30 - to move this uh gz file into my desired
06:35 - folder so what I'm going to do is I'm
06:37 - going to move it to the documents folder
06:41 - here and first of all I'm going to just
06:44 - minimize my browser and in the finder
06:46 - I'm going to make a new folder here so
06:49 - let me make a new folder and I'm going
06:52 - to name it as eclipse for example okay
06:56 - so this is my Eclipse folder and I will
06:59 - will uh just move this gz file into this
07:04 - Eclipse folder right and I'm going to go
07:06 - inside this Eclipse folder and then I'm
07:09 - going to double click on this uh ZIP
07:11 - file which is going to extract this file
07:14 - so just double click on this uh ZIP file
07:17 - and in some uh seconds this file will be
07:21 - extracted and then we will be able to
07:24 - see uh this Eclipse icon on the finder
07:29 - right so you can see this Eclipse icon
07:32 - you just need to drag it like this in
07:35 - order to see both the zip file and the
07:37 - eclipse icon so this is your executable
07:41 - icon which you can use to start Eclipse
07:44 - right some people like to move it to the
07:47 - application and it's totally fine so you
07:50 - can just uh select it and move it to the
07:53 - applications and uh start it from there
07:56 - or otherwise if you don't want it you
07:58 - can start your eclipse from here also
08:01 - right so I'm going to double click on
08:04 - this icon and for the first time uh When
08:08 - eclipse starts it's going to give you uh
08:12 - first of all maybe it will give you this
08:14 - warning which says eclipse is an
08:16 - application downloaded from internet are
08:18 - you sure you want to open it so we are
08:21 - sure that we want to open it so just
08:23 - click
08:24 - open and then it's going to start
08:27 - eclipse in your case so you you can see
08:30 - eclipse is uh starting and in The Next
08:33 - Step it's going to ask you to select our
08:35 - directory as our workspace workspace is
08:38 - a directory where all your uh Java
08:42 - project or Eclipse related project will
08:45 - be saved right so by default it's in
08:48 - your documents folder and it's fine for
08:51 - me but if you want uh this workspace to
08:55 - be somewhere else you can always browse
08:57 - the folder wherever you you want to have
09:00 - your workpace and then uh just choose
09:03 - that uh you know directory but for now
09:07 - I'm going to leave it as default and I'm
09:08 - going to click
09:10 - okay and now it's going to start the
09:13 - eclipse ID for me so now the Eclipse IDE
09:17 - has been uh started you can see uh it
09:21 - like this also uh you can maximize it or
09:23 - minimize it and resize it and uh for the
09:28 - first time it's going to look like this
09:30 - so you can see the review IDE
09:34 - configuration settings or create a new
09:37 - Java e web project or some other sample
09:41 - projects you can see you can also see
09:43 - the tutorial and samples but we are
09:45 - interested in creating our first Java
09:48 - project using Eclipse right so what I'm
09:51 - going to do is I'm going to go to this
09:54 - file option on the eclipse so just click
09:57 - this file option on Eclipse and then go
10:00 - to new so just click new and you will be
10:04 - able to see uh different kind of uh
10:07 - projects here so jpa projects and other
10:11 - kind of projects here so I'm going to
10:13 - just click uh for now
10:16 - project and now you will be able to see
10:19 - this option okay so once again I'm going
10:21 - to show you file and then new and I have
10:24 - selected the project option from here
10:27 - right and it's going to to give me this
10:29 - option and in here I'm going to choose
10:32 - Java so just choose this option which
10:35 - says Java and then choose the Java
10:37 - project okay so just choose the Java
10:39 - project from here and then you just need
10:42 - to click
10:46 - next and in here you can provide the
10:49 - name of your project so for example we
10:52 - are creating the hello world project so
10:55 - I'm going to uh name my project as hello
10:58 - world world and then in here by default
11:01 - it's going to recognize the Java JRE uh
11:05 - for you so in my case it's uh Java SE
11:09 - 1.8 in your case it can be different
11:12 - right so by default it's going to
11:14 - recognize it and uh if you want to
11:17 - choose some specific JRE you can just
11:20 - choose this option and choose uh your
11:23 - specific gr but for now I'm going to
11:25 - leave it as default now in the next
11:28 - category you have the project layout so
11:30 - it says use project folder as root for
11:33 - source and class files and other is
11:37 - create a separate folder for source and
11:40 - class files so I'm going to leave it as
11:42 - default which is create separate folders
11:44 - for source and class files right and uh
11:48 - the other thing is working set right now
11:51 - we are not so much interested in this
11:54 - but later we will do it right and then
11:57 - I'm going to click finish here and this
12:00 - is going to give you this kind of
12:01 - warning which says uh this kind of
12:04 - project is associated with Java
12:07 - perspective right so we have uh
12:10 - downloaded the Java e uh IDE and by
12:14 - default it's going to show us the Java e
12:17 - perspective but we are creating the Java
12:21 - uh project inside this Java e IDE so
12:24 - it's going to change the perspective uh
12:28 - that means the can feel of this ID to
12:30 - the Java uh perspective right so just
12:34 - click yes here and we are going to
12:36 - minimize this uh welcome screen so just
12:39 - minimize this welcome screen and when
12:41 - you minimize this uh welcome uh window
12:44 - then you will be able to uh see your
12:47 - hello world project right so just
12:50 - minimize your welcome uh window and now
12:53 - you will be able to see this uh hello
12:55 - world project now in our hello world
12:57 - there is a s Source folder and nothing
13:02 - inside it right so we need to create a
13:05 - class which is a main uh class for our
13:09 - hello world project right and you will
13:11 - be able to see JRE system libraries
13:14 - which helps you to uh compile your Java
13:18 - project so just select your Source
13:20 - folder and right click on it and uh
13:23 - generally first of all in our project we
13:27 - create some packages and then we create
13:29 - some classes but for Simplicity for now
13:32 - I'm going to just uh directly create a
13:34 - class so just uh go to new and then
13:38 - click class here and then you can uh
13:43 - give the name of your class right so for
13:46 - now I'm going to just name it as uh test
13:49 - for now and uh you can choose which kind
13:53 - of modifiers you want to use it because
13:56 - we are just testing our first Java
13:59 - project so I'm going to leave everything
14:01 - as default but this is important here so
14:05 - this asks you to um uh you know it's
14:09 - asking you which method stub you would
14:12 - like to create right so it's better to
14:17 - choose uh this uh first option which is
14:20 - going to directly create a public static
14:23 - wide method for you and you don't need
14:25 - to create the main method inside your
14:29 - class for you right so it's going to
14:31 - automatically create this uh method for
14:34 - you right so just select uh this option
14:38 - and then click finish and it's going to
14:42 - create this uh test. Java file for you
14:45 - and you can see it directly have the
14:48 - main method for you right so you already
14:53 - may have known that uh Java is all about
14:56 - classes so it has created the the class
14:59 - for us and this is the main entry point
15:02 - for your uh project right main method
15:05 - right and for example we want to just
15:08 - print hello world here so I can just
15:11 - write uh system dot out and then do
15:17 - print line so just write print Ln for
15:22 - print line and uh inside this uh bracket
15:27 - you just need to give the double quotes
15:30 - and inside the double quotes you can
15:32 - just write
15:34 - hello world okay so what this is going
15:39 - to do is it's going to print this hello
15:41 - world on the console when you run it now
15:45 - you would need to run your project right
15:48 - so you can uh click right click on your
15:52 - Java file so just right click on your
15:56 - test. Java file and then you will be
15:59 - able to see this option which says run
16:01 - as and you have two options here run on
16:05 - server and run as Java application so
16:08 - you need to run it as Java application
16:11 - so I'm going to choose the second
16:13 - option and then uh you just need to
16:16 - choose uh your uh Java file in my case
16:20 - it's only one so just select it and then
16:23 - click okay which is going to compile
16:27 - your program and you can see on the
16:29 - console it has printed hello world for
16:33 - us
16:34 - right now there is a shortcut for uh you
16:37 - know uh writing this code which is
16:41 - system out uh print line and which is
16:45 - you just need to write
16:47 - capital S and then y s and then o sis o
16:52 - and then just press control shift to get
16:58 - the you know intellisense so just press
17:00 - control shift and then uh press enter
17:04 - which is going to give you this method
17:07 - right and uh you can just uh write
17:11 - something again so for example hello
17:16 - world again right now for the first time
17:19 - when you compiled your program uh you
17:23 - just uh have right clicked and run it as
17:27 - uh you know Java application but once
17:30 - you have already run it you can just
17:33 - press this green button now to in order
17:36 - to uh you know compile and run it right
17:39 - but before that you just need to save it
17:41 - so just press the save button here and
17:45 - then click this green button so just
17:48 - press this green button and it will
17:50 - compile it and you can see the output
17:52 - here once again hello world and hello
17:55 - world again which is printed by these
17:57 - two lines so now you have successfully
18:00 - installed Eclipse IDE on your Mech
18:03 - operating system and you have
18:05 - successfully tested your first hello
18:07 - world Java project so I hope you've
18:10 - enjoyed this video please Rite comment
18:12 - and subscribe and bye for now
