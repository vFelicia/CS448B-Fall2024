00:00 - and then welcome back to the another
00:02 - video without tutorial Series so today
00:04 - uh we are seeing in inheritance in Java
00:07 - part two where wherein will be
00:09 - discussing each and every type of
00:12 - inheritance in Java and there are
00:14 - basically five types of five types are
00:16 - there single multi-level hierarchical uh
00:19 - multiple and hybrid and as you know
00:21 - multiple inheritance is not supported in
00:23 - Java
00:25 - uh we'll discuss why not it is not
00:27 - supported in Java in our later videos
00:29 - but for now we will see in this video
00:33 - particularly we are seeing into a single
00:36 - and multi-level inheritance in Java so
00:38 - let me just open my IDE
00:44 - foreign
00:57 - class here and Class B is innate in the
01:00 - property of the
01:01 - Class A okay so we'll see when a short
01:06 - example of single level inheritance I
01:08 - will just write a new class
01:11 - inheritance
01:14 - let me increase the font size
01:18 - I will import the main main method
01:21 - and now
01:25 - I will declare one method inside this
01:30 - uh for that before that I will create
01:32 - one class called
01:35 - animal
01:40 - inside this I will declare one method
01:43 - name is eight and this method is not
01:47 - accepting any parameters any return type
01:49 - is also voiled that's why it is not
01:51 - returning anything else
01:53 - I will just print
01:56 - eating
01:59 - now I will create another class
02:07 - name as dog
02:09 - and as we discussed in our early video
02:12 - for implementing The Inheritance we use
02:15 - the keyword extends I will write extends
02:18 - animal
02:22 - so here uh dog is a subclass or the
02:25 - child class and the animal is the parent
02:27 - class or the superclass okay and the dog
02:31 - classes in editing the properties which
02:33 - are properties of the animal class now I
02:36 - will create one method here
02:38 - name as bark
02:42 - and I will just simply print
02:45 - marking
02:48 - okay now inside my main class that is
02:52 - the inheritance class and inside my main
02:54 - method I will create
02:57 - the object of the doc class
03:00 - let me call it as dog1
03:05 - is equals to new dog
03:08 - okay and I have created the object of
03:11 - the glass and I will write D dot
03:14 - bark
03:16 - let's take the dog one dot work
03:19 - and
03:21 - dog1.8
03:25 - sorry and now if I run this class
03:32 - um
03:34 - here you can see uh bulking and eating
03:36 - is getting printed on the console
03:37 - because uh in animal class that is
03:40 - apparent parent class we have written
03:41 - the word method avoid eat method uh
03:44 - which which is printing eating on the
03:47 - console and inside the dog we have a
03:50 - bark method and which is printing
03:52 - working and using the object of the doc
03:55 - class that is Doc one we are just
03:58 - calling the method bark and eat so here
04:01 - you can see we are we have written the
04:03 - implementation part of the eat method
04:04 - inside the animal class that is the
04:06 - parent class and still we are using it
04:09 - uh by the creating the object of the
04:11 - dark class because we have inherited the
04:14 - properties of the animal class inside
04:15 - the doc class that's why
04:18 - so this is the simple example of this uh
04:21 - single level in inheritance
04:24 - and next we have multi-level inheritance
04:26 - so
04:28 - let me just go here and I will
04:32 - create one another class name as
04:36 - multi level
04:39 - inheritance
04:42 - now let me just increase the font size
04:46 - we'll write my main method
04:48 - and as you can see here multi-level
04:52 - inheritance is nothing but multiple
04:54 - classes are in inheriting uh the
04:56 - properties as you can see here uh Class
04:59 - C is inheriting the properties of the
05:01 - Class B and Class B is generating the
05:03 - properties of Class A okay so we will
05:05 - Implement try to implement this inside
05:07 - our code
05:09 - so I will take the same example as we
05:11 - have taken for the single single level
05:13 - inheritance
05:15 - uh I will just copy this animal class
05:19 - inside
05:21 - this class
05:27 - k y is throwing error
05:30 - degree class found in acha oh sorry we
05:34 - have already written the cinema class
05:36 - over here
05:38 - and let me just comment this out
05:41 - so that IntelliJ IDEA will not throw the
05:44 - errors
05:46 - okay here we have
05:49 - this animal class and one dog class is
05:53 - also I require
05:56 - and I will just copy this doc class also
06:05 - okay and
06:07 - I will require another
06:09 - class so that I can
06:12 - have three classes which I need
06:15 - inheriting the properties
06:17 - of animal class and I will write
06:21 - new class class name and let's suppose
06:24 - baby dog
06:26 - and which is
06:29 - inheriting the properties of
06:33 - dog
06:37 - and it has its own method known as void
06:42 - well let's suppose whip
06:45 - and I will just simply print
06:49 - whipping
06:51 - okay here you can see uh one parent
06:54 - class is their NM animal a neat method
06:56 - is there and dog is extending the
06:58 - extending the animal class and baby dog
07:01 - is extending the doc class so here here
07:05 - you can see one class in editing the
07:08 - another class and another that class is
07:10 - also in editing the properties of the
07:11 - main main parent class
07:13 - okay so simply we will create the object
07:17 - of the Davido class let's suppose dog
07:20 - one
07:23 - is equal to new baby dog
07:27 - okay and now if I write
07:31 - dog1 Dot
07:34 - whip
07:36 - whip is the method I guess this is what
07:40 - sorry I have written wrong here
07:43 - now it's okay uh web
07:47 - and dog one dot
07:50 - bark
07:53 - doggo and Dot
07:55 - it
07:57 - now if I run this class
08:00 - now it should output should be whipping
08:03 - uh barking and eating here you can see
08:05 - now
08:07 - now in hierarchical and uh
08:10 - hybrid we will discuss in the next video
08:13 - and we will also discuss why multiple
08:15 - units is not supported in Java thank you
08:17 - for watching this video
