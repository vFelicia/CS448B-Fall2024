00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - register tool for beginners in this
00:04 - video we will learn how to use Redis
00:06 - lists so first of all what are or where
00:09 - is list so ready
00:12 - lists are simply lists of strings sorted
00:16 - by their insertion order right so as I
00:21 - already said that a ready list is
00:23 - complete list of string which are sorted
00:26 - by their insertion order so our lift
00:28 - would have a head on the top and tail on
00:33 - the bottom right now in this list we can
00:37 - insert any element from the top also and
00:40 - from the bottom also right so element
00:44 - can be inserted to a list from the top
00:47 - or from the bottom now sometimes you see
00:51 - lists in a horizontal way right not in a
00:56 - vertical way but on a horizontal way
00:59 - right now if you see a list in a
01:02 - horizontal way your head will be on the
01:06 - left hand side right so your head will
01:09 - be on the left hand side and your tail
01:12 - will be on the right hand side right so
01:15 - Radice have some come on
01:18 - for example ll push l.push means the
01:23 - left push that means we want to push an
01:26 - element from the head right left and
01:29 - head are same in the case of lists so
01:35 - this is how already
01:36 - let's work it's simply a list with the
01:40 - insertion order now let's see how we can
01:44 - use lists in Redis so I am going to
01:47 - start a terminal I have already started
01:49 - my Redis server so I am going to just
01:52 - start the Redis see Li here and then
01:55 - press ENTER and I want to show you one
01:59 - more Redis command which is a ready CLI
02:02 - command and I thought this would be
02:04 - interesting to you so I'm going to open
02:07 - our next terminal and here also I will
02:10 - just give already CLI c'mon
02:13 - and I will give an argument here so I
02:16 - will just give monitor command yeah okay
02:19 - so monitor so ready see Ally monitor and
02:23 - what this monitor is going to do is is
02:26 - going to monitor all the commands which
02:28 - you are executing from your CLI so for
02:31 - example let me give a keys Astrix come
02:36 - on here right and now you can see it's
02:39 - showing us that we have given this
02:44 - command keys Asterix at this time this
02:47 - is a time stamp at which this command is
02:51 - given okay so this is the time stamp at
02:54 - which this command is given and this is
02:56 - the command which we have given right so
02:59 - let's do flush all here and then press
03:05 - ENTER and you can see this flush all
03:09 - command is printed here so this is kind
03:12 - of a monitor right so this is going to
03:15 - monitor what are the commands you are
03:18 - giving to your already so ok so let's
03:23 - start with the Redis lists so first of
03:27 - all how we can create our Redis list so
03:31 - you can create a restless by just giving
03:36 - this command
03:36 - you just need to give L push right so L
03:41 - push means left push that means we want
03:44 - to insert an element from the top right
03:48 - from the head okay and then we just need
03:51 - to give any key here for example key
03:55 - here I am going to give num for numbers
03:58 - right and the first key I want to insert
04:01 - here will be for example 1 okay so first
04:05 - number right you can even insert
04:08 - multiple values here for this key for
04:12 - this list for example 2 3 & 4 ok and
04:16 - then press enter and these four elements
04:20 - are inserted to the list in this order
04:25 - right now
04:26 - to see all the values in the list you
04:30 - use L range command so just use L range
04:35 - and then the name of the key for example
04:38 - number in our case and then you give the
04:41 - you know start and stop value for the
04:45 - range now already list index start from
04:47 - zero so for example starting value we
04:49 - can give zero here and let's say we want
04:53 - to just see the values in the list from
04:56 - zero to ten
04:57 - okay and then press Enter it shows us
05:01 - these values from four three two and one
05:07 - right so because we were pushing the
05:10 - values from the top we have pushed one
05:14 - first right so it will be pushed from
05:18 - the top one and then we have pushed two
05:21 - so the top value will become two now
05:24 - when we push two here and that's why
05:27 - it's a reverse order of numbers right so
05:31 - first you have pushed one and then we
05:34 - have pushed two at the top and then we
05:36 - have pushed three at the top and at the
05:38 - last we have pushed for at the top so
05:41 - that's why the number four is at the top
05:44 - of the list and number one is at the
05:46 - bottom of the list right now if we want
05:50 - to push number five on the top we can
05:53 - just do L push here so just do L push
05:58 - and the key name and then for example I
06:02 - will do number five here right and then
06:04 - press ENTER and once again I will do L
06:07 - range you can see five is at the top now
06:10 - if you want to remove the value from the
06:12 - top you give the L pop come on okay so L
06:17 - pop command is going to remove the value
06:20 - from the left hand side left hand side
06:23 - means from the top okay so L PAP pop is
06:27 - going to pop the value from the top and
06:29 - in this case our key is none and you can
06:32 - see it has popped five from the top that
06:35 - means our list is now up to four okay so
06:39 - let's give the same
06:40 - and range 0 to 10 now our list is 1 2 3
06:44 - 4 because we have removed 5 from the top
06:47 - ok let me clear the terminal and then
06:52 - I'm going to show you one more command
06:54 - so let's start with the L range so we
06:57 - have right now four elements in the list
07:00 - now there is a our push command and our
07:04 - pop command also ok so when you do our
07:08 - push that means right push that means
07:12 - from the bottom you are pushing some
07:15 - numbers right so from the bottom for
07:17 - example I want to push the value v Heer
07:20 - okay first of all I just need to give
07:23 - the key a name and then from the bottom
07:26 - I want to push the number 5 and then
07:28 - press ENTER and I will do L range 1 0 so
07:31 - again you can see this value goes at the
07:35 - bottom 5 goes at the bottom because we
07:37 - have our push we have used this command
07:40 - our push our push means from the bottom
07:44 - proof push from the bottom right from
07:46 - the right hand side of the list ok
07:49 - that's why this 5 goes at the bottom ok
07:52 - once again let's do this our push and
07:56 - let's push fix at the bottom and once
08:00 - again
08:00 - do l range I give you and you can see in
08:03 - the list you have the 6 at the bottom so
08:07 - in red if this list is sorted by the
08:10 - insertion order right if you push from
08:13 - the right it will go at the bottom and
08:16 - if you push from the left it will go at
08:19 - the top and for left push you use L push
08:23 - and for right push you use our push now
08:27 - as we have seen in the case of L pop al
08:29 - pop is going to pop the value from the
08:32 - top our pop is going to pop the value
08:35 - from the bottom so just cave our pop
08:38 - here and then the key name and it's
08:41 - going to pop 6 from the list which is
08:44 - from the bottom right let's do L range
08:47 - command once again and now you can see 6
08:50 - is gone from the list in a same way less
08:53 - to our
08:54 - once again and now five is gone from the
08:58 - list so once again let's do L range and
09:01 - now we have a list of four numbers right
09:05 - let me clear the terminal here now let's
09:07 - give L range command once again and now
09:10 - there is a command called
09:12 - L Len okay this means left length and
09:16 - name of the key for example it's going
09:19 - to give you the length of the list in
09:22 - our case this length is equal to the
09:25 - number of element in the list
09:27 - okay so L Len is for knowing the length
09:31 - of the list now for example if you want
09:34 - to get some value at some index you just
09:37 - do L index command okay and then the
09:41 - name of the key and the index so index
09:44 - start from zero so zero one two three
09:48 - okay so for example we want to get
09:52 - number two here at index 3 so we will
09:55 - just say index three okay and it's going
09:59 - to give you the number one because index
10:02 - starts from zero so zero one two and
10:05 - three so index 3 is the value 1 here
10:08 - okay let's do index zero here and it's
10:12 - going to give us the value 4 now there
10:15 - is one more command called L set so you
10:17 - can use as set and the key name and then
10:22 - you can give the index at which you want
10:24 - to insert a value right so for example I
10:28 - want to insert the value add with the
10:30 - very top so the very top is the index 0
10:34 - right and then the value itself so I
10:37 - want to insert the value at the 0th
10:40 - index and the value is 5 and then when I
10:43 - just press ENTER it says ok and when I
10:46 - do L range you can see at the top at the
10:51 - 0th index this value 4 is replaced by
10:55 - value 5 right so the size of the list
10:59 - remains the same but the value is
11:02 - replaced at the residual 0th index and
11:05 - now the new value
11:07 - is five here now let me push some more
11:10 - values here so L Porsche you can do are
11:13 - push also wherever you want so L push
11:17 - num and for example I want to push
11:21 - number six here and then number seven
11:24 - and number eight here okay and let's do
11:27 - L range and you can see all the values
11:30 - are here right now sometimes you don't
11:34 - know the range or the length of your
11:39 - list so for example you just to zero to
11:42 - three here and it's going to just give
11:45 - you zero to three values right now if
11:48 - you don't know the length of your list
11:51 - you can give L range and then zero to
11:55 - minus one so let's give this command and
11:58 - you can see it gives all the elements in
12:01 - the list so when you do L range the key
12:05 - name zero to minus one is going to give
12:08 - you all the element in the list right
12:11 - this was giving the values from zero to
12:15 - tenth index so if our list is of length
12:18 - 20 this is going to give you only ten
12:22 - values zero to ten right but this is
12:25 - going to give you all the twenty values
12:27 - if you your list length is 20 now let me
12:30 - clear this terminal and let's go to the
12:35 - next command so now the next command is
12:38 - L push X and that means L push if the
12:44 - key exists okay so the Left push if the
12:47 - key exists so we know that we have
12:50 - created a lift with the key num right so
12:55 - let's - first of all this L range right
12:58 - and then we will give this L push X okay
13:04 - and this means that insert to this list
13:08 - for example this key exists already so
13:13 - insert to the list if this key already
13:15 - exists which you are providing here okay
13:17 - and this is the left force so we want to
13:21 - push
13:21 - more value to the top so let's portion 9
13:25 - at the top and because this key num
13:28 - exists
13:29 - this command is successful right so
13:32 - let's do L range once again and this key
13:35 - is inserted at the top let's say we do
13:39 - ll push X for a key which does not exist
13:43 - for example let's say we have a key for
13:48 - subjects so let's say the key is sub
13:51 - here and we want to push some keys for
13:54 - example once again 1 2 3 4 5 ok but this
14:01 - key doesn't exist right and then when we
14:04 - press ENTER it returns zero because this
14:08 - command is not successful because this
14:11 - command checks whether this key exists
14:15 - or not and if this key exists then it's
14:18 - it's pushing these values on the top
14:22 - right but because this key does not
14:25 - exist this command fails and there is no
14:28 - list will be created now the next amount
14:31 - I want to show here is L insert before
14:35 - or after so you just do L insert here
14:39 - and then the key name for example num
14:42 - here and you have the option before or
14:46 - after
14:46 - so before after are the key word for
14:48 - example I use the key word before here
14:52 - so I am going to just write before and
14:55 - the pivot name pivot name is this
15:00 - element okay so I want to insert the
15:04 - value before two for example
15:07 - okay so let me write to here and the
15:12 - value is this time for example 55 okay
15:17 - so L insert the key name and you can use
15:22 - this keyword before or after here and
15:24 - then the pivot and then the value once
15:28 - again I do press ENTER and you can see
15:31 - now the list size is 9 and when I
15:35 - - Al range zero to minus 1 you can see
15:39 - this 55 is inserted before - right
15:44 - before - is the index from the left
15:48 - right because we have done the L insert
15:51 - okay so before 2 is inserted 55 right
15:56 - you can do after also so for example I
16:00 - want to insert after 3 ok let's insert
16:05 - after 4 so after 5 we want to insert the
16:12 - value for you can see after 5 there is 3
16:16 - right so after 5 there is a value 3 and
16:19 - we want to insert 4 value for here and
16:22 - now our list is of size 10 and you can
16:27 - see now after 5 comes for okay and above
16:32 - 3 comes for okay so this L insert is
16:36 - used to insert the value before or after
16:40 - some value so these are some of the
16:43 - frequently used command with ready list
