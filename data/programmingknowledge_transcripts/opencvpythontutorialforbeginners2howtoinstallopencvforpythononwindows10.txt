00:00 - hey guys welcome in the next video on
00:02 - open CV tutorials for beginners using
00:04 - Python in this video I'm going to show
00:07 - you how you can install OpenCV for
00:09 - python on your Windows operating system
00:13 - so obviously you need to install Python
00:16 - on your Windows operating system in
00:18 - order to install OpenCV for python so
00:21 - first of all I'm going to show you how
00:23 - you can install Python on your Windows
00:25 - operating system and then we will see
00:27 - how to install OpenCV using Python now
00:32 - if you have already installed Python on
00:34 - your Windows operating system
00:35 - you can skip about five minutes of this
00:38 - video and go directly to the point where
00:42 - I am going to show you how you can
00:45 - install OpenCV for python so let's get
00:49 - started so first of all open your
00:51 - favorite browser on your Windows 10
00:52 - operating system and then search for
00:54 - Python and the first link which will
00:56 - appear here will be from python.org e so
00:59 - we are going to click on that link and
01:00 - once this Python Waddy website is open
01:03 - you just need to scroll down a little
01:05 - until you see this downloads section and
01:08 - you can see at the time of making this
01:10 - video python 3.7.0 is the latest version
01:14 - of python available so we are going to
01:16 - click on this link which says python
01:18 - 3.7.0 and you will be redirected to this
01:21 - page which says python 3.7.0 and now i'm
01:24 - going to scroll down until i see the
01:27 - files here and you will see there are
01:29 - various kinds of installer available
01:31 - here we are going to install the python
01:33 - using the executable installer so we are
01:36 - going to choose this option which says
01:37 - windows x86 - 64 executable installer
01:42 - and now I will wait for this executable
01:44 - to be downloaded and once this
01:46 - executable is downloaded you just need
01:48 - to click on this Exe file and I'm going
01:51 - to minimize the browser here so you can
01:53 - see pythons 3.7.0 setup window has been
01:56 - started and on the first window you will
01:58 - see two options here one is Install Now
02:01 - and other is customized installation so
02:05 - what we are going to choose is this
02:07 - option which says customize installation
02:09 - because when you choose this Install Now
02:12 - option
02:13 - we'll be installed at this part which I
02:16 - don't want to use you can see it's a
02:19 - long path which I don't want to remember
02:21 - so I will use this option which says
02:25 - customize installation and I will also
02:27 - check this option which says add Python
02:29 - 3.72 path so now let's click on
02:32 - customize installation and next you will
02:34 - see this optional feature window and you
02:37 - can see there are some optional feature
02:39 - which this Python installer will install
02:41 - for example documentation pip it will
02:45 - install which is a Python package
02:46 - manager Idol IDE Python test suit and
02:50 - other feature it's going to install so
02:52 - I'm going to leave everything as default
02:54 - and then I'm going to click Next and now
02:56 - this next window will open which says
02:58 - advanced option here I'm going to check
03:01 - this option which says install for all
03:03 - users and I'm going to leave other
03:06 - checkboxes as checked and then you will
03:09 - see this section here which says
03:10 - customize install location so I want to
03:13 - install Python on my C directory so what
03:15 - I'm going to do is I'm going to open the
03:17 - Windows Explorer and I'm going to go to
03:19 - the C directory here and once the C
03:23 - directory is open I'm going to right
03:24 - click here and I'm going to create a new
03:26 - directory and I'm going to name this a
03:28 - directory as Python and then I'm going
03:30 - to press enter and this part I'm going
03:34 - to give here in the customize install
03:36 - location so I'm going to just give this
03:38 - part which says C colon slash Python and
03:42 - then backslash Python 3 7 3 7 here means
03:47 - that we are going to install 3.7 version
03:50 - of Python
03:51 - so now python will be installed at this
03:52 - location on my computer and then i'm
03:55 - going to click on the install button
03:56 - here and then you will see the
03:58 - installation will start and it will be
04:00 - finished in a few seconds so just wait
04:02 - for the installation to complete and
04:03 - after some time i can see this message
04:05 - which say setup was successful so i'm
04:07 - going to click on this close button
04:08 - which is going to close this installer
04:11 - so now in order to check whether python
04:13 - is installed on our windows operating
04:14 - system or not we are going to search for
04:17 - python here and you will see a few
04:19 - options here one is this python 3.7
04:23 - terminal other is idle
04:27 - so first of all we are going to click on
04:28 - this option which says Python 3.7 64-bit
04:31 - which is going to open this kind of
04:34 - terminal so this is a Python terminal
04:36 - and here we can for example print
04:39 - something so I'm going to just write
04:40 - print and in the parenthesis and in
04:43 - between the double quotes I can just
04:45 - write hello world and then press Enter
04:48 - which is going to in return print hello
04:51 - world
04:52 - that means Python 3.7 terminal is
04:55 - working so I'm going to close this
04:56 - terminal now and once again I'm going to
04:58 - search for Python here and this time I'm
05:01 - going to select this option which says
05:02 - idle ok so just select this option which
05:05 - says idle and in the parenthesis Python
05:08 - 3.7 64 bit so this idle is an IDE which
05:12 - comes with Python installation at the
05:15 - time of installation we have chosen this
05:16 - option to install idle that's why we can
05:19 - see this option here and also this is an
05:22 - interactive shell so you can once again
05:23 - write a print and inside the parentheses
05:26 - you can just write for example once
05:29 - again hello world and then press ENTER
05:32 - and it's going to give you this kind of
05:34 - output here
05:35 - so now python interactive shell is
05:37 - working and idle ide is also working so
05:40 - I'm going to close this idle IDE and now
05:43 - I want to check whether Python is
05:44 - working using my command prompt or not
05:47 - so I'm going to right click on this
05:49 - Windows button and then I'm going to
05:52 - click on command prompt and here I'm
05:54 - going to first of all write Python and
05:57 - then press ENTER and you can see this
05:59 - python option is working now even on
06:03 - your command prompt right so here also
06:05 - you can just write print and inside the
06:08 - parenthesis you can just print hello
06:11 - world and then press ENTER and it prints
06:14 - hello world in return
06:19 - now once python is installed on your
06:23 - Windows 10 operating system we are going
06:25 - to install OpenCV using pip now pip is
06:29 - automatically installed on your Windows
06:32 - operating system with the Python
06:34 - installation so you don't need to
06:37 - separately install pip on your Windows
06:39 - operating system it comes automatically
06:42 - with your Python installation so to
06:45 - verify this first of all I'm going to
06:48 - check the python version so you can just
06:50 - give this command python - - version and
06:55 - then you can check the pip version so
06:58 - you can just give this command pip - -
07:01 - version so just give this command and
07:05 - it's going to give you the version of
07:07 - pip which is installed on your Windows
07:09 - operating system so to install OpenCV
07:12 - using pips you just need to give this
07:14 - command pip install open CV - Python and
07:20 - I'm going to press ENTER so you can see
07:22 - open CV related packages are downloading
07:26 - now so now open CV Python package is
07:29 - installed using pip on my Windows
07:31 - operating system now you will observe
07:33 - one more thing here and that is numpy
07:36 - package will be automatically installed
07:39 - with your OpenCV python package so now
07:43 - once open CV python package is installed
07:45 - we can verify it by just opening our
07:49 - Python shell so I'm going to just give
07:52 - python command to open the Python shell
07:54 - and then here I'm going to just write
07:58 - import CV - okay so once you give this
08:03 - command it should not give you any error
08:06 - and if this import gives you error that
08:09 - means open CV is not correctly installed
08:11 - on your operating system
08:14 - now after importing you can just check
08:16 - the version of open CV which you have
08:18 - installed using C v2 dot underscore
08:23 - underscore version underscore underscore
08:26 - and then press ENTER and it's going to
08:29 - give you the version of open CV which is
08:31 - installed on your opera
08:33 - system and in our case this is for point
08:36 - zero point zero at the time of making
08:38 - this video now you can check the same by
08:41 - writing your code inside a Python file
08:46 - also so here I have opened my Visual
08:49 - Studio code editor and I have already
08:51 - created sample dot py file and here also
08:55 - I'm going to import the CV to package
08:59 - first of all and then I'm going to print
09:02 - the version of CV to using this print
09:05 - statement so I'm going to just write C
09:07 - v2 dot underscore underscore version
09:11 - underscore underscore and then save this
09:15 - script and to open the terminal inside
09:17 - Visual Studio code you can just press
09:20 - control shift P and then type toggle
09:24 - integrated terminal so just type toggle
09:26 - integrated terminal and then click on
09:28 - this first option which says toggle
09:30 - integrated terminal this is going to
09:33 - open the terminal inside your Visual
09:36 - Studio code editor so here you can run
09:38 - your python script using the python
09:41 - command so python and then name of the
09:44 - script which is sample dot py in my case
09:46 - and then press enter and it's also going
09:49 - to give you the version of OpenCV which
09:51 - is installed on your operating system so
09:54 - this is how you can install OpenCV for
09:57 - python on your Windows operating system
09:59 - I hope you've enjoyed this video and I
10:02 - will see you in the next video
10:11 - you
