00:01 - hello everyone
00:02 - welcome to this course
00:04 - altrex for beginners in this course we
00:06 - would be discussing all about a tool
00:09 - called altrix we would be learning its
00:12 - practical concepts and we would be also
00:14 - seeing that why is it so useful
00:17 - also i would be showing you the
00:18 - procedure through which you can use it
00:20 - into your day to day lives
00:22 - also we would be seeing that what
00:24 - difference it is going to make and how
00:26 - it is going to prove useful to us
00:29 - so in this video we are going to
00:31 - introduce ourselves to this particular
00:33 - tool and discuss about its features so
00:36 - that you can decide whether to go for
00:37 - this course or not
00:39 - so this is the first video introduction
00:41 - to alteryx
00:43 - let us start by understanding that what
00:46 - actually is ultrix so alteryx is a tool
00:49 - that is primarily used for data cleaning
00:52 - so whenever you have a data set with you
00:55 - and you want to clean it then ninety
00:57 - percent of the task of data cleaning can
00:59 - be done automatically through ultrix
01:02 - apart from this the different features
01:05 - provided by alteryx are all combined
01:07 - into this slide
01:08 - altryx is not just only a data cleaning
01:11 - tool but it is also a predictive
01:13 - analysis tool
01:14 - predictive analysis means that a variety
01:17 - of statistical techniques
01:19 - are combined from like data mining
01:21 - predictive modeling and machine learning
01:24 - which will analyze the historical trends
01:26 - and will make predictions about the
01:28 - future
01:29 - so for this purpose we can use alteryx
01:32 - if you want spatial analysis that is
01:35 - when you want to analyze the locations
01:37 - uh relationships or basically the
01:40 - proximities in a geospatial data to
01:43 - extract the insights
01:45 - then you can use the stool ultrix altex
01:48 - also acts as an etl tool that means to
01:50 - extract transform and load
01:53 - the general procedure of copying the
01:55 - data from one source to destination
01:58 - which can then be used to visualize the
02:01 - data or represent it in a completely
02:03 - different format
02:04 - altryx also acts as a data blending tool
02:07 - that means you can get a data from the
02:09 - different sources and then merge it into
02:12 - a single data warehouse or basically a
02:14 - data set
02:16 - and then analyze it
02:18 - last but not the least ultra excesses
02:20 - says service analysis tool now what is
02:23 - this means cell service analysis tool so
02:26 - once you have created something called a
02:28 - workflow in ultrix now you do not need
02:31 - to create it again and again what you
02:33 - can do is simply combine the alteryx to
02:36 - just
02:37 - follow the same procedures that you have
02:39 - done up till now and ultrix would
02:41 - automatically do the same tasks for you
02:43 - means you can just create the workflow
02:45 - once and use it as many times as you
02:47 - want there is no limit on um using it
02:51 - you can create once used many times
02:54 - now let us understand that why should we
02:56 - use alteryx so these are some of the
02:59 - features that helps us to understand
03:01 - that why alteryx is so much important
03:03 - for us first of all no coding knowledge
03:06 - is needed for this tool it has a very
03:08 - simple interface if you have a knowledge
03:11 - of excel and some of the features of
03:13 - excel like pivot tables or vlookup then
03:16 - you can simply use eltrix for all of
03:19 - your needs so that is why if you do not
03:21 - have a strong coding background then you
03:23 - can use alteryx as well
03:26 - it has a very simple drag and drop
03:28 - interface all of the filters or all of
03:30 - the features all of the tools that you
03:32 - want to use that you can simply just
03:35 - drag and drop suppose you want to sort
03:36 - the data so we have a sorting tool
03:38 - provided to us in altrix all you need to
03:40 - do is drag it and drop it on your
03:42 - dataset and the data side would be
03:43 - sorted if you want to filter it
03:45 - according to particular criteria
03:46 - similarly you can just drag the filter
03:48 - tool and drop it over there and that
03:50 - particular filter would be applied
03:53 - it is compatible with different data
03:55 - sources around uh 80 plus data sources
03:58 - are supported by alteryx that means you
04:01 - can use the data set which is in any
04:03 - format it could be in the form of an
04:05 - excel file a csv file or basically a
04:08 - semi-structured or unstructured json
04:11 - file as well you can simply use it in
04:14 - ultrix import it in altrics and actually
04:17 - analyze it using the tool
04:19 - because it supports a variety of data
04:21 - sources
04:22 - the integration with the power bi tools
04:26 - with the business intelligence tools
04:28 - like power bi tableau qlik sense is also
04:31 - provided to irig so once you have
04:33 - created some of the insights in those
04:34 - tools you can easily interact
04:37 - with
04:38 - that report or with that dashboard using
04:41 - altrix you can actually make a
04:43 - connection between those two and get a
04:45 - better insight of your data
04:48 - now uh
04:50 - the last but not the least it is
04:52 - actually the most important feature of
04:54 - alteryx that is it provides automation
04:56 - of the manual tasks so all the tasks
04:58 - that you have been doing manually up
05:00 - till now you can actually automate them
05:02 - with the help of alteryx and once you
05:05 - have automated those tasks and once the
05:07 - workflow is created you do not have to
05:08 - create it again and again simply you can
05:10 - reuse it as many times as you want
05:14 - now let us take a look at some of the
05:16 - features of alteryx and these are the
05:17 - same features that make it so special
05:21 - so first of all is that it supports 80
05:23 - plus data sources as we have already
05:25 - discussed the data files that you are
05:28 - using in altrix can be in any format
05:30 - like a csv file an excel file json file
05:32 - xml file html file any type of a file if
05:36 - it contains data it is supported by altx
05:39 - you can simply just use it you can
05:41 - import it in address and then
05:43 - uh analyze it
05:45 - one more thing this number of the data
05:48 - sources is actually increasing as new
05:50 - versions of altrix are being released so
05:53 - uh even if your uh
05:56 - data source is not compatible right now
05:58 - it might come in the future
06:00 - it supports all the formats of data like
06:02 - it may be a structured data in the form
06:04 - of a sequel it could be semi-structured
06:06 - or unstructured data in the form of a
06:07 - json files so whatever the format of the
06:10 - data is it is supported by altrix you
06:13 - don't have to worry about the data
06:15 - format if it is not in a tabular format
06:17 - or so
06:18 - there are 260 plus automation tools that
06:21 - are available for analytics in altrix
06:24 - now these automation tools not only
06:26 - reduce our tasks but also make the
06:29 - analysis and the data cleaning process
06:31 - very smooth like you want to filter out
06:33 - some records you want to sort out some
06:34 - records all you have to do is just use
06:36 - these automation tools through a simple
06:39 - drag and drop and use them on your data
06:41 - set and just see that how it works you
06:44 - do not need to
06:45 - perform complex procedures you do not
06:47 - need any kind of according knowledge for
06:49 - this purpose just drag and drop
06:52 - report creation is supported from
06:54 - different data sources that means uh the
06:57 - different bi tools or the different data
06:59 - sources you can create reports using
07:01 - those like once you have created a
07:03 - report or a workflow in altrix then uh
07:06 - you can actually use the different data
07:08 - sources for different sorts of
07:09 - visualizations to be combined together
07:11 - in a single report so this is one of the
07:14 - best features supported by ultrix
07:17 - now once you have created the report and
07:18 - you want to share it with uh your team
07:20 - or with a different set of people then
07:22 - you can export this report in the
07:25 - different file formats that are
07:26 - supported by altrics
07:28 - like pdf excel file or many more
07:31 - uh and also with the upcoming versions
07:34 - this number of uh file formats are
07:36 - supported by address is also increasing
07:39 - finally altric supports the reusable
07:42 - workflows what does it means it means
07:44 - that once you have created a workflow
07:46 - you can reuse it as many times as you
07:48 - want you do not need to just perform
07:50 - those same steps again and again and
07:52 - again you can just simply reuse the
07:54 - workflow that you have already created
07:56 - so this is about the features of alteryx
07:59 - and
08:00 - now uh since we know about the basics of
08:03 - altrix and why is it so useful let us
08:06 - see that how can we actually install
08:09 - alteryx into our systems so it is a paid
08:12 - tool but you can get a trial version of
08:15 - 14 days for yourself
08:17 - so we would be just using that trial
08:19 - version only right now okay so for this
08:22 - what you need to do is just basically
08:24 - google ultrix
08:27 - here you will see this website official
08:29 - website www.altrex.com
08:32 - in this official website you need to go
08:34 - to this products option
08:36 - so once this products option is open you
08:38 - will see that these are these different
08:40 - products
08:42 - that are available like designer server
08:44 - intelligence suite etc from this we need
08:46 - to go with this designer product because
08:48 - it is suitable for individuals so let's
08:51 - just click on this learn more option
08:53 - once you click on this learn more option
08:55 - you will go to this home page of this
08:57 - particular product which is ultrex
08:59 - designer
09:00 - product
09:01 - you can just
09:03 - read all about it the system
09:05 - requirements and the features of this
09:06 - particular product
09:08 - then if you want to install it you can
09:10 - just click on start free trial if you
09:12 - want to watch a demo you can just go
09:14 - with the remove video let's just click
09:16 - on start free trial
09:18 - now what will it do is
09:20 - it will ask you if you are a new user or
09:23 - if you are an existing user or whatever
09:26 - so i'm a new user let's just click on a
09:28 - new user download now button now what
09:31 - will you do is it will ask you all of
09:33 - these details so you what you need to do
09:36 - is just actually provide all these
09:38 - details and once you have provided these
09:40 - details you can click on confirm once
09:42 - you will click on confirm the
09:44 - downloading process for an exe file will
09:47 - start for you
09:48 - so uh that's it that's the simple
09:51 - process for downloading this particular
09:53 - setup in the previous video we have
09:56 - already seen the features of alteryx and
09:59 - how to actually install its setup
10:02 - so
10:03 - now as you can see the exe file is
10:05 - already downloaded
10:07 - i'm just going to click on it to open it
10:09 - up and just work you out throughout this
10:12 - installation process
10:14 - right it is a very simple installation
10:16 - process so first of all what you need to
10:18 - do is you need to just go with the first
10:20 - option which is a typical ultrex version
10:24 - if you want uh our programming language
10:27 - based predictive tools which is an
10:29 - advanced version of alteryx you can go
10:31 - for it but since this course is aimed at
10:34 - beginners so we are just going with the
10:36 - typical version the language you can
10:38 - select i'm just going with english let's
10:40 - click on next
10:41 - then it is going to download all the
10:43 - required files so let's just wait for a
10:45 - few seconds till these files are
10:47 - downloaded
10:49 - now once all the required files are
10:52 - downloaded this kind of a menu
10:56 - will appear in front of you where it
10:58 - would
10:59 - be just verifying all the contents of
11:01 - the setup package so you need to wait
11:03 - for a few seconds
11:05 - let's just meet after this has been done
11:11 - now it will ask for uh
11:13 - where to install
11:15 - the application so you can just select a
11:18 - particular folder but i'm just going
11:20 - with the default path
11:21 - let's click on next
11:24 - accept the license agreement again click
11:26 - on next
11:27 - and then it's again going to take a few
11:29 - seconds to install the whole program
11:31 - onto your system
11:34 - now once all the installation process
11:37 - has been completed you would be getting
11:39 - just a screen just like this make sure
11:42 - this box is checked on and click on
11:44 - finish now once this box is checked on
11:47 - ultrix would automatically be running
11:49 - onto your system
11:51 - now once the altrix application has been
11:54 - launched onto your system it would ask
11:56 - you to enter a license key
11:58 - if you have a license key you can just
12:00 - enter it or you can simply click on
12:02 - start free trial then it would ask your
12:05 - mail address and just remember this
12:07 - thing that this should be the same email
12:09 - address
12:10 - that you needed to provide once
12:12 - you were registering like when you were
12:14 - providing your details the email address
12:16 - you entered over there that's the same
12:19 - address that you need to provide over
12:20 - here so let's just enter this email
12:22 - address and click on continue
12:25 - now once you have entered your email
12:26 - address it would ask you whether you
12:28 - want to include the ultrix intelligence
12:31 - suite in your package or not
12:33 - so
12:35 - for now what we can do is just click on
12:37 - this i'll try it later option because i
12:39 - just don't want to use it right now
12:42 - and you can click on start solving so
12:44 - once you have done all these steps this
12:46 - kind of a dialog box would appear for
12:48 - the tour we can just click on closed
12:50 - tour because we don't need it
12:52 - right so
12:54 - this is how the ultrex user interface is
12:56 - looking
12:57 - let us take a quick look at all the
13:00 - operations that are going to be of use
13:02 - to us so first of all we have this menu
13:05 - bar with the usual options like file
13:07 - edit view and many more if you just
13:09 - hover over it you will find these
13:11 - different options right next we have is
13:14 - this tabs these are the different tabs
13:16 - having different functionalities like
13:19 - if you want some
13:20 - to add some of the tools then you can
13:23 - use these tabs like for data preparation
13:25 - for joining
13:26 - for parsing for transforming for the
13:29 - machine learning etc these different
13:31 - tools are available if you want to use
13:32 - any tools what you need to do is just go
13:34 - to its tab
13:35 - get that tool suppose i want to apply a
13:37 - filter just drag it and drop it over
13:40 - here this place where drop tools here is
13:43 - written it is known as a workflow or
13:44 - canvas so you can just drop that
13:46 - particular tool over here and then you
13:49 - would be able to use it now once you've
13:52 - dropped a tool you can see that
13:53 - something changed over here this is a
13:55 - configuration window which would help us
13:58 - to configure this tools like
14:01 - if you want to apply a filter what kind
14:02 - of a filter you want to apply the basic
14:04 - filter or a custom filter in a basic
14:06 - filter what changes you want to do so
14:08 - all these customizations or
14:09 - configurations can be done through this
14:11 - tab known as the configuration tab now
14:13 - once you have configured all the tools
14:16 - into the canvas you can click on this
14:18 - button that is known as the run button
14:20 - to actually run this workflow the
14:22 - shortcut is ctrl r so either you can use
14:24 - the shortcut or just the run button then
14:26 - what will happen is you would be getting
14:28 - a result or an output so this result
14:31 - would be shown over here in this window
14:33 - this is known as the results window this
14:35 - is where the output would be shown to
14:37 - you
14:38 - right next we have is the search part
14:40 - that is really important especially for
14:43 - the beginners like there are different
14:45 - tabs and the different tools are
14:47 - actually
14:48 - separated in those steps suppose you
14:50 - want to search for a particular tool
14:53 - like let's say you want to search for a
14:54 - formula
14:55 - so we can just simply type formula and
14:58 - you would see this formula is over here
15:00 - you can just use it like this you can
15:02 - just drag it and drop it over here like
15:04 - this okay so this search bar would be of
15:07 - very use
15:08 - to us
15:10 - next we have is this kind of a plus sign
15:12 - so if you want to add or remove some of
15:13 - the tools because there are many tools
15:15 - supported by ultrix not all are shown
15:17 - over here you want to add or remove them
15:19 - you can just simply use this option
15:21 - suppose i don't want this sdk example so
15:24 - let's just uncheck this and in case of
15:27 - that i want a special analysis right so
15:30 - let's just check on spatial and click on
15:32 - ok so what would happen is as you can
15:35 - see
15:37 - the spatial has been added over here and
15:39 - the sdk analysis has been gone from here
15:42 - so this is how you can work with the
15:44 - simple interface of ultrix this is just
15:46 - the introduction part
15:48 - in this video we are going to see that
15:50 - how can we actually import a file into
15:53 - alteryx now altrex supports different
15:56 - formats of the file so no matter if your
15:58 - data is in the form of an excel file or
16:01 - a csv file or basically any of the
16:04 - formats that are supported by ultrix the
16:07 - importing process is going to be same
16:10 - in this video i'm going to import an
16:12 - excel file and show you that how it's
16:15 - done
16:16 - similarly you can just duplicate the
16:18 - steps for any of the file extensions
16:21 - that you have
16:22 - so let us start with the video this is
16:24 - the altrix interface and i have already
16:27 - created a new workflow now once
16:31 - you want to do anything in ultrix you
16:33 - need to create a workflow because that
16:35 - is like the basic building block in
16:37 - altrix so let me first show you how to
16:39 - create a workflow to create a workflow
16:41 - you can do three steps or basically any
16:44 - of the three process you can follow to
16:47 - create a workflow first of all is in
16:49 - this particular window there is this
16:51 - plus sign if you just click on this a
16:53 - new workflow would be created like new
16:55 - workflow two if you want to close the
16:57 - workflow of course there is this cross
16:59 - sign through which you can close this
17:00 - workflow the second way is that you can
17:03 - just go to this file on the top left
17:05 - corner and here is this option of new
17:07 - workflow if you just click on it a new
17:09 - workflow would be created or you can use
17:11 - the keyboard shortcut of control n to
17:13 - create a new workflow now once your
17:16 - workflow is created as we know in ultrix
17:19 - there are a number of tools that are
17:21 - supported by it and all the tools are
17:23 - available in the menu bar
17:25 - so the thing that we need to do is
17:27 - actually input the data as you can see
17:30 - we have these menus of different
17:32 - colors that helps us to organize the
17:35 - different tools
17:37 - and separate them from one another so
17:39 - here we need to go to this in and out
17:42 - tab and here we have this input data if
17:45 - you see there is this star sign over
17:47 - this input data which means that it has
17:49 - been also added to the favorites tab if
17:51 - you just go to the favorites tab here is
17:53 - the input data that is present so if you
17:55 - want uh some of your tools that you are
17:58 - frequently using to be added to your
17:59 - favorites that you can also do so that
18:01 - they are available to you in just one
18:04 - menu without having to switch the menus
18:06 - but here we are just going to in and out
18:09 - just drag it and drop
18:11 - this tool over here
18:13 - right now it's location doesn't matter
18:15 - you can essentially place it anywhere in
18:18 - this window
18:19 - then what we are going to do is as you
18:21 - can see as soon as we uh drag this tool
18:24 - over here this left side panel changed a
18:27 - little bit and why it changed it changed
18:29 - to accommodate the changes that are
18:31 - going to happen right now this means we
18:33 - are going to input some data so how can
18:36 - we input this data we are going to
18:37 - control this using this panel okay so
18:40 - first option is connect a file or
18:42 - database so let's just click on this
18:44 - drop down
18:45 - this shows us this data connections um
18:48 - tab on this data connections dialog box
18:50 - from here we need to select files now
18:53 - why are we selecting these files we are
18:54 - selecting this files because we have an
18:57 - excel sheet that is already created and
19:00 - that is what we want to uh import in it
19:03 - so let's just click on select file then
19:05 - you got to select the location so in my
19:08 - case the sheet that i want to import is
19:10 - present in this desktop and it's named
19:12 - as quarter one data dot
19:15 - xlsx
19:16 - that is it is an excel worksheet you can
19:18 - click on open
19:20 - now once you click on open this kind of
19:23 - an excel uh dialog box would be
19:25 - appearing in front of you let us
19:27 - understand this but before understanding
19:29 - it let us let me show you that how the
19:31 - excel file is looking okay
19:34 - so this is the excel sheet that we have
19:37 - available with us actually the whole
19:39 - excel file in this whole excel file we
19:41 - have three sheets uh november 2021
19:43 - december 2021 and jan 2022 so basically
19:47 - it contains three columns all of these
19:49 - sheets contains three or four columns in
19:52 - jan 2022 we have three columns which is
19:54 - date product and the quantity in
19:56 - december 2021 we have four columns date
19:59 - product quantity and the total number of
20:00 - sales
20:01 - and in november we have date product
20:04 - quantity and the number of the items
20:05 - that were returned okay so this is the
20:07 - excel sheet now one thing you must
20:09 - remember if you are working with ultrex
20:11 - that whatever file you are going to
20:13 - import in ultrix first you have to close
20:15 - that file i want to import this
20:16 - particular excel file into alteryx so i
20:19 - need to just close it so that it could
20:21 - work in alteryx so let me just close
20:22 - this file
20:23 - uh let me just delete this tool over
20:25 - here
20:27 - and simple delete keyword work over here
20:29 - again let's just drag and drop this tool
20:31 - over here
20:32 - and then we can just connect a filo
20:34 - database once again by clicking on this
20:36 - drop down going to files
20:39 - select file and this time this quarter
20:42 - one data dot
20:44 - excel file
20:45 - now here we have as you can see we had
20:48 - three sheets available that is december
20:49 - 2021 jan 2022 and november 2021
20:53 - so if you want to just import only a
20:55 - single sheet you can just select the
20:57 - sheet from here
20:59 - if you don't want to import the whole
21:01 - sheet you just want a range of cells
21:03 - that you can select from here or if you
21:06 - want a named range now what is the named
21:07 - range in case of excel if the named
21:10 - range is available
21:11 - so what would happen is like there is a
21:14 - table you can name a table that would be
21:16 - a named range so if that named range is
21:18 - available into your sheet this option
21:20 - would be enabled and then you can just
21:22 - select the named range that you want to
21:25 - import instead of the whole sheet okay
21:28 - or if you want to import the list of
21:30 - sheet names that uh it would only get
21:32 - you all the sheet names in a list format
21:34 - so i don't want all of this i just want
21:36 - to import the sheet that is the december
21:38 - 2021 sheet this is what i want to import
21:42 - now you can click on ok and once you
21:44 - click on ok you can see the left panel
21:47 - has again changed and this time we are
21:49 - getting a lot more information
21:52 - first of all on this bottom panel you
21:53 - can see the records are being shown
21:56 - since our sheet was small the number of
21:58 - records were less around six to seven
22:00 - records were there so all the records
22:02 - are being shown over here
22:04 - but if your data set is huge then only
22:07 - the first 100 records will be shown in
22:09 - this preview tab as you can see the
22:13 - message is written here preview first
22:14 - hundred record so only the first hundred
22:16 - records would be shown now if you want
22:18 - to make any changes over here this is
22:20 - the configuration panel that would allow
22:22 - you to make the changes right like you
22:24 - can set the record limit suppose there
22:26 - are seven records but i don't want all
22:27 - seven i just want the five records to be
22:29 - shown i can simply type here five but as
22:31 - you can see there is no change so how
22:33 - can we uh incorporate this change either
22:36 - we can click on this refresh button so
22:38 - only the five records would be visible
22:40 - or what we can do is if you want to use
22:43 - this output panel so what is this output
22:46 - panel this is an output panel that
22:48 - actually would import or
22:50 - show you the changes that would occur
22:52 - once you have made any changes into the
22:54 - tool right so we can just use this run
22:56 - button or the shortcut ctrl r to
22:59 - incorporate this output panel
23:02 - and as you can see once you click on the
23:04 - run button this dialog box would appear
23:06 - that would tell you that how much time
23:08 - this whole query this whole process took
23:11 - into um
23:12 - consideration that is point zero four
23:14 - seconds so let's just click on okay
23:17 - and now you can see the five records
23:18 - have been displayed you would get plenty
23:21 - of information in this output panel as
23:23 - well like how many fields are there so
23:24 - there are four fields and all the fields
23:26 - of this are being shown
23:28 - okay
23:29 - uh if you click on this drop down you
23:30 - would be able to change these fields if
23:32 - you want like uh all these fields are
23:34 - available let me just
23:37 - like all these fields that's checked
23:38 - right now suppose i don't want to get uh
23:41 - the date i just want all these things
23:42 - okay
23:43 - these three things so only these three
23:45 - things are visible and here we are
23:46 - getting
23:47 - information that three out of four
23:48 - fields are being shown you can
23:51 - just hide all fields or click on this
23:54 - tick sign to show all the fields okay
23:57 - then we have the format that is being
24:00 - displayed which is the cell viewer
24:01 - format
24:02 - if you want to get the information about
24:04 - the particular cell that you can't get
24:06 - like what is the name of the column what
24:08 - is its type what is its size where is
24:10 - the source file etc
24:13 - so all of this we are getting in the
24:15 - cell viewer information how many recalls
24:17 - are displayed over here this is also
24:18 - being shown
24:20 - so this is the data that we are getting
24:22 - next option is a metadata option so if
24:24 - you click on this metadata you would be
24:25 - getting information about the data like
24:27 - the sell viewer option that we just
24:29 - selected this is all available over here
24:31 - the name of the column its type its size
24:33 - and its source if the description you
24:36 - have added any description that would
24:37 - also be shown in this metadata let's
24:39 - just go to data because that's what we
24:41 - are going to work upon
24:42 - so this is about the output panel and
24:44 - the uh records or the information that
24:47 - it displays
24:48 - now let's head back to this left panel
24:50 - that is the configuration panel
24:52 - in this you can see the file format is
24:54 - excel
24:55 - if you want to change any of the file
24:56 - formats you can
24:58 - just select from these these are all
24:59 - supported by ultrix
25:02 - now we have output file name as field
25:05 - now what is this thing
25:07 - suppose you are importing multiple files
25:10 - in one go okay and you want to know that
25:13 - which field belongs to which file so you
25:15 - can use this particular option like
25:17 - right now it said to know let's just
25:19 - select file name only now if you just
25:21 - click on run remember one thing once you
25:23 - have made any change you have to click
25:25 - on run you will see that it would give
25:27 - you the name of the file or the excel
25:29 - file from where you have taken this data
25:32 - right so this is actually how the excel
25:35 - file is imported in ultrix it is a
25:37 - pretty simple process and as you can see
25:40 - it's very easy and gives you so much
25:42 - information about the data so in this
25:44 - video we are going to see two things
25:47 - first of all we are going to see that
25:48 - how can we save an altrix file or an
25:50 - eltrix workflow to be more precise
25:53 - next we are going to see that how can we
25:55 - import multiple files into ultrix okay
25:59 - so first of all let's see how can we
26:00 - save a workflow this is the workflow
26:02 - from our previous video it says that we
26:04 - have created
26:06 - so how do we save it we can just go to
26:08 - file there is this option to save with a
26:10 - shortcut ctrl s that you can select
26:13 - uh you have to select the path where you
26:15 - want to save so whatever path you want
26:18 - that you can just select
26:21 - so this is this ultrix files folder
26:23 - where i want to save it okay you can
26:25 - give it any name like let me just give
26:27 - it
26:29 - excel one
26:34 - okay and the
26:35 - extension is going to be y yx empty that
26:38 - means it is a workflow file okay
26:41 - then you can click on save once you have
26:43 - saved it you can see the workflow has
26:44 - renamed itself to xl1 dot yxmd okay
26:49 - so that's a pretty simple process of
26:50 - saving now what we can do is create a
26:52 - new workflow from here
26:54 - and just close this workflow so the new
26:57 - workflow that we have created is now
26:59 - going to help us import multiple files
27:01 - so first of all let's take a look at the
27:03 - files that we want to import okay
27:06 - okay so we have this folder called csv
27:09 - in which we have two csv files data 2021
27:12 - and data 2022 okay
27:15 - uh oh sorry data 2020. so what is the
27:17 - csv file csv stands for comma separated
27:20 - values in which all the records are
27:22 - separated by commas and are placed one
27:25 - beside the other so if you just open it
27:27 - with the help of a notepad you can see
27:29 - this is how this file is looking
27:32 - the names of the column is series
27:33 - reference period data value suppressed
27:36 - status units magnitude etc there are
27:39 - columns and then these are all the
27:41 - values of the columns and as you can see
27:43 - they are all separated by commas
27:45 - these are the commas that are going to
27:47 - separate them one from the other okay so
27:49 - this is the csv files that we have the
27:52 - name of the folder is csv it is present
27:54 - in the desktop and the two files is data
27:56 - 2021 and data 2020 okay
27:58 - so the common thing between them is the
28:01 - word data and the first two characters
28:03 - of the year that is 20 okay
28:06 - or actually the first three characters
28:08 - okay
28:09 - so let's see how can we work with it on
28:11 - ultrix so let's just bring our workflow
28:14 - let's just input the data so this is the
28:16 - tool drop it over here
28:18 - now what we are going to do is just
28:21 - click on this drop down the process of
28:24 - importing the file is going to be same
28:26 - okay let's just click on files select a
28:28 - file and here this is the csv folder and
28:32 - now if you want you can just select any
28:34 - of the file that you want to import okay
28:36 - so this is this status 2021 let's click
28:39 - on open
28:40 - now what would happen is uh the first
28:42 - 100 records would be shown to you if you
28:44 - just click on run this workflow then in
28:47 - the case of the output
28:49 - um you will get the time it takes to
28:52 - execute it which is 0.6 seconds and you
28:54 - would see how many columns are there
28:56 - there are a total of 14 columns and
28:58 - 5 000 records are being displayed now
29:01 - why the 5000 records are being displayed
29:03 - there are a total of around 20 000
29:05 - records okay so in the case of a huge
29:08 - data set
29:09 - we get only few records to be displayed
29:11 - in this output panel
29:13 - why is it because in the output panel
29:16 - the maximum allowed limit is 1 mb so how
29:18 - many records you can get in 1 mb only
29:21 - those records would be displayed right
29:23 - like in this case we have thousand one
29:25 - hundred and two records out of the total
29:27 - number
29:28 - now uh these are sufficient to get you
29:30 - an idea
29:31 - of the fact that uh how the things are
29:34 - gonna work
29:36 - so it's okay
29:37 - but
29:38 - here in this case what we are getting is
29:41 - only
29:42 - the records of the table uh of the sheet
29:46 - that is data 2021 we are not getting
29:48 - 2020s data right so how can we get
29:51 - multiple files how can we like import
29:53 - multiple files into alteryx right so for
29:56 - this we are going to use something known
29:58 - as the wildcard characters
30:00 - now there are multiple white card
30:02 - characters that are available but here
30:04 - we are going to use the asterix file
30:06 - card character and how are we going to
30:07 - use it here you can see uh when we
30:10 - import a file you get the path of that
30:12 - particular file okay so what i'm gonna
30:14 - do is just remove this thing
30:16 - and as we saw that the common ground was
30:20 - data space 20 20 or 22
30:24 - so the last
30:26 - digit was different just the two
30:29 - files rest of the name was same right so
30:32 - what we are going to do is after data
30:34 - i'm just going to put an asterisk
30:37 - and click on enter or click on refresh
30:39 - now once i do that all the data files
30:42 - over here
30:45 - are being uh you know
30:50 - imported
30:52 - so let's just wait for a few seconds
31:00 - right
31:04 - you just click on this
31:05 - you would get the file over here the
31:08 - link that would be
31:09 - was shown to you
31:12 - so here what we have done is actually i
31:15 - have reduced the number of records in
31:17 - both the files and why i have done this
31:21 - uh this step is done to uh just show you
31:24 - that how these two files are
31:26 - actually taken together okay
31:30 - so
31:30 - let's see how it is happening right now
31:32 - what we are getting over here is two
31:34 - warnings it is fairly normal it's just
31:37 - because the number of records
31:40 - were uh or the number of feets are
31:42 - different for different records okay
31:44 - so if you just click on this output
31:46 - column uh we are going uh getting total
31:48 - 13 records that are being displayed okay
31:51 - now these 13 records are actually
31:54 - from a combination of both the files
31:57 - that is 2021 and 2022 or 2021 or 2020
32:01 - okay
32:02 - now how do we verify this in order to
32:04 - verify this we are going to use this
32:06 - fourth field that is output file name as
32:08 - field right now it's selected to know
32:11 - that means we do not know which records
32:13 - belongs to which file but if we just
32:15 - select it to file name only and click on
32:17 - run for the workflow
32:20 - then we would be getting this dialog box
32:21 - let's just click on ok
32:23 - and we just click on this
32:25 - output panel then you can see the number
32:28 - of fields has changed to 15 and here is
32:30 - this file name field where we are
32:32 - getting 20 21 data and 2022 data okay
32:35 - so uh here you can see the first six
32:38 - records
32:39 - are from 2021 data and the remaining
32:42 - seven records are from 2022 data a
32:44 - combination of total 13 records is being
32:47 - shown over here that means there are a
32:49 - total of 13 records that are being
32:51 - displayed to us okay
32:53 - now
32:55 - let's just see what all uh things we can
32:57 - do over here
32:58 - and
32:59 - that is like
33:02 - just keep it to file name only here we
33:04 - have some information like the
33:06 - delimiters information so what is the
33:08 - delimiter like in comma separated values
33:10 - the different values are separated by a
33:12 - comma so that means comma is a delimiter
33:14 - it separates the values right so comma
33:17 - is taken as a delimiter if you have uh
33:19 - like a json file or an html file then of
33:23 - course comma would not be the delimiter
33:25 - the delimiter would be different so
33:27 - whatever character you want as a
33:29 - delimiter that you can use over here
33:32 - next we have first row contains field
33:34 - names so in order to understand this let
33:37 - me just open the csv file in notepad
33:39 - once okay
33:40 - so here is the csv file that i have
33:42 - opened in notepad this is the first
33:45 - series of commas that we are getting and
33:48 - this is actually
33:50 - the column names so this is the first
33:52 - field that is series reference period
33:54 - data value suppressed etc this is all
33:57 - taken as the field name so this first
34:00 - option that we have let me just close
34:01 - this file this first option that we have
34:03 - first row contains field names if it is
34:05 - checked then the first
34:07 - row is selected as the field names if
34:09 - you just uncheck it and run it once
34:11 - again
34:12 - then what would happen is
34:15 - let's click on ok
34:17 - show the output
34:19 - you can see field two field three field
34:21 - four like this all the field names had
34:23 - been shown to us and the first
34:25 - comma separated values that we had would
34:27 - be taken as a record itself right so
34:29 - which is of course not correct so let me
34:32 - just rectify it by again running it by
34:35 - checking that particular option okay
34:39 - uh next we have all these information
34:42 - which is actually not that important but
34:44 - it is there
34:46 - to you know just um
34:49 - give you much more information about the
34:51 - data one thing is ignore delimiters and
34:53 - quotes so suppose we have some values uh
34:56 - into our data which actually includes
34:58 - the comma like apple comma banana
35:01 - which are not two separate values so to
35:03 - tell the computer this thing what we can
35:05 - do is actually include it in quotes and
35:08 - that would be ignored as a delimiter so
35:10 - if you want to ignore anything as a
35:12 - delimiter that you can do okay so this
35:15 - is
35:15 - all about the multiple files there is
35:18 - one more thing that we need to know and
35:19 - that is suppose we make some changes
35:21 - into the folder let me just go to the
35:23 - csv folder and let me just copy this
35:26 - file and paste it so suppose there is a
35:28 - change in the folder
35:31 - let me just rename it to
35:34 - 2020 underscore data
35:37 - okay
35:39 - now what happens if i have added
35:42 - another file or if i remove some files
35:44 - okay we can just click on run
35:47 - and
35:49 - now if we just click on this output you
35:51 - can see the total number of records
35:53 - displayed is 20. so this whole process
35:57 - is now automatic if any changes are
35:59 - being made into your data
36:02 - or into the folder in the files that
36:04 - would be reflected automatically in
36:06 - altrix
36:07 - that's the beauty of this in this video
36:10 - we are going to talk about the data
36:11 - types that are supported in ultrix
36:14 - so as we know that alteryx is a
36:16 - self-service data analytics tool
36:18 - it makes the process of etl easier
36:22 - and it is a super tool that combines the
36:24 - functionalities that are required for
36:26 - the steps of data preparation geospatial
36:29 - analysis and data science
36:31 - mainly to support all these
36:33 - functionalities alteryx
36:35 - uses these five data types
36:38 - these are the five data types that are
36:39 - supported in ultrix which are string
36:42 - data numeric data date and time data
36:44 - boolean data and spatial objects
36:47 - once the data is brought into ultrix the
36:49 - alteryx data type is applied to the
36:51 - entire column and each value within that
36:54 - column
36:55 - ultrex tends to use the best suitable
36:57 - data type for the data coming from the
36:59 - databases or the structured files such
37:01 - as excel within the alteryx table
37:05 - now let us look at all of these data
37:07 - types in detail one by one
37:09 - so first of all we come to the string
37:11 - data type
37:12 - string data represents only text
37:15 - even if the data is numeric or spaces or
37:17 - special characters if a string consists
37:19 - of numbers it is ideally advised uh to
37:22 - first convert it to the numeric data
37:24 - type then you can just perform the
37:25 - calculations into it
37:27 - the string data is the one that is kept
37:30 - as it is
37:32 - it is further divided into these four
37:33 - categories that is string v string w
37:37 - string and v underscore string
37:39 - string and w string are a fixed length
37:42 - and you have to set the predefined
37:43 - length of the string so suppose you have
37:45 - set 8 to 100 characters then every time
37:47 - it would take 100 characters
37:50 - the w string can hold more international
37:52 - characters
37:54 - now we have v string and we underscore w
37:56 - string it stands for variable the v here
37:59 - stands for variable that means we cannot
38:01 - set any predefined length or we should
38:03 - not send
38:04 - any predefined length and it adjusts
38:07 - itself according to the length
38:09 - of the text of of the value that it is
38:12 - going to hold
38:14 - next we have is the numeric data type
38:16 - numeric alteryx data types um
38:19 - are the ones that contains only the
38:21 - numbers
38:22 - it stores the numbers
38:24 - that could be represented by either a
38:26 - single lizard or by multiple digits as
38:28 - well
38:29 - we have different combinations in this
38:31 - like byte integer
38:33 - fixed decimal float and double
38:36 - byte and integer are the whole numbers
38:38 - fixed decimal float and double include a
38:41 - decimal number as well
38:43 - byte is a small number then we have
38:45 - integer which has more significant
38:47 - numbers as you can see they range as
38:48 - well in the examples
38:51 - then we have fixed decimal which is used
38:54 - for currency and float and double so
38:57 - this is fixed sml which is used as a
38:59 - currency
39:00 - that's a numeric value with a decimal
39:02 - next we have the float and double which
39:05 - are used for most precise numbers
39:08 - float and code are not
39:09 - good because it comes to comparison they
39:12 - are never equal
39:14 - float is generally used to save the
39:16 - memory
39:18 - now the next data type we have is the
39:20 - date time data type
39:21 - uh in altrix the format of date
39:25 - time and date and time combined together
39:27 - are fixed
39:28 - so you will need to do some manipulation
39:30 - on your data if it is not in the format
39:33 - that you need
39:34 - as generalized by ultrix
39:36 - sometimes it is very difficult to work
39:39 - with date and time
39:40 - there is a tool known as the datetime
39:42 - macro that converts the date and time in
39:45 - human readable as well as ultrix
39:47 - readable format
39:49 - so the format is as you can see for the
39:51 - date there is a 10 character string
39:53 - employing four characters for year
39:56 - two for month and two for date this is
39:58 - the general format that is supported by
40:00 - ultrix
40:01 - then we have time which is again an
40:03 - eight character string
40:05 - two characters for r2 for minutes and
40:07 - two for seconds
40:08 - and the examples have been shown on the
40:10 - right side of the screen
40:12 - next we have date and time combined
40:14 - which is a 19 character string
40:16 - employing four characters for the year
40:18 - two for the month two for the date and
40:21 - two each for the hours minutes and
40:22 - seconds and an example has been shown on
40:25 - the right side
40:27 - so these are the date and time data
40:29 - types that are supported in ultrix
40:31 - next we have is the boolean data type
40:35 - so the boolean
40:36 - basically represents a flag and it has
40:39 - only two possible values that is true
40:41 - and false so true means non-zero or one
40:45 - and false means zero
40:48 - or basically any other digit that is not
40:51 - zero can be considered as true
40:53 - boolean is used to basically
40:56 - characterize the objects categorize them
40:58 - into various categories or identify them
41:00 - whether the objects
41:02 - are a part of the particular category or
41:04 - not for example let's take up
41:07 - a student data set
41:08 - so
41:09 - in the student data set we can check
41:11 - that if the student has passed the test
41:14 - or not so we can just create or the data
41:17 - can have
41:18 - a column as passed it could have values
41:21 - true false or yes no
41:23 - so true false in that case would be
41:25 - represented using the boolean data types
41:30 - next we have is the spatial objects
41:32 - spatial objects are used for mapping
41:35 - and are associated with maintaining the
41:37 - data records
41:38 - a point a line polyline or polygon all
41:43 - comes out of spatial objects which can
41:45 - be used for mapping
41:48 - it is associated with the data record
41:50 - and
41:51 - they can be multiple spatial object
41:53 - fields in a table
41:55 - furthermore if you want to use any of
41:57 - the data like which is
42:00 - which cannot be represented in the
42:01 - format of a text like uh let's suppose
42:03 - an image or a video
42:05 - or an audio file then we use the spatial
42:08 - objects again
42:10 - so what happens is when you just
42:12 - import the uh
42:14 - table or any kind of an excel file
42:17 - then what happens is these spatial
42:19 - objects are
42:20 - automatically invoked actually there are
42:23 - two ways through which
42:25 - this alteryx
42:27 - imports this data types like how it uses
42:30 - these data types so let us take a look
42:31 - at them as well
42:33 - data in alteryx can be brought through
42:35 - these two fields or three
42:38 - through these two tools that is the auto
42:40 - field tool and the select tool now what
42:42 - is the difference between them auto
42:44 - field tool is used to select the data
42:46 - type automatically by alterix while the
42:48 - select tool
42:50 - helps the user to decide the data type
42:52 - so in case you are a user and you don't
42:54 - want an overhead of
42:56 - selecting the data data for alteryx you
42:58 - can just go for the auto field tool
43:01 - so auto field tool is used to read
43:03 - through all of the records of an input
43:05 - and set the field type to the smallest
43:07 - possible size that is relative to the
43:10 - data contained in the column the tool
43:12 - correctly assigns a numeric field to a
43:15 - string data type where any record starts
43:17 - with 0 and not a number
43:20 - so in order to configure the tool we can
43:22 - just go to the select string fields to
43:24 - auto change field type and select the
43:27 - fields to auto configure them
43:29 - we can use either individually or all
43:31 - the fields at once as well
43:35 - next we have is the select tool so the
43:37 - select tool is used to include exclude
43:40 - and reorder the columns of data that
43:42 - pass through your workflow excluding the
43:44 - columns that can limit the data passing
43:46 - through a workflow and improve
43:48 - performance we can also use the select
43:50 - tool to modify the type and size of the
43:52 - data rename a column or add a
43:54 - description to it
43:56 - now there are other tools that include
43:58 - the select tool functionality such
44:00 - are append fields tool fine nearest tool
44:03 - join tool join multiple tool selecting
44:05 - db tool and spatial match tool we can
44:08 - use the table to modify the incoming
44:10 - data stream each row in the table
44:12 - represents a column in the data the
44:14 - field column in the table identifies the
44:16 - name of the column in the data and auto
44:18 - sizes to fit the column names without
44:20 - cutting of any text
44:22 - which is taken up to 40 characters
44:24 - so this is how the autofill tool and the
44:27 - select tool works
44:29 - in itrex now as we know that there are
44:31 - multiple tools in ultrix and each of
44:34 - them have a specific functionality in
44:37 - case you are interested in learning more
44:39 - about these tools then what you can do
44:41 - is refer to the official alteryx
44:44 - documentation now how to access it let
44:46 - me show you
44:47 - so in order to access it first of all i
44:49 - have opened up google and all you need
44:51 - to do is google alteryx help
44:54 - so once you uh google it the first link
44:57 - that comes up is the home page instead
44:59 - of going to the home page you can select
45:01 - on this documentation
45:03 - link so what would happen is the whole
45:06 - alteryx health documentation would be
45:09 - open in front of you now in case you
45:10 - want to learn about anything related to
45:12 - alteryx you can refer to this
45:14 - documentation which is
45:15 - very much precise and clean in case you
45:18 - want to learn about these tools specific
45:20 - tools then you can refer to this um
45:23 - menu over here where all the tools are
45:26 - present and they are configured or they
45:28 - are
45:29 - grouped together like all these tools
45:32 - that are present in the in out tab are
45:33 - together grouped in this in out the
45:36 - tools that are present in the
45:37 - preparation tab are all present over
45:39 - here you can click on any of these links
45:41 - and that link would be opened here you
45:43 - would find the
45:45 - way through which you can use the tools
45:47 - how to use it how is it looking and how
45:50 - you can configure it
45:53 - then uh
45:54 - you can also see some examples that what
45:56 - would happen when this tool is being
45:58 - used what kind of output you would be
46:00 - think
46:01 - so uh these are
46:03 - the documentation that would help you to
46:04 - learn about all the tools in alteryx but
46:07 - the common ones that are used and the
46:09 - most important ones we would be covering
46:11 - in this course in this video we are
46:12 - going to start
46:14 - discussing about the important tools in
46:18 - ultrix the tools that would help you
46:20 - carry out the different tasks that are
46:22 - really important throughout your atrix
46:25 - journey
46:26 - so uh without any further ado let us
46:28 - start with this video
46:30 - first of all before jumping into the
46:32 - tools part let us download the data set
46:36 - now this data set that we are going to
46:37 - download is going to be used throughout
46:40 - this course
46:41 - so
46:42 - it is important for you to have a copy
46:45 - of this data set for you as well
46:47 - so how do we download this uh first of
46:49 - all what you need to do is simply google
46:51 - sample superstore data set like i have
46:53 - googled over here
46:55 - now once you do that the first link that
46:56 - would come up would be a tableau
46:58 - community so let's just click on this
47:00 - link
47:02 - and
47:04 - this is actually a data set that has the
47:08 - different types of information like the
47:11 - five data types of alteryx that we have
47:13 - just learned are all supported in this
47:15 - particular data set it has around 10 000
47:18 - records so it is easier for you to
47:20 - understand the concepts and practice it
47:23 - on this kind of a data set it is
47:25 - available for free so you can use it as
47:28 - many times as you want now once this
47:30 - link is open here you can see this is an
47:32 - excel file you can just simply click on
47:34 - download and store it into the location
47:37 - that you want
47:38 - so since i have already downloaded it
47:40 - over here sample superstore.xlx
47:42 - as you can see so i'm not going to
47:44 - redownload it but you can just save it
47:47 - now once you have downloaded the data
47:48 - set let's come back to our ultrix tool
47:51 - here today i am going to discuss about
47:54 - the browse tool in ultrix now the browse
47:57 - tool is a really important tool and here
47:59 - i have actually implemented the browse
48:01 - tool but what i am going to do is just
48:03 - delete all of this functionality and
48:05 - show you once again that how it is
48:07 - working okay
48:09 - so first of all let's understand what is
48:11 - a browse tool as you can see uh we have
48:13 - in this favorites tab the browse tool is
48:15 - available but if you
48:17 - check the in out tab that's where the
48:20 - browse tool would be present okay
48:22 - so the browse tool is used to view the
48:24 - data from a connected tool what do you
48:26 - mean by a connected tool that means the
48:28 - browse tool if you just bring it over
48:30 - here like this then it won't be able to
48:32 - show you some data it needs some kind of
48:34 - a tool
48:35 - so browse tool is actually a connected
48:37 - tool
48:38 - okay so we can see the data profile
48:43 - for multiple columns at once in a single
48:45 - holistic view or for a single column of
48:47 - the data
48:49 - we can
48:50 - see the information on data type the
48:52 - number of records the quality of the
48:54 - data and a variety of other statistics
48:57 - as well using the browse tool
48:59 - in case of a spatial report or a
49:01 - behavioral data analysis
49:03 - the type is connected an additional tab
49:05 - is available in the browse tool
49:08 - that shows the preview of the actual
49:10 - object on a map or a report okay
49:14 - so browse rule if you just bring it up
49:17 - let's
49:18 - understand this
49:19 - this
49:20 - thing that's green over here is known as
49:22 - an anchor it has one anchor
49:25 - that is the input anchor now if you just
49:27 - bring up this input data tool which we
49:29 - have already used you can see it also
49:31 - has one anchor but it has in the shape
49:34 - of the anchor of the browse tool and the
49:35 - input tool is different so the input
49:38 - tool has an output anchor that means the
49:40 - input tool contains the data and it
49:43 - gives its data to some other tool browse
49:45 - tool on the other hand
49:47 - cannot exist independently it needs some
49:50 - other tool to exist that's why it takes
49:52 - the data from some other tool and to
49:55 - take the data from some other tool it
49:56 - needs an anchor that's why to use the
49:59 - browse tool at least the input tool
50:01 - should be present so that it acts as an
50:03 - input anchor and this acts as a
50:05 - receiving anchor for itself okay
50:07 - so
50:09 - let us now see how can we uh use the
50:11 - data or use the browse tool to show the
50:14 - data the data profile okay so first of
50:17 - all uh we have this input tool using
50:19 - this input tool what i'm gonna do is
50:21 - actually import a file into ultrix okay
50:24 - the sample superstore data set file that
50:26 - we have just
50:27 - downloaded that is the file that i'm
50:29 - going to import so let's go to file
50:33 - and select file
50:34 - here is the sample superstore file
50:37 - let us open it
50:39 - now it asks for a sheet so the order
50:41 - sheet is what i'm going to go with let's
50:43 - just click on ok
50:45 - so after a few seconds you can see that
50:48 - here in the configuration panel we have
50:50 - this whole data set right now only a
50:53 - hundred rows are being shown over here
50:54 - if we just run this workflow
50:57 - then we would be able to see it in the
51:00 - output column
51:02 - but the output would not be shown over
51:04 - here right now
51:10 - and these kind of errors would be
51:12 - opening why because of the browse tool
51:15 - we have used the browse tool but not
51:17 - actually provided a connection to it so
51:19 - let's see how do we work with it
51:23 - how do we uh you know
51:26 - work around it okay so let's just first
51:28 - close this message
51:30 - now what we are going to do is connect
51:31 - these two anchors like
51:33 - this drag from the input anchor and drop
51:36 - it to the browse tool anchor
51:38 - right now it's going to take a few
51:39 - seconds
51:40 - and again if we just run the workflow
51:45 - then it's going to take a few seconds
51:47 - and then the information will be shown
51:49 - you can see the percentage of the work
51:50 - that's been done
51:53 - and once all the work has been done you
51:55 - would get this kind of a message let's
51:57 - click on ok
51:58 - now the information being shown in the
52:00 - configuration panel is with relevant to
52:02 - the input data tool if we just click on
52:03 - the browse tool then right now nothing
52:05 - is being shown because we have not
52:07 - selected any of the records right if you
52:09 - remember i just told you that uh you
52:11 - have to select at least one column or
52:14 - you can select multiple columns as well
52:16 - uh so that the information is being
52:18 - shown
52:19 - to you okay so let us just select some
52:21 - column or let's say the category column
52:23 - if we just select this category column
52:25 - from here
52:27 - then wait for a few seconds and the
52:29 - information or the report of the
52:30 - category column or the data profile of
52:33 - the category column would be shown in
52:34 - this configuration panel okay
52:38 - so this is the data profile of the
52:40 - category column that has been shown over
52:42 - here
52:45 - just a second
52:48 - yeah
52:49 - so um
52:52 - we just select the category column here
52:54 - it is being shown
52:56 - and as you can see the data type first
52:58 - it has taken is the variable string so
53:00 - that means the
53:02 - uh length is variable to just save the
53:05 - memory space the total number of records
53:07 - the size that has been taken is 255
53:10 - bytes okay
53:11 - now out of the total 909 994 records the
53:15 - total records that are okay is all the
53:19 - records are okay here you can see the
53:20 - number of records that are okay and the
53:22 - percentage so 100 records are okay
53:25 - unique means how many different values
53:27 - are there so as you can see we are
53:28 - getting three over here that means the
53:31 - three possible values for category are
53:32 - furniture office supplies and technology
53:36 - that has been shown over here
53:37 - then we have some of the statistics of
53:39 - the length so the minimum length of the
53:41 - value is nine as you can see it should
53:43 - be furniture
53:45 - then the maximum is 15 which is for
53:47 - office space supplies
53:49 - then uh we have the shortest value which
53:51 - is furniture of course longest value is
53:53 - office underscore supplies
53:55 - then uh we have the first alphanumeric
53:57 - value that is the first value that you
53:58 - are getting is furniture and the last
54:00 - record must be having the category as
54:03 - office supplies right
54:06 - as technology
54:07 - there are no blanks that means the
54:10 - particular column is clean it has no
54:12 - inconsistent data
54:14 - there is no leading white space and
54:15 - there is no trailing white space now
54:17 - there is another reason of choosing this
54:19 - particular data set because this is a
54:20 - clean data set it does not have any of
54:22 - the inconsistencies so for us as a
54:25 - beginner it's easier to understand and
54:27 - work with these kind of data sets okay
54:30 - then we have the frequent values
54:33 - so it would tell you that how many um
54:37 - instances of the particular category are
54:39 - there if we talk about office supplies
54:41 - so there are six thousand uh 26 records
54:44 - of the office supplies that is the most
54:46 - number of records for this then we have
54:47 - furniture about 2121 records and
54:51 - technology with 1.8 k records
54:55 - so this is the data profile of the
54:57 - particular column that has been shown
54:59 - over here as you can see the column is
55:01 - uh taken over here as category if we
55:03 - just try to employ sub category as well
55:05 - over here
55:09 - so this is the sub category
55:12 - that we have employed over here right
55:14 - now and now the summary has changed as
55:16 - you can see the number of unique values
55:17 - is 17 now so there are 17 subcategories
55:22 - and here is the uh introduction of the
55:24 - individual sub categories the frequent
55:25 - values the graph that is being shown
55:27 - over here there are 12 more values you
55:29 - can expand it and see that what is the
55:31 - occurrence of each of these
55:32 - subcategories okay
55:35 - next we have is the country so the
55:37 - country if you just select on this
55:38 - country column it's all united states
55:41 - right now so
55:43 - i don't think it's going to make any
55:44 - difference then we have the cities which
55:47 - has 531 unique values for the cities and
55:50 - how it has been shown so this is the
55:52 - usage of the browse tool through which
55:54 - it is used to show the different records
55:56 - okay
55:58 - now
55:59 - in order to view multiple values
56:02 - what we can do is actually use the left
56:05 - right view or the top bottom view
56:07 - right now subcategory is being selected
56:09 - in this profile but in this profile
56:11 - nothing is being selected as you scroll
56:13 - down you can see that the different
56:15 - columns are being shown over here so
56:17 - suppose i want to show the segment i can
56:19 - just click on segment and the values or
56:21 - the data profile or segment would be
56:22 - shown over here
56:24 - so here you can see the segment it has
56:27 - three unique values
56:29 - consumer home office are the two values
56:31 - and the third value as you can see is
56:33 - the corporate segment so the data
56:35 - profile of two
56:37 - columns are being shown over here using
56:39 - the browse tools simultaneously so
56:41 - that's all about the browse tool that
56:43 - you need to know in this video we are
56:45 - going to talk about data manipulation
56:48 - and output tool in ultrix
56:52 - so as we know that alteryx is a tool
56:54 - that is used for the purposes of data
56:56 - cleaning as well right so what we are
56:59 - going to do today is actually i am going
57:02 - to show you how to clean the data
57:05 - if inconsistencies are present using the
57:07 - data manipulation tool in ultrix okay
57:10 - so this is the sample superstore data
57:12 - set that we downloaded and as i have
57:15 - already told you that it is a super
57:17 - clean data set there are no
57:19 - inconsistencies in this data set so what
57:21 - i have done is i have introduced
57:23 - an inconsistency
57:25 - and that is in this furniture
57:28 - what i have done is
57:30 - i have actually added some
57:32 - leading white spaces in this category
57:34 - furniture i have added some leading
57:36 - white spaces now let us add some more in
57:39 - the subcategory field okay so there is
57:42 - this chairs i am just going to replace
57:44 - the stairs value
57:48 - and
57:49 - introduce some leading white spaces so
57:51 - around three white spaces would be good
57:54 - and replace all the values of okay so
57:57 - 791 replacements were made
58:00 - and this is the change that i have done
58:01 - to introduce some inconsistencies into
58:03 - our data set and to see that how can we
58:05 - solve it using ultrax now using control
58:08 - s let me just save this excel file and
58:10 - close this excel file
58:13 - right so let's create a new workflow new
58:15 - workflow 3 over here and uh just
58:19 - import this data set so let's just use
58:22 - this input data
58:24 - and what we're going to do is connect it
58:26 - to a file
58:28 - so this is the data set that we have and
58:31 - the orders sheet click on okay
58:34 - so now um
58:36 - as you can see there is nothing that's
58:38 - been shown over here let's just add a
58:40 - browse tool now there is another way
58:41 - through adding a browse tool that's you
58:43 - can just right click over here
58:45 - and there is this option add browse
58:47 - after and the shortcut for the same as
58:49 - ctrl shift b
58:50 - so you can just add it and click on run
58:53 - now once you do that
58:55 - what would happen is uh you would get
58:57 - this kind of a message and
59:00 - of course the records would be shown
59:02 - over here okay so the profiles have been
59:04 - shown over here now the changes we made
59:06 - were in the category okay so let's just
59:09 - see the category and the subcategory
59:11 - right now
59:12 - the changes were made in the category
59:13 - and the subcategory fields now if you
59:15 - just hover over this category field
59:17 - there are few records
59:19 - that are not okay
59:21 - right the red line has been shown over
59:23 - here and um that is around 21.22 records
59:27 - that are not okay in the category field
59:29 - because the inconsistency is there
59:31 - similarly in the sub category field as
59:33 - well there is 6.17 records uh 6.17
59:37 - records that are not okay represented by
59:39 - red so if you just show the category
59:42 - over here and just split the view
59:45 - so over here we had been shown the
59:47 - category field and here let's just go
59:49 - with the subcategory field
59:51 - so here is the subcategory field okay
59:55 - so now what we get first of all let's
59:56 - take a look at the category field that
59:59 - is uh 7 000
60:01 - some records are okay but 2121 reports
60:04 - are not okay
60:06 - now what is the reason uh that these
60:08 - records are not okay
60:09 - these are the values with leading white
60:11 - space how many values 2121 values okay
60:15 - similarly if we just talk about the sub
60:17 - category over here
60:19 - so we have
60:20 - 617 records that are not okay
60:22 - represented in the red color
60:25 - and what is the issue the issue is the
60:28 - values with the leading white space so
60:30 - these are some of the inconsistencies
60:31 - that would be shown into your data
60:33 - profile only okay so how do we uh just
60:36 - get rid of these inconsistencies right
60:39 - so what you need to do is search for
60:41 - that particular column over here here as
60:43 - well you can see that the mark of not
60:46 - okay is being shown over here
60:48 - represented by red and the rest is green
60:50 - in category and subcategory fields okay
60:52 - in the output pane and the values that
60:54 - are inconsistent have been marked as red
60:57 - and the message is the cell has leading
61:00 - spaces the cell has leading spaces so
61:02 - whatever the inconsistency is it's been
61:04 - automatically shown to you by ultrix now
61:06 - how do we manipulate it how do we clean
61:09 - it
61:09 - you need to select the column which has
61:11 - inconsistency click on these three dots
61:13 - here we have the option of data cleanse
61:16 - so you can just go to
61:19 - this data cleanse option just a
61:22 - second and here we have remove unwanted
61:25 - characters and in the remove unwanted
61:28 - characters the first option is leading
61:30 - slash trailing white space so that means
61:32 - any of the uh leading or the trailing
61:34 - white spaces if there would be removed
61:36 - so just select that option and click on
61:38 - apply
61:39 - now it's going to take a few seconds and
61:42 - the changes would be applied now once
61:44 - the changes have been applied you can
61:46 - see the red mark in the category has
61:47 - gone from here
61:49 - we can see them all correctly the
61:51 - furniture leading spaces have been
61:53 - removed if you want to cross check it
61:55 - let's just bring up the category field
61:56 - once again
62:00 - here
62:02 - so if you see
62:03 - right now okay is change to a hundred
62:05 - percent
62:06 - similarly we can do the same thing for
62:08 - the sub category field as well we can go
62:10 - to subcategory data cleanse remove
62:12 - unwanted characters leading trailing
62:14 - white space and click on apply
62:16 - now again it's going to take a few
62:18 - seconds and the changes would be applied
62:23 - in order to crosstrick it you can just
62:25 - go to the subcategory option over here
62:28 - and the okay has been changed to 100
62:31 - now again run the workflow
62:36 - so if you again run the workflow the
62:38 - inconsistencies would be uh introduced
62:40 - once again and why is that because
62:43 - now what we are getting is we are again
62:45 - getting the data from input
62:47 - that means alterix only makes changes
62:49 - into the format of the data that is
62:51 - brought in front of it not only original
62:53 - files okay
62:54 - so that's why uh using the browse tool
62:56 - the changes that have been made are only
62:58 - made onto this data that has been used
63:01 - in ultrix right
63:03 - now once we have changed the data what
63:05 - we need to do is actually make use of
63:07 - this data right
63:09 - so what i'm going to do is output this
63:12 - data into an excel file
63:14 - but not on to a single sheet into
63:16 - multiple sheets
63:18 - so how do we do that for this we use the
63:21 - output data tool of this in out category
63:24 - so output data tool let's just bring it
63:26 - up
63:27 - now what i'm going to do with this
63:29 - output data tool is
63:31 - i'm going to select the category as the
63:33 - criteria
63:34 - so what i'm going to do or what i'm
63:37 - planning to do is actually use
63:40 - this category over here
63:42 - to output the data
63:44 - right or basically use a segment to
63:47 - output the data
63:51 - uh so what would happen is
63:54 - all the data
63:55 - uh
63:56 - all three uh separate sheets would be
63:59 - created right so
64:02 - uh if we just apply this segment if you
64:05 - just take a look at the segment field
64:09 - just a second
64:14 - okay so now if we take a look at this
64:16 - segment then what we are getting is that
64:18 - there are three unique values so that
64:20 - means three different sheets would be
64:21 - created in the excel file so for this
64:23 - what we need to do is go to this output
64:25 - tool
64:26 - uh click on this arrow here and go to
64:29 - files and select file so basically we
64:32 - are selecting the location where our
64:33 - file needs to be saved now provide a
64:36 - name for the file let's say
64:37 - output
64:40 - excel
64:42 - okay
64:42 - and make sure that in the save as type
64:46 - it is selected as uh an excel file or a
64:49 - microsoft excel for the extension
64:52 - xls or xlsx
64:54 - because then only you would be able to
64:56 - create multiple sheets in case you
64:58 - decide to save it as an alterex database
65:01 - so multiple sheets in that case is not
65:03 - possible okay
65:04 - click on save
65:06 - now uh it would ask you to specify the
65:08 - name of a sheet we can just go with
65:10 - sheet1 and click on ok great
65:15 - now what would happen is
65:18 - if we just click on this tool
65:20 - here we have this configuration panel in
65:22 - this you need to just check this option
65:24 - that is take file slash
65:26 - table name from field
65:28 - then there is this drop down from this
65:30 - drop down you have to select the third
65:32 - option which is change file slash table
65:34 - name
65:35 - now what would happen is this would
65:36 - allow you to select the column on the
65:39 - basis of which you want to create
65:40 - different sheets right
65:42 - so
65:43 - uh here we can just use the drop down to
65:45 - select the
65:48 - value and that is the segment so you can
65:49 - just select the segment
65:52 - once you have done all the steps then
65:54 - you need to use this control r or run
65:57 - button to just run the workflow
66:00 - then you can see that the
66:03 - dialog box would be there showing the
66:05 - time taken and if you just click on this
66:07 - messages or that is this three
66:10 - hamburger menu over here you will see
66:12 - that these three sheets were created
66:14 - consumer corporate and the home office
66:16 - sheets and the number of records that
66:18 - were written into each of these sheets
66:21 - to cross check what you can do is go to
66:23 - that particular folder which was present
66:25 - in my desktop here output excel
66:28 - the excel sheet that has been created
66:31 - and you can see that there are three
66:33 - sheets that are available
66:35 - the consumer sheet the corporate sheet
66:37 - and the home office sheet now each of
66:39 - these sheets has their data that is
66:41 - split according to their segments all
66:43 - the home office data in this sheet all
66:45 - the corporate data in this sheet and all
66:46 - the consumer data in this sheet so this
66:48 - is how the output tool in ultrix works
66:52 - the output data tool is used to output
66:54 - the multiple excel sheets in this video
66:56 - we are going to take a look at the few
66:59 - tools of this in out configuration
67:02 - so the first tool that we are going to
67:04 - look at is the directory tool
67:06 - so the directory tool is used to return
67:09 - a list of all the files that are present
67:11 - in the specified directory
67:13 - it returns the file name and other
67:15 - information about each file uh like its
67:18 - size the date it was created the last
67:21 - modified date and many more information
67:23 - okay so let's see how do we use it
67:26 - uh first of all grab the directory tool
67:29 - from the you know tab into your workflow
67:30 - workspace then what you need to do is in
67:33 - this configuration tab you have to
67:35 - specify the directory of the folder from
67:37 - where you want to get the files okay so
67:39 - in my case i have already specified the
67:41 - folder that is this files folder in the
67:43 - altrix
67:45 - click on ok
67:46 - now if you want specific files to be
67:48 - there only then you can specify the
67:50 - files
67:51 - otherwise uh this asterisk is over here
67:54 - that means uh any of the files any of
67:57 - the file names dot any of the file
67:59 - extensions would be taken
68:02 - if you want to um
68:03 - include the sub directories like if you
68:05 - want to search for the specified file
68:07 - types in directories
68:08 - that are specified within the specified
68:10 - directory then this box um
68:13 - is checked otherwise leave it unchecked
68:15 - okay
68:17 - it's only for the specific files but we
68:18 - are going for the generic ones so no
68:20 - need to include the sub directories
68:22 - let's just click on run so what would
68:24 - happen is uh you would get this kind of
68:27 - an output that is the list of all of
68:29 - these uh
68:31 - files that are present in this directory
68:33 - the full path the directory the name of
68:36 - the file along with its extension
68:39 - the
68:40 - creation time the time when it was last
68:43 - accessed last written
68:45 - the size
68:47 - and some of the attributes like it is it
68:50 - encrypted is it compressed is it
68:52 - archived is it hidden is it normal
68:55 - uh is it
68:56 - offline is it read-only
68:58 - uh and so on so these are all the fields
69:02 - that we would be getting so this is for
69:03 - the generic files let us now search for
69:05 - the specific files
69:07 - okay so we are going with the extension
69:09 - as you can see yx md files are present
69:11 - over here so instead of
69:14 - all the files
69:15 - my
69:16 - xmd files are the only ones that i am
69:18 - interested in right now and in the sub
69:20 - directories as well
69:22 - then click on run
69:24 - so what i would be getting is
69:27 - only the yxmd file so there are a total
69:29 - of seven yx md files in the sub
69:31 - directories and the directory of this
69:33 - particular folder so this is what i am
69:35 - getting through the directory tool
69:38 - right
69:39 - let's just click ctrl s to save it
69:42 - next tool that we have is the date time
69:44 - tool so as we have discussed about the
69:47 - date time already uh in the data types
69:51 - video in ultrix so this date time now
69:55 - tool is used to return a single record
69:57 - that is the date or the time
70:00 - at the time when the workflow was run
70:03 - and you can just convert the value into
70:05 - the string format of your choosing
70:07 - so basically this is useful that once
70:10 - you are creating any report and you want
70:12 - to
70:13 - show the date or the time of its
70:14 - creation then you can use this
70:17 - particular tool okay so let's just bring
70:19 - in this tool this is the daytime now
70:21 - tool
70:22 - over here it
70:23 - requires us to specify two things the
70:25 - language in which we want the date and
70:27 - time and the format in which we want
70:28 - that is the output format
70:30 - so let's just get the
70:33 - format like this where i'm getting the
70:35 - date as well as the time
70:37 - now click on run or use the shortcut
70:39 - ctrl r so we would be getting
70:42 - a column with today's date and the time
70:44 - at which this was run okay
70:47 - now in case you decide to change the
70:49 - language right now i have taken english
70:51 - but let me just
70:52 - go with spanish okay
70:54 - click on ok
70:55 - and now what we are getting is the same
70:58 - output but to get a different output
71:00 - let's just choose a different format
71:02 - like this
71:04 - click on run
71:05 - and now what we are getting is a
71:07 - different format like the month name is
71:08 - in spanish right now
71:11 - so this is what we are getting this is
71:13 - the usage of the um date time now tool
71:17 - let's just press ctrl s to save it
71:20 - and move on to the next tool which is
71:21 - the text input tool now what is the
71:24 - usage of this text input tool
71:27 - it is used to manually enter the text to
71:29 - create small data files for input
71:33 - it can be useful in
71:34 - like testing and creating the lookup
71:36 - tables while we are building the
71:38 - workflow the data input from the text
71:41 - input tool saves within the workflow so
71:43 - you can share the workflow without
71:44 - having to provide an input file okay
71:48 - so let's see how do we work with it uh
71:50 - first of all let's just get this input
71:52 - data that is this text input tool
71:54 - over here now once we have got it over
71:57 - here we would be getting these different
71:58 - options like this is the option to
72:00 - import if you want to import any of the
72:02 - files but treat it as the input that has
72:05 - been manually taken into the workflow so
72:07 - when we share the workflow the file gets
72:10 - shared as well we do not have to
72:11 - externally share the file
72:13 - right then we have the copy once we have
72:15 - entered the values if you want to copy
72:17 - it if you have already copied the values
72:18 - from somewhere and just want to paste it
72:20 - over here that's
72:22 - this paste option you can use the delete
72:24 - and the insert options are there as well
72:26 - so delete is to delete any of the data
72:28 - that's existing and insert to insert the
72:29 - columns so let's just insert a
72:32 - row first of all
72:33 - so this is the row that's been inserted
72:35 - if you just double click over here you
72:36 - can start adding the values so what i'm
72:39 - going to add is name
72:41 - let's say sameer then i'm going to add a
72:44 - value
72:45 - let's say 12 and then i'm going to add a
72:48 - city let's say delhi okay so this is my
72:51 - first value that i have entered read
72:53 - similarly i can add another value let's
72:55 - say
72:58 - a name
73:00 - a value
73:01 - and a city
73:02 - so mumbai okay
73:05 - so this is how i can keep on adding the
73:07 - records manually
73:09 - uh these are the field names right now
73:11 - taken as field one field two and field
73:13 - three but if you want you can change
73:15 - them as well by double clicking on them
73:17 - so the first field name is going to be
73:19 - name
73:20 - the second one is going to be age and
73:23 - the third one is going to be
73:25 - city okay so this is the record that i
73:27 - have got if i just click on run then
73:30 - what would be i getting is this uh hold
73:32 - record in the form of a table like this
73:36 - now let's just see how the import
73:37 - function works so let's just click on
73:39 - import this is the sheet excel sheet
73:41 - that i want to import this is the one
73:43 - that we just exported
73:45 - uh in the form of an excel file so the
73:47 - consumer one is what i'm going to import
73:50 - so uh 10 000 is the sell limit for this
73:52 - tool so that's where the whole sheet was
73:55 - not imported but i'm happy with it
73:57 - let's just click on run
73:58 - now once we do that
74:00 - this whole table is actually a part
74:04 - of this
74:06 - tool this input
74:08 - tool okay a text input tool now this
74:11 - means there is no external file being
74:13 - associated with this if you just delete
74:15 - the excel file then also there would be
74:17 - no change in altrix because altrix has
74:20 - created a copy using the text input tool
74:22 - of this particular dataset right so this
74:25 - is uh the importance of the text input
74:27 - tool over the normal input data tool
74:30 - that we were using up till now
74:32 - but there is an added disadvantage as
74:34 - well because in this case alteryx create
74:36 - another memory of itself to store this
74:39 - data so there would be an additional
74:41 - memory requirement so it depends upon
74:43 - you and the requirement of the
74:46 - particular workflow that whether you
74:49 - want to use the text input tool or the
74:50 - input data tool okay
74:53 - now let's uh save it yeah in case you
74:56 - want to delete it suppose i just don't
74:58 - want this order id column so delete the
75:00 - columns so you can just select the
75:02 - column
75:03 - and delete it
75:04 - if you want to select uh delete a
75:06 - particular row like i want to delete
75:08 - this row number six delete row so the
75:11 - row number six has been deleted okay so
75:13 - this is how the things work in the text
75:15 - input tool you can actually make changes
75:18 - into the data set as well without
75:19 - affecting the original excel file
75:23 - you can copy it and if i just open up my
75:25 - notepad
75:28 - i would be able to paste it as well
75:30 - like six was selected so this has been
75:32 - copied you want to select multiple
75:34 - records like this
75:37 - and copy them
75:39 - then go to notepad
75:41 - and paste them so you would be able to
75:43 - create a copy for them uh for yourself
75:45 - as well okay
75:47 - let's just remove it right now
75:49 - so that's about the text input tool that
75:51 - you need to know now let us talk about
75:53 - the map input tool which is the final
75:55 - tool in this particular group so what is
75:58 - the map input tool as you can see the
76:01 - name itself is suggesting
76:04 - it is used to draw or select the desired
76:06 - map object to use as an input in a
76:08 - workflow
76:09 - you can either draw or select a point
76:12 - line or polygon to form a map that
76:13 - displays a reference base map okay
76:16 - so let's just get this tool map input
76:18 - tool over here and as soon as we get
76:20 - there uh there would be a map
76:23 - you can just select the base map right
76:25 - now it's selected to none
76:27 - let's just select ultra stock so you'd
76:29 - be getting a map you can hover over it
76:31 - uh to just you know
76:32 - load any of the countries or the
76:34 - continents that you like so i'm just
76:36 - going to go all the way to india
76:39 - using the zoom buttons you can zoom in
76:41 - or zoom out
76:43 - and get a location let's say kanpur
76:47 - and here i want to point to kanpur so uh
76:50 - right now as you can see the mode has
76:52 - been set to draw so i can draw anything
76:54 - so we can just get a point to draw it on
76:56 - kanpur
76:57 - over here
76:58 - and if you want to provide it a name so
77:01 - let me just provide it a name as home
77:03 - click on save
77:05 - and that's it you can click on run to
77:07 - run the workflow so what will it do is
77:09 - it will create this kind of a value for
77:11 - you the label is home and the spatial
77:14 - object is point view browse tool map tab
77:17 - so the spatial object has been created
77:20 - using the map input tool hello everyone
77:22 - welcome back to the altrix tutorials in
77:25 - this video we are going to talk about a
77:27 - few tools from the preparation tab in
77:30 - ultrix
77:31 - so first of all we have discussed the
77:33 - tools of the in-out tab that means the
77:35 - tools that would be handy when we are
77:38 - importing the data or exporting it
77:41 - now once we have imported the data we
77:43 - may need to perform some manipulations
77:45 - over the data so we would be looking at
77:47 - the tools that would help us to do the
77:49 - exact same thing the preparation tools
77:52 - okay
77:53 - so first tool that we are going to look
77:55 - for is the auto field tool the auto
77:57 - field tool we have already discussed in
78:00 - the data types video that it is used to
78:02 - read through all of the records of an
78:04 - input and set the field type to the
78:06 - smallest possible size that is related
78:09 - to the data contained in the column
78:11 - so what we are going to do is in this
78:13 - particular video see the practical
78:15 - application of the auto field tool so
78:17 - first of all what i have done is i have
78:19 - already input the data
78:22 - using the uh input data tool so because
78:26 - this is the step that we have done
78:27 - multiple times till now so we do not
78:30 - need to again see it
78:32 - next i have cleansed this data like in
78:34 - the subcategory there were some of the
78:37 - trailing white spaces so i have cleaned
78:39 - it and
78:40 - let me just show you how to clean it
78:42 - real quick the use of this data
78:44 - cleansing tool so let me just remove
78:45 - this tool once
78:48 - from here
78:49 - now how can you clean the data is you
78:51 - can just bring in the data cleansing
78:53 - tool or what you can do is wait for um
78:56 - alteryx to automatically bring it in
78:58 - okay so let's see how to do that
79:00 - so first of all uh you have inputted the
79:02 - data then you need to just search for
79:04 - the inconsistent blocks that is the
79:06 - subcategory go on to these three dots
79:08 - click on data cleanse remove unwanted
79:10 - characters
79:11 - leading slash trailing white space click
79:13 - on apply now once the changes have been
79:16 - applied click on this green tick icon
79:17 - that's okay so now the changes would be
79:20 - applied and you would see the data
79:22 - cleansing tool has been brought in
79:24 - automatically okay
79:26 - now its configuration panel is also
79:28 - present there which you can use to
79:30 - further clean the values but
79:33 - uh now our data is clean so we won't be
79:35 - using it anymore right the next thing we
79:38 - are going to do is use the auto field
79:40 - tool
79:41 - so let's just bring in the auto field
79:42 - tool over here
79:44 - now if you see the data preparation
79:46 - tools all have two anchors the input
79:49 - anchor and the output angle the input
79:51 - anchor is used to take the input data
79:53 - and the output anchor is used to present
79:55 - it further okay
79:56 - so this is the autofill tool as soon as
79:58 - i brought it up there is this
80:00 - configuration panel now here i can
80:02 - select the values through which you want
80:04 - to change the field type okay
80:06 - let's just clear all the values and
80:07 - select only category subcategory and
80:10 - segment from here
80:11 - now once we have selected these fields
80:13 - click on run
80:15 - now what will it do is it would show us
80:17 - the message box that's okay
80:20 - now let's just see the messages that um
80:22 - would actually tell us what changes it
80:24 - had made so uh the field type of segment
80:28 - has been changed to string for eight
80:30 - characters field type of category change
80:32 - to string or 15 characters and that of
80:34 - category to string of 11 characters so
80:37 - this is uh what the change is made by
80:40 - the auto field tool the
80:45 - the changes that it has made in these
80:46 - three fields has been shown to us in
80:48 - case we select all these fields let's
80:50 - select all
80:51 - and click on run for the auto field tool
80:53 - so what we would be getting is
80:57 - this again go to the messages so we
80:59 - would be getting that
81:01 - what fields it has changed to the all
81:04 - these records okay so you can see some
81:05 - of them have been changed to string some
81:07 - of them to variable string
81:09 - and so on
81:10 - like this it has made the changes
81:12 - automatically so this is the use of the
81:13 - auto field tool and the data cleansing
81:16 - tool in the preparation tab
81:18 - now uh let's just save this using ctrl s
81:22 - and move on to the next tool that is the
81:24 - filter tool so filter tool as the name
81:27 - suggests is used to select the data
81:30 - based upon a particular condition
81:33 - uh the rows of the data that made the
81:34 - condition are output to the
81:37 - uh
81:38 - screen in the form of a true anchor and
81:41 - those that do not meet the criteria are
81:43 - output in the form of a false anchor
81:46 - so if we just bring up this filter tool
81:48 - over here you can see it has three
81:50 - anchors the input anchor and in the
81:52 - output it has two anchors the true
81:54 - anchor and the false anchor so we
81:55 - specify a base condition and if the data
81:58 - meets the base condition then it goes
82:00 - into the true anchor otherwise it goes
82:02 - into the false anchor okay so let's see
82:04 - with the example
82:06 - let's click on this filter tool
82:08 - over here so this kind of a
82:10 - configuration box would be there now
82:12 - there are two kinds of filters that we
82:13 - can apply the basic filter or the custom
82:16 - filter in the case of the basic filter
82:17 - we can specify the basic information
82:19 - like if the um
82:22 - criteria is being matched or not if you
82:26 - want to apply some complex operations
82:28 - then we use the custom filters custom
82:30 - filters allow us to add functionalities
82:33 - to add mathematical functions the
82:36 - boolean values the if else statements
82:38 - and many more things which we would be
82:40 - of course seeing one by one but first of
82:42 - all let's take a look at the basic
82:44 - filter
82:45 - so if you remember uh we had a column
82:47 - called category
82:49 - in this we had some categories like the
82:51 - furniture technology and the office of
82:53 - place so what i'm going to do is i'm
82:55 - going to assign the furnitures
82:58 - separately that means all the categories
83:00 - where furniture is the category it would
83:02 - be assigned to a true value right so
83:04 - from the basic filter let's just select
83:06 - the column the column name is going to
83:08 - be the category column
83:10 - and equals
83:11 - let's just type in the value furniture
83:15 - okay now once you have typed it you can
83:18 - just click on run to run the workflow
83:21 - and then you would see that
83:24 - okay
83:26 - we have two anchors the true anchor if
83:28 - you just hover over it it would give you
83:30 - the category furniture and then we have
83:32 - is the false anchor for the category
83:34 - furniture okay
83:36 - now here are all the records that are
83:37 - being displayed in the output panel for
83:39 - the true value here you can see this is
83:40 - the true value being shown
83:42 - there are a
83:44 - 1113 records that belong to the category
83:48 - furniture okay
83:49 - so if you hover over it the category
83:51 - here is furniture only furniture
83:54 - all the way furniture but if you go to
83:56 - the false value
83:57 - then what we have is the category
83:59 - technology and office applies
84:02 - great let's just add another filter
84:04 - anchor over here into the false part
84:07 - where what we would be doing is adding
84:09 - another base filter on the basis of the
84:11 - category let's just select the category
84:13 - again
84:15 - and it must be equal to technology
84:18 - technology
84:21 - over here okay
84:22 - click on run
84:26 - and here
84:28 - so now we again have these true false
84:31 - values for this so in the true there
84:33 - would be the technology values
84:35 - and in the false there would be the
84:37 - office applies values so this is how we
84:39 - have used the basic filter tool to
84:42 - actually create three separate uh values
84:46 - for these like the furniture categories
84:48 - are separate the
84:49 - technology is separate and the office
84:51 - supplies is now separate and we separate
84:53 - records okay so this is how the basic uh
84:55 - filter is being used now what i'm going
84:57 - to do is just i'm going to copy these
84:59 - two fields or these two tools that is
85:01 - the input tool and the data cleansing
85:03 - tool into a new workflow
85:06 - and show you the demonstration of the
85:10 - filter tool for the custom filter okay
85:13 - so let's just bring in our tool over
85:15 - here connect it
85:19 - and here let's select a custom filter
85:22 - right so here is the effects which you
85:24 - can use to apply any of these conditions
85:26 - or any of these functions like you want
85:28 - to convert it
85:31 - right or you want to perform any kind of
85:34 - a manipulation over here you want to
85:37 - apply any of the conditional statements
85:39 - if you want to
85:41 - allow any date time
85:43 - uh applications any of the file
85:44 - applications that you can do over here
85:47 - like the string functions
85:50 - so let's just use the count words
85:53 - so i basically needed to count the words
85:56 - okay and then
85:57 - from this x you can just select the
85:59 - existing columns so i want it to select
86:01 - the count words for the city
86:03 - click on run
86:07 - and then
86:11 - uh it's going to give you the values for
86:15 - of course there won't be any false
86:16 - values right now because there could not
86:18 - be any false values for the count
86:20 - function
86:22 - and it would give you
86:24 - the count of the characters of the
86:26 - cities right
86:31 - or basically what we can do is actually
86:34 - use any kind of a basic filter like
86:37 - let's say if the profit
86:39 - is greater than equal to one
86:42 - so that would be a profit
86:44 - right so we have written a basic filter
86:46 - query but if you want to see how it is
86:48 - looking in the custom filter there you
86:50 - can apply it profit is greater than
86:51 - equal to one
86:52 - now if you just run it
86:54 - what you would be getting is in the two
86:56 - values the true and the false values
86:58 - so that means the records where we are
87:01 - getting a profit and the records where
87:02 - we are getting a loss in the case of the
87:04 - true are the ones where we are getting a
87:06 - profit here you can see all of these
87:07 - values we are getting a profit
87:09 - but in these values we are getting a
87:11 - loss you can see this is a loss okay so
87:14 - you just go to the messages um
87:17 - you would get that in the 4008 records
87:19 - there were the true values that means
87:21 - there is where we are getting a profit
87:24 - and the remaining 1183 values written
87:26 - false that means these are the values
87:28 - where we are getting a loss so this is
87:31 - the usage of the filter tool
87:34 - in altrix and this is how we use it so
87:36 - that's all for this video thanks for
87:38 - watching
87:40 - hello everyone welcome back to the
87:42 - altrix tutorials in this video we are
87:44 - going to discuss about some more uh
87:47 - tools that are present in the data
87:49 - preparation group in excel
87:51 - uh in ultrix so the first tool that we
87:53 - are going to look in this is the formula
87:56 - tool
87:56 - so the formula tool is actually used to
87:59 - create
88:00 - new columns uh update the columns or
88:03 - use the expressions to perform a variety
88:06 - of the calculations on the already
88:08 - existing values
88:11 - that are present in the columns okay so
88:15 - we can use it to apply conditional
88:17 - statements convert uh the data type from
88:20 - one to another format the dates extract
88:22 - file paths apply algorithms clean the
88:25 - data apply the validations or
88:29 - perform the tests etc okay so let us see
88:32 - how are we going to use this formula
88:34 - tool
88:36 - so right now i have got the same data
88:39 - set that is the consumer sheet from the
88:42 - sample store data set okay
88:45 - and i have cleansed it
88:47 - that is removed the inconsistencies now
88:49 - let's just bring up our formula tool
88:52 - to here
88:54 - and in this what i'm going to do is uh
88:56 - in the configuration panel i have two
88:58 - options either i can just select a
89:00 - column and that data would be
89:03 - overwritten or i can add a new column so
89:05 - what i'm going to do is i'm actually i'm
89:07 - going to add a new column so add a
89:09 - column and then you go to specify the
89:12 - name of the column so that's going to be
89:16 - profit
89:17 - slash
89:18 - loss okay
89:20 - and here what i'm going to do is apply a
89:22 - conditional statement
89:24 - that
89:26 - uh
89:28 - this conditional statement
89:31 - if the value of the profit so for
89:34 - getting the column names we can simply
89:36 - just use a square bracket
89:38 - so we have the profit value over here
89:42 - if the profit value is greater than
89:45 - equals to 0
89:46 - then
89:47 - the value in this column is going to be
89:49 - profit
89:52 - else it is going to be
89:54 - loss okay
89:56 - like this and whatever the tax for value
89:58 - you want you need to just write it in
90:00 - the single quotes okay
90:02 - so the size we can just specify over
90:06 - here it's going to be the data type we
90:08 - can check is
90:11 - going to be the variable string
90:12 - and click on run
90:16 - now it's going to take a few seconds 1.6
90:19 - seconds to be precise
90:20 - and as you can see
90:23 - uh we should be getting
90:25 - a new column over here
90:30 - and here on the very last uh you can see
90:33 - the column profit and loss if the values
90:36 - are positive then we are getting the
90:38 - value profit if it is negative then we
90:40 - are getting the value loss okay
90:43 - uh so here is a warning in the profit
90:45 - that
90:46 - the there was a large value over here
90:48 - but it has been rounded up by alteryx
90:50 - for clarity okay so that's why the
90:53 - red
90:54 - uh
90:55 - is being shown over here the rate mark
90:57 - has been shown over here so this is one
90:59 - way of using the formula tool right um
91:02 - just like this you can actually make
91:05 - changes into the existing data like um
91:10 - right now if you just don't want to add
91:12 - an extra column so we want to apply
91:14 - another formula
91:16 - and the thing is that i want to get
91:20 - the profit and the loss the same thing
91:23 - but in this column only that is the
91:25 - value that is showing me profit in that
91:27 - value only i want this to happen so i
91:30 - can just select the column
91:31 - and here i'm just going to select the
91:33 - profit column okay
91:35 - now if i just click on run then what
91:37 - would happen is the values in that
91:39 - particular column would be overwritten
91:43 - okay so there is an error
91:46 - uh the thing is that
91:48 - we wanted string value but the field is
91:50 - numeric so that's why it's not happening
91:52 - so let me just change it a little bit
91:55 - that is
91:57 - over here
91:59 - if there is a profit then i want 100 to
92:02 - be written over there
92:04 - else i want 0 to be written over here
92:07 - okay or i can just actually you know
92:12 - uh
92:12 - change its data type as well like it's
92:15 - double so 100 and 0 would be okay
92:17 - let's click on run
92:21 - now if you just go to this output panel
92:25 - and here we have only two values hundred
92:27 - and zero hundred and zero so this is how
92:29 - you can actually update the existing
92:31 - values or create a new column
92:33 - now in case you want to remove any
92:35 - formula you can just go to that formula
92:37 - and here is this delete button you can
92:39 - just delete that
92:40 - and now if you again run it then the
92:43 - changes that were made initially would
92:45 - be overwritten and you would be getting
92:47 - the original values of the profit that
92:49 - were present in the call
92:51 - so this is how we work with the formula
92:53 - tool
92:54 - to either add new columns or update the
92:57 - existing columns right
92:59 - next tool that we are going to talk
93:00 - about is the sample tool so let's just
93:03 - go to the sample tool
93:04 - now what is the sample tool it is used
93:07 - to limit the data stream to a specified
93:09 - number percentage or a random set of
93:11 - rows
93:12 - uh also if you want a selected
93:14 - configuration to the columns so
93:18 - to be applied you can group the columns
93:20 - using the sample tool so let's just get
93:22 - the sample tool
93:23 - over here
93:25 - and as soon as we get it this is the
93:27 - configuration panel that we are getting
93:28 - the first option is the first n rows
93:31 - uh it returns every row in the data from
93:34 - the beginning to the data through the
93:35 - value of n
93:36 - like you can specify a value of n here
93:38 - you can see
93:39 - right now if you just run it so it would
93:42 - return the first hundred rows as you can
93:44 - see first hundred has been shown over
93:45 - here because the value of n was hundred
93:47 - but if we just set it to 10
93:50 - and then run it so what will it do is it
93:53 - would just show you the first 10 rows
93:56 - okay so you can set the value of n
93:59 - next option is last and rows which of
94:01 - course is used
94:02 - to show us the last
94:04 - n rows the value of n which you can
94:06 - specify
94:08 - as per your wish
94:09 - next is skip first n rows which returns
94:13 - all the rows in the data that start
94:16 - after the specified number of rows
94:18 - next we have one of every n rows that
94:21 - means return the first row of every
94:23 - group of n rows like if i just select n
94:26 - so the whole record would be
94:29 - split into groups of 10 and the first
94:32 - row in each group would be returned to
94:34 - me
94:35 - so if you just run it
94:38 - then we would be able to see the changes
94:40 - like
94:42 - through this row id like 1 then 12 then
94:44 - 26 and 48 this is how the rows are being
94:47 - returned to me okay
94:49 - next is one in chan one in n chance to
94:52 - include each row
94:54 - that means
94:55 - it would return randomly it would
94:57 - randomly determine if each row is
94:59 - included in the sample or not so the
95:02 - random values are being
95:04 - uh returned to me as you can see from
95:06 - the row id itself 11 then 20 then 21
95:09 - randomly the rows are being
95:11 - returned to me
95:12 - okay so um
95:16 - then we have the first n percent of rows
95:19 - that means it returns the n percent in
95:22 - this case the 10 percent
95:24 - of rows it requires the data to pass
95:26 - through the tool twice like once we
95:29 - calculate the count of rows and then to
95:30 - return the specified percent of rows
95:33 - okay then we can just run it to get the
95:35 - n percent of rows that's the ten percent
95:37 - of the rows or of the total values okay
95:40 - so they were around 5000 uh
95:43 - 191 records so 519 records that's the 10
95:46 - of the records have been displayed over
95:48 - here okay
95:49 - next we have is the group by option so
95:51 - if you want to group it uh on the basis
95:53 - of some column that you can do let's
95:55 - just group it by category
95:58 - and
96:00 - just get the first 10 rows to be grouped
96:02 - by category we can click on run
96:05 - so this is what we would be getting
96:07 - in the output
96:10 - okay
96:12 - so furniture categories then the office
96:14 - supplies categories and the technology
96:15 - categories have been used to group by
96:17 - the values so this is how the sample
96:20 - tool works for us
96:23 - ah
96:24 - next we have is the
96:27 - sort tool
96:28 - so the sort tool is actually
96:31 - very important and as the name suggests
96:33 - it is used to sort the data
96:35 - so um
96:37 - let's see how it works it actually takes
96:40 - two
96:41 - things into consideration let's just get
96:43 - the sort tool over here
96:45 - it takes two things into consideration
96:47 - the name and the order so basically
96:50 - uh any of the
96:52 - name
96:53 - of the field
96:54 - that you want to sort and in which order
96:56 - you want to sort if in the ascending
96:57 - order of in the descending order okay
97:00 - so let's just uh delete this tool once
97:03 - and let's see how we manually apply it
97:04 - like without using this tool okay so now
97:07 - if we just run this
97:09 - we would be getting our hands on the
97:11 - data set
97:14 - okay
97:17 - yeah so if you want to sort the values
97:19 - like i want to sort it on the basis of
97:21 - the sales so let's just go to the sales
97:23 - column
97:24 - or click on these three dots
97:26 - go to sort
97:27 - and i want to sort it on the basis of
97:29 - the ascending order then click on apply
97:32 - so once we do that we can click on this
97:34 - red
97:35 - this green tick button
97:37 - and you would see that it has been
97:39 - applied if you just click on the output
97:42 - actually run the workflow
97:46 - so here is what we would be getting the
97:48 - sorted values
97:50 - like you can see the value have been
97:51 - sorted on the basis of the sales the
97:53 - ascending order the sort tool has
97:56 - already been applied and the name is
97:57 - taken as sales and the order is taken as
97:59 - ascending so this is the usage of the
98:01 - sort tool that's all for this video
98:03 - thanks for watching
98:06 - hello everyone welcome to altrix
98:07 - tutorials in this video we are going to
98:10 - see the three most important tools in
98:13 - the data preparation tab of altrics the
98:16 - first tool that we are going to see is
98:18 - the unique tool
98:19 - as the name suggests
98:21 - unique is used to distinguish that
98:23 - whether a data record is unique or if it
98:26 - is duplicate by grouping on one or more
98:29 - specified fields
98:31 - then
98:32 - it sorts those fields so if you want
98:34 - some of the fields to be unique then you
98:36 - can simply check it using this unique
98:38 - tool that whether the particular field
98:41 - or particular column is actually
98:44 - containing unique values or not
98:46 - so how can we use it let's just get this
98:48 - tool
98:50 - uh just like the filter tool we have
98:51 - used the unique tool also has three
98:54 - anchors one is the anchor where it gets
98:56 - the data the next two anchors are the
98:57 - unique and the duplicate anchors as you
98:59 - can see the u and the d
99:02 - so it basically shows you that
99:04 - which of the values are unique and which
99:06 - of them are not okay
99:08 - now this is the configuration panel from
99:10 - where you can just select the values
99:12 - like i would select the customer name
99:15 - i want to check that if the customer is
99:17 - returning to me or not
99:19 - so if i just click on run
99:21 - then
99:23 - okay
99:24 - i'm getting uh some of the unique values
99:26 - so there are 409 records where the
99:28 - customer name is unique so there are 409
99:31 - unique customers i'm also getting
99:34 - duplicates that means the customers we
99:36 - have are the returning customers and now
99:39 - all of these values are grouped together
99:40 - as a customer name like first you can
99:42 - see aaron bergman
99:44 - so the customer uh whatever purchases
99:47 - the customer has made is being grouped
99:50 - together by his name then
99:52 - by this second customer third customer
99:54 - and so on okay so these are the uni
99:56 - customers the total of 409 customers are
99:59 - there and they're returning to me again
100:00 - and again to purchase a total of 10 000
100:03 - uh record items okay so this is what the
100:07 - unique tool helps us to understand about
100:09 - the data now uh you have applied it on
100:12 - one field but if you want you can apply
100:14 - it on multiple fields like for the
100:16 - category also i want to apply
100:18 - then click on run
100:20 - now what will happen is
100:22 - uh we would be getting the unique values
100:24 - for
100:26 - uh the combination of both right so now
100:29 - the in the unique value over here the
100:32 - total of 1136 records have been
100:34 - displayed the customer name uh if they
100:37 - have purchased from each of these
100:38 - categories right so in the category
100:40 - there are these three categories
100:42 - furniture office supplies and technology
100:43 - and the customer name as you can see
100:46 - is same
100:48 - for the three and the remaining are the
100:50 - duplicates which means the customer has
100:52 - made another purchase in the same
100:54 - category of the items so this is the
100:56 - usage of the unique tool okay
100:59 - now let's move on to the next tool that
101:01 - is the imputation tool now what is the
101:03 - imputation tool
101:06 - imputation tool is used to replace a
101:08 - specified value within one or more
101:11 - numeric data fields with another
101:13 - specified value so basically it's used
101:16 - that if your data is inconsistent
101:18 - and contain some of the null values then
101:20 - what you can do is actually clean the
101:22 - data set
101:23 - so you can replace the null values with
101:26 - either the average of the values of that
101:28 - particular column or
101:30 - um basically with any value that you
101:33 - want okay so let's just get the
101:34 - imputation tool to get a better look at
101:37 - how it works
101:38 - over here
101:40 - so here you would get the fields which
101:42 - you want to impute now only the numeric
101:44 - fields would be there because that's
101:46 - what we get for the imputation rule now
101:48 - what value you want to replace if there
101:50 - are null values you can replace those
101:52 - null values but if the null values are
101:53 - not present then you can use a user
101:56 - specified value next we have is the
101:58 - replace with value that is with which
102:00 - value you want to replace it so average
102:02 - that means average of all values not
102:04 - including the incoming values to replace
102:07 - okay so basically
102:09 - the values that are already existing
102:10 - those average would be taken and that
102:12 - would be replaced in place of null
102:14 - values we have a median value that is
102:16 - the value separating the higher half
102:18 - from the lower half or the middle value
102:20 - we have the mode value that the value
102:22 - that appears most often
102:24 - or if you want to use a specified value
102:26 - that you want to replace that you can do
102:28 - okay so what i'm going to do is actually
102:30 - just work for the
102:32 - quantity part over here
102:34 - since i know that my data set is clean
102:36 - it has no null values so i'm just going
102:38 - to check a user specified value of 7
102:41 - and i'm going to specify another value
102:43 - for it that is going to be 8 okay that's
102:46 - a minor change that i'm just going to do
102:48 - of course it would be undone because it
102:50 - has no meaning it's just to show you the
102:52 - usage of this tool
102:54 - next we have these two check boxes that
102:56 - is include imputed value in the
102:57 - indicator field that means there would
102:59 - be a field that would be added to
103:01 - specify whether or not a value has been
103:03 - imputed
103:04 - or you want to output the imputed value
103:06 - in a separate field that means the
103:08 - original field would be as it is but in
103:11 - a separate field the value would be
103:13 - outputted the imputed value okay so
103:15 - first of all let's just select the first
103:17 - option and run it to see how it works
103:21 - here it would take few seconds and then
103:27 - let's just see if it has worked for the
103:30 - quantity
103:31 - so now here we can see that um
103:34 - it's eight and the quantity indicator is
103:37 - showing 1 that means the change has been
103:39 - made over here and on the rest of the
103:41 - values it's showing 0. again it's
103:43 - showing 1 that means the value was
103:45 - originally 7 but now it has been changed
103:46 - to 8.
103:48 - so this is how the imputed value
103:50 - indicator field works next option is the
103:52 - output imputed values as a separate
103:54 - field so we can just select this option
103:56 - and click on run
103:58 - now what would happen is
104:02 - we would be getting a separate value in
104:04 - which the quantity value original field
104:06 - would be as it is like here it was seven
104:09 - but in the new values the field would uh
104:11 - new field the values would be eight over
104:13 - here from seven it changed to eight so
104:16 - this is how the imputation works but
104:19 - if the null values are present on your
104:21 - data or if you want to replace of any of
104:23 - the values numeric values only then you
104:25 - can use this imputation tool
104:27 - right
104:28 - now last but not the least we have the
104:30 - multi-field binning tool now what is
104:32 - this tool
104:35 - it is actually uh used to replicate some
104:38 - of the functionality of the tile tool
104:40 - okay
104:41 - um
104:42 - basically it allows the data to be
104:44 - binned on multiple fields
104:48 - mainly it is used for the predictive
104:49 - tool set
104:51 - multi-field billing tool accepts only
104:54 - the numeric fields just like the
104:56 - imputation tool we have just seen
104:58 - for the purpose of pinning we can pin
105:01 - the fields either
105:02 - in the form of the equal records or
105:04 - equal intervals so what is a bin
105:07 - uh
105:08 - if you just take a look at a histogram
105:10 - let's just bring up a histogram here
105:13 - right so this is a histogram and as you
105:16 - can see it shows the salary
105:19 - and the number of the players so 0 to 10
105:23 - is actually an interval 10 to 20 is an
105:26 - interval right so
105:28 - this is called a bin histogram is
105:31 - depicted using bins and in order to
105:34 - create those bins
105:36 - we are going to use the multi-field
105:38 - binning tool in ultrix so let's see how
105:40 - it works
105:42 - uh let's just get this
105:45 - over here
105:46 - and it would get all the numeric fields
105:48 - i'm going to do it on the basis of the
105:50 - sales
105:51 - the number of the tiles or the bins that
105:53 - you want to create so i want to create
105:55 - it 10
105:57 - tiles or the 10 bills now we have uh two
106:00 - options either equal records or equal
106:02 - intervals equal records what it says
106:04 - that the input records are divided into
106:07 - the specified number of pins each bin is
106:09 - assigned to
106:10 - assign the same number of records okay
106:12 - so the number of records would be equal
106:14 - in each bin
106:16 - um
106:17 - then we have equal intervals that means
106:19 - the minimum and the maximum values
106:21 - of the selected fields are determined
106:24 - and the records are assigned based upon
106:26 - these ranges so if we go with equal
106:29 - intervals that would be like more
106:31 - appropriate to get
106:33 - a varied length of the histogram
106:35 - then you can click on run
106:39 - so after a few seconds you would be
106:41 - getting
106:42 - this field
106:47 - uh it's on the base of sales right
106:51 - uh here is the field uh sales style num
106:54 - so what is the tile number all right now
106:56 - it's one
106:57 - and as you can see this one has um
107:00 - higher sales value of 1706 that's why
107:02 - it's been assigned to tile two
107:05 - and just like this if you just scroll
107:06 - over it you will get some other numbers
107:08 - as well
107:10 - so it's one two
107:12 - one and two and that was five over here
107:16 - it has a higher range of six thousand
107:17 - that's why it's been given a number five
107:19 - so just like this
107:21 - we have binned our sales records if you
107:23 - just get it into equal number of records
107:25 - and click on run
107:27 - so
107:28 - the records would be given
107:30 - two different bins
107:32 - uh equally like as you can see the
107:34 - different bins have been assigned
107:37 - the different bins have been assigned to
107:38 - each of these sales values okay
107:41 - so as we have specified 10 so uh the 10
107:45 - tiles have been created and the maximum
107:47 - of a thousand tiles we can create
107:49 - so any number between
107:51 - 1 to 999 is acceptable so this is the
107:54 - function of the multi-field binning tool
107:57 - and these are all the major tools that
107:59 - you need to know about in the
108:01 - preparation group in alteryx that's all
108:03 - for this video and that's all for the
108:05 - preparation tools in altrix in the next
108:07 - video we would be looking at the other
108:10 - group which is the join group that's all
108:12 - for this video thanks for watching
108:16 - hello everyone welcome to alteryx
108:18 - tutorials in this video we are going to
108:21 - take a look at some of the tools
108:23 - that are present in the join tab of the
108:26 - alteryx tools
108:27 - in the previous videos we have already
108:29 - seen the in-out tab and the preparation
108:32 - tab and their individual tools that are
108:34 - going to be useful for us
108:36 - while preparing the workflows in altrix
108:40 - in this video we are going to start a
108:41 - new tab that is the join tab so without
108:44 - any further ado let us start with the
108:46 - video in this video we are going to talk
108:48 - about a very special tool known as the
108:50 - append fields tool this append fields
108:53 - tool is present in the join tab as you
108:55 - can see denoted by a purple color
108:58 - now before starting with this tool what
109:00 - i have already done is i have already
109:02 - input my data that is the sample
109:05 - superstore data
109:07 - and from that data set i have taken the
109:09 - orders sheet
109:11 - in case you don't know where to get this
109:13 - data from you can simply google sample
109:14 - super store excel and that data site
109:17 - would be downloaded for you the reason
109:19 - why we are choosing this data set is
109:20 - because it is having a wide variety of
109:23 - data ranging from text to numbers
109:25 - location everything that one could ask
109:28 - for furthermore the data set is
109:30 - completely clean there are no
109:31 - inconsistencies so it would be easier
109:33 - for us to work on it
109:35 - and
109:36 - once you have downloaded the data set
109:37 - using the
109:39 - input tool you can simply just input the
109:41 - data then i have used two data cleansing
109:43 - tools
109:44 - which are in the preparation tab to
109:47 - clean the data
109:48 - now
109:49 - in case you're wondering what i have
109:51 - done over here i recommend you to just
109:52 - go through the previous videos where
109:54 - i've explained this process in a
109:55 - step-by-step fashion
109:57 - now once we have done with all this let
109:59 - us just go back to our append fields
110:01 - tool and bring it up over here
110:03 - as you can see the append fields tool
110:05 - has two anchors on the input that is t
110:08 - and s
110:10 - t stands for target and s stands for
110:12 - source and there is one output anchor so
110:15 - let us understand first of all what is
110:17 - this tool all about append fields tool
110:19 - is used to append the fields of one
110:21 - small input which is taken as a source
110:24 - denoted by the s over here to every
110:26 - record of another larger input that is
110:28 - the target
110:30 - the result is a cartesian join now in a
110:33 - cartesian join every row from one table
110:35 - is joined to every row of the other
110:37 - table like if there are two tables uh
110:40 - table one has like hundred rows and
110:41 - table two has thousand rows so the
110:43 - cartesian join would be 100 into
110:45 - thousand that is a hundred thousand rows
110:47 - in total
110:49 - so this is what happens in the cartesian
110:50 - join and in case you want to perform a
110:53 - cartesian join on your tables then you
110:55 - can use this append fields option okay
110:57 - the append field tool accepts two inputs
110:59 - which is again a target and a source the
111:02 - target is a larger data stream and the
111:03 - source is a smaller data stream that
111:06 - provides the records that are added to
111:08 - the target stream okay
111:10 - now in order to configure the tool here
111:12 - we can see the configuration panel over
111:14 - here
111:15 - we can use this table to modify the
111:16 - incoming data stream
111:18 - uh here each row is representing an
111:21 - individual column in the table as you
111:23 - can see row id order id order date ship
111:25 - date shipment etc
111:27 - now here what are the options what are
111:29 - the things that we can do is
111:32 - we can modify the type of the column
111:34 - like right now it's double but if you
111:37 - want to change it to anything else you
111:38 - can change it like i want int 16 over
111:40 - here so that its size also decreases if
111:43 - in the case of the strings you want to
111:44 - change the size you can do that as well
111:47 - if you want to rename a column that also
111:49 - you can do like instead of the row id i
111:51 - want s number to be present over here
111:53 - serial number okay
111:55 - so sno is what i want to
111:58 - rename it
111:59 - in case you want to provide a
112:00 - description for your columns that you
112:02 - can also provide
112:05 - now what would happen is once the
112:07 - correlation join is performed this is
112:08 - how the columns would be treated like
112:10 - with the description with the renamed
112:11 - value and with the modified type over
112:13 - here okay
112:14 - now uh this is a one thing that you can
112:17 - do now in case you want to select
112:18 - multiple fields like this
112:20 - then there is this options button that
112:22 - is present there are a bunch of options
112:24 - that you can use like save or load
112:26 - that means you can save the field
112:28 - configuration as a dot y x f t file
112:32 - uh which is ultrix field type file um
112:35 - that can be used in other workflows
112:37 - as well
112:39 - then we can use the select option to
112:41 - either select all of the columns or
112:43 - deselect them all
112:44 - we can change the field type of the
112:46 - highlighted fields this is only
112:48 - available if all the fields that you
112:50 - have highlighted are the same type so
112:52 - you can just change them to
112:54 - a common or a mutual type right
112:57 - next we have is the sort option which is
112:59 - of course used to sort the columns
113:02 - in assigning all the descending orders
113:03 - like uh sort on the original field name
113:06 - on a new field name on the field type or
113:08 - revert to the incoming field auto next
113:11 - we have is the move option that is used
113:13 - to move the highlighted columns to the
113:14 - top or the bottom of the list if you
113:16 - want to perform this option
113:19 - if you want to add some prefix to the
113:21 - field names if you want to add suffix to
113:22 - the field names if you want to remove
113:24 - any prefix remove any suffix or if you
113:26 - want to uh clear all the renames that
113:29 - you have done so far that you can do
113:32 - using this uh if you want uh the
113:34 - highlighted fields only whose renames
113:36 - you want to clear that also you can do
113:38 - reward all the original type and size
113:40 - that means all of the changes that you
113:41 - have done would be
113:43 - unchanged
113:44 - and
113:46 - so on these are all the options that we
113:48 - have available next we have is
113:52 - this option one slash error on too many
113:55 - records being generated so
113:57 - uh in this append fields tool it
113:59 - performs a cartesian join which means
114:01 - the number of the rows of both of these
114:04 - tables are actually multiplied with one
114:06 - another that means a huge number of rows
114:08 - would be generated right
114:09 - so
114:10 - it is a possibility that unintentionally
114:13 - you can produce so many errors
114:16 - so you can configure the warnings or
114:18 - errors to be reported so that not too
114:21 - many records are being produced
114:23 - now for this we have three options allow
114:25 - all appends that means all records
114:27 - should be appended to all the records
114:29 - with no error or warning
114:31 - next is one appends of more than three
114:33 - 16 records
114:35 - like if there are more than 16 records
114:37 - in the source file
114:38 - a warning is reported and the workflow
114:40 - continues processing
114:42 - third option is error on appends of more
114:45 - than 16 records so if there are more
114:47 - than 16 records in the source file
114:49 - then the error is reported and the
114:51 - workflow stops it processing so it is
114:54 - just to save the memory and provide a
114:57 - fail safe in case of the errors right so
115:00 - i'm going to go with all allow all
115:02 - appends just for this case to show you
115:04 - how this tool is gonna work okay
115:08 - so here i have actually um
115:11 - run the append fields tool let me
115:13 - explain to you quickly that what i have
115:14 - done
115:15 - uh the target we have already taken
115:20 - in the case of source what we have done
115:22 - is we have taken a few records around
115:25 - 5000 records for the source now where
115:27 - these records come from
115:29 - from the target itself we created three
115:32 - separate excel sheets on the basis of
115:34 - segment so if you just go to this
115:36 - particular data here you will find that
115:39 - there is this field called segment it
115:41 - has three possible values consumer home
115:44 - office and corporate
115:47 - these are the three segments okay so uh
115:50 - these three excel sheets were created in
115:52 - one excel sheet all the consumer related
115:54 - records were there in another there were
115:56 - all corporate related records and so on
115:59 - so just like that i have taken one more
116:01 - excel sheet which contains all the
116:03 - consumer records now this would act as
116:05 - my source because source is usually
116:07 - smaller in size than the target
116:09 - so a total of
116:11 - 5191 records were in this and a total of
116:14 - 9994 records were in this as you can see
116:17 - over here the number of the records is
116:19 - shown
116:20 - so what i have done is uh i have used
116:23 - these two things in the append tool and
116:26 - run this
116:27 - after running it i applied a browse tool
116:30 - the browse tool is nothing but it helps
116:33 - us to you know
116:35 - see that what is going on inside the
116:37 - tool if you just uh click over this
116:40 - append fields tool then you will see
116:41 - that this is the targets field
116:44 - it is same the changes that we did here
116:46 - that was renaming the serial name number
116:48 - row id to serial number is not been
116:50 - reflected over here and in the source we
116:52 - have the row id again with all the
116:54 - records present over here
116:56 - but as soon as we added the browse tool
116:59 - and click on run then it is going to
117:01 - show me the updated records like how
117:04 - many records were taken from there so a
117:06 - 5191 records from the consumer that
117:09 - means the source and 9994 records from
117:12 - the orders sheet that is the actual data
117:14 - set now it's going to take a few seconds
117:16 - and here you can see the percentage of
117:19 - the process that has been completed
117:22 - uh and
117:23 - along with this you can see the memory
117:24 - that it is being occupied right now it's
117:26 - 4.9 gb so let's just give it a few
117:29 - seconds
117:30 - and uh see what happens when it's fully
117:32 - run so let us make after it's completed
117:35 - fully after it's fully executed
117:39 - now uh the whole process has run
117:42 - and you can see uh due to the browse
117:45 - tool we are able to see
117:47 - that uh the first row that was row id
117:50 - initially has been changed to serial
117:52 - number
117:53 - and now we are getting uh
117:56 - the combination of the records that is
117:58 - um
117:59 - target
118:00 - the number of rows of the target
118:02 - multiplied by the number of rows of the
118:03 - source so this is the total number of
118:06 - records that we are getting and this is
118:07 - the size that is 7.9 gb so this is how
118:10 - the append fields tool or the cartesian
118:12 - join works in altrics that's all for
118:14 - this video thanks for watching
118:17 - hello everyone welcome back to the
118:19 - altrex tutorials in this video we are
118:21 - going to talk about
118:23 - very important tools that are present in
118:25 - the join tab of the altrex tool now
118:28 - these tools are the find and the replace
118:30 - tool as the name suggests they help you
118:32 - to find for the values and if you want
118:34 - to replace your found value with any
118:36 - other value
118:37 - so for that also this tool is used okay
118:40 - so here in the workflow as you can
118:42 - already see i have input the data that
118:44 - is the sample superstore data
118:46 - and i have applied two data cleansing
118:48 - operations
118:49 - so this i have already explained in the
118:51 - previous videos in case you have not
118:53 - seen the videos i would recommend you to
118:54 - go and watch them to easily understand
118:56 - that what's going on here
118:57 - now once your data is clean let us make
119:00 - use of the fine and replace tool it is
119:02 - present in the joined app so here is the
119:03 - join nav and here is the finance replace
119:05 - tool let me just drag it over here
119:07 - now uh let us understand this tool it is
119:10 - used to find a string in one column of a
119:12 - data set and look up and replace it with
119:14 - the specified value from another data
119:16 - set right
119:18 - so you can use it to append columns uh
119:20 - as well
119:22 - uh
119:23 - now
119:24 - if we take a look at the configuration
119:26 - tab we have this find section and the
119:28 - replay section there are two different
119:30 - sections right in the find section we
119:32 - have these three radio buttons that can
119:34 - be chosen as per our wish
119:37 - first is beginning of field that
119:38 - searches for the instance of the field
119:40 - value at the beginning of the field
119:42 - the entire field does not have to
119:44 - contain what is being searched for
119:46 - next we have any part of the field which
119:49 - means it would search for the instance
119:50 - of the field value in any part of the
119:52 - field the entire field again does not
119:55 - have to be containing what is being
119:57 - searched for
119:58 - third is the entire field that it would
120:00 - search for the instance of the field
120:02 - value contained within the entire field
120:05 - the instance must be there in its
120:07 - entirety to be replaced with a new value
120:10 - then we have find within field option
120:13 - which is used to select the field in the
120:15 - table with the data to be replaced
120:18 - f is the input anchor
120:20 - by the data in the reference table and r
120:22 - is the input anchor
120:25 - uh that is being specified by which data
120:27 - to be replaced
120:28 - okay next we have is the find value that
120:31 - is um used to select the field from the
120:33 - reference table that is the r
120:35 - that contains the same values as the
120:37 - find within table in the original table
120:40 - okay
120:41 - next we have the case and sensor define
120:43 - and match the whole world only so
120:46 - what we will do is if we take a look at
120:49 - this orders table this we would be
120:51 - connecting to the replace okay next we
120:54 - would be getting another in out and let
120:56 - me just get the input data
120:59 - here what i have done is let me just
121:01 - move it a little bit here
121:04 - so what i have done uh is i have made
121:06 - some changes into the subcategory field
121:08 - and the category fields okay
121:10 - so what i'm gonna do is just
121:13 - first of all get the file over here
121:17 - and this is the file that i want
121:25 - yeah
121:26 - so here let's just click on ok
121:32 - and connect it to the find values okay
121:35 - so it is going to
121:36 - find the values and replace it okay
121:40 - so let me just go back to this tool
121:43 - if i just click on the output anchor of
121:45 - this first field what we would be
121:48 - getting here
121:51 - is 100 records actually
121:54 - and here you can see the uh sub category
121:57 - chairs is having a different spelling
122:00 - means there are some of the white spaces
122:01 - but in the case of this the output angle
122:04 - of the data cleansed field
122:06 - we'll find that in the subcategory
122:09 - the chairs are correct okay so we need
122:11 - to find the value of choose and replace
122:13 - it with this that means the subcategory
122:15 - field would be employed so let's just
122:17 - click on this uh entire field
122:20 - sub category and replace it with a
122:23 - subcategory value okay
122:25 - and
122:26 - that's the case in sensitive fine or
122:28 - let's just keep all the settings as this
122:30 - only and click on run
122:33 - now you can see that
122:36 - we have find
122:38 - in this f targets there are a number of
122:40 - records and in the r target that's the
122:41 - source there are a number of records
122:44 - if we click on the output anchor so the
122:46 - total number of records is 5191 that
122:49 - means the field where we have replaced
122:51 - the values right
122:53 - and the values would have been replaced
122:55 - over here
122:58 - okay so here we can just select the
123:00 - subcategory again
123:03 - and click on run
123:13 - so this is how the find and the replace
123:15 - tool works it is used to replace the
123:17 - values right
123:19 - so this was all about the find section
123:21 - let us now focus on the replace section
123:23 - so we have replace found text with value
123:26 - that means we have to choose the field
123:28 - from the reference table
123:30 - to update the original table that means
123:31 - the fine table
123:33 - uh if you want to replace multiple items
123:36 - then you can just check this
123:38 - button or you can just uncheck it
123:41 - append fields to record if you want to
123:43 - append a column
123:46 - from the find field to the replace field
123:48 - then you can just do that as well okay
123:50 - so these are the options uh that are
123:52 - available let me just append some
123:54 - records category and the product name
123:56 - records
123:57 - and click on run
124:00 - now if you just click on this
124:04 - output anchor
124:09 - then you can see category 2 and product
124:11 - name 2 are also available over here that
124:13 - means these have been appended in the
124:15 - final
124:16 - output so that's how the find and the
124:17 - replace tool works
124:19 - now let us talk about the other tool
124:21 - that is available
124:23 - which is known as the union tool so the
124:26 - union tool is a special tool which is
124:28 - again present in the join tab
124:30 - now what is the function of this tool it
124:33 - is used to combine two or more data sets
124:35 - on the column names or the position so
124:37 - on the basis of the column names or the
124:39 - position
124:40 - it is used to combine the data sets
124:42 - right and in the output each column
124:44 - contains the row from each input
124:47 - we can
124:48 - actually perform the union operation on
124:50 - the basis of the number of the columns
124:52 - or the position the name of the columns
124:54 - or the position of the columns right so
124:56 - if we take a look at this
124:58 - we have two uh columns we have two data
125:01 - sets right now that is the consumer
125:03 - segment data set and the corporate
125:05 - segment data set so if we just take a
125:07 - look at these data sets they all have
125:08 - the same
125:10 - values that is the same columns column
125:12 - names are same and the position is also
125:14 - same rate so we can just perform the
125:16 - union on both cases that is on the basis
125:19 - of name and on the
125:20 - basis of positions as well right
125:23 - so what we are going to do is uh we are
125:26 - just going to take both of them
125:28 - drag this union tool over here
125:30 - and we are going to connect them so this
125:32 - is one
125:35 - and this is two so we can just uh
125:38 - attach them both of them the one is the
125:41 - consumer and the second is the corporate
125:43 - now if we just check on this output tab
125:46 - what we would be getting
125:48 - is a combination of the rows that is
125:50 - 8211 records in total
125:53 - here you can see
125:55 - right uh then we have this
125:58 - for
125:59 - cross check we have the segment column
126:01 - where first of all the consumer values
126:03 - are there
126:04 - and then if you just scroll down
126:10 - we would be having the corporate values
126:12 - okay
126:14 - so this is what we are getting over here
126:16 - um
126:18 - now if you just go to this union tool
126:20 - here we have three options auto config
126:22 - by name that means if the column names
126:24 - is similar then you can use this option
126:27 - next is auto config by position that
126:29 - means if the position is similar then
126:31 - automatic configuration would be done on
126:32 - the basis of position so we can do that
126:34 - as well because uh in our case both of
126:36 - these things are same so there would be
126:38 - no change
126:40 - right but the third option that we have
126:42 - right now is the manual configuration by
126:44 - the fields so if you want to configure
126:46 - some fields to other values that you can
126:48 - do like
126:49 - here we have state and postal code so if
126:52 - you want to just
126:53 - change them
126:55 - with this interchange them like this
126:57 - okay
126:58 - and click on run
127:01 - so now what would happen is if you just
127:03 - go there
127:06 - in the state and the postal code these
127:08 - values would be interchanged with one
127:10 - another right
127:11 - to understand it in a better way we can
127:13 - just use the browse tool over here
127:16 - so that we can get to see the individual
127:18 - records and run it
127:23 - right
127:24 - now if we just go to this tool
127:28 - here
127:30 - we can find the postal code
127:36 - right
127:37 - and as you can see the longest value is
127:39 - not carolina uh the last alpha numeric
127:42 - value is winsconsin that means the
127:45 - values have been interchanged okay
127:48 - and similarly in order to check for the
127:50 - segment
127:51 - what we can do is just select the
127:53 - segment one
127:55 - segment field over here
127:57 - here is the segment field and there are
127:58 - two values the consumer segment and the
128:00 - corporate segment so that is how the
128:01 - union works for the union to work at
128:04 - least to the of the data sets must be
128:06 - available and they must have some of the
128:08 - common ground on the basis of which you
128:11 - can perform the union operation union
128:13 - operation is similar that is one table
128:17 - is appended over the other table no
128:19 - changes are made into the individual
128:21 - records only
128:24 - the
128:25 - appending operation takes place so
128:27 - that's all for this union tool and
128:29 - that's all for this video in the next
128:31 - videos we would be looking at some more
128:33 - tools of this joint app that's all for
128:35 - this video thanks for watching
128:38 - hello everyone welcome to ultrix
128:40 - tutorials in this video we are going to
128:42 - take a look at the join tool in ultrix
128:45 - so the join tool is a part of the join
128:47 - tab group and it is a very useful tool
128:50 - in ultrix we would be seeing all about
128:52 - this tool in this video
128:54 - so first of all let us understand that
128:56 - what is the basic functions of this tool
128:58 - uh join rule is used to combine the two
129:01 - inputs based on some common fields
129:03 - between the two tables
129:05 - we can also join two data streams based
129:08 - upon the record position of those
129:10 - streams
129:11 - so for the join tool we have two inputs
129:13 - over here
129:14 - as you can see input data one
129:17 - we just click on it
129:18 - it would open the excel file
129:21 - so it has a few fields
129:24 - here and it is the segment field is the
129:27 - consumer segment as you can see all the
129:29 - segments are consumer over here in this
129:31 - field okay
129:32 - and the second we have is the same table
129:36 - but the number of records is different
129:38 - and the segment here is the corporate
129:40 - segment over here like this so here are
129:43 - the two sheets the consumer sheet and
129:44 - the corporate sheet which are actually a
129:46 - part
129:47 - um and taken as two different inputs to
129:49 - be joined together right that means we
129:52 - have two inputs with common fields
129:55 - between them which we need to join
129:57 - now let us drag this join tool over here
129:59 - as you can see
130:01 - this is a join tool
130:04 - and
130:05 - in order to perform the join
130:08 - we can
130:11 - actually use two options which are
130:13 - available in this configuration tab that
130:15 - is joined by record position or joined
130:16 - by specific fields
130:18 - now if we talk about join by record
130:19 - position this option is used when two
130:22 - tables have the same field structure and
130:25 - the data will be joined by its position
130:27 - within the two tables
130:29 - next we have is joined by specific
130:30 - fields
130:32 - it is used when the two tables have one
130:34 - or more fields in common and the data
130:36 - will be joined together on the basis of
130:38 - the common field only
130:40 - and we can choose to join based upon the
130:43 - multiple fields and each join should be
130:45 - a separate row in the grid like this is
130:47 - the grid so each join each criteria that
130:49 - you are giving for the join should be
130:51 - for a separate row in this table but i'm
130:53 - just going to go with the join with
130:54 - record position joined by record
130:56 - position first of all let me just drag
130:58 - this one to l and the other to r so l
131:02 - means left and r means right these are
131:04 - the two anchors that we are getting
131:07 - now each input l and r or left and right
131:10 - has a drop down list
131:13 - from where we can just actually select
131:15 - the fields uh or the join field for each
131:17 - of the inputs
131:19 - altered
131:20 - designer will automatically select the
131:21 - field for us as in this case you can see
131:23 - it has selected the row id field for us
131:26 - to be taken as the drop down uh as the
131:28 - joining field okay
131:31 - now we can just use this table to modify
131:33 - the data that means it's type we can
131:36 - modify like right now it's double we can
131:38 - just select it to in 16 to reduce its
131:40 - size a little bit
131:42 - we can rename it so let's just rename it
131:44 - to a serial number just to show you that
131:47 - how the changes are going to work and
131:49 - like this we can just modify it like the
131:51 - data type the size we can rename it or
131:53 - add a description so
131:55 - let's just add a description that is
131:57 - serial
131:58 - number
132:00 - like this okay
132:03 - so these are the changes that i have
132:04 - done
132:07 - all right and then there is this unknown
132:08 - column which is basically used
132:11 - in case we want to add more columns
132:15 - now uh in case of the view output there
132:17 - are these three options that is the l
132:19 - anchor that contains the records from
132:20 - the l input that didn't join to the
132:22 - records from the r input the j anchor
132:25 - that contains the records that join from
132:27 - the l and the r input and then we have
132:29 - the r anchor
132:32 - uh that contains the records uh from the
132:34 - r input that didn't join into the
132:35 - records from the l input so this is the
132:38 - um
132:38 - order and these are the three anchors
132:41 - that have been shown over here if we
132:42 - just click on run
132:45 - so the joining would occur let's just
132:47 - click on the l anchor to get
132:49 - the uh record from the l input that
132:51 - didn't join to the record from the r
132:53 - input so a total of 2171 records are
132:55 - there
132:56 - we click on j so 3020 records are j uh
133:00 - in this j anchor that means the records
133:02 - that have been joined from the l input
133:04 - to the r input
133:07 - over here as you can see
133:10 - there are 3020 records and in this r
133:12 - anchor we have no records that means
133:14 - there are no records in the r input that
133:17 - didn't join to the records of the l
133:18 - input so this is how the join tool works
133:23 - and uh
133:25 - there are these different types of joins
133:27 - that can
133:28 - happen uh in this
133:31 - using the join tool first is the inner
133:33 - join that we have done right now
133:36 - specified by this j anchor this is the
133:38 - inner join that contains the records
133:40 - that join from the l input to the
133:42 - records in the r input
133:44 - uh this l anchor refers to the
133:47 - left unjoined that contains only of the
133:49 - records that didn't join to those of the
133:52 - r and this r contains of the are
133:55 - unjoined
133:56 - records uh next we have is a possibility
134:00 - of a left outer join that all the
134:02 - records from the l input including the
134:03 - records that join with the r input
134:06 - right
134:08 - uh now this can be achieved with the
134:09 - help of two tools the join tool and the
134:11 - union tool
134:12 - um
134:14 - so what we can do is actually
134:18 - get a union tool
134:21 - here and if we just combine them
134:23 - together that means
134:25 - connect the j and l
134:28 - outputs of the join tool to the union
134:29 - tool so the l is connected let's just
134:31 - connect the j as well
134:33 - now if we just click on this output
134:36 - button
134:40 - and um
134:41 - just
134:42 - run it then what we would be getting is
134:44 - a total of 5191 records which is the
134:49 - result of the left outer join similarly
134:51 - if you want to get a result of the right
134:53 - outer join now what is right outer join
134:56 - uh that means all the records from the r
134:58 - input including the records that are
135:00 - joined
135:01 - with the l inputs again let's just get a
135:03 - union
135:04 - uh let's just drag the j
135:06 - and the r anchors over here
135:10 - and run the workflow
135:14 - so here it is let's just click on the
135:16 - output and this is around 3020 records
135:19 - that are a part of the right output join
135:21 - last but not the least we have the full
135:23 - outer join
135:24 - so that means all the records that are
135:27 - a part of the l and the r inputs are
135:30 - the full outer join
135:33 - uh full outer join is actually similar
135:35 - to
135:37 - uh the append fields join which means it
135:40 - actually performs a cartesian join a
135:42 - combination of all the records of both
135:44 - the tables would be shown over here and
135:46 - the total number of rows would be the
135:48 - product of the individual rows in the uh
135:52 - tables so either we can directly use the
135:54 - pain fields or if you don't want to use
135:55 - the print fields then you can actually
135:58 - use a third option so what i'm gonna do
136:01 - is just copy these three tools
136:04 - right click copy and create a new
136:06 - workflow out of them so as to avoid the
136:08 - confusion
136:09 - and here i am going to perform the
136:11 - full outer join so let's just get the
136:13 - union tool over here
136:16 - we need to connect all these three that
136:17 - is l j and r over here so first of all
136:20 - we need to connect the j
136:22 - output or the j anchor why we are doing
136:25 - it every time we are using the union
136:27 - tool after the join rule make sure you
136:29 - first connect the shape
136:30 - to establish the combined table schema
136:33 - that what is going to be the final table
136:35 - schema right
136:36 - then you can connect l
136:38 - and then you can connect r
136:42 - and then run this workflow
136:44 - so after a few seconds
136:46 - here is the output
136:48 - total of 5191 records would be displayed
136:51 - over here
136:53 - with all the values right and if you
136:56 - want to cross check your results what
136:57 - you can do is actually use the pen
136:59 - fields option
137:00 - so for this we are just going to copy
137:02 - these two tools
137:04 - you can select multiple by control
137:06 - clicking them right click copy
137:08 - go to the new workflow and paste them
137:11 - either using the shortcut ctrl v or
137:13 - simply just right click and paste right
137:16 - let me move it here get the append
137:18 - fields tool
137:20 - over here get it here
137:22 - and get it here
137:25 - run it
137:35 - allow all the pens and click on run
137:39 - it's going to take a few seconds of
137:41 - course apparent fields is a little bit
137:43 - slower option
137:45 - than the
137:46 - um
137:48 - union and the join tool combined so
137:50 - let's just wait for a few seconds
137:53 - and while you're waiting you can see
137:55 - actually the progress
137:56 - with which it is working on okay
138:00 - right so now if we just click on this
138:02 - output anchor
138:04 - then we would be seeing a total of all
138:06 - the records that are present over here
138:08 - so that is how the joints work uh the
138:11 - cartesian joint or the
138:13 - full outer join the left outer join the
138:15 - right outer join and basically all the
138:17 - types of the joints with the help of the
138:18 - join tool union tool and the apparent
138:20 - fills tool that is all that we would be
138:23 - looking at in this join tab and that's
138:26 - all for this video thanks for watching
138:31 - hello everyone welcome to alteryx videos
138:34 - in this video we are going to talk about
138:36 - a tool that is known as the regex tool
138:39 - in ultrix
138:40 - so rejects is basically stands for
138:42 - regular expressions and that helps us to
138:46 - find for particular values in the
138:49 - uh table okay
138:52 - so here is a few uh small setup that i
138:54 - have done for the rejects tool this is
138:56 - how a regex tool looks and it is a part
138:59 - of the parse tab
139:01 - in the ultrix so here is the rejects
139:04 - tool that's present it is used to
139:07 - leverage the regular expression syntax
139:09 - to pass match or replace the data
139:12 - so for the regex tool first of all the
139:14 - data must be present so i have taken a
139:16 - data that is the consumer statement data
139:18 - from the output excel sheets that we
139:20 - have already prepared in the previous
139:21 - videos
139:22 - in case you have not watched the videos
139:24 - i would recommend you to watch them to
139:25 - better understand what we are doing over
139:27 - here
139:28 - so once i have taken the data from the
139:31 - input data tool then
139:32 - let me just delete it once
139:34 - the next thing is to go to this parts
139:36 - tab and grab this regex tool over here
139:39 - okay
139:39 - now what we are going to do is connect
139:41 - these anchors like this
139:44 - and in the regex tools configuration we
139:47 - have the first option
139:49 - that is the configure the
139:51 - column to parse so here you can just
139:54 - select the column which we want to parse
139:56 - so what i'm gonna do is i'm just going
139:58 - to go with the customer name column that
139:59 - i want to parse
140:01 - next is in format to convert option we
140:05 - have to add the regular expression so
140:09 - here is the pearl five rejects syntax
140:11 - that has been followed
140:13 - by these regular expressions in case you
140:15 - do not know about the regular
140:17 - expressions and want to read about it
140:19 - then how can you go with it you can
140:21 - simply just go to google
140:24 - and here you can just search for
140:26 - regex
140:29 - altricks rejects two lal tricks are
140:31 - basically regexal tricks
140:33 - so if you just search for it you would
140:35 - get the first link that is
140:36 - help.alteryx.com
140:38 - that would give you the official altrix
140:41 - documentation for this tool and in this
140:43 - official documentation you will find
140:45 - this link that is perl regular
140:47 - expression syntax you can just click on
140:49 - this link and here is all the
140:51 - information that you need to know about
140:53 - the regular expressions before working
140:55 - on them like everything that um every
140:58 - syntax of regex that is being used
141:01 - is uh shown over here okay
141:04 - so you can take your time and uh read it
141:06 - understand it well and then come back to
141:08 - this video so
141:10 - let me just quickly show you that how
141:13 - these regular expressions are going to
141:14 - work
141:15 - here what we have is the plus sign which
141:18 - is the button that is used to access the
141:20 - common regular expressions that we may
141:22 - need by creating the expression
141:25 - so if you just click on this plus icon
141:27 - we would be uh seeing these operations
141:29 - like if you want to match for a single
141:30 - character you want to
141:33 - match for zero or more characters or one
141:35 - or more characters you want to measure
141:36 - the start of the word end of the word
141:38 - beginning with the line and the line
141:40 - and so on these are all the regular
141:42 - expressions and tags that have been
141:43 - given to you
141:44 - next is the case insensitive option
141:49 - just a second here is this case in
141:50 - sensitive option which is checked by
141:52 - default that means
141:55 - the
141:56 - searches that would be happening through
141:58 - regular expression would not distinguish
142:00 - between the upper case and the lowercase
142:02 - letters right
142:04 - next we have is the output where we have
142:06 - the output method which is used
142:08 - when parsing
142:10 - to configure the related properties like
142:12 - what you want to do once the expressions
142:14 - have been matched so we have four
142:16 - methods that are available the first one
142:18 - is replace so it means that we want to
142:21 - replace the expression
142:23 - that we have searched with a second
142:26 - expression now where you want to find
142:28 - the second expression that is in the
142:30 - replacement text you can enter the
142:32 - replacement text
142:34 - uh that we want
142:35 - the original expression to be replaced
142:37 - with again we have this
142:39 - plus that would uh allow you to
142:42 - actually
142:43 - uh find the entire text or just the
142:45 - particular character
142:47 - to be replaced okay the common regular
142:49 - expressions again that are needed
142:52 - and then we have the copy unmatched
142:54 - text to output if you want to copy it to
142:57 - the output as well that also you can do
142:59 - otherwise you can just remove it
143:01 - next option that we have in this output
143:02 - is the tokenize method that is used to
143:05 - split the incoming data using a regular
143:07 - expression
143:08 - uh it works
143:10 - in similar to the next tool that we have
143:12 - is the text to columns tool so we would
143:14 - be working more with the text to columns
143:16 - tool so i'm not going to explain
143:18 - everything over here
143:20 - and
143:22 - it has um
143:23 - some options like
143:25 - if you just select it tokenize method
143:28 - then you can see we have different
143:29 - options like a split to columns option
143:32 - like you want to split a single column
143:34 - of data at each instance to the
143:36 - specified delimiter into the multiple
143:38 - columns
143:39 - and what would be the extra behavior or
143:42 - the behavior of the extra columns like
143:43 - you want to drop them with the warning
143:45 - you want to drop them without warning or
143:47 - you want to show an error before
143:48 - dropping the columns
143:50 - then there is this output root name
143:53 - which is actually the original name of
143:55 - the column
143:57 - that we are going to use
143:58 - and if you want to split a single column
144:01 - of data at each instance of the
144:02 - specified delimiter into multiple rows
144:05 - then this option needs to be checked
144:08 - third method we have is the parse method
144:11 - it is used to separate the expression
144:13 - into new columns and set the name type
144:15 - size and expression for the new columns
144:18 - a new column is created in the output
144:21 - columns table with the its name its
144:24 - particular data type its size and the
144:26 - expression which is automatically
144:27 - populated so you can just specify name
144:30 - type and size
144:32 - last but not the least we have is the
144:34 - match
144:35 - option that is used to append a column
144:38 - containing a number
144:39 - that is one if the expression is matched
144:41 - and 0 if it did not matched
144:44 - now um
144:45 - column id column name for match status
144:47 - that means a new column would be created
144:49 - so what would be the name of the column
144:51 - that you can specify over here by
144:52 - default it is taken as order id
144:54 - underscore matched right um
144:57 - and there is this option of error if not
144:59 - match so if the expression is not
145:01 - matched and you want to generate some
145:03 - kind of an error that it would generate
145:06 - by checking on this option or by
145:07 - unchecking it okay
145:09 - so let's just see uh the practical
145:11 - application of this regular expression
145:13 - but before that let me just get a look
145:14 - of how the data is looking
145:17 - so here it is we are using the customer
145:19 - name
145:22 - in the customer name field we have um
145:25 - different customer names
145:27 - starting with different letters right so
145:29 - let's just go to the regular expression
145:31 - field
145:32 - and i wanted to start with
145:35 - any single character should be z
145:38 - okay
145:39 - and uh i just want a match column to be
145:42 - there that
145:43 - there should be a column
145:45 - that should be name underscore matched
145:50 - that if it is matched it should show me
145:53 - one otherwise it should show me a zero
145:56 - and click on run
145:58 - now wait for a few seconds till it's
145:59 - been run
146:03 - here now we can see that we are getting
146:05 - this name matched option where the
146:07 - results are false there should be some
146:08 - true results in order to get that what
146:10 - we are going to do is grab the browse
146:12 - tool over here
146:14 - and in this browse tool
146:17 - let's just run it once again run the
146:19 - workflow
146:21 - now in the browse tool uh we are going
146:24 - to go with the last record that is the
146:26 - name matched record so all our faults
146:28 - that means uh there were no records that
146:31 - had z in them right so let me just
146:35 - append my query just modify my query a
146:37 - little bit
146:38 - and here get a instead of set
146:41 - run it
146:44 - so here what we have done is added a and
146:47 - in this case uh check the option of
146:49 - error if not matched so if there is no
146:51 - matching in the first record itself then
146:53 - the error would be there so let me just
146:55 - turn on it
146:57 - so this is what we are getting as the
146:59 - error because the first letter was not a
147:02 - that is why it didn't match the
147:04 - expression and the error was there and
147:06 - it has finished its running in just 1.4
147:08 - seconds okay
147:11 - so this is how the regular expressions
147:13 - work now let us move on to the next tool
147:16 - that we have and that is the
147:19 - text to columns tool so let me just
147:21 - create a new workflow and in this
147:23 - workflow what i'm going to do is just
147:25 - copy paste this
147:26 - input data okay so let's just copy it
147:31 - and paste it
147:35 - and grab this text to columns tool
147:39 - over here
147:40 - so it would give me the um
147:44 - freedom to just you know
147:46 - uh
147:46 - split the columns like we have the order
147:48 - id column in which hyphen can act as a
147:50 - delimiter so i want to split this column
147:52 - so let's just go to this
147:54 - um tool
147:56 - select order id column the delimiter
147:58 - specified needs to be hyphen the number
148:00 - of columns that needs to be created is
148:02 - three
148:03 - and uh leave if there are any extra
148:05 - columns then leave it in the last column
148:07 - and output root name is going to be
148:09 - order id right let's just click on run
148:14 - and now what we can see is a total of 24
148:17 - fields
148:19 - so
148:21 - here what we are getting order id 1
148:23 - order id 2 and order id id3 since there
148:25 - were only three things so three have
148:27 - been shown over here in case there were
148:29 - multiple uh hyphens like let me just
148:34 - decrease the number of columns to two
148:36 - and click on run then what would happen
148:38 - is we would be getting order id 1 and in
148:42 - the last column the combination of both
148:44 - of them like order id 2 and 3 with a
148:46 - hyphen is present over here if you want
148:48 - to rename the column you can just rename
148:50 - it simply
148:53 - uh using the tools that we have seen in
148:54 - the past so um any kind of a renaming
148:57 - that you want to perform that you can do
148:59 - so that's all for this video in which we
149:01 - looked about the rejects tool and the
149:03 - takes two columns tool
149:04 - uh in the parse tab of the altrix that's
149:07 - all for this video thanks for watching
149:10 - hello everyone welcome to altrex
149:12 - tutorials in this video we are going to
149:15 - talk about a very important tool in
149:17 - ultrix known as the count records tool
149:20 - so count record tool is present in the
149:23 - transform tab
149:25 - in the ultrix it is used to return the
149:27 - count of the number of the records that
149:30 - are passing through the tool
149:32 - now
149:32 - we can use this tool when we want to
149:35 - report on the resulting record
149:37 - uh or the record count
149:39 - that is being used in the workflow
149:42 - um it even returns account of a 0 as
149:45 - well
149:46 - so in case you are wondering that how
149:48 - would you get the total number of
149:50 - records then you can do that with the
149:52 - help of the count records tool
149:54 - now you can get that on the entire
149:56 - database or you can apply some filters
150:00 - and get the records that match that
150:02 - particular filter as well
150:04 - so i'm going to show you the example for
150:06 - both
150:08 - let me first get the input data tool and
150:10 - get my data that is stored in this
150:12 - output excel file the consumer sheet
150:15 - now if i just run it right now
150:19 - i would be getting all the records that
150:20 - are present in there that is a total of
150:22 - 5191 records okay
150:25 - now the thing is i'm going to uh go to
150:27 - this output and apply a filter
150:30 - over here right so let's just use this
150:33 - filter tool
150:35 - here and the filter is going to be
150:38 - a basic filter that is i want to select
150:40 - the segment where the segment value is
150:42 - let's just get a value for the segment
150:45 - or let's just get a value for
150:48 - say category that is equal to technology
150:52 - so let me just apply the filter that is
150:55 - for the category
150:56 - if it is equals
150:58 - to technology okay
151:02 - then run this
151:05 - and we would be getting in the true part
151:08 - we are getting 951 records and in the
151:10 - false part we are getting
151:12 - 4000 some records okay
151:14 - so if you just go to the true part
151:17 - and then go to the transform tab get
151:19 - this count records uh filter or this
151:21 - count records tool and apply it over
151:23 - here
151:25 - then we just go to its output part okay
151:27 - or basically we just run this tool
151:30 - then what we are getting is 951 as the
151:33 - total because it is only added to the
151:35 - true part
151:36 - if i also connect this false part to
151:38 - here then you can see it's um not able
151:41 - to connect because
151:42 - this account records tool only accept
151:45 - one input right so to get the number of
151:47 - the false records we add another account
151:49 - records tool and click on run
151:52 - so now for this second count records
151:54 - tool if you just click on its output
151:56 - part we are getting four two four zero
151:59 - that's the number of the records for the
152:00 - false and this is the number of the
152:02 - records 951 is the number of records for
152:04 - the true part
152:05 - in case we decide to remove this filter
152:08 - right let me just remove this filter
152:10 - over here
152:12 - and also delete one of the counter calls
152:13 - tool then what can i do is directly
152:15 - connect my database to this count
152:17 - records tool
152:19 - now if i just run it
152:22 - then what do we get is
152:23 - 5191 that is the total number of records
152:26 - in the actual database so that's how the
152:29 - count records tool works either through
152:31 - filter or without the filter okay
152:34 - next tool that we are going to see is
152:37 - the cross tab tool so let me just save
152:39 - this workflow and move on to our second
152:41 - tool that is the cross tab tool now what
152:44 - is it
152:44 - usage of this tool it is used to pivot
152:46 - the orientation of the data in a table
152:50 - what it does is it moves the vertical
152:52 - data fields onto a horizontal axis and
152:54 - summarizes the data whenever it is
152:56 - specified
152:57 - it is in reverse application of the
152:59 - transpose tool which of course we would
153:01 - be seeing as well
153:03 - so there is no limit on the number of
153:04 - the rows or the columns that can be
153:06 - passed through this crosstab tool okay
153:08 - so for this crosstab tool what i have
153:10 - done is i have taken another database or
153:12 - i have created another database let me
153:14 - just use that because it is fairly small
153:16 - so it would be easier to understand for
153:18 - us
153:18 - so this database is present in the form
153:21 - of
153:22 - a named range in excel it has two
153:24 - columns the number of hours and the
153:26 - score so the name of the range is the
153:28 - scores so let me just get that click on
153:30 - ok
153:31 - this is how it is looking it has around
153:33 - 10 records okay
153:35 - it gives us the number of the hours the
153:37 - student has 30 and the score that he has
153:39 - scored okay
153:40 - let's just go to the transform tab and
153:42 - get our crosstab tool over here
153:46 - now once we get there uh it would ask us
153:49 - that if we want to group the data by any
153:52 - of these values
153:53 - so it is all the available data values
153:56 - that are present in the data set
153:59 - if you want it to be a grouped with a
154:01 - specific value you can just select that
154:04 - next is um
154:06 - if you want to
154:08 - create a value
154:10 - or change the column headers so a new
154:12 - column would be created for each of the
154:14 - unique values in this particular
154:16 - um
154:17 - header so the number of hours then we
154:19 - have
154:20 - values for new columns so
154:23 - these values would be used to propagate
154:24 - the new columns that are created by the
154:26 - number of hours
154:28 - now if you want to aggregate it
154:30 - um then you can just aggregate it using
154:33 - these all options so what all options we
154:35 - have some average count
154:37 - uh percent row percent column total
154:40 - first and last
154:41 - so
154:42 - what we are going to do is just go with
154:44 - the total row and a total column
154:46 - and click on run
154:50 - now here um
154:53 - we just select on the output tab here
154:55 - this is the output that we are getting
154:57 - that is the total
155:00 - of the rows and the columns is 733
155:02 - if we just
155:03 - um
155:05 - now instead of getting this total row
155:07 - and the total column i am changing the
155:09 - method of aggregating values to sum and
155:12 - just deselect them both and click on run
155:15 - now what would be getting is the record
155:18 - and the
155:20 - sum of the scores
155:23 - over here
155:24 - so this is how it is looking so this is
155:27 - basically the usage of the cross tab
155:28 - tool in altrix
155:31 - now let us take a look at the tool that
155:33 - is very similar to the crosstab tool and
155:35 - it is known as the transpose tool so let
155:38 - me just save it
155:40 - and what is the transpose tool it is
155:42 - actually
155:46 - somewhat different from the crosstab
155:47 - tool it is used to
155:50 - pivot the orientation of the data table
155:53 - it is basically used to transform the
155:55 - data so what we can do is the horizontal
155:58 - data fields would be shown on the
155:59 - vertical axis
156:01 - it is the reverse application of the
156:03 - crosstab tool
156:05 - and it is useful for extracting the
156:07 - non-conforming data there is no limit
156:09 - again on the number of records of the
156:11 - fields that could be transformed
156:13 - so here is the input data part that is
156:16 - same with the um
156:18 - crosstab tool that we just saw that is
156:20 - the number of hours and the score
156:22 - now let's go to this transform tab and
156:25 - get this transpose tool so when we get
156:27 - this transpose tool these are the
156:29 - configuration panel options that we are
156:31 - getting first is the key columns
156:33 - so
156:34 - from here we can select the columns to
156:36 - pivot the table around
156:38 - this name remains on the horizontal axis
156:41 - with its value replicated vertically for
156:43 - each data field that is selected
156:46 - so let me just select them all
156:48 - next is the data columns now that means
156:51 - that we can select the columns to carry
156:53 - through the analysis so let's just keep
156:56 - number of hours over here and the score
156:57 - over here
156:59 - here we have an option of a dynamic or
157:01 - unknown column so if you want to go for
157:03 - a dynamic or
157:05 - unknown columns as well you can just
157:06 - keep it checked okay
157:09 - you can just go to this question mark to
157:11 - run about uh to read about it that is
157:13 - running a workflow can introduce the new
157:15 - columns that were unknown at the
157:17 - configuration time so if you want to
157:19 - include those new columns you can make
157:21 - sure that this option is checked that's
157:23 - for a
157:24 - further step towards security
157:27 - last but not least we have the missing
157:29 - columns option
157:30 - that means what action we want to take
157:33 - if some of the columns are missing we
157:34 - want to report an error and stop
157:36 - processing the result we just want to
157:38 - throw a warning and continue on with the
157:40 - results or we just want to completely
157:42 - ignore it right so let's just keep up on
157:45 - one and click on run
157:48 - now what happens is um
157:50 - if you just click on the output panel
157:52 - this is how it's looking the number of
157:54 - hours
157:57 - is same the name has been changed to
157:59 - score and its value is being shown like
158:01 - this so basically score has been
158:05 - transposed into a horizontal row instead
158:07 - of a vertical a vertical column
158:10 - so this is what the function of the
158:11 - transpose tool is and this is what it
158:14 - has done now if you want you can compare
158:16 - it with the crosstab tool the cross tab
158:19 - tool what it did was
158:21 - it transformed the horizontal rows into
158:24 - the vertical columns now we have these
158:26 - columns for all of these values right
158:29 - but what the transpose tool did was just
158:31 - opposite of the crosstab tool it took
158:34 - the name of the column or the header of
158:36 - the column that was score and created
158:39 - multiple rows out of it the value for
158:41 - each of that was uh written over here
158:44 - like the value value value like this
158:45 - okay
158:46 - now in this transpose tool if we just
158:48 - select all the key columns and click on
158:50 - run once again
158:52 - then what would happen
158:53 - uh then we would be getting like this no
158:56 - values because we have transposed both
158:58 - of these columns so no
159:00 - none of the values are remaining with us
159:02 - okay
159:04 - and let me just show you another
159:06 - possibility that is
159:08 - if i just decide to transform the number
159:11 - of hours instead of this course value so
159:13 - this is how it would be looking the
159:14 - number of hours would be taking up the
159:16 - horizontal rows and its values would be
159:19 - assigned like this with a value field so
159:21 - name and value it would be taken in the
159:23 - form of a pair
159:25 - so that's all for this video in which we
159:27 - learned about three tools of the
159:28 - transform tab
159:30 - and
159:30 - thanks for watching the video
159:33 - hello everyone welcome to altrix
159:36 - tutorials in this video we are going to
159:38 - talk about two very important tools of
159:41 - the transform tab these are the running
159:43 - total tool and the summarize tool
159:45 - so first of all let's start with the
159:47 - running total tool this tool is present
159:50 - in the transform tab in ultrix
159:53 - and it is used to calculate a cumulative
159:55 - sum on a numeric field per record in a
159:58 - fill
160:00 - it can also be used to create sums of
160:02 - groups of records and calculate the
160:04 - cumulative sums of multiple fields
160:07 - at the record or even at the group level
160:10 - so
160:11 - let us understand the usage of this
160:12 - running total tool with the help of an
160:14 - example right so let me just first get
160:17 - my data using this input data tool which
160:20 - is present in the in out tab
160:22 - now let's just click on this drop down
160:24 - and get our excel sheet which is the
160:27 - consumer sheet click on ok
160:29 - now let's just grab this running tool
160:31 - tool and bring it over here
160:34 - here we have two options that are
160:36 - present in this running total tool
160:39 - in the configuration panel that is the
160:40 - group by field which is again optional
160:43 - and the second option is the create
160:44 - running total field
160:46 - so it helps us to create the numeric
160:49 - fields to create a running total
160:50 - basically to select the fields through
160:52 - which we want to create a running total
160:55 - in your database there might be
160:56 - different kinds of fields like the
160:57 - textual fields the date fields
161:01 - a spatial object fields but the running
161:03 - total tool will automatically fetch out
161:05 - the numerical fields and would give you
161:07 - only those fields on which it is
161:09 - applicable right so these are all the
161:11 - numeric fields that are present in my
161:12 - data set that's why it's showing the
161:15 - list of all of them right
161:16 - now
161:17 - uh what you want is you can just select
161:20 - the fields
161:22 - of whose running total you want
161:24 - the new columns would be created and
161:25 - they would be added with a run total
161:28 - underscore prefix
161:30 - to
161:31 - show that this was the original record
161:33 - and this is the total that has been
161:34 - calculated by this particular tool
161:37 - so
161:38 - let's just see how it is going to work i
161:40 - want the
161:42 - total of sales quantity discount and
161:44 - profit these are the four values whose
161:46 - total i want
161:49 - next what i can do is i can click on run
161:51 - and wait for a few seconds till it has
161:53 - finished running
161:55 - this is how it's looking
162:04 - if i just click on this output tab
162:07 - over here or using this anchor
162:10 - then i would be getting these uh four
162:13 - columns running total underscore sales
162:16 - quantity discount and profit
162:18 - this means that this is the total values
162:21 - that have been calculated by this
162:22 - particular tool
162:24 - if you go to the very last record you
162:26 - would be of course getting the highest
162:28 - value or the total value of the sales
162:30 - quantity discount and profit if you take
162:32 - a look on the profit values then there
162:34 - is a point where these values are in
162:36 - negatives which means i'm not getting a
162:38 - total profit i am getting some of the
162:40 - loss from my sales
162:42 - but slowly if you see the values have
162:44 - again
162:46 - converted them into the positives that
162:47 - means the total value is a profit or a
162:49 - loss that would be getting for the last
162:51 - record
162:53 - so this is how the running total uh tool
162:55 - works it is actually used to give you a
162:57 - summary of the numeric fields that i've
162:59 - been working on
163:02 - next we have is the summarize tool now
163:04 - this is a really important tool in
163:06 - altrix and we are going to
163:09 - use it often whenever we are developing
163:11 - the workflows so let us understand it's
163:13 - working first of all
163:14 - it is used to perform the various
163:17 - actions which could be the functions or
163:19 - the calculations on the data
163:21 - it can like return the sum of the column
163:25 - for the data
163:26 - which is
163:28 - basically calculated by adding all the
163:30 - rows in the column
163:31 - it can return the minimum or the maximum
163:33 - value in the column it can count the
163:35 - number of rows it can group the column
163:37 - of a data by identical values it can
163:39 - concatenate the string values it can
163:41 - perform a variety of mathematical
163:43 - calculations and even perform spatial
163:46 - object processing
163:48 - now uh these are a variety of steps that
163:51 - are really important whenever we are
163:53 - working with a workflow right so let's
163:56 - just see some of the actions one by one
163:58 - to understand it
164:00 - let's me just grab my summarize tool and
164:02 - connect it connect my database
164:06 - the database here i'm using is the excel
164:08 - sheet for the consumer segment okay
164:11 - now here we have two things the fields
164:13 - and the actions
164:14 - the fields is basically the data fields
164:17 - that has been taken from the input data
164:19 - set
164:20 - along with its data type okay
164:24 - now what we can do is we can just select
164:26 - some of the fields and if you want to
164:28 - select multiple fields you can just
164:29 - shift and click on them
164:35 - like this okay
164:36 - or what you can do is control click them
164:40 - to select multiple fields
164:43 - then we have is a select option which
164:46 - has different options like all which
164:48 - means it would select all the fields
164:50 - none it would deselect all the fields
164:52 - numeric it would select only the fields
164:54 - with the numeric data type string would
164:56 - select only the string fields and
164:58 - spatial would select only the fields
165:00 - with the spatial data types right
165:02 - so these are the kinds of options that
165:04 - we could perform let me just select the
165:06 - numeric fields so you can see the row id
165:08 - sales quantity discount and profit have
165:10 - been selected
165:12 - next uh what we need to do is once you
165:14 - have selected the fields we come to this
165:16 - add option
165:18 - so uh this add option is actually used
165:20 - to
165:21 - just search for the action that we need
165:22 - to perform you just click on it
165:25 - here are the different options that
165:27 - could be performed we can find the
165:28 - minimum value the maximum value the sum
165:31 - count count non-null count distinct
165:33 - count distinct normal count null
165:36 - group by first last and these are the
165:38 - number of the functions that could be
165:40 - applied like numeric functions string
165:42 - functions
165:44 - uh spatial functions behavioral analysis
165:46 - and the report functions okay
165:48 - so if we just go to the numeric
165:50 - functions uh here is the number of the
165:52 - functions that could be applied like
165:54 - average percentile median and mode
165:56 - so what i'm gonna do is i'm just going
165:58 - to select none and i'm going to show you
166:01 - the different functions that could be
166:02 - applied for each of the data types that
166:04 - is double string
166:06 - and uh we don't have spatial data so let
166:08 - me just go with numeric and the string
166:10 - values only okay so first of all let's
166:11 - just select these four
166:13 - i'm ignoring the row id because that's
166:16 - no need for that
166:17 - next what we can do is just go to this
166:19 - numeric fields and here select the
166:21 - percentile
166:24 - now
166:25 - in the action field we have the fields
166:27 - the action cell could be performed and
166:28 - what would be the name of the output
166:29 - field if you want to change the name of
166:31 - the output field that you can do if you
166:32 - want to change the action that also you
166:33 - can do
166:34 - for example in the case of sales i want
166:37 - the max value
166:39 - in the case of quantity i want the
166:40 - percentile
166:42 - in the case of discount
166:44 - or in the case of discount i want
166:45 - percentile in the quantity again i want
166:47 - the minimum value
166:49 - and in the case of profit i want the
166:52 - sum okay so these are the four different
166:55 - actions that i want to perform on the
166:56 - different fields
166:58 - and once you have selected all of these
166:59 - things you can just simply click on run
167:03 - and wait for a few seconds let's just go
167:05 - to the output
167:06 - so it is giving me the maximum value of
167:08 - the sales
167:09 - the minimum quantity that was purchased
167:11 - was one the percentile discount is point
167:14 - two percent and the total sum of the
167:16 - profit that i have taken is this much of
167:19 - the profit okay
167:22 - uh now
167:23 - the names of the columns have been named
167:26 - accordingly which means you can
167:28 - understand that what's what is going on
167:30 - in these right
167:33 - this is for the numeric values let me
167:35 - just copy this
167:38 - create a new workflow to show some of
167:40 - the functions for the string values as
167:41 - well okay here i can just paste them
167:44 - and for this
167:46 - tool i'm just going to make the changes
167:49 - by selecting the string values
167:52 - and what are
167:53 - those things that i could add is count
167:56 - null count not null so let me just give
167:58 - go with the count
168:01 - if you want to delete any of these
168:02 - actions you can just simply select that
168:04 - action and click on minus select that
168:06 - action click on minus okay
168:08 - so this is what i am going to go with
168:10 - that is the count in the case of
168:12 - category i want count distinct in the
168:14 - case of category a subcategory also i
168:16 - want to count distinct
168:18 - in the case of segment i want
168:21 - count non null
168:23 - in the case of country i want count null
168:27 - and so on okay
168:29 - i have created a bunch of different
168:30 - actions
168:32 - uh in the case of customer id
168:35 - i want the longest okay
168:38 - now once i have selected all these
168:40 - operations i can click on run
168:44 - so it's going to take a few seconds and
168:47 - let us just go to this output to select
168:49 - the uh to just see the values so first
168:52 - of all is count that would give me the
168:53 - count of order id next is count two that
168:55 - is giving me the count of the ship mode
168:57 - which is actually the total number of
168:59 - the records
169:00 - next is the longest customer id then the
169:02 - customer name
169:04 - customer segment
169:05 - then count of the null in the country is
169:08 - zero that means there are no null values
169:09 - right similarly for the count distinct
169:12 - category there are three distinct
169:13 - categories that's why it's giving me the
169:15 - result as uh three
169:17 - similarly in the case of subcategory it
169:19 - is counting it as 17 that are 17
169:22 - distinct subcategories at present
169:24 - and finally we have the count of the
169:26 - product name so there are
169:29 - 5191 products that are available that
169:32 - means
169:33 - everyone has purchased some products
169:35 - so this is how the summarize tool works
169:38 - in the transform tab that's all for this
169:40 - video
169:41 - that's all for the tools for the
169:43 - transform tab
169:45 - and thanks for watching
169:48 - hello everyone welcome back to the
169:50 - altrex tutorials in this video we are
169:52 - going to talk about
169:54 - a new tab
169:56 - that is the reporting tab in our tricks
169:59 - so this tab might not be by default
170:02 - present in your ultrex designer view so
170:04 - what we are going to do is actually
170:07 - see that how can we add the few tabs
170:09 - that are supported by alteryx okay
170:11 - so what we are going to do first of all
170:14 - it's just go to this option this plus
170:16 - icon
170:17 - which would automatically give you an
170:19 - option to add or remove the tools so
170:21 - let's just click on that
170:22 - this would open up the configure tool
170:24 - palette that means all the tools that
170:27 - are actually supported by address but
170:28 - are not being shown on your screen right
170:30 - now
170:31 - so here if you just go
170:33 - and check there are many of the tools
170:35 - that are actually supported by ultrex
170:37 - okay
170:38 - so from here what i'm gonna do is i'm
170:40 - just going to support uh this
170:42 - check on this reporting tab
170:45 - so this would give me a bunch of other
170:48 - tools that i'm gonna use
170:50 - uh like email image insight interactive
170:52 - chart layout
170:54 - map legend overlay render report
170:57 - and table okay so let's just click on ok
171:00 - once we do that this is the reporting
171:02 - tab that would be present in front of us
171:05 - and these are the tools supported by the
171:06 - reporting tab
171:08 - in this video we are going to take a
171:09 - look at the table tool and the
171:11 - interactive chart tool which are of very
171:14 - important
171:16 - in this whole workflow building thing
171:19 - okay
171:19 - so first of all let's just bring up the
171:21 - table tool
171:24 - now uh i have already used the input
171:26 - data tool to get my data set
171:29 - let us just understand the usage of the
171:31 - table tool as the name suggests table
171:33 - tool is used to create a data table or a
171:36 - pivot table to output the report through
171:39 - the render tool okay
171:42 - so as you can see this is the render
171:43 - tool if you want to output the report
171:45 - the render tool is what we are going to
171:46 - use
171:48 - so uh if we just talk about this tool we
171:50 - first have the table mode which means
171:52 - you can select the basic table or the
171:53 - pivot table
171:54 - pivot table is
171:56 - uh basically used when we are using the
171:59 - data from the crosstab tool
172:01 - in case you have not seen the video the
172:02 - crosstab tool i would recommend you to
172:04 - first go and watch it and then you would
172:07 - be able to understand it easier
172:09 - uh that what i'm trying to say okay so
172:11 - i'm just going to go with the basic
172:12 - table
172:14 - next option we have is the group by
172:16 - option that means the fields through
172:18 - which you want to group by these um
172:20 - values if there is anything so what i'm
172:23 - going to do is i'm just going to group
172:24 - by category
172:26 - and sub category okay
172:28 - next we have is the value of a table
172:31 - width which is basically
172:34 - how you want to
172:36 - adjust your table so automatic that
172:39 - means the minimum width percentage you
172:40 - want a particular percentage fix you
172:42 - want a particular fixed value okay so
172:44 - i'm just gonna go with automatic
172:46 - right next we have is the
172:51 - column headings if you want to show the
172:54 - column headings or not
172:56 - then we have the option of a bar graph
172:59 - so if you want to create a bar graph
173:03 - just a second let me just adjust it a
173:05 - little bit
173:08 - yeah
173:09 - so if you want to create a bar graph
173:11 - that means you can specify the data
173:13 - field for which the bar graph needs to
173:15 - be created in the table
173:18 - and this bar graph option is only
173:20 - available for the basic table in case
173:22 - you have selected the pivot table over
173:23 - here then this option would not be
173:25 - available
173:26 - now you can just click on the settings
173:28 - to modify the style of the graph
173:31 - like its weight scale its space value
173:34 - label bars colors etc but i'm not just
173:36 - gonna go into very much deep into this
173:38 - bar graph option right now right now
173:40 - we're just going to focus on the table
173:42 - tool okay
173:44 - uh next is show column headings which is
173:46 - of course let me just uncheck this bar
173:48 - graph so that would be
173:50 - available to us if you want to show the
173:52 - column headings
173:53 - then we have the per column or the
173:54 - methodology configuration option
173:57 - if the table mode is basic then we can
174:00 - configure the columns and if the table
174:03 - mode is the pivot
174:05 - mode then we need to configure the
174:06 - methodologies so in case we have
174:09 - selected basic mode so we are getting
174:11 - the option as per column configuration
174:13 - now we can use
174:15 - it to select the data fields that we
174:17 - want to include in the table
174:19 - using these up and down arrows that are
174:21 - present over here we can just
174:23 - set their order
174:25 - uh we can just rename these fields as
174:27 - well so what i'm gonna do is i'm just
174:28 - gonna uncheck some of these fields
174:32 - okay and i'm just going to go with the
174:38 - only few fields over here okay
174:41 - uh category is a category product name
174:48 - like this okay
174:50 - i am just uh interested in these fields
174:53 - only okay
174:55 - now if you want uh to configure the
174:58 - attributes of a particular field you can
174:59 - just select that particular field and
175:00 - these attributes would be available for
175:02 - you if you want to get a new name for
175:04 - the field so
175:06 - insert the consumer name i'm just going
175:08 - to go with the name
175:10 - if you want to select its width its
175:12 - alignment its borders prefix surface
175:15 - anything you want to select you can just
175:17 - select
175:19 - uh this dec places for the number of the
175:21 - decimal places so if you just select
175:23 - some numerical value let's say the sales
175:25 - value so this field would be
175:28 - enabled okay and like in the prefix i
175:31 - want a dollar symbol to show me that
175:34 - this was the
175:35 - dollar amount and in the end i want to
175:39 - i don't want any suffix just for the
175:40 - prefix i want the dollar okay
175:43 - for the sales
175:44 - and
175:45 - that's it if you want to create some of
175:47 - the column rules you can just create the
175:48 - column rules which basically uh says
175:51 - that what you want to do if you want to
175:53 - apply some kind of a formatting
175:56 - for it so
175:57 - the sales rule one is
175:59 - you apply to the data when
176:02 - the
176:04 - sales is
176:05 - greater than equal to
176:08 - a thousand dollars
176:10 - you can just say
176:13 - the
176:13 - background color
176:15 - must be kind of like green
176:18 - so if the sales value is greater than a
176:20 - thousand dollar i want a green
176:22 - uh background color okay
176:25 - so this is the rule that i have applied
176:28 - okay
176:30 - now
176:30 - next two options we have is the default
176:32 - table settings that means the
176:34 - style options that we want our table to
176:37 - contain would be changed over here or if
176:40 - you want to create a rule for um to be
176:43 - applied to all the columns of the data
176:45 - that you can apply using this create row
176:47 - rule option
176:49 - so
176:50 - these are the options that you can
176:51 - control or configure in this table tool
176:55 - now once you are happy with the changes
176:57 - that you have made you can click on run
177:01 - and
177:02 - yes
177:03 - so here is how the output is looking
177:07 - we have categorized them or we have
177:09 - grouped them on the basis of category
177:11 - and sub category
177:13 - uh and this is the table
177:16 - uh this is the table that we have got
177:18 - over here just a second
177:24 - okay
177:26 - now
177:26 - uh
177:28 - if you want to get
177:31 - to
177:32 - show the staple how would you be able to
177:34 - show it so for that what we need to do
177:37 - is
177:39 - to view the individual records and see
177:42 - whether the changes that you have made
177:44 - in the table are been actually made or
177:46 - not we can simply use a browse tool that
177:49 - is present in the in out tab okay
177:51 - so once we have used the browse tool and
177:53 - run the workflow this is the kind of the
177:55 - output that we would be getting as you
177:57 - can see the number of the fields have
177:58 - been reduced drastically
178:01 - we are now only getting the fields
178:03 - which we actually
178:06 - modified right
178:08 - and if you just want to scroll up and
178:10 - down to get a better view that also you
178:12 - can get
178:14 - here you can see in the sales the prefix
178:16 - is added that is a dollar symbol
178:18 - and whenever the sales quantity is more
178:21 - than a thousand dollars we are getting
178:23 - the color the background color as green
178:25 - this was the rule that we created for
178:27 - this values right so you can see all
178:29 - these values are colored in green now so
178:32 - this is how the whole field or the whole
178:34 - table tool is looking
178:37 - now let us talk about how can you
178:39 - actually render this table okay
178:43 - now here what we have done is created a
178:46 - copy of these
178:47 - two things the basic table and the data
178:51 - in order to render it we go to the
178:52 - reporting tab and grab the render tool
178:54 - the render tool is actually used to
178:57 - render or transform the report snippets
178:59 - into the presentation quality reports
179:02 - into a variety of formats now the
179:04 - formats supported by it are these html
179:07 - compressor pdf rdf word excel png image
179:10 - or a specific output file so from this
179:12 - you need to select the specific output
179:14 - file option in the output file you can
179:16 - just click on this save file
179:19 - and select the format in which you want
179:21 - to save the file i am going with the
179:22 - excel and here you need to type a name
179:24 - so let me just
179:26 - grab the name that is report
179:29 - table
179:30 - over here and click on save now once you
179:33 - do that uh the
179:36 - path would be taken
179:38 - you can just select these different
179:41 - options like if you want a header you
179:42 - want a footer
179:44 - for the table or not
179:46 - that you can just select okay the page
179:48 - of this
179:50 - paper size the orientation for the
179:52 - report as well
179:53 - then click on run
179:55 - once you do that
179:57 - the rendering
179:59 - needs to be completed
180:01 - so let's see when it's completed
180:03 - you can just go to this location where
180:06 - you have saved the file and
180:08 - you would see that the changes have been
180:10 - made so here is the report table that we
180:12 - just created the excel sheet and this is
180:15 - how it is looking
180:16 - uh it has been rendered as it is we
180:19 - required like all the changes all the
180:21 - rules have been applied so that's all
180:23 - for the render tool and that's all for
180:25 - this video as well thanks for watching
180:28 - hello everyone welcome to ultrex
180:30 - tutorials in this video we are going to
180:32 - talk about the creation of a visual data
180:36 - representation in ultrix so it is
180:39 - possible through
180:40 - different tools but we would be looking
180:42 - at the table tool and the interactive
180:45 - chart tool which are primarily used for
180:48 - this purpose so if we talk about the
180:51 - table tool we have studied all about it
180:53 - in the previous video in case you
180:55 - haven't watched it already i would
180:56 - recommend you to just go there and watch
180:59 - it first to understand its basics
181:01 - because in this video i'm not just going
181:03 - to explain the basics again i'm simply
181:06 - just going to show you the application
181:08 - of the uh table tool
181:10 - especially the bar chart part
181:12 - so let's just go to the table tool or
181:15 - this is the basic table tool that we
181:16 - have been using
181:18 - now here if you see there is this option
181:20 - of bar craft so what i have done over
181:22 - here is in this bar graph option i have
181:25 - selected sales
181:26 - and the settings all the settings i have
181:28 - kept as same
181:30 - okay or basically the default settings
181:33 - then what i have done is i have used the
181:35 - render tool and in the render tool i
181:37 - have
181:38 - uh outputted it in the form of a pdf
181:41 - file so once i run this workflow what
181:43 - would happen is i would be getting this
181:46 - kind of a report
181:47 - now all the settings for the table tool
181:50 - are same as we did for the previous file
181:53 - but the format of the file has changed
181:55 - from excel to pdf right now now you can
181:58 - see all these things have been shown
182:00 - like this only but whatever the sales
182:02 - amount is like 732 is the sales amount
182:04 - so a bar a slide bar of light blue color
182:07 - is shown along with its value 71 for 90.
182:11 - so this is how the bar chart tool works
182:14 - we have selected it for the sales value
182:15 - so for the sales value
182:17 - this is how it's been shown
182:19 - like it shows us the bar
182:21 - that would
182:22 - roughly give us an estimate of the
182:24 - quantity that is being or the total
182:26 - sales amount that it is contributing
182:29 - ah with respect to the total amount so
182:32 - this is how we can use the bar chart of
182:34 - the visual representation within a table
182:36 - using the table tool
182:38 - now let us move on to the tool that is
182:39 - specifically designed for this purpose
182:41 - and that is the interactive chart tool
182:44 - so first of all let me just save this
182:46 - workflow and close it because we don't
182:48 - need it anymore
182:50 - we are going to take a look at the
182:51 - interactive chart tool now
182:54 - now what is this interactive chart tool
182:56 - it is used to basically visualize the
182:58 - data in the workflow we can create
183:00 - charts uh interactive multi-layered bar
183:02 - charts line graphs scatter plots pie
183:05 - charts and more we can use your uh the
183:08 - data set that we've been using to
183:10 - calculate the sum count average minimum
183:12 - maximum of the selected fields and
183:14 - output them into the different file
183:17 - types again using the render tool so
183:19 - first of all let's just get the input
183:21 - file this is our input tool let me just
183:23 - get the file i'm starting with a simple
183:25 - file so let's just go with this course
183:27 - file right now
183:30 - and now what i'm gonna do is apply the
183:32 - interactive chart
183:34 - uh tool over here okay
183:36 - so
183:38 - we can just configure the chart by
183:40 - clicking on this configure chart option
183:43 - and it's going to open up this kind of a
183:45 - dialog box the interactive chart dialog
183:46 - box which would help us to configure the
183:49 - chart okay so we can just create the
183:51 - chart over here
183:53 - in this as you can see there is a format
183:55 - of a chart that's been given to us
183:57 - so we can just create the chart like
183:59 - this
184:01 - control the zoom control the
184:03 - location and everything okay
184:06 - so for this data first you have to
184:08 - ensure that what kind of a chart you
184:10 - want to create i want to create a bar
184:12 - chart okay
184:13 - so once you are in this interactive
184:15 - chart
184:16 - workflow you can just go to create click
184:19 - on layer and here you need to just
184:21 - select on add layer option
184:23 - uh you can give a name to the layer by
184:25 - default it's taken as layer 0 but you
184:27 - can give it any name so what i'm going
184:29 - to do is i'm just going to add bar
184:31 - chart okay
184:34 - then we have the type option in this you
184:37 - need to just select the type of the
184:38 - chart to the bar
184:40 - then uh we have the
184:42 - x which means you need to select the
184:44 - column of which you want on the x axis
184:47 - so i want the uh score on the x-axis on
184:51 - the y-axis i want the number of hours
184:53 - okay
184:54 - so that's number of hours
184:56 - and scores to be taken over here okay
184:59 - then what we can do is we can just
185:06 - go to the template if you want a
185:08 - particular template to be used otherwise
185:10 - we can just
185:12 - go with it and
185:15 - so once you have made all the changes as
185:17 - per your choice you can just close that
185:19 - dialog box and bring in the browse tool
185:22 - this would help you to take a look at
185:23 - the chart that you have created so this
185:25 - is the bar chart that we have created
185:27 - based on the data
185:29 - as you can see um
185:31 - here is 98 that is the score and nine is
185:34 - the number of the hours the student has
185:36 - studied so this is how we have got the
185:38 - chart for us but
185:40 - uh if you want to just zoom in you can
185:42 - just zoom in and out of it to get a
185:43 - better look at how the things are
185:45 - looking inside the chart
185:48 - right so this is how basically the chart
185:50 - is created and if you want to create it
185:52 - for different things what we can do is
185:54 - first of all get rid of this data set
185:58 - and bring in our sales data because it
186:00 - has more scope of grading charts it has
186:02 - more values right
186:04 - so let's just go to this output excel
186:06 - file
186:07 - and get in our consumer data set right
186:10 - again we go to this chart option
186:11 - configure chart
186:14 - now there are all types of
186:15 - configurations that you can apply uh
186:18 - right now you can see the score and the
186:19 - number of hours is missing so what we
186:21 - can do is just get rid of it add a new
186:24 - layer
186:24 - again it's going to be a bar chart
186:30 - right now the type is again going to be
186:32 - bar
186:33 - in the column uh i'm just going to get
186:35 - the
186:37 - in the x axis i'm just going to get the
186:40 - sales amount
186:42 - and in the y i'm just going to get the
186:45 - category
186:47 - okay so the category by sales is what i
186:49 - want
186:50 - uh next what i can do is just basically
186:53 - close it go to the browse tool and run
186:55 - it to get the overview
186:58 - it's going to take a few seconds
187:00 - depending upon the processing speed of
187:02 - your computer and then it would render
187:04 - an output for you
187:06 - so once we have made the changes uh then
187:10 - this is how the output would be looking
187:12 - uh this is the sales on the basis of the
187:15 - category that is furniture office
187:16 - applies in the technology category
187:19 - and these are the individual sales
187:20 - records that we are getting right now
187:22 - okay uh now using this uh chart tool we
187:26 - can actually configure the chart the way
187:28 - we like okay so there are multiple
187:30 - configuration options that are available
187:33 - like if you just go to this layer option
187:35 - there are these different types of um
187:39 - options that you can perform
187:42 - like uh the opacity you can select the
187:44 - border width you can select
187:46 - the border color you can just select and
187:48 - everything like this okay
187:51 - so this is how it's gonna look
187:54 - um
187:56 - we can just select the different bar
187:57 - modes like stack or overlay
188:00 - or relative to one another
188:04 - next we have is the option for the
188:06 - legion so if you want to work with the
188:08 - legions like if you want to show the
188:10 - lesions or not
188:11 - then you can just select them also you
188:13 - can just
188:15 - hide them all together if you don't want
188:17 - to be shown
188:19 - in the layers panel
188:21 - here you can just select the orientation
188:23 - of the chart as well
188:25 - like this
188:29 - okay
188:30 - so this is what we can do
188:33 - then we have this access part where we
188:35 - can just select the display range like
188:38 - what is the maximum and the minimum
188:39 - range that you want
188:41 - the access line you want to show or hide
188:43 - the grid lines you want to show or hide
188:47 - etc all these things you can just select
188:49 - okay
188:52 - and then we have the batch if you want
188:54 - to create patched charts or not
188:56 - so this is how we work with these charts
188:58 - uh this is a simple bar chart that we
189:00 - have created now let us just move on to
189:03 - another type of a chart uh that we are
189:05 - going to create which is a pie chart
189:06 - let's just see how do we create that
189:08 - real quick
189:10 - so what i'm gonna do is just create a
189:12 - new workflow
189:14 - and in this i'm just going to copy these
189:16 - two
189:17 - tools
189:19 - actually the three tools can be copied
189:22 - all of these three rules can be copied
189:24 - and pasted over here
189:26 - now for the pie chart what we are going
189:27 - to do is actually create it on the basis
189:30 - of the sales and the category that means
189:32 - there are three categories and i'm just
189:34 - going to get the bifurcated amount of
189:36 - sales for each of these categories
189:38 - so um
189:40 - let's see how do we do that
189:42 - so in the configure chart option we go
189:44 - to the layer and just select the type to
189:47 - pi
189:48 - the values i have taken to sales and the
189:51 - labels i have set to category this is
189:53 - how it is looking
189:55 - and the name of course i have renamed it
189:57 - to pie chart for more clarity on what is
189:59 - going on
190:00 - now this is how it is looking it is
190:02 - giving me the percentage of the sales
190:04 - in case you want to give it a chart
190:06 - title you can just click here and
190:09 - provide it with a title
190:10 - or if you want to save it as a png file
190:12 - you can just click on this floppy disk
190:14 - icon and you would be able to save it so
190:17 - i'm just going to save it as a chart
190:20 - and let's just see how it is looking so
190:22 - this is my chart.png
190:25 - this is how it's looking this is a
190:26 - legend that tells you that blue
190:28 - represents technology orange represents
190:30 - furniture and green represents office
190:32 - supplies so that's how the charts are
190:34 - created in ultrix that's all for this
190:35 - video thanks for watching
190:39 - hello everyone welcome to altrex
190:41 - tutorials in this video we are going to
190:43 - take a look at the chart creation
190:45 - process only
190:47 - but in this video we are going to take a
190:49 - look at how can we create batch charts
190:51 - and what is basically the concept of
190:53 - batch charts in ultrix so the batch
190:56 - charts are basically used to group the
190:58 - data as we
191:00 - previously saw in the video that we
191:02 - created a pie chart which provided us
191:04 - the sales percentage and the sales
191:07 - amount on the basis of the category now
191:09 - there are two things as we know in our
191:11 - data set that are present for grouping
191:13 - the data that is category and
191:14 - subcategory
191:16 - so here we have category and then we
191:17 - have sub category so what i want to do
191:20 - is i want to create separate pie charts
191:22 - for three separate categories
191:24 - firstly in the furniture
191:26 - category chart i want the different sub
191:30 - categories that are part of the
191:32 - furniture and then i want them to show
191:33 - me that what is the total sales that has
191:36 - been done in each of these categories
191:39 - right similarly i want to create it for
191:41 - office supplies category and then for
191:43 - the technology category now instead of
191:45 - creating three charts
191:47 - each for separate categories what i'm
191:48 - going gonna do is i'm just going to
191:50 - create a single chart
191:52 - with the help of the bad chart option
191:54 - alteryx would automatically create
191:56 - copies of the same chart for me right so
191:58 - let us see how we are going to do that
192:02 - here what we have is three tools the
192:04 - input tool the
192:06 - chart tool and the browse tool so first
192:08 - of all let's just go to the interactive
192:10 - chart tool click on configure chart
192:11 - option in the configuration panel
192:13 - to open up this interactive chart okay
192:16 - now first of all you need to go to this
192:17 - batch option and by default it would be
192:19 - turned to off so you need to click it to
192:21 - on
192:23 - it would ask you to select the columns
192:25 - through which you are going to group by
192:26 - your options so uh i'm going to group
192:29 - them by category so from the drop down
192:31 - you can just select category if you want
192:34 - another field through which you want to
192:35 - group it by so you can select the second
192:37 - field as well
192:39 - if you want custom title for the batched
192:41 - charts that you can
192:43 - do
192:44 - but i'm not just going to go with it uh
192:46 - the category is written and i'm fine
192:48 - with it okay
192:49 - next go to the layers option click on
192:52 - add layer
192:53 - and let's just provide it a name like pi
192:56 - chart
193:01 - okay
193:02 - now select the type to pi
193:05 - for the values what i'm going to do is
193:07 - select the sales value
193:09 - and let's just give it a few seconds
193:13 - till it is going to fetch all the
193:14 - records from the sales and put them over
193:16 - here
193:17 - so this kind of a chart is being
193:18 - generated which is of course very
193:20 - difficult to understand because it is
193:22 - not a correct chart
193:24 - then what i am going to do in the labels
193:25 - column i am going to select the sub
193:28 - category
193:29 - so now
193:31 - our chart is clean and what we are
193:32 - getting over here is the name of the
193:34 - category which is furniture
193:36 - now in this furniture we have four sub
193:38 - categories the chairs which is
193:40 - represented in the blue color tables
193:42 - represented in the orange color
193:44 - bookcase is represented in the green
193:46 - color and furnishings represented in the
193:48 - red color so the total sales of the
193:50 - furniture
193:53 - whatever the total sales value of the
193:55 - furnitures was it has been bifurcated
193:58 - into these four subcategories and
194:01 - it has uh taken the percentages as this
194:04 - so in the furniture most of the sales
194:06 - has been done by chairs that is 43.6
194:08 - percent then if we just click on the
194:11 - second page we would have the office
194:13 - supplies category
194:15 - which combines these subcategories from
194:17 - storage till fasteners
194:20 - now in each of these sub categories how
194:22 - the bifurcation of the sales has been
194:24 - done is being shown on the percentage
194:26 - basis on the third we have the third
194:28 - subcategory which is the technology
194:30 - category having four subcategories again
194:32 - with phones accessories machines and
194:34 - copiers
194:36 - now what customizations we can do over
194:37 - here is
194:39 - by going into this chart option
194:44 - uh and in this font option like if you
194:45 - want to change the font it says
194:47 - everything that you can change like if
194:50 - you want to increase the size so as to
194:51 - get a better look at what is happening
194:53 - over here
194:54 - okay
194:55 - then we have layers option through which
194:57 - you can just uh change the colors like
195:00 - these are the colors that have been
195:01 - taken by default but if you want some
195:03 - other color scheme to be there you want
195:05 - some other
195:06 - colors to be there that also you can
195:08 - change
195:09 - okay
195:11 - like this the divergent scales are there
195:15 - or the sequential scales are there to
195:19 - for a particular color that you can just
195:21 - select okay
195:22 - uh then we have the slice label that is
195:24 - what you want to be shown on the slice
195:26 - label right now the percentage has been
195:28 - shown if you want the value has to be
195:29 - shown as well that means what is the
195:31 - total number of sales that was done that
195:34 - you want to show and the label that
195:36 - means the value of the subcategory that
195:38 - to which subcategory it belongs that
195:40 - also you can select i'm just going with
195:42 - label and percentage not with the value
195:43 - part
195:44 - the order is sorted which means they are
195:46 - all sorted and if you want to show the
195:49 - legend or not this is the legion part
195:50 - you want to show it you want to hide it
195:53 - and then if you just hover over it then
195:56 - we are getting some additional
195:57 - information as well so that is uh
196:00 - controlled through this over text value
196:02 - so i don't want the percentage to be
196:04 - shown i just want the label and the
196:05 - values to be shown over here okay
196:06 - because the percentage is already
196:08 - visible over here
196:10 - next we have is the chart option which
196:11 - you can use to set the width of the
196:14 - chart
196:15 - in pixels or in inches
196:17 - you can just select the um
196:19 - margins and the padding color etc the
196:23 - background color of the chart everything
196:25 - that you want you can just control from
196:26 - here okay
196:28 - so this is a custom color that i want
196:31 - uh this is the title
196:34 - if you want to change the title you can
196:35 - change it over here using latex or using
196:39 - a simple
196:40 - uh text as well
196:41 - then we have the access option
196:43 - which is not uh been used over here next
196:46 - we have is the legion if you want to
196:48 - just change the way the legend is being
196:50 - shown that you can do you can just work
196:53 - with its size its color
196:56 - let me just get a black color for the
196:57 - legend
196:59 - for better visibility
197:01 - then we have the box if you want a box
197:04 - to be there on the legend
197:06 - the color of the border for the legion
197:08 - it's going to be red
197:11 - and the background color or if you want
197:13 - a different background color let's just
197:14 - go with
197:16 - this kind of color
197:18 - the orientation you wanted vertically or
197:20 - horizontally like this
197:22 - and the layer order of
197:24 - that what is the order of the layers
197:27 - accordingly you want that or not okay so
197:29 - this is where it is starting from
197:31 - storage all the way to fasteners okay
197:34 - uh then
197:35 - you can just close this
197:37 - and using the browse tool you can just
197:39 - run the browse tool to get a look at the
197:42 - chart
197:47 - so here it is how it is looking you can
197:49 - just adjust it
197:51 - and see that these three charts are
197:52 - lined one after the other
197:55 - now let us just render this chart using
197:57 - the render tool so let's just delete
197:59 - this browse tool for a bit
198:02 - go to the reporting and here we have
198:04 - this render
198:06 - in this render what i'm gonna do is just
198:09 - select the
198:12 - specific output file and save it
198:16 - uh in the form of
198:18 - png images three images would be created
198:21 - and select
198:23 - bulk charts or batch charts okay
198:30 - now click on save
198:32 - and if you just go to that location
198:36 - bad charts.png
198:38 - is what we are getting over here
198:42 - okay so let me just
198:44 - take a look at this
198:52 - so uh this is the kind of the image that
198:54 - we are getting over here
198:57 - and if you just zoom in these are being
199:00 - created like this
199:01 - uh in the form of a png image okay now
199:04 - let's see what happens if we just um
199:06 - store it in the form of a pdf document
199:09 - so for saving it i'm just going to
199:12 - select a pdf document
199:16 - here
199:17 - and just select batch charts as the name
199:23 - click on save
199:25 - and click on run to run the workflow so
199:28 - that the actual uh saving process occurs
199:32 - okay now let's just see how it is
199:34 - looking
199:37 - so here it is three pages have been
199:38 - created for the pdf each for a different
199:40 - category along with its legend along
199:43 - with its chart along with its everything
199:46 - so this is how we can use the render
199:48 - button to render the batch charts for us
199:51 - and that's all for this video with this
199:53 - we wrap up the whole uh tutorial course
199:56 - on ultrix as well
199:58 - during this course we learned about the
200:00 - different tools and their
200:02 - functionalities we also got to
200:04 - see that what all actions we can perform
200:07 - through alteryx
200:08 - and we got to understand that there are
200:10 - a bunch of things that we can do now
200:13 - with more practice we would be able to
200:14 - create a really good charts for us
200:17 - render them and
200:19 - use it as the tool it is meant to be
200:22 - so that's all for this video that's all
200:24 - for this course
200:26 - i hope you all learned something new
200:28 - throughout this course i really hope you
200:29 - all enjoyed this journey
200:31 - uh thanks for watching goodbye
