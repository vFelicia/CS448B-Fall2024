00:02 - shown you how to use open file dialogue
00:05 - with your Visual Basic Windows Form
00:07 - application so I have created a simple
00:10 - form and when I click the button it was
00:13 - able to open
00:15 - a open file dialogue and in which we can
00:18 - choose any file from that now in this
00:21 - video I will show you how to open or
00:25 - execute any exe file with the help of
00:29 - your Visual Basic Windows Form
00:31 - application using your open file
00:33 - dialogue so suppose you want to open a
00:37 - PDF file or do or a doc file or a web
00:40 - browser or any executable application
