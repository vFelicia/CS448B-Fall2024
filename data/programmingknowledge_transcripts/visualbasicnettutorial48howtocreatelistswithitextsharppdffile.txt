00:00 - hello guys welcome once again in the
00:02 - last video I have shown you how to
00:03 - create a PDF file using a thirdparty DL
00:06 - called itex shop with your Visual Basic
00:09 - Windows Form application and I have also
00:11 - shown you how to create a paragraph in
00:14 - the PDF file and how to create a new
00:16 - page in the PDF file so if you have some
00:20 - doubts and you don't know how I created
00:24 - the PDF file then just watch the last
00:27 - video and this is the code we have
00:30 - written last time now in this video I
00:33 - want to show you how to add a list to
00:36 - your itex shop PDF file using your
00:40 - Visual Basic Windows Form application so
00:43 - basically I'm going to use the same code
00:45 - to create the document but in this
00:48 - document I am going to uh add a list so
00:53 - let's see how can we do it but first of
00:55 - all let's enclose our uh code in a try
01:00 - blocks so that if any error occurs it
01:02 - can catch the exceptions so at the top
01:05 - of my button click event I will write
01:08 - try and I will press enter and this will
01:11 - make a TR C block and I will copy the
01:15 - all the code I have written last time
01:16 - and I will paste it in
01:19 - the triy block you can what you can also
01:23 - do is you
01:26 - can give a
01:30 - finally clause in your TR cat block and
01:33 - you can close this document in the
01:37 - finally so finally when your try catch
01:41 - try code is executed then
01:45 - this will uh be called and your document
01:48 - will be closed okay so this also you can
01:51 - do but I will give on in the tri block
01:57 - itself my
02:00 - close of my document and in the catch
02:03 - block I'm going to show the exceptions I
02:05 - will
02:07 - say message
02:09 - boox do
02:13 - show and I'm going to show the exception
02:16 - so I will say ex do message okay so this
02:22 - will show any exception if any exception
02:26 - occurs
02:27 - now I am going to create only one page
02:31 - so I will delete this code which I have
02:33 - written for creating the new page and
02:36 - this is my code for making a paragraph
02:41 - in a PDF file now I want to add a list
02:45 - in this so I will go below this uh line
02:49 - where I have written PDF dog. add a new
02:53 - paragraph which is which says hello
02:55 - world and just below this I will create
02:58 - a list
03:00 - so in here I will just first of all copy
03:04 - and paste my code this is the code to
03:06 - create the list and I now I will explain
03:08 - what this code is doing in this code I
03:11 - have declared a variable called list as
03:15 - uh object of a class list from your
03:18 - artex shop class okay and then I in the
03:23 - bracket I have pass the argument which
03:25 - kind of list this is so I will say copy
03:27 - this list Dot unordered this
03:32 - unordered can be changed with number of
03:35 - type of list for example alalal list
03:39 - numerical ordered unordered uppercase
03:42 - these are all the option you can choose
03:44 - but for now I'm choosing unordered list
03:49 - okay so this
03:51 - is the list and in the second line I'm
03:55 - providing the indent so let's just
04:00 - comment this line for now and I will
04:03 - show you what this indent is doing
04:06 - afterwards and then I will just copy my
04:09 - list object do add and I will add a new
04:13 - list item in this list so I will say new
04:16 - list item and just in the bracket just
04:20 - pass whatever list item you want to give
04:22 - for example one and in this same way I'm
04:27 - going to add some more item in the list
04:29 - so just write list. add and Whatever
04:32 - item you have I have added five four
04:35 - more item to my list which are 2 3 4 5
04:39 - so I have the list of 1 2 3 4 5 which is
04:42 - unordered list right and then I create a
04:46 - paragraph which can be the title of your
04:50 - list so just
04:54 - write or just copy this PDF
04:57 - doc object do
05:00 - add and just add a new paragraph so just
05:03 - write new paragraph and inside this
05:06 - write the title of your list and then
05:09 - after this just add the list itself so
05:12 - just write PDF dog. add list which is
05:16 - your this list now when I run the
05:21 - program and when I click this create PDF
05:25 - it is created in my project folder if
05:27 - you remember last time right so project
05:30 - folder bin debug and this is my PDF file
05:33 - so I will open
05:35 - this and you see here a list is created
05:39 - which is unordered list and which
05:42 - contains the item 1 2 3 4 5 now every
05:46 - time you run your program for example
05:50 - just I click this create PDF you need to
05:55 - close this PDF otherwise this will show
05:59 - show an error so right now for example
06:02 - my PDF is opened and I'm trying to
06:05 - create an PDF which is open in my
06:10 - Acrobat Reader right so I click this
06:13 - button will show an error you see this
06:18 - is the error message which is coming
06:21 - from T TR catch block and it's showing
06:23 - the message that the process cannot be
06:26 - uh cannot be ex cannot be processed
06:30 - because this is used by another process
06:34 - right and once you close your PDF file
06:37 - and once again you create PDF then it
06:39 - will not show any error so you just
06:42 - remember that whenever you are creating
06:44 - the PDF your PDF should be closed right
06:48 - so this is a small
06:50 - tip now suppose we want
06:52 - to add a indent to our list indent is
06:57 - just like the spaces just like this so
07:02 - it's one indent two indent just like
07:05 - this and the unit of indent is f so
07:10 - I'm providing 30 F indent to the left
07:14 - left is this side okay so this is the
07:19 - indent part okay now when I run the
07:23 - program once again and I create the PDF
07:25 - and I have open the PDF once again you
07:29 - you can see we have an indent in our
07:32 - list which is this part of the list item
07:39 - so in this way you can give the indent
07:43 - to your list okay now what I'm going to
07:47 - do
07:48 - is I'm going to add one more list which
07:52 - is of a Kind Roman list so this is a
07:57 - normal list and you can add different
08:00 - type of list with in your PDF file so
08:04 - this time I'm going to add a Roman list
08:06 - right so just below
08:09 - my when where I have ended adding the
08:13 - list and above my PDF docs. close I will
08:19 - copy and paste
08:22 - the Roman list code here so this is the
08:26 - Roman list code so we have one once
08:29 - again declared uh variable of class
08:33 - Roman list so just write dim Roman list
08:35 - as New Roman list and in the bracket
08:39 - just write true comma 20 and then just
08:43 - copy this Roman list variable and once
08:46 - again we are going to provide the indent
08:48 - so just write Roman list. indent left so
08:51 - it will provide the indent to the left
08:54 - is equal to 30f whatever you can play
08:56 - with this unit to give the
09:00 - didn't and then I have simply added the
09:03 - new items to my list like this like I
09:06 - have done for my last list right and
09:10 - then in the paragraph I have given a new
09:14 - title to my list which is a Roman list
09:17 - and then I have added the Roman list
09:21 - itself to my document so this is a code
09:24 - for creating a Roman list and once again
09:27 - I will run my program and I will click
09:30 - create list and once again when I open
09:34 - this you see there is a Roman list Roman
09:37 - list means
09:39 - these list items are in Roman case right
09:44 - one two 3 4 5 okay
09:50 - now suppose you want to add one list
09:53 - inside other list this can also be done
09:57 - so for example you want to
10:00 - add
10:01 - this normal unordered list in your Roman
10:05 - list what you can do
10:08 - is you can just delete or not delete but
10:13 - comment this title of this list
10:17 - first so I will just comment this so
10:23 - this is the title because we are we are
10:25 - going to uh insert this normal list
10:29 - inside this uh Roman list so I have uh
10:33 - commented out the title and I will copy
10:36 - the title of the list and add to the
10:39 - instead of fifth item I'll add list here
10:43 - so
10:44 - just in the Roman list what I'm going to
10:48 - do is I'm going to give the title of my
10:50 - list
10:56 - and and in the next line I will copy
10:58 - this code once again again and paste it
11:01 - down and I will copy the list variable
11:04 - we have created which is list is cell
11:07 - and in here I will paste this list
11:10 - variable so what this code will do is it
11:14 - will create a list of Roman list and
11:18 - inside this list we have another list
11:21 - which is nested list which is of kind
11:25 - unordered list so let's see what is the
11:27 - result of this kind of list create
11:31 - document and I'll will open my simple
11:34 - PDF once again and you can see here I
11:37 - have the
11:39 - O Roman list and inside my Roman list I
11:44 - have my normal list so to make it more
11:50 - clear I'm not going to add my list in
11:54 - here inside my document but I will just
11:57 - show the Roman list
11:59 - L and I will just cut this and I will
12:04 - add it after the second item so if you
12:08 - want just copy this code and once again
12:11 - when I run the program create document
12:14 - it's already open so I will need to
12:16 - close it once again click and I will
12:20 - open my document and now you can
12:23 - understand better so after after my
12:25 - second Roman list item I'm inserting the
12:28 - Third
12:30 - third item which is a list okay so you
12:34 - can make a nested list also so in this
12:38 - way you can make list with your itch
12:42 - shop dll and your Visual Basic Windows
12:45 - Form application project I hope you have
12:48 - enjoyed this video please RIT comment
12:49 - and subscribe and bye for now
