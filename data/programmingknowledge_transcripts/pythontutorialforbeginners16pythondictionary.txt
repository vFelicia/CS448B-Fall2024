00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video and
00:02 - Python tutorial for beginners in this
00:04 - video I'm going to show you how to use
00:06 - dictionaries in Python so first of all
00:09 - what are dictionaries so dictionaries in
00:12 - Python are like associative lists or a
00:15 - map now you can think of dictionary as a
00:20 - list of pairs so let me show you how to
00:24 - define a dictionary so you can define
00:26 - any variable name and to define a
00:29 - dictionary first of all you use these
00:31 - curly brackets and inside these curly
00:34 - brackets you provide a list of key value
00:37 - pairs so let's provide the list of key
00:41 - value pairs so first key is name and the
00:45 - name is max the second key is for
00:50 - example age and the age of Max is let's
00:55 - say 14 and we can also write here in
00:59 - which year he was born so we can just
01:02 - write here and he was born in 2004 for
01:07 - example and I'm going to press ENTER
01:09 - here and once again I'm going to just
01:12 - access the values inside this dictionary
01:15 - which is D and you can see our
01:17 - dictionary is created now so as I said
01:21 - dictionary is a list of key value pairs
01:24 - and all these values which you see here
01:27 - before this colon are called keys so
01:31 - name is a key here here is a key here
01:34 - and ade is a key here and whatever
01:37 - values you see after the colon are
01:41 - called values so max is a value 2004 is
01:45 - a value and 14 is a value and you can
01:48 - access the values from a dictionary
01:50 - based upon their keys so for example I
01:54 - have this dictionary D I can use the
01:57 - square bracket and the key name for
01:59 - example I want to get the name value I
02:03 - can just give the name key here and then
02:06 - press ENTER and it's going to return me
02:08 - the Associated value related to key name
02:12 - in the same way
02:13 - you can use other keys also for example
02:16 - age and I'm going to press ENTER and
02:19 - it's going to give me 14 which is the
02:21 - value so age is a key here and 14 is the
02:25 - value now what type of data types you
02:28 - can store in a dictionary so as key you
02:31 - can define any data type so let me
02:34 - define a new dictionary here and I'm
02:37 - going to give these curly brackets and
02:39 - as I said you can define a string value
02:43 - as key also you can define a number as a
02:46 - key for example 15 : 15 let's try the
02:51 - float values so I'm going to just write
02:53 - 15 0.1 : 15 0.1 this is also allowed in
02:59 - dictionary so you can use string values
03:02 - you can use integer values you can use
03:05 - decimal values as key and also let's try
03:09 - the boolean value so you can use the
03:13 - boolean values also as keys and you can
03:17 - use a couple also as a key so I'm going
03:20 - to just give a tuple two comma three and
03:23 - then I'm going to assign a value of five
03:26 - to this key and as values also you can
03:29 - use string values or decimal values or
03:32 - integer values or a boolean values or
03:34 - any kind of collection you can use as a
03:38 - value so I'm going to press ENTER here
03:40 - and now to access let's say we want to
03:42 - access the value for this key which is
03:46 - this tuple so I'm going to just enter
03:49 - this tuple inside these square brackets
03:51 - and it's going to return me five or I
03:55 - can just provide inside the square
03:57 - bracket true here and then press Enter
04:00 - it's going to return me the value which
04:04 - is associated with it which is true
04:06 - itself or I can just write here 15 and
04:10 - it's going to return me 15 in turn
04:12 - because 15 is associated with this value
04:15 - which is also 15 now what happens when a
04:18 - key is not there and we try to access it
04:21 - so I'm going to just access hundred from
04:24 - this a dictionary it's going to give us
04:27 - error that this key is not present in
04:30 - the dictionary you can also use the LAN
04:32 - method to find out the number of items
04:35 - in the dictionary and you can see it
04:37 - says five items are there in the
04:39 - dictionary II and we can count this item
04:42 - so this is one item two item three item
04:45 - for item and the fifth item is here or
04:48 - in other words you can also say that
04:51 - Elian function is going to return you
04:53 - the number of key value pairs which are
04:55 - stored in dictionary you can also use
04:59 - for example I'm going to use my D
05:02 - dictionary now and you can also use a
05:05 - method called get and then you can give
05:09 - the key name here in the parenthesis so
05:12 - let's say I want to get that value
05:14 - associated with the name key I can get
05:18 - it like this and it's going to give me
05:20 - the value associated with the name key
05:24 - you can also add a new key so this D
05:27 - dictionary you can see there are right
05:29 - now three key value pairs and I can add
05:32 - one more key value pair so to add a key
05:35 - value pair you need to just write D and
05:39 - in the square bracket you just need to
05:41 - give the name of the new key so I'm
05:44 - going to just write surname here which
05:47 - is the name of the new key in the
05:49 - dictionary D and then you need to give
05:51 - the value associated with that key so
05:55 - when I press ENTER and once again when I
05:58 - try to access the values inside the
06:01 - dictionary now you can see that surname
06:05 - is added to your dictionary now if you
06:08 - want to remove any key value pair from a
06:11 - list then you can use d dot pop method
06:15 - and then the name of the key which you
06:17 - want to remove let's say we want to
06:19 - remove the surname once again which we
06:21 - have added and you can just press enter
06:24 - and now you can just print the values
06:27 - inside D now you can see the surname key
06:30 - value pair is remove you can also use a
06:34 - clear function so let's see what's there
06:37 - in the e dictionary so these are the
06:39 - values inside
06:40 - dictionary I can use a dot clear - clear
06:44 - the values inside the dictionary so once
06:48 - again when I try to access e it will
06:51 - give me the empty dictionary also you
06:54 - can delete the dictionary using de el
06:57 - function and the name of the dictionary
06:59 - and when I press ENTER and when I try to
07:02 - access this dictionary e once again it's
07:04 - going to say that this name is not
07:07 - defined you can also update the values
07:09 - in a dictionary so this is my dictionary
07:11 - and I want to update the name for
07:13 - example so I can use the dictionary name
07:16 - and then the key here for example name
07:19 - and the new name I want to associate
07:22 - with this key is let's say a new name
07:25 - here and when I try to access this
07:28 - dictionary once again
07:30 - you can see the name is changed you can
07:32 - also use a method called update to
07:35 - update this key value pair so once again
07:38 - I want to change the key value pair
07:41 - which is name so I can give this curly
07:44 - bracket and then give the key value pair
07:46 - which I want to change so name and the
07:50 - new name will be max once again
07:52 - and once again when I try to access the
07:54 - dictionary it will give me this
07:57 - dictionary and you can see the name is
07:59 - updated now now there is a function in
08:02 - dictionary called keys which is used to
08:05 - list out all the keys of that dictionary
08:08 - so you can see it will list out all the
08:10 - keys of the particular dictionary there
08:15 - is also a function called values which
08:17 - will list out all the values of that
08:20 - dictionary if you want to list out all
08:23 - the key value pairs you can use the
08:26 - function called items here it will give
08:28 - you the key value pair list now the last
08:32 - function I want to show here is let me
08:34 - list out the content of the dictionary
08:36 - first of all so there is one more
08:38 - function which you can use here is which
08:40 - is pop item and you don't need to give
08:43 - any argument with this pop item when you
08:46 - press Enter
08:47 - it's going to remove the last key value
08:49 - pair which you have added or updated so
08:53 - here we have
08:54 - dated this name key value pair that's
08:57 - why this is removed and now when you try
09:00 - to see the content of the dictionary
09:03 - this name key value pair is removed so
09:07 - this is how you can use dictionaries in
09:09 - Python I hope you have enjoyed this
09:11 - video I will see you in the next video
