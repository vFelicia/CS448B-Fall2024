00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - HTML tutorial for beginners using html5
00:05 - in the last video I have shown you how
00:08 - you can download and install Eclipse IDE
00:11 - and notepad plus plus code editor in
00:15 - order to write your HTML code now in
00:18 - this video we will look at the basic
00:20 - structure of HTML code in detail and we
00:24 - will see what every term means in HTML
00:27 - so we are going to create a new project
00:31 - in Eclipse which will be static project
00:34 - and I'm going to name my project as my
00:39 - HTML or you can name it anything click
00:44 - Next and this will be the default folder
00:49 - in which your HTML document can reside
00:53 - which is web content and click finish
00:55 - it's going to create you a project now
00:59 - if you have already opened a project you
01:02 - will see two project in your Eclipse
01:06 - project Explorer now if you want to
01:10 - close your previous project you just
01:12 - need to select your previous project
01:14 - right click on it and you can just close
01:18 - it closing just means that this project
01:21 - is closed and it will not be taken into
01:23 - the consideration in Eclipse but if you
01:27 - want to delete it from this plural
01:30 - project Explorer what you can do is
01:32 - right-click it and just click delete and
01:35 - it's not going to delete this project
01:38 - from your computer unless you check this
01:41 - checkbox it's going to delete this
01:43 - project from your project Explorer here
01:46 - right so now we have our project here
01:49 - now in the web content we are going to
01:52 - create a new HTML 5 which we will name
01:56 - it as for example test dot HTML and
02:00 - click finish and it's going to create a
02:03 - basic HTML page for us and Eclipse gives
02:09 - us this default HTML
02:12 - owed to us also now let's go in detail
02:16 - and let's see what each term means in
02:21 - HTML so first of all we will start with
02:25 - the comments now in order to write some
02:30 - comment you just need to give this angle
02:33 - bracket and then this exclamation mark
02:37 - and then two - symbols like this or -
02:41 - symbols and then - - and this this angle
02:46 - bracket and whatever you write in
02:48 - between it will be taken as a comment
02:51 - now comment are not the part of the code
02:54 - but they help us to read the code in a
02:59 - better way so they help us in code
03:03 - readability right now what are these
03:08 - things so first of all there are three
03:11 - terms you need to understand in HTML
03:14 - first is called a tag and a tag is just
03:19 - these two angle brackets and you can see
03:24 - here every element in HTML has this
03:28 - angle bracket right so this and this now
03:32 - whatever you write in this angle bracket
03:36 - is called tag name okay so this is a tag
03:41 - name and generally we have dotting tag
03:46 - and closing tags so tag name and this is
03:51 - called a totting tag and this is called
03:54 - a closing tag and the difference between
03:58 - starting tag and closing tag is this
04:01 - forward slash so whenever you add this
04:05 - forward slash in a tag it's a ending tag
04:09 - otherwise it's a starting tag and there
04:12 - is one more term which we call element
04:16 - so starting tag and ending tag and
04:19 - whatever you write in between for
04:21 - example some content inside the tag it's
04:25 - called
04:26 - element so element has starting tag some
04:31 - content and a closing tag right now
04:36 - there is one more term which is called
04:39 - attribute now an attribute is something
04:43 - which you can add to the starting tag
04:46 - for example some ID and then you gave
04:51 - the description of this attribute for
04:54 - example description okay
04:57 - so this is called the attribute okay so
05:02 - we have understood what is a tag what is
05:05 - an element and what is an attribute now
05:10 - let's get started with our code okay so
05:15 - in here first line you can see here is
05:20 - called a doc type and in detail it's
05:25 - called a document type and this helps
05:28 - the browsers to recognize that it's a
05:32 - HTML page right so this is just like a
05:37 - preamble for an HTML page so first of
05:42 - all you need to add this doctype in
05:45 - every HTML page as a first line of every
05:51 - HTML file okay now I'm going to delete
05:54 - everything and let's write it everything
05:57 - once again so first thing is the
06:00 - document type and document type start
06:04 - with this symbol and then just write
06:06 - doctype and then write HTML okay HTML is
06:11 - a non case-sensitive language so it
06:16 - doesn't matter if you write this word in
06:19 - capital or mixed letters or small
06:22 - letters it will interpret as same right
06:26 - so you can write it like this or you can
06:29 - light it like HTML it will be the same
06:32 - right now every HTML code start with
06:36 - these HTML tags
06:39 - okay and this tells the browser when it
06:43 - interprets it that this is the starting
06:47 - of your HTML code and this is the ending
06:50 - of your HTML code and in between
06:52 - whatever you write will be the content
06:55 - of your HTML now in a HTML document we
07:00 - have two main tags or main categories
07:05 - one is called a head and other is called
07:08 - the body so a head is something like
07:12 - this and in the head you can add the
07:16 - title of your HTML page and some
07:20 - metadata which you don't want to show
07:23 - but it's a part of your HTML page right
07:27 - now just below this head comes the body
07:32 - tag right and in this body whatever you
07:36 - will write it will be the content of
07:40 - your web page so it will be shown for
07:43 - example you want to add a paragraph
07:45 - heading or tables it will be enclosed in
07:49 - the body now the main tag or main
07:52 - element inside the head you can write is
07:55 - a title for your HTML document so just
08:00 - write title and whatever you write here
08:04 - will become the title so you can say my
08:08 - title okay and you can save this and you
08:12 - can just run your HTML page by
08:16 - right-clicking on it and you can just
08:19 - open with the web browser okay
08:23 - and you can see right now you don't see
08:28 - anything but here on the top you can see
08:31 - my title and this my title is due to
08:37 - this text okay or you can just change it
08:41 - my HTML save it and when you refresh it
08:45 - from here it becomes my HTML here right
08:49 - so this will become the title of your H
08:53 - webpage now you can open this HTML page
08:56 - from your web browser also which is not
09:01 - the native Eclipse but for example
09:02 - Firefox or Chrome browser you want to
09:05 - open your HTML what you can do is you
09:08 - can just go to the location where your
09:11 - project is and most probably it will be
09:14 - in your computer name then workspace
09:17 - then your project name in my case my
09:19 - project name is my HTML then go to web
09:22 - content folder and here I can see this
09:25 - test dot HTML you can just right click
09:28 - on it and then open with Firefox ok and
09:32 - it's going to open it like this and you
09:35 - can see the title is my HTML right now
09:38 - inside the body whatever you write it
09:41 - will become the body or it will be shown
09:45 - here right so for example there is a tag
09:49 - called paragraph and you can add it like
09:52 - this and inside this whatever you write
09:54 - it will be considered as a paragraph so
09:57 - for example save it and refresh your
10:01 - webpage and then you will see this
10:04 - paragraph in the body of your web
10:07 - browser right now there is one more
10:12 - popular tag which you can use here is
10:16 - the heading tag and there are different
10:20 - type of headings but for now let's add
10:24 - h1 tag here and you can say heading ok
10:29 - and refresh your web page and it will
10:33 - become your heading right now there are
10:36 - two more main thing which can be used in
10:42 - an HTML document one is the language you
10:46 - want to use in the HTML document and
10:50 - this is an attribute you can add to your
10:54 - HTML tag so for example you can add this
10:57 - tag in the starting of your HTML tag and
11:01 - this attribute is called Lang okay
11:06 - and then you can add different languages
11:10 - to your HTML tag attribute for example
11:13 - most commonly used is English but there
11:17 - are many languages which are supported
11:21 - here and this you can see when you
11:24 - google for list of iso 639 -1 codes and
11:29 - here you can see each and every code of
11:33 - every language which you can use here
11:37 - now second important thing here is a
11:40 - metadata tag called meta okay and here
11:46 - you can add an attribute called care set
11:50 - and most generally we use utf-8 but you
11:56 - can use other type of character set
11:59 - encoding also but this is the most
12:02 - widely used character set in HTML okay
12:07 - now you will notice here that this meta
12:11 - tag only have starting tag it doesn't
12:14 - have ending tag so it's not necessary to
12:19 - have in all cases the ending tag some
12:23 - tags are okay with the starting tag also
12:27 - and with an attribute also so what we
12:30 - have learnt today what are tags what are
12:33 - elements what are attributes and basic
12:37 - structure of HTML documents so that's it
12:41 - for this video I hope you enjoyed this
12:43 - video see you in the next video bye
