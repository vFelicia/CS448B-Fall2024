00:01 - [Music]
00:07 - hello guys welcome back to another
00:10 - tutorial hit the bell icon button so
00:12 - that you don't miss out any tutorial
00:15 - okay in this video we're going to check
00:18 - the accuracy of the multiple regression
00:21 - model that we created for the cancer
00:23 - data and so we will do this we'll look
00:28 - at this a couple of different ways we're
00:31 - going to use what's called RM SE RM s e
00:35 - so let me just write this down our MSE
00:39 - is the root of the mean squared error
00:42 - and so the idea here is that whenever we
00:45 - make an estimate with our model we can
00:48 - compare that to what the actual what the
00:51 - actual was so let's just do cancer mod
00:55 - rig our MSE on train and I'm being kind
01:01 - of detailed with the name there because
01:02 - we'll have different models and
01:04 - different accuracy measures and stuff so
01:06 - we'll have cancer the cancer mod and the
01:10 - cancer model regression on for our MSE
01:13 - on the training data set so what we'll
01:17 - do is take the training data set and
01:19 - will mutate and put the regression
01:26 - prediction for train as predict using
01:31 - cancer mod cancer mod reg okay
01:36 - so let's just look at what we created
01:40 - there okay so we created an estimate we
01:45 - added to our train data set an estimate
01:47 - prediction estimate based on our model
01:50 - and so using that predict function the
01:53 - predict function all we have to do is
01:55 - pass it the model and so we've we then
01:58 - created an estimate so you can see for
02:00 - the first observation our estimate was
02:02 - 180 3.9 according to our model and the
02:05 - actual was 170 9.5 the second one our
02:08 - estimate was 140 9.6 the actual was 120
02:11 - 4.1 and so on down the line so some of
02:13 - them are quite
02:14 - some of them are a little bit off and
02:16 - and that's just the idea so a lot of
02:17 - that is just currently unexplained error
02:20 - right we just don't have a perfect model
02:22 - no model is going to be perfect so there
02:25 - is some error there and so one of the
02:27 - first things we want to do is just plot
02:29 - and then we'll get back to our SRMs see
02:31 - in just a minute one of the first things
02:32 - we want to do is just plot we want to
02:37 - plot the actuals which would be the
02:39 - target death rate against the against
02:43 - our predicted values okay so let's do a
02:46 - simple scatter plot here and look at the
02:49 - horizontal axis is our actuals the
02:50 - vertical axis are our predicted models
02:53 - our predicted values and so you can see
02:55 - there's a nice positive correlation here
02:57 - they look like in general as the the
02:59 - actual values increased our predicted
03:01 - values increased so at least
03:03 - directionally we're in the right
03:04 - neighborhood we do have this outlier out
03:07 - here which kind of jumps out at you and
03:09 - so we saw this earlier in our
03:11 - exploratory analysis that there was an
03:13 - actual that had a death rate of above
03:14 - 350 was like 362 I believe and so the
03:18 - good news is that our model predicted
03:19 - that value quite high right it actually
03:22 - did a good job of predicting that value
03:24 - now here was the other outlier this was
03:26 - probably the one with high incidence
03:27 - rate but the the target death rate
03:29 - wasn't as high the target death rate was
03:31 - a bit lower so we predicted that
03:33 - unfortunately too high so that one kind
03:35 - of threw things off but for the rest of
03:36 - this this actually looks pretty good not
03:39 - perfect you know there's still some
03:40 - noise kind of going around here it looks
03:43 - like a cloud but but for our first
03:45 - attempt at multiple regression I think
03:47 - that that that's a good a good looking
03:49 - model so I would expect the error to not
03:51 - be to not be too terribly bad so the
03:53 - first thing we're going to do is create
03:55 - the mean squared error
03:56 - alright so mean squared error we're
03:57 - going to take that cancer mod reg MSE
04:01 - train and we're gonna run some
04:04 - calculations on it okay so we'll mutate
04:06 - that we're going to create the error
04:08 - which is just going to be the prediction
04:11 - on the regression for training data
04:13 - minus the target death rate okay so
04:17 - that's the actual then we'll have
04:19 - squared error is going to be simply
04:22 - error squared and so we'll pop that into
04:27 - summarize and so the mean squared error
04:30 - will be the mean of the squared error
04:33 - all right so let's go ahead and create
04:34 - this and then we'll take a look at what
04:36 - actually is is going on here
04:39 - actually let me we need to run this
04:42 - before we before we summarize so we keep
04:44 - all of our individual observations here
04:47 - and then before we summarize with the
04:48 - with the mean so what's happening is
04:51 - that we'll calculate the error so it's
04:52 - it's the 180 three point nine minus one
04:54 - seventy nine point four has an error of
04:56 - four point four this one is an error of
04:58 - twenty five point five this one has an
04:59 - error of negative 0.5 so what happens is
05:02 - that some of these will be high and some
05:04 - will be low in the way the regression
05:05 - works is if you added up all of these
05:07 - errors you would get zero because by
05:11 - design the regression the multiple
05:12 - regression algorithm creates residuals
05:16 - creates error measures that sum to zero
05:19 - it does a little bit that are high and a
05:22 - little bit that are low so on average
05:23 - it's right in the middle and so on
05:25 - average these residuals have a mean of
05:26 - zero so if we just add them up or if we
05:29 - take their mean it's going to be zero
05:32 - and so that's it's rather uninteresting
05:34 - to do that so what we do to get around
05:36 - that is to make them all positive by
05:38 - squaring them and then we just find the
05:41 - average of that so we make them all
05:43 - positive by squaring so that gives us
05:45 - the squared error and then we summarize
05:47 - that by taking the mean of the squared
05:51 - error so that's what we have here the
05:54 - mean of the squared error but then we
05:56 - want to get back into our scale so our
05:58 - MSE is going to be the square root of
06:00 - the mean squared error so to get back to
06:02 - scale the scale of our data since we
06:06 - squared them to make them all positive
06:08 - we got to take the square root of our
06:09 - numbers so our RMS see here is twenty
06:12 - one point two three two three four so
06:14 - training training RMS C equals 21 point
06:21 - two three four twenty-one point two
06:23 - three four so that that's nice you know
06:26 - some of these values the target rate
06:30 - values you know these are in the high
06:34 - 100's you know up into the 200s at time
06:37 - so for an error our average error you
06:40 - can think of it
06:41 - twenty-one units so that's not too bad
06:44 - so that means on average you know if we
06:46 - take our estimate compare it to the
06:49 - target death rate on average we're off
06:51 - by about 21 units so in a scale that's
06:53 - in the high 100's around two hundred
06:54 - that's not too bad you know to be off by
06:56 - 21 units or you know maybe 10 10 to 20%
06:58 - some 10 15 percent probably somewhere in
07:01 - that neighborhood that that's not too
07:03 - bad at all so I'm very comfortable with
07:05 - that I think plotting it out looks good
07:06 - the numbers look good here but that's
07:09 - the training data and so we also want to
07:11 - check this on the testing data remember
07:13 - we held out 20% of our data set in order
07:16 - to test for accuracy so we want to make
07:19 - a prediction on that test data on that
07:21 - data that our model has not yet seen and
07:23 - we'll see how accurate that is because
07:25 - if we get an error of 21 on the training
07:27 - data and then our error is a hundred
07:29 - units on the test data meaning on
07:31 - average our predictions are off by a
07:32 - hundred units well that's not a very
07:34 - good model right so hopefully we get
07:37 - something that's at least relatively
07:38 - close to 20 to 21 that that would be the
07:41 - best so so we'll check our MSE on the on
07:45 - the test data and so we will create
07:48 - let's call it pred pred regression test
07:54 - and so we'll just predict on our on our
07:58 - cancer mod Reg and now we can pass it
08:03 - new data new data is test right new data
08:06 - is test and so our MSE for test let's
08:13 - call this regression our MSE test is
08:18 - going to be the square root of the mean
08:21 - of the test prediction - test and target
08:32 - death rate squared okay so what did I
08:37 - just do here let's walk through this
08:39 - calculation right so we have in our test
08:42 - data set we have the actuals one of the
08:44 - columns is the actuals we just created
08:46 - up here the prediction on that data set
08:49 - so we're taking our predicted values -
08:51 - the actuals okay to get our error and
08:54 - then
08:55 - we are squaring that error to make them
08:58 - all positive just like we did on the
09:01 - training data then we're taking the mean
09:03 - of the squared error to get MSE and then
09:06 - we're taking the the square root of that
09:07 - okay so it's the same calculation as we
09:10 - did with the piping operator we just did
09:12 - it a little bit differently here okay so
09:14 - let's go ahead and print that out rig
09:16 - our MSE test okay twenty-one point three
09:20 - seven how about that huh so test our MSC
09:25 - equals 21 point point three seven so
09:28 - that that's actually great point three
09:30 - seven two this is really great because
09:32 - what this means is that our training
09:34 - data and our test data our MSE are very
09:38 - very similar not exactly the same they
09:39 - never will be they shouldn't be but
09:41 - they're very very similar so that tells
09:43 - us that not only is our did our model do
09:46 - do relatively well on our training data
09:48 - but it did relatively well on our test
09:50 - data or it did at least the same level
09:53 - it performed at the same level on test
09:55 - data on on data had never seen before
09:58 - so we can feel pretty confident that
10:00 - we're on the right track with with this
10:03 - model now I don't think we're done but
10:05 - we are at least on on the right on the
10:08 - right track okay so that that's really
10:10 - great that's all we're gonna do with the
10:12 - multiple regression model but let's but
10:14 - before we we wrap up here let's just
10:16 - think about what are some other things
10:17 - that could be attempted in our multiple
10:21 - regression in our multiple regression
10:24 - modeling so you know we had we
10:27 - restricted this down to just three
10:29 - variables for our model so we had a
10:31 - number of other variables that were
10:33 - available to us so we could create
10:35 - additional models that incorporate some
10:37 - of the other variables some of the other
10:40 - transformed variables we could also go
10:42 - back into those variables and do some of
10:44 - the cleaning up some of the outliers or
10:47 - the abnormal values like on age and then
10:49 - recheck correlations and see if that
10:50 - tells us anything we could go with the
10:53 - data set we currently have and eliminate
10:55 - these two outlier values and see if we
10:58 - model you know if we kind of set those
11:00 - outliers aside and then model based on
11:02 - everything else see how that changes our
11:04 - model so all of those would be options
11:06 - for trying to refine the
11:09 - this model a little bit and those would
11:11 - be things that that you would want to
11:12 - try on your own as you were kind of
11:15 - working to refine a multiple regression
11:17 - model on this on this data set so have
11:21 - fun try those things out if you want
11:22 - that's gonna do it for the multiple
