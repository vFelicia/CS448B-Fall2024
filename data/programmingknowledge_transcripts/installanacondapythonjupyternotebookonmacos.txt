00:00 - hi guys welcome back to our course on um
00:02 - bye in our previous lecture we covered
00:05 - random permutations and today I am going
00:08 - to teach you how to install Anaconda get
00:12 - started with the Jupiter notebook and
00:15 - how to install c-bone and matplotlip
00:18 - libraries
00:19 - so let's get started
00:22 - so I'm sharing my screen
00:24 - I'm going to Safari
00:28 - so you can go to your browser and you
00:31 - can search Anaconda
00:35 - so it's showing the name of website as I
00:38 - had already installed
00:40 - so you can see the first search result
00:43 - as the name of the website now this is
00:46 - the website or the official website for
00:49 - installing Anaconda package
00:52 - so this is the website and you can click
00:55 - the download since I'm using a Mac so
00:59 - I'll install it for Mac
01:01 - if you are using some different
01:03 - operating system it will show you the
01:07 - package corresponding to that particular
01:11 - operating system now it's downloading
01:15 - so it's of around
01:17 - 620 MB for Mac OS users it may vary
01:23 - according to whatever operating system
01:26 - you are using
01:28 - since I have already installed I am
01:30 - canceling the download but you need to
01:33 - complete the download
01:36 - so there's one other method to download
01:40 - Anaconda if you are using a Mac West and
01:45 - you have Homebrew support
01:49 - so go to home brew and search Anaconda
01:55 - so you will get a command to install
01:58 - Anaconda so just copy it
02:01 - open your terminal
02:06 - so I'm going to open my terminal and
02:08 - just paste the command and hit enter
02:13 - so paste the command
02:16 - and hit
02:18 - enter
02:20 - now it's taking a little bit time here
02:28 - the running blue auto update
02:33 - so it has updated and it's showing
02:36 - cast Anaconda is already installed
02:39 - because I have already installed
02:41 - Anaconda
02:43 - so it's already installed
02:47 - now
02:50 - let's move on to
02:53 - installation of
03:01 - libraries that are c bond and
03:06 - matplotlib you can install these
03:09 - libraries using pip installer package or
03:13 - anaconda
03:14 - so here I'll be installing them using
03:17 - pip installer package first so I need to
03:20 - write pip install c bond to install c
03:24 - bond
03:26 - so it shows requirement already
03:28 - satisfied because it's already installed
03:30 - in my system
03:32 - now similarly for matplotlip I have to
03:36 - write pip install matplotlib
03:41 - so it will show requirement already
03:45 - satisfied again because I have already
03:48 - satisfied these libraries
03:52 - now let's see how to install them using
03:57 - Anaconda
03:59 - so if you want to use Anaconda for
04:02 - installing
04:04 - these
04:05 - libraries
04:10 - so you need to write
04:13 - the command
04:16 - conda
04:18 - install
04:25 - and
04:26 - the process will take some time
04:30 - so there is some background process
04:32 - going on
04:42 - so there will be some processing
04:44 - so it shows done
04:49 - so it's asking for a permission to
04:51 - install new packages since I have
04:54 - already installed so I won't be
04:56 - proceeding with this but since you are
04:59 - installing it for the first time you
05:01 - have to proceed with why
05:04 - so you need to proceed with y and
05:07 - similarly
05:09 - you need to install matplotlib using the
05:13 - command conda install matplotlib
05:17 - so the process is similar you just need
05:20 - to replace
05:21 - c bond with matplotlib so the command
05:25 - will be conda
05:28 - installed
05:31 - matplotlib
05:49 - let me clear the screen
05:56 - now let's
05:59 - open
06:01 - the Anaconda Navigator
06:07 - so open the Anaconda Navigator
06:14 - and close the terminal
06:19 - so I've opened the Anaconda Navigator
06:22 - and it's showing a lot of options but we
06:25 - have to select the notebook and click
06:27 - launch
06:29 - so it will take a minute
06:31 - or 30 seconds
06:33 - and it will open in your browser
06:38 - don't worry this process is offline it
06:41 - doesn't require internet connection
06:46 - so just create a new folder
06:48 - wherever you want to store your code
06:52 - so I've created a new Untitled folder
06:56 - for that
06:58 - so I'll just open this folder by
07:00 - clicking on it
07:03 - so it shows the notebook list is empty
07:05 - and I'm going to create a new notebook
07:07 - now
07:09 - now this is a cell
07:12 - so in this cell I am going to import
07:15 - numpy as NP
07:19 - I'm also going to import
07:22 - c bond as
07:26 - SNS
07:27 - and import
07:29 - matplotlib dot Pi plot
07:35 - as PLT and I am going to
07:39 - hit shift and enter to run this cell so
07:43 - it gave me no error
07:46 - so we have successfully imported these
07:48 - libraries you can also rename the
07:50 - notebook by clicking on the name that is
07:53 - Untitled so I'm changing it to my first
07:55 - notebook
08:01 - so now there is an assignment for you
08:12 - so assignment is that
08:15 - you need to practice some of the
08:18 - problems that we already discussed in
08:21 - the previous lectures
08:24 - in jupyter Notebook because if you
08:26 - practice more you will get acquainted
08:29 - with this
08:30 - quickly so practice some of the codes we
08:33 - have discussed in previous lectures
08:38 - in Jupiter notebook
08:51 - so in today's lecture I demonstrated how
08:55 - to install Anaconda
08:57 - and also how to install
09:01 - c bond and matplotlip libraries using
09:04 - pip installer package as well as
09:07 - Anaconda we also created our first
09:10 - Jupiter notebook that will be all for
09:14 - today this video is brought to you by
09:16 - programming knowledge please like
09:18 - comment share subscribe and hit the Bell
09:20 - button for updates and stay tuned with
09:23 - us for next lecture thanks
