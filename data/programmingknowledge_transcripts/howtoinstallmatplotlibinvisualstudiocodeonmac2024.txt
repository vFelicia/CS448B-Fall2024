00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:01 - you how you can install matte plot lip
00:04 - package in your Visual Studio code
00:07 - Editor to run a matp lib related script
00:11 - on your Visual Studio code on your Mac
00:14 - operating system so let's get started
00:16 - and let's see how we can do it so as you
00:18 - can see I have this uh Visual Studio
00:21 - code editor opened and I have opened
00:24 - this sample folder in Visual Studio code
00:28 - it doesn't contain any python script yet
00:30 - so let's create a python script I'm
00:32 - going to click on this new file button
00:34 - and then I'm going to name my script as
00:38 - test.py and in this test.py I'm going to
00:41 - uh just paste a very simple Matt plot
00:44 - lib script and uh you can see it shows
00:48 - me this error which says import Mt plot
00:52 - lip P plot could not be resolved and
00:55 - this error is shown because we haven't
00:57 - installed the matad plot lip package yet
01:01 - so to install the M plot lip package
01:03 - just click on Terminal and then click on
01:05 - new terminal and then before installing
01:08 - Matt plot lib package we are going to
01:10 - create a virtual n so that when we
01:13 - install the Mt plot lib package it's
01:16 - only installed inside our project and
01:19 - not globally on my Mac operating system
01:22 - to create a virtual n type this command
01:25 - which is Python and then press Tab Key
01:28 - on your keyboard okay okay so press Tab
01:31 - Key on your keyboard and you will be
01:33 - able to see all the python related
01:36 - commands which you can run on your
01:38 - terminal in my case I can use Python 3
01:42 - command as you can see but I also have
01:44 - python 3.12 installed so I can use that
01:47 - also so you can uh choose one of these
01:52 - command I'm going to choose Python 3 and
01:54 - then write hyphen M and then write VNV
01:59 - and then the the name of your
02:00 - environment I'm going to name my
02:01 - environment as en andv this can be
02:05 - anything you can name it as uh some
02:08 - folder of some environment I'm going to
02:10 - name it as n press enter and it's going
02:14 - to create this virtual
02:15 - environment when the virtual environment
02:17 - is created it's going to create this
02:19 - directory with the name of your
02:21 - environment and it contains few uh
02:23 - directories to activate this environment
02:26 - we need to call this activate script
02:29 - which is under n to activate our virtual
02:31 - n we use this command which is Source
02:36 - space the name of your EnV folder it's n
02:40 - in my case and then
02:43 - bin and then for slash activate and then
02:47 - press enter and it's going to activate
02:49 - your virtual en to know if the N virtual
02:52 - en is activated you will see that your n
02:57 - name is printed in front of your command
03:00 - online once virtual and is uh created we
03:04 - are ready to install the Matt plot lib
03:08 - package so to install Matt plot lip just
03:11 - type pip and then once again type the
03:14 - tab command and you will see different
03:17 - uh pip commands you can use to install
03:21 - the thirdparty PIP packages I have pip
03:24 - pip 3 and pip
03:26 - 3.12 I am going to use pip 3 because I
03:29 - have used Python 3 at the top to create
03:32 - the virtual environment and then type
03:35 - install and then type Matt plot lib so
03:39 - you just need to type the name of the
03:42 - library which you want to install Matt
03:44 - plot lib in my case I'm not writing
03:47 - numpy my script is using numpy package
03:50 - but when I install the Mt plot lib it
03:54 - comes with the numpy package also so
03:56 - numpy package will also be installed
03:58 - additionally when I uh installed the mat
04:01 - plot lip so pip install mat plot lip
04:04 - press enter which is going to install
04:07 - this uh library and just wait for a few
04:10 - seconds and once the M plot lib is
04:13 - installed you can see the squiggly line
04:16 - is gone from the Met plot lib and numai
04:20 - because it has been installed if you go
04:24 - uh little bit up you will see that uh it
04:26 - installs several different pip packet
04:29 - PES for the matplot lib once the Matt
04:34 - plot lib library is installed I'm going
04:36 - to clear the terminal and then I can run
04:41 - the Python 3 command so I'm going to
04:43 - just type Python 3 and the name of the
04:46 - script is test.py you can see and then
04:50 - I'm going to press enter and it's going
04:52 - to run my matplot lib uh script and you
04:56 - can see it's running and you can see the
04:59 - graph is shown here and that's how I
05:03 - know that my uh program is working fine
05:09 - so this is how you can install Mt plot
05:11 - lib on your Visual Studio code editor on
05:15 - your Mac operating system I hope you
05:17 - enjoyed this video and I will see you in
05:19 - the next video
