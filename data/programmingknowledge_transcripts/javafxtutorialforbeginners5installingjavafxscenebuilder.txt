00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Java FX tutorial for beginners in this
00:04 - video we will see how we can download
00:07 - and install scene Builder on our Windows
00:10 - operating system and integrate it with
00:13 - our Eclipse IDE Java FX scene Builder is
00:17 - a visual layout tool that lets user
00:21 - quickly designed Java F application user
00:24 - interface so let's see how we can
00:26 - install scene Builder on our Windows
00:28 - operating system first
00:30 - so open your favorite browser and search
00:33 - for scene
00:35 - Builder now Oracle somehow decided to no
00:40 - longer provide the build for Java F
00:44 - scene Builder tool in other words Oracle
00:47 - will no longer provide a build for the
00:50 - scene Builder and there is a company
00:52 - called gluon which decided to make the
00:56 - binary and maintain the build for the
01:00 - scene Builder okay so we are going to go
01:03 - to uh this uh website which is gluon HQ
01:07 - which maintains uh the scene Builder
01:10 - build tool okay so just in your search
01:15 - result search for the website called
01:19 - gluon hq.com okay and click this link I
01:23 - will provide the link in the description
01:25 - so that you can directly click on this
01:28 - uh link and come here on this website
01:31 - and in here you can see there are builds
01:36 - for every operating system for example
01:39 - Mac OS or Linux or Windows okay so here
01:44 - we can download this binary file so what
01:47 - I'm going to do is I'm going to just
01:50 - install the
01:51 - 64bit uh executable file which is this
01:55 - option so just click download and it's
01:58 - going to download
02:00 - the scene Builder on our operating
02:03 - system now once this uh executable is
02:06 - installed you just need to click this
02:09 - executable file and now you just need to
02:12 - click
02:16 - install and it's not a big installation
02:19 - it will be installed immediately and
02:22 - after the installation you will be able
02:24 - to see the scene Builder directly
02:26 - launched so this is how your scene
02:29 - Builder looks like but still it's not
02:32 - properly installed so what you need to
02:34 - do is you need to close scene Builder
02:36 - and there is a particular location where
02:38 - scene Builder will be installed so open
02:41 - your folder Explorer and in here go to
02:46 - your C folder and in the C folder go to
02:50 - users directory and in the users
02:53 - directory go to your computer name
02:57 - folder for me it's programming knowledge
02:59 - it's it can be your name or something
03:01 - here and in here go to the folder called
03:05 - app data and in the app data go to the
03:08 - folder called local and in here you will
03:11 - be able to see the scene Builder here
03:15 - and inside this you will be able to see
03:16 - scene Builder executable file right so
03:20 - what you need to do is you just need to
03:23 - uh cut this folder from here which is
03:26 - scene Builder and then go to your C
03:30 - folder and paste it here itself okay so
03:33 - we know that scene Builder is here right
03:36 - so now the location for the scene
03:38 - Builder is in your C
03:43 - folder so I will paste the link uh of uh
03:47 - this location where scene Builder was
03:49 - initially installed so that you won't be
03:53 - confused now once this is done just open
03:57 - your Eclipse IDE and open your project
04:02 - on which you were working for example
04:05 - I'm working on this project and I will
04:08 - create a new fxml file here so right
04:12 - click on your Source folder and go to
04:16 - new and in here go to
04:19 - others and in other go to Java fs and in
04:23 - the Java FX you will be able to see this
04:26 - new fxml document right so so you can
04:30 - just click next and give the name to
04:32 - your fxml file so for example I will
04:35 - give it a name Main and I will click
04:39 - finish okay and this is how your main.
04:44 - fxml file looks like okay now to
04:49 - configure this scene Builder with your
04:52 - Eclipse IDE what you need to do is go to
04:55 - the windows tab here and then go to
05:00 - preferences and in the preferences
05:03 - search for Java FX here and select Java
05:07 - FX and then you will be able to see the
05:10 - scene Builder
05:12 - executable so you need to browse for the
05:15 - scene Builder executable so it will be
05:17 - in your C folder because we have pasted
05:20 - this folder in our C folder and select
05:24 - this scene builder. exe from here and
05:27 - click okay right and then then click
05:30 - apply and click
05:32 - okay now you can right click on your
05:36 - main. fxml file and then open with scene
05:41 - Builder so you can select this option
05:43 - which says open with scene Builder and
05:46 - now this file will be opened inside your
05:50 - scene Builder right so initially you
05:54 - will see Anor pan on the left hand side
05:57 - here in the hierarchy
06:00 - and this is our root and inside this
06:04 - enor pan we can drag and drop our
06:06 - controls or container or other widgets
06:10 - okay so for just testing for example we
06:13 - want to uh add a button here so we can
06:16 - add this button by dragging and dropping
06:19 - into this area here right so drag and
06:24 - drop this button here and after you drag
06:26 - and drop this button what you will see
06:29 - here is there is nothing visible but you
06:33 - will be able to see when you select this
06:36 - area there is a small Point here so you
06:40 - need to select this point and make it
06:43 - bigger okay and then what I'm going to
06:46 - do is I'm going to just select this
06:48 - button and I can see this button is
06:51 - placed here so I can drag and drop into
06:54 - my Anor pin like this okay so now we
06:58 - have this enor pain and button here now
07:02 - to add this to the Eclipse IDE and uh
07:06 - run it what we can do is first of all we
07:09 - need to save it so go to file and then
07:12 - just click save here okay and it's going
07:15 - to save and now go to Eclipse IDE and
07:19 - you can see this uh main. fxml file is
07:23 - edited and I can see this button here
07:27 - right now go to your uh Java file which
07:32 - you have created so this is the Java
07:35 - file which we have created in the last
07:38 - video and this was the code we have
07:40 - written so what I'm going to do is I'm
07:43 - going to remove all this code from here
07:46 - and I will remove this root. children
07:50 - from here also and I'm going to remove
07:52 - this vbox root also right and even I'm
07:57 - going to remove these sizes with which I
07:59 - have given Here and Now what I'm going
08:02 - to do here is I'm going to write this
08:05 - code which is parent which is a class
08:09 - and give the object name root for
08:12 - example which is passed here in the
08:15 - scene and then is equal to fxml loader.
08:20 - load and inside the bracket write the
08:22 - code get class. getet resource and
08:25 - inside these double codes we can give
08:28 - the location for our fxml file okay so
08:33 - our fxml file name is main. fxml so just
08:38 - write that
08:40 - main.
08:42 - fxml and then you will see here uh it
08:45 - will show some error because we need to
08:48 - import this uh parent class and we need
08:51 - to import this fxml loader class right
08:56 - so import both these and the error will
08:58 - go and then save your code and run it
09:01 - once
09:02 - again and now you will be able to see
09:05 - this button in your stage inside the
09:09 - scene right so for example I will close
09:12 - this and once again I will go to my
09:15 - scene Builder and I will uh drag and
09:17 - drop one more button here and for
09:20 - example one more button here and once
09:23 - again I will save my fxml file save it
09:28 - and uh once again save your uh file here
09:33 - main. fxml you can see three buttons
09:36 - added to our main. fxml so I will run it
09:41 - once
09:42 - again and now I can see three buttons
09:45 - here right so in this way you can
09:48 - download and install scene Builder on
09:51 - our Windows operating system and
09:53 - integrate it with Eclipse IDE I hope you
