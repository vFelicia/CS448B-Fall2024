00:00 - uh so in this video we shall start with
00:03 - storing our products okay so for that
00:06 - first i'll open my database
00:08 - so in this we are gonna create a new
00:10 - table and that is
00:12 - gonna be uh products
00:15 - i'm sorry we are gonna create a new
00:18 - table and its name is gonna be
00:20 - products okay uh so first
00:23 - is gonna be id that is gonna be primary
00:28 - okay and it should be auto incrementing
00:30 - it is of integer data type
00:32 - okay then after that we have seller id
00:36 - okay so this is a foreign key uh
00:39 - in the comments i'll write foreign key
00:43 - linking to seller table
00:47 - okay so you should know the basic
00:50 - terminology of
00:51 - dbms if you don't you can simply do a
00:54 - google search and get to know all about
00:56 - it
00:56 - okay then the name of the product uh
01:00 - image of the product okay then after
01:02 - that i think we need
01:04 - more four columns so i'll add those
01:07 - okay then after image we have price per
01:11 - kg okay so the
01:14 - price then we have description okay not
01:17 - a space
01:23 - okay that's encryption and then we have
01:27 - interaction
01:30 - count okay so this this parameter will
01:34 - uh help us generate the trending thing
01:38 - or what we have called areas
01:39 - so this will help in the most popular
01:42 - in getting us the most popular list okay
01:45 - so by this what i mean is
01:47 - that every time uh the product is added
01:51 - in the cart or ordered we will increment
01:53 - its value by 1
01:54 - and thus by getting the
01:57 - getting to and thus with the highest
02:00 - number of interaction count will be the
02:02 - most popular and then
02:04 - others arranged in descending order okay
02:06 - so this is
02:07 - it and after that we don't need a time
02:09 - okay so now this name is gonna be
02:11 - varka of let's say hundred characters
02:15 - at max image is again gonna be worker of
02:18 - hundred characters at max
02:20 - price per kg uh is also gonna be vaca
02:24 - uh hundred characters max and
02:27 - description is gonna be where care
02:29 - let's say thousand characters at max
02:31 - because descriptions are large
02:34 - now interaction count is going to be
02:35 - integer only okay so i think
02:38 - this is done our table is created okay
02:43 - so we can see the structure we have id
02:46 - seller id name image
02:48 - price per kg description and interaction
02:51 - count
02:52 - okay so i forgot one thing in starting
02:55 - it should be zero
02:56 - okay so
03:00 - uh we will go to default as defined
03:03 - zero so that this means that if we don't
03:05 - give any value to this
03:06 - uh by default it will be assigned a
03:09 - value of
03:10 - zero so let's save this okay and with
03:12 - this our products table is ready
03:14 - okay so now let's create uh create a
03:17 - model class
03:18 - in our php so for that i'll open up
03:22 - up the vs code
03:27 - okay inside the models folder i'll
03:29 - create a new file that is
03:34 - products dot php
03:38 - okay and then this will also have these
03:42 - things at the start okay
03:45 - uh we can remove the decrypt because we
03:48 - are not gonna store any passwords here
03:50 - okay then let's create a class and the
03:53 - class is class
03:58 - product
04:00 - we need to give a capital p because
04:02 - class name starts with the
04:03 - capital okay then after that we will
04:06 - define the
04:08 - uh key key values i mean the
04:11 - names of the data members okay so
04:18 - first we have a private variable that is
04:20 - our table name
04:22 - private dollar table and that is
04:26 - gonna be products then we have
04:30 - id we have
04:34 - seller id
04:38 - we have the name
04:44 - we have image
04:49 - we have price per kg
04:55 - we have description
05:01 - and last we have interaction count okay
05:04 - so
05:06 - interaction count
05:10 - after this we have a constructor and
05:13 - validate params function this is same in
05:16 - bo
05:16 - in all the model classes so i'll simply
05:19 - copy it
05:20 - and paste it over here then the next
05:22 - thing is
05:24 - storing a product okay so we'll create a
05:27 - method for that first let me format it
05:47 - okay so i don't know why this is
05:50 - happening
05:51 - means like the format thing is not
05:53 - working
05:54 - okay anyway it has formatted now now
05:56 - let's create the
05:57 - function to store the details of the
06:00 - product so i'll call a public function
06:06 - add product okay then as always
06:09 - this is gonna have a global instance of
06:12 - our database
06:17 - okay and then we will take all these
06:19 - properties except id
06:21 - and then prepare them to be added in the
06:24 - query so that is
06:25 - done by adding these three things that
06:27 - is trim html
06:29 - special cares and strip tags we have
06:32 - discussed about all
06:34 - all of them in one of the video okay so
06:36 - the first is
06:38 - seller id so this is gonna be seller id
06:44 - then after that we have another five so
06:46 - i'll copy it
06:48 - and paste it five times
06:51 - and then simply change the name
07:13 - so this is the description and then this
07:16 - is interaction count
07:19 - okay so this was the reason why the uh
07:22 - formatting was not working i forgot to
07:24 - give a dollar sign over here
07:26 - okay so now once this is done let's
07:28 - store it in our database so for that we
07:30 - again write an sql command sql
07:34 - do not select but insert
07:39 - into dollar this
07:44 - and then we write the key names that is
07:46 - a seller
07:48 - id name
07:51 - image price
07:54 - per kg okay then
07:58 - description then
08:01 - enter okay we don't need to add the
08:03 - interaction count because it will be
08:05 - zero by default okay description now we
08:08 - need to
08:09 - check for spellings because if the
08:11 - spelling doesn't match it will crash
08:14 - so it does match okay values
08:18 - then over here i'll break the string
08:21 - i have already discussed these
08:24 - purpose of these six characters in one
08:27 - of the video you can look into it
08:29 - okay then after that over here we write
08:33 - this thing okay we call the method
08:36 - escape value which is in our database
08:39 - class
08:40 - okay database escape value this name
08:43 - okay so first it is gonna be seller id
08:48 - i'm sorry seller id then there will be a
08:50 - comma now after this another four
08:53 - and the last one will not have a comma
08:56 - then the
08:57 - name
09:01 - image price per kg
09:05 - and the description okay so once
09:09 - this is done let's save our database so
09:12 - uh save this row in our table i'm sorry
09:16 - we can't save the database
09:18 - so database
09:21 - query and sql so now if
09:25 - we check if result means if it
09:30 - has a something that means the it has
09:33 - been executed successfully then we
09:34 - return
09:38 - true else we return
09:42 - false so if everything is correct it
09:44 - should format itself automatically and
09:47 - it did
09:48 - now let's save this okay so with this
09:51 - our function is created
09:53 - we shall create the end point in the
09:55 - next video thank you
