00:00 - hello friends welcome to programming
00:02 - knowledge in our previous video we saw
00:05 - that how to apply specific indention on
00:08 - a selected set of data using via keyword
00:11 - and if you notice one thing the example
00:15 - that we have taken we were only able to
00:18 - specify one condition on a single set of
00:21 - data but if we talk about real world it
00:25 - is not this scenario we have to apply
00:27 - multiple condition on a single set of
00:29 - data so how do we do that so for that we
00:34 - have basically two key words
00:36 - the first is end operator and the second
00:39 - is or operator in this video we talk
00:42 - about end and in the next video we will
00:48 - see how to use or so first let us see
00:52 - how to use end keyword in the terminal
00:55 - so open your terminal or command prompt
01:15 - okay my server is start MySQL server
01:27 - okay here we go again
01:45 - okay so databases here we have data test
01:56 - database let us see which are the tables
02:12 - here as you can see we have created a
02:15 - student table so let's select star from
02:23 - okay so we have this many of records and
02:28 - now I want to select the data who has a
02:37 - role number greater than 12 okay so we
02:42 - write select star from student where
02:55 - roll number greater than well okay here
03:03 - you can see now in our case we don't
03:08 - only want that the roll number is fitted
03:11 - and fell we also apply one more
03:13 - condition that the roll number should be
03:16 - greater than 12 but less than 16 so
03:21 - understand this is not one condition
03:24 - this is basically a two condition that
03:27 - we want to apply on this set of data the
03:30 - first one is the roll number should be
03:33 - greater than 12 and the second one is
03:35 - the roll number should be less than 16
03:38 - okay so we write select star from
03:45 - student where
03:53 - roll is crated and fur and roll number
04:04 - is less than 16 here you can see the
04:13 - three rows which are all number of 16 17
04:16 - and 18 is disappeared now because we
04:21 - applied to condition the first one is
04:23 - greater than 12 and the second one is
04:26 - less than 16 now whenever we can specify
04:31 - as many as condition as we want and
04:35 - remember one thing the result of this
04:40 - entire condition becomes true only when
04:44 - all the conditions that we have
04:46 - specified are true if even if any one of
04:50 - them is you know false condition then
04:56 - the entire condition will become false
04:59 - so we can take one more example like
05:05 - select star from student
05:30 - here you can see um now we want this
05:36 - record these prison and this one also
05:39 - okay so first one has the roll number of
05:45 - ten and the second one has the roll
05:46 - number of 12 so we specify where Rollem
05:51 - a greater than or equal to ten
05:54 - so take these it will capture both of
05:58 - this record ten and twelve because both
06:04 - I have roll am a greater than ten or
06:07 - equal to greater than or equal to ten
06:09 - now speech specifies the second
06:12 - condition in which we want the surname
06:16 - is equal to Makwana surname is equal to
06:29 - okay so now what will happen this
06:35 - condition is true for both of the region
06:38 - but the second condition which is for
06:40 - the son and that we have specified will
06:43 - be false for this particular record
06:46 - because this particular record doesn't
06:50 - match this an end that we have specified
06:52 - so it will so was only one record the
06:57 - first one okay let us see as you can see
07:04 - now let
07:06 - specify the condition for all the
07:09 - columns select star from children we
07:19 - have roll number let's say greater than
07:23 - 14 and name is equal to let's say LX and
07:42 - surname is equal to through so okay
07:59 - so as you can see I display only
08:03 - WonderCon which is this one because this
08:08 - is the only record that match all all of
08:12 - the three conditions that we have
08:14 - specified Li okay
08:16 - so let us close this and open MySQL
08:22 - workbench okay
08:34 - so here we have roll number am I
08:42 - supposed to use that is no select we
08:58 - want to select specific column here so
09:00 - as we we saw in our previous videos we
09:05 - can write the name of the column roll
09:10 - number let's say surname from student
09:20 - where roll number is greater than 50
09:36 - okay so this
09:39 - the one condition now applies second
09:41 - candle reason wire and keyword and rule
09:50 - number is less than or equal to 17 now
09:59 - what will happen this record is match
10:05 - with our both the condition 16 lies
10:08 - between 15 and 17 17 also equal to 17
10:13 - and 18 does not match the second
10:17 - condition it matches the first condition
10:20 - it is greater than 15 but it is not less
10:23 - than or equal to 17 then the last record
10:27 - 18 and Khepri will be disappeared and we
10:30 - will see only these two of record okay
10:35 - as you can see 16 and 17 now list
10:44 - something else select roll number now we
10:50 - will select only total number okay
10:52 - select roll emerge from student where
10:57 - name is equal to let's abridging and
11:04 - surname is equal to Mikado okay so if
11:14 - you remember there is only one record of
11:17 - this condition so it will display the
11:22 - roll number of that record as you can
11:26 - see so this is all about nt1 you can
11:33 - specify as many as condition you want
11:35 - with the help of an keyword and it will
11:38 - display the record if all of the
11:41 - condition that you have specified are
11:43 - true so thanks for watching in our next
11:47 - video we will see how to use or cable
11:58 - you
