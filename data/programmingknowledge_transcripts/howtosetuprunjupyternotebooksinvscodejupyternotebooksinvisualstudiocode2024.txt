00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:01 - you how you can set up the Jupiter
00:04 - notebook with your Visual Studio code on
00:08 - your Mac operating system so let's get
00:11 - started and let's see how we can do it
00:13 - so first of all you need to install
00:15 - anaconda on your Mac operating system so
00:19 - let's see how we can install Anaconda so
00:22 - first of all open your favorite browser

01:30 - file so it'll take some time to download
01:32 - so just wait for the download to
01:34 - complete so once this uh Anaconda do PKG
01:38 - file is downloaded I'm going to click on
01:40 - this PKG file and let me minimize the

02:30 - and then if you agree with the license
02:32 - terms and conditions click on agree
02:35 - which is going to show you the
02:37 - installation type now here it says this
02:40 - will take around 4.81 GB of space on my
02:43 - computer I'm okay with this so I'm going
02:46 - to click on install button which is
02:48 - going to start the installation of
02:50 - anaconda now at this point I just need
02:52 - to wait for some time until uh this uh
02:55 - installation is finished and now I can
02:58 - see after a few seconds
03:00 - the installation was successful and you
03:03 - can see the Anaconda launcher is being
03:06 - launched and then you will see uh these
03:09 - kind of Windows now when uh Anaconda
03:12 - starts for the first time it's going to
03:15 - show you this kind of anaconda Navigator
03:18 - and if uh this Anaconda recognizes that
03:23 - you have some older version of Anaconda
03:25 - it's going to uh encourage you to update
03:29 - your aond so here you can see do you
03:31 - wish to update to the newest version for
03:34 - now I don't want to do it but you can
03:36 - press on yes and then install the latest
03:39 - version of Anaconda I'm going to click
03:41 - on remind me later so I can do it later
03:44 - also so this is how uh this Anaconda
03:47 - Navigator looks like and at this point I
03:51 - can also click on continue here and it
03:54 - says code with the anaconda in Cloud I
03:58 - will click on continue and and then I'm
04:00 - going to click on close which is going
04:02 - to uh finish the installation of
04:04 - anaconda so we don't need this PKG uh
04:07 - installer anymore so we can click on
04:09 - move to bin which is going to move the
04:11 - installer to the bin now once you have
04:14 - Anaconda installed you need to open the
04:16 - terminal and then run this command to
04:21 - activate the required kernel for the
04:25 - jupyter notebook and the command is cond
04:28 - install ipy kernel and then press
04:34 - enter which is going to start the
04:37 - installation of this package and in the
04:39 - process of installation it's going to
04:41 - ask you to proceed and just press y here
04:46 - and then press enter which is going to
04:48 - finish the installation of this ipy
04:51 - kernel once this ipy kernal package is
04:54 - installed via cond we are ready to get
04:57 - started with Jupiter node notebook with
05:00 - our Visual Studio code editor so let me
05:04 - close this terminal and open the vs code
05:07 - and once the vs code opens you need to
05:09 - go to the extensions section here and
05:12 - then search for Python and if you
05:14 - haven't already installed this python
05:17 - extension just install this so this is
05:20 - the first result which will appear when
05:22 - you search for python here and you can
05:25 - see it has been downloaded around 107
05:28 - million times so it's a official
05:31 - extension from Microsoft for python on
05:34 - Visual Studio code so I'm going to click
05:36 - on install here which is going to
05:38 - install this extension once this
05:40 - extension is installed you can see uh
05:43 - this disable button and uninstalled
05:45 - button here this extension also includes
05:49 - the support for Jupiter notebook and
05:52 - that's why we have installed this
05:55 - extension so once this python extension
05:58 - is installed we need to install one more
06:00 - extension for Jupiter notebook and that
06:03 - is called Jupiter okay so search for
06:07 - Jupiter here and then click on Jupiter
06:10 - and this extension is also from
06:13 - Microsoft I'm going to click on install
06:16 - here and it's going to also install the
06:18 - Jupiter notebook and once the
06:21 - installation is finished you will be
06:23 - able to see the disable or uninstall
06:25 - button here so install python extension
06:29 - and the Jupiter extension once these two
06:32 - extensions are installed we are going to
06:34 - go to the Explorer and then let's open a
06:37 - new folder here so let me open my
06:40 - documents folder and and here I have
06:42 - this notebooks folder in which I'm going
06:44 - to create my Jupiter notebooks so I'm
06:46 - going to click on ADD which is going to
06:48 - add this folder in my visual studio code
06:51 - so let me close this window so now
06:53 - inside this folder we are going to
06:54 - create a new Jupiter notebook file so
06:57 - I'm going to name my file as test
07:00 - do
07:02 - ipynb which is the extension for jupyter
07:04 - Notebook and then press enter and visual
07:08 - studio code is going to recognize that
07:10 - we are trying to create the Jupiter
07:12 - notebook so it's going to create this
07:15 - kind of interface which is similar to
07:19 - Jupiter Notebook on the browser also
07:22 - it's going to show you this kind of
07:25 - notification which says we noticed you
07:28 - are using using cond environment if you
07:30 - are experiencing issue with the
07:32 - environment in the integrated terminal
07:35 - we recommend that python extension
07:38 - should be installed this one right so so
07:42 - for now I'm going to just collapse this
07:45 - notification and here in this test.
07:50 - iynb uh file you can see I can add a
07:54 - markdown or the code cell using these
07:57 - options but first of all I need to
07:59 - select the kernel so just click on this
08:02 - select kernel option and then you will
08:05 - be able to see the
08:07 - existing uh Jupiter server here or you
08:11 - will also see the python environments
08:14 - here okay so I'm going to click on
08:16 - python environments and then I'm going
08:18 - to select the
08:20 - Anaconda environment whatever option
08:23 - says Anaconda just select that option
08:26 - and then you can see the base uh Python
08:28 - 3 . 11.5 is selected here okay so once
08:33 - that's selected Let's uh first start
08:36 - with the markdown so I'm going to change
08:38 - this uh cell type to markdown and then
08:40 - I'm going to add some headings so for
08:43 - example my first notebook here and then
08:47 - I'm going to click on this run button
08:49 - which is going to execute this cell and
08:52 - you can see the output here now in order
08:55 - to add the new cell you can click on
08:57 - this uh Plus Code so it's going to add
08:59 - the code cell if you want to add a
09:02 - markdown it's going to add a markdown
09:04 - cell so let me click on plus button here
09:07 - and then let's uh just uh evaluate some
09:11 - python code so for example 5 + 5 now in
09:15 - this case I'm going to press uh this
09:16 - option which says execute cell and below
09:20 - and it's going to just print me the
09:22 - output which is 10 which is correct
09:25 - right so in this way you can keep on
09:28 - adding the
09:29 - code cell or markdown cell or any other
09:32 - cell so let me once again add the code
09:34 - cell here and you can even change the
09:37 - type of cell so you can add the python
09:40 - markdown batch HTML so all these options
09:43 - are available for the cell here right
09:46 - let me print something for example so
09:48 - I'm going to just uh type print and then
09:51 - I'm going to just print hello world and
09:54 - this time I'm going to click on this
09:56 - button which says run by
09:58 - line and it's going to open this kind of
10:01 - debug console here right so if you want
10:05 - to uh open the debug console then it's
10:08 - going to open this kind of debug console
10:11 - here and then I can move or continue the
10:14 - execution from here okay you can also
10:17 - open the terminal or the Jupiter option
10:21 - here and you will be able to see the
10:23 - variable values if you have declared
10:25 - some variables and then and move forward
10:28 - to the next line for example if the
10:30 - variable have some value you will be
10:32 - able to see the values there also you
10:35 - can just come out of this uh debug by
10:38 - just pressing on this stop cell
10:40 - execution button and then it says
10:42 - keyboard Interruption so we have uh just
10:45 - stopped this so it's showing us the
10:48 - keyboard Interruption option I can also
10:50 - delete the cell by clicking on this
10:52 - delete cell button which is going to
10:54 - delete the cell right so this is how you
10:56 - can add the support for Jupiter notebook
11:00 - in your Visual Studio code editor I hope
11:03 - You' enjoyed this video and I will see
11:04 - you in the next
11:06 - video
