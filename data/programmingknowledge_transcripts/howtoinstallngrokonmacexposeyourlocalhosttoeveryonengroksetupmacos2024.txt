00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:01 - you how you can install and use NG gr or
00:05 - NG rock on your Mac operating system so
00:09 - NG rock is a tool that allows you to
00:13 - expose a local server to internet
00:16 - securely so it's commonly used by
00:18 - developers to test and demo web
00:21 - applications that are running on their
00:23 - local machines to their peers or to
00:27 - their customers so for example I have
00:30 - this uh local server which is running on
00:33 - my Local Host Port 3000 and I want to
00:37 - show this demo to my pier and this
00:40 - server is running locally on my Mac
00:43 - operating system and my colleague sits
00:45 - in some other City and I want to show
00:48 - him this demo I can use enro to expose
00:52 - my server and he will be able to see it
00:57 - using enro so let's see how we can
00:59 - install and Ro so first of all open your
01:01 - favorite browser and search for enro and
01:04 - the first link which will appear here
01:05 - will be from enr.com so here first of
01:10 - all you need to have an account in this
01:13 - enro site to use anro because you need
01:17 - to give the authentication token to use
01:20 - the enro so if you don't have any
01:23 - account you can click on sign up here
01:26 - and the sign up is really simple it will
01:28 - ask you the name email and password and
01:32 - you can just sign up very easily if you
01:35 - already have the account you can click
01:37 - on the login button and here you can
01:40 - login to your enr account so I already
01:44 - have an enr account so I'm going to log
01:46 - to my enr account first and once I'm
01:49 - logged into my enr account it's going to
01:52 - look something like this so so here on
01:54 - the left hand side I have the setup and
01:56 - installation section I can also see how
01:59 - I can uh use enro on my Mac operating
02:03 - system you can also see uh some other
02:06 - options related to enro so you can
02:08 - monitor your uh connections using this
02:12 - panel itself so here on this uh first
02:17 - page which is under setup and
02:19 - installation enr website is
02:21 - automatically going to recognize that
02:23 - you are on the Mac operating system so
02:26 - you can see this Mac OS agent
02:30 - and then when you scroll down a little
02:33 - this documentation is going to show you
02:35 - how you can download and install enro on
02:38 - your Mac operating system so the
02:40 - simplest way using which you can install
02:43 - enro is by using Brew brew if you don't
02:46 - know is a package manager using which
02:49 - you can install many applications on
02:52 - your Mac operating system if you don't
02:55 - want to use Brew then the other option
02:58 - is to just download
03:00 - the binary file by yourself for Apple
03:04 - silicon chip or Intel chip and you can
03:08 - unzip that file and then you can use
03:11 - that file that way also I already have
03:14 - Brew installed on my Mac operating
03:16 - system so I'm going to use this command
03:19 - if you don't know how to install Brew on
03:21 - your Mac operating system I'm going to
03:23 - put the link of the video in which I
03:25 - have shown how to install Brew on the
03:28 - Mac operating system so just watch that
03:31 - video and then Brew will be installed on
03:34 - your Mac operating system and then you
03:36 - can use this uh Brew install command so
03:38 - let me copy this uh command here and
03:42 - then I'm going to click on this
03:43 - Spotlight search option and then search
03:45 - for terminal and then open the
03:47 - terminal and then I'm going to paste
03:50 - this command into my terminal the
03:53 - command is bre install enro slen gr/ enr
03:57 - and then and then press enter here which
03:59 - is going to start the installation of
04:01 - enro tool so once this uh install enro
04:04 - tool command finishes I can clear the
04:09 - terminal and then I can use the enro
04:12 - command so as I said you can use engr to
04:16 - expose your local server to the outside
04:20 - world but first of all you need to
04:22 - provide the authentication token to use
04:25 - Andro so when you go to the
04:27 - documentation so we have a already given
04:30 - this command to install enrock on our
04:33 - Mac operating system the second step is
04:36 - to run this command which is to add the
04:40 - authentication token of enro into your
04:43 - configuration file so I'm going to just
04:44 - copy this command once again go to the
04:47 - terminal and then paste this command
04:50 - here and then press enter and you can
04:53 - see out token saved to the configuration
04:57 - files once this out token is saved once
05:01 - again we can go to the
05:03 - documentation and now you can test your
05:07 - apps using the enro command so for
05:12 - example if your app is running on port
05:15 - 8080 you can use this kind of uh command
05:20 - to test your local server so as I
05:22 - mentioned my app is running on Local
05:24 - Host Port 3000 and this I want to expose
05:28 - to the outside side world right so what
05:32 - I will do is I will just uh open the
05:36 - terminal again and in the terminal so to
05:40 - expose my Local Host Port 3000 I can use
05:45 - this command which is NG Rock and then
05:49 - HTTP so you need to write the nro
05:52 - command and then the protocol you can
05:53 - also expose some other protocols using
05:56 - NG Rock for now we want to use the HTTP
06:00 - protocol and then simply write the port
06:03 - which you want to uh expose so right now
06:07 - my test server is running on local host
06:09 - post 3000 so here either I can write
06:13 - HTTP colon for
06:16 - sl/ Local
06:19 - Host colon
06:22 - 3000 and then press enter and it's going
06:26 - to expose my Local Host to the outside
06:28 - world
06:30 - now once I do that I will see uh this
06:33 - kind of uh URL which is the enro URL so
06:37 - let me maximize this and you can see my
06:41 - Local Host Port 3000 is forwarding data
06:44 - on this URL so I can copy this URL from
06:47 - here so this URL you can copy and this
06:50 - is the URL to which your Local Host 3000
06:54 - server will forward its data so let me
06:58 - uh open the uh browser tab once again
07:01 - and then open this URL first of all you
07:04 - will see this kind of interface which is
07:06 - going to give you some kind of
07:08 - information about enro and then when you
07:11 - click on visit you can see now I can see
07:15 - this hello world but the URL is
07:17 - different it's been exposed to internet
07:22 - securely using this URL so this URL I
07:26 - can give to my colleague or to to my
07:29 - friend who can also see the same result
07:33 - until my server is running locally right
07:36 - so this is how you can expose the local
07:39 - server which is running locally on your
07:42 - Mac operating system to the outside
07:45 - world you can also see that whenever you
07:49 - uh give some request it's going to show
07:53 - you all the requests which are coming to
07:56 - this URL to access this server
08:00 - here itself also when you go to your
08:03 - enro account so here you can go to your
08:06 - enro account where you will see all the
08:09 - data and you can see this URL starts
08:12 - with 3 e7f for example so you can go to
08:16 - the cloud Edge and see the end points
08:18 - and you can see what are the end points
08:21 - which are active using your angro
08:24 - accounts and from here you can also view
08:27 - what's happening with this this uh URL
08:31 - for example so I can click on this
08:33 - option here which is going to show me
08:36 - the traffic on This Server right so when
08:40 - I once again reload this this traffic is
08:44 - going to um once again update so you can
08:47 - see I received the request 34
08:52 - milliseconds ago so it updates really
08:56 - fast I also have some more advanced
08:59 - options
09:00 - here so these Advanced options are
09:03 - available with the paid version so if
09:06 - you want to uh upgrade to the paid
09:08 - version you can use these commands so
09:11 - for example you can also use TCP
09:13 - addresses you can also see uh the
09:15 - ingresses if you uh have any and then
09:18 - you can also have the observability of
09:21 - the traffic uh which is coming to your
09:24 - local server right this is how you can
09:27 - install enro on your Mac operating
09:30 - system and use it to expose your local
09:33 - server so I hope you have enjoyed this
09:35 - video and I will see you in the next
09:37 - video
