00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can use SCP command to copy
00:05 - your files or directories from your
00:08 - local machine to a remote server or from
00:13 - your remote server to your local machine
00:14 - how to use SCP for you know transferring
00:18 - files I'm going to show you so let's say
00:22 - I have a remote server on the right-hand
00:25 - side I have a virtual machine I'm going
00:27 - to treat it as a remote server so this
00:30 - on the right hand side is my remote
00:33 - server and on the left hand side this
00:35 - one is my local machine let's say and I
00:40 - want to transfer the file from my local
00:42 - machine to a remote server first of all
00:46 - and then I will show you the vice-versa
00:48 - so first of all let's see what are the
00:51 - options we have with the SCP command by
00:54 - the way as CP stands for secure copy and
00:57 - if you know CP command it's similar to
01:00 - that so just write SCP on your client
01:04 - and then press Enter which is going to
01:06 - show you all the options which you can
01:08 - use with the SCP so to use SCP you need
01:14 - to give the username and the host IP and
01:17 - then your file name for example so let's
01:20 - say I have a file called hello dot Sh
01:23 - on my desktop folder so I'm going to
01:27 - just CD to my desktop first of all and
01:30 - then I will transfer this hello dot Sh
01:33 - to the server to the home directory so
01:37 - this is my home directory and let me
01:40 - just do LS here which will list out all
01:43 - the files and directories in my remote
01:46 - server or in the home folder right so
01:50 - let's copy this hello dot Sh to the
01:53 - remote server so we will use a CP
01:56 - command and the IP of this remote server
02:00 - so to know the IP of the remote server
02:03 - you just say if config and then press
02:07 - enter and this is the IP address of the
02:10 - remote server right and then we also
02:12 - need the user
02:13 - so username in my case is code bind it
02:17 - can be different in your case right so
02:20 - first of all your file name so just give
02:23 - the file name in my case its hello dot
02:26 - Sh and then the host name which is code
02:30 - bind in my case it can be different in
02:35 - your case so this is the username right
02:36 - and then at the rate the IP address and
02:40 - then the IP address which is this one so
02:42 - I'm going to just write 192.168.255.255
02:54 - so in in whatever folder you want to
02:58 - transfer your files you just need to
03:00 - give the path of that so for example I
03:02 - want to just transfer my files to the
03:06 - home directory which is home forward
03:08 - slash code bind I will just write that
03:11 - here so I'm going to just paste it here
03:14 - so forward slash home forward slash code
03:17 - binder okay and then press Enter and for
03:20 - the first time it will ask you are you
03:22 - sure you want to continue connecting you
03:25 - can just say yes for the first time and
03:27 - then press ENTER and then it's going to
03:30 - need your remote servers password so the
03:34 - password you use to log into this remote
03:37 - server you need to give it here so I'm
03:39 - going to give the same password here and
03:42 - then this file is transferred and you
03:45 - can see this file is now appearing here
03:48 - also hello dot SH and then when I do LS
03:51 - here I can see this file once again here
03:54 - earlier this file was not present here
03:57 - okay so this is how you can transfer a
04:00 - file from your host PC to a remote
04:03 - server now let's say you have multiple
04:07 - files so you have some directory and
04:10 - then you want to transfer the content of
04:13 - that directory so let me just go to my
04:17 - home directory so I will just do CD and
04:21 - let me just clear the terminal and let's
04:24 - say I want to create a directory so I
04:26 - will just
04:27 - create a directory called test here or
04:30 - test123 here and then I will just CD
04:35 - into that directory CD test one two
04:38 - three and create some files so I will
04:40 - just use a touch command to create these
04:43 - files I'm not going to fill any content
04:46 - in these files but just the file name so
04:50 - for example file one dot txt and then
04:54 - file - dot txt and then file 3 dot dot
04:59 - txt any number of file you can create
05:02 - and then I will do LS to list out all
05:04 - the files right so these are all the
05:07 - files and I want to transfer these files
05:10 - with the directory to my remote server
05:13 - how can I do it so let me just go to my
05:16 - home folder once again and let me do LS
05:18 - so let's say I want to just transfer
05:21 - this directory okay so I will use the
05:25 - SCP command and then - R for recursive
05:28 - copying and once again the username so
05:32 - let me just use the same command which I
05:34 - used previously
05:36 - so SCP and then and then - our flag to
05:40 - copy your files or directory recursively
05:43 - and then your directory name so for
05:45 - example to my directory name is test 1 2
05:48 - 3 I want to transfer all the files in
05:51 - that directory so just give the name of
05:53 - your directory here ok and let's say I
05:56 - want to transfer this directory once
05:58 - again to my home folder of my remote
06:02 - server so username and then IP address
06:04 - and then the location where you want to
06:06 - transfer your directory ok so I will
06:09 - just press enter once again and give my
06:12 - password for my remote server once again
06:14 - and you can see this directory is copied
06:18 - to my remote server and inside this
06:20 - directory I have all these three files
06:22 - this I can verify from my command line
06:27 - also so test 1 2 3 LS and all these
06:30 - files are present here also now let's
06:34 - say I want to transfer or copy files
06:37 - from my remote server to my host server
06:41 - till now what we were doing is we were
06:43 - copying the files from our local machine
06:46 - to the remote server let's say I want to
06:49 - do the reverse of that so I want to copy
06:51 - them the files from the remote server to
06:54 - my home file so how can I do it so for
06:57 - doing this let's say what I want to
07:00 - transfer let's say I want to transfer
07:03 - this dot de B file right from my remote
07:08 - server to my local machine so let me
07:13 - just clear the terminal and let's see
07:16 - how we can do it so once again you use
07:18 - the SCP command and this time you use
07:21 - the username first of all of your remote
07:24 - server so code bind is the username and
07:29 - then the IP address of your remote
07:32 - server so once again I will see the IP
07:34 - address 192.168.1.1 right and then the
07:43 - semicolon and then the folder name from
07:46 - where you want to copy your file so home
07:49 - forward slash code bind this is the
07:54 - folder from where I want to copy my file
07:56 - and the file name itself so I want to
07:59 - copy this file right so just just write
08:03 - the file name here itself and then
08:06 - wherever you want to copy so for example
08:09 - I want to copy this dot de file from the
08:13 - remote server to my desktop so how can I
08:15 - do it so after the space I'm going to
08:18 - give the destination folder where I want
08:20 - to copy it so let's say home folder and
08:23 - then I want to copy it on my desktop so
08:27 - I will just give the destination folder
08:29 - name and then press Enter and then gave
08:32 - the password of my remote PC and then
08:35 - press ENTER and then it's going to start
08:37 - copying this file to my local machine
08:41 - you can see this is already present so
08:44 - it's giving us the percentage which is
08:47 - transferred now let's say on your remote
08:50 - server OpenSSH is running on some
08:53 - different port
08:55 - then the default port which is port 22
08:58 - so let's say it's running on port 1 2 3
09:02 - 4 then how you can you know use that
09:05 - port so you can just give SCP command
09:08 - once again to get the help and you can
09:11 - see with capital P flag you can give the
09:14 - port name right so last command we have
09:19 - given here you could have given if the
09:21 - port is different you could have given
09:23 - capital P and then port 1 2 3 4 for
09:27 - example if this open sss server on the
09:30 - server side on the remote server side
09:33 - runs on different port
09:35 - okay so port you can give something like
09:37 - this if this server has some you know
09:42 - private key and you want to connect it
09:45 - using your public key then you can use -
09:48 - a flag and the path to your public key
09:52 - here and then you will be able to
09:55 - connect it ok so if you want to connect
09:57 - it using your public key you can give -
10:00 - I flag and then forward slash your keys
10:03 - path so this is how you can use SCP
10:06 - command in your Linux operating system I
