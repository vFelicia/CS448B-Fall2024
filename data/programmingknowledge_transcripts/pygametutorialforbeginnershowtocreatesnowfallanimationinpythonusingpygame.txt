00:00 - hey everyone
00:02 - so till now we have talked about the
00:04 - font music and image module in buy game
00:06 - it's time we get a little bit inclined
00:08 - towards the video game creation part
00:11 - of pygame in this video we won't be
00:13 - creating a video game but yeah we would
00:15 - be doing something related
00:18 - we would try to see a snowfall we would
00:20 - try to create our own snowfall on the my
00:23 - game screen
00:24 - so if i'm talking about snow falling
00:26 - then
00:27 - it should make sense to you that we
00:29 - would do something related to the moving
00:31 - text or moving image
00:34 - but along the y axis
00:36 - and uh
00:38 - if it makes sense to you if you're able
00:40 - to think about that then yeah you're on
00:42 - the right path and you have
00:45 - actually understood what has happened
00:46 - till now
00:48 - and a little bit pre-requisite for this
00:51 - video would be the knowledge of the
00:53 - random module if you don't know about it
00:55 - it's all right i'd be telling you about
00:57 - random module moreover we would just be
01:00 - using a function from random module
01:04 - um i would need random module just think
01:06 - about it why would i need random module
01:08 - because i want snow on random spots of
01:11 - the screen okay
01:12 - so that's why i'd be using the random
01:14 - module
01:15 - so that i can have random coordinates
01:18 - all right
01:20 - so let's get to the code right away it's
01:22 - going to be very easy
01:25 - so first we have the basic three steps
01:29 - i hope you remember the first step is
01:32 - initializing pi game i have done so then
01:34 - i have imported random module just so i
01:37 - can take random spots random coordinates
01:39 - then i have the step two setting up the
01:42 - screen then i have taken up a
01:46 - list
01:48 - snow
01:49 - so what i would do is i had append
01:52 - some coordinates in snow
01:54 - which at at which i would need the
01:58 - snow
02:00 - at which i would draw the circles okay
02:03 - so
02:04 - i have run this for loop okay
02:07 - for range 50
02:09 - the
02:10 - length of the list would be 50
02:12 - and
02:14 - then i have picked up
02:16 - a random number
02:18 - this is what rand range does in random
02:21 - module it picks up a random number from
02:23 - the given uh
02:25 - range
02:26 - and similarly for y x y also y
02:29 - coordinate also
02:31 - and then i'd be appending the list
02:34 - to the snow list uh so snow becomes a 2d
02:38 - list just like this
02:41 - i hope you get it
02:43 - and
02:44 - so we have a list that has some random
02:47 - continents okay
02:49 - then i have set up this clock object
02:51 - from the time module
02:53 - so that i can work with the frame rate
02:55 - later
02:57 - you'd get the purpose of this later i'll
02:59 - tell you later
03:00 - at the end of the
03:01 - program
03:03 - now is our third step the game loop
03:06 - so then we have our
03:08 - evens loop
03:10 - as usual i have filled the screen with
03:12 - white color you can also take black
03:14 - color and white color snow doesn't
03:16 - matter
03:17 - now is the main part
03:19 - for ice in range let's know now we would
03:22 - be traversing each
03:24 - element of snow
03:27 - and
03:28 - draw a circle at that coordinate okay so
03:32 - for that i have written pygame.draw i've
03:34 - used the draw module and used the draw
03:37 - and use the circle function from draw
03:40 - so this is the screen uh the surface on
03:42 - which we want to draw then we have i've
03:44 - mentioned the color i want blue circles
03:47 - um and then the coordinate would be
03:50 - given by snow ice
03:52 - okay and the
03:54 - radius would be two pixels
03:58 - since i want the snow to fall along
04:01 - y-axis i'd be increasing the y-axis
04:05 - you can see like
04:07 - the
04:07 - y-axis would be given
04:10 - by the ice elements
04:13 - first
04:16 - element okay
04:17 - this might be a little jumbling how do
04:19 - you access a today list you go to the
04:23 - first
04:24 - number like i go to the ice element iced
04:27 - element and
04:29 - then go to the first element inside that
04:32 - list so this becomes
04:35 - the y coordinate of the random
04:38 - y coordinate of the random point okay
04:41 - cool so i'd be increasing that by one
04:44 - each time okay because i want the next
04:47 - part to be just below it i do not change
04:50 - the x axis
04:51 - but i change the y axis because i want
04:53 - the snow to fall down
04:56 - now
04:57 - there is this corner
04:59 - case that if the snow if the coordinate
05:02 - now becomes greater than the screen size
05:04 - which is 400 right now
05:06 - then what i do is i pick any random
05:10 - number again i had completely changed
05:12 - the coordinate i'd pick any random
05:14 - number from minus 50 to minus 10 because
05:18 - i i want the drop i want the snow to
05:21 - fall from the top and not from any
05:23 - random point and not from in between
05:26 - so that's why i've taken this negative
05:28 - range
05:29 - and i'd reassign the value of the x
05:31 - coordinate also since it's ice and zero
05:34 - in square brackets
05:36 - then i update
05:39 - the display you can also use flip here
05:42 - not problem then i have used this clock
05:45 - object and use the tick function
05:48 - so that i can set up the frame rate by
05:50 - default at zero if it's if you do not
05:52 - mention this the
05:54 - snow would fall
05:56 - in a flash like it's it would look like
05:58 - it's running the snow is running it
06:00 - won't make any sense
06:02 - so the larger the frame rate is
06:05 - the slower is the snowfall okay so let's
06:08 - check it out how this works
06:15 - so we have our snow falling
06:17 - very properly
06:18 - just randomly from anywhere as snowfall
06:21 - is you can also take up different colors
06:24 - like let me change the color here
06:26 - let me do black
06:29 - and
06:30 - make the circle of white color
06:34 - so let's run this
06:37 - yeah
06:38 - this also looks nice
06:40 - uh you can try either one you can even
06:43 - have any combination of colors
06:45 - so that's pretty much it
06:47 - about this video
06:49 - hope you understood the program
06:52 - we'll do more in the next videos in the
06:54 - upcoming videos
06:56 - thank you
