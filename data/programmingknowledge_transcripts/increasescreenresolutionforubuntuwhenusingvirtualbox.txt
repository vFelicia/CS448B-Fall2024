00:08 - your Windows host by using virtual box
00:12 - the first thing which You observe is the
00:15 - screen appearance it's little bit bigger
00:20 - in size and it doesn't look exactly the
00:24 - same when you install fresh ubu on
00:29 - without your virtual machine so today I
00:32 - will show you how to improve the exact
00:35 - same
00:37 - appearance if you would have installed
00:40 - obuntu on some
00:43 - individual computer or
00:46 - PC so let's get
00:49 - started open your terminal and just
