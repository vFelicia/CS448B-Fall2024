00:00 - so first of all what is virtualbox
00:03 - so oracle virtualbox is a free and open
00:06 - source hosted hypervisor for
00:09 - virtualization in other words virtualbox
00:12 - helps you
00:13 - to install different operating system
00:16 - virtually on your host operating system
00:20 - in this case our host operating system
00:23 - is windows 11
00:25 - and you can install for example ubuntu
00:28 - or
00:29 - windows 10 or any other linux or
00:33 - other operating system
00:35 - using virtualbox on your windows 11
00:38 - operating system so let's see how we can
00:40 - install it so first of all just open
00:42 - your favorite browser and search for
00:43 - virtualbox and the first link which will
00:45 - appear here will be from
00:47 - virtualbox.org so we are going to just
00:49 - click on this link
00:51 - and once
00:53 - virtualbox.org website opens directly
00:55 - you will be able to see
00:57 - download button here
00:59 - otherwise you can also click on the
01:02 - downloads link here and you will
01:05 - go to the downloads page right
01:07 - so i'm going to just click on this
01:09 - button
01:10 - and here you will be able to see
01:13 - the installation package for different
01:17 - operating systems so we want virtualbox
01:20 - for windows operating system so we will
01:22 - choose windows host
01:25 - and it's going to download virtualbox
01:28 - exe file on my windows 11 operating
01:31 - system so once this exe file is
01:34 - downloaded i'm going to just click on
01:35 - this file and i'm going to minimize my
01:38 - browser and you can see the installer
01:40 - has been started
01:42 - so on this first setup window you just
01:45 - need to click on the next button
01:47 - and
01:48 - here you can just leave everything as
01:51 - default and the default location for
01:53 - virtualbox will be this location so if
01:56 - you don't have the good reason to change
01:58 - this location just leave it as default
02:00 - and then click on next
02:02 - so on the next window you can see the
02:05 - custom setup
02:07 - window and here you can leave everything
02:10 - as checked and this is going to create a
02:14 - desktop icon of virtualbox on your
02:17 - windows 11 operating system and it's
02:19 - going to create a shortcut in the quick
02:22 - launch bar and other features so i
02:25 - generally leave all the checkboxes
02:27 - checked and then i click on the next
02:30 - button
02:31 - and at this point you just need to press
02:34 - yes
02:35 - and then click on install which is going
02:39 - to start the process of installation of
02:41 - virtualbox and if you see this kind of
02:44 - warning just click on yes
02:46 - and now you can see the virtualbox
02:49 - installation has been started you just
02:51 - need to wait for some time
02:53 - until this installation is finished if
02:56 - you see this kind of warning would you
02:58 - like to install this device software
03:01 - this means that virtualbox wants to
03:04 - install some
03:05 - device software
03:07 - on your windows 11 operating system so i
03:09 - trust virtualbox to install these
03:12 - software on my windows 11 operating
03:14 - system so i will click on install and
03:16 - now i can see that this virtualbox icon
03:19 - is created on my desktop and in few
03:22 - seconds you will see this message which
03:24 - says
03:25 - oracle virtualbox installation is
03:27 - complete and at this point just leave
03:29 - this checkbox has checked which is going
03:32 - to launch virtualbox and then click on
03:34 - finish so now i can see that virtualbox
03:37 - has been started on my windows 11
03:40 - operating system
03:41 - so let me
03:42 - introduce some of the features about
03:45 - virtualbox how you can create a virtual
03:48 - machine using virtualbox
03:51 - so for creating a new virtual machine
03:53 - you can click on the new button here or
03:56 - you can click on machine and then click
03:58 - on new option from here also so i'm
04:00 - going to click on the new option here
04:03 - and here first of all you need to have
04:06 - the iso file of the operating system
04:08 - which you want to install right
04:11 - so for example if you want to install
04:13 - ubuntu operating system you can download
04:16 - the iso file for ubuntu operating system
04:18 - from its website similarly you can
04:21 - download windows 10 or windows 11 iso
04:24 - file from the microsoft website
04:27 - and use it to install on your virtual
04:30 - box so as i said you need the iso file
04:32 - of the operating system and the
04:34 - virtualbox in order to install
04:36 - that operating system virtually on your
04:39 - windows 11 operating system so once you
04:42 - have virtualbox
04:44 - the next thing you will require is
04:46 - the ubuntu 22.04
04:49 - iso file
04:51 - so let's download that so for that you
04:53 - just need to type
04:55 - ubuntu on your favorite browser and the
04:57 - first link which will appear here will
04:58 - be from ubuntu.com so we are going to
05:01 - just click on this link
05:03 - and then under downloads so just click
05:06 - on the downloads
05:08 - and then you will be able to see this
05:10 - 22.04
05:12 - version here right
05:14 - so make sure you always choose the lts
05:18 - version because the support for lts
05:20 - version is longer lts stands for long
05:24 - term support right so the name says
05:26 - itself right
05:28 - so
05:29 - just click on this green button which is
05:33 - 22.04 lts
05:35 - and once you click on this button you
05:37 - will see that this ubuntu
05:40 - 22.04 iso file will start downloading
05:44 - now this file is around 3.4 gb right so
05:48 - it will take some time
05:50 - to download so after downloading the
05:53 - ubuntu iso file it's going to look like
05:55 - this right so it says ubuntu 22.04
06:00 - hyphen stop hyphen amd64.iso
06:05 - now once you have the iso file and your
06:08 - virtual box let's see how we can install
06:11 - it on our virtualbox using this
06:14 - virtualbox manager
06:16 - so for that what you need to do just
06:18 - click on this new button here and then
06:22 - give the name to your machine i'm going
06:24 - to name my machine as
06:27 - ubuntu and you can see virtualbox is
06:30 - smart enough and it already selects us
06:34 - the type which is linux and the version
06:37 - which is
06:38 - open to 64 bit
06:40 - if you don't see this version here you
06:43 - can just click on this drop down menu
06:45 - and you will be able to see this open to
06:47 - 64 bit
06:49 - option
06:50 - now let me name my machine as open to
06:52 - 22.04
06:54 - so i know that this is
06:57 - the version which i have installed
06:59 - because i already have the other
07:01 - version of ubuntu
07:03 - right
07:04 - and then you need to select the machine
07:07 - folder where you want to save your
07:09 - virtualbox vms right
07:12 - by default this is the default location
07:14 - you can also change this location by
07:17 - clicking on other
07:18 - and then you can choose where you want
07:20 - to save your machine right so let's say
07:23 - i want to save this machine on
07:25 - my
07:26 - d drive so i'm going to just select that
07:29 - and then select the folder
07:31 - and then click on next
07:33 - now on the next window you will be asked
07:36 - to select the memory size
07:38 - now what i generally do i generally move
07:41 - this scroll bar until the end of this
07:45 - green
07:46 - mark right so here in between the red
07:49 - and green mark right
07:52 - so
07:53 - here until this green mark it's okay and
07:56 - this value depends on the memory size of
07:59 - your computer right
08:01 - so just select that and then click on
08:03 - next
08:05 - now on the next window you can see three
08:08 - options for hard disk first one is do
08:10 - not add a virtual hard disk
08:13 - uh second one is create a virtual hard
08:15 - disk now and the third one is use an
08:18 - existing virtual hard disk file
08:21 - i'm going to leave it as default which
08:22 - is create a new virtual hard disk now
08:25 - and then click on create right
08:29 - in the next
08:30 - window you can see the hard disk file
08:33 - type i generally leave it as default
08:35 - which is vdi format and then click on
08:37 - next now on this next window also
08:40 - you can leave it as default which is
08:42 - dynamically allocated
08:44 - the other option is fixed size and you
08:47 - can see the difference between the
08:49 - dynamically allocated and fixed size you
08:51 - can read this text so dynamically
08:54 - allocated disk
08:56 - file will only use the space on your
08:59 - physical hard disk as it fills up right
09:02 - so it's dynamic
09:04 - if you want to choose the fixed size
09:06 - then the size will be fixed right so i
09:08 - will choose the dynamically allocated
09:10 - and then click on next
09:12 - on the next window you can choose the
09:15 - file location and size right so i have
09:18 - already uh chosen this file location in
09:21 - my d drive and then i can
09:24 - also select the size of my virtual hard
09:27 - disk
09:28 - generally i use around 100 gb for my
09:31 - virtual machines so i'm going to move it
09:34 - to 100 gb and then click on create
09:38 - and what it's going to do it's going to
09:41 - create this virtual machine
09:44 - but still we haven't provided the iso
09:46 - file path right
09:48 - so before starting this virtual machine
09:51 - just select the virtual machine which
09:53 - you created for ubuntu 22.04
09:57 - and then click on settings
09:59 - and here you will be able to do some
10:02 - more extra settings for your virtual
10:05 - machine
10:06 - so under general section
10:08 - you can click on advanced here
10:11 - and then
10:12 - under shared clipboard and drag and drop
10:15 - both are disabled by default you can
10:18 - just make them bi-directional this means
10:22 - that you can drag and drop from your
10:25 - windows
10:26 - operating system to your virtual machine
10:28 - which is ubuntu
10:30 - and you can also have a shared clipboard
10:34 - between them right
10:36 - then
10:37 - leave the other two tabs as uh it is and
10:41 - then click on the system uh section here
10:44 - right now in the system section
10:48 - you can select the processors
10:50 - so by default virtualbox manager
10:53 - allocates one processor for the virtual
10:55 - machine i can move it to uh here
10:59 - maximum i can allocate for example in my
11:02 - machine 8
11:03 - cpus
11:05 - but
11:06 - for now i'm going to allocate 4 cpus for
11:09 - my
11:10 - ubuntu operating system
11:12 - now i can also do the settings related
11:16 - to display
11:17 - i'm going to leave everything as default
11:20 - for now
11:21 - and then
11:22 - when you click on storage here you can
11:24 - provide the location of your iso file so
11:28 - you just need to click on this empty
11:31 - disk icon and then
11:34 - you can click on this md disk icon again
11:37 - and then you just need to
11:40 - browse go to the location where your
11:43 - ubuntu iso file is located
11:47 - so you can see uh this is my open to iso
11:50 - file so i'm going to just select this
11:51 - iso file and then click on open
11:54 - and you can see this iso file is now
11:58 - selected here right
12:01 - so once that's done you can leave other
12:03 - settings
12:05 - as default for now and then click on ok
12:08 - and once you are done with all the
12:11 - settings you can select your virtual
12:13 - machine and then click on start so you
12:15 - can see my virtual machine is starting
12:18 - on the first window you will see
12:21 - this kind of terminal
12:23 - here you can just
12:25 - use your up and down arrow keys
12:29 - to
12:30 - move this selection up or down right so
12:34 - here i'm going to choose the first
12:36 - option which is try or install ubuntu
12:38 - and then press enter and now you can see
12:41 - the installation of ubuntu
12:43 - will start so first of all in this
12:46 - installation process you will see this
12:48 - kind of window
12:50 - here you can choose your favorite
12:52 - language in my case i'm going to choose
12:54 - english here
12:55 - and then i'm going to click on the
12:58 - install ubuntu option so let me click on
13:01 - install ubuntu
13:02 - now on the second window you will be
13:04 - asked to choose your keyboard layout
13:08 - right
13:09 - so in different countries uh we can use
13:12 - different kind of keyboard layouts
13:15 - so from here you can select that
13:17 - keyboard layout
13:19 - for example in my case i'm using german
13:22 - keyboard layout so i'm going to just
13:25 - select the german keyboard layout from
13:28 - here so let me select german here and
13:30 - i'm going to just select the normal
13:33 - german keyboard layout right
13:35 - and then i'm going to click on continue
13:38 - now on this next window
13:41 - you can see this kind of message which
13:43 - says update and other software
13:47 - what apps would you like to install to
13:49 - start with
13:51 - so i'm going to just select the normal
13:53 - installation here
13:55 - and then
13:56 - in the other options download updates
13:58 - while installing ubuntu and i'm also
14:00 - going to select install third party
14:03 - software for graphics and wi-fi hardware
14:05 - and additional media formats right so
14:08 - check this checkbox and then click on
14:10 - continue
14:11 - now you will see this kind of window so
14:14 - here
14:15 - some people get confused because here
14:18 - you can see this message it is disk and
14:21 - install ubuntu but you don't need to
14:23 - worry about it it's not going to erase
14:26 - anything from your host machine it's
14:29 - just the installation step so for
14:31 - example if you want to install ubuntu on
14:34 - an actual hardware then this step is
14:37 - valid and
14:38 - if you are installing ubuntu virtually
14:41 - you don't need to
14:42 - worry about this
14:44 - message right
14:46 - so just
14:47 - leave it as it is disk and install
14:49 - ubuntu and then click on install now
14:52 - and from here you can choose
14:55 - the region in which you are located
14:58 - by default
15:00 - ubuntu has recognized my approximate
15:03 - location which is berlin which
15:06 - is good for me i'm going to click on
15:07 - continue
15:10 - and then
15:11 - here you can provide some information
15:14 - about you and your machine right
15:17 - so your name
15:19 - so i'm going to just uh name my machine
15:22 - as
15:23 - codebind for example and then the
15:26 - computer's name will be this one by
15:29 - default which is the name you provided
15:32 - hyphen virtualbox i generally
15:35 - remove the virtualbox from here because
15:37 - i like to
15:39 - keep my computer name and my name as
15:41 - same
15:43 - the username will be
15:45 - the same also and then you can choose
15:48 - the password here i'm going to choose a
15:50 - very simple password
15:52 - for now uh just for the demonstration
15:55 - but you might want to choose a strong
15:58 - password here
15:59 - and then you can click on continue
16:03 - and now the installation of ubuntu will
16:07 - start
16:08 - and you just need to wait for some time
16:11 - until this progress bar reaches to the
16:13 - 100 mark for each and every tool and now
16:18 - at last you will see this message which
16:20 - says
16:21 - installation complete installation is
16:23 - complete you need to restart the
16:25 - computer in order to use the new
16:28 - installation
16:29 - so at this point you just need to click
16:31 - on restart
16:32 - now button which is going to restart
16:35 - this ubuntu operating system so you can
16:37 - see it says please remove the
16:39 - installation medium and then press enter
16:42 - so at this point i'm going to just press
16:44 - enter here and now i can see my ubuntu
16:47 - operating system is restarting so as you
16:50 - can see my ubuntu operating system has
16:53 - been successfully installed
16:55 - and now i can see uh the login window
16:58 - here
16:59 - so this is the username which i have
17:02 - provided at the time of installation so
17:04 - i'm going to click on this
17:06 - and then
17:07 - the password i need to provide here is
17:09 - the password which i have provided at
17:11 - the time of installation right so i'm
17:14 - going to just provide the same password
17:16 - press enter which is going to log me
17:18 - inside my ubuntu operating system and
17:21 - now you can see my ubuntu operating
17:23 - system has been restarted
17:26 - and first of all when you start ubuntu
17:30 - operating system for the first time it's
17:32 - going to show you this kind of message
17:35 - which says connect your online account
17:37 - here
17:38 - for now i'm going to skip this and then
17:41 - it says help improve ubuntu
17:44 - also i'm going to click on next here and
17:46 - then click on next
17:48 - and then click on done now i can start
17:50 - using this ubuntu
17:52 - 22.04 lts
17:55 - version virtually on my windows 11
17:57 - operating system and let me just
18:00 - maximize this ubuntu operating system so
18:03 - that it will be the size of my windows
18:07 - desktop
18:08 - so when i do that you will observe that
18:12 - this window doesn't resize according to
18:15 - the size of my
18:17 - windows desktop so to fix this problem
18:21 - we need to install the virtualbox guest
18:23 - additions on our ubuntu operating system
18:28 - so for this what you need to do
18:30 - so you need to give these two commands
18:32 - before installing virtualbox guest

19:39 - just going to install
19:41 - these two packages and once the second
19:43 - command is also finished
19:46 - then we can install the virtualbox guest

20:41 - which is
20:42 - autorun.sh
20:45 - which is going to start the installation
20:47 - of this virtualbox guest additions
20:50 - so first of all you need to provide your
20:52 - password so i'm going to provide my
20:54 - password which i have given at the time
20:55 - of installation of ubuntu and then press
20:58 - enter
20:59 - and now it's going to start the

29:11 - windows 11. maybe virtualbox will fix
29:14 - this problem later so you won't see this
29:17 - problem
29:18 - but in my version and at the time of
29:20 - making this video
29:22 - this problem arises so let me show you
29:24 - how you can fix this problem
29:26 - so for fixing this problem you just need
29:28 - to close this window and then click on
29:31 - yes
29:32 - and then you can once again close this
29:34 - window and then click on power of the
29:36 - machine
29:38 - and once you click on the power of the
29:40 - machine option
29:41 - you just need to select this windows 11

29:46 - again
29:47 - now once you see this window in your
29:50 - virtual box when you install windows 11
29:53 - at this point you need to press shift
29:55 - f10 key okay so just press shift and the
30:00 - f10 key together which is going to open
30:02 - this command line right
30:05 - once this command line opens you need to
30:08 - type
30:09 - reg edit reg edit i am going to put each
30:14 - and every command in the description of
30:16 - this video so you can see
30:18 - which command you need to
30:20 - give in order
30:22 - to follow this video right so just type
30:25 - reg edit here and then press enter which
30:28 - is going to open this kind of window
30:30 - which is called registry editor window
30:34 - now here
30:35 - in the h key local machine option so
30:38 - just expand this option
30:40 - you will be able to see system options
30:42 - so just expand this also
30:44 - and then you will be able to see setup
30:46 - options so just expand this setup option
30:48 - also now on the setup you just need to
30:51 - right click here and then click on new
30:54 - and then click on
30:56 - key here
30:57 - and then
30:58 - just name it as lab config so just type

31:04 - c o n f i g okay so make sure
31:08 - your lab config
31:10 - looks similar to what i have typed with
31:13 - the capital l and capital c and then
31:16 - press enter which is going to create
31:18 - this key for you now once you have
31:20 - created this key just click on this lab
31:22 - config key and on the right hand side
31:24 - just right click here and then click on
31:26 - new and then select d word 32 value
31:31 - and name this value as bypass tpm check

31:45 - then press enter
31:46 - once this key is created just right
31:48 - click on it once again and then click on
31:50 - modify
31:52 - and here
31:53 - in the value data you need to change it
31:55 - to
31:56 - one instead of zero here okay so make
31:59 - sure that you enter value data is equal
32:02 - to 1 and then click on ok once this is

32:23 - once this key is created once again we
32:25 - will modify this value and we will
32:28 - just give the data value to 1 and then
32:31 - click on ok right so basically we have
32:34 - created two values one is bypass tpm
32:37 - check and other is bypass secure boot
32:39 - check and we have given the value 1 here
32:44 - in both
32:46 - the keys right basically what it's going
32:49 - to do is it's going to bypass the tpm
32:51 - check and the secure boot check so once
