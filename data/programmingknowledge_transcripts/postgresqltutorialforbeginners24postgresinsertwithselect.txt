00:00 - hello friends welcome program knowledge
00:01 - in this video we see how we can copy
00:05 - data from one table to another table so
00:09 - to perform this type of us we are going
00:13 - to use insert into select statement so
00:17 - there are few things that you must need
00:19 - to know before you going into further
00:21 - that is when you are copying data from
00:26 - one table to another table the
00:28 - corresponding column data types must be
00:31 - the same that's obvious because you
00:34 - cannot copy and column data which says
00:37 - data type from integer into the table in
00:41 - which the data type has worker of
00:43 - character so corresponding data type of
00:46 - the column must be the same so let us
00:49 - see the statement first so we are going
00:57 - to use insert into then the name of the
01:05 - table target table in which we want to
01:08 - insert the data and select here you can
01:26 - provide some condition if you want okay
01:33 - so okay insert into target temple in
01:36 - which you want to insert the data select
01:40 - star from source table from which you
01:42 - are going to copy the data and provide
01:45 - the condition if you want in okay so let
01:48 - us open terminal write PS queuing now
01:59 - let us see which are the databases
02:01 - present in our system for that we are
02:03 - going to use backslash L here as you can
02:08 - see we have a spectable for connecting
02:11 - the testicles we are going to use
02:13 - Beks let's say for connecting and then
02:15 - name the database now we are connected
02:19 - to testify now let us see which are the
02:22 - tables present in our system backs
02:24 - Leslie so we have three tables here
02:27 - employee mobile intruder
02:29 - so let us see the structure of employee
02:32 - table they accessory and name of the
02:34 - table so it is employee ID and employee
02:42 - name integer datatype and where k okay
02:44 - now let us see these student structure
02:49 - as you can see corresponding data type
02:53 - at the same integer n way okay so we can
02:57 - copy data from one table to another
02:59 - table now select star from employee so
03:09 - this is the present in employee table
03:12 - and this is the data resonance notable
03:20 - now I want to copy these all the data
03:25 - into the employee table okay so I write
03:28 - insert into target table which is
03:35 - entering this is exit we are going to
03:48 - intersect daytime employee from this
03:52 - work okay insert file now let us see the
03:57 - data in the employee table as you can
04:07 - see student data is copied in employee
04:11 - table
04:12 - so this is a in copy data from one table
04:15 - to another table so let me just close
04:19 - this now
04:26 - in taste database open query do okay now
04:36 - I want to insert the employee data into
04:42 - these students table okay but first of
04:46 - all student table is not empty so let us
04:53 - say this one doubles this data
05:01 - I have already copied into employ tables
05:04 - so again if I try to copy today time
05:07 - toast on table again it will give me an
05:09 - error because of the primary key
05:11 - constraint okay so let me just erase the
05:15 - data
05:32 - okay if you have seen my earlier videos
05:37 - I have explained what is truncate
05:41 - basically truncate is used to delete all
05:44 - the later present in the table okay so
05:49 - let us see it's okay now I want to cook
06:01 - that up back in to stone table from the
06:03 - table okay let me just show you the
06:07 - employee targets instead
06:25 - okay now this time target table filled
06:29 - Eastern table because we want to set the
06:31 - time to start early and we are going to
06:34 - select data from the incredible sir
06:36 - table to select from again let us
06:44 - understand this statement in something
06:47 - to because we want to insert something
06:49 - into the devil target that one will be
06:52 - storing because we want to copy daytime
06:55 - to this one anyway I am going to put
06:58 - their time to strong by taking heat from
07:01 - the employee table so we write a
07:03 - protocol in this source table okay when
07:07 - you get one successful now let us see
07:12 - silly stupid as you can see data has
07:25 - been copied into stone table now run
07:28 - table and the employ table is the same
07:30 - data now let me just show you how you
07:34 - can provide some condition so let me
07:37 - just struck it this time employee table
07:48 - now select I want to copy the data I
08:05 - have copied these four rows from the
08:07 - employee table earlier okay now I want
08:10 - to transfer it to the employee table
08:11 - again okay so how I can write it okay
08:21 - insert into employee will be able
08:29 - targetable we are going to select data
08:33 - from this phone table from where now it
08:45 - has roll number okay like we are going
08:53 - to buy that you have not seen my past
08:56 - video then you say it because I they
09:00 - explain how to use my card okay like
09:09 - underscored represent only one digit now
09:14 - roll number has T data type of integer
09:18 - so I have to write text careful for
09:23 - explicit type rushed okay
09:26 - insect photos let us see the incredible
09:30 - okay as you can see our data is back so
09:43 - this is how you can use Internet
09:46 - insert into select statement to copy the
09:49 - data from one table to another table and
09:52 - also you can provide some conditions as
09:54 - for work
