00:00 - hello friends welcome to my knowledge in
00:02 - this video we will see how we can use
00:04 - our operator to join multiple conditions
00:07 - in stable queries so first of all open
00:11 - your terminal right is given now let us
00:18 - see which are the databases polygamous
00:20 - system so we have a stable so we are
00:25 - going to use that for me let us see for
00:27 - connecting and we have drawn table in
00:35 - our previous video we saw that how we
00:37 - can use interpreter to join multiple
00:39 - queries so this time we are going to is
00:43 - or operator there is only one simple
00:47 - difference between end and power
00:49 - operator in our operator if you want
00:52 - that all statement we will come true
00:55 - with that it is not necessary that every
01:00 - condition that you write in sequel query
01:03 - have to become true if any one of them
01:06 - become true then all condition become
01:08 - true let me speak
01:28 - and you can't hear is equal to AJ and we
01:37 - gave nothing because Bridgend name is
01:40 - present but roll number to 10 to 20 is
01:44 - not present in our table so in order to
01:49 - in order to satisfy this whole condition
01:52 - both individual condition must be true
01:54 - because we write end of it up let us say
01:58 - if we change the Smith or then were
02:01 - critical here you can see we get close
02:08 - because in order to satisfy this fall
02:12 - condition
02:13 - if any of them is true then these all
02:17 - condition becomes true so this is the
02:20 - difference between N and our operator so
02:24 - that means just waiting and open to
02:27 - Jamie in test and query tool okay so let
02:35 - me write a sequel today where let's say
02:52 - mu is equal to vision here in Tennessee
03:07 - which income twice in the devil and
03:11 - overcome price so there are totally fine
03:13 - so there to be wait I can start him and
03:20 - you can see so this is how he can use
03:28 - all operator to join multiple condition
03:32 - in your spirit thanks for watching it
