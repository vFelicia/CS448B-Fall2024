00:00 - hello guys welcome once again in the
00:02 - last video I have shown you how you can
00:04 - use function templates in C++ and I have
00:07 - shown you how to use a function template
00:09 - which takes one parameter and I have
00:12 - shown you what is a single restriction a
00:16 - small restriction which uh this template
00:19 - function has and which is when you use a
00:22 - single data type as a as a function
00:26 - parameter and indicating function
00:29 - parameter as data type here okay so when
00:32 - we use function parameter as a single
00:35 - data type you need to give the single
00:38 - value or single data type value to the
00:42 - function so I need to pass the single
00:44 - data type here here and I cannot pass
00:48 - two different data type when I am using
00:52 - a single data type here
00:54 - right now in order to solve this problem
00:58 - uh we can pass multiple p parameters two
01:01 - templates okay so for example I want to
01:04 - calculate the maximum of two values and
01:08 - I want that these two uh data type of
01:10 - these two values I'm passing should be
01:13 - different one can be integer or or other
01:16 - can be double or one can be float or
01:18 - other can be uh integer double or any
01:21 - value right so what I can do is for
01:25 - example I want to calculate the maximum
01:27 - value I can use a tary
01:31 - operators to calculate it and I can say
01:34 - when a is greater than b then return
01:39 - me a or otherwise return me B okay so
01:45 - this is a turny operator which gives uh
01:49 - the result of the condition if the
01:51 - condition is true it gives the first
01:54 - value if the condition is false it gives
01:56 - the second value okay now I want to pass
01:59 - to different data types so what I can do
02:02 - is I can just pass two different data
02:05 - type by just copying and pasting uh as
02:09 - an argument you know when you want to
02:12 - pass uh multiple data types to a
02:14 - function you just separate them by comma
02:18 - In Here Also you just need to separate
02:20 - them by comma but just change the
02:24 - name First Data type and for example
02:31 - second data type okay and for example I
02:34 - want to return First Data type and I
02:36 - want to pass First Data type as a first
02:39 - argument of the function and second data
02:42 - type as a second argument of the
02:43 - function okay and I want to calculate
02:47 - the maximum value okay now I can pass
02:51 - integer or double here and it'll be fine
02:56 - and I can run this and it gives me the
02:58 - result
03:00 - okay and for example I can I want to
03:04 - change this this should be for example
03:09 - float float and
03:13 - 36.4 and this should be integer for
03:16 - example which is
03:19 - 46 compile it and run it and still gives
03:24 - me the result right so in this way you
03:27 - can pass multiple parameters to uh your
03:31 - function template and it gives you more
03:34 - flexibility in order to in order to use
03:37 - multiple parameters so I hope you have
03:39 - enjoyed this video please wait comment
03:41 - and subscribe and bye for now
