00:01 - hello and welcome back to the new video
00:02 - of java tutorial series uh so till now
00:05 - we have covered arrays in Java and for
00:07 - this video we will be covering some
00:09 - practice questions in arrays okay so
00:12 - what is first question uh write a Java
00:15 - program to sum the values of an array so
00:17 - input to this program is an array so you
00:21 - are giving you are given an array as a
00:23 - input you have to print the sum of the
00:26 - elements of elements which are present
00:27 - inside the array okay so let me open my
00:30 - IDE
00:31 - and I will create one new Java class
00:35 - name as
00:42 - practice
00:45 - questions
00:48 - let me increase the font size
00:50 - I'll write my main method
00:54 - okay and now I have to declare one array
00:57 - which will be given as input to the
01:00 - program
01:01 - int
01:04 - array
01:06 - equals to
01:08 - and I will assign values to the array
01:10 - here itself let's suppose one comma 2
01:14 - comma 3 comma 4 comma 5 comma
01:19 - six comma seven
01:21 - comma 8 comma
01:23 - okay so this is this is our array
01:26 - and now uh
01:28 - I again I will require one variable to
01:31 - store the sum sums value
01:34 - okay now
01:36 - I will use enhance for loop I I hope you
01:39 - guys don't know what is an answer for
01:41 - Loop for it's like a for each loop I
01:44 - will write int I
01:46 - in
01:47 - ARR
01:49 - what uh what we have done here is for
01:52 - every integer value inside array will
01:57 - run this Loop okay and what we are going
02:00 - to do inside this Loop sum plus is
02:02 - equals to
02:04 - I means we'll update the sums value with
02:07 - the value which we are getting uh from
02:10 - inside the array okay now at the last I
02:13 - will just simply print
02:15 - the
02:16 - sum is
02:19 - and I will concat it with the value of
02:22 - sum
02:24 - okay so now if I run this
02:28 - should print the value of summation of 1
02:31 - to 9. okay the sum is 45 now it's
02:35 - working properly
02:36 - so moving forward to the next question
02:39 - uh write a Java program to print the
02:42 - following grid so this is the grid that
02:44 - you are supposed to print on the console
02:45 - uh it has a zero sorry one two three
02:50 - four five six seven eight nine ten uh
02:54 - ten columns and one two three four five
02:57 - six seven eight nine ten ten by ten grid
02:59 - is this and you are supposed to print
03:02 - this okay and
03:04 - and so let me get into my ID I will
03:08 - comment this out
03:11 - this is the solution for the question
03:12 - number one I will comment
03:14 - and I will write one one more comment as
03:17 - solution
03:19 - to question number one
03:25 - now from here onwards I will write
03:29 - solution
03:32 - to question two
03:34 - and inside this we required
03:38 - multi-dimensional array because Matrix
03:41 - is there and so I will declare one
03:44 - multi-dimensional array over here
03:46 - integer
03:50 - this and this and I will name my array
03:53 - as a which is equals to
03:56 - new
03:58 - integer of 10 by 10 because our grade is
04:02 - 10 by 10
04:03 - Matrix
04:05 - and after this I require one for Loop
04:09 - of for Loop
04:12 - integer I is equals to 0 and
04:17 - I is less than 10 less than 10 means the
04:21 - loop will run from 0 to 9 which is 10
04:23 - times and each time I will increment the
04:25 - value of i as I plus plus and inside
04:28 - this Loop uh again I require one more
04:31 - for Loop to track the columns first
04:35 - first row will track the rows and second
04:37 - for Loop will track The Columns and
04:40 - inside this I will write intj is equals
04:42 - to 0.
04:44 - whenever my J is less than 10
04:47 - I will do J plus plus
04:51 - okay and inside this inner for loop I
04:55 - will be doing
04:56 - system.println
05:01 - person
05:02 - 2D
05:05 - and I will
05:08 - I will pass it a value as any at ith
05:11 - index and red jet sorry jet index
05:16 - Okay so
05:18 - after this I will do this okay
05:23 - now it's okay
05:26 - wait I will again simply print the
05:30 - value which is inside the array at I I
05:32 - comma jet index and after printing the
05:36 - inner for loop I need to move to the
05:39 - next row and for that for that I will
05:42 - simply write one print statement so that
05:45 - I the so that the program execution will
05:47 - get to the next line okay
05:50 - now if I run this
05:52 - class
05:55 - you can see Zero Zero is getting
05:58 - printing on the console
06:00 - uh one mistake is there I have written
06:03 - print Ln instead of I should write print
06:05 - so that
06:07 - every time a new line should not get
06:10 - printed on the console now it's working
06:12 - fine yes you can see 10 by 10 uh grid is
06:16 - printed Matrix so this is this is the
06:20 - expected output that we have we want to
06:22 - print on the console okay
06:24 - so next question is write a Java program
06:27 - to calculate the average value of the
06:29 - array elements okay
06:31 - so you have given one array you just
06:34 - have to
06:35 - print the average of the elements which
06:37 - are present inside the array okay
06:39 - assuming that the there are integer
06:41 - values which are present inside the
06:42 - array okay so now again I will comment
06:47 - this solution of the question number two
06:50 - and I will write down one more comment
06:52 - which is
06:54 - solution
06:56 - to question number three
06:59 - okay so first of all we require one
07:03 - array okay so I will declare one array
07:06 - of type in of type integers and I will
07:10 - name it as numbers
07:12 - which whose value is equals to new
07:15 - integer array and I will pass those
07:18 - values here itself let's suppose I will
07:21 - pass 20
07:23 - comma 30
07:25 - 35
07:28 - comma minus 15
07:31 - okay comma minus 60
07:36 - comma minus 100 okay so these are the
07:40 - value just random numbers I have passed
07:42 - to the array and I have to calculate to
07:45 - calculate the average we have to
07:46 - calculate uh sum of the elements which
07:48 - are present inside the array first okay
07:50 - so for that I will require one variable
07:52 - known as sum I will assign it value as 0
07:54 - initially
07:56 - and after that I will require one for
07:58 - Loop to calculate the sum of the
08:00 - elements which are present inside the
08:01 - array
08:02 - int I is equals to 0
08:06 - now I it's less than numbers
08:11 - Dot
08:13 - numbers dot length
08:15 - numbers dot length methods will return
08:17 - the length of the array
08:20 - okay and now each time I will be doing I
08:23 - plus plus
08:25 - okay why am I getting error yeah yes I
08:29 - have written this okay now it's okay uh
08:33 - what we are supposed to do inside this
08:35 - is update the sums value okay so
08:38 - previous Value Plus the value of
08:44 - of the current
08:46 - element present inside the array okay
08:49 - now it's okay we have got the sum of the
08:53 - elements which are better inside the
08:54 - array now we just have to calculate uh
08:58 - average so to calculate the average and
09:00 - again
09:01 - declare when I have double average
09:03 - variable of type double and I will
09:07 - simply divide this sum by the numbers
09:12 - dot length
09:14 - okay
09:15 - and now I can simply print
09:22 - the
09:28 - AV
09:31 - average
09:35 - of the
09:38 - area
09:40 - elements are
09:43 - and now I will concat it with
09:47 - average and now if I
09:51 - run this I should get the average
09:54 - averages 4.
09:58 - okay now it's okay and working fine if
10:01 - you calculate the summation of 20 plus
10:05 - 30 plus 30 35 plus minus 16 plus 60
10:08 - minus
10:10 - 100 and it when you divide it with the
10:13 - number of elements that is one two three
10:15 - four five six then you should get four
10:18 - as a output
10:20 - that is the average of the array array
10:23 - elements okay so these are some
10:25 - questions again I suggest you that you
10:28 - go to the Geeks for gigs or any of the
10:32 - practice portal uh like hacker rank or
10:34 - hacker you just go there and apply the
10:37 - filter of arrays and set the difficulty
10:39 - level to easy and try to attempt those
10:42 - questions try to solve this question it
10:44 - will help you to improve your logic
10:47 - building
10:48 - in problem solving okay so thank you
10:51 - guys for watching this video
