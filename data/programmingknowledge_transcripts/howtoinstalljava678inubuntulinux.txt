01:34 - jdk source is not installed and all the
01:38 - Java libraries or open jdk libraries are
01:42 - not installed you can see here not
01:44 - installed not installed so Java is not
01:48 - installed in my system it's just
01:50 - matching all the uh entries related to
01:54 - open jdk and it's showing that nothing
01:57 - is right now installed in my system
02:00 - so now I will try to
02:03 - install Java in my system okay so I will

04:22 - install space Oracle minus Java 8 minus
04:27 - installer so this Java 8 stand for the
04:31 - version you are
04:32 - installing if you write here Java 7 then
04:36 - it will install jdk7 to your system or
04:40 - if you can you write here Java 6 then it

06:49 - okay and to confirm this you can once
06:52 - again give this command to check whether
06:56 - it's already there or not so just once
06:59 - again give Pudo app minus get Purge open

08:25 - the same way you can also install Java 7
08:29 - in instead of the Java 6 instead of java
08:32 - 7 but by changing this

08:57 - Java 6 and once once you have you are
09:00 - done with all this installation you just
