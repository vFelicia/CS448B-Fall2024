00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can download and install
00:04 - MongoDB on your Windows 10 operating
00:06 - system MongoDB is a free and open-source
00:11 - cross-platform document-oriented
00:14 - database it is also classified as a no
00:18 - SQL database program so let's see how we
00:22 - can install MongoDB on our Windows 10
00:25 - operating system so first of all open
00:27 - your favorite browser and search for
00:30 - MongoDB and the first link which will
00:32 - appear here will be from www.movinon.com
00:46 - this button now once this MongoDB
00:49 - download center page is open you will be
00:51 - able to see different options here the
00:53 - one we want to download and install is
00:56 - the community server so just click on
00:59 - the community server and then select
01:02 - windows and you will be able to see only
01:04 - one option here which is windows 64-bit
01:07 - x64 and just click on this Downloads
01:11 - button which is going to start the
01:13 - download of this MongoDB MSI file so
01:18 - once the download of this MSI file is
01:20 - complete I'm going to click on this MSI
01:22 - file and I'm going to minimize the
01:24 - browser so now you will see this
01:26 - installation wizard so first you just
01:29 - need to click Next and then you need to
01:31 - accept the license terms and conditions
01:33 - and then click Next and on this next
01:35 - window you will see two options one is
01:38 - complete and other is custom we are
01:40 - going to use the complete option so we
01:43 - are going to install the complete
01:44 - version of MongoDB with the extra
01:47 - features and on the next window you will
01:50 - see this option which says install
01:53 - MongoDB as a service so I'm going to
01:55 - leave this as default which says run
01:58 - service as Network service user and it's
02:01 - also going to create two directories one
02:04 - is the data directory and other is the
02:07 - log directory at the locations specified
02:11 - here in these boxes so I
02:13 - don't want to change anything I will
02:15 - leave everything as default and click
02:17 - Next and this next window will ask you
02:19 - if you want to install a MongoDB compass
02:22 - which is official graphical user
02:24 - interface for MongoDB so I will just
02:28 - leave this checkbox as checked and I'm
02:30 - going to click Next so now the
02:32 - installation of MongoDB has been started
02:34 - so I will wait for the installation to
02:36 - complete and after the installation of
02:38 - MongoDB is successfully finished you
02:40 - will see this window it says completed
02:42 - the MongoDB and it will ask you to click
02:45 - the finish button so I'm going to click
02:47 - the finish button
02:48 - now once the MongoDB is installed on our
02:50 - Windows operating system I'm going to go
02:52 - to the location where MongoDB is
02:54 - installed so just go to your C directory
02:57 - and then Program Files and you will be
03:00 - able to see this MongoDB folder here and
03:02 - then click on server and then click on
03:05 - whatever version of MongoDB you have
03:07 - installed there will be a folder created
03:10 - with that version name so I'm going to
03:12 - click on this version name and then you
03:15 - will be able to see all these files and
03:17 - folders here so now click on the bin
03:19 - folder and here you will find all the
03:22 - MongoDB related executable files
03:26 - so to start MongoDB you need to run this
03:28 - file which is D and in order to
03:31 - open the MongoDB client you need to run
03:34 - this file which is so I will just
03:37 - copy this part here so in order to run
03:40 - the D command I am going to start
03:42 - the command prompt so just right-click
03:45 - on this windows icon and then choose
03:48 - command prompt which is going to start
03:50 - the command prompt and then I'm going to
03:53 - CD to the folder where this D and
03:56 -  files are there so CD and paste
04:01 - the part you have copied for this bin
04:04 - folder and then I'm going to press Enter
04:06 - so inside this bin folder all these
04:09 - files are located right so we are now
04:13 - inside this bin folder and here you just
04:16 - need to run this de command so
04:20 - just run D and then press Enter
04:22 - which is going to start the MongoDB
04:25 - server but after
04:27 - the starting of MongoDB server it's
04:29 - going to give you this error which says
04:31 - that there is a special directory
04:34 - required which is undersea data and DB
04:38 - which is not found so we need to create
04:41 - this data directory and inside this data
04:44 - directory we need to create the DB
04:45 - directory in order to run this D
04:48 - command so we are going to create this
04:51 - directory so I will go to the C
04:53 - directory and here I will create a new
04:56 - directory with the name data so let's
04:59 - create this directory and inside this
05:02 - data directory I am going to create a
05:04 - new directory with the name DB so just
05:07 - create the new directory with the name
05:09 - DB now this folder path is existing on
05:14 - my Windows operating system so once
05:17 - again I'm going to run this D
05:19 - command and then once you run this
05:22 - D command it's not going to give you any
05:25 - problem and you can see demon has
05:28 - been started so once this daemon
05:32 - is started I'm going to open the next
05:34 - terminal so right click on this Windows
05:36 - icon and then click on command prompt
05:39 - and once again I am going to CD to the
05:43 - directory where my and D
05:46 - executable files are there so once again
05:49 - CD to the bin directory of MongoDB and
05:52 - now I will run the command so just
05:55 - give this command which is and
05:57 - then press ENTER which is going to open
05:59 - the shell so you can see here at
06:02 - the bottom this shell is open I'm
06:05 - going to just minimize this so you will
06:06 - be able to see this here and let me just
06:10 - minimize this folder Explorer so in
06:12 - order to show all the databases which
06:14 - are already there you just give this
06:16 - command show DB's which is going to show
06:19 - you all the default databases which are
06:22 - already existing inside your MongoDB now
06:27 - let me just increase the font size of
06:29 - this terminal so you will be able to see
06:31 - all the commands clearly let me change
06:34 - it to 20 font size and now in order to
06:37 - create a new database using ma
06:40 - go DB you use this command use and the
06:43 - name of your database so let's say I
06:45 - want to create a database called my Lib
06:49 - so just give the name of your database
06:51 - after use and this is going to create
06:54 - this database but still when you give
06:58 - the show DBS command it's going to only
07:01 - show you the old databases and not the
07:04 - new one this is because you need to
07:07 - insert some data into your database in
07:10 - order to see it using the show DBS
07:13 - command so in order to insert some data
07:16 - you just need to give this command we
07:19 - have already switched to this my Lib
07:22 - database using this use my lib command
07:25 - and now you just need to give this
07:27 - command DB dot the name of your
07:30 - collection let's say my collection name
07:32 - is books and then dot insert and give
07:37 - the parentheses and inside the
07:38 - parentheses you give the curly brackets
07:41 - and you give your values as Jason's so
07:45 - inside the curly brackets you just need
07:47 - to provide that key name so let's say
07:50 - the key name is name and then colon so
07:54 - the value I'm going to give here is
07:56 - MongoDB book let's say and then I'm
07:59 - going to press Enter which is going to
08:01 - create this collection and insert this
08:05 - document into your collection and once
08:08 - again when you give this show DBS
08:10 - command you will see our database is now
08:13 - listed here now in order to list out all
08:15 - the collections inside your database you
08:18 - just need to give this command which is
08:20 - show collections and then the semicolon
08:22 - and then press ENTER which is going to
08:24 - show all the collections which are
08:26 - present inside your database so we have
08:28 - only created one collection which is
08:30 - books inside our my Lib database that's
08:33 - why we see only one collection here now
08:36 - in order to see all the values which are
08:38 - present inside your collection you just
08:40 - need to give once again DB command and
08:43 - then the name of your collection so DB
08:46 - dot books and then give the find command
08:50 - in order to list all the
08:53 - equipments inside the collection and
08:55 - when you give this command you will see
08:57 - all the documents which are present
08:59 - inside your collection so this is how
09:01 - you can use this client so
09:03 - whenever you need to use the
09:06 - client you always need to start the
09:09 -  daemon on the other shell so let
09:13 - me just close these two shells and once
09:16 - these shells are closed let's say I want
09:20 - to open the command Trond once again and
09:22 - this time I want to run the D
09:24 - command from anywhere so let's say I
09:27 - give the mangodi command but it's going
09:30 - to give this error which says D is
09:33 - not recognized as an internal or
09:35 - external command so in order to
09:37 - recognize your de command or
09:41 - command from anywhere you need to set
09:44 - the environment variable for the
09:46 - DB so once again I'm going to go to the
09:49 - folder where I have the MongoDB
09:52 - installed so I'm going to go to the
09:55 - MongoDB server and the version and then
09:57 - the bin directory and then copy the part
10:00 - of this bin directory and once again
10:03 - right click on the windows icon and then
10:06 - click on the system option here and once
10:09 - the system window is open you just need
10:11 - to click advanced system settings and
10:13 - then click on environment variables and
10:16 - here you need to add the DB path
10:20 - to the path environment variable so
10:23 - under system variable you will find this
10:25 - variable name called path so just double
10:28 - click on it and then we are going to
10:30 - click on new and add the part of the
10:35 - binary directory of your MongoDB so just
10:39 - copy and paste the whole path for your
10:42 - MongoDB executable this is the same path
10:45 - which we have copied which is this one
10:47 - and once you have pasted this MongoDB
10:49 - path you can just click OK ok and ok and
10:54 - once you have done that you can just
10:57 - once again open the terminal so you need
11:00 - to close the terminal and open the
11:02 - command prompt once again and this time
11:05 - when you
11:06 - give the D command it's going to
11:09 - recognize this D command from
11:11 - anywhere wherever you are in your folder
11:16 - structure and once again I'm going to
11:18 - open the next command prompt and give
11:20 - the command in order to open the
11:23 -  shell and it will open also the
11:26 -  shell from anywhere wherever you
11:29 - want to open the client now if you
11:32 - remember when we ran the MongoDB
11:34 - installation wizard we have checked a
11:37 - checkbox which says run D as a
11:41 - service now for that to take effect you
11:45 - need to restart your Windows operating
11:47 - system and then when you restart your
11:50 - Windows operating system the D
11:52 - service will automatically start by
11:55 - itself and then you don't even need to
11:58 - run D in a different terminal you
12:01 - can directly open your terminal and give
12:03 - the command in order to connect to
12:05 - your server so let me just restart
12:08 - my Windows operating system and then we
12:11 - will check whether the D is
12:14 - running automatically or not so now I
12:17 - have restarted my Windows operating
12:19 - system and now I will open the command
12:22 - prompt once again by right-clicking on
12:24 - the windows icon and clicking on command
12:26 - prompt and once the command prompt is
12:28 - open I'm not going to give the D
12:31 - command in order to start D I will
12:34 - just give the command and then
12:37 - press Enter
12:38 - and you can see this client is
12:40 - connecting to the server without
12:43 - even running the mangodi command in the
12:47 - different terminal so now because
12:49 - D is running as a service on your
12:51 - Windows operating system you can
12:53 - directly use the command in order
12:56 - to connect to your server so this
12:58 - is how you can download and install
13:00 - MongoDB on your Windows 10 operating
13:02 - system I hope you have enjoyed this
13:05 - video and I will see you in the next
13:07 - video
13:17 - you
