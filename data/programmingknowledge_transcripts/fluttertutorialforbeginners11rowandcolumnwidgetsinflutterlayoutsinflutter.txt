00:00 - welcome to programming knowledge so in
00:03 - this video we are going to discuss about
00:05 - two very important widgets okay which
00:07 - are not the UI elements but are very
00:10 - essential while designing the look of
00:12 - the screen okay and the first one is
00:15 - column and the basic use of column is
00:17 - that we can give more than one widgets
00:20 - to column and they all appear in a
00:23 - column that is one after another okay so
00:25 - to use a column first I will remove this
00:27 - Center that I have over here and instead
00:30 - of that I will write column okay and it
00:33 - takes a children and which is you can
00:36 - see over here of type with jets okay so
00:39 - inside this we can give a list of
00:41 - widgets that we want to display on the
00:43 - screen okay as the body so the first one
00:47 - is a text okay so this is a text now
00:57 - along with text I also wanted to add a
01:00 - button so first I will give a comma and
01:03 - the next widget will be a button so to
01:06 - add a button in flutter we write flat
01:08 - button okay and it takes a parameter
01:11 - child as in what will be or a written or
01:15 - displayed on that button okay so for now
01:18 - I will just give a text and the text
01:21 - says press or just simple press okay and
01:26 - now you can see it has a yellow line
01:28 - below where it is written flat button
01:30 - and if you hover around it you can see
01:33 - the parameter on pressed is required
01:36 - that means this flag button requires the
01:39 - on pressed parameters and on pressed
01:42 - basically decides the functionality what
01:45 - will happen when this flat button is
01:47 - pressed okay and it takes a function it
01:50 - takes a function okay so you can define
01:53 - a function over here and then call it
01:55 - from here or what I will do is I will
01:57 - create anonymous function like this and
01:59 - so a since I don't want to do a lot of
02:03 - functionality I just print it in the
02:05 - console that the button is pressed so
02:07 - for that I will write print and then
02:11 - inside that pressed
02:14 - okay now when I will first format it and
02:19 - then I'll save it so I would be able to
02:21 - see two things on my screen the first is
02:24 - our text with rish of Kumar and after
02:27 - that I'll have a flat button which is
02:29 - calling press okay so just wait for a
02:32 - moment for the Singh to finish so once
02:36 - finished you can see I have a text
02:39 - called Rishi of Kumar and after that
02:41 - press so the background color of the
02:44 - button and the screen both are the same
02:47 - so we are not able to differentiate so I
02:50 - can add another property that this flat
02:53 - button provides and that is color okay
02:56 - so for color I told you there is a enum
02:58 - that is provided by flutter called
03:01 - colors and then I will just simply write
03:03 - read again format it and save it so over
03:09 - here you can see I have our text called
03:13 - riche of Kumar and below that I have a
03:14 - button press which has red background
03:17 - and if I press on it you can see I am
03:22 - getting over here presses presses okay
03:25 - so the text over here was presses in
03:27 - instead of pressed so I am getting the
03:29 - same in my console okay now I can also
03:32 - change that text color over here okay so
03:35 - for that I will just write text color
03:38 - and the color can be again colors dot
03:43 - white okay I will again save this so
03:48 - once done you can see my text is in
03:52 - white okay so I can keep on adding as
03:55 - many UI elements I want in this column
03:58 - okay so for instance I add another text
04:03 - okay and let's say this programming
04:11 - knowledge okay now if I again save this
04:16 - so below this flat button I'll get
04:19 - another text that says programming
04:22 - knowledge and the order which we in
04:24 - which we write the elements over here
04:26 - that will be the same order that we see
04:29 - on the screen okay that means for us to
04:31 - this text then this flat button and
04:33 - after that we'll have this text
04:35 - programming knowledge okay so now this
04:40 - is how we can add more than one elements
04:43 - in a column okay now suppose I don't
04:47 - want this column to be over here but
04:49 - instead I wanted to be inside the center
04:52 - okay so then we have a parameter that
04:55 - this column takes and that is called
04:58 - main axis alignment okay and for the
05:01 - column the main axis is the vertical
05:03 - axis and the it takes agent it also has
05:07 - an enum that is main axis alignment okay
05:10 - and then if you enter dot you can see
05:12 - all the options and as my task is to
05:15 - display on printer I'll just hit center
05:17 - and then if I save this I will be able
05:19 - to see it in the center so now you can
05:24 - see it is in the center now if you want
05:27 - you can also try different types of main
05:30 - axis alignment that is in this enum so I
05:33 - will again hit the dot and let's try end
05:35 - okay so now if I save this let's see
05:38 - what happens so you can see everything
05:43 - is at that Tech at the end that is the
05:47 - bottom okay and then similarly you can
05:49 - also try something called start that
05:52 - will go at the start okay then we have
05:57 - space around that means it will take all
05:59 - the space so you can see the entire
06:03 - height has been covered by three widgets
06:06 - and basically two texts and of button
06:10 - okay so this is called space around and
06:12 - then we also have space between so you
06:17 - can see the spaces are only between the
06:20 - elements okay that means
06:23 - below this programming knowledge we
06:25 - don't have any space and above this
06:27 - ratio of Kumar we don't have any space
06:29 - but the space is only between the
06:31 - elements okay so this is how we can live
06:35 - with the alignment of the columns for
06:38 - now I will make it Center okay and then
06:43 - comma so now that text will be in cent
06:46 - okay so now you can see the text is
06:48 - again in center but you can see it is
06:50 - only the vertical Center and not the
06:53 - horizontal Center okay so there are two
06:56 - ways to bring it in the exact center
06:59 - okay so as I told you the column has
07:02 - main axis alignment has vertical axis
07:05 - and the cross axis alignment is the
07:08 - horizontal axis so along with main axis
07:11 - alignment you also have a cross axis
07:14 - alignment and over there you can write
07:17 - cross axis alignment which is also an
07:19 - enum dot Center so then again it will be
07:22 - in the exact center and other way to do
07:27 - is to wrap this entire column by a
07:29 - center widget okay so you can do it
07:31 - manually by creating a center and in the
07:34 - place of child we will pass this whole
07:37 - column or easier method is to go to code
07:41 - preferences and keyboard shortcuts and
07:45 - in the shortcuts look for sent refracted
07:48 - okay so you will get a certain key
07:51 - binding for the refractor okay in my
07:53 - case it is control shift R so if I press
07:56 - control shift our I get the options our
07:59 - app with which a trap with center
08:01 - wrapped with column okay and similar to
08:04 - that so I just wrap with Center okay and
08:07 - you can see it automatically adds a
08:09 - center and the child becomes a column
08:12 - and now if I will save this I would be
08:14 - able to see the entire column in the
08:17 - center okay so here you go the
08:22 - everything is in the center okay so now
08:25 - similar to column do you also have a row
08:28 - okay so far to demonstrate that I will
08:31 - just copy all the children that I have
08:34 - over here
08:38 - and instead of a column okay I'll also
08:45 - need to remove this instead of a column
08:51 - I'll have a row okay so as you can
08:54 - understand by the name row adds one
08:57 - element after another towards the right
09:00 - means starting from left towards the
09:02 - right okay so in in place of children if
09:05 - I again pass all those things I will
09:07 - format it and save it so now I will be
09:10 - able to see all these three things one
09:12 - after another so now you can see we have
09:16 - a text over here and after that we have
09:20 - this button and then the programming
09:22 - knowledge text and if I again click on
09:24 - this press so the console is again
09:27 - logging presses means the functionality
09:29 - is fine and similarly over here also
09:33 - inside this row you have a main axis
09:35 - alignment and you know how to use it and
09:38 - across axis alignment okay and you can
09:41 - also wrap it with a center and it is
09:43 - already wrapped with a center so you can
09:46 - see it is already in the center
09:48 - according to the cross axis alignment
09:50 - because for the row the main axis
09:53 - alignment is the horizontal axis and the
09:55 - cross axis alignment is the vertical
09:58 - axis so as it is already inside Center
10:01 - the cross axis alignment is
10:02 - automatically Center okay and if I add
10:06 - main axis alignment main axis alignment
10:10 - as Center then it will be in the exact
10:13 - center of the screen and once we loaded
10:19 - we can see the row is in the center okay
10:23 - and so this is how we add more than one
10:27 - elements in the screen okay so this was
10:30 - for the tutorial thank you
