00:00 - now in this video we are going to learn
00:01 - about the most interesting command that
00:03 - is a union command okay so basically
00:04 - this command is used to get the
00:06 - information about your machine okay so
00:08 - basically we will use this command to
00:10 - get the information about this Ubuntu
00:12 - machine
00:12 - so uh we will basically start with this
00:14 - and we will use some of the flags or you
00:17 - can say options with this uh Union
00:19 - command to get the host name to get the
00:21 - kernel whatever the kernel is being used
00:23 - in this particular machine what is the
00:25 - name of the kernel and also you will get
00:27 - multiple information like operating
00:29 - system Hardware platform information
00:31 - machine information everything you will
00:33 - get to know in this particular video
00:35 - so uh let's start with the
00:37 - implementation part so here you name if
00:40 - you provide without any option if you
00:42 - will execute this command you will just
00:44 - get the uh like the name of the
00:47 - kernel name you will get okay so here
00:49 - you can see as we already know like in
00:52 - the installation video we have saw like
00:54 - uh the Ubuntu is based on the Linux
00:56 - kernel so that's why it is showing the
00:59 - Linux so but before starting uh the like
01:02 - going deep into the video I want to just
01:04 - give you the overview of what is the
01:06 - Linux kernel okay so all units connect
01:08 - basically you can say is the core of the
01:10 - operating system okay if there is an
01:11 - operating system the current will be the
01:13 - core of that operating system why
01:15 - because it creates an interface you can
01:17 - say or creates a connection between your
01:20 - Hardware
01:24 - and your software
01:27 - okay so basically uh kernel has all the
01:31 - control of your operating system if
01:33 - kernel fails then whole operating system
01:35 - will get failed you can say like that
01:37 - also so I hope that is a basic
01:40 - information is clear to you and we will
01:43 - see about kernel release what is Kernel
01:44 - release so uh let me tell you about the
01:46 - kernel release So currently this is
01:48 - nothing but whenever a new version is
01:50 - released of a kernel like if there is
01:52 - suppose a version is suppose 5.0.1 you
01:55 - can say like that then again new version
01:58 - is create release that is 5.0.2 so why
02:02 - this new version and why this new kernel
02:04 - release has been done because if there
02:06 - is some vulnerability or any bugs in the
02:09 - first kernel then that bug will get
02:10 - passed and then again new release will
02:13 - be
02:14 - done okay and you can release will be
02:17 - done okay so that is the concept
02:19 - basically current release so now we will
02:21 - see the uh
02:23 - kernel release so for this we basically
02:25 - use the hyphen R option so here you can
02:28 - see the now currently version and
02:31 - current release version of this machine
02:32 - is this 5.15.0
02:35 - 41 generic okay
02:38 - so in this way you can get the kernel
02:39 - release information now moving forward
02:41 - uh let me just show you this uh
02:44 - Linux like kernel name you can use a
02:47 - hyphen s option also to get the
02:51 - kernel name okay
02:53 - so uh like both will give you the same
02:56 - result like unim and unim hyphen s uh
02:59 - okay and now next moving forward uh if
03:03 - you want to get the host name of your
03:05 - computer like hostname is like that name
03:08 - which is used over the network you can
03:10 - say like that so if you you will do unim
03:13 - hyphen and then obviously you will get
03:15 - the hostname as in my case this is ayush
03:17 - virtualbox is the hostname
03:19 - and again next if you want to get
03:21 - information about your machine about
03:23 - your processor then you can use hyphen M
03:25 - for your machine
03:27 - U name hyphen M for your machine so like
03:30 - it is 64-bit you can say you can see
03:33 - here it is and next if you want to get
03:36 - information about your processor then
03:38 - it's also easy you can get using iPhone
03:40 - P option
03:42 - so same
03:44 - information is being displayed here like
03:46 - it is the basically the architecture
03:49 - okay so now next moving forward uh if
03:52 - you want to get a hardware platform all
03:54 - those things you will get the same I
03:56 - think yeah Hardware platform is the same
03:58 - 64-bit and to get the name of the
04:01 - operating system so obviously it is uh
04:04 - gnu Linux so links operating system it
04:07 - is Ubuntu so
04:10 - now again uh like there is also one uh
04:13 - super command you can say like super
04:15 - option that is hyphen a option which
04:17 - basically gives you all the result of
04:19 - these like you do you don't need to
04:21 - write this all to get if kernel release
04:24 - you you you don't need to uh
04:29 - anything you can use a simple command
04:31 - that is a u name
04:33 - hyphen a
04:36 - hit enter and here you will get the all
04:37 - the above information like Linux is the
04:39 - kernel name this is the host name this
04:42 - is the version and this is the uh what
04:46 - you can say I think this is uh your uh
04:50 - version name it maybe yeah it should be
04:53 - version name like hashtag Ubuntu SMP
04:57 - yeah it's a kernel version name it is
04:59 - and next is the date of creation or
05:01 - installation
05:03 - and next is your all the architecture
05:06 - processor architecture everything you
05:08 - can see and and at the last you can see
05:11 - the name of the operating system
05:13 - so I hope you liked it guys that was a
05:16 - very uh basic tutorial so that's all for
05:19 - today's video and if you have any
05:20 - queries then you can ask in the comment
05:22 - section so thank you
05:23 - for watching and we'll meet in the next
05:25 - video thank you thank you so much
