00:01 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Android app development for
00:04 - beginners and in this video we will see
00:06 - how to use radio buttons in our Android
00:09 - activity now last time we have seen how
00:11 - to use checkboxes and the basic
00:14 - difference between checkboxes and radio
00:16 - button is that whenever you want to
00:19 - allow the user to choose multiple
00:22 - options out of a list of options you
00:26 - generally use checkboxes but whenever
00:29 - you want to allow the user to choose
00:31 - only one option out of multiple options
00:34 - then you can use radio buttons for
00:37 - example we will take the uh you know
00:40 - example uh that we have taken last time
00:43 - that we want to allow the user to choose
00:46 - his or her uh favorite animal but this
00:49 - time we want the user or we want to
00:52 - allow the user to choose only one option
00:55 - out of multiple
00:57 - options and for that we are going to use
01:00 - radio buttons now let's uh take a look
01:04 - at some examples so that we can
01:07 - understand this concept uh in uh more
01:09 - details so I'm going to go to my pallet
01:12 - and there is a container uh here called
01:16 - a radio button container or radio Group
01:19 - which I'm going to drag and drop here
01:22 - now radio group is a container which we
01:25 - can use to group radio buttons and
01:29 - whatever radio buttons we put inside
01:31 - this radio group they are grouped
01:34 - together and the logic behind uh this
01:37 - grouping is in this group out of this
01:39 - group we will be only able to uh you
01:42 - know select only one option out of
01:46 - multiple radio buttons okay now I'm
01:49 - going to go to my uh pallet and take
01:52 - some radio buttons here
01:54 - one
01:56 - two and three radio buttons for three
01:59 - animals and I will take a
02:01 - button and then I'm going to change the
02:06 - I will put this button outside uh this
02:09 - uh outside this radio group and now I'm
02:13 - going to select my radio group and in
02:16 - here in the properties for uh layout
02:21 - width of this radio group I will uh
02:23 - change it to wrap content and height
02:27 - also wrap content so that it takes the
02:30 - space uh which it's uh you know it wants
02:34 - to take right not enough uh not much
02:37 - space now I'm going to change the name
02:40 - of these radio
02:52 - buttons now we can uh go to our main
02:57 - activity. Java file to write some code
03:00 - for these U for these radio buttons and
03:03 - this uh button so I will go to my main
03:07 - activity. Java file and in my main
03:09 - activity class I'm going to declare uh
03:12 - these variable which are uh three radio
03:16 - buttons and one button and one radio
03:20 - Group which is uh this radio group we
03:22 - have taken okay so I'm going to um add
03:27 - these
03:28 - uh uh
03:48 - variables so now we have declared our
03:52 - variables here now we are going to uh
03:55 - create a method so we will create a
03:59 - method
04:00 - whenever we call this method in oncreate
04:03 - so that it can listen to button click
04:06 - event so
04:09 - public
04:10 - void and
04:15 - on
04:18 - click listener for button okay so B
04:24 - button and this is not going to take any
04:28 - argument and inside uh this method what
04:32 - we are going to do is we are going to
04:34 - cast our radio group first okay so in
04:38 - here
04:40 - Radio G for radio group is equal
04:45 - to in the
04:48 - bracket radio group and we will find it
04:52 - by ID so find view by ID R
04:57 - do ID
05:00 - dot radio group right so the name of our
05:04 - radio group
05:09 - was I think we have't decided uh you
05:12 - know uh defined the ID of this uh radio
05:16 - group so if it's not defined just select
05:19 - your radio group or select here and go
05:22 - to the property called ID and give an ID
05:26 - to your radio group for example are
05:30 - G for radio group r g for
05:36 - animals so this is for uh this is the ID
05:40 - which is _ animal for the radio group
05:43 - okay and I'm going to copy this and go
05:47 - to here where I am casting my radio
05:50 - group and I will paste this ID here
05:54 - okay
05:56 - now I'm going to do the same for for uh
06:00 - other uh button
06:11 - so let's do one more thing uh before uh
06:15 - uh calling this set on click listener
06:17 - for button that let's uh declare only
06:21 - one variable for radio button because uh
06:25 - we are going to need only one radio
06:27 - button because we are going to you know
06:30 - allow the user to select only one uh
06:32 - radio button right so we don't uh
06:35 - require more variables for radio button
06:38 - okay and whatever radio button uh user
06:42 - select we are going to cast this to this
06:45 - radio
06:46 - B now uh we will uh set onclick listener
06:51 - for button so button submit which is our
06:55 - button
06:56 - dot
06:58 - on click click listener or set onclick
07:03 - listener so set onclick
07:07 - listener and in here we'll create a new
07:12 - onclick listener okay onclick
07:16 - listener and inside uh this uh
07:20 - onclick method what we are going to do
07:24 - is we will declare uh integer for uh uh
07:29 - deciding of for getting the ID from the
07:32 - group right so we will name it as
07:37 - selected ID is equal to and then we are
07:42 - going to take our radio group
07:45 - variable and then we will get the ID so
07:49 - get check radio button ID and then this
07:54 - radio or selected ID we will pass to our
07:59 - Radio b which is radio button variable
08:03 - right so Radio b is equal to we will
08:08 - cast it to radio
08:10 - button radio button and then we will
08:13 - find view by ID find view by ID and this
08:16 - ID we will get from radio button we can
08:19 - pass it here as an
08:21 - argument and now whatever uh you know
08:26 - button is selected on uh you know video
08:29 - button is selected we can get the text
08:32 - from this button and display okay so
08:35 - what we can do is we can call the toast
08:38 - dot make text
08:41 - text and in here we can call three
08:46 - arguments now you already know what are
08:49 - the arguments called right this and
08:52 - second is the text itself so we will
08:55 - take this radio
08:57 - button Dot
09:00 - get
09:02 - text do two string okay and third
09:09 - is toast dot length short for example
09:14 - and outside this um toast we will just
09:18 - show it all right so like this going to
09:23 - uh you know include this method in our
09:26 - on create uh method here so I will copy
09:30 - the name of the function or method and
09:33 - paste it here I will change it to German
09:38 - and paste it here and now we are going
09:41 - to run our application so run the
09:46 - application and here the application
09:49 - will appear so select your
09:54 - device and now it's going to appear
09:58 - here
10:00 - so now our application is running and
10:03 - whenever we select any item from here we
10:07 - will only be able to select one out of
10:10 - uh these items because uh remember we
10:13 - have enclosed these radio buttons inside
10:16 - the radio group and whenever you enclose
10:19 - uh these radio button inside the radio
10:22 - button you will only be able to select
10:24 - one radio button at a time okay and you
10:27 - can add multiple radio groups to group
10:31 - your radio buttons so you can add one
10:33 - more group for example choose your
10:36 - favorite um
10:38 - anything and you will be able to select
10:41 - only one out one item out of uh this
10:44 - radio group also okay so always group
10:47 - your radio button inside a radio group
10:50 - now for example I select this and click
10:52 - submit and it says dog for example I
10:56 - select cat and click submit it says cat
11:00 - and same it will say for cow right so in
11:04 - this way you can use radio buttons in
11:07 - your Android activity I hope you have
11:09 - enjoyed this video please rate comment
11:11 - and subscribe and bye for
11:13 - now
