00:01 - hello guys welcome once again in this
00:02 - video I will show you how to install
00:04 - Apache web server on your open to Linux
00:08 - operating system so let's get started
00:12 - first of all open your terminal and just
00:16 - type in here pseudo apt minus get update
00:20 - and press enter and it will update all
00:23 - the
00:24 - required uh repository if required in by
00:28 - Ubuntu
00:30 - so let's wait for the
00:41 - completion once your updates are
00:43 - complete I will clear my screen
00:46 - first and now I will give the
00:49 - command to install Apache web server so
00:53 - write on your terminal sud sudo apt
00:56 - minus get install Apache 2 and press
01:02 - enter and if you have the permission
01:05 - just write y here to allow it to install
01:11 - and it will start all installing Apache
01:15 - on your open to it'll take some
01:18 - time basically few minutes to install a
01:22 - Pache in your system so let's wait for
01:26 - that once the installation of aache is
01:30 - complete you will be able to see uh a
01:33 - message like okay here and you will be
01:37 - able to see that this web server is
01:42 - configured as
01:45 - 127.0
01:47 - 1.1 okay so let's try and see whether
01:51 - it's really working or not our web
01:54 - server so I will open my
01:58 - browser
02:04 - and in your browser just you just need
02:06 - to
02:08 - give
02:10 - uh command
02:12 - called Local
02:14 - Host which is the local host of your
02:18 - computer and if you are able to see that
02:22 - this uh uh writing or this
02:28 - um this mage message then it's installed
02:32 - Apache 2 is installed in your system but
02:35 - you still need to add some content right
02:38 - it's saying this or one more uh IP
02:43 - address you can use it with this is your
02:47 - Local Host IP address which is
02:50 - 127.0
02:52 - do 0
02:55 - do1 and it will still give you the
02:58 - message or one more more IP address you
03:00 - can uh use it with this browser and it
03:04 - will show the same result which is your
03:07 - IP address of your computer so I will
03:10 - clear my screen once again and once
03:13 - again I will write here
03:16 - ip
03:18 - config and press
03:21 - enter
03:26 - and oh that was a wrong command ip
03:29 - config we use it with Windows operating
03:33 - system and with uh
03:36 - our Linux operating system we use the
03:39 - command called if config right so I will
03:43 - delete ip config and I will write I of
03:46 - config and press enter and now you can
03:49 - see your IP address of your operating
03:54 - system which is
03:57 - 172 16.80 .
04:00 - 128 so I when I enter this IP address
04:05 - also it will show the same message so I
04:08 - will open the new tab here and I will
04:12 - write the IP address of my computer and
04:15 - by press enter and you still get the
04:19 - same message that means you can check it
04:23 - on local host or Local Host IP address
04:26 - or the IP address of your computer and
04:30 - it works now suppose you want to stop
04:35 - your uh your web server how can you stop
04:39 - it once again I will clear the screen
04:43 - and in here I will
04:47 - write pseudo and give a slash Etc SL
04:54 - init.d / Apache 2 so this is where or
04:59 - this is the path where your Apache 2 is
05:02 - uh residing in the folder and when you
05:06 - give any command with this path for
05:08 - example I will give stop and press enter
05:13 - it will
05:15 - say
05:18 - okay stopping web server Apache 2 so it
05:22 - has stopped our web server and let's
05:26 - check now our web server is working or
05:28 - not by going on the browser and just
05:32 - refreshing this Local Host web page once
05:35 - again and this time you will be able to
05:37 - see this message that means that our web
05:41 - server is no more working because we
05:43 - have already stopped the web server
05:45 - right so once if you want to start it
05:50 - just give this
05:55 - uh start
05:58 - command with your Apache
06:01 - 2 and when you press enter now it says
06:06 - starting web
06:07 - server Apache 2 so now when once again I
06:11 - reload my page I will be able to see
06:14 - this message so in this way you can
06:16 - start or stop your web server but there
06:20 - is one more command which can be useful
06:23 - and which is used generally is reload
06:28 - command so so you can just
06:32 - write this message Pudo and the path to
06:36 - the Apache web server which is ETC
06:39 - init.d Apache 2 and then
06:43 - write
06:46 - restart restart and when I press enter
06:50 - it says restarting web server so
06:53 - whenever you make any changes in your
06:56 - web page for example and you want to
06:59 - start your web server without stopping
07:02 - it then you need to give this command
07:06 - and your web server will keep on running
07:09 - it will just restart the web server once
07:12 - again right now suppose you are seeing
07:16 - the the default message which is
07:19 - generated by Apache folder Apache
07:23 - index.html so let's see where we can
07:25 - find this code or this HTML file on a on
07:30 - our open 2 operating
07:34 - system so this file you will be able to
07:37 - find in
07:39 - your so I will write Lis
07:43 - slw
07:44 - slash
07:46 - www and press enter and you will see
07:50 - here is a file called
07:53 - index.html which is the index file of
07:56 - your Apache web server so if I want to
08:00 - open this um file I will just write for
08:05 - example
08:07 - pseudo get
08:16 - it
08:18 - so get it this git is a a editor name
08:26 - you can use Nano or whm with this I'm
08:31 - using git Editor to edit my index.html
08:34 - file and I will write the name of my
08:38 - index.html so I'll write
08:44 - index. HTML right and I will press
08:52 - [Music]
08:54 - enter I should have given uh the path to
08:58 - the HTML file so I should give it give
09:03 - here SLV slash was SL
09:10 - www SL
09:12 - index.html because there are index.html
09:16 - resides right you have seen it from here
09:19 - and now when I give enters sign or enter
09:24 - command you will be able to see the HTML
09:27 - file here and now you can add edit your
09:29 - file from here okay
09:34 - so we have uh the body of our HTML file
09:39 - and we have some paragraphs
09:41 - which are exactly as this paragraph
09:45 - suppose you want to edit this uh file
09:49 - then what you need to do is just have
09:53 - some HTML code and edit this file with
09:58 - your HTML code for example I'm add
10:02 - adding a table of two columns here and I
10:07 - will press
10:08 - save and now I will restart my web
10:13 - server
10:14 - right or I don't need to restart let's
10:18 - try to refresh our local host and now
10:23 - you can see this table which I have
10:25 - entered or which I have edited in my
10:28 - HTML file
10:29 - so now using this HTML file you can show
10:34 - your web pages and website on your web
10:37 - server right so I hope you learn the
10:41 - basics of installing and using a par web
10:45 - server on your one to operating system
10:48 - and I hope you have learned something
