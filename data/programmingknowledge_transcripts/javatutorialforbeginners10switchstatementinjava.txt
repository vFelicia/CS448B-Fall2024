00:01 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Java programming for
00:04 - beginners in the last few videos we have
00:07 - been seeing how we can use if statement
00:10 - which are condition based statement in
00:13 - Java now in this video we will see other
00:17 - kind of uh conditional statement that
00:19 - are called switch statement in Java so
00:22 - whenever you have to make multiple you
00:25 - know uh condition checking then you can
00:29 - use switch
00:31 - statement you can uh use switch
00:35 - statement uh in place of if El statement
00:38 - also but generally we use a switch
00:41 - statement where you have multiple
00:44 - expression to check so let's take an
00:48 - example for example I have a data type
00:50 - called store a score which is integer
00:54 - and whose value is 90 so let's consider
00:58 - this is the score of something student
01:01 - so in uh Java let's first see how we can
01:06 - uh you know write switch statement it's
01:09 - uh simple you just need to write a
01:12 - keyword called switch and then comes the
01:15 - round bracket which evaluates the
01:17 - expression and then in curly braces you
01:20 - write some condition so Here Comes Your
01:24 - expression and this
01:27 - expression can be uh following so for
01:31 - example this expression can be a bite or
01:35 - can be a short value or integer or
01:38 - character value right so our value is
01:42 - integer so we can write or evaluate this
01:45 - score value and on the basis of this
01:48 - score value we can Define some cases
01:52 - inside our switch condition for example
01:55 - case uh 90 and then comes this colon and
02:01 - then you can execute
02:04 - your code so we want to print for
02:08 - example system do
02:14 - out dot print
02:20 - line and in here we will print for
02:26 - [Music]
02:28 - example
02:30 - very good this is uh on the basis of
02:33 - score so if the student scores
02:36 - 90 we will print the message very good
02:39 - and after this message will print we
02:43 - just want to break out of this uh switch
02:46 - statement so just
02:48 - write break not this one but this one
02:53 - and this
02:55 - semicolon so in this way you can uh
02:57 - Define multiple conditions in
03:01 - inide your switch statement once again I
03:05 - copied and pasted same statement but I
03:09 - can Define some other condition for
03:11 - example if it's 60 or if it's 40 then I
03:16 - will
03:17 - say the score is
03:21 - good and if it's 40 the score is
03:27 - okay and so So based on the
03:32 - score we are evaluating the score inside
03:36 - this switch statement and if the score
03:38 - is 90 we will print this one and we will
03:43 - break out of this switch statement so
03:46 - what this break does is it breaks out of
03:51 - the switch statement we will see uh when
03:55 - we uh run the
03:57 - example and if this condition or this
04:01 - condition where K score is 90 or 60 or
04:06 - 40 all these conditions are not met then
04:10 - we will Define a default condition which
04:14 - will catch all the other options other
04:17 - than the defined conditions and this is
04:21 - done by the
04:23 - keyword default okay and in this default
04:28 - we can Define
04:30 - that for example this condition is not
04:32 - defined or the grade is not defined for
04:37 - example we can write
04:41 - the grades are
04:46 - not defined something like this okay and
04:52 - then we can break out of the loop not
04:54 - the loop but the
04:56 - statement
04:58 - break okay so let's run the program and
05:02 - let's see what will be the
05:05 - output I will just compile the program
05:08 - and run it and it prints very good
05:12 - because we have defined integer whose
05:15 - values 90 and this uh variable we are
05:19 - evaluating with our switch statement and
05:23 - then your uh program or switch statement
05:26 - evaluates whether the case so case
05:30 - becomes if the score is 90 then it will
05:34 - execute this code whatever you write
05:37 - after this colon and before this be
05:40 - break uh keyword all the code whatever
05:44 - you write inside this will be executed
05:48 - okay and whenever this break is called
05:51 - it goes directly out of uh this switch
05:56 - statement so
05:58 - this condition know this case is not
06:00 - checked and this case is not checked and
06:03 - this case is also not checked so your
06:07 - switch statement waits for the condition
06:10 - to be true for example we just uh
06:15 - write 60 which is this case and run the
06:19 - program it prints good right or we
06:23 - Define some uh weird condition for
06:26 - example 33 which is not defined in
06:29 - either of these cases then the message
06:35 - is the grd are not defined so your
06:38 - um this code will be implemented so this
06:43 - is like an if condition in switch
06:45 - statement not else not if but the else
06:49 - condition in um if statement right so
06:53 - whenever these conditions are not met
06:56 - then the default condition is called
07:00 - right now there are um other ways of
07:04 - writing switch statement or there are
07:06 - some properties of switch statement for
07:09 - example you can
07:11 - Define case
07:14 - without the break statement like this so
07:20 - if you define case where score is equal
07:23 - to 100 and you don't uh give here break
07:27 - uh keyword see let's see what happens
07:31 - and in this case we will Define score is
07:34 - equal to 100 and we will run the
07:37 - program and it says very
07:40 - good and why this is happening is
07:44 - whenever you define something or some
07:47 - case without a break it goes to the
07:51 - evaluate the case it sees that score is
07:53 - equal to 100 which is okay and
07:56 - immediately it goes to the next case
07:59 - where case is equal to or score is equal
08:01 - to 90 and it prints the next case
08:07 - statement which is this one and then
08:10 - immediately it sees that break is called
08:12 - and then it breaks out of the switch
08:14 - statement so whenever you want to
08:17 - evaluate multiple condition and you want
08:21 - to print or you want to execute a same
08:24 - code you can Define multiple conditions
08:27 - like this without a break keyword for
08:31 - example
08:33 - 95 and you define 95 here also
08:38 - then it will print very good okay so
08:43 - it's evaluating three condition at a
08:46 - time and if the score is 100 or 95 or 90
08:53 - this statement will be true okay in the
08:56 - same way you can Define different case
09:00 - here also for example if score
09:03 - is 80 for example or 60 and let's define
09:08 - score is equal to
09:10 - 80
09:12 - then it will print good okay so you can
09:18 - check multiple conditions without you
09:21 - know adding the switch or without adding
09:24 - the break keyword to any case so in this
09:28 - way you can evaluate conditions using
09:32 - switch statement I hope you have enjoyed
