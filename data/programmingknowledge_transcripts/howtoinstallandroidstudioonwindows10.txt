00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can download and install
00:03 - Android studio on your Windows 10
00:06 - operating system so for installing
00:08 - Android studio on your Windows operating
00:10 - system you need to first have Java
00:13 - installed on your windows operating
00:16 - system so first we are going to see how
00:18 - to install java jdk on our Windows
00:20 - operating system and then we are going
00:22 - to see how we can install Android studio
00:24 - so let's get started
00:26 - we are going to just open our browser
00:28 - and search for java jdk and the first
00:31 - link which will appear here will be from
00:33 - oracle comm I'm going to provide the
00:36 - link in the description of this video
00:38 - also so just open the link which is from
00:41 - Oracle comm so once this website is open
00:46 - you can see at the time of making this
00:48 - video Java 14 is the latest version
00:52 - available and you can download it by
00:54 - just clicking on this JDK download link
00:57 - so I'm going to just click on JDK
01:00 - download we're just going to open this
01:03 - kind of webpage so here you need to just
01:06 - scroll down and locate the Windows
01:09 - operating system executable file so you
01:13 - can see Windows x64 installer we will
01:16 - choose this one and you can see this
01:19 - executable file we can download for Java
01:22 - 14 so just click on this link which is
01:26 - going to start the download of this
01:28 - executable file in between you will be
01:31 - asked to just check this checkbox and
01:34 - then click on this download button so
01:39 - once this executable file is downloaded
01:41 - I am going to just click on this file
01:43 - and now you can see that this
01:45 - installation wizard has been started so
01:47 - I'm going to just click on next here and
01:49 - this will be the location where your
01:52 - java jdk will be installed so if you
01:54 - don't have the good reason to change it
01:56 - just leave it as default and then click
01:58 - on next and then just wait for the
02:01 - installation to complete and after some
02:03 - time you will see this message which
02:05 - says Java SE development 14 point 0
02:08 - point 1 successfully installed that
02:11 - means Java is installed on
02:13 - Windows operating systems so I'm going
02:15 - to just close this window and let's see
02:19 - where Java is installed on our Windows
02:22 - operating system so just go to this PC
02:25 - and then click on local drive and then
02:28 - we are going to go to the Program Files
02:30 - and here you can see the job of folder
02:34 - so I'm going to go inside the Java
02:35 - folder and once you are inside the Java
02:38 - folder you will see the JDK directory
02:41 - here now in the newer version of Java
02:44 - JDK you will not see JRE folder here so
02:48 - JRE comes with the JDK bundle so you
02:51 - don't need to you know install it
02:55 - separately or do anything here so just
02:58 - go inside the JDK folder and now we are
03:01 - going to set the environment variable
03:03 - for our Java command to work with it
03:07 - so you need to go inside the bin folder
03:09 - for that and then just copy this path up
03:12 - to bin folder inside the Java so to set
03:15 - the environment variables you just need
03:18 - to search for environment variables and
03:22 - you will see this result here which says
03:24 - added the system environment variables
03:27 - so such few letters of environment and
03:30 - you will see this result so just click
03:32 - on this result which says added the
03:34 - system environment variables and then
03:37 - here you need to go to this section
03:40 - which says environment variables and now
03:42 - you can add the Java bin environment
03:46 - variable here so under system variable
03:48 - you will see this path variable so just
03:51 - select this and then click on add it and
03:54 - here you need to click on new and add
03:58 - this path which you have copied so this
04:01 - is the path up to bin which we have
04:03 - copied so you just need to click new and
04:05 - then paste this path so once you have
04:08 - added this just click on OK
04:10 - also some application requires Java home
04:13 - to be added into the environment
04:15 - variables so to add Java home in your
04:18 - environment variables you can just click
04:21 - on new under system variables so just
04:23 - click on new and then under variable
04:27 - name just write Java home in capital so
04:30 - Java underscore home all in capital and
04:34 - then the variable value will be the JDK
04:39 - folder path so you just need to go up to
04:41 - JDK folder you don't need to go inside
04:43 - the bin folder okay so up to JDK folder
04:47 - just copy this path and then just paste
04:50 - it as the variable value and then click
04:53 - OK this is going to add this Java home
04:56 - variable into your system variable once
05:00 - you are done with this just click on OK
05:03 - and then click on ok so this means that
05:07 - Java home variable and Java environment
05:09 - variable is added into your environment
05:12 - variables now what we are going to do is
05:15 - we are going to check whether Java
05:17 - command is working with our command
05:19 - prompt or not so just close any other
05:22 - command prompt which you have previously
05:24 - opened and then just open the command
05:27 - prompt once again so just write CMD and
05:30 - then just click on command prompt here
05:32 - and here we are going to check once
05:34 - again Java version command so I'm going
05:38 - to just write Java - version here and
05:42 - it's going to show the version of Java
05:45 - which you have installed so we have
05:46 - installed Java 14 point zero point 1 so
05:49 - it's going to show us this result you
05:51 - can also run the Java C command so java
05:55 - c - version and it's also going to show
05:59 - you the java c version so once you have
06:02 - installed java jdk on your windows
06:05 - operating system we are ready to install
06:08 - android studio on our windows operating
06:10 - system so for that just open your
06:13 - favorite browser once again and then
06:15 - search for android studio and you will
06:18 - see the first result here will be from

07:00 - operating system so make sure all the
07:03 - system requirements are met on your

11:08 - to do project from here and here you can
11:11 - choose between phone and tablet and
11:15 - where OS TV OS automotive and Android
11:20 - things so I'm going to select phone and
11:22 - tablet so I'm going to just select empty
11:24 - activity because we are going to just
11:26 - test our Android studio and then click
11:29 - on Next button here here at the top you
11:33 - can provide the name to your Android
11:35 - application for example I'm going to
11:38 - just provide my first Android
11:40 - application name as hello world here and
11:44 - then just leave package name as default
11:47 - you can also change the location where
11:49 - this project will be saved and also you
11:52 - can select the language in which you
11:54 - want to develop this Android app so for
11:57 - now I want to develop this Android app
12:00 - in Java so I will select Java from here
12:03 - and minimum SDK so you can see by
12:07 - default API 16 Android 4.1 jelly bean is
12:11 - selected you can select the newer
12:14 - version or the later version from here
12:17 - also and it also depends on how many
12:20 - percentage of Android device you are
12:22 - targeting so let's say I'm going to just
12:24 - select Android 5.0 it says that your app
12:27 - will run on approximately 94.1% of
12:31 - devices ok so here I'm going to just
12:34 - select API 16 Android 4.1 jelly bean and
12:40 - then click on finish which is going to
12:43 - start the Android studio for the first
12:46 - time so now as you can see it will take
12:48 - some time to load so just wait for some
12:51 - time so we will start from the right
12:54 - hand side you will see this window in
12:56 - which you can see what's new in the
12:58 - newer version of Android studio if you
13:00 - don't want to read it just minimize this
13:03 - option because our project is created
13:06 - here on the left side you can see the
13:09 - project view and here on the right side
13:12 - you can see the code for your project
13:15 - also you will be able to see the
13:17 - activity main dot XML file where you can
13:20 - design
13:21 - your Android app one more thing you will
13:24 - observe here is this bottom bar here and
13:27 - here you will see the Gradle is
13:30 - downloading some packages so you need to
13:32 - wait for those packages to be downloaded
13:35 - so just wait for this progress bar to
13:38 - reach to the hundred percent mark also
13:40 - you can click on terminal here which is
13:43 - going to show you the terminal or if you
13:45 - want to see the build then you can see
13:49 - the build status also here for your
13:52 - Android app so now as you can see the
13:55 - sync is finished so my build is
13:58 - successful and as you can see on the
14:01 - activity main.xml
14:02 - window I can see this design view or I
14:07 - can see the split view in which I can
14:10 - see the design and the code for that or
14:13 - I can see only code okay so you can
14:17 - choose between these three modes
14:19 - whatever you want to use so right now
14:22 - when I just maximize this design view or
14:27 - zoom it I can see there is one text
14:29 - message here which says hello world so
14:32 - when we are going to run our app it's
14:34 - going to show hello world message on the
14:36 - amp so now let's run this project so in
14:41 - order to run this project you need to
14:42 - select some device now right now you can
14:46 - see there is no device selected here so
14:48 - when you will run your app it will say
14:52 - that error running app no target device
14:56 - found so what you need to do is you just
14:58 - need to click on this no device here and
15:01 - then click on open a VD manager which is
15:06 - going to open this kind of window so
15:09 - here we are going to create a new
15:10 - virtual device so I'm going to just
15:12 - click on new virtual device and from
15:15 - here you can choose the device on which
15:18 - you want to test your Android app so all
15:22 - the device which you see here are from
15:24 - Google so here I'm going to select this
15:26 - pixel 3 device from here which is around
15:31 - five point four three inches and then
15:33 - I'm going to click on next button
15:35 - so here on the next window you can
15:36 - select a system image so you can see
15:39 - different release names and API levels
15:42 - so for now I'm going to choose this
15:45 - release name which is Oreo and the API
15:48 - level is 27 so just click on download
15:52 - link here and it's going to open this
15:55 - kind of license agreement window so just
15:58 - click on accept and then click on next
16:00 - we're just going to start the
16:02 - installation of the requested component
16:05 - so once the installation is finished
16:06 - just click on finish button so when I
16:09 - click on finish you can see when I
16:11 - select Oreo which I have downloaded on
16:13 - the right-hand side it says haxm is not
16:16 - installed so in order to install it you
16:19 - just need to click on this link which is
16:21 - given here it says install haxm and then
16:24 - leave everything is default which is 4gb
16:27 - in my case which is also recommended if
16:29 - you want to increase it you can increase
16:31 - it it's totally dependent on your
16:34 - operating system and then click on next
16:37 - and click on yes and now I can see that
16:40 - Android SDK is up to date running intel
16:43 - haxm installer and then intel haxm
16:47 - update is successfully and done so click
16:49 - on finish now and once again click on
16:51 - next now I can see that I can choose
16:54 - from these two modes one is Pro trade
16:57 - and other is landscape so I will leave
17:00 - everything as default here and then
17:02 - click on finish so now I have this
17:06 - virtual machine which I have created
17:08 - recently right so now as you can see I
17:11 - have created one more device which is
17:13 - Nexus 5 API also just for the
17:16 - demonstration so in this way you can
17:18 - create multiple virtual devices here and
17:21 - then once you close it you will be able
17:24 - to select between those virtual devices
17:27 - so after that you can just select one of
17:30 - the device and then click on this run
17:33 - app button which is going to run your
17:35 - app and show you the app in the virtual
17:39 - device so this is how you can download
17:41 - and install Android studio on your
17:44 - Windows 10 operating system I hope
17:46 - you've enjoyed this video and I will
17:48 - you in the next video
