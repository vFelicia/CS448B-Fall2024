01:01 - like all the four files have been
01:03 - created okay now what I have to do uh I
01:07 - will tell you about the RM command okay
01:10 - so basically
01:12 - uh RM command is used to remove the
01:15 - directory how we can uh sorry denote
01:17 - directors files also okay not only
01:20 - directors okay
01:21 - so what we will do uh we will try to
01:24 - remove the one dot txt okay so how I can

02:09 - okay
02:10 - so uh like this is how tedious work like
02:13 - when you will remove one by one one by
02:14 - one so if you want to remove many files
02:18 - like at one time okay so how you can do
02:21 - it
02:22 - so again I will need to just create all
02:25 - those texts so I created a photo of four
02:29 - txt files now what I have to do I will

02:35 - then 2 then 3 then 4.
02:39 - I will just hit enter
02:42 - and LS all file that's gone okay nothing
02:47 - is there so all file has been deleted
02:49 - now so now let me tell you about the sum
02:52 - of the options which you can use with
02:54 - this RM command like iPhone F iPhone I
02:58 - also Capital IV all these things I will
03:01 - tell you okay
03:02 - so again let me get those files okay now
03:06 - files has been created here
03:07 - now I will show you
03:09 - RM hyphen I option small I
03:14 - uh what it will like do what so
03:18 - basically it just prompts you for the
03:21 - like confirmation like whether you want
03:24 - to delete this file or Not by sometime
03:26 - what happens you by mistake like delete
03:29 - some of the files you don't get any
03:31 - prompt and all so with this option you
03:34 - will get prompt okay so I will just hit
03:36 - enter and here you will see remove
03:38 - regular empty file you have to do yes or
03:40 - no if I will do yes
03:43 - it will get
03:46 - deleted I will just hit enter LS and
03:49 - then see one.txt has been deleted what
03:53 - if I do n
03:55 - let's do for 2.xt and
03:59 - so obviously this file will not be
04:01 - deleted
04:03 - so true dot dxt is at as it is okay
04:06 - so this is about a hyphen I like a small
04:09 - I width which you will get uh prompt
04:13 - about whether you want to delete or not
04:15 - some files okay but you will think about
04:17 - in this case you we were deleting like
04:20 - all these four text files like in a one
04:24 - single command okay
04:27 - but we were so how we can get uh prompt
04:31 - for this so there is also option for it
04:33 - okay
04:35 - so uh let me first remove all these
04:37 - files
04:40 - 3.xt4.xt okay LS there is no files
04:44 - and again I will just try to create
04:46 - those four files okay now uh there is
04:50 - also one option like hyphen capital i
04:53 - okay what it does when you will go to
04:57 - demo more than three files it will ask
04:59 - you for the confirmation whether you
05:02 - want to delete all those files at once
05:04 - okay or not but it will ask only once
05:08 - okay so how we can do it touch you
05:11 - not sorry one dot txt two dot txt3.txt
05:15 - four dot St here you can see we have
05:19 - how many files four files
05:22 - I will hit enter
05:23 - and again here you will see remove do
05:25 - you want to remove four arguments if you
05:27 - will do yes why then obviously
05:31 - it will be delete and now we will do LS
05:34 - so here you will see there is no any
05:36 - files okay
05:38 - all files has been deleted okay
05:41 - there is also more options like hyphen V
05:45 - okay what it does sorry
05:50 - if I will go with hyphen V option we can
05:54 - like combinely use more than two options
05:57 - together so hyphen we what it does it
05:58 - will show you what is being done okay
06:01 - so let's hit enter I will
06:05 - say yes and here you will see what
06:08 - happened removed one.txt then two dot
06:11 - txt then three then four okay
06:14 - sorry
06:17 - so these are the four files which have
06:20 - been deleted and you have got the
06:22 - information like what was going on after
06:24 - the like hitting this particular command
06:26 - Okay so hyphen we have some only just
06:29 - displays the what is going on okay
06:32 - and now let's move towards like uh
06:35 - directories okay how we can delete uh
06:39 - empty directories or uh like non-empted
06:42 - directory so let me create One Directory
06:45 - hyphen P I will choose with the
06:50 - uh A1 A2
06:53 - A3
06:54 - okay so uh like
06:59 - are you uh you will get like in A1
07:02 - director there will be two in A2 there
07:04 - will be a three directory okay
07:06 - so I will do LS and uh if you want to go
07:09 - in the A1 directory
07:11 - so when you will do LSI you will get the
07:14 - A2 direct okay so in similar way in A2
07:16 - there is A3 now I'll go in the home
07:18 - directory I will clear the screen
07:21 - now I want to remove this particular
07:23 - directory to remove directories which is
07:25 - non-empty like in A1 there is something
07:27 - okay so for this we basically use the r
07:32 - option with r we can use f of f option
07:35 - for Force fully deleting okay but we are
07:38 - not using here it okay
07:41 - so I will just go with the A1 and I will
07:44 - hit enter and all the directors will get
07:46 - deleted okay if I do LS so that you will
07:49 - see there is no A1 now what I will do I
07:52 - will just create again those directories
07:55 - and uh I will run with the iPhone V
07:59 - option
08:00 - okay and here we will see remove
08:02 - directory first A3 then A2 then A1
08:07 - okay uh if you want to use hyphen I
08:11 - option then also you can use
08:13 - a small I
08:15 - it will ask you yes then it will ask you
08:19 - for the next you yes then next you have
08:23 - to do yes so remove directory A1 A2 A2
08:27 - then again y then again for the final
08:30 - one so in this way uh like uh we can use
08:35 - the RM command with the iPhone v i r and
08:39 - these are all options okay now if you
08:42 - want to delete uh like um
08:48 - empty directory
08:49 - okay so this is a empty okay there is
08:52 - nothing into S 0 0 you can also do with
08:55 - r option but there is also one more like
08:59 - uh what you can say flag or option is D
09:02 - which basically is the empty directories
09:05 - May loot as 0 0 and it will edit the
09:09 - okay
09:10 - so this user has been deleted now uh
09:14 - again I will show you with the hyphen V
09:16 - option
09:17 - so you can get the like confirmation or
09:20 - there should be no any confusion
09:21 - regarding things okay
09:23 - so hyphen V and yeah remove directly
09:26 - test zero zero okay so uh that's all for
09:29 - today and I hope you liked it about this
09:32 - like how we can remove files and
09:34 - directories with the RM command as this
09:36 - is a basic class command okay
