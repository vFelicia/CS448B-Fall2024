00:00 - however this valuation now in this
00:01 - particular video we are going to learn
00:03 - about the who is command ok so basically
00:05 - this is the command line utility of one
00:07 - of the GUI based tool that is a who is
00:09 - lookup okay so basically we use this
00:11 - particular command to find the
00:14 - information about a particular domain
00:16 - name as for example google.com
00:18 - or the IP address
00:21 - okay
00:23 - so this is the basically command which
00:25 - we will use and let's see what kind of
00:28 - information we can get about one
00:30 - particular domain name or particular IP
00:32 - address okay
00:33 - so first of all let me find the IP
00:35 - address of google.com
00:37 - okay so here I'm getting this one I will
00:40 - just copy it how I can do it just Ctrl
00:43 - shift and C
00:45 - I will just now hit Ctrl C to
00:49 - to stop this ping command okay now who
00:52 - is okay so now you will see this command
00:56 - is not found why not found because it's
00:58 - not installed in our system that so it's
01:00 - not found okay
01:01 - so just copy it okay
01:04 - paste it this is the APT install who is
01:07 - this is a command to install any package
01:09 - you want
01:12 - okay let it install
01:15 - okay done done yeah
01:20 - okay I think now it's done it will take
01:24 - some time this way okay now done
01:26 - let me clear the screen let me again
01:28 - type who is okay yeah uh yeah I can do
01:31 - like
01:33 - I am able to learn to run this command
01:34 - okay now
01:35 - so here you can see there are many flags
01:38 - available to use this command that is a
01:41 - host Port I for query who is ina.org and
01:45 - follows its referral okay
01:47 - so now what we will do let's hit this
01:51 - one who is and first let's check for DNS
01:54 - only like for domain names okay
01:57 - so now here you can see multiple
01:59 - information about this domain google.com
02:01 - let me clear this screen and again let
02:03 - me show you the whole
02:06 - information about google.com
02:09 - so here you can see the domain name is
02:11 - google.com their ID is this who which
02:15 - server is this their URL is this like
02:18 - from where they have registered or what
02:20 - register URL
02:22 - and updated date you can see it's 9 9
02:25 - 2019 expiry date is 49.28
02:30 - okay so name server is this one
02:33 - ns1.google.com minus two and so on
02:36 - and moving forward
02:38 - and here you can see the
02:41 - creation date all those things okay
02:45 - and admin organization who is the admin
02:49 - of this particular domain that is Google
02:50 - aliens is the admin as we all know
02:53 - country us yeah we know it
02:56 - and sometimes we don't get this email
02:59 - because suppose you buy a domain name
03:01 - from godaddy.com okay so they take some
03:04 - some fees to you to keep your
03:06 - information safe
03:09 - okay so no one should access those
03:11 - information like your mail ID your
03:13 - password not password your phone number
03:15 - and all those things
03:17 - okay so in this way you can get the
03:20 - information about uh
03:23 - any particular domain name okay now let
03:26 - me again check with uh
03:29 - with the IP address whether I'm able to
03:31 - perform this not let me just copy this
03:33 - IP address again
03:35 - oh wait okay yeah
03:39 - 142.250 okay let me clear the screen
03:44 - who is and the particular IP address and
03:47 - we are done okay so here's the all the
03:50 - results
03:51 - so net range is this 142.250 dot not DOT
03:55 - not to this range okay so IP addresses
03:57 - can be between this Eid ad is this slash
04:00 - 15. so if you want to learn more about
04:02 - the idea I have actually uh write a blog
04:05 - on it you can search for it like
04:07 - subnetting infosec write-ups if you will
04:10 - search then you will get okay
04:12 - then Google parent all this information
04:15 - you can get okay
04:17 - so basically where you will think about
04:19 - where uh you need this particular
04:22 - command what is the use of this
04:23 - basically if you go in the testing field
04:25 - or penetration testing or cyber security
04:27 - field and then there is a phase of
04:29 - information gathering so in this
04:31 - particular phase we use it okay so
04:33 - that's why I'm telling you
04:35 - okay so uh
04:37 - let me search for some more information
04:40 - like of who is what are the things we
04:44 - can check here who is
04:47 - hyphen Q keyword description okay
04:54 - okay if you will use hyphenate to search
04:56 - for all the mirror databases
04:59 - b5p addresses with abuse contact okay
05:03 - show the email addresses
05:07 - okay uh let me try with hyphen B okay
05:10 - let's check what happens
05:13 - who is hyphen B google.com
05:19 - okay here you can see we are getting
05:21 - some kind of
05:23 - email address okay let me again uh
05:27 - like uh use this command and I will not
05:30 - use hyphen B option so so that we can uh
05:33 - get the difference okay
05:35 - so what was the command I had entered
05:37 - here
05:38 - who is hyphen B okay now I will just use
05:41 - who is
05:43 - google.com
05:46 - Okay so
05:51 - here you can see uh I think we are not
05:53 - getting any uh mail address here but
05:55 - here you can see
05:57 - admin email
05:58 - okay but here I am getting one address
06:01 - that is brjb someone's address it is
