01:24 - buttons and
01:26 - now what we can do is
01:30 - we can double click the these buttons
01:33 - and uh write the code but first of all
01:36 - you may have noticed when you have
01:38 - connected your uh uh form with your
01:41 - access database by dragging and dropping
01:44 - this data employee data or whatever
