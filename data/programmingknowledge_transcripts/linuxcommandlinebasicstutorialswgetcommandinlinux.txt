00:00 - particular video we are going to learn
00:01 - about the most interesting command that
00:03 - is the double gate command okay so
00:04 - basically we use this command to
00:06 - download files from the servers or from
00:09 - any website suppose in case if you want
00:11 - to download any kind of PNG or you want
00:13 - to download any kind of PDF or you can
00:17 - say uh
00:19 - also if you want to mirror the website
00:21 - it means you want to download the whole
00:23 - website their whole file that is htmlc
00:25 - is a JavaScript all those well if you
00:27 - want to download okay so in this case
00:29 - you can do all those operations using
00:32 - this single command that is a w get
00:34 - command okay
00:35 - so uh let's start now with the
00:37 - implementation part that is uh double
00:39 - get
00:41 - and the whatever the URL you want okay
00:44 - and just first I will give you the
00:46 - syntax so syntax is nothing but W gate
00:49 - options and whatever the URL uh you want
00:53 - to provide it can be a URL of any file
00:55 - or anything else okay
00:57 - so now moving forward uh what are the
01:00 - protocols that width command supports so
01:02 - it supports http
01:05 - https that is the high for text transfer
01:08 - protocol secure
01:10 - and FTP file transfer protocol so these
01:13 - are the some protocols which are used by
01:15 - the duplicate command so HTTP runs on
01:17 - Port 80 https runs on Port 443 and FTP
01:20 - on Port 21.
01:23 - okay now moving forward uh let me
01:25 - increase the font size 4 so that it
01:27 - should it should be visible to you guys
01:29 - okay now now what I will do I will try
01:33 - to search for image
01:34 - I have already searched I think okay
01:38 - so Linux PNG
01:43 - let me copy this image address or
01:49 - let me do here also I will choose
01:53 - this one image okay let's check
01:56 - let me check open image in new tribe
01:59 - okay
02:03 - um
02:05 - yeah this one is good
02:07 - copy image address
02:10 - and here duplicate and the oh my god
02:14 - let's let's see what happens let's see
02:16 - just
02:19 - file name is too long okay
02:22 - so let's take some another image uh
02:27 - okay let me search for
02:33 - from here I will choose okay
02:43 - okay
02:48 - I think this one should be no not this
02:51 - one
02:56 - open image in new tab
03:00 - okay
03:02 - copy image address
03:04 - now let's check
03:06 - so here right now I'm not providing any
03:08 - kind of options so it will just store my
03:10 - file in this current working directory
03:12 - but before I will just create a one
03:14 - directly W gate tutorial I will create
03:16 - okay
03:18 - I will move into that particular
03:20 - directory and I will again enter the
03:21 - command that is W get and the this one
03:25 - link
03:26 - so here you can see it is downloading my
03:28 - file okay now I will do LS and here you
03:30 - can see my file has been downloaded okay
03:33 - now to uh see the image file uh there is
03:37 - a separate command that is a fee but it
03:40 - is you need to install first you can do
03:42 - like sudo apt
03:44 - install fee
03:46 - I know I don't know the pronunciation of
03:48 - this command but it can it could be
03:50 - something like that so as you can see
03:53 - phase already newest version so now what
03:55 - I will do I will just say and the file
03:58 - name what it was I think L something
04:00 - yeah
04:01 - so you can see file has been downloaded
04:02 - okay cool now you can easily download
04:05 - the files uh it can be used in some kind
04:08 - of automation things okay if you want
04:10 - but manually we download files from our
04:13 - web web browser but in some cases we
04:15 - could we can use wget command also
04:19 - so now moving forward uh we will uh
04:24 - see the uh like uh what like here you
04:27 - can see uh the name of the file is so
04:30 - big
04:31 - okay if you want to uh like name it some
04:35 - different names okay I will then for
04:37 - that we use capital O that is hyphen
04:40 - capital O option
04:41 - and then we will use the new name that I
04:43 - will provide this Linux PNG image
04:47 - okay and the URL
04:52 - let's check
04:54 - okay I will do LS and here you can see
04:56 - Linux PNG image I have not added dot PNG
05:00 - let me add it first
05:04 - okay
05:07 - dot PNG oh sorry sorry sorry sorry
05:17 - PNG
05:18 - done
05:22 - okay let me do LS and now I will use
05:26 - Linux PNG not this one
05:30 - Linux image
05:32 - Linux what is the name it is Linux PNG
05:36 - image yeah okay so here you can see uh
05:40 - we have changed the name of the uh like
05:43 - file
05:44 - this so this like earlier it was a long
05:47 - string like the next pen doing Vector
05:50 - graphic pixel B all those things but now
05:53 - we can easily change the name of that
05:55 - particular file
05:58 - okay
06:00 - so moving forward uh you can use the
06:03 - different options like hyphen P option
06:05 - to uh like save the file in a particular
06:08 - directory in which you want so I will go
06:12 - just move back one directory and uh no
06:16 - let me
06:18 - PWD I will do and I will just copy the
06:20 - whole path here first
06:23 - okay if I'm not copy uh doesn't matter
06:25 - let's now I am in which directory I'm in
06:28 - this home I use directory okay now what
06:31 - I will do I will just like I want to
06:35 - CMI file in this particular directory
06:38 - okay but before that I will just remove
06:42 - those files
06:44 - uh
06:47 - PDW get
06:51 - RM iPhone audio star
06:53 - okay
06:54 - it's not destroy it's basically asterisk
06:57 - we say
06:58 - let me close this terminal
07:00 - now what you want to do you have to just
07:02 - to give the whole path of this
07:04 - particular
07:05 - like location
07:07 - so I will just provide this
07:10 - hyphen p and this one and the
07:16 - link so I will just copy this one link
07:21 - okay done it should be
07:25 - yes so now I will move back into this
07:28 - directory W get I'll do LS and here you
07:31 - can see the same image okay we have
07:34 - downloaded so using hyphen P option you
07:37 - can
07:38 - save your file into some another
07:42 - directory okay
07:45 - so now moving forward uh Suppose there
07:48 - is some conditions like if you are
07:50 - downloading multiple files or anything
07:52 - else and you have a limited bandwidth or
07:55 - limited internet connection or you can
07:57 - say limited net you have like these days
07:59 - we use 1.5 GB per days and all those
08:02 - things
08:03 - so in this case you want to limit your
08:05 - bandwidth or Internet like two like we
08:09 - we don't want to like w get to consume
08:12 - more amount of net
08:13 - okay
08:15 - so for this we use the uh hyphen hyphen
08:18 - limit hyphen rate option and we provide
08:20 - the what should be the minimum amount of
08:22 - the net
08:23 - used by this
08:27 - wget command so for this what we will do
08:30 - duplicate hyphen iPhone limit hyphen
08:33 - rate equal to one M1A means one may be 1
08:37 - MB and K means KB and all okay and the
08:41 - URL we will provide unless now or just
08:44 - uh
08:46 - use some different uh
08:48 - image
08:50 - or not this one here this one I was
08:52 - learning what how I can see the image
08:54 - okay and this is not necessary
08:57 - okay
09:00 - move back move back uh
09:04 - let's download this Spiderman
09:11 - Spiderman okay so this one is so like
09:17 - it's great image
09:19 - looking beautiful
09:22 - ah copy image address if I will do like
09:26 - it's on Splash image
09:29 - uh no I don't want this link let me open
09:32 - up this one
09:39 - open image in new tab
09:43 - okay
09:48 - uh if I will click on download free
09:53 - whether I will get some link or not if I
09:56 - will copy this one let's see what
09:58 - happens
09:59 - okay it's downloading now it means we
10:02 - have copied the
10:04 - correct link now what I will do I will
10:06 - just to paste the URL
10:09 - and we are done and also I will provide
10:13 - the iPhone option to change the file
10:16 - name
10:17 - iPhone capital O
10:20 - file name should be Spider-Man
10:25 - dot PNG enter
10:29 - okay I'm getting some kind of error
10:34 - let me to control CLS
10:39 - something cat look at log let's see
10:43 - what's going on
10:47 - okay saving a spiderman.png okay
10:52 - let me again run the program
10:54 - or you can use hyphen C option to uh
10:57 - what we can say to resume
11:00 - uh hyphen C I think it's uh
11:05 - small C let me check and again I will
11:08 - just
11:09 - open up some another terminal to check
11:12 - the W get lock file if I get the same
11:16 - error again
11:17 - c d w get URL LS
11:20 - and Trail hyphen f w bit log okay
11:25 - and let me just again run this command
11:30 - okay
11:34 - foreign
11:35 - log.1
11:43 - okay let me just Ctrl C and
11:46 - W get when it is I think
11:50 - LS uh
11:54 - jail iPhone okay
11:58 - connecting to onesplus.com so here you
12:01 - can see we can see the live uh whatever
12:04 - the background process going on you we
12:06 - can see this like this using tail
12:08 - command okay
12:10 - so w get comma W get log basically
12:12 - provides the log okay
12:14 - whatever it's going on
12:17 - okay so I don't think it is getting
12:21 - connected I'm getting some kind of error
12:23 - maybe it could be network error let me
12:25 - just
12:26 - close the connection
12:28 - I will use some different uh
12:31 - different image not for months plus
12:35 - okay Wikipedia is there let me open
12:38 - image in new tab
12:40 - I need a short link just
12:43 - okay just search for Linux only
12:48 - okay and this one let me check
12:54 - let me close all these sites
13:07 - okay let's move back I think it's taking
13:10 - so much time
13:13 - Open Image new tab
13:17 - no
13:22 - Linux PNG
13:33 - well here it's still opening man how
13:36 - much time it will take
13:37 - uh let me pause the video uh
13:42 - okay so I was getting a network error at
13:45 - that time uh now it has been resolved so
13:48 - here we can see uh like the log file of
13:50 - this one W get DOT log dot one okay so
13:53 - you can see the file is already fully
13:55 - retrieved okay so uh now I will just
13:59 - check again so here you can see the
14:01 - image I think it's too large to display
14:03 - here okay that's why we are not uh able
14:06 - to see it
14:08 - so in this case if you want to limit
14:10 - your bandwidth you can use the limit
14:12 - hyphen hyphen uh hyphen iPhone limit
14:15 - hyphen rate equal to whatever the uh
14:18 - amount you want to give like uh it could
14:21 - be 1 MB 1 KB or anything it's all
14:23 - depends upon you and your internet
14:25 - connection
14:27 - and similarly using hyphen C we just
14:29 - checked we can do Zoom any uh like uh
14:32 - any download which is not complete or if
14:35 - like similarly I just got the network
14:37 - error so I can resume using iPhone C
14:40 - option
14:42 - okay now moving forward uh if you want
14:46 - to download some file in the background
14:48 - process
14:49 - okay so in that time we use the hyphen B
14:53 - option that is this one hyphen B option
14:55 - we will use and also the W get log file
14:59 - will be created similarly like this like
15:01 - this one W get log and W get log.1 okay
15:06 - similarly this file will be generated
15:08 - and we can see the whatever the process
15:10 - going on and all those things
15:12 - so now moving forward I will just
15:14 - download one PDF I will just search for
15:17 - us
15:18 - uh file type this is Linux Google
15:22 - docking we call it if you use this kind
15:25 - of searches
15:26 - file type I will just type uh
15:31 - um let's type linux.pdf
15:36 - I hope my connection internet should
15:38 - work okay again I'm getting a ride on to
15:41 - let me pause the video
15:43 - okay now I'm done I'll now finally it's
15:45 - working let me just search for uh file
15:49 - type
15:51 - I will just use uh let's just search
15:54 - similar like this file type PDF
15:56 - uh colonizers let me write the file name
15:59 - also so that it could be easy
16:02 - so here you can see there is one PDF
16:05 - file introduction to Linux this one okay
16:08 - tldp.org this is some kind of
16:11 - I don't know which website is I will
16:13 - just copy this one
16:15 - move back to our terminal just LS remove
16:18 - everything whatever we have uh
16:21 - downloaded till now okay RM iPhone RF
16:23 - forcefully we removed everything clear
16:26 - the screen also W get hyphen B and the
16:30 - particular
16:32 - link or URL you can say so now in this
16:35 - case what will happen the log file will
16:37 - be created okay so I will just enter and
16:40 - what it's saying continuing in
16:42 - background P ID is this output will be
16:44 - written to W get hyphen log
16:46 - okay LS I will just use tail hyphen f w
16:51 - kit and here you can see all done we
16:55 - have finally downloaded this one I think
16:57 - let me do LS
17:00 - and
17:02 - let me go into the file section
17:05 - file system open
17:08 - tutorial okay
17:12 - here you can see the file so in the
17:16 - background process what happens
17:18 - uh the file all the process whatever
17:21 - going on is getting stored in this W get
17:23 - hyphen log file okay I hope it is clear
17:25 - to you so here you can see all the
17:28 - process like oh this is like how much
17:30 - bits of data and all those things the IP
17:33 - address from where it is resolving it is
17:35 - connected on which Port that is 443 that
17:37 - is the https
17:39 - and saving which file that is into
17:42 - linux.pdf file that's saving okay so I
17:45 - hope that is clear to you it should be
17:47 - clear to you
17:49 - okay so moving forward let me just close
17:52 - one this clear the screen
