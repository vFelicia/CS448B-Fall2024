00:00 - so those of you who don't know what
00:02 - VirtualBox is VirtualBox is a tool which
00:06 - will enable you to run different
00:08 - operating systems virtually on your host
00:12 - operating system so in this case my host
00:15 - operating system is Windows 10 and I
00:18 - have installed VirtualBox on my Windows
00:21 - 10 and then this VirtualBox will enable
00:24 - me to run different operating systems
00:27 - virtually on my Windows 10 operating
00:30 - system so Oracle VirtualBox is a free
00:33 - and open source host hypervisor for
00:37 - virtualization in other words VirtualBox
00:40 - allows you to install many operating
00:44 - systems virtually on your host operating
00:47 - system so let's say I want to install
00:50 - Ubuntu operating system virtually on my
00:53 - Windows operating system I can do that
00:56 - using VirtualBox so for installing
00:59 - VirtualBox just open your favorite
01:00 - browser and search for VirtualBox and
01:03 - the first link which will appear here
01:05 - will be from virtualbox.org G so we are
01:08 - going to just click on this link so once
01:11 - this website opens if you are not
01:13 - directly redirected to the downloads
01:16 - page you can click on this Downloads
01:18 - link and you will be able to see this
01:21 - kind of Downloads interface we want to
01:25 - download the VirtualBox for Windows so
01:28 - we are going to select windows host and
01:30 - once you click on that link you can see
01:34 - the download of this VirtualBox exe has
01:37 - been started which is around 1 0 8
01:40 - megabyte so once this executable file is
01:43 - downloaded I'm going to just click on
01:45 - this executable file and I'm going to
01:48 - just minimize the browser the first
01:51 - window looks like this so I'm going to
01:53 - just click on the next button here and
01:56 - this is the location where your
01:58 - VirtualBox will be installed so if you
02:01 - don't have the good reason to change
02:02 - this part just go ahead and click Next
02:05 - and just leave everything as default
02:09 - click Next and then click yes and then
02:12 - click install
02:14 - we're just going to start the process of
02:15 - installing the VirtualBox on your
02:17 - Windows operating system in between you
02:19 - will see these kind of messages which
02:21 - will ask you to install some device
02:24 - related software so I'm going to just
02:26 - click on install and then you can see a
02:32 - straightaway here this Oracle VirtualBox
02:35 - icon is created and after some time you
02:38 - will also see this message which says
02:40 - the installation of VirtualBox is
02:43 - complete and just leave this checkbox
02:46 - checked which is going to launch your
02:49 - VirtualBox after you close that window
02:52 - so this is how VirtualBox looks like you
02:56 - can close it and I'm going to once again
02:58 - open it using this icon so on VirtualBox
03:02 - you can create any virtual machine by
03:05 - just clicking on this new button here
03:07 - and you can see there are a different
03:10 - type of virtual machine you can create
03:13 - for example Windows Linux Solaris BSD
03:17 - IBM Mac OS and other so let's say I want
03:20 - to just install Ubuntu I will just type
03:23 - open to here and you can see this type
03:28 - is Linux and from here you can choose
03:30 - the version of Ubuntu you want to
03:32 - install so you can choose 32-bit or
03:34 - 64-bit and then go to the next step and
03:39 - then you can choose the other options
03:43 - like memory and the processors and other
03:47 - things right the most important thing
03:50 - you need to have or to install a virtual
03:52 - machine on your host operating system is
03:56 - the ISO file so you can download for
04:01 - example the Ubuntu desktop I also file
04:04 - from the Ubuntu website and then you can
04:08 - just use that ISO file to create open to
04:13 - virtual machine which will allow you to
04:15 - create open to virtual machine and work
04:18 - with Ubuntu on your Windows operating
04:20 - system how you can download and install
04:22 - Ubuntu 20 point zero 4 on your
04:26 - VirtualBox
04:27 - in your Windows 10 operating system so
04:30 - once you have installed VirtualBox on
04:33 - your Windows operating system it's going
04:35 - to look like this and whenever you open
04:38 - VirtualBox it's going to open Oracle VM
04:42 - VirtualBox manager now we are going to
04:45 - download the ISO file which is required
04:48 - to install Ubuntu on our VirtualBox
04:53 - so for downloading the ISO file of
04:56 - Ubuntu you can just search for Ubuntu
04:59 - and the first link which will appear
05:01 - here will be from Ubuntu calm so I'm
05:03 - going to just click on this link and
05:05 - straight away you will see this option
05:09 - here it says what's new in open to 2004
05:13 - because 2004 is the latest version of
05:18 - Ubuntu which is released recently so
05:21 - here you will see our downloads tab here
05:25 - and when you click on the download tab
05:28 - you will see the Ubuntu desktop so you
05:31 - can just click on the version which is
05:34 - available and most probably you might
05:37 - want to install the LTS version okay so
05:41 - make sure that whenever you install
05:43 - Ubuntu you install the LTS version LTS
05:47 - means the long-term support version
05:49 - which will at least run for two years
05:52 - okay so the support will run for two
05:55 - years so I'm going to just click on open
05:58 - to desktop and here you will see the
06:01 - download button so I'm going to just
06:03 - click on the download button and when
06:05 - you click on the download button the ISO
06:07 - file will be downloaded on your Windows
06:11 - operating system so this file is around
06:13 - 2.5 GB file so it will take some time to
06:16 - download but I have already downloaded
06:18 - this file on my Windows operating system
06:21 - so I'm going to just cancel this
06:22 - download and also if you want to support
06:26 - open to project then you can just give
06:30 - small donation to open - for now I don't
06:33 - want to do anything so I have just
06:35 - downloaded the ISO file so once you have
06:38 - downloaded the ISO file it's going to
06:40 - look like this
06:41 - in case you have downloaded the 2004
06:44 - version of Ubuntu so the name is open to
06:48 - - 2004 - desktop
06:52 - - AMD 64 dot ISO file so once you have
06:57 - downloaded this ISO file we are ready to
07:00 - install Ubuntu on our VirtualBox
07:02 - so on your VirtualBox you just need to
07:05 - click on the new button here and once
07:09 - you click on the new button here you can
07:11 - provide the name of your new machine so
07:15 - my new machine name is Ubuntu so I'm
07:18 - going to just write open to here and
07:19 - let's say I will also give the version
07:22 - of Ubuntu let's say 20 point 0 4 here
07:26 - and straight away VirtualBox is smart
07:30 - enough to provide you the proper options
07:32 - here ok
07:33 - so here you will see the machine folder
07:37 - where all the VirtualBox related files
07:40 - will be downloaded and saved on your
07:44 - Windows operating system and the type
07:47 - here is Linux because open to is a Linux
07:49 - based operating system and the version
07:53 - here is open to 64 bit because we have
07:56 - downloaded the 64-bit ISO file ok there
08:01 - is no other option on the website as far
08:04 - as I know if you want to choose any
08:08 - other operating system the procedure is
08:11 - same you just need to select the
08:14 - operating system you want to install and
08:18 - here you can see many choices are given
08:22 - here ok so type is Linux and the version
08:25 - is open to 64-bit and then click on next
08:28 - and here in the memory size I generally
08:32 - provide the memory up to the green mark
08:35 - so up to here whatever is allowed on my
08:40 - Windows operating system at this point
08:42 - and then I click on next here just leave
08:48 - everything as default so just leave it
08:50 - as default and then click on the create
08:53 - button now here hi
08:55 - desk file type just leave it as VDI
08:58 - which is VirtualBox disk image and then
09:01 - click on next and here also you just
09:05 - need to leave this as dynamically
09:07 - allocated if you want to learn more
09:10 - about what is dynamically allocated and
09:13 - fixed size you can read from here
09:15 - basically dynamically at located option
09:19 - will allow you're open to operating
09:21 - system to expand the disk size if
09:24 - required and fixed size is the fixed
09:27 - size so we want to allocate the space
09:31 - and disk size are dynamically that's why
09:35 - we have chosen this option here which is
09:37 - dynamically allocated and now click on
09:40 - next and on the next window you can
09:42 - choose the file location this will be
09:45 - the location where your Ubuntu operating
09:48 - system files will be downloaded and
09:52 - installed on your Windows operating
09:54 - systems so if you don't have the good
09:56 - reason to change it just leave it as
09:58 - default also you can choose the virtual
10:01 - hard disk size from here by default it's
10:05 - 10 GB selected here but let's say I
10:07 - would just want to increase it to 100 GB
10:12 - so I'm going to just move it around 100
10:15 - GB and then I'm going to just click on
10:17 - create ok so once you create this
10:20 - machine you will be able to see this new
10:24 - machine here which is open to 20 point 0
10:28 - 4 so just select this machine
10:30 - don't press on the start button yet you
10:34 - just need to select this open 2 machine
10:37 - which you have created and then click on
10:39 - the settings option so on the general
10:42 - settings you will see some options which
10:45 - we have already chosen at the time of
10:48 - creating this machine which is Linux and
10:51 - the version is Ubuntu 64-bit now click
10:55 - on advanced settings and then in the
10:57 - shared clipboard option you just need to
11:00 - choose it bi-directional and then drag
11:03 - and drop also bi-directional that will
11:06 - allow you to share your files we
11:09 - between your host machine which is
11:10 - Windows in my case and your virtual
11:14 - machine which will be open to
11:17 - bi-directionally so you will be able to
11:19 - copy and paste into your Ubuntu from
11:22 - your Windows operating system and vice
11:25 - versa
11:25 - ok so in the description you can give
11:28 - any description here and in the disk
11:31 - encryption you just leave it as default
11:34 - now I'm going to just go to the system
11:37 - option here and in the motherboard
11:41 - option you can leave everything as
11:44 - default you just need to go to the
11:47 - processors here and by default
11:49 - VirtualBox will allocate one CPU to your
11:52 - machine so if you have the option you
11:56 - can increase it to whatever CPU one you
12:00 - want to use so for the safer side I
12:03 - always go up to this green mark here ok
12:06 - which is for in my case you can increase
12:09 - the CPU size later also ok
12:12 - in the display settings just leave of
12:14 - everything as default and then move to
12:17 - the storage section here here you need
12:22 - to provide the location of your ISO file
12:24 - wherever you have downloaded your one
12:27 - two iso file so you just need to click
12:29 - on the empty option here so just click
12:32 - on empty under the controller so just
12:34 - choose the CD icon option here and then
12:38 - click on choose our disc file from here
12:40 - ok so just click on choose a disc file
12:42 - from here and then you just need to
12:45 - browse to the location where you have
12:47 - downloaded your Ubuntu ISO file so I'm
12:51 - going to just copy the location here and
12:53 - then paste it here and then select the
12:56 - ISO file from here and then click on
12:58 - open so once you have selected your ISO
13:01 - file using this CD icon you will see the
13:04 - name of your ISO file here also let me
13:07 - just move it further you can see the
13:10 - exact name of my ISO file here open to
13:14 - 20 of 0 for desktop MD 64 so once you
13:18 - have done that you can do other settings
13:20 - from here also but I will leave
13:21 - everything as default and click
13:23 - okay and once you have done all those
13:26 - settings you are ready to start your one
13:29 - to installation so here what I'm going
13:31 - to do is I'm going to select Ubuntu 20
13:33 - point zero 4 and click on start button
13:36 - here and you can see the installation of
13:41 - Ubuntu is going to start in a few
13:44 - seconds you can just close these warning
13:48 - signs here and now you will see this
13:51 - kind of window here so on the left hand
13:53 - side you can choose the language in
13:56 - which you want to install ubuntu you can
13:58 - see many languages are given here but
14:02 - for now I will choose English as my
14:06 - language and then I will click on the
14:08 - install Ubuntu a button here now in the
14:13 - next window you will see the keyboard
14:15 - layout so from here you can choose the
14:17 - keyboard layout whatever keyboard layout
14:20 - you are using on your laptop or on your
14:23 - keyboard so in my case I'm using a
14:27 - German keyboard so I can just move to
14:30 - the German keyboard option here so I'm
14:33 - going to just search for the German
14:35 - keyboard which is this one you can
14:37 - choose any other keyboard from here ok
14:40 - so I'm going to choose the German
14:41 - keyboard and then on the right hand side
14:45 - I will just choose German as the
14:48 - language here and then you can also test
14:52 - your keyboard by typing something in
14:54 - this box so just choose your keyboard
14:57 - language here and then click on continue
14:59 - button and here on this window you will
15:04 - see update and other software's so I
15:07 - normally just leave it as normal
15:11 - installation option checked and also I
15:14 - leave this option also checked which is
15:17 - download updates while installing Ubuntu
15:20 - also I'm going to just check this option
15:22 - also which is installed third-party
15:24 - software for graphics and Wi-Fi hardware
15:27 - and additional media formats so just
15:30 - check all the options which I have
15:32 - checked and then click on continue and
15:34 - here in the installation type
15:37 - leave this option as default which is
15:40 - erased disk and install Ubuntu so this
15:44 - is not going to erase anything because
15:47 - you are installing Ubuntu on your
15:51 - VirtualBox you are not installing Ubuntu
15:54 - on your hardware right so don't worry
15:59 - it's not going to erase any disk or
16:01 - anything from your Windows operating
16:04 - system just leave it as erase disk and
16:07 - install Ubuntu and then click on install
16:10 - now now here you will see this warning
16:13 - which says if you continue the changes
16:15 - listed below will be written I will just
16:18 - click on continue button here now in the
16:20 - next step you can choose the location
16:21 - which is nearer to your physical
16:25 - location so I have chosen this location
16:29 - which is nearer to my physical location
16:32 - and then I'm going to click on the
16:34 - continue button and here you can just
16:39 - give the name to your Ubuntu operating
16:42 - system for example I'm going to just
16:44 - write code bind here as the name and as
16:48 - the computer name here I can even remove
16:52 - the VirtualBox from the end because I
16:55 - just want to give the same name as the
16:58 - computer name also and also as the user
17:00 - name I will just leave it as code bind
17:04 - if you want to change these names or so
17:08 - let's say you want to give the different
17:10 - user name here you can do that also and
17:13 - then you can just provide the password
17:15 - I'm going to just provide the password
17:17 - for now it's a weak password but you
17:20 - might want to provide the stronger parts
17:23 - for than this and then you just need to
17:26 - confirm this password and once you are
17:30 - done with that you just need to click on
17:33 - the continue button and now the
17:37 - installation of Ubuntu will start on
17:40 - your VirtualBox so now at this step you
17:44 - don't need to do anything until open to
17:47 - is installed on
17:49 - you're VirtualBox so you just need to
17:51 - wait for some time until this
17:53 - installation is finished so I will also
17:56 - wait for the installation to be finished
17:59 - and after some time you will see this
18:04 - kind of window which says installation
18:06 - is complete you need to restart the
18:08 - computer in order to use the new
18:09 - installation so I'm going to just click
18:12 - on the restart Now button and at this
18:18 - point it says please remove the
18:20 - installation medium then press Enter so
18:23 - I'm going to just press ENTER here and
18:25 - now I can see the Ubuntu operating
18:26 - system is starting and now I can see
18:29 - this login window here so if you
18:32 - remember this is the user name which I
18:34 - have given to my Ubuntu operating system
18:36 - so I will just click on this user and
18:39 - then I will provide the password which I
18:41 - have given at the time of installation
18:44 - and then press Enter
18:45 - so first of all you will see this kind
18:47 - of welcome window here you can click on
18:49 - the Skip option here and also you can
18:53 - just click on the next next and next and
18:57 - then click on done and you will be able
19:00 - to see your Ubuntu desktop here right so
19:04 - when you just click on this maximize
19:08 - button now you will see that this
19:10 - desktop is not maximizing so for that we
19:14 - need to install a tool called VirtualBox
19:17 - guest additions so for installing the
19:21 - VirtualBox guest additions what you need
19:24 - to do is you need to open the terminal
19:27 - so you can just click on this option and
19:29 - then search for terminal here and once
19:34 - the terminal result comes you just need
19:36 - to click on the terminal option now once
19:39 - your terminal opens you just need to
19:40 - give this command I'm going to provide
19:43 - this command in the description of this
19:44 - video also which is to install some
19:48 - essential packages before you install
19:50 - VirtualBox guest additions on your open
19:53 - to operating system so this command is
19:55 - sudo apt install built essentials space
19:59 - DKMS space linux -
20:02 - - this you name space are okay so just
20:08 - type this command on the Ubuntu terminal
20:12 - and then press Enter and give your
20:14 - Ubuntu password I'm going to just
20:16 - provide my open to is password here and
20:18 - then I will just press yes here or why
20:21 - here and then press ENTER and after some
20:24 - time you will see that all the
20:27 - installation steps are finished so once
20:30 - it's done you can close your terminal
20:33 - and now what you can do is you can just
20:35 - go to devices on your VirtualBox windows
20:39 - so just click on devices here and then
20:41 - click on insert guest additions CD image
20:44 - and once you do that you will be able to
20:47 - see this kind of window so you just need
20:49 - to click on the Run button here so just
20:51 - click on run and then you just need to
20:55 - provide your open to spaz word so I'm
20:57 - going to just provide my Ubuntu is
21:00 - password and then click on authenticate
21:01 - we're just going to open the terminal
21:04 - and it's going to install the VirtualBox
21:07 - guest additions on your open to
21:11 - operating system and after some time you
21:13 - will see this message which says press
21:15 - return to close this window so you just
21:18 - need to press enter here which is going
21:21 - to close this window now at this point
21:24 - you just need to restart your Ubuntu
21:26 - operating system so just go here at the
21:29 - top and then click on power off and then
21:33 - click on power of once again ok so just
21:36 - click on power off and here you don't
21:38 - need to click on restart you just need
21:41 - to click on power off because we just
21:43 - need to shut down our open to operating
21:45 - system first now once it's shut down as
21:48 - I have told you that in the settings you
21:51 - need to go to the Advanced Settings in
21:54 - the general tab and make sure that this
21:58 - shared clipboard and drag-drop option is
22:01 - bi-directional and that will enable you
22:04 - to just copy and paste your files
22:07 - between the VirtualBox and your host
22:09 - operating system now I'm going to start
22:12 - this open to once again and now I'm
22:14 - going to provide my Ubuntu
22:16 - password again and now if you observe
22:19 - when I just drag this window and make
22:23 - the size of this window a little bit
22:24 - bigger the size of Ubuntu desktop also
22:28 - changes and resolution is also better
22:31 - right so when I just maximize this
22:33 - window my Ubuntu desktop size will also
22:37 - change so this is working now now I just
22:42 - want to test whether the copy and paste
22:45 - feature is working or not so I just
22:48 - opened the Firefox browser on my open to
22:52 - operating system and now I'm going to
22:54 - just copy this URL which is on my
22:57 - windows operating system so this is the
23:00 - Google Chrome browser on my Windows
23:02 - operating system and I will just copy
23:04 - this URL and paste it into my open to
23:07 - operating system and you can see this
23:09 - copy and paste option is working here
23:11 - right so this is working similarly when
23:15 - you just copy let's say I'm going to
23:17 - just copy this text from here and go to
23:19 - the browser and open the next tab and
23:22 - paste this thing here you can see you
23:26 - can paste your text from your open to
23:29 - operating system into your Windows
23:31 - operating system so this is how you can
