06:56 - this is a test class and if you want to
06:59 - create a public
07:01 - static void main method then you can
07:03 - check this check box
07:05 - i will just write this
07:08 - by myself so i will just uncheck this
07:12 - check box and then click on
07:13 - finish option so inside this test class
07:16 - i'm going to just write
07:17 - public static void main and then i'm
07:20 - going to just
07:21 - write system
07:24 - dot out dot
07:27 - print ln for print line and then
07:31 - inside the parenthesis i'm going to just

08:20 - your eclipse ide you can also
08:24 - re-size and you can also reposition
08:28 - your terminal window so let me
08:30 - reposition this terminal window at the
08:33 - bottom
08:34 - uh you can drag and drop this window
08:36 - anywhere
08:37 - in your eclipse ide also if you have
08:40 - closed
08:40 - your eclipse ide you will not be able to
08:43 - see uh
08:44 - this eclipse icon in the launch bar this
08:47 - is the icon for the eclipse
08:48 - installer not the eclipse ide so by
08:52 - default
08:52 - if you have selected the default path
08:55 - you can
08:56 - go to your eclipse ide
08:59 - location by just clicking on the go
09:03 - option here so just click on go and then
09:05 - navigate to the home folder so just
09:07 - click on
09:08 - home here and inside the home folder you
09:11 - will be able to see
09:12 - the eclipse folder and then the java
09:15 - folder and then you will be able to see
09:17 - this
09:18 - eclipse application here so what you
09:21 - can do you can just drag this eclipse
09:25 - to the applications folder so just press
09:27 - the command key and then drag
09:29 - this eclipse icon to the applications
09:33 - folder which is going to uh place this
09:37 - into the applications folder right so
09:39 - now
09:40 - once you uh click on the launchpad
09:43 - you will be able to see this eclipse ide
09:45 - and then from here
09:47 - you can click on the eclipse icon and
