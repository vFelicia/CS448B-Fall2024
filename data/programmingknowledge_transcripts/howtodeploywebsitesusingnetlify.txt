00:10 - tutorial hit the bell icon button so
00:12 - that you don't miss out any tutorial
00:15 - okay so I am on net lefeve comm and I'd
00:19 - like you to go to that site and what
00:23 - we're gonna do is let's create so what
00:26 - you're gonna do is you would go to login
00:27 - and actually you would go to sign up
00:30 - sorry we need to sign you up
00:32 - for a site so go to sign up and go ahead
00:36 - and take all the steps that you would
00:39 - need to do to sign up and then once
00:42 - you're there we're gonna log in so I'm
00:45 - gonna go ahead and just log in myself
00:47 - and then we'll start alright so what I
00:52 - did is I just tested a new site on
00:56 - necklace or just put in your email and
00:59 - password and everything then you're
01:01 - gonna have to verify your email and then
01:04 - once you get in they're going to have a
01:06 - pop-up that comes up that says Quick
01:10 - Start and it's going to say next and
01:12 - then when you click on that you're going
01:13 - to get to this this plate this page so
01:15 - you're at your sites and you're gonna
01:18 - see an icon a button here that says new
01:20 - site from get so if you click on that
01:24 - you're going to need to decide you want
01:28 - it to come from github gitlab or
01:30 - bitbucket so since we started with
01:32 - github we would click on github and then
01:37 - it's gonna just prompt you to it's gonna
01:42 - prompt you to input your username so I
01:47 - already did that a long time ago so it's
01:49 - just popping up on my username already
01:52 - okay so you'll just have to follow the
01:56 - prompts until you can connect your
01:57 - github to this site so go ahead and do
02:01 - that pause the video and do that and
02:02 - then we'll come right back okay so once
02:05 - you have connected your github to
02:07 - nullify then when you hit a new site
02:11 - from git
02:14 - you click on github it should pop up
02:18 - your repos that are already there okay
02:22 - so let's see here's the one that I want
02:25 - to work on this is the demonstration
02:26 - repo that we created so I have a whole
02:29 - bunch of them obviously but you'll just
02:31 - probably have just the one because you
02:33 - only have the one that we put on get on
02:35 - github so hopefully you can find it and
02:37 - then just click on it ok so here once
02:43 - you get to this page you it shows you
02:48 - what your owner that you're the owner
02:49 - you're gonna make a master you're the
02:51 - branch that we're going to deploy is the
02:53 - master
02:53 - so that's default and basic build
02:56 - settings we are just gonna leave it as
02:59 - as it comes so build command and publish
03:02 - directory and then all we're gonna do is
03:04 - hit deploy site and that should be it
03:11 - ok here we are so we they give you a
03:14 - funny little name for your for your site
03:19 - so youthful bart tick is mine on this
03:22 - one alright and if we click on this link
03:25 - it is live it is deployed that's it it's
03:28 - all there is to it so I'm just gonna
03:29 - click on it we're gonna go to our
03:30 - website and it's already deployed on the
03:33 - internet this is so cool so we can go to
03:37 - the about page we can go to the contact
03:40 - page and check and make sure
03:43 - everything's deployed correctly ok so
03:47 - what we're gonna do now is talk about
03:49 - how we can get those contact form to
03:51 - work and also how to change it to our
03:55 - own domain ok so what you would do is
04:00 - let's let's click on site settings
04:02 - see what that says alright so it just
04:07 - gives you your general information about
04:08 - your site you can change the site name
04:11 - if you want to let's say you can delete
04:17 - the site if you need to so what we're
04:20 - gonna do is if we go to domain
04:22 - management then we can talk about how to
04:24 - get a domain name so you don't have this
04:26 - funny
04:27 - little you know address you can make it
04:30 - your own domain alright see super easy
04:34 - and then if you wanted to work on forms
04:36 - we can go down here and click on forms
04:38 - so let's go to domain management first
04:41 - alright so says use your own domain for
04:44 - your net if I cite for free so you would
04:48 - just click on add custom domain and you
04:53 - can bring a domain name that you already
04:54 - own or buy a new one
04:55 - when you buy the domain with us we
04:57 - automatically configure your dns dns
04:59 - settings and provision a wildcard
05:01 - certificate for your domain so that
05:02 - would be the easiest way to do it so you
05:05 - would just put in your domain name of
05:07 - your choice and they will check to see
05:09 - if it is available and you might have to
05:12 - change it a couple of times to make to
05:14 - find one that's available and then you
05:15 - would just click on verify and just work
05:18 - through their documentation to add it if
05:22 - you use if you've bought a domain name
05:24 - from another dns a DNS provider then
05:28 - you're gonna have to configure them
05:31 - there's some documentation on how to
05:34 - connect it here to not to you know have
05:37 - it point to natla fie it's really really
05:39 - easy it's and you can learn more in the
05:41 - docs so you can read about that it's
05:43 - pretty self-explanatory I can't remember
05:46 - all the steps I took when I did it but
05:48 - it wasn't hard at all ok so let's go
05:52 - back to the forms oh and the other thing
05:58 - you might you might want to do for your
05:59 - site is have some security with it so
06:04 - you want an SSL certificate and what you
06:06 - do is click on HTTPS and that's after
06:10 - you have your domain name they will it's
06:16 - just going to be automatic in fact if
06:18 - you get your domain name from them it's
06:20 - probably even easier so what you do is
06:23 - just click on here and if you already
06:29 - have your domain set up its gonna just
06:31 - again follow the prompts and you're
06:32 - gonna have an SSL security security
06:35 - certificate on your site and it's going
06:38 - to look secure and professional
06:41 - so let's go check out the forms okay so
06:45 - here it says manage the forms and
06:47 - submissions without any server-side code
06:49 - or JavaScript so what you have to do it
06:54 - says code in HTML form into any page on
06:57 - your site add a net Liffe I attribute to
06:59 - the form tag and you'll receive
07:01 - submissions in your net off a dashboard
07:03 - HTML files are parsed directly at deploy
07:06 - time so there's no need for you to make
07:07 - an API call or include extra JavaScript
07:10 - on your site let's go up to the top and
07:13 - up here it says forms so let's go ahead
07:17 - and click on that and it's going to give
07:19 - us the instructions on how to add the
07:21 - form alright so what we have to do is we
07:23 - just have to add a line of code to our
07:27 - form contact page all right so it says
07:31 - code in HTML form into any page using
07:35 - the data and net LeFay equals true so if
07:39 - you look down here it's in the form tag
07:42 - it says name equals contact method post
07:44 - data and that will fight equals true so
07:47 - what we're going to do is we're just
07:48 - going to copy all this information and
07:52 - what's a copy it and let's go into our
07:55 - code and I'm going to start at the
08:00 - contact to page because that's the one I
08:02 - want to try first so if you look here
08:06 - here's my form tag so I have my class
08:09 - here because it's the materialized
08:12 - remembers the materialized you know CSS
08:15 - so I'm just gonna click right here and
08:17 - just paste it in so form name equals
08:20 - contact method post true everything
08:23 - looks good the only thing I need to fix
08:25 - is that this page is called contact to
08:28 - dot HTML so I'm going to change this to
08:30 - contact two because if you have more
08:33 - than one contact page it just has to
08:36 - match it's the name of the HTML okay so
08:39 - I'm gonna hit save and that is all we
08:43 - have to do except for one thing since
08:47 - we're using materialized though the net
08:50 - Liffe I bots aren't going to be able to
08:51 - read this because it's inside
08:54 - it has some JavaScript enabled if you
08:56 - remember that we enable JavaScript
08:59 - there's a script tag at the bottom of
09:01 - this page this is the materialized
09:04 - JavaScript that's been enabled so it's
09:07 - not going to work because of that so we
09:10 - have to add something so I was looking
09:12 - at the documentation let's see the
09:16 - documentation
09:18 - and so I was looking at the
09:20 - documentation of troubleshooting and
09:24 - stuff and it said basically if you have
09:26 - a here I'll show you what it says
09:29 - because it was kind of cute
09:30 - it says Netta flat leaf-like comes with
09:33 - some handy features blah blah blah you
09:36 - can add this the attribute true which is
09:38 - what we did it says in a react app
09:40 - however just adding the attribute won't
09:43 - work sad trombone very cute it's because
09:46 - we need to if you're using a static site
09:49 - generator and they're giving you Gatsby
09:52 - or react static it's not going to work
09:54 - because the processing bots that look
09:57 - for the attributes when a site is
09:59 - deployed only knows how to parse HTML so
10:03 - until they evolve enough to detect forms
10:05 - rendered with JavaScript we need to give
10:07 - them a little help so since our contact
10:09 - form has JavaScript we're gonna have to
10:12 - add this little piece of code and it's
10:15 - down here where it talks about add a
10:17 - static HTML version of the form to your
10:19 - site so all we have to do is copy the
10:23 - part that says form name equals contact
10:28 - hidden well no that wasn't it where was
10:30 - it I think this is it input type hidden'
10:35 - name form name that was it add a hidden
10:38 - form name field so that's what we're
10:41 - gonna do so we're just gonna add this
10:44 - whole thing let's copy it and let's put
10:50 - it in our code and we're gonna put it
10:53 - right underneath where we have the data
10:55 - data and net laughs I true right
10:58 - underneath that paste it in mmm and I
11:03 - think that's all we need okay I'm gonna
11:06 - hit save okay so I'm gonna hit save and
11:10 - now we have to go over here and we have
11:11 - to commit the changes so let's stage
11:14 - them first so I'm going to hit stage
11:15 - changes with my little plus and so since
11:22 - we are using vs code they have an
11:25 - integrated get situation here so we can
11:30 - do everything here we don't have to use
11:31 - the command line
11:32 - we can but we don't have to so I just
11:35 - clicked on this little plus that says
11:36 - stage the changes and it tells me that
11:38 - I'd staged those changes and now I'm
11:41 - going to put in a message of what we
11:43 - staged what we're doing what was the
11:44 - change the change is added added form
11:51 - attribute and hidden hidden hidden type
12:02 - call it could see it was called the type
12:04 - is hidden hidden type input okay and now
12:10 - we're going to just commit it by
12:13 - clicking on this little quest little
12:16 - check mark and then after we do that
12:19 - we're going to synchronize it and
12:21 - synchronize it with github and that's
12:24 - down here if we click on this this will
12:27 - synchronize it sending it to github and
12:29 - then github automatically sends it to
12:31 - net liffe i all right so now it should
12:35 - work so let's go back to our our contact
12:41 - page and see we are at in our address
12:43 - this is live okay and so we're going to
12:46 - test it so I'm gonna say test and I'm
12:49 - gonna say test at gmail.com and I'm
12:55 - gonna say test and submit there you go
13:00 - thank you your form submission has been
13:02 - received yay we did it all right now if
13:05 - you want to also do it on the other
13:07 - contact page remember this one this
13:11 - one's easier because it doesn't have
13:13 - it's not using to any JavaScript so if
13:15 - we go back to our vs code we go to the
13:18 - original contact form all we're gonna
13:22 - have to do is add in the form name
13:26 - equals contact method equals post data a
13:29 - net lafha equals true that's all we have
13:31 - to do nothing else needs to be done and
13:34 - then you hit save and commit it and
13:38 - refresh it and you know synchronize it
13:41 - with github and then it'll work as well
13:44 - on our site so let's go
13:46 - go to the this contact me so let's just
13:49 - test it so we're gonna say test now the
13:54 - email let's say test at gmail.com and
13:59 - then we have to do our phone number the
14:01 - exact way they want us to do it so let's
14:03 - say five five five five five five - five
14:07 - five five five and then we'll say this
14:11 - is another test and hit submit and it
14:16 - worked
14:17 - cool and that's all there is to it it's
14:20 - super easy so now let's go back to our
14:22 - site not the live site but let's just go
14:27 - back to our account and let's go check
14:33 - we're in our your a little youthful bar
14:37 - tech thing and what you can do is check
14:41 - to see it tells you when you've deployed
14:44 - all the different deploys and it shows
14:46 - us all of our recent sub perform
14:48 - submissions that we just did so that's
14:50 - cool and there's one more thing I want
14:53 - to show you if we go to site settings I
14:57 - think it is and if you you you're gonna
15:02 - want to be notified if somebody contacts
