00:00 - hello guys now in this particular video
00:01 - we'll be creating one of the script that
00:03 - is the file Integrity Checker that is
00:05 - the basically a simple script which you
00:07 - will be using to check the Integrity of
00:09 - the file whether the file has been
00:10 - changed or not okay so basically for
00:13 - this tutorial we'll be using on the tool
00:15 - that is the md5 sum okay so let me just
00:18 - show you the demonstration of this
00:19 - particular tool so basically this tool
00:21 - will generate the hash of the particular
00:23 - file so if you will check the hash of
00:26 - this hello.txt so here you can see there
00:29 - this is the hash okay so but now if
00:32 - we'll change the uh something like let
00:35 - me add again 1D here and again let me
00:38 - check the hash so there will be change
00:41 - in both the hashes so here you can see
00:43 - the difference
00:44 - so basically what we will be doing so
00:46 - we'll be using this tool and we'll be
00:48 - creating two functions for generating
00:51 - hash and the checking hash and we will
00:54 - check if both the hashes will match from
00:56 - the previous hash then there will be no
00:59 - uh changes we will display that as
01:01 - output and if there is changes then we
01:03 - will display output as like there is a
01:05 - change in a file okay so let's start
01:07 - with the uh creation of the script so
01:09 - let me just add the one file that is the
01:11 - file Integrity checker file integrity
01:17 - Checker dot sh okay so now what we will
01:22 - do now I will create two function so let
01:25 - me just uh
01:27 - pin Bash
01:31 - shebang has been added and we will give
01:33 - the two options for the user for
01:35 - generating hash and the create checking
01:37 - hash okay so but before this I will just
01:40 - create the function that is the
01:43 - generate hash okay and we'll be covering
01:46 - all the concept which we have covered
01:48 - till now like mostly function will be
01:50 - covered in this particular video okay
01:52 - so now I will just ask the user to enter
01:56 - the file name of which we want to
01:59 - generate hash so here I will ask the
02:00 - user enter the file name please
02:04 - okay
02:07 - and I will just restore the file name in
02:10 - the read file name value file name
02:12 - variable
02:13 - and then now what we will do we will
02:16 - just generate the hash and store that
02:19 - hash into the file that is md5 sum and
02:23 - will provide the file name and we will
02:26 - just
02:26 - [Music]
02:28 - file name dot md5 we will store the
02:32 - output in the md5 this output whatever
02:34 - the output we are getting this one we
02:35 - will stored in this md5 okay
02:39 - and uh then we will just Echo
02:43 - hash value
02:46 - stored
02:47 - in
02:50 - dot dollar file name whatever the file
02:53 - name we have
02:55 - file name dot md5 file okay so uh this
03:02 - is the generate hash let me just call
03:04 - the function and let me check with
03:06 - whether everything is working fine or
03:08 - not
03:09 - clear the screen dot slash but before
03:13 - that I will need to provide the certain
03:14 - permission to this file that is chmode
03:16 - plus X that is 23
03:20 - clear the screen dot slash 23 into the
03:23 - file name I'll just write
03:24 - hello.txt here and here you can see
03:27 - Hello hash value stored in this file
03:30 - so let me check okay so here hash value
03:33 - has been stored we can check here okay
03:36 - now uh coming back
03:39 - to the script so let me just clear here
03:43 - the net hash now what I will do I will
03:45 - just uh what we can say
03:51 - um check hash value will uh check hash
03:55 - check h a s h check hash value
04:00 - okay
04:02 - and Eco enter the file name now we are
04:07 - just checking the hash value and we will
04:09 - match the hash value with our previous
04:10 - value okay
04:12 - so Eco enter the file name again we will
04:15 - enter the file name and we will just
04:17 - read file name
04:19 - we are creating the variable
04:21 - and storing this in the file name and
04:24 - now we will uh generated hash we will
04:27 - create one variable value
04:29 - generated hash okay don't confuse
04:33 - between generate hash and generated hash
04:35 - okay and here we will store the output
04:38 - of the previously uh whatever the
04:42 - previous uh hash which has been
04:44 - generated in the md5 file so we will
04:47 - store the value like this value we will
04:50 - store in this variable generated hash
04:53 - how we can do it we will just read the
04:55 - file name that is dollar
04:58 - file name dot md5 we will add okay
05:02 - and then we will again
05:06 - we will just store the uh
05:11 - like current hash or current output so
05:14 - how we can do it dollar
05:16 - and we will just do mt5 sum
05:20 - and then we will just provide the file
05:22 - name
05:23 - okay now we are good to go and then we
05:26 - will use the if conditions here like if
05:30 - we will just do like this F and we will
05:34 - pass the double quotes and dollar
05:38 - gen let me just copy this thing
05:44 - if dollar generated hash will be equal
05:47 - equal to we will use here equal equal to
05:51 - again double quote dollar output
05:55 - then in this case what we have to do
05:57 - then eco
06:00 - there is
06:03 - there is no change in file
06:07 - okay and in the else condition we will
06:10 - surely uh add the equal statement that
06:13 - is there Edge
06:17 - there is something
06:19 - change
06:21 - something change in a
06:24 - file
06:26 - okay
06:27 - and then we have to just
06:30 - block the uh if condition we have to
06:33 - just close the if condition okay
06:36 - and now what we have to do uh
06:39 - what we can do uh like
06:42 - now we will just to Echo the choices eco
06:48 - one dot what the user want generate hash
06:55 - whether user want to generate hash or
06:57 - whether user want to
06:59 - calculate hash
07:01 - to check
07:05 - file Integrity we can say file in t
07:10 - gritty okay
07:12 - and then what we will do we will use the
07:14 - switch case and whatever the thing which
07:17 - we have already learned so we will use
07:19 - read hyphen p
07:21 - okay and we will like right enter your
07:25 - choice enter your choice
07:30 - okay and we will store it in the choice
07:33 - variable that is the choice okay and
07:37 - then we will use the case dollar Choice
07:40 - okay
07:41 - in and if this is the if this is one
07:45 - then what we have to do Echo
07:50 - then
07:52 - generating hash
07:55 - and then we have to just call that
07:56 - function that is the generate hash
08:02 - okay here we go generate hash okay now
08:06 - we have to just remove this part now if
08:08 - 2 is selected by the user then in this
08:11 - case what you have to do and here you
08:12 - have to just break this one okay two
08:15 - then we have to just Echo
08:17 - uh we can do checking file integrity
08:23 - okay and we have to just call this
08:25 - function that is the check hash value
08:30 - okay and we have just closed this one
08:34 - and the if any other value that is the
08:37 - default if we get the default
08:39 - then in this case we have to just Echo
08:42 - invalid Choice buddy
08:45 - invalid Choice okay and we have to close
08:48 - this case
08:51 - okay now we are good to go I hope
08:54 - everything is ready and we will just run
08:56 - the script again dot clear the screen
08:59 - okay and I will just remove this file
09:01 - here uh because we'll be using this file
09:07 - okay and I will just remove this one
09:10 - also
09:11 - okay now run the script okay what is the
09:15 - choice first enter the file name
09:19 - hello.txt okay hash value has been
09:22 - stored inside this file now we will do
09:24 - again run the script and now we want to
09:26 - check file Integrity enter the file name
09:30 - hello.txt okay so there is no change in
09:33 - file okay but now what I will do I will
09:36 - just again uh
09:39 - do hello.txt and I will add this one
09:44 - e okay
09:46 - and again I will uh
09:49 - clear the screen again run the script
09:51 - enter your choice that is the second
09:54 - check file Integrity enter the file name
09:57 - hello.txt and here you can see there is
09:59 - something change in a file okay so in
10:02 - this case you can see uh like we have
10:04 - changed the file here name like we have
10:06 - added e so it is showing me that there
10:08 - is something change in a file so our
10:11 - this script is running actually fine so
10:15 - for your uh like if you want to go on
10:17 - some advanced level you can use try
10:19 - Excel block all those things okay
10:22 - for if file doesn't exist you can just
10:25 - pop up an error or Echo the statement
10:27 - like file doesn't exist all those kind
10:28 - of things okay
10:29 - so that's all for this guys and I hope
10:31 - you liked it and we have used multiple
10:33 - things inside this so this is basically
10:36 - the long script which you have entered
10:38 - uh till now so that's all for today guys
10:41 - and I will meet you in the next video
10:42 - thank you thank you for watching
