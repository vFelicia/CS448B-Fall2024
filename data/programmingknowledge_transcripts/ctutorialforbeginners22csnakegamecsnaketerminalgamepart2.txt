00:00 - hey guys special program acknowledge the
00:02 - previous video we're making of a second
00:04 - project which was a sneaky and we made
00:07 - quite a progress right so let's see what
00:09 - we we have made this board and then we
00:12 - have updated the port without causing
00:15 - any flickering and that's a great
00:16 - improvement and we also had admitted
00:19 - this kitchen and we also repeat the
00:22 - project for the food appear at different
00:24 - random locations right in this video we
00:27 - complete this game by adding the body
00:29 - for the sneak well you know that the
00:32 - snake is kept growing by oiling the food
00:34 - but it's just growing in numbers rate we
00:36 - are not showing it really so we will be
00:38 - showing that and also before that so
00:45 - let's see what is in there so let's just
00:51 - see the time when this do you think this
00:54 - people and let's first talk about the
00:56 - most obvious logical so in the
01:01 - definition of food what we have said is
01:03 - once if food is created I want to random
01:07 - location on the bull which will be the
01:11 - location where also displayed right
01:13 - that's what this event will be
01:14 - eyeballing this generates would function
01:16 - inside the consultant but what is
01:19 - happening here if this program again and
01:21 - again so let's again so and if I close
01:27 - that that will be saying that the second
01:30 - time also this good deal but the
01:34 - consequence are getting random issues if
01:37 - you see the second food is somewhere
01:38 - over there and if we start this game
01:40 - again and try to eat that you see that
01:43 - the second foot has been generated some
01:45 - random position right there so to fix
01:50 - this
01:50 - you can go with that it is what actually
01:53 - and it is actually not what we wanted
01:56 - it's basically what I remembered if you
02:01 - like that you can go ahead with the same
02:06 - since we wanted to generate the food at
02:11 - a random position
02:12 - from the beginning what we are doing
02:14 - wrong this here first legitimate object
02:18 - and then we are sitting there and
02:20 - illusion so if we were introduced to the
02:23 - random function on the ceiling function
02:25 - or back in the tic-tac-toe video rate so
02:28 - she remembers the ceiling function is a
02:30 - kind of controller to the random number
02:32 - generator with the random number
02:34 - generator will generate some act of
02:36 - nothing do some calculation mentor
02:40 - program is loaded onto the memory right
02:43 - so if you want a different item what you
02:45 - need to do is to close everything and
02:48 - then open it again we don't want to do
02:50 - that we want random numbers right when
02:52 - we are in so what we do is we can you
02:55 - see a starting point and what we do is
02:59 - BCD number every time you know so what
03:04 - is the thing which is change the
03:06 - constant time is changing constantly so
03:09 - what we do is we just shade it at that
03:11 - time so this one will take the time it
03:15 - will take the time as an integer and
03:18 - then make the number generator start
03:21 - from that particular time that is why
03:23 - you get different numbers after seeing
03:26 - them but what is happening here is we
03:28 - are calling the random function before
03:30 - seeding for the first time then the next
03:33 - time onwards
03:33 - what is it the logic test over here
03:36 - length which is after the seeding that
03:39 - if I have a randomized notations for the
03:42 - not for the future so to fix that it is
03:45 - very simple what you can do is you have
03:47 - a twin of the culture man I don't know
03:49 - why I defined this can shape it
03:51 - basically when we define a constructor
03:53 - what we actually see is we need the
03:56 - contractor to do something which that if
03:59 - a physical pilot will concept for this
04:02 - class basically create the memory
04:08 - required for this particular class right
04:11 - for loading this class onto the memory
04:14 - you need some amount of memory which is
04:16 - calculated by the consciousness then we
04:19 - wanted the concepted do something extra
04:22 - is called dysfunction on the creation
04:23 - and it did not purport as we expected
04:26 - that we could just get rid of that
04:27 - concept and then the option manually and
04:31 - if you want to keep the working of the
04:35 - program just a foot then you can skip
04:37 - the step I do you resist difference I
04:40 - provide that the put each a bit at a
04:44 - random location right from the study so
04:47 - even go there and after feeding the
04:50 - function what they can do is we can now
04:52 - call the ten recruitment this is the one
04:55 - day in which we wanted to skip by using
04:58 - the transit which was actually worthless
05:01 - in it so creating a concept that was not
05:04 - good and at least for this kind of a
05:07 - game where you want the first element to
05:10 - be undermined so it basically get rid of
05:13 - the concept and that makes all the
05:14 - issues now so that this will be getting
05:16 - the foods and different locations one is
05:20 - over here this is actually which I
05:28 - wanted to show you in the beginning late
05:30 - when I was eating the food I this is a
05:37 - radiological issue with this program
05:41 - which we made in the previous video and
05:42 - we'll be fixing that right now so if you
05:45 - see there is no food on the boat but
05:47 - actually this mean if you feel she
05:48 - minded okay so close that and now it's
05:52 - the most efficient now that's issue
05:55 - which we just saw that the food is not
05:57 - yet getting tended you well what we're
06:00 - doing in the general food here we are
06:04 - saying that we want some random number
06:06 - in the range of what the Whitman's right
06:09 - we told that when the first character is
06:13 - basically reserved for the last one so
06:17 - it means leaving those two characters
06:23 - it's all seasonable day but if you
06:25 - Harbor the path it is going to tell you
06:27 - a totally different story so let's see
06:29 - what the madness
06:30 - people of mine paint over here and now
06:33 - let's first talk about one of this width
06:35 - or him both of them are going to go by
06:37 - the same logic - we can talk about only
06:40 - one of them here let's say I qualify
06:44 - so what is the height height was
06:45 - thinking 25 right so the whole thing is
06:49 - actually pretty difficult if I am what
06:52 - we are saying we are saying that the
06:53 - first character and the last character I
06:57 - deserve for the points so from a
07:00 - computer's perspective what are these
07:02 - numbers going to be amputated starting
07:05 - from zero day so 25 times this is
07:07 - basically 0 to 24 for the computer some
07:11 - of the changes they're saying that this
07:14 - 0 and this plentiful is not required in
07:17 - your range so basically we want numbers
07:19 - from 1 to 53 we want to point zero three
07:23 - two one - character which is 20 food so
07:26 - this range becomes 1 to 23 there is a
07:30 - better number in the state what you can
07:32 - do is plug it into the formula
07:34 - suppose now with random imagination it
07:37 - does if you want a number from sweet n
07:40 - that is a lower limit to you which is
07:44 - the upper limit and lower limit is
07:46 - included and upper limit is not included
07:49 - so you will be getting some number still
07:52 - you minus one so if you want numbers in
07:55 - this range that is alien because human
07:57 - is not inclusive you won't get to you
08:00 - then the table s you need to plug in R
08:03 - and mod it was you - L plus 1
08:12 - plus then this is a Honda you can plug
08:15 - it into this former you have even see
08:18 - logic basically both of them I'm going
08:21 - to give you the same reason and because
08:23 - you so for simplicity so what happens
08:30 - let me write it as R this is this
08:32 - meaning the random function I want and
08:35 - us over here 24 it because we want 23 to
08:39 - be included and in this formula this
08:41 - particular you is not included in this
08:44 - random number generation so we will just
08:48 - paste this by one number that is 24 and
08:50 - that will become 24 minus L plus 1 this
08:54 - 1 plus 1 the lower limit is 1 which is
08:57 - included do anything to it and plus 1 so
09:01 - what this becomes is are 22 plus 1 and
09:07 - what is many - it is basically 25 - 3 ok
09:11 - so this is the number which we wanted to
09:15 - generate 15 but what we did is we
09:17 - basically varied by our intuition and
09:20 - messed up the logic rate so to correct
09:24 - this what you need to do is using this
09:27 - particular phone when this becomes minus
09:29 - 3 and this will become plus the and the
09:31 - same will go with hi dolls when we talk
09:34 - about time the same thing will go with
09:36 - the width on zoo so as you draw a
09:38 - similar analogy you will be seeing that
09:40 - same logic will be like that and here it
09:47 - is minus 3 and now this will fix the
09:52 - disappearance of the food and this is
09:55 - another medium flaw in our looping right
10:00 - should pair of looping we are looping
10:01 - over here with the poor will be
10:03 - displaying there is a major flood and
10:06 - believe me if you have been able to
10:08 - identify that particular air you are
10:10 - going to be a great example so let's see
10:13 - what the error is it is basically lying
10:16 - with
10:17 - in what we're doing then for the halted
10:20 - look at this pretty statement we are
10:22 - going from I equal to 0 to I equal to
10:25 - height which is basically how the
10:26 - computer sees numbers from 0 to minus 1
10:30 - and for the faith we are doing something
10:32 - differently so what we're doing here now
10:34 - saying that we are going from 0 to n
10:38 - minus 2 and the hydrati said that these
10:41 - two characters which are missing with
10:43 - the walls are constant and that sounded
10:56 - reasonable but here is the clue what
10:58 - happens is let's see my generated of
11:03 - x-axis which is basically the bid is
11:06 - going to be some 20 ok so what is a
11:10 - maximum it is 58 and what do they do if
11:13 - this is the maximum number you can
11:15 - generate leaving 0 and 49 this 48 so
11:21 - this is the national number you can
11:23 - generate and let's say that that is our
11:25 - x coordinate that is a value of your
11:28 - event now what happens here well if you
11:31 - say that J is ready to manage - what is
11:37 - - right
11:45 - what you see - you don't have a fail to
11:49 - actually display this coordinate in this
11:52 - loop return because it is out of bounds
11:54 - of this put in this loop will run only
11:57 - 247 and you are asking it to show
12:00 - something which is under 48 which is not
12:03 - possible by this booklet so how do I fix
12:07 - this
12:08 - you can try and already over here if you
12:11 - draw the cottage cheese respect to and
12:15 - the dependence basically the original
12:18 - width of our food scissors then W is 0 J
12:23 - is not define you
12:30 - this is the this is happening it is
13:12 - happening it is this is the fix this one
14:21 - we can do is by comparing we need to add
14:36 - in this thing these things
14:44 - you need to compare only these things to
14:48 - compare that what we can do is we can
14:50 - add one put in jail before comparing it
14:52 - with the ex-con to do to fix this what
14:55 - we're going to do - when we meet - we
14:59 - just leave this here in place of T is
15:06 - going to be T plus 1 and that should
15:28 - work
16:09 - - so going by the same logic with minus
16:13 - 1 is going to be 49 it was with this
16:17 - 50-49 so what do you want you want
16:20 - something greater than 48 that is fix
16:26 - the issue and for the other one which I
16:30 - just showed you there for the brain was
16:32 - what is happening is first joined the
16:35 - pool we are going we are actually
16:37 - changing the date and then
16:41 - [Music]
17:16 - [Music]
17:28 - now this ship things time to show that
17:31 - you are not seeing the sneak continue
17:34 - and now you should see let us make
17:37 - actually collides with the one before
17:39 - taking this game bring inside to what
17:41 - the give you no anticipation now let's
17:45 - see making this way game a real sneaky
17:49 - what is that we need to include the
17:52 - snake's body they are just going to
17:54 - sleep which is basically just increasing
17:55 - in length to be true here you can see
17:58 - it's just increasing them so how they
18:00 - wish to order this week's funny then
18:03 - what is a body it's just a collection of
18:06 - body parts and that collection must have
18:08 - triggered something interview then we
18:10 - are going to use something like an array
18:12 - it is a click in a vector it is also a
18:16 - collection which was seen in the
18:18 - pointless video and the other thing is
18:21 - this so these are three options
18:24 - available to us and that's an this one
18:29 - we need to usually needs to have a fixed
18:34 - size very defining and how do we do the
18:39 - fixed size of the snake they like to
18:42 - play in a fire and settle back and maybe
18:50 - a pro comes in and he can hit this for
18:54 - us because then you know restrictor
18:59 - players or you cannot estimate the
19:01 - players capacity position
19:06 - he should be in this issue and to talk
20:20 - about vectors it is dynamic but again it
20:25 - is going to take up some more extra
20:27 - space by defending different some field
20:32 - and once it gets filled up it'll define
20:34 - a bigger space and then copy all an
20:38 - image to this and get rid of this
20:39 - particular space so this one could be
20:42 - used just good work but again there is
20:44 - some extra space which is good English
20:46 - so basically the best option here is
20:49 - going to be relations if we recover from
20:52 - on the pointers then if you finish this
20:55 - question then to use vectors this is
20:58 - pretty useless you saw at least can be
21:01 - used whenever you have a data structure
21:04 - they would be access here on
21:28 - [Music]
22:02 - [Music]
22:19 - in this case how do we define the pony
23:11 - then it's really simple so let's say I
23:13 - have two body parts which mediate a and
23:16 - the head I have this head over here and
23:19 - the snake has to move to the end
23:21 - so what can you do then what if I
23:24 - to remove the stain and then put another
23:26 - head over here and make this acetate so
23:30 - for D let's just see this x mark on here
23:32 - that we know city now I will see that
23:34 - the snake has punched up to the rate
23:37 - rate and if I do that I'm sorry
23:39 - take off this tape I put the head and I
23:43 - am doing this head as the thing the
23:45 - snake a spoon again and that Sabian
23:47 - eating the food at some location so they
23:49 - start with them I mean this is the snake
23:52 - we have and the food it is going to eat
23:55 - this particular so it does eat them in
23:57 - the next step I made one I will do this
23:59 - I will take of this team I will keep
24:02 - this team and this is what have which I
24:06 - tagged the head I won't remove the peel
24:09 - but he just kinda sitting so now you
24:12 - have two tails than one basically that
24:25 - infected again list this someone
24:28 - preferred option please try to solicit
24:30 - after you're comfortable fish me so
24:33 - let's play small to us in protection the
24:36 - body definition through the effector of
24:43 - tissue and well since vector is a
24:47 - standard element you need to scope using
24:50 - namespace STD like we did in the main
24:54 - function and here you can just a body
25:00 - sorry there and what is that a turnip
25:03 - it's going to the coordinates and
25:04 - business so call this defines the body
25:09 - of the victims not a few changes to me
25:11 - what is that first one we need to
25:13 - include ahead of body when we creating
25:17 - use me
25:18 - so in this point considered what we're
25:22 - going to do we're just going to say body
25:24 - dot pushback which is basically pushing
25:27 - back the elements inside embedded and
25:29 - one minute of respect we need to respect
25:31 - the position which is basically the
25:32 - position of the head of the snake we can
25:35 - just worry
25:44 - [Music]
26:03 - [Music]
26:42 - [Music]
27:12 - but my son if you see but technically
27:17 - the tail should be at the end of a body
27:19 - but if you look at the structure what
27:21 - they're doing is they're actually
27:23 - pushing back the head to the right this
27:27 - is what this purpose
27:28 - so basically our head is over here and
27:30 - up tail is over here and what we need to
27:32 - do we get to remove the first element so
27:34 - let me put it you can just check what
27:37 - the functions over here but to say every
27:39 - time I'm just going to show you the
27:42 - function
27:46 - this is 16 and that's how you use this
28:38 - very first element because our first
28:49 - element is the tail and what we can do
28:52 - we can just share my vector and begin
28:54 - plus G know that you didn't just see my
28:59 - Pig that is going to be any solution so
29:02 - let's implement that I want to share
29:06 - what you taught it is a question which
29:11 - we can get that body but this is the
29:13 - point I position so this is the list and
29:23 - before proceeding
29:25 - let's see whether this is and we need to
29:28 - create another function let us keep this
29:34 - in case something goes wrong
29:36 - so vector and it is going to be
29:38 - coordinated we need a coordinate system
29:41 - to be written believable to make the
29:43 - mistakes body so snake and then let's
29:46 - say get body and inside this because I
29:51 - return
29:54 - and in the snake that hitch you can just
29:58 - create that function definition which is
30:00 - basically vector God
30:04 - I'm sorry what does that get body but so
30:08 - now we have a beautiful speech
30:10 - definition no just update the board and
30:13 - what many refer get convicted to capture
30:16 - the needs bodies will make their porn
30:19 - let's see sleek body equal to those they
30:24 - don't get for me and it said this what I
30:29 - might know then just remove the stems
30:32 - and reactors afterwards what we're going
30:36 - to do is inside the edge we are first
30:38 - went to boot the mix body and see
30:41 - whether it matches one so this body I
30:47 - which will escape what's in the people
30:50 - will change that you do and what you can
30:53 - see is more when is mr. Souki equal to 0
30:58 - K is distant our body we just leave body
31:02 - to the size and keep this plus what
31:05 - they're going to do here is inside this
31:07 - do we you can see if I ain't coordinate
31:11 - which is basically equal to control the
31:13 - y-coordinate this is equal to the snake
31:15 - 20 of the Kate index dot X sorry not
31:21 - right and J plus 1 remember that's the
31:26 - logic we went missing up equal to make
31:29 - 20 dot transmit body of that particular
31:33 - index dot thanks if these things match
31:38 - up then what we need to do you can do
31:40 - this 3 a body part so let's just go with
31:43 - this one this is our body part and this
31:46 - body part becomes u equal to 2 and what
31:51 - will spill we don't underestimate what
31:54 - should I do that I mentioned a
31:56 - particular body part can stay at a
31:58 - particular location so we talk to
32:00 - patients often it is pretty obvious that
32:02 - any other body
32:04 - but you would occupy the division so you
32:05 - can save me a break out of this loop you
32:07 - can end this loop and because anybody
32:09 - that is if it is not 20 but if not then
32:14 - obviously it is going to be this empty
32:18 - space cannot be empty and here one of
32:21 - the thing is can I go through particle
32:24 - size but remember body impeach the head
32:27 - right so what we do is we just a body
32:30 - dot size minus one which will basically
32:31 - be for the last movie and now this
32:34 - should work in that's fine this F time
32:39 - and here you can see that the snake has
32:42 - been to the other food is over here I
32:46 - hate that and then you can see that the
32:49 - snake is growing gradually here you have
32:51 - four body much of the snake and now if I
32:54 - need that you know you have five so now
32:58 - we have a working big game right so now
33:02 - you have a working snake M and this
33:03 - works pretty fine right now the you can
33:06 - see that a commission also works pretty
33:08 - fine the body part shape to follow the
33:10 - head so on so this thank you but I
33:15 - promise you it will be how to create it
33:19 - till you put one and before that if you
33:21 - want to show that is also pretty simple
33:24 - what you do is you just yeah here it was
33:28 - go to keep it close and so that you can
33:32 - use it on important also
33:34 - so here and you see in school it just
33:39 - got to be zero at the beginning and you
33:42 - can just set this to zero in case you
33:43 - want to say play again something like
33:46 - that what you can do is instead of me
33:48 - you can just save the king I'm not going
33:52 - to do that if I do that if I want to
33:55 - again you can ask a question do you want
33:58 - to create and if I press yes then you
34:02 - can call this function again and
34:07 - conflict you give and here what you can
34:10 - do is you can just
34:15 - and if you want to be a 10-point or
34:17 - something 232 this to your school they
34:19 - go to school plus they're not any short
34:22 - hands if we do school class equal to 10
34:24 - or something you can do that come on
34:26 - here and here before starting to treat
34:29 - on the poor but we can do it we can just
34:31 - su over school so school this our
34:39 - current school and just a couple of
34:42 - Newton to reduce heat conduction
34:45 - equipment I have a function over here
34:48 - that is peaceful so in the snake paws
34:51 - which is actually getting the position
34:52 - of the head hang they are also getting
34:54 - the position of the body and we need not
34:57 - define the coalition of the sleep so we
34:59 - do that those things first of all let's
35:01 - see that this thing works on all so now
35:03 - you have this particular snake and I
35:06 - hate that the squish it and how I eat
35:08 - that school is Trini is at school is 30
35:12 - and so on you can close that and to take
35:18 - care of the coalition when I might have
35:20 - figured it out by now what we do what I
35:23 - need to do here is you need to see this
35:27 - you need to kick it correct or not how
35:31 - do we check that but you don't realize
35:33 - you can't write a check out to infinity
35:36 - to do this what I put the zero is less
35:42 - than the body dot size well it seems I
35:45 - just mean to seal in minus one because
35:49 - we don't want to take it and just listen
35:53 - what we need to check if a snake's head
35:58 - head is basically person so if was dot X
36:02 - is equal to any of the sleep body the
36:05 - body is just body for do you know tiny
36:09 - dot thanks and the five permanent
36:14 - solution first it is equal to parties I
36:18 - don't buy if these two thing except this
36:21 - you return to yes you can I do it if
36:24 - these two things don't respect the red
36:26 - just see a little fun so
36:29 - [Music]
36:34 - [Music]
36:42 - that is going to take a buy it if I go
36:45 - like that one body but if I just press
36:53 - right I am just going to collide Minich
36:56 - so basically I'm elated and now you can
36:58 - see that though what is our stop
37:00 - basically collision I will need to be
37:03 - smoking
37:03 - so that basically ends this team and if
37:09 - you want to make it if you put up with
37:11 - it's really simple
37:14 - many of you right now when you just need
37:19 - to play with the quad in your truth here
37:21 - if you see the snake moves me what you
37:24 - do this if you want to change the loop
37:27 - you just say here if this particular
37:33 - thing position dot X this is greater
37:36 - than the bit - - then what you do you
37:41 - just say position that X equal to zero
37:43 - so simple and again what you do if you
37:46 - say if position got Y force on position
37:50 - dot X is less than one cannot do the
37:54 - dissolution dot X equal to the width
37:58 - minus three so even if random for
38:02 - children it is with minus B because for
38:05 - generating the random numbers in fact
38:07 - rate so which basically with managed to
38:09 - and this will make the side wall still
38:11 - you put it would seem that and now if
38:14 - you rent this you should be going
38:16 - through the side wall and coming from
38:17 - the other one and now if I go through
38:22 - the side wall
38:23 - I should be appearing from the other one
38:24 - so you can see that it has been kind of
38:26 - steady position if I eat that how they
38:29 - will also follow steps go through the
38:32 - area appear from those cookies that is
38:36 - how you make today portable ones and
38:38 - punch of Delta for good
38:41 - basically how to write friends but you
38:44 - can do this you could even have a high
38:45 - school option so you can write down the
38:48 - particular high school fine so let's say
38:51 - I open this camp with your hand high
38:53 - score about 10 points on you thousand
38:55 - points very good we had but yeah so I
39:00 - use for our thousand question that is a
39:02 - high school do it so here if you run the
39:04 - program again that high school pitch
39:06 - noise if my ticket on the movie with
39:10 - that particular kind of man
39:12 - what in the do is you can have a file
39:14 - which you can write down on your high
39:16 - schools and then whenever hippies came
39:19 - along with the file so Jennifer you have
39:22 - all the highs in this game so to some
39:26 - games provide tight right you have been
39:29 - named entities activity and we will come
39:34 - back to just by discussing finds nature
39:36 - because now traditionally what we do is
39:39 - we just write flames of wood students we
39:42 - will come back here and we try to work
39:45 - on this game board and trying to create
39:47 - the file again this is a great looking
39:51 - game and if you want to implement this
39:54 - and if you're comfortable with
39:56 - implementing this with this kind of
39:58 - effective because I'm getting along with
40:04 - the point so you can take you out there
40:07 - and I mean have like mushroom how to use
40:10 - a better user list right here if you
40:13 - want to include and identity put of the
40:16 - one it is at this one he will do that
40:18 - again with the similar kind of logic for
40:20 - my axis and it basically all hopeful for
40:24 - of the one steady food so I had actually
40:27 - implemented this him in Python and if
40:31 - you use it graphics library you will be
40:33 - getting this expect I'm fightin one so
40:39 - here have a game well it is basically
40:41 - return in two files one has the classes
40:44 - and one has
40:45 - and it has to be religious ooh what I
40:47 - have as the sneak in part so again for
40:51 - the horizontal theta theta so whenever
40:53 - that snake is breaking that particular
40:56 - direction you show that image and now
40:59 - when you can track this thing right over
41:01 - here you can see this came this is this
41:09 - is like so this is this is exactly but
41:54 - when you use it you can use it like that
41:57 - so you have some graphics which is all
42:07 - you can see there are many graphics the
42:16 - graphics looks good enough to concern me
42:21 - so basically what we are learning here
42:23 - is concern is the best way or the best
42:29 - platform for actually ideas in a very
42:32 - fast way but if I want to do the same
42:34 - thing in a graphics lab that I see
42:38 - graphically I need to do a lot of things
42:41 - before pretty for this thing so coming
42:44 - up with an idea I'd rather at mean you
42:47 - not to good graphics memory but first
42:50 - think and then
42:51 - put up into any kind of working
42:54 - prototype on your console and then you
42:56 - maybe beautify it on the glass slipper
42:58 - so that's it for this particular video
43:00 - hope you enjoyed this and I read you to
43:03 - build up your one game by changing the
43:07 - boss you know making it faster on the
43:10 - x-ray floor on the way and something
43:12 - that I didn't do that I just went with a
43:14 - very simple approach but I'm sure you
43:17 - can do that and the next video we'll
43:19 - start with inheritance then particle
