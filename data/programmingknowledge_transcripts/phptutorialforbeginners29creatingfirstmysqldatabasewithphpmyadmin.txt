00:00 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:02 - show you how you can create your first
00:06 - mySQL database using PHP my admin uh
00:10 - using this zamp application you have
00:13 - installed so if you are following these
00:16 - video series uh I have shown you how to
00:20 - install this zamp control panel on your
00:23 - Windows operating system right and I
00:25 - have shown you how to start this Apache
00:28 - web server and until now we were only
00:31 - using this Apache web server but now I
00:34 - want to show you how to create or how to
00:38 - use this mySQL database to create a new
00:42 - database and then later on we are going
00:45 - to uh uh use that database to connect to
00:48 - our PHP application so just open this
00:51 - control panel right now only aach server
00:54 - is running by seeing this and just start
00:59 - your MySQL also just start this MySQL
01:03 - from here okay so once you have started
01:06 - this MySQL in This zamp Server we
01:10 - can go to our Local Host uh or because
01:15 - I'm on port 8080 I need to specify the
01:18 - port so Local Host colon 8080 and just
01:24 - press enter otherwise if you are on Port
01:27 - 80 you don't need to uh give this port
01:30 - here you just need to write Local Host
01:32 - here right if you remember in the second
01:35 - video I have shown you so if you have
01:38 - Port other than port a then you need to
01:43 - specify the port you are using and you
01:44 - can see the port number here so I'm
01:47 - using port 8080 right now so I I need to
01:50 - use Local Host colon the number of the
01:54 - port so which is Port 880 otherwise if
01:57 - you're using Port 80 just enter Local
02:00 - Host here right now in here this is the
02:03 - welcome page for zamp for
02:05 - Windows and in the left inside in this
02:09 - these this small section you will be
02:12 - able to see this
02:13 - tool category here and in here you will
02:17 - be able to see PHP my admin you just
02:20 - need to click this PHP my admin and you
02:23 - will be able to see this kind of uh uh
02:27 - environment for this
02:30 - and this PHP my admin what is a PHP my
02:33 - admin PHP my admin provides an interface
02:38 - for your
02:41 - MySQL uh database okay so we have
02:45 - install myscle database and we are
02:47 - running mysq database and PHP my admin
02:51 - is just uh a interface or is a manager
02:55 - to manage your mySQL database okay
03:00 - once again or let so once you uh open
03:06 - this PHP my admin first thing you need
03:09 - to check here as you will be able to see
03:12 - these uh tabs and we need to go to this
03:16 - users tab users Tab and if you have
03:20 - remembered we have given so these are
03:24 - the uh some of the users provided by PHP
03:27 - my admin and the last user this one is
03:31 - root and this host of this uh user is
03:36 - Local Host which we are going to use and
03:38 - there is a password which says yes so if
03:41 - you have remember in the second video I
03:45 - think uh yeah in the second video when I
03:49 - have shown you how to install this zamp
03:53 - uh tool on your Windows
03:56 - application in here in the security we
03:59 - set um MySQL password right so I click
04:04 - the security
04:10 - here and in here you will be able to see
04:13 - that we have uh you know we click this
04:16 - link which is called HTTP G Local Host
04:20 - SL security slamp security. PHP and in
04:25 - here we set some
04:27 - password right if you have remembered we
04:29 - set some password for this user for
04:32 - mySQL database so just we are going to
04:36 - use the same password to connect to PHP
04:40 - application okay so just uh I hopefully
04:44 - you remember that password so we are
04:46 - going to use that password once again
04:49 - okay so once uh we are okay with that we
04:55 - I'm going to open once again PHP my
04:59 - admin from from
05:00 - here and this is in the user you just
05:04 - remember the password because it says
05:07 - password is equal to yes and this is
05:09 - your password which you have
05:11 - said okay so it looks like this now for
05:16 - example you want to create a database
05:19 - first of all you will be able to see
05:21 - some of the database already provided by
05:25 - this PHP my admin interface to you this
05:28 - these are some of the test databases
05:30 - provided by PHP my admin so for example
05:34 - we want to create a new database just go
05:37 - to this database tab or database tab
05:40 - whatever you call
05:42 - it and in here you will be able to see
05:45 - create database section here right so in
05:50 - here we can give a name to our database
05:53 - whatever name you want to give to your D
05:56 - database so for example
06:00 - I want to give uh my database name as uh
06:06 - what can be the database name for
06:08 - example student database okay so I'll
06:12 - write
06:15 - student okay so this will be my uh
06:18 - database okay so I want to make a
06:21 - database for student uh students so I
06:26 - give the name
06:27 - student and then
06:29 - in this
06:30 - collection don't bother about the all
06:33 - these collection type you just leave it
06:36 - as default which is collection here and
06:40 - just click this create button and once
06:43 - you click this button you will be able
06:46 - to see your database here or database
06:48 - here right so your database will be
06:52 - registered here and now you when you
06:55 - click this expand button expand or
06:58 - collapse button you will not see any uh
07:01 - thing here so just select this database
07:05 - student database and you will be able to
07:07 - see this create table because our
07:10 - database doesn't contain any table right
07:13 - now
07:15 - okay so first of all if you don't know
07:18 - what is a database database is a
07:21 - collection of related data
07:25 - and the simple example can be your
07:28 - website can have so many users and you
07:31 - want to create uh some kind of a
07:34 - database for all these
07:37 - users for your dat for your website so
07:40 - that you know how many uh users are
07:43 - registered to your website right so you
07:46 - can maintain a data base for the users
07:49 - or different kind of things you can make
07:52 - a database or contain databases or
07:55 - create
07:56 - databases okay so we have selected the
07:58 - our database here with a student and it
08:01 - says create database so every
08:06 - database has tables it can be one table
08:10 - or more than one tables which contains
08:13 - the related data for uh the database so
08:18 - for example I want to create for this
08:21 - student database I want to create a
08:24 - table called for
08:28 - example user uncore info okay this table
08:34 - will contain my user info and in this
08:38 - number of columns so every table
08:40 - contains some number of columns so just
08:43 - uh you know just calculate how many
08:47 - columns you want so for example for my
08:51 - um user info database I need the user ID
08:56 - and I need uh user first name last name
09:01 - and then the username he is going to use
09:05 - and the password he is going to use so I
09:08 - need approximately five column right now
09:13 - so don't worry about this uh if you
09:15 - don't uh you know if you are unsure
09:18 - about the columns which you want to uh
09:21 - use if for your table you can just
09:25 - provide the column you remember right
09:27 - now so you can always change the number
09:30 - of columns in your tables so this is
09:32 - just the starting uh value for the
09:35 - column you can increase or decrease the
09:37 - numers of columns in the database uh in
09:39 - the table anytime and just click this go
09:43 - button and in here you will see
09:47 - five column information you need to
09:50 - provide here so First Column name I want
09:53 - to give here is uh
09:57 - ID okay and what this ID is uh I want to
10:04 - uniquely recognize or uniquely Define
10:08 - some ID for every user so that I can
10:11 - recognize every user uniquely because
10:15 - name of user can be same surname of user
10:19 - can be same username and password of
10:22 - user can be same but there should be one
10:25 - column which is unique for every user so
10:29 - that on the basis of that we can
10:32 - recognize the user right so in our case
10:36 - this will be ID okay second column name
10:41 - I'm going to give is name and one more
10:46 - thing is MySQL is not case sensitive so
10:52 - if you give here Capital ID or a name
10:55 - with a capital N or small n it doesn't
10:58 - matter
10:59 - MySQL is case not a case sensitive uh uh
11:05 - database language right so you can give
11:09 - your name in small n capital N it
11:11 - doesn't matter it'll uh whenever you use
11:14 - this uh word name in capital or cap
11:18 - small letters it will give you the
11:20 - result of uh that
11:23 - query okay so second column name is name
11:27 - third I want to give a as surname fourth
11:31 - I want to give this column name as
11:35 - user name for example and fifth I want
11:39 - to give this column name as
11:41 - pass word okay now the second category
11:48 - or second column here you will see here
11:50 - is type so every for every column you
11:53 - need to Define what type of data it will
11:56 - contain for example I ID of a user can
12:00 - be integer right so I leave it as
12:04 - integer and here you can you have many
12:07 - options to choose but ID can be integer
12:11 - and the name of the
12:14 - user you need to select this one where
12:18 - care which is variable character and
12:21 - once you choose this you need to specify
12:24 - the number of character or maximum
12:26 - number of character your name can have
12:31 - for example I can set max number of uh
12:34 - character in name can be 40 so this is
12:38 - the limit for the name okay so if the
12:42 - name contains more than 40 character it
12:45 - will not be saved okay so you need to
12:48 - define the uh maximum number of
12:52 - character it has if you choose this v g
12:55 - if you choose this text you don't need
12:57 - to define the uh length of the
13:00 - characters okay but we are using this
13:03 - Vare
13:04 - here now for cname it will be Ware
13:09 - username also
13:11 - Ware and password also we need we use
13:15 - spare and maximum for all we can give 40
13:20 - it depends upon you it you it can be 30
13:23 - it can be 20 so whatever you want to
13:26 - give uh the limit or length you can give
13:30 - but in the case of integer you don't
13:32 - need to give it here it will take it
13:35 - automatically now once you
13:37 - set the name of your column and type of
13:40 - your
13:41 - column remember I told you that this
13:44 - will be our unique feature of the table
13:49 - on the basis of uh this ID we are going
13:52 - to decide uh the uniqueness of each user
13:56 - so just just scroll here and search for
14:01 - the index uh column here and index in
14:06 - the index column we need to give this ID
14:09 - as primary and what this primary means
14:14 - is this ID once you set this primary
14:18 - this ID will become your primary key and
14:21 - primary key is the way of telling MySQL
14:24 - that this is the unique column on the
14:28 - basis of which we are going to
14:30 - distinguish our data so because we have
14:34 - set this primary it knows that this will
14:36 - be always unique
14:39 - okay there are some other uh columns
14:44 - which are optional you want you may need
14:47 - to uh if you wish you can fill them but
14:51 - it's not mandatory to fill all the
14:53 - columns but these are some of the
14:55 - important uh columns you need to fill
14:59 - one more column is interesting here is
15:01 - AI column after this index AI means
15:06 - automatic increment so for example for
15:10 - our ID I want that it should increment
15:16 - automatically and uh I don't need to
15:18 - give uh this ID again and again for
15:21 - every user I just need to give this name
15:24 - surname username and password so once
15:27 - you have all this you can just click the
15:31 - save and now your database you see uh
15:35 - your student database has a table called
15:38 - user info and when you click this you
15:42 - will be able to see or when you click
15:44 - this you will be able to see the uh user
15:48 - info table but it it doesn't have any
15:50 - data right now okay so when you just
15:54 - select this table and go to structure
15:56 - here you will be able to see
15:59 - all the structure configuration of your
16:04 - table now let's uh fill in our table
16:08 - okay so for example you want to fill
16:11 - data in your table just select your
16:14 - table and go to insert tab here okay
16:18 - click this in insert Tab and in here you
16:21 - can insert values to each of the column
16:24 - in the table and in
16:27 - here
16:29 - uh yeah in this continue uh insertion
16:33 - with this is the starting number of uh
16:36 - row you you can set for setting the
16:39 - values so you can set it to one or two
16:42 - or five or 10 for example I set it for
16:45 - one only okay
16:49 - now this function just leave it uh blank
16:53 - but for example I don't give user ID for
16:57 - example because I set it to Auto
17:00 - increment so it will automatically
17:02 - created by myql for us but I for example
17:05 - I give name of
17:08 - the
17:10 - user soame of the
17:15 - user and the pass username of the user
17:20 - for example he is
17:23 - admin so I gave the username admin to
17:27 - him and the password for example 1 2 3 4
17:33 - 5 okay so this is my password or this is
17:36 - the password of the user key set okay
17:40 - and just click this
17:41 - go and once you click this go and when
17:44 - you go to this browse tab once again you
17:48 - will be able to see your data ID one
17:51 - name Mark surname username and password
17:55 - in the same way you can insert more data
17:58 - and if you just see here I haven't given
18:01 - any ID to this row but it is generated
18:05 - automatically this ID is generated
18:07 - automatically because I have checked
18:10 - that AI checkbox when I was creating
18:14 - this table right once again I can insert
18:17 - one more data for
18:20 - [Music]
18:27 - example um username can
18:31 - be whatever
18:34 - uh user one for example or user two for
18:39 - example and password can be 11 one one
18:45 - one these are some random values I'm
18:48 - giving so once you set go you will be
18:53 - able to see your data here so in this
18:56 - way you can fill your data right in your
19:00 - table now
19:02 - suppose um suddenly you uh recognize or
19:06 - if you remember some that uh you need to
19:11 - add some more column to this table for
19:15 - example you forgot to add some column
19:18 - which is important for this table you
19:21 - can do that or you can add this uh
19:24 - column to the table by by going going to
19:29 - uh this line here which says add and
19:33 - this is the number of column You may
19:35 - wish to add for example I want to add
19:38 - one more column to my table which has
19:41 - five column already I want to add the
19:44 - sixth column and you can select where
19:47 - you want to add this at the end of the
19:49 - table at the beginning of the table or
19:52 - after some ID for example I want to add
19:55 - this column at the end of the table okay
19:59 - or for example I want to uh add this
20:04 - after after uh some ID after surname I
20:08 - want to add this column I just select
20:11 - the surname and click go and now I need
20:15 - to give the name of the column for
20:17 - example I want to add age and age can be
20:20 - integer type and I don't want to uh fill
20:25 - all information I just click save
20:29 - and just go to once again browse
20:34 - here and you will be able to see here
20:38 - that one more column is added to your
20:41 - table which is age right you can go to
20:44 - the structure and you can see here one
20:46 - more column is added here which is
20:49 - age okay so in this way you can add a
20:54 - column to your
20:56 - table right
20:58 - so um I think uh we have successfully
21:03 - created our database and we have also
21:06 - successfully created a table inside our
21:10 - database and we have understood some of
21:13 - the basics of this PHP my admin so in
21:16 - the next video I'm going to teach you
21:19 - some more thing related to PHP and my
21:21 - admin so stay tuned and please R com And
21:24 - subscribe and bye for now
