00:01 - hello and welcome back to the another
00:02 - video the Java tutorial Series so today
00:04 - we are containing our project number one
00:07 - that is banking application and in this
00:09 - video we will finishing it okay so in
00:13 - our previous video we have discussed
00:14 - about the show many functionality of our
00:17 - application and I have told you that
00:20 - when there is mistake is there inside
00:22 - this method that is what if
00:26 - we are checking the cases for the this
00:28 - letter that is uh capital letters
00:31 - capital a capital b capital c capital D
00:35 - and the capital E okay
00:38 - one minute
00:40 - okay so where we are I have told you
00:43 - that one mistake is there inside this
00:45 - code that is we are checking this case
00:47 - case for the capital letter set is
00:48 - capital a capital a Capital C D and E
00:51 - and what if the user is entering this
00:53 - small uh small letters okay so that is a
00:57 - b c d e uh because this switch switch is
01:03 - comparing that case using the Sky asci
01:07 - value of that characters okay so the Sky
01:10 - value of the capital A and as a capital
01:12 - small a are different so that's why user
01:16 - will doesn't know what is happening why
01:18 - the code is not getting run for the case
01:21 - number a because either I entered the
01:24 - small letters okay instead of entering
01:26 - this capital letter so this is the
01:29 - problem
01:30 - so what we can do whether the user will
01:33 - enter that characters in in a small
01:35 - letter or the capital letter and we are
01:37 - storing that inside the option option
01:39 - variable we will convert that uh input
01:42 - into capital letters okay so what we can
01:45 - do is there is one uh inbuilt class
01:49 - inside Java which is character and which
01:51 - has one function that to
01:54 - upper case and this will accept one
01:56 - character and which is which character
01:58 - is this options okay
02:00 - so what this will do let me just
02:03 - increase the font size so that you can
02:05 - see clearly
02:06 - this will uh get that options input from
02:11 - this option and it will conver apply the
02:14 - two uh apply not apply it will pass that
02:18 - options or the letter whether it is in a
02:21 - small or capital letter
02:23 - to the upper case method and uppercase
02:26 - method will return the capitalize form
02:29 - of that character okay so let me just
02:32 - show you uh this implementation of this
02:35 - here you can see the public static care
02:37 - method is set inside the Java this is
02:39 - the document inbuilt methods which are
02:41 - written inside the Java and here you can
02:43 - see what we what it is returning it is
02:45 - returning to uppercase of that character
02:48 - okay
02:49 - so I guess this will remove the problem
02:54 - that we have inside our application
02:56 - and let me just okay so now I guess we
03:01 - have done all the part that we have you
03:04 - want to do inside our bank account class
03:07 - and we have implemented all the
03:09 - functionalities inside this and now we
03:12 - have to run this and we know from uh
03:15 - where our program will get executed
03:17 - inside this main method okay so inside
03:20 - that this is class banking application
03:23 - and this is class bank account so both
03:25 - classes are different and all our
03:27 - functionalities are written inside this
03:28 - bank account class and we now we have to
03:31 - tell this Bank application class that
03:33 - there is a bank account class is there
03:35 - and we have to create one object of that
03:38 - class okay so how to create the object
03:39 - of the class
03:40 - back we will simply write bank account
03:44 - don't worry for time being just remember
03:47 - uh be with me uh I will cover all those
03:51 - classes what is class object inside our
03:53 - upcoming queries inside that oops
03:54 - concept okay a bank account and we will
03:58 - give a name to the object okay so let me
04:01 - just write
04:03 - uh as Bank One whatever you can you can
04:07 - simply give your name also okay overages
04:09 - it doesn't make any sense okay but
04:13 - normal convention is that you should
04:15 - give object name as
04:17 - so that's you can understand by looking
04:21 - at the object name what we have done
04:24 - inside this okay so we'll create a new
04:27 - bank account
04:29 - and here you can see intelligent idea is
04:31 - telling me that this
04:34 - object will require one two parameter
04:38 - that is C name and CID so I have in the
04:41 - previous videos I have told you that
04:42 - this is the Constructor which accepts a
04:45 - cname and CID and I have told you that
04:47 - whenever you create an object of the
04:50 - class it it calls the Constructor of
04:53 - that class and we have written our
04:55 - Constructor over an area of this kind of
04:57 - accept the two parameters so that's why
04:59 - we have to give two parameters to this
05:02 - program so let me just give the customer
05:05 - name as Xyz you can give your name also
05:09 - as a customer name if you want
05:11 - and again
05:14 - second parameter is CID
05:17 - so let's suppose customer ID is
05:21 - let's suppose one
05:24 - zero one okay this is the customer ID
05:27 - okay uh this is pretty much that we have
05:31 - to do and
05:33 - we can now the object is created for
05:36 - that class name bank account okay so
05:39 - using that object we can call any method
05:42 - written inside that bank account class
05:44 - okay so what are the meters written
05:46 - inside this is void deposit void
05:49 - withdraw void Gateway send action void
05:51 - show menu so one thing you tell me or
05:55 - you you decide which method I can call
05:58 - so that all the functionality of our
06:00 - application will be done inside that
06:03 - so I think there is only one method
06:06 - which uh which is there show menu method
06:09 - and which will Implement all these
06:12 - functionalities of our application here
06:15 - itself okay so I will call that method
06:18 - using the object name so for calling
06:21 - that method we will write object name
06:25 - that is bank 1 Dot
06:27 - now you can see show menu is there show
06:30 - menu okay
06:32 - so this will call that show menu method
06:35 - okay inside this okay so I guess this is
06:38 - pretty much that we have to do inside
06:40 - this project so I hope
06:43 - and this will run let me just run this
06:47 - okay it's running and now here you can
06:50 - see it is that asking me the enter the
06:52 - number of terms you want
06:54 - in the series uh wait
06:58 - I guess this running the previous
07:03 - sorry sorry guys this is running the
07:06 - previous class Java class I guess and
07:09 - now I have to run this Java class itself
07:11 - ah yes now see here you can see welcome
07:13 - XYZ your ID is zero one how this is
07:17 - doing uh we are passing x y z and zero
07:20 - one to this class Constructor and this
07:22 - Constructor is assigning that c name and
07:25 - CID value to the customer name and
07:27 - customer ID is over here okay and those
07:29 - customer IDs and customer name are
07:31 - getting printed in on the console here
07:33 - customer name and custom ID so I hope
07:35 - you guys are getting this
07:36 - and now it is asking for the option uh
07:39 - so let's suppose we have to check the
07:41 - balance and deposit the balance and we
07:42 - draw the previous transaction okay so
07:44 - we'll go one by one okay I will type A
07:48 - okay so we will check first of all let
07:50 - me check the error that we have
07:52 - rectified over here okay if I give small
07:54 - a and if I hit enter the check balance
07:57 - should be there so heat was selling
07:59 - invalid option should be invalid option
08:01 - is there uh because I guess this is not
08:04 - working here
08:07 - why it is not working I don't get it
08:10 - okay let it be uh I will Rectify this
08:12 - error and let you know in the upcoming
08:15 - videos okay uh for time now being we
08:18 - will give the capitalized inputs to the
08:20 - other application okay capital a
08:23 - so now here you can see balance is zero
08:25 - it's showing balance is zero because we
08:27 - don't have any uh done uh deposit or
08:29 - withdrawal from our account and
08:32 - initially the value of the balance
08:34 - variable that we have declared over here
08:36 - is
08:37 - zero okay that's why it is printing 0 in
08:41 - this
08:42 - console okay
08:45 - uh okay now let me just increase the
08:48 - size of the console and now if I do B B
08:52 - what is the B deposit uh enter the
08:55 - amount that you want to deposit let's
08:57 - suppose I have to deposit 1000 rupees or
08:59 - thousand dollars in my account okay and
09:01 - then if I hit enter
09:04 - uh now 1000 rupees or thousand dollars I
09:07 - uh deposited in my account now if I do
09:10 - option A that is view balance now here
09:13 - you can see balance is thousand
09:15 - previously it was selling that balance
09:16 - is zero now the balance is 1000 okay
09:20 - uh one second guys
09:25 - so now we have checked the balance that
09:28 - is 1000
09:30 - so we have implemented the check balance
09:32 - and deposit now if I want to withdraw
09:34 - money from my account I have to give
09:37 - input as C
09:39 - um C and uh how do you draw about 1000.
09:46 - okay now it suppose not thousand
09:49 - five hundred and now if I check the
09:51 - balance for checking balance um when it
09:54 - is 100 and now at last I want to check
09:57 - the previous suggestion that I have done
10:00 - the
10:01 - so here you can see if I type D
10:03 - withdrawn 500 that is the thing that I
10:07 - have done previously
10:08 - so that is withdraw for the 500 from the
10:12 - account okay
10:14 - so I guess we have implemented all those
10:17 - checks now at last I have to implement e
10:21 - if I press enter
10:23 - now here you can see process finished
10:26 - with exit code 0 that is our code will
10:28 - get
10:30 - ended and you will get out of this main
10:33 - method okay so this is pretty much about
10:36 - this project I hope you have enjoyed
10:38 - this project and you know upcoming
10:41 - tutorial series we will be starting
10:43 - uh oops concept from the
10:46 - onwards videos okay thank you for
10:47 - watching this video
