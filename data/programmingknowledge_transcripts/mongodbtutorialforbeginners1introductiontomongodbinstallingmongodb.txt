00:00 - hello guys welcome to the first video on
00:02 - mongod DB tutorial for beginners now
00:06 - let's see the brief introduction of
00:08 - mongodb before we will uh try to install
00:12 - mongodb on our Windows operating system
00:15 - so what is
00:17 - mongodb mongodb is a document oriented
00:21 - nosql database that means it's not a
00:25 - relational database it's a non
00:27 - relational database Now what is the
00:30 - difference between relational database
00:32 - and non-relational database or we can
00:35 - say what is the difference between nosql
00:38 - database and SQL database now SQL
00:42 - database for example MySQL or post gr
00:46 - SQL has a relational database format for
00:50 - example they have tables columns and
00:54 - rows which are related to each other
00:57 - right but in no SQL database these uh
01:01 - you know collections or these data are
01:06 - not related with each other and they are
01:09 - non relational right now mongodb is a
01:13 - schema free database and it's based on
01:16 - binary Json format and this special
01:20 - format is called B in which b stand for
01:25 - binary and s o n comes from Json now
01:29 - mongodb organizes itself in a group of
01:32 - documents which are called collections
01:36 - right and using mongodb Auto sharding in
01:40 - order to you know scale horizontally is
01:43 - easier and this is the advanced feature
01:46 - which we are going to see later and
01:49 - mongodb uses query language which is a
01:52 - simple query language and it has a rich
01:56 - document based query which is little bit
01:59 - different from your normal uh you know
02:01 - relational database queries and it's uh
02:05 - opsource database right now let's see
02:09 - what is the difference between mongodb
02:12 - versus some relational databases so as I
02:17 - already told you that DB uses
02:20 - collection versus the table so in normal
02:25 - relational databases something like
02:27 - MySQL or other SQL databas is they uses
02:31 - tables but in mongodb instead of tables
02:35 - we use collections right and now inside
02:39 - these collection we have documents
02:43 - instead of rows right so in the
02:46 - relational database if you know that
02:49 - every table can contain multiple columns
02:51 - and rows we have the replacement of row
02:54 - in nosql database or mongodb especially
02:58 - which is document okay okay so
03:01 - collection is like a table document is
03:04 - like a row and field is like a column
03:09 - okay so instead of using table row and
03:12 - column terminology we are going to use
03:14 - collection document and field right and
03:18 - collection isn't strict about what goes
03:22 - inside it like your normal you know
03:26 - relational database it's a little bit
03:28 - strict what should go inside it but this
03:32 - collection isn't so strict and it's
03:36 - schema less okay so this is a small
03:40 - brief introduction about mongodb now
03:43 - let's uh download mongodb on our Windows
03:46 - operating system and let's uh dive more
03:49 - into mongodb so open your favorite
03:52 - browser and search for uh mongod DB and
03:56 - the first link which will appear here
03:58 - will be from mongod b.org just click
04:02 - this link and in here you will be able
04:05 - to see two buttons one is download
04:08 - mongodb another is mongodb cloud manager
04:12 - we want to uh click this button which is
04:14 - download
04:17 - mongodb and in here you can uh see there
04:20 - are different variants of uh you know
04:23 - downloads available for Linux Mac OS and
04:27 - Solaris we want to download it for our
04:29 - Windows operating system and in here
04:32 - they have different flavors you can see
04:35 - here we want to download it for the
04:38 - 64-bit operating system so we will just
04:40 - leave it as default and then click
04:44 - download now save uh this uh MSI file
04:48 - anywhere wherever you want to save it
04:51 - and once it's saved we will be uh ready
04:55 - to uh install mongodb on our Windows
04:58 - operating system so now this MSI file is
05:01 - downloaded so I'm going to click this
05:03 - MSI file and I'm going to minimize my
05:07 - browser and now you can see this Windows
05:10 - installer is starting and you just need
05:13 - to click next here and you just need to
05:17 - uh agree with the license terms and
05:19 - conditions and then click next and you
05:23 - just need to uh you know choose this
05:25 - complete option and then click install
05:29 - okay okay and now it's going to uh
05:32 - install mongod DB on your uh Windows
05:34 - operating system and in few seconds
05:37 - mongod DB will be installed and now you
05:39 - can see mongod DB is installed on our
05:43 - Windows operating system so we can just
05:45 - click finish now let's see where this
05:48 - mongod DB is installed on our uh Windows
05:51 - operating system so open your folder
05:54 - Explorer and go into C uh directory here
05:58 - and in here go go to program files and
06:01 - in the program files you will be able to
06:04 - uh find this mongodb folder and inside
06:08 - this mongodb folder click on server and
06:12 - then the version 3.2 and you will be
06:14 - able to see uh this bin folder here
06:18 - right and in here you can see a bunch of
06:21 - executable file now there are two
06:23 - executable files which are of interest
06:26 - for us one is do EXE and other is
06:30 - mongod d. exe now mongod D is a mongod
06:36 - demon which is going to run in the
06:38 - background and it's going to accept the
06:40 - connection from mongod DB so it's a
06:43 - background process right and this
06:47 -  exe is a command line shell from
06:51 - which you are going to work with your
06:53 - database so in order to work with
06:55 - mongodb you just need to run mongod d
06:59 - which is mongod demon in the background
07:01 - and then you can open uh shell to
07:06 - work with your datab bases right now
07:09 - let's uh see how we can uh open uh this
07:13 - uh mongod D in the command prompt so
07:18 - what you can do is you can right click
07:20 - on your start menu and open the command
07:23 - prompt and then you can uh you know go
07:28 - or browse to this path which is up to
07:32 - this bin folder or otherwise the short
07:36 - cut for uh you know opening this folder
07:39 - is hold your shift key so just hold your
07:42 - shift key and then right click your
07:44 - mouse and then you will be able to see
07:47 - this open command window here so you can
07:51 - just click this and it's going to open
07:53 - the command window in this folder and
07:57 - then in here you just need to run mongod
08:00 - D first so just write mongod d. exe and
08:07 - then press enter and it's going to uh
08:11 - you know give you this error and let's
08:14 - see what this error is so you can see uh
08:17 - it says C colon SL
08:22 - data/ DB not found so in order to work
08:26 - with uh mongod DB you need to have have
08:30 - this kind of folder structure in your C
08:32 - drive which is
08:34 - data/ DB so we are going to create this
08:37 - these uh folders inside our C drive so
08:41 - open folder Explorer once again go to
08:44 - your uh C drive and then create a new
08:48 - folder here and we are going to name it
08:51 - as data and go inside this data folder
08:55 - and create a new folder which we are
08:58 - going to name it as DB okay so data and
09:04 - DB okay so you need to have this kind of
09:07 - folder structure in order to uh you know
09:09 - work with uh mongod DB which is C data
09:14 - and DB okay so once you are uh done with
09:18 - this you can run this uh mongod D
09:21 - command once again so mongod d. exe and
09:24 - press enter and now you can see mongod D
09:29 - is is running you can just click allow
09:32 - access from here and then you can see
09:36 - this is ready to take the connection so
09:40 - I'm going to maximize it and you can see
09:42 - waiting for connections right now what
09:45 - we are going to do next is we are going
09:47 - to open one more terminal to uh you know
09:51 - open this mongod
09:53 - dotexe uh file okay so once again go to
09:57 - this folder bin folder inside DB
10:01 - right click before right click you need
10:03 - to press shift so shift and then right
10:06 - click and then open command window here
10:08 - once again and I'm going to maximize it
10:12 - this is our previous shell and this is
10:14 - our new so in here we are going to once
10:17 - again run mongod d. exe and press enter
10:22 - and now you can see here connection
10:25 - accepted here right so when you
10:29 - uh you know uh run this mongod exe is
10:34 - going to you know open this kind of
10:37 - interface and now from this interface
10:40 - you can uh connect to your databases and
10:44 - from this this is running in the
10:46 - background this other uh you know
10:49 - command prompt which runs mongod d. exe
10:53 - right so it's taking the connection and
10:56 - for testing it for example we will just
10:58 - type here
10:59 - DB and press enter and you can see we
11:02 - have a sample database here which is
11:06 - called test okay so this is all about
11:11 - installation of mongod DB in the next
11:13 - video we will learn more about mongod DB
11:16 - so stay tuned and please RIT comment
11:18 - subscribe and bye for now
