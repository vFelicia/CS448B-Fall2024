00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can download and install
00:04 - xcode on your Mac operating system so
00:07 - let's get started and let's see how we
00:08 - can do it so first of all you need to
00:11 - open the app store you can find the App
00:14 - Store icon on the doc this is the App
00:17 - Store icon so just click on that or you
00:19 - can also search for App Store in your
00:23 - Launchpad and then click on that and App
00:26 - Store will start from here just search
00:29 - for ex code and then press enter which
00:32 - is going to search for xcode and the
00:35 - result which we are uh looking for is
00:38 - this one which is called xcode developer
00:41 - tools here I'm going to click on this uh
00:45 - download button so in my case it shows
00:48 - this warning which ISS download the
00:50 - older version of xcode the current
00:52 - version requires Mac OS 13.5 or later
00:56 - but you can download the last compatible
00:58 - version because right now if I click on
01:01 - the Apple logo and then click on about
01:04 - uh this Mac I have the 13 version not
01:08 - the 13.5 so I can uh download the older
01:12 - version if you have the latest version
01:14 - of Mac OS uh you can download the latest
01:17 - version of uh compatible xcode here I'm
01:21 - going to click on download button which
01:23 - is going to start the download of the
01:26 - xcode so you can see uh this download
01:30 - has been started it's around 7 GB uh of
01:34 - download so it will take some time for
01:36 - the download to complete you can also go
01:39 - to the Launchpad and see the download
01:42 - process here you can see this download
01:45 - is going on so it's going to download
01:48 - around 7 7 GB of uh data so it'll take
01:53 - some time so just wait for the download
01:55 - to finish so once the download is
01:57 - complete it's going to start the
01:59 - installation process as you can see when
02:01 - I hover over this circle installation
02:04 - process is about 2% complete so now the
02:08 - X code is installed on my Mac operating
02:11 - system once it's installed you will be
02:13 - able to see open button in front of
02:17 - xcode also in the Launchpad you will be
02:20 - able to see this xcode icon so I'm going
02:22 - to click on this xcode icon let me
02:25 - minimize this app store and then it's
02:28 - going to start that xcode so for the
02:31 - first time when xcode starts on your Mac
02:33 - operating system it's going to ask to
02:35 - agree with the license terms and
02:37 - conditions so if you want you can read
02:40 - these license terms and conditions and
02:42 - then click on agree and then give your
02:45 - MacBooks password which you use to log
02:47 - to your Mac operating system and then
02:50 - press okay and then you will be able to
02:52 - see this kind of window which says
02:54 - select the platforms which you would
02:56 - like to develop for for now I want to
02:59 - use it for Mac OS and iOS development
03:04 - later I can also install the toolkit for
03:07 - watch Os or TV OS but for now I don't
03:10 - want that so I will just uh leave it as
03:13 - default and then click on install which
03:15 - is going to start the installation of
03:17 - additional components and you can see
03:20 - the progress bar of the installation so
03:22 - at this point I just need to wait for
03:24 - this progress bar to reach to the 100%
03:27 - Mark and once that's done xcode is going
03:30 - to launch in few seconds so you can see
03:34 - uh xcode has been
03:36 - started first of all it says what's new

03:53 - xcode starts on my Mac operating system
03:56 - I can create a new project I can clone
03:59 - an exit existing project or I can open
04:02 - the existing project so I'm going to
