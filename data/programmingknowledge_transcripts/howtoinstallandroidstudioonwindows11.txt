01:41 - installer has been started on my windows
01:43 - 11 operating system so here you just
01:46 - need to click on the next button
01:48 - and this will be the default location
01:50 - where java will be installed on your
01:53 - windows 11 operating system
01:55 - just remember this location
01:57 - so
01:58 - by default it's installed in c
02:01 - then program files then it's going to
02:03 - create a java directory in program files
02:05 - folder and then there will be a jdk 17
02:09 - folder or the name of the folder will be
02:12 - the version of jdk you are installing
02:15 - right
02:16 - so if you want to change this path just
02:18 - click on change and then change the
02:20 - destination
02:21 - otherwise if you don't have the good
02:23 - reason to change this location just

02:27 - next
02:28 - which is going to start
02:30 - the installation of java
02:32 - on your windows 11 operating system so
02:35 - at this point you just need to wait for
02:37 - this process to complete and in few
02:39 - seconds you can see the java jdk has
02:42 - been installed on my windows 11
02:45 - operating system so i'm going to close
02:47 - this window that means java is installed
02:49 - on my windows 11 operating system but
02:52 - still i have to do few things
02:54 - first of all i'm going to just go to the
02:56 - location where java is installed so just
03:00 - open your folder explorer and then go to
03:02 - the c directory and then i'm going to go
03:05 - to the program files
03:07 - where java folder is created and then in
03:09 - my case jdk 17.0.1
03:13 - is created in your case this folder name
03:15 - version can be different
03:17 - so just go
03:18 - to this folder right
03:21 - now in order to set the environment
03:23 - variable for java what you need to do
03:26 - you can just click on the search icon
03:28 - once again and then
03:30 - just type edit and here which is going
03:34 - to show you this result which is edit

03:38 - and it's going to open this kind of
03:40 - window
03:41 - you can also open this edit environment
03:43 - variable using control panel so you can

03:48 - control panel
03:49 - and then just view by category here and
03:52 - then click on system and security
03:55 - then click on system
03:57 - and then
03:58 - once the system window opens you can
04:01 - click on advanced system settings
04:03 - and then click on environment variables
04:06 - which is also going to show you the same
04:08 - window right
04:10 - so
04:11 - you can choose any method to open this
04:13 - environment variable window
04:15 - and once this is open
04:17 - you need to click on the path
04:19 - environment variable under system
04:21 - variables
04:22 - and then click on
04:23 - edit
04:25 - and here you need to add the path to
04:28 - your jdk folder binaries
04:31 - so go to the folder where we have
04:34 - installed java until jdk folder and then
04:37 - click on
04:38 - bin folder so we need to go inside the
04:41 - bin folder inside this jdk folder and
04:43 - then copy the path right so until bin
04:47 - and then copy this path from here
04:49 - go to the
04:51 - environment variable window once again
04:54 - and then you can double click here or
04:56 - you can click on new which is also going
04:59 - to show you this option
05:01 - and then just paste this path until bin
05:04 - and then press enter
05:06 - which is going to add this path to your
05:08 - environment variables click on ok so
05:11 - your java environment variable is set
05:13 - now some application also needs the java
05:16 - home environment variable on your
05:17 - windows operating system
05:19 - to
05:20 - run them so let me show you how you can
05:22 - set the java home environment variable
05:25 - also
05:26 - so you can go at the top under user
05:28 - variable
05:30 - section and then click on new here
05:32 - and then
05:33 - the variable name you need to provide
05:35 - here is
05:36 - java underscore home everything is
05:40 - capital
05:41 - just write whatever i have written here
05:44 - everything is in capital and the
05:46 - variable value will be the folder which
05:48 - we have opened which is
05:51 - jdk folder so don't go inside the bin
05:54 - folder in this case
05:56 - just copy the path until jdk folder you
06:00 - don't need to go inside the bin folder
06:02 - in this case okay and then just paste
06:04 - this path under variable values okay so
06:09 - you can see there is no bin folder added
06:12 - here only the path until the jdk folder
06:15 - click on ok
06:17 - and then click on ok and then click on
06:19 - ok which is going to set
06:21 - the environment variable for java on
06:23 - your windows 11 operating system
06:26 - now once you have installed java and set
06:29 - the environment variables
06:31 - you can use java on command line so you
06:34 - can just open the command prompt by
06:37 - typing cmd once again
06:39 - and then i can type java space hyphen
06:44 - version here
06:46 - and it's going to show me the version of
06:48 - java so you can see java version 17.0.1
06:52 - so once the installation of java jdk is
06:54 - finished we are ready to install android

12:25 - import project import and android code
12:28 - sample
12:30 - avd manager and sdk manager here right
12:33 - so let's create a new project i'm going
12:35 - to click on the new project option here
12:38 - and from here you can
12:39 - choose
12:40 - what you want to develop i'm going to
12:43 - just choose the empty activity here and

12:52 - change
12:54 - it as my
12:56 - simple
12:57 - app
12:58 - and you can also choose the language in
13:00 - which you want to develop your app
13:03 - so nowadays the default language is
13:05 - kotlin but you can also choose java from
13:08 - here so let's choose java for now
13:11 - and also you can choose
13:13 - the
13:14 - sdk so by default api 21 is selected
13:19 - which covers approximately 98 percent of
13:22 - devices
13:23 - but if you want to choose any other
13:25 - version for example i want to choose
13:27 - some newer version i can choose let's
13:30 - say the newest version here which is
13:33 - available which is api 31 but it just
13:36 - covers uh less than one percent of
13:39 - devices right
13:40 - so
13:41 - i will leave it as uh api 21 for now
13:44 - which covers approximately 98 of devices
13:47 - and then click on finish here which is
13:50 - going to start your android studio and

13:54 - just
13:55 - maximize this window here for the first
13:57 - time when your project is created
14:00 - you can see it takes some time it takes
14:03 - some time to download all the gradle
14:05 - related files and other files
14:08 - so you just need to wait for some time
14:10 - until you see the project structure here
14:13 - and you can see uh that all the

14:37 - created and all the indexing has been
14:40 - done i can minimize this window because
14:42 - i don't need it
14:44 - and when

14:56 - your android app
14:58 - and you will see activity underscore
15:01 - main.xml file where you can design your
15:05 - app right so
15:07 - you have all these components here you
15:10 - can drag and drop these components
15:12 - in your
15:14 - app and then you can use these
15:16 - components right
15:18 - but before running your app you need an
15:21 - android emulator where you will run your
15:24 - app right you have created your app but
15:27 - where this app will run on
15:30 - your device so you need to add a device
15:32 - so i'm going to click on this no device
15:35 - option and then click on avd manager
15:38 - and you can see it says virtual device
15:40 - allow you to test your application
