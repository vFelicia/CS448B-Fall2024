00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can download and install
00:03 - Jenkins on your Windows 10 operating
00:05 - system so first of all let's talk about
00:08 - the prerequisite of installing Jenkins
00:11 - on your Windows 10 operating system in
00:14 - order to install Jenkins you need to
00:15 - have Java 7 or above so make sure you
00:19 - have the latest version of Java and then
00:21 - once you have Java installed then you
00:23 - are ready to install Jenkins
00:26 - so I have already installed Java 10 on
00:28 - my Windows 10 operating system and I'm
00:30 - assuming that you also have the latest
00:32 - version of Java so once you have Java
00:34 - installed just open your favorite
00:36 - browser and search for Jenkins and the
00:38 - first language will appear here will be
00:40 - from Jenkins dot IO so we are going to
00:42 - click on this link so once you are on
00:45 - this Jenkins website you just need to
00:47 - click on the Downloads button here and
00:49 - on the downloads page you just need to
00:52 - scroll down a little don't click on
00:53 - downloads yet we are going to see which
00:56 - are the versions which are available for
00:58 - Jenkins so when you scroll down you will
01:02 - see different versions of Jenkins one is
01:05 - the LTS version and other is the weekly
01:07 - release so we are going to use the long
01:12 - term support version and the latest
01:15 - version is 2.10 7.2 and in here we are
01:19 - going to choose the windows option so
01:22 - here you will see the windows option now
01:25 - one thing you need to keep in mind is
01:27 - when you are installing Jenkins on
01:29 - Windows it is good to run Jenkins as a
01:32 - service so it starts automatically
01:35 - without requiring any user to log in the
01:39 - easiest way to install Jenkins on
01:42 - Windows is by using Windows installer
01:45 - but if you are an advanced user you can
01:49 - also download the Jenkins food war file
01:52 - and then you can deploy it on servlets
01:57 - like GlassFish or tomcat but for our
02:01 - purpose we want to just learn so we are
02:03 - going to use the windows installer so
02:07 - I'm going to just click on windows here
02:09 - and once you click on windows option you
02:11 - will see
02:12 - this message which says thank you for
02:14 - downloading windows stable installer and
02:17 - you can see here if you download it as a
02:19 - zip file so I'm going to wait for the
02:21 - download to complete so now the download
02:23 - of this zip file is completed so I'm
02:25 - going to minimize the browser and I'm
02:26 - going to go to my downloads folder where
02:29 - I have downloaded this zip file and now
02:31 - I'm going to just open this zip file and
02:34 - in here I will be able to see this
02:37 - windows installer package so I'm going
02:40 - to double click on this windows
02:41 - installer package which is going to
02:43 - start the Jenkins installation so I'm
02:46 - going to minimize this folder Explorer
02:48 - and you can see Jenkins 2.10 7.2 setup
02:53 - window so on this welcome window we
02:56 - don't need to do anything we just need
02:57 - to click Next here and this will be the
03:00 - default location where Jenkins will be
03:02 - installed so if you don't have the good
03:03 - reason to change it just leave it as
03:06 - default and then click Next and then
03:09 - click install and then just click yes
03:12 - which is going to start installing
03:14 - Jenkins and in the end you will see this
03:16 - message which says completed the Jenkins
03:19 - setup wizard click finish button to exit
03:22 - the setup wizard so I'm going to click
03:24 - finish
03:24 - so now Jenkins is installed on your
03:26 - system and it will ask in which browser
03:29 - you want to open it so I'm going to
03:31 - click on Google Chrome and you can see
03:36 - on a port localhost 8080 you will be
03:40 - able to see this kind of window so if
03:43 - this window doesn't open automatically
03:45 - you just need to go to your favorite
03:47 - browser and then just write localhost
03:50 - colon 8080 so let's copy this here and
03:55 - just paste it here so HTTP colon forward
03:59 - slash forward slash localhost colon 8080
04:02 - the default port is port 8080 and I'm
04:06 - going to just click on this and then you
04:08 - will be able to see this kind of window
04:10 - ok so if it doesn't open automatically
04:13 - you can just browse on localhost port
04:15 - 8080 now first thing in order to unlock
04:18 - Jenkins you just need to provide the
04:21 - initial admin password and this password
04:24 - is
04:25 - set in this directory so just copy this
04:29 - part here and then I'm going to open my
04:33 - folder Explorer and I'm going to paste
04:35 - this path and you will see this file
04:38 - here which is initial admin password so
04:42 - you just need to open this initial admin
04:45 - password here so I'm going to just open
04:48 - it into my editor so I'm going to open
04:51 - it in the notepad and you just need to
04:54 - copy this initial password and then I'm
04:56 - going to minimize this window and I'm
04:59 - going to provide my initial password and
05:02 - then click continue now in the next step
05:04 - you will see a customized Jenkins window
05:08 - so there are two options here installed
05:10 - suggested plugins and the second option
05:13 - is select plugins to install so I'm
05:16 - going to choose this option which says
05:17 - install suggested plugins which is going
05:20 - to install the most suggested plugins in
05:23 - your Jenkins installation so you can
05:26 - just click on install suggested plugins
05:29 - and this is going to start installing
05:31 - the suggested plugins so you can see
05:34 - there is a plugin for get here there is
05:37 - a plugin for subversion plugin for
05:40 - github LDAP email extension and some
05:44 - other plugins so right now I don't have
05:47 - get installed on my system or LDAP
05:49 - installed on my system or even as a such
05:52 - slave so if it shows some error it's
05:55 - okay
05:56 - so once all the plugins are successfully
05:59 - installed on your Jenkins you will be
06:02 - automatically redirected to this page
06:05 - which says create first admin user so
06:09 - you just need to create the admin user
06:12 - credentials here so user name let's say
06:15 - I'm going to take it as admin here and
06:18 - password whatever you want I'm going to
06:21 - give some password and then I'm going to
06:24 - confirm my password and here I'm going
06:27 - to give the full name for example admin
06:31 - once again and the next thing is email
06:34 - so I'm going to provide the email and
06:36 - after providing each and every credit
06:39 - you just need to click Save and finish
06:41 - which is going to say Jenkins is ready
06:44 - start using Jenkins so I'm going to just
06:47 - click on this button which says start
06:49 - using Jenkins and you will see this kind
06:54 - of window so if you see this kind of
06:56 - window that means Jenkins is fully
06:58 - installed on your system and Jenkins is
07:02 - running on your system now if you want
07:05 - to see more about Jenkins you will be
07:08 - able to see it inside your C directory
07:11 - and inside the C direct you just need to
07:14 - go to Program Files x86 and there will
07:17 - be a Jenkins folder here and inside
07:19 - Jenkins folder all the plugins are there
07:22 - so you can see the plugins folder and
07:24 - all the plugins are here and all the
07:29 - files related to Jenkins will be stored
