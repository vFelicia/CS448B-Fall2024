00:00 - hey all welcome to programming knowledge
00:02 - this is a second tutorial of pi PI QT
00:04 - which we'll be looking at set up and the
00:06 - initial steps of doing the program which
00:09 - is the process of doing a program so let
00:12 - us know start off with what we have seen
00:15 - in that last tutorial we have seen what
00:17 - is pi QT and what are the things
00:19 - available in piety like a hoe over how
00:22 - we are going to use that pi QT libraries
00:24 - in order to make sure that you create a
00:27 - good graphical applications along with
00:29 - the support of packet systems and
00:31 - graphical controls so let's now go ahead
00:33 - and set up the pyqt by following the
00:38 - three steps the first step we are going
00:40 - to do is like we'll go to this mention
00:43 - website which is HTTP colon double slash
00:46 - p bi bi dot o-r-g slash project slash
00:49 - pyqt of five so we are going to type
00:52 - this address in the like google chrome
00:55 - and then after the website opens like
00:59 - we'll be having a installation tab in
01:01 - that we will find the command called pip
01:03 - install of py QT 5 so we are going to
01:07 - use this command in anaconda command
01:11 - line or Python command prompt line like
01:15 - we are going to use this command to
01:18 - install the pyqt library which will
01:20 - enable us to create the programs for
01:22 - creating graphical applications so let's
01:26 - now go ahead and like set up the pyqt
01:29 - we're following the steps as I have
01:34 - already opened the web page as you can
01:38 - see so here there are so many tabs
01:41 - available you can see the project
01:42 - description then you have autolysis
01:44 - documentation documentation if you want
01:47 - any documentation of the pyqt you can
01:49 - just download it from by clicking here
01:51 - over here then as I say it another
01:55 - installations tab we have py p IP
01:57 - install of py q 2 5 so we are going to
02:01 - copy this and let's is for the pyqt
02:10 - library
02:13 - so it's it's going to take some time as
02:15 - we are downloading like we are going to
02:20 - install the pyqt right so it's
02:21 - downloading from the website and it's
02:23 - getting installed so it will take a
02:25 - little bit of time so we are going to
02:27 - wait for these two hour to get installed
02:31 - after that like we'll start creating the
02:34 - first program so here we go we have
02:45 - plugins for the PI QT 5 library file and
02:51 - no let's go and look at the sample code
02:56 - for getting a sample application with an
02:59 - example so we know what they are going
03:07 - to do we are going to discuss a sim for
03:09 - creating a simple GUI application that
03:12 - is the steps so therefore there five
03:15 - steps involved including a simple GUI
03:17 - application so I am going to create a
03:20 - simple GUI application in which we are
03:24 - going to display a window along with a
03:26 - header called pyqt phi simple window in
03:29 - which will be having minimize maximize
03:31 - and close option button because of shunt
03:36 - app now let's go ahead and check out
03:39 - like will start discuss about the code
03:41 - that we are going to use on creating
03:44 - that application so these are the five
03:47 - steps we are going to use for creating
03:48 - that simpler first we'll import pyqt
03:52 - module in which will be having certain
03:55 - things that needs to be imported for
03:56 - creating the application followed by
03:59 - will be defining a method in this method
04:01 - will define the size like top down right
04:05 - left all the subs will be defined over
04:07 - this method and that said we have what
04:09 - we are going to raise we are going to
04:11 - define a separate method for the title
04:13 - which is going to dispute is going to be
04:15 - displayed on top of the screen next we
04:19 - are going to display the application by
04:21 - using the show method which is a work
04:25 - called show we use the
04:26 - to application lastly we are going to
04:29 - create the main method to run the
04:31 - application these are the five steps
04:33 - required to create that simple G
04:36 - application now let's go ahead and
04:39 - discuss one by one what are the stuffs
04:42 - that are going to be defined inside this
04:44 - first we will discuss about the import
04:46 - by by pyqt module let's go give go ahead
04:50 - and check out that so here we go this is
04:56 - the first step we are going to do like
04:58 - we are going to import pyqt module
05:00 - inside this we inside this we are going
05:03 - to define three things first we'll
05:06 - import the SIS which is a system
05:09 - followed by we are going to import q
05:11 - application and Q which yield from pyqt
05:15 - Phi dot Qt widgets it will be used
05:19 - lastly we are going to import q icon
05:22 - which is available in like from pyqt phi
05:26 - dot g QT g i which comes with a camp
05:29 - called its interface so these are the
05:31 - three things you are going to if I on
05:33 - under I am want be like UT model let's
05:36 - go ahead and see what is the second step
05:38 - I can save as I have told you earlier is
05:40 - defining a method so here in this method
05:44 - what we are going to do we are going to
05:46 - set the title pyqt file simple window
05:49 - and along with that you are going to you
05:52 - find the left top width height and
05:56 - lastly initializing the UI which is in
06:00 - it you are by using the self keyword so
06:03 - here we go like as though as we follow
06:06 - the common rule which is first looking
06:08 - at the class so I have defined the class
06:11 - as and class name as app and inside the
06:15 - paranthesis am called on the Q widget
06:17 - which have imported from pyqt Phi dot QT
06:21 - widgets then then I have defined the
06:24 - like the method has been defined as
06:26 - initialized by using this d EF
06:29 - underscore disclose initialize which is
06:32 - INAT and inside that self commit No
06:36 - and super method has been used followed
06:40 - by Titan left of width height and lastly
06:43 - initializing UI so we are going to do
06:45 - like by the code for these things in
06:48 - defining a method so what is it that
06:51 - thing you are going to do you are going
06:53 - to define a method for tighter let's go
06:55 - and check out the define a method for
06:58 - tighter so inside this I am going to use
07:03 - initially the method as a nit UI and
07:07 - inside the parentheses I have used the
07:10 - keyword as self so by using the self
07:13 - keyword what I am going to do self door
07:16 - set window title as self not title which
07:20 - is the title will be taken which is self
07:24 - dot title as pyqt five simple window
07:26 - that will be displayed inside the window
07:30 - title followed by what I'm going to do I
07:33 - am going to use self dot set geometry
07:35 - and he said the parentheses I am going
07:37 - to call self dot left Tom third or big
07:41 - answer broad height which is 10 10 640
07:44 - and 480 so these are the things here I
07:47 - am going to define s at the drama tree
07:50 - and lastly I am going to use the the
07:53 - last method which is the fourth method
07:57 - which I have defined as displaying
07:59 - application you can show method so I
08:01 - have used the show method as served or
08:03 - show to like its application and lastly
08:09 - we are going to use the main method to
08:11 - run the application let's go ahead and
08:13 - check out the main method so I have
08:16 - created the main method by defining if
08:18 - underscore disco name underscore
08:20 - underscore equals equals to main and
08:23 - inside that I have used the object
08:25 - called I a PP AB equals to I've used the
08:28 - Q application which we have used in
08:33 - import pyqt module which you have taken
08:35 - from py codified on creating widgets so
08:39 - what will happen I have used the Q
08:42 - application inside that system that sees
08:45 - door argv
08:46 - which have you which I am going to pass
08:49 - on and last
08:50 - didn't people called e.x inside that I'm
08:54 - going to use the a PP like method which
08:59 - is a profit and lastly I'm going to exit
09:04 - the program by using a PP dot execute
09:08 - underscore followed by the packets so
09:12 - here we go
09:13 - no like what will happen of running this
09:18 - program a simple pyqt fire like the
09:23 - window will be opened along with the
09:25 - icons of clothes minimize and maximize
09:28 - with the header which is py q defy
09:30 - simple window which we have defined so
09:34 - this is the overall code for getting the
09:37 - output as expected of output as P by Q
09:41 - define simple window as you can see
09:43 - first be imported then we created the
09:45 - class then we define the method inside
09:48 - that we have defined the title left of
09:50 - width height and lastly like
09:53 - initializing you are i an ID UI then
09:57 - followed by for window title we have
10:00 - defined the method as in init UI and
10:03 - inside that we have used the self
10:04 - keyword and I said the window title and
10:07 - taken the self dot title which we have
10:09 - defined pyqt pi simple window inside the
10:12 - parentheses on set window title then we
10:15 - use the geometry and called on the self
10:17 - dot left and self dot table set dot B
10:20 - ten self not height it is 1010 640 and
10:22 - 480 and lastly we have used the show
10:25 - with her to like display the application
10:29 - and inside the main method we are going
10:30 - to run the application by using the
10:32 - queue application and inside the
10:35 - parentheses as following by save dot
10:37 - argument which you see RGB and you did a
10:40 - sample like like a variable called
10:42 - EXN centered Eastwood AB and lastly in
10:47 - the system exiting the system so here we
10:51 - go after running these up code what will
10:53 - happen this will be displayed now let's
10:56 - go ahead and run the code so before
10:59 - running the code I'll suggest you to is
11:01 - on the by cutie
11:03 - in a PI charm if you are using the
11:06 - PyCharm ID for running the code so for
11:09 - doing that you need to go to settings
11:11 - and go to project interpreter and you'll
11:16 - have pi QT 5 and pi good if I save and
11:20 - buy QT 5 steps you need to install all
11:23 - these three packages by just clicking by
11:26 - the double clicking on that I'm clicking
11:27 - on the install package once you are
11:29 - picking on install package the package
11:31 - will get installed so in order to get
11:34 - these things you need to do you need to
11:36 - walk on the terminal which is by
11:38 - clicking on that and providing the code
11:41 - as VIP install PI K t-55 by doing so you
11:49 - will get installed your PI 35 so let's
11:53 - go ahead and run the code as we
11:56 - discussed in the last tutorial there are
11:58 - five steps for creating a simple window
12:00 - app that is the first step is input by
12:05 - QT module where you need to where you
12:07 - will be inputting the system followed by
12:09 - you'll be inputting Q application
12:11 - qwidget and Q icon from PI PD Phi dot Q
12:14 - widgets and QT GUI let's copy these and
12:18 - run the code if I am copying it and I'm
12:23 - going to paste in I D I so here we go we
12:28 - have used the required libraries and the
12:33 - next step what we are going to do is we
12:35 - are going to define a method where we
12:36 - will define the title left or fits our
12:39 - hide and followed by creating a one
12:41 - moment creating a method call init UI
12:45 - so we will go we are going to copy this
12:47 - and paste the code accordingly here we
12:52 - go so what happens over here we have
12:57 - opened the class and use the Q widget
13:00 - which we have imported inside the app
13:03 - parentheses and define the method called
13:06 - initialize which is in it underscored
13:09 - escrow in it under squander score and
13:10 - inside the parentheses we have used a
13:12 - self keyword and use the superclass to
13:15 - make sure to
13:16 - accessible of title left of his height
13:18 - in the method of any TI which we are
13:21 - going to get it now so this is the first
13:25 - method we have created it in which we
13:27 - are defined I turn left off width and
13:29 - height now we are going to define the
13:32 - second method which is which will be
13:35 - defining the title and using the cell or
13:38 - title self dot left self dot top cell
13:41 - dot with and self dot height which we
13:43 - have defined in the first method of
13:45 - initializing like defined definition of
13:49 - any so let's go ahead and copy this code
13:57 - here we go so we have finally defined
14:00 - the init UI which is referring to this
14:03 - so we have defined that I need you I and
14:06 - insert the practices we have used the
14:08 - self keyword and by using self dot said
14:12 - window title and inside the parentheses
14:14 - we have if we are referring to this pi
14:17 - codify simple window which is the header
14:19 - of the window and followed by by using
14:22 - set geometry we are defining himself God
14:25 - left self dot top and central bay that
14:28 - self out height which have been defined
14:30 - in the first method which is this one
14:32 - door left off width and height and
14:34 - lastly we are going to use the circuit
14:38 - so to make sure to enable the window app
14:43 - and we are going to create the main
14:48 - method in which we are going to define
14:50 - the app and a variable called X in which
14:53 - we are going to store the app method AB
14:55 - class and lastly we are going to use v
14:58 - dot exit with the system detects it and
15:00 - inside the parenthesis we are going to
15:02 - like call the app which is this Q
15:05 - application and system not argv so this
15:09 - is referring to this so it is referring
15:11 - to this app toward execute underscore
15:14 - and followed by closing the bracket
15:17 - let's go ahead and copy this code
15:27 - get over here so here we go we'll just
15:41 - make some arrangements here we go we
15:47 - have made the arrangements and defined
15:50 - if as well so we have defined the main
15:53 - method and inside the main method we
15:56 - have created an object collab in which
15:59 - we have used the cue application which I
16:02 - have imported from cute pie to defy
16:05 - dorky widgets and inside the parentheses
16:07 - we have forwarding the cyst which you
16:09 - have imported dot argument which is here
16:12 - GV so here we go and then lastly we have
16:17 - created a variable called s in Matias
16:19 - for that and lastly we are going to
16:22 - execute the by prodding sees dot app
16:25 - it's it and inside the process we have
16:27 - ordered the you have call on the app
16:29 - which is this dot execute underscore
16:32 - back by closing the bracket let let's
16:37 - now go ahead and run the program and see
16:39 - whether we get the window in which we
16:42 - have the pie to defy simple window
16:44 - header we are going to run this program
16:51 - let's no wider than the program and look
16:54 - for the output here we go we have got
16:58 - the output he's a PI to defer a simple
17:01 - window and with along with minimize
17:04 - maximize and the close option so we have
17:07 - created the simple big pie codifies like
17:10 - simple window using pi 25
17:15 - so the
17:17 - for today meanwhile I'll explain more
17:20 - the core what happened so in the main
17:23 - application we have : the app so what
17:27 - will happen it will come over here like
17:29 - it will print out the pie qt5 simple
17:32 - window as a header along with cell
17:34 - brought left off we can hide out the
17:37 - 1010 640 and 480 and inside the unit UI
17:41 - we are using the search window title and
17:44 - set geometry inside that as told earlier
17:46 - which is cell rotator top-left with
17:49 - height and everything like we are going
17:52 - to define it inside the parentheses and
17:54 - we are going to use the show till dot
17:56 - show to make sure to enable the window
18:00 - so here we go we have got the output
18:02 - which is a PI 25 simple window yeah we
18:06 - can maximize then minimize and at the
18:09 - end of it i can close the application
18:10 - also so that's it for today thank you
18:16 - for joining with programming knowledge
18:17 - see you in next tutorials bye guys
