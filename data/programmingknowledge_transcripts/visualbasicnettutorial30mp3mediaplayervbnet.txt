00:00 - hello guys welcome once again in the
00:02 - last video I have shown you how to add a
00:04 - window media player tool in
00:07 - your Visual Basic Windows Form
00:10 - application and I have also shown you
00:11 - how to load start stop and pause the
00:13 - video in this video I will show you how
00:16 - to make a simple mp3 player with the
00:19 - help of this uh window media player tool
00:23 - so let's get started first of all what I
00:25 - will do is I will take a list box and
00:28 - drag and drop into my
00:31 - form and I'm going to take a
00:35 - button to load the list once
00:38 - again and I will take a open file
00:42 - dialogue to open and select all the
00:46 - selected file so I will drag and drop
00:48 - open file dialogue into my form and it
00:50 - will go here this was the open file
00:53 - dialogue from the last video and this is
00:55 - new open file dialogue which is open
00:58 - file dialogue 2 now we will change the
01:00 - name of this button as
01:06 - uh
01:08 - load
01:11 - playlist okay and now what I will do is
01:15 - I will select my open file dialogue
01:18 - which I'm going to use and I will go to
01:20 - the property and in here I will search
01:24 - for the property called multi- select
01:26 - and make this property as true okay so
01:30 - just go to the property called multi
01:32 - select and make it true now I will just
01:37 - select my load playlist button and
01:39 - double click it and in
01:42 - here I will write the code but first of
01:46 - all I want to uh declare some Global
01:49 - variables so I will just go above my sub
01:55 - and here I will declare two arrays so I
01:58 - will write dim
02:04 - them
02:06 - path
02:08 - paths
02:12 - as
02:14 - string and
02:17 - this bracket will tell this string is a
02:21 - array so this is a string array I have
02:24 - declared and once again I will copy this
02:27 - and paste it here and instead of PA I
02:30 - will
02:31 - say file name
02:35 - okay uh so I have declared
02:39 - two string arrays and now I will go
02:43 - inside my Buttle click event and I will
02:47 - write
02:49 - if my open file
02:55 - dialogue open file dialog 2 this
02:58 - time do
03:02 - show
03:05 - dialogue equal
03:09 - to dialog
03:12 - result dot
03:15 - okay then what I will do
03:18 - is in here I will copy the path of the
03:22 - file and I will copy the file name of
03:28 - the selected paths so what I will do is
03:32 - I will copy this path
03:34 - and paste it
03:37 - here and I will say paths is equal
03:41 - to open file dialogue 2 which is my open
03:46 - file dialog name dot save file names
03:50 - with the last letter as s so it's
03:54 - multiple
03:56 - files
03:58 - okay so it's
04:00 - names and same I will do for file names
04:04 - it will be good when I add here
04:07 - s okay and once again I will copy file
04:12 - names is equal to open file dialog 2 dot
04:19 - file names with the last letter s
04:24 - okay now I will declare a for Loop so
04:28 - I'll write
04:32 - for I is equal to
04:38 - 0
04:41 - to my file name
04:46 - length but first of all I need to
04:48 - declare it as integer so I will write
04:57 - as integer
05:00 - okay so two my file names uh array
05:07 - dot
05:10 - length minus one so I will count all the
05:14 - file
05:15 - names and then what I will do is I will
05:19 - add this these file names to my list box
05:22 - so I will copy the name of my list
05:26 - box and I will write here Dot
05:32 - items
05:33 - do
05:35 - add and inside the bracket I will
05:39 - write file
05:42 - names and once again uh bracket and I
05:47 - will pass this I
05:49 - here so what this code will do is I will
05:52 - it will load all the files inside the
05:56 - list box okay now we will go to
06:02 - this uh form again and this time I will
06:06 - select the list box and double click my
06:09 - list box so just select your list box
06:11 - and double click it and it will go to
06:13 - the list box selected index change event
06:16 - and in here I will copy the name of my
06:19 - window media player tool which is ax
06:23 - window Media Player
06:24 - 1 and paste it here
06:27 - dot URL
06:30 - is equal
06:34 - to parts and in the bracket I will write
06:39 - list box
06:42 - name list box one
06:47 - dot selected
06:49 - index okay so this is my
06:54 - code and what this will do is it
06:58 - will play
07:00 - whatever uh song I will select from the
07:03 - list box so let's see how it works this
07:06 - is the whole code
07:08 - for the MP3 player so first of all I
07:12 - want to load the playlist so I will
07:15 - click click this
07:16 - button and let me search for the music
07:20 - somewhere
07:24 - here and
07:26 - playlists no I don't have it here
07:30 - and I have some playlist here so I will
07:34 - select three songs from here I can multi
07:37 - select these songs because I have
07:39 - checked the option in the open file
07:41 - dialogue that I can multi select these
07:44 - songs and when I click okay it'll load
07:47 - all the uh songs in here and when I
07:51 - click this um button here or when I
07:55 - click this uh first path it'll
08:00 - open the first
08:05 - playlist and you will observe that
08:07 - nothing is happening because I think I
08:10 - have done a little
08:12 - mistake instead of this path this part
08:15 - should be here and this file name should
08:19 - be here
08:21 - so in the file name variable I'm going
08:24 - to take the names of the file which will
08:28 - give which is given by this variable and
08:31 - file name path is given by this variable
08:34 - so I have exchanged these two things so
08:36 - just correct uh this declaration and
08:39 - once again I will run the program and I
08:42 - will load my playlist I can multi select
08:45 - it from here and now I can see the names
08:48 - of my playlist and when I click the
08:50 - first
08:52 - song it will play the first song so I
08:55 - have muted this um song and when I
08:59 - second song it will play the second song
09:01 - and when I select the third song it will
09:03 - play the third song So in this way you
09:05 - can make a simple mp3 player with the
09:07 - help of your window media player tool I
09:10 - hope you have enjoyed this video please
