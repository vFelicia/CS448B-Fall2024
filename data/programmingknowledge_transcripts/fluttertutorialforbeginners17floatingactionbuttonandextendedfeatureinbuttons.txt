00:00 - welcome to programming knowledge so in
00:03 - this video we are going to discuss about
00:05 - the last
00:06 - type of button and that is floating
00:08 - action button
00:10 - okay so to add a floating action button
00:12 - after
00:13 - the body we have another named argument
00:17 - that is floating action button
00:21 - and it takes a floating action button
00:24 - with chat
00:25 - okay and it has a child
00:29 - okay and the child also takes a widget
00:31 - and for now i'll just give an icon
00:34 - i can say i can add and as it is a
00:38 - button it also needs an on pressed
00:40 - method and
00:41 - for now i'll simply print
00:44 - in my console floating action button
00:48 - pressed okay this should be inside
00:51 - quotes
00:57 - okay so now first i'll format it and
01:01 - then if i
01:02 - run i should be able to see a floating
01:05 - action button on my screen
01:06 - okay and you can see that the floating
01:09 - action button with the plus icon
01:11 - appears at the bottom right of the
01:14 - screen and that is the
01:16 - place where the floating action button
01:19 - is
01:19 - placed in android and as well as in
01:22 - ios okay so now
01:26 - this also has all the same
01:28 - functionalities
01:29 - like other buttons that is it takes a
01:31 - child
01:32 - it has an on press which takes a
01:35 - function
01:35 - that returns void okay then it has a
01:39 - background color
01:40 - okay and if you don't give any color
01:42 - then it will be blue which is the
01:44 - default color of any flutter application
01:47 - okay and you can also change it to any
01:50 - color you like
01:51 - okay like now i am changing it to red
01:54 - and you can see the color has changed
01:56 - to red now one more thing that i wanted
01:59 - to tell you about colors
02:01 - that we can change the intensity of
02:04 - that color if we want okay so for that
02:08 - all we need to do is inside square
02:10 - brackets
02:11 - if we write 300 then the intensity would
02:14 - be a little bit
02:15 - less okay and you can see that
02:18 - now if i write 100 it will be lesser
02:24 - okay so i am missing this over here
02:27 - let's run this and you can see the
02:31 - intensity has become
02:32 - more lighter now if i change it to 900
02:36 - then the intensity will increase
02:38 - and the color will appear much darker
02:41 - okay so the
02:41 - standard if we don't
02:45 - write any number then the standard
02:47 - number that is by default use this
02:50 - 500 okay and you can see that
02:55 - then the next thing in floating action
02:57 - button is the
02:58 - tool tip okay and that is similarly
03:02 - a string that is displayed when we long
03:05 - press on the button
03:07 - okay so let's say tool tip
03:10 - now let's run this
03:14 - now if i press and hold so i'm able to
03:17 - see the
03:18 - tool tip that is the text in my tool tip
03:22 - argument okay so this was also the basic
03:25 - about floating action button
03:28 - now the next thing about floating action
03:30 - button is that sometimes
03:32 - instead of just an icon we also want a
03:35 - text
03:35 - alongside means next to the icon okay so
03:38 - then we can use the extended feature
03:41 - okay so for that we just need to write
03:43 - extended and extended doesn't take a
03:46 - child but it takes
03:48 - two other two different arguments first
03:51 - is the
03:52 - icon and the second one is text
03:56 - sorry it would be label yes so it takes
03:59 - a label
04:00 - and label takes a widget
04:03 - so we will pass our text widget okay and
04:06 - let's
04:07 - let the text say add you know again i
04:10 - format it and save it
04:12 - so now i should see a plus
04:15 - and then add written next to it and you
04:17 - can see that
04:18 - okay so this is how we can modify our
04:21 - floating action button
04:23 - okay now the next thing that i missed
04:26 - while discussing about flat button and
04:29 - rest button was that
04:31 - they also have a extended feature okay
04:34 - so let's
04:35 - discuss about that so coming to flat
04:38 - button we have
04:40 - we simply write flat button and dot
04:43 - icon okay so now this means that the
04:46 - flat button will first have an icon
04:48 - and then a label okay not just a child
04:51 - that takes a widget but it takes
04:54 - two different things first one is icon
04:56 - and the second one is
04:58 - a label okay so let's give it an icon
05:01 - i can say i can inside an
05:04 - icon widget from the icon cinema and
05:07 - let's say android for now
05:09 - okay and the label is let's see what the
05:12 - label takes and the label takes a widget
05:14 - so we will pass a
05:16 - text widget okay and it says
05:19 - android okay and on pressed is simply a
05:26 - console logging that is
05:30 - button pressed okay
05:34 - now let's format it and save it
05:37 - and let's see okay so now you can see we
05:41 - have the flat button that is
05:43 - for and it has an icon and then the text
05:46 - okay so now it is not as we expected
05:49 - because we are using a
05:51 - ink okay so we don't need an ink right
05:54 - now
05:56 - i'll just remove it from here
05:59 - now let's run this so now that bluish
06:02 - background
06:03 - should be gone okay so this is our
06:06 - flat button but in a extended form that
06:09 - is by using this
06:10 - icon constructor okay now if i press
06:13 - this the functionality is same
06:15 - okay and the same goes for
06:19 - raised button okay so if i write
06:22 - rest button then it also has an extended
06:25 - constructor that
06:26 - is the dot icon constructor and it takes
06:29 - two things icons and label
06:31 - and rest all the features are same so
06:34 - let's see
06:35 - this also
06:38 - and you can see that let's apply some
06:40 - color so that it is
06:42 - more evident
06:46 - i'm sorry because it's not red
06:49 - so formatted save it
06:54 - and you can see that this is our
06:57 - raised button but it now ha instead of
06:59 - having a single child widget it has two
07:01 - things
07:02 - first one is icon and the second one is
07:04 - text
07:05 - and the functionality is intact okay so
07:08 - this was all about buttons
07:11 - in the next video we should discuss
07:14 - about some
07:14 - other widgets thank you
