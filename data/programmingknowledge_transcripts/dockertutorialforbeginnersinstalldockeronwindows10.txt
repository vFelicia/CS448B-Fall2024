00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - docker tutorial for beginners in this
00:04 - video we are going to see how we can
00:06 - download and install docker on our
00:09 - windows 10 operating system
00:11 - so let's get started first of all open
00:14 - your favorite browser and search for
00:16 - docker
00:17 - but before installing docker desktop
00:20 - application on our windows operating
00:22 - system
00:23 - let's see what are the system
00:25 - requirements for installing this
00:27 - application
00:28 - so before going to the docker.com
00:32 - website i'm going to search on my
00:34 - browser install docker windows which
00:37 - will open this link from
00:41 - docs.docker.com forward slash docker for
00:43 - windows
00:45 - and this link i'm going to put in the
00:47 - description of the video also so you can
00:50 - also
00:51 - see all the description here
00:53 - and
00:54 - from here you can click this button
00:57 - which is going to redirect you
00:59 - to the downloads page but before that
01:02 - let's see what are the system
01:03 - requirements for downloading this
01:06 - application so as you can see here for
01:09 - installing docker on your windows
01:11 - operating system
01:12 - you need to have at least windows 10
01:15 - 64-bit pro enterprise or education
01:18 - version
01:19 - and
01:20 - hyper-v and containers windows feature
01:24 - must be enabled and some other
01:26 - requirements are 64-bit processor with
01:29 - second level
01:30 - address
01:31 - translation 4gb system ram and bios
01:35 - level hardware virtualization system
01:37 - must be enabled
01:39 - in bios settings so if you don't have
01:42 - windows 10 64-bit pro version or
01:45 - enterprise or education version
01:47 - then also you can install docker on your
01:50 - windows operating system but the
01:53 - procedure will be little different
01:56 - so for that you can go to suspended
01:59 - products and tools
02:01 - and then go to
02:03 - this
02:04 - tool which is called docker toolbox
02:06 - which is now a legacy for
02:09 - legacy operating systems so here you can
02:12 - just click on the install toolbox on
02:15 - windows button i'm going to just open
02:17 - this link in the next tab
02:20 - and here
02:21 - you can
02:22 - follow the procedure of installing
02:25 - docker toolbox on your
02:28 - other windows operating system for
02:30 - example if you have windows 10 home
02:33 - version or if you have windows 8 or
02:36 - windows 7 then you can install docker
02:39 - toolbox so first of all how to check
02:42 - which windows 10 version you have if you
02:46 - have windows 10 operating system running
02:50 - so for that what you can do is you can
02:52 - just right click on this windows button
02:55 - and then click on run
02:57 - and then just type win ver w i n v e r
03:03 - and then click ok which is going to open
03:06 - this kind of window and here you can
03:08 - find
03:09 - the windows
03:11 - 10 version you are running so as you can
03:14 - see here i'm running windows 10 pro
03:17 - version also the second requirement was
03:21 - let's see the second requirement which
03:23 - is hyper-v and containers windows
03:26 - features
03:27 - must be enabled so how to verify that so
03:31 - to check that the simple procedure is
03:34 - just right click on your toolbar windows
03:37 - toolbar and then
03:39 - click on task manager
03:42 - so once this task manager opens you just
03:45 - need to go to the performance section
03:49 - and then you need to verify
03:51 - this section which is called
03:53 - virtualization
03:55 - it needs to be enabled by default
03:59 - it is enabled on your windows 10
04:01 - operating system so you don't need to do
04:03 - any extra thing unless you have
04:06 - manually disabled this feature so now
04:10 - i'm going to click this button which
04:11 - says download from docker hub
04:14 - and here you will see
04:17 - this web page first so first of all you
04:20 - need to create a docker id if you
04:23 - haven't already have a docker id you can
04:26 - just click on this sign up link here
04:29 - which will open this kind of web page
04:32 - and here you can create your docker
04:34 - account which requires a docker id email
04:38 - address and password and you need to
04:41 - just agree these terms and conditions so
04:44 - once you have your docker id which i
04:46 - already have i'm going to sign into
04:49 - my docker account which is going to
04:52 - redirect me to this page which is the
04:56 - downloads page and from here i can just
04:58 - download this docker desktop application
05:01 - for windows also if you have searched
05:05 - for
05:06 - docker and if you have opened this main
05:09 - website from docker which is docker.com
05:12 - you can just click on get started
05:16 - and then click on download desktop for
05:19 - mac and windows which will also redirect
05:22 - you to the same page and you can see
05:25 - welcome my docker id is shown here
05:29 - so in order to download this desktop
05:32 - application you need to have your docker
05:35 - id you and you need to log in to the
05:38 - docker website in order to download this
05:41 - executable file so let's just
05:44 - click on this button which is going to
05:46 - start the
05:47 - download of this executable file i have
05:50 - already downloaded this executable file
05:53 - so i'm going to cancel this installation
05:56 - and you can see on my downloads folder i
05:59 - already have this docker desktop
06:01 - installer which is around 856 megabytes
06:04 - so i'm going to just double click
06:06 - on this executable file and i'm going to
06:10 - just
06:11 - start the installation so i'm going to
06:13 - minimize this browser
06:17 - and you can see the installation has
06:19 - been started so the first window here is
06:22 - the configuration so i'm going to just
06:24 - leave everything as default
06:27 - and then click ok which is going to
06:31 - unpack all the files the installation
06:33 - procedure is straightforward i guess you
06:36 - just need to click some buttons
06:38 - and docker will be installed out of the
06:41 - box and now you can see
06:43 - after few seconds i can see this docker
06:46 - desktop
06:47 - icon on my desktop
06:49 - and you can see this message which says
06:51 - installation succeeded so i'm going to
06:54 - just
06:55 - click close and log out button
06:58 - which will log me out of windows 10
07:02 - operating system so i need to log in
07:04 - once again
07:05 - so now i have logged into my windows 10
07:08 - operating system once again
07:10 - and immediately after logging into my
07:13 - windows 10 operating system i can see
07:16 - this window which says hyper-v and
07:18 - container features are not enabled do
07:22 - you want to enable them for docker to be
07:25 - able to work properly i will say ok
07:28 - which is going to enable all these
07:31 - features i thought they are already
07:33 - enabled somehow but
07:35 - according to docker
07:37 - it wants to enable them once again let's
07:40 - say and now i will click on this docker
07:43 - desktop icon from here
07:45 - which is going to start the docker
07:47 - desktop application and i can see this
07:50 - message which is hyper-v service vmm is
07:53 - not available
07:55 - if you have enabled hyper-v
07:58 - just restart your computer now
08:01 - so i'm going to restart my computer and
08:04 - i will then try to just start docker
08:07 - application once again so now i'm going
08:10 - to click on this docker icon once again
08:13 - and you will see on your toolbar here
08:16 - you can see
08:17 - docker is starting so it will take some
08:20 - time to start docker
08:25 - and i can see this message which says
08:27 - docker desktop is running
08:29 - so
08:30 - i can open powershell and start hacking
08:34 - with docker
08:35 - or docker compose also when you click on
08:38 - this docker icon here you can see bunch
08:40 - of options here
08:42 - for the documentation docker hub
08:46 - switch to windows containers and all
08:48 - other
08:49 - settings here
08:51 - so one thing i will recommend here
08:54 - is to sign in
08:56 - with your docker credentials which you
08:59 - have already created and i'm going to
09:01 - sign in with my docker credentials
09:04 - and after signing in
09:07 - you will be able to see your docker id
09:10 - and the sign out option
09:12 - so let's get started with docker so
09:15 - first of all you can start the command
09:18 - prompt i'm going to just type cmd which
09:20 - is going to
09:21 - show me this option which is
09:23 - command prompt
09:25 - and here you can just type
09:28 - docker
09:30 - hyphen version or hyphen v will also
09:34 - work
09:34 - and you can see the version which we
09:37 - have installed now let's also check if
09:39 - docker is working with the docker hub
09:43 - perfectly fine or not to test this you
09:46 - can just run
09:48 - docker run hello
09:51 - hyphen world
09:53 - okay so just run this command this is
09:56 - the most popular command to test
09:59 - whether docker is
10:01 - running or not or it's able to fetch all
10:03 - the images from docker hub or not so i'm
10:06 - going to just run this command and when
10:09 - i run this command you can see this kind
10:11 - of output so you can see on the first
10:14 - line it says unable to find image hello
10:17 - world latest locally so it didn't find
10:20 - this image locally so it has pulled this
10:24 - image from the docker hub repository so
10:28 - you can see in the next line
10:30 - latest pulling from library hello world
10:34 - and once the pull is complete and you
10:37 - can see the status downloaded the new
10:40 - image hello world and then the latest
10:43 - version of hello world
10:45 - and then it says hello from docker that
10:48 - means everything is working fine with
10:50 - your docker and it's able to run your
10:53 - docker images and
10:55 - this is the first docker image we have
10:58 - run which ran successfully few more
11:01 - commands i can show you here for example
11:04 - you can also
11:07 - say docker
11:09 - images
11:11 - and then press enter and you will see
11:13 - the list of all the images you have on
11:16 - your system so we have just downloaded
11:19 - this docker image which is hello world
11:22 - image so this is how you can download
11:24 - and install docker on your windows 10
11:28 - operating system i hope you have enjoyed
11:30 - this video and i will see you in the
11:32 - next video
