00:00 - hello guys welcome to the third video
00:02 - tutorial on PHP programming for
00:05 - beginners and in this video I'm going to
00:08 - show you how to install notepad++ for
00:13 - writing and editing your PHP programs on
00:18 - your Windows operating system so
00:20 - notepad++ is a simple text editor but uh
00:25 - it's good in a way that it highlights
00:28 - your text okay so whenever you are
00:31 - writing PHP or C++ or any other program
00:34 - using notepad++ it will highlight your
00:37 - text and then it'll be easier to read
00:41 - the code what you have written in PHP or
00:45 - any other language which notepad++
00:48 - supports so let's see how we can install
00:51 - notepad++ it's really easy just search
00:54 - for node pad Plus+ and the first link
00:59 - you will find here is notepad minus
01:02 - plusus plus.org
01:05 - and in here you need to go to download
01:10 - tab and notepad++ is only available for
01:14 - uh windows so this is this notepad++ uh
01:19 - you can only install on Windows
01:21 - otherwise if you want to install it on
01:23 - ubben 2 or any other Linux operating
01:26 - system you need to use wine for that but
01:30 - that's the another story uh I will just
01:34 - download this installer for
01:39 - now and once this executable file is
01:43 - downloaded I will start installing this
01:45 - uh notepad++ on my computer there are
01:49 - other text editor which you can use uh
01:52 - if you want to uh write your code or you
01:56 - want an editor which is uh cross
02:00 - platform for example Eclipse you can use
02:02 - it on uh Windows Mac OS or on your Linux
02:08 - operating system there's one more IDE
02:12 - called um net beans which you can use to
02:16 - uh write your code on Linux or Windows
02:22 - and Mac OS you can program PHP using
02:25 - that net beans or Eclipse IDE also but
02:28 - for now we are going to Plus for our
02:31 - tutorial series I have started the
02:34 - installer and by default I will select
02:37 - the English as my language I will click
02:39 - okay next I agree this is the default
02:43 - location where it will be installed next
02:47 - next and if you want to create a
02:49 - shortcut you can just click this option
02:51 - or otherwise uncheck it if you don't
02:53 - want a shortcut on the desktop and
02:58 - install and it will
03:01 - take few seconds to install this
03:03 - notepad++ it's a very
03:06 - lightweight uh installation but it's
03:09 - really powerful and just uh leave this
03:13 - uh checkbox checks so uh notepad++ will
03:16 - be launched immediately whenever you
03:19 - want to uh whenever you close
03:23 - finish so in here we can write our code
03:29 - and why I'm
03:30 - am stressing on notepad++ is because for
03:35 - example I have notepad
03:38 - also
03:40 - notepad in my Windows operating system
03:43 - and it will also works fine but there's
03:48 - one major difference in here in
03:51 - notepad++ programming or using notepad++
03:54 - editor and this uh this only notepad
03:58 - editor which is whenever you write your
04:01 - code in your
04:04 - notepad++
04:05 - you will be able to see the syntax
04:09 - highlighting so I I have written some
04:12 - code first of all I need to save this
04:14 - file as a PHP file so I will right click
04:17 - it and I will say save as
04:21 - and I will make one
04:26 - uh I'll make one folder in here
04:30 - which I will call it
04:36 - as
04:38 - tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going
04:43 - to give the name of this U PHP file
04:47 - which is for example
04:50 - test.php
04:51 - and click save and now you can see the
04:55 - syntax highlighting it's red and for
04:58 - example I want to Echo
05:01 - something don't worry about this code we
05:04 - are going to see in detail how to use
05:06 - this code so don't worry about this I'm
05:09 - just I just want to show this
05:12 - U syntax highlighting for
05:15 - now so in here you can just
05:18 - print
05:22 - hello
05:24 - world and let me go okay so you see this
05:30 - starting tag and ending tag start with
05:32 - red color markings this Echo is blue
05:35 - color this uh hellow world has other
05:38 - color and this semicolon has other other
05:41 - color and whenever you want
05:43 - to write the same code using notepad++
05:47 - and I want to save
05:50 - as for
05:52 - example
05:53 - somewhere in the same place where I have
05:57 - uh uh given this
06:01 - test 2.
06:04 - PHP and when I save this it will not
06:08 - highlight your syntax okay so it's just
06:12 - a plain editor but you can use this
06:14 - plain editor there is no constraint that
06:17 - uh you have to use uh notepad++ you can
06:21 - use it but the only problem is the
06:24 - syntax highlighting this makes your code
06:28 - really easy to read read and maintain
06:31 - and this you'll always see it as a black
06:35 - uh script or code so you can not find
06:38 - these keywords easily in using this
06:43 - notepad so in this way you can uh
06:46 - download and install notepad++ for
06:49 - editing and writing your PHP programs
06:52 - from the next video I'm going to show
06:54 - you how to write your first PHP program
06:56 - in uh your Windows operating system I
