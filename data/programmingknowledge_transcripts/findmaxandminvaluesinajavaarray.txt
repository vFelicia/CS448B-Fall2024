00:00 - hello and welcome back to the new
00:01 - version of the Java tutorial Series so
00:04 - so till now we have covered two
00:07 - questions which are frequently Asked in
00:10 - the interview processes and now today we
00:13 - will be covering another question which
00:15 - is to find the minimum or the maximum
00:18 - value inside an array so what they have
00:21 - done over here is you will be giving a
00:23 - given and array and you just find you
00:27 - just have to find minimum or the maximum
00:30 - when you found the array
00:33 - array will consist of the integer
00:36 - numbers and you have to find the minimum
00:40 - number from the web
00:42 - okay so let me just write question over
00:46 - here
00:47 - find
00:51 - maximum
00:57 - Roman
00:59 - Eddie
01:01 - and let me give an example 5 comma 6
01:06 - comma 9 comma 10 comma 25
01:11 - so let's suppose this is an example
01:15 - so after giving this array to our
01:18 - function that we have we are going to
01:20 - write
01:21 - the expected answer should be 5 because
01:23 - among those five integers 5 is the
01:26 - minimum number or else if you finding
01:29 - the maximum numbers the result should be
01:33 - 25. you can do anything uh you can find
01:38 - minimum as well as the banks okay so in
01:41 - this question we will be finding the
01:42 - minimum you can try for the maximum one
01:44 - if you get some error you can do comment
01:47 - out I will be giving you the reply okay
01:51 - so
01:52 - I guess we have to find the minimum
01:55 - value for that we have to return that
01:57 - minimum value inside in the integer
01:59 - format okay so the return value of the
02:01 - written type of the our method should be
02:04 - integer okay and our method should be
02:08 - static because we are calling it from
02:11 - the main method
02:12 - of type int and I will name it name this
02:16 - method as find
02:18 - Mini Mom
02:20 - okay so for to this we will be writing
02:27 - any because we need to pass that array
02:30 - to that function
02:32 - okay so inside here I will be uh need
02:36 - one Min integer variable which will
02:40 - store the value of the minimum value
02:42 - minimum number from that array so
02:44 - initially I will be doing
02:46 - error at 0 as the minimum number but
02:49 - initially I just assigning the zeroth
02:52 - index integer value to the minimum
02:54 - variable over here okay and now we need
02:58 - one for Loop
03:01 - which will iterate through the entire
03:03 - array that we have passed I with less
03:07 - than
03:09 - error.length
03:12 - and each time we'll be doing
03:15 - I plus plus
03:17 - okay so we need one if condition over
03:20 - here at I
03:24 - is less than min
03:28 - okay so if if that's the case
03:32 - we just need to update the value of the
03:36 - mini variable okay so what we are doing
03:38 - uh doing over is
03:40 - array at I so let me give an example if
03:44 - if it is the case that I raise it
03:47 - reading for the first time so let's
03:50 - suppose this is the its array and added
03:53 - index that is zeroth index is 5 so this
03:57 - entire element we are assigned it to the
03:59 - means value yes so let's suppose means
04:01 - the mean value is 5. and if condition we
04:05 - are checking are at I
04:07 - that is 5 is less than 5 so this will be
04:10 - evaluated as false so Loop breaks and
04:14 - will come out of the loop and
04:17 - for the second time is value is 1
04:21 - so array at I means array at one added
04:25 - one is six is six less than five
04:30 - no it's not this is not the case we will
04:33 - again if condition is evaluated as false
04:36 - again we have increment the value of I
04:38 - and again we will check uh whether array
04:42 - at 2 array 2 means 9 9 is less than
04:46 - mineral is five
04:48 - again it will be evaluated as false so
04:51 - in in our case it it will never evaluate
04:53 - it as two until and unless there is no
04:56 - number inside an array Which is less
04:58 - than five if that number is less than
05:00 - five it will just simply update the
05:01 - value of the main to the minimum value
05:04 - that means that that iteration will do
05:06 - okay uh and after this successful
05:10 - running of the for Loop we will just
05:13 - simply return the mean well
05:17 - you can also find the maximum value in
05:19 - the same manner you just try once
05:23 - finding I will just write in Array
05:28 - and again you can provide your own
05:32 - uh input also nope no issues five comma
05:37 - 6 comma 9 comma ten comma 25 comma
05:44 - 4.
05:45 - okay and I will just call
05:50 - find minimum
05:52 - I will write our array or
05:57 - and I will just
06:00 - do this entire thing inside this when
06:04 - statement so that the value that the
06:07 - function is returning that is the
06:09 - minimum number should get printed on the
06:12 - console over itself okay so if I run
06:15 - this
06:17 - uh 4 should get printed yeah four is
06:20 - getting printed on the one so let me
06:21 - just uh modify one
06:25 - condition now 5 should get printed
06:31 - yeah so let me just try with the
06:35 - negative number
06:37 - let's suppose negative 9 so what do you
06:41 - think what will be related
06:44 - yeah you guys right now minus 9 is
06:47 - getting printed on the console
06:50 - so this is pretty much about finding the
06:53 - minimum number inside an array you can
06:55 - do this some modification inside this
06:57 - code to get the maximum number
07:01 - logic because by watching these kind of
07:05 - videos uh just watching the problem
07:07 - solving videos will not help you
07:09 - improving your problem solving skills
07:12 - you have to practice a lot uh transform
07:15 - the defog X portals uh problems or
07:19 - hacker rank hacker Earth there are so
07:21 - many portals are there transforming
07:23 - those questions
07:24 - and
07:26 - so that you can build a solid logic okay
07:29 - so thank you for watching this video and
07:32 - I'll see you in the next one
