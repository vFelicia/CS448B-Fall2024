00:00 - in this video we are going to see two
00:02 - things first of all we are going to see
00:04 - that how can we save an altrix file or
00:06 - an eltrix workflow to be more precise
00:09 - next we are going to see that how can we
00:11 - import multiple files into ultrix okay
00:15 - so first of all let's see how can we
00:16 - save a workflow this is the workflow
00:18 - from our previous video it says that we
00:20 - have created
00:22 - so how do we save it we can just go to
00:24 - file there is this option to save with a
00:26 - shortcut ctrl s that you can select
00:29 - uh you have to select the path where you
00:31 - want to save so whatever path you want
00:34 - that you can just select
00:37 - so this is this ultrix files folder
00:39 - where i want to save it okay you can
00:41 - give it any name like let me just give
00:43 - it
00:45 - xl1
00:50 - okay and the uh extension is going to be
00:52 - yx empty that means it is a workflow
00:55 - file okay then you can click on save
00:58 - once you have saved it you can see the
01:00 - workflow has renamed itself to xl1 dot
01:02 - yxmd okay
01:05 - so that's a pretty simple process of
01:06 - saving now what we can do is create a
01:08 - new workflow from here
01:10 - and just close this workflow so the new
01:13 - workflow that we have created is now
01:15 - going to help us import multiple files
01:17 - so first of all let's take a look at the
01:19 - files that we want to import okay
01:22 - okay so we have this folder called csv
01:25 - in which we have two csv files data 2021
01:28 - and data 2022 okay
01:31 - or sorry data 2020. so what is a csv
01:34 - file csv stands for comma separated
01:36 - values in which all the records are
01:38 - separated by commas and are placed one
01:41 - beside the other so if you just open it
01:43 - with the help of a notepad you can see
01:45 - this is how this file is looking
01:48 - the names of the column is series
01:49 - reference period data value suppressed
01:52 - status units magnitude etc there are
01:55 - columns and then these are all the
01:57 - values of the columns and as you can see
01:59 - they are all separated by commas
02:01 - these are the commas that are going to
02:03 - separate them one from the other okay so
02:05 - this is the csv files that we have the
02:08 - name of the folder is csv it is present
02:10 - in the desktop and the two files is data
02:12 - 2021 and data 2020 okay
02:14 - so the common thing between them is the
02:17 - word data and the first two characters
02:19 - of the year that is 20. okay
02:22 - or actually the first three characters
02:24 - okay
02:25 - so let's see how can we work with it on
02:27 - ultrix so let's just bring our workflow
02:30 - let's just input the data so this is the
02:32 - tool drop it over here
02:34 - now what we are going to do is just
02:37 - click on this drop down the process of
02:40 - importing the file is going to be same
02:42 - okay let's just click on files select a
02:44 - file
02:46 - and here this is the csv folder and now
02:48 - if you want you can just select any of
02:50 - the file that you want to import okay so
02:52 - this is this status 2021 let's click on
02:55 - open
02:56 - now what would happen is uh the first
02:58 - hundred records would be shown to you if
03:00 - you just click on run this workflow then
03:03 - in the case of the output
03:05 - um you will get the time it takes to
03:08 - execute it which is 0.6 seconds and you
03:10 - would see how many columns are there
03:12 - there are a total of 14 columns and
03:14 - 5 000 records are being displayed now
03:17 - why the 5000 records are being displayed
03:19 - there are a total of around 20 000
03:21 - records okay so in the case of a huge
03:24 - data set
03:25 - we get only few records to be displayed
03:27 - in this output panel
03:29 - why is it because in the output panel
03:32 - the maximum allowed limit is 1 mb so how
03:34 - many records you can get in 1 mb only
03:37 - those records would be displayed right
03:39 - like in this case we have 5 102 records
03:42 - out of the total number
03:44 - now
03:44 - these are sufficient to get you an idea
03:47 - of the fact that uh how the things are
03:50 - gonna work
03:52 - so it's okay
03:53 - but
03:54 - here in this case what we are getting is
03:57 - only
03:58 - the records of the table uh of the sheet
04:02 - that is data 2021 we are not getting
04:04 - 2020s data right so how can we get
04:07 - multiple files how can we like import
04:09 - multiple files into alteryx right so for
04:12 - this we are going to use something known
04:14 - as the wildcard characters
04:16 - now there are multiple white card
04:18 - characters that are available but here
04:20 - we are going to use the asterix file
04:22 - card character and how are we going to
04:23 - use it here you can see uh when we
04:26 - import a file you get the path of that
04:28 - particular file okay so what i'm gonna
04:30 - do is just remove this thing
04:32 - and as we saw that the common ground was
04:36 - data space 20 20 or 22.
04:40 - so the last digit was different just the
04:44 - two um files rest of the name was same
04:47 - right so what we are going to do is
04:49 - after data i'm just going to put an
04:51 - asterisk
04:53 - and click on enter or click on refresh
04:55 - now once i do that all the data files
04:58 - over here
05:01 - are being uh you know
05:06 - imported
05:08 - so let's just wait for a few seconds
05:16 - right
05:19 - if you just click on this
05:21 - you would get the file over here the
05:24 - link that would be
05:25 - was shown to you
05:28 - so here what we have done is actually i
05:31 - have reduced the number of records in
05:33 - both the files and why i have done this
05:37 - uh this step is done to uh just show you
05:40 - that how these two files are
05:42 - actually taken together okay
05:46 - so
05:46 - let's see how it is happening right now
05:48 - what we are getting over here is two
05:50 - warnings it is fairly normal it's just
05:53 - because the number of records
05:55 - were uh or the number of feets are
05:58 - different for different records okay
06:00 - so if you just click on this output
06:02 - column uh we are going uh getting total
06:04 - 13 records that are being displayed okay
06:07 - now these 13 records are actually
06:10 - from a combination of both the files
06:13 - that is 2021 and 2022 or 2021 and 2020
06:17 - okay
06:18 - now how do we verify this in order to
06:20 - verify this we are going to use this
06:22 - fourth field that is output file name as
06:24 - field right now it's selected to know
06:27 - that means we do not know which records
06:29 - belongs to which file but if we just
06:31 - select it to file name only and click on
06:33 - run for the workflow
06:36 - then we would be getting this dialog box
06:37 - let's just click on ok
06:39 - and we just click on this
06:41 - output panel then you can see the number
06:44 - of fields has changed to 15 and here is
06:46 - this file name field where we are
06:48 - getting 2021 data and 2022 data okay
06:51 - so uh here you can see the first six
06:54 - records
06:55 - are from 2021 data and the remaining
06:58 - seven records are from 2022 data a
07:00 - combination of total 13 records is being
07:03 - shown over here that means there are a
07:05 - total of 13 records that are being
07:07 - displayed to us okay
07:09 - now
07:11 - let's just see what all uh things we can
07:13 - do over here
07:14 - and
07:15 - that is like
07:17 - uh just keep with two file name only
07:20 - here we have some information like the
07:22 - delimiters information so what is the
07:24 - delimiter like in comma separated values
07:26 - the different values are separated by a
07:28 - comma so that means comma is a delimiter
07:30 - it separates the values right so comma
07:33 - is taken as a delimiter if you have uh
07:35 - like a json file or an html file then of
07:39 - course comma would not be the delimiter
07:41 - the delimiter would be different so
07:43 - whatever character you want as a
07:45 - delimiter that you can use over here
07:48 - next we have first row contains field
07:50 - names so in order to understand this let
07:53 - me just open the csv file in notepad
07:55 - once okay
07:56 - so here is the csv file that i have
07:58 - opened in notepad this is the first uh
08:01 - series of commas that we are getting and
08:04 - this is actually
08:06 - the column names so this is the first
08:08 - field that is series reference period
08:10 - data value suppressed etc
08:12 - this is all taken as the field name so
08:15 - this first option that we have let me
08:17 - just close this file this first option
08:19 - that we have first row contains field
08:20 - names if it is checked then the first um
08:23 - row is selected as the field names if we
08:25 - just uncheck it and run it once again
08:28 - then what would happen is
08:31 - let's click on okay
08:33 - show the output
08:34 - uh you can see field two field three
08:36 - field four like this all the field names
08:39 - had been shown to us and the first
08:41 - comma separated values that we had would
08:43 - be taken as a record itself right so
08:45 - which is of course not correct so let me
08:48 - just rectify it
08:49 - by again running it by checking that
08:52 - particular option okay
08:56 - next we have all these information which
08:58 - is actually not that important but it is
09:01 - there
09:02 - to you know just um
09:05 - give you much more information about the
09:07 - data one thing is ignore delimiters and
09:09 - quotes so suppose we have some values
09:12 - uh into our data which actually includes
09:14 - the comma like apple comma banana
09:17 - which are not two separate values so to
09:19 - tell the computer this thing what we can
09:21 - do is actually include it in quotes and
09:24 - that would be ignored as a delimiter so
09:26 - if you want to ignore anything as a
09:28 - delimiter that you can do okay so this
09:31 - is
09:31 - all about the multiple files there is
09:34 - one more thing that we need to know and
09:35 - that is suppose we make some changes
09:37 - into the folder let me just go to the
09:39 - csv folder and let me just copy this
09:42 - file and paste it so suppose there is a
09:44 - change in the folder
09:47 - let me just rename it to
09:50 - 2020 underscore data
09:53 - okay
09:55 - now what happens if i have added a
09:58 - another file or if i remove some files
10:00 - okay we can just click on run
10:03 - and
10:05 - now if you just click on this output you
10:07 - can see the total number of records
10:09 - displayed is 20. so this whole process
10:13 - is now automatic if any changes are
10:15 - being made into your data or into the
10:18 - folder in the files that would be
10:20 - reflected automatically in altrix
10:23 - that's the beauty of this tool so that's
10:26 - it for this video thanks for watching
