00:00 - hey all welcome to programming knowledge
00:01 - hope you are all doing good today the
00:05 - topic for discussion is about TV and I
00:07 - will be teaching you about what is kV
00:10 - yqv is used and how we show how we are
00:14 - going to use ki v at the end of the
00:16 - trail you will be knowing about what are
00:18 - the what is the purpose of using TV and
00:21 - how will be creating an application with
00:24 - methods that I am going to teach you
00:26 - about so let's get started let's say you
00:33 - want to create an application which have
00:35 - all the stuffs like windows menus icons
00:38 - and buttons and you want to perform a
00:40 - specific task and it needs to be run on
00:45 - multiple platforms like Android mobile
00:47 - phone device Windows Linux on computer
00:53 - to do that
00:55 - we need to have a whole bunch of code
00:58 - and lot of complexity is there and it
01:03 - takes a lot of time as well toward the
01:06 - TV constant comes in let's see what is
01:10 - give me if he is a free graphical user
01:12 - interface Python library where all the
01:16 - stuffs with regards to windows icons and
01:19 - menus are available in this library and
01:22 - just need to use this library to create
01:25 - this application and to make sure that
01:28 - all the stuffs are there without
01:31 - complexity and it saves a lot of time
01:34 - for creating this application and it
01:37 - will be running on a different platforms
01:39 - like Android iOS and Windows where is TV
01:47 - library available it's available in
01:49 - Python which is a programming language
01:50 - which instructs a computer to perform
01:53 - specific tasks by writing down the court
01:59 - those who are beginner I would like to
02:03 - explain what is library library is a
02:06 - collection of methods used to perform
02:08 - tasks without writing the whole bunch of
02:10 - course
02:10 - let's say we are using Watson what sub
02:17 - is used to send and send text messages
02:20 - and receive text messages so you are
02:24 - using a text box to type the text
02:28 - message and click on the play button to
02:32 - send the message so these text boxes
02:36 - buttons and navigations or the graphical
02:40 - user interfaces and they are all
02:43 - separately programmed to run the
02:46 - specific task of sending the message if
02:49 - you are creating an application you need
02:52 - to write down all the code for all these
02:54 - specific tasks their complexity arises
03:00 - when you are not using the structured
03:03 - format or maybe whole bunch of code is
03:07 - there for the complexity they're there
03:12 - in order to avoid all the problems we
03:17 - use library and libraries a collection
03:19 - of methods this is already available we
03:23 - just need to use that library and take
03:25 - out what we want like Windows menus
03:27 - icons as required let's see you know why
03:35 - one should use TV as we have different
03:39 - programming languages different
03:41 - libraries and all the stuffs that are
03:44 - already available while I'm going to use
03:47 - TV is one of the main question the
03:50 - purpose is to create an application that
03:53 - runs on multiple platforms on a device
03:56 - this is how like TV Advantage is
04:01 - multiple platforms such as Android iOS
04:03 - Windows Linux every it runs on each and
04:06 - every platform just writing a code it's
04:11 - a benefit for user he'll be able to use
04:13 - all the platforms with this particular
04:17 - cavey library and also for that
04:20 - programming developer who writes on the
04:23 - code
04:24 - all the libraries or graphical user
04:27 - interface is available in kV these are
04:34 - the different platforms which I was
04:35 - talking about where by using heavy
04:38 - library you are going to run this
04:41 - application this is an Android device
04:44 - just by using the Kiwi library you will
04:48 - be able to use in Android mobile phone
04:50 - and in Windows as well you can run the
04:53 - application and Linux as well which you
04:59 - can run the application
05:03 - how is key be used as we know the
05:07 - summary that we are going to perform
05:09 - activities by creating Windows menus
05:11 - icons using Kiwi library let us now see
05:13 - how we are going to implement this I
05:17 - have taken an example of performing a
05:20 - sum of two numbers which I have
05:21 - mentioned over here for performing a sum
05:24 - of two numbers on a by using windows
05:28 - buttons text box of cycles in an
05:33 - application what
05:36 - by using TV library what you are going
05:38 - to do is first you locate a window like
05:42 - when you are opening an application of
05:45 - window will pop-up then you are going to
05:48 - create a layout to make sure that the
05:52 - contents that are structured as you wish
05:54 - or as your requirements then we will
05:59 - create a bottles in different digits for
06:00 - performing the task performing a sum of
06:02 - two numbers and then followed by will
06:06 - create a method where we will store the
06:08 - required formulas to run the ER to run
06:12 - the program method is used to make sure
06:16 - that we are running the program for this
06:19 - may for by running this method during
06:23 - this method okay then at the end of it
06:29 - will run the program within build
06:33 - methods that reserve there
06:34 - Kevi library the method is the method
06:38 - name is run which I am going to teach
06:41 - you in the coming tutorials
06:43 - so these are the five steps for creating
06:45 - an application using key wheel which
06:48 - covers up the how part we can the window
06:53 - week 8 the layout week 8 the buttons and
06:55 - then McCade the method where we store
06:58 - the formula for performing a task and
07:01 - then we run the method by running the
07:03 - program using a building method called
07:07 - run total so to summarize and make sure
07:14 - that the inside which I have which I am
07:17 - delivering it to you we are going to
07:19 - create an application which will create
07:21 - all the graphical user interfaces like
07:24 - windows icons and menus to perform tasks
07:27 - or activity and which will run on
07:31 - multiple platforms like Android iOS and
07:34 - windows how we are going to do it we are
07:38 - going to do it using a programming
07:40 - language called Python way the Kiwi
07:43 - library is available and I'll be
07:45 - teaching you these steps of performing a
07:48 - sum of two numbers and I mean like to
07:52 - create a window to create a layout page
07:54 - buttons method and running the program
07:56 - with different set of examples in the
07:59 - coming tutorials
08:02 - so it's an easy way of creating an
08:05 - application we will be saving a lot of
08:07 - time effort and you will be creating an
08:12 - application which will run on multiple
08:14 - platforms
08:21 - okay so let's win end this Tarou here
08:25 - and make sure that we are going to
08:29 - create an application methods are coming
08:31 - today that I'm going to teach thank you
08:34 - for joining with programming knowledge
