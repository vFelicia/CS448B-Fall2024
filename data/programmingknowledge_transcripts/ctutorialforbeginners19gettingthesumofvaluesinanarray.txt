00:01 - hello guys welcome once again in the
00:03 - last video I have uh shown you how to
00:06 - declare arrays how to initialize arrays
00:08 - and how to uh use arrays in C++ now in
00:13 - this video I'm going to show you a small
00:15 - example using arrays so that you can uh
00:19 - your Concepts on array can be little bit
00:22 - more strong so let's get started what
00:25 - I'm going to do is I am going to show
00:27 - you how you can sum or how you can add
00:33 - all the elements of
00:35 - array in this example for example I have
00:39 - an array I will call it
00:42 - my
00:44 - array and now I will assign the number
00:48 - of value it will contain for example it
00:50 - will contain six values and then I will
00:53 - initialize it with array initializer
00:57 - values so I will give some values to my
01:01 - array the first value for
01:05 - example not here but four
01:09 - 65 second value is
01:12 - 678 third value is something fourth
01:16 - value is
01:18 - also
01:19 - fifth and
01:23 - sixth so suppose I want to add or I want
01:26 - the sum of all the values of the array
01:29 - how I can
01:30 - uh get the sum of all values of the
01:32 - array let's see how we can achieve it I
01:36 - will declare a
01:38 - variable
01:40 - sum which is which will hold the sum of
01:44 - all the elements in the array and I will
01:47 - initialize this as zero now I will
01:50 - declare a for Loop
01:54 - for INT I is equal to 0 and then I is
02:02 - less than 6 because our array contains
02:07 - six values right and it starts from zero
02:10 - the index of the array starts from zero
02:13 - that's why its I is less than
02:15 - six and
02:18 - i++ and then in the next line what I
02:22 - need to do is simply I will take sum and
02:26 - I will add the element of su one by one
02:29 - so so I will say plus equal to and then
02:33 - the element of the array so I will copy
02:36 - this array here and then I
02:40 - will just add element one by
02:44 - one using this I okay so what it will do
02:49 - it will just get the zeroth element then
02:54 - get the first element because it's in
02:56 - the loop right and when all the sum or
02:59 - and when the addition is done and for
03:02 - Loop is complete we are going to print
03:04 - our
03:05 - sum so I will
03:08 - say
03:11 - sum and then my variable sum and
03:19 - then
03:20 - okay now I will say sum is equal to that
03:24 - will be much better to see now when I
03:27 - run the program
03:31 - it's showing me the mistake because here
03:35 - is the sum I declare it randomly okay
03:38 - now I will build
03:41 - it and run the program and now you can
03:45 - see the sum of all the values in the
03:48 - array is this one you can just check it
03:52 - whether it's uh the sum or not or we can
03:55 - check it with the simple values for
03:58 - example two 2
04:01 - 2 2 2 and two so we know that the sum
04:05 - will be 12 right build a
04:10 - program and run it and you can see sum
04:13 - is equal to 12 so in this way you can
04:15 - calculate the sum of the element of an
04:18 - array using C++ I hope you have enjoyed
04:22 - the video please rate comment and
04:24 - subscribe and bye for now
