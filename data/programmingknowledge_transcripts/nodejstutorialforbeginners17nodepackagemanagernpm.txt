00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Moody's tutorial for beginners in the
00:05 - last video we have seen how we can
00:07 - perform basic routing using no chairs
00:10 - now if you want to do more routing stuff
00:15 - and other stuff if you think of this it
00:18 - can become really difficult whenever you
00:21 - want to add a few more files here you
00:24 - need to write lots and lots of code here
00:27 - in order to perform your stop and this
00:32 - can be easily done by third party module
00:35 - and there is a repository called NPM or
00:41 - food package manager which allows us to
00:45 - include third party module which are
00:48 - created by experienced developers and
00:52 - they were already you know invested
00:55 - their time to create these modules and
00:59 - these are publicly available so similar
01:03 - to these modules for example HTTP or FS
01:07 - module these are built in module in no
01:10 - chairs now these third-party modules can
01:14 - be included in your project using node
01:18 - package manager or NPM so let's go to
01:23 - the NPM website and let's see you what's
01:26 - there so whenever you will search NPM on
01:31 - any browser you will see the first
01:34 - result here will be from NPM chase.com
01:39 - just click this link and BMJ is calm and
01:43 - in here you will be able to find the
01:47 - many package modules or node modules
01:51 - which you can use in your project so
01:55 - approximately there are around
01:59 - I have lost read that there are around
02:04 - 280,000 node modules available in this
02:10 - repository right so you can search this
02:15 - module for example if you know the
02:18 - package name for example this kind of
02:21 - routing can be done using Express right
02:25 - so we can such Express here so you can
02:31 - see you have the intellisense
02:33 - here and you know you can see various
02:38 - options you know are listed here so just
02:41 - search for example Express and you will
02:45 - search for it and the first option here
02:48 - comes is Express Fred flash but we do
02:52 - not want Express flash we just want to
02:54 - express so you can just search for
02:57 - Express once again and here you can see
03:01 - the first option here is Express right
03:04 - so just click this link and here you can
03:09 - see the documentation of for this module
03:11 - so it says fast uh opinionated
03:15 - minimalist web framework so you can use
03:19 - you know Express to do exactly we are
03:23 - trying to do in our stop for example the
03:28 - routing stuff and you know restful api
03:31 - if you want to create you can do it
03:33 - using Express on the right hand side you
03:38 - can see the status also so stats here
03:42 - you can see over three hundred thousand
03:45 - you know installs or downloads of this
03:48 - modules are done previously for example
03:53 - yesterday last date over 300 thousand
03:56 - this month itself have 1.8 million I
04:00 - think downloads here so from these
04:04 - download you can already recognize that
04:06 - this module is really popular and this
04:10 - is the one of one of the most popular
04:12 - modules in no J seconds tell you right
04:16 - now how you can install this Express or
04:21 - any other module
04:23 - out of our 280,000 modules in your
04:28 - project so you can do it using command
04:32 - line and let's open the command line in
04:35 - order to see how we can install it so
04:37 - first of all you need to be in your
04:40 - directory wherever your project is and
04:43 - then you can use NPM command to install
04:47 - these modules so whenever you have
04:50 - installed a node in the first or second
04:54 - video I have shown you how to install
04:56 - node with that and p.m. module has also
04:59 - gone so you can just know the version of
05:02 - this by just writing NPM - me and it's
05:06 - going to give you the version of p.m.
05:08 - now in order to install this express
05:11 - module we just need to do NPM install so
05:14 - just write NPM install Express right
05:19 - which is exactly you know documented
05:22 - here also so installation and p.m.
05:26 - install Express right so whenever you
05:29 - find a module the solution procedure of
05:32 - this module will be given here the
05:35 - documentation of this module will be
05:37 - given here and QuickStart also you know
05:42 - so you can come to this website to know
05:47 - more about any using right so I have
05:53 - just given this NPM install expressed
05:57 - and I will just press ENTER which is
06:00 - going to take some time to download and
06:02 - install this Express module and you can
06:06 - also here there will be a directory
06:09 - created with the name would underscore
06:13 - modules so this module is downloaded in
06:17 - our project you can see and now there is
06:21 - a folder called mode modules is created
06:25 - here and when you open this some more
06:27 - modules you can see many modules are
06:32 - downloaded in
06:35 - folder but the main package we have
06:39 - installed is this Express module and all
06:43 - the other you know modules which are you
06:47 - know coming with this Express module are
06:49 - its dependencies okay so for example
06:54 - debug or destroy or any other module
06:58 - which is installed with this Express
07:01 - module is its dependency so it will also
07:06 - be installed with Express for example ok
07:10 - now this is the way to install any
07:15 - module in your project but this is not
07:18 - the preferred way of doing it
07:20 - we will do it using a package manager
07:23 - using you know NPM command which is the
07:27 - standard command which is like this NPM
07:31 - in it and this we will see in the next
07:34 - video but for now I want to uninstall
07:37 - this module so don't worry if you want
07:40 - to uninstall a module also you can do it
07:43 - using NPM come on
07:45 - so let's uninstall and that command is
07:47 - really simple and p.m. uninstall instead
07:50 - of install you just need to write NPM
07:53 - uninstall and the package name and then
07:56 - press Enter which is going to uninstall
07:58 - the module so you can see the process is
08:01 - going on and then whenever you go to
08:04 - your node modules folder there is only a
08:07 - dot been pulled a left here and every
08:10 - other module is deleted because we have
08:14 - uninstalled this Express module right so
08:19 - using these modules is also simple you
08:23 - can just you know add them like this so
08:28 - VAR HTTP require and then once your
08:32 - module is installed you can just give
08:34 - the name of the module right so this is
08:37 - just the introduction of no chase the
08:42 - standard way of using NPM is you
08:46 - package or JSON file which is kind of
08:49 - you know a file which have all the
08:52 - records whatever modules are there in
08:56 - your you know project and this can be
08:59 - given to other developers also who can
09:02 - use this project with your package dot
09:06 - JSON file and then they can install
09:09 - these modules and they know which
09:12 - version of you know any module you have
09:15 - installed using this package dot JSON
09:18 - file so this is exactly we are going to
09:21 - see in the next video how to use package
09:23 - dot JSON file to create and maintain
09:26 - your approaches so this was the brief
09:29 - introduction about NPM and we will see
09:31 - how we can use NPM and third-party
09:35 - modules from the next video so I hope
09:38 - you have enjoyed this video please rate
09:39 - comment and subscribe and bye for now
