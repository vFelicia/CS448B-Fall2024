00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can download and install
00:03 - eclipse oxygen on your Windows 10
00:05 - operating system Eclipse oxygen is the
00:08 - newest version of Eclipse IDE which you
00:11 - can use to develop java and many other
00:13 - languages so let's get started and let's
00:16 - see how we can install it so let's talk
00:18 - about the prerequisite of installing
00:20 - Eclipse IDE so because Eclipse is a Java
00:24 - based IDE you just need to install Java
00:27 - JDK before installing eclipse so if you
00:31 - don't have Java installed on your system
00:34 - just to install it we're searching for
00:36 - Java JDK and then the first link which
00:39 - will appear here will be from Oracle
00:41 - comm and then you just need to install
00:44 - the version for your Windows operating
00:46 - system and then you just need to set the
00:49 - environment variables now if you don't
00:51 - know how to do this I have already made
00:53 - a video so please watch that video in
00:56 - order to install Java first and if you
00:59 - have already installed Java then we are
01:01 - ready to install eclipse so the next
01:04 - step is to search for Eclipse and the
01:07 - first option offers result you will see
01:10 - here will be from Eclipse dodgy and you
01:13 - can see Eclipse oxygen is the latest
01:16 - version so I'm going to click on this
01:18 - link and this time they have made it
01:21 - really easy so you just need to click on
01:23 - this download button and then you just
01:27 - need to click this download button and
01:29 - when you click this download button you
01:32 - will be able to download this dot exe
01:35 - file right so this type of file will be
01:38 - downloaded which is eclipse - inst - 64
01:42 - dot exe if you want to install Eclipse
01:45 - ID from other mirrors you can choose it
01:48 - from the bottom you can see different
01:51 - mirrors but for now I will just click
01:53 - this download button which is going to
01:54 - start downloading this exe file which is
01:58 - for the Eclipse IDE installations so you
02:01 - can see download has been started and
02:03 - it's about 40 6.4 megabyte file so it
02:06 - will be downloaded really fast in few
02:09 - seconds and once it's downloaded we are
02:11 - going to see how we can install it so
02:13 - now this executable file has been
02:15 - downloaded on my Windows operating
02:16 - system so what I will do is I will not
02:19 - directly open it from here I will go to
02:21 - the location where it's installed so I
02:23 - will just say show in folder and then
02:26 - from here I will start it as
02:29 - administrator so let me minimize the
02:31 - browser first of all so I'm going to
02:34 - right-click on this executable file and
02:36 - I'm going to run it as administrator so
02:39 - this is important you just need to run
02:41 - it as administrator and now I'm going to
02:44 - just say yes and I can minimize this
02:48 - window and now I can see this Eclipse
02:50 - install a ssin wizard has been started
02:53 - and in few seconds I will be able to see
02:56 - the options
02:56 - whatever variants of Eclipse I need to
03:00 - install so now I can see the second
03:02 - window and in this window I can choose
03:04 - the version of Eclipse I want to install
03:07 - so I can choose the version for Java
03:09 - developer Java EE developers C++ or and
03:13 - many other languages but first of all
03:15 - what I will do is I will click on this
03:17 - icon which is on the top right which is
03:21 - these three sticks and here I'm going to
03:24 - update this installer so just click on
03:26 - update first of all and then you will be
03:28 - able to see this kind of window which
03:30 - will tell you to accept this license so
03:33 - I'm going to just check this checkbox
03:34 - and accept the license terms and
03:37 - conditions which is going to update my
03:39 - installer first of all so this is to
03:42 - update all the download links or
03:44 - artifacts so if there are old artifacts
03:47 - or links which are there in the
03:50 - Installer they will all be updated and
03:53 - now I can see this message which says
03:56 - update were installed
03:58 - press ok to restart so I'm going to
04:00 - click OK which is going to restart my
04:02 - installer once again and now I can see
04:06 - these options so this time I'm going to
04:08 - choose the first option which is Eclipse
04:10 - IDE for Java developers and on the next
04:15 - window I can see first of all the
04:18 - product version which is oxygen which is
04:21 - the latest version and then 32-bit or
04:24 - 64-bit so automatically for my system
04:27 - it's 64-bit if you want to choose the
04:30 - 32-bit you can choose it from here and
04:32 - the Java version so it automatically
04:34 - recognizes the location where you have
04:37 - installed a JRE and Java on your system
04:40 - and it will show you this option so if
04:42 - you don't have the good reason to change
04:44 - it just leave it as default and next
04:46 - will be the installation folder so just
04:48 - leave it as default also and then click
04:51 - install and now I can see this kind of
04:55 - license terms and conditions so I'm
04:58 - going to just accept now and I will let
05:01 - the installation go on so now I will
05:03 - wait for the installation to complete so
05:06 - now the installation of Eclipse IDE has
05:08 - been completed on my system so I'm going
05:11 - to click on this launch button which is
05:14 - going to launch the Eclipse IDE and I
05:17 - will wait for the Eclipse oxygen to
05:19 - start and for the first time when you
05:21 - start Eclipse IDE is going to ask you to
05:25 - choose your default workspace so I am
05:27 - going to leave it as default and I'm
05:30 - going to just click Launch so now the
05:33 - Eclipse IDE has been started so I'm
05:36 - going to maximize it and let's create
05:38 - our first hello world java application
05:40 - so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
05:42 - choose file option from here and then
05:44 - choose the new and I'm going to choose
05:47 - the Java project so file new and Java
05:49 - project and in here I'm going to give
05:53 - the name to my Java project so let's say
05:56 - hello world and then I'm going to just
06:00 - leave the JRE as default which is chosen
06:04 - by default for me and I'm going to just
06:07 - say next and this will be the folder
06:12 - structure of my hello world project so
06:14 - there will be hello world project and
06:16 - there will be a folder inside the hollow
06:18 - world project and the default output
06:20 - folder will be HelloWorld /bin right so
06:24 - I don't want to change anything here so
06:25 - I will just click finish here so once
06:27 - you click finish you will not directly
06:29 - see your project you just need to just
06:32 - minimize this valium window first of all
06:35 - so what I will do is I will just choose
06:37 - this minimize option from here so
06:40 - choose minimize and this is going to
06:44 - show me my hello world project so on the
06:47 - left hand side I can see my hello world
06:48 - project and then I have the source
06:50 - folder here we are going to create a new
06:53 - Java file so let's right-click on it and
06:56 - we are going to choose new and let's say
06:59 - class ok so just choose the new class
07:02 - and then gave the name to your class
07:05 - let's say my class name is demo and then
07:09 - I'm going to choose this option here
07:11 - which says public static void main
07:14 - so I want to create this public static
07:16 - void main method when this class is
07:19 - created so I will choose this option
07:21 - which says public static void main and
07:23 - then click finish which is going to
07:25 - create this demo dot Java file for me
07:28 - inside the source folder you can see and
07:30 - then it will also generate the default
07:34 - main method for me so now I can see this
07:37 - demo dot Java file and this main method
07:41 - is generated inside the Java file for me
07:44 - so let's just print HelloWorld for now
07:47 - so I'm going to just write system dot
07:49 - out dot print Ln for print line and then
07:55 - in these parentheses I'm going to just
07:58 - print HelloWorld so just say hello world
08:01 - and then the semicolon and then I'm
08:04 - going to just save my project and let's
08:06 - compile and run it so I'm going to just
08:08 - suppress this green button on the top
08:11 - which will compile my program and now it
08:13 - shows me hello world message which is
08:15 - printed using this method okay so this
08:19 - is how you can download and install
08:21 - eclipse oxygen on your Windows 10
08:23 - operating system I hope you've enjoyed
