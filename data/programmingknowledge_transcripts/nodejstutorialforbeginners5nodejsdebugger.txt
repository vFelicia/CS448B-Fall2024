00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - node.js 212 for beginners in the last
00:05 - video we have seen how we can write a
00:07 - small server using node Cheers
00:11 - now in this video I'm going to show you
00:14 - how you can use node debugger to debug
00:18 - any problem in know Cheers
00:21 - so what I have done here is in the last
00:24 - video I have shown you how you can use
00:27 - this create server and what I have done
00:32 - is I have edited this code a little so I
00:35 - have created our variable called body
00:38 - and I have provided some value to this
00:41 - body right and then I have created one
00:44 - more variable called content length and
00:47 - this content length is equal to the
00:50 - length of the body so just take the body
00:53 - variable and call a method called length
00:56 - on it and will give you the length of
00:59 - this body variable which contains this
01:03 - text right and in the response dot write
01:07 - had I have the status code and in the
01:11 - last video I have shown you this header
01:15 - which is content type and there is one
01:18 - more header called content length and
01:21 - here I'm but just passing as a value of
01:24 - the body length so content length I am
01:27 - passing here this variable yeah okay so
01:31 - basically what it's going to do is it's
01:33 - going to just print the header and in
01:37 - the header we are going to see the
01:39 - content length also now I'm going to
01:44 - just run my app by the way I'm using
01:46 - this different terminal this time this
01:50 - terminal is for Windows which is called
01:53 - commander CMD ER if you want you can
01:56 - download it for free from its website so
02:00 - just search for commander download and
02:02 - you will be good to go
02:03 - so node and then just run your app and
02:07 - press ENTER and then I'm going to open
02:10 - my browser and just
02:13 - run this URL which I'm running and when
02:17 - I will go here so first of all I will
02:21 - just click this option here in the
02:25 - network which is this one and there is a
02:28 - variable called content length and
02:31 - length is 28 right now right so this
02:35 - content length is due to this variable
02:39 - right now let's see how we can use node
02:43 - debugger so for example what I want to
02:47 - do is I want to for example my mistake
02:52 - I called a wrong method on this body
02:55 - variable for example instead of typing
02:58 - length I typed wrong spelling of length
03:03 - for example right now this is a mistake
03:07 - so when I run my code once again and i
03:12 - refresh my browser once again you can
03:16 - see I don't get any response here and
03:20 - when I click here I also don't get the
03:25 - value of this content length so right
03:27 - now I can see content length is
03:30 - undefined right so this is basically an
03:34 - error which is coming from this but we
03:38 - know that we intentionally you know type
03:41 - this length wrong but sometimes you
03:43 - don't know where from where the error is
03:46 - coming so for this we can use node
03:49 - debugger so right now instead of running
03:52 - node app dot jeaious
03:54 - you just need to write node debug and
03:58 - then app dot GS so just add debug in
04:03 - between node and your file name right so
04:06 - note debug app dot jeaious and press
04:09 - enter and then it's going to open your
04:13 - code in the node debugger now the first
04:18 - thing it will show you is some lines of
04:22 - code so you I can see first 3 line of
04:26 - my code in the debugger right now to
04:30 - know the more options about this
04:34 - debugger you can always type help here
04:37 - and press Enter
04:38 - it's going to give you the basic command
04:42 - so r is for run cont or its shortcut if
04:47 - c is for continue and n EXT you can type
04:52 - or n for the next or step or out or back
04:57 - trace or set breakpoint and many other
05:00 - you know commands right now for example
05:04 - somehow I know that some the error is
05:09 - coming from here because we are not able
05:12 - to see the body
05:14 - right so here we want to set the
05:17 - breakpoint so this is the line for right
05:19 - so what we can do here is we can call a
05:26 - method called set breakpoint which is
05:29 - this one right so just call this method
05:33 - set breakpoint and then in here in the
05:39 - brackets you just give the line number
05:42 - so line number we are interested in here
05:45 - is line number four right which is the
05:49 - Declaration of body tag just right for
05:52 - here and then press Enter and our
05:56 - debugger is stopped here right now in
05:59 - order to continue this program you can
06:03 - just type cont or directly C to continue
06:09 - and press ENTER and the program will
06:12 - continue for example okay and then when
06:15 - I just refresh my browser once again I
06:18 - can see the breakpoint is met so our
06:25 - break point is at four so we are on our
06:27 - break point right now in order to go
06:31 - further you can you know type s to step
06:35 - into or if you want to go next then
06:39 - you can type any ext okay so for example
06:44 - I will just type N for the next command
06:47 - because for next come on you can either
06:50 - use n or next itself right and press
06:54 - ENTER and we are on the next line right
06:57 - once again you when you press ENTER it
07:01 - will execute the last command you have
07:03 - executed so if I don't type anything
07:06 - yeah it will just continue you know
07:12 - implementing or executing the last
07:14 - command you have you know executed which
07:17 - is next right and let's check the values
07:19 - of this these variables right so to know
07:25 - the value of these variables I can type
07:28 - our EPL which is read a well print line
07:35 - for example load and then press ENTER
07:39 - and then we can just type body and then
07:45 - press ENTER and it gives the value of
07:47 - the body which is correct in our case
07:51 - because the body value was this which is
07:55 - matching in the debugger so we know that
07:58 - this variable is perfectly fine now we
08:02 - go to the next variable which is content
08:05 - length and press ENTER and it doesn't
08:09 - give any value so I know that something
08:11 - is wrong here and then I I can see here
08:16 - the spelling mistake is here and I know
08:21 - the problem is coming from this place so
08:23 - I can correct this problem and I can go
08:27 - out of my debugger by typing exit so
08:30 - press control C first and then dot exit
08:35 - just press dot exit and you are out of
08:38 - your debugger okay and then if you want
08:41 - you can run your node application
08:44 - normally and then just refresh your page
08:47 - and you will see this
08:50 - response once again right now if you are
08:53 - using the Visual Studio Visual Studio
08:57 - code also have the option of debugging
09:02 - right so if you want to debug using this
09:05 - Visual Studio code editor you can go to
09:09 - view and in the view you can just press
09:13 - debug so you will be in the debug menu
09:18 - you can see here there is a green button
09:22 - which is for debug right and if you want
09:25 - to start debugging you just need to
09:27 - press this green button here and you can
09:30 - see your debugger is running right and
09:34 - in here you can even set the breakpoints
09:38 - so for example I want to set the
09:39 - breakpoint here on the line for you can
09:42 - see this red dot you just need to click
09:44 - here and for example I just refresh my
09:48 - webpage for example you can see this
09:51 - breakpoint is reached when I pressed you
09:56 - know this refresh button right so for
10:00 - example I will just break this debugging
10:04 - once again and once again I can for
10:08 - example I can do this spelling mistake
10:11 - and once again I can start the debugger
10:14 - and once again I will refresh my page
10:17 - for example and we are here and then to
10:21 - stab to the next step you can just press
10:25 - this button which will go to the next
10:27 - step and if you want to see the value
10:30 - you just need to hover over this
10:31 - variable and it will show you the value
10:34 - of body and in here you can see content
10:37 - length is undefined right so we know the
10:40 - error is coming from this point right
10:42 - and this is how you can debug from
10:47 - Visual Studio code also and to break
10:50 - everything from the debugging option you
10:52 - just need to press this red button okay
10:55 - so this is how you can debug your
10:59 - problems in nodejs I hope you've enjoyed

11:04 - scribe and bye for now
