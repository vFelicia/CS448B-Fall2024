00:01 - hello guys welcome once again in this
00:04 - video I will show you how you can
00:07 - download install and
00:10 - run sample program from log for
00:15 - CPP so what is lock for CPP lock for CPP
00:20 - is a C++ library from which you can
00:25 - prepare logging
00:27 - files and sometimes it's
00:32 - really good and essential for
00:36 - your application to have lock for
00:40 - CPP so let's get started and First Step
00:45 - you need to do is go to log for
00:48 - cp. source.net there you can
00:53 - find information about log for CPP and
00:57 - what are the cap capabilities and how
00:59 - you can download and install lock for
01:02 - CPP so first step is to download the LI
01:07 - Library so go to
01:11 - downloads and click download page and
01:15 - you will be directed to the source
01:23 - Forge repository and you can download
01:27 - the
01:28 - latest zip file for log for
01:33 - CPP so click download and
01:38 - download and your
01:41 - system there is uh something I want to
01:44 - say that I
01:46 - will install and compile this log for
01:49 - CPP on my UB 2 12.10 operating
01:54 - system so all the step will be specific
01:57 - to open to Linux
02:01 - and you
02:02 - can take a tip from these instruction
02:06 - and Implement on your own operating
02:10 - system also different operating system
02:14 - so what you need to do is to download
02:18 - this tar file and extract it to the
02:25 - folder of your
02:27 - choice so I have extracted this log for
02:32 - C CPP in my home folder of my Linux
02:37 - operating
02:39 - system okay
02:42 - now we once again go to the log for
02:47 - CPP website of log for CPP source.net
02:54 - and here it says the step steps
03:00 - to configure and make and make
03:04 - install for the untu sorry for
03:08 - the C log for C++
03:13 - Library
03:15 - so I
03:19 - have followed these steps and from my
03:23 - experience what I have faced and what
03:28 - experience I have with
03:30 - lock C for CPP I have
03:37 - written this documentation in my
03:42 - blog my blog name is uh
03:46 - www. programming knowledge blog. blogs
03:51 - spot. day or what
03:54 - com and here when you go to the
03:58 - labels just click log for CPP this one
04:04 - and it will open these
04:10 - this procedure what procedure you need
04:13 - to follow in order to install and run
04:16 - your first sample program from log for
04:20 - CPP so let's get started from the first
04:26 - step which is going to the directory of
04:30 - log for
04:35 - CPP and we will open our
04:40 - terminal and
04:43 - here we will go to the directory which
04:46 - is CD log for CPP because it's in my
04:50 - home
04:51 - directory and then type second step is
04:56 - to configure these this Library so I
04:59 - will write dot
05:05 - slash slash.
05:08 - configure and press
05:14 - enter and it will start configuring this
05:18 - file into your
05:27 - system while it's configuring let's see
05:30 - what next we need to
05:33 - do so I will come to my blog entry after
05:38 - configuring you need to
05:41 - make this file and then make check and
05:46 - make
05:48 - install
05:56 - Okay so the configuration is done and
06:01 - now the third step is to make the
06:04 - program so once again in the terminal
06:08 - type make and press enter and it will
06:13 - start making your
06:16 - [Music]
06:23 - program so uh now your make is also done
06:27 - so next step is
06:30 - to perform make check so I will write
06:37 - pseudo
06:40 - make
06:44 - check and press
06:48 - enter it will ask for my
06:52 - password and press
06:58 - enter and and it will start
07:02 - checking for your
07:13 - make so our make check is also performed
07:17 - successfully if our make check is
07:20 - performed successfully you can see this
07:22 - all 10 test
07:24 - passed the next step is to
07:30 - install so write
07:34 - sudo
07:36 - make
07:39 - install and press
07:44 - enter and it will
07:48 - install lock for cpv file into your
07:52 - system and this is complete
07:55 - also so our first stage of of
08:00 - configuring and making lock for CPP file
08:04 - is
08:05 - complete now what we will do is we will
08:10 - make a sample program which is given on
08:14 - the lock for
08:15 - CPP
08:17 - website and then we will compile and run
08:21 - that
08:22 - program so what I will do first
08:27 - is I will go into my home folder and I
08:32 - will
08:36 - make a document blank
08:45 - document
08:50 - and I will name it
08:53 - as log for
08:56 - CPP
08:58 - Dot
09:06 - CPP
09:09 - file
09:11 - and enter so this will create a CPP file
09:15 - for me and then I will open this
09:20 - file and it must be
09:24 - blank and what I will do is I will go to
09:28 - log for CPP
09:38 - website
09:44 - yeah
09:53 - and at the
09:56 - bottom they have given a sample exit
09:59 - example
10:00 - for log for
10:03 - CPP so we
10:06 - will try to compile
10:10 - and run this
10:13 - example I will just copy this simple
10:21 - example
10:22 - [Music]
10:24 - and copy and
10:27 - paste and to my blank log for
10:32 - CPP file which I have
10:36 - made
10:37 - [Music]
10:39 - recently okay and then I will save
10:44 - it my file is saved
10:49 - now and
10:52 - then once
10:54 - again I will go to my
10:58 - terminal
10:59 - and I will perform CD because my log for
11:03 - CPP file is my in my home folder so I
11:08 - will perform the other step from here I
11:11 - will clear this
11:14 - [Music]
11:17 - screen and I will go to my
11:21 - blog
11:24 - entry
11:26 - here
11:27 - on
11:29 - www. programming
11:31 - knowledge blog. Blogspot
11:35 - doday and here I have written the
11:38 - compilation
11:40 - method
11:47 - and yeah
11:49 - okay
11:51 - so to compile this log for CPP
11:57 - file or s simple example you need to
12:01 - copy this
12:03 - command from
12:05 - there from my blog or I will just show
12:10 - you what to write compile this log for
12:15 - CPP and paste it
12:17 - here so to compile this program you need
12:21 - to write
12:27 - g++ space
12:29 - minus
12:31 - GS T
12:33 - ABS
12:35 - plusus
12:37 - w
12:38 - space minus I
12:42 - headers space your log for CPP file
12:47 - name
12:50 - space-
12:51 - O your log for CPP executable file names
12:56 - which you want to produce
12:59 - and
13:02 - then
13:04 - space l log for
13:08 - CPP
13:09 - space- L
13:12 - PT
13:15 - read okay and then I will press enter to
13:21 - compile
13:24 - this CPP
13:27 - file and yes it's compiled
13:34 - successfully
13:39 - but first of all I will show you this is
13:42 - the executable file my program has
13:46 - generated by compiling this command g++
13:52 - command which you can copy it from my
13:55 - blog and now we will execute
14:01 - our executable file which is
14:06 - generated
14:10 - and when you execute
14:16 - this executable file it will show an
14:23 - error which shows
14:27 - that your or error while loading share
14:31 - shared
14:33 - Library lib log for CPP doso
14:38 - do5 cannot open shared object file no
14:43 - such file or
14:46 - directory this error will
14:49 - come this error you can
14:53 - eliminate by this
14:56 - line which is
15:01 - simply you need
15:05 - to
15:07 - set one environment
15:10 - variable and then it will
15:13 - compile without
15:15 - [Music]
15:18 - any
15:21 - problem so you need to write export LD
15:26 - Dash Library Dash
15:30 - path this Dash is underscore keep in
15:33 - mind is equal
15:36 - to/ USR SL looc SL Library so this is
15:43 - the environment variable you need to set
15:47 - in order to run this
15:51 - executable file so I
15:55 - will paste it here and just press enter
15:58 - and and my environment variable is set
16:01 - and then once again I will execute I
16:05 - executeable
16:07 - file
16:08 - enter and yes it gives me the desired
16:19 - result one more thing I want to share
16:22 - with you is this export LD Library Das
16:27 - paath is equal to use
16:29 - user SL local lib is a temporary setting
16:34 - of environment variable if you want to
16:38 - set
16:41 - permanent environment variable you need
16:45 - to edit
16:48 - your bash RC
16:51 - file which also I have shown you
16:57 - in my blog log so for that what you need
17:01 - to
17:03 - do
17:05 - is
17:10 - to execute this
17:13 - gedit
17:16 - slash do bashrc command and it will open
17:23 - your bash RC file and at the bottom of
17:27 - your Bash RC file you need
17:30 - to write export LD Library path is equal
17:34 - to user local
17:37 - lib and where after that you save that
17:41 - bash RC file and execute this
17:45 - command
17:47 - Source till sl.
17:51 - bashrc so it will set your environment
17:54 - variable
17:57 - permanently so so once again when you
17:59 - open a new terminal and you want to
18:02 - execute
18:04 - this log for CPP
18:07 - exe it will not show this error
18:13 - again okay so I hope you have learned
18:16 - something new this time about lock for
18:20 - CPP and I hope you will rate comment and
18:25 - subscribe and keep watching these
18:27 - videos thanks for
18:30 - now
