00:44 - button which is going to start the
00:47 - download of this PKG file it's around
00:52 - 43.3 megabytes so it will be downloaded
00:54 - really fast once it's downloaded just
00:57 - click on this PKG file and let me
01:00 - minimize the browser so as you can see
01:03 - the installation of python has been
01:05 - started on the first window I'm going to
01:06 - just click on continue here and then if

01:33 - then click on continue and then you need
01:35 - to agree with the license terms and
01:37 - conditions so click on
01:40 - agree and then we have the installation
01:43 - type so this will take around 176
01:47 - megabyte of space on your computer click
01:50 - install so I'm going to click on install
01:53 - and then give my uh Max password which I
01:56 - Ed to log to my Mac operating system and
01:59 - then click on on install
02:01 - software it's going to start the
02:03 - installation of this software now here
02:06 - it says installer would like to access
02:09 - files in your downloads folder I will
02:12 - click on okay here which is going to
02:15 - write the files in my downloads folder
02:18 - and once the installation is finished
02:20 - it's going to uh open this kind of
02:22 - finder window where you will see all the
02:25 - tools which are installed so you can see
02:28 - idle is IDE which comes with the python
02:32 - installation so you can open idle you
02:35 - can also open the python launcher
02:38 - application so both these uh
02:41 - applications you will find also in your
02:43 - applications section also so when you
02:46 - click on Launchpad here and then uh when
02:49 - you see here idle is present and python
02:52 - launcher is also present so both are
02:55 - installed right so let me close this
02:58 - window and you can see uh python
03:02 - 3.2.1 for Mac OS is successfully
03:05 - installed so once python is successfully
03:08 - installed I can close this window and
03:11 - then I can move this uh PKG file to the
03:14 - bin because I no longer need it so I'm
03:17 - going to click on move to bin which is
03:19 - going to move this file to the bin once
03:22 - python is installed I can open the
03:25 - terminal again so let me quit the
03:27 - terminal let me open the terminal once
03:29 - again
03:30 - and here I'm going to give this python
03:32 - command so I'm going to give Python 3
03:36 - and space hyphen hyphen version and then
03:38 - press enter and here I can see the
03:41 - version of python which is python
03:43 - 3.2.1 so python is working now in order
03:48 - to uh get into the python interactive
03:51 - shell you can give uh this command which
03:53 - is Python 3 and then press enter and you
03:57 - will go into the python uh uh repple
04:01 - here you can evaluate uh your python
04:03 - command for example if I write 2 + uh 5
04:07 - here it's going to give the output I can
04:10 - give a print command so I'm going to
04:13 - just write print and then inside the
04:17 - parentheses and double quotes I can just
04:19 - write hello world here and then press
04:22 - enter and it's going to print hello
04:24 - world so on the python terminal it's
04:27 - working now in order to quit from python
04:29 - repple you can uh give control Zed
04:34 - command or you can uh write quit here
04:38 - and then these two parentheses and you
04:41 - will come out of uh this python repple
04:44 - now we can also uh try the python idle
04:49 - or python launcher so let me click on
04:51 - python launcher and it's going to show
04:55 - you this kind of uh window and here it
04:58 - says settings for uh file type which is
05:01 - python script
05:03 - interpreter and I can run this python
05:06 - launcher in the terminal window right so
05:09 - here I can set the python related stuff
05:14 - for my python uh scripts or for the
05:19 - python Command right so because I have
05:22 - checked this uh
05:24 - checkbox my Python 3 command runs in the
05:28 - terminal also if I check this checkbox
05:30 - it says allow override with hashbang in
05:34 - the script so I can use uh this override
05:37 - with the script I also have other
05:40 - options which I can check which is for
05:42 - debug parser output verbos uh import and
05:46 - other options here if I want to add
05:49 - other flags I can uh use the other flags
05:53 - option also if I want to uh reset all
05:56 - these settings to the factory reset I
05:58 - can just click on reset to factory
06:01 - settings when I go to launcher once
06:04 - again I can also use this idle so I can
06:07 - click on this idle tool and then it says
06:11 - python would like to access files in
06:14 - your documents folder because it's going
06:15 - to create a file in your documents
06:18 - folder so I'm going to click on okay
06:20 - which is going to create a file in my
06:23 - documents folder now here also I can uh
06:27 - evaluate my commands for example 2+ six
06:30 - and it's going to give me the output and
06:32 - also I can uh print any text here so I'm
06:35 - going to just write print and then I can
06:38 - use these double codes and then in the
06:40 - double Cotes I can just write uh hello
06:45 - world here and then press enter and this
06:48 - works right so I can uh use this idle to
06:53 - uh run my python commands now let's say
06:58 - if you have a python file you want to
06:59 - create a python script and then run it
07:02 - so for that we are going to open the
07:04 - terminal once again and then go to the
07:08 - folder where you want to create your
07:10 - python script so so right now I'm in my
07:12 - uh home folder here I'm going to CD into
07:15 - my documents folder and here I'm going
07:18 - to create a new uh directory I'm going
07:21 - to just write mkdir and then I'm going
07:24 - to name my directory as python projects
07:28 - and then press enter and then I'm going
07:30 - to CD into my python projects folder and
07:33 - here I'm going to create a python file
07:36 - so let me just uh open this destination
07:42 - in the finder also so I was in my
07:45 - documents folder in my documents folder
07:48 - I have created this python projects
07:50 - folder right so to create a python
07:53 - script you can give this command which
07:56 - is touch and then your python file name
08:00 - let's say I'm going to name my file as
08:02 - hello.py py is the extension we used
08:05 - with the python file and then press
08:07 - enter it creates this python script
08:11 - right once the script is created you can
08:14 - right click on this hello.py file and
08:17 - then you can click on open with and by
08:20 - default it says idle so just click on
08:23 - idle here and it's going to open this uh
08:27 - file in the python ID
08:30 - right now here I can uh write my python
08:34 - script for example print once again in
08:38 - the
08:39 - parenthesis and in the double quotes
08:42 - hello world and then once uh the script
08:46 - is done I can press command s to save my
08:49 - file or I can press on file and then I
08:53 - can save my file right so I can click on
08:56 - save my uh python script is saved I can
08:59 - close this file and to run this uh
09:02 - script I can just simply run this script
09:05 - by writing simply writing Python 3 and
09:10 - then the name of uh my file is hello. py
09:13 - file so just write Python 3 space the
09:16 - name of your script and then press enter
09:18 - and it's going to print the output of
09:21 - your python script which is Hello World
09:23 - in my case so this is how you can run a
09:25 - python script using the command line or
09:29 - also one more additional tip for you
09:33 - when you install python uh it also comes
09:37 - with the python package manager which is
09:39 - called pip so you can also give this
09:42 - command which is PIP 3 hyphen hyphen
09:45 - version and then press enter and it's
09:47 - going to give you the version of pip
09:49 - later you will be able to uh install
09:52 - python packages which are created by
09:55 - some third party people or some official
09:58 - guys
09:59 - uh in order to uh import them into your
10:03 - python script and then use those
10:05 - packages in your python script so pip is
10:10 - a python package manager which you can
10:12 - use uh to install the third party
10:15 - packages also so this is how you can
10:18 - download and install python on your Mac
10:21 - operating system and uh use it to run
10:25 - your python script I hope you have
10:27 - enjoyed this video and I will see you
10:31 - one more thing you can check here is
