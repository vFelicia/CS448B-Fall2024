00:01 - hello guys welcome once again in this
00:02 - video I'm going to show you how to use
00:04 - IFL statement with your C++ program IFL
00:09 - statement are also called conditional
00:12 - statement because we use IFL statement
00:16 - to check some conditions for example I
00:19 - want to check the age of a person I can
00:22 - use if statement to check the age of a
00:25 - person using C++ so let's try to write
00:30 - the code for if condition just declare a
00:34 - variable called
00:37 - age and then I will
00:41 - output some conditions so I will say see
00:50 - out
00:53 - please enter the
00:58 - age
01:04 - and then I will ask user to enter the
01:07 - aid so I will say
01:12 - CN
01:14 - age okay now in order to check whether
01:18 - the user has entered the right age I
01:22 - will say if so this is how you can
01:26 - declare if condition if and with the
01:30 - bracket and then this curly bracket and
01:35 - in this bracket you need to give some
01:38 - condition so I will say
01:41 - if age
01:44 - is greater than
01:47 - 20
01:49 - then I will
01:51 - print the statement that the age
01:56 - entered the
01:58 - age
02:03 - is correct okay I will just build the
02:08 - program and run it and I will enter age
02:12 - 28 which is fulfilling my
02:16 - condition which is greater than 20 and
02:19 - when I press enter it shows me the
02:22 - message the age entered is correct now
02:25 - if I enter the age Which is less than 20
02:30 - then see what
02:31 - happens 13 and press enter then this
02:35 - message is not executed because this
02:40 - this condition is not true now in order
02:43 - to catch other condition other than this
02:47 - condition which is there in if statement
02:50 - we use else
02:52 - statement and how we write lse statement
02:56 - just like this so in lse statement this
03:00 - bracket doesn't come because there is no
03:03 - condition it's just C catching
03:07 - whatever this if is not fulfilling or
03:10 - whatever condition this if is not
03:12 - fulfilling so it doesn't require any
03:15 - bracket so I will
03:17 - say in the else condition the age
03:20 - entered is not
03:23 - correct now when I run the
03:26 - program and if this time I will enter
03:30 - the age Which is less than 20 then it
03:33 - will go the program will go here and it
03:36 - will see age is uh less than 20 so it's
03:42 - not greater than 20 then it will go to
03:44 - else condition and print this message
03:48 - okay so this is the sequence and it says
03:52 - ages age entered is not correct right
03:56 - which is this
03:57 - statement now there are
04:00 - other conditions you can give an if
04:03 - statement this is greater than condition
04:07 - you can give uh for example equal to
04:11 - conditions so you can give equal equal
04:14 - to check the equality so note here we
04:18 - are not giving 1 equal to sign we are
04:22 - giving two equal to equal to when you
04:25 - give equal to that means you are
04:27 - assigning some value and when you write
04:31 - 2 equal to that means you are checking
04:35 - the equality okay so let's check I will
04:40 - just build the program and run it and
04:43 - when I enter AG is equal 20 which is the
04:47 - correct condition and when I enter it it
04:50 - says age is
04:53 - correct now you can also
04:56 - give greater than equal to so it will
05:00 - check all the conditions of the age
05:03 - which is greater than equal to greater
05:06 - than and equal to 20 so it has it will
05:10 - check all the values which are greater
05:12 - than 20 and equal to 20 right in the
05:17 - same way it will you can also check less
05:21 - than equal to but always remember that
05:24 - equal to comes after these greater than
05:27 - or less than sign you cannot
05:30 - write it like this equal equal to
05:33 - greater than this doesn't work you need
05:35 - to write greater than and then equal to
05:39 - okay
05:40 - now you can also
05:43 - write smaller than
05:47 - with which is uh which will check
05:50 - whether age is smaller than 20 or not
05:53 - okay and the other conditions you can
05:56 - write is or condition so so
06:00 - if age is equal to
06:06 - 20 or so we can check or condition with
06:12 - this pipe symbol so two times this pipe
06:15 - symbol just give it and just write R
06:21 - ages greater
06:25 - than
06:26 - 20 okay so this is
06:29 - just seeing whether the age is equal to
06:33 - 20 or so age is greater than 20 so if I
06:39 - enter the age is equal to 20 it will
06:41 - execute this statement and or if I enter
06:46 - the age greater than 20 then also it
06:49 - will check it will execute this
06:51 - statement because we
06:54 - are uh executing or condition or means
06:58 - this or or this whatever condition is
07:01 - true it will execute right so I will run
07:05 - the program and I will enter the age 20
07:10 - which is true and it says age is correct
07:14 - once again I will enter the age 23 which
07:17 - is greater than 23 and then also it says
07:23 - age enter this correct I think I need to
07:26 - build the program and then run it and
07:29 - once again 23 and it says age entered is
07:34 - correct okay in the same way you
07:38 - can
07:40 - check and condition so for example I
07:44 - will declare one more
07:48 - variable
07:51 - called
07:55 - int height okay and I will tell the user
08:02 - to enter the height also okay please
08:05 - enter
08:08 - the height and I will just tell the user
08:13 - to enter the height also so you will
08:16 - user will enter age and height and then
08:19 - I will give end
08:22 - condition and I will say if age is equal
08:26 - to
08:27 - 20 and
08:33 - height is equal
08:40 - to
08:42 - 100
08:43 - cm
08:45 - then tell me this message or show me
08:48 - this message age entered is correct age
08:54 - and height entered is correct okay
08:59 - otherwise age and height entered is not
09:01 - correct so I will just save it and run
09:05 - build the
09:06 - program here I forget equal to double
09:09 - equal to and see what happened it's
09:12 - showing me the message right so just
09:16 - write double equal to here and build
09:19 - your program and run your program and
09:22 - this time I will enter the age is equal
09:25 - to 20 and height is equal to 100
09:29 - and it says age and height entered is
09:32 - correct or otherwise I will enter the
09:35 - wrong
09:37 - value 25 or
09:40 - 45 and height is equal to 90 and you can
09:46 - see the age and height is not correct
09:51 - okay so this end statement checks
09:55 - whether
09:57 - this statement is true true and this
10:00 - statement is true so both statement has
10:02 - to be true in this and condition
10:06 - right so I hope you have understood the
10:09 - concept of if conditional statement and
10:13 - I hope you have enjoyed this video
10:14 - please wait comment and subscribe and
10:16 - bye for now
