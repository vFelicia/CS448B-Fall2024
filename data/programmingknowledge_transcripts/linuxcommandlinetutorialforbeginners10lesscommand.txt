00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Linux command line tutorial for
00:04 - beginners in this video we will see how
00:06 - we can use less command in Linux less
00:09 - command we can use to uh you know read
00:12 - the files or if you want to search
00:14 - something inside the file something like
00:17 - patterns or some word you can use less
00:20 - command conveniently to read or uh
00:23 - search in the file so let's see how we
00:25 - can use it so first of all I'm going to
00:28 - open my terminal
00:30 - and first of all I will navigate to my
00:33 - desktop where this big. text file is
00:36 - there so first of all I will CD to the
00:39 - desktop and first of all uh because this
00:42 - is a big file and I want to for example
00:46 - see the content of uh this big text file
00:49 - I want to use cat for you because we
00:51 - have learned uh you can use cat to uh
00:55 - you know print the content of the file
00:57 - so I'm going to use big. text and when I
01:00 - press enter you can see it's printing
01:02 - the content of this text file and
01:04 - because it's really big it's printing
01:07 - and printing and printing and uh for
01:10 - example you want to read from the
01:13 - starting of this uh file when it's uh
01:17 - done Printing and you want to go up
01:20 - let's see what happens so first of all
01:23 - uh let it complete so it's completed and
01:25 - when I want to go to the top and I want
01:27 - to read the content the terminal doesn't
01:30 - allow me to go beyond a certain level so
01:34 - it's not going to the you know starting
01:36 - of the text file that's why we can use
01:40 - our less command to overcome this
01:42 - problems plus less has uh its own
01:45 - features right so I will first of all uh
01:48 - clear the terminal and now I'm going to
01:51 - use less for you know reading the file
01:56 - content so first of all for using less
01:59 - you just just need to you know write
02:01 - less and the name of the file which is
02:04 - big. text right and press enter and you
02:08 - can see uh it will show you the content
02:12 - of the file from the starting so this is
02:14 - the starting of the file and it will
02:17 - show you uh you know some text until uh
02:21 - this terminal allows it to show it and
02:23 - if you want to see the content of the
02:25 - file more you can hit the down arrow key
02:30 - so down arrow key to go one line down at
02:33 - a time you can see you can read down and
02:38 - if you hit up Arrow then you can uh read
02:42 - up or you can uh you know browse over uh
02:46 - the file in the you know up uh now if
02:50 - you want to go through the file Page by
02:54 - Page what uh you can use is you can use
02:58 - a space uh
03:00 - key to uh navigate your to your file
03:03 - Page by page so when I press uh space
03:07 - it's going to show me the next page next
03:10 - page next page next page and it'll show
03:13 - me again and again next page so for uh
03:17 - the you know going through the page
03:20 - downwards you can use space uh key now
03:24 - if you want to go upwards Page by Page
03:27 - you can use capital b or B ke key okay
03:32 - and you can just uh Press B and you will
03:35 - go one page up at a time when you press
03:39 - B okay now if you want to go uh at the
03:43 - end of the file you can just uh press
03:47 - capital G so press shift and G so uh it
03:52 - will be capital G so press shift and G
03:55 - and it'll uh you know browse to the end
03:59 - of for your text file right and now if
04:03 - you want to go uh at the top at the
04:05 - starting of your file you can just type
04:08 - one and then G and it will go at the
04:13 - beginning of the file so capital Z using
04:16 - shift g at the end and when you press
04:19 - one G then it'll go at the top right
04:23 - once again capital g at the end and when
04:27 - I press small G also it will uh browse
04:30 - me to the top also so small G for going
04:33 - to the top and capital G for going to
04:36 - the end right now for example I want to
04:40 - go at the top and now I want to search
04:42 - something inside the text file from up
04:46 - to down so I can use uh this uh forward
04:49 - slash which says uh this less that we
04:53 - want to search from up to down some word
04:56 - and the word for example we are looking
04:58 - for is book inside this text file right
05:02 - and when you press enter it's going to
05:05 - uh you know show you or highlight the
05:08 - first uh book keyword which you are
05:11 - searching for which is this one and now

05:17 - book in the text file you can press n to
05:21 - go to the next item which is uh book
05:25 - right so you can see there are so many
05:27 - book and we are search or we are going
05:30 - from top to down right so you can see
05:34 - there are so many book Words inside this
05:37 - text file and uh when we are done with
05:42 - uh you know the searching and it's the
05:45 - end of the file it will say pattern not
05:47 - found so now this book is the last uh
05:50 - iteration of this word book right uh
05:54 - after that when you press next or n it's
05:57 - going to uh show this message with says
06:00 - pattern not found now sometimes you may
06:03 - want to search from down to up and for
06:06 - this you can use this question mark for
06:09 - searching from down to up and then you
06:12 - can uh you know give your keyword which
06:15 - you are looking for and and press enter
06:17 - and the first uh word from the down is
06:20 - uh this itself and then when you press n
