00:00 - hello friends welcome to programming
00:02 - knowledge in this video I will show you
00:05 - how to use limit keyword in query
00:08 - language in MySQL it's a very small
00:11 - topic actually consider a scenario where
00:15 - you don't need to show all the records
00:19 - present in your database instead of it
00:21 - you want to show a specific amount of
00:23 - data so for that we can use limit
00:27 - keyword we can set a limit and MySQL
00:32 - server will display only those amount of
00:34 - records okay so let us first open your
00:39 - terminal
00:53 - so databases okay so use data test and
01:07 - now show tables so as you can see we
01:17 - have one table here stone table let's
01:22 - fire some query select star for them now
01:30 - as you can see we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
01:35 - and 10 records it display here stand
01:40 - rows so now we don't need to display all
01:45 - the tentacles now I want this server
01:48 - will display only five records okay so
01:52 - you right select star from student and
01:56 - limit then number of records that you
02:01 - wanted to display five as you can say
02:06 - five rows it will display only five rows
02:11 - now if you write two then it will
02:15 - display only two one if you write the
02:21 - number of records which is higher than
02:24 - the number of records present in your
02:26 - database then it will store all the
02:28 - records okay so let me just close it and
02:34 - open MySQL workbench
02:43 - okay so here you can see total land
02:48 - records
02:49 - now select start from student where
02:54 - let's say roll number is greater than
03:00 - what okay here you can see total five
03:09 - rows are written and I want to display
03:15 - only three records so I said limit to
03:19 - three okay here you can see three rows
03:26 - returned and it will display say their
03:28 - house now let us take one more example
03:38 - select name and surname from student
03:45 - where roll number is resident well or
03:51 - let's say name is equal to LX okay let
04:02 - me just write 16 here mmm
04:13 - let me just remove it select name
04:18 - surname from student Valderrama greater
04:21 - than 16 our name is equal to LS so it is
04:26 - plus 3 records okay now I want only this
04:31 - Alex Russo
04:32 - so I said limit is 1 so it will display
04:37 - only one record as you can see so this
04:42 - is how you can set limit for your record
04:46 - to be displayed on the screen thanks for
04:49 - watching
