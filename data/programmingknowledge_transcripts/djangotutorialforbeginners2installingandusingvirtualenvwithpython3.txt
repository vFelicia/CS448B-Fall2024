00:00 - I welcome you all to programming
00:02 - knowledge so this is a second tutorial
00:04 - of a jungle series so in the first
00:06 - tutorial I showed you how you can
00:08 - install shangguan your local machine you
00:10 - can initialize a jungle project as well
00:12 - a jam would happen or local machine so I
00:15 - wanted to tell you that like in the
00:19 - previous a tool I should told you like
00:21 - we were going to move with the request
00:23 - and response part but before this I
00:25 - wanted to show you that like I want to
00:28 - discuss a very important topic with you
00:30 - and that was about virtual environment
00:31 - so I only want to cook only want to
00:35 - focus on this topic only in this lecture
00:38 - because this topic has its own unique
00:41 - importance and value because it has a it
00:44 - has a good concept in itself and you
00:47 - need to have a good knowledge about
00:49 - virtual environments how you can work
00:50 - with both general environment variables
00:52 - so because this will really help you
00:55 - like suppose you can have to kiss him
00:57 - like to seen are you lying you to learn
01:01 - about virtual environment suppose you
01:03 - have made your jungle project and you
01:04 - want to deploy the jungle for this
01:06 - online so in order to deploy this angle
01:10 - toward project online you own a server
01:13 - you need to have a have a record of all
01:15 - the external libraries dependencies and
01:17 - packages you have used in this project
01:20 - in a file called requirement of THD so
01:24 - that the server can install those
01:26 - dependencies packages and libraries on
01:29 - on the server on the cloud I mean the
01:32 - server can install install that
01:33 - dependencies packages and libraries on
01:36 - the cloud then the server will install
01:37 - your application on the cloud and with
01:40 - the help of both the things and the both
01:42 - the things gets installed then you are
01:43 - only able to run this application or
01:45 - second case you can have that when you
01:48 - are working in a team and there might be
01:50 - a possibility you want to share this
01:51 - code with someone else you want to share
01:53 - this whole project with someone else and
01:55 - they want to run this project on their
01:57 - machine or server as well but if they
02:00 - want to run this project on the machine
02:02 - or the server server the server they
02:04 - need to have the list of those external
02:07 - libraries packages and dependencies you
02:09 - have mentioned in your project so that
02:12 - they can get
02:13 - those dependencies install ponds either
02:15 - on the machine or on the server in order
02:17 - to run this particular application so
02:22 - without any further delay I again
02:24 - welcome you all to programming knowledge
02:26 - and so the my first step would be I have
02:30 - created a folder on my desktop with the
02:33 - name programming knowledge and the very
02:35 - first step I am going to do is create a
02:36 - Django project Django admin start
02:42 - project my first project so when I run
02:53 - this command so I'm able to create a
02:56 - project inside this directory here you
02:58 - can see this you can even run the
03:01 - directory command as well so this will
03:04 - make sure that you have created the
03:05 - project now when you have made the
03:07 - project you would move him into the
03:10 - project folder with the command CD my
03:13 - first project so I am inside that my
03:19 - project I do you know so now I would
03:23 - create a simple rather I would say that
03:26 - I would initialize a app inside this
03:28 - project folder so in the you can get
03:31 - familiar with this command lines in my
03:32 - previous tutorial with the name Python
03:37 - manage dot P by start app and you can
03:44 - name anything to be the first half I
03:47 - would name this as my first so this
03:57 - looks good so this has created a hat
04:02 - inside my project directory so to be
04:06 - show this I move again on the directory
04:07 - command and Pips is my first time
04:09 - installed so I'm going to slow this
04:13 - because this has a very important
04:15 - concept now now I would run Python
04:22 - manage
04:24 - not py run sir worth now I hope the
04:33 - server get started ok nice running so
04:35 - either you can copy this address or you
04:37 - can say local post-its team has won 20
04:43 - cents on 0.1 I'm in one twenty seven
04:46 - point four point four point one miles
04:47 - with the port I'm at 8,000 solo follows
04:52 - :
04:52 - 8,000 is same as this address so this is
04:58 - the same as localhost colon 8080 to
05:03 - terminate this give this four kill this
05:06 - server so I would cross this and now I
05:09 - would open the command again now I'm
05:14 - going to tell you how why I want going
05:16 - to show this I'm Windell and I'm going
05:18 - slow with this because this is a very
05:20 - important concept so now I will move to
05:23 - my desktop I would move to the
05:29 - programming knowledge folder then I
05:31 - would go to the my project folder okay
05:38 - so now I am inside my project folder so
05:41 - you can have a graphical view of it all
05:43 - so that this is the happening three
05:45 - times inside my project folder so now so
05:49 - I start started the server and it was
05:51 - running fine so I will refresh this page
05:54 - so the sober one friend no I guess so
05:57 - it's not running so because I had
05:59 - terminated the process so okay now it
06:02 - looks fine so no I what I want to tell
06:05 - you is you can open of your command line
06:12 - and time it install go to goal the NP
06:21 - this is need this fact it is particular
06:23 - needed to create a virtual environment
06:25 - so so this is requirement already
06:28 - satisfied class I already installed this
06:30 - and now I would move to my project
06:33 - directory and wait create a virtual
06:36 - environment
06:37 - variable with virtual e and B now you
06:41 - can give any name to this it could be my
06:44 - environment my first environment Django
06:47 - environment variable it could be any
06:48 - name so you can have a name of your own
06:50 - so I will give it my II and V so this
06:56 - data this process takes a minute or so
06:58 - so this would create a water environment
07:00 - variable so by the time it gets
07:03 - installed I would like to I will tell
07:05 - you something like me till now we have
07:07 - created the environment variable name
07:11 - now we take order to use this
07:14 - environment variable name we need to
07:17 - activate this and why we are doing so
07:20 - because this would help us to keep
07:25 - record of all the dependencies and
07:28 - packages required in order to be
07:31 - mentioned in requirements of tht file so
07:33 - we can use them so this is a very good
07:36 - process so now so this environment has
07:41 - been installed life I would activate so
07:44 - I would type so before this I would show
07:47 - you that time in the full program
07:50 - acknowledged no I mean the prototype if
07:51 - this my tnb variable has finished
07:53 - edition eyes with the folder so you can
07:56 - have a look at this folder my in the
07:58 - scripts then there is activate so in
08:00 - order to activate this variable so what
08:04 - I need to do is I will go so this is the
08:07 - same as I would go my E and V / scripts
08:15 - / activate activate these may show the
08:22 - direction of / / sign so please please
08:27 - make a note of it so this would activate
08:29 - the virtual environment inside look for
08:32 - it yeah this looks pretty good
08:34 - so the mind env is now working here as a
08:38 - virtual environment variable which will
08:41 - help us a keep track or over things so
08:44 - what I want you to do this the first
08:45 - thing I want to do the earlier we land
08:48 - come on Python manage
08:50 - - what py run sir wood and the server
08:53 - had started on her machine so that look
08:56 - pretty simple now I would type the same
08:59 - command again Python sorry for this
09:04 - spider-man H dot py run server so now
09:15 - you see this process doesn't get started
09:19 - so it says couldn't import Django are
09:23 - you sure it is it's installed and
09:25 - available on a Python environment
09:27 - variable so the environment variable did
09:33 - you forget to activate a virtual
09:34 - environment but I'm sure pretty sure the
09:36 - virtual environment is if activated and
09:39 - right I dislike this time I wanted to
09:43 - show you this because I would again run
09:47 - this command and it would give me the
09:48 - same error because I want to tell you
09:52 - that the Django has being installed on
09:56 - my machine so I want to tell you one
09:58 - thing that Django has installed on my
10:00 - machine but not inside my virtual
10:03 - environment so I would repeat this the
10:06 - Django earlier had installed inside mind
10:09 - my local machine but not inside my
10:12 - virtual environment so this is the same
10:15 - case when you might want to work with
10:18 - you when you work in a team and you
10:20 - might share the code with someone and he
10:23 - might somebody might hire an external
10:25 - dependency so how you can keep track
10:28 - that external it depends dependency has
10:30 - the pirate on your project so how will
10:32 - keep a track record of those things so
10:35 - you will keep a track record of those
10:36 - thing by environment variable and no
10:38 - permanent diversity the very next
10:40 - command I would tell you it's soul
10:43 - Django inside my virtual environment I'm
10:46 - for simply time pip install Django
10:54 - so this wouldn't so Django inside my
10:57 - virtual environment so I would want to
10:59 - repeat so this one is switch and on my
11:02 - inside of watch
11:04 - environment so yeah great so Django has
11:07 - been assault on a machine then the first
11:10 - thing you need to type is so I would
11:13 - like to tell you that I'm inside a
11:15 - prototype fee so Django has been
11:18 - installed so if in order to make sure
11:20 - this I would type this command tip
11:22 - threes requirement dot txt so I would
11:30 - run directed mine now you can see a file
11:32 - called requirements or a channel is
11:34 - created and I will open that file now
11:37 - this is the point I want to show you
11:39 - that in order to run this project I need
11:43 - Django has an external because John is a
11:46 - python-based web framework so it is an
11:48 - external package or you can say
11:50 - dependency which Python uses to make web
11:53 - applications so this Python package
11:56 - Django is it needed with the version 3.0
11:59 - point two in order to run this
12:01 - application so suppose I want to tell
12:04 - you so this is the now I will run the
12:06 - command below now I have made sure that
12:09 - inside my apartment
12:11 - Phe Django has been installed inside a
12:13 - virtual environment I specified those
12:15 - environment variables packages depends
12:17 - dependency inside the final requirement
12:19 - or PhD no I made sure the Django has
12:22 - been installed my virtual environment
12:26 - now I would run the command Python
12:31 - managed dot py run server so this would
12:39 - start solo now you can see the inside my
12:42 - environment variable
12:43 - I ran the store and the this word so I
12:47 - would go to this I will refresh this
12:49 - page now the server has started
12:53 - successfully so until now we have
12:56 - covered till this part sorry for this so
12:59 - what I mean with this command suppose I
13:02 - am going to tell you that
13:04 - suppose we are working on project and
13:09 - someone like I want to show you an
13:12 - example of this so these are the suppose
13:16 - you are working on a data size project
13:18 - and you're walking up on like jungle and
13:21 - someone might have come with these three
13:26 - dependencies so what you can do is you
13:29 - can hand those dependencies suppose I'm
13:32 - just for an example someone was working
13:35 - within those dependencies on your
13:37 - project as well so you can utilize this
13:40 - but you can install those these
13:43 - dependencies your packages by running a
13:47 - command I will tell you so I would first
13:49 - terminate this process so I would open
13:52 - my command line so I would go to the
13:56 - desktop folder and through having
14:00 - knowledge so now I will run the
14:02 - directory come on so yes requirement of
14:04 - HTS here and I can read this file so I'm
14:08 - at the command type installed - our
14:13 - requirements taught takes these this
14:15 - line mean that installs all those
14:18 - dependencies which are present inside
14:20 - the file requirements what tht in order
14:24 - to get working with this project so this
14:26 - would have solved all those dependencies
14:27 - so this might happen that already few of
14:31 - those dependence might be already
14:32 - satisfied like I said this dependent is
14:35 - already satisfied and this might be a
14:38 - billion of something of soap so this is
14:41 - why men already satisfied now when I
14:44 - came to matplotlib so it started with
14:48 - the process of installing those library
14:51 - so what I mentioned you so they might be
14:53 - kids someone might come and add a new
14:56 - package or dependency to it so you might
14:59 - need this in order to run the full
15:01 - application of all application so to
15:03 - keep a track record of the dependencies
15:05 - required
15:06 - you need to specify them in a in a file
15:08 - of requirement of EFT and the server
15:10 - does the same very same thing when you
15:12 - deploy your application and the server
15:15 - in order to run the application on the
15:18 - cloud you need to define those
15:21 - dependencies which are needed to run the
15:23 - application so this is a very important
15:25 - concept and install those you can run
15:28 - this command type install - our
15:30 - requirement
15:31 - PhD in order to learn all those
15:33 - application so thank you very much very
15:37 - much thank you again welcome you all to
15:39 - programming knowledge so in the next
15:41 - tutorial I'm going to cover with the
15:43 - request and the response part so I will
15:46 - thank everyone thank you
