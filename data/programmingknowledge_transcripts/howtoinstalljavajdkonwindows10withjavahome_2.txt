00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can download and install
00:04 - java jdk on your Windows 10 operating
00:06 - system so let's get started first of all
00:10 - we are going to check whether Java is
00:12 - already installed on our system or not
00:14 - and then we are going to see how we can
00:16 - install Java so to check whether Java is
00:19 - already installed you can just search
00:21 - for CMD and then press Enter and once
00:25 - the command prompt is open you can just
00:27 - write Java - version here and if it says
00:31 - Java is not recognized as an internal or
00:35 - external command that means Java is most
00:37 - probably not installed in your Windows
00:39 - operating system so let's get started we
00:43 - are going to just open our browser and
00:45 - search for java jdk and the first link
00:48 - which will appear here will be from
00:50 - oracle comm I'm going to provide the
00:52 - link in the description of this video
00:54 - also so just open the link which is from
00:57 - Oracle comm so once this website is open
01:02 - you can see at the time of making this
01:04 - video Java 14 is the latest version
01:08 - available and you can download it by
01:11 - just clicking on this JDK download link
01:14 - so I'm going to just click on JDK
01:16 - download we're just going to open this
01:19 - kind of webpage so here you need to just
01:23 - scroll down and locate the Windows
01:26 - operating system executable file so you
01:29 - can see Windows x64 installer we will
01:32 - choose this one and you can see this
01:35 - executable file we can download for Java
01:38 - 14 so just click on this link which is
01:42 - going to start the download of this
01:44 - executable file in between you will be
01:47 - asked to just check this checkbox and
01:50 - then click on this download button so
01:55 - once this executable file is downloaded
01:57 - I am going to just click on this file
01:59 - and now you can see that this
02:01 - installation wizard has been started so
02:04 - I'm going to just click on next here and
02:05 - this will be the location where your
02:08 - java jdk will be installed so if you
02:11 - don't have the good reason to change it
02:12 - just leave
02:13 - as default and then click on next and
02:15 - then just wait for the installation to
02:18 - complete and after some time you will
02:20 - see this message which says Java SE
02:23 - development 14 point 0.1 successfully
02:26 - installed that means Java is installed
02:28 - on our Windows operating system so I'm
02:31 - going to just close this window and
02:34 - let's see where Java is installed on our
02:38 - Windows operating system so just go to
02:40 - this PC and then click on local Drive
02:43 - and then we are going to go to the
02:46 - Program Files and here you can see the
02:49 - job of folder so I'm going to go inside
02:51 - the Java folder and once you are inside
02:54 - the Java folder you will see the JDK
02:56 - directory here now in the newer version
02:59 - of Java JDK you will not see JRE folder
03:04 - here so JRE comes with the JDK bundle so
03:07 - you don't need to you know install it
03:11 - separately or do anything here so just
03:14 - go inside the JDK folder and now we are
03:18 - going to set the environment variables
03:20 - for our Java command to work with it so
03:24 - you need to go inside the bin folder for
03:26 - that and then just copy this path up to
03:29 - bin folder inside the Java so to set the
03:32 - environment variables you just need to
03:34 - search for environment variables and you
03:38 - will see this result here which says
03:41 - added the system environment variables
03:43 - so such few letters of environment and
03:46 - you will see this result so just click
03:49 - on this result which says added the
03:50 - system environment variables and then
03:53 - here you need to go to this section
03:56 - which says environment variables and now
03:59 - you can add the Java bin environment
04:02 - variable here so under system variable
04:05 - you will see this path variable so just
04:07 - select this and then click on add it and
04:11 - here you need to click on new and add
04:14 - this path which you have copied so this
04:17 - is the path up to bin which we have
04:19 - copied so you just need to click new and
04:22 - then paste this path so once you have
04:25 - added this just click on OK
04:27 - also some application requires Java home
04:29 - to be added into the environment
04:31 - variables so to add Java home in your
04:34 - environment variables you can just click
04:37 - on new under system variables so just
04:39 - click on new and then under variable
04:43 - name just write Java home in capital so
04:46 - Java underscore home all in capital and
04:50 - then the variable value will be the JDK
04:55 - folder path so you just need to go up to
04:57 - JDK folder you don't need to go inside
05:00 - the bin folder okay so up to JDK folder
05:03 - just copy this path and then just paste
05:06 - it as the variable value and then click
05:09 - OK this is going to add this Java home
05:12 - variable into your system variable once
05:16 - you are done with this just click on OK
05:19 - and then click on ok so this means that
05:23 - Java home variable and Java environment
05:26 - variable is added into your environment
05:29 - variables now what we are going to do is
05:31 - we are going to check whether Java
05:33 - command is working with our command
05:36 - prompt or not so just close any other
05:38 - command prompt which you have previously
05:40 - opened and then just open the command
05:44 - prompt once again so just write CMD and
05:46 - then just click on command prompt here
05:48 - and here we are going to check once
05:51 - again Java version command so I'm going
05:54 - to just write Java - version here and
05:58 - it's going to show the version of Java
06:01 - which you have installed so we have
06:03 - installed Java 14 point zero point one
06:05 - so it's going to show us this result you
06:08 - can also run the Java C command so Java
06:11 - C - version and it's also going to show
06:15 - you the java c version now let's do
06:19 - something interesting so let's compile a
06:21 - java program with this java c command so
06:25 - here i'm going to open my folder
06:26 - explorer and i will navigate to the
06:29 - desktop folder and here let's create a
06:33 - file but before that I'm going to just
06:36 - click on View here and I'm going to just
06:38 - check this checkbox with sales filename
06:41 - which is going to show us the file name
06:43 - extension also now I'm going to create a
06:46 - new file so right click and then new and
06:49 - then let's create this file which says a
06:52 - text document for now and I'm going to
06:55 - just name it as HelloWorld dot Java okay
06:59 - so make sure that no text extension is
07:02 - here and then press Enter which is going
07:05 - to give you this warning which says I'm
07:07 - sure you want to change it I will say
07:09 - yes which is going to create this Java
07:12 - file now I'm going to just open this
07:14 - file using a notepad or any other
07:16 - application you can use ide likes
07:19 - eclipse or NetBeans or IntelliJ IDEA for
07:22 - this purpose also but we just want to
07:25 - test whether Java is working so notepad
07:28 - will be okay so you can just click on
07:32 - open width here and then click on
07:35 - notepad here and then click OK
07:38 - which is going to open this file using
07:40 - notepad and now you can just write a
07:44 - simple Java HelloWorld program you can
07:47 - search this halal program anywhere on
07:50 - internet so I'm not going to go into the
07:52 - details just save this file and once the
07:56 - file is saved what you need to do is you
07:58 - just need to close this file and now
08:01 - just open the command prompt once again
08:02 - and then you can just CD to the desktop
08:05 - folder and here to compile your
08:07 - HelloWorld dot Java file you can just
08:10 - give this command Java C and the name of
08:12 - your file which is HelloWorld dot Java
08:14 - and then press ENTER and what this is
08:17 - going to do is it's going to compile
08:19 - your hello world dot java file and now
08:22 - you can see that this hello world dot
08:24 - class file is created into our desktop
08:28 - folder so you can see this file is
08:31 - created this is an executable file so we
08:34 - can run this executable file with the
08:36 - Java command so just write Java and the
08:38 - name of the executable file you don't
08:40 - need to give the dot class extension at
08:42 - the end here so just write Java and the
08:45 - name of your executables file and it's
08:47 - going to run this executable file and
08:49 - it's going to print the result so this
08:52 - is how you can
08:53 - run your Java program using this Java
08:56 - development kit so this is how you can
08:59 - install Java JDK on your Windows 10
09:02 - operating system I hope you've enjoyed
09:04 - this video and I will see you in the
09:06 - next video
