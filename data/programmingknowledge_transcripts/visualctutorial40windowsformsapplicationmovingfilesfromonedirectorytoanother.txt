00:01 - hello guys welcome once again in this
00:04 - video I will show you how to move a file
00:08 - from One Directory to other
00:12 - directory so let me give you a short
00:16 - demo what I'm going to
00:18 - do and show you
00:21 - today so I have this choose file source
00:28 - button and choose file
00:30 - destination button so for example I will
00:34 - choose a file
00:36 - [Music]
00:37 - from
00:39 - any part or any folder of
00:44 - my
00:46 - computer so for example I choose this
00:49 - Untitled PNG
00:53 - file and I want to move this file to the
00:57 - other
00:58 - folder so I will choose the destination
01:01 - folder for
01:03 - it and choose
01:07 - any or any file from
01:10 - him so this is this is going to be the
01:15 - source folder and this is going to be
01:18 - the source uh destination folder and
01:22 - this file Untitled p p PNG we are going
01:26 - to move from my desktop to this Windows
01:31 - 7 share
01:34 - folder and I also want to change the
01:37 - name of my PNG so instead of this
01:41 - Untitled PNG I want to
01:45 - change
01:46 - it
01:48 - as 1 2 3 4 for example 1 2 3 4
01:54 - PNG okay and when I press
01:57 - this change directory
02:02 - button the message comes chain directory
02:06 - success so directory is
02:10 - successfully changed or folder location
02:13 - of this Untitled PNG is successfully
02:17 - Chang with a name 1 2 3 4 so this file
02:22 - name is now
02:24 - this and when we check in our folder we
02:28 - have
02:31 - the same
02:33 - directory where we are Desiring to place
02:38 - it so how to change the file directory
02:42 - or folder from
02:44 - One path to another I will show
02:48 - you so what I have done is I have done
02:52 - one text field whose name is text field
02:57 - one and second
03:00 - whose name is text box 2 okay not text
03:05 - field I have have the habit of taking
03:10 - the
03:11 - Java terminology so text box one and
03:17 - text box
03:19 - two and I have taken two buttons for
03:23 - choosing the path of the files one for
03:26 - Source One for
03:28 - Destination and when I click this
03:31 - choose
03:34 - source
03:35 - file I think by the time or by this time
03:42 - you should know how to open a file
03:47 - dialogue so by using these three lines
03:51 - you can open and set the file name into
03:58 - your text box which is text box number
04:04 - one
04:05 - so I will just quickly run through it
04:10 - open file dialogue cab your variable
04:13 - name is equal to GC open file dialogue
04:17 - and this variable comes here Arrow
04:20 - pointer show
04:22 - dialogue and
04:25 - then your text field
04:28 - name Arrow pointer text and then this
04:33 - variable comes here and we are taking
04:36 - the file name from The
04:40 - Chosen dialogue and placing the
04:44 - path into our text box
04:48 - two same we are doing for
04:51 - this but this time we are doing and
04:54 - placing our text into the text box two
05:00 - so
05:01 - just same code I have written here but
05:07 - but I have just
05:09 - changed
05:11 - this text box 2 instead of text text box
05:15 - one okay so this is for choosing
05:19 - the destination
05:22 - folder now uh main code how to move the
05:27 - file from One Directory to another
05:30 - is in this button
05:33 - event so take a
05:35 - button and double click
05:38 - it and write
05:42 - file double colon
05:45 - move and this is your Source
05:49 - folder path and this is your destination
05:53 - folder path so we are taking our source
05:56 - folder path in our text field
06:00 - or text box one so we are writing here
06:03 - textbox one Arrow pointer text and we
06:07 - are we want to change the folder to the
06:13 - destination which is in text box 2 so
06:18 - this is the path for text
06:21 - box path for the
06:26 - destination and when this move is
06:30 - successfully done we are displaying the
06:32 - message
06:34 - that change directory is
06:39 - successful okay so this is a TW line
06:44 - code and when you run the
06:47 - program you can
06:49 - choose the file once again this file I'm
06:53 - choosing
06:54 - from my Windows
06:58 - share
07:02 - okay and once again I want to move it to
07:06 - my
07:10 - desktop so I have chosen
07:14 - desktop and I will choose one any
07:18 - file and this name I will change
07:22 - whatever I want to name my 1 2 3 4 PNG
07:27 - once again so I want to change the
07:32 - name now to
07:35 - 5 6 7
07:37 - 89 so previously it was 1 2 3 4 and now
07:43 - it's 1 29.png
07:46 - and when I click this change
07:55 - directory so I will
07:58 - get
08:00 - the message that my directory is
08:02 - changed so in this way you can change
08:06 - the file directly directory from one
08:10 - folder to
08:11 - another I hope you have enjoyed this
