00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can download and install
00:03 - Oracle Java JDK on your window operating
00:07 - system so let's get started so I'm going
00:10 - to first of all open my favorite browser
00:14 - and search for Oracle Java JDK and just
00:18 - click the first link which will appear
00:20 - in the result I'm going to also provide
00:22 - the link in the description of the video
00:23 - so you can directly click on the link
00:26 - which I'm just opening and here you will
00:30 - see a Java SE 14 which is the latest
00:34 - version of Java at the time of making
00:36 - this video and also you will see Oracle
00:39 - JDK here and JDK downloads button here
00:43 - so I'm going to just click on this JDK
00:45 - download link and I'm going to just
00:49 - scroll down a little where I can see the
00:53 - Linux related packages here and windows
00:57 - packages and Mac OS packages so because
01:01 - Ubuntu is a debian-based Linux operating
01:04 - system so we are going to download this
01:06 - first option here which is for JDK 14
01:09 - Linux access 64 bin dot DB file so I'm
01:14 - going to just click on this file and
01:16 - then I'm going to just accept license
01:20 - terms and conditions and then click on
01:22 - download JDK 14 and now I'm going to
01:25 - just click on save file and then click
01:27 - on OK
01:28 - which is going to start the download of
01:30 - this de B file so I'm going to wait for
01:33 - the download to complete by the meantime
01:35 - we can also check which version of Java
01:37 - installed right now on my open to
01:40 - operating system I don't have any Java
01:41 - installed on my open to operating system
01:43 - but to check you can open the terminal
01:46 - by just pressing ctrl alt T or by just
01:50 - going to the show application and search
01:52 - for the terminal and once the terminal
01:55 - is open you can just write Java - -
02:00 - version here and then press Enter and
02:02 - you will see the Java version if it's
02:05 - installed or it's going to give you the
02:08 - options to install Java JDK on your
02:13 - open to operating system so you can see
02:16 - all these options are for open JDK and
02:19 - not for Java JDK so that's why I have
02:23 - chosen the other route but if you want
02:26 - to install the open JDK then you can use
02:30 - these commands also and once this file
02:33 - is downloaded we are going to go to the
02:35 - location where it's downloaded so I'm
02:37 - going to open the terminal just by just
02:39 - pressing ctrl alt T button and then we
02:43 - are going to just navigate to this
02:46 - location where we have downloaded this
02:48 - file and list out all the files and now
02:52 - in order to run this file I'm going to
02:54 - just give this command sudo DP kg - I
02:58 - and the name of the file and then press
03:01 - ENTER and then give my Ubuntu's password
03:04 - which is going to start the installation
03:06 - of this JDK on my Ubuntu operating
03:10 - system and once this is done the next
03:14 - step is to use the update alternative
03:18 - command to set the path to the Oracle
03:22 - Java executable so all these commands
03:25 - I'm going to give you in the description
03:26 - of this video which I'm going to use
03:29 - here so the next command is this command
03:33 - which is sudo update - alternatives
03:36 - space - I have been install and then
03:40 - this path Java and then user Lib JVM jdk
03:44 - 14 bin Java path okay and then space 1
03:48 - so just give this command and then press
03:52 - Enter so this update alternative command
03:54 - has given me the error which says our
03:57 - alternative path doesn't exists because
03:59 - we have installed 14 point 0.1 and we
04:03 - are giving this path so let's see which
04:06 - path exists for the JDK file so I'm
04:09 - going to just do LS and then give this
04:13 - command user forces live /j BM which I
04:18 - have copied from here and then I'm going
04:20 - to just give this command and the folder
04:23 - name is JDK 14 point 0.1
04:27 - this was the thing I was missing so I
04:30 - will give this alternative command once
04:33 - again
04:33 - and here I'm going to replace this JDK
04:36 - 14 folder by the folder which is created
04:41 - by JDK for us which is JDK - fourteen
04:44 - point zero point one and then press
04:46 - ENTER once again and it's going to give
04:49 - you this output which is fine we are
04:53 - going to give the next update
04:55 - alternative command now for the Java C
04:58 - and this is the command this also I'm
05:02 - going to give you in the description of
05:03 - this video and here also we need to
05:06 - update this folder part which is
05:08 - fourteen point zero point one here and
05:12 - then press ENTER which is going to give
05:15 - you this kind of output now once you
05:17 - have given all these commands you can
05:19 - verify the version of Java by just
05:21 - giving this command which is Java - -
05:24 - version and it's going to give you this
05:28 - kind of output which is Java 14 point
05:30 - zero point one which we have installed
05:32 - right now we can also see the Java C
05:37 - version let me just clear the terminal
05:39 - so we can see it in a better way so you
05:43 - can just write Java C - a conversion and
05:47 - you can see Java C version is fourteen
05:49 - point zero point one also now let's see
05:52 - how we can set the Java home environment
05:55 - variables for this installation so for
05:58 - this you can give this command first of
06:00 - all so this command is pseudo update
06:03 - alternatives space - - config space Java
06:07 - which is going to give you the location
06:09 - to your Java installation right so you
06:15 - can see this is the location for your
06:17 - Java installation now in order to set
06:19 - the environment variable you can open
06:21 - the environment file so for that you can
06:27 - just give this command sudo G add it or
06:30 - you can use nano or vim also for opening
06:34 - this file then it is C and then and by
06:37 - meant and then plus enter which is going
06:41 - to open this kind of file so here you
06:44 - need to just go at the bottom of this
06:47 - file and then at the very bottom just
06:50 - write Java underscore home all in
06:53 - capital and then is equal to and in the
06:57 - double quotes you need to give the part
07:00 - you see after giving this update
07:03 - alternative command so this is the part
07:05 - so you don't need to copy the whole part
07:09 - you just need to copy the path before
07:13 - bin Java okay so you need to just need
07:16 - to copy this part user Lib JVM and
07:19 - whatever JDK directory you have inside
07:22 - the JVM folder so just copy that path
07:25 - and then paste it inside these double
07:28 - quotes yeah
07:29 - and once you are done you can just save
07:30 - this file and once the file is saved you
07:34 - can close this file and after that you
07:36 - need to refresh your environment file so
07:40 - we are going to just say source and then
07:44 - the path to your etc' environment file
07:47 - so etc' environment and then plus enter
07:51 - which is going to refresh all the paths
07:53 - there and now you can echo the Java home
07:57 - path so you can just write echo dollar
08:01 - Java underscore home here and then press
08:05 - ENTER which is going to give you the
08:07 - path which you have set for your Java
08:10 - home so this is how you can set the Java
08:13 - home environment variable for your Java
08:16 - JDK installation so this is how you can
08:19 - download and install Oracle Java JDK on
08:22 - your Ubuntu operating system I hope
08:25 - you've enjoyed this video and I will see
08:26 - you in the next video
