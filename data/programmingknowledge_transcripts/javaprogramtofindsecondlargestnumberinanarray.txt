00:00 - hello and welcome back to the new video
00:01 - of the Java tutorial Series so today in
00:04 - this video we'll be showing another
00:05 - problem of array so that it that is the
00:10 - finding the second maximum value inside
00:12 - an array so in our last video we have
00:15 - covered uh finding the minimum or
00:17 - maximum value inside an array so in this
00:19 - video we'll be covering another question
00:21 - which is asked many times uh during the
00:24 - interview process that is finding the
00:25 - second maximum value inside array array
00:28 - okay so let me just create one
00:31 - call a class called
00:35 - second
00:37 - X
00:39 - and I will add the quotient
00:42 - so what we have to do is find
00:48 - second
00:51 - Max
00:53 - value in Array
00:56 - okay so I will give you one example
00:59 - let's suppose
01:01 - comma 2 comma five
01:06 - [Music]
01:08 - so what is the expected output should be
01:11 - so the highest value is nine and after
01:14 - nine is value is seven so the output of
01:17 - this
01:18 - and array should be 7
01:21 - so this is the thing that we have to do
01:23 - so
01:24 - for this we will write one function
01:28 - and that function will be returning the
01:30 - second maximum number inside an array so
01:33 - the return type should be of type int so
01:36 - let me just create one public with
01:39 - static method of type return type end
01:42 - and I will name it as
01:45 - find
01:48 - second
01:50 - next
01:51 - you can also try finding the second
01:54 - minimum number of from this array so try
01:57 - solving it
01:59 - you just have to say simply
02:02 - change some conditions so that you can
02:04 - get the minimum number which is second
02:07 - minimum number
02:08 - from the array okay so here I need one
02:14 - variable to
02:17 - take the track of
02:20 - the largest element inside an arrow okay
02:23 - so integer
02:25 - Dot
02:28 - mean value
02:29 - okay so don't worry uh you will be
02:32 - asking what is that this mean value
02:34 - represent okay so here you can see if
02:36 - you hover over here uh Java has some
02:40 - predefined values inside the language
02:43 - and these are these I am nothing with
02:45 - the constant okay so which I have
02:47 - defined by the Java itself if you write
02:49 - integer dot mean value some value is
02:51 - assigned to it that is minus two one
02:55 - four seven four eight three six four
02:57 - four eight so this is the values
02:59 - assigned by the Java you can use it
03:01 - inside your code uh you can also write
03:03 - max value because other constants are
03:05 - also defined inside the Java so if you
03:09 - want some
03:11 - overview of this you can just go over
03:14 - here and write
03:17 - oh
03:18 - Java
03:20 - constants
03:23 - and if you go over here you can find
03:26 - this article which gives gives you
03:29 - pretty much idea about the Java
03:31 - constants okay and now moving to our
03:35 - question
03:36 - uh I need again one
03:39 - one more counter variable
03:42 - which takes not the counter variable a
03:46 - variable which player tracks the value
03:49 - of the second largest element
03:53 - inside the array
03:55 - so integer Dot mean value
03:59 - and now one I will require one for Loop
04:03 - which will iterate through entire array
04:07 - again the
04:11 - foreign
04:18 - condition that is array of I
04:23 - if it has Max
04:28 - then I will just simply write second Max
04:31 - assign the second max value as Max value
04:35 - okay and I will just simply update the
04:38 - maxed value as
04:40 - I
04:43 - don't worry we'll do don't drive and
04:46 - test
04:47 - to check what is going on inside this
04:53 - uh
04:54 - code Okay so
04:57 - don't worry be with me uh array of I is
05:00 - less than
05:01 - second Max
05:03 - and will require one more
05:06 - and so I hope you remember this for this
05:10 - ad and what is all and means both the
05:14 - condition should be evaluated as true
05:16 - until I enlist a both conditions are
05:19 - evaluated as true Loop uh the program
05:23 - control will not enter inside this LC
05:26 - group one once when all these both the
05:30 - conditions are evaluated as to the then
05:32 - and then only the program control the
05:35 - execution flow of that code should enter
05:37 - the inside this way else if Loop okay so
05:40 - edit
05:42 - hi
05:44 - is not equals to the
05:46 - Max
05:48 - so what if that's the case inside this
05:52 - we will be doing
05:54 - second Max is equals to
05:57 - ARR off
05:59 - right
06:01 - okay
06:02 - so this is the thing that we have to do
06:06 - inside this for Loop and after after
06:08 - execution of the follow-up we will just
06:10 - click it as the
06:11 - variable second Max okay and now inside
06:15 - our
06:17 - main main method we will just create one
06:21 - new array
06:24 - and we will pass those values as we have
06:28 - taken inside the example
06:31 - right comma 9 comma seven
06:34 - okay and now I will call
06:39 - method that is
06:42 - find second lesson pass our array Okay
06:45 - so so first let me run this
06:49 - and check whether we are getting the
06:51 - correct or
06:52 - yeah seven is getting minted on the
06:54 - console which is the second maximum
06:56 - number inside the direct and let me once
06:59 - check by changing some values
07:02 - as eight now this time it should be
07:05 - equal on console
07:08 - yeah it is getting minted on the console
07:11 - so wait let me just put one debug
07:15 - pointer over here
07:17 - and try to debug this code
07:22 - so that you guys can understand this
07:26 - easily okay
07:32 - okay so let's
07:34 - now
07:36 - when the programming execution at line
07:38 - number 23 uh this array so here you can
07:42 - see one two five nine seven eight is
07:44 - passed to this fine method
07:47 - okay
07:48 - now the exam of the program execution
07:51 - flow comes to this method called okay
07:55 - and now uh so here you can see uh Max
07:59 - has the value assigned as this value we
08:02 - have seen the predefined value which is
08:04 - assigned by the Java to this mean value
08:08 - second Max is also assign that value
08:12 - so for the first iteration is value is 0
08:14 - here you can see and if when that if
08:19 - condition is checked the max value is
08:21 - this and is value is uh zero here you
08:24 - can see and let's go ahead
08:26 - okay so if for the first time so array
08:30 - of I is all obviously greater than Max
08:34 - because this is the value
08:37 - that we have assigned minimum value okay
08:39 - so next
08:42 - a second Max has assigned the value this
08:45 - okay
08:46 - now again we'll check where I is equals
08:50 - to 1 here you can see I becomes 1.
08:53 - and now this time uh we'll check add 1
08:57 - errat 1 is 2 whether 2 is greater than a
09:02 - Max uh we will do that is one
09:05 - yeah obviously we will get inside this
09:08 - Loop
09:09 - we'll update the second max value as 1
09:12 - which is the pivotal and I will update
09:14 - the max values as 2. here you can see
09:17 - Max value is updated as to and second
09:19 - Max will be updated as 1.
09:22 - you come here come here we will check
09:24 - this
09:25 - uh and again we will check we will come
09:29 - here we will assign the second max
09:31 - volume X2 and I will update the second
09:33 - uh max value as 5 because the till now
09:37 - the maximum value is 5 inside the error
09:41 - here you can see we have updated the max
09:42 - value S5 and second Max will do X2 and
09:45 - again we will run this Loop or I is
09:47 - equal to 3 so what is the value uh
09:50 - element as I is equal to 3 0 1 2 3 0 1 2
09:56 - 3 9 whether the nine is
09:58 - and greater than 5 because it is will
10:01 - come inside this Loop we will assign the
10:04 - value of second Max as 5 and we'll
10:05 - update the max value as 9 so after a
10:08 - successful completion of the I value is
10:10 - 3 uh our max value is 9 and second max
10:13 - value is 5 okay so for now I is equal to
10:16 - 4 I is equal to 4 is 0 1 2 3 4 7 7 is uh
10:23 - greater than 9
10:24 - no
10:26 - we'll
10:28 - break that if condition will come inside
10:31 - the elsif condition and now in inside
10:33 - this kind of condition
10:35 - once we check this else condition will
10:38 - be evaluated as 2 and next value is 9
10:42 - and now we'll update the second max
10:45 - value as seven okay seven itself okay
10:50 - now again we will run this Loop we will
10:53 - do these steps and and at last you will
10:57 - get 8 as the second
11:00 - largest number inside that array which
11:03 - is true here you can see one two five
11:05 - nine seven eight eight is the second
11:07 - largest element inside the diary uh okay
11:11 - so which is returned to this
11:14 - a return statement over here and after
11:17 - that return statement we will come here
11:20 - at line number 23 where we have left to
11:22 - that program is called
11:24 - and here we can print that number on the
11:29 - console and exam exams
11:33 - causes successfully and it is completed
11:36 - on the concept okay
11:38 - so this is how a this program works I
11:42 - hope you got this question
11:44 - try solving and finding the second
11:47 - minimum number inside that array okay so
11:51 - for this for this video this is pretty
11:54 - much thank you for watching this video
