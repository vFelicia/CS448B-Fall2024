00:00 - hey what's going on guys welcome back to
00:02 - our YouTube channel and welcome to this
00:04 - video this is John from programming
00:06 - knowledge and in this video guys we're
00:09 - going to discuss how we can use switch
00:11 - multiple selection statement inside our
00:14 - C program so from the previous tutorials
00:17 - guys we have learned how to use if you
00:19 - also have learned how to use if-else and
00:21 - of course how to use the nested if-else
00:25 - statement inside our c program now
00:28 - occasionally there will be an algorithm
00:31 - that you know will contain a series of
00:34 - decisions in which a variable or
00:36 - expression is tested separately in the
00:40 - output or the statement or the actions
00:43 - that could be taken depends on the
00:46 - series of decisions this is what we
00:48 - called multiple selection and C provides
00:51 - the switch multiple selection statement
00:53 - to handle such decision making so now
00:56 - let's try to look at the basic syntax of
00:58 - switch statement so the switch statement
01:02 - guy starts with the keyword switch and
01:05 - then open closed parenthesis and open
01:10 - closed curly braces and inside this open
01:13 - closed parenthesis is the variable so
01:17 - variable of interest so the output guys
01:23 - are the statements that are executed
01:25 - depends on the value of this particular
01:28 - variable here so we have here switch
01:31 - statement or switch keyword and then
01:33 - open closed parenthesis and then the
01:36 - variable or expression and then of
01:38 - course open closed parentheses and
01:40 - inside this open close parenthesis guys
01:43 - are the case label paid so suffered some
01:47 - only want to check for the value of 1
01:51 - and then it should be followed by the
01:54 - break keyword which means that it
01:58 - signifies the end of this particular
02:01 - case 1 okay and then you could you know
02:04 - add several case label here so for
02:06 - example case 2 and then you could add
02:09 - the break statement you could also add
02:13 - another case labelled 3 and then the
02:16 - break statement and of course you need
02:20 - to add the default case so the default
02:24 - case guys will serve or will be executed
02:27 - if there is no case label that satisfies
02:32 - the VAR the value of our variable or
02:34 - expression so say for example we have
02:36 - here 1 2 & 3 and the input is 4 so it's
02:41 - going to you know execute the default
02:44 - value or the default statement default
02:47 - case
02:48 - now you could inside this particular
02:51 - case we could execute some statements
02:54 - for example you have chosen case 1 so we
03:02 - could end this with a semicolon so we
03:04 - could do the same for the other cases so
03:07 - like this so in this particular case you
03:14 - have chosen case 2 and you have chosen 3
03:20 - and the default is you haven't you have
03:31 - not chosen from the various one in 2 & 3
03:39 - so 1 2 you have not chosen a value in 1
03:53 - 2 3
03:57 - hey so we could try this guys and of
04:00 - course we need to add a variable here so
04:02 - in input and then we could you know scan
04:10 - F or ask the input from the user so % D
04:15 - and then the variable input ampersand
04:21 - and then input okay and then guys we
04:25 - could
04:27 - paint please choose a number number one
04:39 - two or three okay so let's try this okay
04:52 - so let's try to build and run our
04:55 - application so we have we have to update
05:00 - this so variable of interest is of
05:02 - course the input okay
05:04 - so let's replace this with the input and
05:07 - then build and run our application so as
05:12 - you can see it's going to run and we
05:18 - need to input a number here so please
05:24 - choose a number between one two and
05:26 - three so it's a very sample we choose or
05:28 - input one so you have chosen case one
05:34 - okay and then let's try another one so
05:39 - for example three so you have chosen
05:43 - case three so basically guys it executed
05:48 - the statement under this particular case
05:51 - label okay
05:52 - and it's a for example you have inputted
05:55 - or you have selected number four instead
06:01 - of the values one two and three so it's
06:04 - going to execute the statement under the
06:09 - default case okay
06:10 - so you have not chosen a value in one to
06:14 - N this is should be three and we could
06:18 - also use letters and characters inside
06:20 - our switch case statement and basically
06:24 - here in our example we're using the in
06:26 - type as the data type for our variable
06:29 - of interest input and then we're setting
06:32 - the case labels into int one and then
06:37 - into and then in three and then we're
06:39 - executing
06:40 - statement based on the value of our
06:42 - input paid but as I've said we could use
06:46 - characters or letters and so for example
06:50 - you want your user to input letter a you
06:53 - want your user to input letter B and
06:55 - then you could execute statement based
06:58 - on that particular letter so for for now
07:01 - let's try to implement this inside our
07:04 - program we want our user to input
07:06 - letters a B or C and then we could you
07:10 - know output different statements based
07:13 - on that particular character so now we
07:17 - could display instead of East choose a
07:19 - number we could you know say here
07:22 - entered a letter you could select a B or
07:28 - C and then based on this particular
07:32 - letter we could output or execute
07:37 - commands or execute statement okay and
07:40 - then we're going to use the method get
07:48 - get chart okay so this will return the
07:52 - in equivalent of the letter or the
07:57 - character that the user has input okay
07:59 - and then we could try this inside our
08:02 - switch statement so instead of using
08:05 - case one we can say here case a and then
08:11 - here we could use case B and of course
08:18 - here to choose or set the case C so
08:23 - every time the user types in the a so it
08:27 - should print you have chosen option B so
08:35 - we could copy and paste this so B and
08:39 - then of course you have chosen option C
08:46 - and in our default wrong option
08:53 - Hey so we could try this let's try to
08:56 - run or build and run our program so
09:02 - enter a letter A for example we type in
09:06 - a so you have chosen option A so let's
09:12 - try this once again so for example the
09:16 - letter that has been or the user
09:18 - inputted is B you have to send B let's
09:25 - try this once again suffered some poor
09:28 - the user types in D and then it will
09:31 - display wrong option okay
09:34 - and then of course guess you can make it
09:36 - this way also so for example you want to
09:39 - add also the lower case of letter A so
09:45 - case and then the lowercase version of a
09:49 - so you could do it like this so you have
09:52 - case a and then case with the lower case
09:57 - a and then you could also do the same
10:00 - with the B and then you could add the
10:04 - lower case B here and of course you
10:09 - could also do the same for your seat so
10:13 - lower case C lowercase B lowercase a so
10:19 - it's going to you know execute based on
10:24 - this it doesn't matter if it is
10:28 - uppercase or lowercase eight so let's
10:31 - try this once again so for example you
10:35 - want B so you have chosen option B okay
10:42 - now let's try this another time
10:45 - then C lowercase e so you have chosen
10:49 - option C Pig so I think it is clear to
10:55 - you how to use the switch case statement
10:57 - in C programming and if you have
11:00 - questions please let me know in the
11:02 - comment section below and I think that's
11:04 - all there is to it guys for this
11:05 - tutorial
11:07 - see you in the next video
