00:00 - hello guys welcome once again in this
00:02 - video I'm going to show you how to use
00:04 - include and require function in
00:07 - PHP so for example I have a a PHP file
00:12 - which is just containing um uh HTML code
00:17 - and which is just printing some header
00:20 - on the browser so I will just save it
00:23 - and I will S I will just browse for
00:28 - header.php and it's just print
00:30 - programming knowledge here now sometimes
00:34 - or most of the times you want uh some
00:37 - template to you know appear whenever you
00:42 - use uh your PHP code so for example you
00:46 - want to use this template which shows
00:49 - this header in different PHP file okay
00:52 - so how can we do
00:54 - that so for example I will make one more
00:57 - PHP file and I will call call it
01:01 - page page
01:04 - 1. P
01:07 - PHP and I
01:09 - will one more I will create one more PHP
01:13 - file and I will call it page
01:17 - to.php okay so I have these two PHP file
01:21 - and I will just
01:24 - quickly make this
01:28 - template
01:31 - and in here for example I
01:34 - want that I want to use this header file
01:40 - okay so I want to make this header file
01:43 - once and I want to use this in different
01:46 - PHP pages okay in different PHP files
01:49 - how can I do this I can use this include
01:53 - function and include this header file in
01:58 - my PHP 1 and php2 page so let's see how
02:02 - so what you need to do is you just need
02:05 - to use the
02:08 - keyword include and then in single codes
02:11 - just give the name of your uh
02:15 - header.php which you want to use here so
02:19 - my header PHP is like this header do pH
02:27 - PHP okay now what this code will do is
02:31 - it will call this
02:34 - header.php because all these uh three
02:38 - files are in same folder that's why I
02:41 - can call this uh for example if you want
02:44 - to go up one folder you can use it like
02:47 - this or for example you want to use uh
02:51 - some uh if you have this file in some
02:54 - other folder inside you can use it
02:57 - folder slash something like this
03:00 - but because this these all three files
03:02 - are in the same same folder that's why
03:07 - I'm not giving any path here okay
03:09 - otherwise you need to give relative path
03:13 - uh whenever you your header files are in
03:16 - different folder and your other
03:20 - functional file are in other folder okay
03:24 - now I can include this file in my P page
03:28 - one and page two
03:30 - like this just use include and the name
03:32 - of the and then I can
03:36 - call page one so page 1.
03:43 - PHP and it will give me some kind
03:49 - of let's see what's the
03:52 - error I don't see any error here so
03:55 - let's try it once again okay this is
03:59 - Page 1 Dot and I have used comma here so
04:03 - instead of page 1
04:05 - dot now it will work so whenever we call
04:09 - Page One this header is called right
04:12 - this header and whenever we call
04:16 - page2.php
04:17 - also this header will be called right so
04:22 - page one and page two has the same
04:23 - header right so this include function
04:27 - enables us to use the same same template
04:30 - if you have in different PHP files now
04:34 - for
04:35 - example I have uh I can declare some
04:39 - variable variable page one and I can
04:45 - show some message here for example I can
04:48 - show we are in page one okay and we can
04:57 - Echo this ech
05:01 - e page
05:04 - one and in the same way I will do the
05:08 - same in my page two so this will be my
05:11 - page two variable this will be my page
05:13 - two variable and this will be two okay I
05:17 - save it and let's see what happens so we
05:20 - are in page
05:22 - 1.
05:23 - PHP and I can see this uh Echo message
05:27 - here we are in page one and whenever I
05:30 - call Page 2. PHP we see we are in page
05:34 - two right so this include function just
05:39 - include the header and we will be able
05:41 - to do our other task which are
05:44 - inherently uh done by page one and page
05:48 - two also in these uh page one and page
05:52 - two PHP
05:54 - okay or for example you decide to use
05:58 - these uh variables in this header file
06:01 - also you can do the this just like this
06:06 - so for example I can just declare in my
06:09 - header.php I can just
06:13 - say
06:17 - PHP and in here I can declare this
06:22 - variable which
06:24 - is page one right page one I just cut it
06:29 - from here and in my header.php and my
06:32 - PHP tags I can just paste it here and
06:36 - same I will do from my page two right so
06:40 - in a way I have declared all my
06:42 - variables in this header.php and I want
06:46 - to use this these variables in page one
06:49 - and page two I'll save it and once again
06:52 - run it let's see what happens so I can
06:55 - still get the same result here page 1.
06:59 - PHP P will show me page one and Page
07:02 - two. PHP will show me page we are in
07:05 - page two right so in this way you can
07:09 - use the
07:10 - include function to call files or files
07:16 - uh and whatever variables or whatever
07:20 - values are there in the files you can
07:23 - just import it in your PHP file just by
07:27 - using this include right in the same way
07:31 - you can use require function also so we
07:34 - can use instead of this include require
07:39 - function require and this will also work
07:44 - the same
07:45 - way that uh of include so I will just
07:50 - save it and when I refresh this it works
07:54 - same as include function right for page
07:57 - one also it's it works same same as
07:59 - include function but for
08:03 - example I am uh I'm including some text
08:07 - before this page one VAR page two
08:09 - variable and page one variable so for
08:12 - example I can just
08:14 - say
08:16 - page
08:18 - info and I just concatenate this in page
08:22 - 2. PHP and page1.php
08:25 - okay and I save it and whenever I use
08:30 - this require here okay and whenever uh
08:35 - this header name is for example by
08:37 - mistake I have missed misspell this
08:41 - header name so this is not a uh I mean
08:45 - original header or header which exist
08:48 - this is non-existent header Right In
08:51 - Here Also in our page two we just
08:54 - provide the path of the header which
08:55 - doesn't exist and we save it and when we
08:59 - refresh
09:00 - this we see
09:03 - here the warning and the error and we
09:06 - don't see this page info message even so
09:12 - what this required does is whenever it
09:15 - sees that uh it cannot find this uh
09:19 - header file or this PHP file which you
09:23 - have provide the path of then it kills
09:26 - your page so whatever you write or you
09:30 - whatever you want to execute after this
09:32 - include or after this require function
09:35 - and if this header is not an existing it
09:38 - will kill your page after that okay and
09:41 - this same in the case of this but
09:43 - whenever we use
09:46 - include include here in page one and
09:49 - page two and save it see what happens I
09:53 - refresh it and even this is showing the
09:58 - error but it will execute your U
10:02 - messages or whatever functionality you
10:05 - are doing after uh after your include
10:10 - function also so this is printing page
10:13 - info right you can see here page info
10:17 - right so this include function even if
10:22 - you provide the wrong header name or a
10:25 - header which doesn't exist it will keep
10:28 - on execu in the other codes which you uh
10:31 - write below your include function so it
10:35 - will it will not kill your page on the
10:37 - other hand when you use require it will
10:40 - kill your page right so for example I
10:43 - will
10:47 - use require for page two and include for
10:50 - page one okay so let's see page one
10:54 - first which we have include page one
10:57 - refresh it it show shows page info which
11:00 - is after my include right and let's see
11:03 - page 2. PHP page 2. PHP and
11:08 - now it killed my page and I cannot see
11:13 - the code I want to execute after this
11:15 - required function requir
11:17 - function so include and require uh works
11:22 - in the same way but but only difference
11:25 - is this which I have shown you so I hope
11:28 - you have uh learned something new this
11:30 - time please RIT comment and subscribe
11:32 - and bye for now
