00:00 - one welcome to programming knowledge
00:01 - surveys though I welcome you all to
00:03 - programming knowledge this is a 31st
00:05 - django series so guys what you need to
00:09 - do we are continuing with the to do app
00:10 - so this is very easy so I will come you
00:12 - all to programming knowledge so
00:14 - basically you need to install you can
00:16 - refer to my any of our projects in the
00:19 - repository so you need to install like
00:22 - you need to install the requirements for
00:25 - txt file then simply type Python miles
00:27 - or py run server then you can get
00:29 - started with the project so I'll update
00:31 - with the requirement or txt file and so
00:34 - you can run the the so basically you
00:36 - need to install Django in your machine
00:37 - and you can run with it and you can
00:40 - check my previous videos how you can
00:41 - install Jiang on your machine and how
00:43 - you can run the project on the machine
00:45 - ascend
00:45 - ok so today we are going to continue
00:47 - with the delete operation so basically
00:49 - we will continue did search and sort
00:51 - operation on the to do our and even even
00:54 - in the end we will do the update
00:55 - operation ok so basically we will also
00:59 - perform the update operation as well so
01:01 - in this tutorial we are going to be
01:03 - dependent continue with delete operation
01:05 - and look for other useful query set
01:06 - features but that is going to vary eat
01:09 - so that's going to very interesting how
01:11 - we perform the 3d operation so basically
01:14 - first we will move to URL from to your
01:16 - file
01:17 - I need a delete route with ID as a
01:20 - parameter okay when we are done with
01:23 - this so we'll call views dot delete and
01:27 - name is equal to delete okay I hope this
01:33 - is fine ok so what we need what we need
01:38 - to do we use dot py file ok it is
01:45 - throwing an error because the since I am
01:47 - NOT defined delete of function in my
01:49 - views or py file so what do we move to
01:52 - view short purified and find the delete
01:53 - function define
01:55 - delete ok what parameter is going to
02:00 - take and it is going to take a request
02:02 - parameter request and basically this
02:08 - part is going to be same ok so this is
02:12 - going to vary the same part
02:14 - I'll quickly copy this so only one we
02:17 - think we are going to do since we were
02:19 - going to get a ID
02:21 - okay so object is route to do dot
02:27 - objects dot get so with this iid
02:33 - basically this open my table so
02:37 - basically match this ID okay with iid
02:41 - sorry for this with the ID you get okay
02:44 - basically I'm trying to tell that match
02:46 - the ID here in the table with the ID you
02:51 - get why the URL okay wiser out so
02:55 - basically you get they get get this
02:57 - object then simply perform object dot
03:00 - delete ok so I hope this is fine so this
03:06 - should work okay let me do one thing
03:09 - okay okay let me check yes okay so let's
03:17 - do one thing we'll move to our server
03:22 - okay and what we need to do okay you can
03:27 - copy this okay we can copy this and so
03:36 - this is a local server so basically what
03:39 - we are going to do we will move to the
03:41 - delete okay and we are let me check if
03:46 - the end if there already let me delete
03:48 - this one with the ID for so I'll move to
03:52 - my page and do delete fourth
03:56 - so maybe the fourth one should have been
03:59 - deleted so let me check so here is my
04:03 - database database so i refresh the table
04:07 - data so here you can see the both of the
04:10 - object with the ID 4 has been deleted so
04:13 - let me check let me check one thing
04:15 - let's take this one new title delete
04:19 - operation 78 okay so what ID does it
04:23 - have so let me okay
04:27 - the new title delete operation so 10 and
04:29 - 11 so I'll delete both of them so how
04:32 - you can how can I delete delete one with
04:34 - the ID 10 get done and delete a one with
04:39 - the ID 11 as well so that was pretty
04:41 - quick so let me move to my table and
04:44 - refresh this page so here you can see
04:46 - the 10 and 11 has been deleted but you
04:48 - want this operation to be performed by a
04:49 - button not by a direct URL so what you
04:53 - can do so you can move to the index dot
04:56 - HTML okay
04:59 - and for what we can you can do since
05:06 - sorry we'll move to the list or HTML
05:10 - since we all have all the buttons there
05:13 - so let me do this button button danger
05:20 - okay and we have to define this as
05:26 - delete okay and then object so basically
05:36 - we are going to define this at delete
05:39 - slash each to do dot ID okay
05:44 - so and I'll do this as delete okay so
05:51 - this should go fine let me refresh this
05:54 - page focus I should not have refresh
06:02 - this page let me open this list all to
06:06 - lose okay okay okay okay there's some
06:12 - issue let me check
06:17 - you are a zero to-do app okay so let me
06:25 - add a to-do new to do I quickly even do
06:28 - this also or maybe I have not defined
06:32 - thing I'll move to my index.html page
06:33 - and inside here okay I am NOT defined
06:40 - let me do one thing so I'll define a
06:46 - path list okay now use dot list okay and
06:56 - name is equal to list so this would list
07:02 - all my pages okay
07:04 - now I define my things I'm abused or Pui
07:08 - file I will quickly do this define list
07:14 - and it will take requests as a parameter
07:17 - and do this thing okay and inside index
07:26 - dot HTML I'll do % URL list okay so this
07:38 - would list all two rules okay
07:40 - let me click this okay so here you can
07:49 - see I have got all the tools so let me
07:52 - do this each to do dot ID okay I made a
07:59 - mistake little mistake this should have
08:01 - been actually this should have been a
08:04 - value so I booked this is fine now this
08:07 - should have been a value I forgot to put
08:11 - curly braces
08:12 - since this should have been an value
08:15 - okay so this no this book this would
08:17 - work fine so let me move to my okay I'll
