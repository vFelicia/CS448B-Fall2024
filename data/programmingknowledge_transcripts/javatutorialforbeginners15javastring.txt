00:01 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Java programming for
00:04 - beginners and in this video we will see
00:06 - what are strings and how we can use
00:09 - strings in Java so first of all what is
00:13 - a string a string is you can say is a
00:18 - sequence of characters or in other words
00:21 - you can say a string is a character
00:25 - array and how you can declare strings in
00:29 - Java you just need to use this keyword
00:32 - called string and then you can name your
00:35 - string whatever you
00:37 - want so I name it as my string is equal
00:41 - to and then in double Cotes whatever
00:45 - string you want to assign so for
00:51 - example hello
00:54 - world you can do it something like this
00:58 - and this string you can can uh
01:01 - just print it using
01:04 - system.out.print line
01:08 - system.out
01:10 - do print
01:13 - line and you can call your string here
01:16 - and it will print your string right this
01:20 - is very simple stuff now there are some
01:23 - properties and function related to
01:25 - Strings uh which we can use for example
01:29 - I want to get the length of the string I
01:33 - can just use this
01:37 - string uh or I can declare a variable
01:42 - called my string
01:45 - length
01:47 - my
01:49 - string length is equal to the variable
01:55 - name of my string dot length okay and
02:00 - this function length will return the
02:03 - size or length of the string so the
02:07 - length of the string as we can calculate
02:11 - uh 1 2 3 4 5 and five uh letters for
02:17 - world and one for space so 11 should be
02:19 - the length of this string and let's run
02:22 - the program and it returns 11 right so
02:26 - this length function will give you the
02:29 - length of the string now for example uh
02:34 - I can
02:35 - uh modify this string I will declare
02:39 - some one new variable called
02:44 - my
02:46 - string
02:48 - in lower case so you can uh convert your
02:53 - string to lower case all the letters in
02:56 - lower case like H is capit Capital here
03:00 - and uh W is capital in world you can
03:07 - just convert them into lower case
03:10 - something like this so use your string
03:13 - variable name
03:15 - two and then lower case just use this
03:19 - function and then it will convert your
03:23 - string to the lower case run the
03:27 - program and it converts her hello
03:30 - world from Hello it converts H to lower
03:34 - and from World it will convert world to
03:37 - lower case in the same way it will
03:39 - convert your string to the upper
03:42 - case so I will change it to string in
03:51 - case like this and I can convert to the
03:56 - uppercase so I can just use Dot
04:00 - to uppercase it will convert your
04:04 - string in capital letters like this it
04:08 - will print your string
04:11 - okay and there are some other properties
04:14 - of string for example you want to join
04:17 - two string you can do it something like
04:20 - this hello in double Cotes Plus World in
04:25 - double codes and this means you're can
04:28 - concatenating to strings one string is
04:32 - hello and other string is world and
04:34 - whenever you use this plus sign between
04:37 - them it will concatenate or join these
04:40 - two strings okay so it will not affect
04:44 - our result it just remove the space
04:48 - because this world and hello doesn't
04:51 - contain any space if I give any space
04:54 - here and it will give you the space here
04:58 - okay so the other function you can use
05:03 - with this uh array
05:05 - is not array but the string is the
05:10 - replace function for example you want to
05:13 - replace uh some character from this uh
05:17 - string I will change it to the original
05:20 - value hello world and I want to uh add
05:25 - or I want to change this e to some uh
05:29 - other letter for example a okay so I can
05:32 - use uh something like this I can use uh
05:36 - this my string then
05:39 - dot
05:41 - replace and I can replace my old
05:45 - character so I will
05:47 - replace character e by for example
05:51 - character
05:54 - a okay and it will search for all the e
05:58 - characters in in this uh string it will
06:01 - replace it by a so when we run the
06:04 - program it will give the result h a l o
06:09 - hello world instead of h e l right for
06:14 - example our string would
06:17 - contain more than one e here and then we
06:22 - run the program it will con convert or
06:26 - replace our e by a okay
06:30 - so you can replace the characters in The
06:33 - String using this replace function you
06:36 - can do more uh things with this replace
06:40 - function you just need to hover over
06:42 - this
06:43 - function and just see the examples which
06:47 - is suggested by Eclipse here so examples
06:50 - are replace the characters you can
06:53 - replace or you can replace some more uh
06:59 - strings or something like this okay
07:03 - so this is how you can use strings in
07:09 - Java there are other functions in uh
07:12 - strings which you can use you just need
07:15 - to uh add a DOT to your variable and see
07:20 - what uh you know function suits your uh
07:24 - you know your
07:26 - requirements you you have uh this concat
07:30 - function which
07:31 - concatenates you have this index of some
07:35 - character if you find want to find some
07:37 - index of the character for example I
07:39 - want to find the index of uh for example
07:43 - o then I can just write a character o
07:50 - and then I can run this
07:52 - program it gives
07:55 - minus1 for some reason I have to see
07:58 - this uh you know
07:59 - this index off and what it does and you
08:02 - just need to hover over the function and
08:06 - then you just need to uh you know see
08:11 - what's what this function is doing so it
08:15 - returns minus one the index of first
08:17 - occurrence of the character in the
08:19 - character sequence uh represented by the
08:22 - object or minus one if the character
08:25 - does not occur okay so this was Z if
08:30 - this was O I would have got the right
08:34 - answer which is four 0 1 2 3 4 okay so
08:42 - just uh find your function which suits
08:45 - your requirement and you will be good to
08:47 - go in this way you can use strings in
08:49 - Java I hope you have enjoyed this video
