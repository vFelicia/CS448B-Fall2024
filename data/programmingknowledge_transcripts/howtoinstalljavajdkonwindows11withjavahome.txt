00:00 - hey guys in this video i'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can download and install
00:04 - java jdk on your windows 11 operating
00:07 - system
00:08 - using java jdk you can run java programs
00:11 - on your windows 11 operating system so
00:14 - let's see how we can install
00:16 - java on our windows 11 operating system
00:19 - so first of all we are going to check
00:20 - whether java is already installed on our
00:22 - windows operating system or not for this
00:25 - you can just click on the search icon
00:27 - and then search for cmd and then
00:31 - just open the command prompt and once
00:33 - command prompt opens you can type this
00:36 - command here java space
00:39 - hyphen
00:40 - version okay and then press enter and if
00:44 - this command shows java is not
00:46 - recognized as an internal or external
00:50 - command that means java is most probably
00:53 - not installed on your windows 11
00:54 - operating system so let's see how we can
00:57 - install it
00:58 - so for that first of all open your
01:00 - favorite browser and search for java jdk
01:02 - download and the first link which will
01:04 - appear here will be from oracle.com
01:07 - forward slash java forward slash
01:08 - technologies forward slash download so
01:11 - just click on this link
01:13 - i'm going to provide this link in the
01:14 - description of this video also so you
01:17 - can directly come to this website
01:20 - and here
01:22 - you just need to scroll down
01:24 - at the time of making this video java 17
01:27 - is the latest version which is available
01:30 - for download
01:31 - so when you scroll down you will see the
01:34 - option to
01:36 - download the linux binaries or the mac
01:38 - os binaries or
01:40 - the windows binaries right so we are
01:43 - going to select windows from here
01:45 - and then we are going to select
01:47 - the exc option here so just select the
01:51 - link which is in front of the installer
01:54 - option here so click on this uh link
01:57 - here so just wait for the download to
01:59 - complete and once this exe file is
02:01 - downloaded i'm going to click on this
02:03 - exe file and let me minimize my browser
02:06 - so first of all you will see this kind
02:07 - of window which says do you want to
02:09 - allow this app to make changes on your
02:10 - device i trust this app so i will click
02:13 - on yes and now i can see the
02:15 - java jdk installer has been started on
02:18 - my windows 11 operating system so here
02:21 - you just need to click on the next
02:23 - button
02:24 - and this will be the default location
02:26 - where java will be installed on your
02:28 - windows 11 operating system
02:30 - just remember this location
02:33 - so
02:34 - by default it's installed in c
02:37 - then program files then it's going to
02:39 - create a java directory in program files
02:41 - folder and then there will be a jdk 17
02:45 - folder or the name of the folder will be
02:48 - the version of jdk you are installing
02:50 - right
02:51 - so if you want to change this path just
02:54 - click on change and then change the
02:56 - destination
02:57 - otherwise if you don't have the good
02:59 - reason to change this location just
03:01 - leave it as default and then click on
03:02 - next which is going to start
03:06 - the installation of java on your windows
03:09 - 11 operating system so at this point you
03:11 - just need to wait for this process to
03:14 - complete and in few seconds you can see
03:17 - the java jdk has been installed on my
03:20 - windows 11 operating system so i'm going
03:22 - to close this window that means java is
03:24 - installed on my windows 11 operating
03:26 - system but still i have to do few things
03:30 - first of all i'm going to just go to the
03:32 - location where java is installed so just
03:35 - open your folder explorer and then go to
03:38 - the c directory and then i'm going to go
03:40 - to the program files where java folder
03:44 - is created and then in my case jdk
03:46 - 17.0.1
03:48 - uh is created in your case this folder
03:51 - name version can be different
03:53 - so just go
03:54 - to this folder right
03:57 - now in order to set the environment
03:59 - variable for java what you need to do
04:02 - you can just click on the search icon
04:04 - once again and then
04:05 - just type edit
04:08 - and here which is going to show you this
04:10 - result which says edit environment
04:12 - variable for your account and it's going
04:14 - to open this kind of window
04:17 - you can also open this edit environment
04:19 - variable using control panel so you can
04:22 - search for
04:23 - control panel
04:25 - and then just view by category here and
04:28 - then click on system and security then
04:31 - click on system
04:32 - and then
04:34 - once the system window opens you can
04:36 - click on advanced system settings
04:39 - and then click on environment variables
04:41 - which is also going to show you the same
04:43 - window right
04:45 - so
04:46 - you can choose any method to open this
04:48 - environment variable window
04:51 - and once this is open
04:53 - you need to click on the path
04:55 - environment variable under system
04:57 - variables
04:58 - and then click on
04:59 - edit
05:00 - and here you need to add the path to
05:04 - your jdk folder binaries
05:07 - so go to the folder where we have
05:09 - installed java under jdk folder and then
05:13 - click on
05:14 - bin folder so we need to go inside the
05:17 - bin folder inside this jdk folder and
05:19 - then copy the path right so until bin
05:23 - and then copy this path from here
05:25 - go to the
05:27 - environment variable window once again
05:29 - and then you can double click here or
05:32 - you can click on new which is also going
05:34 - to show you this option
05:36 - and then just paste this path until bin
05:40 - and then press enter
05:42 - which is going to add this path to your
05:44 - environment variable so click on ok so
05:46 - your java environment variable is set
05:48 - now some application also needs the java
05:51 - home environment variable on your
05:53 - windows operating system
05:55 - to
05:56 - run them so let me show you how you can
05:58 - set the java home environment variable
06:00 - also
06:01 - so you can go at the top under user
06:04 - variable
06:05 - section
06:06 - and then click on new here
06:08 - and then
06:09 - the variable name you need to provide
06:11 - here is java
06:13 - underscore home everything is capital
06:17 - just write whatever i have written here
06:20 - everything in capital and the variable
06:22 - value will be the folder which we have
06:24 - opened which is
06:26 - jdk folder so don't go inside the bin
06:30 - folder
06:31 - in this case
06:32 - just copy the path until jdk folder you
06:35 - don't need to go inside the bin folder
06:37 - in this case okay and then just paste
06:40 - this path under variable values okay so
06:45 - you can see there is no bin folder added
06:48 - here only the path until the jdk folder
06:51 - click on ok
06:52 - and then click on ok and then click on
06:55 - ok which is going to set
06:56 - the environment variable for java on
06:59 - your windows 11 operating system now
07:02 - once you have installed java and set the
07:05 - environment variables
07:06 - you can use java on command line so you
07:09 - can just open the command prompt by
07:12 - typing cmd once again
07:15 - and then i can type java space hyphen
07:20 - version here and it's going to show me
07:23 - the version of java so you can see java
07:25 - version 17.0.1
07:28 - is installed on my windows 11 operating
07:30 - system now if you want to compile a java
07:34 - file you can use the java c command so
07:37 - you can just write java c space
07:40 - hyphen
07:41 - version here and then press enter and
07:44 - you can see the java c version is also
07:46 - same
07:47 - so as i said you can use java c
07:51 - to compile
07:52 - a java file on your windows 11 operating
07:55 - system now let us see how we can compile
07:58 - a java file
08:00 - which is present on our windows 11
08:02 - operating system so for that
08:04 - generally we use some ides like eclipse
08:08 - or intellij idea or netbeans or visual
08:11 - studio code but let me also show you how
08:13 - you can compile a raw java file using
08:17 - this command prompt
08:18 - so for that what you need to do just go
08:21 - to the location where you want to have
08:24 - your java file
08:25 - so let me create a new folder here and
08:29 - then i'm going to just
08:31 - create a java
08:33 - apps folder for example here now here we
08:36 - will create a new java file so i'm going
08:39 - to just right click here and then click
08:41 - on new for now i'm going to click on
08:43 - text document and then i'm going to name
08:46 - it as
08:47 - hello which is going to create a new
08:49 - text document the next step is to change
08:52 - the file type so here the file type is
08:54 - text document but we want to create a
08:57 - java file right so for this you can
08:59 - click on view option and then click on
09:01 - show and then click on the file
09:03 - extension so file name extension which
09:06 - is going to show you the file extension
09:08 - which is hello.txt
09:10 - you need to change this extension by
09:12 - just right clicking here and then you
09:14 - can rename this file as hello
09:18 - dot
09:19 - java and then press enter which is going
09:21 - to show you this warning click on yes
09:24 - which is going to change this
09:26 - file type to java file so we have this
09:29 - hello.java file
09:31 - you can open this file using notepad or
09:34 - any other tool so let me open this file
09:37 - by clicking on open with
09:39 - and then i'm going to choose notepad for
09:42 - this so once this notepad is open i'm
09:44 - going to just type a very simple
09:46 - java program here
09:48 - the one thing to note here is
09:51 - the name of the file so my name file
09:54 - name is hello.java
09:56 - you need to write the class name and the
09:59 - file name same so if you give the file
10:02 - name hello then your class name should
10:04 - be same as hello right
10:07 - so this
10:09 - thing you need to keep in mind if you
10:11 - name it as
10:13 - something else for example test.java
10:15 - then your class name should be test
10:18 - here okay
10:20 - so once you have pasted your code just
10:23 - save it and then close it
10:25 - and then you can open the command prompt
10:28 - once again and then you can copy the
10:30 - path where your hello.java file is
10:33 - present and then on terminal just write
10:36 - cd and then paste the path and then
10:37 - press enter and in order to compile this
10:40 - java file just type java c
10:42 - space
10:43 - and then the name of the file which is
10:45 - hello.java and then press enter which is
10:48 - going to compile your hello.java file
10:52 - so once the compilation is done you will
10:55 - see
10:55 - that this hello.class
10:58 - file is created this is
11:01 - the executable file which you can run in
11:04 - order to
11:06 - get the output of your hello.java file
11:09 - right
11:10 - so to run this you can just type java
11:13 - not java c to run a java executable you
11:17 - use a java command in order to compile a
11:20 - java file you use a java c command so
11:23 - java c is for compilation java is for
11:26 - running the java file right
11:28 - so type java and then
11:30 - just type hello okay you don't need to
11:33 - provide hello dot class here you just
11:36 - need to type java space hello don't
11:39 - write hello dot class right and then
11:41 - press enter which is going to show you
11:44 - the output of the file
11:47 - which you have
11:48 - for your java program so in my case it
11:51 - was just
11:52 - printing hello world so you can see the
11:54 - output here so this is how you can
11:57 - use java c and java for running a java
12:00 - file
12:02 - so this is how you can download and
12:04 - install and use java
12:06 - to run
12:08 - some java program on your windows 11
12:10 - operating system
12:11 - i hope you enjoyed this video and i will
12:13 - see you in the next video
