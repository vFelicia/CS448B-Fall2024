00:01 - hello guys welcome once again last time
00:05 - I have shown you how to install your
00:08 - MySQL whole package onto your
00:12 - machine and from this video I will show
00:16 - you how you can make new database or new
00:19 - schemas and new
00:22 - tables and your MySQL Mage so once
00:28 - again
00:31 - go here database and click query
00:35 - database and as last time we have
00:38 - entered our
00:41 - password root whatever is your password
00:45 - enter here and click
00:48 - okay and you can see
00:52 - uh SQL environment
00:55 - here SQL has already provided two
00:59 - schemas and one test schemas by
01:04 - default and we are going to make a new
01:07 - schema
01:09 - here in order to make a new schema a new
01:13 - schema is a new
01:15 - database so for example you want to make
01:19 - a
01:20 - database for your software so for that
01:25 - you need to prepare a schema and in that
01:29 - you need need to prepare some
01:32 - tables so I will create a new schema see
01:38 - this button for new schema click
01:40 - it and
01:43 - this tab will open in this you can give
01:47 - your the
01:48 - name of your database I will name it
01:55 - as database
01:58 - only and I will C click
02:01 - apply
02:03 - and this is very
02:06 - important
02:07 - this line create schema database is
02:11 - called a
02:14 - query so whenever
02:17 - you want to
02:20 - make a schema with the help of your
02:24 - software for example Java you need to
02:28 - write these
02:31 - query and that software environment you
02:34 - don't have a luxury of using this
02:38 - workbench in here you can just go to
02:42 - these buttons and you can automatically
02:46 - create
02:47 - your database but whenever you are
02:53 - using databases with your software you
02:57 - need to know these queries
03:00 - so for creating a new database you need
03:03 - to write create
03:06 - schema database and we will check it in
03:10 - future also this query so I'm just
03:13 - copying it and I will click apply and
03:17 - click
03:18 - finish and you can see my database is
03:21 - created automatically
03:24 - here for example I want to make a new
03:29 - database with the help of query this you
03:33 - can do it from here also this database
03:38 - database I have created with the help of
03:41 - this GUI or this button but with the
03:45 - help of query if I want to make a
03:47 - database just go here create a new query
03:51 - tab this one and it will open a query
03:56 - tab for you and what I will do here I
04:00 - will paste it
04:01 - paste the query which I have copied from
04:05 - there and for example I want to
04:08 - make a new schema or database whose name
04:12 - is database
04:17 - 1 one 2 3 for
04:20 - example
04:23 - and I want to execute this query and
04:26 - with the help of this query I want to
04:28 - create a database you can do that also
04:32 - so write this create schema database
04:36 - name and click this button execute
04:40 - query and
04:42 - if in your output this green button
04:46 - comes it means your query is
04:49 - successfully
04:50 - executed so let's check our database is
04:54 - created or not for that you need to
04:57 - refresh your schemas with with this
05:00 - button and you can see my database is
05:06 - created now in a database of
05:11 - course present there are some tables so
05:15 - this is a whole database which contains
05:20 - tables so now we will create tables
05:25 - right now this database contain no
05:28 - tables so go here tables right click
05:33 - create
05:34 - table and it will open a new tab
05:37 - for creating a new table so what I will
05:41 - do is first I will name my
05:47 - table
05:49 - employee info for example I want to make
05:54 - uh table
05:57 - for employees in which I I could be able
06:00 - to
06:01 - see the information of the employee such
06:04 - as his name surname and age and his
06:08 - employee ID how can I do
06:10 - this uh I will make a
06:13 - table and if you want to give a comment
06:16 - you can give it here and here we'll
06:19 - provide the column names here so just
06:22 - press this button to make it bigger this
06:26 - region and when you click here
06:30 - it will automatically Pro give you a
06:33 - First Column name you can change this
06:36 - name
06:37 - also and this is very
06:40 - important the First Column
06:43 - generally
06:45 - is uh primary
06:50 - key and now the question arises what is
06:53 - a primary key a primary key is a unique
06:57 - identifier for
07:00 - every row so for example I have two
07:03 - employees both have same employee ID so
07:07 - my my SQL cannot recognize it if it has
07:15 - same ID so there is something which must
07:20 - be present in the table which is unique
07:23 - for that employee only so for that we
07:28 - need a primary key primary
07:31 - key is a key which is unique for every
07:36 - Row in the
07:38 - table so this is my primary key and
07:43 - second I will write
07:46 - name and variable type is Vare it's okay
07:51 - third I will name is
07:56 - as
07:57 - the name
08:01 - and here I will take his AG in the third
08:07 - column and here I
08:09 - want
08:11 - AG as integer variable so I will change
08:15 - it from
08:16 - here the where care
08:19 - means
08:21 - it's character up to 45 character this
08:26 - 45 indicates the number of characters
08:29 - okay so my columns are ready I will
08:32 - click
08:34 - apply and once again I will copy this
08:38 - because this is very important to know
08:42 - create a table in your schema so I will
08:45 - copy
08:47 - it and I will press apply and press
08:51 - finish
08:54 - and you will
08:57 - see my table is created here and when I
09:03 - click right click it and click edit
09:06 - table you can see four columns here one
09:10 - for ID which is a primary key second
09:13 - name third column is surname and fourth
09:16 - col is
09:18 - age the same thing you can do with the
09:22 - help of query so I will go to my query
09:27 - Tab and
09:29 - now this time I want to make the same
09:33 - table for my second database which is
09:37 - database 1 2 3 with the help of query so
09:41 - whatever I have copied I will paste it
09:44 - here the query for creating a table
09:48 - is
09:51 - create your database schema name so my
09:55 - schema name is database 1 2 3
10:01 - dot whatever you want to give your
10:04 - employee sorry table
10:07 - name in Brackets your
10:11 - columns and here you can give the
10:15 - variables and you can decide if you want
10:19 - them to be null or not
10:22 - null if it's not null it should have
10:26 - some value whenever
10:29 - you want to insert some value over see
10:33 - some inside your table and if it's null
10:37 - it could be null so if you want to add a
10:41 - new
10:42 - employee uh employee ID is must it may
10:47 - happen that
10:48 - you may not provide his name it will run
10:52 - run the query fine but the essential
10:55 - thing
10:57 - is ID employee info it must not be null
11:03 - so now and my primary key is this ID
11:09 - employee info
11:10 - column I will click this to execute the
11:15 - query and you can see the green
11:18 - indication my query is correct and now I
11:22 - will check in the table
11:25 - yes
11:27 - same table is created in my
11:30 - second database so in this way you can
11:33 - create a table and create a new schema I
11:37 - hope you have learned something new this
11:39 - time please wait comment and subscribe
11:42 - and bye for now
