00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:01 - you how you can download and install
00:03 - Eclipse IDE on your Ubuntu 16.4
00:06 - operating system so let's get started
00:09 - so first of all we are going to download
00:10 - the Eclipse IDE
00:12 - but before downloading the Eclipse IDE
00:14 - you need to make sure that you have Java
00:18 - installed on your system
00:19 - because Eclipse is a Java based IDE and
00:23 - you need to have you know Java installed
00:25 - on your system before installing Eclipse
00:28 - IDE now in order to install Java you can
00:33 - just click on this icon here at the top
00:36 - and then first of all search for the
00:39 - terminal or you can just press ctrl alt
00:43 - T also which will open the terminal and
00:45 - just to check you can just write Java -
00:49 - version here and if it gives any
00:52 - response then you know that Java is
00:55 - installed otherwise it's most probably
00:57 - not installed so if it's not installed
01:00 - then you can just install java using
01:05 - this command this is the command to
01:08 - install java jdk which is sudo apt - get
01:11 - install open JDK - 8 - JDK there is an
01:17 - Oracle version of Java also which you
01:19 - can install but for simplicity you can
01:23 - use this command if you prefer the
01:25 - Oracle one then you can install Oracle
01:27 - one also right so just give this command
01:30 - and then press install and then give
01:32 - your password for your Ubuntu operating
01:35 - system and just keep Y here and then the
01:40 - installation will start so till the
01:43 - installation is finished let's download
01:45 - the Eclipse IDE so open your favorite

03:03 - website or other websites also but for
03:07 - now we will just click this downloads
03:09 - button and once we click this download
03:13 - button hopefully the download will start
03:15 - so you can see it's Eclipse - inst -

03:30 - see the download is started and it's not
03:33 - a very big file you can see it's about
03:35 - 45 or 46 megabyte files so it will be
03:39 - downloaded really fast and once it's
03:42 - downloaded we will first of all extract
03:44 - it and then we are going to install it
03:48 - right so once it's downloaded you can
03:52 - just browse to the folder where it's
03:54 - downloaded in my kids its Downloads
03:57 - folder you can see this one and in here
04:01 - you can just right click on it and then
04:03 - you can extract this file you can
04:06 - extract it here itself in the Downloads
04:09 - folder also or you can extract it to the
04:13 - other folders also whatever you want for
04:16 - now I will just extract it to the
04:18 - Downloads folder itself and once the
04:22 - eclipse is extracted then you can go in
04:27 - this Eclipse installer folder and then
04:31 - right-click and run it right so before
04:34 - this we can just check whether the Java
04:37 - installation is finished or not so we
04:40 - can see that the Java installation is
04:42 - finished and once again when you give
04:44 - this command Java version now you will
04:48 - be able to see the Java version right
04:51 - so it has installed Java 1.8 in my case
04:55 - once you see this version now you are
04:57 - ready to install eclipse from this
05:00 - Installer so just click on this
05:02 - installer right-click and run this
05:04 - installer file which is going to start
05:07 - the Eclipse installer and once the
05:10 - installer starts then we will just you
05:13 - know install it and once the installer
05:16 - starts it will ask you which version of
05:19 - Eclipse you want so for example Eclipse
05:22 - IDE for Java developers or Eclipse IDE
05:25 - for Java EE developers or if you want to
05:28 - just develop C or C++ then you can
05:32 - install this version and there are many
05:35 - other versions to install for now I will
05:37 - just select the first option which is
05:39 - Eclipse IDE for Java developers right
05:42 - because I just want to develop Java and
05:45 - other Java related stuff with this so I
05:48 - will just choose the first option so I'm
05:51 - going to just select it and then you can
05:54 - see this is the default location where
05:57 - this IDE will be installed and if you
06:01 - don't have the good reason to change it
06:03 - just leave it as default and then click
06:05 - the install button which is going to
06:07 - start installing this IDE on your system
06:11 - and in between you will be able to see
06:13 - this license terms and conditions pop-up
06:16 - window you just need to accept the
06:20 - license and then just click accept here
06:24 - and leave the installation process until
06:26 - it's completed and now I can see this
06:29 - pop-up here which is asking me do you
06:32 - trust these certificates so I'm going to
06:34 - just check this checkbox here and then I
06:38 - will just X
06:40 - Sept selected and then the installation
06:43 - will go on and once the installation of
06:45 - this Eclipse IDE is finished we are
06:49 - ready to launch it so you can just click
06:52 - this Launch button which is going to
06:53 - launch the Eclipse IDE so you can see
06:56 - the newest version of Eclipse looks like
06:59 - this and for the first time when Eclipse
07:01 - IDE starts it'll ask you to provide the
07:04 - default workspace right so if you don't
07:08 - have the good reason to change it you
07:10 - can just leave it as default and even if
07:13 - you want in future the same default
07:16 - folder in which you want to save all
07:20 - your projects then you can check this
07:21 - checkbox which means that from the next
07:25 - time this path will be used for all
07:28 - other project which you create in the
07:31 - future so just check it if you want and
07:35 - then just click Launch
07:37 - and now the Eclipse IDE has been started
07:40 - so let's create a Java project for
07:44 - example for example we want to create a
07:46 - HelloWorld Java project what we can do
07:49 - here is we can go at the top here and
07:53 - just select the file option from here
07:54 - and then click new and then click Java
07:58 - project and once the Java project pop-up
08:01 - opens you can just write the name of the
08:04 - project
08:05 - here for example hello world and then
08:09 - finish it and once you click finish you
08:12 - will see nothing is changed here right
08:15 - so for the first time you need to just
08:19 - click this button on the top which says
08:23 - restore I think and this is going to
08:26 - restore your you know Eclipse IDE in the
08:30 - Java mode right so just click on the
08:34 - right-side restore button and now you
08:37 - can just click on the project's so I'm
08:40 - going to click on the project and there
08:42 - will be a source folder here and there
08:44 - is nothing inside the source package so
08:47 - let's create a class here so I'm going
08:50 - to right click and then new and then for
08:53 - example
08:53 - - just click the class and here I just
08:57 - need to give the name of my class for
08:59 - example hello world once again the same
09:03 - as the project name and then I will
09:05 - leave everything as default and when I
09:07 - go down there is an option which says
09:10 - which method stops would you like to
09:13 - create so I want to create a main method
09:15 - so I will just choose this option which
09:19 - says public static void main which is
09:21 - the main method of Java right and then
09:24 - click finish here which is going to
09:26 - create this class so now my class is
09:30 - created you can see helloworld.java I'm
09:33 - going to maximize this and inside my
09:36 - public static void main method I can
09:40 - just write system dot out dot print line
09:45 - or print Ln and then inside this print
09:50 - line arguments I can just print anything
09:53 - what I want so for example I just want
09:55 - to print hello world here so I will just
09:59 - write this so system dot out dot print
10:01 - line and in the parenthesis just write
10:04 - the message which you want to display
10:06 - then save your code you can save it by
10:10 - just pressing ctrl s or just going to
10:13 - the file and then pressing the save all
10:16 - button or save button once this is done
10:19 - you can run your project using this
10:21 - button which is the green button here so
10:23 - just click this button which is going to
10:26 - first compile your project and then run
10:29 - it so I can see hello world here that
10:31 - means my Eclipse IDE is successfully
10:34 - installed and it's working perfectly
10:36 - fine so in this way you can install
10:39 - Eclipse IDE on your Ubuntu operating
10:42 - system I hope you enjoyed this video
