00:03 - and once again go to the division button
00:05 - and past there
00:07 - okay so whenever I press any button for
00:12 - this plus minus or multiplication
00:15 - division this will we also are going to
00:19 - catch the button action and we will just
00:23 - take this like this
00:25 - here and we want to store this button
00:29 - operation
00:30 - in some variable so we go at the top of
00:33 - our class and we will declare two two uh
00:39 - variables one will be the double and
00:42 - which will contain our result value so
00:46 - it will
00:47 - be double and I will say this will be
00:52 - our
00:55 - result value and I will initialize it
00:58 - with zero
01:00 - and second will be the
01:03 - string which will contain our operation
01:06 - so operator or operation performed so
01:15 - operation performed and by default I
01:18 - will initialize it as
01:22 - lank
01:24 - okay and we are going to need one more
01:29 - um variable which we will we will see
01:33 - later but yeah now once we have this
01:36 - operator performed operation performed
01:40 - variable we can just take this operation
01:42 - perform variable and we can say this
01:47 - operation perform is button. text
01:52 - right so copy this
01:55 - button is equal to button
01:58 - dot text
02:01 - okay now I also want to pass the value
02:04 - from my text box to this
02:08 - value variable so I will just say
02:12 - value is equal to and to convert my text
02:17 - box uh value to the double value because
02:21 - this result value is a double I will
02:27 - write double dot
02:31 - pass and now I will pass the text in the
02:35 - text box with whatever text is in the
02:38 - text box I will convert it into the
02:40 - value
02:42 - right now whenever I
02:46 - click so just uh let's uh write the code
02:51 - for these two clear entry and clear
02:53 - button so double click this clear entry
02:56 - button and this will just clear
03:00 - our entry so just we can write textbox
03:04 - do result. text is equal
03:09 - to zero right and clear what this will
03:14 - do this will perform the same
03:18 - action plus it will make our result
03:22 - value is equal to Z is equal
03:26 - to
03:27 - Z okay
03:30 - so we have done that now what action is
03:34 - remaining this equal to action so in
03:38 - here just double click this equal to
03:41 - action or go to just select this equal
03:43 - to button and go to uh events and in the
03:47 - button click event just double click
03:48 - this button click
03:49 - event and we reach to the button click
03:52 - event of the of this button equal to and
03:56 - you can just use switch
03:58 - cases
03:59 - [Music]
04:01 - switch
04:03 - cases depending upon the value in the
04:07 - operation or this one operation perform
04:10 - variable
04:12 - okay so first of all the case uh can
04:18 - be case
04:21 - for not here
04:25 - but case for the addition
04:32 - and this can be so what we want to do we
04:35 - want
04:37 - to just in our text
04:40 - result we want to pass the result right
04:43 - so we will just write text result is
04:46 - equal to is equal
04:49 - to Value
04:53 - Plus because we are performing addition
04:55 - that's why I'm using plus here right and
04:58 - whatever in in the text box so whatever
05:02 - I have written here D double. pass
05:05 - double because we want to pass the value
05:08 - and then make the addition of those two
05:12 - and then convert it to the text so just
05:15 - surround it by bracket and just convert
05:19 - it to
05:21 - text so this is our
05:25 - double value let's
05:28 - see
05:30 - so this value will be result value
05:32 - instead of
05:33 - value and then we will convert it to the
05:36 - tech uh to the
05:38 - string and we have the
05:41 - string okay so this is the case one and
05:45 - we need to provide
05:48 - [Music]
05:49 - break and in the same way we can provide
05:54 - the condition for the subtraction
05:57 - multiplication division and we we can
05:59 - provide the condition for default
06:02 - [Music]
06:08 - operation
06:11 - default and
06:15 - break okay so in this we will
06:20 - subtract just write subtract and perform
06:25 - subtraction here here we will perform
06:28 - multiplication
06:32 - and here also and here we perform
06:35 - Division and here also okay so now we
06:40 - have all these
06:41 - things uh we need one more uh value that
06:46 - whenever we
06:48 - perform some operation or whenever we
06:51 - click this button uh we need to have
06:56 - some uh variable to store that it's
07:00 - performed or not so uh if I click this
07:03 - addition button I want to know if this
07:06 - button is clicked or not or what is the
07:10 - status of this button
07:12 - so what I'm going to do is in here in my
07:16 - code I will
07:20 - say
07:21 - [Music]
07:23 - bu
07:28 - is
07:30 - [Music]
07:32 - operation performed and by default its
07:35 - value will
07:37 - be
07:39 - false
07:43 - okay and after every Click Of This
07:47 - operat plus minus multiplication or
07:50 - Division I want to make this value as uh
07:54 - true so I will go to the operated click
07:58 - event and and after this
08:02 - or let's make it at the last I want to
08:07 - make this as
08:11 - true okay and after
08:15 - every uh number click event I want to
08:17 - make it as false so after every number
08:21 - click for example 7 8 9 or Z point I
08:24 - want to make it as
08:27 - false here
08:29 - and the button click event make
08:33 - it
08:35 - false okay now we have this um label in
08:41 - which we want to show some text right
08:44 - then whatever operation is happening so
08:47 - now I will clear the text of this label
08:50 - and I will give no no text to the
08:54 - label and the name of this label is
08:57 - label one I will change it to label
09:01 - um what can we change
09:05 - operation current operation for example
09:09 - label
09:12 - current operation okay and this label
09:16 - current
09:17 - operation just copy this uh name and
09:22 - whenever I click any operator here I
09:27 - want to have this in this text box right
09:32 - so on on the button click event or of
09:35 - this operators what I want to do
09:40 - here just in the operator click event
09:43 - you just need to make the Val take the
09:47 - value of the label label current
09:50 - operation dot
09:54 - text is equal to the value you have
09:57 - result value
10:01 - plus plus is a concatenation operator in
10:04 - this case and then we will provide a
10:07 - little space and then we will
10:12 - give the value performed or operation
10:16 - performed this string which we have
10:18 - declared here right so here will come
10:22 - this
10:24 - string
10:26 - okay so let's see what happens now when
10:30 - we run the
10:31 - program so 2 plus it shows here right
10:38 - three so now the addition is not
10:43 - happening you can see here because
10:47 - uh here we are not clearing this right
10:51 - on the on the this click event so what
10:55 - we can do here go at the top and
10:59 - whenever we click any number uh button
11:03 - we can add this text result. text is
11:06 - equal to Z condition in addition we can
11:08 - add one more condition so just add one
11:11 - more condition
11:14 - if this is true
11:17 - or our operation
11:21 - performed or we have some operation
11:25 - perform
11:27 - okay so now when we run the
11:32 - program we can see 22
11:36 - +
11:37 - 33 is equal to 55 66 or we need to clear
11:43 - it first and for
11:47 - example uh 66
11:51 - plus
11:53 - 55 okay so it's giving us the normal
11:58 - results but still we need to do some
12:01 - more things for
12:03 - example let's multiply by two that's
12:09 - happening so first of all it's uh too
12:12 - dark and when we perform some operation
12:16 - here you see it it's little bit light so
12:20 - I will change the font size of this uh
12:23 - label or font color of this label select
12:26 - this label and go to the four color and
12:31 - change I will change it to little bit
12:34 - button Shadow or little bit bra control
12:39 - dog
12:41 - okay and what I need to do here
12:45 - again I will run the program and let's
12:47 - see what I need to do so when I click
12:50 - this 2
12:52 - point
12:56 - three I I can see the the
13:01 - result like this once again I will run
13:04 - the program so 2 point you see
13:09 - here you cannot limit your points right
13:13 - now okay so you can have as many number
13:17 - of points like this whenever I click it
13:20 - click this so I need to take care of
13:22 - this also so I go to my button click
13:25 - event and in here I have this
13:29 - uh
13:31 - button button text in here but I will
13:35 - provide a special case for this uh Point
13:39 - text so if this uh text in the text
13:44 - field is this point or
13:47 - decimal is equal
13:50 - to
13:54 - decimal this
13:56 - one and let me provide this early
14:01 - basis
14:04 - else I will perform this okay and in
14:09 - here in the if condition what I need to
14:12 - check is
14:14 - if this text already contains uh so this
14:19 - text result already contains
14:22 - dot
14:26 - contains this point or not so I will
14:29 - just copy this and paste it
14:33 - here um and if it contains uh if if it
14:37 - doesn't
14:39 - contain then I will just make opposite
14:44 - of this so if this text doesn't contain
14:47 - this point already then only I need to
14:51 - provide this text otherwise I don't need
14:54 - to provide this and once again when I
14:56 - run the program and when I clicked 2
14:59 - point point point
15:01 - point still it's doing it let's see
15:09 - why okay so this if condition I need to
15:13 - take the text from the button not from
15:16 - the text box so like this and now let's
15:20 - see hopefully it will work point point
15:23 - point nothing happens
15:26 - right so we take care of this uh point
15:32 - also
15:33 - now let's try to run the
15:36 - program so for example
15:39 - 78 ultip by
15:41 - 3 gives us the result I will clear the
15:45 - text
15:47 - 33
15:49 - 333.33
15:51 - multiplied
15:53 - 6 gives us a correct
15:56 - result or 12
16:02 - 998 plus
16:05 - 55555 gives us the result for example I
16:09 - divide something by 0o so clear 9 IDE by
16:13 - 0 which will give
16:15 - Infinity okay it
16:17 - gives so basically our um operation is
16:22 - working but I want to make it a little
16:26 - bit more uh interactive in order to for
16:31 - example I click here 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 it's
16:36 - not showing the addition here right 3 +
16:40 - 3 should show 3 + 3 is equal 6 then + 6
16:46 - is = 9 here +
16:49 - 9 right so it should show the addition
16:52 - of these so how can I achieve
16:56 - this so once again I will go to this uh
17:00 - operation click event and in here when
17:04 - when I have this button captured or
17:07 - button text what I I can check here is
17:13 - if
17:15 - my value which is this one result value
17:20 - is equal to
17:23 - Z or is not equal to
17:26 - zero so is
17:30 - not equal to Z in this case I want to
17:35 - perform the same
17:37 - operation I'm performing
17:40 - in my equal to operation so I want to
17:44 - perform the same operation as this
17:47 - button because uh this will replicate
17:50 - the functionality of uh this addition or
17:53 - multiplication whenever I uh add this
17:56 - right so just go
17:59 - there um copy the name of your equal to
18:02 - button which is button 15 in my
18:05 - case so button 15
18:09 - DOT perform
18:13 - click perform click so this action will
18:17 - perform the click event of this uh equal
18:21 - to button and this uh action will be
18:24 - taken
18:26 - right and uh once you uh once this is
18:30 - done basically you want to do the same
18:33 - just copy all the
18:35 - operations and paste just below this but
18:38 - I just want to remove this value is
18:41 - equal to double pass so operation
18:44 - perform uh is equal to button. text and
18:47 - this label will be uh will be modified
18:51 - with the result and the operation
18:54 - performed and this will become true else
19:00 - I want to
19:02 - perform the normal
19:08 - operation okay so now let's try to run
19:13 - the
19:14 - program so 3 + 6 you
19:19 - see here comes six and when I click plus
19:22 - it says 9 +
19:26 - 4 and when I say minus it say it
19:30 - converts it to
19:33 - 7
19:36 - plus 9 for example plus so it's showing
19:41 - the result to us right 3 + 2 or 32 +
19:48 - uh
19:52 - 36+ still it's I'm not showing the
19:56 - correct result because this is not
19:59 - changing right so when I click plus plus
20:03 - plus it's only adding three to it so to
20:07 - correct
20:10 - this I will go to
20:12 - my equal to button click event so just
20:16 - select your equal to button go to button
20:18 - click event of equal to and I will make
20:21 - this
20:22 - value is equal
20:24 - [Music]
20:26 - to whatever is the value in in the text
20:28 - box so just copy this result
20:31 - value and go outside your switch
20:34 - condition equal
20:37 - to double because we want to
20:40 - convert from double
20:43 - [Music]
20:45 - to
20:48 - par so string to double we want to
20:50 - convert so whatever is in the textbox
20:54 - result I will transfer it to the to my
20:59 - result and I will just make whatever
21:03 - text is inside my label I want to make
21:08 - it as blank or clear this text so just
21:13 - make it is equal to
21:16 - blank equal to
21:19 - blank okay so just add these two things
21:24 - now I'll run the program and let's see
21:26 - if it's working or not
21:29 - 98 +
21:32 - 6 98 + 6 is 104 so 104 should come here
21:39 - and the result also should come here
21:41 - plus okay right now I will say plus 6 so
21:48 - result is result is
21:51 - 1010 minus so 1010
21:56 - minus for example 100 okay and I will
22:00 - once again I want to multiply whatever
22:03 - is the result which is 10 multiply by
22:06 - six for
22:07 - example and I say equal to
22:11 - 60 so now our uh calculator is working
22:18 - uh like we have expected there are still
22:22 - more functionality to you can add to
22:24 - your
22:25 - calculator like uh Square root or some
22:29 - other mathematical operations but this
22:32 - is how you can make a simple calculator
22:36 - this can be your starting point to make
22:38 - a
22:39 - calculator and you can play with this
22:42 - calculator you can add more
22:44 - functionalities like key press events
22:48 - right now it's just listening for these
22:50 - events but you can add key press events
22:53 - and other events also and make it more
22:58 - Advanced so I leave it on you how you
23:01 - can use this calculator and make it
23:04 - Advanced and I hope you have enjoyed
23:06 - this video please wait comment and
23:07 - subscribe and bye for now
