00:00 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:01 - show you how you can install Linux Mint
00:03 - on Virtual box I'm using open to
00:06 - operating system as a host for the
00:09 - virtual box but you can use Windows 7 or
00:11 - Mac OS as a host for virtual box and the
00:14 - step will remain the same so let's get
00:17 - started first of all we will download
00:18 - the Linux Mint ISO file from uh its
00:22 - website so just go to your favorite web
00:24 - browser and search for Linux Min
00:26 - download search for it and the first
00:29 - link you will find here is
00:31 - www. linux.com download click this link
00:35 - and in here there are different flavors
00:38 - you can choose for your Linux Mint for
00:40 - example cinnamon cinnamon no codex or
00:44 - other flavors but I will choose this
00:46 - first option cinnamon and you can even
00:49 - choose if you want 30 bit 2bit or 64bit
00:53 - operating system so I will choose this
00:55 - uh 64-bit operating system which is
00:58 - cinnamon and then then you will find the
01:02 - M mirrors of this ISO file so whatever
01:06 - location is closer to your location just
01:10 - click uh that location so for example I
01:13 - want to choose Germany and this mirror
01:16 - and just save it on your computer it's a
01:20 - relatively Big File about 1.3 GB file so
01:23 - it will take some time to download So
01:26 - once your file is downloaded you are
01:28 - ready to install Linux
01:30 - so fire up your virtual box and in here
01:33 - just click this
01:35 - new and
01:37 - write Linux here by default it will uh
01:42 - uh you know recognize that it's a Linux
01:44 - and version is Linux 2.6 SL 3.x
01:49 - 64bit there are other versions like
01:52 - Ubuntu 64bit or even dbn 64bit but Linux
01:59 - Mint is not not listed in these versions
02:01 - so you can just choose Linux 2.6 SL 3.x
02:06 - 64bit or otherwise if you have installed
02:08 - 30 B2 bit then this option is okay and
02:13 - click next and in here you can provide
02:16 - the memory size which you want to give
02:19 - to your operating system I will give it
02:23 - around 1024 MB click next create a
02:27 - virtual hard drive create
02:30 - and vdi yes next and I want the
02:34 - dynamically allocated physical hard
02:37 - drive so I will click next and in
02:40 - here the size uh which you want to
02:44 - allocate to your operating system by
02:47 - default it's
02:48 - 8GB but I will provide a little bit more
02:53 - around 10 or 11 GB because it requires
02:57 - little bit more than 8 GB GB okay so I
03:01 - will provide 10 GB to my operating
03:04 - system for example create and now your
03:09 - virtual operating system is created but
03:11 - you haven't given the path of ISO file
03:15 - to this uh operating system so to start
03:18 - this you need to give the path SE select
03:21 - your U your uh operating system here and
03:26 - go to settings go to storage and and in
03:29 - control controller IDE select empty and
03:33 - click the small CD button choose virtual
03:37 - CD DVD disk file and select your ISO
03:42 - file which you have downloaded for Linux
03:43 - Mint mine is Linux Min
03:47 - 17- cinamon d64 bit click open and click
03:52 - okay once you have done that select your
03:55 - Linux Mint from here and click Start and
03:59 - it will
04:00 - start your Linux
04:03 - Mint so for the first time when you
04:06 - start this it will
04:09 - open this uh Linux Mint from that ISO
04:13 - file but once it's open you need to
04:15 - install it so I will show you how you
04:18 - can install
04:20 - it we will wait for the
04:28 - starting
04:39 - so now it looks like it will start in
04:42 - some
04:49 - seconds okay so once this is started you
04:53 - need to install Linux Mint so you need
04:55 - to choose this Linux install Linux Min
04:59 - icon from from here just double click
05:00 - this
05:07 - icon and the installation wizard will
05:11 - start so first of all it will ask you
05:13 - what language you want to uh use for uh
05:17 - this uh installation I will use English
05:21 - so this will be the language for your
05:22 - operating system you can choose
05:25 - different languages according to your
05:28 - preferences and click
05:33 - continue and in
05:35 - here you see here it's showing it
05:39 - requires 8.6 GB but we have given enough
05:43 - memory or enough U drive space we have
05:46 - given 10 GB so it's okay and everything
05:51 - is okay internet is connected click
05:55 - continue and then this computer
05:58 - currently has uh uh no detected
06:00 - operating system this message is showing
06:03 - because you are running it on uh virtual
06:06 - box right so in your virtual box it
06:10 - doesn't detect this so you just need to
06:13 - click this option erase dis and install
06:16 - Linux Mint don't worry it will not
06:18 - delete your original operating system so
06:21 - it's nothing to worry about just choose
06:24 - this option and click next or install
06:28 - now
06:32 - choose your location wherever you are
06:34 - situated so and press
06:40 - continue and then choose the language of
06:44 - your keyboard
06:45 - layout I have a German keyboard layout
06:48 - so I will choose uh this German
06:53 - keyboard but depending upon the layout
06:56 - of your keyboard you can choose this
06:58 - okay German German
07:04 - continue now you need to give the name
07:07 - of your operating system I will name it
07:10 - as Linux Mint
07:14 - itself and you need to give the password
07:16 - so I will give the
07:19 - password and confirm the
07:22 - password Okay click
07:28 - continue
07:34 - and now the installation has started and
07:37 - it will take around 4 to 5 minutes to
07:40 - complete this installation and once it's
07:43 - installed it will ask you to restart
07:46 - your Linux Mint so we will wait for the
07:49 - completion of this installation and then
07:51 - I will show you how to go further
07:56 - okay so now our installation is complete
07:59 - delete and it's asking to restart uh
08:02 - this operating system Linux men so I
08:05 - will click this uh restart Now button
08:08 - and it will restart this virtual machine
08:11 - or virtual operating system once again
08:14 - generally I have observed when you click
08:17 - uh restart after installing uh any
08:21 - operating system on Virtual box and when
08:23 - you click restart it takes much time to
08:27 - restart this operating system
08:29 - so one way is to just close the
08:33 - operating system you are running and uh
08:36 - you know start it once again so you see
08:39 - it's taking a little bit time so I will
08:42 - close this and I will say power off that
08:46 - machine and once again I will choose
08:49 - this uh Linux Mint from here and start
08:51 - it once again it's much faster to start
08:55 - it like
08:58 - this
09:02 - and now you can see this
09:17 - symbol
09:19 - and you will see a login screen
09:28 - soon
09:35 - so you see here you are seeing the login
09:39 - screen and in here you need to give your
