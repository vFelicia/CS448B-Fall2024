00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Android app development for
00:04 - beginners and in this video we will see
00:06 - how to use time picker dialogue in
00:09 - Android in the last video we have seen
00:12 - how to use time picker in Android and
00:15 - the main issue you can say with time
00:18 - picker is that it occupies uh large
00:22 - space in Android
00:24 - activity and time picker dialogue you
00:26 - can use when you want to utilize your
00:30 - activity space and this time picker
00:33 - dialogue can pop up when some button is
00:37 - pressed so you can uh you know
00:40 - efficiently utilize the space inside the
00:43 - activity so let's see how we can use
00:46 - time picker dialogue in Android so first
00:50 - of all what I'm going to do is I'm going
00:52 - to take a
00:54 - button and I will change the text of
00:56 - this button
00:58 - as show
01:03 - time picker
01:08 - dialogue okay and we just need this uh
01:12 - button in order to uh open the time
01:15 - picker dialogue so we will directly go
01:18 - to the main activity. Java file so just
01:21 - go to your Java folder and open your
01:24 - main activity. Java and in here we will
01:27 - write the code for time picker dialogue
01:29 - so first first of all uh let's create
01:32 - the object for button
01:36 - so
01:39 - button
01:41 - button
01:44 - stpd for show time picker dialogue right
01:48 - and we will also create three
01:52 - variables for minute hour and dialogue
01:57 - ID okay so let's cre create those three
02:01 - variables first will be the dialogue ID
02:05 - which is an integer so let's create
02:10 - it
02:12 - static final
02:18 - int
02:20 - dialogue ID and I can initialize it with
02:25 - zero and now we are going to declare two
02:28 - variable which will be holding the hour
02:32 - and minute for us using time picker
02:36 - right so
02:39 - int
02:41 - hour and
02:46 - int minute for
02:48 - example and let's uh add some other text
02:53 - to minutes for example minute
02:58 - X and and our X so that it can be you
03:04 - know identified as user defined
03:07 - variables okay so once we have created
03:11 - these three
03:12 - variables what we can do is we can
03:15 - create a method in which we can call uh
03:19 - this button click event and inside this
03:22 - button click event we can call our show
03:25 - dialogue method to show this time picker
03:29 - okay so let's create
03:33 - a public method public
03:36 - void
03:38 - show
03:41 - time
03:44 - picker dialogue for example and this is
03:47 - a user defined method which we are
03:49 - creating and in here we are going to uh
03:52 - cast our button okay so
03:56 - button is equal to
04:05 - button find view by ID R do ID
04:12 - dot
04:15 - button now once you have casted your
04:18 - button you can use this button object to
04:21 - call set on click method okay so set on
04:26 - click listener on the button object
04:30 - and inside the Set onclick uh method we
04:33 - can use
04:35 - new onclick listener okay and once you
04:40 - call this new onclick listener inside
04:43 - this onclick method you can call a
04:46 - method called show dialogue and this
04:51 - method you can use to pop up the
04:56 - dialogue okay and the dialogue type we
04:59 - can Define it later but uh what we are
05:02 - going to do is we will pass this
05:04 - dialogue ID in here in show dialog okay
05:10 - now what we are going to do is we are
05:12 - going to call a inbuilt method like on
05:15 - create method there is a method called
05:18 - oncreate dialogue similar to this
05:21 - oncreate method which is a buildin
05:24 - method right so you can even copy this
05:28 - much amount of code from here and what
05:31 - we are going to do is Let's uh create
05:34 - this method Above This Showtime pick a
05:38 - dialogue okay so let's create this
05:41 - method here or you can create uh below
05:45 - your show time picker dialogue method
05:47 - which we have created so just uh create
05:51 - a method which is
05:53 - overriding uh protected void on create
05:58 - dialogue okay okay so create this
06:04 - method and this will take one argument
06:08 - which will be ID okay and now what you
06:14 - can do is uh let's return a dialogue uh
06:18 - using this method so in here just return
06:22 - a dialogue okay because we want to show
06:26 - the dialogue so we will return the
06:29 - dialogue using this method now what we
06:32 - are going to do is we will compare the
06:35 - ID which is passed uh as an argument to
06:39 - the dialogue ID we which we have
06:41 - declared above right so
06:46 - if this
06:48 - ID is equal to the dialogue ID which we
06:52 - have declared which is this one then
06:56 - what we are going to do is we are going
06:57 - to return
07:02 - return
07:04 - new time picker
07:07 - dialogue okay and this
07:10 - takes you can see this takes uh 1 2 3
07:16 - four four or five arguments you can see
07:19 - it here first is the context context can
07:23 - be your class in which you are working
07:26 - so main activity dot this this and
07:31 - second argument is the time dialogue so
07:35 - this uh for example right now we create
07:39 - uh um variable which we are going to
07:42 - Define later okay so
07:48 - time
07:52 - picker listner for example okay third
07:56 - argument you can pass our
08:02 - which we have
08:03 - defined and minute is the fourth
08:07 - argument minute X and hour x these two
08:11 - variables we have defined above right
08:13 - like here right so these uh two
08:16 - variables we will pass as third and
08:20 - fourth arguments and the last argument
08:24 - and the fifth argument it takes
08:26 - is what format of you know dialogue time
08:30 - picker dialogue you want to show is it
08:33 - uh 24hour format or 12h hour format and
08:37 - by default uh it asks for the 24 hours
08:41 - which we don't want so I will set it
08:48 - false okay so once you have uh done now
08:53 - by default if this condition is not fil
08:56 - fulfilled what we are going to do is we
08:58 - are going to
09:00 - return by default null if this condition
09:03 - is not fulfilled okay in any other
09:06 - condition we are going to return false
09:09 - okay now let's create this time picker
09:13 - listener variable okay so what we are
09:17 - going to do
09:19 - is we are going to declare this uh
09:22 - variable so let's uh declare it it will
09:25 - be
09:26 - protected and let's create some space
09:29 - here and it will
09:31 - be time picker
09:35 - dialogue
09:37 - dot on time set
09:40 - listener and the name of the variable is
09:45 - this one which we are going to declare
09:48 - is equal to
09:51 - new time set listener okay so on time
09:55 - set listener okay so what we have done
09:59 - we have declared a protected uh variable
10:03 - which is time picker dialog. ontime set
10:07 - listener and we have declared the same
10:10 - variable which we have passed here is
10:12 - equal to new time picker dialogue. on
10:17 - time set listener and it will be created
10:21 - automatically and don't forget to close
10:24 - this by samiul and in here inside this
10:27 - on time set method first of all what we
10:31 - are going to do is we are going to uh
10:34 - set the values of hour and minute so
10:38 - just copy your our variables which we
10:43 - have declared above in here in on time
10:46 - set method is equal to you can see here
10:51 - it takes two arguments one is hour of
10:54 - day which represents the hour of day as
10:58 - the n name suggest and second
11:02 - variable we can assign to this minute
11:07 - underscore X variable which we have
11:09 - declared is equal to minute here okay
11:14 - which is the third argument here okay
11:18 - now once we have assigned these two
11:20 - variables we can uh call these uh you
11:25 - know variables using for example toast
11:28 - to so we can show what's the value
11:30 - inside these two variables toast dot
11:34 - make text and the context you can take
11:39 - this context once
11:41 - again comma
11:44 - the the text you want to show so for

12:12 - show our dialogue okay now don't forget
12:17 - to call this
12:19 - Showtime picker dialogue method which we
12:22 - have created by ourself so just copy
