00:00 - Oh
00:01 - hello there and welcome to programming
00:03 - knowledge so this is Ganesh and the last
00:06 - video we had seen the correlation
00:08 - between independent variables and
00:11 - dropping the missing values so in
00:14 - today's video we'll see the cross
00:16 - tabulation and data visualization so
00:19 - let's get started
00:20 - so what we'll do first let me get an
00:23 - idea of how many columns are there in
00:25 - particular data frames so data frame we
00:27 - had was data - you want to see the
00:30 - column so data - dot columns will give
00:34 - us all the columns present in the data
00:37 - frame you can see a job tab salary
00:41 - status so let's see the gender
00:43 - proportion so how you can see the gender
00:46 - proportion so for that we'll need a
00:48 - gender from the data frame and we'll use
00:51 - pandas property cross step function so
00:54 - we create a variable called gender
00:55 - equals to PD dot cross F so in this
01:01 - function
01:02 - we'll pass first parameter as index
01:05 - equals to the data frame column if you
01:09 - want to consider so we'll call theta 2
01:12 - then slicing operator and then the
01:15 - gender that is the column next thing
01:19 - which we want is columns columns we
01:23 - consider as count because we need a
01:27 - count of the gender and then yone
01:32 - proportion so or that will use normalize
01:35 - equals to true and if you now print the
01:42 - gender variable you can see the
01:46 - proportions of female and male in the
01:49 - population so here you can see male
01:51 - proportion is more that is 1667 percent
01:54 - whereas female is 32% so now let's see
01:59 - bivariate analysis so we'll consider two
02:02 - variables gender and salary status and
02:04 - we will find out what is the
02:06 - relationship between them so for that
02:09 - what we can do we'll just create a
02:11 - variable same like gender so we consider
02:14 - gender underscore celery stat equals two
02:19 - will call cost F function again and
02:22 - inside that will pass index equals to
02:25 - which column we want to consider from
02:28 - data frame we want gender and next one
02:35 - is
02:37 - in the columns we considered the salary
02:44 - status that is a column so s al st k t
02:49 - comma along with the gender female and
02:53 - female category you want all category so
02:55 - we'll consider margins equals to true to
02:58 - get that and the next one is normalized
03:01 - so to convert the count into proportions
03:03 - and if you run it and if you just bring
03:08 - this you can see all along with that
03:17 - female male for salary status of greater
03:21 - than 50,000 in less than or equal to
03:23 - 50,000 for two categories you can see
03:25 - that male has thirty percent population
03:29 - who has category of greater than fifty
03:31 - thousand salary and female is only 10%
03:35 - for Katahdin saloon greater than 50,000
03:37 - rupees seller and in the less than or
03:42 - equal to 50,000 category you can see the
03:44 - females as eighty-nine percent whereas
03:46 - giant says 69 percent
03:48 - so overall male has more as compared to
03:52 - humans
03:55 - so let's see the frequency distribution
03:57 - of salary status so for that what we can
04:01 - do is we can draw plot using Saban
04:06 - library so we'll create a variable
04:09 - called sell stat it was - then we'll
04:11 - call SNS that is C bond library and from
04:14 - that we'll call count dot function so in
04:17 - this if you do the celery status column
04:21 - data frame data frame is 0-2 and column
04:26 - name is salary sale stead filter on this
04:29 - we get a count plot and here you can see
04:32 - 75% that is this is less than or equal
04:36 - to 50,000 rupees celery people whereas
04:40 - 25% is greater than 50,000 celerity so
04:43 - now we will see a Quincy distribution of
04:46 - age so how we can see that is you just
04:51 - call the C bond library again to plot or
04:56 - displ ah'd so distraught so as the
05:01 - distribution of age over the intervals
05:04 - so the column which you want to consider
05:07 - each age and then how many number of
05:12 - beans we want so we will consider 10
05:14 - bins that is 10 intervals or columns you
05:16 - can see and the kernel density estimate
05:18 - that is KD we don't want so we'll equal
05:21 - to false so the frequency will come to
05:24 - the y-axis if you keep if you make it KD
05:28 - equal to false it will now run it you
05:31 - can see that
05:33 - the age is given from 0 to 90 and the
05:37 - count is doing here and in here you can
05:39 - see people of age 20 to 45 are in very
05:45 - high fencing
05:47 - whereas other age people are not dead
05:50 - much
05:51 - now we'll do bivariate analysis for for
05:54 - agent sale state there is every status
05:57 - so how we can do is we'll use box plot
05:59 - distance over SNS dot box plot and what
06:04 - we'll plot is will use salary state
06:07 - along with that we want gauge also so
06:12 - we'll compare both of them and data will
06:16 - get it from a data frame data type and
06:21 - we also want to group by this data frame
06:24 - so we will use group by a function so
06:33 - theta 2 dot group by so inside this
06:35 - function will give us our very one that
06:38 - is salary state so later frame will be
06:42 - grouped on the basis of the salary
06:45 - status and in that will use H a slicing
06:52 - operator and we'll consider the medium
06:56 - of that H so solicitous will be grouped
07:06 - by
07:07 - on the basis of age of medium
07:15 - you
07:21 - we now run this
07:28 - so yeah I was pokin spelling mistakes it
07:32 - should be group by and here we can see
07:35 - this a little status so people with 35
07:42 - to 50 age then see 35 to 50 H are more
07:47 - likely to on greater than 50,000 where
07:50 - is people from 25 that is this much to
07:54 - 35 are more likely took on less than or
07:58 - equal to 50,000
08:00 - so this was bivariate analysis for a
08:03 - Josie salary shatters so I want you to
08:06 - kept this for bivariate analysis for job
08:12 - type so top job type is a column job
08:19 - type versus salary status and also for
08:29 - education so compare these columns to
08:37 - find out insights from them so education
08:44 - versus salary status and then also
08:51 - occupation forces salary status also
08:58 - four hours per week versus celery status
09:06 - and also there is own variable called
09:10 - capital capital gain so try to get by
09:16 - rate analysis on the debt also so so
09:22 - this will help you in depth EC and get
09:26 - getting more understanding of pie rate
09:29 - analysis so in the same way like I have
09:33 - done box cod count one dished God
09:37 - we can do biotech analysis for all these
09:40 - columns so guys thank you for watching
09:44 - and I will see you on next video with a
09:46 - different case study
09:48 - you
