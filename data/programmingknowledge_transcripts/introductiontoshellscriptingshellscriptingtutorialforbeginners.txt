00:00 - hello guys and welcome back to the
00:01 - channel this is ayush and from now we
00:04 - are going to start out the data shell
00:05 - scripting tutorial okay so we will start
00:09 - with the basics to the advanced and we
00:12 - will cover many uh Concepts like we will
00:15 - cover like programming uh Concepts like
00:17 - a fails for Loop so
00:20 - and also we will create some scripts
00:23 - like automated scripts and we will do
00:26 - some minor projects also
00:28 - so now from this video like in today's
00:31 - video we will cover some basic concepts
00:33 - like what is a shell uh what is a bash
00:36 - and also we'll see how you can create
00:38 - your first script that will be very
00:40 - interesting thing okay but before
00:43 - starting uh let me tell you like we use
00:45 - cell scripting uh mostly for the purpose
00:48 - of the automation okay if you want to
00:50 - automate some kind of some kind of task
00:52 - then you can use the cell scripting as
00:55 - an automation uh like not as an
00:57 - automation you can say like
00:59 - uh Shadow you can use the cell script as
01:02 - a tool to automate your work okay
01:06 - so now first of all now let's come to
01:08 - the point and we will learn about the
01:10 - what is the shell okay so shell is
01:13 - nothing but you can say it's uh just
01:16 - like interface which provides you to
01:19 - write some codes and routes write some
01:21 - commands so right now this terminally
01:24 - using the bash shape okay so but also
01:27 - according to the some other articles
01:29 - some books uh shell is just like an
01:32 - interpreter like uh it basically runs uh
01:36 - [Music]
01:38 - uh like executes the command line by
01:40 - line okay so that is the work of The
01:43 - Interpreter like it executes the code
01:46 - line by line and if some error occurs
01:49 - then it will just throw it on the screen
01:51 - so shell is just also like a interpreter
01:54 - it basically
01:56 - interprets the dot sh files or dot sh
01:59 - programs you can say or you can say the
02:02 - scripts so now you will say what is a
02:04 - script so script is nothing but
02:07 - like your program file just like in
02:09 - Python UK dot Pi UI file so similarly in
02:12 - in cell scripting you know in batches
02:13 - scripting we create the dot sh file okay
02:18 - so why we say like shell acts like
02:21 - interpreter because it interprets the
02:23 - dot sh files or dot sh programs you can
02:26 - say
02:27 - so I hope you got a fair idea about what
02:30 - is a cell okay so now let's start with
02:33 - the
02:34 - basic concept like what are the
02:36 - different types of cell and obviously as
02:37 - operating system okay
02:40 - so there are many cells like a partial
02:43 - and also uh like K bone cell bone again
02:47 - cell okay so you can get the list of the
02:49 - cells in this particular directly uh
02:53 - that's not directly it's a directory
02:55 - okay so here you can see the multiple
02:57 - cells is being used or present in my
02:59 - this operating system
03:01 - so for this whole series we will uh like
03:04 - stick with the only the second one this
03:06 - one passes best that means gone against
03:08 - shell okay but uh this uh sh the first
03:12 - one cell was the first cell uh which was
03:15 - created by the Linux and the next uh
03:18 - there is one against shell came into the
03:19 - role
03:21 - so uh we will use the Born Again shell
03:24 - for our this entire series and uh
03:27 - now what we have to do uh we have to
03:30 - just create a one single script of hello
03:32 - world and uh
03:34 - also let me tell you the what is this
03:36 - bin so the cell your your cell will be
03:39 - present in this bin directory okay
03:42 - so now but before creating your first
03:46 - script let me tell you the
03:48 - uh what the script is being used by this
03:51 - session or by this terminal so you need
03:54 - to just enter this Eco and the cell
03:56 - Powershell and here you can see the
03:58 - batch shell is being used okay now we
04:01 - have to go we have to just create the
04:03 - first script that is the hello world
04:05 - script how we will do it we will just
04:08 - move on to the desktop
04:11 - and I'll create the cat
04:15 - hello world.sh why dot research because
04:20 - like we are getting a solicit script so
04:24 - batches script that's the way using the
04:26 - dot is such extension
04:28 - so here you can see the file has been
04:30 - created hello daughter so now I will use
04:32 - this hash slash then cash
04:36 - it's just like this line basically tells
04:39 - like uh tells our script or our the
04:42 - shell to which shell to use like tell
04:45 - The Interpreter which cell to use so
04:47 - here I am just defining like I want to
04:49 - use the B Bash again of cell that is
04:52 - this one main batch not sh okay so now I
04:56 - can do eco eco is just like the print
04:58 - command kit
05:02 - Echo hello old
05:05 - I'm learning
05:09 - Bash
05:10 - scripting
05:16 - this one now that Ctrl D and to run the
05:19 - script you need to add some permission
05:22 - so you cannot directly run the script if
05:25 - you will check the permission for hello
05:26 - world.sh so here you can see this is
05:29 - only read write permission you cannot
05:30 - execute that escape so to give the
05:34 - particular permission to this particular
05:35 - file you will need to just give add the
05:38 - permission using ch1 you will if you
05:40 - will use plus X and the hello world dot
05:42 - is the name of the file so permission
05:45 - will get added and here you will see the
05:48 - execution permission has been added and
05:50 - the color also has been changed from
05:52 - white to the green okay now to execute
05:55 - what you do you have to just do dot
05:57 - slash and the name of the script and you
06:00 - are done so as you can see our script
06:02 - has been executed successfully
06:05 - okay so I hope you like this guys like
06:09 - how you can create the shell scripting
06:11 - and also you I hope you got to learn
06:13 - about the what is a shell what is Bash
06:15 - and if not then please go and you should
06:19 - explore yourself also
06:21 - okay
06:23 - so that's all for this guys we will meet
06:25 - you in the next video thank you thank
06:26 - you for watching and I will come up and
06:28 - meet you in the next video with some
06:29 - amazing Concepts thank you
