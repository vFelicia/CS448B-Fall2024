00:56 - this kind of window which says turn
00:58 - window features on and off
01:01 - this you can open by just searching for

01:20 - so once this window is open
01:22 - let me just
01:24 - make it little bit bigger
01:26 - so once this window opens
01:29 - you just need to scroll down at the very
01:31 - bottom
01:32 - and you need to select this option it

07:19 - here and now i'm going to
07:22 - try to restart my ubuntu app
07:26 - so let me just click on this ubuntu app
07:28 - and this time hopefully you will not see
07:31 - this error so you can see here the
07:33 - installation of ubuntu has been
07:35 - successfully started and it says please
07:37 - create a default unix user account the
07:41 - username does not need to match your
07:44 - windows username so now i'm going to
07:46 - give the unix username and as you can
07:49 - see here this username does not need to
07:52 - match your windows user so i'm going to
07:54 - just
07:55 - give for example code bind here as the
07:59 - username and then press enter
08:01 - and then i'm going to give the new
08:03 - password so this password also does not
08:06 - need to be the your windows password so
08:09 - let me give the new password here and
08:11 - then press enter and then retype that
08:14 - password and then press enter
08:17 - and you can see the password is updated
08:19 - successfully
08:21 - and now
08:22 - i am logged in to
08:24 - my ubuntu operating system
08:27 - and now i can start using uh this ubuntu
08:30 - bash on my windows 11 operating systems
08:33 - so let's try to check this by giving
08:35 - some commands so let me just start from
08:38 - the
08:39 - clear terminal
08:41 - and here first of all i'm going to just
08:43 - give this command ls minus al which is
08:46 - going to list all the files and folders
08:48 - in the current directory
08:50 - we can also give pwt command which is
08:52 - going to show you the
08:54 - current working directory so now you
08:56 - might be wondering how you can navigate
08:59 - your c drive or d drive
09:02 - on your windows operating system using
09:04 - this bash
09:06 - shell right so the c or d drive or any
09:10 - other drive
09:12 - from your
09:13 - windows operating system is mounted on
09:16 - this uh
09:17 - linux bash shell
09:20 - and we can verify this by uh just typing
09:24 - this command so just type ls
09:26 - forward slash mnt forward slash and then
09:30 - press enter
09:31 - and you will be able to see the drive
09:33 - which are mounted
09:34 - to
09:35 - your uh linux operating system so you
09:39 - can see the c drive and i can see the
09:41 - wsl so let's go to uh our windows
09:45 - operating system folder explorer and you
09:48 - can see i have the c drive here right
09:51 - so
09:52 - to go inside the c drive let me also
09:55 - show you the content of my c drive here
09:58 - so to go inside the c drive you just
10:01 - need to write cd and then forward slash
10:04 - mnt and then
10:06 - c right and then i'm going to press
10:09 - enter here
10:10 - and let's list out all the files and
10:13 - folders so ls
10:15 - hyphen al and then press enter
10:18 - and you will be able to see all these
10:21 - files which will match the files and
10:24 - folders
10:25 - which are present in
10:27 - my
10:28 - windows operating system so i can
10:30 - already see the ffmpeg
10:33 - kotlin c for example and then program
10:36 - files and program files
10:38 - x86
10:40 - will be there you can see these folders
10:43 - are there
10:44 - and all the other folders will be
10:46 - present for example this xampp folder i
10:50 - will be able to find here then
10:52 - vamp 64
10:54 - and then sqlite so all these folders i
10:57 - can see
10:58 - so this is how you can navigate to your
11:00 - c or d directory uh
11:02 - of your windows 11 operating system
11:04 - using this uh linux or ubuntu terminal
11:08 - right
11:09 - now let's uh try to create let's say
11:12 - some file in the
11:14 - desktop folder okay so i have this
11:17 - desktop folder and i want to navigate to
11:20 - the desktop folder and i want to create
11:22 - some file here let's say
11:24 - so
11:26 - in my c drive where can i find the
11:29 - desktop i will be able to find the
11:31 - desktop in the users and then the
11:34 - username
11:35 - and then there will be this desktop here
11:38 - right
11:39 - so same i have to do here so inside my c
11:42 - drive i will just cd to the
11:45 - users folder and then the
11:49 - name which is the username and then
11:52 - desktop right and then press enter now
11:56 - i'm in my desktop folder and let me
11:58 - create a simple file here i can do this
12:01 - using the touch command
12:03 - and then let's say i want to create this
12:05 - test.txt
12:07 - file i'm going to press enter and once i
12:10 - press enter you can see this test
12:14 - dot txt file is created on my desktop
12:19 - so once you have installed this ubuntu
12:21 - app using wsl
12:24 - you can also use bash from your command
12:27 - line so when you search for cmd this is
12:30 - the windows 11 command prompt so i'm
12:33 - going to just open this and here when
12:35 - you type bash and then press enter
12:38 - it's going to open the open tools
12:42 - bash terminal so from here also you can
12:45 - use the ubuntu's
12:47 - terminal on your windows command prompt
12:50 - so this is how you can
12:52 - install the support for windows
12:55 - subsystem for linux on your windows 11
12:58 - operating system
13:00 - and install various linux operating
13:03 - system
13:04 - on your windows 11 operating system
13:08 - i hope you've enjoyed this video and i
13:10 - will see you in the next video
