00:00 - now in this video we'll be learning
00:02 - about the command substitution okay so
00:04 - as the name suggests to command
00:05 - substitution which basically means we
00:07 - can use a variable name as a command
00:10 - okay you will store the commands in a
00:12 - variable it's not that interesting okay
00:15 - so we will be running these things in
00:17 - this particular video so let's start
00:19 - whatever what first thing you have to do
00:21 - you have to just open up your Tommy not
00:23 - terminal you have to just open up the uh
00:25 - vs code okay so I actually have already
00:27 - opened up here the vs4 as you can see so
00:30 - now what you have to do you have to just
00:32 - create one file uh I will name it as
00:35 - zero four commands substitute
00:41 - substitution okay I hope this spelling
00:44 - is uh
00:46 - correct yeah it's correct by the way it
00:49 - doesn't matter at all
00:51 - okay so now what we can do you have just
00:55 - paste this okay Bank okay
00:59 - so here let me just enter this like Eco
01:02 - this is
01:05 - no not like this you have to just enter
01:07 - this commands
01:09 - substitution
01:11 - tutorial okay tutorial
01:16 - okay so now uh let me tell you about the
01:20 - First Command which you can use as a
01:22 - variable okay so I will create one
01:24 - variable Uh current
01:27 - directory okay so how you can get the
01:31 - correct directory in uh Linux okay uh if
01:34 - you have watched our Linux series then
01:36 - you know the command that is a PWD
01:39 - present working directly which gives you
01:41 - the uh current directory location okay
01:44 - so we will use the PWD but before using
01:47 - those things uh right now I will tell
01:49 - you the ways how you can uh
01:52 - uh what you can say uh
01:54 - how we can declare uh that command to a
01:58 - particular variable okay so you can use
02:00 - the back ticks okay just the button uh
02:03 - left of one okay and here you can enter
02:07 - the whatever command which you want and
02:09 - right now I want to PWD and you can just
02:12 - print this one like
02:14 - here present working your present
02:19 - working directory is
02:22 - like this bro okay yes
02:26 - we will use this not hash I need all our
02:30 - current not container
02:33 - yeah we are good to go right now I will
02:36 - just add some permission plus X to that
02:41 - particular file that is zero four now we
02:44 - are obviously good to go
02:46 - oh
02:49 - I think something
02:52 - yeah so here you can see we have done
02:54 - some silly mistake like we don't have to
02:57 - keep the space here if we'll give a
02:59 - space then
03:02 - it will give you the error command not
03:04 - form
03:07 - okay again I think
03:11 - command substitution tutorial zero four
03:14 - line six
03:17 - or no such file or directory
03:22 - quieter manner you will need to do like
03:25 - this guys okay so let me just clear the
03:30 - screen
03:31 - yeah where your two here you can see
03:33 - that your present working directly this
03:35 - one oh my desktops are the scripting
03:37 - tutorial okay so in this way you can use
03:40 - this particular thing like uh okay
03:45 - so now the next method is how you can do
03:47 - it so the next method is like this I
03:49 - will just copy it and comment it uh the
03:52 - slang I mean this line and I will use
03:54 - this like this you have to you have to
03:57 - use the dollar and the
04:01 - PWD
04:03 - okay
04:04 - so now we can do like this
04:09 - clear the screen
04:11 - at the command and here you are good to
04:14 - go guys here you can see the uh
04:17 - isn't working directly okay now moving
04:20 - forward uh suppose you want to create
04:22 - one file uh so new file I will create
04:25 - the name a new file and I will use the
04:29 - back tick
04:32 - uh I will use this command cat I I need
04:36 - Hello dot txt suppose and discuss I want
04:40 - hello.txt
04:42 - so I will use this one like here and I
04:45 - will use Eco dollar new file
04:50 - Ctrl c not C Ctrl s to save clear the
04:54 - screen
04:55 - so here you can see hello.txt as we
04:57 - created and I will write
05:00 - Hello dot txt has been created from as
05:06 - we created
05:07 - from
05:09 - command substitution to tutorial
05:14 - okay due to real
05:17 - and told you to save okay so here you
05:20 - can see the same text okay so in this
05:24 - way you can use the command substitution
05:25 - technique like using a back take or
05:28 - using dollar or whatever the way you
05:29 - like okay but the most Pro preferred is
05:32 - this one dollar at the parenthesis okay
05:34 - so that's all for today's videos guys
05:37 - and if you have any query you can ask in
05:38 - the comment section and this course will
05:40 - be posted on the GitHub repository and
05:41 - you will get the link in the description
