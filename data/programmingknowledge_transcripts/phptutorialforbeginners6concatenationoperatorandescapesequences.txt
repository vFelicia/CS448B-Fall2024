00:01 - hello guys welcome once again in the
00:02 - last video I have shown you how to use
00:04 - variables in your PHP script and I have
00:08 - shown you how to use these double quotes
00:11 - and single quotes using this print
00:13 - function so I have shown you whenever
00:16 - you use this double codes and whenever
00:19 - you want to print your variable then you
00:22 - will be able to print this using double
00:24 - quotes because then this variable will
00:27 - be passed or pared
00:30 - uh whenever you use double Cotes on the
00:33 - other hand when you use single Cotes
00:36 - your variable inside your single code
00:39 - even if it has the same name as your
00:42 - variable will not be passed and it will
00:46 - print out
00:47 - literally okay so this I have shown you
00:51 - in the last video and the result of this
00:54 - was variable.
00:56 - PHP and I need to save this first and
01:01 - then in here you see the difference
01:04 - right so whenever you Echo using double
01:07 - codes and you use variable your variable
01:10 - inside your double code uh it will be
01:13 - passed and your variable value will be
01:16 - printed otherwise you will not be able
01:19 - to print this value but for example you
01:23 - want to print uh the value using single
01:28 - codes uh and you all want to use this uh
01:32 - uh variable using single codes what you
01:35 - can do here is you can just cut out this
01:39 - variable from here and you can use
01:41 - concatenation to print out your variable
01:45 - value so you can just write hello is
01:47 - equal to in single codes and then you
01:50 - need to give this full stop or Point
01:54 - symbol or period symbol whatever you say
01:58 - so you just give this
02:00 - point or uh this full stop here and give
02:03 - your variable name which is name and
02:06 - then once again give this full stop and
02:09 - whatever you write in this full stop
02:11 - will be so this is called concatenation
02:14 - symbol in PHP so this and this variable
02:19 - will be joined together and this will be
02:24 - the joining force in between your text
02:27 - and your variable so one once again when
02:30 - I save it and I refresh this it shows me
02:35 - some error because yeah I need to
02:42 - add I don't need this concatenation
02:46 - symbol here because I'm not adding any
02:49 - string after this name but yeah this
02:52 - concatenation symbol I need so this
02:56 - point or uh this period symbol or or
03:00 - this full stop symbol will add or
03:03 - concatenate these two strings like this
03:06 - okay so just remember that whenever you
03:09 - need to concatenate two string just use
03:12 - this and if you are not concatenating
03:16 - you will not need to use this here and
03:20 - once again save it and refresh and I can
03:23 - see the same results right now right so
03:27 - in this way you can use concatenation
03:30 - symbol or concatenate two
03:33 - strings now for example I want to uh use
03:38 - some HTML to print out some link or to
03:42 - uh open a link or to show a link in PHP
03:46 - so for example I have I want to do
03:49 - something like
03:50 - this Echo
03:53 - and in double quotes I want to
03:58 - do a okay so this is the tag for uh uh
04:03 - showing the link or reference so
04:09 - HRA if you know HTML you will know what
04:13 - I'm talking about and the name of the
04:17 - link for example
04:21 - www.
04:25 - google.com and then
04:27 - after your uh
04:30 - link name you just close this tag and
04:34 - then give your name which will be shown
04:37 - on on top of your link so for example
04:41 - Google and then you close this tag
04:46 - by this okay so this is a HTML code
04:50 - which I'm writing so if you don't know
04:52 - HTML code and how to print these links
04:55 - you can obviously go to my playlist and
04:58 - see the HTML tutorial or you can Google
05:01 - it it's easy to uh find how to uh print
05:05 - this okay
05:08 - so uh here what can I do is I can just
05:11 - give a concatenation symbol and then I
05:15 - can use those double quotes or single
05:19 - quotes and I can provide a break so that
05:23 - this link will start from the new line I
05:26 - will save it and when I refresh my
05:30 - it shows some error
05:34 - www so it will show an error why
05:39 - because your PHP code will think that
05:43 - this double code is ending here and this
05:48 - is some alien alien text for uh your PHP
05:52 - pars because your string is or you
05:56 - string is uh starting from this double
05:59 - quotes and are ending in this double
06:00 - codes and this will once again you need
06:04 - to concatenate or do something like this
06:06 - so instead of using this if you only use
06:11 - single codes here single codes and
06:14 - single codes and I forgot semicolon also
06:18 - and then see what
06:20 - happens I'll just
06:22 - refresh and I will be able to see my
06:26 - link here and when I click this I will
06:28 - be able to see hopefully Google no maybe
06:34 - I need to change this to
06:37 - http
06:38 - [Music]
06:40 - HTTP
06:43 - HTTP
06:45 - colon slash slash and then maybe my link
06:50 - will be recognized okay so I will
06:53 - just go once again and click this link
06:58 - and now my Google will open
07:01 - right
07:03 - so in this way you can if you want to
07:06 - use HTML tags inside your PHP script you
07:10 - can use single codes uh to print this
07:13 - right
07:15 - so I will make uh a convention or
07:19 - generally for me I have the convention
07:22 - that whenever I need to use this HTML
07:25 - tags I use single quods and whenever I
07:28 - want
07:29 - uh to use some variables or print out
07:32 - some variables I use these double ques
07:35 - here now for example I want to add this
07:40 - Google as a variable here for example I
07:44 - can uh do it something like this I can
07:46 - declare this and symbol and write Google
07:52 - is equal to and then I provide the
07:57 - name Google link for example and end it
08:03 - and I want to use this in here so I can
08:06 - use my concatenation operator which is
08:10 - two dots and in between you can give
08:14 - your um symbol like this but you also
08:18 - need to give the single code here and
08:21 - single code here to tell that this
08:24 - single codes end here then you
08:26 - concatenate your variable then once
08:28 - again your quotation is starting from
08:31 - here and ends here okay and once again
08:34 - when
08:35 - I run this it will show me Google link
08:39 - and when I click this Google will be
08:41 - open in my
08:43 - browser so in this way you can uh use
08:47 - this concatenation operator in your PHP
08:51 - one one more a little thing is for
08:55 - example I want to show some Escape
08:58 - characters or also so for example you
09:01 - want to print something like this uh in
09:04 - double codes you want to
09:06 - print
09:08 - hello world and you want to print it in
09:11 - double codes right inside double codes
09:15 - how can you do or how can you go about
09:17 - it so for example you do it something
09:20 - like this hello world it will not print
09:24 - hello world in double codes right so
09:27 - when I save it and when I run this it's
09:31 - not printing my Hello World in double
09:32 - codes right so what can I do here I'll
09:36 - just give a break so that it's my hell
09:39 - World start from the new line I can just
09:44 - use double quotes here but this will
09:46 - also not serve my purpose because this
09:49 - my PHP script will think that this will
09:51 - start from here and end from here so for
09:54 - uh showing your double code you use this
09:57 - Escape symbol not this but this one and
10:03 - in here also so whenever you want to
10:05 - print this double code here you
10:08 - initialize it with this
10:10 - escapes operator or Escape symbol and
10:14 - Escape symbol in PHP is this slash so it
10:17 - will print this like this
10:22 - so save it and once again run the
10:25 - program and now you will be able to see
10:26 - Hello World in double codes here
10:29 - right now for example you want to print
10:35 - something like
10:36 - this I have two single codes and I want
10:41 - to
10:43 - print
10:45 - uh
10:46 - it's a nice day for
10:51 - example yeah but this uh symbol is
10:55 - already reserved as a single quote here
10:58 - and to escape this what you can do
11:02 - is the same thing you you need to use
11:05 - this
11:07 - Escape symbol which is this one and once
11:10 - you save it your this single code symbol
11:15 - will be taken literally okay so when I
11:18 - just refresh it it says it's a nice day
11:22 - with this small symbol here
11:25 - okay so in this way you can use use this
11:29 - concatenation operator Escape symbol and
11:33 - uh HTML tag if you want to print the
11:36 - these like this so I hope you have
11:39 - enjoyed this video please wait comment
11:40 - and subscribe and bye for now
