00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Linux come online to troll for beginners
00:04 - and in this video we will see how we can
00:06 - use cal c'mon in Linux now Cal command
00:10 - can be used to display conventionally
00:13 - formatted calendar on your command line
00:16 - so let's see how we can use Cal c'mon
00:19 - so to use Cal c'mon you can just use Cal
00:23 - see Al and then press Enter
00:26 - it's going to show you the calendar kind
00:30 - of you know output here right and the
00:33 - date of making this video is for January
00:37 - 2017 for example right so this is the
00:42 - Cal command which is going to show you
00:44 - the current month and the date and the
00:47 - year ok but there are some flags which
00:50 - you can use with this Cal command
00:52 - so the first flag I am going to show you
00:56 - you can use with this command is
00:59 - actually it's not a flag but it's just a
01:02 - command you can just use an Cal and then
01:07 - press enter and now you can see the
01:11 - output in little bit different format so
01:13 - earlier your weekdays are at the top but
01:18 - right now the weekdays are on the left
01:21 - hand side right so an Cal command can be
01:24 - used to view the week days on the left
01:28 - and the Cal command can be used to view
01:31 - the V taste on the top ok so let me
01:36 - clear this terminal now the next flag
01:39 - which you can use with Cal command is
01:42 - the year so whatever here you want to
01:46 - see you can just enter the year number
01:50 - for example I want to see 2016 and then
01:54 - press enter is going to show all the
01:57 - months in 2016 year right in the
02:02 - formatted form so from January to the
02:05 - December is going to show you all the
02:08 - you know calendar month here ok let me
02:12 - clear the
02:13 - terminal again and now the next command
02:16 - or next flag which you can use with this
02:20 - Cal is for example you want to just view
02:23 - some month in a particular year so for
02:27 - example I want to see the February of
02:31 - 2014 for example so I can just give two
02:36 - for February February is the second
02:39 - month of the year if it's January you
02:42 - can write one March you can write three
02:44 - so for example for February I am writing
02:47 - to okay and then the year in which I
02:51 - want to see the month so 2014 for
02:54 - example and press enter and then it's
02:56 - just going to show that month which you
02:59 - have entered here not the whole calendar
03:01 - okay so this is also how you can use the
03:06 - Cal command now for example you can you
03:10 - know give the for example Cal minus
03:14 - three is going to give you the current
03:18 - month previous month and the next month
03:20 - okay so just press enter and you can see
03:25 - the current month is this one previous
03:27 - month and then the next month and by
03:31 - default the when you give Cal command by
03:34 - default this number is minus one and
03:37 - when you give this it's going to show
03:39 - you the current current month so there
03:42 - are many more flags which you can use
03:44 - with Cal command so I hope you enjoyed
