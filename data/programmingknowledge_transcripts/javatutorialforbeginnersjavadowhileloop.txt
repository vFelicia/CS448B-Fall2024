00:00 - hello welcome back guys to the another
00:01 - video of the Java tutorial Series so
00:03 - today we are learning the do while loop
00:06 - okay so what is do while loop in Java
00:08 - the do while loop is used to iterate a
00:11 - part of the program repeatedly until a
00:13 - specified condition is true if the
00:15 - number of iteration is not fixed and you
00:16 - must have to execute that loop at least
00:19 - once it is recommended that you should
00:22 - use a do while loop okay so it it the
00:26 - Dual Loop is also called as exit exit
00:28 - control Loop in Java so I will tell you
00:30 - whenever when we are going to code it I
00:33 - will tell you why it is called exit code
00:35 - exit control Loop okay so here here you
00:38 - can see the guys syntax do do is the
00:41 - keyword which is used and inside after
00:43 - that we will write the code which we
00:45 - have to execute inside the loop and the
00:48 - update statement should be there and
00:49 - after the ex end of the do block you
00:54 - will write one while and we will specify
00:56 - the condition okay
00:58 - so due to this uh it this is the loop in
01:01 - Java which will execute at least once
01:04 - whether the condition is executed as
01:06 - true or false okay I'll I will tell you
01:10 - exactly what what is it is so when we
01:12 - are going to code okay so first of all
01:14 - let let us check the flow of how why do
01:19 - why do while loop is Works in Java okay
01:21 - so first when the exam flow control flow
01:25 - comes inside this do while loop there is
01:28 - the statement inside it get executed at
01:31 - least once then the condition is check
01:32 - if that condition is true that statement
01:35 - is processed and again it ratio
01:37 - iterative iterative work should be there
01:39 - and if that condition it evaluates at
01:42 - false it will terminate that Loop okay
01:49 - okay so let's just get into our IDE and
01:54 - see how do while loop works okay so I
01:58 - will come here and I will right click
02:00 - here Java class I will create and I will
02:02 - write
02:05 - Loop
02:08 - sorry
02:11 - okay and I will increase some font size
02:13 - so that
02:15 - you guys can see it clearly main method
02:17 - is there
02:18 - so first of all I will take only only
02:20 - one simple do while loop okay uh I will
02:23 - declare one integer I is equals to one
02:27 - and inside again I will declare do while
02:30 - loop and inside do I will just simply
02:33 - print the value of I
02:36 - and after that according to our syntax
02:38 - we have to declare one expression here
02:41 - so my expression is I is less than
02:45 - equals to 10 okay
02:49 - so if I now click on run
02:58 - so here you can see one one one one is
03:02 - getting printed in finatively because I
03:05 - was I'm I have done one little mistake
03:07 - inside my code I have not written I plus
03:11 - plus that is my ielt value is not
03:13 - incrementing in this code that is that's
03:15 - why it gone into an infinite Loop
03:19 - okay let me just terminate this code
03:21 - stop all
03:23 - okay and now if I click on this run
03:28 - button now yeah now it's working fine it
03:31 - will print one two three four five six
03:34 - seven eight nine ten
03:35 - so you would ask me what is the main
03:37 - difference between while and do while
03:39 - because here also we are doing it the
03:41 - same okay so I will explain you by
03:45 - giving one example right
03:47 - so let me just comment it out first
03:50 - and now I will declare again one I
03:54 - variable that is equals to zero
03:56 - and I will declare one do
03:59 - so
04:01 - the statement that I am going to print
04:03 - is
04:04 - wait
04:07 - hello
04:08 - hello I'm hello is the string that I
04:10 - want to print
04:11 - and each time I'm doing I plus plus okay
04:16 - and the condition that I want to check
04:19 - is whether my I is less than 0 or not
04:24 - so what do you think guys let's check
04:27 - let us check if I run on click but run
04:30 - button okay so hello is going to print
04:33 - it on the screen at least once so you
04:36 - could ask me this this where I is less
04:40 - than zero this this could evaluated as
04:42 - false then why the loop is going to run
04:44 - so guys this is the main difference
04:46 - between a two while and while loop the
04:49 - the statement inside the do will always
04:52 - execute at least once it will execute
04:55 - then it will come and check whether my
04:58 - given expression is true or false so
05:01 - that's why once it it will print hello
05:03 - and in next time it will increment the
05:06 - value of I that is 1 so 1 is less than 0
05:09 - it is not obviously that's why it is
05:11 - terminating the loop now after painting
05:13 - the hello on the screen okay so I hope
05:16 - you guys have get some idea uh so what
05:19 - is do while loop and what is the main
05:20 - difference between a while and two while
05:22 - loop in Java okay so thank you guys for
05:24 - watching this video so in the upcoming
05:26 - video we will be talking some of the of
05:29 - few concept except which are left in the
05:32 - conditional statements okay that is
05:34 - break comment and
05:37 - few more are there it's okay so enough
05:39 - talking about this video we will be
05:41 - meeting in the next video okay so thank
05:43 - you bye
