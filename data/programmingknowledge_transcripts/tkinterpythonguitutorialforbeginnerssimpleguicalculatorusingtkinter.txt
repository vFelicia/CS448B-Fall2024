00:00 - hello guys and welcome to programming
00:01 - knowledge in the previous video or we
00:03 - learned about how to create a simple
00:05 - game that is tic-tac-toe in Python
00:07 - kinder module in this video we'll be
00:10 - seeing about how to how we can create a
00:13 - simple calculator within kinder so the
00:17 - procedure of building the application
00:20 - will be similar to that of tic-tac-toe
00:23 - I'll just show you the code and the
00:26 - certain portions of the code and so
00:29 - let's begin with the initials initially
00:32 - and so first of all we have to import
00:36 - kinto for in geometry i'm place it into
00:39 - a variable and so any title based on
00:42 - your preference you can also use
00:44 - different approaches to it and put a
00:48 - background words so i just run this much
00:51 - of code and show you is there any error
00:54 - or not so there is no error until now
00:59 - now going on forward we'll be using text
01:05 - in that is a string variable for the
01:09 - entry whatever we are going to fade
01:12 - within the entry that is for example in
01:15 - number + 2 or 4 + 4 divided by 2 or
01:20 - something like that we will be using
01:22 - that so text in is basically just a text
01:29 - input which we are providing into the
01:32 - entry field and a empty variable that is
01:36 - of operator variable now we'll be
01:39 - creating our first function that is the
01:42 - button flip function so just tell you
01:49 - what actually is happening within this
01:52 - function so click button with a
01:58 - parameter number so when we click a
02:01 - single of working for example 1 + 2 it
02:05 - is not a single button right 1 2 and the
02:07 - plus button is different so for this
02:10 - basically we are using lambda
02:12 - for each individual button when we will
02:15 - create the widget button I will show you
02:17 - in a minute and then if you want to show
02:21 - that in a format for example into the
02:25 - entry field one plus two so you need to
02:29 - show that input into that entry field
02:32 - for that we are using that function by
02:35 - taking the input from the user when the
02:38 - user clicks a button so it is just
02:41 - concatenating to no inputs given from
02:46 - the user that's it
02:48 - and placing and setting that into the
02:53 - operator so the operator here will hold
02:55 - that value so this is the click button
02:59 - function with the parameter number in
03:01 - general for whatever button is been
03:04 - clipped into that calculator or moving
03:07 - on to the next
03:10 - so for each evaluating operators for
03:16 - example button or sorry addition
03:18 - subtraction multiplication etcetera will
03:21 - be using individual functions so equals
03:27 - button here is basically used for
03:29 - evaluating whether determining and also
03:34 - determining what is that function it is
03:43 - so for example if the operator is
03:47 - performing or the user is performing
03:49 - some addition operation operation is
03:55 - being performed such as addition so the
03:58 - evaluation of evaluator that is an
04:00 - inbuild operator or uses in will
04:07 - procedure for determining that it is an
04:09 - addition operation so here operator will
04:13 - hold that addition operation so that is
04:18 - plus I'll just show you plus so you do
04:22 - not seem over here what is actually
04:23 - going on but it
04:25 - this pinko fine so for such individual
04:30 - operations there is an inducer function
04:35 - for example here this function is for
04:38 - addition right so the Evalia
04:40 - operator is in build within five items
04:42 - and you will determine what operation is
04:45 - being performed over there acid now
04:54 - similarly we will be creating it for
04:57 - subtraction division and multiplication
05:06 - and sub just let me check out a so it is
05:16 - fine now for multiplication and division
05:51 - now for division or multiplication or
05:57 - division okay okay so it is almost on
06:19 - and for this function is basically for
06:22 - clearing the entry field and sending it
06:24 - everything to zero so here just is a
06:35 - seee button or clearing then trickle
06:38 - I'll show you in a minute
06:41 - now the next is will be creating entry
06:46 - field and bunch of buttons nothing much
06:50 - just copy this down the procedure for
07:00 - each and every button is similar you
07:02 - just have to change to x and
07:04 - y-coordinates for placing the button
07:06 - based on your preference the division
07:10 - here and me okay so I'll just spin you
07:16 - what is actually going on so this is
07:25 - entry field where every input is been
07:29 - taken and this is the text where for
07:32 - taking the input from the user
07:36 - now each button here is carrying an
07:42 - individual function so for the function
07:44 - which we have created above that is the
07:47 - click button with a parameter number we
07:51 - are using tag or function for each and
07:54 - every button which we are create which
07:55 - we have created here for example we are
07:57 - using
07:57 - just the lambda similarly to that
08:00 - tic-tac-toe in so for each and every
08:03 - individual button that we are using
08:05 - click button with no so for example the
08:07 - user picks one entry field gets one as
08:12 - an input and cases gates on places gave
08:16 - that button over them so the procedure
08:20 - is same for each individual button you
08:22 - have 5 6 etc and 4 similarly for the
08:28 - operators as well addition
08:29 - multiplication subtraction and this
08:33 - button is for I see this function that
08:35 - is a command to you let me clear then
08:38 - click will basically nothing much and
08:40 - this equal button will produce the
08:43 - output so save and just run it and make
08:52 - sure we have done we have Morris yes we
08:56 - have others so this is the interface
08:59 - this is the interview this is the label
09:02 - which we have created at the initial and
09:05 - show you so this is the label calculator
09:14 - and we are packing it at the top so that
09:17 - is why this is the table is and trickly
09:19 - which we have waiting just above the
09:21 - first button and this other each
09:23 - individual numbers with the operators
09:26 - and the clear function that's it and
09:28 - that's here
09:29 - placing the working space on your
09:31 - preference is up to you you can place it
09:34 - anywhere and yeah and this is so some
09:38 - calculations 1 plus oh so this I just
09:43 - want to tell you that 1 plus 4 is
09:45 - basically been carried out within this
09:48 - function so we'll just basically Khon
09:52 - Kaen 1 + 1 + 4 into the entry fill and
09:56 - just show you that this is in written
09:58 - and with the help of equal button will
10:02 - get an output
10:05 - so okay we have some peridot here so
10:08 - what is the error do okay so let's try
10:38 - again
10:40 - okay so you have fire water and then
10:44 - tree filled and let's try clear this out
10:47 - so it is empty now 5-8 let's see some
10:53 - negative outputs yes we have that 2 into
10:58 - 3 9 okay 5 divided by 5 5 by 5 so we
11:11 - have an output here so basically it
11:14 - works so this is the calculator which we
11:18 - have created the approach is almost
11:19 - similar the widgets are almost the same
11:21 - is drawn everywhere when you create a
11:26 - widget the position of the button has
11:32 - been changed that's it and test is all
11:37 - the same so this is it for this video
11:42 - guys i'm swatching
