00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome back to
00:02 - programming knowledge and this is a
00:04 - video on how to create user login in PHP
00:07 - and this is related to the previous
00:10 - video series and how to create user
00:13 - registration form so in that tutorial we
00:16 - have discussed and learned how to create
00:20 - user registration form and we define its
00:24 - database so we're gonna be using the
00:28 - same database so the database name is
00:32 - user accounts and it has a table name
00:36 - users and the users has ID first name
00:42 - last name email phone number and
00:45 - password so the ID is auto increment and
00:49 - it has a it has the size of the lovin
00:52 - the first name is bar chart or bar card
00:56 - with 100 SD Len last name the same
01:01 - length and the same type email the same
01:04 - also phone number we have the bar chart
01:07 - work card 50 us length and password the
01:11 - same 50 as then so as I've said we're
01:15 - gonna be using the same database so you
01:19 - can go ahead and create your own
01:20 - database with user accounts and then
01:24 - users table okay and then all this
01:27 - attributes ID first name last name email
01:29 - phone number in password so we'll be
01:32 - learning how to create this particular
01:35 - login page and we're gonna be using the
01:41 - email and password for our login
01:45 - credentials and I will be showing you
01:48 - all the steps so that we could get up
01:52 - and running with this login page so for
01:57 - now let's create our new project so go
02:03 - to your local host directory and create
02:05 - a new folder and let's name it user
02:09 - login
02:12 - okay so we'll be defining few things or
02:16 - if you files here so we have the first
02:19 - file will be like in the page P then the
02:29 - second one will be config dot PHP and we
02:35 - also have the index dot PHP and also one
02:43 - for lock out that page okay and we'll be
02:52 - placing our images in IMG folder in CSS
02:59 - into CSS folder so open up login that
03:05 - PHP and let's define date HTML structure
03:08 - for this one so we have a basic
03:14 - structure of our login at page P and for
03:19 - the title let us say program knowledge
03:21 - [Music]
03:30 - okay we need to include bootstrap jQuery
03:36 - and font awesome in our project because
03:40 - we're gonna be using all those libraries
03:42 - to beautify our HTML structure because
03:46 - for now if we try to visit our page it's
03:49 - it's empty so let's go back to our
03:54 - browser and search for the booster CDN
04:02 - also jQuery CDN and also front also a
04:13 - click on this first link for bootstrap
04:17 - CDN so you have different files that we
04:20 - have or we have different files that can
04:22 - be included in our
04:24 - project so we have the complete CSS so
04:27 - click the copy and let's go back to our
04:33 - login dot PHP so link and of course
04:39 - paste the link that we have copied from
04:42 - the bootstrap CDN page okay and go back
04:49 - to our browser again we need to include
04:51 - the bootstrap minified that CSS it's a
04:54 - copy and go back to Kent or login dot
04:59 - PHP we need to make sure to include this
05:02 - at the bottom or before the closing body
05:06 - tag and for the SSRC paste the code that
05:14 - we have from the bootstraps idiot page
05:18 - again let's go back to our browser and
05:23 - let's click on this jQuery CDN and for
05:31 - now let's use this secret three point
05:34 - two point something version and click on
05:38 - this with minified and club b or copy
05:42 - this to fit board and go back to our
05:45 - code and then paste it about the
05:52 - bootstrap to mean that javascript okay
05:59 - so let's just make sure to properly
06:02 - format our code and the next one will be
06:07 - the font awesome okay click on the font
06:10 - awesome thing the first one and then
06:14 - start using free so we have here the
06:20 - link that we can include in our page so
06:24 - just click on this button okay and go
06:29 - back to our code and make sure to
06:34 - include this below
06:36 - read that CSS a and we need to define a
06:43 - container here so div with a glass
06:46 - container and of course another glass or
06:53 - its height as 100% it's a specific or
06:59 - stop signs and another div with the
07:08 - class T flex with another clip justify
07:17 - content sender and of course again the H
07:22 - 100 and another tip read the class of
07:30 - user underscore art and another div deep
07:40 - flex again with justify content center
07:47 - class deep fix and justify content
07:58 - centered and inside here will be the
08:03 - logo for our login page as you can see
08:09 - in our sample page here so we have here
08:15 - the logo so we will define the logo
08:19 - inside this div so that will be inside
08:24 - another dip switches with the class of
08:31 - brand underscore logo complainer then we
08:36 - will define our image here for the logo
08:42 - and let's on a glass for our logo which
08:47 - is brand logo and I'll text will be
08:54 - programming knowledge logo okay and for
09:02 - our logo I have created a very artistic
09:08 - I have some in my microwave abilities to
09:12 - create this very awesome logo for our
09:17 - legged page so you could create your own
09:21 - logo just make sure to make it circle so
09:25 - it will fit in our login form so go
09:30 - ahead
09:31 - so go ahead up and place your logo into
09:33 - or IMG folder in our project okay so
09:39 - make sure to paste this logo or your
09:45 - logo inside this IMG folder and for the
09:50 - source of our image let's type in IMG
09:55 - and of course the file name of our loan
09:57 - over just for my case IMG / logo dot PNG
10:02 - and so let's create a new CSS files so
10:07 - that we could target this class and also
10:10 - this class and we will define styles for
10:13 - this so link and for our reference it
10:21 - will be CSS and styles that CSS okay so
10:28 - we have to create this style that CSS
10:30 - inside our CSS folder so I create my new
10:34 - CSS file and save it inside the CSS
10:40 - folder this will be styles that CSS and
10:45 - let's star get the body in HTML so this
10:54 - will be margin
10:56 - zero cutting is zero hi hydrant height
11:07 - will be 100% in background color it will
11:14 - be 63 ABC 10 this should be back as
11:23 - important okay
11:26 - and another for a user card and also the
11:35 - brand logo container and another one for
11:41 - the local okay to save us from time and
11:48 - just paste and be the rules that applies
11:52 - to this classes and you can pause the
11:56 - video and copy all the classes that
11:58 - order lucid I'll be pasting in here so
12:05 - we have defined the height for our user
12:09 - card as 400 the way it will be 250
12:11 - pixels margin top auto margin bottom
12:15 - auto background will be f 3 9 0
12:19 - position:relative display flex justify
12:24 - content center flash flex direction
12:28 - column and so on all you have to do is
12:32 - post a video if you want to copy all
12:33 - this Styles applied to this user card
12:37 - class and for the brand underscore logo
12:45 - container we have the position as
12:47 - absolute high it will be 100 170 px and
12:51 - also the will top will be negative 25 px
12:56 - border ages 50 percent background will
12:58 - be 60 a3 BC and padding will be 10
13:02 - pixels text-align:center
13:04 - and for our logo will be 150px
13:09 - are pixels and with a hundred fifty
13:11 - pixels also very buttery just as 50% and
13:15 - border will be to excel so solid and
13:19 - white so we'll try to save and preview
13:24 - our page save our style that CSS and
13:28 - make sure also to save your login dot
13:30 - PHP and go back to our server browser
13:33 - and reload so I think the CSS rules are
13:41 - working so in this tutorial we'll
13:44 - continue working on with this login form
13:46 - and we will be adding different inputs
13:49 - so input for our username and input for
13:54 - our password so let's go ahead and open
13:58 - up our login that page become so let's
14:03 - pick up where we left off so this is
14:07 - where we ended last time we added our
14:10 - own logo for our sign-in form and let's
14:15 - go ahead another tip for this the class
14:20 - defects and let's add another class
14:25 - which is justify content center we'll be
14:29 - adding another one which is for
14:31 - container and we will add also styles
14:35 - for this for container later on ok so
14:38 - inside this div blips the point or for
14:41 - and of course inside this form let's
14:44 - define all the inputs so first let's
14:49 - create a div with input group of in and
14:57 - play this part and class of input root X
15:04 - [Music]
15:06 - inside this will be adding an icon which
15:08 - we will be using font awesome so I and
15:17 - then
15:19 - in class 3s and then F a user and right
15:27 - after this then let's add our input with
15:32 - the type text' name will be username and
15:39 - the ID will be horse username and also
15:45 - add class to this which has poor control
15:51 - in the user and this will be a required
15:56 - fill and before we forget let's rip this
16:02 - one into another div so two input input
16:13 - good okay and close this live here add
16:22 - class status which smb3 this is mainly
16:26 - related to good sir
16:30 - this in v3 this is for the spacing of
16:36 - our division or depth okay so we'll just
16:42 - Kapiti this input curve for our password
16:48 - also so input group this will be for the
16:54 - password our user so the name will be
16:59 - password ID password and also instead of
17:09 - input user it it should be input class
17:13 - [Music]
17:15 - and let's just change this into two and
17:21 - let's add another formula so do in the
17:26 - class form
17:30 - okay
17:32 - and then another live this will hold the
17:37 - remember me rotten if you're familiar
17:43 - with that custom checkbox okay one sec
17:53 - custom trackball CS so inside here let's
18:00 - type in the input type which is checkbox
18:06 - course and/or the name it will be or
18:11 - let's not add link to this but be good
18:17 - anyway let's just add me so remember me
18:22 - and the class will be custom control
18:31 - input and with the ID custom control
18:39 - custom control in line and let's just
18:44 - add label so with the class cost
18:51 - function bingo
18:57 - and inside here let's just I remember
19:04 - and of course this will be for our
19:10 - custom custom control in line which is
19:16 - this input checkbox so let's now add the
19:21 - button for our signee so after this div
19:27 - which is with the class for container
19:29 - let's add another one which is with the
19:34 - class D flex and let's add another class
19:39 - for this justify content contain
19:42 - content center in NP - three and it's
19:47 - just a class or custom class for this
19:50 - like entertainer and let's add another
19:55 - in a way which is a lot on its own so
20:01 - with a type button and with the name the
20:09 - name will be one and ID is again
20:19 - let's I've as to this which is V TN and
20:23 - then custom class like in ep N and the
20:31 - value or the displayed text will be
20:35 - lucky okay so the next step is to add
20:41 - the sign up button also or link again
20:48 - this is optional
20:49 - but further let's just add this to our
20:53 - four empty - 450 - 1 4 and inside this
21:08 - div let's define another div with class
21:14 - defects justify content center and
21:17 - [Music]
21:19 - another custom custom class which is
21:22 - links and inside this div let's just say
21:32 - don't have an account so class April 2
21:46 - and X would be signup
21:51 - so as I said this is only optional if
21:54 - you want to implement this signup you
21:56 - could put in the links and for example
22:02 - the link will be for example
22:05 - registration that page so you could put
22:08 - the link here and another day for forgot
22:17 - password defects in justify content
22:26 - center inside this then let's just
22:29 - define a link to present the password so
22:37 - forgot your password click that so now
22:41 - that we have added all the elements to
22:43 - our form
22:44 - let's try to preview our page in and see
22:49 - if it looks good in our browser so save
22:53 - our file login dot PHP and go back to
22:56 - our browser navigate to localhost and of
23:01 - course user lucky and the page that were
23:06 - concerned with is the login dot PHP so
23:11 - we have here the newly added elements we
23:15 - have the input remembering me option and
23:19 - we have the links for sign up and forgot
23:22 - password so as we can see they're not
23:25 - set yet or they're not looking good yet
23:29 - so we need to customize the CSS for our
23:34 - elements so let's go back to our file ok
23:40 - so one thing that I know this earlier is
23:44 - the they have the same icon which is the
23:47 - user
23:48 - font awesome user so instead of user for
23:51 - our password let's just type in the key
23:55 - so let's try that saver
23:58 - fine and you'll dr. browser and refresh
24:00 - so instead of these or icon this will be
24:04 - a newly added icon which is the key that
24:09 - signifies our password okay so let's
24:12 - just change this into type password
24:18 - instead of text let's say password okay
24:23 - now let's go to our Styles that CSS we
24:27 - have defined different or few classes
24:30 - here that we need to target in our CSS
24:34 - to make sure that our ligand form looks
24:37 - again you can pause the video and try to
24:41 - copy all the CSS styles that were going
24:44 - to define here so number one will be for
24:47 - container with margin top 100 px or
24:54 - higher pixels e dot e log in a p.m. will
25:00 - be with 100% background will be C zero
25:09 - three nine to be and tag this as
25:13 - important color will be white and this
25:19 - will be important so another one will be
25:24 - love II media focus box shadow will be
25:34 - done and tab this is important as well
25:38 - and the outline will be 0px in ten as
25:47 - well the log in to dinner
25:53 - we have padding:0 to REM and and
26:09 - vertex so background is zc0 p90 B or ten
26:24 - color will be light and mortar will be 0
26:35 - this will be identical order radius to
26:43 - your point
26:44 - little hi ru C are 0 0.25 REM and this
26:55 - will be important as well and then input
26:58 - user and put pass this is for our input
27:07 - in our legged form or username and
27:10 - password so focus box shadow will be men
27:19 - and this will be important as well and
27:22 - outline will be 0px and the last one
27:32 - will be custom checkbox weight custom
27:36 - input or control input input and check
27:45 - then custom control then label before it
27:55 - will be background color background
28:00 - color will be also the C's 0:39 to be
28:06 - fact it's as important as well so save
28:09 - our style that CSS and go back to your
28:12 - browser and refresh the page
28:17 - so as you can see we now have a
28:21 - nice-looking laggy for so in the
28:25 - previous tutorial we have added key
28:27 - elements and also added these styles of
28:30 - this login form so now let's do the
28:34 - quick fix for this login button
28:36 - extending way beyond the user and
28:39 - password elements so let's go back to
28:42 - our login that page become okay so here
28:47 - in our code I think we have mistyped the
28:52 - class for lock in container so instead
28:54 - of - let's make it an underscore so it
28:59 - would reflect or it will be the same
29:02 - with the flag and container that we have
29:04 - defined in our styles that CSS so go
29:07 - ahead save your file back in that PHP
29:11 - and go back to our browser and refresh
29:13 - so as you can see the login button is
29:16 - now aligned with the two elements or the
29:20 - username and password elements at the
29:23 - top so let's continue working on with
29:26 - this plugin form and work with our
29:29 - actual logic to allow the user to log in
29:32 - in this particular login form
29:35 - so before going any further let's try to
29:38 - move this form or the end form tag so we
29:44 - would include the login button so at the
29:48 - end of our hold just before right before
29:51 - the end body tag let's add another
29:54 - script to work with our login logic so
30:00 - inside here let's define the unload
30:05 - function of the jquery right let's try
30:11 - it
30:11 - frist if it's working or not so alert so
30:17 - same verify logging that PHP and go back
30:19 - to our browser refresh the page and we
30:22 - have the alert that's saying alert
30:26 - so next let's try to select our button
30:30 - so our button has the glass okay so if
30:36 - this button is good we will do some
30:43 - logic inside this function so let's try
30:51 - this first and let's try to see if this
30:55 - is working or not
30:56 - so login that PHP save and go back to
30:59 - our browser refresh and let's try let's
31:03 - try to click on this login button so
31:07 - it's working okay so let's remove this
31:14 - and let's define a new variable here
31:17 - which is valid let's just check if the
31:22 - validity of our forms is true so if the
31:28 - form is valid let's get the value of our
31:37 - username okay so target our username
31:42 - which is with the ID username and get
31:47 - the value same thing with our password
31:50 - so the same read password ID so the name
31:56 - of this variable will also be password
31:58 - and let's prevent the submission of this
32:04 - form because we're going to be doing the
32:08 - submission by using the Ajax call to a
32:12 - GS login dot PHP file so this part right
32:17 - here let's define the Ajax call ok so
32:24 - the type will be post ok and the URL
32:31 - will be GS GS
32:36 - that PHP and the date of course will be
32:42 - our username and password
32:45 - okay so username and plus in Duvalier
32:51 - username and password and the value
32:56 - password so if this is successful let's
33:05 - display alert first success and if it's
33:15 - not a success of course let's define
33:21 - also our display alert this will be ours
33:27 - or there were errors while was doing the
33:36 - operation let's just change this later
33:39 - okay same we're fine and go to jes login
33:44 - that PHP that's let's just try to echo
33:49 - something here so hello from GS plug-in
33:54 - that HP we save J is lagging at PHP and
34:00 - go back to our browser refresh and click
34:04 - on this login button so I think we have
34:09 - learned so let's try to turtle so
34:12 - accordingly type our e.preventdefault
34:15 - is not a function let's try to
34:19 - troubleshoot the problem so accordingly
34:23 - we prevent that default is not a
34:27 - function because we miss the t letter it
34:31 - there so same logging that PHP and go
34:35 - back to our browser again refresh and
34:38 - click on the login button so accordingly
34:41 - accordingly it was a success the next
34:45 - step is we're going to work with our
34:46 - config that PHP to actually connect
34:50 - our code to database or MySQL database
34:53 - so config that PHP let's open the page
34:58 - without here and define your variables
35:00 - so that we could connect to our database
35:03 - so the user for my case is root the
35:08 - password is empty and the database name
35:14 - as we have defined earlier is the user
35:18 - accounts okay
35:22 - let us connect to our database with the
35:25 - video so inside here let's type in MySQL
35:32 - cause it was localhost and our giving
35:36 - name will be equals that TB named
35:44 - variables that we have defined a data
35:48 - semicolon and the character set for this
35:52 - will be utf-8 and force need to pass in
36:00 - the user and the password password yes
36:09 - and let's just set a single attribute
36:13 - for this video object set attribute will
36:17 - be for video attribute our mode and of
36:28 - course video on column in error mode
36:35 - will be returned exception whenever
36:39 - there's an error okay so once we have
36:44 - that we could include this to our genius
36:48 - login dot PHP so here because I've been
36:53 - required once the config that PHP and
36:59 - let's try to
37:01 - let's try to use our video object so
37:08 - select all from users for now and and
37:16 - define a statement the empty select of
37:22 - course using the video object prepared
37:29 - and of course the SQL so the result will
37:35 - be denied and then execute let's just
37:43 - pass in a an empty array and if result a
37:50 - result result yes
37:57 - echo success okay else there were errors
38:09 - there were errors while connecting to
38:17 - database Hey so see me comment and let's
38:23 - go back to our login dot PHP so instead
38:25 - of success let's alert the data coming
38:29 - from the GS login dot PHP so lucky in
38:32 - that PHP save and go back to our browser
38:34 - refresh and type in something and click
38:39 - on login so we have an error there
38:43 - accordingly and defined class constant
38:45 - error mode because we have mistyped this
38:52 - error mode exception
38:56 - so instead of error mode with on the all
39:03 - the letters type in so let's just make
39:07 - it e our arm movement so save the config
39:11 - that page we find in refresh our page
39:15 - and click on the login button so we know
39:20 - from GS login that PHP so hurting ly it
39:24 - was a success
39:25 - so in our genius lagging at page P file
39:28 - instead of success so let's define a new
39:33 - variable that we hold all the data
39:36 - coming from the database so fetch and
39:41 - then video fetch associative array and
39:48 - then let's just bar them the user
39:52 - variable for now and save the file go
39:56 - back to our browser refresh the page and
40:00 - type in somebody's and click on lucky so
40:05 - we have the record with the first name
40:07 - Jane and the last name doe with Jane Doe
40:12 - gmail.com as the email and phone number
40:16 - s there also class where it is Jane Doe
40:20 - so it's working okay so instead of
40:24 - selecting all users
40:25 - we need to filter out with the username
40:30 - and password but we're going to use the
40:34 - email app username for now and the
40:38 - password password equals a make one so
40:47 - user name this will be the values coming
40:51 - from our login form oops
40:56 - which is username and the same with our
40:59 - password it is just passing in the
41:01 - password
41:04 - hey bastard so instead of passing an
41:10 - m-theory
41:12 - let's pass in the username and the
41:17 - password and define an if statement
41:23 - statement or SD NP select row count is
41:28 - greater than zero meaning we have a
41:33 - success we found the user in our
41:38 - database else there is no user for that
41:48 - combo or something
41:51 - combo enclose our statement instead of
41:56 - success let's just echo a value one and
42:00 - we'll check here in our login dot PHP if
42:04 - the value is 1 if the response is with
42:11 - the value 1 so you need to trim the data
42:17 - coming from our Jes login dot PHP and
42:21 - test check a if it is equal to 1 and
42:27 - let's redirect our user said I am out
42:37 - we know that location feature equals the
42:48 - index with tobacco index dot PHP and set
42:55 - the delay for about two seconds right
43:00 - save or lag in that PHP and let's go
43:04 - back to our genius lagging at PHP so we
43:07 - have here line number four echo hello
43:11 - from JJ as lock it up in PHP we need to
43:15 - remove this so say J is lagging that PHP
43:22 - and go back to our browser refresh so
43:28 - for example you have Jane Doe at
43:31 - gmail.com in your database and you just
43:34 - need to type in the password and then
43:38 - click on this login button so we have
43:42 - the value coming from OJ's login dot PHP
43:45 - as number one
43:48 - it signifies that we found a user in our
43:51 - database bed with the combination that
43:54 - we entered in the field username and the
43:59 - password so ok and wait for a few
44:03 - seconds so it's redirected to our index
44:06 - dot PHP but for now if we try to click
44:11 - on this back button we could see again
44:15 - the login that page before which means
44:18 - that we need to set the session so that
44:21 - every time we try to log in with our
44:23 - username and password if we are
44:26 - authenticated then we can stay for it
44:29 - for that particular page or we can stay
44:32 - in that index dot PHP instead of lugging
44:35 - that page where every time sewing or
44:39 - jeaious login dot PHP we need to set the
44:42 - session or start the session so session
44:47 - and then start and inside the statement
44:51 - we need to set our session variable and
44:55 - let's pass in our index which will be
45:00 - user login and then let's pass in the
45:08 - user values which is the era coming from
45:11 - our database or the associative array we
45:16 - got from our database so save this and
45:22 - inside the login dot PHP we need to
45:25 - check at the dot so let's open up the
45:30 - page here it goes and let's check a the
45:38 - session with session user liking is set
45:49 - and on header location index dot PHP
46:03 - same and let's copy and paste this one
46:10 - so in our index net page we could also
46:12 - check if the session user login is not
46:18 - set redirect to login dot PHP so we'll
46:24 - just add a element here welcome to index
46:32 - save index dot PHP and go back to your
46:36 - browser refresh and type in your
46:42 - username and password click on login so
46:48 - the user is found on ok so we're not
46:58 - redirected to index that page B
47:01 - that's because we need to add one line
47:03 - to our files
47:06 - so inside log in that page we need also
47:09 - to set a session or start the session
47:12 - because we're using the session variable
47:14 - below and make sure to copy and paste
47:18 - these also to index dot PHP because
47:22 - again we're using a session variable
47:24 - here so index at PHP saved and lagging
47:28 - that PHP save so refresh our page we are
47:36 - automatically redirected to our index
47:39 - dot PHP we won't be able to go to our
47:42 - like in PHP file because the session is
47:46 - set so it's checking if the session is
47:51 - set then stay in index dot PHP otherwise
47:55 - go to login dot PHP there is one more
47:59 - thing that we need here we need a link
48:02 - for us to log out in index dot PHP so
48:05 - let's go back to index dot PHP so we're
48:11 - just going to add the link here and this
48:16 - should be indexed at PHP and not out
48:20 - equals to true and type in black out
48:26 - okay save in here we need to check if
48:31 - the logout variable is set so if is set
48:38 - get the log out so we need to destroy
48:48 - the session so session destroy and unset
48:59 - the session redirect to our login that
49:09 - page pin
49:15 - hey save our file index dot PHP and
49:19 - let's go back to our browser and refresh
49:21 - so we have here the log out link so
49:24 - let's click on this we have successfully
49:27 - leg out from index dot PHP so we'll try
49:31 - to log in again in index.php by typing
49:35 - in or username and password using or
49:39 - evening so transfer it and then plug in
49:44 - one so we are now at the index dot PHP
49:50 - okay so I think that's all there is to
49:53 - it in this tutorial thanks
50:03 - you
