00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - HTML tutorial for beginners using html5
00:05 - in this video we will learn about
00:07 - paragraphs headings pre formatted text
00:10 - and HTML text formatting tags in HTML so
00:16 - let's get started we have already
00:17 - learned how to use paragraph tag in HTML
00:20 - in our previous videos like this right
00:24 - and when you want to add the multiple
00:27 - paragraph you just need to add them like
00:31 - this and when you save your code and
00:34 - refresh your page look like this now
00:39 - each paragraph element is separated by
00:43 - other element by the line break of two
00:46 - right now for example you want to break
00:51 - this paragraph in two lines what you can
00:54 - do is you can add this tag called BR and
01:00 - it will break your line into two so save
01:04 - your code and refresh it and it breaks
01:07 - this paragraph into lines but you can
01:11 - see there is no line space in between
01:15 - these two lines
01:16 - but this paragraph and this paragraph is
01:19 - separated by one line space here right
01:23 - so in this way you can add multiple
01:25 - paragraphs and breaks in HTML now let's
01:29 - talk about heading tags in HTML so there
01:32 - are basically six type of headings you
01:35 - can use in HTML and which are like this
01:39 - so the biggest heading you can use is h1
01:43 - and the smallest heading you can use is
01:46 - h6 so h1 is the biggest font size and h6
01:52 - is the smallest font size and when you
01:55 - go to H 2 s 3 S 4 and at 5 it will
02:00 - decrease your font size when this
02:03 - heading tag number increases so save
02:06 - your code and refresh your web page and
02:08 - you can see the heading 1 or h1 tag
02:13 - creates the biggest heading and that six
02:16 - tag creates the smallest heading now
02:19 - let's talk about pre formatted text tag
02:23 - so you can use a tag like this for pre
02:29 - formatted tags this means the spaces and
02:32 - your line breaks are preserved whenever
02:36 - you add some text in between these pre
02:39 - tags so for example you want to display
02:42 - some code something like this I have
02:44 - this C hello world code and I want to
02:47 - preserve these spaces between the code
02:51 - and the line breaks so I can do
02:53 - something like this so I can save it and
02:55 - I can refresh my webpage and it will
02:58 - look like this it will look like a code
03:00 - but if you use a paragraph tag here see
03:06 - what happens it will not preserves your
03:09 - line breaks or spaces and it will show
03:13 - you in the straight lines so if you want
03:15 - to preserve the line breaks and the
03:17 - spaces you can use pre tags something
03:21 - like this okay now let's talk about HTML
03:26 - text formatting tags or elements so
03:30 - basically there are ten text formatting
03:33 - elements in HTML which are bold tag
03:38 - emphasized tag italic tag small strong
03:43 - sub sub for sub scripted tags and su P
03:48 - for a super scripted tag I ns4 inserted
03:52 - tag de l for deleted text and mark for
03:57 - mark text now let's see how we can use
04:01 - them and how they look like when you use
04:04 - them so I will delete this and I will
04:08 - add all these tags so you can use these
04:12 - tags for example bold tag or emphasize
04:16 - tag inside your headings or your
04:20 - paragraph tags or any other tags like
04:24 - lists and tables which P
04:26 - we'll learn in the later videos right so
04:29 - for example you want to show a paragraph
04:31 - with bold text then you can use this
04:34 - bold tag something like this so just add
04:37 - this bold tag here and bold ending tag
04:40 - here it will be bold okay
04:44 - so similarly you can use eeehm tag or
04:47 - emphasized tag like this to emphasize
04:51 - your text for italic you can use I for
04:54 - strong you can use strong itself for
04:59 - small text you can use small tags
05:02 - something like this for deleted text you
05:05 - can use de el and deleted means it will
05:08 - give you a cross or it will give you a
05:11 - line on your text right you can use a NS
05:16 - for inserted text you can use sub for
05:19 - super scripted text marks for marked
05:22 - text and su P for superscripted text now
05:27 - let's see how they look like when we see
05:31 - em on the web webpage so refresh the
05:33 - page and this is our bold text
05:37 - emphasized text italic text this is our
05:41 - strong text and this is our small text
05:45 - this is our deleted text which you know
05:49 - gives you this line on your text this is
05:52 - our inserted text which will give you
05:54 - this line on the bottom of the text this
05:58 - is the superscripted tag something like
06:02 - little bit below the normal text this is
06:04 - our marked text and it will give you
06:07 - this yellow mark on your text and this
06:10 - is our super scripted text which is a
06:13 - little bit above from our normal text so
06:17 - in this way you can use paragraphs
06:19 - breaks headings and text formatting
06:22 - elements in HTML I hope you enjoyed this
