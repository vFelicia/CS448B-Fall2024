00:01 - hello guys welcome once again in the
00:03 - last video we have seen how to use a
00:06 - Weare clause in
00:07 - your queries in this video we will see
00:11 - how to use
00:13 - and and or operator with your
00:20 - queries
00:21 - so we have this
00:24 - table as we have made previously for
00:27 - employee ID name surname and
00:31 - age
00:34 - so last time we have
00:36 - seen how to use this where Clause so I
00:41 - have written the statement
00:45 - select star from database do table name
00:50 - where so suppose in this
00:55 - table you want to
00:58 - use
01:00 - or you want to
01:02 - see the employee information where the
01:07 - name of the employee is Mark and surname
01:12 - of the employee is
01:14 - Dell so how we can see that we will see
01:19 - it here so WR select start from
01:25 - database. table
01:27 - where name
01:31 - and
01:34 - then single quotes and write the name
01:44 - Mark
01:47 - and
01:49 - surname is equal
01:52 - to single code what was count
01:58 - Del
02:04 - okay and in between you will
02:10 - write
02:15 - R so
02:17 - write select star from database
02:22 - dot the table where name is equal to
02:25 - Mark or your surname is d
02:30 - so let's execute this query yes it shows
02:35 - me the values where Mark is Mark
02:38 - information is there or D information is
02:44 - there
02:46 - okay but
02:49 - suppose in your database we will add one
02:53 - more employ whose name is
02:57 - Mark as same as
03:00 - this but he his surname is
03:05 - different whatever and his age is also
03:10 - different I will apply
03:12 - it
03:14 - okay and you want to
03:17 - see the information of the employee
03:20 - where name is equal to mark but you will
03:25 - see two marks are there and you just
03:28 - want to see the information of Mark Bell
03:31 - so what you will write
03:34 - is Select star from database do table
03:38 - name where name is equal to
03:41 - Mark and instead of R you will
03:45 - write
03:48 - and soame is equal to
03:52 - Bell
03:53 - and let's execute this query yes it
03:57 - shows only work one Mark
04:00 - information where my name is equal to
04:04 - Mark and Sur name is equal to
04:08 - Bell so in this way you can use end and
04:14 - or Clause with your
04:18 - queries and this
04:20 - query you can write in your software and
04:25 - extract this
04:26 - information so that's it for this video
04:30 - please rate comment and subscribe and
04:32 - bye for now
