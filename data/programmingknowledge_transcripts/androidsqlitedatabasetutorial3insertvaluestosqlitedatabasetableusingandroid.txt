00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:03 - Android escolite database tutorial for
00:06 - beginners in the last video we have seen
00:09 - how we can create a database which is a
00:12 - escal database using Android now in this
00:16 - video we are going to see how we can
00:18 - insert some data into our table inside
00:22 - that sqlite data
00:24 - base so let's get started first of all
00:28 - go to your uh activity main.xml file and
00:31 - go to the
00:33 - design tab there in the last video we
00:36 - have created this blank activity right
00:39 - so go to that activity and then we are
00:42 - going to uh drag and drop some uh text
00:46 - views here and addit texts here so that
00:49 - we can use them to insert some data so
00:53 - what I'm going to do is I'm going to
00:54 - drag three large text
00:57 - here and three plain text
01:02 - and now we are going to change these
01:04 - large text uh label as the column names
01:09 - of our table so first is name second is
01:12 - surname and third is
01:24 - marks if you want you can change the ID
01:28 - names of these uh text text views and
01:31 - added text also so for example this is
01:35 - for text view for
01:46 - name now you may be thinking that we
01:49 - have four columns in our table first is
01:52 - ID second is name third is surname and
01:55 - fourth is Mark but we have taken only
01:58 - three uh you know three variables here
02:01 - or three text views where is ID text
02:05 - field and addit uh
02:07 - text if you remember we have defined ID
02:11 - as Auto increment so it will uh
02:14 - increment automatically when you insert
02:16 - some data inside your table so we don't
02:20 - need to um add this ID specifically okay
02:26 - now what we are going to do is we are
02:27 - going to take a button and we are going
02:30 - to change the textt to add data and we
02:36 - are going to check change the ID to
02:40 - button add for example okay and that's
02:45 - it for the design part now what we are
02:49 - going to do is if you remember in the
02:50 - last video we have uh created a class
02:54 - for handling our database and the class
02:57 - name was database helper class CL so go
03:00 - to that class this was the code which we
03:04 - have written in the last video and now
03:08 - just go below and now we are going to
03:12 - create a new method to insert data so
03:17 - let's create this method this will be
03:19 - the public method and it's going to
03:22 - return
03:24 - Boolean and we will name our method
03:28 - as insert data for example and we are
03:32 - going to add three arguments to this
03:35 - method first is for name second is for
03:38 - surname and third is for Marks right so
03:42 - let's
03:47 - add now once this is done what we are
03:50 - going to do is first of all we are going
03:52 - to create uh the instance of escolite
03:56 - database but if you remember last time
03:59 - we have added in the Constructor of this
04:01 - database helper this extra line so that
04:04 - we can see the
04:08 - database created okay so now it's a time
04:13 - to remove this line so just cut it from
04:16 - here and the Constructor will be like
04:19 - this okay so just remove that extra line
04:22 - and you can paste the same line here
04:25 - because we are going to create use this
04:27 - uh sqi database inste
04:30 - in our insert data method okay so just
04:34 - paste it here now the second thing which
04:38 - we need here is the instance of a class
04:43 - called content value so just write
04:46 - content
04:48 - value and the variable name is equal to
04:52 - new content value just press Alt Enter
04:57 - to import the required classes
05:01 - and now we are going to take this
05:03 - content value instance and we are going
05:06 - to put some data into the columns so
05:09 - just write content value do put and it
05:14 - takes two argument first is the column
05:17 - name in which you want to insert data
05:20 - and second is the value itself so our
05:24 - column name First Column name for name
05:26 - was column two you can see here so
05:30 - column 2 comma the value which we are
05:33 - going to pass so this is the value which
05:36 - we are going to pass here okay in the
05:39 - same way we will do the same for column
05:43 - three or the Sur name column and the
05:47 - marks column right and this will
05:52 - correspond to the value soame and marks
05:56 - value okay now once this is done we we
05:59 - can just insert our data using this DB
06:04 - instance DB dot
06:08 - insert and this
06:10 - takes three
06:13 - arguments first is the table name so our
06:17 - table name is this variable so copy this
06:20 - and pass it here second is uh
06:24 - null and third is our content values
06:29 - okay
06:30 - which we have created okay now how can
06:34 - we know that the values are really
06:38 - inserted into the table or not okay so
06:42 - what we can do is this insert method you
06:45 - can control and just click this method
06:49 - and you can see here in case of error
06:52 - this method returns
06:55 - minus1 and if it's successful this
06:58 - method return the inserted row value
07:02 - okay so if the data is not inserted this
07:06 - method is going to return minus1 to us
07:10 - so what we can do we can Define long and
07:13 - then result is equal to the result
07:18 - because this insert Returns the result
07:22 - as minus1 or the inserted value and then
07:26 - we can return this if we can check if
07:29 - this uh value is minus1 so if result is
07:35 - equal to
07:37 - minus1 is equal to minus1 then we are
07:41 - going to return false else we are going
07:43 - to return true now once this method is
07:47 - created we can uh just go to our main
07:51 - activity. Java file here and in here we
07:56 - can Define three addit
07:59 - text variables because we have created
08:02 - in our design edit text so we are going
08:04 - to create three variables for edit text
08:08 - and one variable for our button
08:22 - okay once these three variables are
08:26 - created what we are going to do is
08:28 - inside our on creat method we are going
08:29 - to cast all these four variables three
08:33 - uh edit text and one
08:46 - button now once our casting is done we
08:50 - can use this uh button add data variable
08:53 - to call some action right so what we are
08:57 - going to do we are going to create cre a
09:00 - method
09:02 - public
09:04 - wide add data and inside this method we
09:09 - can uh take this button add variable and
09:12 - call set on click method so set onclick
09:16 - method and in here new
09:21 - onclick listener now inside this on
09:24 - click method what we can do is we can
09:27 - call our insert the data method
09:32 - here using the instance of this data
09:36 - helper class so in the last video we
09:40 - have created this instance my data so
09:43 - just take this dot insert data now as an
09:48 - argument for this insert data we uh need
09:52 - three uh arguments right so we can see
09:56 - it needs three arguments first is name
09:58 - value second is surname value and third
10:00 - is Mark value right so we will go to the
10:03 - main activity and in for this insert
10:06 - data what we can do is we can take the
10:09 - value from addit text so just take the
10:12 - first addit text which is addit name dot
10:17 - get
10:18 - text Dot two string okay the second
10:24 - value will be added
10:28 - surname dot get text Dot two string and
10:34 - the third argument will be addit
10:39 - Mark dot get text Dot two string and
10:46 - don't forget to close
10:48 - this and once is it is successful what
10:52 - we can do is we can check if it's
10:54 - successful or Not by declaring a Boolean
10:58 - variable aable so
11:02 - bu
11:04 - is inserted is equal to right because
11:08 - this insert data method return Boolean
11:11 - value we have made this uh method to
11:13 - return Boolean value if the data is
11:16 - inserted it's going to return true
11:18 - otherwise false so
11:22 - if this is true that means data is
11:27 - inserted right so we we can just display
11:30 - some uh
11:43 - message otherwise if it returns false
11:46 - then we can print the negative
11:52 - message now our code for inserting data
11:55 - is done one thing which is remaining is
11:59 - just call this method inside the
12:02 - oncreate method of your uh main activity
12:06 - so that this method will be called
12:08 - whenever we click this uh add data
12:12 - button okay and now we are going to run
12:15 - our program so now our app is running
12:18 - and you can see three addit text so we
12:20 - are going to add some name or name and
12:27 - Mark and once our data is inserted we
12:31 - can click this add data button and this
12:34 - is going to show the message if it's
12:36 - inserted or not so click
12:39 - this and it says data inserted right now
12:42 - in the last video I've shown you uh the
12:45 - trick how you can check whether it's
12:47 - really inserted or not using this uh
12:50 - Android device monitor I'm not going to
12:53 - show you how you can do it once again
12:56 - but just uh follow the trick as we have
12:59 - done in the last video and you will be
13:03 - able to see the data so I'm going
13:05 - to go to my database and I'm going to
13:10 - save this database to my local
13:14 - PC and now I can see this database using
13:17 - the escolite manager as I have shown you
13:21 - in the last
13:22 - video and now you can see this uh data
13:25 - is inserted in our database
13:30 - right so in this way you can insert data
13:34 - into your database using
13:37 - Android I hope you have enjoyed this
13:39 - video in the next video we are going to
13:41 - see how we can display this data because
13:43 - it's uh not convenient to go every time
13:46 - to the database and see it in the esite
13:49 - manager so we are going to create some
13:51 - code to display the data using some
13:55 - button so that's it for this video I
13:57 - hope you enjoyed this video please rate
13:59 - comment and subscribe and bye for now
