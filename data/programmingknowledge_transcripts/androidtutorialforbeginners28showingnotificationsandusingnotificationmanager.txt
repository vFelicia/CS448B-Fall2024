00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Android app development for
00:04 - beginners in this video we will see how
00:06 - to use notification manager in Android
00:10 - so for example I have uh this running
00:12 - app and I'm going to show you how this
00:15 - will work and then we are going to see
00:17 - how we can write the code so for example
00:20 - this is my app which is running and this
00:22 - has only one button which says notify me
00:25 - and when I click this button it's going
00:27 - to give me um notification something
00:30 - like this and when I drag this down I
00:33 - can see this notification which has some
00:36 - content title notification content and
00:39 - some extra features which we are going
00:41 - to see so this kind of notification how
00:46 - we can uh you know initiate these kind
00:48 - of notification in Android let's see so
00:52 - first of all I have this blank project
00:55 - and as you may have guessed we are going
00:57 - to use a button here and I'm going to
01:01 - change the button uh text
01:04 - as notify me okay and the button ID I'm
01:10 - going to leave it as default which is
01:11 - button and now I'm going to go to my
01:14 - main activity. Java file so in here I'm
01:19 - going to declare a button variable
01:23 - so button BTN for example and I will
01:28 - give Alt Enter ENT to include the button
01:32 - Imports and now I will take this uh
01:34 - button variable and I'm going to cast it
01:37 - inside my on create method so button is
01:41 - equal
01:47 - to now after casting uh this button we
01:50 - can use this uh button object and we can
01:53 - call set on click method on it so button
01:58 - dot set on click listener and inside the
02:02 - set on click listener we are going to
02:04 - call new onclick
02:07 - listener and inside this onclick method
02:10 - first of all I'm going to create an
02:12 - object of intent so intent intent object
02:17 - name is equal to new now I'm going to
02:20 - create a object of pending intent here
02:25 - and I'm going to tell you what pending
02:26 - intent is in a second but let me create
02:29 - this op object pending intent is equal
02:31 - to and then take this pending intent and
02:35 - then call get
02:38 - activity and the first argument which it
02:41 - takes is the activity itself so main
02:45 - activity here dot this and the second in
02:49 - uh argument is zero third argument is
02:53 - your
02:54 - intent and the fourth argument is zero
02:58 - okay now what this pending intent does
03:02 - so this pending intent is a token that
03:05 - you can give to another application for
03:07 - example notification manager which we
03:09 - are going to use in our case and this
03:14 - will allow uh this application to use
03:17 - the permission of your application to
03:20 - execute a pre defined piece of code okay
03:24 - so that's why we use uh pending intent
03:27 - here now I'm going to create my uh
03:30 - notification object so
03:33 - notification and I'm going to include my
03:36 - import and I will name it as noty for
03:40 - example is equal to new
03:44 - notification dot Builder and this
03:48 - Builder will take the context so I'm
03:50 - going to just copy this main activity.
03:53 - this and then you can add some attribute
03:57 - to this object for example the
04:00 - do set ticker and this is your ticker
04:06 - name for
04:08 - example
04:10 - ticker title okay and then you can uh
04:15 - set some more properties like
04:19 - set
04:21 - content title and set content text so
04:25 - for example set content title for
04:28 - example and this is my content
04:33 - title and then I'm going to add dot
04:38 - set content
04:42 - text and this is the text for your
04:45 - content okay so for example the content
04:49 - text and I can add as many text as I
04:53 - want something like this and this this
04:56 - will be the text which will appear here
04:59 - here so when I drag this and this is my
05:03 - notification content okay so after this
05:09 - we want to add a icon for example so we
05:12 - will uh we can add a icon like this dot
05:16 - set small
05:19 - icon and this icon you can take it from
05:23 - uh your
05:24 - drawable so you can go to your Rees
05:28 - folder and in here you have your
05:30 - drawable folder and in here you have
05:33 - some default pictures if you want you
05:36 - can add your own custom picture for your
05:38 - notification but for now I'm using the
05:42 - default pictures okay so you can drag
05:45 - and drop your picture here and use it uh
05:47 - if you want but uh for Now the default
05:51 - picture will be okay so in here
05:54 - r. drawable
05:57 - dot IC
06:00 - launcher okay this is my default picture
06:03 - name and then at the last you can add
06:08 - the content so dot
06:12 - set content and we will pass our P
06:17 - intent here and then we will call get
06:21 - notification on this notification object
06:25 - okay and here I think it should be set
06:28 - content in intent because we are passing
06:31 - intent here right so just change it to
06:34 - set content intent and pass your pending
06:37 - intent here and in the next line we can
06:41 - add some Flags to our notifications so
06:44 - for example noty do
06:47 - Flags is equal to
06:52 - notification dot these are all the flags
06:56 - which uh we can uh add here but but uh
07:00 - the flag we want
07:03 - is this flag autoc cancel okay so this
07:08 - flag whenever we click the notification
07:10 - it will cancel our notification okay now
07:15 - in the next line we will declare a
07:18 - notification manager object so just
07:21 - write notification manager I'm going to
07:23 - name it as NM is equal to and we are
07:27 - going to cast notification manager and
07:29 - then we will get services so
07:33 - get system service and in here we want
07:38 - to call notification service okay and
07:42 - then we are going to take our
07:44 - notification manager and then we will
07:47 - call a notify method on it so just take
07:50 - your notification manager object dot
07:55 - notify and first argument will be zero
07:59 - and second argument is your notification
08:02 - object which is noty in our case Okay so
08:06 - this will be the code to uh generate
08:10 - notification on button click so let's
08:13 - run our program and let's see what
08:14 - happens so I'm going to run my program
08:17 - so now my program is running so when I
08:19 - click this notify me button it's going
08:23 - to give me the second not notification
08:25 - first notification is from the earlier
08:28 - app so when I drag this I can see this
08:31 - content title which is this one and then
08:35 - the content text which I have entered
08:37 - some random text here and when I click
08:41 - this this notification is gone okay now
08:45 - in order to add some more uh features to
08:48 - your notifications something like these
08:50 - icons and some more content or some more
08:53 - actions what we need to do is let's go
08:57 - to our code here and in here here in
09:00 - your code after this set small icon you
09:03 - can call some more method like dot add
09:08 - action and first argument it takes is
09:12 - the icon if you want to give any so I'm
09:14 - going to give the default icon second
09:17 - argument is the text for
09:20 - example action one and the third
09:25 - argument is your pending content uh
09:28 - object so this one okay in the same way
09:32 - you can add as many uh actions as you
09:37 - want just paste it below this and add
09:41 - any number of arguments like this now
09:44 - when I run the program so my program is
09:47 - running now so when I click this notify
09:49 - me button I can see the notify icon and
09:53 - in here I can see action one and action
09:57 - two here okay so so in this way you can
10:00 - use notification with your Android app I
