00:00 - in this video we will learn about
00:03 - multi-dimensional arrays or
00:06 - we will learn it by an example of
00:10 - writing a quartal line program to add
00:11 - two metrics using multi-dimensional
00:14 - arrays
00:15 - okay
00:16 - so
00:19 - let's say there is a main function
00:24 - and inside the main function
00:26 - there is
00:27 - a
00:28 - value
00:29 - of rows
00:31 - let's say it is 2
00:32 - and value of
00:35 - columns
00:38 - let's say it is 3
00:40 - now there is a value
00:42 - and i have to
00:44 - define a
00:46 - array okay so i hope you remember how to
00:48 - define an array
00:50 - now
00:52 - the value
00:54 - first
00:56 - matrix and
00:58 - it is an
01:00 - array of
01:05 - now array of two small errors okay so uh
01:10 - it is an array of two arrays
01:12 - okay so this is the multi-dimensional
01:14 - array okay so i'll just define int array
01:19 - of
01:21 - now
01:22 - let's say two three four now this is a
01:25 - multi-dimensional array because there
01:26 - are uh arrays
01:29 - there is an array of uh different arrays
01:32 - okay there is two arrays two three four
01:33 - and uh let's say uh five two three okay
01:37 - i i i learned another array
01:41 - let's say 5 2 3 so the first matrix is
01:45 - an array of two different metrics two
01:47 - int matrix
01:49 - okay similarly let's say i have
01:52 - a second matrix
01:57 - c c
01:58 - o n d
02:01 - matrix
02:03 - okay so let's say it is an array
02:06 - of
02:09 - inter
02:12 - minus 4
02:14 - 5
02:15 - 3
02:16 - and
02:17 - let's say end array
02:20 - of five six
02:24 - and three okay so we have two
02:26 - multi-dimensional arrays uh first matrix
02:29 - and second matrix now uh we have to
02:31 - write a program to uh add these two
02:33 - metrics
02:35 - okay so
02:37 - for
02:38 - adding
02:39 - these
02:40 - two
02:42 - mattresses
02:46 - what i'll do is
02:49 - so what is adding of two matrices if you
02:51 - remember in mathematics the adding if
02:54 - there is a matrix one two three
02:56 - okay okay i have to comment it out
03:05 - okay so if there is a matrix one
03:07 - two
03:08 - three and uh four two three four so i i
03:12 - have to add this matrix within a matrix
03:14 - with a matrix let's say five six seven
03:18 - and
03:19 - let's say
03:21 - uh seven
03:23 - seven eight nine
03:28 - okay
03:30 - now um
03:32 - what what i will do is i'll add one with
03:34 - five
03:35 - okay two with six
03:38 - three with seven two with seven three
03:40 - with eight and four with nine
03:41 - respectively okay so this is the
03:43 - addition of matrix now for adding these
03:45 - two metrics what i can do is i can
03:48 - introduce a variable sum
03:50 - which is equals to
03:52 - the
03:53 - array
03:57 - array
04:08 - just a second rows of
04:11 - int
04:12 - array
04:14 - and
04:16 - then
04:17 - columns okay so what i did here is
04:21 - uh
04:24 - firstly uh the two metrics are stored in
04:27 - a 2d array namely first matrix and
04:29 - second matrix we have also defined
04:30 - defined the number of rows and columns
04:32 - and stored them in variable rows and
04:34 - columns respectively then we initialized
04:36 - a new array
04:39 - then we can then we will initialize a
04:41 - new array of the given rows and columns
04:44 - called sum okay so the sum is
04:48 - the
04:49 - given rows and the columns of
04:51 - uh
04:52 - this the 2 and 3 which is defined
04:56 - okay
04:57 - so the sum is basically int
04:59 - array rows and indirect columns
05:03 - okay because
05:04 - uh these array this array has two rows
05:07 - okay
05:08 - and inside these two in inside this
05:12 - there is a two end arrays and each
05:14 - entire risk contains the number of
05:16 - columns which is three
05:18 - okay so i have defined the sum here
05:20 - which is
05:21 - two comma three
05:22 - let's say so uh for
05:27 - i
05:28 - in
05:30 - 0
05:31 - to
05:32 - rows
05:35 - minus 1
05:37 - okay
05:40 - and inside this
05:43 - so
05:46 - like
05:47 - we look through each index of both
05:50 - arrays
05:50 - to add stone add store the result add
05:54 - and store the result okay so for
05:57 - going through each area so we will go
06:00 - through the first array for this
06:02 - and inside this i'll introduce another
06:04 - for loop
06:06 - for the columns so for j in
06:09 - 0 to
06:11 - columns minus 1
06:14 - okay
06:15 - so by this we can iterate in the whole
06:17 - array or whole matrix i can say so some
06:22 - uh i
06:23 - and j
06:26 - okay because sum is what sum is
06:28 - basically this thing
06:30 - so some i j
06:32 - is equals to
06:33 - first matrix
06:36 - of i j
06:37 - i and first matrix j
06:40 - and
06:41 - then
06:42 - sum of
06:43 - first matrix and
06:45 - second matrix
06:47 - so what is happening here i can i'll
06:49 - explain it again
06:50 - to
06:51 - make it
06:53 - very much clear for you
06:55 - okay so
06:57 - uh let's see here
06:59 - okay so the first matrix let's see here
07:01 - okay
07:06 - yeah so the one here i can call the one
07:09 - as first matrix one one okay i can call
07:12 - it as first matrix one two so for
07:15 - hydrating in i j
07:17 - so i have introduced introduced two
07:19 - uh for loops and the first is called
07:21 - zero
07:23 - zeroth element second is called the
07:24 - second element third is called the third
07:25 - element that's why it is row minus one
07:27 - and column minus one okay so the sum
07:30 - will be the addition of two matrixes
07:32 - will be pretty clear for you
07:34 - okay so finally we loop through each
07:37 - element in the sum
07:39 - some array using uh for
07:41 - loop to print uh so yeah so for printing
07:45 - or displaying the result
07:48 - we have to display the result also right
07:51 - display the
07:52 - result
07:54 - so for displaying the result i'll
07:57 - print
07:58 - the
08:00 - firstly
08:01 - sum
08:03 - of
08:04 - the
08:05 - two
08:07 - matrices
08:09 - is
08:10 - okay now what is the sum
08:14 - so for printing the sum we have again
08:16 - use again uh we have we again have to
08:18 - use the loops so for row in sum
08:23 - okay
08:25 - and inside this i have to
08:28 - again introduce a for loop for column in
08:30 - sum
08:34 - column in sum
08:36 - i have to
08:38 - print
08:40 - not println i have to print the value of
08:43 - column
08:49 - and
08:50 - then some spaces
08:52 - okay
08:53 - so i have printed the column and then
08:55 - again iterated and then again print
08:57 - another column
08:59 - okay and then
09:02 - print ln
09:04 - okay so when i go ahead and
09:11 - run this
09:18 - okay there is some problem with it
09:22 - let me see what is
09:29 - okay yeah so
09:31 - when i
09:32 - run this program
09:35 - i can see that the sum of two matrices
09:37 - uh is minus two eight seven ten eight
09:40 - six
09:41 - oh all right i can cross check it also
09:44 - now with
09:45 - this two minus four
09:47 - three plus five 4 plus 3 2 plus 5 plus 5
09:51 - 2 plus 6 and 3 plus 3 okay so this is
09:54 - correct
09:55 - so in this video we have learned about
09:57 - the multi-dimensional arrays and how to
10:00 - add to matrices we have coded the code
10:04 - in content okay so thank you for
10:05 - watching this video stay tuned
